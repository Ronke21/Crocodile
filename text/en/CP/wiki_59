<text>Scott Kevin Walker (born November 2, 1967) is an American politician who served as the 45th governor of Wisconsin from 2011 to 2019. A member of the Republican Party, he previously served as Milwaukee County executive from 2002 to 2010.

Born in Colorado Springs, Colorado, Walker was raised in Plainfield, Iowa and in Delavan, Wisconsin. He was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1992, representing a district in western Milwaukee County. In 2002, Walker was elected Milwaukee County Executive in a special election following the resignation of F. Thomas Ament; he was elected to a full term in 2004 and was re-elected in 2008.

Walker ran for Governor of Wisconsin in 2006, but dropped out of the race before the primary election. He ran again in 2010 and won. Shortly after his inauguration in 2011, Walker gained national attention by introducing the Wisconsin Budget Repair Bill; the legislation proposed to effectively eliminate collective bargaining for most Wisconsin public employees. In response, opponents of the bill protested at the Wisconsin State Capitol and Senate Democrats left the state in an effort to prevent the bill from being passed. Nevertheless, the Wisconsin Budget Repair Bill became law in March 2011. Opposition to the law led to an attempt to recall Walker from office in 2012. Walker prevailed in the recall election, becoming the first of two incumbent governors in the history of the United States to win a recall election, the other being California governor Gavin Newsom in 2021.

Walker was re-elected in 2014, defeating Democratic Madison School Board member Mary Burke. Following heavy speculation about his presidential ambitions, Walker launched a campaign for the Republican nomination in the 2016 presidential election; however, he withdrew from the race after only two months as a result of declining support in polls. Walker sought a third term as governor in 2018, but was narrowly defeated by Democrat Tony Evers.

Walker has served as the president of the Young America&#x27;s Foundation since 2021.

==Early life and education==
Walker was born on November 2, 1967, in Colorado Springs, Colorado, the elder of two sons of Patricia Ann &quot;Pat&quot; (née Fitch; born December 30, 1938), a bookkeeper, and Llewellyn Scott &quot;Llew&quot; Walker (May 19, 1939 – October 7, 2018), a Baptist minister.

The family moved to Plainfield, Iowa, in 1970, where Llew worked as pastor in the local Baptist Church, TBC, and served on the municipal council. When Walker was ten years old, the family moved to Delavan, Wisconsin, where his father continued to work as a minister, at the First Baptist Church of Delavan. In 1985, when Walker was in high school, he attended and represented Wisconsin at two weeks of American Legion-sponsored training in leadership and government at Badger Boys State in Wisconsin and Boys Nation in Washington, D.C. While at the event, he met President Ronald Reagan and had a photo taken with him. Walker has credited the experience with solidifying his interest in public service and giving him the &quot;political bug&quot;. He attained the highest rank, Eagle Scout, in the Boy Scouts of America, and graduated from Delavan-Darien High School in 1986.

In the fall of 1986, Walker enrolled at Marquette University. Within a few weeks of beginning his collegiate studies, Walker became a student senator and led a committee investigating alleged misuse of funds by student leaders. 
During the same year, he volunteered for Tommy Thompson&#x27;s gubernatorial campaign. In 1988, Walker lost a &quot;fiercely-fought&quot; campaign for student government president. Walker led the anti-abortion Students for Life group at Marquette.

Walker discontinued his studies at Marquette in the spring of 1990, having earned 94 of the 128 minimum credits needed to graduate. He left in good standing with a 2.59/4.0 grade point average, but without having obtained a degree. Walker has said that he dropped out of college when he received a full-time job offer from the American Red Cross.

==Early political career==
===Wisconsin State Assembly===
In 1990, at age 22, Walker ran for Milwaukee&#x27;s 7th District seat in the Wisconsin State Assembly. He won the Republican nomination, but lost in the general election to incumbent Democrat Gwen Moore, receiving less than one-third of the vote. In 1993, Walker moved to Wauwatosa, a suburb of Milwaukee, and ran in a special election in the more conservative 14th legislative district, based around Wauwatosa. He defeated Democrat Chris Ament, son of then-Milwaukee County Executive Tom Ament.

During the campaign, Walker backed welfare reform and opposed the expansion of mass transit. He supported a cap on state spending and said that the law on resolving labor disputes with local government employees needed to be reformed. Walker received the endorsements of Wisconsin Right to Life and &quot;The Milwaukee Sentinel&quot;, which called him a fiscal conservative and noted his anti-abortion, tough-on-crime, and pro-welfare reform positions. He was re-elected four times, serving until 2002 when he became a county executive.

While in the Assembly, Walker was interested in criminal justice matters and chaired the Committees on Correctional Facilities, and Corrections and the Courts. Over the years, he served on a number of other committees, including Health, Census and Redistricting, Financial Institutions, and Housing. As a freshman legislator in 1993, he co-sponsored right-to-work legislation. In 1999 he advocated for a truth-in-sentencing bill that increased prison time for some crimes and eliminated parole for others. Walker was a member of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) at the time, and credited the organization for much of the success of the legislation.

In 2001, he sponsored a bill to prevent pharmacists from being disciplined for refusing to fill prescriptions for emergency contraception and was a supporter of a bill to require voters to show photo ID at the polls. According to research by two political analysts, Walker was more conservative than about 90% of his peers in the assembly and about 80% of the Republicans in the assembly.

Walker had a pro-life record in the Assembly. With the exception of some bills while Walker was running for Milwaukee County Executive, Walker either sponsored or cosponsored all but three bills that would have restricted abortions.

In 2001–02, Walker and fellow Assemblymember Michael Huebsch objected to the hiring of a state employee, Rev. Jamyi Witch, on the basis of her religious beliefs as a Wiccan. Walker claimed that Witch&#x27;s hiring as a prison chaplain raised &quot;both personal and political concerns&quot; because she &quot;practice[d] a religion that actually offends people of many other faiths&quot;. Walker and Huebsch were ultimately unsuccessful in terminating Witch&#x27;s chaplaincy or employment.

===Milwaukee County Executive===
Walker became Milwaukee County Executive in a special election run in April 2002, after the former County Executive, Tom Ament, resigned in the wake of a county pension-fund scandal. Walker was elected to a four-year term in 2004, winning 57% of the vote to defeat former state budget director, David Riemer. Although in a liberal county and running for a nonpartisan position, Walker ran openly as a conservative Republican. He won another four-year term in 2008, defeating State Senator Lena Taylor with 59% of the vote. Upon first being elected, Walker became the youngest person and the first Republican ever elected to the position and remains the only Republican to hold this office to date.

Walker won the office on a platform of fiscal conservatism, promising to give back part of his own salary. He said that his voluntary give-back gave him moral authority to make cuts in the budget. He returned $60,000 per year (slightly less than half of his salary) during his first term, and reduced his give-back to $10,000 per year during his second term.

During his eight years in office, there were disputes with the county board &quot;over taxes, privatization of public services, quality of parks and public buildings, and delivery of social services&quot;, according to the &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot;. The County Board approved several budgets over Walker&#x27;s veto and he never submitted a budget with a higher property tax than the board had approved the prior year. During Walker&#x27;s tenure the number of county employees was reduced by over 20% and the $3.5 million county deficit was turned into a surplus. In addition, he cut over $44 million in proposed spending through his veto powers and helped eliminate the waiting list for long-term care for senior citizens.

====Operation Freedom investigation====

Walker appointed Kevin Kavanaugh, treasurer of the local chapter of the Military Order of the Purple Heart, as a member of the County Veterans Service Commission. Walker raised funds annually for veterans at the Operation Freedom Benefit, with proceeds to the Military Order of the Purple Heart.

Walker&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Thomas Nardelli, indicated that he went to Walker with concerns about missing money in 2009, and Walker directed him to report it to the district attorney&#x27;s office. The district attorney did not immediately act but later launched a &quot;John Doe&quot; investigation. Kavanaugh and four others were arrested for theft of funds. Kavanaugh was convicted and sentenced to 21 months in prison.

Tim Russell, employed by Walker in a number of posts, was implicated in the same investigation; he was charged in January 2012 and pleaded guilty in November 2012 to diverting more than $21,000 to his personal bank account. In 2010, Walker&#x27;s last year as Milwaukee County executive, Russell was his deputy chief of staff and Milwaukee Housing Director. Walker was not charged with any wrongdoing.

==Governor of Wisconsin==
===Elections===
====2006 gubernatorial campaign====

While county executive, Walker became a candidate, in February 2005, in the 2006 race for Wisconsin governor. He dropped out on March 24, 2006, after about 14 months of campaigning, citing fundraising difficulties. Walker threw his support to fellow Republican Mark Andrew Green, who won the Republican primary unopposed, and Walker actively campaigned for him during the general election. Green lost the general election, in November 2006, to the incumbent Democrat, Jim Doyle. Despite Green&#x27;s loss, Walker&#x27;s strong support for him helped increase Walker&#x27;s favorability with the state GOP and positioned him as the frontrunner for the 2010 election.

====2010 gubernatorial campaign====
Walker was an early favorite for the 2010 Republican Party endorsement for Wisconsin governor, winning straw polls of Wisconsin GOP convention attendees in 2007 and 2008. He announced his candidacy in late April 2009 after several months of previewing his campaign themes of reduced taxes and reduced spending to Republican audiences around the state. He criticized the 2009–2011 Wisconsin state budget as too big given the slow economy. In 2009 and 2010, Americans for Prosperity helped raise Walker&#x27;s statewide profile, inviting him to address its events and rallies throughout the state. Walker won the Wisconsin GOP convention endorsement on May 22, 2010, receiving 91% of the votes cast by delegates. He won the Republican nomination in the primary election of September 14, 2010, receiving 59% of the popular vote, while former U.S. Representative Mark Neumann garnered 39%.
As part of his campaign platform, Walker said he would create 250,000 jobs in his first term through a program that would include tax cuts for small businesses, capital gains tax cuts, and income tax cuts. He proposed cutting state employee wages and benefits to help pay for these tax cuts. Critics argued that his proposals would help only the wealthy and that cutting the salaries of public employees would adversely affect state services, while supporters argued that tax cuts for businesses would spur the economy and create jobs.

Walker indicated he would refuse an $810 million award from the federal Department of Transportation to build a high speed railroad line from Madison to Milwaukee as he believed it would cost the state $7.5 million per year to operate and would not prove profitable. This was in spite of offers by the mayor of Madison and the Dane County executive to help absorb costs the state might have incurred. The award was later rescinded and split among other states. This cost the state at least $60 million for rail repairs federal funds would have covered.

Social issues played a part in the campaign. Walker has stated that he is &quot;100% pro-life&quot; and that he believes life should be protected from conception to natural death. He opposes abortion, including in cases of rape and incest. He supports abstinence-only sex education in the public schools and opposes state supported clinical services that provide birth control and testing and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases to teens under age 18 without parental consent. He supports the right of pharmacists to refuse to fill prescriptions for contraceptives on religious or moral grounds. He supports adult stem cell research but opposes human embryonic stem cell research.

As an opponent of same-sex marriage, he opposed a law that allowed gay couples to register with counties to get certain benefits, such as hospital visitation rights. He later stated that his position on same-sex marriage was no longer relevant because Wisconsin&#x27;s ban on same-sex marriage had been overturned by a federal court. Walker said he would sign an Arizona-style immigration bill, which would allow local police to stop suspected illegal immigrants, if he were elected.

On November 2, 2010, his 43rd birthday, Walker won the general election with 52% of total votes cast, while Democrat Tom Barrett received 46%. His running mate was Rebecca Kleefisch, a former Milwaukee television news reporter. Walker&#x27;s victory came amid a series of Wisconsin GOP victories, with conservative Republican Ron Johnson winning the contested U.S. Senate seat, and with the GOP gaining majorities in the state&#x27;s U.S. House delegation, State Assembly, and State Senate.


====2012 recall election====
After the contentious collective bargaining dispute, Walker&#x27;s disapproval ratings varied between 50% and 51% while his approval ratings varied between 47% and 49% in 2011. The effort to recall Walker officially began on November 15, 2011.

Walker reportedly raised more than $30 million during the recall effort, with a significant portion from out of state. Commentators claimed the amount of money raised was &quot;illustrating the national significance both political parties saw in the recall fight&quot;. In March 2012, the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board announced there were more than 900,000 valid signatures to force a recall vote, well above the required minimum of 540,208.

In February 2012, Walker&#x27;s campaign requested additional time for the petition signatures to be verified, claiming about 20% of the signatures were not valid. Democrats argued that even if 20% of the signatures were disregarded they still had obtained 180,000 more signatures than required to initiate the recall. Wisconsin Democratic Party Communications Director Graeme Zielinski claimed Walker was &quot;delaying the inevitable&quot;. On February 17, 2012, Dane County Judge Richard Niess, who had signed the recall petition, denied Walker&#x27;s request for additional time. On March 30, 2012, the Government Accountability Board unanimously ruled in favor of the recall election. The recall elections for both Walker and Kleefisch took place on June 5, 2012.

During the Republican primary election for the recall, Walker received 626,538 votes. In the Democratic primary, all of the Democratic candidates combined received 670,288, with the winner, Tom Barrett, receiving 390,109, a majority. On June 5, 2012, Walker won the recall election. This was only the third gubernatorial recall election in U.S. history. Walker won the recall, his second face-off with Barrett, by a slightly larger margin (53% to 46%) than in the 2010 election (52% to 46%) and became the first U.S. governor to win a recall election.

By the end of the recall election, Walker had a national network of conservative donors and groups supporting him. Nearly 300,000 people donated to his recall campaign, which garnered roughly $37 million. Two-thirds of the contributions came from outside Wisconsin. Walker, or the conservative causes he supports, are also supported by conservative donors and groups including Michael W. Grebe, Diane Hendricks, and the Bradley Foundation, founder of the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute and the MacIver Institute; and David H. Koch and Charles Koch, initial funders of Americans for Prosperity.

====2014 gubernatorial campaign====
In his third election in four years, Walker faced Democrat Mary Burke to determine the governor of Wisconsin. Wisconsin labor unions, who helped organize the 2012 Wisconsin recall election, donated funds to boost Burke&#x27;s campaign. Walker received help from a number of conservative donors. The polling through most of the race was close and no candidate was a definitive favorite. The gubernatorial election took place on November 4, 2014, and Walker won re-election by 6 percent of the vote.

====2018 gubernatorial campaign====

Walker sought a third term in the 2018 elections. His opponent, Democratic Wisconsin Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Evers, defeated him in the election.

=== Tenure ===

Walker took the oath of office to become the 45th Governor of Wisconsin on January 3, 2011.
By January 25, 2011, the state legislature passed a series of Walker-backed bills, the largest of which would cut taxes for businesses at &quot;a two-year cost of $67 million&quot;, according to the &quot;Associated Press&quot;.

Walker became a figure of national recognition and controversy after he proposed the &quot;Wisconsin budget repair bill&quot; in 2011. The bill, which would eventually be passed by the Wisconsin Legislature, significantly changed the collective bargaining process for most public employees in Wisconsin. Opponents of Walker&#x27;s actions launched a push for a recall election and received enough support to force an election on June 5, 2012, the first time a Governor of Wisconsin had ever faced recall.

During Walker&#x27;s first term as governor, the state&#x27;s $3.6 billion budget deficit was turned into a surplus and taxes were cut by $2 billion. More than 100,000 jobs were created in the state of Wisconsin.

====2011 Budget Repair Bill====

Walker proposed the Wisconsin Budget Repair Bill on February 11, 2011, estimated to save Wisconsin $30 million in the current fiscal year and $300 million over the next two years. The bill requires additional contributions by state and local government workers to their health care plans and pensions, amounting to roughly an 8% decrease in the average government worker&#x27;s take home pay. The bill eliminated, for most state workers, other than certain public safety workers, many collective bargaining rights aside from seeking pay increases, and then not above the rate of inflation, unless approved by a voter referendum. Under the bill, unions have to win yearly votes to continue representing government workers and could no longer have dues automatically deducted from government workers&#x27; paychecks. Certain law enforcement personnel and firefighters are exempt from the bargaining changes.

On January 18, 2011, days after Walker&#x27;s inauguration, Beloit businesswoman and Walker supporter Diane Hendricks asked him, &quot;Any chance we&#x27;ll ever get to be a completely red state and work on these unions and become a right-to-work (state)?&quot;, and he replied:
Well, we&#x27;re going to start in a couple weeks with our budget adjustment bill. The first step is, we&#x27;re going to deal with collective bargaining for all public employee unions, because you use divide and conquer. So for us the base we&#x27;ve got for that is the fact that we&#x27;ve gotbudgetarily we can&#x27;t afford not to. If we have collective bargaining agreements in place, there&#x27;s no way not only the state but local governments can balance things out. So you think city of Beloit, city of Janesville, any of the school districts, that opens the door once we do that. That&#x27;s your bigger problem right there.

After videotape of the interaction was released in May 2012, Walker&#x27;s opponents said Walker had revealed his intention to target private sector unions and pursue right-to-work legislation. Walker said he was not pursuing right-to-work legislation and that in his 2011 comment to Hendricks he was referring to his responsibility as governor to defend taxpayers from unions that he believed were frustrating resolution of the state&#x27;s budget deficit.

In announcing the proposed legislation, Walker said the Wisconsin National Guard and other state agencies were prepared to prevent disruptions in state services. He later explained that police and firefighters were excluded from the changes because he would not jeopardize public safety. Walker stated that the bill was necessary to avoid laying off thousands of state employees and that no one should be surprised by its provisions. Union leaders and Democratic legislators immediately criticized the bill, claiming Walker had never campaigned on doing away with collective bargaining rights. In a media interview a week later, Walker said he was not trying to break the public sector unions, noting that Wisconsin government employees would retain the protections of civil service laws. He said that asking employees to pay half the national average for health care benefits was a modest request. Demonstrators began protesting the proposed bill on February 14, 2011. During the sixth day of the protests, leaders of the two largest unions said publicly they were prepared to accept the financial concessions in the bill, but would not agree to the limitations of collective bargaining rights.

On February 17, 2011, all 14 Democratic state senators traveled to Illinois to prevent the passage of the bill by depriving the Senate of the quorum necessary for a vote. The missing legislators said they would not return to Madison unless Walker agreed to remove the limitations on collective bargaining from the bill. Walker warned that if the budget repair bill was not passed by March 1, refinancing of a $165 million state debt would fail, and more cuts would be needed to balance the budget.

By February 20, protestors had undertaken a physical occupation of the Capitol building. Protestors also covered the walls of the Capitol with thousands of homemade signs. On February 20, a union organizer participating in the protests said that the protests would continue &quot;as long as it takes.&quot; Other union leaders called for teachers to return to work. On February 26, between 70,000 and 100,000 protested the bill in Madison. They were joined by thousands at state capitals around the nation.

Appearing on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; on February 27, Walker stated that he did not believe the unions were negotiating in good faith in offering pension and health-care concessions because local unions had recently pushed through contracts with school boards and city councils that did not include contributions to the pensions and health care and that, in one case, a contract even included a pay increase. On February 28, the largest public union filed an unfair labor practices complaint with the state labor relations board, claiming that Walker had a duty to negotiate, but had refused. On March 8, private emails dating back to February 28 were released. These emails showed that Governor Walker had tried to negotiate with Democratic legislators, even proposing to allow some collective bargaining rights.

After failing to reach a compromise with Democratic legislators, the Republican-led Senate removed certain fiscal provisions from the bill, allowing it to be passed without the usual quorum requirement. On March 9, 2011, the Wisconsin Senate voted 18–1 to pass the legislation; Senate Democrats remained out of state and did not participate in the vote. The Wisconsin Assembly passed the bill one day later by a vote of 53–42. After the Assembly passed the bill, Walker released a statement in which he &quot;applaud[ed] all members of the Assembly for showing up, debating the legislation and participating in democracy&quot;. Walker signed the Wisconsin Budget Repair Bill into law on March 11, 2011. On March 12, the fourteen Democratic senators who had left the state returned.

The Budget Repair Law was challenged in court. On March 18, Judge Maryann Sumi issued a court order to prohibit publication of the bill by the Secretary of State while legal challenges to it were being considered. On March 26, the Legislative Reference Bureau (LRB) published the bill. Sumi subsequently clarified that, pursuant to her order, the bill could not be considered to be published until the court challenge was resolved. On May 26, Judge Sumi struck down the law, finding that its passage violated state open meetings laws. The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed Sumi&#x27;s ruling and upheld the law on June 14, 2011.

Walker claimed that the Budget Repair Law would &quot;save jobs, protect taxpayers, reform government and help balance the budget.&quot; He added, &quot;You see, despite a lot of the rhetoric we&#x27;ve heard over the past 11 days the bill I put forward isn&#x27;t aimed at state workers, and it certainly isn&#x27;t a battle with unions. If it was, we would have eliminated collective bargaining entirely or we would have gone after the private-sector unions.&quot; As part of the cost savings resulting from the changes to collective bargaining, Walker pointed to significant reductions in the premiums for health insurance for many school districts. Prior to the deficit reduction bill, WEA Trust, which is affiliated with Wisconsin&#x27;s largest teachers union, dominated the market for health insurance for the state&#x27;s school districts. The changes to collective bargaining made it easier for school districts to change health insurance providers and negotiate better premiums. Walker claimed that Wisconsin school districts have saved an estimated $30 million as a result of the change.

=====John Doe campaign finance investigation=====
In August 2012, the first investigation, which had been launched by John Chisholm, Milwaukee County District Attorney, a Democrat, into missing funds, was rolled into a second John Doe probe based on a theory that Governor Walker&#x27;s campaign had illegally coordinated with conservative groups engaged in issue advocacy during the recall elections.

The initial John Doe judge, retired Kenosha County Circuit Judge Barbara A. Kluka, overseeing the John Doe investigation issued 30 subpoenas and 5 search warrants. She also issued a secrecy order which meant those being investigated were legally bound from discussing any facet of the investigation publicly. On October 29, 2013, she recused herself from the investigation without explanation. Kluka&#x27;s replacement, Judge Gregory Peterson, quashed several subpoenas in January 2014, saying &quot;there was no probable cause shown that they violated campaign finance laws&quot;.

On July 16, 2015, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled 4–2 that Walker did not illegally collaborate with conservative groups during the recall campaigns. Writing for the majority in the case, Justice Michael Gableman stated: &quot;To be clear, this conclusion ends the John Doe investigation because the special prosecutor&#x27;s legal theory is unsupported in either reason or law,&quot; he said, &quot;Consequently, the investigation is closed.&quot; In March 2017, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit filed against the investigators of the case.

====2011–2013 budget proposal====
Wisconsin faced an anticipated deficit of approximately $3.6 billion in the 2012–2013 budget cycle which must be balanced according to state law. Walker&#x27;s proposed budget cut $834 million in state aid for K–12 education, which would be a 7.9% reduction from the prior budget. He proposed a 5.5% decrease in the maximum amount of funding school districts can receive from state aid and property taxes, which would limit how much property taxes could be increased to compensate for the reduction in state aid. The budget lowered state capital gains taxes for investments in Wisconsin businesses. It increased spending on health care by $1.3 billion to cover increased costs for Medicaid, and increased transportation funding by $410.5 million.

====2013–2015 budget proposal====

Walker&#x27;s proposed budget for fiscal 2013–2015 froze spending on public schools and tightened the income requirements for Medicaid recipients. It proposed an increase in funding for fighting domestic violence, mental health care, higher education, and job training. It also included a $343 million cut in income taxes and an expansion of the state&#x27;s school voucher program.

====2015–2017 budget proposal====
Walker&#x27;s proposed budget for fiscal 2015–2017 included a $300 million cut to the University of Wisconsin System, while holding funding flat for K–12 public schools and continuing to expand the school voucher program. It included a plan to borrow $1.3 billion to fund improvements to roads and infrastructure, and proposed drug testing for recipients of public benefits like Medicaid and food stamps.

====Domestic partner registry defense====
On May 13, 2011, the Walker administration petitioned the Dane County Circuit Court for permission to withdraw the state as a defendant from &quot;Appling v. Doyle&quot;, which was a challenge to the state&#x27;s domestic partner registry.

====Regulatory reform bill====
On May 23, 2011, Walker signed legislation changing the process of creating administrative rules for the state. This measure, which became 2011 Wisconsin Act 21 (and became effective June 8, 2011), changes State agency authority to promulgate rules, provides for gubernatorial approval of proposed rules, revised the requirement of an economic impact analysis for proposed rules and changes venue in the process of judicial review of agency rules.

====Voter ID law====

On May 25, 2011, Walker signed a voter ID law that required voters to show a government-issued ID before casting a ballot.

The ACLU filed a lawsuit in federal court to invalidate the law on December 13, 2011, claiming the law violates the constitutional guarantee of equal protection under the law. On April 29, 2014, U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman struck down the law, saying it violated the Voting Rights Act and U.S. Constitution.

The Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the voter ID law under the Constitution of Wisconsin in two other cases in July 2014. On September 12, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the law to be put into effect just 54 days before the 2014 elections, overturning a previous ruling in federal court.

On October 9, 2014, the state was again barred from implementing the voter ID law for 2014 by the U.S. Supreme Court. On March 23, 2015, the Supreme Court denied writ of certiorari, thus ruling in favor of the state of Wisconsin&#x27;s new stricter voter ID law.

====Rejection of health care funds====
In January 2012, Walker returned a $37.6 million federal grant meant to set up a health exchange in Wisconsin for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Walker said &quot;Stopping the encroachment of Obamacare in our state, which has the potential to have a devastating impact on Wisconsin&#x27;s economy, is a top priority.&quot; Walker rejected an $11 million federal grant designed to improve Medicaid enrollment systems. It can take up to 3 months to determine whether an applicant qualifies for the program. If the applicant does not qualify, the state must pay the medical costs for the first three months. The Walker administration previously said it wants to end the practice of presuming some applicants are eligible and go to a real-time system for determining eligibility. Walker rejected an expansion of Medicaid coverage for the state, but instead reduced the eligibility requirements for the state&#x27;s BadgerCare program.

====Education====
On April 2, 2012, Walker signed a law to fund evaluation of the reading skills of kindergartners as part of an initiative to ensure that students are reading at or above grade level by 3rd grade. The law also created a system for evaluating teachers and principals based in part on the performance of their students. It specified that student performance metrics must be based on objective measures, including their performance on standardized tests.

Walker approved a two-year freeze of tuition at the University of Wisconsin System in the 2013 budget. In 2014, he proposed a two-year extension of the freeze based on expected cash balances for the system in excess of $1 billion.

On February 3, 2015, Walker delivered a budget proposal to the Wisconsin Legislature, in which he recommended placing the University of Wisconsin System under the direction of a &quot;private authority&quot;, governed by the Board of Regents (all the governor&#x27;s appointees). The budget proposal called for a 13% reduction in state funding for the university system.

The budget proposal also called for re-writing the Wisconsin Idea, replacing the university&#x27;s fundamental commitment to the &quot;search for truth&quot; with the goal of workforce readiness. Walker faced broad criticism for the changes and at first blamed the rewriting of the Wisconsin Idea on a &quot;drafting error.&quot; Politifact and the &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot; later reported that Walker&#x27;s administration had insisted to University of Wisconsin officials on scrapping the Wisconsin Idea, the guiding principle for the state&#x27;s universities for more than a century. Walker then acknowledged that UW System officials had raised objections about the proposal and had been told the changes were not open to debate.

====Indian gaming====
Section 20(b)(1)(A) of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) gives governors unrestricted authority to approve or veto any off-reservation tribal casino located in their state.

Walker has said he would only approve new off-reservation casino projects if they are supported by every tribe in the state. This has been referred to as the &quot;Walker Rule&quot;. In January 2015, Walker rejected a proposed casino in Kenosha, Wisconsin.

====Mental health====
Walker signed a 2013–2015 state budget and subsequent law that established the Wisconsin Office of Children&#x27;s Mental Health. In 2016, Walker signed legislation creating a pair of pilot programs to test alternative-care delivery and payment models for Medicaid recipients who have significant or chronic mental illness. In 2017, Walker expanded Wisconsin&#x27;s mental health provider rates by $17 million. Walker also signed legislation increasing funding for peer-run respite centers.

Following the Slender Man stabbing months earlier, Walker issued a proclamation declaring Wednesday, August 13, 2014, &quot;Purple Hearts for Healing Day&quot;, and encouraged the people of Wisconsin to wear purple to honor the victim of the stabbing. He also praised the &quot;strength and determination&quot; exhibited by the victim during her recovery.

====Abortion====
Walker signed the 2011 state budget that de-funded Planned Parenthood. In 2013, Walker signed a bill that requires women seeking abortions to undergo an ultrasound and doctors to show the patients the image of the fetus.

In 2013, Walker signed a bill requiring abortion providers in Wisconsin to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles. The law was found unconstitutional by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in 2015. The court found the medical justifications for such restrictions &quot;nonexistent&quot; and said they &quot;cannot be taken seriously as a measure to improve women&#x27;s health.&quot; In June 2016, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled on &quot;Whole Woman&#x27;s Health v. Hellerstedt&quot;, and struck down admitting privileges and other similar restrictions, finding that they were an unconstitutional &quot;undue burden&quot; on women. The day after delivering this decision, the Court refused to hear the Walker administration&#x27;s appeal of the Seventh Circuit decision, leaving its finding of unconstitutionality in place. Walker blamed an &quot;activist court&quot; for finding his law unconstitutional.

On July 20, 2015, Walker signed a bill into law that banned all abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy, &quot;except when the life of the mother is in immediate danger.&quot;

===Right to work legislation===
In 2012, regarding right-to-work legislation, Walker told reporters at the state Republican Party convention that &quot;It&#x27;s not going to get to my desk. ... I&#x27;m going to do everything in my power to make sure it isn&#x27;t there because my focal point (is) private sector unions have overwhelmingly come to the table to be my partner in economic development.&quot; While campaigning for re-election in 2014, Walker again said he had no plans to pursue right-to-work legislation focused on private unions.

Once the legislation was initiated in the state legislature, Walker stated: &quot;I haven&#x27;t changed my position on it, it just wasn&#x27;t a priority for me. But should they pass it within the next two weeks, which is their target, I plan on signing it.&quot; On March 9, 2015, Walker signed legislation making Wisconsin a right-to-work state. The law applied to private employee unions as well as public. Once signed, Walker claimed partial credit for the right-to-work law. Politifact.com rated Walker&#x27;s position on right-to-work as a &quot;major reversal of position.&quot;

Three trade unions, including the AFL–CIO, subsequently sued to get the law overturned as unconstitutional. In March 2015, the court declined the unions&#x27; request to put the law on hold until the lawsuit is settled. Following a protracted legal battle, in 2017 the U.S. appeals court in Chicago upheld Wisconsin&#x27;s right-to-work law ending the substantive legal challenges to the law.

===WEDC===
In 2011, the WEDC was created by Walker as a quasi-public entity to replace the state&#x27;s Department of Commerce with the objective of incenting job creation in Wisconsin. A 2013 report from the state&#x27;s Legislative Audit Committee indicated that the organization gave some &quot;grants, loans, and tax credits to ineligible recipients, for ineligible projects, and for amounts that exceeded specified limits.&quot; It also reported that WEDC &quot;did not consistently perform statutorily required program oversight duties such as monitoring the contractually specified performance of award recipients&quot;. According to Wisconsin Public Radio, &quot;The agency has been plagued by mismanagement and questions about handing out loans without properly vetting recipients.&quot;

In June 2015, it was reported that under Walker, WEDC gave out $124 million between the years 2011 and 2013 without formal review. Based on the 27 awards during that period, 2,100 jobs had been created to date out of a total expected of 6,100. $62.5 million was awarded to Kohl&#x27;s to create 3,000 jobs as part of a headquarters expansion but only 473 had been created, $18 million was awarded to Kestrel Aircraft which was supposed to create 665 jobs but only created 24, and $15 million went to Plexus Corp. to create 350 jobs, but created zero. In July 2013, WEDC adopted a new policy requiring written reviews on all program awards. According to WEDC, it had approved more than 760 reviewed awards under the new policy by June 2015.

Walker introduced a state budget in February 2015 which removed all of the elected officials from the board. This included removing himself from chairmanship of WEDC. This was revised by the Legislature&#x27;s budget committee who altered it to only remove Walker. Walker signed the budget in July 2015.

=== Foxconn agreement ===

Walker approved an agreement with the Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn to set up a plant in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin. As part of the agreement, Foxconn was set to receive subsidies ranging from $3 billion to $4.8 billion (paid in increments if Foxconn met certain targets), which would be by far the largest subsidy ever given to a foreign firm in U.S. history. Foxconn said in return that it would set up a $10 billion factory that initially employed 3,000 (set to increase to 13,000). Numerous economists expressed skepticism that the benefits would exceed the costs of the deal. The nonpartisan Wisconsin&#x27;s Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimated that the Foxconn plant would not break even on the investment until 2043, and that was in the best-case scenario. Others noted that Foxconn had previously made similar unfulfilled claims about job creation in various localities.

Foxconn sought to locate a plant in the Great Lakes region, because it needs access to large amounts of water. The other Great Lakes states were not willing to offer as generous subsidies as Wisconsin.

Initially, the subsidies were set at $3 billion, which would have cost the state $231,000 per job created (under the assumption of 13,000 jobs). The cost of the subsidies were higher than yearly state funding for the University of Wisconsin System and the state prisons. Other estimates of the subsidies go as high as $4.8 billion, which meant that the cost of the subsidy per job (assuming 13,000 jobs) was more than $346,000. Depending on how many jobs are created, the cost per job may go as high as more than a million dollars.

Walker exempted the firm from Wisconsin&#x27;s environmental rules regarding wetlands and streams. Walker and the Trump administration rolled back air pollution limits in the area of the plant, overruling objections of Environmental Protection Agency staff. The plant was estimated to contribute significantly to air pollution in the region. Environmentalists criticized the decision to allow Foxconn to draw 7 million gallons of water per day from Lake Michigan. The roughly four square miles of land necessary for the Foxconn campus was in part made possible by forcing homeowners to sell at a fixed price under the threat of seizing the land under eminent domain.

In 2018, the Walker administration shifted up to $90 million in local road funding to road work related to the Foxconn factory. The Wisconsin state legislature granted Foxconn special legal privileges within the Wisconsin judicial system.

=== Curbing the powers of an incoming Democratic administration ===
Shortly after losing his re-election bid in 2018, Walker expressed support for a proposal by Wisconsin Republicans to curb the powers of the incoming Democratic administration during the lame-duck session. In December 2018, Walker signed legislation to strip powers from the incoming Democratic administration. The incoming administration suggested it would challenge the legislation in court. In 2010, Walker had expressed opposition to attempts to pass legislation during the lame-duck session before he took office as governor. An official lawsuit against the legislation was filed by Democratic organizations on January 10, 2019, in Dane County court.

=== Assessments of tenure ===
In 2019, the &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot; described Walker as a polarizing governor, writing that while &quot;his personality wasn&#x27;t divisive... his leadership was polarizing in several ways. One was simply his successful pursuit of aggressively conservative policies, which excited his supporters and angered his opponents. A second was the &#x27;shock and awe&#x27; factor. His defining early accomplishmentall but ending collective bargaining for public-sector unionswas not a policy he campaigned on in 2010. It was a post-election bombshell... A third factor was a systematic project by the governor and GOP lawmakers to make it more difficult for Democrats to win elections or exercise power by tilting the political playing field.&quot;

==2016 presidential campaign==


In late January 2015, Walker set up a 527 organization called &quot;Our American Revival&quot; to &quot;help spread his message and underwrite his activities&quot; which &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described as helpful for building the political and fundraising networks for a run for the presidency.

In February 2015, Trip Gabriel of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described him as having &quot;quickly vaulted into the top tier of likely candidates in the Republican presidential race&quot;. On April 20, at a fundraising event for the New York State Republican Party, David Koch told donors that he and his brother, who oversee one of the biggest private political organizations in the country, believed that Walker would be the Republican nominee.

Following a controversial statement by Rudy Giuliani, Walker declined to answer the question of whether he believes President Obama loves America or was a true Christian, stating that he did not know President Obama&#x27;s patriotism was in doubt.

In June 2015, Walker took a further step towards a presidential campaign when he established a &quot;testing-the-waters&quot; federal campaign committee. This allowed him to raise federal campaign dollars as he explored a possible presidential run.

In July 2015, after Walker aides said that he would soon announce his candidacy, Walker announced his candidacy via social media on the morning of July 13, 2015, with Walker speaking at a formal event in Waukesha, Wisconsin that afternoon.

As of August 18, 2015, Crowdpac ranked Walker as the fourth-most conservative candidate (following Rand Paul, Ted Cruz and Ben Carson) for the 2016 presidential election based on an analysis of campaign donors. Based on an analysis including Crowdpac&#x27;s rating, public statements by candidates on issues, and congressional voting (not applicable to Walker), FiveThirtyEight had ranked Walker the third-most conservative among candidates as of May 27, 2015.

Walker, who started his campaign as a top-tier candidate after what was considered a &quot;break-out&quot; event at the Iowa Freedom Caucus in January, saw his position gradually decline over the summer in 2015. Initially a front-runner in the race, Walker saw a precipitous decline in both polling numbers and campaign funds. On August 6, Walker participated in the first Republican primary debate in Cleveland, Ohio. His performance was seen as decent, without much fanfare nor attention given to it due to his short answers to questions which limited his airtime. Shortly after the debate, Walker admitted to wanting more airtime, but also mentioned that there were multiple debates ahead and that he was successful in changing the argument to which candidate could defeat Hillary Clinton in the general election.
A national poll by CNN/ORC released on September 20, in the wake of the second Republican debate held at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, revealed that Walker&#x27;s popularity among likely Republican voters had dropped to less than half of 1 percent.

On September 21, 2015, Walker suspended his campaign and asked other candidates to do the same, so that the party could rally around a conservative alternative to Donald Trump. Once considered a front-runner for the Republican nomination, Walker&#x27;s campaign suffered from two lackluster debate performances, low fundraising and an inability to raise his profile among the 16 other GOP contenders.

On March 29, 2016, Walker endorsed the candidacy of Ted Cruz. After Donald Trump became the presumptive nominee for the Republican Party in May 2016, Walker stated that he would support Trump as the Republican nominee, saying that Trump would make a better president than Hillary Clinton. Walker withdrew his support for Trump on June 8, 2016, after Trump called the judge Gonzalo P. Curiel biased against Trump because of Curiel&#x27;s Mexican heritage. While still maintaining that Trump would be better choice than Clinton, Walker noted that Trump was not yet the party&#x27;s nominee and wanted Trump to renounce his comments on the judge before the 2016 Republican National Convention.

Walker also prepared then-Indiana governor and Republican vice-presidential nominee Mike Pence for his debate against Virginia senator and Democratic vice-presidential nominee Tim Kaine on October 4, 2016.

==After elected office==
In July 2019, Walker told the &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot; that he would become the president of Young America&#x27;s Foundation, a conservative student organization, in 2021. He also told the paper that the position would preclude his running for office in the next years which would rule out a Senate run or a return to the governorship in 2022.

On July 17, 2019, President Trump appointed Walker to the board of trustees of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in the Smithsonian Institution.

==Political positions==

===Abortion===
Throughout his life and career, Walker has opposed abortion. In 2010, Walker told the editorial board of the &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot; he opposed abortion, without exception for rape or incest. Regarding his stance on abortion, he has stated: &quot;I don&#x27;t apologize for that, but I don&#x27;t focus on that; I don&#x27;t obsess with it.&quot; In a TV ad during his 2014 campaign for re-election Walker identified as anti-abortion, and pointed to legislation he signed that leaves &quot;the final decision to a woman and her doctor&quot;. In August 2015, he criticized the notion that abortion is necessary to save the life of the mother in certain cases, calling it a &quot;false choice.&quot;

In an interview with the &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot; a few weeks before the November 2014 election, Walker declined to answer directly when asked if abortion should be prohibited after 20 weeks. In July 2015, Walker signed a state law banning abortion after 20 weeks, including in cases of rape or incest but excluding when immediate danger existed to the life of the mother.

===Criminal justice===
During his tenure in the state legislature, Walker campaigned on a &quot;tough-on-crime&quot; platform and sought to increase the length of criminal penalties by increasing mandatory minimums and by cutting parole possibilities. In 1996, he said, &quot;The time has come to keep violent criminals in prison for their full terms.&quot;

He advocated for privatization of prisons.

===Economy and budget===

As Governor of Wisconsin, Walker received the grade of B in 2012 and 2014 from the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, in their biennial Fiscal Policy Report Card on America&#x27;s Governors.

Wisconsin calls itself &quot;America&#x27;s Dairyland,&quot; with more dairy farms than any other state. In 2012, Walker instituted a program to encourage dairy farmers to dramatically increase production, which resulted in a supply glut and years of depressed prices. This had a crippling effect on the industry, leaving it vulnerable when in 2018 Canada, China and Mexico imposed tariffs on American farm exports in retaliation for tariffs imposed on them by President Donald Trump. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that by April 2019 Wisconsin dairy farmers were facing &quot;extinction.&quot;

===Education===
Walker moved to weaken tenure for professors at the University of Wisconsin System and to cut its funding, while offering authority to reduce spending. He recommended deleting parts of the system&#x27;s mission that contribute to the Wisconsin Idea. Parts of the mission proposed for deletion, such as the &quot;search for truth,&quot; were to be replaced with a directive &quot;to meet the state&#x27;s workforce needs.&quot; Walker later called the change a &quot;drafting error,&quot; but public records requests and litigation showed that Walker himself and his office were &quot;the driving force&quot; behind the changes. He supports the public funding of private schools and religious schools in the form of vouchers for students. He supports the increased availability of charter schools.

===Environment===
Walker signed a &quot;No Climate Tax&quot; pledge promising not to support any legislation that would raise taxes to combat climate change and has been a keynote speaker at the Heartland Institute, which promotes climate change denial. He proposed funding cuts for clean energy and other environmental programs. He has proposed giving many powers of the Environmental Protection Agency to the states. He opposed the Obama administration&#x27;s efforts to reduce carbon emissions.

===Foreign policy===
In 2015, Walker indicated that he favored providing arms to Ukraine to fight in the Russo-Ukrainian War.

In 2015, Walker stated in an interview with Charlie Sykes that if elected president, he would &quot;absolutely&quot; decide on his first day in office to &quot;cancel any Iranian deal the Obama administration makes,&quot; even if European allies which were also party to an agreement opted not to reimpose sanctions.

In 2015, while campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination, Walker faulted Obama for lack of strategy in dealing with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant group, and did not rule out sending U.S. troops to Syria to engage in ground combat with ISIL there. In February 2015, when asked about the war in Syria, Walker said that the U.S. should &quot;go beyond just aggressive air strikes. We have to look at other surgical methods. And ultimately, we have to be prepared to put boots on the ground if that&#x27;s what it takes.&quot;

In a 2015 interview, Walker said that &quot;the most significant foreign policy decision&quot; of his lifetime was President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s firing 11,000 striking air traffic controllers in 1981, saying: &quot;It sent a message not only across America, it sent a message around the world ... [that] we weren&#x27;t to be messed with.&quot;

In 2015, Walker opposed rapprochement in relations between the U.S. and Cuba.

===Guns===
Walker has supported gun rights. In July 2011, he signed a bill into law making Wisconsin the 49th concealed carry state in the United States, and on December 7 of that same year he signed the castle doctrine into law. In January and April 2015 speeches in Iowa, Walker included passing those laws among his accomplishments.

The NRA Political Victory Fund gave Walker a 100% ranking in 2014.

On June 24, 2015, Walker signed two bills into law, one which removed the state&#x27;s 48-hour waiting period for buying a gun and another which gave retired or off-duty police officers the legal right to carry concealed guns in public schools.

===Health care===
Walker opposes the Affordable Care Act (ACA or &quot;Obamacare&quot;) and has signed Wisconsin onto a lawsuit seeking to have the ACA rolled back (including provisions for preexisting conditions). He supported the Graham-Cassidy legislation to repeal the ACA; this repeal bill would have eliminated blanket protections for preexisting conditions. In 2018, Walker pledged to pass legislation to protect individuals with preexisting conditions in case the Affordable Care Act were repealed; according to PolitiFact, &quot;he hasn&#x27;t spelled out an alternative that would provide protections that Obamacare does.&quot; As Governor, he has blocked expansion of Medicaid in Wisconsin.

===Redistricting===

In Wisconsin, responsibility for redrawing legislative and congressional district lines rests with the legislature. The legislature is required to redraw legislative and congressional districts every 10 years based upon the results of the decennial federal census. The redistricting legislation after the 2010 Census was signed by Walker in August 2011 in a private ceremony to which no Democrats or news agencies were invited. As an outcome of legal action by Wisconsin Democrats, a panel of Federal judges found in 2016 that the Wisconsin Legislature&#x27;s 2011 redrawing of State Assembly districts to favor Republicans was an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. Walker has appeared on Fox News to defend the 2011 redistricting, but even that conservative-leaning forum has criticized his efforts.

===Immigration===

Walker has claimed that securing the American border with Mexico is &quot;our first priority&quot;. After that, undocumented immigrants in the United States could &quot;secure their citizenship&quot; but would have to &quot;get in the back of line&quot;, and wait like anyone else applying for citizenship. Walker says that he does not advocate deportation for all people in the country illegally, but he is not in favor of amnesty.

In a 2015 appearance on &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, Walker said proposals to build a wall along the Canada–United States border was &quot;a legitimate issue for us to look at.&quot;

Walker has stated that he would work to &quot;protect American workers&quot; by aligning his position with Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), who wrote in a &quot;Washington Post&quot; op-ed that legal immigration needs to be &quot;slowed&quot;.

===Role of government===

Walker wrote in an editorial in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that &quot;Like most Americans, I think government is too big and too expansive, but the government that is necessary should workand work well.&quot;

===Same-sex marriage===
Walker says he believes in &quot;marriage between one man and one woman&quot;. Walker voted for Wisconsin&#x27;s constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, both as a legislator and as a voter. In September 2014, Walker said he was defending the amendment. When the U.S. Supreme Court subsequently rejected the appeals of five states, including Wisconsin, in October 2014, allowing same-sex marriages to continue, Walker stated: &quot;I think it&#x27;s resolved.&quot; In April 2015, in New Hampshire, Walker stated that marriage is &quot;defined as between a man and a woman&quot;, and in Iowa said a federal constitutional amendment allowing states to define marriage was reasonable. Walker called the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; decision to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide a &quot;grave mistake&quot;.

===Unions===
Walker said public-union collective-bargaining rights frustrate balancing the state budget. Walker signed right-to-work legislation he said would contribute to economic growth. &quot;The Atlantic&quot; has written that &quot;anti-union politics&quot; have defined his tenure as governor and established him as a Republican presidential contender. &quot;Politico&quot; wrote that Walker initiated a 21st-century revival of anti-union legislation in upper Midwestern industrial states and that his &quot;fervent anti-union rhetoric and actions&quot; has helped his national reputation within the Republican Party.

===Youth rights===
On May 24, 2017, Walker signed a bill that allowed unaccompanied minors to attend concerts and other musical festivals where alcohol is being served. On June 21, 2017, he signed into law a bill that allowed 16- and 17-year-olds to work without parental permission.

==Personal life==

Walker and his wife, Tonette, have two sons, Alex and Matt.
The family attends Meadowbrook Church, a nondenominational, evangelical church in Wauwatosa, which is a daughter church of Elmbrook Church, in nearby Brookfield. Tonette Walker works in the development department for the American Lung Association.

During the summers of 2004 through 2009, as Milwaukee County Executive, Walker led a motorcycle tour called the &quot;Executive&#x27;s Ride&quot; through Wisconsin and parts of neighboring states. The ride was organized to attract people to Milwaukee County. Walker rides a 2003 Harley Davidson Road King.

In 2013, Walker published &quot;Unintimidated – A Governor&#x27;s Story and A Nation&#x27;s Challenge&quot;, co-written with Marc Thiessen, about his experiences during the recall vote and subsequent election, both of which he won.

<text>The Japanese in Hawaii (simply Japanese Hawaiians or “Local Japanese”, rarely Kepanī) are the second largest ethnic group in Hawaii. At their height in 1920, they constituted 43% of Hawaii&#x27;s population. They now number about 16.7% of the islands&#x27; population, according to the 2000 U.S. Census. The U.S. Census categorizes mixed-race individuals separately, so the proportion of people with some Japanese ancestry is likely much larger.

== History ==

=== Final voyage of the &quot;Inawaka-maru&quot; ===
The earliest known Japanese people in the Kingdom of Hawaii were the survivors of the ill-fated ship &quot;Inawaka-maru&quot;, who arrived on May 5, 1806. They had been adrift aboard their disabled ship for more than seventy days.

The &quot;Inawaka-maru&quot;, a small cargo ship built in 1798 in Osaka, was owned by Mansuke Motoya. The &quot;Inawaka-maru&quot; started its final voyage from Hiroshima to Edo (modern Tokyo) on November 7, 1805. The ship had been chartered by the Kikkawa clan to deliver mats, horse feed, and two passengers, Kikkawa officials. Her crew consisted of Captain Niinaya Ginzo, Master Ichiko Sadagoro, Sailors Hirahara Zenmatsu, Akazaki Matsujiro, Yumori Kasoji, and Wasazo, a total of eight aboard. The &quot;Inawaka-maru&quot; had to turn back, and restarted her journey on November 27. She arrived in Edo on December 21, started back to her home port stopping in Kanagawa, Uraga, and Shimoda, and left on her final leg – from Shimoda across the Enshū Sea – on January 6, 1806.

The &quot;Inawaka-maru&quot; was caught by a snowstorm that turned to rain and winds battered the ship eastward into the Pacific Ocean. On January 7 the crew cut down the mast because of the strong winds. On January 11 two rocky islands were sighted but no attempt was made toward them. These would be the last land before the Hawaiian Islands. On January 20 the water stores were empty, but the men collected rain water to survive. On February 28 the rice provisions ran out. On March 15 a flying fish landed in the ship and the men fished to sustain themselves. On March 20 the &quot;Tabour&quot;, an American ship Captained by Cornelius Sole, rescued the men of the &quot;Inawaka-maru&quot;. He found them begging for food by gesturing to their stomachs, mouths and bowing, found the galley empty, and understood their ordeal. He had the possessions of the survivors brought aboard his ship and salvaged parts and items aboard &quot;Inawaka-maru&quot;. Captain Sole had the survivors fed, over a span of five days, small portions to a progression to three normal meals a day, the remedy for starvation. On May 5, 1806, the &quot;Tabour&quot; docked in Oahu, Hawaii. Captain Sole left the eight Japanese in the care of King Kamehameha I. Captain Sole also left the anchor of the &quot;Inawaka-maru&quot;, 40 axes, and other items as payment for the Kingdom&#x27;s hospitality.

The King delegated the responsibility for the Japanese to Kalanimoku who had 50 men construct a house on May 6 for the Japanese. It took four days to build and a cook and two guards assigned to the house, which attracted crowds to these men of a different ethnicity. On August 17 the Japanese left Hawaii aboard the &quot;Perseverance&quot; to Macau on October 17. From there they took a Chinese ship to Jakarta on December 25. In Jakarta they fell ill and five died there or on the voyage to Nagasaki where they arrived on June 17, 1807, where another died. At the time of the Sakoku it was illegal to leave Japan and the remaining two survivors were jailed and interrogated. One committed suicide and the remaining survivor Hirahara Zenmatsu eventually made it home November 29, 1807 but was summoned by Asano Narikata, The Daimyō of Hiroshima, to recount his odyssey of an experience titled &quot;Iban Hyoryu Kikokuroku Zenmatsu&quot;. Hirahara Zenmatsu died six months later.

===Gannenmono===
In 1866, Eugene Miller Van Reed, a Dutch American, went to Japan as a representative of the Hawaiian Kingdom. He failed to establish a formal Hawaii-Japan relationship, but continued to stay there as a merchant and obtained a permission of Japanese emigration from the Edo Shogunate. As he started recruiting, the new Meiji Government that came into power in 1867, the first year of the Meiji period, nullified all the Edo Shogunate&#x27;s treaties. (One of the reasons of the new government&#x27;s rejection is said to be the rumor that Van Reed was engaged in slave trade. For example, Korekiyo Takahashi, whose study in the U.S. was arranged by Van Reed, ended up being sold by the host family as a slave, but managed to get back to Japan, and eventually became the 20th Prime Minister.) Van Reed, however, proceeded without the new government&#x27;s permission to send 153 Japanese to Hawaii to work on the sugar plantations. They sailed from Yokohama to Honolulu from May 17 to June 19, 1868, on the &quot;Scioto&quot;. This first official group of Japanese immigrants were called the Gannenmono (), meaning the &quot;people of the first year (of the Meiji period)&quot;, and the 150th anniversary of their arrival was celebrated in Hawaii in 2018.

There were 142 men and 6 women in this initial group, so many of them married Hawaiians after they arrived in Hawaii. They worked on sugar plantations on Oahu, Maui, Kauai, and Lanai. Two or three months after arriving, many complained of contract violations since the working conditions and pay did not match with what they were promised. At least four of the six women and 50 men returned to Japan in 1870. Seven had died before their contracts ended. Among the Gannenmono were several people who would become legends among the Japanese Americans in Hawaii: Tomitarō Makino from Miyagi, the leader of the group; the youngest Ichigorō Ishimura, 13 years old; Sentarō Ishii, a samurai from Okayama, who was 102 years old when he died in Maui; Tokujirō &quot;Toko&quot; Satō from Tokyo, who lived in Waipio Valley with his Hawaiian wife, Clara; and Tarō Andō, who would become Japan&#x27;s first consul general to the Kingdom of Hawaii.

===Subsequent immigration===
Between 1869 and 1885 Japan barred emigration to Hawaii in fear that Japanese laborers would be degrading to the reputation of the Japanese race. In 1881 King David Kalākaua visited Japan to strengthen relations between the two nations. Kalākaua offered not to request extraterritoriality of Japan, an act that departed from the norm of western nations. On March 10 Kalakaua met Meiji to propose a marriage between Princess Victoria Kaiulani and Prince Higashifushimi Yorihito. A few days later the proposal was denied, but the ban on immigration was eventually lifted in 1885. The first 153 Japanese immigrants arrived in Hawaii on February 8, 1885, as contract laborers for the sugarcane and pineapple plantations. Many more Japanese immigrants came to Hawaii in the following years. Most of these migrants came from southern Japan (Hiroshima, Yamaguchi, Kumamoto, etc.) due to crop failures in the region.

=== Okinawan immigration ===

In 1900, the first group of Okinawan laborers arrived in Hawaii after Japan lifted its emigration ban on Okinawa Prefecture. These laborers were helped by Kyuzo Toyama, who is considered to be the &quot;father of Okinawan emigration&quot;. Kyuzo Toyama himself led the second group of Okinawans, who arrived on 1903. By 1920, nearly 20,000 Okinawans and their descendants lived in Hawaii. Today, Okinawans in Hawaii form a distinct community from the Japanese in Hawaii due to cultural and linguistic differences.

===Annexation of Hawaii by the United States===

The political environment shifted with the onset of a new era known as the Hawaiian Revolutions. In 1887 the settlers ended absolute rule by the king by forcing him to accept the Bayonet Constitution and agreeing to constitutional government with a powerful parliament. The new constitution gave voting rights only for Hawaiians, Americans, and Europeans, and thus denied rights for Japanese and other Asians. The Japanese commissioner worked to pressure the Kingdom to restore the rights of Japanese by amending the constitution. In 1893 the Hawaiian Monarchy was overthrown, Tokyo responded by appointing Captain Tōgō Heihachirō to command the Japanese naval activities in Hawaii. The &quot;Naniwa&quot; was sent immediately to Hawaii to rendezvous with the &quot;Kongō&quot; which had been on a training mission.

Captain Tōgō had previously been a guest of Kalākaua, and returned to Hawaii to denounce the overthrow of Queen Lydia Liliʻuokalani, sister and successor to the late king and conduct “gunboat diplomacy”. Tōgō refused to salute the Provisional Government by not flying the flag of the Republic. He refused to recognize the new regime, encouraged the British ship to do the same and protested the overthrow. The Japanese commissioner eventually stopped Tōgō from continuing his protest, believing it would undo his work at restoring rights to Japanese. Katō Kanji wrote in hindsight that he had regretted they had not protested harder and should have recruited the British in the protest.

The continued presence of the Japanese Navy and Japan&#x27;s opposition to the overthrow led to a concern that Japan might use military force to restore Liliʻuokalani to her throne as a Japanese puppet. Anti-Japanese sentiment heightened.

After April 30, 1900, all children born in Hawaii were American citizens at birth. () Most of the Japanese children had dual citizenship after their parents registered them. The Japanese settlers set up the first Japanese schools in the United States. By 1920, 98% of all Japanese children in Hawaii attended Japanese schools. Statistics for 1934 showed 183 schools taught a total of 41,192 students. Today, Japanese schools in Hawaii operate as supplementary education (usually on Friday nights or Saturday mornings) which is on top of the compulsory education required by the state.

Today, where Nikkei are about one-fifth of the whole population, Japanese is a major language, spoken and studied by many of the state&#x27;s residents across ethnicities. It is taught in private Japanese-language schools as early as the second grade. The Hawaii media market has a few locally produced Japanese-language newspapers and magazines; however, these are on the verge of dying out, due to a lack of interest on the part of the local (Hawaii-born) Japanese population. Stores that cater to the tourist industry often have Japanese-speaking personnel. To show their allegiance to the U.S., many Nisei and Sansei intentionally avoided learning Japanese.

=== Japanese Tourism in Hawaii ===
Hawaii was an attractive dream destination to Japanese people for over a century, but the tourism boom began in 1964. As Japan opened for travel abroad, huge numbers of Japanese citizens began to visit Hawaii. Due to the large percentage of people of Japanese descent living there, it provides familiar comfort while retaining the image of a foreign paradise. The concept of &quot;amae&quot; describes the feeling of safety and dependence on others present in the Japanese tourists&#x27; image of Hawaii. In addition to the familiarity of sharing Japanese heritage, as a courtesy to the large number of Japanese tourists, Japanese subtexts are provided on place signs, public transportation, and civic facilities.

Visitors from Japan make up such a large portion of tourists in Hawaii that at its highest point, Japanese tourists constituted up to one third of the total visitors. In addition, Japanese tourist tend to spend more than other tourists, such as those from the mainland United States. They are often returning visitors, and the Japanese concept of &quot;omiyage&quot; presents a social expectation to purchase and bring back gifts from traveling. Overall, Japanese tourists are an important segment of Hawaii&#x27;s tourism industry, which makes up 21% of the state&#x27;s economy.

==Education==

In 1962, there were 83 educational institutions in Hawaii which taught Japanese.

There is a supplementary Japanese school with recognition from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), The Hawaii Japanese School – Rainbow Gakuen (ハワイレインボー学園 &quot;Hawai Rainbō Gakuen&quot;) in Honolulu. This school caters to families with Japanese citizenship. It was first established in 1974.

<text>Live Licks is a 2004 double CD by the Rolling Stones, their ninth official live album. Coming six years after &quot;No Security&quot;, it features performances from the 2002–2003 Licks Tour in support of the career-spanning, fortieth anniversary retrospective &quot;Forty Licks&quot;. The album includes &quot;an entire side of songs never before recorded live&quot;, and features only one song recorded after 1981&#x27;s &quot;Tattoo You&quot; (&quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Mean It&quot; from &quot;Bridges to Babylon&quot;).

==History==
The first CD contains &quot;the familiar classics&quot; while the second features &quot;some covers, b-sides and album tracks from the more obscure end of their back catalogue&quot;.

Sheryl Crow appears on &quot;Honky Tonk Women&quot;, while Solomon Burke sings on his own &quot;Everybody Needs Somebody to Love&quot;, which the Rolling Stones originally covered on &quot;The Rolling Stones No. 2&quot; in 1965.

The Rolling Stones released two subtly different versions of cover art for &quot;Live Licks&quot;. While both feature a woman astride the Rolling Stones logo&#x27;s tongue, in the British version she has no bikini top.

Unlike all their previous live albums, &quot;Live Licks&quot; features virtually none of the band&#x27;s recent compositions, and includes only one track which was released in the preceding two decades. In all there are nine songs from the 1960s, eight from the 1970s, three from the 1980s (all from &quot;Tattoo You&quot;), one from the 1997 release &quot;Bridges to Babylon&quot;, and two previously unreleased covers.

==Reception==
&quot;Live Licks&quot; peaked at No. 38 in the UK Albums Chart, and No. 50 in the US, becoming a gold record on 9 December 2004, according to the RIAA.[ʌ3]

The BBC suggested that &quot;even for cynics it demonstrates how potent they remain as a live act, despite not frightening the horses as much these days&quot;. It concluded that, &quot;[like] Bowie, the Stones may no longer be churning out hits but they still know how to mount a spectacle, as this release amply proves.&quot;

David Fricke wrote that &quot;&quot;Live Licks&quot; is the Stones&#x27; first live album since &quot;Ya-Ya’s&quot; to earn a spot next to my best soundboard and broadcast boots. One good reason: a bright, hard mix that nails the Stones&#x27; matured vigor onstage&quot;.

<doc id="1339469" wikidata="Q1370411" url="?curid=1339469" title="Neil Kilkenny">
<text>Neil Martin Kilkenny (born 19 December 1985) is a professional footballer who plays for Football West State League Division 1 side Sorrento. A midfielder, he began his career in the youth system at Arsenal, and went on to play league football for Oldham Athletic, Birmingham City, Leeds United, Bristol City, Preston North End, Melbourne City, Perth Glory and Western United.

Kilkenny was born in England, has Irish grandparents, and was raised in Australia. He played youth international football for both England and Ireland before committing to Australia. He has 15 caps for Australia, and competed for the country at the 2008 Olympics.

==Early life and career==
Born in Enfield, London, Kilkenny moved to Australia with his family at the age of four, and grew up in Brisbane. A promising schoolboy footballer, he captained the Queensland schools&#x27; representative team. When Kilkenny was eleven, the family returned to England to maximise his chances of making a career in the game. At twelve, he was invited to join Arsenal&#x27;s youth development scheme, and while a student at Ravenscroft School, Barnet, he played for Middlesex Schools and appeared for Arsenal&#x27;s under-17 team. In July 2002 he began a two-year scholarship programme in Arsenal&#x27;s Academy.

By the 2003–04 season, he had graduated to Arsenal&#x27;s under-19 team and once been an unused substitute for the reserves, and had played international football for Republic of Ireland under-19s, qualifying via grandparents from Sligo, and for England under-18s. However, he became unhappy at Arsenal, chose to leave the club, and after trials with clubs including Aston Villa, Manchester City and Leicester City, he joined Birmingham City on a free transfer in January 2004.

==Club career==

===Birmingham City and loans===
Kilkenny signed a two-and-a-half-year contract with Birmingham. The club&#x27;s academy director felt he had &quot;the ability to play at the highest level&quot;, and prioritised adding a &quot;work ethic and competitiveness&quot; to his &quot;great technique&quot;. The player travelled with the first team for the game at Charlton Athletic in April 2004, but was not included in the matchday squad. Perceived as not ready for the first team at Premier League level, he was loaned to League One club Oldham Athletic in November 2004 to gain first-team experience. He made his debut in the Football League as a second-half substitute in Oldham&#x27;s 3–2 win at home to Barnsley on 20 November, and scored two goals in his second game, a 3–1 win away to Bradford City, four days later. He played a full part in Oldham&#x27;s season: he took the free kick which led to the winning goal against Premier League Manchester City in the FA Cup, and ended up as winner of the club&#x27;s Players&#x27; Young Player of the Season award.

At the start of the 2005–06 season he became part of the Birmingham first-team squad, though manager Steve Bruce warned him that he would not easily find his way into the team. On 20 September 2005, he made his Birmingham first-team debut in the League Cup away at Scunthorpe United, as a 26th-minute substitute to replace the injured Muzzy Izzet. Four days later, with six other midfielders unavailable through injury or suspension, he made his full home debut against Liverpool in the Premier League, in which he was sent off late in the game for handling the ball on the goal-line, thus giving Liverpool a penalty and a 2–2 draw. Despite his dismissal, he received words of encouragement from teammates Mikael Forssell and Mario Melchiot for his performance, and went on to make 25 appearances in all competitions, mainly as substitute, as Birmingham were relegated to the Championship. The following season Kilkenny&#x27;s appearances were infrequent; he started only two games, both in the League Cup. The player became frustrated; while part of the first-team squad, he was rarely part of the first team, yet Bruce was reluctant to allow him out on loan.

It was announced on 30 July 2007 that Kilkenny would again join Oldham on loan until January 2008. The move was blocked following the collapse of Birmingham&#x27;s purchase of Hossam Ghaly, but was confirmed a few days later. His last match before he returned to Birmingham was an influential performance as Oldham beat Leeds United 3–1 to become the first team that season to win a League game at Elland Road.

===Leeds United===
====2007–08 season====
On 4 January 2008 Kilkenny signed for League One team Leeds United on an emergency loan, with a view to ensuring his availability for the next day&#x27;s game prior to completing a permanent transfer the following week. He made his debut in the 3–0 win over Northampton Town, putting in an impressive performance to get the man of the match award. Kilkenny signed a three-and-a-half-year permanent contract with Leeds on 7 January for a fee of £150,000. He scored his first goal for the club in their 2–0 win against AFC Bournemouth in March. Leeds went on to reach the play-off final that season but lost 1–0 against Doncaster Rovers. He was then called up to the Australian Olympic team during the summer and missed all of pre-season training for Leeds as a result.

====2008–09 season====
After a period out of the team and the sacking of Gary McAllister Kilkenny regained a spot in the Leeds midfield under the stewardship of new manager Simon Grayson late in the 2008–09 season.

His 43rd-minute goal against Yeovil Town on 10 March 2009 was a leading contender for the goal of the season. He followed this up with goals in the 3–2 win against Crewe Alexandra and the 3–1 win against Tranmere Rovers. Kilkenny was part of the Leeds team who were knocked out of the play-off semi-final by Millwall; he injured an ankle and was substituted in the first half of the second leg at Elland Road.

====2009–10 season====
Doncaster made their interest in signing Kilkenny public during the summer but Grayson made it clear that he was not for sale. After again missing pre-season, this time because of ankle trouble, Kilkenny found himself trying to regain fitness and a place on the bench once the season was in full flow. With seven substitutes required for the 2009–10 season, he was used mainly as an impact substitute in the early part of the season.

Kilkenny started his first league game of the season in the top-of-the-table goalless draw with Charlton Athletic and also started the next game in the Football League Trophy win against Darlington. He scored his first goal of the season for Leeds in the 3–1 win against Grimsby Town in the Trophy, &quot;[playing] a give-and-go with Jermaine Beckford before tucking the ball into the far corner&quot;. Kilkenny also received the man of the match award in the same game. He scored in his next match, against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, as well as providing an assist for Beckford, and made it three in five when he scored against his former club Oldham. Kilkenny&#x27;s fourth goal of the season came in December, with a rare header against Accrington Stanley. A few days later he provided yet another assist when he set up Beckford&#x27;s first goal against Hartlepool United.

Kilkenny played against Manchester United when Leeds won 1–0 away at Old Trafford on 3 January in the FA Cup. He was at the heart of Leeds&#x27; midfield in the 2–2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur in the next round of the FA Cup. He missed the cup replay through injury, and returned to the bench against Carlisle United in the Football League Trophy Northern Final second leg. He came on as a second-half substitute and helped Leeds win the match 3–2, making the score 4–4 on aggregate. The match went to penalties: Kilkenny converted his kick but Leeds lost 6–5.

Kilkenny came back into the starting line-up for the next game against Leyton Orient after fully recovering from his injury. By the time Leeds equalised, via a 95th-minute own goal, Kilkenny had been substituted. He played an instrumental part as Leeds were promoted to the Football League Championship after finishing second in League One and thus earning automatic promotion.

====2010–11 season====
Kilkenny scored his first goal of the 2010–11 season with a penalty in the League Cup match against Lincoln City. He made several assists for Leeds in the first few weeks of the season, including two, for Jonny Howson and Davide Somma, in Leeds&#x27; 5–2 defeat against Barnsley. After being ever-present for Leeds, Kilkenny was named on the bench for the game against Sheffield United. In November, Kilkenny entered negotiations with Leeds over extending his contract amid interest from other clubs.

Kilkenny said in December that he was keen to sign a new contract with Leeds. Kilkenny was named in Australia&#x27;s final 23-man squad for the 2011 Asian Cup in January 2011, so would miss a month of Leeds&#x27; season; he said he was &quot;gutted&quot; to be missing the FA Cup tie against his old club Arsenal.

In January he repeated his desire to stay with Leeds, He returned from international duty to be named on the bench against Hull City. He scored his first league goal of the season with a &quot;spectacular 20-yard shot&quot; against Preston North End. At the end of the season, it became clear that club and player were unlikely to agree terms on a new contract, and on 26 May, manager Simon Grayson said that neither Kilkenny nor his agent had responded to the club&#x27;s offer and he was &quot;keen to move on&quot; in terms of planning for next season. Kilkenny said that despite speculation linking him with a move to the Australian A-League, he wanted &quot;to play at the highest level and that&#x27;s in Europe&quot;.

===Bristol City===
On 16 June 2011, Kilkenny showed an interest in moving to Leeds&#x27; Yorkshire rivals Hull City. On 24 June, he signed for fellow Championship team Bristol City on a three-year contract after turning down offers from Leeds and from other Championship clubs. Ahead of his return to Elland Road with Bristol City on 17 September, he told the &quot;Yorkshire Evening Post&quot; he had never wanted to leave the club, and in response to Leeds&#x27; chairman Ken Bates&#x27; comment that &quot;Kilkenny wanted to leave for a big club and ended up at Bristol City&quot;, he felt that Bates &quot;has always got something to say and sometimes he needs to keep quiet.&quot; Kilkenny scored his first goal for Bristol City in that match.

On 29 March 2013, Kilkenny reached his 250th career league appearance with Bristol City against Derby County.

===Preston North End===

Kilkenny joined Preston North End on 14 November 2013 on an initial one-month loan. On 6 January 2014, he signed for the club permanently until the end of the season. Kilkenny played the whole match as Preston beat Swindon Town in the 2015 League One play-off final to gain promotion to the Championship.

He was released at the end of the 2015–16 season.

===Melbourne City===
On 19 July 2016, Kilkenny joined A-League club Melbourne City on a two-year deal. He made his first appearance in a City shirt in a 5–0 friendly match win over Port Melbourne SC on 20 July 2016.

Kilkenny&#x27;s performances over the season earned him Melbourne City&#x27;s Player of the Year award for 2016–17.

In January 2018, Melbourne City released Kilkenny.

===Perth Glory===
A couple of days after being released by Melbourne City, Kilkenny joined Perth Glory. On 24 February, Kilkenny scored his first goal for Perth Glory in a 2–1 victory against his former team, Melbourne City.

Kilkenny spent seasons at Perth Glory, before being released at the end of the 2020–21 season.

===Western United===
Having been released by Perth Glory, Kilkenny joined Western United ahead of the 2021–22 season. Kilkenny spent two seasons at Western United before departing at the end of the 2022–23 season, to return to Perth to play for Perth Division 1 side Sorrento.

==International career==
Kilkenny, who was born in England with Irish grandparents, moved to Australia at a young age and grew up there, so was eligible to play internationally for Australia, England and the Republic of Ireland. He played for Ireland at under-19 level and for England under-20s, but shortly before the 2006 World Cup he committed to Australia. He was among a group of young players, selected by manager Guus Hiddink, who trained with the Australian squad in Germany prior to the tournament, and made his international debut on 7 June 2006, coming on as a late substitute in their 3–1 victory in a World Cup warm-up game against Liechtenstein in Ulm, Germany.

In 2007, he was a part of the Australian Olyroos for the 2008 Beijing Olympics qualifying campaign. In June 2008 he was one of 33 players called up for a pre-Olympic training camp prior to selection of the final 18-man squad. He was included in the final 18-man squad and played one game in the Olympics for Australia, who were knocked out in the group stages. After Leeds&#x27; FA Cup win over Manchester United put Kilkenny back on the international radar, Australia sent scouts to watch him as a possibility for the 2010 World Cup squad, but manager Pim Verbeek did not select him.

In December 2010, Kilkenny was selected in Australia&#x27;s 23-man squad for the 2011 Asian Cup. Kilkenny came on as a second-half substitute against United Arab Emirates in a warm-up game for the Asian Cup. He played his first game in the Asian Cup when he came on as a second-half substitute against Bahrain. In the quarter-final match, against reigning champions Iraq, Kilkenny made an appearance in the 109th minute, during a 1–0 win. He was a late substitute in the final, which Australia lost 1–0 to Japan after extra time.

Kilkenny played for Australia in the 3–0 win over New Zealand and goalless draw with Serbia in June 2011.

==Personal life==
He has four children with his English girlfriend Caprice. His brothers, Gary and Paul Kilkenny supported him very much growing up along with his father and mother. Brian and Janet Kilkenny. Kilkenny is himself a fan of his former side Arsenal but holds an affinity with Leeds United, the team he made the majority of his career appearances with.

In October 2024, Kilkenny joined Football West as their Football Development Officer, overseeing a new academy in partnership with Football Australia.

<text>Boris Thomashefsky (, sometimes written Thomashevsky, Thomaschevsky, etc.; ) (1868–July 9, 1939), born Boruch-Aharon Thomashefsky, was a Ukrainian-born (later American) Jewish singer and actor who became one of the biggest stars in Yiddish theater.
== Early life ==
He was born Boruch-Aharon Thomashefsky in (; ), a village in the Chyhyryn county of the Kiev Governorate of the Russian Empire (today in the Kirovohrad Oblast, Ukraine). He grew up in the nearby town of Kamyanka (today in the Cherkasy Oblast, Ukraine), until, at the age of 11, he left for Berdychiv where he trained as a meshoyrer (choir singer) in the renowned synagogue choir of cantor Nisan Belzer.

In 1881, he emigrated with his family to the United States, and just a year later, while still a teenager, he was largely responsible for the first performance of Yiddish theater in New York City, in what was to become the Yiddish Theater District. He has been credited as the pioneer of Borscht Belt entertainment.

Although Thomashefsky left Imperial Russia at a time when Yiddish theater was still thriving there (it was banned in September 1883), he had never seen it performed prior to the 1882 performance he brought together in New York. Thomashefsky, who was earning some money by singing on Saturdays at the Henry Street Synagogue on the Lower East Side, was also working as a cigarette maker in a sweatshop, where he first heard songs from the Yiddish theater, sung by some of his fellow workers.

== Career ==
Thomashefsky managed to convince a local tavern owner to invest in bringing over some performers. The first performance was Abraham Goldfaden&#x27;s Yiddish operetta (&quot;The Witch&quot;). The performance was a mild disaster: pious and prosperous &quot;uptown&quot; German Jews opposed to the Yiddish theater did a great deal to sabotage it. His performing career was launched in part due to an instance of this sabotage—bribing the &quot;soubrette&quot; to fake a sore throat: Thomashefsky went on in her place.

Shortly afterward, the teenage Thomashefsky was the pioneer of taking Yiddish theater &quot;on the road&quot; in the United States, performing Goldfaden&#x27;s plays in cities such as Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Boston and Chicago, all in the 1880s; for much of the 1880s, Chicago was his base. After Yiddish theater was banned in Russia, his tours came to include such prominent actors as Siegmund Mogulesko, David Kessler, and Jacob Adler, with new plays by playwrights such as Moses Ha-Levi Horowitz.

In 1887, playing in Baltimore, he met 14-year-old Bessie Baumfeld-Kaufman, when she came backstage to meet the beautiful young &quot;actress&quot; she had seen on stage, only to discover that &quot;she&quot; was Boris. Bessie soon ran away from home to join the company, and eventually took over the &quot;ingenue&quot; roles, as Boris moved on to romantic male leads. They married in 1891.

In 1891, with Mogulesko, Kessler, and Adler all engaged in starting the Union Theater, Moishe Finkel brought the still relatively unknown Thomashefsky back to New York to star at his National Theater, where Thomashefsky became enough of a success in Moses Halevy Horowitz&#x27;s operetta &quot;David ben Jesse&quot; as to force the Union Theater temporarily to abandon its highbrow programming and compete head on.

After Adler recruited Jacob Gordin as a playwright and found a way to draw the masses to serious theater with Gordin&#x27;s &quot;The Yiddish King Lear&quot;, and then turned to Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot;, Thomashefsky decided to show that he could compete on that ground as well, and responded with the first Yiddish production of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, in which, by all reports, he acquitted himself excellently. His production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; was more than just a direct translation; the story was also adapted to make it more accessible to a devout European Jewish audience. At the start of the play, young Hamlet has been away at Rabbinical college, and his uncle has seduced the Queen Mother away from King Hamlet, breaking the old man&#x27;s heart. There are sectarian jokes regarding communication with angels. Claudius spreads a rumor that Prince Hamlet has succumbed to nihilism while away, but his scheme is discovered and the traitor is sent to Siberia in his nephew&#x27;s stead. The play ends early, with Hamlet ceremonially marrying Ophelia at her funeral then dying of a broken heart. These types of edits were not uncommon in the Yiddish-language theatre scene. Some critics view it as a step away from immigrant assimilation, others as one step further towards common ground between the new residents and their American neighbors. These productions ushered in what is generally seen as the first great age of Yiddish theater, centered in New York and lasting approximately until a new wave of Jewish immigration in 1905—08 once again resulted in a vogue for broad comedy, vaudeville and light operettas, which the Thomashefskys embraced wholeheartedly, especially in performing Leon Kobrin&#x27;s plays about immigrant life.

Other notable Thomashefsky productions included Yiddish versions of &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; and, unlikely as it may seem, Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Parsifal&quot;.

According to the Jewish Virtual Library, in an adaptation of &quot;Hamlet&quot; called &quot;Der Yeshiva Bokher&quot; (&quot;The Yeshiva Student&quot;), &quot;a wicked uncle smears [a] rabbinic candidate’s reputation by calling him a nihilist and the young man dies of a broken heart.&quot; (They don&#x27;t say whether this was the production that went head-to-head with the Adler/Kessler &quot;Othello&quot;.)

By 1910, Thomashefsky owned a 12-room home on Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn, plus a bungalow by the sea, and 20 acres (81,000 m2) in Hunter, New York, which included an open-air theater, Thomashefsky&#x27;s Paradise Gardens. Each of his three sons had an Arabian horse.

However, in 1915, Thomashefsky filed for bankruptcy, listing assets of $21,900 and debts of $76,297.65.

In 1935, late in his career, Thomashefsky was an actor/singer in Henry Lynn&#x27;s Yiddish film &quot;Bar Mitzvah&quot;, in which he played a melodramatic role with gusto and co-produced the film. He sang, &quot;Erlekh Zayn&quot; (Be Virtuous), a song from a 1924 Yiddish play, &quot;Bar Mitzvah&quot;.

== Personal life ==
With his wife, actress Bessie Thomashefsky, he had three sons, as well a daughter who died when she was six years old. The third son, Theodore, changed his name to Ted Thomas and became a stage manager. One of Ted Thomas&#x27;s sons is conductor Michael Tilson Thomas. The first son, Harry, went on to direct the film &quot;The Yiddish King Lear&quot; (1935), under the auspices of the Federal Theatre Project, and later moved with his mother to Los Angeles. The second son, Mickey, had affairs with two women at the same time, which led to a dramatic murder-attempt/suicide in 1931, reminiscent of his aunt Emma Thomashefsky Finkel&#x27;s notorious 1904 affair. Both Mickey and his Aunt Emma were left paralyzed by the attempted murders by jealous mates and both later died of complications related to their wounds; Emma, many years later, in 1929, and Mickey, five years after in 1936. Boris Thomashefsky carried on a long-term affair with Yiddish actress Regina Zuckerberg, an Austrian-born actress twenty years younger than Bessie. This caused Boris and Bessie to separate. Both went on to have successful but separate careers. However, Boris became a pauper in the 1930s.

== Death and legacy ==
Thomashefsky is buried with his wife, who, although separated from him by 1911, never divorced him, in the Yiddish theater section of the Mount Hebron Cemetery, Flushing, Queens, New York.

Both Thomashefskys did much to shape the world of modern theatre from the follies to Broadway and gave a start to many actors, composers and producers who went on to start and own theaters and movie studios. Even the Gershwin brothers had their start with the Thomashefkys. They were also prominent in addressing controversial social issues of the day and in teaching the Greenhorns how to be Americans. They not only founded theaters and production companies, but had publishing houses and many other successful business adventures. Boris Thomashefsky even founded and funded a Jewish Army which he sent to Israel and was named after him. The unit later became a unit in the British Army.

In the Marx Brothers film , &quot;Monkey Business&quot; (1931), ,Groucho Marx (in defending his right to hide in a gangster&#x27;s moll&#x27;s closet) exclaims, &quot;That&#x27;s what they said to Thomas Edison, mighty inventor, Thomas Lindbergh, mighty flyer, and Thomashefsky, &#x27;mighty lak a rose&#x27;!&quot; Tribute was also paid in Mel Brooks&#x27; stage and film musicals based on his 1968 film &quot;The Producers&quot;, when Max Bialystock attributes his acumen as a Broadway producer to the tutelage of &quot;the great Boris Thomashefsky&quot; in the song &quot;The King of Broadway&quot;.

In 2011, Shuler Hensley portrayed Boris Thomashefsky in &quot;The Thomashefskys: Music and Memories of a Life in the Yiddish Theater&quot;, a concert stage show celebrating the Thomashefskys and the music of American Yiddish theatre hosted by their grandson the conductor Michael Tilson Thomas. The show aired on the PBS series &quot;Great Performances&quot; in 2012.

<doc id="1339476" wikidata="Q920564" url="?curid=1339476" title="Giovanni Croce">
<text>Giovanni Croce (; also Ioanne a Cruce Clodiensis, Zuanne Chiozotto; 1557 – 15 May 1609) was an Italian composer of the late Renaissance, of the Venetian School. He was particularly prominent as a madrigalist, one of the few among the Venetians other than Monteverdi and Andrea Gabrieli.

== Life ==

He was born in Chioggia, a fishing town on the Adriatic coast south of Venice, the same town as Gioseffo Zarlino, and he came to Venice early, becoming a member of the boy&#x27;s choir at St. Mark&#x27;s under Zarlino&#x27;s direction by the time he was eight years old. Zarlino evidently found him in a choir in Chioggia Cathedral, and recruited him for St. Mark&#x27;s. Croce may have been a parish priest at the church of Santa Maria Formosa, and he took holy orders in 1585; during this period he also served as a singer at St. Mark&#x27;s. He evidently maintained some connection, probably as a director of music, with Santa Maria Formosa alongside his duties at St. Mark&#x27;s.

After the death of Zarlino, he became assistant &quot;maestro di cappella&quot;; this was during the tenure of Baldassare Donato. When Donato died in 1603 Croce took over the principal job as &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; but the singing standards of the famous St. Mark&#x27;s cathedral declined under his direction, most likely due more to his declining health than his lack of musicianship. He died in 1609; the position of &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; went to Giulio Cesare Martinengo until 1613, at which time Monteverdi took the job.

== Music and influence ==
Croce wrote less music in the grand polychoral style than Andrea and Giovanni Gabrieli, although he left a grand mass for four choirs, composed for Ferdinand of Austria (the future Emperor Ferdinand II) and several triple-choir Psalm settings (only one of which has survived), and as a result his music has not maintained the same fame to the present day; however he was renowned as a composer at the time, and had a large influence on music both in Italy and abroad. As a composer of sacred music he was mostly conservative, writing &quot;cori spezzati&quot; in the manner of Adrian Willaert, and parody masses more like the music composed by the members of the contemporary Roman School. However, later in his career he wrote some music in a forward-looking concertato style, which attempted to combine the innovations of Viadana with the grand Venetian polychoral manner. This posthumous collection, the &quot;Sacre Cantilene Concertate&quot; of 1610, is for 3, 5 or 6 solo voices, continuo and a 4-voice Ripieno which can be multiplied ad lib (presumably in different parts of the church). Most of Croce&#x27;s sacred music is for double-choir: this includes three masses, two books of motets, and sets of music for Terce, Lauds and Vespers. Although most of his sacred music was written for the professional singers of St Mark&#x27;s (including several pieces written for their participation in a freelance company of musicians under Croce&#x27;s direction, who performed for the Scuole Grande of Venice) much of his music is technically simple: for that reason much of it, especially the secular music, has remained popular with amateurs. One collection, the motets for 4 voices of 1597, is clearly designed for less ambitious church choirs.

Croce is also credited with the first published continuo parts, many of his double-choir collections being issued either with a &#x27;Basso per sonare nell&#x27;organo&#x27; or a &#x27;Partidura&#x27; (or Spartidura) which indicated both choirs.

Stylistically, Croce was more influenced by Andrea Gabrieli than his nephew Giovanni, even though they were exact contemporaries; Croce preferred the emotional coolness, the Palestrinian clarity and the generally lighter character of Andrea&#x27;s music. Croce was particularly important in the development of the canzonetta and the madrigal comedy, and wrote a large quantity of easily singable, popular, and often hilarious music. Some of his collections are satirical, for example setting to music ridiculous scenes at Venetian carnivals (&quot;Mascarate piacevoli et ridicolose per il carnevale&quot;, 1590), some of which are in dialect.

Croce was one of the first composers to use the term capriccio, as a title for one of the canzonettas in his collection &quot;Triaca musicale&quot; (&quot;musical cure for animal bites&quot;) of 1595. Both this and the &quot;Mascarate piacevoli&quot; collections were intended to be sung in costumes and masks at Venetian carnivals.

His canzonettas and madrigals were influential in the Netherlands and in England, where they were reprinted in the second book of &quot;Musica transalpina&quot; (1597), one of the collections which inaugurated the mania for madrigal composition there. Croce&#x27;s music remained popular in England and Thomas Morley specifically singled him out as a master composer; indeed Croce may have been the biggest single influence on Morley. John Dowland visited him in Italy as well.

<text>Clyde Douglas &quot;Bulldog&quot; Turner (March 10, 1919 – October 30, 1998) was an American professional football player and coach in the National Football League (NFL). He was elected, as a player, to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1960 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1966. He was also selected in 1969 to the NFL 1940s All-Decade Team.

Turner played college football as a center at Hardin–Simmons University from 1937 to 1939 and was selected as a Little All-American in 1939. After being selected by the Chicago Bears in the first round of the 1940 NFL draft, he played professional football for the Bears, principally as a center on offense and linebacker on defense, for 13 years from 1940 to 1952. He was selected as a first-team All-Pro eight times (1940–1944, 1946–1948) and was a member of Bears teams that won NFL championships in 1940, 1941, 1943, and 1946.

After his playing career was over, Turner held assistant coaching positions with Baylor University (1953) and the Chicago Bears (1954–1957). He was the head coach of the New York Titans of the American Football League (AFL) during the 1962 AFL season.

==Early life==
Turner was born in Plains, Texas, in 1919, the son of Willie Lloyd Turner (1895–1973) and Ida Fay (Rushing) Turner (1893–1984). He attended Sweetwater High School in Sweetwater, Texas. He played high school football for Sweetwater High at age 15 in 1934.

==College career==
Turner enrolled at Hardin–Simmons University in Abilene, Texas, in 1936 at age 17. As a freshman, he weighed 172 pounds and &quot;showed no outward signs of developing into a football player.&quot; By the fall of his sophomore year, Turner had gained 18 pounds and won the job as the starting center on the Hardin–Simmons Cowboys football team. By his senior year, he had increased his weight to 235 pounds.

Early in his career at Hardin–Simmons, Turner and teammate A. J. Roy encouraged each other in practice sessions by referring to each other by nicknames. Turner was given the nickname &quot;Bulldog&quot;, and Roy was known as &quot;Tiger&quot;. Turner later recalled his college experience as follows: &quot;We got room, board and tuition, but we had to buy our own books and we were supposed to take care of two jobs. I had to sweep out the gym and wait tables, but I kind of farmed out the sweeping after a while. It was tough but I loved it. And the more I played, the more I liked the game.&quot;

In September 1938, Turner first gained national attention when Associated Press photographer Jimmy Laughead, playing off Turner&#x27;s strength and his background growing up in West Texas Hereford cattle country, took his picture posing with a 240-pound calf around his shoulders. Turner later recalled posing with the calf: &quot;That day about did me in. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever been so tired in my life.&quot;

Turner played center for Hardin–Simmons for three years, and during that time, the football team compiled records of 8–0–1 in 1937, 8–2 in 1938, 7–1–1 in 1939. At the end of the 1939 season, Turner was selected by the &quot;New York Sun&quot; as the first-team center on the 1939 College Football All-America Team. He was also named to the Associated Press &quot;Little All-America&quot; team. He played in post-season all-star games including the East–West Shrine Game on January 1, 1940, and the Chicago College All-Star Game on August 29, 1940.

==Professional playing career==
In December 1939, Turner was selected by the Chicago Bears with the seventh overall pick in the first round of the 1940 NFL draft. He was the only lineman selected in the first ten picks. In June 1940, Turner signed a three-year contract with the Bears.

While Turner was in college, he was the subject of recruitment efforts by George Richards, the owner of the Detroit Lions. An NFL investigation concluded that Richards had tampered with Turner by paying for Turner&#x27;s dental work, giving him $100, and advising him to announce publicly that he would not play professional football so as to dissuade other teams from drafting him. The NFL fined the Lions $5,000 for the violation.

As a rookie, Turner, at age 21, appeared in 11 games, nine of them as the starting center, for the 1940 Chicago Bears team that compiled an 8–3 record and defeated the Washington Redskins, 73–0, in the NFL Championship Game. In the championship game, Turner intercepted a Sammy Baugh pass and returned it 29 yards for a touchdown. At the end of the 1940 season, he was selected as a first-team All-Pro by the &quot;Chicago Herald-American&quot; and as a second-team All-Pro by the National Football League (NFL), United Press (UP), and International News Service (INS). He was one of only two rookies (Don Looney was the other) to receive All-Pro honors in 1940.

In 1941, Turner appeared in all 11 games, 10 as a starter, for the 1941 Bears that compiled a 10–1 and again won the NFL championship. Turner was selected as the All-Pro center, receiving first-team honors on the so-called &quot;official&quot; All-Pro team selected by a committee of professional football writers for the NFL, as well as All-Pro teams selected by the Associated Press (AP), UP, &quot;Collyer&#x27;s Eye&quot; (CE), the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; (NYDN), and the &quot;Chicago Herald American&quot;. The consensus selection of Turner as the NFL&#x27;s top center marked a transition from Mel Hein, who had been a consensus All-Pro at the position for the prior nine years. Turner was a unanimous All-Pro pick by the UP sports writers.

In 1942, Turner started all 11 games and helped the Bears win the NFL Western Division title with an 11–0 record, though the team lost to the Washington Redskins in the 1942 NFL Championship Game. Turner led the NFL with eight interceptions in 1942. He scored two touchdowns, one on an interception return and the other on a fumble recovery and return. At the end of the 1942 season, Turner was selected as the first-team center on the All-Pro team by the NFL, AP, INS, and NYDN. Jack Mahon of the INS wrote that Turner &quot;was in a class by himself at center this season.&quot; Though invited to play in the Pro Bowl, he was unable to do so due to a throat infection.

In 1943, Turner started all 10 games and helped the Bears win their third NFL championship in four years. He was selected as a first-team All-Pro by the AP, UP, INS, NYDN, and &quot;Pro Football Illustrated&quot; (PFI). He was a unanimous pick by the AP sports writers.

In 1944, Turner appeared in all 10 games for the Bears team that compiled a 6–3–1 record and finished in second place in the NFL Western Division. On December 3, 1944, Turner was shifted into the backfield late in a game against Card-Pitt; he had a 48-yard run for the only rushing touchdown of his career. He was selected as a first-team All-Pro by the AP, UP, INS, and NYDN. In his first five seasons with the Bears, he appeared in 58 consecutive games, played all 60 minutes in eight of those games, and won three NFL championships.
In January 1945, Turner was inducted into the United States Army Air Forces and was assigned as a physical training instructor. In 1945, he played for the Second Air Force Superbombers football team in Colorado Springs, Colorado. He was granted furlough to play two games for the Bears and then returned to the Superbombers team where he finished the 1945 football season. At the end of the season, Turner was the leading pick on the All-Army Air Forces conference football team.

In March 1946, Turner rejected offers to play in the All-America Football Conference and signed a contract to return to the Bears. He appeared in all 11 games, and helped lead the 1946 Bears to another NFL championship. At the end of the season, Turner was selected as a first-team All-Pro by the AP, UP, and NYDN.

In 1947, Turner appeared in all 12 games for a Bears team that compiled an 8–4 record and finished in second place in the NFL Western Division. During the 1947 season, Turner intercepted a Sammy Baugh pass and returned it 96 yards for a touchdown, a moment that Turner later selected as the highlight of his career. At the end of the season, he was picked as a first-team All-Pro by the AP, NYDN, and PFI.

In 1948, Turner again appeared in all 12 games for the Bears team that compiled a 10–2 record and again finished in second place in the NFL Western Division. For the eighth and final time, Turner was selected as a first-team All-Pro center, receiving first-team honors from AP, UP, PFI, and &quot;The Sporting News&quot;.

Turner continued to play for the Bears for four more years, appearing in all 12 games each year from 1949 to 1952. In his final year, he played at the offensive tackle position. In 13 NFL seasons, Turner appeared in 138 regular season games and seven post-season games. He intercepted 17 passes in the regular season and four more in five NFL championship games. He was selected as a first-team All-Pro in eight of his 13 seasons.

Turner was big for his day (, ); however, he was smart and very fast. Turner later boasted about his talent as a blocker: &quot;I was such a good blocker, that the men they put in front of me – and some were stars who were supposed to be making a lot of tackles – they would have their coaches saying, &#x27;why ain&#x27;t you making any tackles?&#x27; they&#x27;d say, &#x27;that bum Turner is holding.&#x27; Well that wasn&#x27;t true. . . . I could handle anybody that they&#x27;d put in front of me.&quot; According to George Halas, Turner was &quot;perhaps the smartest player&quot; he had in 40 years as the Bears&#x27; coach, a player who &quot;knew every assignment for every player on every player.&quot; Teammate George Musso once said of Turner, &quot;Who knows what kind of player he would have been if he ever got to rest during a game?&quot;

During the 1952 NFL season, Turner was both a player for the Bears and an assistant coach responsible for instructing the guards and centers.

In January 1953, after retiring as a player, Turner was hired as an assistant line coach at Baylor University in Waco, Texas. He had a ranch in nearby Gatesville, and was responsible for coaching the offensive centers and defensive linebackers. He resigned his post at Baylor in February 1954.

Turner was an assistant coach for the Bears from 1954 to 1957. He worked from the pressbox and communicated by telephone to George Halas about weaknesses he had observed in opponents&#x27; defenses. He gave up his job with the Bears in 1958 to devote his full efforts to his ranch in Texas.

===New York Titans===
In December 1961, Turner was hired as the head coach of the New York Titans of the American Football League. Despite a pre-season injury to All-AFL fullback Bill Mathis, whose 846 rushing yards was second best in the 1961 AFL season, the Titans opened the season with a 2–1 record. However, owner Harry Wismer was broke and unable to pay the players, who refused to practice and went on a two-day strike. Wismer threatened to put the entire team on waivers, and his erratic behavior, including hastily placing six starters on waivers after a loss and threatening to sue the Denver Broncos after quarterback Lee Grosscup was injured on a hard tackle, caused the Titans to be described as &quot;the kookiest franchise in professional football.&quot; Even with financial assistance from other AFL clubs, the Titans&#x27; payroll deficiencies continued, and Turner had to expend energy just enticing his team to suit up. The team drew only 36,161 spectators to seven home games and finished with a 5–9 record. The team was sold in March 1963 and became the New York Jets. Turner was fired that same month.

==Honors==
Turner received numerous honors for his accomplishments as a football player. His honors include the following:

* In 1951, he was inducted into the Helms Athletic Foundation&#x27;s Professional Football Hall of Fame. He was the second Texan to be so honored, following Sammy Baugh.
* When Turner ended his playing career, the Bears retired his jersey No. 66. As of 1964, only six numbers had been retired by the Bears: Turner (No. 66); Bronko Nagurski (No. 3); George McAfee (No. 5); Sid Luckman (No. 42); Bill Hewitt (No. 58); and Red Grange (No. 77).
* In 1960, he was inducted into the National Football Foundation&#x27;s Hall of Fame (later renamed the College Football Hall of Fame).
* In 1961, he was inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame.
* In 1966, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He was selected as part of the fourth class of inductees and was the third center (following Mel Hein and George Trafton) to be so honored.
* In 1969, as part of the NFL&#x27;s 50th anniversary, the Pro Football Hall of Fame selected all-decade teams for each of the league&#x27;s first five decades. Turner was selected as a center on the NFL 1940s All-Decade Team.
* Also in 1969, Turner was selected by a panel of the Football Writers Association of America to the All-Southwest football team of the preceding 50 years.
* In 1975, he was selected to the Texas All-Pro football team, made up of professional football players who once played college football in Texas. Turner was the &quot;biggest landslide winner on the team.&quot;
* In 1979, he was selected as one of the inaugural inductees into the Hardin-Simmons Athletic Hall of Fame.
* ESPN rated Turner No. 7 on its list of the 50 greatest Chicago Bears.

==Family and later years==
Turner was married twice. His first wife was Helen W. Turner with whom he had a daughter, Patricia. He was later married to Gladys Webber (1925–1988) on July 4, 1948.

In 1950, Turner purchased a 1,200-acre ranch in Pidcoke, Coryell County, Texas, for $54,000. He moved from Chicago to the ranch on a full-time basis in April 1958.

After spending 1962 in New York as coach of the New York Titans, he returned to his ranch and began racing horses. In 1965, he purchased a second ranch in New Mexico to pursue his interest in breeding horses. He also raced his horses at Sunland Park and Ruidoso Downs in New Mexico.

In the 1970s, Turner moved to Omaha, Nebraska, where he took a job as a manager for Interstate Steel Co. In 1974, while on a business trip to Chicago, he suffered a stroke at age 55. In the 1980s, Turner developed further health problems, including diabetes, cancer, and heart disease requiring installation of a pacemaker. His wife, Gladys, also contracted lung cancer, and the couple lived in a house trailer on their Texas ranch. Suffering financial troubles, he qualified in 1987 for an NFL pension of $780 per month.

His wife died in October 1988 after 40 years of marriage. In his later years, Turner also suffered from emphysema, and in March 1998, he was diagnosed with lung cancer. He died at age 79 at his ranch near Gatesville, Texas. He was buried in Greenbriar Cemetery in Gatesville.

<doc id="1339480" wikidata="Q353690" url="?curid=1339480" title="Adel Emam">
<text>Adel Mohammed Emam (; born on 17 May 1940), is an Egyptian film, television, and stage actor, known for his extensive career with over 150 artistic works, including films, plays, and television series spanning comedy, social, and political genres. He is regarded as one of the leading figures of the second generation of comedy artists in Egypt and the Arab world. He is primarily a comedian, but he has starred in more serious works and, combined comedy with romance especially in his earlier secondary roles in films such as &quot;My Wife, the Director General&quot;, &quot;My Wife&#x27;s Dignity&quot;, &quot;My Wife&#x27;s Goblin&quot; and &quot;Virgo,&quot; all films starring Salah Zulfikar. 

Emam stands as a towering figure in Egyptian and Arab cinema, celebrated for his versatility across genres. Starting in the 1960s, he became one of the most well-known figures in the industry. Emam earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Agriculture from Cairo University. Since then he has appeared in over 103 movies and 10 plays. Emam&#x27;s personal life is connected to the world of arts. He is married to Hala El-Shalaqani and has three children, including director Ramy Emam and actor Mohamed Emam.

His contributions to the Egyptian film industry and theatre through addressing social and political issues in film and television earned him a cult following and a worldwide reputation that made him one of the most influential Arab public figures in the 1980s and 1990s. Consequently, he is considered by a huge mass of cult followers as a cultural icon in the history of modern Egypt.

Emam has received critical acclaim and international recognition, including Lifetime Achievement Awards and accolades from major festivals. Beyond acting, Emam is known for challenging societal norms and reflecting the culture of his time. His work remains influential, highlighting his lasting impact in a changing world. In January 2000, the United Nations appointed Emam as a Goodwill Ambassador for UNHCR.

== Personal life ==

=== Early life and education ===
Adel Emam was born into a poor farmer family on May 17, 1940, in the Sayeda Aisha district of Cairo, but his family&#x27;s origins trace back to the village of Shaha in the Mansoura district of Dakahlia Governorate. His full name is Adel Mohammed Emam Mohammed Bukhariny (). Adel Emam mentioned that he loved his mother deeply, and was profoundly affected by her death. His father, Mohamed Emam, was religious and worked as a &quot;Shawish&quot; in the police force. His father passed away in 1997 after suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease for some time. Adel Emam has one brother and two sisters. His brother is the producer Essam Emam, and his sisters are Eman and Mona. Mustafa Metwalli is his brother-in-law, being married to his sister Eman Emam.

During his childhood, Adel moved with his family from the Sayeda Aisha district to the Helmiya district, then to Omrania district in Giza, then to Mohandiseen, and later to Mansouria. Adel studied at Helmiya School before transferring to Benbaqdgan Secondary School and then to Marqosiya Secondary School in Alexandria. After completing school, he joined the Faculty of Agriculture at Cairo University, where some of his batchmates included actor Salah El-Saadany and former Syrian Prime Minister Mahmoud Al-Zoubi. Adel Emam stated on a talk show hosted by Hala Sarhan that Amin Shalaby and the late Younes Shalaby as well as Saeed Saleh and Salah Al-Saadani were his best friends since university. He began his artistic career at Cairo University&#x27;s theater, where he worked in theater and cinema. He participated in the play &quot;Ana Wa Howa Wa Heya&quot; (1963) during his third year at university.

=== His marriage and family ===
Adel Emam has been married only once, to Hala El-Shalaqani, a union that began in the mid-1960s and has lasted to the present day. In various interviews, Emam has discussed the story of his marriage. He revealed that he was initially not interested in marriage, but his wife, who came from a wealthy, land-owning family with ties to the Liberal Constitutional Party, was determined to marry him despite the challenges posed by their different social backgrounds. Emam noted that it was difficult for her to marry someone with his status as an actor in minor roles. In another television appearance, Emam shared that their relationship evolved naturally. He and his wife were once at the home of their friend, Samir Khafaga, when the door unexpectedly opened, and Emam saw something that brought him joy. Despite those around them trying to flirt with her, he refrained, explaining that he did not know how to flirt.

His wife, Hala, spoke about their early relationship in an interview with media personality Mufid Fawzy. She mentioned that she had insisted on marrying Emam, as he was initially shy and apprehensive about entering into a new relationship. She recounted, &quot;He once told me that he wasn’t thinking about marriage at all.&quot; Emam also reflected on their modest beginnings, stating that they decided not to have a wedding ceremony in order to save money for more important things. They gradually built their life together, starting with a chair, then a refrigerator, and eventually a stove, as they established their home. In another interview, Emam mentioned that the union took place without the approval of his wife’s family, as they had rejected the idea due to his status as a film extra. He also said: &quot;God loves me because I married Hala&quot;.

Emam has three children: the director Ramy Emam, Sarah Emam, and Mohamed Emam, who also starred in the movie &quot;The Yacoubian Building&quot; as &quot;Taha ElShazli&quot;. He also has eight grandchildren. Three of them, Adel, Ezz El-Din, and Roqaya, are Rami&#x27;s children; three daughters, Hala, Camellia, and Amina, are Sarah&#x27;s; and two daughters, Khadija and Qismat, are Mohamed&#x27;s. Rami&#x27;s wife is named Yasmine, Sarah&#x27;s husband is Ahmed Mokbel, and Mohamed&#x27;s wife is Nouran Talaat.

Adel usually spends his summer days with his children and grandchildren in a villa designated for them on the North Coast. He enjoys reading and has a large library in his home, considering reading an essential part of his daily routine. He also has a special hobby of planting and taking care of plants, due to his academic background, as he graduated from the Faculty of Agriculture.

=== Net worth ===
There are no official estimates regarding the exact size or amount of Adel Imam&#x27;s wealth, but some media reports suggest it is valued in the millions of dollars, making him the richest actor in Egypt with a net worth of 100 million dollars.

== Acting career ==

=== 1962–1969: Early career breakthrough ===
Adel Emam began his career in the 1960s, making his debut in 1967 with small roles in films. He launched his career in theater in &quot;Ana w Howa w Heya&quot; (1962) with Fouad El-Mohandes and Shwikar. In cinema, his early work included roles in films like &quot;My Wife, the Director General&quot; (1966), &quot;My Wife&#x27;s Dignity&quot; (1967), and his first significant role came in &quot;My Wife&#x27;s Goblin&quot; (1968) with Salah Zulfikar and Shadia. He was part of the younger generation of actors who emerged during the 1960s, which was a time of social and political change in Egypt.

His collaborations with directors like Sherif Arafa produced iconic works such as &quot;Terrorism and Kebab&quot; (1992), though technically just outside this decade, and &quot;Jazeerat al-Shaytan&quot; (1987). Emam’s style in the 1990s was often characterized by strong social criticism laced with humor. His performances in these films resonated with wide audiences across the Arab world, earning him massive popularity.

<text>The Branscomb Glacier () is an Antarctic glacier, long, flowing west from the north-west side of Vinson Massif (the highest point in Antarctica) into Nimitz Glacier, in the Sentinel Range of the Ellsworth Mountains. Its upper course receives ice influx from both Goodge Col and Jacobsen Valley, while the tributary Roché Glacier joins Branscomb Glacier just northwest of Príncipe de Asturias Peak. Branscomb Glacier has been the focus of scientific research expeditions aimed at studying glaciology, ice dynamics, and climate change in Antarctica.

The glacier was mapped by the USGS from surveys and USN aerial photographs between 1957 and 1960. It was named by US-ACAN after Lewis M. Branscomb, Chairman of the National Science Board from 1982 to 1984.

<doc id="1339490" wikidata="Q655504" url="?curid=1339490" title="The Minus 5">
<text>The Minus 5 is an American pop rock band headed by musician Scott McCaughey of Young Fresh Fellows, often in partnership with R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck.

==Band history==
McCaughey formed the band in 1993 as a side project with Buck, Jon Auer and Ken Stringfellow of The Posies. Buck had moved to the Seattle area in 1992; the other principals were longtime fixtures of the Seattle music scene. The four musicians had numerous personal and professional connections: both the Posies and McCaughey&#x27;s The Young Fresh Fellows had recorded at Conrad Uno&#x27;s Egg Studios and released albums on Uno&#x27;s PopLlama Records label. The Young Fresh Fellows and The Posies were fixtures of Seattle&#x27;s Crocodile Cafe, owned and managed by Buck&#x27;s then-girlfriend (later wife) Stephanie Dorgan. The Young Fresh Fellows were the opening band at a Kevn Kinney gig at the Croc On July 4, 1992; Buck backed Kinney along with R.E.M.&#x27;s Mike Mills and Bill Berry.

The song titles of the group&#x27;s earliest output—among them, &quot;Loser So Supreme,&quot; &quot;Drunkard&#x27;s Lullaby,&quot; and &quot;Brotherhood Of Pain&quot;—are indicative of the downbeat nature of the band&#x27;s initial output. Themes of alcoholism, death, and self-hatred are recurrent in each subsequent Minus 5 release. &quot;McCaughey realized he had a dumptruck-load of songs that the Young Fresh Fellows would either never get around to, or would wisely choose not to,&quot; read one press release. &quot;[Buck, Stringfellow and Auer] were quick to volunteer to help Scott capture his &#x27;Let The Bad Times Roll&#x27; vision.&quot;

=== Hello Recording Club EP ===
The band assembled at Uno&#x27;s Egg Studio in summer 1993 and recorded their debut EP for the Hello CD of the Month Club, a subscription-only mail order club run by John Flansburgh of They Might Be Giants. For this EP the band was supplemented by NRBQ members Tom Ardolino and Terry Adams and Young Fresh Fellows bassist Jim Sangster.

For this release only, the band&#x27;s name was stylized as &#x27;The Minus Five&#x27;; all subsequent releases have used a numeral. The EP was sent to subscribers as the December 1993/January 1994 release.

=== Live debut and 1994 recording sessions ===
The Minus 5 made their live debut at the Crocodile Cafe on November 9, 1993, on a bill supporting jangly indie heroes The Silos. As Auer and Stringfellow were in Europe touring behind the Posies&#x27; Frosting On The Beater, the Minus 5 performed as a duo with backing from The Silos&#x27; Walter Salas-Humara, Tom Freund and Manuel Versoza for the last three songs. The set included lively covers of Johnny Cash&#x27;s &quot;I Still Miss Someone&quot; and Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Barstool Blues&quot; as well as four freshly-written McCaughey compositions.

Due to recording duties on R.E.M.&#x27;s &quot;Monster&quot;, Buck was away from Seattle for much of 1994, returning only briefly for the birth of his twin daughters. When mixing on R.E.M.&#x27;s album was complete, Buck turned his attention to McCaughey&#x27;s new songs. The Minus 5 played their second show at the Crocodile Cafe on September 15, 1994, just a week before &quot;Monster&quot;&#x27;s release. For this gig McCaughey, Buck and Stringfellow were joined by The Model Rockets&#x27; John Ramberg.

By fall 1994, McCaughey was caught up in the promotional blitz behind &quot;Monster&quot;, making his live debut with R.E.M. on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; November 12, 1994. McCaughey was subsequently recruited to join R.E.M. on their worldwide tour which kicked off in January 1995.

The Minus 5&#x27;s cover of Johnny Cash&#x27;s &quot;I Still Miss Someone&quot; was released on a 1994 German compilation titled &quot;Love Is My Only Crime – Part Two&quot;. The CD also featured rare or previously unreleased songs from The Young Fresh Fellows and future McCaughey collaborator Steve Wynn.

=== &quot;Old Liquidator&quot; ===
In April 1995, R.E.M. drummer Bill Berry suffered a brain aneurysm, causing more than two months of planned tour dates to be abruptly cancelled. In the unexpected downtime, McCaughey and Buck put the finishing touches on what would become the Minus 5&#x27;s debut LP—at the time titled &quot;Last Call, Corporal.&quot;

The finished product, hastily retitled &quot;Old Liquidator&quot;, was at first a hard-to-find, low-key release on German indie label Glitterhouse. Though pressed in modest numbers and at first only available in the U.S. as an import, the cachet of being an &#x27;R.E.M. side project&#x27; in 1995 was an irresistible lure to thirsty collectors. It wasn&#x27;t long before Minneapolis distributor East Side Digital released the album in the U.S. as well.

&quot;Old Liquidator&quot; is haunted by the unexpected Christmas 1994 death of McCaughey&#x27;s friend Jimmy Silva, who had collaborated with Young Fresh Fellows, Stringfellow, Uno and members of The Smithereens. &quot;Worse,&quot; the second track on the album, was co-written with Silva. Other cuts such as &quot;Story&quot; are influenced by the surrealist imagery of mid-60s Bob Dylan, invoking fictional misadventures of figures including Franz Kafka.

Another inspiration is Nick Lowe, whose obscure 1979 B-side &quot;Basing Street&quot; is smothered here in the squealing distortion Buck patented on &quot;Country Feedback.&quot; Elsewhere, Buck&#x27;s exotic bouzouki and dulcimer textures proved welcome departures from &quot;Monster&quot;&#x27;s fuzzed-out glam riffs. The Byrds-influenced Rickenbacker jangle of single &quot;Emperor Of The Bathroom&quot; is unmistakably Buck. Auer and Stringfellow are more tangible on this album, harmonizing amiably on opener &quot;Winter Goes Away&quot; and closing singalong &quot;When It Comes My Way.&quot;

&quot;Old Liquidator&quot; begins The Minus 5&#x27;s custom of numbering their releases, including singles, in chronological order. On the back cover, the subtitle &quot;The Minus 5 No. 2 Record&quot; is prominently displayed above the musicians&#x27; names.

A CD single for &quot;The Emperor Of The Bathroom&quot; was released in fall 1995 with alternate versions of three album cuts, a country-fried outtake called &quot;Heartache For Sale&quot; and a cover of the Fantastic Baggys&#x27; &quot;This Little Woody.&quot;

When the &quot;Monster&quot; tour resumed in summer 1995, R.E.M. began recording what would later become the &quot;New Adventures In Hi-Fi&quot; album using recordings of new songs made in concert, at soundchecks, in dressing rooms and even on the tour bus. McCaughey, again called along for the ride, contributed significantly to these recordings playing piano, organ, synths and autoharp.

Between R.E.M. gigs on June 1, 1995, The Minus 5 played their first show outside of Seattle at the Lounge Ax in Chicago. Without Auer and Stringfellow, Buck and McCaughey were supported by Wilco frontman Jeff Tweedy, R.E.M. bassist Mike Mills, and Mark Greenberg. New songs &quot;Moonshine Girl&quot; and &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t Want To Care&quot; were debuted alongside Johnny Cash, Nick Lowe, Gram Parsons and Porter Wagoner covers.

During another tour hiatus, The Minus 5 played gigs at the Tractor Tavern and Crocodile Cafe in Seattle at the end of August 1995. New song &quot;Bullfight&quot; was debuted at these shows, which featured Young Fresh Fellows and Fastbacks guitarist Kurt Bloch in addition to McCaughey, Buck and Auer.

In December 1995, The Minus 5 played two nights at the Crocodile Cafe in support of Kevn Kinney, supplemented by Screaming Trees&#x27; Barrett Martin on upright bass. The Minus 5 and Kevn Kinney also played at the Aladdin Theater in Portland as The Barrett Martin Quartet.

=== Hollywood Records deal and &quot;The Lonesome Death of Buck McCoy&quot; ===
The modest success of &quot;Old Liquidator&quot; and continued cultural cache of R.E.M. brought The Minus 5 a great deal of attention in 1996. Not only were the group signed to Disney-affiliated Hollywood Records, but the label agreed to finance a follow-up record and even reissue some of McCaughey&#x27;s back catalog. Moreover, McCaughey was given his own label imprint, Malt Records, with distribution through Hollywood.

Though the bulk of recording for &quot;New Adventures In Hi-Fi&quot; had taken place on the road, Buck was occupied through early 1996 with recording and mixing the new R.E.M. album. Nonetheless, McCaughey and Buck continued to record in piecemeal sessions with Avast! engineer Kevin Suggs, Conrad Uno, John Keane, and Water Music&#x27;s Rob Grenoble. In late summer, The Minus 5 played KISW&#x27;s Pain In The Grass concert in support of The Posies, who were busy touring behind their 1996 release &quot;Amazing Disgrace&quot;. New songs &quot;Cross Every Line&quot; and &quot;Empty Room&quot; were premiered by a lineup including McCaughey, Buck, Auer, Stringfellow and John Ramberg.

&quot;New Adventures In Hi-Fi&quot; was released September 10, 1996. With no tour planned to promote the album, Buck was free to explore other musical pursuits. In early fall 1996, Buck embarked on two new musical collaborations: the instrumental supergroup Tuatara with Barrett Martin, and a collaborative album with American Music Club&#x27;s Mark Eitzel. Martin joined the Minus 5 for a Crocodile Cafe gig on October 7, 1996, where new songs &quot;Hate Me More&quot; and &quot;Dear Employer (The Reason I Quit&quot;) were debuted. McCaughey&#x27;s then-wife Christy McWilson also joined the group for this show. The following week, Tuatara made their live debut at the Croc.

In December 1996, Buck booked a week with engineer Ed Brooks at Ironwood in Seattle to record Eitzel&#x27;s &quot;West&quot; album. McCaughey, Martin, and Pearl Jam&#x27;s Mike McCready were all on hand for the sessions. At the end of the sessions, The Minus 5 opened for Eitzel at the Crocodile Cafe. Martin and Eitzel both joined The Minus 5 for several songs and McCaughey premiered new song &quot;Boeing Spacearium.&quot; The second Minus 5 full-length, dubbed &quot;The Lonesome Death of Buck McCoy&quot;, was completed at Ironwood shortly thereafter.

&quot;The Lonesome Death of Buck McCoy&quot;, cobbled together from McCaughey&#x27;s many 1996 sessions, featured an impressive roster of guests including Guided by Voices&#x27; Robert Pollard, The Presidents of the United States of America, McWilson, Barrett Martin and Mike McCready. Unlike previous releases, each song was credited equally to McCaughey and Buck. In the liner notes each player was assigned a &quot;role&quot; as in a rock opera, with McCaughey himself playing &quot;Buck McCoy&quot; and others assuming roles like &quot;Admiral Boot,&quot; &quot;The Constable&quot; and &quot;Ancient Roomer.&quot; In reference to the creative process of the album, the liner notes provide a synopsis: &quot;Little Buck McCoy wakes up born in the middle of a wheatfield. He decides to carry on alone, despite his many acquaintances, until dying years later.&quot;

The songs did not actually constitute a narrative or refer to these characters at all. Critics took note of the haphazard nature of the proceedings, which included Small Faces pastiche &quot;Popsycle Shoppe&quot; and a cover of John Lennon&#x27;s harrowing &quot;My Mummy&#x27;s Dead.&quot; No Depression called the album &quot;Surprisingly bitter froth...Most of the record&#x27;s 12 songs quake with the severely compressed intimacy and hazy chamber-ballad tension of recent R.E.M. (no surprise) and John Lennon.&quot;

In early 1997, R.E.M. began the process of writing demos for a new album both in Athens in February and Buck&#x27;s Hawaiian residence in April. The three albums Buck had contributed to in 1996 were all released within weeks of one another. Tuatara&#x27;s &quot;Breaking The Ethers&quot; was released March 1, 1997, followed by Eitzel&#x27;s &quot;West&quot; and &quot;The Lonesome Death of Buck McCoy&quot; on the same day: May 5, 1997. A U.S. tour was assembled that would allow Buck to tour both coasts with all three acts, under the title &quot;The Magnificent Seven vs. The United States.&quot; The Magnificent Seven referred to McCaughey, Stringfellow, Eitzel, Martin and the three remaining members of Tuatara—though counting Buck there were actually eight. American Music Club bassist Dan Pearson later joined the tour to augment Eitzel&#x27;s sets. For this tour The Minus 5 consisted of Buck, McCaughey, Stringfellow, Martin, and Tuatara&#x27;s Justin Harwood.

The tour kicked off May 1, 1997 with two hometown gigs at the Crocodile. Each show featured Tuatara and Eitzel performing two sets each, with a short Minus 5 set between and occasionally McCaughey performing solo. The 22-date tour continued for two months, with many media appearances along the way. Buck and Eitzel performed on KFOG in San Francisco, Late Night With Conan O&#x27;Brien and then on WBCN radio in Boston. All three groups played Morning Becomes Eclectic on KCRW in Santa Monica and Idiot&#x27;s Delight on WNEW in New York. Near the end of the tour all three groups played a free in-store at New York record mecca Other Music.

The East Coast leg of the tour was peppered with surprise guests: Pearl Jam&#x27;s Mike McCready and John Wesley Harding showed up in New York, Mike Mills joined The Minus 5 in Philadelphia and Atlanta, and Michael Stipe joined his R.E.M. bandmates for a four-song encore in Atlanta.

Reaction to the tour was mixed. None of the three records sold particularly well, and the critics&#x27; approval was tepid: &quot;A three-hour marathon that was simply too much to absorb,&quot; Sara Scribner wrote in the Los Angeles Times. &quot;The Minus 5, despite some catchy, jangling tunes from its new album...never got its footing.&quot; Geoffrey Himes wrote in The Washington Post: &quot;Genuinely amusing when the tunes were bouncy and catchy, but the slow numbers didn&#x27;t have the humor or melody to justify the dreary pacing.&quot;

In June 1997, Buck recorded some tracks with Robyn Hitchcock for his album Jewels For Sophia in Seattle. After the session, McCaughey joined Hitchcock and Buck for a Crocodile Cafe gig under the name &quot;Popscyle Shoppe Incident: Viva Sea Tac II.&quot; Tim Keegan and Kurt Bloch joined in the set, and Young Fresh Fellows were the opening act.

=== Hollywood Records deluxe reissues ===
In August 1997, Hollywood Records reissued &quot;Old Liquidator&quot; and, curiously, McCaughey&#x27;s 1989 solo album &quot;My Chartreuse Opinion&quot; in deluxe editions with bonus tracks. &quot;My Chartreuse Opinion&quot;, a Conrad Uno-recorded affair which featured cameos from Jimmy Silva and Christy McWilson, was now credited to &quot;The Minus 5 of Scott McCaughey.&quot; The reissue actually featured fewer bonus tracks than the now out-of-print original release, which featured four unrelated Silva recordings at the end. Nonetheless, it was a great way of drawing attention to McCaughey&#x27;s back catalog and much easier to find than the initial release. &quot;Old Liquidator&quot; was also expanded, adding two songs from the Hello Recording Club EP, &quot;Heartache For Sale&quot; from the &quot;Emperor of the Bathroom&quot; single, and two short instrumentals.

These would prove to be The Minus 5&#x27;s final releases on Hollywood. Just weeks before the release of &quot;The Lonesome Death of Buck McCoy&quot;, longtime Hollywood Records president Bob Pfeifer resigned. Under a reorganization plan, Disney acquired established indie Mammoth Records for $25 million in an attempt to diversify its roster. Mammoth founder Jay Faires was now charged with breaking The Minus 5 to a larger audience, but industry watchers such as Variety&#x27;s Adam Sandler questioned why Disney didn&#x27;t focus on &quot;pop music, which is a better fit with its TV and film programming, rather than indie-inspired repertoire.&quot;

=== McCaughey joins R.E.M. and Tuatara in the studio ===
While R.E.M. was in Georgia recording demos for what would become &quot;Up&quot;, The Minus 5 played its first two shows without Buck: at Chicago&#x27;s Lounge Ax on August 16, 1997, the band consisted of McCaughey, Stringfellow, Jason Finn and Dharma Bums&#x27; Jim Talstra. The raucous gig was by far the band&#x27;s longest to date: an 11-song McCaughey solo set followed by a 22-song Minus 5 powerhouse that included unreleased songs, several nuggets from &quot;My Chartreuse Opinion&quot; and covers of John Lennon and The Modern Lovers. The following week, McCaughey played a gig with John Wesley Harding at the Croc in Seattle which included a handful of Minus 5 tunes and as-yet-unreleased Young Fresh Fellows songs.

In October 1997, Bill Berry announced he was leaving R.E.M. Having completed more than eight months of writing and recording demos for &quot;Up&quot;, R.E.M. made the decision to continue as a three-piece. As the recording process continued in 1998, McCaughey became an important contributor in the studio, usually on keyboards. Ken Stringfellow and Barrett Martin were also recruited for some of these sessions. McCaughey was also roped into Tuatara in 1998, contributing three tracks to sophomore album &quot;Trading With The Enemy&quot;.

Near the end of 1997, The Minus 5 played the two-night Crocodile Cafe&#x27;s An Evenings In Edenbrook Forest event, with a lineup that included McCaughey, Buck, Martin and John Ramberg. A special double CD compilation was given away at the shows which included The Minus 5&#x27;s cover of The Modern Lovers&#x27; &quot;Government Center&quot; and rare or unreleased cuts from Young Fresh Fellows, The Lowe Beats (McCaughey&#x27;s Nick Lowe cover band), The Model Rockets, Fastbacks and others. The CD was the inaugural release of Book Records, a new label McCaughey started for extremely limited or tour-only releases.

In 1999, the group accepted an invitation to participate in a tribute album to Moby Grape co-founder Skip Spence, who was terminally ill with cancer, for the purpose of raising funds to assist with medical expenses.

Since McCaughey had made The Minus 5 his primary musical outlet, new material from The Young Fresh Fellows had slowed to a trickle. In 1994 and 1995, the group had released three singles and an EP. Nonetheless, McCaughey often recorded new songs with the Fellows and by summer 1999, had enough to release as an album. &quot;A Tribute To Music&quot; was released on Spanish indie label Rock and Roll Inc. and never released in the U.S. Though most of the tracks were originals, the Fellows made an unremarkable pass at R.E.M.&#x27;s rocker &quot;Circus Envy&quot; on the LP. Considered a minor release by both fans and critics, &quot;A Tribute To Music&quot; left many wondering if McCaughey was saving his best tunes for his other band. &quot;There&#x27;s a tossed-off feeling to the record,&quot; Bart Bealmear wrote for AllMusic. &quot;[Most of the songs] are missing the group&#x27;s unique mix of humor, energy, spirit, and melody.&quot;

=== &quot;In Rock&quot; ===
On January 9, 2000, The Minus 5 played a secret show at Lounge Ax in Chicago, opening for Wilco (billed as &quot;Summer Teeth&quot;) for 300 lucky fans. This was a farewell gig as the beloved Lincoln Park venue would shut its doors just one week later. For this gig, the Minus 5 was just McCaughey fronting Wilco, with frontman Jeff Tweedy playing bass. The group raced through a handful of brand-new, unrehearsed songs alongside covers of influences as diverse as Mott The Hoople, Johnny Cash and Neutral Milk Hotel.

A few weeks later (January 20) a more conventional Minus 5 lineup (McCaughey, Buck, Ramberg, Chris Ballew and R.E.M. session drummer Bill Rieflin) premiered eight of these new songs at the Crocodile Cafe back in Seattle. John Wesley Harding and Kurt Bloch sat in on a few numbers.

On March 13, 2000, McCaughey assembled a skeleton crew of himself, Buck, Ramberg and R.E.M. session drummer Bill Rieflin at Jupiter Studios in Seattle and recorded ten of his latest compositions in one day. The session included spirited takes on the Nightcrawlers&#x27; power-pop anthem &quot;The Little Black Egg&quot;, an ode to the demise of the Lounge Ax (&quot;The Night Chicago Died (The Death of The Minus 5)&quot;) and even a tribute to Dr. Evil, the villain in the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; film series.

On April 25, 2000, The Minus 5 played another Croc show with a lineup of McCaughey, Buck, Stringfellow, Ramberg and Barrett Martin. John Wesley Harding, Sean Nelson and The Long Winters&#x27; John Roderick sat in on the set, which included Bee Gees, Wings and Rolling Stones covers. The Minus 5 returned to the Croc on June 8 with McCaughey, Buck, Ramberg, Rieflin and John Wesley Harding playing a set which included some improvised one-off songs, Faces and Paul McCartney covers.

Despite a rigorous recording schedule for R.E.M. with sessions in Georgia and Dublin, Ireland, Buck was nonetheless available for Minus 5 gigs on July 7 at Tractor Tavern at September 2 at Bumbershoot Festival at Memorial Stadium. The Minus 5 were a last-minute replacement for a band that dropped out of the fest and for this show consisted of McCaughey, Buck, Ramberg, John Wesley Harding, Robert Lloyd (of Harding&#x27;s band) and members of the Walkabouts.

McCaughey pressed 1,000 copies of the March session as a surprise album, titled &quot;In Rock&quot;. Because it was made as a limited-edition, tour-only CD McCaughey released it on his Book label. The CD was only available at Minus 5 shows at first, though it was later sold through the R.E.M. fanclub. The CD was sold for the first time at an October 14, 2000 Crocodile Cafe show with McCaughey, Buck, Stringfellow, Ramberg and Rieflin. A Sonics cover band (The New Original Sonic Sound) featuring members of Mudhoney, Tuatara, and Gas Huffer with McCaughey on keyboards also played.

In October 2000, McCaughey and Stringfellow returned to Georgia to record with R.E.M. During the sessions, McCaughey, Stringfellow and Mike Mills joined local group The Possibilities for a loose set that included Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Chris Bell, Joni Mitchell and Gram Parsons covers. The Minus 5&#x27;s cover of the band&#x27;s &quot;You Don&#x27;t Mean It&quot; would be released as a radio single just a few months later.

The Minus 5 closed out an eventful year with a Croc set on December 8, 2000, with the lineup of McCaughey, Buck, Ramberg, and Rieflin with guests John Wesley Harding, Sean Nelson, Britt Speakman, Carla Tongerson and Peter Blackstock. A number of new songs were debuted at this show including &quot;A Thousand Years Away&quot; and &quot;You Don&#x27;t Mean It.&quot;

=== &quot;Let the War Against Music Begin&quot; ===
In 2001, the Minus Five and the Young Fresh Fellows, another McCaughey project, released a split double album, &quot;Let the War Against Music Begin/Because We Hate You&quot;; the &quot;Let the War Against Music Begin&quot; half was the Minus 5 submission.

After a change of guard at Hollywood Records, the Minus 5 found themselves releasing music via independent channels, with the Return to Sender label releasing a collection of outtakes from &quot;Let the War Against Music Begin&quot; called &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know Who I Am&quot; before McCaughey signed the band to the Yep Roc label for his collaboration with Wilco, &quot;Down With Wilco&quot;. Yep Roc later issued an EP dominated by &quot;Down With Wilco&quot; outtakes, &quot;At the Organ&quot;, and reissued &quot;In Rock&quot;, a collection of tunes McCaughey recorded in a single day in 2000.

In 2002, the band contributed a track, &quot;Girl I Never Met&quot; to Rami Jaffee, Pete Yorn, and Marc Dauer&#x27;s Trampoline Records release: Trampoline Records Volume I.

The band&#x27;s seventh album, self-titled &quot;The Minus 5&quot; (but known as &quot;The Gun Album&quot;), was released early 2006, and features, along the regular line-up, guest appearances by Wilco, Kelly Hogan and The Decemberists&#x27; singer/songwriter Colin Meloy, among others.

Buck and McCaughey went on to play in The Baseball Project together in 2008.

The Minus 5 appeared on John Wesley Harding&#x27;s 2009 release, &quot;Who Was Changed and Who Was Dead&quot; and released &quot;Killingsworth&quot; later that year.

In 2012, recorded a version of the 1976 hit single by the Sutherland Brothers and Quiver &quot;Arms of Mary&quot; for a fund raising CD titled &quot;Super Hits Of The Seventies&quot; for radio station WFMU. The band played at SXSW in 2013.

In January 2017, The Minus 5 joined Alejandro Escovedo for a short tour. For each concert, Scott McCaughey, Kurt Bloch, Peter Buck, and John Moen played one set as the Minus Five, and then a second set backing Escovedo, sometimes with Kelly Hogan, too. All of them had also performed on Escovedo&#x27;s 2016 album &quot;Burn Something Beautiful&quot;, for which Escovedo, McCaughey, and Buck co-wrote the songs.

<text>The Nimitz Glacier is an Antarctic glacier, long and wide, draining the area about west of the Vinson Massif and flowing southeast between the Sentinel Range and Bastien Range to enter Minnesota Glacier, in the central Ellsworth Mountains.

Discovered by USN Squadron VX-6 on photographic flights of 14–15 December 1959, and mapped by United States Geological Survey from these photos. Named by US-ACAN for Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz, USN, who as Chief of Naval Operations at the time of Operation Highjump, 1946–1947, made possible that unprecedentedly large Antarctic expedition.

<doc id="1339506" wikidata="Q3589860" url="?curid=1339506" title="Disaster Assistance Response Team">
<text>The Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) (French: &quot;Équipe d&#x27;intervention en cas de catastrophe (EICC)&quot;) is a rapidly deployable team of 200 Canadian Forces personnel. It provides assistance to disaster-affected regions for up to 40 days. DART&#x27;s headquarters is located in Kingston, Ontario. 

==History==
DART was created by the Canadian government in 1996 in the aftermath of the inadequate response to the 1994 Rwandan genocide, when Canada&#x27;s aid arrived after the peak of a cholera epidemic. The government determined that it would be of the utmost importance in many disasters if it was able to rapidly deploy a group of people until long-term aid arrived. 

DART has an annual budget of , although during specific incidents the Parliament of Canada can choose to temporarily allocate millions of dollars to DART to fund their response effort. For example, Operation Torrent, the aid mission to Turkey in the wake of the 1999 earthquake which left 17,000 people dead, saw used by DART in the response.

==Missions==

The Canadian government decides whether or not to send DART after a request from a country or the United Nations. Typically, upon a request from the government of the affected country, the Canadian government will dispatch its four to seven-person Canadian Disaster Assessment Team (CDAT). The CDAT members are from Global Affairs Canada and the Department of National Defence (DND). For all humanitarian assistance/DART missions Global Affairs Canada is the lead department representing the Government of Canada. The CDAT will assess the situation and submit its recommendations back to the Government (of Canada), who will decide if the DART can or cannot be of assistance. If it agrees to provide assistance, it will dispatch an additional group of 12-19 personnel who form the Humanitarian Assistance Reconnaissance Team (HART) who will make preparations to receive the remainder of the team into the affected area.

===Critiques===
Although DART&#x27;s goals may be well-intended there have been critiques of this program. It is costly, which comes with the nature of military intervention. Furthermore, although it does align with Canada&#x27;s foreign policy of the three Ds (defence, diplomacy, and development) it does not help with the global health inequity.

===Operation Central (Honduras), 1998===

In October 1998, Hurricane Mitch, a category-5 hurricane, struck Central America over a period of three days. As a result, 6,000 people died and over a million were missing or made homeless. DART situated themselves in the middle of the Rio Aguan Valley, in north-central Honduras. Because there were many isolated communities that were connected only by then-broken roads and bridges, DART was supported by four CH-146 Griffon helicopters from Canadian Forces Base Petawawa. By the end of the mission in mid-December 1998, DART had delivered 250,000 pounds of food and medical supplies throughout the valley. They also produced thousands of litres of clean drinking water and chlorinated local wells supporting approximately 15,000 people. Working with the medical personnel in Honduras, DART treated about 7,500 patients for ailments such as respiratory infections, conjunctivitis, skin infections, diarrhoea, parasitic infections and intestinal infections. It also helped repair roads, bridges and electrical systems.

===Operation Torrent (Turkey), 1999===

DART responded to a 7.4-magnitude earthquake that hit north-western Turkey on August 17, 1999. DART was deployed on the following day and set up a camp in Serdivan, a suburb of Adapazarı, which had 180,000 people. During this mission, DART personnel assisted in cleaning up a school, restoring electricity and designing and constructing a tented camp which could hold 2,500 people. This camp also had washroom and shower facilities. DART treated 5,000 patients and produced 2.5 million litres of bulk water.

===Operation Structure (Sri Lanka), 2004===

DART responded to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami that occurred on December 26, 2004. The reconnaissance team left for Colombo, Sri Lanka, on December 30, 2004. A commercial plane carried a reconnaissance crew with representatives from Foreign Affairs Canada (three), Canadian International Development Agency (two), Public Health Agency (one), and DART itself (six). Prime Minister Paul Martin announced his plans to send DART into the region on January 2, 2005. Four days later, a plane carrying 150 DART members departed for Ampara, Sri Lanka. On January 8, 2005, 50 more members arrived. Sri Lanka suffered tremendously as a result of the earthquake, the Canadian government stated that their relief efforts were to be concentrated there. They set up their main camp in a former sugar factory.

Ampara is cited as being one of the most affected by the tsunami. The Canadian government estimates that 105,560 out of the 600,000 people living in the city had been forced to seek temporary shelter. An estimated 10,400 deaths occurred as a result of the earthquake. The DART team brought four water purification units, which can provide up to 200,000 litres of clean water per day. It also provided primary medical care, some special engineering capabilities, and communications between DART, Sri Lanka and other relief organizations. The mission was expected to last six weeks. Their first task was to supply hospitals with potable water, (which they hoped to achieve by using their water purification units, which can purify 150,000 to 200,000 litres per day). Thus far, DART has treated 5,800 patients and produced more than 2.5 million litres of purified water. They have also helped repair schools, clear rubble, build temporary shelters and repair fishing boats and water mains in Sri Lanka.

The lack of an immediate response by what was supposed to be a rapid-response unit aroused significant criticism. Although the DART team was ready to leave within 24 hours of when the disaster struck, the government took two days to announce that the team would be dispatched, and it took nearly two weeks for DART to actually leave for Sri Lanka, due to a lack of available air transport. These delays notwithstanding, the DART chief, Michael Voith, commended DART&#x27;s work, saying: &quot;What I can tell you after this mission is the organization of the DART that we have right now ... is a sound organization, it brings an incredible capability to a disaster area&quot;. John Watson of CARE Canada, responded by calling the operation an &quot;amateur&quot; response. Voith dismissed these remarks, saying that the team filled a &quot;critical void.&quot; DART supporters have also noted that the initial response (i.e. digging people out of collapsed buildings, providing surgery/immediate serious trauma care for the injured), is not a DART responsibility. This is apparent from the fact that they do not have trauma surgeons, SAR assets, firefighters or other professionals who would be of critical importance during the very first days after a disaster. Rather, the job of DART is to mitigate the impact of the lack of critical infrastructure after a disaster.

===Operation Plateau (Pakistan), 2005===
DART responded to the magnitude 7.6 2005 Kashmir earthquake on October 8, 2005. On October 14, three days after a nine-member Canadian delegation left to assess the situation, Prime Minister Paul Martin announced that DART would be going to the Muzaffarabad region of Pakistan. The reconnaissance team arrived on October 16, the main force two days later. By December 9 all DART personnel had returned to Canada.

DART distributed 500 tonnes of humanitarian aid supplies and purified and distributed 3,811,535 litres of drinking water.

The team also provided medical treatment for 11,782 people, including:

*7,000 who received care from mobile medical teams airlifted by helicopter to their isolated communities.
*2,637 who received care at the DART clinic in Gahri Dupatta.
*2,145 who were immunized against a variety of contagious diseases.

The value of the operation, as well as its cost-effectiveness, was criticized for its excessive emphasis on technological solutions rather than on broader local primary-care needs - a type of criticism that Canada&#x27;s emergency response has received as early as its relief operations in 1985 following the Mexico City earthquake and more specifically in regards to the belated deployment of DART in 2004 to the Asia-Pacific tsunami disaster (see Operation Structure (Sri Lanka), 2004). It is suggested that rapidly deploying human resources in order for health to reach victims in the shortest possible time would have been the most efficient and most cost-effective form of response.

===Operation Hestia (Haiti), 2010===

DART deployed to Haiti to assist in the recovery effort after a massive earthquake hit the country in January 2010. While there, they worked in tandem with 12,000 US MINUSTAH and 2,000 Canadian troops, mainly from 5 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group). Following an initial assessment and relief work near Port-au-Prince, the DART team began to concentrate their efforts on the area surrounding Jacmel on January 18, 2010.

===Operation Renaissance 13-01 (Philippines) 2013===

On November 11, 2013, DART sent 43 members to assist in the relief effort to the Philippines to assist in the relief effort after Typhoon Haiyan and 54 more members are on the way. Deployment of the DART was completed on December 18. DART capabilities included engineering road clearance, medical assistance through Medical Mobile teams (MMT) and water purification. Operations are concentrated on Panay Island.

===Operation Renaissance 15-1 (Nepal) 2015===
On April 26, 2015, DART deployed 200 personnel to assist with the engineering, medical aid and mapping in Nepal after the 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck.

<text>Route 15 is a state highway in the U.S. state of Connecticut that runs from a connection with New York&#x27;s Hutchinson River Parkway in Greenwich, Connecticut, to its northern terminus intersecting with Interstate 84 (I-84) in East Hartford, Connecticut. Route 15 consists of four distinct sections: the Merritt Parkway, the Wilbur Cross Parkway (both freeways), most of the Berlin Turnpike, and part of the Wilbur Cross Highway. The unified designation was applied to these separate highways in 1948 to provide a continuous through route from New York to Massachusetts. The parkway section of Route 15 is often referred to locally as &quot;The Merritt&quot;.

==Route description==

===Merritt Parkway===
Route 15 begins at the New York border, where the Hutchinson River Parkway continues southwest towards New York City, at the New York State Route 120A interchange in the village of Rye Brook, in the town of Rye, New York. The highway comes into the state of Connecticut, continuing as the Merritt Parkway, a four-lane controlled-access parkway with low bridges, sharp curves, and a tree-filled median, that passes through the affluent urbanized areas of southern Fairfield County. Commercial vehicles are prohibited on this section of Route 15. The parkway heads into the town of Greenwich, where it passes a service plaza in both directions and curves north-northwest, before heading northeast and meeting interchanges at Round Hill Road, providing access to Downtown Greenwich, and at Lake Avenue. From there, Route 15 turns northeast, and curves through its interchange with North Street, which provides another outlet into Downtown Greenwich. Past this interchange, the parkway enters the city of Stamford, where it crosses over the Mianus River within the Mianus River State Park, before reaching an interchange with Route 104 in the residential areas of North Stamford, providing access to Downtown Stamford and the University of Connecticut Stamford Campus. Route 15 continues to an interchange with Route 137 before the route leaves Stamford.

The parkway comes into the town of New Canaan, where it crosses the Noroton River within its interchange with Route 106, adjacent to the Talmadge Hill station on the New Canaan Branch of the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s New Haven Line, located to the southeast of the interchange. Afterwards, Route 15 passes under the New Canaan Branch and curves around to meet an interchange for Route 124 before reaching the New Canaan Service Plaza. After crossing the Fivemile River, the parkway enters the city of Norwalk and immediately comes to an interchange with Route 123, which provides access to the Norwalk Community College. Just past its crossing of the Silvermine River, Route 15 meets the U.S. Route 7 (US 7) freeway at an incomplete interchange before it crosses over the Danbury Branch of the New Haven Line just south of the Merritt 7 station, and the Norwalk River and comes to a cloverleaf interchange with Main Avenue which provides the missing movements between the parkway and US 7. From there, Route 15 continues northeast through residential areas in the neighborhood of Cranbury before it leaves Norwalk, after crossing over Route 53 without an interchange.
The parkway enters the town of Westport, where it crosses over the Saugatuck River, and comes to right-in/right-out interchanges with Route 33, just east of the town line. Route 15 turns to the northeast again, upon reaching its interchange with Route 57, that has a park and ride lot serving the town of Westport in its northwest corner. Immediately after this interchange, the parkway crosses over Route 136 with no access and enters its longest stretch without exits, where it passes more wooded residential areas and comes into the town of Fairfield, where it meets its next interchange, five and a half miles later, at Route 58, which also has a park and ride lot, located in its southeastern corner. Route 58 provides access to both Fairfield Center and the campus of Fairfield University. Route 15 crosses the Mill River, passes service plazas in both directions, and then meets Route 59 at a pair of right-in/right-out interchanges. Route 59 provides access to the headquarters of General Electric. The parkway turns east-northeast and enters the town of Trumbull at its interchange with Park Avenue, which provides access to the campus of Sacred Heart University just to the southwest of the road, as well as the campus of the University of Bridgeport in the adjacent city of Bridgeport. Route 15 then reaches a single-point urban interchange with Route 111, adjacent to the Westfield Trumbull shopping mall, in its southwestern corner. The parkway meets the Route 25 freeway at an incomplete turbine interchange, which provides access to the Beardsley Zoo in Bridgeport, and the route crosses the Pequonnock River within the interchange. Past Route 25, Route 15 reaches a southbound exit and northbound entrance for Route 127 and then a full interchange for Route 108, in tandem with stack interchange with the Route 8 freeway.

Route 15 comes into the town of Stratford through more wooded suburban areas, and reaches an interchange with Route 110 at the northeastern edge of town. Past this interchange, the parkway runs due east to cross the Igor Sikorsky Memorial Bridge over the Housatonic River where it leaves both Stratford and Fairfield County. Route 15 enters both Milford and New Haven County, coming to a modified trumpet interchange with the Milford Parkway which provides access to both the I-95 freeway and US 1, north of Downtown Milford. At this point, the Merritt Parkway ends and Route 15 turns northeast again through the wooded residential areas of southwestern New Haven County.

===Wilbur Cross Parkway===

The next component of Route 15, the Wilbur Cross Parkway, begins at the Milford Parkway junction. The Wilbur Cross Parkway follows the same general configuration and landscape as the Merritt Parkway, continues with the Merritt Parkway&#x27;s exit numbers, and excludes commercial vehicles from its use, too. A few miles after the Milford Parkway, Route 15 comes into the town of Orange, where it passes a bi-directional service plaza, and meets Route 121 at a pair of right-in/right-out ramps, which provides access to the Orange campus of the University of New Haven. Now running north-northeast, Route 15 continues to a cloverleaf interchange with Route 34 which provides access eastbound to the Yale Bowl, in the city of New Haven. The parkway crosses the Wepawaug River, where it turns northeast and enters the town of Woodbridge, passing under Route 114 without access. Route 15 again crosses a boundary and comes into New Haven, where it meets an interchange with Route 69/Route 63 that provides access to the campus of Southern Connecticut State University, in the neighborhood of Amity, crossing the West River within the interchange.
From here, the parkway briefly crosses back through the southeastern corner of Woodbridge, before coming back into New Haven, and entering Heroes Tunnel which passes under West Rock Ridge. Immediately after exiting the tunnel, Route 15 comes into the town of Hamden, where it heads into a mix of residential and commercial areas around its interchange with Route 10. The parkway then enters the town of North Haven, where it crosses the Mill River and passes under the Route 40 freeway as the only freeway crosspath in the state without an interchange, over East Rock. A short distance later, the parkway meets an interchange with Route 22 and continues northeast to the last pair of service plazas on the route. Past the plazas, Route 15 turns north-northeast along the western edge of the Quinnipiac River State Park, where the route enters the town of Wallingford. In Wallingford, the parkway has exits to Quinnipiac Street providing access to Gaylord Specialty Healthcare and the Wallingford station on Amtrak and ConnDOT&#x27;s Hartford Line, as well as Route 150 that provides access to the Masonicare Health Center. Route 15 crosses the Quinnipiac River and turns northeast, where it comes to an interchange for US 5, where it also crosses the Hartford Line.

Route 15 continues northeast into the city of Meriden and passes entrances to the ConnDOT maintenance facilities. The parkway continues a short distance before reaching an interchange complex on the east side of town. First, Route 15 crosses over the I-91 freeway, where it turns north to reach a southbound exit and northbound entrance, before meeting East Main Street, which provides access to the Wesleyan University campus, where the Interstate Highway begins to run inside the median. The parkway widens to six lanes through here, then reaches the next exits for northbound I-91 with a northbound exit and southbound entrance, as well as a northbound exit and southbound entrance to and from the westbound direction of the I-691 freeway, where there is also access from westbound I-691 to the northbound Wilbur Cross Parkway. Past I-691, Route 15 narrows back to four lanes, and turns north-northwest before heading north-northeast again, where the Wilbur Cross Parkway ends and northbound US 5 merges with northbound Route 15 to head toward the suburban areas of Greater Hartford.

===Berlin Turnpike===

Route 15 continues onto a four-lane arterial road concurrent with US 5, known as the Berlin Turnpike, running between Silver Lake to the west and Lamentation Mountain to the east. Here, it passes along a commercial strip before passing areas of residence. The highway enters the town of Berlin and Hartford County, and briefly forms the western edge of Lamentation Mountain State Park, before heading back into commercial areas. An old alignment of the Berlin Turnpike, splits to the west, while US 5/Route 15 curve to their interchange with the Route 9 freeway and Route 372, in which all access besides the ramps from US 5/Route 15 to southbound Route 9 and from southbound Route 9 to US 5/Route 15 is made via Route 372. North of Route 9, the old alignment of the Berlin Turnpike rejoins the new road briefly, before splitting again, this time to the east. The highway crosses the Mattabesset River before intersecting the western terminus of Route 160. US 5/Route 15 passes rows of shopping centers, as it comes into the town of Newington, intersecting the southern terminus of Route 173, which heads north towards the town of West Hartford. The highway continues to its junction with the southern terminus of Route 176, which heads north towards the center of Newington. A park and ride lot is located in the northeastern corner of this intersection, with Griswoldville Avenue. From here, US 5/Route 15 passes the ConnDOT headquarters on the east, prior to reaching the intersections with Route 287. The highway leaves Newington at its interchange with Route 175, which heads west towards the center of town and east towards the town of Wethersfield.

After the Route 175 interchange, US 5/Route 15 enters Wethersfield and passes more commercial areas before reaching the partial interchange with Route 314. The Berlin Turnpike splits and continues north-northeast along Route 314, narrowing to a two-lane undivided road, until it reaches the Hartford city line, continuing into that city as Maple Avenue. US 5/Route 15 exits onto a four-lane freeway that heads northeast towards I-91 as a controlled-access outlet into Hartford.

===Wilbur Cross Highway===

Past Route 314, US 5/Route 15 continue onto the Wilbur Cross Highway, a four-lane freeway with a jersey barrier in the middle. The highway passes through wooded urbanized areas, to the southeast of the Connecticut Department of Labor headquarters, before it comes to an interchange with the northern terminus of Route 99, in which the overpass that carries the two routes over that route and the Providence and Worcester Railroad&#x27;s Connecticut Valley Railroad line is called the Clinton &quot;Jiggs&quot; Hughes Memorial Bridge. Next, US 5/Route 15 comes into Hartford, turns north-northeast at an interchange with I-91, where there are ramps from northbound and southbound US 5/Route 15 to southbound I-91, and from northbound I-91 to northbound I-91 to southbound US 5/Route 15. The next interchange at Brainard Road/Airport Road with access to Hartford-Brainard Airport, has no southbound exit. The highway continues through industrial areas and comes exits from the southbound Wilbur Cross Highway to Southbound I-91, as well as an exit from the northbound Wilbur Cross Highway and northbound I-91 that also provides access to westbound I-84.
From here, US 5/Route 15 cross over the Connecticut River on the Charter Oak Bridge, where the routes enter the town of East Hartford. On the other side of the bridge, there is an interchange serving Route 2, where northbound US 5 splits and exits Route 15 onto Main Street, which runs north through the center of East Hartford. Route 15 curves to a northbound exit and southbound entrance with Silver Lane, before the highway reaches its northern terminus and merges onto eastbound I-84 and US 6. A dedicated connection also exists between Route 15 and I-84/US 6&#x27;s high-occupancy vehicle lanes. The Wilbur Cross Highway continues northeast along I-84 towards Interstate 90/Massachusetts Turnpike in Sturbridge, Massachusetts.

==History==

The Route 15 designation was created as part of the 1932 state highway renumbering and originally ran from New Haven through Middletown, East Hartford and Stafford Springs to the Massachusetts state line in Union. The original route used the pre-expressway alignment of modern Route 17 to Glastonbury, Main Street to East Hartford center, U.S. Route 5 to the junction with Route 30, then modern Route 30 to Stafford, then modern Route 190 to Union, and modern Route 171 to the Massachusetts state line.

===Wilbur Cross Parkway===
The Wilbur Cross Parkway is named after Wilbur Lucius Cross, a former governor of the state (1931–1939). The parkway was originally planned in 1937 as route from US 1 in Milford to the Massachusetts state line in Union. The portion of the parkway south of Meriden was built largely as planned. Construction began in 1939 when federal funds were secured. The first section of the parkway to open was the Milford to Orange segment, from the Housatonic River (Exit 54) to Route 34 (Exit 57-58) at the end of 1941. Subsequent construction was delayed by World War II. After the war, two more sections of the parkway opened: the segment from US 5 in Wallingford (Exit 66) to US 5 in Meriden (Exit 68), bypassing the city center opened in 1946; and the segment from Route 10A in Hamden (Exit 61) to US 5 in Wallingford opened in 1947. In 1948, a portion of the Wilbur Cross Parkway between Route 34 and Whitney Avenue had still been under construction. Route 15 was temporarily routed along Route 34, Sherman Avenue (former Routes 5 and 10), Henry Street/Munson Street/Hillside Place/Edwards Street (former Route 5), and Whitney Avenue (former Route 10A).

By 1949, the Wilbur Cross Parkway was completed and the temporary Route 15 designation was removed from the surface streets. Because the New Haven segment had not yet been completed, motorists were directed to temporarily follow Route 34, US 5, and Route 10A. In November 1949, the New Haven segment, from Exit 57-58 to Exit 61, including the West Rock Tunnel opened.

The entire parkway was a toll road when it opened in 1941. Tolls were removed from both the Merritt and Wilbur Cross Parkways in 1988. Reflecting its history as a toll road, two pairs of service plazas lie opposite one-another along the parkway where the tolls once stood, in Orange and North Haven. Both have been renovated since 2011, along with six further south on the Merritt Parkway. In addition to gas pumps and an Alltown convenience store at each plaza, they now include Dunkin&#x27; Donuts and Subway shops. Prior to the renovations, no fast-food service had been available at any of the plazas. Three abandoned rest areas remain along the parkway, in Woodbridge, New Haven, and Meriden.

In 1943, a newly constructed two-lane highway (now the Wilbur Cross Highway) between Tolland and Union was opened to traffic. Route 15 was relocated on this new highway and the former Route 15 between Route 74 and Route 190 (then part of Route 20) was redesignated as Route 30. By 1948, the rest of the old two-lane Wilbur Cross Highway to East Hartford had also opened, connecting to the Charter Oak Bridge and the Hartford Bypass. In 1948, the State Highway Department decided to relocate Route 15 to a series of roadways, namely the Merritt Parkway, Wilbur Cross Parkway, Berlin Turnpike, Hartford Bypass, Charter Oak Bridge, and the new Wilbur Cross Highway, creating a modern, high-speed throughway from the New York state line to the Massachusetts state line. The Route 15 designation was applied to the previously unnumbered parkways from Greenwich to Meriden, then overlaid with US 5 through East Hartford, then designated on the western half of the Wilbur Cross Highway to Tolland, connecting with the portion previously designated as Route 15 five years before. The former Route 15 between South Windsor and Tolland was reassigned as an extension of Route 30, and the former Route 15 between New Haven and Glastonbury became redesignated as Route 17.

Further improvements in the Wilbur Cross Highway took place over the next several years and the road became a four-lane divided highway by 1954. In 1968, most of the Wilbur Cross Highway was designated as I-86 and further upgrades to the road were implemented. Route 15 and I-86 overlapped from the current 15/84 junction in East Hartford to the Massachusetts state line. In 1984, the overlap was removed, truncating Route 15 to its current northern end, while at the same time I-86 was redesignated as I-84.

<doc id="1339512" wikidata="Q6543521" url="?curid=1339512" title="Lico Reyes">
<text>Frederick B. Reyes (April 4, 1946 – August 20, 2019) was a Mexican-American actor and politician. Under the name Lico Reyes, he appeared in movies, commercials and a variety of political campaigns, most notably as the Democratic nominee for the United States House of Representatives in Texas&#x27;s 26th congressional district in 2004. Lico Reyes was a US Army veteran with an Honorable Discharge.

==Early life==
Reyers was born in Canatlán Municipality, Durango, Mexico. After arriving in the United States he began to study for the Jesuit Roman Catholic priesthood, but switched from seminary training to study agricultural engineering. He graduated from the University of Texas at Arlington, with a degree in Mathematics and double minors in civil engineering and computer programming. Reyes then continued his education by enrolling in Senior Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC). However, by the time he graduated the Vietnam War had finished, and he was not required as a second lieutenant. He joined the Texas State Guard, served several years and received an honorable discharge as company commander, captain (O-3) from the 105th Military Police Battalion, First Defense Group, Company C. He then enrolled in a four-year performing arts course to train as an actor.

He became a citizen of the United States on 14 December 1965.

==Later career==
Reyes worked in a number of different jobs, including nine years working for the Texas Department of Transportation (in a variety of roles), as an interpreter for the Dallas County Courthouse, a computer technician for the Federal Aviation Administration, and a civil engineer at the Texas Highway Department. He then served as a precinct chair in Tarrant County.

===Entertainment career===
Reyes, as his character &quot;Father Vito&quot;, a comedic parody of a priest, hosted a variety of different community access cable television programs and live events. He also had speaking roles in the 1988 made-for-TV film &quot;Pancho Barnes&quot;, 1990 Universal comedy &quot;Problem Child&quot;, and one episode of &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot;. He also appeared in many industrial films, television commercials and stage productions.

===Congressional campaign===
In 2004, Reyes was chosen as the Democratic Party&#x27;s nominee for Texas&#x27; 26th Congressional District. He received 89,809 votes, or 33%, behind Republican Michael C. Burgess with 66%. Burgess outspent Lico Reyes by ten times ($689,422) in his re-election campaign. Lico received 1,100 more votes than the next highest in North Texas. The second place was for Honorable US Congressman Martin Frost.

During his campaign he advanced the idea of working with Mexico to develop Mexico&#x27;s oil and gas resources with US technology and financial support, arguing that this would help bring down the cost of fuel, expand the economy in both countries and serve to decrease illegal immigration to the US. Mexico is believed to have the fifth largest untapped reserves of natural resources and is also the fifth largest oil and gas producer in the world.

<doc id="1339528" wikidata="Q6952782" url="?curid=1339528" title="NBC North Dakota">
<text>NBC North Dakota is a network of four television stations that serve most of central and western North Dakota, along with parts of South Dakota and Montana. All four stations are dual NBC/Fox affiliates, and the flagship station is KFYR-TV in Bismarck. All four are owned by Gray Media. Sister station KVLY-TV in Fargo/Grand Forks is also considered a member of the network covering eastern North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota, but originates its own programming and newscasts. Fox programming is also not shown on KVLY-TV. KVLY&#x27;s sister station CBS affiliate KXJB-LD is not available outside of the KVLY viewing area. In 2023 as part of a rebranding, all four stations rebranded under their respective call letters.

==Stations==
The network consists of four stations in the Bismarck/Minot market and one in the Fargo/Grand Forks market:
The four Bismarck/Minot/Dickinson/Williston market stations all identify as separate stations in their own right, but KMOT and KQCD are reckoned as semi-satellites of KFYR, and KUMV is a semi-satellite of KMOT. They all air the same syndicated programming, but also air separate commercials for their respective cities. KVLY-TV originates its own programming and newscasts, as it is located in the separate Fargo/Grand Forks media market.

KMOT and KUMV air separate weeknight newscasts, and simulcast KFYR&#x27;s other newscasts. The first 10 minutes of KUMV&#x27;s newscasts simulcast KMOT, while KUMV fills the remaining 20 minutes. KQCD airs a time-shifted feed of KFYR in Mountain Time for most of the day, apart from station identifications and commercials.

The network was founded by the Meyer family of Bismarck, which signed on KFYR radio in 1925. KFYR-TV, North Dakota&#x27;s second television station, signed on in 1953. Two years later, the Federal Communications Commission collapsed central and western North Dakota into one giant television market. The Meyers then signed on Williston&#x27;s KUMV in 1957, having bought it from the local owners who had won the license. The two stations formed the &quot;Meyer Television Network,&quot; with KFYR-TV as the flagship station. KMOT followed in 1958. KQCD was brought online in 1980, replacing a low-powered translator of KFYR-TV that had served Dickinson since the late 1960s.

The stations have always been NBC affiliates, though they all carried some ABC programming in off-hours until KBMY/KMCY signed on in 1986. Additionally, KUMV broke off to air occasional CBS programming until KXMD-TV signed on in 1969.

The Meyers owned the stations until 1997, when they sold their stations to Sunrise Television. Wicks Group bought the stations in 2002, and in turn sold its entire television group to Hoak Media in 2007. In turn, Hoak sold the majority of its stations, including the NBC North Dakota chain, to Gray Television in 2014.

Gray also owns KVLY-TV in Fargo; KVLY has been co-owned with the NBC North Dakota stations since 1995, when it was purchased by Meyer Broadcasting. KVLY shares news stories and sports programming with NBC North Dakota. KVLY&#x27;s sister station, CBS affiliate KXJB-LD, simulcasts KVLY&#x27;s newscasts and is housed in the same studio as KVLY, while the other NBC North Dakota stations air Fox on their second digital subchannels after purchasing the intellectual property of KNDX/KXND (now KNDB/KNDM) in 2013.

<text>Lincoln-Way Community High School District 210 is a school district in the southwest suburbs of Chicago. Created in 1951, the district serves the communities of New Lenox, Frankfort, Mokena, Manhattan, and small portions of Tinley Park, Orland Park and Homer Glen. The three schools comprising the district are Lincoln-Way Central High School, Lincoln-Way East High School, and Lincoln-Way West High School. A fourth high school, Lincoln-Way North High School, was closed at the end of the 2015–2016 school year as part of a deficit reduction plan. Lincoln-Way Central and Lincoln-Way West are located in New Lenox, Lincoln-Way East is located in Frankfort and Lincoln-Way North is in Frankfort Square. District 210 offices are located at Lincoln-Way Central.

== History ==

Each year the Lincoln-Way district continues to grow, gaining an average of 250 students per annum. Both Lincoln-Way Central and Lincoln-Way East are built to accommodate 3,750 students. While Lincoln-Way North and Lincoln-Way West are built to accommodate 2,500 students. During the 2007-2008 school year, Lincoln-Way East had over 4,100 students: causing massive overcrowding issues in classrooms and hallways.

On March 21, 2006, voters approved - by 20% - a proposal to build 2 new schools in the next three years. Lincoln-Way North opened to Freshmen, Sophomores, and Juniors in 2008. North is located in Frankfort at the corner of Vollmer Road and Harlem, serving Frankfort Square, parts of Mokena and Tinley Park. The mascot is the Lincoln-Way North Phoenix. Their colors are Vegas gold and black. Lincoln-Way West opened to the same classes in 2009 in New Lenox at Illinois Highway and Gougar Road. Their mascot is the Lincoln-Way West Warriors, with their new colors being orange and black.

All four Lincoln-Way High Schools are intended to have equal high-quality facilities to include: 2-6 lane, 25-yard swimming pools , state-of-the-art auditoriums, field houses, turf football fields, indoor and outdoor running tracks, large gymnasiums, lighted baseball and softball fields, as well as many other amenities. Lincoln-Way North and Lincoln-Way West are identical in design and amenities, however, each has a slightly different configuration. Both schools have 103 classrooms. Additionally, The Lincoln-Way North Auditorium is home to the Illinois Philharmonic Orchestra: the auditorium was built with the orchestra in mind and is fully soundproof with many other great features.

On August 13, 2015, the Lincoln-Way Community board of education voted to close Lincoln-Way North following slower than average growth and citing budget concerns. Lincoln-Way North was closed at the end of the 2015-2016 school year. The consolidated three-school district now comprises Lincoln-Way Central and Lincoln-Way West in New Lenox and Lincoln-Way East in Frankfort.

==Prairie State Achievement Exam==

In 2008 the Lincoln-Way High Schools placed in the top 6% of high schools for the Prairie State Achievement Exam (PSAE). Lincoln-Way East ranked 33 and Lincoln-Way Central ranked 44 out of the 654 public high schools in the state. Both are in the top 50 in the State of Illinois on the PSAE test, according to statistics in the Chicago Tribune. The PSAE measures the achievement of junior students relative to the Illinois Learning Standards. The two-day PSAE exam consists of the ACT, Work Keys and ISBE-developed tests. Lincoln-Way High School District 210 is also the lowest per pupil in operating cost in the six county Chicago metropolitan area. In 2007 the district schools were ranked in the top 9% of high schools in the State of Illinois. Lincoln-Way East and Lincoln-Way Central rank number one and two for the Will County schools.

<text>KFYR-TV (channel 5) is a television station in Bismarck, North Dakota, United States, affiliated with NBC and Fox. Owned by Gray Media, the station has studios on North 4th Street and East Broadway Avenue in downtown Bismarck, and its transmitter is located near St. Anthony, North Dakota.

KFYR-TV serves as the flagship station of [[NBC North Dakota]], a regional network of four stations relaying NBC network and other programming provided by KFYR across central and western North Dakota, as well as bordering counties in Montana and South Dakota. The three satellite stations clear all network and syndicated programming as provided through KFYR but air separate legal identifications and commercial inserts. KQCD-TV (channel 7) in Dickinson simulcasts all of KFYR&#x27;s programming, while KMOT (channel 10) in Minot also produces its own weekday local newscasts at 6 p.m. and 10 p.m., and KUMV-TV (channel 8) in Williston simulcasts KMOT&#x27;s newscasts with local inserts. The four stations are counted as a single unit for ratings purposes.

KFYR also serves as the only available NBC affiliate for central and western North Dakota for subscribers of Dish Network and DirecTV.

KFYR-TV was established in 1953 by the Meyer family as the first television station in Bismarck and third in the state. The Williston and Minot stations were set up in 1957 and 1958, with Dickinson being added in 1980. As with KFYR radio, &quot;Meyer Television&quot; became the market leader. The Meyer family owned KFYR-TV until it opted to exit broadcasting in the late 1990s; the stations have been sold four times since.

==History==

After the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) lifted its freeze on television station grants in 1952, Meyer Broadcasting Company filed for channel 5 in Bismarck on November 28, 1952. Also filing for channel 5 was M. B. Rudman, an oilman from Minot. In February 1953, Rudman changed his application to specify the other VHF channel in the city, channel 12, clearing the way for both groups to be granted construction permits on March 4.

From a temporary transmission facility atop the North Dakota State Capitol, KFYR-TV began broadcasting on December 19, 1953. It held affiliations with NBC and CBS; KFYR&#x27;s relationship with NBC in radio dated to 1931. The State Capitol transmitter, said to be the only one of its kind in the country, was replaced in 1954 by the permanent facility, a more typical mast east of Bismarck. A second television station came to Bismarck in 1955, KBMB-TV (channel 12, later changed to KXMB-TV), which was a CBS affiliate and served as an extension of KXJB-TV in Valley City and KCJB-TV in Minot. Earlier that year, KFYR-TV began broadcasting live network programming to Bismarck. KFYR-TV would continue to air some ABC programming until a full-time ABC service, KBMY, began broadcasting in 1985.

Meyer Broadcasting expanded its reach with the construction of two new stations in 1957 and 1958. The first application to be granted was that for channel 10 in Minot (KMOT-TV), in October 1955, and Meyer was unopposed in its bid for channel 8 at Williston (KUMV-TV), which was approved in 1956. Dickinson would have to wait much longer for its full-power station, KQCD, to begin in 1980. Local news inserts from Dickinson ended on December 31, 1991, with the station turning to rebroadcasting KFYR&#x27;s Bismarck news. In 1995, Meyer acquired KTHI-TV in Fargo, which it renamed KVLY-TV.

When Meyer opted to exit broadcasting in 1998, KFYR-TV and its associated stations were sold to Sunrise Television Corporation for $63.75 million; at that time, KFYR-TV accounted for 57 percent of all broadcast TV viewing in Bismarck. The sale separated KFYR radio and television, which at the time shared several on-air personalities and a news director. It was the first of several sales for KFYR-TV. In 2002, North Dakota Television LLC, a consortium of private equity firms The Wicks Group of Companies, JP Morgan Partners, and Halyard Capital acquired the KFYR system as well as KVLY-TV in Fargo. Hoak Media of Dallas acquired these stations, as well as KSFY-TV in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and its satellites in 2006.

The NBC North Dakota network picked up MeTV in April 2013, with an official launch date of May 1, 2013.

On November 20, 2013, Gray Television announced it would purchase Hoak Media in a $335 million deal. Gray initially planned, through Excalibur Broadcasting, to also acquire Fox affiliate KNDX/KXND for $7.5 million and operate them under a local marketing agreement. On March 25, 2014, Prime Cities Broadcasting, owner of KNDX/KXND, requested that the FCC dismiss the sale of that station to Excalibur. Gray would instead acquire the stations&#x27; non-license assets; upon the closure of the Hoak purchases on June 13, 2014, KNDX/KXND were shuttered and their Fox programs moved to subchannels of KFYR and its satellites.

==News operation==
KFYR&#x27;s newscasts have led the ratings in western North Dakota for as long as records have been kept. Early on, the Meyers devoted significant resources to KFYR&#x27;s news department, resulting in a higher-quality product than conventional wisdom would suggest for such a small market. This tradition has continued today. The station broadcasts local newscasts at 5 a.m., noon, 4 p.m., 5 p.m., 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. Central Time Monday through Friday; 6 and 10 p.m. on Saturday, and 5 and 10 p.m. on Sunday. KFYR-TV anchors include Monica Hannan and Alan Miller. &quot;Country Morning Today&quot;, &quot;Noon Report&quot;, and &quot;First News at 5:00&quot; are simulcast across the entire four-station network, along with all weekend newscasts.

While KFYR still dominates the television news scene, its dominance is not as absolute as it once was. In recent years, KX Television&#x27;s &quot;KX News Morning&quot; has consistently beaten &quot;Country Morning Today&quot;, often by wide margins. It is the only time in recent memory that NBC North Dakota has lost &quot;any&quot; time slot for more than one ratings period.

KMOT produces its own newscasts from Monday through Friday weekdays at 6 and 10 p.m., and rebroadcasts KFYR-TV&#x27;s other newscasts. KUMV airs its own newscasts from Monday through Friday at 6 and 10 p.m. The first 10 minutes (which includes regional news and weather) originate at KFYR in Bismarck. KUMV has its own news and sports anchor who fill the remaining 20 minutes. It simulcasts KFYR&#x27;s other newscasts. From 2002 to 2007, KMOT was forced to cut its newscasts to 20 minutes while simulcasting the first 10 minutes of KFYR-TV&#x27;s 6 and 10 p.m. newscasts, much as KUMV does now. In January 2007, KMOT began airing full 30-minute newscasts at 6 and 10 p.m. once again. It also added a weatherman and photographer/reporter to the staff.

KQCD once had its own news department consisting of bureau chief Brian Howell and reporter Cebe Schneider, whose stories aired on KFYR-TV&#x27;s newscasts. They were the only reporters based in southwestern North Dakota. However, they were let go in 2012 due to budget cutbacks. KQCD currently has a reporter that contributes to KFYR-produced newscasts.

The stations occasionally share stories with co-owned KVLY-TV. The five stations simulcast major North Dakota sporting events and statewide political debates under the NBC North Dakota brand name and share certain equipment, such as remote broadcasting vehicles. On April 30, 2012, NBC North Dakota began broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition.

KFYR-TV received international attention when newly hired weekend co-anchor A. J. Clemente uttered several obscenities during his first broadcast on April 21, 2013, after mispronouncing the name of London Marathon winner Tsegaye Kebede. Even though he was unaware he was on air, Clemente was immediately suspended from KFYR following that evening&#x27;s 5 p.m. newscast, according to a statement released by news director/anchor Monica Hannan. That night, co-anchor Van Tieu apologized on-air on behalf of the station. Hannan fired Clemente the following day, according to a post from his Twitter account. Clemente was mocked by David Letterman on the &quot;Late Show&quot;&#x27;s Top 10 List on April 23, 2013 (then appeared as a guest the following day). On April 24, 2013, Clemente appeared on &quot;Today&quot; to discuss the incident (seeking to redeem himself and hopeful for a second chance somewhere in addition to acknowledging he had no &#x27;animosity&#x27; about being fired by KFYR). The same day, he sought that &quot;second chance&quot; with an opportunity to speak on &quot;Inside Edition&quot;.

The Fox-affiliated subchannel debuted &quot;West Dakota Fox News at Nine&quot; during October 2014, originating from KFYR&#x27;s studios in Bismarck.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KFYR-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 5, on February 16, 2009, the day prior to the original date on which full-power television stations in the United States were set to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which was later rescheduled for June 12, 2009). The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 31, using virtual channel 5.

===Satellite stations===
KFYR-TV serves one of the largest markets in the country. It extends its over-the-air coverage area through a network of three full-power stations encompassing much of the western and central two-thirds of North Dakota and parts of eastern Montana and northwestern South Dakota, branded as NBC North Dakota.

These stations mostly rebroadcast KFYR. However, they all identify as separate stations in their own right, and air separate station identifications and local commercials, as well as different programming if desired. KMOT produces its own local 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. newscasts on weekdays, while KUMV airs 20-minute local inserts into KMOT&#x27;s newscasts. KQCD airs a time-shifted feed of KFYR in Mountain Time for most of the day, except for identifications and commercials.

<text>KMOT (channel 10) is a television station in Minot, North Dakota, United States, affiliated with NBC and Fox. The station is owned by Gray Media, and maintains studios and transmitter facilities at the intersection of 16th Street and 18th Avenue SW in Minot.

KMOT is one of two full-fledged NBC stations in the [[NBC North Dakota]] regional network of NBC affiliates in central and western North Dakota, along with flagship station KFYR-TV (channel 5) in Bismarck. The NBC North Dakota network relays NBC network and other programming across central and western North Dakota, as well as bordering counties in Montana and South Dakota. The four stations along with fellow NBC affiliate KVLY-TV in Fargo often share news stories. Master control and some internal operations of KMOT are based at KFYR&#x27;s facilities on North 4th Street and East Broadway Avenue in downtown Bismarck. The four stations are counted as a single unit for ratings purposes.

KMOT also operates a semi-satellite in Williston, North Dakota, [[KUMV-TV]] (channel 8), which airs local advertising and weekday newscast inserts focusing on the northwestern portion of the Minot–Bismarck market, but otherwise airs the same programming as KMOT. Although operated as a separate station in its own right, KMOT is actually considered a semi-satellite of KFYR-TV in Bismarck, which also has semi-satellite KQCD-TV (channel 7) in Dickinson. It clears all network and syndicated programming as provided through its parent but airs separate local newscasts, legal identifications, and commercial inserts. KFYR and KQCD serve the southern portion of the Bismarck–Minot/Dickinson–Williston market while KMOT and KUMV serve the northern portion.

The over-the-air signal of KMOT reaches portions of the Canadian province of Saskatchewan, but is no longer available on any cable systems there.

Dish Network and DirecTV only provide only KFYR as central and western North Dakota&#x27;s NBC affiliate.

==History==
KMOT signed on January 23, 1958, as the third station in the Meyer group, after KFYR-TV and KUMV-TV. KUMV, which signed on a year earlier as a semi-satellite of KFYR, became a semi-satellite of KMOT. Until KBMY/KMCY signed on in 1986, the Meyer stations carried a secondary affiliation with ABC. Until KXMD-TV signed on in 1969, KUMV would break away from KMOT to carry select CBS programs.

The Meyers sold off their broadcast holdings in 1997, with the television stations going to Sunrise Television Corporation. Sunrise sold them to The Wicks Group of Companies of New York City in 2002.

Hoak Media bought KFYR-TV, KMOT, KUMV, and KQCD in July 2006, as well as KVLY-TV in Fargo and KSFY in Sioux Falls, South Dakota and its satellite stations. On November 17, 2006, the sale was approved by the FCC.

On January 19, 2009, KMOT began operation as a digital-only station on its existing channel frequency.

KMOT picked up MeTV in April 2013, with an official launch date of May 1, 2013.

On November 20, 2013, Hoak announced the sale of most of its stations, including KMOT, to Gray Television. Gray initially planned, through Excalibur Broadcasting, to also acquire Fox affiliate KXND from Prime Cities Broadcasting and operate it under a shared services agreement, which would have made it a sister station to KMOT. On March 25, 2014, Prime Cities Broadcasting requested that the FCC dismiss the sale of KXND to Excalibur; Gray would instead acquire the non-license assets of KXND, as well as the license of Williston repeater KXND-LP. The sale of the Hoak stations was completed on June 13; at that time, Gray shut down KXND&#x27;s full-power signal and moved Fox programming to the second digital subchannel of KMOT.

==Newscasts==

KMOT produces its own newscasts from Monday through Friday weekdays at 6 and 10 p.m., and rebroadcasts KFYR-TV&#x27;s other newscasts.

KUMV airs its own newscasts from Monday through Friday at 6 and 10 p.m. The first 10 minutes (which includes regional news and weather) originate at KMOT. KUMV has its own news and sports anchor who fill the remaining 20 minutes. It simulcasts KMOT/KFYR&#x27;s other newscasts.

From 2002 to 2007, KMOT was forced to cut its newscasts to 20 minutes while simulcasting the first 10 minutes of KFYR-TV&#x27;s 6 and 10 p.m. newscasts, much as KUMV does now. In January 2007, KMOT began airing full 30-minute newscasts at 6 and 10 p.m. once again. It also added a weatherman and photographer/reporter to the staff.

The stations occasionally share stories with co-owned KVLY-TV. The five stations simulcast major North Dakota sporting events and statewide political debates under the NBC North Dakota brand name and share certain equipment, such as remote broadcasting vehicles. On April 30, 2012, NBC North Dakota began broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition.

NBC North Dakota has long dominated the ratings in western North Dakota as a whole; the main stations and their semi-satellites count as one station for ratings and regulatory purposes. However, KMOT has spent most of its history as a distant runner-up to KXMC-TV in the northern half of the market.

The Fox-affiliated subchannel debuted &quot;West Dakota Fox News at Nine&quot; during October 2014, originating from KFYR&#x27;s studios in Bismarck.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KMOT shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 10, on January 19, 2009. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 58, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to its analog-era VHF channel 10 for post-transition operations.

<text>Clinton Hubert Morrison (&quot;né&quot; Chambers; born 14 May 1979) is a former professional footballer and sports pundit.

As a player, he was a forward. He notably played in the Premier League for both Crystal Palace and Birmingham City. He also played in the Football League for Coventry City, Sheffield Wednesday, Milton Keynes Dons, Brentford, Colchester United and Exeter City. He also played non-league football for Long Eaton United, Redditch United and Mickleover Sports.

Born in England, he represented the Republic of Ireland 36 times at full international level, scoring 9 goals, and made their squad for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. He is now a regular reporter and occasional pundit on &quot;Sky Sports Soccer Saturday&quot;.

==Club career==
===First spell at Crystal Palace===
Born in Tooting, London, Morrison began his career as a trainee at Crystal Palace on 1 August 1997. Morrison was previously at Tottenham Hotspur before they let him go at sixteen. Before his time at Spurs, he had played junior football for Raynes Park Vale FC (which was formerly known as Malden Vale FC).

He began his career at Crystal Palace of the Premier League, making his debut on 10 May 1998 as an 82nd-minute substitute for Neil Shipperley, and scoring the injury-time winner over opponents Sheffield Wednesday.

At the start of the 1998–99 season, Morrison appeared in the second leg of the UEFA Intertoto Cup third round against Samsunspor, eventually losing 4–0 on aggregate. He then scored two goals against Bury in two separate matches on 23 September 1998 and 30 September 1998. Morrison quickly became a first team regular for the club, becoming Crystal Palace&#x27;s first choice striker. He later scored three braces on three separate occasions as the 1998–99 season progressed. In his first full year-long tenure at the club he scored 13 goals, while Palace were struggling both on and off the pitch. Whilst they were in administration, Morrison agreed to play for the club for free.

In the 1999–2000 season, Morrison&#x27;s goal scoring form continued, totalling six goals in the first two months to the season. However, he suffered an injury that kept him for the rest of the year. Following his return, Morrison&#x27;s goal scoring form continued for the rest of the 1999–2000 season, including his only brace of the season at Swindon Town. Financial difficulties meant that Crystal Palace were unable to make new signings for the 1999–2000 season and relied on youngsters such as Morrison and Hayden Mullins and veterans such as Andy Linighan as they successfully battled against relegation from the First Division. At the end of the 1999–00 season, he played more than 30 games, and scored 14 goals, making him the club&#x27;s top scorer once again.

At the start of the 2000–01 season, Morrison, however, was placed on a transfer list by new Manager Alan Smith despite signing a four–year contract with Crystal Palace. Nevertheless, he continued to establish himself in the striker position, forming a partnership with either Dougie Freedman and Mikael Forssell. Having only scored three goals by mid–October, Morrison began to score six goals in five appearances between 28 October 2000 and 18 November 2000, including a brace against Wolverhampton Wanderers. His goal scoring form continued throughout December, scoring a total of six. His performance at the club attracted interests from Premiership clubs. Amid the transfer speculation, he scored in the first leg of the semi-final of the League Cup, winning 2–1 against Liverpool, but the club eventually lost 5–0 in the return leg, eliminating Crystal Palace from the tournament. Following this, however, Morrison&#x27;s goal scoring form soon dipped, only scoring three more goals. Nevertheless, his involvement in the first team helped the club narrowly escaped relegation. At the end of the 2000–01, he went on to score 19 goals, making him Crystal Palace&#x27;s top scorer for the third season in a row.

At the start of the 2001–02 season, Morrison&#x27;s goal scoring form continued to go well when he scored eight goals in the first two months to the season. His performance in a number of matches was praised by Manager Steve Bruce. Morrison continued to regain his first team place as Crystal Palace&#x27;s first choice striker throughout the 2001–02 season. He then scored five goals, including a brace against Bradford City and Norwich City throughout October. Morrison later added three goals by the end of the year. In the first three months of 2002, he added more goals to his tally by scoring five times, including a brace against Gillingham on 16 January 2002. His performance was praised by new Manager Trevor Francis. The following month, Morrison scored a total of three goals in five appearances. Despite being sidelined with injuries during the 2001–02 season, Morrison finished the season, making forty–nine appearances and scoring twenty–four times, making him Crystal Palace&#x27;s top scorer for the fourth time in a row. For his performance, he finished second place behind Freedman for the club&#x27;s Player of the Year.

===Birmingham City===
Over the summer transfer of 2002, Morrison was linked a move away from Crystal Palace, with Premier League clubs, including Birmingham City, were interested in signing him. But Manager Trevor Francis was willing to sell the player if the club signed a replacement, although Simon Jordan objected to this. With a tricky relationship becoming clear between Morrison and Trevor Francis, then Palace manager, it was Birmingham City who fought and won his signature, for £4.25 million, in exchange for Andrew Johnson.

However, his start to his Birmingham City&#x27;s career suffered a setback when he sustained a groin injury during the club&#x27;s pre–season that saw him miss two matches. Morrison made his debut for Birmingham City, coming on as an 81st-minute substitute, in a 1–1 draw against Everton on 28 August 2002. It wasn&#x27;t until on 11 September 2002 when he scored his first goals, in a 2–2 draw against Liverpool. This was followed up by scoring his third goal for the club against Aston Villa, their first win in 16 years following their return to the top flight, during a 3–0 victory at St. Andrews. His fourth goal for Birmingham City came on 23 November 2002, in a 1–0 win against Sunderland. During a 1–0 win against Fulham on 15 December 2002, in which Morrison set up the only goal of the game, he was involved in an argument with Rufus Brevett that his mother got involved following the match, though both clubs said the incident never happened. After missing one match due to injury, he scored on two weeks after his return from injury, in a 4–2 loss against Bolton Wanderers on 1 February 2003. Three weeks later, Morrison scored for the second time this season against Liverpool on 23 February 2003, in a 2–1 win. However, he dislocated his shoulder during a 1–0 win against West Bromwich Albion on 22 March 2003 and was sidelined for the rest of the 2002–03 season. In his first season at Birmingham City, Morrison became a first team regular, becoming the club&#x27;s first choice striker but struggled somewhat in the top league, scoring only six goals in twenty–nine appearances.

Morrison made his first appearance of the 2003–04 season, coming on as an 81st-minute substitute, in a 0–0 draw against Southampton on 23 August 2003. Since returning to the first team, he found himself behind the pecking order and played as Birmingham City&#x27;s second striker. It wasn&#x27;t until on 13 December 2003 when Morrison scored his first goal of the season, in a 2–0 win against Leicester City. He later scored four more goals, including scoring two goals in two consecutive matches against Charlton Athletic and Wolverhampton Wanderers. Despite not able to produce goals as done before, Morrison&#x27;s commitment and hard work were praised by his teammates. At the end of the 2003–04 season, he made thirty–seven appearances and scoring five times in all competitions.

At the start of the 2004–05 season, Morrison was sidelined with a knee injury while on international duty and was sidelined for a month. It wasn&#x27;t until on 28 August 2004 when he returned to the first team, coming on as a 72nd-minute substitute, in a 1–0 loss against Tottenham Hotspur. Since returning from injury, Morrison rotated in and out of the starting line–up, but around the same time, he began to form a decent strike partnership with Emile Heskey. It wasn&#x27;t until on 21 September 2004 when Morrison scored his first goal of the season, in a 3–1 win against Lincoln City in the third round of the League Cup. However, he suffered a knee injury while on international duty and was sidelined for a month. It wasn&#x27;t until on 21 November 2004 when Morrison returned to the starting line–up against Blackburn Rovers and played 65 minutes before being substituted, as Birmingham City drew 3–3. In a follow–up match against Norwich City, he scored his second goal of the season, in a 1–1 draw. He then scored three goals in three consecutive matches between 12 December 2004 and 26 December 2004. Following a 2–1 loss against Bolton Wanderers on 4 January 2005, Morrison was charged by the FA for his improper conduct and was expected to serve a one match suspension; instead, he was fined and warned of the conduct. On 14 January 2005, Morrison began talks with Birmingham City over a new contract. Following this, he continued to rotate in and out of the starting line–up as the 2004–05 season progressed. At the end of the 2004–05 season, Morrison made twenty–nine appearances and scoring five times in all competitions.

Due to pressure for first team places, Morrison wanted to leave Birmingham City to get first team football. As a result, he was linked with a move away from the club, as Norwich City and Southampton were interested in signing him. Amid the transfer speculation, Morrison made his only appearance of the 2005–06 season, in a 0–0 draw against Fulham in the opening game of the season.

===Return to Crystal Palace===
Morrison left Birmingham on 24 August 2005 to return to Crystal Palace after they agreed a £2 million fee for the 26-year-old. He claimed that a large part of his decision to return (besides his love for the club) was, ironically, due to being able to play alongside Andrew Johnson, the man Birmingham had originally swapped to get Morrison.

Morrison made his second Crystal Palace debut, coming on as a 75th-minute substitute, in a 2–0 win against Stoke City on 27 August 2005. He then scored in the next two matches against Hull City and Reading. Morrison went on to score six goals by the end of the year, including two braces on two separate occasions. Since returning to the club, Morrison had a successful first season back at Crystal Palace, alternating with former strike-partner Dougie Freedman in playing alongside Johnson. He then made his 200th appearance for the club, starting the match and played 82 minutes before being substituted, in a 1–1 draw against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 10 December 2005. Morrison later scored five more goals later in the 2005–06 season. Having aimed at personal target to get back to the Premier League, he later helped Crystal Palace qualify for the Championship Play–Offs despite missing one match, due to a broken jaw. However, Morrison only played in the first leg of the play–offs, as the club lost 3–0 on aggregate against Watford. In his first season back at Crystal Palace, he made forty–four appearances and scoring twelve times in all competitions. Throughout the 2005–06 season, there were reports over claims that Morrison was involved in a bust up with Manager Iain Dowie. Your Local Guardian said that &quot;We haven&#x27;t seen the best from Morrison due to the lack of games he has been given, but Clinton is Mr Crystal Palace. He love this club and when AJ leaves us it&#x27;ll be the partnership of Morrison and Freedman who will be firing us back into the Premiership.&quot;

At the start of the 2006–07 season, Morrison scored his first goal of the season, in a 1–0 win against Leeds United on 13 August 2006. After the match, Manager Peter Taylor praised his performance despite lacking fitness that saw him placed on the substitute bench. His second goal of the season came a month later on 23 September 2006, in a 1–0 win against Coventry City. However, he found himself in a rift with Manager Peter Taylor that saw him placed on the substitute bench. But Crystal Palace&#x27;s chairman Simon Jordan responded to the claims that the pair had not fallen out, with Taylor having dealt with Morrison over their differences. He then managed to regain his first team place, making a number of starts as the club&#x27;s first choice striker for the rest of the 2006. Morrison then added four more goals by the end of the year. This lasted until January when he found himself placed on the substitute bench, appearing in the club&#x27;s four out of the club&#x27;s six matches during the month. By February, Morrison regained his first team place as Crystal Palace&#x27;s first choice striker once again. Towards the end of the 2006–07 season, Morrison scored six more goals, including three goals in two consecutive matches against Luton Town and Burnley. Despite failing to help the club reach the play–offs, he expressed his desire to stay at Crystal Palace. At the end of the 2006–07 season, Morrison went on to make forty–four appearances and scoring twelve times in all competitions, making him as the club&#x27;s top scorer for the fifth time in his Crystal Palace&#x27;s career.

Ahead of the 2007–08 season, Morrison was given a number ten shirt at the club once again, having wore the number shirt in his first career at the club. He started the season brightly scoring twice in the first three games, taking himself to 99 goals in his Palace career. However, Morrison&#x27;s target to score his 100th goal in his Crystal Palace&#x27;s career became an albatross round his neck, and manager Peter Taylor dropped him from the starting line-up for several games. It was under new manager Neil Warnock that Morrison eventually scored his 100th Crystal Palace goal in the London derby against Queens Park Rangers (a club he has a knack for scoring against) on 10 November 2007, with an 88th-minute equaliser, making him the eighth player in the club&#x27;s history to reach this milestone. Two years ago, Morrison said his aim was to score 100 goals for Crystal Palace. He was given a &quot;Special Achievement Award&quot; to mark this feat at the end of the season&#x27;s &quot;Player of the Year&quot; ceremony. Despite suffering a knee injury, Morrison quickly recovered and scored a brace, in a 2–1 win against Colchester United on 24 November 2007. After breaking the 100th goal deadlock for the club, Morrison hit a purple patch of scoring, including five goals by the end of 2007. He then scored three goals in three consecutive matches between 1 January 2008 and 19 January 2008 against Norwich City, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Bristol City. His performance was praised by Warnock. He later finished his Crystal Palace&#x27;s career with 113 goals in all competitions for the club, the fifth-highest of any player in the Crystal Palace&#x27;s history. He scored on the final day of the 2007–08 season in a 5–0 win over Burnley that confirmed the club&#x27;s play-off place, meaning that he had scored in his first and last league games for Crystal Palace. Morrison played in both legs of the Championship play–offs against Bristol City, as the club lost 4–2 on aggregate. At the end of the 2007–08 season, he went on to make forty–seven appearances and scoring sixteen times in all competitions, making , making him as Crystal Palace&#x27;s top scorer for the sixth time in his club career.

This was Morrison&#x27;s last season at Crystal Palace, with his contract expiring at the end of the season. Morrison wanted to stay at Palace but manager Neil Warnock said that he would have to fight for his place in the starting line-up. Morrison then took a higher wage offer to move to Coventry City after the club withdrew the contract offer for him.

===Coventry City===
In July 2008, Morrison trained with Coventry City and accompanied them on their pre-season tour of Switzerland. He signed a two-year deal with the club on 7 August 2008. Upon joining Coventry City, Morrison wore the number 19 shirt during the 2008–09 season with a plus sign between the 1 and 9 (appearing on the back of his shirt as 1+9). The reason for this being that 1+9 equals 10, which was the number Morrison played with whilst at Palace.

Initially, Morrison suffered an injury while training but quickly recovered. He made his debut for the club in the opening game of the season against Norwich City and set up the second goal of the game, in a 2–0 win. Morrison followed up by scoring two goals in the League Cup matches against Aldershot Town and Newcastle United. Since joining Coventry City, Morrison quickly became a first team regular for the side, forming a partnership with Freddy Eastwood.

Having failed to score for the club for the next two months, he scored three goals in three consecutive matches between 25 October 2008 and 3 November 2008 against Derby County, Southampton and Birmingham City. Having expressed confidence of scoring more goals, Morrison scored five more goals by the end of the year. As the 2008–09 season progressed, he also captained the club in a number of matches in the absence of Scott Dann and given full time by April. Despite only scoring two more goals, Morrison remained Coventry City&#x27;s top scorer at the end of the 2008–09 season with thirteen times. Although he missed one match during the season, Morrison made fifty–two appearances in all competitions.

Initially, Morrison wanted the number ten shirt ahead of the 2009–10 season. Instead, he changed to wearing number eleven shirt. Morrison started the season well when he scored twice against Ipswich Town and once against Barnsley. A month later, Morrison scored three consecutive goals between 15 September 2009 and 26 September 2009 against Sheffield United, Preston North End and Middlesbrough. Since the start of the 2009–10 season, he continued to regain his first team place as Coventry City&#x27;s first choice striker. By December, Morrison found his playing time, mostly coming from the substitute bench and proved to have worked, as he scored three goals between 26 December 2009 and 16 January 2010 to end his goal drought. However, Morrison expressed his concerns over his reputation as a super sub. He later scored two more goals in the 2009–10 season.

Despite suffering from an injury along the way, he appeared in every league match, making forty–nine appearances and scoring eleven times in all competitions, making him the top scorer once again. At the end of the 2009–10 season, Morrison said he was keen to sign a new contract with the club, but Coventry City told him he was surplus to requirements and he was subsequently released.

===Sheffield Wednesday===
On 12 July 2010, Morrison signed a two-year contract with Sheffield Wednesday, newly relegated to League One.

Morrison scored on his league debut for the Owls in a 2–0 win over Dagenham &amp; Redbridge in the opening game of the season. His second goal for the club came on 28 August 2010, in a 5–0 win against Hartlepool United. Since joining the Owls, he has been involved in the first team, becoming the club&#x27;s first choice striker despite facing new competitions along the way. Morrison went on to score five more goals by the end of the year, including a brace against Southport on 7 November 2010. By the second half of the season, he added four more goals, including another brace against Hereford United on 29 January 2011. However, Morrison struggled to keep his place in the team towards the end of the season after new manager Gary Megson arrived, as Gary Madine and loan signing Neil Mellor kept him out of the side. At the end of the 2010–11 season, he went on to make forty–three appearances and scoring eleven times in all competitions.

At the start of the 2011–12 season, Morrison continued to remain involved in the first team, starting in eight out of the eleven matches for Sheffield Wednesday. He then scored two goals for the club, coming against Blackburn Rovers and Charlton Athletic. Morrison also contributed two assists, coming against Notts County and Milton Keynes Dons (which he ironically joined). Despite his involvement, Manager Megson placed him on a transfer list and expected the player to leave. But following his return from a loan spell at Milton Keynes Dons, Morrison made his first appearance for Sheffield Wednesday for the first time in a month, against Wycombe Wanderers on 29 October 2011, coming on as a 76th-minute substitute, as the club won 2–1. He then set up goal for Chris O&#x27;Grady to score the only goal of the game against West Ham United to send Sheffield Wednesday through to the next round. Three weeks later on 28 January 2012, Morrison scored his third goal for the club, in a 1–1 draw against Blackpool in the fourth round of the FA Cup. However, he continued to have his playing time from the substitute bench. At the end of the 2011–12 season, Morrison made twenty–six appearances and scoring three times for Sheffield Wednesday in all competitions.

It was announced on 16 May 2012 that Sheffield Wednesday released Morrison at the end of the 2011–12 season. He previously waive his right to a new contract in order to help the club win promotion.

====Loan Spells from Milton Keynes Dons====
On 24 September 2011, Morrison signed for Milton Keynes Dons on a one-month emergency loan. On the same day, he made his debut for the club, coming on as 58th-minute substitute, in a 0–0 draw against Bury. On his third appearance for the Dons, Morrison scored his first goal for the club, against Notts County on 1 October 2011, as well as making one assist. This was followed up by scoring in the next two matches against Oldham Athletic and Bournemouth. Despite keen on staying at Milton Keynes Dons, Morrison returned to his parent club after they demanded more money from Dons in order to allow him to stay further. By the time he left the club, he made six appearances and scoring three times for the side.

Morrison joined League One club Brentford on 24 March 2012 on loan until the end of the season. He made his debut for the club two days later, coming on as an 82nd-minute substitute, in a 2–0 win against Rochdale. Morrison later made eight appearances for Brentford.

===Colchester United===
On 16 July 2012, Morrison signed a two-year deal with League One side Colchester United following his release from Sheffield Wednesday. Upon joining the club, he was given a number nine shirt for the new season.

Morrison went on to make his debut for the U&#x27;s in a 3–0 League Cup defeat away at Yeovil Town, before leading the line to begin the new Football League season four days later in a 0–0 draw at Deepdale against Preston North End. His first goal for Colchester arrived towards the end of August in the third game of the season, as his late equaliser salvaged a 1–1 draw for the U&#x27;s; their third successive draw to start the season. He celebrated the goal by running the length of the pitch with his hands cupped behind his ears to taunt the Sheffield United fans who, throughout the game, had been doing likewise to the striker for his connections with their city rivals, Wednesday. Joe Dunne took over as the U&#x27;s boss at the end of September and immediately brought in Jabo Ibehre on loan from Milton Keynes Dons, with the loanee displacing Morrison from the starting eleven and consigning him to the bench. Dunne&#x27;s fourth game in charge was a Football League Trophy defeat to Northampton Town where Morrison was handed a start, but he was dismissed for violent conduct in the closing stages of the game which would suspend the striker for three matches after the club decided against appealing his ban. The impressive form of Ibehre ensured that Morrison only started four more games for the U&#x27;s until March, when injury to Freddie Sears created a hole in attack. This was coupled with Ibehre receiving a three-match suspension and Morrison went on to spearhead the U&#x27;s attack once more, providing crucial experience in Colchester&#x27;s bid for League One survival. In his fourth successive start, he notched his second U&#x27;s goal in a 2–1 win away at Bury; a vital match-winning goal in a crunch relegation fixture. The club went on secure safety on the final day of the season with a 2–0 win at Carlisle United finishing in 20th place. At the end of the 2012–13 season, Morrison went on to make thirty–five appearances and scoring two times in all competitions.

However at the start of the 2013–14 season, injuries and competitions limited Morrison&#x27;s first team opportunities. Following the absence of Ibehre, he began to appear in the starting eleven in a number of matches for Colchester United, while also trying to score goals on a regular basis. Despite not able to score as expected, his performance was praised nevertheless by Manager Dunne. Morrison registered his first goal of the 2013–14 campaign on 30 November, scoring an injury-time consolation goal against Tranmere Rovers at Prenton Park to bring his U&#x27;s tally to three goals in 50 appearances in all competitions. He scored his second of the season late-on during a 3–0 win against Gillingham on 11 January 2014. As the 2013–14 season progressed, Morrison continued to remain involved in the first team despite being placed on the substitute bench. He played his final game for the U&#x27;s in their 1–0 away victory over Walsall on 3 May 2014. At the end of the 2013–14 season, Morrison made thirty–six appearances and scoring two times in all competitions.

Morrison announced in the latter stages of the season that he would leave Colchester once his contract expired in the summer.

===Later career===
Morrison played three matches for Long Eaton United in the Midland League, scoring once himself and also dummying Lye Town&#x27;s goalkeeper into letting a backpass into the net, before signing for League Two club Exeter City in November 2014 on non-contract terms.

Morrison made his Exeter City debut, coming on as a 67th-minute substitute, in a 1–1 draw against Burton Albion on 6 December 2014. On 15 January 2015, it was announced that he would stay at the club for the rest of the 2014–15 season. Since joining Exeter City, he found his playing time, mostly from the substitute bench. Despite this, his starts in attacks at the starting eleven saw him assisted five times, including two consecutive separate assists. Morrison played 25 league matches in what remained of the season, and was then released, but rejoined the club on a short-term deal ahead of the 2015–16 campaign.

Following his three appearances at the start of the season, Morrison&#x27;s with stay at Exeter City was extended beyond its initial one-month period. He then contributed four assists, including a brace against Accrington Stanley on 19 September 2015. A month later on 11 October 2015, Morrison scored his first goal for the club, in a 3–3 draw against Stevenage. A month later on 8 November 2015, he scored his second goal for Exeter City, as well as, setting up one of the club&#x27;s goals, in a 3–0 win against Didcot Town in the FA Cup match. It was announced on 31 December 2015 that Morrison signed a contract extension with Exeter City until the end of the season. However, his first team appearances was later restricted to the substitute bench, resulting in making twenty–five appearances and scoring two times in all competitions. Morrison was released by Exeter City at the end of the 2015–16 season and duly signed for Southern Premier Division side Redditch United in June 2016.

In September 2016, Morrison joined Mickleover Sports. He made his debut for the club, starting a match and played 79 minutes before being substituted, in a match against Stourbridge. A year later, Morrison joined the club as their first team coach, having earned himself a UEFA B license coaching badge. In doing so, he quietly announced his retirement from professional football.

==International career==
Apart from England, the country of his birth, Morrison was also eligible to represent Jamaica and the Republic of Ireland. Initially interested to play for England, he chose to play for Ireland, qualifying for that country because his grandmother was from Dublin.

In May 2001, Morrison was called up to the Republic of Ireland U21 squad for the first time. He went on to make two appearances for the U21 side.

===Republic of Ireland===
In August 2001, Morrison was called up to the senior team squad for the first time. Morrison made his debut for Ireland in a 2–2 draw on 15 August 2001 against Croatia; he entered the game as a 52nd-minute substitute and scored the national side&#x27;s second goal of the game. Morrison then played in the second leg of World Cup Play–Off against Iran, coming on as a 75th-minute substitute, as Ireland went on to win 2–1 on aggregate to qualify for the World Cup. He later describe playing in Iran as &quot;one of the craziest atmospheres he ever played in&quot;.

Morrison then scored his second national goal, in a 3–0 win against Denmark on 27 March 2002 when &quot;his pace and directness continued to cause the Danish defence problems and, in injury time Colin Healy and David Connolly combined to leave him a chance which he side-footed in&quot;. He was selected by Mick McCarthy as part of the Republic of Ireland squad for the 2002 World Cup in South Korea and Japan. However, he did not play. Morrison&#x27;s international career began to gain momentum during his time at Birmingham City. He scored his first competitive international goal in a 4–2 European Championship qualifying defeat to Russia in Moscow in September 2002. The next two years saw Morrison scored two more goals for Republic of Ireland in a friendly match against Scotland and Australia.

Morrison later became a key part of the side as the Republic of Ireland competed for a place at World Cup 2006. He scored three goals in the qualifying campaign, but Brian Kerr&#x27;s side finished fourth in a tight group that included Switzerland, France and Israel. At one point during the qualifying campaign, Morrison accused Alexander Frei of making a racist comment to him during the Switzerland and Republic of Ireland match on 9 September 2004. Frei refuted Morrison&#x27;s claim, and no sanctions were levied against Frei.

Despite scoring in 11 out of 14 games for Palace, Morrison was not called into the Ireland squad to face Brazil in a friendly in February 2008. However, his continued good form with Palace led to him being recognised by Ireland coach Giovanni Trapattoni in his first provisional 40-man squad, though he did not make it to the 28-man squad. Following this, Morrison was never featured in the national team squad and ended his international career, making thirty–six appearances and scoring nine times.

==Media career==
Morrison did some media work as a pundit on Sky Sports and Football League Tonight on Channel 5.

In September 2020, Sky Sports announced Morrison as their new pundit for Soccer Saturday.

He is a regular match pundit for live commentary on BBC 5 Live.

==Personal life==
Growing up, Morrison supported Tottenham Hotspur, but idolised Ian Wright. He revealed in an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; that he &quot;grew up in a broken home in south London&quot; with his mother and sister. Morrison was known as Clinton Chambers before changing his surname when he was 15. The impetus for the change was his father walking out on the family when Morrison was seven years old, leaving his mother to raise two children alone.

Morrison later credited his mother for being a big influence in his life, saying: &quot;She did everything for me, my Mum. Everything. She kept me in school when I didn&#x27;t want no lessons, she brought me to games, she kept my chin up. I don&#x27;t think I would have turned bad, doing crimes and that. It&#x27;s not me, not the way I am, but in the same way I don&#x27;t know what would have happened. There was a lot of crime going on.&quot; Clinton is a father to two boys; one of whom is following in his footsteps and is signed to Nottingham Forest Academy. He since resided in Long Eaton, while also working in broadcasting.

Morrison has been involved in campaigning against racism in English football, having experienced racism himself. During his professional football career he was a mentor to some footballers, including Patrick van Aanholt.

In August 2003, Morrison was questioned by police on suspicion of illegal drug possession but did not face charges after questioning.

<text>KVLY-TV (channel 11) is a television station in Fargo, North Dakota, United States, affiliated with NBC. It is owned by Gray Media alongside KXJB-LD (channel 30), a low-power CBS and CW affiliate. The two stations share studios on 21st Avenue South in Fargo; KVLY-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located near Blanchard. In addition to its main studio in Fargo, KVLY-TV operates a news bureau and sales office in the US Bank building in downtown Grand Forks.

Channel 11 began broadcasting on October 11, 1959. It was built by John Boler, the owner of KXJB-TV, and served as little more than a passthrough for ABC programming in the immediate Fargo–Moorhead area. After being sold to the Polaris Corporation in 1962, the station was overhauled and turned into a full-service station with local programming. In February 1964, it began broadcasting from its current tower—which at one time was the tallest structure in the world—and changed its call sign to KTHI-TV. The expanded-coverage station supplanted the co-owned KNOX-TV in Grand Forks, but it was a distant third-place in local news ratings under Morgan Murphy Stations, which owned KTHI-TV from 1969 to 1995. In 1983, KTHI-TV became an NBC affiliate after ABC moved to the market-leading WDAY-TV and WDAZ-TV.

In 1995, Meyer Television acquired KTHI-TV, bringing it under the same umbrella as KFYR-TV in Bismarck. The station changed its call sign to KVLY-TV. Under Meyer and a procession of owners in the 1990s and early 2000s, KVLY moved from third to second place in local news. In 2003, most operations of KXJB-TV were consolidated with KVLY-TV under a local marketing agreement, culminating in the 2007 establishment of full simulcast news under the name &quot;Valley News Live&quot;. When Gray Television acquired KVLY-TV in 2014, it could not inherit the agreement to operate KXJB-TV, resulting in the CBS affiliation moving to a subchannel of KVLY and, eventually, new low-power stations.

==History==
===Early years (1959–1968)===
Channel 13, not 11, was originally assigned to Fargo. This changed in December 1953 after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) received a petition from a civic group in Bemidji, Minnesota, seeking the assignment of channel 13 there. This prompted a consortium of two local radio stations, KFGO in Fargo and KVOX in Moorhead, Minnesota, to abandon their plans for the station.

Interest was rekindled in January 1957 when the Fargo Telecasting Company, controlled by Marvin Kratter of New York, applied for channel 11. That application was followed five months later by one from the North Dakota Broadcasting Company (NDBC), controlled by John Boler. Among Boler&#x27;s holdings was KXJB-TV (channel 4) in Valley City. Kratter dropped out in January 1958. Turning down an intervention from Fargo TV station WDAY-TV (channel 6), which feared the loss of some network programs to the new station and believed that channels 4 and 11 would constitute a then-illegal duopoly, an FCC hearing examiner approved the North Dakota Broadcasting Company application on May 27, 1958; the commission approved the station in 1959. NDBC announced that, though the studios would be shared with KXJB-TV&#x27;s Fargo site and the recently purchased KFGO (renamed KXGO), the new station would transmit from Sabin, Minnesota, and be named KXGO-TV.

KXGO-TV began broadcasting on October 11, 1959. Its arrival triggered a minor realignment of network programming in North Dakota as its first exclusive ABC affiliate. Previously, North Dakota&#x27;s three NBC affiliates—WDAY-TV, KFYR-TV in Bismarck, and KNOX-TV in Grand Forks—had aired some ABC shows. With the advent of channel 11, ABC shows were now seen from the new KXGO-TV and Boler&#x27;s Bismarck station, KBMB-TV. However, some viewers lost ABC programming because the NBC affiliates reached more viewers than the new channel 11.

In 1962, Ferris Traylor of Evansville, Indiana, acquired KXGO-TV as well as KNOX-TV in Grand Forks and KCND-TV (channel 12) in Pembina. The new ownership announced major plans to shuffle the first two stations by relocating channel 11 to a new, tall tower near Hillsboro, North Dakota and moving channel 10 completely from Grand Forks to Thief River Falls, Minnesota. The station set up new local offices in the Manchester Building in Fargo and began planning the construction of a new, television tower. At the time, the tallest tower—located in Columbus, Georgia—was high. On May 15, 1963, to dissociate itself from KXGO radio, the station changed its call sign to KEND-TV (for &quot;Eastern North Dakota&quot;); that month, the new tall tower received FCC approval. This facility would make KNOX-TV redundant by including Grand Forks in the enlarged channel 11 service area. Though delayed by the discovery that Bethlehem Steel had produced defective steel for the tower and two others across the country, the structure was completed on November 8, 1963, when a antenna for channel 11 was affixed to the top of the mast.

When the tower was due to be activated on February 1, 1964, KEND-TV changed its call sign again to KTHI-TV (for &quot;Tower High&quot;); technical questions pushed back the site switch to February 8. Coinciding with the change, the station moved into new studios south of Fargo. KNOX-TV was shut down, and its studio and office in Grand Forks was absorbed into the enlarged KTHI operation.

Traylor&#x27;s broadcasting interests were undergoing ownership changes even as channel 11 was acquired, as Milwaukee-based Polaris Industries acquired half of Traylor-owned Producers, Inc. in 1962 and the remainder in 1963. In 1966, Polaris merged with the Natco Corporation. It put KTHI-TV and KCND-TV on the market; despite an offer for the former by Don Burden of the Star Stations radio group, channel 11 was never sold and remained in the Natco fold post-merger. Natco&#x27;s primary owner, J. B. Fuqua, renamed the firm Fuqua Industries in February 1967. During this time, in 1967, KTHI-TV moved its Grand Forks studio to larger quarters on 9th Avenue North. This came after the company considered originating half of KTHI&#x27;s broadcast day from Grand Forks and the other half from Fargo.

===Morgan Murphy ownership (1969–1995)===
In 1969, Fuqua Industries sold KTHI-TV for $1.491 million to Spokane Television, a subsidiary of the Morgan Murphy Stations group. The FCC waived a rule requiring new owners to hold stations at least three years except in cases of financial difficulty, noting that Pembina had not been able to find a buyer in 1966 even though the sale of KTHI-TV was provided for in the merger agreement. After the sale, the station remained unprofitable for at least its first four years. Into the late 1970s, most of the station&#x27;s local morning programming continued to originate from Grand Forks.

On August 22, 1983, KTHI became an NBC affiliate, swapping affiliations with WDAY-TV and its satellite for the Devils Lake and Grand Forks area, WDAZ-TV (channel 8). The switch was initiated by ABC, which at the time was number-one in the ratings seeking affiliation upgrades nationally and had courted WDAY for several years. KTHI management found out in a curt, 90-second phone call from ABC; most station employees learned their station was losing its network by way of an announcement on WDAY-TV&#x27;s newscast.

Until 1986, channel 11 was carried by cable systems across Manitoba, including the Winnipeg area. It and KXJB-TV were removed when Canadian cable companies were granted permission to replace most of the North Dakota stations with network affiliates from Detroit provided via the CANCOM service, which were believed to have better picture quality.

===Meyer and Sunrise ownership===
Meyer Broadcasting of Bismarck, North Dakota, owner of KFYR-TV in Bismarck and its network of satellites in western North Dakota, bought the station in a deal announced in November 1994 and completed in March 1995. On June 5, the station changed its call sign to KVLY-TV, reflecting the Red River Valley region; recently relaxed FCC rules allowed an FM station in Texas to share the call sign. In 1998, Meyer opted to exit the television business. It sold all its TV stations—KVLY-TV and KFYR-TV and satellites—to Sunrise Television, a division of the private equity firm Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst, for $63.75 million.

===Consolidation with KXJB===
In 2002, North Dakota Television LLC—a consortium of private equity firms The Wicks Group of Companies, JP Morgan Partners, and Halyard Capital—acquired KVLY-TV and KFYR-TV. The next year, the station acquired the non-license assets of KXJB from Catamount Broadcasting. Under a local marketing agreement (LMA), KVLY began to provide most operating functions beyond programming for KXJB. The KVLY studios on 21st Avenue South were expanded to house an additional studio for KXJB. Hoak Media of Dallas acquired KVLY-TV and KFYR-TV, as well as KSFY-TV in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and its satellites in 2006.

On November 20, 2013, Hoak announced the sale of most of its stations, including KVLY-TV, to Gray Television. Simultaneously, KXJB-TV was to be sold by Parker Broadcasting to Excalibur Broadcasting and would have continued to be operated by KVLY under an LMA. The sale was completed on June 13, but upon the closing of the sale, and in the wake of the new FCC rules restricting LMAs, Excalibur abandoned its plans to acquire the station. Instead, Gray began seeking an independent, minority-owned buyer for the KXJB facility and made plans to move KXJB&#x27;s CBS programming to a subchannel of KVLY-TV. This took place on November 12, 2014, as KXJB was sold to Major Market Broadcasting. The KXJB facility was turned off on December 1, 2014. To supplement the main transmitter for CBS service, Gray acquired three low-power stations, at Horace, Argusville, and Grand Forks, in 2015. The Horace transmitter became KXJB-LD, bringing the call sign back to use after Gray temporarily parked it on a facility in Wyoming.

==Local programming==
===News operation===

The original KXGO-TV had no local programming or studios, relying nearly exclusively on network material from ABC. This changed in February 1964, when the station became KTHI-TV and began airing local newscasts. One of the first on-air personalities was former professional football player Steve Myhra as a sportscaster. When Morgan Murphy bought channel 11 in 1969, the news department was reorganized with the main early evening newscast at 5 p.m. After canceling it, the station reinstated an early newscast at 5:30 in 1977, which moved back to 5 p.m. by 1981. While KTHI attracted a reasonable audience uncontested at 5 p.m., when fewer households watched TV, its 10 p.m. news—head-to-head with WDAY–WDAZ and KXJB—was a distant third at that time, watched by just 7 percent of viewers. Such advancements as a co-anchor format as well as Grand Forks stories introduced live by an anchor in Grand Forks were later discontinued to simplify the newscast. The station returned to a co-anchor format in 1987 and later that year introduced its first morning newscast.

In 1989, KTHI hired Charley Johnson, the 14-year news director and anchor at KXJB, to anchor its newscasts, including a 6 p.m. edition to go head-to-head with the other local stations. The new newscast was added in part, per general manager John Hrubesky, to beat a misconception national advertisers had about the Midwest, that few people were watching TV at 5 p.m. because they were on the farm. It was the first time a local station had produced three full evening newscasts; in 1979, KXJB had briefly shared a 5 p.m. newscast with the KX Network stations in western North Dakota. The ratings did not immediately improve; at 10 p.m., KTHI had an audience share of 7 percent, roughly half that of KXJB and a quarter that of WDAY–WDAZ. The morning newscast, 15 minutes in length since its 1987 debut, was lengthened to a full half-hour in 1993.

Upon the Meyer acquisition of KTHI, the company dismissed lead news anchor Doug Hamilton. By 1996, the station was narrowly behind KXJB at 6 p.m. and ahead of it at 10 p.m., and it was ahead of KXJB in both time periods by 2000. KXJB&#x27;s condition worsened over the ensuing years. When KVLY took over most of KXJB&#x27;s operations in 2003, the latter station&#x27;s early evening newscast times and format were changed to not conflict with KVLY. Except for a noon newscast, which KVLY did not offer, there was initially little overlap in on-air presenters. That changed in November 2007, when the stations&#x27; previously separate weeknight 10 p.m. newscasts and news brands were combined under the name &quot;Valley News Live&quot;. The stations had already been airing a combined weekend newscast.

Over the course of the 2010s, Valley News Live became increasingly competitive with WDAY. In May 2013, while WDAY maintained a lead on total households, Valley News Live accounted for more viewership in key demographics favored by advertisers. In 2014, KVLY surpassed WDAY as the ratings leader in Fargo–Moorhead proper, though the combination of WDAY and WDAZ remained number-one in the full designated market area.

As of September 2024, Valley News Live produced a combined 39 hours a week of local news programming across the NBC and CBS subchannels.

===Sports programming===
KVLY has at times been home to North Dakota State Bison football games. The station broadcast regular-season games and produced a pregame show. In the 2019–2020 season, the pregame show featured former NFL player and Bison alum Kyle Emanuel as one of the hosts. NDSU games moved to WDAY-TV in 2021 after Forum Communications won the rights.

==Former on-air staff==
* Dennis Bounds – news anchor, 1976–1978
* Bob Ivers – news anchor and talk-show host, 1970–1972
* Jim Lounsbury – news director and anchor, 1980
* Ed Schultz – sports director, 1980–1983

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

KVLY-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 11, on February 16, 2009, the day prior to the original digital television transition date. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 44 where it remained until being repacked to channel 36 on May 28, 2019.

===Tower===
Since February 8, 1964, channel 11 has been broadcast from a tall tower near Blanchard. The tower—erected in 1963 by the Kline Iron and Steel Company of Columbia, South Carolina—made the former KNOX-TV in Grand Forks redundant and vastly increased the station&#x27;s coverage area. It was the tallest man-made structure at its completion, surpassed by the Warsaw radio mast in Poland from 1974 to its 1991 collapse and then again by the Burj Khalifa in Dubai in 2008. In 2019, the VHF antenna at the top of the mast was removed, reducing its height to .

===Translators===
KVLY-TV serves portions of its large coverage area with three translators. All are in Minnesota and owned by local municipalities.

<text>KUMV-TV (channel 8) is a television station licensed to Williston, North Dakota, United States, affiliated with NBC and Fox. Owned by Gray Media, the station maintains a news studio and advertising sales office at the intersection of Main Street (US 2 BUS) and 6th Street East in Williston, and its transmitter is located west of the city near the North Dakota–Montana border.

KUMV is part of the four-station NBC North Dakota regional network of NBC affiliates in central and western North Dakota, originating from flagship station KFYR-TV (channel 5) in Bismarck. The NBC North Dakota network relays NBC network and other programming from KFYR across central and western North Dakota, as well as bordering counties in Montana and South Dakota. The four stations along with fellow NBC affiliate KVLY-TV in Fargo often share news stories. Master control and some internal operations of KUMV are based at KFYR&#x27;s facilities on North 4th Street and East Broadway Avenue in downtown Bismarck. The four stations are counted as a single unit for ratings purposes.

KUMV operates as a semi-satellite of KMOT (channel 10) in Minot. KMOT is itself a semi-satellite of KFYR-TV in Bismarck, which also has semi-satellite KQCD-TV(channel 7) in Dickinson. KUMV identifies itself as a separate station in its own right, but clears all network and syndicated programming as provided through KMOT. However, KUMV airs local news inserts into KMOT&#x27;s weeknight newscasts, as well as separate commercial inserts and legal identifications. The Montana viewing portion of KUMV&#x27;s coverage area is within the Mountain Time Zone, and the station&#x27;s prime time schedule starts at 6 p.m. rather than the usual 7 p.m. for the time zone.

The over-the-air signal of KUMV reaches portions of the Canadian province of Saskatchewan, but is no longer available on any cable systems there. KUMV is also carried in the Glendive, Montana market through cable television; and until 2013, it operated a translator, K13PL in that city. CBS affiliate KXGN-TV in Glendive also had a digital subchannel carrying NBC programming, but it was not associated with KUMV and aired separate programming that included newscasts from Billings NBC affiliate KULR-TV. That affiliation ended in 2024.

==History==
KUMV-TV signed on February 6, 1957, after Meyer obtained the construction permit on July 18, 1956. It was a semi-satellite of KFYR for a year. KMOT signed on January 23, 1958, as the third station in the Meyer group, and KUMV became a semi-satellite of KMOT.

Until KBMY/KMCY signed on in 1986, the Meyer stations carried a secondary affiliation with ABC. Until KXMD-TV signed on in 1969, KUMV carried CBS on a per-program basis.

In the late 1970s, KUMV became one of the first stations to be transmitted via terrestrial cable television into most of Saskatchewan; it even maintained a sales office in Saskatoon, as did KXMD and KFBB-TV, the ABC affiliate in Great Falls, Montana. This arrangement continued until early 1985, when the three North Dakota network affiliates were replaced by CANCOM feeds of the Detroit stations by Saskatchewan cable providers who felt the switch would improve signal quality.

The Meyers sold off their broadcast holdings in 1997, with the television stations going to Sunrise Television Corporation. Sunrise sold them to The Wicks Group of Companies of New York City in 2002.

Hoak Media bought KFYR-TV, KMOT, KUMV, and KQCD in July 2006, as well as KVLY-TV in Fargo and KSFY in Sioux Falls, South Dakota and its satellite stations. On November 17, 2006, the sale was approved by the FCC.

KUMV began broadcasting digital-only on February 16, 2009.

KUMV picked up MeTV in April 2013, with an official launch date of May 1, 2013.

On November 20, 2013, Hoak announced the sale of most of its stations, including KUMV-TV, to Gray Television. Gray initially planned, through Excalibur Broadcasting, to also acquire Fox affiliate KXND and its Williston translator from Prime Cities Broadcasting and operate it under a shared services agreement, which would have made it a sister station to KUMV. On March 25, 2014, Prime Cities Broadcasting requested that the FCC dismiss the sale of KXND to Excalibur; Gray would instead acquire the non-license assets of KXND, as well as the license of Williston repeater KXND-LP. The sale of the Hoak stations was completed on June 13; at that time, Gray shut down KXND&#x27;s full-power signal and moved Fox programming to the second digital subchannel of KUMV.

==Newscasts==

KUMV airs its own newscasts from Monday through Friday at 6 and 10 p.m. The first 10 minutes (which includes regional news and weather) originate at KMOT. KUMV has its own news and sports anchor who fill the remaining 20 minutes. Weekend newscasts are simulcast from KFYR.

From 2002 to 2007, KMOT was forced to cut its newscasts to 20 minutes while simulcasting the first 10 minutes of KFYR-TV&#x27;s 6 and 10 p.m. newscasts, much as KUMV does now. In January 2007, KMOT began airing full 30-minute newscasts at 6 and 10 p.m. once again. It also added a weatherman and photographer/reporter to the staff.

The stations occasionally share stories with co-owned KVLY-TV. The five stations simulcast major North Dakota sporting events and statewide political debates under the NBC North Dakota brand name and share certain equipment, such as remote broadcasting vehicles. On April 30, 2012, NBC North Dakota began broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition.

NBC North Dakota has long dominated the ratings in western North Dakota as a whole; the main stations and their semi-satellites count as one station for ratings and regulatory purposes. However, KMOT has spent most of its history as a distant runner-up to KXMC-TV in the northern half of the market.

The Fox-affiliated subchannel debuted &quot;West Dakota Fox News at Nine&quot; during October 2014, originating from KFYR&#x27;s studios in Bismarck.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KUMV-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 8, on February 16, 2009, the day prior to the original date on which full-power television stations in the United States were set to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which was later rescheduled for June 12, 2009). The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 52, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to its analog-era VHF channel 8 for post-transition operations.

<text>KQCD-TV (channel 7) is a television station in Dickinson, North Dakota, United States, affiliated with NBC and Fox. The station is owned by Gray Media, and maintains a news bureau and advertising sales office on 21st Street East in Dickinson; its transmitter is located near South Heart, North Dakota.

KQCD-TV is part of the four-station [[NBC North Dakota]] regional network of NBC affiliates in central and western North Dakota, originating from flagship station KFYR-TV (channel 5) in Bismarck. The NBC North Dakota network relays NBC network and other programming from KFYR-TV across central and western North Dakota, as well as bordering counties in Montana and South Dakota. The four stations along with fellow NBC affiliate KVLY-TV in Fargo often share news stories. Master control and some internal operations of KQCD are based at KFYR-TV&#x27;s facilities on North 4th Street and East Broadway Avenue in downtown Bismarck. The four stations are counted as a single unit for ratings purposes.

Though identifying as a separate station in its own right, KQCD-TV is a semi-satellite of KFYR-TV in Bismarck. While it airs separate commercials and legal identifications, for most of the day it airs a time-shifted feed of KFYR-TV in Mountain Time. Most of the station&#x27;s coverage area, including Dickinson itself, is in the Mountain Time Zone, and its prime time schedule starts at 6 p.m. rather than the usual 7 p.m. for its sister stations.

==History==
KQCD-TV debuted on January 25, 1980. It was the last station in what was then known as the Meyer Television Network to sign on, and has always been a semi-satellite of KFYR-TV. It replaced K07HN, a low-powered translator of KFYR-TV that had served the area since around 1967. Until KQCD&#x27;s sign-on, KDIX-TV (channel 2, now KXMA-TV) aired a few NBC programs in off-hours.

Longtime owner Marietta Meyer Ekberg sold her broadcast holdings in 1997, with the television stations going to Sunrise Television Corporation. Sunrise sold them to The Wicks Group of Companies of New York City.

Hoak Media bought KFYR-TV, KMOT, KUMV, and KQCD in July 2006, as well as KVLY-TV in Fargo and KSFY in Sioux Falls, South Dakota and its satellite stations. On November 17, 2006, the sale was approved by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

KQCD picked up MeTV in April 2013, with an official launch date of May 1, 2013.

On November 20, 2013, Gray Television announced it would purchase Hoak Media in a $335 million deal. Gray initially planned, through Excalibur Broadcasting, to also acquire Fox affiliate KNDX/KXND for $7.5 million and operate them under a local marketing agreement. On March 25, 2014, Prime Cities Broadcasting, owner of KNDX/KXND, requested that the FCC dismiss the sale of that station to Excalibur. This came as a result of increased scrutiny of LMAs by the FCC. Gray would instead acquire the stations&#x27; non-license assets, and, upon the closure of the Hoak purchases on June 13, 2014, shut down KNDX/KXND and moved Fox programming to subchannels of KFYR and its satellites.

==News operation==

KQCD once aired partially separate weekday newscasts from KFYR-TV at 6 p.m. and 10 p.m., much like KUMV does today. The first 10 minutes (which included regional news and weather) originated at KFYR, while the remaining 20 minutes were filled by KQCD&#x27;s own news and sports anchors. All other newscasts originated from KFYR. In 2002, severe cutbacks resulted in KQCD ending its locally focused newscasts. Since then, the only visual evidence that KQCD is a separate station has been its separate commercials and idents.

KQCD&#x27;s news department was reduced to a single reporter, Cebe Schneider. In 2009, she was joined by Adam Powell as bureau chief. Powell and Schneider&#x27;s stories aired on KFYR&#x27;s regional newscasts. They were the only reporters based in southwestern North Dakota. However, they were fired in 2012 due to further cutbacks. KQCD still has a single reporter whose stories air on KFYR.

The stations occasionally share stories with co-owned KVLY-TV. The five stations simulcast major North Dakota sporting events and statewide political debates under the NBC North Dakota brand name and share certain equipment, such as remote broadcasting vehicles. On April 30, 2012, NBC North Dakota began broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition.

The Fox-affiliated subchannel debuted &quot;West Dakota Fox News at Nine&quot; during October 2014, originating from KFYR&#x27;s studios in Bismarck.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KQCD-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 7, on February 16, 2009, the day prior to the original date on which full-power television stations in the United States were set to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which was later rescheduled for June 12, 2009). The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 18 to VHF channel 7 for post-transition operations.

Gray also owned KNDX-LD (channel 38) in Dickinson; this station was acquired alongside the purchase of the non-license assets of KNDX and KXND and thus simulcasts KQCD&#x27;s Fox-affiliated second subchannel. As of February 4, 2018, KNDX-LD was off the air due to being displaced by T-Mobile. KNDX-LD had been granted a move to channel 28, but Gray Television surrendered KNDX-LD&#x27;s license to the FCC on October 20, 2020. The FCC canceled the license the same day.

<text>Stephen Guernsey Cook Ensko (May 9, 1896 – December 18, 1969) was an expert on American antique silver. His book is the standard reference work for antique silver.

==Biography==
Stephen was born in 1896 in Manhattan, New York City to Robert Ensko (1855–1934) and Mary Elizabeth Blakeley (1857–?). His siblings include: Robert Ensko II (1880–1971) who worked as a lace dealer; Charlotte Ensko (1882–?) who married Milton Ernest Horn (1876–1929); Lamont Northrope Ensko (1890–1987) who worked in the family silver business; Elathene Amanda Ensko (1898–1981) who married George Robert Christie (1895–1996); and William Edward Ensko (c1900–1918) who was a sergeant in the US Army who was killed in a car accident in France during World War I. 

Stephen married Dorothea J. Winterloff (1892–1977) of Germany on June 4, 1918 in Manhattan and they had three children: Dorothea Charlotte Ensko (1920– ) who married Vernon Charles Wyle (1913–1986); Stephen William Ensko (1922–1945) who was a 2nd Lieutenant in the US Army who was killed in action in World War II; and Alice Elizabeth Ensko (1924-1999) who married George M. Keller II on December 24, 1944, and later married Alfred Woodward (1913-2007), the Illinois judge. 

Stephen registered for the draft on June 5, 1918 but he did not serve. At the time he was working as an antique dealer at 598 Madison Avenue, and he was living in Freeport, New York on Long Island.

At the death of his father in 1934, Stephen took over Robert Ensko, Inc. which had its showroom at 682 Lexington Avenue in Manhattan. He continued to commission the creation of reproductions of antique silver, to be sold under the Ensko name. 

He reissued and updated his father&#x27;s book &quot;Makers of Early American Silver&quot; and published it as &quot;American Silversmiths and their Marks&quot; in 1927. The first edition was limited to 310 copies, and as told in Robert Alan Green&#x27;s book on American Silversmith&#x27;s marks, many of the first edition copies were destroyed in an accident. The 1992 edition had the following introduction: 

In the world of American silver, one book has remained the indispensable reference guide, the quintessential &quot;vade mecum&quot; for any serious collector. This is Ensko&#x27;s American Silversmiths and Their Marks, first compiled in 1915 by Robert Ensko, revised and enlarged by his son Stephen in 1927, again reissued with corrections and additional names and marks as Ensko III in 1948, and now available in this elegantly printed and up-to-date fourth edition. ... Their New York firm, founded in 1878 and finally dissolved in 1970, was central to the study and appreciation of fine American silver, and, in the world of collectors, the Ensko name was synonymous with high quality and taste. ... 
Ensko published a second edition of the book in 1937 and a third in 1948. He also published &quot;English Silver 1675-1825&quot; in 8 volumes in 1937.

==Death==
Stephen died in 1969 in New York City. His widow, Dorothea, died in 1977 in Wheaton, Illinois.

<doc id="1339563" wikidata="Q550529" url="?curid=1339563" title="Strange Days (film)">
<text>Strange Days is a 1995 American science fiction thriller film directed by Kathryn Bigelow, from a screenplay by James Cameron and Jay Cocks, and based on a story by Cameron. The film stars Ralph Fiennes, Angela Bassett, Juliette Lewis, Tom Sizemore, Michael Wincott, Brigitte Bako, and Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio. Set in Los Angeles on the last two days of 1999, the film follows Lenny Nero (Fiennes), a black marketeer of an electronic device that allows a user to experience the recorded memories and physical sensations of other people, and Lornette &quot;Mace&quot; Mason (Bassett), a bodyguard and limousine driver, as they are drawn into a criminal conspiracy involving Nero&#x27;s ex-girlfriend Faith Justin (Lewis) and friend Iris (Bako).

Blending science fiction with film noir conventions, &quot;Strange Days&quot; explores themes such as racism, abuse of power, rape and voyeurism. Although the story was conceived by Cameron around 1986, Bigelow found inspiration from high profile incidents such as the Lorena Bobbitt incident and the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Principal photography began in Los Angeles on June 6, 1994, and concluded on October 14. Several of the film&#x27;s scenes, which offer a point-of-view shot, required multi-faceted cameras and considerable technical preparation.

A major commercial failure, &quot;Strange Days&quot; nearly derailed Bigelow&#x27;s career, grossing only $17 million against its $42 million budget. The film polarized critics upon release, while some praised the cinematography, visual style, and performances of the cast, others criticized its portrayal of rape and violence. Its critical standing has improved over the years, gaining a cult following. At the 22nd Saturn Awards, where the film received five nominations, Bassett won Best Actress and Bigelow became the first woman to win Best Director.

==Plot==
As 1999 nears its end, Los Angeles has become a dangerous war zone. A Chinese restaurant is robbed by a group of criminals, with one recording the event with a SQUID (Superconducting QUantum Interference Device), an illegal electronic device that records memories and physical sensations directly from the wearer&#x27;s cerebral cortex onto a MiniDisc-like storage device.

Lenny Nero, a former LAPD officer turned black marketeer of SQUID recordings, buys the robbery clip from his main supplier Tick. Elsewhere, Iris, a prostitute and former friend of Faith Justin (Lenny&#x27;s ex-girlfriend), is chased by LAPD officers Burton Steckler and Dwayne Engelman. Iris escapes on a subway car, but Engelman pulls off her wig, revealing a SQUID recorder headset.

Lenny pines for Faith and relies on emotional support from his two best friends - Max Peltier, a private investigator, and Lornette &quot;Mace&quot; Mason, a bodyguard and limousine driver. Mace has unrequited feelings for Lenny from when he was still a cop and acted as a father figure for her son after her boyfriend was arrested on drug charges, but disapproves of his SQUID-dealing business. While Lenny and Max are drinking at a bar, Iris drops a SQUID disc through the sunroof of Lenny&#x27;s car before it is towed away. Mace picks Lenny up and takes him to a nightclub where Faith is going to sing. There, Lenny receives a SQUID disc from an anonymous contact and unsuccessfully tries to get Faith away from her new boyfriend, Philo Gant. Gant is a music industry mogul who managed the recently murdered rapper Jeriko One.

While in the car with Mace, Lenny plays the disc the contact gave him and watches as Iris is brutally raped and murdered by an attacker at the Sunset Regent hotel. As they approach the hotel, Iris&#x27;s body is taken out on a stretcher. The next day, they take the disc to Tick, who cannot identify the source of the recording, but recalls that Iris was looking for Lenny. Deducing Iris may have left something in Lenny&#x27;s car, Mace and Lenny go to the impound and find Iris&#x27;s disc. Steckler and Engelman appear and demand the disc at gunpoint, but Lenny and Mace escape in her bullet-resistant car before being forced to stop at a dock. Steckler pours gasoline on the car and sets it on fire, but Mace drives it into the harbor, extinguishing the flames. When they reach the surface, the cops have left.

Mace takes Lenny to her brother&#x27;s house and they watch Iris&#x27;s disc, showing Iris was with Jeriko One when Steckler and Engelman pulled him over and murdered him, because his anti-police lyrics and activism incited protests against the LAPD. The two return to Tick, who Max explains has been rendered brain-dead from forceful exposure to amplified SQUID signals. Lenny fears Iris&#x27;s attacker covered his tracks by &quot;killing&quot; Tick and will come after Faith. Back at the nightclub, Lenny and Mace confront Faith, who reveals that Philo is afraid Iris&#x27;s disc would reveal that he kept his artists under surveillance. Lenny and Mace disagree over whether to trade the disc to Philo for Faith&#x27;s freedom or release it publicly, which could incite a citywide riot. As midnight approaches, Lenny and Mace sneak into a private party that Philo is hosting at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel for the city&#x27;s wealthy elite. Lenny has a change of heart and tells Mace to give the disc to deputy police commissioner Palmer Strickland.

In Philo&#x27;s penthouse suite, Lenny finds Philo brain-dead on the floor and another disc, revealing Faith&#x27;s affair with Max, who &quot;fried&quot; Philo&#x27;s brain with an amplified recording of them feigning rape. Pointing a gun at Lenny, Max explains that Philo hired him to kill Iris, but when Philo wanted Faith dead as part of the coverup, he decided to frame Lenny for the murders. Lenny and Max struggle in a fight, Faith intervenes and pulls off Max&#x27;s wig with a SQUID inside - assuring a confession - and Max stabs Lenny in the back. The fight culminates with Lenny on the balcony with Max hanging over; Lenny pulls the knife from his back to cut his necktie and drop Max to his death. Meanwhile, on the crowded streets, Mace subdues Steckler and Engelman with baton and taser, but other officers take down Mace. The crowd moves in, in support of Mace, and a major riot seems inevitable. Strickland, who has viewed Iris&#x27;s disc, arrives and orders Mace&#x27;s release and the arrest of Steckler and Engelman for murder. Engelman commits suicide; Steckler threatens Mace, but the officers gun him down. Faith is taken away in a police car. Lenny finds Mace, and the two share a hug before she gets in Strickland&#x27;s car. Then Lenny drags her out and they share a kiss as the crowd celebrates the turn of the new millennium.

==Cast==
==Production==

===Development===

The story of &quot;Strange Days&quot; was originally conceived by producer James Cameron around 1986. He eventually presented it to his former wife and director Kathryn Bigelow, who immediately found it impressive. According to her, &quot;These two characters on the eve of the millennium, with one character trying to get the woman who loves him to help him save the woman he loves. It&#x27;s this great emotional matrix.&quot; After a series of dialogues, Cameron and Bigelow developed the film&#x27;s society and political element. Cameron focused more on the romantic side, while Bigelow centered more on &quot;the edginess, the grit&quot; part of the film, which was something she was always interested in. Cameron later wrote a 90-page treatment based on these dialogues, stating that it was &quot;practically a novel, but it was unwieldy; it needed structure.&quot; The treatment was then presented to screenwriter Jay Cocks, who turned it into a script. Cameron felt that the resulting script was very well structured and only did a dialogue polish on top of it. The script was completed in 1993.

Bigelow was motivated to start work on &quot;Strange Days&quot; shortly after a series of cultural incidents that occurred in the United States in the early nineties, such as the Lorena Bobbitt trial and the 1992 Los Angeles riots that followed the Rodney King verdict. Referring to the latter, she noted, &quot;I was involved in the downtown cleanup, and I was very moved by that experience. You got a palpable sense of the anger and frustration and economic disparity in which we live.&quot; She also developed the character of Mace from Cameron&#x27;s original script to make &quot;valuable connections between female victimisation and racial oppression.&quot; The film was named after the 1967 song of the same name by The Doors. Both &quot;Strange Days&quot; and Cameron&#x27;s 1994 action film &quot;True Lies&quot; were part of a multimillion-dollar production deal between Lightstorm Entertainment and 20th Century Fox. However, the financing was unevenly divided between the two films, with &quot;Strange Days&quot; being initially budgeted at $30 million and &quot;True Lies&quot; at $70 million.

===Casting===
Angela Bassett was attached to the film from its early stages, after Bigelow sent her the treatment document and Bassett accepted the role. In January 1994, it was reported that Andy Garcia was close to being cast as Lenny. However, on February 3, 1994, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; revealed that Ralph Fiennes had been cast instead and that he was wrapping up negotiations to play the role. Fiennes&#x27; breakthrough role in &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;, for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor just days later, impressed Bigelow enough to cast him as Lenny. She stated that the role &quot;required somebody who had a tremendous amount of intelligence, complexity, depth, a series of qualities that I really felt only Ralph could supply.&quot; Cameron, however, initially felt that a &quot;glibber and slicker&quot; actor would be better for the role, but admitted that Fiennes made Lenny &quot;a sexier character—a guy you can care about very much.&quot;

&quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; also announced that Bono was expected to join Fiennes and Bassett in the role of Faith&#x27;s love interest and manager Philo Gant. In March 1994, columnist Army Archerd reported in &quot;Variety&quot; that Bono was still being sought for the role, which would eventually be played by Michael Wincott. In May 1994, Juliette Lewis, was cast alongside Fiennes and Bassett. The fact that Lewis was able to sing was important because the producers wanted to avoid lip-synching.

===Filming===
Filming of &quot;Strange Days&quot; was originally slated to begin on May 12, 1994, but that date was delayed to June 6, 1994, as the cast was finalized. Bigelow said that the O. J. Simpson murder trial &quot;[echoed] the film events&quot;, adding that &quot;Strange Days&quot; was filmed during the summer and fall of that year. The film was entirely shot in Los Angeles over a period of 77 nights. Producer Steven-Charles Jaffe said that the city was generally very cooperative, except for the subway scene as the team only had four hours a night to film it. Jaffe, however, remarked that Bigelow &quot;was so well prepared that what would have taken another director several weeks to do, she did in a matter of days.&quot; The production team also received permission from the West Hollywood film commission to film on Sunset Boulevard for a two-day period, which required the shutdown of several lanes of traffic.

The scene where the crowd celebrates the turn of the new millennium at the end of the film was shot at the corner of the 5th and Flower streets, between the Westin Bonaventure Hotel and the Los Angeles Public Library. Over 50 off-duty police officers were hired to control an assembled crowd of 10,000 people, who had to pay $10 in advance to attend the event. The filmmakers also hired rave promoters Moss Jacobs and Philip Blaine to produce performances featuring Aphex Twin, Deee-Lite, as well as &quot;all the cyber-techno bands they could garner&quot;. It was reported that a total of $750,000 was spent on the event, which included the rental of half of the 1,300 rooms in the Bonaventure. The event started at 9 pm on a Saturday night and ended shortly before its scheduled end at 4 am, as five people were hospitalized for suffering overdoses of ecstasy.

The film&#x27;s SQUID scenes, which offer a point-of-view shot, required multi-faceted cameras and considerable technical preparation. A full year was spent building a specialized camera that could reproduce the effect of looking through someone else&#x27;s eyes. Bigelow revealed that it was essentially &quot;a stripped-down Arri that weighed much less than the smallest EYMO and yet it would take all the prime lenses.&quot; Cinematographer Matthew F. Leonetti was also hired to help Bigelow film the scenes, which were choreographed weeks in advance. The opening sequence, which features a 16-foot jump between two buildings by a stunt performer without a safety harness, took two years to coordinate and has hidden cuts. For example, the jump was filmed with a helmet camera, while the run up a staircase required a Steadicam. According to Cameron, &quot;We designed transitions that would work seamlessly. It was a very technical scene that doesn&#x27;t look technical.&quot; The sequence where Iris runs in front of a speeding freight train was shot backwards, with the train backing up. The footage was then reversed during editing.

===Music===

World music was chosen as the primary music style of &quot;Strange Days&quot; due to its variety of sounds and instruments. According to music supervisor Randy Gerston, who previously worked on &quot;True Lies&quot;, this type of music helped the film-makers create a futuristic atmosphere, noting that &quot;the world is shrinking and people are getting acclimated to strange languages being part of the pop vernacular.&quot; Michael Kamen was the first composer hired to create a score for the film. Michel Sanchez and Éric Mouquet, the French duo known as Deep Forest, were then hired to replace Kamen&#x27;s work. In addition to their score, Deep Forest teamed with Peter Gabriel to write an original song for the film&#x27;s end credits, titled &quot;While the Earth Sleeps&quot;. New Zealand composer Graeme Revell, fresh off writing an acclaimed score for &quot;The Crow&quot;, was then hired to replace most of Deep Forest&#x27;s work, and he wrote the electronic-driven score used in the finished film. Revell also teamed with singer-songwriter Lori Carson to write an original song that appears over the film&#x27;s final scene, titled &quot;Fall in the Light&quot;.

Bigelow was a fan of English musician PJ Harvey, and chose two of her songs, &quot;Rid of Me&quot; and &quot;Hardly Wait&quot;, to be performed onscreen by Lewis. Alternative rock band Skunk Anansie appeared in the film, performing at the New Year&#x27;s Eve party, and were encouraged to jam between takes, so Bigelow could record them live and give the rave a greater sense of authenticity. Although the band would have a live sound on the film, they ultimately had to lip-sync. Industrial punk band Season to Risk performed the song &quot;Undone&quot; live in the nightclub scene, selected for their sound and stage presence. Other musicians featured on the soundtrack included British trip hop artist Tricky, Belgian electronic group Lords of Acid and American heavy metal bands Prong. A soundtrack album was released on October 3, 1995. In addition, 60,000 promotional CD-ROMs, which contained production material from the film and music clips from the soundtrack, were made available only through the &quot;College Special&quot; issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine that was sold at record stores.

==Themes==
Although &quot;Strange Days&quot; is generally classified as a science fiction thriller, the film uses multiple narrative elements such as film noir conventions like the femme fatale. The terms &quot;techno-thriller&quot;, &quot;tech-noir&quot;, and &quot;futuristic erotic thriller&quot; have also been used. In 2001, cultural critic Steven Shaviro compared &quot;Strange Days&quot; to Cameron&#x27;s earlier films, stating that the film &quot;has characters that the viewer is supposed to identify with, and a plot full of thrills, exciting action sequences and unexpected twists. But at the same time, &quot;Strange Days&quot; is very much an experimental film, one that questions and inverts the traditional and Hollywood structures of identification and involvement, in ways that are consonant with the ideas that have been put forward by feminist film criticism over the last thirty years.&quot; The film&#x27;s dystopian society and use of SQUID technology, which has been compared to the &quot;simstim&quot; technology in William Gibson&#x27;s 1984 novel &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, were also considered cyberpunk concepts.

The film explores controversial themes such as abuse of power, racism, and rape. Voyeurism is also a major element due to the protagonist&#x27;s extensive use of SQUID technology. The fact that the film was directed by a woman was even more controversial, with film critic Michael Mirasol noting that had &quot;Strange Days&quot; been directed by a man, these scenes would likely have been criticized as sexist and misogynistic. Nevertheless, Bigelow insisted that the film does not glorify violence and that it has a positive purpose. According to her, &quot;I wanted to treat &#x27;the system&#x27; fairly, because if it&#x27;s the enemy, then we&#x27;re the enemy, since by not changing it we&#x27;re reproducing it... The film ends in a strong insistence on hope. Ultimately it&#x27;s humanity - not technology - that takes us into the next century and the next millennium.&quot; In 2015, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; editor Sonny Bunch felt that &quot;Strange Days&quot; was still relevant, comparing the imagery captured by the SQUID units to that of first-person shooters or cellphone videos on YouTube. He added that events such as Jeriko One&#x27;s murder and the subsequent coverup of the crime by the two police officers contribute to activist movements like Black Lives Matter, and that their media documentation amplifies their reception and consequences.

Mace was seen as a strong yet very feminine character, as she often rescues Lenny in dire situations and shows maternal concern for him. Both characters represent a significant contrast: Mace is the film&#x27;s hero and moral center, whereas Lenny is the antihero; Mace is black and Lenny is white; and finally, Mace represents the &quot;hard-edged, reality-based&quot; component, while Lenny is dominated by fantasies. This is especially notable when Mace yells to Lenny, &quot;This is your life! Right here! Right now! It&#x27;s real time, you hear me? Real time, time to get real, not playback!&quot; The film&#x27;s white characters also tend to be nihilistically concerned with the present, while the black characters are generally future revolutionaries. Bigelow considered &quot;Strange Days&quot; her most personal film, claiming that &quot;It&#x27;s a synthesis of all the different tracks I&#x27;ve been exploring, either deliberately or unconsciously, ever since I started making art.&quot;

==Release==

===Box office===
&quot;Strange Days&quot; premiered at the New York Film Festival on October 7, 1995, the same day it opened in limited release at the Ziegfield Theatre in Manhattan, where it grossed $31,062 in its first weekend. One week later, on October 13, it entered wide release, opening in 1,691 theaters and grossing $3.7 million that weekend. The film&#x27;s poor performance at the box office was compared to &quot;Jade&quot; and &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;, which opened at the same time and had a similar budget. Overall, the film went on to make $8 million in the United States and Canada, little more than a sixth of its $42 million production cost. As a result, &quot;Strange Days&quot; was considered a commercial failure, due in part to the poor marketing strategy and lack of audience understanding. The film almost derailed Bigelow&#x27;s career, as five years would pass before she directed her next film, &quot;The Weight of Water&quot;. Internationally, &quot;Strange Days&quot; was distributed by United International Pictures where it grossed $9 million for a worldwide total of $17 million.

===Critical reception===
Upon release, &quot;Strange Days&quot; polarized film critics. Roger Ebert, who gave the film four out of four stars, described it as &quot;a technical tour de force&quot; and highlighted the film&#x27;s astute use of SQUID technology, stating that &quot;Bigelow is able to exploit the idea of what is happening; she forces her audience to deal with the screen reality, instead of allowing us to process it as routine &#x27;action.&#x27;&quot; The film&#x27;s technical aspects were also praised by &quot;Variety&quot; editor Todd McCarthy, who remarked that no other film since &quot;Lady in the Lake&quot; in 1947 had &quot;experimented so extensively with the subjective camera&quot;. In a mixed review, Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a &quot;B−&quot; rating, concluding that &quot;Strange Days&quot; &quot;has a dazzling atmosphere of grunge futurism, but beneath its dark satire of audiovisual decadence lurks a naggingly conventional underworld thriller.&quot; Edward Guthmann of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; criticized the film for failing to commentate its violence, saying that &quot;Bigelow&#x27;s style is so visceral [...] that her movie reminds us of a snuff film, rather than a well-reasoned cautionary tale about our animal instincts.&quot; &quot;New York&quot; magazine writer David Denby called the rape scene &quot;the sickest sequence in modern movies&quot;.

The performances of the lead characters were highlighted very positively. Writing for &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, film critic Michael Wilmington praised Fiennes&#x27; performance because it captures &quot;the weaselly, pleading side of Lenny&quot;, while noting &quot;the slight formality of his diction&quot;, which he felt gives the character depth. Similarly, in her review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin said that Fiennes &quot;gleefully captures Lenny&#x27;s sleaziness while also showing there is something about this schlockmeister that is worth saving, despite much evidence to the contrary.&quot; As for Bassett, she felt that the character &quot;looks great and radiates inner strength even without the bone-crunching physical feats to which she is often assigned.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called &quot;Strange Days&quot; Bigelow&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot; and credited Bassett&#x27;s &quot;standout&quot; performance, describing her as &quot;fierce, funny and heart rending&quot;. In contrast, Sizemore and Lewis were considered miscast in their roles. At the 22nd Saturn Awards, Bassett won Best Actress and Bigelow became the first woman to win the Best Director award.

Retrospectively, the film&#x27;s critical standing has improved. Roger Ebert&#x27;s correspondent Michael Mirasol felt that &quot;Strange Days&quot; had some obvious weaknesses, including a dialogue that is too polished for its setting, but nevertheless judged its &quot;devotion to its characters, its remarkable use of POVs to create its consistent atmosphere of apprehension and excitement, and most of all, its fearlessness.&quot; In 2009, Drew Morton of the Pajiba website considered &quot;Strange Days&quot; an &quot;extremely underappreciated film&quot; and &quot;the best piece of cyberpunk to grace celluloid since Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Blade Runner&quot;.&quot; &quot;Strange Days&quot; also garnered a small cult following, who felt that the film has been overlooked by a casual mass audience and misguided critics.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 69% with an average rating of 6.6/10, based on reviews from 55 critics. The website&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;Strange Days&quot; struggles to make the most of its futuristic premise, but what&#x27;s left remains a well-directed, reasonably enjoyable sci-fi fantasy.&quot; On Metacritic, it holds a weighted average score of 66 of out 100, based on 30 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B&quot; on a scale of A+ to F.

<text>KFYR (550 kHz) is a commercial AM radio station in Bismarck, North Dakota. It airs a news-talk radio format and is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc. Some hours on weekends, the station plays oldies. The studios are on East Rosser Avenue in Bismarck.

KFYR is powered at 5,000 watts with a signal that can be heard in four U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. By day, it is non-directional. But at night, the station uses a directional antenna with a two-tower array. The transmitter is off 158th Street NE in Menoken. Programming is also heard on 250-watt FM translator K259AF at 99.7 MHz in Bismarck.

==Signal==
KFYR boasts an enormous daytime coverage area. This is due to its location near the bottom of the AM dial; lower frequencies have longer waves that tend to travel farther across terrain. This is especially true for stations that operate at 5,000 watts or more. Additionally, North Dakota&#x27;s flat landscape provides near-perfect ground conductivity. Combined with its transmitter height, this gives KFYR a daytime footprint equivalent to that of a full-power FM station. It can be heard across almost all of North Dakota during the day, as well as in parts of Minnesota, South Dakota, Montana, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Under the right conditions, it reaches into Nebraska. It has been claimed that KFYR has the largest daytime coverage area of any AM radio station in the United States. A similar claim can be made for WNAX in Yankton, South Dakota, which transmits on 570 AM.

At night, two towers are used in a directional pattern to protect CBK, the CBC Radio One outlet for most of Saskatchewan, which operates on nearby 540 AM. Even with this restriction, KFYR still covers almost all of North Dakota at night. It is the primary entry point station for the Emergency Alert System in both North and South Dakota.

==History==
===Early years===
KFYR signed on the air in . It was founded by Phillip J. Meyer and his wife, Etta Hoskins Meyer. It is Bismarck&#x27;s oldest radio station. KFYR began operations with programming for only a few hours daily, signing off between shows. In its early years, it was an affiliate of the NBC Red Network, airing its dramas, comedies, news and sports during the &quot;Golden Age of Radio.&quot;

Early programming included live studio musicians, transcribed music and programs, and live feeds from the NBC. Many popular soap operas, game shows, sporting events, religious services, children&#x27;s programs, and big band broadcasts were part of the regular schedule. The station carried NBC&#x27;s &quot;Monitor&quot; on weekends. Other programming included local news, weather, and sports, locally originated variety programs such as &quot;What&#x27;s The Weather&quot; weekday mornings and &quot;The Northwest Farmfront&quot; weekdays at noon. Mike Dosch, an established musician from Strasburg, North Dakota (Lawrence Welk&#x27;s hometown) was featured on several of the live shows and had his own late-night program of organ music for many years. There were also shows hosted by staff announcers who played recorded popular music by such artists as Nat King Cole, Doris Day, The Ames Brothers, Fred Waring and the Pennsylvanians, and orchestras including Mantovani, Percy Faith, and Frank Chacksfield.

By 1950, the station had expanded its schedule to an 18-hour broadcast day. It began broadcasting at 6 a.m. and concluded at midnight.

===TV and FM stations===
In December 1953, it added television station KFYR-TV 5. Because KFYR was part of the NBC Radio Network, KFYR-TV became western North Dakota&#x27;s NBC television affiliate, along with its three semi-satellites. In 1966, an FM station went on the air, KFYR-FM at 92.9 (now KYYY).

At one time, the Meyer Broadcasting Company roster also included AM radio stations in Billings and Great Falls, Montana, as well as an FM station in Minot, North Dakota. Marietta Meyer Ekberg, the Meyers&#x27; daughter, retired in 1998, and her radio holdings were sold to Jacor Communications. Jacor, in turn, was acquired in 1999 by Clear Channel Communications, a forerunner to today&#x27;s iHeartMedia.

===Top 40 era===
Facing stiff competition from more youthful stations, KFYR began to see its dominance and audience decline in the early 1960s. It decided to switch to a Top 40 format. It was popular with teenagers by virtue of its &quot;torrid twenty&quot; countdown show, which featured the twenty popular hits of the week. In the 1960s and 1970s, teenagers from South Dakota to parts of Canada enjoyed listening to &quot;their&quot; music on KFYR every evening (along with 1520 KOMA from Oklahoma City, 1090 KAAY from Little Rock, 890 WLS from Chicago, and 1500 KSTP from St. Paul).

KFYR gained brief national notoriety in 1979, when the station was sued in federal court by the Pointer Sisters and Elektra Records. The station had created a remix of their cover of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Fire&quot; with &quot;K-Fire&quot; dubbed into the chorus where &quot;fire&quot; would be sung. The suit was settled out of court.

KFYR once broadcast in AM stereo, beginning with the Harris system in the mid-1980s, and later switching to the Motorola C-QUAM system. KFYR discontinued broadcasting in AM stereo around the turn of the millennium.

===Switch to talk===
As younger listeners increasingly tuned to FM for their hits, KFYR switched its music to adult contemporary and oldies. By the 1990s, it added more talk shows, until it had switched to a news-talk format. In 2011, it added an FM translator for listeners who prefer to hear the station on the FM dial. The translator on 99.7 FM was previously a simulcast of KQDY 94.5 FM before 2011.

Today, KFYR runs a news/talk format. Local talk shows are heard in mornings and during afternoon drive time. The rest of the weekday schedule is made up of nationally syndicated conservative talk programs: &quot;The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, The Jesse Kelly Show, Our American Stories with Lee Habeeb, Coast to Coast AM with George Noory&quot; and &quot;America in the Morning&quot;. KFYR is a Fox News Radio Network affiliate.

Weekend syndicated shows include &quot;Armstrong &amp; Getty&quot; and &quot;Sunday Nights with Bill Cunningham&quot;. There is live play-by-play sports from the Minnesota Vikings and University of Mary football games, and high school sporting events. Some hours on weekends include oldies shows.

==Translator==
KFYR also broadcasts on an FM translator:

<text>Latet (, &quot;lit.&quot; to give) is an Israeli nonprofit aid organization that was founded in 1996 by Gilles Darmon, then a new immigrant from France. Acting as an umbrella organization for 180 local NGOs across 105 communities in the country, it provides for the basic needs of populations living in poverty and food security. The organization operates a national food bank and runs several aid and educational programs. Among its core activities, Latet distributes $30 million worth of food annually to 60,000 families in need and 1,000 Holocaust survivors living in poverty.

== History ==
When it was established, in addition to combatting poverty in Israel, Latet specialized in sending emergency aid delegations and humanitarian assistance abroad following wars and natural disasters: Kosovo and Rwanda after the civil wars in 1997 and 1999, India after the earthquake in 1999, Sri Lanka after the tsunami in 2005 and Haiti following the earthquake in 2010.

After the emergency delegation to Haiti, the organization changed its course of action to focus on reducing poverty and providing assistance in Israel only.

== Organization&#x27;s purpose ==
According to a 2016 official report by the Israeli National Insurance Institute, 462,000 families (that is 1,802,000 individuals) live in poverty in Israel, of which 838,500 are children. Furthermore, nearly 955,000 families live in food insecurity (18% of the general population). In its efforts to relieve poverty and alleviate food insecurity, Latet has developed an operating model that enables the annual distribution of $30 million worth of food to 60,000 families in need across the country.

Latet carries out numerous annual initiatives to raise awareness among the general public: public displays, food drives, and a national telethon. Moreover, the organization relies on more than 19,000 volunteers who annually join Latet&#x27;s activities, providing 400,000 hours of voluntary service.

Latet considers the government to be the main factor responsible for reducing poverty, as does 75.6% of the general public, according to a public survey published in Latet&#x27;s Alternative Poverty Report. The organization regularly lobbies the government to bring change to the national agenda. Latet publishes an annual Alternative Poverty Report which takes the human factor of poverty into account and organizes an annual conference discussing poverty.

== Areas of action ==

=== The nutritional security initiative ===
The nutritional security initiative consists of rescuing and distributing food nationwide. With three logistic centers located in the north, center and south of Israel, Latet is one of the leading food banks and operates as an umbrella organization for 180 local NGOs across 105 communities, providing them with food products on a regular basis. These local associations then redistribute the food to people in need. 60,000 families receive assistance from Latet every month. Every year, Latet rescues and distributes between $25-$30 million worth of food.

The organization primarily rescues and distributes dry food products (canned food, rice, pasta, oil, sugar, flour, and more) and over the past five years has also started distributing dairy products and poultry. The modus operandi of the organization relies on long-lasting partnerships with leading companies in the food industry (Osem, Strauss, Tnuva, Coca-Cola, Unilever, etc). Since 2015, Latet has been working in cooperation with  the Manufacturers Association of Israel&#x27;s Association of Food Industries to encourage, regulate and expand food rescue in Israel among food companies. This collaboration has led to more than 20 new food companies joining the food salvaging circle in 2016-2017. These partnerships have social (assist families in need), economical (save food destruction costs), and environmental (avoid food waste) advantages.

Along with the food rescue, food purchasing takes place regularly in order to provide all the necessary products for the basic food package Latet distributes.

=== Aid for Life – Holocaust survivors ===
According to the Foundation for the Benefit of Holocaust Victims in Israel, 45,000 out of the 189,000 Holocaust survivors living in Israel live below the poverty line. Latet&#x27;s Aid for Life program was created in 2007 with the goal of giving direct assistance to Holocaust survivors in need. The program provides the most impoverished Holocaust survivors with a holistic aid package tailored to their needs:

* A monthly food box is delivered to the survivor&#x27;s home every month and is built in cooperation with nutritionists to adapt to elderly people&#x27;s needs.
* Ongoing social support:  each survivor is partnered with an individual volunteer who visits him on a regular basis. Latet also hosts festive dinners for Jewish holidays and social events throughout the year. In 2018, 1,300 volunteers kept the survivors company on an ongoing basis and brought them to dozens of events that were organized across the country.
* Emergency Fund: the fund was created to supply medical and paramedical items and services such as eyeglasses, incontinence products, dental care, emergency alert systems, and household maintenance. These are expensive products most survivors in need cannot afford. The emergency fund helps them resolve issues quickly and allows the survivors to regain their independence.
* Home restorations: some survivors live in run-down apartments that often lack accessibility. This project has been implemented since 2014 to ensure survivors’ homes are safe and secure. The restorations are managed by Latet staff and led by a professional contractor, at no cost to the survivors.  Within 4 years, the project has renovated 1,550 apartments, improving the survivors&#x27; quality of life and personal security.

=== Latet Youth organization ===
Latet Youth is an organization recognized by the Israeli Ministry of Education that is dedicated to the nurturing of Israeli teens as caring citizens guided by values of volunteering and mutual responsibility. The teenagers spend time visiting and volunteering in different places (schools, community centers, retirement homes, etc.). During the last year of the three-year program, the youth implement social micro-initiatives within their own communities, developing their entrepreneurial and leadership skills.

The youth organization operates nationwide and brings together 2,500 participants from all backgrounds. 40% of the participants are defined as &quot;at-risk youth&quot; and 70% come from a disadvantaged socioeconomic background. Every year, Latet Youth&#x27;s members carry out 150 social micro-initiatives.  Some of these initiatives have received national media coverage, like the &quot;Thank You Day&quot; and the &quot;Gift Room at the Soroka Medical Center&quot;.

=== Advocacy and Awareness ===
The project&#x27;s aim is to bring about change in Israel&#x27;s national priorities and to raise social awareness about poverty and food insecurity. Year long, Latet is committed to carrying out various activities in order to fulfill this goal:

* Alternative Poverty Report: this is an annual report which sheds light on the most up-to-date trends in poverty and nutritional insecurity in Israel. The report is published by Latet in collaboration with the ERI research institute. This report is a multidimensional analysis of what poverty means and presents alternative numbers in contrast to the narrower definition of poverty by the National Insurance Institute of Israel. 
* Poverty conference: this annual conference is one of the most prominent events related to poverty and social gaps, while discussing solutions for reducing poverty. The conference molds the public discourse and gathers associations&#x27; directors, academics, economists, politicians, private companies&#x27; directors, artists, etc.
* Public fundraising campaigns: twice a year, around the holidays (Rosh Hashanah and Passover), Latet runs extensive fundraising and awareness campaigns. As part of these activities, the organization organizes food drives in the largest supermarket chain Shufersal in order to collect food products from customers. In 2017, 36,500 food boxes (containing dozens of food products) were collected from the supermarket chain. For Rosh Hashanah, Latet holds an annual telethon on national television in partnership with leading live TV shows, like Master Chef Israel, during which the organization raises hundreds of thousands of Holiday meal for people in need.
* Large-scale public displays are held in important public places in order to raise the awareness of the general population to the poverty issue.

== Partnerships and impact on Israeli society ==
Latet receives wide public support from Israeli society and estimates that since its creation in 1996, nearly 2,000,000 Israelis have donated time, money and food products to support Latet&#x27;s efforts and more than 100,000 volunteers have participated to the organization&#x27;s activities.

Latet is one of the most well-known organizations in Israel and has been recognized as a &quot;Super Brand&quot; by the Superbrands organization, along the Mossad and the IDF. 98% of Israelis know Latet (98% brand recognition and 52% brand recall).

90% of Latet&#x27;s budget comes from Israeli society (general public, private sector and foundations) and 7% from abroad (foundations, federations and private donors). Some of Latet&#x27;s largest supporters are UJA-Federation of New York, Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia, Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles, Fondation pour la Mémoire de la Shoah, and FSJU.

<doc id="1339582" wikidata="Q7591418" url="?curid=1339582" title="St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church, Drogheda">
<text>St. Peter&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church is located on West Street, Drogheda, County Louth, Ireland. 
Designed by John O&#x27;Neill and William Henry Byrne and built in the French Gothic style of local limestone ashlar in 1884. This Roman Catholic church is known for its tall west gable, rose window and for containing the national shrine of St. Oliver Plunkett.

==History==

During the time of the Penal laws, Catholic chapels were barred within a town&#x27;s walls. Therefore, Drogheda&#x27;s Catholic chapel was outside the Westgate and was inadequate for the needs of the populace. A plot of land on a suitable site in West Street (Drogheda&#x27;s main street) was persistently refused by the corporation. Eventually, through the influence of a Mr. Chester, who was a wealthy Catholic, a lease was finally secured.

A ceremony was held for all to witness Richard O&#x27;Reilly, Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of all-Ireland laying the foundation stone. Although the occasion was marred by an unseemly interruption, when the Mayor and Drogheda corporation arrived at the ceremony wearing their official regalia, with the Mace and Sword of state being borne before them, to confront the Archbishop. They warned him that a &#x27;Popish Chapel&#x27; would not be tolerated within the town walls.

Sir Edward Bellew of Barmeath Castle, a Catholic, stepped forward and convinced the mayor and corporation and their fellow travelers to withdraw. The proceedings continued without further ado and the foundation stone was duly laid.

The first church on the site was completed in 1793 to a design by Francis Johnston (who designed the spire of the nearby Church of Ireland of the same name) to a cost in the region of £12,000.

==Present building==

The façade of St. Peter&#x27;s is an imposing structure in the French Gothic Revival style, built of local limestone. It is one of the most notable buildings on West Street in the town centre of Drogheda. The building from 1793 was partly incorporated into the present building. The tower of the church is very similar to that of St. Patrick&#x27;s Church in Dungannon, County Tyrone.
A detail image of that building is held at the Highlanes Gallery, illustrated on a mid 19th Century (ca. 1861) map of the town created by Isaiah Rowland CE.

The Church is famous for housing the National Shrine to St. Oliver Plunkett, who was martyred at Tyburn in 1681. The shrine is most elaborate and contains the preserved head of the saint. Another showcase displays his shoulder blade and other bones as relics. Also on exhibit is the cell door of Newgate prison in which he spent his last days.

The Church is a prominent tourist attraction but signs urge silence and remind people that they are in a sacred place.

<doc id="1339583" wikidata="Q310384" url="?curid=1339583" title="Guillermo Cañas">
<text>Guillermo Ignacio Cañas (; born November 25, 1977), often referred to as Willy Cañas, is a tennis coach and a former professional tennis player from Argentina. Cañas won the Canada Masters in 2002, and reached the quarterfinal stage of the French Open in 2002, 2005 and 2007. His career-high singles ranking was world No. 8, achieved in June 2005. After being suspended in August 2005, Cañas returned to the circuit in September 2006 at ATP Challenger level.

==Career==

===Early years===
Cañas was born in Buenos Aires and named after Argentine tennis star Guillermo Vilas. He started playing at age 7. He turned professional in 1995, and began playing on the juniors circuit, enjoying some successes; these included a runner-up appearance at Surbiton, United Kingdom, and a win in the doubles event at the Italian Junior Championships, partnering Martín García.

From 1995 to 1999, Cañas played mainly Challenger Series tournaments. In April 1998, he broke into the top 100 for the first time, having won three Challenger tournaments in the previous 52 weeks. This allowed him to qualify for more ATP level tournaments, and he reached his first final in 1999 at Orlando, Florida. He also began to regularly qualify for Grand Slam tournaments, the most prestigious events in tennis.

In 2001, after a right wrist injury the previous year, he climbed from 227th place in the ATP rankings to the 15th, and was named ATP Comeback Player of Year. Cañas had won the first ATP level title of his career that season, in Casablanca, and reached the final of three other tournaments. In addition to this, he reached the fourth round of a Grand Slam tournament for the first time, achieving this result on two occasions, at the French Open and Wimbledon.

In the 2002 ATP Masters Series of Canada, an unseeded Cañas won his first ATP Masters Series title in Toronto, defeating Andy Roddick 6–4, 7–5 in the final. Cañas&#x27;s path to the final saw him defeat a renowned set of players, including world number two Marat Safin, and top-ten ranked Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Roger Federer. Cañas was also the first Argentine to win the Canada Open since Guillermo Vilas in 1976 and the first to win a Masters Series shield (the Series was created in 1990). Cañas won one other tournament in 2002, the Chennai Open, and reached in the finals in Casablanca and Stuttgart. He also emerged as a more potent force at the Grand Slams as he reached his first quarterfinal at the French.

===Doping===
On August 8, 2005, Cañas was suspended for two years and was forced to forfeit $276,070 in prizes by the ATP after testing positive for a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide, a substance with no benefits in itself other than as a treatment for hypertension, but used to cover other forbidden substances. No traces of any other forbidden substance were found in Cañas&#x27;s sample, and the player asserts the diuretic was present in some medicine prescribed by ATP doctors Mercader and Chinchilla for a cold he contracted during the Acapulco tournament in Mexico. Just a few weeks before his ban started, Cañas had been at the highest ranking of his career, world number eight.

Cañas vowed to fight the ban, claiming he was innocent of the charges against him. Cañas took his case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. His perseverance paid off on May 23, 2006, when he was acquitted of deliberate performance enhancement through illegal substances because the substances were in a prescription medicine. He was, however, considered careless in not checking the medicine before ingesting it. He was allowed to return to full professional activity from September 11, 2006, and the money prizes acquired before the suspension was restored. His points, which determine a player&#x27;s ranking, were nil upon his return, having expired.

===Return===
Upon his return to the tour, Cañas won five Challenger titles and one ATP title (2007 Brasil Open). In the six months after his return, he had won 42 of 47 matches, going from being unranked to rank 60. He won his first ATP-level match since his September return on February 15, 2007, beating Marcos Daniel 6–1, 6–4.

On March 11, 2007, Cañas defeated ATP ranked number one Roger Federer 7–5, 6–2 at the Indian Wells Masters, ending Federer&#x27;s streak of 41 consecutive victories, 5 short of Guillermo Vilas&#x27;s record on ATP Tour matches. He defeated Federer again (7–6, 2–6, 7–6) 16 days later at the Miami Masters to back-up his victory at Indian Wells. This double victory made him the only player (besides Rafael Nadal) to have defeated Federer in consecutive tournaments since 2003. Cañas told the &quot;New York Times&quot; that &quot;I came back very motivated, I came back with a lot of energy.&quot;

Cañas became the first qualifier to reach the semifinals of the Miami Masters. He made the final by beating Ivan Ljubičić, the seventh seed, 7–5, 6–2. In the final, the Argentine lost to Novak Djokovic of Serbia in straight sets. To get to the final, Cañas defeated Tim Henman, Juan Carlos Ferrero, Richard Gasquet, Roger Federer, Tommy Robredo, and Ivan Ljubičić, respectively, before losing to Novak Djoković. Cañas jumped 121 positions to reach the 22nd place in the ATP ranking as of April 30, 2007, the highest jump so far in the year.

Cañas reached the final of one more tournament in 2007, the Torneo Godó in Barcelona, where he lost to Rafael Nadal. Cañas commented afterwards that he believed he would be a strong contender at the French Open. However, his bid was thwarted for a third time at the quarter-final stage when he lost to Nikolay Davydenko. Having set himself a goal of finishing in the top 20, Cañas finished the year in 15th, equalling his finishes from 2001 and 2002. He announced his retirement from professional tennis in March 2010. Cañas held a record of five victories and two defeats (3–1 in singles) in Davis Cup matches across his career.

==Post-retirement==
Cañas was the coach of Ernests Gulbis from July 2011 until May 2012 and became the coach of Teymuraz Gabashvili in 2015. He coached Jelena Janković from January 2017 until her retirement. He now runs his own tennis academy in Aventura, Florida along with former tour pros Martín García and Gustavo Oribe. He is the current coach of Bernarda Pera.

==Playing style==
Cañas played a defensive counter-punching game from the baseline, using his retrieving skills in order to frustrate opponents. He used a two-handed backhand.

<text>The Beechcraft AQM-37 Jayhawk (originally designated KD2B and Q-12) is an air-launched supersonic target drone manufactured by Beechcraft capable of simulating inbound ICBM warhead packages for fleet shoot-down exercises.

==Development==

===AQM-37===

In 1959, the US Navy and US Air Force issued a joint request for a new high-speed expendable target. Beechcraft won the competition, and the result was a small delta-winged drone with wingtip fins and a liquid rocket motor, originally designated XKD2B-1 but now known as the AQM-37. The type first flew in May 1961, entered service with the US Navy in 1963, and launched its last two remaining targets in September 2022.

The original version was the AQM-37A or Beech Model 1019. The AQM-37A was followed by a confusing list of subvariants, some of which were new production, others which were modifications of existing AQM-37s. These variants were intended to simulate different classes of threats, such as sea-skimming antiship missiles or high-altitude naval attack missiles, or provide better performance. One high-performance variant with improved thermal protection attained a speed of Mach 4.7 and an altitude of over on a ballistic trajectory. The final US Navy variant was designated AQM-37C.

After an evaluation of the AQM-37A in the late 1960s, the US Army bought a small initial batch of Model 1100/1101 AQM-37As that, unlike other variants, were recoverable, using a parachute system. Some of this batch were intended for low-altitude operation and fitted with a radar altimeter, and others were intended for high-altitude operation and had a barometric altimeter. The Army later ordered over 400 improved non-recoverable Model 1102 variants of the AQM-37A.

The USAF evaluated the AQM-37 in the early 1970s but was slow to adopt it. Records of USAF procurement of the type are sketchy, but it does seem to be currently part of the Air Force target inventory. Small quantities of AQM-37s were also sold to Italy, Israel, and France, while Shorts in Britain built under licence several hundred of the type as the Shorts SD.2 Stiletto. The Meteor company of Italy built a number of AQM-37s under license.

All variants are air-launched, with the US Navy traditionally using the F-4 Phantom for the job, and the British using the Canberra.

More than 5,000 AQM-37 targets of all variants have been delivered since the early 1960s. On 22 September 2022 the U.S. Navy conducted the final AQM-37 target launch.

The AQM-37&#x27;s engine is built by Rocketdyne, though in some sources it is credited to Harley Davidson, the motorcycle manufacturer, which appears to be due to a sequence of company buyouts. The engine uses storable hypergolic liquid propellants: inhibited red fuming nitric acid (IRFNA) as an oxidizer and MAF-4 as a fuel. MAF-4, also known as hydyne, is a mixture of 60% unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) and 40% diethylenetriamine. MAF-4 has a higher density than pure UDMH, allowing to load more fuel into limited volume of fuel tank.

===AQM-81A Firebolt===

As a result, in the late 1960s the Air Force investigated an alternate propulsion scheme for the AQM-37 under project &quot;Sandpiper&quot;. The program involved fitting a few AQM-37As with hybrid rocket engines that used solid fuel with storable nitric acid oxidizer. The tests were judged promising, and so the Air Force went on to establish a &quot;High Altitude Supersonic Target (HAST)&quot; program in the 1970s. HAST suffered various difficulties, and it wasn&#x27;t until 1979 that a contract was awarded to Teledyne Ryan for the Model 305 / AQM-81A Firebolt.

The first Firebolt flew on 13 June 1983, launched from an Eglin AFB, Florida, F-4D Phantom II. The new target looked very much like the AQM-37, but had the hybrid rocket engine. The flight test program was completed, but then the HAST effort stalled completely, and the AQM-81A never went into production.

<doc id="1339598" wikidata="Q4853764" url="?curid=1339598" title="Banach measure">
<text>In the mathematical discipline of measure theory, a Banach measure is a certain way to assign a size (or area) to all subsets of the Euclidean plane, consistent with but extending the commonly used Lebesgue measure. While there are certain subsets of the plane which are not Lebesgue measurable, all subsets of the plane have a Banach measure. On the other hand, the Lebesgue measure is countably additive while a Banach measure is only finitely additive (and is therefore known as a &quot;content&quot;). 

Stefan Banach proved the existence of Banach measures in 1923. This established in particular that paradoxical decompositions as provided by the Banach-Tarski paradox in Euclidean space R3 cannot exist in the Euclidean plane R2.

== Definition ==
A Banach measure on R&quot;n&quot; is a function formula_1 (assigning a non-negative extended real number to each subset of R&quot;n&quot;) such that

* is finitely additive, i.e. formula_2 for any two disjoint sets formula_3;
* extends the Lebesgue measure , i.e. formula_4 for every Lebesgue-measurable set formula_5;
* is invariant under isometries of R&quot;n&quot; , i.e. formula_6 for every formula_5 and every isometry formula_8. 

== Properties ==
The finite additivity of implies that formula_9 and formula_10 for any pairwise disjoint sets formula_11. We also have formula_12 whenever formula_13.

Since extends Lebesgue measure, we know that formula_14 whenever &quot;A&quot; is a finite or a countable set and that formula_15 for any product of intervals formula_16.

Since is invariant under isometries, it is in particular invariant under rotations and translations.

== Results ==
Stefan Banach showed that Banach measures exist on R1 and on R2. These results can be derived from the fact that the groups of isometries of R1 and of R2 are solvable. 

The existence of these measures proves the impossibility of a Banach–Tarski paradox in one or two dimensions: it is not possible to decompose a one- or two-dimensional set of finite Lebesgue measure into finitely many sets that can be reassembled into a set with a different Lebesgue measure, because this would violate the properties of the Banach measure that extends the Lebesgue measure.

Conversely, the existence of the Banach-Tarski paradox in all dimensions &quot;n ≥ 3&quot; shows that no Banach measure can exist in these dimensions.

As Vitali&#x27;s paradox shows, Banach measures cannot be strengthened to countably additive ones: there exist subsets of R&quot;n&quot; that are not Lebesgue measurable, for all &quot;n ≥ 1&quot;.

Most of these results depend on some form of the axiom of choice. Using only the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice, it is not possible to derive the Banach-Tarski paradox, nor it is possible to prove the existence of sets that are not Lebesgue-measurable (the latter claim depends on a fairly weak and widely believed assumption, namely that the existence of inaccessible cardinals is consistent). The existence of Banach measures on R1 and on R2 can also not be proven in the absence of the axiom of choice. In particular, no concrete formula for these Banach measures can be given.

<text>KRDK-TV (channel 4) is a television station licensed to Valley City, North Dakota, United States, serving the Fargo–Grand Forks market. Owned by Major Market Broadcasting, it is affiliated with multiple networks on various digital subchannels, with Cozi TV and MyNetworkTV on its main channel. KRDK-TV&#x27;s offices are located on Winter Show Road in Valley City.

KRDK-TV&#x27;s transmitter tower, located near Galesburg, North Dakota, stands at . It was the second tallest man-made structure on Earth when it was built in 1966. It is currently the seventh tallest structure in the world. In the United States, it is second only to the Petronius oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico and is still the tallest broadcasting tower in the Western Hemisphere.

The station launched in December 1954 as KXJB-TV, the CBS affiliate for the market. KXJB consolidated with NBC affiliate KVLY-TV in 2003 under a local marketing agreement. In 2014, the station&#x27;s non-license assets were acquired by KVLY&#x27;s new owner Gray Television; due to increasing scrutiny by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) surrounding local marketing agreements and similar arrangements, Gray decided against having the station acquired by an affiliated third party to maintain the LMA. Its CBS programming was moved to KVLY&#x27;s second digital subchannel in December 2014 and KXJB-LD in 2016, and KXJB&#x27;s license was sold to the minority-owned Major Market Broadcasting, who re-christened the station KRDK-TV. The station returned to the air during January 2015 carrying several digital television networks.

== History ==
===As KXJB-TV===
Channel 4 signed on July 1, 1954, as KXJB-TV, owned by John Boler, with studios in Valley City and a tall transmitter tower near Pillsbury ( northeast of Valley City). KXJB was co-owned with the KX Television network in western North Dakota until 1971. KXJB moved its main studios to Fargo in 1963, and completed construction of its current tall tower site near Galesburg in 1966. The station was a CBS affiliate, and up until its sale in 2014 was the only major station in Fargo that has never changed its primary affiliation, although it shared ABC programming with WDAY-TV (channel 6) until KXGO-TV (channel 11, later KTHI-TV and now KVLY-TV) signed on in 1959. It was also an affiliate of the NTA Film Network. When West Acres Shopping Center opened in 1972, KXJB-TV had a studio in the mall, located roughly where the food court is today. The station broadcast its daytime local-origination programs from the mall and also its early evening newscast. The West Acres studio was closed in less than two years.

KXJB was one of only four CBS stations not to carry the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; when it premiered; the program aired instead on Fox affiliate KVRR (channel 15). Sioux City, Iowa affiliate KMEG also declined to alter its syndicated lineup, along with lame duck CBS affiliates WITI in Milwaukee (which would switch to Fox a year after) and WBAL-TV in Baltimore (which switched to NBC 1½ years later due to the deal between CBS and Group W). This led Sioux City to become known as the &quot;home office&quot; on &quot;Late Show&quot;; both KXJB and KMEG began airing the show in 1994.
===KXJC (CBS 35) Grand Forks===
KXJB-TV&#x27;s tower location (along with KVLY) was intended to provide a strong over-the-air signal to both the Fargo–Moorhead and Grand Forks metro areas. All of eastern North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota is considered one giant television market. The other three network affiliates (WDAY, KFME, and KVRR) do not have the reach of KVLY or KXJB/KRDK, and use full-power satellite stations to provide both their signal to the market and advertising specific to Grand Forks.

In July 2000, Catamount Broadcasting purchased the construction permit for KXJC-LP, channel 35, from Central Plains Media. KXJC signed on for the first time on November 13, 2000, as a locally focused CBS affiliate for Grand Forks. The station was known as &quot;CBS 35&quot; and was carried on Midcontinent cable channel 21 in Grand Forks. KXJB was still carried on Midcontinent cable channel 4 in Grand Forks while KXJC was on the air. Although the main KXJB signal covered Grand Forks very well (city-grade), KXJC was launched to compete against Grand Forks ABC affiliate WDAZ-TV (channel 8), a semi-satellite of WDAY-TV (channel 6) in Fargo. WDAZ had long been the only station airing a full schedule of local news for the Grand Forks area. The combination of WDAY-TV and WDAZ had long been the market&#x27;s ratings leader.

Although KXJC was considered a separate station in its own right, it was a semi-satellite of KXJB. It simulcast most of KXJB&#x27;s network and syndicated programming (although it had some shows not seen on KXJB such as &quot;Jerry Springer&quot; and &quot;Jenny Jones&quot;), but produced separate weeknight newscasts and aired its own commercials and station identifications. KXJC also had an FCC construction permit to increase power from 10,000 watts to 60,000 watts, which would have expanded the coverage area for its over-the-air signal to reach Grafton, North Dakota and Thief River Falls, Minnesota.

On April 30, 2003, KXJC went silent; its license was canceled that July. The move came several months after an agreement for NBC affiliate KVLY-TV to manage KXJB was announced.

===KXJB&#x27;s LMA with KVLY===

In 2003, Catamount entered into a local marketing agreement with KVLY-TV&#x27;s then owner, Wicks Group. In 2004, the station was consolidated into KVLY&#x27;s facilities. In November 2005, KXJB became the second major network affiliate in Fargo (after KVLY-TV) to broadcast in high definition. In 2006, KXJB and KVLY were each sold to different owners: KXJB to Parker Broadcasting and KVLY-TV to Hoak Media. Hoak&#x27;s acquisition of KVLY was approved by the FCC on November 17, 2006, while the sale of KXJB was approved in January 2007. In April 2007, KVLY-TV and KXJB-TV began simulcasting weekend newscasts, and in November, the stations began simulcasting news during weekdays under the name &quot;Valley News Live&quot;.

===Sale to Major Market Broadcasting and relaunch as KRDK===
On November 20, 2013, Parker Broadcasting announced the sale of its stations, including KXJB-TV, to Excalibur Broadcasting. The deal was concurrent with the sale of most Hoak Media stations (including KVLY-TV) to Gray Television; Excalibur&#x27;s other stations are operated by Gray under local marketing agreements. However, in response to heightened scrutiny by the FCC over LMAs and similar agreements, Gray announced that it would acquire the non-license assets of six stations from the Hoak and Parker deal, including KXJB, move their programming to digital subchannels of existing Gray stations in the affected markets (in this case, KVLY) and divest their licenses to minority-owned broadcasters who would operate them independently and not enter into any LMAs or similar agreements with Gray.

The station was eventually sold to Major Market Broadcasting (MMB), a minority-owned company whose operations include San Francisco Bay Area station KAXT-CD and the South Asian television network Diya TV. On November 12, 2014, a simulcast of KXJB&#x27;s programming was added to KVLY-DT2; on November 30, 2014, at 11:05 p.m. CT during its 10 p.m. newscast (which was delayed along with CBS&#x27; prime time schedule due to a long-running NFL game), KXJB went dark, with its CBS programming continuing on the KVLY subchannel. The purchase by Major Market Broadcasting was completed on December 18, 2014.

On December 24, MMB changed the station&#x27;s call letters to KNDF-TV; a few weeks later, on January 13, 2015, the call letters became KRDK-TV. The station began carrying Cozi TV, Grit and Escape networks upon returning to the air in January 2015. The main channel carried paid programming and required public affairs and E/I programming in the interim. KRDK rearranged its channel lineup and added Movies! and Decades networks to new subchannels in March 2015. In April 2015, KRDK-TV added Heroes &amp; Icons to subchannel 4.1 and the comedy-oriented Laff to subchannel 4.8. The station officially launched on September 25, 2015, rearranged its channel lineup, and added Bek Sports (area high school sports in collaboration with KNDB channel 26 in Bismarck and KNDM channel 24 in Minot), Comet, and Buzzr to its channel lineup. H&amp;I, Decades, and Movies! were removed in August 2016, and replaced by Bounce TV.

KRDK took the MyNetworkTV schedule as a late-night 11 p.m. to 1 a.m. offering in May 2021. In August of that year, the station picked up rights to preseason games of the Green Bay Packers.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KRDK-TV (as KXJB-TV) shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 4, on February 16, 2009, the day prior to the original date on which full-power television stations in the United States were set to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which was later rescheduled for June 12, 2009). The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 38. On August 15, 2020, the FCC licensed and approved the completion of the spectrum repack putting the station on digital channel 24, using virtual channel 4.

==Cable carriage==
From 1968 until the mid-1980s, KXJB was carried by cable systems across neighboring Manitoba and northwest Ontario. This included Winnipeg, which is several times larger than the station&#x27;s entire American coverage area. These arrangements ended in 1986, when the Canadian cable companies were granted permission to replace most of the North Dakota stations with network affiliates from Detroit due to complaints about poor reception.

After an ice storm on April 6, 1997, caused the KXJB-TV mast to collapse, some cable systems replaced KXJB with KXMB from Bismarck, KXMC from Minot, KDLO from Watertown, South Dakota, KCNC from Denver, KCCO from Alexandria, Minnesota, KCCW from Walker, Minnesota, or KDLH from Duluth (depending on location) either temporarily or permanently, to maintain CBS service.

KRDK&#x27;s 4.1 channel began being carried on most cable television systems starting in October 2016 due to must-carry. This resulted in moving KXJB (the previous occupant of the channel 4 license) to channel 9 on Midco and Sparklight to make room for KRDK on channel 4.

<doc id="1339601" wikidata="Q5639195" url="?curid=1339601" title="Hail Social">
<text>Hail Social was a rock band from Philadelphia.

The band released several self-made EPs at their concerts, sometimes referred to by color. In April, 2005, Dine Alone Productions pressed Hail Social&#x27;s first 7-inch, a limited edition single release. Their debut self-titled album was released by Polyvinyl Records in August, 2005, and their Warning Sign 7-inch came out in March, 2006, also on Polyvinyl.

<text>Melarsoprol is an arsenic-containing medication used for the treatment of sleeping sickness (African trypanosomiasis). It is specifically used for second-stage disease caused by &quot;Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense&quot; when the central nervous system is involved. For &quot;Trypanosoma brucei gambiense&quot;, eflornithine or fexinidazole is usually preferred. It is effective in about 95% of people. It is given by injection into a vein.
Melarsoprol has a high number of side effects. Common side effects include brain dysfunction, numbness, rashes, and kidney and liver problems. About 1–5% of people die during treatment, although this is tolerated due to sleeping sickness itself having a practically 100% mortality rate when untreated. In those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, red blood cell breakdown may occur. It has not been studied in pregnancy. It works by blocking pyruvate kinase, an enzyme required for aerobic metabolism by the parasite.

Melarsoprol has been used medically since 1949. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. In regions of the world where the disease is common, melarsoprol is provided for free by the World Health Organization. It is not commercially available in Canada or the United States. In the United States, it may be obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while in Canada it is available from Health Canada.

==Medical uses==
People diagnosed with trypanosome-caused disease should be treated with an anti-trypanosomal. Treatment is based on stage, 1 or 2, and parasite, &quot;T. b. rhodesiense&quot; or &quot;T. b. gambiense&quot;. In stage 1 disease, trypanosomes are present only in the peripheral circulation. In stage 2 disease, trypanosomes have crossed the blood-brain barrier and are present in the central nervous system.

The following are considerable treatment options:

Melarsoprol is a treatment used during the second stage of the disease. So far, it is the only treatment available for late-stage &quot;T. b. rhodesiense&quot;.

Due to high toxicity, melarsoprol is reserved only for the most dangerous cases. Other agents associated with lower toxicity levels are used during stage 1 of the disease. The approval of the nifurtimox-eflornithine combination therapy (NECT) in 2009 for the treatment of &quot;T. b. gambiense&quot; limited the use of melarsoprol to the treatment of second-stage &quot;T. b. rhodesiense&quot;.

Failure rates of 27% in certain African countries have been reported. This was caused by both drug resistance and additional mechanisms that have not yet been elucidated. Resistance is likely due to transport problems associated with the P2 transporter, an adenine-adenosine transporter. Resistance can occur with point mutations within this transporter. Resistance has been present since the 1970s.

==Mechanism of action==
Melarsoprol is a prodrug, a complex of melarsen oxide (a melamine derivative of phenylarsonous acid) with dimercaprol (also known as British anti-Lewisite, or BAL). It is metabolized to melarsen oxide in the body, which then acts by irreversibly binding to sulfhydryl groups on the enzyme pyruvate kinase, thus disrupting energy production in the parasite. The inability to distinguish between the host&#x27;s and the parasite&#x27;s pyruvate kinase renders this drug highly toxic, with many side effects.

Melarsen oxide also reacts with trypanothione (a spermidine-glutathione adduct that replaces glutathione in trypanosomes). It forms a melarsen oxide-trypanothione adduct (Mel T) that competitively inhibits trypanothione reductase, effectively killing the protist.

==Pharmacokinetics==
The half-life of melarsoprol is less than one hour, but bioassays indicate a 35-hour half-life. This is commonly associated with pharmacologic agents that have active metabolites. One such metabolite, melarsen oxide, reaches maximum plasma levels about 15 minutes after melarsoprol injection. Melarsoprol clearance is 21.5 ml/min/kg and the half-life of melarsen oxide is approximately 3.9 hours.

==Dosage==
Two arsenic-containing stereoisomers exist in a 3:1 molar ratio. Since melarsoprol is insoluble in water, dosage occurs via a 3.6% propylene glycol intravenous injection. To avoid the risk of injection site reactions, melarsoprol must be given slowly.

Melarsoprol used for the treatment of African trypanosomiasis with CNS involvement is given under a complicated dosing schedule. The dosing schedule for children and adults is 2–3.6 mg/kg/day intravenously for three days, then repeated every seven days for a total of three series. To monitor for relapse, follow-up is recommended every six months for at least two years.

==Side effects==
Although melarsoprol cures about 96% of people with late stage disease, its toxicity limits its use. About 1–5% of people die during treatment. As a toxic organic compound of arsenic, melarsoprol is a dangerous treatment that is typically only administered by injection under the supervision of a licensed physician. Notable side effects are similar to arsenic poisoning. Among clinicians, it is colloquially referred to as &quot;arsenic in antifreeze&quot;. Severe and life-threatening adverse reactions are associated with melarsoprol. It is known to cause a range of side effects including convulsions, fever, loss of consciousness, rashes, bloody stools, nausea and vomiting. In approximately 5–10% of cases, it causes encephalopathy. Of those, about 50% die due to encephalopathy-related adverse reactions. Additional potentially serious side effects of melarsoprol include damage to the heart, presence of albumin in the urine that could be associated with kidney damage, and an increase in blood pressure.

===Cautions===
Numerous warnings must be examined before melarsoprol treatment can be initiated. Prior to initiation, the following must be noted: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, kidney or liver disease, cardiac problems (high blood pressure, irregular beating of the heart or arrhythmias, any damage to the heart muscles and potential signs of heart failure), preexisting nervous system disorders, and any signs of leprosy.

Routine laboratory testing is needed before and after melarsoprol initiation. Laboratory parameters for both therapeutic effects and toxic effects need to be evaluated.

Blood analysis is used to detect the presence of trypanosomes. An evaluation of the cerebrospinal fluid via a lumbar puncture is also used to determine an individual&#x27;s white blood count and level of protein. These are diagnostic criteria such that the presence of trypanosomes, an elevated white blood count greater than five per microliter, or a protein content greater than 40 mg are considered abnormal and initiation should be considered. Continuous cerebrospinal fluid evaluation should be repeated every six months for at least three years in individuals that have undergone melarsoprol treatment.

To assess potential concerns related to toxicity, the following should be completed: a complete blood count, an assessment of electrolyte levels, liver and kidney function tests, and a urinalysis to detect the appearance, concentration and content of the urine.

Melarsoprol should be given using glass syringes (if they can be reliably sterilized). The propylene glycol it contains is capable of dissolving plastic.

===Pregnancy and breastfeeding===
Currently, melarsoprol is not recommended for use in pregnant women. The World Health Organization suggests that treatment be deferred until immediately after delivery since the effects of the medication on the developing fetus have not yet been established.

Lactation guidelines associated with melarsoprol have not yet been established.

==Society and culture==
Melarsoprol is produced by Sanofi-Aventis and under an agreement with the WHO, they donate melarsoprol to countries where the disease is common.

Melarsoprol was used to treat a patient with second-stage African trypanosomiasis on season 1 episode 7 &quot;Fidelity&quot; of the medical drama &quot;House MD&quot;.

==Resistance==
Drug resistance evolution is encouraged by the use of diminazene for nagana.

<text>The [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]] occurred on Sunday, December 26, 2004. The earthquake itself, with a moment magnitude of around 9.2-9.3, devastated Aceh Province, Indonesia, while the tsunami affected countries all around the Indian Ocean. Nations which were affected are listed below in alphabetical order. For detailed information about each country affected by the earthquake and tsunami, see their individual articles. Countries with a smaller number of casualties, as well as those that lost citizens who were travelling abroad, are listed further on in the article.

==Countries suffering major casualties and damage==
 India

16,269 casualties were reported on 24 November 2014, most of them in the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. There were 5,640 people missing, nearly all of them on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The death and missing tolls later decreased by over 3,000 people. 

 Indonesia

Indonesia&#x27;s Ministry of Health confirmed 131,028 deaths on June 18, 2005, mainly in the northern province Aceh of the island Sumatra. 37,000 people are missing.

 Malaysia

Despite its proximity to the incident, Malaysia escaped the kind of damage that struck countries thousands of miles further away (most of its western coast is shielded by Sumatra). The estimated number of deaths is 75 with five others missing.

 Maldives

In the Maldives, an confirmed 82 people were killed and 26 reported missing and presumed dead.

 Myanmar

Independent media reported 90 people killed in Myanmar due to the tsunami. The official death toll is 61. Witnesses in Myanmar estimated up to 600 deaths.

 Somalia

Villages and coastal communities in Somalia, as far as from the epicenter of the earthquake, were swept away and destroyed by the huge waves. 176 people were confirmed dead, 136 were missing and more than 50,000 were displaced.

 Sri Lanka

Sri Lankan authorities report 31,229 confirmed deaths, and 4,093 people missing. Other authorities are speaking from 38,940 combined dead and missing people. The south and east coasts were worst hit. Nearly 2,000 of the dead were on the &quot;Queen of the Sea&quot; holiday train destroyed by the tsunami. One and a half million people were displaced from their homes, and many orphaned or separated from their families.

 Thailand

The Thai government reports 5,395 confirmed deaths, 8,457 injuries and 2,817 missing on 20 June 2005. Damage was confined to the six southern provinces facing the Andaman Sea. The Thai government was keen to point out that the rest of the country was operating normally, and that even some resorts in the south had re-opened.

<text>Stopping power is the ability of a weapon – typically a ranged weapon such as a firearm – to cause a target (human or animal) to be incapacitated or immobilized. Stopping power contrasts with lethality in that it pertains only to a weapon&#x27;s ability to make the target cease action, regardless of whether or not death ultimately occurs. Which ammunition cartridges have the greatest stopping power is a much-debated topic.

Stopping power is related to the physical properties and terminal behavior of the projectile (bullet, shot, or slug), the biology of the target, and the wound location, but the issue is complicated and not easily studied. Although higher-caliber ammunitions usually have greater muzzle energy and momentum and thus traditionally been widely associated with higher stopping power, the physics involved are multifactorial, with caliber, muzzle velocity, bullet mass, bullet shape and bullet material all contributing to the ballistics.

Despite much disagreement, the most popular theory of stopping power is that it is usually caused not by the force of the bullet but by the wounding effects of the bullet, which are typically a rapid loss of blood causing a circulatory failure, which leads to impaired motor function and/or unconsciousness. The &quot;Big Hole School&quot; and the principles of penetration and permanent tissue damage are in line with this way of thinking. The other prevailing theories focus more on the energy of the bullet and its effects on the nervous system, including hydrostatic shock and energy transfer, which is similar to kinetic energy deposit.

==History==
The concept of stopping power appeared in the tail end of the 19th century when colonial troops (including American troops in the Philippines during the Moro Rebellion, and British soldiers during the New Zealand Wars) at close quarters found that their pistols were not able to stop charging native tribesmen. This led to the introduction or reintroduction of larger caliber weapons (such as the older .45 Colt and the newly developed .45 ACP) capable of stopping opponents with a single round.

During the Seymour Expedition in China, at one of the battles at Langfang, Chinese Boxers, armed with swords and spears, conducted a massed infantry charge against the forces of the Eight-Nation Alliance, who were equipped with rifles. At point-blank range, a British soldier had to fire four .303 Lee-Metford bullets into a Boxer before he stopped charging. U.S. Army officer Bowman McCalla reported that single rifle shots were not enough: multiple rifle shots were needed to halt a Boxer. Only machine guns were effective in immediately stopping the Boxers.

In the Moro Rebellion, Moro Muslim Juramentados in suicide attacks continued to charge against American soldiers even after being shot. Panglima Hassan in the Hassan uprising had to be shot dozens of times before he died. This forced the Americans to phase out .38 Long Colt revolvers and start using .45 Colt against the Moros.

British troops used expanding bullets during various conflicts in the Northwest Frontier in India, and the Mahdist War in Sudan. The British government voted against a prohibition on their use at the Hague Convention of 1899, although the prohibition only applied to international warfare.

In response to addressing stopping power issues, the Mozambique Drill was developed to maximize the likelihood of a target&#x27;s quick incapacitation.

&quot;Manstopper&quot; is an informal term used to refer to any combination of firearm and ammunition that can reliably incapacitate, or &quot;stop&quot;, a human target immediately. For example, the .45 ACP round and the .357 Magnum round both have firm reputations as &quot;manstoppers&quot;. Historically, one type of ammunition has had the specific tradename &quot;Manstopper&quot;. Officially known as the Mk III cartridge, these were made to suit the British Webley .455 service revolver in the early 20th century. The ammunition used a cylindrical bullet with hemispherical depressions at both ends. The front acted as a hollow point deforming on impact while the base opened to seal the round in the barrel. It was introduced in 1898 for use against &quot;savage foes&quot;, but fell quickly from favor due to concerns of breaching the Hague Convention&#x27;s international laws on military ammunition, and was replaced in 1900 by re-issued Mk II pointed-bullet ammunition.

Some sporting arms are also referred to as &quot;stoppers&quot; or &quot;stopping rifles&quot;. These powerful arms are often used by game hunters (or their guides) for stopping a suddenly charging animal, like a buffalo or an elephant.

==Dynamics of bullets==
A bullet will destroy or damage any tissues which it penetrates, creating a wound channel. It will also cause nearby tissue to stretch and expand as it passes through tissue. These two effects are typically referred to as &quot;permanent cavity&quot; (the track left by the bullet as it penetrates flesh) and &quot;temporary cavity,&quot; which, as the name implies, is the temporary (instantaneous) displacement caused as the bullet travels through flesh, and is many times larger than the actual diameter of the bullet. These phenomena are unrelated to low-pressure cavitation in liquids.

The degree to which permanent and temporary cavitation occur is dependent on the mass, diameter, material, design and velocity of the bullet. This is because bullets &quot;crush&quot; tissue, and do not cut it. A bullet constructed with a half diameter ogive designed meplat and hard, solid copper alloy material may crush only the tissue directly in front of the bullet. This type of bullet (monolithic-solid rifle bullet) is conducive to causing more temporary cavitation as the tissue flows around the bullet, resulting in a deep and narrow wound channel. A bullet constructed with a two diameter, hollow point ogive designed meplat and low-antimony lead-alloy core with a thin gilding metal jacket material will crush tissue in front and to the sides as the bullet expands. Due to the energy expended in bullet expansion, velocity is lost more quickly. This type of bullet (hollow-point hand gun bullet) is conducive to causing more permanent cavitation as the tissue is crushed and accelerated into other tissues by the bullet, causing a shorter and wider wound channel. The exception to this general rule is non-expanding bullets which are long relative to their diameter. These tend to destabilize and yaw (tumble) soon after impact, increasing both temporary and permanent cavitation.
Bullets are constructed to behave in different ways, depending on the intended target. Different bullets are constructed variously to: not expand upon impact, expand upon impact at high velocity, expand upon impact, expand across a broad range of velocities, expand upon impact at low velocity, tumble upon impact, fragment upon impact, or disintegrate upon impact.

To control the expansion of a bullet, meplat design and materials are engineered. The meplat designs are: flat; round to pointed depending on the ogive; hollow pointed which can be large in diameter and shallow or narrow in diameter and deep and truncated which is a long narrow punched hole in the end of a monolithic-solid type bullet. The materials used to make bullets are: pure lead; alloyed lead for hardness; gilding metal jacket which is a copper alloy of nickel and zinc to promote higher velocities; pure copper; copper alloy of bronze with tungsten steel alloy inserts to promote weight.

Some bullets are constructed by bonding the lead core to the jacket to promote higher weight retention upon impact, causing a larger and deeper wound channel. Some bullets have a web in the center of the bullet to limit the expansion of the bullet while promoting penetration. Some bullets have dual cores to promote penetration.

Bullets that might be considered to have stopping power for dangerous large game animals are usually 11.63 mm (.458 caliber) and larger, including 12-gauge shotgun slugs. These bullets are monolithic-solids; full metal jacketed and tungsten steel insert. They are constructed to hold up during close range, high velocity impacts. These bullets are expected to impact and penetrate, and transfer energy to the surrounding tissues and vital organs through the entire length of a game animal&#x27;s body if need be.

The stopping power of firearms when used against humans is a more complex subject, in part because many persons voluntarily cease hostile actions when shot; they either flee, surrender, or fall immediately. This is sometimes referred to as &quot;psychological incapacitation&quot;.

Physical incapacitation is primarily a matter of shot location; most persons who are shot in the head are immediately incapacitated, and most who are shot in the extremities are not, regardless of the firearm or ammunition involved. Shotguns will usually incapacitate with one shot to the torso, but rifles and especially handguns are less reliable, particularly those which do not meet the FBI&#x27;s penetration standard, such as .25ACP, .32 S&amp;W, and rimfire models. More powerful handguns may or may not meet the standard, or may even overpenetrate, depending on what ammunition is used.

Fully jacketed bullets penetrate deeply without much expansion, while soft or hollow point bullets create a wider, shallower wound channel. Pre-fragmented bullets such as Glaser Safety Slugs and MagSafe ammunition are designed to fragment into birdshot on impact with the target. This fragmentation is intended to create more trauma to the target, and also to reduce collateral damage caused from ricocheting or overpenetrating of the target and the surrounding environments such as walls. Fragmenting rounds have been shown to be unlikely to obtain deep penetration necessary to disrupt vital organs located at the back of a hostile human.

==Wounding effects==

===Physical===
Permanent and temporary cavitation cause very different biological effects. A hole through the heart will cause loss of pumping efficiency, loss of blood, and eventual cardiac arrest. A hole through the liver or lung will be similar, with the lung shot having the added effect of reducing blood oxygenation; these effects however are generally slower to arise than damage to the heart. A hole through the brain can cause instant unconsciousness and will likely kill the recipient. A hole through the spinal cord will instantly interrupt the nerve signals to and from some or all extremities, disabling the target and in many cases also resulting in death (as the nerve signals to and from the heart and lungs are interrupted by a shot high in the chest or to the neck). By contrast, a hole through an arm or leg which hits only muscle will cause a great deal of pain but is unlikely to be fatal, unless one of the large blood vessels (femoral or brachial arteries, for example) is also severed in the process.

The effects of temporary cavitation are less well understood, due to a lack of a test material identical to living tissue. Studies on the effects of bullets typically are based on experiments using ballistic gelatin, in which temporary cavitation causes radial tears where the gelatin was stretched. Although such tears are visually engaging, some animal tissues (but not bone or liver) are more elastic than gelatin. In most cases, temporary cavitation is unlikely to cause anything more than a bruise. Some speculation states that nerve bundles can be damaged by temporary cavitation, creating a stun effect, but this has not been confirmed.

One exception to this is when a very powerful temporary cavity intersects with the spine. In this case, the resulting blunt trauma can slam the vertebrae together hard enough to either sever the spinal cord, or damage it enough to knock out, stun, or paralyze the target. For instance, in the shootout between eight FBI agents and two bank robbers in the 1986 FBI Miami shootout, Special Agent Gordon McNeill was struck in the neck by a high-velocity .223 bullet fired by Michael Platt. While the bullet did not directly contact the spine, and the wound incurred was not ultimately fatal, the temporary cavitation was sufficient to render SA McNeill paralyzed for several hours. Temporary cavitation may similarly fracture the femur if it is narrowly missed by a bullet.

Temporary cavitation can also cause the tearing of tissues if a very large amount of force is involved. The tensile strength of muscle ranges roughly from 1 to 4 MPa (145 to 580 lbf/in2), and minimal damage will result if the pressure exerted by the temporary cavitation is below this. Gelatin and other less elastic media have much lower tensile strengths, thus they exhibit more damage after being struck with the same amount of force. At typical handgun velocities, bullets will create temporary cavities with much less than 1 MPa of pressure, and thus are incapable of causing damage to elastic tissues that they do not directly contact.

Rifle bullets that strike a major bone (such as a femur) can expend their entire energy into the surrounding tissue. The struck bone is commonly shattered at the point of impact.

High velocity fragmentation can also increase the effect of temporary cavitation. The fragments sheared from the bullet cause many small permanent cavities around the main entry point. The main mass of the bullet can then cause a truly massive amount of tearing as the perforated tissue is stretched.

Whether a person or animal will be incapacitated (i.e. &quot;stopped&quot;) when shot, depends on a large number of factors, including physical, physiological, and psychological effects.

===Neurological===
The only way to immediately incapacitate a person or animal is to damage or disrupt their central nervous system (CNS) to the point of paralysis, unconsciousness, or death. Bullets can achieve this directly or indirectly. If a bullet causes sufficient damage to the brain or spinal cord, immediate loss of consciousness or paralysis, respectively, can result. However, these targets are relatively small and mobile, making them extremely difficult to hit even under optimal circumstances.

Bullets can indirectly disrupt the CNS by damaging the cardiovascular system so that it can no longer provide enough oxygen to the brain to sustain consciousness. This can be the result of bleeding from a perforation of a large blood vessel or blood-bearing organ, or the result of damage to the lungs or airway. If blood flow is completely cut off from the brain, a human still has enough oxygenated blood in their brain for 10–15 seconds of wilful action, though with rapidly decreasing effectiveness as the victim begins to lose consciousness.

Unless a bullet directly damages or disrupts the central nervous system, a person or animal will not be instantly and completely incapacitated by physiological damage. However, bullets can cause other disabling injuries that prevent specific actions (a person shot in the femur cannot run) and the physiological pain response from severe injuries will temporarily disable most individuals.

Several scientific papers reveal ballistic pressure wave effects on wounding and incapacitation, including central nervous system injuries from hits to the thorax and extremities. These papers document remote wounding effects for both rifle and pistol levels of energy transfer.

Recent work by Courtney and Courtney provides compelling support for the role of a ballistic pressure wave in creating remote neural effects leading to incapacitation and injury. This work builds upon the earlier works of Suneson et al. where the researchers implanted high-speed pressure transducers into the brain of pigs and demonstrated that a significant pressure wave reaches the brain of pigs shot in the thigh. These scientists observed neural damage in the brain caused by the distant effects of the ballistic pressure wave originating in the thigh. The results of Suneson et al. were confirmed and expanded upon by a later experiment in dogs which &quot;confirmed that distant effect exists in the central nervous system after a high-energy missile impact to an extremity. A high-frequency oscillating pressure wave with large amplitude and short duration was found in the brain after the extremity impact of a high-energy missile ...&quot; Wang et al. observed significant damage in both the hypothalamus and hippocampus regions of the brain due to remote effects of the ballistic pressure wave.

===Psychological===
Emotional shock, terror, or surprise can cause a person to faint, surrender, or flee when shot or shot at. There are many documented instances where people have instantly dropped unconscious when the bullet only hit an extremity, or even completely missed. Additionally, the muzzle blast and flash from many firearms are substantial and can cause disorientation, dazzling, and stunning effects. Flashbangs (stun grenades) and other less-lethal &quot;distraction devices&quot; rely exclusively on these effects.

Pain is another psychological factor, and can be enough to dissuade a person from continuing their actions.

Temporary cavitation can emphasize the impact of a bullet, since the resulting tissue compression is identical to simple blunt force trauma. It is easier for someone to feel when they have been shot if there is considerable temporary cavitation, and this can contribute to either psychological factor of incapacitation.

However, if a person is sufficiently enraged, determined, or intoxicated, they can simply shrug off the psychological effects of being shot. During the colonial era, when native tribesmen came into contact with firearms for the first time, there was no psychological conditioning that being shot could be fatal, and most colonial powers eventually sought to create more effective manstoppers.

Therefore, such effects are not as reliable as physiological effects at stopping people. Animals will not faint or surrender if injured, though they may become frightened by the loud noise and pain of being shot, so psychological mechanisms are generally less effective against non-humans.

==Penetration==
According to Dr. Martin Fackler and the International Wound Ballistics Association (IWBA), between of penetration in calibrated tissue simulant is optimal performance for a bullet which is meant to be used defensively, against a human adversary. They also believe that penetration is one of the most important factors when choosing a bullet (and that the number one factor is shot placement). If the bullet penetrates less than their guidelines, it is inadequate, and if it penetrates more, it is still satisfactory though not optimal. The FBI&#x27;s penetration requirement is very similar at .

A penetration depth of may seem excessive, but a bullet sheds velocity—and crushes a narrower hole—as it penetrates deeper, so the bullet might be crushing a very small amount of tissue (simulating an &quot;ice pick&quot; injury) during its last two or three inches of travel, giving only between of effective wide-area penetration. Also, skin is elastic and tough enough to cause a bullet to be retained in the body, even if the bullet had a relatively high velocity when it hit the skin. About velocity is required for an expanded hollow point bullet to puncture skin 50% of the time.

The IWBA&#x27;s and FBI&#x27;s penetration guidelines are to ensure that the bullet can reach a vital structure from most angles, while retaining enough velocity to generate a large diameter hole through tissue. An extreme example where penetration would be important is if the bullet first had to enter and then exit an outstretched arm before impacting the torso. A bullet with low penetration might embed itself in the arm whereas a higher penetrating bullet would penetrate the arm then enter the thorax where it would have a chance of hitting a vital organ.

==Overpenetration==

Excessive penetration or &quot;overpenetration&quot; occurs when a bullet passes through its intended target and out of the other side, with enough residual kinetic energy to continue flying as a stray projectile and risk causing unintended collateral damage to objects or persons beyond. This happens because the bullet has not released all its energy within the target, according to the energy transfer hypothesis.

==Other hypotheses==
These hypotheses are a matter of some debate among scientists in the field:

===Energy transfer===
The energy transfer hypothesis states that for small arms in general, the more energy transferred to the target, the greater the stopping power. It postulates that the pressure wave exerted on soft tissues by the bullet&#x27;s temporary cavity hits the nervous system with a jolt of shock and pain and thereby forces incapacitation.

Proponents of this theory contend that the incapacitation effect is similar to that seen in non-concussive blunt-force trauma events, such as a knock-out punch to the body, a football player &quot;shaken up&quot; as result of a hard tackle, or a hitter being struck by a fastball. Pain in general has an inhibitory and weakening effect on the body, causing a person under physical stress to take a seat or even collapse. The force put on the body by the temporary cavity is supersonic compression, like the lash of a whip. While the lash only affects a short line of tissue across the back of the victim, the temporary cavity affects a volume of tissue roughly the size and shape of a football. Giving further credence to this theory is the support from the aforementioned effects of drugs on incapacitation. Pain killers, alcohol, and PCP have all been known to decrease the effects of nociception and increase a person&#x27;s resistance to incapacitation, all while having no effect on blood loss.

Kinetic energy is a function of the bullet&#x27;s mass and the square of its velocity. Generally speaking, it is the intention of the shooter to deliver an adequate amount of energy to the target via the projectiles. All else held equal, bullets that are light and fast tend to have more energy than those that are heavy and slow.

Over-penetration is detrimental to stopping power in regards to energy. This is because a bullet that passes through the target does not transfer all of its energy to the target. Lighter bullets tend to have less penetration in soft tissue and therefore are less likely to over-penetrate. Expanding bullets and other tip variations can increase the friction of the bullet through soft tissue, and/or allow internal ricochets off bone, therefore helping prevent over-penetration.

Non-penetrating projectiles can also possess stopping power and give support to the energy transfer hypothesis. Notable examples of projectiles designed to deliver stopping power without target penetration are Flexible baton rounds (commonly known as &quot;beanbag bullets&quot;) and the rubber bullet, types of reduced-lethality ammunition.

The force exerted by a projectile upon tissue is equal to the bullet&#x27;s local rate of kinetic energy loss, with distance formula_1 (the first derivative of the bullet&#x27;s kinetic energy with respect to position). The ballistic pressure wave is proportional to this retarding force (Courtney and Courtney), and this retarding force is also the origin of both temporary cavitation and prompt damage (CE Peters).

===Hydrostatic shock===
Hydrostatic shock is a controversial theory of terminal ballistics that states a penetrating projectile (such as a bullet) can produce a sonic pressure wave that causes &quot;remote neural damage&quot;, &quot;subtle damage in neural tissues&quot; and/or &quot;rapid incapacitating effects&quot; in living targets. Proponents of the theory contend that damage to the brain from hydrostatic shock from a shot to the chest occurs in humans with most rifle cartridges and some higher-velocity handgun cartridges. Hydrostatic shock is not the shock from the temporary cavity itself, but rather the sonic pressure wave that radiates away from its edges through static soft tissue.

====Knockback====
The idea of &quot;knockback&quot; implies that a bullet can have enough force to stop the forward motion of an attacker and physically knock them backwards or downwards. It follows from the law of conservation of momentum that no &quot;knockback&quot; could ever exceed the recoil felt by the shooter, and therefore has no use as a weapon. The myth of &quot;knockback&quot; has been spread through its confusion with the phrase &quot;stopping power&quot; as well as by many films, which show bodies flying backward after being shot.
The idea of knockback was first widely expounded in ballistics discussions during American involvement in Philippine insurrections and, simultaneously, in British conflicts in its colonial empire, when front-line reports stated that the .38 Long Colt caliber revolvers carried by U.S. and British soldiers were incapable of bringing down a charging warrior. Thus, in the early 1900s, the U.S. reverted to the .45 Colt in single action revolvers, and later adopted the .45 ACP cartridge in what was to become the M1911A1 pistol, and the British adopted the .455 Webley caliber cartridge in the Webley Revolver. The larger cartridges were chosen largely due to the Big Hole Theory (a larger hole does more damage), but the common interpretation was that these were changes from a light, deeply penetrating bullet to a larger, heavier &quot;manstopper&quot; bullet.

Though popularized in television and movies, and commonly referred to as &quot;true stopping power&quot; by uneducated proponents of large powerful calibers such as .44 Magnum, the effect of knockback from a handgun and indeed most personal weapons is largely a myth. The momentum of the so-called &quot;manstopper&quot; .45 ACP bullet is approximately that of a mass dropped from a height of . or that of a baseball. Such a force is simply incapable of arresting a running target&#x27;s forward momentum. In addition, bullets are designed to penetrate instead of strike a blunt force blow, because, in penetrating, more severe tissue damage is done. A bullet with sufficient energy to knock down an assailant, such as a high-speed rifle bullet, would be more likely to instead pass straight through, while not transferring the full energy (in fact only a very small percentage of the full energy) of the bullet to the victim. Most energy from a fully stopped rifle round instead goes into formation of the temporary cavity and the destruction of both the round, the wound channel, and some of the surrounding tissues. There is no physical principle preventing a hypervelocity round from causing a splash injury in which the ejecta create rocket-like impulse on their way out to cause knockback, and indeed, no principle preventing a similar effect for exit wounds causing &quot;knockforward&quot;, but this is still generally not anywhere near the impulse required to stop the motion of a sprinting person or knock them over from pure momentum.

Sometimes &quot;knockdown power&quot; is a phrase used interchangeably with &quot;knockback&quot;, while other times it&#x27;s used interchangeably with &quot;stopping power&quot;. The misuse and fluid meaning of these phrases have done their part in confusing the issue of stopping power. The ability of a bullet to &quot;knock down&quot; a metal or otherwise inanimate target falls under the category of momentum, as explained above, and has little correlation with stopping power.

===One-shot stop===
This hypothesis, promoted by Evan P. Marshall, is based on statistical analysis of actual shooting incidents from various reporting sources (typically police agencies). It is intended to be used as a unit of measurement and not as a tactical philosophy, as mistakenly believed by some. It considers the history of shooting incidents for a given factory ammunition load and compiles the percentage of &quot;one-shot-stops&quot; achieved with each specific ammunition load. That percentage is then intended to be used with other information to help predict the effectiveness of that load getting a &quot;one-shot-stop&quot;. For example, if an ammunition load is used in 10 torso shootings, incapacitating all but two with one shot, the &quot;one-shot-stop&quot; percentage for the total sample would be 80%.

Some argue that this hypothesis ignores any inherent selection bias. For example, high-velocity 9×19mm Parabellum hollow point rounds appear to have the highest percentage of one-shot stops. Rather than identifying this as an inherent property of the firearm/bullet combination, the situations where these have occurred need to be considered. The 9mm has been the predominantly used caliber of many police departments, so many of these one-shot-stops were probably made by well-trained police officers, where accurate placement would be a contributory factor. However, Marshall&#x27;s database of &quot;one-shot-stops&quot; does include shootings from law enforcement agencies, private citizens, and criminals alike.

Critics of this theory point out that bullet placement is a very significant factor, but is only generally used in such one-shot-stop calculations, covering shots to the torso. Others contend that the importance of &quot;one-shot stop&quot; statistics is overstated, pointing out that most gun encounters do not involve a &quot;shoot once and see how the target reacts&quot; situation. Proponents contend that studying one-shot situations is the best way to compare cartridges as comparing a person shot once to a person shot twice does not maintain a control and has no value.

===Big hole school===
This school of thought says that the bigger the hole in the target, the higher the rate of bleed-out and thus the higher the rate of the aforementioned &quot;one-shot stop&quot;. According to this theory, as the bullet does not pass entirely through the body, it incorporates the energy transfer and the overpenetration ideals. Those that support this theory cite the .40 S&amp;W round, arguing that it has a better ballistic profile than the .45 ACP, and more stopping power than a 9mm.

The theory centers on the &quot;permanent cavitation&quot; element of a handgun wound. A big hole damages more tissue. It is therefore valid to a point, but penetration is also important, as a large bullet that does not penetrate will be less likely to strike vital blood vessels and blood-carrying organs such as the heart and liver, while a smaller bullet that penetrates deep enough to strike these organs or vessels will cause faster bleed-out through a smaller hole. The ideal may therefore be a combination: a large bullet that penetrates deeply, which can be achieved with a larger, slower non-expanding bullet, or a smaller, faster expanding bullet such as a hollow point.

In the extreme, a heavier bullet (which preserves momentum greater than a lighter bullet of the same caliber) may &quot;overpenetrate&quot;, passing completely through the target without expending all of its kinetic energy. So-called &quot;overpenetration&quot; is not an important consideration when it comes to wounding incapacitation or &quot;stopping power&quot; because: (a) while a lower &quot;proportion&quot; of the bullet&#x27;s energy is transferred to the target, a higher &quot;absolute amount&quot; of energy is shed than in partial penetration, and (b) overpenetration creates an exit wound.

===Other contributing factors===
As mentioned earlier, there are many factors, such as drug and alcohol levels within the body, body mass index, mental illness, motivation levels, and gunshot location on the body which may determine which round will kill or at least catastrophically affect a target during any given situation.

<doc id="1339618" wikidata="Q777308" url="?curid=1339618" title="The Velvet Rope">
<text>The Velvet Rope is the sixth studio album by American singer Janet Jackson. It was released on October 7, 1997, through Virgin Records. Prior to its release, she renegotiated her contract with Virgin for US$80 million, marking this as the largest recording contract in history at that time.

Upon experiencing an emotional breakdown, Jackson began facing a long-term case of depression. She developed her new record as a concept album, using introspection as its theme. Its title is a metaphor for emotional boundaries; as well as an allusion to an individual&#x27;s need to feel special. Its lyrics address subject matter such as depression, self-worth, social networking, and domestic violence. It also encompasses themes of sexuality, including BDSM, sexual orientation, and same-sex relationships. Due to its sexually explicit content, the album reinforced Jackson&#x27;s public image as a sex symbol and as one of the most erotic vocalists of the 1990s. Its incorporation of social issues regarding sexual orientation and combating homophobia, also established her reputation as a gay icon and received the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Music.

The record was co-written and co-produced by Jackson, alongside her then-husband René Elizondo Jr., Jimmy Jam, and Terry Lewis, with additional contributions by various songwriters. The songs on the album also include British violinist Vanessa-Mae, Canadian singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell, and American rapper Q-Tip as featured artists. Its composition fuses various genres, including pop, R&amp;B, trip hop, folk, jazz, rock, and techno music. Considered to be Jackson&#x27;s most mature recording, it is regarded as a template for pop artists transitioning to a darker or rebellious sound and as a precursor to the development of alternative R&amp;B.

&quot;The Velvet Rope&quot; became Jackson&#x27;s fourth consecutive album to top the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It also reached the top of charts in Denmark and the top five in major markets such as Australia, Canada, France, and Germany. The album was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and has sold an estimated eight million copies worldwide. Of the six singles released from the project, &quot;Got &#x27;til It&#x27;s Gone&quot; won the 1998 Grammy Award for Best Music Video, &quot;Together Again&quot; became an international number-one hit, and &quot;I Get Lonely&quot; became Jackson&#x27;s 18th consecutive top-ten single on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, making her the only female artist in history to achieve that feat. The Velvet Rope Tour, in support of the album, drew critical acclaim for its theatricality, as well as controversy for its depictions of domestic violence and bondage.

== Background ==
Jackson&#x27;s first compilation album, &quot;Design of a Decade: 1986–1996&quot;, was released in 1995. It peaked at number three on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The lead single, &quot;Runaway&quot;, became the first song by a female artist to debut within the top ten of the Hot 100, reaching number three. &quot;Design of a Decade 1986–1996&quot; was certified double platinum by the RIAA and sold ten million copies worldwide. The release marked the fulfillment of Jackson&#x27;s contractual obligations to Virgin Records. As a result, she became subject to an industry bidding war between various parties, including Virgin, Bertelsmann, DreamWorks, Sony Music, Time Warner, and The Walt Disney Company, who attempted to sign her jointly with PolyGram. She ultimately renewed her contract with Virgin for $80 million—the largest recording contract in history at that time and a breakthrough she achieved for the second time in her career. The contract surpassed the recording industry&#x27;s then-unparalleled $60 million contracts earned by Michael Jackson and Madonna.

== Writing and development ==

During her Janet World Tour, Jackson experienced an emotional breakdown, stemming from self-hatred, childhood humiliation, self-harm, and distorted body image. She stated, &quot;I was very, very sad. Very down. I couldn&#x27;t get up sometimes. There were times when I felt very hopeless and helpless, and I felt like walls were kind of closing in on me...like you can&#x27;t escape&quot;. She questioned her career path, feeling pressured by the demands of the entertainment industry, saying, &quot;People look at you differently, as if you&#x27;re not human.&quot; Abbie Kearse of MTV responded, &quot;You&#x27;re creating a person who might not really be you, but you&#x27;ve created this fantasy woman, so when it&#x27;s time to get back to business, it&#x27;s like &#x27;I&#x27;ve got to go back to that world&#x27;&quot;. Jackson expressed concern for how she could portray an object of fantasy, feeling as if she could no longer fulfill her own desires.

In self-analysis, Jackson uncovered vital details regarding her past, saying, &quot;Certain things may happen, and you just dismiss them instead of stopping and saying, &quot;Why am I feeling this way? Why am I acting out in this way?&quot; She had suppressed various traumas throughout her adolescence and early adulthood, using evasion tactics to prevent thoughts from surfacing. She also recalled feeling unaccepted and ostracized for her skin color. She was persistently haunted by a memory of a school teacher intensely scolding her, causing her classmates to erupt in laughter. &quot;Oh, God, it sounds so stupid. But being a kid you&#x27;re just so frightened... I never talked about it, so it stayed with me all those years. I felt not deserving, not good enough... that&#x27;s still the way I feel about myself sometimes&quot;, she declared. As a child, she managed discomfort by speaking to her animals, later turning to overeating as an anesthetic, causing fluctuations in weight. Jackson said, &quot;I began to realize that whenever something really painful was going on, I would eat, and that&#x27;s how I would run away from it. But I would just be creating another problem in another area instead of just dealing with that pain&quot;.
Jackson developed body dysmorphia as a response to ridicule, stating, &quot;I&#x27;d look in the mirror and hate myself. I&#x27;d sit and cry. It was so hard for me to look at myself and find something that I liked. Not just physically, but something that was good in me&quot;. She also inflicted self-harm, banging her head against the wall when feeling unattractive. She traced her fragility to her abusive marriage to recording artist James DeBarge when she was 16 years old. Jackson recalled, &quot;It all has to do with very low self esteem. Especially going into a relationship like that very young... someone telling you things like, &#x27;no one is ever going to want you again, you should be happy here with me.&#x27;&quot; Attempting to alter his behavior and drug addiction, she explained, &quot;I learned the hard way that you can&#x27;t change a person.&quot; Recalling her divorce, she revealed, &quot;There came a point when I finally said, &#x27;You know what? I just don&#x27;t care what happens.&#x27; I had to do what I wanted to but had been too afraid to. And at that point I didn&#x27;t care if I got my brains beat out. I just went ahead and did it. And I got my ass kicked for it. But I&#x27;m happy that I did it, or I don&#x27;t think I would be here today&quot;.

Her self-hatred accelerated into raging cycles of bulimia and anorexia, repressing the issue until questioned. Jackson said, &quot;people say to me: &#x27;Okay, you&#x27;ve got to start eating more. You&#x27;re too thin.&#x27; But when you look in the mirror, you see something totally different.&quot; She continued, &quot;I had swung so far in one direction, I never thought I could swing so far in the other. You&#x27;re losing weight and getting smaller, and I&#x27;d still say to myself I could afford to lose a little more&quot;. However, she refused professional guidance, reluctant to examination. She briefly saw a psychologist before an encounter with a spiritual guru, who aided her emotional recovery. Jackson recounted, &quot;we went to this very spiritual place in the desert... That&#x27;s where I met him, this cowboy. He&#x27;s in his fifties, and he&#x27;s full of wisdom. He&#x27;s an older man who has experienced a great deal, and he used to be in the music industry, on a smaller scale. He even understood that side of my life&quot;. She also began using coffee enemas to remove &quot;sad cells&quot;, leading to media scrutiny. The trauma lead to a brief duration of sexual questioning, saying &quot;Am I curious? I think every girl has wondered&quot;. Jackson culminated the experiences into the album&#x27;s subject matter, recording over two years.

== Recording ==
The album was produced by Jackson with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, as well as René Elizondo Jr. Its initial stages began following her Janet World Tour, recording intermittently over two years. The process stalled due to various issues facing Jackson, including depression, body dysmorphia, anorexia, and self-hatred. As a result, Jackson spontaneously canceled sessions, appearing constantly troubled, as Jam commented, &quot;That was a tough album to make for her. There were times when she would not show up at the studio for five or six days in a row&quot;.

She returned to the studio in January 1997, embarking on a six-and-a-half month recording process. Its production was adjusted towards Jackson&#x27;s lyrics and vocal suggestions, using an altered technique from prior sessions. Attempting to push pop music in an alternate direction, the record was described as &quot;a triumph of the spirit, a declaration of joy and healing that comes from examining the past while energizing the present, [...] exploring the mysteries of sexuality even as it addresses the problems of prejudice&quot;. Explaining the concept and the writing of &quot;The Velvet Rope&quot;, she stated:
Singing these songs has meant digging up pain that I buried a long time ago. It&#x27;s been hard and sometimes confusing, but I&#x27;ve had to do it. I&#x27;ve been burying pain my whole life. It&#x27;s like kicking dirt under the carpet. At some point there&#x27;s so much dirt you start to choke. Well, I&#x27;ve been choking. My therapy came in writing these songs. Then I had to find the courage to sing them or else suffer the consequences — a permanent case of the blues.
== Music and lyrics ==
&quot;The Velvet Rope&quot; consists of sixteen songs and seven interludes; experimenting with various genres and darker themes. The album fused pop and R&amp;B with various genres, including jazz, folk music, and techno. Jackson stated:
Jackson described the release as her most personal work, developed throughout her entire lifetime. She explained, &quot;I never looked deeply at the pain from my past, never tried to understand that pain and work it through. It was a journey I had avoided. But one I now had to face.&quot; Robert Hilburn added, &quot;Jackson found a universal symbol to use in exploring issues of insecurity and self-worth. At some point, everyone is on the wrong side of the velvet rope, excluded because of race, social status, age or some other division.&quot; Jackson regarded commercial success as a secondary consideration, commenting, &quot;I needed to express who I was and what I&#x27;d learned. I found out who I really was... If that can inspire people who hear this album to do the same, I&#x27;d rather have that than the biggest selling album in the world.&quot;

== Themes ==
The album gained media attention for its explicit themes and exploration of homosexuality, suggested as a &quot;queer-studies thesis.&quot; Singapore law officials banned the album due to its lyrics supporting homosexuality. &quot;Free Xone&quot; speaks of gay, lesbian and bisexual pairings, as Jackson protests discrimination. &quot;Together Again&quot; recalls a departed friend lost to AIDS. Her cover of Rod Stewart&#x27;s &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; suggests losing her virginity to another woman, also alluding to bisexuality. Media attention led Stewart to announce &quot;that&#x27;s an original song by Janet Jackson&quot; when performed in concerts. In response to criticism, Jackson said, &quot;I have a lot of gay friends, men and women, and that&#x27;s why I did it. I knew people would say I was gay, and I didn&#x27;t care.&quot; She also stated, &quot;I caught a lot of hell for that... religious groups have been upset with me for certain songs on the album, but it’s not going to stop me from writing what I feel inside.&quot; Media reports of Jackson involved in intimate relationships with dancers Tina Landon and Shawnette Heard surfaced following its release, although denied.

The album&#x27;s &quot;most startling&quot; song was considered &quot;What About&quot;, in which Jackson violently confronts domestic abuse. Jackson stated, &quot;I think it&#x27;s important to let others know that certain things that you may have experienced in your life, and that they&#x27;re not alone, and that you understand what they&#x27;re going through, and that they can make it through.&quot; Joel Lyans included it among &quot;The New Soundtrack of Social Consciousness&quot;, writing, &quot;Here, Janet does what she does best: demonstrates a coy and shy demeanor before ripping into a confident and empowered voice for those who are afraid to speak up and speak out about a situation that plagues millions of women.&quot; Several media reports related its theme with President Bill Clinton&#x27;s infidelity to Hillary Clinton with Monica Lewinsky. Jackson clarified it to be about her own experience, saying, &quot;President Clinton? People have said that to me. They say &#x27;this is his song&#x27;,&quot; comparing the situation with her song &quot;This Time&quot; inaccurately related to O. J. Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson due to its subject matter.

Jackson&#x27;s progression into advanced erotic content was criticized, though she defended her material. J. D. Considine praised Jackson&#x27;s focus on intercourse &quot;as if it were simply a fact of life&quot;, noting her concern with &quot;the emotional component of sex, rather than the act itself.&quot;

== Songs ==

In &quot;Twisted Elegance&quot;, Jackson speaks over piano and white noise. Its composition addressed the &quot;emotional and sexual politics of relationships&quot;, restraints of depression, self-esteem, domestic violence, homosexuality, AIDS, and sadomasochism.
It transitions into the title track, progressing from rapid electronica into a mid-tempo techno structure. It incorporates &quot;The Exorcist&quot; theme &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; as Jackson explains &quot;a velvet rope we have inside us, keeping others from knowing our feelings&quot;, closing with a violin solo by Vanessa-Mae. &quot;You&quot; incorporates &quot;deep-down funk&quot; and trip hop, as Jackson distorts her voice in a low range during a challenge of self-scrutiny.
&quot;Got &#x27;til It&#x27;s Gone&quot; is an R&amp;B, alternative pop and trip hop song, featuring folk singer Joni Mitchell and rapper Q-Tip. Jackson speaks of vulnerability and regret in a &quot;depressive sobriety&quot;. Interlude &quot;Speakerphone&quot; consists of Jackson beginning to masturbate before a phone conversation with ex-sister-in-law Lisa Marie Presley, who was still romantically involved with Jackson&#x27;s brother Michael Jackson at the time despite the two being divorced. &quot;My Need&quot; is a mid-tempo hip hop song tackling self-obsession and unbridled lust. Interlude &quot;Fasten Your Seatbelts&quot; portrays Jackson and her dancers mimicking Bette Davis in &quot;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot; and &quot;All About Eve&quot;. &quot;Go Deep&quot; combines dance-pop and G-funk, performed in a &quot;girlish breathiness&quot;.

&quot;Free Xone&quot; incorporates &quot;slamming funk&quot; with drum and bass, derived from &quot;scratching, sampling, honey rapping, break beats and electronic accents.&quot; Jackson described it &quot;about homophobia and the pain it causes.&quot; &quot;Together Again&quot; is an uptempo house and dance-pop song; considered a &quot;modern post-disco meditation on the beauty of dance and eternal grace of romantic bonding.&quot; Interlude &quot;Online&quot; features Jackson typing before a dial-up internet connection is heard. &quot;Empty&quot; is an electronic ballad incorporating trip hop, propelled by a &quot;jittery, mellowed-out jungly beat&quot;. Its lyrics speak of the void felt through social network relationships, empathizing with those searching for acceptance via the internet. &quot;What About&quot; confronts Jackson&#x27;s experiences with domestic violence. Over flamenco guitars, she recalls a former companion proposing before violently transitioning into hard rock. &quot;Every Time&quot; is a piano ballad documenting Jackson&#x27;s fear of love, examining an apprehensive side of romance.

&quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; alludes to sexual anticipation, suggesting a lesbian encounter and potential threesome during its finale. Jackson stated, &quot;The record company tried to talk me out of it because it&#x27;s directed toward a girl. I love the song the way it is, and it&#x27;s reality for a lot of people.&quot; &quot;I Get Lonely&quot; evokes lush sensuality as Jackson speaks of abandonment over a sparse backing. &quot;Rope Burn&quot; evokes bondage and sadomasochism, as Jackson requests to be tied down and pleasured with candle wax. It was declared &quot;the first R&amp;B trip-hop ballad, retro-fitted with a lazy, jazzy beat and a spare, slap bass-heavy backing track.&quot; Jackson regarded it as a &quot;soft instrument of extended pleasure&quot;, saying, &quot;The expression of sexual fantasies can be beautiful if there&#x27;s trust, love and understanding.&quot; &quot;Anything&quot; is a ballad invoking &quot;feverish dimensions&quot; of satisfaction.

In piano ballad &quot;Special&quot;, Jackson speaks to her inner child, spreading the message that &quot;pain is not permanent&quot;, but rather, transformed. Jackson said, &quot;Getting back to that child, and giving the child what the child may have missed—the reassurance of a nourishing and accepting a love, a love that says you&#x27;re special—is hard work. It can be scary but, like the song says, we have to deal with the past to live completely—and freely—in the present.&quot; &quot;Can&#x27;t Be Stopped&quot; speaks of youth victimization, bigotry, and racial unity, &quot;directed at young people who are discouraged or discriminated against... I want them to know that their inner-strength is stronger than the forces against them.&quot;

== Packaging and title ==
&quot;The Velvet Rope&quot; was titled as a metaphor for the emotional barricade preventing others from revealing their innermost thoughts; in comparison to the velvet rope used at film premieres and award shows, prohibiting access from spectators. It also served as a metaphor for the barriers separating different classes of society. It was based on various events throughout her adolescence and early adulthood, resurfacing after attempted escapism.

The album&#x27;s artwork was photographed by Ellen von Unwerth, with additional photos by Mario Testino. The cover depicts Jackson lowering her head amidst a crimson backdrop, symbolizing remorse. &quot;Janet&quot; is faintly embossed in a pixelated block formation. Jackson stated, &quot;The shot we used on the cover shows me just looking down, and that&#x27;s what the album was about, looking inward&quot;. MTV News regarded the artwork as iconic and an influence on various artists. Its internal artwork depicts Jackson&#x27;s piercings and tattoos, also displaying her hands tied in bondage and latex attire, exhibiting fetishism. A particular photo of Jackson wearing a latex ensemble with her nipple piercing peering through an opening gained notoriety for its explicit nature. The photo also shows Jackson pricking her body with an ice pick.

Upon its release, Jackson unveiled an edgier image, flaunting hennaed red hair and tattoos on her neck, wrist, foot, back, and lower thigh; also acquiring nipple, septum, and labia piercings. The transition was considered to risk alienation, though she was commended as &quot;a master at surprising and shocking her public&quot;. Jackson used a variation of the Akan Sankofa symbol throughout its artwork and imagery; representing the motif &quot;You cannot move into the future until you learn from your past&quot;. She tattooed the symbol onto her wrist. Jackson&#x27;s tattoo artist later stated, &quot;I have a lot of people who fly in from all over the world to get something that has to do with Janet’s sacred tattoos... She&#x27;s an inspiration to a lot of people, and when they see something on Janet that helps her be strong, they want that strength as well&quot;.

== Release and promotion ==

Prior to the album&#x27;s release, &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that a large-scale marketing campaign had been organized to promote the album. Nancy Berry, then-executive vice president of Virgin Music Group Worldwide, stated that promotion for &quot;The Velvet Rope&quot;″s release were the company&#x27;s largest until then, and although the record company had planned to bring Jackson&#x27;s new album to the highest number of consumers, they did not want the campaign to be too intrusive. To handle the publishing rights to the music of Janet Jackson, company Black Doll was founded. The music industry scene had changed since Jackson&#x27;s last release, with hip-hop-flavored R&amp;B taking over mainstream music. However, Virgin executives were still confident that lead single &quot;Got &#x27;til It&#x27;s Gone&quot; would be successful. The recording company opted for a more urban promotion, using billboards and spaces in subways, as well as TV commercials.

The music video for &quot;Got &#x27;til It&#x27;s Gone&quot; premiered during the opening of the MTV Video Music Awards on September 4, 1997, where Jackson presented an award to Mark Romanek. The day before, an album listening party was held in New York City at the Chrysler Building&#x27;s Art Deco Cloud Room, reopened after sixty-five years for the event. Entertainers in attendance included Marilyn Manson, Beck, Billy Corgan, Sheryl Crow, Meredith Brooks, Diddy, Naomi Campbell, Michael Douglas and Lisa Marie Presley. On September 9, a release party for the album was set up at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California. In mid-September, Jackson went to Europe to promote the album. She performed &quot;Got &#x27;til It&#x27;s Gone&quot; on BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; show and on &quot;Graines de Star&quot; in France. Upon her return to the United States to release the album, she was interviewed on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, performing &quot;Got &#x27;til It&#x27;s Gone&quot; and &quot;Together Again&quot;.

One of the new ways to promote the album was the use of the Internet. In a collaboration with MTV, an online chat with the singer was set up. The event happened through &quot;MTV Live&quot; on October 6, 1997, the day before the album&#x27;s release. A day later, she signed copies at an album signing held at the Virgin Megastore in New York City. Jackson also promoted the album in Oceania and Asia, performing on &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot; in Australia and &quot;Hey! Hey! Hey! Music Champ&quot; in Japan. Upon returning to her promotional tour in Europe, she performed &quot;Got &#x27;til It&#x27;s Gone&quot; on French TV programs &quot;Les Années Tubes&quot;, &quot;Hit Machine&quot; along with &quot;Together Again&quot;, and Spanish television on TV show &quot;Música Sí&quot;. while also singing on Spanish TV on the shows &quot;Música Sí&quot; and &quot;Turrón y... cuenta nueva&quot;. In January, Jackson opened the American Music Awards, performing the DJ Premier remix of &quot;Together Again&quot;. She performed the following single &quot;I Get Lonely&quot; at the Soul Train Awards, with an acoustic rendition performed on the &quot;Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot;. Jackson performed a controversial rendition of &quot;What About&quot; at the VH1 Fashion Awards, displaying vignettes of domestic violence. Jackson also gave numerous interviews to several publications, including &quot;People&quot;, &quot;Vibe&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Ebony&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

On October 7, 2022, exactly 25 years after the release of the album, a deluxe version was released digitally, adding the songs &quot;Accept Me&quot; (B-side of &quot;You&quot; and &quot;Every Time&quot; singles) and &quot;God&#x27;s Stepchild&quot; (Japanese bonus track), as well as finally having the song &quot;Can&#x27;t Be Stopped&quot; as its own stand-alone track instead of being hidden. It also comes with a second &quot;component&quot; including 13 remixes.

=== Tour ===
Jackson embarked on The Velvet Rope Tour, visiting Europe, North America, Japan, New Zealand, Africa, and Australia. It used an autobiographical theme derived from elements of Broadway theater. She stated, &quot;To me, being onstage is about entertaining. I know there are people who just walk onstage and give you a show by just doing their music, but I always wanted something extra&quot;. She added, &quot;I knew what I wanted everyone to look like, especially for the opening number. I knew what I wanted everyone to wear. I visualized the whole thing&quot;. Among the first tours to use LED technology, Mark Fisher stated, &quot;She wanted to have a book opening and herself come out of it. So I finessed that book into the video screen&quot;.

Jackson&#x27;s showmanship was commended by critics, who also praised the show&#x27;s theatrics and pyrotechnics. Robert Hilburn regarded it to help Jackson &quot;finally get the credit she deserves as an artist&quot;, with the show also called &quot;the must-see concert of the year&quot;. The tour was controversial for its sexuality and portrayal of domestic violence, most notably within performances of &quot;Rope Burn&quot; and &quot;What About&quot;. Its advertisements, depicting Jackson in a transparent outfit with her nipple piercing and bikini partially visible, also drew media attention. Several publications refused to publish the ad, while billboards of the image caused traffic accidents in Europe. The tour&#x27;s HBO broadcast received over 15 million viewers, surpassing the ratings of all four major networks. It won an Emmy Award for &quot;Outstanding Technical Direction/Camera/Video for a Special&quot;. The final date at Hawaii&#x27;s Aloha Stadium became the most attended concert in the venue&#x27;s history. The tour was reported to receive a worldwide attendance of ten million in total. Jackson donated a portion of the tour&#x27;s sales to America&#x27;s Promise, an organization founded by Colin Powell to assist disenfranchised youth.

== Singles ==
&quot;Got &#x27;til It&#x27;s Gone&quot; peaked at number 36 on Hot 100 Airplay, twelve on Rhythmic Top 40 and three on Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Airplay. It was ineligible to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 due to not having a commercial single released. Internationally, it reached the top five in Denmark and New Zealand; top ten in Australia, Netherlands, Sweden, and United Kingdom and top twenty in various countries. &quot;Together Again&quot; reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, spending a record of 46 weeks on the chart. It was certified Gold by the RIAA. It reached the top two within Belgium, Netherlands, Canada, France, Germany, and Switzerland, and top five in Australia, Denmark, New Zealand, and United Kingdom. &quot;Together Again&quot; is among the biggest selling global singles in history and her highest selling single to date, exceeding six million copies.

&quot;I Get Lonely&quot; reached number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, number one on Hot Dance Single Sales and Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks, five in the United Kingdom, and fourteen on the European Hot 100. It set a record as her eighteenth consecutive top ten hit on the Hot 100, surpassed only by Elvis Presley and The Beatles. &quot;Go Deep&quot; was ineligible to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, though peaked at number twelve on Pop Songs, eight on Rhythmic Top 40, and number one on Hot Dance Club Play. Final release &quot;Every Time&quot; reached the top forty within the Netherlands and New Zealand. The success of collaborations &quot;Luv Me, Luv Me&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s It Gonna Be?!&quot; each affected the latter two singles&#x27; performances. &quot;You&quot; was a promotional single in the United Kingdom, being ineligible to chart. &quot;What About&quot; was initially planned for release, while an edit of the title track received limited test airplay. In April 2012, &quot;Rope Burn&quot; charted on Korea&#x27;s Gaon Digital Chart.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;The Velvet Rope&quot; has received acclaim amongst some criticism since its release. In a contemporary review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Jon Pareles declared it &quot;her most daring, elaborate and accomplished album&quot;, observing songs to &quot;transform themselves as they go, leaping from sharply etched cross-rhythms to lush choruses.&quot; Greg Kot from the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; regarded it a &quot;soundtrack to a therapy session&quot;, while the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; commended its content; addressing &quot;the social, emotional and sexual politics of relationships, peppering the wistful, spirited pop melodies and sinuous R&amp;B rhythms with compelling jazz, folk and techno nuances.&quot; Elysa Gardner added, &quot;provocative gestures ultimately blend in with the album&#x27;s larger agenda, which is to encourage more open-minded, free-spirited relationships of all kinds... with hooks this strong and grooves this delicious, Jackson&#x27;s authority should be of question to no one.&quot; MTV News declared it an &quot;interesting step in a new direction&quot; and &quot;long, sometimes strange trip into Jackson&#x27;s sensual world&quot;. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; called it &quot;a richly dark masterwork&quot;, illustrating &quot;there is nothing sexier than emotional nakedness&quot;. Robert Christgau noted Jackson&#x27;s vocal cadence, retaining &quot;her magical ability to feign delight&quot;. Keith Harris stated it &quot;plumbed introspective depths with intriguing results&quot;.

In his review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Vince Aletti praised its &quot;unusu-ally busy, electronica- spiked soundscape&quot;, revealing &quot;the process of psychic reconstruction&quot;. Aletti added, &quot;she combines a pure pop sensibility with ambition, vulnerability, freakishness, and extraordinary savvy. She&#x27;s--in her inadequate word--special&quot;. However, Jackson&#x27;s &quot;isolating control&quot; was regarded as its &quot;more bracing&quot; material. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; observed its subject matter of &quot;computer liaisons to bondage and bisexuality&quot;, finding the most pervasive theme to be love. Roger Catlin of &quot;The Courant&quot; noted its aura &quot;washes away her sometimes strident political messages or her attempt to shock with sexuality&quot;, adding, &quot;the album shimmers with sensuality, openness and thirst for new adventures, musically and otherwise.&quot; Len Righi of &quot;The Morning Call&quot; called it &quot;compelling, as she tackled almost every imaginable social ill and personal problem while still leaving room for freakiness and fun.&quot; Jane Dark of &quot;City Pages&quot; stated it &quot;eludes genre-fication&quot;, leaving Jackson &quot;in a genre of her own&quot;. Alluded to &quot;an eroticon of cybersex, queer positivity, and mild bondage&quot;, Dark regarded its production &quot;a sexy motherfucker... abstractly electro tones come and go with sharp attack and sharper decay, appearing out of--and vanishing into--aggressively blank spaces&quot;. Jackson&#x27;s &quot;flawed sweetness&quot; was also acclaimed; concluding, &quot;She&#x27;s the principle that organizes the noise, and the particle around which songs become pearlescent&quot;. &quot;USA Today&quot; praised her usage of &quot;edgier beats and rawer emotions&quot;.

The length of &quot;The Velvet Rope&quot; drew criticism from certain music critics. In a less enthusiastic mixed review, AllMusic observed a &quot;hardened, sexually experimental Janet&quot;; however, its writer claimed that &quot;the best moments sink into the murk&quot;, and that &quot;there are good moments on &quot;The Velvet Rope&quot;, but at its running time [...] it&#x27;s hard to work up the patience to find them&quot;. In a retrospective review, BBC Music stated that &quot;[i]t&#x27;s far too long. It does feel like you&#x27;ve given over a considerable chunk of your life to it by its end, an unfortunate by-product of the CD era with its overriding desire to fill up every last second of each disc&quot;. However, a positive review of the record was given on the whole, with its author calling it &quot;[m]ature and experimental... Possibly the great lost 90s trip hop album&quot;.

In October 2022, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; reviewed the deluxe edition of the album with a rating of 9.4 out of 10

== Legacy ==

&quot;Billboard&quot; commended it as &quot;her most personal and intimate work to date&quot;, confronting &quot;domestic abuse, AIDS, and homophobia with her most sexually explicit songs ever.&quot; Jackson stated, &quot;That was a crossroads for me: sharing what I&#x27;d been going through personally and how I felt about what was happening in the world.&quot; Kyra Phillips of CNN declared it &quot;difficult and very intimate&quot;, exploring &quot;Jackson&#x27;s darker side, her emotional break down and the secret that shocked the world.&quot; Regarding its content, Jackson said, &quot;I’m sure it did alienate a lot of people, but that’s what I was feeling, and I wanted to write about it, so&quot; I did.&quot; Jackson later stated:

Ryam Dombal of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; considered it a pioneer of &quot;the &#x27;dark&#x27; and/or &#x27;mature″&quot; pop album, saying, &quot;the rebel record is now a &quot;de rigueur&quot; coming-of-age manoeuvre.&quot; &quot;City Pages&quot; called it a &quot;gem&quot; which foresaw &quot;damn near every rhythmic trend of the decade: Timbaland&#x27;s drum &#x27;n&#x27; stutter, quick-stepping house, and walloping slabs of techno.&quot; Its innovation was cited as fusing &quot;compelling jazz, folk and techno nuances&quot; with trip hop and contemporary pop. MTV News also noted its &quot;number of stylistic twists you might never associate with such a mainstream diva.&quot; In particular, &quot;Empty&quot; was commended for its theme of relationships via social networking, considered a prediction of subsequent technology.

Eve Barlow of &quot;NME&quot; included it among seven albums considered &quot;Perfect from Start to Finish&quot;, stating: &quot;Jackson had already begun pushing the boundaries of sexually explicit pop but it’s &quot;The Velvet Rope&quot; that cemented her as a free, liberal voice for experimentation.&quot; Its blend of &quot;new electro&quot; and trip-hop was thought to &quot;meld seamlessly&quot;; its lyrical content also thought to push society&#x27;s &quot;judgment calls&quot;, breaking free from &quot;the American sweetheart of past LPs.&quot; Shayne Lee, author of &quot;Erotic Revolutionaries: Black Women, Sexuality, and Popular Culture&quot; (2010), wrote that the album and its predecessor &quot;brand[ed] her as one of the most sexually stimulating vocalists of the 1990s.&quot; Jessica Skolnik of &quot;Vice&quot; stated, &quot;I am of the Madonna generation, the Janet generation... &quot;The Velvet Rope&quot; was an absolute milestone and, in my mid-thirties, is increasingly meaningful to me.&quot; &quot;Telegram &amp; Gazette&quot; stated, &quot;Jackson shows once again that she can compete against any of the lightweight, mega-selling pop divas and hang them out to dry.&quot; According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, the album became &quot;more eagerly anticipated&quot; than Michael Jackson&#x27;s output; taking her &quot;once and for all out of the shadow.&quot; Sal Cinquemani declared it &quot;Janet&#x27;s richest work to date&quot;, while Brannon Smith heralded it to reveal &quot;her battle with depression, and saw her continue to empower through her pain.&quot;

== Influence ==
Nicole Scherzinger cited it as the inspiration for her second album. Rihanna&#x27;s &quot;Rated R&quot; drew comparisons for its production and &quot;nakedly autobiographical vibe&quot;; the theme of single &quot;Te Amo&quot; also likened to Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot;. The &quot;burbly electro hooks&quot; and &quot;curled-lip sass&quot; of Rihanna&#x27;s &quot;Talk that Talk&quot; was also regarded as &quot;warmed-over &quot;Velvet Rope&quot;-era Janet Jackson&quot;. About.com noted Patrick Stump&#x27;s &quot;Soul Punk&quot; to incorporate the album&#x27;s &quot;musical stylings&quot;. The packaging of Usher&#x27;s &quot;8701&quot; was also thought to recall its imagery. French singer Piu Piu also called it a primary influence.
Drew Millard of &quot;Vice&quot; stated the album &quot;inadvertently predicts most of the cooler trends in contemporary indie music,&quot; saying, &quot;Dam-Funk&#x27;s bedroom-keyb attack? &quot;Go Deep&quot; did it. &quot;Together Again&quot; is basically the song Disclosure has been shooting for this entire time, and Tom Krell would wrestle an alligator with his bare hands to create a song as chillingly beautiful as &quot;Empty&quot;. How to Dress Well cites its &quot;schizophrenic diversity&quot; as the inspiration for the album &quot;Total Loss&quot;, saying, &quot;She set such an example for trusting yourself, and following that intuition wherever it takes you... she made a fucking sprawling masterpiece with a song from every genre, and it works.&quot; Merchandise sold at Well&#x27;s shows feature a quote from interlude &quot;Memory&quot;. Indie rock band Wheat used the album as a reference for their second album &quot;Hope and Adams&quot;, also emulating its production techniques within lead single &quot;Don&#x27;t I Hold You&quot;. Folk rock singer Melissa Ferrick called it &quot;a huge record&quot; which inspired her song &quot;Drive&quot;, saying, &quot;Janet Jackson was making these sexual noises on that record and I cannot even describe. [...] I was like &quot;This is unbelievable. Janet Jackson is so ballsy to do this. This is amazing.&quot; Cassie Ramone of Vivian Girls and folk singer Seth Glier regarded the album as an important life memoir. Swedish singer Beatrice Eli stated it &quot;defined her teenage years&quot;. &quot;Art Nouvea&quot; considered Fiona Apple&#x27;s &quot;When the Pawn...&quot; to be influenced by the record. FKA Twigs&#x27; single &quot;Water Me&quot; and Laura Welsh&#x27;s &quot;Unravel&quot; were likened to the album, considered to evoke Jackson&#x27;s &quot;mellower work&quot; at her &quot;most delicate&quot;. Kingdom&#x27;s &quot;Bank Head&quot;, featuring Kelela, was thought to be influenced by &quot;Empty&quot;, while Kelela and Tink&#x27;s &quot;Want It&quot; was likened to the album&#x27;s &quot;most tuneful deep cuts&quot;. British singer Jai Paul&#x27;s &quot;Str8 Outta Mumbai&quot; was regarded to fuse &quot;vintage Bollywood pop&quot; with &quot;&quot;Velvet Rope&quot;-era Janet&quot;.

It also paved the way for mainstream artists to incorporate darker themes into their music while tapping their personal lives as inspiration — with Beyoncé&#x27;s &quot;Beyoncé&quot; and &quot;Lemonade&quot; albums as well as Rihanna’s &quot;Rated R&quot; and &quot;Anti&quot; albums being prime examples.

The Weeknd&#x27;s &quot;Thursday&quot; was likened to an attempted &quot;male equivalent&quot; of the record. Kelly Rowland&#x27;s &quot;Talk a Good Game&quot; drew comparisons for its revealing theme and production. Rowland&#x27;s single &quot;Dirty Laundry&quot; was influenced by &quot;What About&quot;, while single &quot;Gone&quot;, featuring Wiz Khalifa, was inspired by &quot;Got &#x27;til It&#x27;s Gone&quot;. TLC&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Good at Being Bad&quot; was inspired by the production and content of Jackson&#x27;s &quot;What About&quot;. Solange&#x27;s &quot;True EP&quot; was compared within its production from Dev Hynes. The composition of single &quot;Losing You&quot; was also likened to &quot;Together Again&quot; for its melancholy theme within an &quot;uplifting&quot; dance song. Illangelo&#x27;s &quot;Clockwork&quot; was also thought to recall the album. In hip hop, Odd Future collective The Internet were compared to &quot;&#x27;‘&quot;Velvet Rope&quot;-era Janet&quot; for their single &quot;Cocaine&quot;. Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;808s &amp; Heartbreak&quot; was also likened to the album. Jay-Z compared his song &quot;December 4th&quot; to &quot;Got &#x27;til It&#x27;s Gone&quot; in his memoir, &quot;Decoded&quot;. Joe Budden sampled the title track in the song &quot;Velvet Rope&quot;. In jazz, its singles have been covered by Boney James and Gene Dunlap, with the title track covered by Paul Taylor and &quot;Anything&quot; by Will Downing. The album is considered to have influenced the development of alternative R&amp;B, associated with acts such as Frank Ocean, Miguel, SZA and others.

Psychologist Alan Downs&#x27; book &quot;The Velvet Rage&quot; was titled after the album and its homosexual content; demonstrating &quot;how to heal the trauma of being a gay man in an uncompromisingly straight world.&quot; Transgender activist Janet Mock named herself after Jackson and the album&#x27;s themes of sexual orientation, stating, &quot;she was so open and raw. She was talking about her sexual fluidity. She was talking about access and elitism with the velvet rope, who gets to come in, who doesn’t. She was talking about domestic violence. All of these things within this album... my mind was blown. I couldn’t believe someone was talking about all of these issues that were paralleling my own life.&quot; &quot;Speaker Phone&quot; was referenced by comedian Sandra Bernhard during a monologue in &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here... Damn It!&quot;. The album was also mentioned in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode, &quot;And the Wiener Is...&quot;

<text>The CSS Zen Garden is a World Wide Web development resource &quot;built to demonstrate what can be accomplished visually through CSS-based design.&quot; It launched in May 2003.

Style sheets contributed by graphic designers from around the world are used to change the visual presentation of a single HTML file, producing hundreds of different designs. Aside from reference to an external CSS file, the HTML markup itself never changes. All visual differences are the result of the CSS (and supporting imagery).

== History ==
CSS Zen Garden brought five designs at launch.

The website was inspired by a CSS-related contest from HotBot, by web developer Chris Casciano&#x27;s experiment called &quot;Daily CSS Fun&quot;, as well as the Web Standards Project&#x27;s efforts to get CSS adopted more widely by designers. Considered &quot;one of the best-known and most inspirational projects to come out of to the web standards movement,&quot; the site has succeeded at &quot;raising aesthetic standards on the web and enriching web design.&quot; The noted web standards advocate Jeffrey Zeldman observes: &quot;Hundreds of designers have made their mark -- and sometimes their reputations -- by creating Zen Garden layouts, and tens of thousands all over the world have learned to love CSS because of it.&quot;

CSS Zen Garden has been translated into several languages and inspired similar sites in other languages.

In February 2005, &quot;The Zen of CSS Design&quot; (Peachpit Press) was published by CSS Zen Garden creator Dave Shea and web designer Molly Holzschlag. The book is based on 36 designs featured at the Zen Garden site.

Active development of the site stopped in April 2008. However, on May 7, 2013, for the site&#x27;s tenth anniversary, Shea opened up submissions again, focusing on HTML5, CSS3 and current design principles.
There are currently 218 listed designs for the Zen Garden.

<doc id="1339623" wikidata="Q3140956" url="?curid=1339623" title="Humanitarian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake">
<text>The humanitarian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake of a magnitude of 9.1 was prompted by one of the worst natural disasters of modern times. On December 26, 2004, the earthquake, which struck off the northwest coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra, generated a tsunami that wreaked havoc along much of the rim of the Indian Ocean. Particularly hard-hit were the countries of Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka and Thailand. About 230,000 people were killed, tens of thousands more were injured, and 1.7 million became homeless and displaced.

== Contributing countries and supra-national organizations ==
Asian expatriates, governments, humanitarian organisations and individuals around the world arrived, eager to offer aid and technical support. Such was the global scope of the disaster that the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters was activated in quick succession by the French Civil Protection Agency, the Indian space agency ISRO, and by UNOOSA on behalf of UNOPS, thus providing a wide variety of humanitarian satellite imagery to aid and rescue organisations. The World Bank initially estimated the amount of aid needed
at US$5 billion. Although numerous countries provided help for relief and assistance, the UN criticised both the US and Europe for providing inadequate resources. By 1 January 2005 over US$1.8 billion (£1bn) had been pledged.

In wake of the disaster, Australia, India, Japan and the United States formed a coalition to coordinate aid efforts to streamline immediate assistance. However, at the Jakarta Summit on 6 January 2005, the coalition transferred responsibilities to the United Nations.

=== Criticism of donor response ===
Throughout the entire period of the main response to the tsunami disaster – from December 2004 for the next four or five years – there was much debate about both the size and form of way that assistance was delivered. For example, just one day after the tsunami, on 27 December 2004, UN Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Jan Egeland reportedly categorised the contributions of rich countries as &quot;stingy&quot;. This was widely misinterpreted in the media as categorising the overall response to the tsunami whereas Mr Egeland later explained that at the time he had been making a general remark about overall global aid flows in recent years. Speaking at a press conference later Mr. Egeland said, &quot;It has nothing to do with any particular country or the response to this emergency. We are in early days and the response has so far been overwhelmingly positive&quot;. The U.S. government, led by President George W. Bush and Secretary of State Colin Powell, added another US$20 million on 28 December to the original U.S pledge of US$15 million, bringing the total up to US$35 million (not including direct aid rendered by naval vessels dispatched to the region). Initially, the U.S. Navy dispatched P-3C Orion patrol aircraft and an aircraft carrier to assist with relief operations.

On 31 December the US pledge was increased tenfold to US$350 million, with President Bush saying that that amount would probably increase further. President Bush also signed a decree ordering flags to be flown at half-mast during the first week of the new year.

During the early period of the response to the tsunami, concerns were voiced in various quarters that the international relief effort might falter if nations did not honour their initial pledges. On 3 January 2005, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged donor nations to ensure that their pledges were fully honoured, pointing to previous cases where &quot;we got lots of pledges, but we did not receive all the money&quot;.

On 5 January, as countries jockeyed to make large donations, Jan Egeland said, &quot;I&#x27;d rather see competitive compassion than no compassion&quot;, adding that too many countries were making pledges without any guarantee that the funds would arrive. Following the earthquake the previous year in Iran in Bam which killed 26,000 people, Iranian officials claimed to have received just US$17.5 million of the US$1 billion originally pledged. In mid-March 2005, the Asian Development Bank reported that the provision of over US$4 billion in aid promised by governments was behind schedule. Sri Lanka criticised the nations and organisations that clamoured to pledge donations, &quot;Not a penny had come through yet. We are doing the relief work with our government money. Sri Lanka is still waiting for the money pledged by the donors. Money pledged by the people has been pledged to the NGOs.&quot;

Sri Lanka&#x27;s Foreign Minister, Lakshman Kadirgamar, stated in a BBC interview, &quot;A lot of aid what has been coming in latterly is I&#x27;m afraid – I&#x27;m sorry to say – not very useful. For instance there was a container full of teddy bears. They&#x27;re obviously given with good will, nobody says no to that.&quot; The patience of tsunami affected nations was being stretched: &quot;Now the government had worked out a scheme that until 26 April everything that has come, everything that will be on the seas will be admitted tax free. After that, no!&quot;. Kadirgamar went on to say, &quot;For instance we do not need rice, we are expecting a bumper harvest, anyone who sends rice is wasting their time and money.&quot;

Many commentators claim excessive and competitive donor responses threaten less dramatic but equally important relief efforts elsewhere. &quot;While everyone opens up their coffers for these disasters, the ongoing toll from malaria, AIDS and tuberculosis is much larger than these one-time events&quot;, said Enriqueta Bond, president of the US Burroughs Wellcome Fund. &quot;We would do more good to invest in prevention and good public-health measures such as clean water&quot;. Tony Blair, the British prime minister, also expressed concern that tsunami aid could detract from other pressing development needs. He pointed out that there was a disaster comparable to a &quot;preventable tsunami every week in Africa&quot;, where 10,000 people die daily from AIDS and malaria alone.

=== Criticism of recipient response ===
In the early stages, before the extent of the disaster was clear, Sri Lanka refused Israel&#x27;s offers of aid, objecting to the inclusion of 60 Israeli soldiers in the 150-person mission planned by Israel&#x27;s army, to set up field hospitals, including internal medicine and paediatric clinics, an Israeli army spokesman reported to BBC. Later, the Israeli humanitarian organization sent a jumbo jet carrying 18.5 tonnes of supplies to Colombo, however, and a rescue-and-recovery team from the Jewish ultra-Orthodox organization ZAKA arrived in Colombo with equipment used for identifying bodies, as well as body bags.
Corruption, bureaucracy and nationalism hampered the humanitarian response in Indonesia.

In Sri Lanka, only 30% of those eligible affected by the tsunami as of 10 February had received any aid, and there were allegations of local officials giving aid only to their supporters, some of whom were not victims of the tsunami. The Sri Lankan government has set up a &quot;Special Complaint Unit&quot; for citizens to record grievances.

=== List of donors ===
The following table is a partial listing of cash commitments from various governments and nongovernmental organisations, taken from and other sources:

=== Pledged amounts as percentages of GDP ===
The table below examines the amounts pledged for humanitarian efforts in light of rough national economic power, which is arguably a more useful measure. There are a number of caveats that should be kept in mind while reading the table:
# The figures do not include the cost of operating military resources deployed to provide aid, and it is unclear how this should be quantified. While some would argue that military resources are already paid for and that the relief effort can be regarded as a logistics training exercise, the increased operational costs are an unbudgeted expenditure. Others would argue that the military resources provide the only infrastructure that will deliver aid in a timely manner to save lives to the hardest hit and neediest areas, and without this quickly deployable infrastructure the other contributions, no matter how large would be useless or arrive too late.
# The figures do not tell anything about the rate in which the money will be spent. How much of the money is going to be spent this year and how much is reserved for long-term reconstructions efforts is not reflected by this table.
# Use of gross domestic product or gross national product should be treated with caution as this does not accurately measure a country&#x27;s ability to provide aid. Similarly, whether to use &#x27;nominal&#x27; or &#x27;real&#x27; GNP/GDPs can be argued. Some GDP/GNP figures are also out of date e.g. for the year 2002, or even 2001, so comparisons between countries may not be for the same time period. A better comparison might be used by examining purchasing power parity-adjusted GDP/GNP figures (as used in the CIA factbook).
# It can be argued, the quality of aid differs as &quot;aid&quot; is an ambiguous term that may cover a wide variety of methods, including &#x27;soft&#x27; loans (where the money has to be repaid with interest albeit at below market rates), and &#x27;tied aid&#x27; (where the money has to be spent buying goods and services from the donating country). The terms by which the aid is accepted play a large role in determining how useful it is and also affect the relative cost to the donating country.
# This is aid for one particular disaster. Without knowing how much aid the various countries and their people donate to other disasters, one cannot draw conclusions on their overall level of generosity.
# The numbers below are the pledged contributions. Arguably, only funds that are actually transferred should be counted. For example, after the Bam earthquake in December 2003, the Iranian government received only US$17.5 million from the US$1 billion of international donations that had been promised.
#The amounts pledged by individual member states of the European Union should be increased by amounts pledged by the European Union itself.
With all the caveats in mind, the following table lists some countries in order of nominal aid donated divided by GDP.

=== Pledged amounts on a per capita basis ===
– Another way of looking at the figures.

=== Asia Pacific ===
=== Europe ===
=== Middle East and Africa ===
=== Americas ===
== Contributing non-governmental organisations (NGOs) ==
The income of non-governmental organisations and multilateral organisations is derived from many sources, including earned revenues, grants, philanthropic donors, corporations, governments and other groups. For example, the African Union&#x27;s contribution is financed by its member states. The following &quot;contributions&quot; may be viewed as either a diversion of funds originally earmarked for other purposes or increased donations to the contributing organisation.

== Contributing corporations ==
A much more complete list of American corporate donations may be found at .
== Fundraising events ==
There were numerous large-scale fundraising events with hundreds of participants around the world.

=== World Cricket Tsunami Appeal ===
Two of the nations most affected by the tsunami, India and Sri Lanka, are leading cricket-playing nations. The International Cricket Council has launched the World Cricket Tsunami Appeal to raise funds for the humanitarian effort. The highlight of this was a two-match One Day International series between a World XI and an Asian XI.

It has been reported on Cricinfo that the first of these matches raised A$8.4 million.

Other matches, such as those in late January 2005 between the New Zealand national team and a World XI also had fundraising as a primary aim.

<text>A warehouse club (or wholesale club) is a retail store, usually selling a wide variety of merchandise, in which customers may buy large, wholesale quantities of the store&#x27;s products, which makes these clubs attractive to both bargain hunters and small business owners. The clubs are able to keep prices low due to the no-frills format of the stores. They are distinguished from traditional cash-and-carry wholesale businesses in that their warehouses are substantially larger in size, and they do not cater purely to businesses but also allow some or all types of consumers to obtain memberships. They are also distinguished from warehouse stores in that they usually charge annual membership fees, and require presentation of proof of membership at the warehouse entrance and again at the point of sale.

Membership in a warehouse club superficially resembles that in a consumers&#x27; cooperative, but lacks key elements including cooperative ownership and democratic member control. The use of members&#x27; prices without cooperative ownership is also sometimes used in bars and casinos.

==History==
In 1976, Sol Price (who in 1954 founded FedMart, an early US discount store) and his son Robert Price founded Price Club in San Diego, as their first warehouse club. In a 1988 article, &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; credited Price Club as the &quot;pioneer&quot; of the warehouse club retail format. After his departure from FedMart, Sol Price noticed that small businesses in San Diego either ordered directly from four or five large wholesalers or they bought locally from relatively small cash-and-carry wholesalers. Therefore, Price Club was originally positioned as a much larger, volume-oriented version of the cash-and-carry wholesale format, meaning that prospective members were required to present resale certificates or professional licenses. Based on a customer&#x27;s suggestion, Price Club subsequently allowed government employees to apply for memberships. This privilege was later extended to employees of utility companies and hospitals, followed by members of certain credit unions and savings deposit clubs.

In 1982, the discount pioneer John Geisse founded The Wholesale Club of Indianapolis, which he sold to Sam&#x27;s Club (a division of Walmart) in 1991.

In 1983, James (Jim) Sinegal and Jeffrey H. Brotman opened the first Costco warehouse in Seattle. Sinegal had started in wholesale distribution by working for Sol Price at FedMart. 

In 1983, Kmart&#x27;s Pace Membership Warehouse (later sold to Sam&#x27;s Club) started operations. That same year, Sam Walton opened the first Sam&#x27;s Club on April 7, in Midwest City, Oklahoma.

In 1984, former The Wholesale Club executives founded BJ&#x27;s Wholesale Club, owned by Zayre.

As of 1988, Price Club was the leader of the warehouse club industry, with over 40 warehouses operating across the United States and Canada. Stephen F. Mandel, Jr., then a Goldman Sachs analyst, called the warehouse club &quot;the greatest revolution in retailing in the last 10 years.&quot; 

By 1992, Sam&#x27;s Club had surged past both Price Club and Costco to become the industry leader with 222 warehouse clubs. The four other major players were Pace (95 clubs), Costco (87 clubs), Price Club (80 clubs) and BJ&#x27;s (31 clubs). Analysts were already seeing signs of market saturation along the West Coast of the United States, the first region in which warehouse clubs were developed. 

In 1993, Costco and Price Club agreed to merge operations, after Price declined an offer from Sam Walton and Walmart to merge Price Club with Sam&#x27;s Club. Costco&#x27;s business model and size were similar to those of Price Club, which made the merger more natural for both companies. The combined company took the name PriceCostco, and memberships became universal, meaning that a Price Club member could use their membership to shop at Costco and vice versa. PriceCostco boasted 206 locations generating $16billion in annual sales. PriceCostco was initially led by executives from both companies, but in 1994, the Price brothers left the company to form Price Enterprises, a warehouse club chain in Central America and the Caribbean unrelated to the current Costco.

In 1997, Costco changed its name to Costco Wholesale Corporation, and all remaining Price Club locations were rebranded 

, the three largest warehouse club chains operating in the United States are BJs, Costco, and Sam&#x27;s Club. BJ&#x27;s Wholesale Club is one of the smaller competitors, with stores located primarily in the Eastern United States. Costco and Sam&#x27;s Club are the largest chains. Costco has locations in seven other nations and regions including Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. Sam&#x27;s Club, a division of Walmart, claims a membership base of 47 million persons and 602 stores across the United States (as of June 2019).

<doc id="1339640" wikidata="Q331222" url="?curid=1339640" title="Oversampling">
<text>In signal processing, oversampling is the process of sampling a signal at a sampling frequency significantly higher than the Nyquist rate. Theoretically, a bandwidth-limited signal can be perfectly reconstructed if sampled at the Nyquist rate or above it. The Nyquist rate is defined as twice the bandwidth of the signal. Oversampling is capable of improving resolution and signal-to-noise ratio, and can be helpful in avoiding aliasing and phase distortion by relaxing anti-aliasing filter performance requirements.

A signal is said to be oversampled by a factor of &quot;N&quot; if it is sampled at &quot;N&quot; times the Nyquist rate.

==Motivation==
There are three main reasons for performing oversampling: to improve anti-aliasing performance, to increase resolution and to reduce noise.

===Anti-aliasing===
Oversampling can make it easier to realize analog anti-aliasing filters. Without oversampling, it is very difficult to implement filters with the sharp cutoff necessary to maximize use of the available bandwidth without exceeding the Nyquist limit. By increasing the bandwidth of the sampling system, design constraints for the anti-aliasing filter may be relaxed. Once sampled, the signal can be digitally filtered and downsampled to the desired sampling frequency. In modern integrated circuit technology, the digital filter associated with this downsampling is easier to implement than a comparable analog filter required by a non-oversampled system.

===Resolution===
In practice, oversampling is implemented in order to reduce cost and improve performance of an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) or digital-to-analog converter (DAC). When oversampling by a factor of N, the dynamic range also increases a factor of N because there are N times as many possible values for the sum. However, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increases by formula_1, because summing up uncorrelated noise increases its amplitude by formula_1, while summing up a coherent signal increases its average by N. As a result, the SNR increases by formula_1. 

For instance, to implement a 24-bit converter, it is sufficient to use a 20-bit converter that can run at 256 times the target sampling rate. Combining 256 consecutive 20-bit samples can increase the SNR by a factor of 16, effectively adding 4 bits to the resolution and producing a single sample with 24-bit resolution.

The number of samples required to get formula_4 bits of additional data precision is

:formula_5

To get the mean sample scaled up to an integer with formula_4 additional bits, the sum of formula_7 samples is divided by formula_8:

:formula_9

This averaging is only effective if the signal contains sufficient uncorrelated noise to be recorded by the ADC. If not, in the case of a stationary input signal, all formula_8 samples would have the same value and the resulting average would be identical to this value; so in this case, oversampling would have made no improvement. In similar cases where the ADC records no noise and the input signal is changing over time, oversampling improves the result, but to an inconsistent and unpredictable extent.

Adding some dithering noise to the input signal can actually improve the final result because the dither noise allows oversampling to work to improve resolution. In many practical applications, a small increase in noise is well worth a substantial increase in measurement resolution. In practice, the dithering noise can often be placed outside the frequency range of interest to the measurement, so that this noise can be subsequently filtered out in the digital domain—resulting in a final measurement, in the frequency range of interest, with both higher resolution and lower noise.

===Noise===
If multiple samples are taken of the same quantity with uncorrelated noise added to each sample, then because, as discussed above, uncorrelated signals combine more weakly than correlated ones, averaging &quot;N&quot; samples reduces the noise power by a factor of &quot;N&quot;. If, for example, we oversample by a factor of 4, the signal-to-noise ratio in terms of power improves by factor of four which corresponds to a factor of two improvement in terms of voltage.

Certain kinds of ADCs known as delta-sigma converters produce disproportionately more quantization noise at higher frequencies. By running these converters at some multiple of the target sampling rate, and low-pass filtering the oversampled signal down to half the target sampling rate, a final result with &quot;less&quot; noise (over the entire band of the converter) can be obtained. Delta-sigma converters use a technique called noise shaping to move the quantization noise to the higher frequencies.

==Example==
Consider a signal with a bandwidth or highest frequency of &quot;B&quot; = 100 Hz. The sampling theorem states that sampling frequency would have to be greater than 200 Hz. Sampling at four times that rate requires a sampling frequency of 800 Hz. This gives the anti-aliasing filter a transition band of 300 Hz ((&quot;f&quot;s/2) − &quot;B&quot; = (800 Hz/2) − 100 Hz = 300 Hz) instead of 0 Hz if the sampling frequency was 200 Hz. Achieving an anti-aliasing filter with 0 Hz transition band is unrealistic whereas an anti-aliasing filter with a transition band of 300 Hz is not difficult.

==Reconstruction==
The term oversampling is also used to denote a process used in the reconstruction phase of digital-to-analog conversion, in which an intermediate high sampling rate is used between the digital input and the analog output. Here, digital interpolation is used to add additional samples between recorded samples, thereby converting the data to a higher sample rate, a form of upsampling. When the resulting higher-rate samples are converted to analog, a less complex and less expensive analog reconstruction filter is required. Essentially, this is a way to shift some of the complexity of reconstruction from analog to the digital domain. Oversampling in the ADC can achieve some of the same benefits as using a higher sample rate at the DAC.

<doc id="1339657" wikidata="Q8980613" url="?curid=1339657" title="Martin Grainger">
<text>Martin Grainger (born 23 August 1972) is an English former professional footballer who played as a defender. He made 380 appearances and scored 44 goals in the Football League and Premier League. He was an attacking left back who could also play further up the field or even as a winger and was a dead ball specialist.

==Playing career==
An experienced player, his career started in 1989 at Colchester United, where he made 37 league starts between July 1992 and October 1993, before moving on to Brentford on 21 October for a fee of £60,000. He was a first-team regular throughout his time at the club, making 100 league starts and scoring 12 goals. He joined Birmingham City on 25 March 1996, and quickly became an inspirational player due to his continued consistency and ability from set-pieces.

He picked up the Player of the Season award for 1999–2000, and played for Birmingham in the 2001 Football League Cup Final loss to Liverpool, missing one of the spot kicks in the shootout. As Birmingham continued to improve in the First Division, and eventually earned promotion into the Premiership, Grainger&#x27;s playing time became limited. He failed to appear for Birmingham due to injury during the first half of the 2003–04 season, and in February he was loaned to Coventry City, for whom he made seven league appearances. On 18 March 2004, he was recalled to Birmingham&#x27;s team due to an injury crisis, and got on the scoresheet in a 2–1 defeat to Manchester United, but was himself injured and failed to appear in any matches for the rest of the season.

Grainger retired from football on 1 January 2005, having spent 13 years as a player. His goal-scoring appearance against Manchester United, on 10 April 2004, proved to be his final professional fixture. In the years following his retirement, Grainger has continued to be a popular figure amongst supporters of Birmingham City.

==Managerial career==
In January 2008, Grainger was appointed manager of Southern League Premier Division club Cheshunt, but left the post after less than a week. In their only game during his tenure, Cheshunt lost 4–0 to Hemel Hempstead Town.

==Personal life==
Martin met Nicola at the age of seventeen. They married in Forty Hill, Enfield in 1995. Martin and Nicola have two Sons, Charlie and Sonnie.

His son Charlie also became a professional footballer, playing as a goalkeeper. He joined Leyton Orient in 2009, turned professional in 2014, and has represented England at under-18 level.

<doc id="1339695" wikidata="Q12062159" url="?curid=1339695" title="Johnny Mullagh">
<text>Johnny Mullagh (born Unaarrimin; 13 August 1841 – 14 August 1891) was an Australian cricketer from Victoria who was the leading player on the famous 1868 Aboriginal cricket tour of England. He was a skilful all-rounder, being a right-arm bowler and right-handed batsman. In December 2020, Mullagh was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame.

== Background ==
He was born Unaarrimin, a member of the Jardwadjali people, on Mullagh Station, about sixteen kilometres north of Harrow, Victoria. He was given the name &quot;Mullagh&quot; to identify him with his place of birth. He learned to play cricket at the Edgars&#x27; Pine Hills agricultural property in Harrow.

== Cricketing career ==
Mullagh played 47 matches on the 1868 England tour, when none of the matches were first-class, scoring 1698 runs at an average of around 20, on pitches that were often treacherous. He also bowled 1877 overs, 831 of which were maidens, and took 245 wickets at 10 apiece. If that wasn&#x27;t enough, he would occasionally don wicket-keeping gloves, achieving four stumpings.

There was general discrimination against Indigenous peoples in Nineteenth-century Australia. Many of those chosen to tour England faced obscure futures and early deaths once the venture had concluded. One player, &quot;King Cole&quot;, died on the trip and, of those who returned, seven spent time on a reserve, two vanished, and the fate of two others is not clear from the surviving records.

Historian D. J. Mulvaney said of Mullagh, &quot;Few contemporary cricketers better merited the title of all-rounder&quot;. Mullagh&#x27;s performances were impressive enough for him to join the Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC) as a professional for part of the 1869–70 season. His appointment was terminated shortly afterwards, reportedly because of a severe illness when he was on the verge of inter-colonial selection.

In 1870, Mullagh first played in a match for the Western District, appearing for Apsley against Harrow, but for the rest of his career he played mostly for Harrow. He liked to play an unorthodox shot similar to the 21st-century ramp shot: &quot;Dropping on one knee to a fast rising ball, he would hold his bat over his shoulder and parallel to the ground. The ball would touch the blade, and shoot high over the wicket-keeper&#x27;s head to the boundary.&quot;

Mullagh was both an independent person and a passionate advocate of Indigenous rights, refusing to dwell on state-controlled reserves. His political stance was revealed during a game at Apsley, when, as the players went to lunch, a white participant asked, &quot;What about the nigger?&quot; The captain replied, &quot;Let him have his dinner in the kitchen&quot;. Mullagh refused to eat in the kitchen, and sat outside the hotel in protest.

Mullagh never appeared in an inter-colonial cricket match, although he did represent Victoria against a touring England side in 1879, top scoring with 36 in the second innings. He was then 38 years old and, instead of going in first-wicket-down as he did for his club, batted at nine and 10.

Maintaining his independence and dignity to the end, Mullagh spent his last days living in a rabbitter&#x27;s shack. He continued to play cricket until a few months before his death at Pine Hills Station in 1891, one day after his 50th birthday. The &quot;Hamilton Spectator&quot; described him in his obituary as &quot;the [W.G.] Grace of aboriginal cricketers&quot;, while another writer referred to Mullagh as &quot;Victoria&#x27;s premier batsman&quot;.

== Legacy ==
A memorial has been built in Harrow to honour Mullagh, and the local sports ground is Johnny Mullagh Oval. A local indigenous tournament has been created, and the teams vie for the Johnny Mullagh Memorial Trophy.

In February 2012, the Premier of Victoria, Ted Baillieu, and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Jeanette Powell, announced that Mullagh would be one of the 20 inaugural inductees to the Victorian Indigenous Honour Roll.

In December 2019, Cricket Australia revealed plans for the Johnny Mullagh Medal, to be awarded to the best player in the Boxing Day Test match from 2020. On 29 December 2020, Indian cricketer Ajinkya Rahane became the first recipient of the award. Following this, on 28 December 2021, another Aboriginal Australian, Scott Boland, received the award after taking 7 wickets on his test debut.

<text>A malar rash (), also called butterfly rash, is a medical sign consisting of a characteristic form of facial rash. It is often seen in lupus erythematosus. More rarely, it is also seen in other diseases, such as pellagra, dermatomyositis, and Bloom syndrome.

Many conditions can cause rashes with a similar appearance to a malar rash. A malar rash is present in approximately 46–65% of people with lupus.

== Definition ==
A malar rash of lupus is red or purplish and mildly scaly. It has the characteristic shape of a butterfly, and involves the bridge of the nose. Notably, the rash spares the nasolabial folds of the face, which contributes to its characteristic appearance. It is usually macular with sharp edges, and not itchy. The rash can be transient or progressive with involvement of other parts of the facial skin.

While some literature has described the slapped-cheek rash of fifth disease as a malar rash, it differs slightly in that the nose is typically spared.

== Differential diagnosis ==
Conditions that can cause rashes with a similar appearance to a malar rash include:

* lupus erythematosus
* pellagra
* dermatomyositis
* Bloom syndrome
* Rosacea, a long-term skin condition characterized by a red rash, usually on the face.

Lupus causes up to 96% of all cases of malar rash. Where lupus is suspected, further medical tests and a detailed history and examination are necessary to differentiate it from other conditions. These tests may include a test for the presence of anti-nuclear antibody in the blood as a screening test, which is not specific for lupus erythematosus.

== Epidemiology ==
A malar rash is present in approximately 46–65% of people with lupus, with an average of 57% of lupus patients having it across all populations. This percentage varies between different populations.

== History ==
A malar rash is often known more colloquially as a butterfly rash due to its distinctive appearance.

<doc id="1339705" wikidata="Q6320884" url="?curid=1339705" title="The Curse of Fenric">
<text>The Curse of Fenric is the third serial of the 26th season of the British science-fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was first broadcast in four weekly parts on BBC1 from 25 October to 15 November 1989.

In it, the ancient evil force Fenric uses the vampiric Haemovores, descendants of humanity from the future, to attack a World War II naval base in England and orders them to destroy life on Earth by poisoning it with chemicals.

Two further versions of this story exist: the 1991 video release incorporated about six minutes of extra material into the original narrative, and the 2003 DVD included a &#x27;Special Edition&#x27; edited into a single movie-length feature, with new special effects, re-editing of some scenes, and 12 minutes of unbroadcast footage. In 2023, an additional special edition was released as part of &quot;Tales of the TARDIS.&quot;

==Plot==

The Seventh Doctor and Ace arrive at a British naval installation near Maiden&#x27;s Point on the Northumberland coast during World War II. The base contains a supply of nerve gas and the Ultima supercomputer used by Dr. Judson to decode German messages as well as Viking runes in the catacombs. The runes warn of Fenric, whom the Doctor recognizes as a force of pure evil from the dawn of time. The Doctor and Ace find a covert Russian squad attempting to steal Ultima. As Ace becomes smitten with their leader Captain Sorin, the Doctor warns them to lay low.

Exploring the catacombs, the Doctor and Ace find a glowing Oriental vase among the Viking treasures, which is confiscated by the base commander Millington and given to Judson to study. As Judson places it within Ultima, he is struck by and taken over by the spirit of Fenric. Fenric calls out to the Ancient One, a Haemovore in the nearby sea, who&#x27;s army of Haemovores are in the progress of attacking the base and local residents, turning them into Haemovores. Ace warns Kathleen, a WRNS, to escape with her newborn infant, Audrey.

The Doctor sets up a chess problem, hoping to distract Fenric long enough to find a permanent solution to stop him. Fenric instructs the Ancient One to carry a deadly poison away to be released after killing the other Haemovers with a mental command. Sorin arrives and tries to kill Fenric but learns he is one of his &quot;wolves&quot;, individuals manipulated by his powers, descendants of the Vikings that brought the Oriental vase here. Ace arrives, sees Sorin studying the chessboard, and offers the solution. The Doctor arrives too late as Sorin reveals himself as Fenric, commanding the Ancient One to attack the Doctor. A psychic barrier created by Ace&#x27;s trust in the Doctor stops the him. Fenric tells Ace she is one of his wolves, having created the time storm that took her to Iceworld to meet the Doctor as he used a similar event to bring the Ancient One, and she furthered her own cycle by making sure Audrey, her mother, was safe. Fenric threatens to kill Ace unless The Doctor kneels before him, but The Doctor urges Fenric to kill her exclaiming that he knew of her being one of the wolves from the beginning, as the only reason he let her travel with him.

Ace&#x27;s faith in the Doctor is shattered but, instead of attacking them, the Ancient One seizes Fenric and chases him into the gas chamber releasing the deadly poison. The Doctor and Ace flee the base before it explodes, killing Fenric and the Ancient One and ending the threat. Ace takes a moment to contemplate why she hates her mother and to celebrate overcoming her irrational fear of the water, before she and the Doctor depart.

===Continuity===
The Doctor chants the names of his former companions to ward off the Haemovores. Most of the names he chants are inaudible, but a few can be made out, including Susan, Barbara, Vicki, and Steven, companions of the First Doctor. Ace mentions an old house in Perivale. This was originally intended as a foreshadowing of &quot;Ghost Light&quot;; the resequencing of the broadcast schedule, however, altered it into an apparent reference to a past story. Similarly, the Doctor&#x27;s new wardrobe for season 26 was hidden throughout part one by a long duffel coat, setting up a dramatic revelation when he removed the coat. Sylvester McCoy, however, has stated that he was given the coat to shelter from the cold weather on location, and was permitted to retain it on-screen.

==Production==

===Pre-production===
Writer Ian Briggs based Dr Judson on Alan Turing. In an interview for the DVD release of this story, Briggs said that since at that time it was not considered appropriate to depict a character&#x27;s struggle with homosexuality in a family programme, he transformed Turing&#x27;s frustration at being unable to express his true sexual identity into Judson&#x27;s frustration at being disabled. In the same interview, Briggs stated that he intended to suggest that both Judson and Millington were gay and had a shared past, although this was not realised in the finished programme.

This story was originally going to be titled &quot;The Wolves of Fenric&quot; (and before that, &quot;Wolf-Time&quot;). Fenric does refer to his servants as his &quot;wolves&quot; (and wolves play a strong role in Norse mythology, especially the monster Fenrir). However, Nathan-Turner felt that as the &quot;wolves&quot; connection was not revealed until quite late in the story, the title would not initially make sense to the audience.

Although there are several references in the story to the Norse belief in a final battle at the end of the world, the word Ragnarok was removed from the script to avoid confusion with the Gods of Ragnarok from the previous season&#x27;s &quot;The Greatest Show in the Galaxy&quot;.

This story is the second in what some have called the &quot;Ace Trilogy&quot;, a three-story arc that explores elements of Ace&#x27;s past before she met the Doctor. This was not an intentional trilogy, since &quot;Fenric&quot; was originally intended to start the season. &quot;Fenric&quot; was moved to third in the season because its horror themes were seen as more fitting for airing in October.

===Production===
&quot;The Curse of Fenric&quot; was originally to have been shot, as with most &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serials, as a mixture of studio interiors and location exteriors. However, after reading the script, director Nicholas Mallett persuaded producer John Nathan-Turner that given the settings involved, the serial could be made more effective and realistic by shooting the entire production on location. Shooting went over-length to such a degree that consideration was briefly given to editing the story into five rather than four episodes. However, Ian Briggs strongly opposed this, feeling that the narrative flow would be badly disrupted.

The setting of the story is disputed as either Northumberland or near Whitby, North Yorkshire, although Reverend Wainwright&#x27;s mention of Dracula coming ashore there indicates the latter. The scenes set in the fictional location of Maiden&#x27;s Point were shot on location at Lulworth Cove in Dorset. The production also visited Kent and filmed at Lillesden Manor which doubled as the laboratory under the church, Roses Farm in Hawkhurst, which doubled as Mrs Hardaker&#x27;s Cottage, and St Lawrence Church in Hawkhurst which doubled as St Judd&#x27;s Church.

===Cast notes===
* Marek Anton, who played the Destroyer in the first story of the season &quot;Battlefield&quot;, is the Russian soldier Vershinin.
* The infant Audrey was the son of the proprietors of the Bush Hotel on Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Green, familiar to the production team as it was near the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; offices.
* This serial features guest appearances from Dinsdale Landen as Dr Judson and Nicholas Parsons as Reverend Wainwright. See also list of guest appearances in Doctor Who.
* Two of the Haemovores in this story are played by Sylvester McCoy&#x27;s sons: Sam and Joe Kent-Smith.

* Anne Reid returned to &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as a Plasmavore named Florence Finnegan in the Tenth Doctor episode &quot;Smith and Jones&quot;.
* Actress Janet Henfrey was a schoolfriend of Sophie Aldred&#x27;s mother. Her character of Miss Hardaker was modelled on the part she played, again as a school teacher, in two Dennis Potter dramas: &quot;Stand Up, Nigel Barton&quot; (1965) and &quot;The Singing Detective&quot; (1986). Henfrey returned to the series as Mrs. Pitt in the Twelfth Doctor episode &quot;Mummy on the Orient Express&quot;.
* Sylvia Syms was originally offered the part of Miss Hardaker but played the character Mrs Pritchard in &quot;Ghost Light&quot;.

==Broadcast and reception==
Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping described the serial as &quot;something special&quot; with &quot;many magical scenes&quot; in &quot;The Discontinuity Guide&quot; (1995). In &quot;The Television Companion&quot; (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker praised the direction and horror. In 2012, Mark Braxton of &quot;Radio Times&quot; awarded it four stars out of five. He wrote that there was &quot;much to enjoy and admire&quot; and suggested it as an influence on the revived &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in terms of companions. However, he felt that it was &quot;as if three scripts have been rewritten as one&quot;, considering the plot was too convoluted and observing that the special effects were &quot;a mixed bag&quot;. Christopher Bahn, reviewing the serial for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, also commented on its influence on the modern series, but felt it hadn&#x27;t &quot;aged well visually&quot; and &quot;often looks cheap and feels cheesy, but the way it takes chances and stretches the boundaries of what &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was about is admirable, even if that might have been too-little-too-late for a show that would be off the air in two months.&quot; He also believed it &quot;starts strongly and has some terrific moments, but gets convoluted and confusing toward the finale.&quot; He criticised the &quot;less-than-graceful dialogue&quot; and special effects, and felt that Fenric and the Haemavores lacked sufficient background.

==Commercial releases==

===In print===

Ian Briggs novelisation was published by Target Books in November 1990. The novel features additional character information and an epilogue featuring an older Ace after she has left the Doctor. This formed part of the basis for Ace&#x27;s departure in Kate Orman&#x27;s Virgin New Adventures novel &quot;Set Piece&quot;, where she chooses to stay in Paris to monitor a time rift and at some point has a relationship with one of Captain Sorin&#x27;s ancestors.

===Home media===
&quot;The Curse of Fenric&quot; was released on VHS in 1991. The release included six minutes of extra scenes. It was released on DVD in the United Kingdom in October 2003 in a two-disc set, part of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; 40th Anniversary Celebration releases with an additional DVD commentary by Sylvester McCoy, Sophie Aldred, and Nicholas Parsons, plus a &#x27;Special Edition&#x27; edited into one movie-length adventure including 12 minutes of unbroadcast material. This version has reworked special effects and music arranged by Mark Ayres based on notes by him and the late Nicholas Mallett; it also has several scenes re-edited to produce a more coherent narrative. It was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in issue 39 on 30 June 2010.

It was released on Blu-ray as part of the Time Lord Victorious box set.

The serial was released on blu-ray on 27 January 2020 as part of &quot;The Collection - Season 26&quot; box set. It features, not only the original TV broadcast episodes of The Curse of Fenric, but also the extended VHS release episodes as well as a special feature-length extended edition.

===&quot;Tales of the TARDIS&quot;===
A special edition of the episode aired on BBC iPlayer on 1 November 2023, in the spin-off &quot;Tales of the TARDIS&quot;.

<doc id="1339706" wikidata="Q470252" url="?curid=1339706" title="Arlene Francis">
<text>Arlene Francis (born Arline Francis Kazanjian; October 20, 1907 – May 31, 2001) was an American game show panelist, actress, radio and television talk show host. She is best known for her long-running role as a panelist on the television game show &quot; What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, on which she regularly appeared for 25 years, from 1950 to 1975, on both the network and syndicated versions of the show.

== Early life ==
Francis was born on October 20, 1907, in Boston, Massachusetts, the daughter of Leah (née Davis) and Aram Kazanjian. Her Armenian father was studying art in Paris at the age of 16 when he learned that both his parents had died in one of the massacres perpetrated by the Ottoman government in Turkey between 1894 and 1896, known as the Hamidian Massacres. He emigrated to the United States and became a portrait photographer, opening his own studio in Boston in the early 20th century. Later in life, Kazanjian painted canvases of dogwoods, &quot;rabbits in flight&quot;, and other nature scenes, selling them at auction in New York.

When Francis was seven years old, her father decided that opportunities were greater in New York and moved the family to a flat in Washington Heights, Manhattan. She remained a New York resident until she entered a San Francisco nursing home in 1993.

== Career ==

After attending Finch College, Francis began a varied career as an entertainer based in New York City. She became an accomplished stage actress, performing in many local theatre and off-Broadway plays and in 25 Broadway plays through 1975. In 1932, she made her film debut in Universal&#x27;s &quot;Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot;. She appeared in films sporadically until the 1970s.

Francis became a well-known New York City radio personality, hosting several programs. In 1938 she became the female host of the radio game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Name?&quot;. Although several men appeared as co-hosts over the years, Francis was the sole female host throughout the program&#x27;s long run (on ABC, NBC, and Mutual networks) until it ended in 1949.

In 1940, Francis played Betty in &quot;Betty and Bob&quot;, an early radio soap opera broadcast.

In 1943, she began as host of a network radio game show, &quot;Blind Date&quot;, which she hosted also on ABC and NBC television from 1949 to 1952. From 1952 to 1961 she was a regular substitute for Dave Garroway on the Today Show. She was a regular contributor to NBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Monitor&quot; in the 1950s and 1960s and hosted a long-running midday chat show on WOR-AM that ran from 1960 to 1984.

Francis was a panelist on the weekly game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; from its second episode on CBS in 1950 until its network cancellation in 1967, and in its daily syndicated version from 1968 to 1975.

The original show, which featured guests whose occupation, or &quot;line,&quot; the panelists were to guess, became one of the classic television game shows, noted for the urbanity of its host and panelists.

She appeared on other game shows, including &quot;Match Game&quot;, &quot;Password&quot;, &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, and other programs produced by Mark Goodson and Bill Todman, including a short-lived hosting stint on the Goodson-Todman show &quot;By Popular Demand&quot;, replacing original host Robert Alda.

According to &quot;TV Guide&quot;, Francis was the highest-earning game show panelist in the 1950s, making $1,000 () per show on the prime time version of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;. By contrast, the second-highest-paid panelists on TV, Dorothy Kilgallen and Faye Emerson, received $500 () per appearance.

Francis was the emcee on the last episodes of &quot;The Comeback Story&quot;, a short-lived 1954 reality show on ABC in which mostly celebrities shared stories of having overcome adversity in their personal lives.

Francis was a pioneer for women on television, one of the first to host a program that was not musical or dramatic in nature. From 1954 to 1957, she was host and editor-in-chief of &quot;Home,&quot; NBC&#x27;s hour-long daytime magazine program oriented toward women, which was conceived by network president Pat Weaver to complement the network&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;Tonight&quot; programs. In 1954, she appeared on the cover of &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine. She hosted &quot;Talent Patrol&quot; in the mid-1950s. In 1962, Francis was one of numerous people recruited to guest host &quot;Tonight&quot; during an interval period before Johnny Carson took over as host from Jack Paar. This made her the first woman to host not only &quot;Tonight&quot; but a national late-night U.S. network talk show.

She acted in a few Hollywood films, debuting in the role of a streetwalker who falls prey to mad scientist Bela Lugosi in &quot;Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot; (1932). In her memoir, Francis said she was cast for the movie even though her only acting experience at the time was in a small Shakespearean production in a convent school she had attended. Some sixteen years later, she appeared in the film version of Arthur Miller&#x27;s play &quot;All My Sons&quot; (1948) with Edward G. Robinson.

In the 1960s, Francis made three films: &quot;One, Two, Three&quot; (1961), directed by Billy Wilder and filmed in Munich, in which she played James Cagney&#x27;s wife; &quot;The Thrill of It All&quot; (1963) with Doris Day and James Garner; and, in 1968, the television version of the play &quot;Laura&quot;, which she had played on stage several times. Her final film performance was in Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Fedora&quot; (1978).

In 1978, Francis wrote her autobiography, &quot;Arlene Francis: A Memoir&quot;, with longtime friend Florence Rome. In 1960, she wrote &quot;That Certain Something: The Magic of Charm&quot;, and she published a cookbook, &quot;No Time for Cooking&quot;, in 1961. She was a member of the Peabody Awards Board of Jurors from 1980 to 1982. Francis also guested on television programs including &quot;Mrs. G. Goes to College&quot; in 1962 in the episode &quot;The Mother Affair&quot;.

Francis made sporadic television appearances throughout the 1980s, with her final appearances being during Mark Goodson&#x27;s birthday party and on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; with Robin Quivers and Kitty Carlisle, in 1991.

== Personal life ==
Francis was married twice. Her first marriage, from 1935 to 1945, was to Neil Agnew, an executive with Paramount Pictures; they divorced in 1945.

She wrote of this experience in her 1978 autobiography: As she disclosed in her autobiography, she admitted she never should have married Neil Agnew because she was not in love with him. During the marriage, she met producer and actor Martin Gabel and fell in love with him. He encouraged her to divorce Agnew, which was one of the sources of her torment because her parents loved Agnew like a son. After Francis divorced him to marry Gabel, they initially did not like Gabel for several reasons, including her divorce.

Francis&#x27;s marriage to Gabel lasted from 1946 until his death in 1986. Gabel was a frequent guest panelist on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;. The couple, who often exchanged endearments on the show, had a son, Peter Gabel, born January 28, 1947, a legal scholar associated with New College of California in San Francisco. Peter Gabel was an associate editor of &quot;Tikkun&quot;, a Jewish-community commentary magazine. While working as a tour guide at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, Peter surprised his mother as a contestant on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;.

Francis and her husband settled a lawsuit for $185,000 in June 1962 that had been filed by the widow of a Detroit man who was killed when a dumbbell fell from the Gabel family&#x27;s eighth-floor Ritz Tower apartment and struck him on the head while he was visiting New York to celebrate his birthday. Francis, Gabel, and their son Peter were vacationing in Connecticut when the 1960 incident happened. Francis had instructed their maid to shampoo the carpet while they were away. The maid kept windows open for a long time to minimize the smell of the shampoo. The dumbbell was part of the equipment that Francis used for her regular exercise of weightlifting.

On May 26, 1963, Francis was involved in a serious car accident while driving alone from a theater on Long Island to the Manhattan studio where she was expected for a live telecast of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;. The force from a car that struck her car caused her to skid on the wet surface of the Northern State Parkway, jump the highway&#x27;s concrete divider, and collide with a car containing five passengers, one of whom was killed. Francis suffered a broken collarbone, a concussion and many cuts and bruises.

Francis was known for wearing a heart-shaped diamond pendant, a gift from Gabel, which she wore on nearly all of her &quot;What&#x27;s My Line&quot; appearances. A mugger robbed her of the pendant as she was leaving a New York City taxi in 1988.

== Death ==
Francis died at the age of 93 on May 31, 2001, in San Francisco, California, from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and cancer. She is interred in Roosevelt Memorial Park in Trevose, Pennsylvania.

<doc id="1339715" wikidata="Q1775181" url="?curid=1339715" title="Mark Feehily">
<text>Markus Michael Patrick Feehily (born 28 May 1980) is an Irish singer, best known as a member of the pop vocal group Westlife. Westlife has released twelve albums, embarked on thirteen world tours and won several awards, becoming one of the most successful musical groups of all time. With 15 number one appearances, Feehily is also the highest-charting LGBT performer on the UK Singles Chart.

== Career ==

=== 1998–2012: &quot;Six as One&quot;, &quot;IOYou&quot;, &quot;Westlife&quot; ===

Feehily rose to fame in the boy band Westlife. Before Westlife, Feehily, Shane Filan and Kian Egan were members of the self-formed, six-piece, Sligo-based boy band IOYOU, previously named Six As One, which released the single &quot;Together Girl Forever&quot; and songs &quot;Everlasting Love&quot; and &quot;Good Thing&quot;. Louis Walsh, the manager of Boyzone, was contacted by Filan&#x27;s mother and learned of the group. The final line-up, established on 3 July 1998, consisted of Feehily, Filan and Egan from the original line-up, and Nicky Byrne and Bryan McFadden, new members who auditioned from Dublin. Boyzone singer Ronan Keating was brought in to co-manage the group with Walsh, assuming an advisory role.

Feehily has also co-written several songs, including some with his band members. Feehily has spoken to &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; of his embarrassment about Westlife&#x27;s Rat Pack-tribute album, &quot;...Allow Us to Be Frank&quot;; he blamed Westlife&#x27;s label for forcing them to record it after Robbie Williams had success with this type of music. He dismissed the instance as a &quot;weird time&quot; in Westlife&#x27;s career. Despite this, he has referred to his role in Westlife as &quot;the best job in the world&quot;.

=== 2015–2018: Solo career ===
As well as releasing music as part of Westlife, Feehily has also released music as a solo artist, under the name &quot;Markus Feehily&quot; rather than &quot;Mark Feehily&quot;, which he was known as in Westlife. In February 2015, Feehily launched his solo career with a radio premiere of his debut single &quot;Love Is a Drug&quot; on RTÉ 2fm in Ireland. The next day the track premiered online, via &quot;Wonderland Magazine&quot;. Moments after the premiere of the song, it was made available for pre-order on iTunes, with the official video for the track launching on his Vevo channel two weeks later. The song was released on 19 April 2015.

He released his debut solo studio album &quot;Fire&quot; on 16 October 2015. It includes the singles &quot;Love Is a Drug&quot; and &quot;Butterfly&quot;.
He was a support act for Wet Wet Wet and Mariah Carey. He was also invited by Russell Crowe at Olympia Theatre, Dublin, 1 October 2017, for his &quot;Dublin Indoor Garden Party gig&quot; to sing &quot;Love Was My Alibi&quot;, written by Crowe and Carl Falk for the film &quot;The Water Diviner&quot;, which Crowe both directed and starred in, accompanied by Alan Doyle and Falk. His second album &quot;Christmas&quot;, featuring the track &quot;River&quot;, a rendition of the song by Joni Mitchell, was released on 1 December 2017.

=== 2018–present: Westlife reunion with new music, concert tour and &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; ===
In October 2018, a video was posted to Westlife&#x27;s official social media platforms announcing the group&#x27;s reunion as a four-piece. In 2019 the group headlined &quot;The 20 Tour&quot;, named in honour of Westlife&#x27;s 20th anniversary since its formation and the release of its first single, &quot;Swear It Again&quot;, in 1999. In addition to touring, Westlife also released new music. &quot;Hello My Love&quot;, the first single from the group&#x27;s upcoming album, debuted on the &quot;Graham Norton Show&quot; on 10 and 11 January 2019. In 2022, Feehily appeared on the third series of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Robobunny&quot;. He reached the final and finished in third place. 

He was in a one night concert version of the musical &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; as Neville Craven. The production was at the London Palladium on 28 August 2022. He starred opposite acclaimed West End actor Hadley Fraser as his brother Archibald Craven.

== Songwriting ==
Feehily has co-written several Westlife songs, all fifteen tracks of his debut solo album and numerous unreleased songs.

He announced on social media that he and Shane Filan co-wrote the new single for Emeli Sandé and Ronan Keating called &quot;One of a Kind&quot; released in 2020.

== Personal life ==
Feehily was born in Sligo, County Sligo in Ireland. His parents are Marie (née Verdon) and Oliver Feehily, and he has two younger brothers as well as many cousins. He has expressed his love for Sligo&#x27;s picturesque and artistic environment, which he credits for playing a critical role in inspiring his musical aspirations and pursuits. As a child, singing and playing the tin whistle were important elements in his life. His favourite singer has always been Mariah Carey, with whom Westlife collaborated on &quot;Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)&quot;. In his teenage years, he also enjoyed playing tennis and football.

In August 2005, he publicly revealed he was gay during an interview with the British tabloid &quot;The Sun&quot;. Feehily had recognised his sexual orientation when he was 14 or 15 years old. His family, bandmates and close friends knew his sexual orientation. Westlife&#x27;s manager Louis Walsh, however, was unaware of Feehily&#x27;s sexual orientation when he began managing the group. As the only gay member of Westlife, Feehily had kept his sexual orientation private. Unlike his bandmates, Feehily did not discuss his private life in interviews, although he had dated women prior to his coming out. In yet another interview, he told &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; that despite the fact that the majority of Westlife&#x27;s fans are female, there had really been no negative reaction.

During the interview with &quot;The Sun&quot;, Feehily also announced his romantic relationship with British fashion photographer Kevin McDaid, a member of the now-defunct British boy band V. The pair, who lived together, had been dating since January 2005 after having met at a Cheerios Childline Concert in Ireland. Feehily said that while he did not intend to get married right away, he was happy to know he could form a civil partnership in Britain with the recent passing of the Civil Partnership Act. In December 2007, Feehily and Kevin appeared on the cover of &quot;Attitude&quot;. The couple became engaged in February 2010. On 31 December 2011, Feehily announced via his Twitter account that the couple had split up.

Feehily is interested in charity works and supports the charity group &quot;Aware&quot;. He was shortlisted in 2011 as one of the top 50 most influential gay individuals. He congratulated his local football club Sligo Rovers on its victory in the 2011 FAI Cup Final.

On 22 February 2019, he announced his engagement to Cailean O&#x27;Neill through his Instagram account, during their holiday on Hurawalhi in the Maldives. On 3 October, Feehily and O&#x27;Neill announced the birth of their daughter Layla via surrogacy.

<text>Pierre &quot;Pig&#x27;s Eye&quot; Parrant was the first official resident of the city of Saint Paul, Minnesota. His exploits propelled him to local fame and infamy, with his name briefly adorning the village that became Minnesota&#x27;s capital city.

== History ==
Sources disagree about Parrant&#x27;s exact history before settling in the Minnesota Territory, but most indicate that he was of French Canadian origin (or perhaps Métis) and born near Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, around 1777. For most of his adult life Parrant made his living as a fur trapper while working for a company called McKenzie and Chouteau. During his days as a fur trapper &quot;Pig&#x27;s Eye&quot; Parrant, so called because he was blind in one eye, started to gain a somewhat dubious reputation with law enforcement, most likely due to his dabbling as a bootlegger. With the onset of age and the fur trade&#x27;s decline Parrant began seeking new endeavors to earn a living. His search brought him to a fledgling new settlement near a military outpost called Fort Snelling in the Minnesota Territory.

== Pierre Parrant in Minnesota ==

Arriving at Mendota in 1832, Parrant began to carve out a new life for himself while residing in a squatter&#x27;s colony near Fort Snelling. His new career found him distilling liquor, which he sold to other squatters, the indigenous people of the area, and even the soldiers at the fort. This new business served &quot;Pig&#x27;s Eye&quot; (French: &quot;L&#x27;Œil de Cochon&quot;) until 1838, when the squatters were forced off the land surrounding the fort due to their strain on surrounding resources. It was at this time that the 60+-year-old Parrant made a claim on a tract of land at the entrance of what was known as Fountain Cave. This cave was situated on the east bank of the Mississippi River just downstream from what is now Downtown Saint Paul. Then, around June 1, 1838, Parrant completed a small shack that, according to an 1892 publication by Albert A. Jones, became &quot;the first habitation, and the first business house of Saint Paul.&quot; Thus Parrant became the first inhabitant of the future city of Saint Paul. That such a distinction belongs to a man with Parrant&#x27;s reputation has irked some historians, such as J. Fletcher Williams, who lamented:
&quot;Such was the man on whom Fortune, with that blind fatuity that seems to characterize the jade, thrust the honor of being the founder of our good city! Our pride almost revolts at the chronicling of such a humiliation, and leads us to wish that it were on one worthier and nobler that such a distinction had fallen. But history is inexorable, and we must record &quot;facts&quot; as they are.&quot;
Fountain Cave was an excellent location for Parrant&#x27;s claim, as the spring inside it provided a steady water supply for his still. It was at Fountain Cave that Parrant opened a tavern that became wildly popular with the surrounding community. The bar, known as &quot;Pig&#x27;s Eye&quot; or &quot;Pig&#x27;s Eye Pandemonium&quot;, was easily accessible to local residents, riverboat crews working on the river, and the soldiers from nearby Fort Snelling. Parrant had become so popular, in fact, that when a nearby resident named Joseph R. Brown sent a letter to a friend in 1839 he gave the return address simply as &quot;Pig&#x27;s Eye&quot;. Not long after, Brown received correspondence at the address he had given, showing that the growing community around Pierre&#x27;s bar was becoming known as &quot;Pig&#x27;s Eye&quot;. The city&#x27;s name might have remained Pig&#x27;s Eye had it not been for the arrival of a Catholic priest named Lucien Galtier. So aghast was Galtier that the village on the river derived its name from a man of such ill repute that, when he built his small chapel in the area in 1841, he reportedly stated, &quot;Pig&#x27;s Eye, converted thou shalt be, like Saul; Arise, and be, henceforth, Saint Paul!&quot; It is disputed whether Galtier actually said those words, but the story is part of the city&#x27;s folklore.

In 1844, Parrant lost his claim at Fountain Cave and was forced to vacate the land. It is not clear why. Some sources indicate that he was involved in a border dispute with a neighbor; others say he was forced to sell his claim because of mounting debts.

== Life after Saint Paul ==
What happened to Parrant after he left Saint Paul is a mystery. Some sources say he was so upset about losing his claim that he decided to leave the Minnesota area and return to Sault Ste. Marie, only to die along the way in 1844. Others say he eventually settled near Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, where he died between 1872 and 1886. The latter account is unlikely since it would mean he lived to at least 95, which was extremely rare at that time.

<text>Barry Altschul (born January 6, 1943, in New York City) is a free jazz and hard bop drummer who first came to notice in the late 1960s for performing with pianists Paul Bley and Chick Corea.

==Biography==
Altschul is of Russian Jewish heritage, the son of a laborer who did construction work and drove a taxi. Having initially taught himself to play drums, Altschul studied with Charlie Persip during the 1960s. In the latter part of the decade, he performed with Paul Bley. In 1969 he joined with Chick Corea, Dave Holland and Anthony Braxton to form the group Circle. At the time, he made use of a high-pitched Gretsch kit with add-on drums and percussion instruments.

In the 1970s, Altschul worked extensively with Anthony Braxton&#x27;s quartet featuring Kenny Wheeler, Dave Holland, and George E. Lewis. Braxton, signed to Arista Records, was able to secure a large enough budget to tour with a collection of dozens of percussion instruments, strings and winds. In addition to his participation in ensembles featuring avant-garde musicians, Altschul performed with Lee Konitz, Art Pepper and other &quot;straight ahead&quot; jazz performers.

Altschul also made albums as a leader, but after the mid-1980s he was rarely seen in concert or on record, spending much of his time in Europe. Since the 2000s, he has become more visible, with five co-leader appearances with the FAB trio (with Billy Bang and Joe Fonda), the Jon Irabagon Trio recording &quot;Foxy&quot; and the bassist Adam Lane. Altschul has played or recorded with many musicians, including Roswell Rudd, Dave Liebman, Barre Phillips, Denis Levaillant, Andrew Hill, Sonny Criss, Hampton Hawes, and Lee Konitz. In 2012, Altschul began performing and recording with his new trio, the 3dom Factor, featuring saxophonist Jon Irabagon and double bassist Joe Fonda. 2019 saw the first release by the OGJB Quartet, a collective group featuring saxophonist Oliver Lake, cornetist Graham Haynes, Joe Fonda, and Altschul.

<text>Peter Benjamin Borwein (born St. Andrews, Scotland, May 10, 1953 – 23 August 2020) was a Canadian mathematician 
and a professor at Simon Fraser University. He is known as a co-author of the paper which presented the Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe algorithm (discovered by Simon Plouffe) for computing π.

==First interest in mathematics==

Borwein was born into a Jewish family. He became interested in number theory and classical analysis during his second year of university. He had not previously been interested in math, although his father was the head of the University of Western Ontario&#x27;s mathematics department and his mother is associate dean of medicine there. Borwein and his two siblings majored in mathematics.

==Academic career==

After completing a Bachelor of Science in Honours Math at the University of Western Ontario in 1974, he went on to complete an MSc and Ph.D. at the University of British Columbia. He joined the Department of Mathematics at Dalhousie University. While he was there, he, his brother Jonathan Borwein and David H. Bailey of NASA wrote the 1989 paper that outlined and popularized a proof for computing one billion digits of π. The authors won the 1993 Chauvenet Prize and Merten M. Hasse Prize for this paper.

In 1993, he moved to Simon Fraser University, joining his brother Jonathan in establishing the Centre for Experimental and Constructive Mathematics (CECM) where he developed the Inverse Symbolic Calculator.

== Research ==

In 1995, the Borweins collaborated with Yasumasa Kanada of the University of Tokyo to compute π to more than four billion digits.

Borwein has developed an algorithm that applies Chebyshev polynomials to the Dirichlet eta function to produce a very rapidly convergent series suitable for high precision numerical calculations, which he published on the occasion of the awarding of an honorary doctorate to his brother, Jonathan.

Peter Borwein also collaborated with NASA&#x27;s David Bailey and the Université du Québec&#x27;s Simon Plouffe to calculate the individual hexadecimal digits of π. This provided a way for mathematicians to determine the &quot;n&quot;th digit of π without calculating preceding digits. In 2007 with Tamás Erdélyi, Ronald Ferguson, and Richard Lockhart he settled Littlewood&#x27;s Problem 22.

== Affiliations ==

A former professor at Simon Fraser University, Peter Borwein was affiliated with Interdisciplinary Research in the Mathematical and Computational Sciences (IRMACS), Centre for Experimental and Constructive Mathematics (CECM), Mathematics of Information Technology and Complex Systems (MITACS), and Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences (PIMS).

==Personal life and death==
Borwein was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis prior to 2000. He died on 23 August 2020 of pneumonia as a result of his MS.

==Publications==
As a co-author, Borwein has written &quot;Pi: A Source Book&quot; (with Lennart Berggren
and Jonathan Borwein,
2000), &quot;Polynomials and Polynomial Inequalities&quot; (with Tamas Erdelyi, 1998), &quot;Pi and the AGM&quot; (1987; reprinted in 1998), &quot;A Dictionary of Real Numbers&quot; (with Jonathan Borwein), 
&quot;Computational Excursions in Analysis and Number Theory&quot; (2002), &quot;The Riemann Hypothesis: A Resource for the Afficionado and Virtuoso Alike&quot; (with Stephen Choi, Brendan Rooney, and Andrea Weirathmueller, 2007). He and his brother, Jonathan, co-edited the Canadian Mathematical Society/Springer-Verlag series of &quot;Books in Mathematics&quot;. In 2002 Peter Borwein, with Loki Jorgenson, won a Lester R. Ford Award for their expository article &quot;Visible Structures in Number Theory&quot;.

<doc id="1339745" wikidata="Q2975567" url="?curid=1339745" title="Last Exit to Springfield">
<text>&quot;Last Exit to Springfield&quot; is the seventeenth episode of the fourth season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It originally aired on Fox in the United States on March 11, 1993. The plot revolves around Homer Simpson becoming president of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant&#x27;s trade union and leading the workers of the plant in a strike in order to restore their dental plan to avoid the family having to pay out-of-pocket for Lisa&#x27;s new braces.

The episode was written by Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky (their final writing credit for &quot;The Simpsons&quot;), and directed by Mark Kirkland. The episode contains several cultural references and Dr. Joyce Brothers guest stars as herself. Since airing, &quot;Last Exit to Springfield&quot; has frequently been cited as one of the best episodes of the entire series.

==Plot==
While awaiting the arrival of his employees&#x27; union president (who has not been seen since he promised to clean up corruption in the organization) to discuss the latest contract, Mr. Burns reminisces of simpler times back in 1909, when his grandfather would deal with workers&#x27; complaints by walling them away in abandoned coke ovens. Burns decides to challenge the union&#x27;s demands by revoking their dental plan.

Lisa has a dentist appointment. Her dentist, Dr. Wolfe, informs the Simpson family that Lisa needs braces. Marge is worried, but Homer tells her that the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant&#x27;s dental plan, which the workers won during a strike in 1988, will cover the cost. At a meeting of the International Brotherhood of Jazz Dancers, Pastry Chefs, and Nuclear Technicians union, Carl announces that the newest contract requires the workers to give up their dental plan in exchange for a free keg of beer at union meetings. Homer gradually realizes that giving up the dental plan would require him to pay for Lisa&#x27;s braces and jumps into action, reminding everyone how the dental plan has helped them. After encouragement from Carl, Homer is promptly elected the new union president.

Burns invites Homer to his office with the intent of bribing him, but Homer assumes Burns&#x27;s sly innuendos are sexual advances. Homer declares that he is not interested in &quot;backdoor shenanigans&quot; and promptly leaves, leading Burns to erroneously infer that Homer is honest and incorruptible. Meanwhile, after learning the Simpsons have no dental insurance, Dr. Wolfe fits Lisa with the cheapest (and ugliest) braces available, causing her self-esteem to plummet.

Homer is kidnapped from his house by &quot;hired goons&quot; and taken to Burns&#x27;s mansion. Burns gives Homer a tour of the mansion to get him in a good mood, but when the tour ends and the two men sit down to negotiate the contract, Homer suddenly needs to use the bathroom. Homer&#x27;s delayed attempts to find the restroom leads Burns to inaccurately assume that Homer is a tough negotiator. At the next union meeting, Homer declares he is tired of meeting with Burns and attempts to resign. The union misinterprets his frustration, and the members decide to strike. Burns attempts to break up the strike through several methods, but all of them fail.

After weeks of failed attempts to break up the strike, Burns deliberately causes a power outage throughout Springfield to break the union&#x27;s spirit. However, the strikers do not lose hope and begin to sing a protest song written by Lisa. Burns meets with Homer and agrees to meet the union&#x27;s demands if Homer resigns as union president. Homer loudly celebrates both of Burns&#x27;s propositions. Burns remarks, &quot;Smithers, I&#x27;m beginning to think that Homer Simpson is not the brilliant tactician I thought he was.&quot; With the Simpson family insured again, Lisa gets invisible, painless new braces.

==Production==

The idea for this episode came from Mike Reiss, who thought it would be funny if the plant went on strike. The writers of the episode, Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky, would later add the dental plan aspect of the plot. During the production of this episode, an ABC camera crew was allowed into the rewrite room, which Al Jean says he regrets because they were working on stage direction, and they came off as not being very funny.

The producers originally asked Anthony Hopkins and Clint Eastwood to provide the voice of the dentist, Dr. Wolfe, but both declined the part. Anthony Perkins was eventually cast in the role, but died before his recording session. In the end, the role went to &quot;Simpsons&quot; regular Hank Azaria. The original choice for the guest panellist on &quot;Smartline&quot; (prior to the casting of Dr. Joyce Brothers) was O. J. Simpson, who turned the role down, much to the relief of the writers when Simpson was later tried for murder.

==Cultural references==

The title of the episode is an homage to Hubert Selby Jr.&#x27;s novel &quot;Last Exit to Brooklyn&quot;, one subplot of which involves the corruption and downfall of a union leader during a strike. The body of the union president, Chuckie Fitzhugh, is seen buried under a football field, an homage to the mystery surrounding the whereabouts of Jimmy Hoffa and his alleged burial at New Jersey&#x27;s Giants Stadium. Mr. Burns&#x27; outfit in the flashback to his childhood is based on Buster Brown. Homer&#x27;s fantasy of a life of organized crime is based on Don Fanucci&#x27;s first appearance in &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;, accepting donuts rather than a necklace and an orange.

Lisa&#x27;s nitrous oxide-induced hallucination echoes The Beatles film &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;, which Al Jean says had to be changed slightly for legal reasons. In the script, the name was changed to &quot;purple submersible&quot;, and letters spelling &quot;HATRED&quot; can be seen in the background; a contrast to the message of love popular in the 60s. Paul McCartney says &quot;Look fellas, it&#x27;s Lisa in the Sky!&quot;, and George Harrison notes &quot;no diamonds though&quot;, a reference to the Beatles song &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot;. Ringo Starr says &quot;Look out for the campy drawing of Queen Victoria!&quot; The scene where Lisa sees a reflection of her monstrous braces, laughs maniacally and breaks the mirror is based on the scene from Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; (1989) where Jack Napier discovers his transformation into the Joker.

When Homer is escorted by the hired goons into Burns&#x27; conservatory, a Burns-headed bird is sitting in the foreground. This is a reference to the shrieking cockatoo in &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;. The page Mr. Burns reads from the monkey&#x27;s typewriter (&quot;It was the best of times, it was the BLURST of times!&quot;) is a reference to the first line of &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;. After playing her protest song, Lenny says &quot;Now do &#x27;Classical Gas&#x27;!&quot;, which she plays. Mr. Burns and Smithers going through multiple doors to get to the main power switch is a parody of the opening credits of &quot;Get Smart&quot;; the bit with the book case and twin fire poles is a reference to the original &quot;Batman&quot; TV series. In the latter scene, the score references Danny Elfman&#x27;s theme from the Burton &quot;Batman&quot;. Before Mr. Burns shuts off the town&#x27;s power in response to the strike, he says, &quot;From Hell&#x27;s heart I stab at thee&quot;, a reference to Captain Ahab&#x27;s curse in &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, one of Wolodarsky&#x27;s favorite books. The workers&#x27; resistance to the power outage, and Mr. Burns&#x27;s response, is a parody of Chuck Jones&#x27;s &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas!&quot;. When Homer succeeds in getting the dental plan reinstated, he celebrates by spinning around on the floor and yelling “woo-woo-woo” à la Curly Howard of The Three Stooges.

The episode features a running gag, Mr. Burns&#x27;s inability to remember Homer. He asks Smithers, &quot;Who is that young firebrand?&quot; Smithers says, &quot;Ah, that&#x27;s Homer Simpson, sir.&quot; Burns replies, &quot;Simpson, eh? New man?&quot; Smithers says &quot;He thwarted your campaign for governor, you ran over his son, he saved the plant from meltdown, and his wife painted you in the nude...&quot; Burns says, &quot;Eh... doesn&#x27;t ring a bell.&quot;

==Reception==
In its original broadcast, &quot;Last Exit to Springfield&quot; finished 19th in ratings for the week of March 8–14, 1993, with a Nielsen rating of 13.7, equivalent to approximately 12.8 million viewing households. It was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week.

The episode is generally ranked as being one of the best of all time and is on a number of Top 10 lists; the BBC stated it is &quot;frequently cited as the show&#x27;s best-ever episode&quot;. An &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; article from January 2003 looking back at the top 25 episodes of the series named the episode as the show&#x27;s greatest, calling it &quot;virtually flawless, the product of a series at the height of its creative powers -- when the satire was savage and relevant&quot; with &quot;the stuff of syndication legend: Burns facing down &#x27;brilliant&#x27; labor kingpin Homer Simpson; Homer Simpson facing down his own brain (&quot;DENTAL PLAN!/Lisa needs braces!&quot;); Grampa rattling on about wearing onions on his belt. &quot;Last Exit&quot; is a glorious symphony of the high and the low, of satirical shots at unions and sweet ruminations on the humiliations of adolescence (as evidenced by Lisa, who copes with a medieval mouth contraption).&quot; In 2020, Al Jean acknowledged &quot;Last Exit to Springfield&quot; as an episode many consider a favorite.

In his book &quot;Planet Simpson&quot; Chris Turner names it the best episode of the series, saying &quot;Episode 9F15 of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; should be taught in schools, in history, economics, social studies, literature &quot;and&quot; art class. It&#x27;s flawless&quot;. He also called it &quot;the funniest half-hour in TV history&quot;, and provided a full analysis of the episode, only criticizing the chalkboard and couch gags. He maintains that he chose the episode as best ever before &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s list was published.

In 2003, to celebrate the show&#x27;s 300th episode, &quot;USA Today&quot; published a top 10 chosen by the webmaster of The Simpsons Archive, which had this episode in first place. The BBC website says, &quot;This fine episode contains several of our favourite sequences ... A classic, and the series&#x27; most marked expedition into the - up to this point.&quot; &quot;Today&quot;, who listed the episode as their favorite, stated, &quot;This is the episode that every self-respecting &quot;Simpsons&quot; geek must be able to recite verbatim.&quot;

Michael Moran of &quot;The Times&quot; ranked the episode as the sixth-best in the show&#x27;s history. Screen Rant called it the best episode of the fourth season and the second greatest episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (behind &quot;Homer&#x27;s Enemy&quot;).

Director Mark Kirkland considers the episode to be one of the most surreal episodes that he has worked on because it has a lot of story crammed into it, many parodies and several fantasy sequences, such as Homer&#x27;s &quot;Godfather Part II&quot;-inspired meditation on organized crime. Al Jean has also called it one of the &quot;craziest&quot; episodes. Homer&#x27;s line &quot;Uh...&quot;yeah&quot;.&quot; (with the animation and line delivery implying Homer is lying) after being asked if he found the bathroom is one of Jay Kogen&#x27;s favorite &quot;Simpsons&quot; jokes.

In &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Nathan Rabin writes that &quot;&#x27;Last Exit To Springfield&#x27; is a popular candidate for the single greatest episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, the greatest television show of all time... What makes this episode so special? What makes it the very best of the best? The answer, I think, comes down to joy. For an episode centering on emotionally charged, high-stakes labor negotiations and the horror of cut-rate dental care, &#x27;Last Exit To Springfield&#x27; positively radiates an unlikely but pervasive sense of joy...Much of this joy is musical in nature. &#x27;Last Exit To Springfield&#x27; is filled with both music and sequences blessed with a real sense of musicality&quot;, citing Lisa&#x27;s &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;-esque hallucination and Burns&#x27;s dream of running the plant without workers. He also notes the episode&#x27;s social commentary: &quot;Underneath the richly merited jabs at labor’s propensity for corruption lies a real respect for labor’s capacity for good. In its own exquisitely cynical way, &#x27;Last Exit To Springfield&#x27; offers a surprisingly nuanced depiction of the strengths and weaknesses of organized labor.&quot;

In 2024, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Last Exit to Springfield&quot; as the second greatest episode of television of all time.

==Legacy==
The episode has become study material for sociology courses at the University of California, Berkeley, where it is used to &quot;examine issues of the production and reception of cultural objects, in this case, a cartoon show&quot;, and to figure out what it is &quot;trying to tell audiences about aspects primarily of American society, and, to a lesser extent, about other societies.&quot;
