<text>Sophiatown , also known as Sof&#x27;town or Kofifi, is a suburb of Johannesburg, South Africa. Sophiatown was a poor multi-racial area and a black cultural hub that was destroyed under apartheid. It produced some of South Africa&#x27;s most famous writers, musicians, politicians and artists, like Father Huddleston, Can Themba, Bloke Modisane, Es&#x27;kia Mphahlele, Arthur Maimane, Todd Matshikiza, Nat Nakasa, Casey Motsisi, Dugmore Boetie, and Lewis Nkosi. 

Rebuilt as a whites-only area under the name of Triomf (&quot;Triumph&quot;) in the 1960s, in 2006 it was officially returned to its original name. Sophiatown was one of the oldest black areas in Johannesburg and its destruction represented some of the excesses of South Africa under apartheid.

==History==

Sophiatown was originally part of the Waterfall farm. Over time it included the neighbouring areas of Martindale and Newclare. It was purchased by a speculator, Hermann Tobiansky, in 1897. He acquired 237 acres four miles or so west of the centre of Johannesburg. The private leasehold township was surveyed in 1903 and divided into almost 1700 small stands. The township was named after Tobiansky&#x27;s wife, Sophia, and some of the streets were named after his children Toby, Gerty, Bertha and Victoria. Before the enactment of the Natives Land Act, 1913, black South Africans also had freehold rights in the area, and bought properties in the suburb. The distance from the city centre was seen as disadvantageous, and after the City of Johannesburg built a sewage plant nearby, the area seemed even less attractive. Most of the wealthy people had moved out by 1920. By the late 1940s Sophiatown had a population of nearly 54,000 Africans, 3,000 Coloureds, 1,500 Indians and 686 Chinese, both owners and renters. As the land never belonged to the Johannesburg municipality, it was never developed through municipal housing schemes, which in black areas usually involved row upon row of &quot;matchbox&quot; houses, based on uniformity and lack of character.[13] 

===Forced removals===
It was adjacent to white working-class areas, such as Westdene and Newlands, and known for high levels of crime and poverty. The seregationist state viewed it as a slum, and believed that it was too close to white areas. From 1944, i.e., even before apartheid, the Johannesburg City Council planned to move the non-white population out of the Western Areas of Johannesburg, including Sophiatown. After the election victory of the National Party in 1948, relocation plans were debated at the level of national politics. Under the Group Areas Act and the Immorality Amendment Act, both of 1950, as well as the Natives Resettlement Act of 1954, the national state was empowered to stop people of different races residing together. This allowed systematic urban segregation and the destruction of mixed areas .

When the Sophiatown removals scheme was promulgated, Sophiatown residents united to protest against the forced removals, creating the slogan &quot;Ons dak nie, ons phola hier&quot; (roughly, &quot;we won&#x27;t move&quot;). Figures like Nelson Mandela were key to the resistance. Some whites, like Father Trevor Huddleston, Helen Joseph and Ruth First also played an important role. On 9 February 1955, 2,000 policemen, armed with handguns, rifles, and clubs known as knobkierries, forcefully moved the first batch of black families from Sophiatown to Meadowlands, Soweto. In the years that followed, other blacks were removed, and the Coloured evicted to Eldorado Park outside of Johannesburg, in addition to Westbury, Noorgesig and other coloured townships; the Indians were moved to Lenasia; and the Chinese moved to central Johannesburg. Over eight years Sophiatown was flattened and removed from the maps of Johannesburg.

===Triomf===
After the forced removals and demolition, the area was rebuilt as renamed &quot;Triomf&quot; —Afrikaans for &quot;Triumph&quot;—by the government. The social engineers of apartheid tried to create a suburb for the white working-class, and Triomf was predominantly populated by poorer working-class Afrikaners. Marlene van Niekerk&#x27;s award-winning novel &quot;Triomf&quot; focuses on the daily lives of a family of poor whites in this era. 

===Restoration of the name Sophiatown===
The Johannesburg City Council took the decision in 1997 to reinstate the old name Sophiatown for the suburb. On 11 February 2006, the process finally came to fruition when Mayor Amos Masondo changed the name of Triomf back to Sophiatown. Today, Sophiatown again has a racially mixed population.

==Geography and geology==

Sophiatown is located on one of Johannesburg&#x27;s ridges called Melville Koppies. Melville Koppies lies on the Kaapvaal craton, which dates from three billion years ago. The Koppies lie at the base of lithified sediments in the form of conglomerate, quartzite, shale, and siltstone. It represents the first sea shores and shallow beds of an ancient sea. It also forms part of the lowest level of one of the world&#x27;s most well known geological features, the Witwatersrand Supergroup. Several fairly narrow layers of gravel, deposited quite late in the sequence, and bearing heavy elements, made the Witwatersrand Supergroup famous. These are the gold-bearing conglomerates of the main reefs. Melville Koppies represents in microcosm most of the features of the Witwatersrand Supergroup. What it does not have is gold-bearing rock. The gold occurs millions of years later, and several kilometres higher up, in the sequence. In the last 1,000 years, black Iron Age immigrants arrived and remains of their kraal walls can be found in the area.

The Melville Koppies Nature Reserve is a Johannesburg City Heritage Site. 

==Culture==

===Early life in Sophiatown===
Sophiatown, unlike other townships in South Africa, was a freehold township, which meant that it was one of the rare places in South African urban areas where blacks were allowed to own land. This was land that never belonged to the Johannesburg municipality, and so it never developed through municipal housing schemes. The houses were built according to people&#x27;s ability to pay, tastes, and cultural background. Some houses were built of brick and had four or more rooms; some were much smaller. Others were built like homes in the rural areas; others still were single room shacks put together with corrugated iron and scrap sheet metal. The majority of the families living in Sophiatown were tenants and sub-tenants. Eight or nine people lived in a single room and the houses hid backyards full of shanties built of cardboard and flattened kerosene cans, since many Black property owners in Sophiatown were poor. In order to pay back the mortgages on their properties, they had to take in paying tenants.

Sophiatown residents had a determination to construct a respectable lifestyle in the shadow of a state that was actively hostile to such ambitions. A respectable lifestyle rested on the three pillars of religious devotion, reverence for formal education, and a desire for law and order.

People struggled to survive together starvation was a serious problem, and a rich culture based on shebeens (informal and mostly illegal pubs), mbaqanga music, and beer-brewing developed. The shebeens were one of the main forms of entertainment. People came to the shebeens not only for skokiaan or baberton (illegally self-made alcoholic beverages), but to talk about their daily worries, their political ideas and their fears and hopes. In these shebeens the politicians tried to influence others and get them to conform to their form of thinking. If one disagreed he immediately became suspect and was classified as a police informer.

These two conflicting images of Sophiatown stand side by side – the romantic vision of a unique community juxtaposed with a seedy and violent township with dangers lurking at every corner.

=== Arts and literature ===
The cultural process was somehow intensified in Sophiatown, as in Soho, the Greenwich Village, the Quartier Latin or Kreuzberg. It was akin to what Harlem was to New York in the 1920s Harlem Renaissance and is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Sophiatown renaissance&quot;.

The musical &quot;King Kong&quot;, sponsored by the Union of South African Artists, is described as the ultimate achievement and final flowering of Sophiatown multi-racial cultural exploits in the 1950s. &quot;King Kong&quot; is based on the life of Sophiatown legend Ezekiel Dlamini, who gained popularity as a famous boxer, notorious extrovert, a bum, and a brawler. The &quot;King Kong&quot; musical depicted the street life, the illicit shebeens, the violence, and something approximating the music of the township: jazz, penny whistles and the work songs of the black miners. When &quot;King Kong&quot; premiered in Johannesburg, Miriam Makeba the vocalist of the Manhattan Brothers, played in the female lead role. The musical later went to London&#x27;s West End for two years.

One of the boys, Hugh Masekela at St Peter&#x27;s School, told Father Huddleston of his discovery of the music of Louis Armstrong. Huddleston found a trumpet for him and as the interest in making music caught on among the other boys, the Huddleston Jazz Band was formed. Masekela did not stay very long in Sophiatown. He was in the orchestra of &quot;King Kong&quot; and then made his own international reputation.

Images of Sophiatown were initially built up in literature by a generation of South African writers: Can Themba, Bloke Modisane, Es&#x27;kia Mphahlele, Arthur Maimane, Todd Matshikiza, Nat Nakasa, Casey Motsisi, Dugmore Boetie, and Lewis Nkosi who all lived in Sophiatown at various stages during the 1950s. They all shared certain elements of a common experience: education at St Peter&#x27;s School and Fort Hare University, living in Sophiatown, working for &quot;Drum&quot; magazine, exile, banning under the Suppression of Communism Act and for many the writing of an autobiography.

Later, images of Sophiatown could be found in Nadine Gordimer&#x27;s novels, Miriam Makeba&#x27;s ghostwritten autobiography and Trevor Huddleston&#x27;s &quot;Naught for your comfort&quot;. Alan Paton also details the social, cultural and political trajectory of Sophiatown in his 1983 novel, &quot;Ah, but Your Land Is Beautiful&quot;.

Marlene van Niekerk&#x27;s novel &quot;Triomf&quot; focuses on the suburb Triomf and recounts the daily lives of a family of poor white Afrikaners. The book has been turned into a movie called &quot;Triomf&quot;, which won the Best South African Movie award in 2008.

=== Crime and gangsterism ===
Crime and violence were a reality of urban life and culture in Sophiatown. The poverty, misery, violence and lawlessness of the city led to the growth of many gangs. Sections of society frowned on gangsterism as anti-social behaviour and gangsters like Kortboy and Don Mattera were despised by many as &quot;anti social&quot;, but were also sometimes perceived as “social bandits” that were part of the resistance to apartheid.

After the Second World War, there was a large increase in the number of gangs in Sophiatown. Part of the reason for this was that there were about 20,000 African teenagers in the city who were not at school and did not have jobs. Township youths were unable to find jobs easily. Employers were reluctant to employ teenagers as they did not have any work experience, and many of them were not able to read or write. They also considered them to be undisciplined and weak.

In Johannesburg in the 1950s, crime was a day-to-day reality, and Sophiatown was the nucleus of all reef crimes. Gangsters were city-bred and spoke a mixture of Afrikaans and English, known as tsotsitaal. Some of the more well-known gangs in Sophiatown were the Russians, the Americans, the Gestapo, the Berliners and the Vultures. The names the Gestapo and the Berliners reflect their admiration for Hitler, whom they saw as some kind of hero, for taking on the whites of Europe. The best known gang from this period, and also best studied, was the Russians. They were a group of Basotho migrant workers who banded together in the absence of any effective law enforcement by either mine owners or the state. The primary goal of this gang was to protect members from the tsotsis and from other gangs of migrant workers, and to acquire and defend resources they found desirable - most notably women, jobs and the urban space necessary for the parties and staged fights that formed the bulk of their weekend entertainment.

One of the more successful community campaigns emerged in the early 1950s when informal policing initiatives known as the Civic Guards were mobilized to combat rising crime. This attempt to restore law and order attracted widespread support prior to a series of bloody clashes with the migrant criminal society from the poorer enclave of Newclare. This provided the state with an excuse to ban the Guard groups which they eyed with suspicion because of their ANC and Communist Party connections. These supposed arbiters of law and order engaged in a series of brutal street battles with members of the &quot;Russians&quot; gang in the early 1950s.

The representation of gangsters in the literature (&quot;Drum&quot; magazine) went through very different stages during the 1950s and early 1960s. The first representation is characterized by consistent condemnations of crime as an urban phenomenon that threatens the rural identity of tribal blacks. The second is almost a complete turn-around from the first, as gangsters are portrayed as urban survivors who are able to achieve a standard of living normally denied to blacks. The final period is an extended period of nostalgia for the shebeen culture that all but disappeared with the destruction of Sophiatown.

==Landmarks==

===The Church of Christ the King ===
One of the few tangible reminders of the old Sophiatown is the Anglican Church of Christ the King in Ray Street. The architect was Frank Flemming, who designed 85 churches throughout South Africa. The church was constructed in 1933. The bell tower was added in 1936. So little money was made available for the construction that the architect called it a &quot;Holy Barn&quot;. The church&#x27;s distinctive feature was a mural that is no longer visible. It was painted between 1939 and 1941 by Sister Margaret. The church was an icon of the liberation struggle in South Africa. In 1940 Trevor Huddleston was appointed Rector. He was an outspoken opponent of apartheid. In 1955 during the forced removals, Huddleston was recalled to England. His ashes reside next to his former church. On the north-eastern side of the church there is a mural depicting Huddleston walking the dusty streets of Sophiatown. This mural was painted by 12 apprentice students under patronage of the Gerard Sekoto Foundation. It shows two children tugging at his cassock as well as Sekoto&#x27;s famous yellow houses. The entire Sophiatown community was removed by the end of 1963; the church was deconsecrated in 1964 and sold to the Department of Community Development in 1967. In the 1970s it was bought by the Nederduitsch Hervormde Kerk, which used it for Sunday School. The church changed hands again and the Pinkster Protestantse Kerk bought the building and altered it significantly. The nave was enclosed, a large font was built and wooden panelling and false organ pipes changed the look of the interior. In 1997 the Anglicans bought the church back and it was reconsecrated; the changes were reversed and the building was largely restored to its former self. However, the hall and gallery the Pinkster Protestantse Kerk had built were retained. 
=== Dr A. B. Xuma&#x27;s house ===

Dr A. B. Xuma was a medical doctor who had trained in the United States and the United Kingdom. He was a local celebrity, President of the African National Congress and Chairperson of the Western Areas Anti-Expropriation and Proper Housing Committee. His house was a landmark in Sophiatown (73 Toby Street) and was declared a National Heritage Monument on 11 February 2006. Currently, the house is the location of the Sophiatown Heritage and Cultural Centre. This is one of two houses to escape the destruction of Sophiatown by the government in the late 1950s. It was built in 1935 and named Empilweni. Xuma and his second wife Madie Hall Xuma lived there until 1959. The writer, actor and journalist Bloke Modisane reminisces that among all those modest, run-down buildings, could stand the palatial home of Dr A. B. Xuma with its two garages. Modisane remembers how he and his widowed mother, who ran a shebeen, had looked to Xuma and his house for a model of the good life, i.e. separate bedrooms, a room for sitting, another for eating, and a room to be alone, for reading or thinking, to shut out South Africa and not be black.

===Good Street ===

Good Street was significant in the life of Sophiatown. It was described as a &quot;Street of Shebeens&quot;. The writer Can Themba&#x27;s house, called the House of Truth, was on Good Street, as well as Fatty Phyllis Peterson&#x27;s 39 Steps. To get to the 39 Steps, one had to walk up a flight of steps, which looked by all accounts very dingy. One was then met by Fatty, who sold about every type of drink: whisky, brandy, gin, beer, wine, etc. Sometimes she even supplied cigars. Good Street was also renowned for its Indian, Chinese and Jewish shops, and for being a street of criminals and gangsters.

===St Joseph&#x27;s Home for Children ===
The Home opened its doors in 1923. It was built as a diocesan memorial to the Coloured men who paid the ultimate sacrifice for their country. It was run by the Anglican nuns, the Order of St Margaret, East Grinstead, who remained in charge until 1978, when they left South Africa in protest against apartheid. The Main Block, Boys&#x27; House and Priests&#x27; House were designed by the diocesan architect F. L. H. Flemming. The Church successfully opposed removal of the Home because the property was on farm land and not part of a proclaimed township.

===The Odin Cinema ===
There were two cinemas in Sophiatown. The larger was the Odin, which at the time was also the largest in Africa and could seat 1,200 people. The other cinema, Balansky&#x27;s, was a lower-class, rougher movie-house, while the Odin Cinema was more up-market. The Odin was the pride of Sophiatown. It was owned by a white couple, the Egnoses, who were known as Mr and Mrs Odin. Not only did they provide much loved entertainment, but also made the Odin available for political meetings, parties and stage performances. Some international acts played to multi-racial audiences at the Odin. It was also the site of a series of &quot;Jazz at the Odin&quot; jam sessions featuring white and black musicians. Also at a meeting at the Odin, the ultimately unsuccessful resistance to the destruction of Sophiatown began to coalesce.

===Freedom Square ===
Freedom Square was located on the corner of Victoria and Morris Streets. It was famous in the 1950s for the political meetings held there. It was utilised by the African National Congress (ANC) and the Transvaal Congress Party. Many of the meetings were chaired by Trevor Huddleston. Freedom Square facilitated the cooperation between the aforementioned political parties. Here parties worked together against the apartheid regime. Freedom Square in Sophiatown should not be confused with Freedom Square in Kliptown, Soweto, where the Freedom Charter was adopted by the ANC in 1955. It was in this Freedom Square in Sophiatown that Nelson Mandela made his first public allusion to violence and armed resistance as a legitimate tool for change. This earned him a reprimand from Albert Luthuli who by then replaced Dr A.B. Xuma as president of the ANC. Current remnants of Freedom Square may be found beneath a school playing field alongside the Christ the King Church.

===St Cyprian&#x27;s Missions School ===
This primary school was the site of religious and educational significance in Sophiatown. It was an Anglican Mission school located in Meyer Street and was established in 1928. St Cyprian&#x27;s was the largest primary school in Sophiatown. Oliver Tambo and Trevor Huddleston taught here, as both were passionate about education. It was also the St Cyprian&#x27;s School boys who a dug out the pool behind the house of the Community of the Resurrection in order to have a swimming pool. The school boys of St Cyprian&#x27;s later went to Father Ross or Father Raynes or Father Huddleston who tried to get them bursaries to go to St Peter&#x27;s School, then Fort Hare University and later even the University of the Witwatersrand. The idea was that they should come back as doctors.

===Oak tree in Bertha Street===
The tree gained a sinister reputation as the &quot;Hanging Tree&quot; when two people hanged themselves from its branches, both due to being subjected to the forced removals. The tree was designated as of the first Champion Tree of South Africa. Champion trees are trees in South Africa that are of exceptional importance, and deserve national protection.

<text>Thomas J. Bowers (c. 1823–October 3, 1885), also known as &quot;The Colored Mario&quot;, was an American concert artist. He studied voice with African-American concert artist Elizabeth Taylor Greenfield and toured with her troupe for a few years before embarking on his own successful solo career. He was the brother of professional singer Sarah Sedgwick Bowers, known as &quot;the Colored Nightingale&quot;, and John C. Bowers, a Philadelphia entrepreneur and church organist.

A fictionalized version of Thomas Bowers&#x27;s life was depicted by actor William Marshall in a 1964 episode of &quot;Bonanza&quot; titled &quot;Enter Thomas Bowers&quot;.

==Early life==
Thomas Bowers was born in 1836 in Philadelphia. His father, John C. Bowers Sr. (1773–1844), was a secondhand clothing dealer, a vestryman and school trustee at St. Thomas African Episcopal Church, and one of the founders of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society. His mother&#x27;s name was Henrietta. As a youngster, Thomas showed a desire to learn music and was taught piano and organ by his older brother John. At the age of 18, he succeeded his brother as organist of St. Thomas African Episcopal Church. He and his brother were trained as tailors and operated a &quot;fashionable merchant tailor shop&quot; catering to upper class gentlemen and businessmen in Philadelphia.

==Concert artist==
Despite his natural aptitude for music and enjoyment of singing, Bowers deferred to his parents&#x27; wishes not to perform outside the church. He declined offers to sing with the famous Frank Johnson&#x27;s Band of Philadelphia, among others. But as more people became acquainted with his singing, he was persuaded to appear at a Philadelphia recital in 1854 with African American concert artist Elizabeth Taylor Greenfield, and became her student in voice. That 1854 appearance met with popular and critical success; the critics began calling him &quot;The Colored Mario&quot; and &quot;The American Mario&quot; for the similarity of his voice to Italian opera tenor Giovanni Mario. Bowers personally disliked the sobriquet, but agreed to be billed as &quot;Mareo&quot;. He proceeded to tour with Greenfield&#x27;s troupe in Philadelphia, the Midwestern United States, New York, and Canada, and afterwards embarked on a successful solo career.

Bowers specialised in &quot;romantic ballads and popular arias from well-known operas&quot;. His voice was described as having a &quot;wonderful power and beauty&quot; and &quot;extraordinary power, mellowness, and sweetness&quot;. His range was nearly two octaves. He was said to be &quot;handsome&quot; and had a strong stage presence.

Bowers found the stage an ideal platform from which to espouse his opposition to racial inequality. He was purportedly reluctant to launch a public singing career until he realised: &quot;What induced me more than any thing else to appear in public was to give the lie to &#x27;negro serenaders&#x27; (minstrels), and to show to the world that coloured men and women could sing classical music as well as the members of the other race by whom they had been so terribly vilified&quot;. He became famous for refusing to perform before segregated or white-only audiences. For an 1855 performance in Hamilton, Ontario, where the theatre manager refused to seat six black patrons who had purchased reserved first-class seats, Bowers refused to perform.

Trotter writes: &quot;Mr. Bowers, during his career, has sung in most of the Eastern and Middle States; and at one time he even invaded the slavery-cursed regions of Maryland. He sang in Baltimore, the papers of which city were forced to accord to him high merit as a vocalist.&quot;

Bowers also appeared at benefit concerts to raise funds for the recruitment of black soldiers to the Union Army training camp at Camp William Penn.

==Other activities==
Together with other members of his family, Bowers was a national organiser of &quot;black opposition to the fugitive slave laws of the 1850s and a state representative of the Equal Rights Convention. In October 1864 he was a delegate from Philadelphia to the National Convention of Coloured Men in Syracuse, New York.

==Personal==
Bowers married Lucretia Turpin, a native of New York, sometime before 1850. They had one daughter, Adelia.

At the time of his death in 1885, he possessed &quot;nearly $10,000 in real estate, Pennsylvania Railroad stock, household furnishings and cash in the Farmers and Mechanics Bank&quot;.

==&quot;Bonanza&quot; episode==
In a 1964 episode of &quot;Bonanza&quot; titled &quot;Enter Thomas Bowers&quot;, Thomas was portrayed as the African American opera singer by actor William Marshall.

<text>The is a cabinet level ministry in the government of Japan responsible for oversight of the agriculture, forestry and fishing industries. Its acronym is MAFF. The current Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is Taku Etō.

==History==
The Constitution of the Empire of Japan provided for the creation of a , which was established in 1881, with Tani Tateki as its first minister. As an additional note, the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce was a division that served as the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.

In 1925, the commerce functions were separated out into a separate , and the ministry was renamed the . The ministry was also given responsibility for oversight of the Factory Act of 1903, which provided regulations for work hours and worker safety in both industrial and agricultural industries.

From 1943 to 1945, when the Ministry of Commerce was abolished due to the nationalization of Japanese industry for the war effort of World War II against Allies of World War II, parts of that ministry reverted to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, which was again briefly named .

In 1978, the name of Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry was expanded to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries to better reflect the ministry&#x27;s role in guaranteeing the Japanese public a safe food supply, and to protect producers and workers in the food production industries.

<text>Dana Whitney Vollmer (born November 13, 1987) is a former American competition swimmer, five-time Olympic gold medalist, and former world record-holder. At the 2004 Summer Olympics, she won a gold medal as a member of the winning United States team in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay that set the world record in the event. Eight years later at the 2012 Summer Olympics, Vollmer set the world record on her way to the gold medal in the 100-meter butterfly, and also won golds in the 4×100-meter medley relay and 4×200-meter freestyle relay.

<text>Hearts of Iron II is a 2005 grand strategy video game developed by Paradox Development Studio and published by Paradox Interactive for Microsoft Windows. A Mac OS X version was released the same year. It is the sequel to &quot;Hearts of Iron.&quot;

It takes place in the time period from 1 January 1936 (1933 with an expansion) through 30 December 1947 (1964 with an expansion), and allows the player to assume control of any one of over 175 nations of the time and guide its development through the years before, during and after the Second World War. It was developed by Paradox Interactive and released in 2005. The lead game programmer was Johan Andersson.

A sequel, &quot;Hearts of Iron III&quot;, was released in August 2009.

&quot;Arsenal of Democracy&quot;, a grand strategy wargame based on &quot;Hearts of Iron II&quot;, was released in February 2010. &quot;Iron Cross&quot;, a &quot;Hearts of Iron II&quot; expansion, was released on October 7, 2010, and &quot;Darkest Hour&quot;, a stand-alone strategy game based on &quot;Hearts of Iron II&quot;, was released on April 5, 2011.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Hearts of Iron II&quot; is a grand strategy game. The player can build land divisions, aircraft squadrons, and naval ships/fleets, and combine these into corps and armies. The player also has the ability to control the appointment of commanders of forces under their nation&#x27;s flag or that of controlled nations as well as to control the appointment of individual government ministers and military commanders in key General Staff positions. The player also has a broader ability to control the heads of state and government; however, this option is only available to democracies and only then through elections, in which the player chooses the winner. Technological research is controlled by the player. All this is on a global scale, with the player simultaneously dealing and interacting with nations across the world. The game can be paused at any point.

=== Playable nations ===
The player can choose to play almost any nation from the time period, apart from some very small states such as Andorra, Monaco, Vatican City or others (and mods exist that make even these playable). The player can also play as a new nation that gains its independence as the game progresses, but should wait until the nation actually declares independence in the game before it can be played. However, many smaller nations do not have strong tech teams, nor do they possess a strong industrial base.

=== Politics ===
The player is able to manage their nation&#x27;s foreign and internal policies on the Diplomacy page. The player can declare war, annex territories and make alliances. The player can also alter the social and economic policies of their nation using sliders, such as democratic versus authoritarian, free market versus central planning and so on. Moving the sliders will result in different bonuses and penalties, allowing for a range of choices and strategies.

On the same page, the player can appoint leaders and ministers, with some exceptions. The Head of State and Head of Government can only be changed through moving the political left vs. political right slider, or through elections and other one-time events.

=== Resource management ===
&quot;Hearts of Iron II&quot; features nine resources, of which six are conventional resources, and the other three are manpower, industrial capacity and transport capacity:

* Energy, rare materials (e.g. rubber), and metal are produced by individual provinces and pooled together to power the nation&#x27;s industry.
* Supplies are consumed by a player&#x27;s armed forces.
* Oil is consumed by mechanized or armored units, air units and naval units. (and some infantry with attached units)
* Money is raised through the production of consumer goods. The amount gained also varies based on government type and policy settings. Money is needed to carry out diplomatic actions, as well as pay research teams.
* Manpower is needed to recruit and reinforce all of a player&#x27;s armed forces. One unit of Manpower generally represents 1,000 men, as a normal infantry division of 10,000 men requires ten Manpower.
* Each factory in a nation contributes one point of industrial capacity (IC). The total number of factories is known as the Base IC. Several factors, such as difficulty, ministerial appointments, technologies, and resources available can modify this number, producing the actual IC. Each actual IC requires two points of energy, one of metal and half a point of rare materials in order to function.
* Transport capacity (TC) is an abstract number that represents the trucks, trains and river barges which are used to supply a player&#x27;s armed forces with fuel and supply. TC is a direct function of a player&#x27;s IC; the player has a TC that is 150% his IC. When the TC used exceeds the available amount, movement, supplies and reinforcements are delayed.

The six conventional resources can be traded with other countries, subject to potential disruption by enemy forces if the routes to the other country are occupied. Trade offers can be made to any other country, even ones with poor diplomatic relations, although allied nations are more willing to accept more favorable trade offers. Manpower, IC and TC are not tradeable.

== Scenarios ==
In the game, a player assumes direct control of a nation at the start of a scenario through 1948. The following scenarios are available:
* The Road to War, beginning on New Year&#x27;s Day, 1936;
* The Gathering Storm, beginning in September 1938, just before the Munich Agreement; added in the v1.2 patch.
* Blitzkrieg, beginning with Hitler&#x27;s declaration of war upon Poland (the invasion of Poland) on 1 September 1939;
* Awakening the Giant, beginning on 22 June 1941, at the beginning of Operation Barbarossa.
* Götterdämmerung, beginning on 20 June 1944, two weeks after the Western Allies landed at Normandy.

Added in &quot;Iron Cross&quot;:
* 1933, beginning on 30 January 1933, when Hitler takes power in Germany.
* 1934, beginning on 1 October 1934, at the start of the Asturian miners&#x27; strike of 1934.

Playable operations are:
* Fall Gelb, the German invasion of France in 1940.
* Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union in Summer of 1941.
* The Ardennes Offensive, centered around the Battle of the Bulge, on the Franco-Belgian-German frontier the winter of 1944, which was also playable in the game&#x27;s demo.
* Southern Conquests, revolving around the Japanese centrifugal offensive into the southern resource area in South-East Asia, following the attack on Pearl Harbor.
* Operation Watchtower, the battle for Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands.
* Fall Weiss, the German invasion of Poland
* Fall Grün, the planned German attack on Czechoslovakia
* Platinean War, a fantasy scenario where German-backed Argentina and American-backed Brazil clash in a conflict that would involve most of South America.
*Winter War, the Soviet-Finnish War of 1939–1940.
* Desert Fox, the African campaign that culminated in the Battle of El Alamein.
* Operation Husky, the Allied landings in Sicily and the subsequent Italian Campaign.
* Operation Overlord, the Allied landings in Normandy.
* Operation Downfall, the planned Allied invasion of the Japanese Home Islands.
* Spanish Civil War, the conflict between the Spanish republicans and nationalists in 1936–1939.
* Battle of the Coral Sea, the Japanese plan to capture Port Moresby on New Guinea by sea and the following carrier battle.
* Fall Blau, the German 1942 summer offensive against the Soviet Union, eventually culminating in the Battle of Stalingrad; added in the v1.2 patch.

== Warfare ==
&quot;Hearts of Iron II&quot; is a grand strategy game. The smallest independent land unit is the division, although brigades such as engineers, artillery, or armoured cars can be attached to these. On sea, units are either single capital ships or flotillas of small ships such as destroyers. For the air force, the unit is a Wing or Group, depending on nationality. Land divisions include infantry, cavalry, and tanks. Land brigades include anti-tank guns, anti-aircraft artillery and military police.

On the map the player can direct divisions or groups of divisions. Fighting starts when an army starts moving into a defended enemy territory. The invading units do not have to be inside enemy territory to attack. A province is immediately occupied when the invaders arrive there with no opposition left. Because of this, a player can blitz through large swaths of enemy lands with minimal micromanagement. In addition, units who move constantly lose organization and risk losing supply, so poorly executed attempts to blitzkrieg can be stopped. Provinces can be fortified and infrastructure increased to improve combat performance. Structures include radar, and static AA. Many fortifications are pre-built, such as the Maginot Line along the French-German border.

Air units include bombers, fighters and transports. These divisions can, depending on type, engage in tactical or strategic missions. Sea units include transports, aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, destroyers, and submarines. Each unit has a strength, speed, and effective engagement range. Naval combats simulate the range between fleets, allowing only units in range to fire. This can make naval combats tactically complex.

== Controversy and censorship ==
Like its predecessor &quot;Hearts of Iron&quot;, the game is banned in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The main point of contention seems to be that the game portrays the various Chinese warlords as independent entities, while according to the PRC government they were nominally part of the Republic of China governed by the Chinese Nationalist government, represented in-game as &#x27;Nationalist China&#x27;. Also, the Tibetan flag used in-game is banned in China. Paradox has stated that it will not reduce the level of historical accuracy in order to appease the PRC censors.
Anachronistically, Germany is represented with the flag of the German Empire as used by Germany until 1935, and not the Swastika flag, as was also done in the earlier board game &quot;Axis &amp; Allies&quot;. Laws in Germany prohibit the use of the swastika. Additionally, in the German version of the game, pictures of leading Nazi leaders, such as Hitler, Göring, and Himmler were removed and their names subsequently altered, though this is not required under German censorship laws, and is not the case in non-German versions of the game. The game can be easily modified by users to include such graphics, but Paradox disallows discussion of this particular type of modification on their message boards.

== Expansions ==
=== Doomsday ===
A stand-alone expansion pack to the game, &quot;Hearts of Iron II: Doomsday&quot;, was released on April 4, 2006. It contains everything that was in the original game while highlighting and expanding the period after historical World War II, including a hypothetical nuclear war between the Soviet Union and the Allies. The expansion pack features among other things a reworked intelligence model (which allows the player to use espionage, sabotage and other things in an &quot;intelligence page&quot; accessible through the main screen), improved AI and a scenario editor.

&quot;Doomsday&quot; also features some other changes and additions such as:
* Additional graphics such as bomber sprites
* Escort Carriers
* Hospitals that recover manpower losses
* A &quot;do not upgrade&quot; button for divisions
* The option of automating the production sliders
* Submarines have separate stats for convoy raiding and naval combat
* An extended timeframe — the game end date has been changed to 1953
* New technologies to bring the game into the cold war era
* An included scenario editor
* The ability to trade divisions between nations
* The ability to attach escorts while recruiting divisions

=== Armageddon ===
Another expansion was released in April 2007 in an alternate history scenario called &quot;Hearts of Iron II: Armageddon&quot;. It further allows more time and the player has the ability to choose 1964 as the end point. It allows the adding of modules to ships (such as improved radar, fire-control, anti-submarine or anti-aircraft weaponry) and submits two new scenarios for play, as well as an enhanced AI.

&quot;Armageddon&quot; also features some other changes and additions such as:
* Player can allow or disallow democracies to declare war on the main menu options screen
* Player may choose when the time of play will end, ranging as early as 1940 to as late as 1964
* Player may choose to get the full industrial capacity of an annexed country, or not
* Player may choose to use tech teams of an annexed country or not
* New brigade attachments for ships
* Diplomatic option to refuse expeditionary forces from player&#x27;s allies

=== Iron Cross ===
&quot;Iron Cross&quot; is an expansion of &quot;Hearts of Iron II: Armageddon&quot; released as a digital download on October 7, 2010, developed by Irshappa. It expands the number of provinces on the map as well as numerous other additions and can also be installed as a compatible expansion of &quot;Arsenal of Democracy&quot; and &quot;Darkest Hour&quot;.

&quot;Iron Cross&quot; also features some other changes and additions such as:
* Playing as one of 200 countries from 1933 to 1964, and interacting with real ministers and leaders
* New map with over 4,000 new provinces
* More than 6,000 new events
* New tech tree featuring 800 technologies, with a realistic research system
* New units and brigades, including special units, infantry regiment, heavy artillery, and more
* New AI offering more options and greater depth
* New scenarios set in 1933 and 1934 as well as old scenarios adapted to &quot;Iron Cross&quot;

== Reception ==

&quot;Hearts of Iron II&quot; was commercially successful for Paradox; Hanza Aziz of Destructoid called it the company&#x27;s &quot;first major hit&quot;. In the United States alone, it sold 80,000 copies on a marketing budget of $75,000.

On Metacritic the following reception was achieved by Paradox Development Studio:
* &quot;Heart of Iron II&quot;: 83/100 from the professional critics and 8.6/10 from the users.
* &quot;Doomsday&quot;: 80/100 from the professional critics and 8.8/10 from the users.

GameSpot gave it 8.3/10, writing that &quot;this is what the original game should have been&quot;.
At IGN, it received a score of 8.7/10.

&quot;Hearts of Iron II&quot; was a finalist for &quot;PC Gamer US&quot;″s &quot;Best Real-Time Strategy Game 2005&quot; award, which ultimately went to &quot;Age of Empires III&quot;. It was also nominated for the 2004 Charles S. Roberts Award for &quot;Best 20th Century Era Computer Wargame&quot;, but lost to &quot;Battles in Normandy&quot;.

<text>The Garden of Ridván (literally &quot;garden of paradise&quot;) or Najibiyyih Garden was a wooded garden in what is now Baghdad&#x27;s Rusafa District, on the banks of the Tigris river. It is notable as the location where Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, founder of the Baháʼí Faith, stayed for twelve days from April 21 to May 2, 1863, after the Ottoman Empire exiled him from Baghdad and before commencing his journey to Constantinople. During his stay in this garden, Baháʼu&#x27;lláh announced to his followers that he was the messianic figure of He whom God shall make manifest, whose coming had been foretold by the Báb. These events are celebrated annually during the Festival of Ridván.

==Location and appearance==

The garden was located in a large agricultural area immediately north of the walls of the city of Baghdad, about from the city&#x27;s northern Mu&#x27;azzam gate. Located on the eastern bank of the Tigris River in what is now the Bab al-Mu&#x27;azzam neighbourhood of Baghdad&#x27;s Rusafa District, it was directly opposite the district in which Baháʼu&#x27;lláh lived during his stay in the city, on the river&#x27;s western bank.

A ground plan drawn in the 1850s by officers of the Indian Navy &quot;(pictured)&quot; shows the garden immediately adjacent to the city&#x27;s citadel, with four avenues meeting at a circular area in the centre. A structure, possibly the garden palace, is located at the edge of the garden near the riverbank. The garden was described as a wooded garden having four &quot;flower-bordered avenues&quot; lined with roses, which were collected by gardeners during Baháʼu&#x27;lláh&#x27;s stay and piled in the center of his tent to be offered to visitors. &quot;So great would be the heap,&quot; the chronicler Nabíl-i-Aʻzam relates, &quot;that when His companions gathered to drink their morning tea in His presence, they would be unable to see each other across it.&quot; Nightingales were said to sing loudly in the garden, which, together with the fragrance of the roses, &quot;created an atmosphere of beauty and enchantment&quot;. By the side of the river, upstream from Najib Pasha&#x27;s palace, was an open space in the garden where one of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh&#x27;s companions raised a tent for him, around which a small village of tents was later raised for the rest of his family.

In travelling to Constantinople, Baháʼu&#x27;lláh&#x27;s caravan would take a road that would bring them by the garden, thus it was a logical choice for them stop there in order to assemble and to receive visitors. Access to the garden from the opposite riverbank was possible by way of a ferry across the Tigris, as in Baháʼu&#x27;lláh&#x27;s case, or by &quot;floating bridge&quot;, as in the case of the governor and other friends who followed.

==History==

The Najibiyyih Garden, as it was first known, was named for Muhammad Najib Pasha, the &quot;wāli&quot; (governor) of Baghdad from 1842 to 1847, who built the garden and an attached palace in what was originally an agricultural area outside the city. Although Najib Pasha died in May 1851, the garden was presumably in the hands of his heirs when it was used by Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, during the period of April–May 1863.

Despite its importance to the Baháʼí community, the garden was never owned by the Baháʼís. It was purchased by the government in 1870, and was used as a guest house for Nasruddin-Shah—who was responsible for Baháʼu&#x27;lláh&#x27;s imprisonment and exile—when he visited Iraq in 1870. The park was further developed during the governorship of Midhat Pasha (1869–1872), who leveled the road leading to the garden and built another road, approximately 400–500 meters in length. The garden was cleared during the early twentieth century, to make way for the Royal Hospital. Baghdad Medical City, a large complex of teaching hospitals, now stands in its place.

===Ridván===

Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, after being imprisoned in Persia for his involvement with the Bábí community, was exiled to Baghdad by Naser al-Din Shah Qajar, arriving in the spring of 1853. Over the next decade in Baghdad, his influence grew to the point where the Persian government feared he might use it to threaten their sovereignty from abroad. In response, the Persian ambassador in Constantinople demanded Baháʼu&#x27;lláh be banished from Baghdad, to which the Ottoman government eventually acceded.

Baháʼu&#x27;lláh entered the Najibiyyih Garden on April 22, 1863, in order to receive visitors and allow his family to prepare for his upcoming trip to Constantinople. He crossed the Tigris in a small boat accompanied by his sons ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá, Mírzá Mihdí and Mírzá Muhammad ʻAlí, his secretary Mirza Aqa Jan and some others. After their arrival in the garden, Baháʼu&#x27;lláh announced his mission and station for the first time to a small group of family and friends. For the next eleven days Baháʼu&#x27;lláh received visitors including the governor of Baghdad. Baháʼu&#x27;lláh&#x27;s family was not able to join him until April 30, the ninth day, since the river had risen and made travel to the garden difficult. On the twelfth day of their stay in the garden, Baháʼu&#x27;lláh and his family left the garden and started on their travel to Constantinople.

It was Baháʼu&#x27;lláh who gave the garden the name of &quot;Ridván&quot; (&quot;paradise&quot;) during his stay, and the name was thereafter applied to the twelve-day Festival of Ridván—known as the &quot;King of Festivals&quot;—celebrated annually by Baháʼís between 21 April and 2 May. Certain days of this festival are tied to major events that took place during the period of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh&#x27;s stay in the garden: the first day celebrates his arrival in the garden; the ninth day, the arrival of his family; and the twelfth day, his caravan&#x27;s departure towards Constantinople. These three days are major Baháʼí holy days, on which work must be suspended.

<text>Pawlo Humeniuk (June 18, 1883 – January 24, 1965) was a Ukrainian American fiddler from the early 20th century who became one of the biggest stars of the era&#x27;s ethnic music.

==Biography==
Humeniuk was born on June 18, 1883 in Pidvolochysk, a village that was then known as Podwołoczyska, Austria-Hungary, and is now in Ukraine. His native languages were Ukrainian and Polish. He arrived in the United States on December 8, 1908, where he found work as a violin maker. He performed at various celebrations, such as weddings, in the New York City area.

Humeniuk was signed to Okeh Records in 1925, and began recording on December 3 of that year. His early records sold well, and included kolomyikas, kozachoks and polkas. He was the undisputed king of Ukrainian American popular music, until Columbia Records began promoting Ewgen Zukowsky. The two occasionally worked together, such as on &quot;Ukrainske Wesilia&quot;, which is said to have sold more than 100,000 copies (though reliable records are not available from this era).

After 1926, Humeniuk began recording traditional Polish music under the name Paweł Humeniak. His influence in this field is important, as he helped develop the genre of American polka and inspired future bandleaders like Edward Krolikowski and Ignacy Podgorski. His 1928 &quot;Kanarek&quot; was the best-selling polka of the era, and set the standard for eastern-style polka.

Humeniuk&#x27;s last recording was in 1940.

He was married to Antoinette Szczepanik. They had four children: Walter (1914–1990), Mitchel &#x27;Mieczysław&#x27; (1916–2003), Sophie &#x27;Zofia&#x27; (1922–1930) and Lucy (1925–1993).

Before the ministry renamed itself on January 8, 2008, the ministry&#x27;s English name was &quot;Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport&quot;.
One of the mother ministries, the Ministry of Construction, along with the former Ministry of Home Affairs, the National Police Agency and the former Ministry of Health and Welfare, is the successor to the pre-WW2 Home Ministry, and has sent deputy governors and deputy mayors to each prefecture and municipality since becoming the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport.

==Organization==
MLIT is organized into the following bureaus:
*
*

<text>Boroughbridge ( ) is a town and civil parish in North Yorkshire, England. Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, it is north-west of York. Until a bypass was built the town lay on the main A1 road from London to Edinburgh, which crosses the River Ure here.

The civil parish includes the villages of Aldborough and Minskip.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The origin of the name &#x27;Boroughbridge&#x27; lies in its location relative to Aldborough, the principal settlement during the Roman period and known as Isurium Brigantum. Dere Street, the Roman road heading north from York, originally crossed the River Ure just north of Aldborough, but at an unknown date the road was diverted to cross the river at Boroughbridge. The place was first mentioned in 1155 in the Latin form &quot;pontem de Burgo&quot; and by 1298 in the English form &quot;Burghbrig&quot; (&#x27;the bridge near Burgh or Aldborough&#x27;). A new town grew up at the bridge and the Old Town became known as the &#x27;Ald-Borough&#x27;.

===Early===

A line of three menhirs, or standing stones, known as the Devil&#x27;s Arrows, believed to have been erected in the Bronze Age, can be found on the outskirts of Boroughbridge, by the side of the A1. The tallest stone is tall. The stones are of millstone grit, probably quarried from Plompton, the closest source of this material. The stones stand on an almost north–south alignment, with the central stone slightly offset. The first reference to the stones is from the journal of a fisherman, Peter Frankck, who visited Boroughbridge in 1694 and claims he saw seven stones. The antiquarian John Leyland saw four stones, which is the verifiable number. The absent fourth stone stood close to the central stone and was dug out and broken up, allegedly by treasure hunters. Most of it was used to build Peg Bridge, which crosses the River Tutt as it enters the town. According to tradition the top of the fourth stone was to be found in the grounds of Aldborough Hall, which stands between Boroughbridge and Aldborough.

===Medieval===
Boroughbridge was not mentioned in Domesday Book of 1086, but was later described as part of the manor of Aldborough. In 1229 Boroughbridge, as part of the manor of Aldborough, was granted to Hubert de Burgh, but was forfeited a few years later by his son, who fought against the king at the Battle of Evesham in 1265. It then remained a royal manor until Charles I granted it to several citizens of London.

St James&#x27; Church, Boroughbridge originated as a Norman chapel-of-ease to St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Aldborough, but was rebuilt on a new site in 1852. The Borough Bridge was in existence in the 12th century, and the current structure dates from 1562.

In 1318 Boroughbridge was devastated by the Scots under Sir James Douglas following the Capture of Berwick upon Tweed.

In 1322 the Battle of Boroughbridge took place as King Edward II overpowered Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, bringing about the end of Edward II&#x27;s retaliation against those who had opposed him in the Despenser War of 1321–22. The Battle Cross, commemorating the event, was erected in the market square, but was moved to Aldborough in 1852.

===Modern===

From medieval times Boroughbridge was part of the parish of Aldborough in the West Riding of Yorkshire. In 1553 it became a parliamentary borough, electing two Members of Parliament to the unreformed House of Commons. It had a burgage franchise, meaning that the right to vote was tied to ownership of certain of property in the borough and had fewer than 100 qualified voters by the time it was abolished in the Reform Act of 1832. It was a pocket borough under the control of the Dukes of Newcastle. Augustus FitzRoy, who was Prime Minister as the 3rd Duke of Grafton, was elected MP for Boroughbridge in 1756 but never sat for the borough, preferring to represent Bury St Edmunds, where he had also been elected.

Boroughbridge was an important stage for stagecoaches because of its position on the Great North Road midway between London and Edinburgh. An advertisement in the &quot;Edinburgh Courant&quot; for 1754 reads: 

Boroughbridge became a separate civil parish in 1866. In 1938 the civil parish absorbed the parishes of Aldborough and Minskip.
In 1945 the bridge carrying the A1 road over the River Ure collapsed under the weight of a heavy vehicle carrying an 80-ton steel mill roll housing from Sheffield to Falkirk. The incident interrupted the main transport route for a short time and the army installed a Bailey bridge until repairs were completed.

In 1974 Boroughbridge was transferred from the West Riding to the new county of North Yorkshire. It was part of the Borough of Harrogate between 1974 and 2023.

In 2011 the town&#x27;s sewage works, which serves a population of ten thousand, was upgraded, with the old bar screens, which had reached the end of their working life, being replaced with modern wire-mesh drum screens able to screen out an increasingly large amount of undesirable waste and also filter grit and fat, thus decreasing the load on the plant. They were designed to meet the plant&#x27;s stringent outfall requirements as set out by the Environment Agency. The settling and humus tanks were also upgraded from old manual sludging under hydrostatic head to circular tanks fitted with scrapers to desludge the tanks automatically.

==Governance==
An electoral ward of the same name exists. At the 2011 Census this ward had a population of 3,104.

==Education==
Boroughbridge has both a primary school and a secondary school. Boroughbridge High School marked its 25th anniversary in the summer of 2007.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and BBC North East and Cumbria on BBC One and ITV Yorkshire and ITV Tyne Tees on ITV. Television signals are received from either the Emley Moor or Bilsdale transmitters.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio York on 104.3 FM and Greatest Hits Radio Harrogate and the Yorkshire Dales on 97.2 FM.

The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Harrogate Advertiser&quot;.

<text>Le Train de Nulle Part (The Train from Nowhere) is a 233-page French novel, written in 2004 by a French doctor of letters, Michel Dansel, under the pen name Michel Thaler. Notable as an example of constrained writing, the entire novel is written without a single verb.

In the novel&#x27;s preface, Thaler called the verb an &quot;invader, dictator, usurper of our literature&quot;. Considering the novel a step towards literature comparable with the artistic impact of Dadaism and surrealism, Thaler surmised, &quot;The verb is like a weed in a field of flowers. You have to get rid of it to allow the flowers to grow and flourish. Take away the verbs and the language speaks for itself.&quot; Thaler went so far as to organize a well-attended, tongue-in-cheek funeral for the verb, at the Sorbonne in Paris.

==Sample==

What luck! A vacant seat, almost, in that compartment. A provisional stop, why not? So, my new address in this nowhere train: car 12, 3rd compartment from the front. Once again, why not?

<doc id="1328010" wikidata="Q1353137" url="?curid=1328010" title="The Adventure of the Stockbroker's Clerk">
<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Stockbroker&#x27;s Clerk&quot; is one of the 56 short Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It is the fourth of the twelve collected in &quot;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot; in most British editions of the canon, and third of eleven in most American ones (owing to the omission of the &quot;scandalous&quot; &quot;Adventure of the Cardboard Box&quot;). The story was first published in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in March 1893, and in the US in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; in the same month.

==Plot==

A young clerk, Hall Pycroft, consults Holmes with his suspicions concerning a company that has offered him a very well-paid job. Holmes, Watson and Pycroft travel by train to Birmingham, where the job is initially to be based, and Pycroft explains that he was recently made redundant from a stockbroking house. He eventually secured a new post with another group of stockbrokers, Mawson and Williams, in Lombard Street in the City. Before taking up the job, he was approached by Arthur Pinner, who offered him a managership with a newly established hardware distribution company, to be based in France.

Pycroft is sent to Birmingham to meet Pinner&#x27;s brother and company co-founder, Harry Pinner. He is offered a very well-paid post with £100 in advance, and is asked to sign a document accepting the post, and is also asked not to send a letter of resignation to his current employers. He immediately commences his duties, but he is concerned about the unprofessional aspects of the business and their sparse offices, as well as the suspicious fact that the two Pinners have a distinctive gold filling in their teeth in the same place, suggesting that they might be the same man.

When the trio arrive at the office, on Corporation Street, Birmingham, with Holmes and Watson presented as fellow job-seekers, Pinner is reading a London newspaper and is clearly in shock. As they leave, he attempts suicide, but Watson is able to revive him. Holmes concludes that the story of the brothers is a fabrication and that there is only one &#x27;Pinner&#x27;; lacking enough men to make their attempt to deceive Pycroft convincing, Pinner had attempted to pose as his brother to make up the numbers in the hope that Pycroft would dismiss the similarities between them as a family resemblance. He further deduces that the whole point of the exercise was to obtain an example of Pycroft&#x27;s handwriting so that a &#x27;fake&#x27; Pycroft may be employed at Mawsons (hence why they asked him to not officially resign his post). Mawsons was keeping a vast stock of valuable securities, and &#x27;Pycroft&#x27; was to be a safebreaker.

From the newspaper, they learn that Mawson &amp; Williams have suffered an attempted robbery, but that the criminal had been captured, although the weekend watchman has been murdered. Beddington, the forger and cracksman, was the miscreant, masquerading as Pycroft, and his brother was masquerading as Pinner. American railway bonds worth nearly £100,000 were taken, together with a large amount of scrip in mines and other companies, but the police recovered them from the thief.

As the police are called to arrest &#x27;Pinner&#x27;, Holmes observes that &quot;Human nature is a strange mixture, Watson. You see that even a villain and murderer can inspire such affection that his brother turns to suicide when he learns that his neck is forfeited&quot;.

==Commentary==
This story&#x27;s plot is reminiscent of that in &quot;The Red-Headed League&quot;, for it, too, involves an elaborate hoax designed to remove an inconvenient person from the scene for a while so that a crime can be committed. The same parallel can be seen in &quot;The Adventure of the Three Garridebs&quot;. However, in contrast to these other two cases, the &#x27;inconvenient person&#x27; in this case proves insightful enough to realize at least some of the deception on his own accord, whereas the other cases see Holmes being brought in to investigate more peripheral matters.

It is worth noting that Holmes is not involved in the apprehension of the thief, who has already been arrested, but is able to turn the accomplice over to the police.

== Publication history ==
&quot;The Adventure of the Stockbroker&#x27;s Clerk&quot; was published in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in March 1893. It was also published in the US in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; on 11 March 1893, and in the US edition of &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in April 1893. The story was published with seven illustrations by Sidney Paget in the &quot;Strand&quot;, and with one illustration by W. H. Hyde in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. It was included in &quot;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in December 1893 in the UK and February 1894 in the US.

<doc id="1328012" wikidata="Q3440096" url="?curid=1328012" title="Roland Hayes">
<text>Roland Wiltse Hayes (June 3, 1887 – January 1, 1977) was an American lyric tenor and composer. Critics lauded his abilities and linguistic skills demonstrated with songs in French, German, and Italian. Hayes’ predecessors as well-known African-American concert artists, including Sissieretta Jones and Marie Selika, were not recorded. Along with Marian Anderson and Paul Robeson, Hayes was one of the first to break this barrier in the classical repertoire when he recorded with Columbia in 1939.

==Early years and family==
Hayes was born in Curryville, Georgia, on June 3, 1887, to William Hayes (died ca. 1898) and wife Fannie (or Fanny, née Mann; ca. 1848 – aft. 1920), tenant farmers on the plantation where his mother had once been a slave; the Hayes farm appears to be on one of the tracts of land given by a plantation owner named Culpepper to some black people who worked for them. Roland&#x27;s father, who was his first music teacher, often took him hunting and taught him to appreciate the musical sounds of nature. 

When Hayes was 11, his father died, and his mother moved the family to Chattanooga, Tennessee. William Hayes claimed to have some Cherokee ancestry, while his maternal great-grandfather, Aba Ougi (renamed as Charles Mann) was a Chieftain from the Ivory Coast. Aba Ougi was captured and shipped to the United States of America in 1790. 

Mt. Zion Baptist Church in Curryville (founded by Roland&#x27;s mother) is where Roland first heard the music he would cherish forever, Negro spirituals. It was Roland&#x27;s job to learn new spirituals from the elders and teach them to the congregation. A quote of him talking about beginning his career with a pianist: 
I happened upon a new method for making iron sash-weights,&quot; he said, &quot;and that got me a little raise in pay and a little free time. At that time I had never heard any real music, although I had had some lessons in rhetoric from a backwoods teacher in Georgia. But one day a pianist came to our church in Chattanooga, and I, as a choir member, was asked to sing a solo with him. The pianist liked my voice, and he took me in hand and introduced me to phonograph records by Caruso. That opened the heavens for me. The beauty of what could be done with the voice just overwhelmed me.

Hayes trained with Arthur Calhoun, an organist and choir director, in Chattanooga. Roland began studying music at Fisk University in Nashville in 1905 although he had only a 6th-grade education. Hayes&#x27;s mother thought he was wasting money because she believed that African Americans could not make a living from singing. As a student he began publicly performing, touring with the Fisk Jubilee Singers in 1911. He furthered his studies in Boston with Arthur Hubbard, who agreed to give him lessons only if Hayes came to his house instead of his studio. He did not want Roland to embarrass him by appearing at his studio with his white students. During his period studying with Hubbard, he worked as a messenger for the Hancock Life Insurance Company to support himself.

==Early career==

In January 1915 Hayes premiered in Manhattan, New York City in concerts presented by orchestra leader Walter F. Craig. Hayes performed his own musical arrangements in recitals from 1916 to 1919, touring from coast to coast. For his first recital he was unable to find a sponsor so he used 200 dollars of his own money to rent Jordan Hall for his classical recital. To earn money he went on a tour of black churches and colleges in the South. In 1917 he announced his second concert, which would be held in Boston&#x27;s Symphony Hall. On November 15, 1917, every seat in the hall was sold and Hayes&#x27;s concert was a success both musically and financially, but the music industry was still not considering him a top classical performer. He sang at Walter Craig&#x27;s Pre-Lenten Recitals and several Carnegie Hall concerts. He performed with the Philadelphia Concert Orchestra, and at the Atlanta Colored Music Festivals and at the Washington Conservatory concerts. In 1917, he toured with the Hayes Trio, which he formed with baritone William Richardson (singer) and pianist William Lawrence (pianist).

In April 1920, Hayes traveled to Europe. He began lessons with Sir George Henschel, who was the first conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and gave his first recital in London&#x27;s Aeolian Hall in May 1920 with pianist Lawrence Brown as his accompanist. By at least June 1921 he was being invited to sing at private house parties; the poet Siegfried Sassoon heard him while staying with the wealthy music-lover Frank Schuster at Bray-on-Thames. Soon Hayes was singing in capital cities across Europe and was quite famous. Almost a year after his arrival in Europe, Hayes had a concert at London&#x27;s Wigmore Hall. The next day, he received a summons from King George V and Queen Mary to give a command performance at Buckingham Palace. He returned to the United States of America in 1923. He made his official debut on November 16, 1923, in Boston&#x27;s Symphony Hall singing Berlioz, Mozart, and spirituals, conducted by Pierre Monteux, which received critical acclaim. He was the first African-American soloist to appear with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He was awarded the Spingarn Medal in 1924.

==Late career==
Hayes finally secured professional management with the Boston Symphony Orchestra Concert Company. He was reportedly making $100,000 a year at this point in his career. In Boston he also worked as a voice teacher. One of his pupils was the Canadian soprano Frances James. He published musical scores for a collection of spirituals in 1948 as &quot;My Songs: Aframerican Religious Folk Songs Arranged and Interpreted&quot;.

In 1925, Hayes had an affair with a married Czech aristocrat, Bertha Henriette Katharina Nadine, Gräfin von Colloredo-Mansfeld (June 21, 1890 in Týnec – January 29, 1982 in Auch), which resulted in a pregnancy. Bertha had been married in Vienna since 10 August 1909 to a member of a German princely family, Hieronymus von Colloredo (November 3, 1870 in Dobříš – August 29, 1942 in Prague), who was 20 years her senior. He refused to allow the expected child to bear his name or to be raised along with the couple&#x27;s four older children, quietly managing to obtain a divorce in Prague on 8 January 1926, while Bertha left their home in Zbiroh, Czechoslovakia, to bear Hayes&#x27;s child in Basel, Switzerland. Hayes offered to adopt the child, while the countess sought to resume the couple&#x27;s relationship, while concealing it, until the late 1920s. Their daughter, Maya Kolowrat, would marry Russian &quot;émigré&quot; farm-worker, later painter, Yuri Mikhailovich Bogdanoff (January 28, 1928 in Leningrad – 2012). Maya later gave birth in Saint-Lary, Gers, to twins Igor and Grichka Bogdanoff in 1949, who later attributed their early interest in the sciences to their unhampered childhood access to their maternal grandmother&#x27;s castle library.

After the 1930s, Hayes stopped touring in Europe because the change in politics and the rise of the Nazi Party made it unfavourable to African Americans.

In 1932, while in Los Angeles, for a Hollywood Bowl performance, he married Helen Alzada Mann (1893–1988). The new Mrs. Hayes was born in Chattanooga and graduated from what is now Tennessee State University. One year later they had a daughter, Afrika Hayes. The family moved into a home in Brookline, Massachusetts. In 1943 he sang several times in Britain to entertain troops, and appeared at the Royal Albert Hall on 29 September as the soloist before a 200-member choir of all Black soldiers, and all from USAAF Engineer Aviation Battalions. After the concert he dined at the London residence of Lt. Gen. John C. H. Lee, Commanding General of all logistics forces in the European Theater of Operations, who routinely received visiting political, manufacturing, and show business figures in the Theater.

Hayes did not perform very much from the 1940s to the 1970s, but continued yearly concerts at Carnegie Hall in New York and performances at Fisk and other colleges. In 1966, he was awarded the degree of Honorary Doctorate of Music from The Hartt School of Music, University of Hartford. Hayes continued to perform until the age of 85, when he gave his last concert at the Longy School of Music in Cambridge. He was able to purchase the land in Georgia on which he had grown up as a child.

He died on January 1, 1977, five years after his final concert.

==Racial reaction==
Hayes, before departing from Prague for Berlin in 1924, was warned by American Consul General not to go to Germany until the occupying armies had been withdrawn, as Germans had bitter feelings over being occupied by armies with black troops. An open letter to the American Ambassador was published in a Berlin newspaper, calling &quot;for the prevention of a certain calamity: namely, the concert of an American Negro who has come to Berlin to defile the name of the German poets and composers&quot;. despite this protest, Hayes wrote, &quot;I refused to believe ... that they would hold me, a private Negro citizen of the United States, responsible for the presence of French-speaking Africans&quot;. Hayes booked his recital at Konzerthaus Berlin with no difficulties. Germans were still unhappy about his appearance in Berlin, and when he appeared on stage several members of the audience began to boo and hiss at the singer. Despite the hostile climate, Hayes began to sing Franz Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Du bist die Ruh&#x27;&quot;. Hayes&#x27;s remarkable voice and musical talent won over the audience and his concert was a success.

Hayes&#x27;s wife and daughter mistakenly sat in seats reserved for white customers in a shoe store in Rome, Georgia in 1942. An argument erupted which resulted in the two leaving. Later, Hayes confronted the store owner, whom he knew, and resolved the conflict. Upon leaving, Hayes was assaulted by police and put under arrest, with his wife also being taken into custody. Gradually the story received national attention and much sympathy for Hayes. The assaulting police officer was fired, with federal charges made against him. A poem by Langston Hughes, entitled &quot;How About It, Dixie&quot;, refers to the incident.

Hayes faced heavy criticism from anti-Jim Crow activists for performing in an integrated theater in Washington, D.C., on January 5, 1926, followed by a segregated theater in Baltimore, Maryland, on January 7, 1926.

Hayes taught at Black Mountain College for the 1945 Summer institute where his public concert was, according to Martin Duberman, &quot;one of the great moments in Black Mountain&#x27;s history&quot;. After this concert, in which unsegregated seating went well, the school had its first full-time black student and full-time member of the faculty.

<text>The domra (Cyrillic: до́мра, ) is a long-necked Belarusian, Russian, and Ukrainian folk string instrument of the lute family with a round body and three or four metal strings.

==History==
The first known mention of domra is in &quot;Admonitions of Metropolitan Daniel&quot; (1530). This musical instrument gained great popularity in the 16th–17th centuries, replacing gusli. There are numerous mentions of domra in historic documents of this period. In addition, medieval Russian illuminated manuscripts of the Psalter contain images of musicians with necked plucked-string instruments, and some of those miniatures are clearly captioned «depiction of domras». Judging by those images, late medieval Russian domras can be divided into two types: lute-shaped, which had five to six strings, a large body and а pegbox angled back, and tanbur-shaped, which had three to four strings, a small body and a straight pegbox.

After the pious Tsar Alexis of Russia issued an edict ordering the persecution of Russian folk musicians and destruction of their instruments (1648), domra gradually came into disuse and was replaced by balalaika, which was much easier to make and play.

In 1896, a student of Vasily Vasilievich Andreyev found a broken instrument in a stable in rural Russia. It was thought that this instrument may have been an example of a domra, although at that time no illustrations or examples of the traditional domra were known to exist (the traditional domra was only known through numerous mentions in folklore, though examples existed of the &quot;dombra&quot;, a related Turkic instrument). A three-stringed version of this instrument was later redesigned in 1896, patented, and introduced into the orchestra of Russian folk instruments.

==Orchestral instruments==
The basic domra is tuned as follows:
* Three strings: EAD tuning. 
* Four strings: GDAE tuning (like the mandolin or the violin)

Instruments are made in various sizes including piccolo, prima, alto, tenor, bass, and contrabass.

* Piccolo: b1 e2 a2
* Prima: e1 a1 d2
* Mezzo-Soprano: b e1 a1
* Alto: e a d1
* Tenor: B e a
* Bass: E A d
* Contrabass (minor): 1E 1A D
* Contrabass (major): 1A D G

==Performers==
Tamara Volskaya is considered to be one of the leading contemporary performers on the 4 string domra. She is a Merited Artist of Russia, a Laureate of the USSR competition, and a professor at the Mussorgsky Ural State Conservatory in Yekaterinburg, Russia. She now lives in New York City. 
Aleksandr Tsygankov is considered to be one of the leading contemporary performers, teachers, and composers of the 3 string domra. He lives in Moscow.

<doc id="1328025" wikidata="Q13476187" url="?curid=1328025" title="Lillian Evanti">
<text>Lillian Evanti (August 12, 1890 – December 6, 1967) was an American soprano, composer, and civil rights advocate who broke racial barriers in classical music. Excluded from opportunities in the racially segregated American opera scene, Evanti was the first African American to perform with a major European opera company, earning acclaim for her performances across France, Italy, and South America singing works by Delibes, Verdi, and Handel. Evanti was a prolific recitalist, an esteemed composer, and a trailblazer for Black artists in classical music, advocating for racial equality in the arts, performing for First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt at the White House, and marching alongside civil rights leaders in the 1963 March on Washington.

==Early life and education==
Evanti was born in Washington, D.C., and graduated from Armstrong Manual Training School, where her father, W. Bruce Evans, was the first principal. Her paternal grandfather, Henry Evans, was born in North Carolina as a free black man and later moved to Oberlin, Ohio, where he helped with the Underground Railroad. Evanti&#x27;s maternal grandfather, John H. Brooks, was elected to the House of Delegates in 1874 and defeated Frederick Douglas Jr. Although gifted in music, in 1908, Evanti entered Miner Teachers College (now University of the District of Columbia) for the education of black elementary school teachers. While there, Evanti met Georgia Douglas Johnson, a future poet and literary figure Evanti would later consult with in writing songs. Evanti graduated from Howard University with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in music. At her commencement in May 1917, Evanti sang French, German, and English as well as American songs that brought her national attention by the black press, such as the New York Age (being a woman of color, Evanti was not discovered by white media for over a decade after this performance).

== Career ==
With the support from her husband, Evanti set sail for Paris in 1924 to begin her operatic journey. To sound more European, Evanti combined her maiden name &quot;Evans&quot; and her married name &quot;Tibbs&quot; to create her new stage name, Evanti. As an African American classical singer in America, she had little success outside of the black community. Evanti hoped that in France, she would finally find her voice. In Paris, Evanti studied voice with French soprano Gabrielle Ritter-Ciampi and, within the year, moved to Nice, where her instructor advised her to audition at the local opera houses. Evanti, a soprano, sang at the Belasco Theatre in 1926 with Marian Anderson.
Evanti debuted in 1925 in Delibes&#x27;s &quot;Lakmé&quot; at Nice, France. Although Evanti was receiving praise in Europe, only black newspapers were picking up her success in America. In an article by The Chicago Defender (national edition) on September 26, 1925, Evanti goes into detail about the unknown color prejudice she experienced in France after her debut. &quot;Distinguished Parisians understand us,&quot; says Madame Evanti. &quot;There is no such thing as color prejudice, especially among the upper classes.&quot; The article then goes into a story of her making her first public appearance in a joint recital with a violinist at the home of the distinguished Salmon family: &quot;I feel that Mme. Salmon understands very thoroughly the race question in America. She has made a special study of it and is very much interested in the general progress of the Negro.&quot;

As Evanti&#x27;s popularity grew, she sang opera at Toulon, Montpelier, and Monte Carlo, where, in 1926, she was a guest artist of the Monte-Carlo Philharmonic Orchestra. Finally, in 1927, Evanti was invited to sing in Paris. The Chicago Defender reviewed her singing the same role at the Trianon-Lyrique in Paris on Christmas Eve of 1927. &quot;When the posters all over Paris announced that an American would interpret &quot;Lakme&quot; on Christmas Eve night, the theater-going public began to wonder. An American interpreting the leading role at the Trianon-Lyrique? That&#x27;s one of the things which almost never happen. She was no longer an American singing in French, she was an artist of rare ability; she was all that Delibes himself could have desired in his heroine.&quot; During her time in Europe, Evanti would return home to Washington every summer and give concerts there. Along with spirituals, Evanti presented a broad repertoire, including works by Handel, Scarlatti, Bellini, and Rameau, which grabbed the attention of a few &quot;white&quot; papers. However, they neglected to identify her as a black singer.

As Evanti&#x27;s reputation and demand grew, her marriage began to suffer. Her husband, Roy Tibbs, who was once enthusiastic about supporting her career, was now beginning to resent her success. In September 1925, while visiting her family, Evanti found that Roy had left their house and was ill. After nursing him back to health, Evanti returned to France only to come back again two years later to a cold and empty house. Evanti decided to sue Roy for separate maintenance. In an article by The New York Amsterdam News on August 22, 1927, &quot;she sought to return to him and that he refused to see her, that when she went to see him, he left the house and that she and her son remained. Mrs. Tibbs stated that from 1924 to 1927, she did not receive more than $225 from her husband for her support and assistance maintenance. She says her husband after urging her to pursue her career has tried to make it appear that her ambition is the cause of their separation.&quot; The District of Columbia Court of Appeals granted Evanti&#x27;s petition and ordered Roy Tibbs to pay monthly child support. After her divorce, Evanti continued to travel with her mother and son. Evanti toured throughout Europe and South America as an opera singer and concert artist.

In early 1932, Gatti-Casazza, the Metropolitan Opera Company general manager, invited her to audition at their house. Lillian left Europe at the height of her career to sing opera in her native country. Unfortunately, they refused to give her a contract. With all of her European success, it was hard to believe that the highest opera house in America would deny this diva their stage. Evanti auditioned for them two more times, the last time in 1946 at the age of fifty-six. They never offered her a contract due to racial segregation. Nevertheless, Evanti continued to sing from 1932 to 1935 in the United States to praise and acclaim for the &quot;tonal beauty of her voice.&quot;, including a private recital at the White House for an audience of Eleanor Roosevelt and her friends.

In 1943, Evanti performed with the Watergate Theater barge on the Potomac River.
In 1944, Evanti appeared at The Town Hall (New York City).
Evanti received acclaim as Violetta in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La traviata&quot; as produced by the National Negro Opera Company in 1945. In an article by The Chicago Defender (National edition) on August 14, 1943 &quot;Miss Evanti expressed a desire to see more of her race become interested in opera. She explained that &quot;La Traviata&quot; is offering her an opportunity to translate the role of Violetta in English, in order that a better understanding will be afforded those witnessing the performance.&quot;

Evanti continued to give concerts and recitals nationwide and, in the 1940s, began to spend more time composing. In 1942, Evanti visited notorious blues composer W.C Handy and thus began a musical relationship between composer and publisher. The Handy Brothers published Evanti&#x27;s &quot;The Mighty Rapture&quot;, &quot;The Twenty-third Psalm&quot;, &quot;Thank You Again and Again&quot;, &quot;Speak to Him Thou&quot;, and &quot;High Flight&quot;. Eventually, Evanti published her music as owner and founder of the Columbia Music Bureau in Washington.

In 1963, Evanti walked with her friend Alma Thomas in the March on Washington. Evanti was also a member of Zeta Phi Beta sorority.

In the post-World War II era, her life changed drastically when her husband, mother, and brother died within five years of each other. Her grief and the decline of professional demands gave Evanti a chance to grow closer with her son, his wife, and her two grandchildren. Although Evanti was no longer singing on grand opera stages, Evanti became involved in the music life within the D.C. community and brought her love and passion to the &quot;Evanti Chorale&quot;. Evanti&#x27;s prologue to her unpublished autobiography can be found at the Center for Black Music Research at Columbia College Chicago.

== Personal life ==
Evanti married Roy W. Tibbs, a former director of the Coleridge-Taylor Society, a Washington D. C. African-American chorus founded in honor of the composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. They lived at 1910 Vermont Avenue in the Shaw Neighborhood of Northwest, Washington, D.C., which is now known as the Evans-Tibbs House and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. They had a grandson, Thurlow E. Tibbs, Jr, an art dealer, born in 1952.

<text>Irwin Winkler (born May 25, 1931) is an American film producer and director. He is the producer or director of over 58 motion pictures, dating back to 1967&#x27;s &quot;Double Trouble&quot;, starring Elvis Presley. The fourth film he produced, &quot;They Shoot Horses, Don&#x27;t They?&quot; (1969), starring Jane Fonda, was nominated for nine Academy Awards. He won an Oscar for Best Picture for 1976&#x27;s &quot;Rocky&quot;. As a producer, he has been nominated for Best Picture for four films: &quot;Rocky&quot; (1976)&quot;, Raging Bull&quot; (1980), &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; (1983), and &quot;Goodfellas&quot; (1990).

==Early life and education==
Winkler was born on May 25, 1931 to a Jewish family in New York City, to Sol and Anna Winkler. Growing up in Coney Island, one of his first jobs was on a bumper ride on the boardwalk. Winkler graduated early from high school and got into New York University, but felt out of place among the older and more mature students, many of whom were former World War II soldiers that had entered university under the G.I. Bill. At the outbreak of the Korean War, he volunteered to join the Army and was stationed in Louisiana for two years. After completing his service, Winkler returned to New York University and went on to receive a degree in American Literature in 1955.

==Early career==
Winkler&#x27;s first job after graduating university was at the William Morris Agency (WMA). Among his first clients as an agent were comedians Sammy Shore and Jackie Vernon, though Winkler says of himself he was a &quot;mediocre&quot; agent.

After meeting Robert Chartoff, who managed several comedians, including Jackie Mason, the two set up their own talent management company. One of the &quot;unsuccessful clients&quot; the William Morris Agency allowed him to take with him at the time that he had options on, was the actress Julie Christie, whose screentest for &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; they arranged. Through another of their clients, Winkler and Chartoff brokered the John Schlesinger film &quot;Darling&quot; to film producer Joseph E. Levine. This deal led them from talent management to film production.

==Career as film producer and director==
Forming the production company Chartoff-Winkler Productions, Winkler began producing films with his partner Robert Chartoff in the late 1960s. Their first effort (along with Judd Bernard), was &quot;Double Trouble&quot; (1967) starring Elvis Presley . Their next film was John Boorman&#x27;s thriller &quot;Point Blank&quot; (1967) starring Lee Marvin, which is now regarded as a classic. Adding Sydney Pollack to their production team for one project, they garnered critical acclaim for &quot;They Shoot Horses, Don&#x27;t They?&quot; (1969). Their next film, &quot;The Strawberry Statement&quot; (1970), won the Jury Prize at Cannes. Chartoff and Winkler achieved their greatest success yet with &quot;Rocky&quot; (1976), which earned the Academy Award as Best Picture. Subsequently, the producing duo picked up Best Picture Oscar nominations for &quot;Raging Bull&quot; (1980) and &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; (1983), their last project together before Chartoff-Winkler Productions dissolved in 1985.

Winkler produced such noteworthy features as &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; (1983) which received eight Academy Award nominations with four wins, &quot;Round Midnight&quot; (1986) which garnered two Academy Award nominations. He then produced back-to-back Costa-Gavras films, &quot;Betrayed&quot; (1988) and &quot;Music Box&quot; (1989), which was nominated and won the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival, before receiving another Best Picture Oscar nomination for &quot;Goodfellas&quot; (1990). &quot;He also produced Rocky II&quot; (1978), Rocky III (1982), &quot;Rocky IV&quot; (1985) and &quot;Rocky V&quot; (1990).

Winkler moved into the director&#x27;s chair, debuting with &quot;Guilty by Suspicion&quot; (1991), a drama (which he also scripted) about the Hollywood blacklist that starred Robert De Niro, which was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival. His second feature, a remake of &quot;Night and the City&quot;, also starred De Niro and was chosen as the closing feature for the 1992 New York Film Festival. Winkler fared excellently at the box office as the writer-director of the Sandra Bullock vehicle &quot;The Net&quot; (1995), which spawned a series of the same name debuting on the USA Network in 1998.

&quot;Life as a House&quot; (2001) made its world debut at the 2001 Toronto Film Festival and told the tale of a depressed dying man (Kevin Kline) who funnels his energies into rebuilding the dilapidated beach shack he inherited from his abusive father and, in the process, building bridges between himself and his disaffected son (Hayden Christensen). After this film received critical praise, Winkler re-teamed with Kline for the follow-up &quot;De-Lovely&quot; (2004), casting the actor as the lead in his biographical film about American composer Cole Porter, which centered on his unique relationship with his wife and muse (Ashley Judd) and was chosen as the closing night film at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival.

While his directorial career would last through 2006, Winkler continued to produce his share of films, including &quot;The Shipping News&quot; (2001), &quot;Enough&quot; (2002), the 2014 remake of &quot;The Gambler&quot;—he&#x27;d also produced James Toback&#x27;s 1974 original—and his further return to the &quot;Rocky&quot; franchise with &quot;Rocky Balboa&quot; (2006) and the spin-offs &quot;Creed&quot; (2015), which was nominated for multiple awards including 6 NAACP Image Awards, winning 4, and &quot;Creed II&quot; (2018). His work with Scorsese continued on with &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot; (2013), &quot;Silence&quot; (2016), and &quot;The Irishman&quot; (2019) which was Winkler&#x27;s first collaboration with Netflix.

In 2019, Winkler published his autobiography, &quot;A Life In Movies: Stories from 50 years in Hollywood&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Winkler looks back fondly on a career producing some of the most successful films of the 20th century.&quot;

==Personal life==
Winkler married his wife Margo Winkler in 1959 while still working at WMA in New York. They moved to Los Angeles in 1966. Margo was originally from California and her parents, Irma and Charlie Melson, were former Vaudeville performers. The couple have three sons, Charles Winkler, David Winkler, and Adam Winkler.

The tunnels are named after former Honolulu Mayor John H. Wilson, who built the first carriage road over the Nu‘uanu Pali in 1898. While mayor, Wilson advocated a tunnel connecting Kaneohe with Honolulu through Kalihi Valley. The City and County of Honolulu spent US$12 million on the tunnels and highway. Construction started on the Honolulu-bound tunnel in January 1954, and the Kāneʻohe-bound tunnel in 1957. Five people died during their construction, and they were opened to traffic in November 1960.
The tunnels are now maintained by the Hawaii State Department of Transportation.

<text>Gabi Burgstaller (born 23 May 1963) is an Austrian politician, and the former governor (&quot;Landeshauptfrau&quot;) of the federal state of Salzburg.

==Life==
She was born in Penetzdorf/Niederthalheim near Schwanenstadt in Upper Austria. After matriculation at a high school in Gmunden and one year abroad in England, she studied law at the University of Salzburg. From 1987 until 1989, she worked as an assistant at the Institutes for Constitutional and Administrative Law, and Sociology of Law respectively at the same university. From 1989, Burgstaller worked as a consumer consultant at the Salzburg Chamber of Labour. There, specializing in residential rights and tenancy law, she earned an excellent reputation acting on behalf of 25,000 investors defrauded by the WEB-IMMAG building trust company.

In 1994, she started her political career as a member of the Salzburg federal state government, where she acted as chairperson of the Austrian Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) from the beginning. On 27 April 1999, Burgstaller was elected State Councillor in Salzburg State&#x27;s government. In the government Burgstaller was responsible for female concerns, construction, trade, consumerism, and transport.

On 31 March 2001, Burgstaller was elected as the first woman to head Salzburg&#x27;s Social Democratic Party with an approval of 98% of delegates. On 25 April, she was appointed as first deputy governor of the federal state of Salzburg. Her agendas included the purviews of communities, health and youth issues, and again female concerns and consumerism.

Following an election victory for the social democrats, Gabi Burgstaller became federal state governor on 28 April 2004. She was Salzburg State&#x27;s first female governor, the second female governor in Austrian history (after Waltraud Klasnic), and the first post-World War II governor of Salzburg State not from the ÖVP.

She won the 2009 Salzburg State elections with a 39.4% of the votes, losing a 6.0% and two seats, from 17 to 15.

After a major financial scandal striking the administration of Salzburg State she sustained a historic loss in the elections on 5 May 2013. SPÖ lost 15,56% and Burgstaller resigned. She was succeeded as governor by Wilfried Haslauer (ÖVP).

<text>Sports betting is the activity of predicting sports results and placing a wager on the outcome.

Sports bettors place their wagers either legally, through a bookmaker/sportsbook, or illegally through privately run enterprises referred to as &quot;bookies&quot;. The term &quot;book&quot; is a reference to the books used by wage brokers to track wagers, payouts, and debts. Many legal sportsbooks are found online, operated over the Internet from jurisdictions separate from the clients they serve, usually to get around various gambling laws (such as the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 in the United States) in select markets, such as Las Vegas, or on gambling cruises through self-serve kiosks. There are different types of legalized sports betting now such as game betting, parlays props and future bets. They take bets &quot;up-front&quot;, meaning the bettor must pay the sportsbook before placing the bet. Due to the nature of their business, illegal bookies can operate anywhere but only require money from losing bettors and do not require the wagered money up front, creating the possibility of debt to the bookie from the bettor. This creates a number of other criminal elements, thus furthering their illegality.

There have been a number of sports betting scandals, affecting the integrity of sports events through various acts including point shaving (players affecting the score by missing shots), spot-fixing (a player action is fixed), bad calls from officials at key moments, and overall match-fixing (the overall result of the event is fixed). Examples include the 1919 World Series, the alleged (and later admitted) illegal gambling of former baseball player Pete Rose, and former NBA referee Tim Donaghy.

== Types of sports bets in the United States ==

This is a list of sports bet types common to the United States.
* &quot;Moneyline bets&quot; do not have a spread or handicap, and require the chosen team to win the game outright. The favored team pays lower odds than does the underdog; thus, it acts mainly as an enticement to take the underdog for a better payout. Sometimes a bettor may couple this type of bet on the favored team to increase the payout of a parlay.
* &quot;Spread betting&quot; are wagers that are made against the spread. The spread, or line, is a number assigned by the bookmakers which handicaps one team and favors another when two teams play each other and one is perceived as being more likely to win. The favorite &quot;gives&quot; points from the final score, and the underdog &quot;takes&quot; points. This number can also be in increments of half-a-point (.5) even though very few sports have .5 point scoring (i.e., The Ryder Cup), to avoid the possibility of a tie.
:For example, before game 5 of the 2012 NBA Finals, the Miami Heat were expected to beat the Oklahoma City Thunder. The line read: Miami −3.5, Oklahoma City +3.5. To determine who wins against the spread, the line is either added or subtracted from a team&#x27;s final score. In the above example, if the bettor chose Miami, for him to win his bet, Miami would have to win the game by 4 points or more. If a bettor took Oklahoma City, they would have to win outright or lose by 3 points or fewer.
:If the final adjusted score is a tie, the bet is considered a push. The half point at the end is sometimes added to eliminate the possibility of a push. This is the most common type of bet in American sports betting.
*&quot;Total (Over/Under) bets&quot; are wagers made based on the total score between both teams. In an example, if an MLB game has a total of 10.5, an over bettor will want the combined total to be greater, and the opposite for a bettor taking the under. If the combined total is the same as the proposed total, the bet is a push. Most sports books refund all wagers on pushes, though a minority counts them as losses. 
*&quot;Proposition bets&quot; are wagers made on a very specific outcome of a match not related to the final score, usually of a statistical nature. Examples include predicting the number of goals a star player scores in an association football match, betting whether a player will run for a certain number of yards in an American football game, or wagering that a baseball player on one team will accumulate more hits than another player on the opposing team.
* &quot;Parlays&quot;. A parlay involves multiple bets that rewards successful bettors with a greater payout &quot;only&quot; if all bets in the parlay win. A parlay is at least two bets, but can be as many as the bookmaker will allow.
:The possible payout of the parlay is determined by the combined likelihood of all bets placed. A parlay of riskier bets (more underdogs) will pay greater than a parlay of more likely bets (more favorites). In a parlay, all bets need to win in order for the parlay to win. If one of the bets on a parlay loses, the whole parlay loses. In the event of a push, the pushed bet would be taken out of the parlay and the parlay would bump down to a set of odds without that bet.
:Parlays are very appealing to bettors because they pay out much more than the total winnings of their constituent straight bets. However, it is much more difficult to hit on a parlay than it is on a single wager. In the USA, parlays account for upward of 70% of each state&#x27;s total sportsbook revenue each month.
* &quot;Teasers&quot;. A teaser is a parlay that gives the bettor an advantage at a lower, but still positive, payout if successful.
:The bettor selects the sport(s), number of games, and number of points given.
:If the bettor takes two NBA games at +6.5 it will adjust the individual bets at that rate. So a bet on a 3-point underdog at +3 will become a bet at +9.5 points, and for favorites, it will change a 3-point favorite at −3 to +3.5 points.
:Although the rules to win his bet are the same as a parlay, he is paid less than a regular parlay due to the increased odds of winning.
* &quot;If bets&quot;. An if bet consists of at least two straight bets joined by an if clause, which determines the wager process. If the player&#x27;s first selection complies with the condition (clause), then the second selection will have action; if the second selection complies with the condition, then the third selection will have action and so on.
* &quot;Run line, puck line, or goal line bets&quot;. These are wagers offered as alternatives to money line wagers in baseball, hockey, or soccer, respectively. These bets are effectively point spread bets that have the same money line odds on either side of the wager (i.e., industry standard of −110 to −115). Sportsbooks will occasionally shift the moneyline by a few points on either side of these spread bets.
* &quot;Futures wagers&quot;. While all sports wagers are by definition on future events, bets listed as &quot;futures&quot; generally have a long-term horizon measured in weeks or months; for example, a bet that a certain NFL team will win the Super Bowl for the upcoming season. Such a bet can be made before the season starts in September for the best possible payout, but futures are typically available year-round, with payouts being reduced as the season progresses and it becomes easier to predict a champion. In this example, winning bets will not pay off until the conclusion of the Super Bowl in January or February (although many of the losing bets will be clear well before then and can be closed out by the book). Odds for such a bet generally are expressed in a ratio of units paid to unit wagered. The team wagered upon might be 50–1 (or +5000) to win the Super Bowl, which means that the bet will pay 50 times the amount wagered if the team does so. In general, most sportsbooks will prefer this type of wager due to the low win-probability, and also the longer period of time in which the house holds the player&#x27;s money while the bet is pending. For this same reason, most professional bettors do not prefer to place futures bets.
:A sportsbook may choose to buy in-play futures wagers at a price below the actual payout before a championship is decided if the potential payout is very high (and thus, damaging to the sportsbook due to the money that may be lost). The most recent example of this was when Leicester City pursued and went on to win the 2015/16 Premier League.
* &quot;Head-to-Head&quot;. In these bets, bettor predicts competitors results against each other and not on the overall result of the event. One example are Formula One races, where you bet on two or three drivers and their placement among the others. Sometimes you can also bet a &quot;tie&quot;, in which one or both drivers either have the same time, drop out, or get disqualified.
* &quot;Totalizators&quot;. In totalizators (sometimes called flexible-rate bets) the odds are changing in real-time according to the share of total exchange each of the possible outcomes have received taking into account the return rate of the bookmaker offering the bet. For example: If the bookmakers return percentage is 90%, 90% of the amount placed on the winning result will be given back to bettors and 10% goes to the bookmaker. Naturally the more money bet on a certain result, the smaller the odds on that outcome become. This is similar to parimutuel wagering in horse racing and dog racing.
* &quot;Half bets&quot;. A half (halftime) bet applies only to the score of the first or second half. This bet can be placed on the spread (line) or over/under. This can also be applied to a specific quarter in American football or basketball, a fewer number of innings in baseball, or a specific period in hockey.
* &quot;In-play betting&quot;. In-play betting, or live betting, is a fairly new feature offered by some online sports books that enables bettors to place new bets while a sporting event is in progress. In-play betting first appeared towards the end of the 1990s when some bookmakers would take bets over the telephone whilst a sports event was in progress, and has now evolved into a popular online service in many countries. The introduction of in-play betting has allowed bookmakers to increase the number of markets available to bet on during sports events, and gamblers are able to place bets based on many types of in-game activity during the matches. For example, in football matches, it is possible to bet in on in-play markets including the match result, half-time score, number of goals scored in the first or second half of the game, the number of yellow cards during the match, and the name of the goal scorers. The availability of a particular sport and in-play markets varies from bookmaker to bookmaker. In-play sports betting has structural characteristics that have changed the mechanics of gambling for sports bettors, as they can now place a larger number of bets during a single sports game (as opposed to a single bet on who is going to win). One of the most important differences between being able to place an in-running sports bet opposed to a pre-match bet is that the nature of the market has been turned what was previously a discontinuous form of gambling into a continuous one. The gambling study literature has suggested that in-play sports betting may offer more of a risk to problem gamblers because it allows the option for high-speed continuous betting and requires rapid and impulsive decisions in the absence of time for reflection. There are three different types of in-play sports betting products(cash out, Edit my Acca, and Edit my Bet).

:*&quot;Cash Out&quot;. Cash Out betting functionality lets the user of a betting website take profit early if their bet is coming in, or get some of their stake back if their bet is going against them—all before the event is over. Cash Out offers are optionally made by the website in real time on some current bets held by the user and are optionally taken by the user by clicking on a button on the webpage to &quot;Cash out&quot;. Cash Out sports betting functionality developed on digital betting websites after 2008 with the evolution of betting exchanges. It was later adopted by online sports books and suppliers of betting software. &#x27;Cash out&#x27; is offered to users by online sportsbook operators based on the profitability of offering the option to the user to divest their existing bet on an outcome and is sometimes available on singles and multiples. It is regularly offered on a wide range of sports, including American football, tennis, horse racing, basketball, and most other markets. You can Cash Out of bets pre-play, in-play, and between legs, before the outcome of the event. It has proved a key customer retention tool for sports book operators looking to capitalize on the use of mobile handsets while the bettor/user is also watching a given event.
:* &quot;Edit My Acca&quot;. This feature allows gamblers to remove selections from their accumulator after the bet has been placed and in some instances after the selected event has started. The betting slip is then revised to feature the amended selections and a new potential return amount. This can be done online or via a mobile device.
:* &quot;Edit My Bet&quot;. The &quot;edit bet&quot; feature can be used by gamblers to &quot;unsettle straight accumulators&quot; before matches have started or whilst they are in-play. The feature can also be used for to swap single bets for new bets, and the gambler is given a new bet selection valued at the bookie&#x27;s cash out price to reflect live market/game odds for the original bet.

== Bookmaking ==

The bookmaker functions as a market maker for sports wagers, most of which have a binary outcome: a team either wins or loses. The bookmaker accepts both wagers, and maintains a spread (the vigorish) which will ensure a profit regardless of the outcome of the wager. The Federal Wire Act of 1961 was an attempt by the US government to prevent illegal bookmaking. However, this Act does not apply to other types of online gambling. The Supreme Court has not ruled on the meaning of the Federal Wire Act as it pertains to online gambling.

Bookmakers usually hold an 11–10 advantage over their customers—for small wagers it is closer to a 6–5 advantage—so the bookmaker will most likely survive over the long term. Successful bookmakers must be able to withstand a large short term loss. (Boyd, 1981)

Many of the leading gambling bookmakers from the 1930s to the 1960s got their start during the prohibition era of the 1920s. They were often descendants of the influx of immigrants coming into the US at this time. Although the common stereotype is that these bookies were of Italian descent, many leading bookies were of eastern European ancestry.

== Odds ==
Odds for different outcomes in single bet are presented either in European format (decimal odds), UK format (fractional odds), or American format (money line odds). European format (decimal odds) are used in continental Europe, Canada, and Australia. They are the ratio of the full payout to the stake, in a decimal format. Decimal odds of 2.00 are an even bet. UK format (fractional odds) are used by British bookmakers. They are the ratio of the amount won to the stake – the solidus &quot;/&quot; is pronounced &quot;to&quot;; for example, 7/1 is &quot;seven to one&quot;. Fractional odds of 1/1 are an even bet. US format odds are the amount won on a 100 stake when positive, and the stake needed to win 100 when negative. US odds of 100 are an even bet.

In Asian betting markets, other frequently used formats for expressing odds include Hong Kong, Malaysian, and Indonesian-style odds formats. Odds are also quite often expressed in terms of &quot;implied probability&quot;, which corresponds to the probability with which the event in question would need to occur for the bet to be a break-even proposition (on the average).

Many online tools also exist for automated conversion between these odds formats.

In setting odds, the bookmaker is subject to a number of limitations:
* The probability implied by the odds should be greater than the true probability for each possible outcome to guarantee positive expected profit.
* If the wagers on each outcome are made in ratio to the implied odds, then the bookmaker is guaranteed a profit (balanced book).

== Legality ==

In many countries, bookmaking (the profession of accepting sports wagers) is regulated but not criminalized.

The opinions of betting from sport authorities are mixed. The United States National Football League was previously fully against any sort of legalization of sports betting prior to the late 2010s, strongly protesting it as to not bring corruption into the game. On the other hand, the CEO of the International Cricket Council believe sports betting, in particular in India, should be legalized to curb illegal bookies where match fixing has occurred from nontransparent bookmakers. According to the Law Commission of India, all forms of gambling are illegal. Online sports betting is a gray area and is not banned by any particular law in the Indian legal system. That is because specific provisions distinguish between games of chance and games of skill.

=== United States ===

In the United States, it was previously illegal under the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (PASPA) for states to authorize legal sports betting, hence making it effectively illegal. The states of Delaware, Montana, Nevada, and Oregon—which had pre-existing sports lotteries and sports betting frameworks, were grandfathered in and exempted from the effects of the Act. PASPA was struck down by the Supreme Court in &quot;Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association&quot; in 2018, paving the way for other states to legalize sports betting.

In May 2020, it was reported that since the Supreme Court&#x27;s PASPA decision, over $20 billion had been spent on sports betting in the United States. As of January 2024, 37 states, Washington, D.C., and the territory of Puerto Rico have operational legalized sports betting, while North Carolina has legalized it though it sports betting operations will begin later in 2024. 30 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico have also legalized online sports betting, though in 8 states that have legalized sports betting, betting can only occur through legal physical sportsbooks.

=== European Union ===
In the European Union (EU), sports betting legality varies among member states. Generally, the EU does not criminalize sports betting, but requires operators to obtain specific licenses within individual countries. Key directives, such as the Services Directive and consumer protection laws, influence the regulatory landscape. Each EU country sets its rules, impacting online and offline betting. Certain countries have recently updated regulations (such as the GlüStV 2021 in Germany), while the EU works to harmonize diverse laws.

=== Rest of the world ===
Outside the EU, regions approach sports betting differently. In Asia, some countries allow licensed betting while illegal markets thrive in others. Africa sees a growing industry with varying regulations. Australia boasts a well-regulated betting environment focusing on online and offline options. Latin America, led by countries like Colombia, is embracing regulated online markets. Meanwhile, the Middle East, including nations like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, strictly prohibits all gambling activities, including sports betting, due to cultural and religious reasons.

==American sports league positions==
The positions of the four major American sports leagues (representing American football, baseball, basketball, and ice hockey) have become more complex since their decision to embrace daily fantasy sports (DFS) in 2014, which are described by those within the industry as &quot;almost identical to a casino&quot; in nature. With the contention by critics that such activities blur the lines between gambling and fantasy sports, the endorsement of all four major sports leagues and many individual franchises provided a marked contrast to their positions on betting. Professional sports leagues updated their positions again on May 14, 2018, when the Supreme Court of the United States overturned the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (PASPA).

=== NBA ===
While the National Basketball Association (NBA) was once active in preventing sports betting law relaxation, current NBA Commissioner Adam Silver became the first major sports leader to break from previous administrative opposition to gambling. In 2014 he stated in a &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed, &quot;I believe that sports betting should be brought out of the underground and into the sunlight where it can be appropriately monitored and regulated.&quot; In 2017, with support for legalization growing, he confirmed his belief that &quot;legalized sports betting is inevitable&quot;.

Silver released the following statement following the Supreme Court&#x27;s overturning of PASPA: &quot;Today&#x27;s decision by the Supreme Court opens the door for states to pass laws legalizing sports betting. We remain in favor of a federal framework that would provide a uniform approach to sports gambling in states that choose to permit it, but we will remain active in ongoing discussions with state legislatures. Regardless of the particulars of any future sports betting law, the integrity of our game remains our highest priority.&quot;

=== MLB ===
Major League Baseball (MLB) Commissioner Rob Manfred has also advocated the league changing its stance on sports betting, with both Manfred and Silver noting that the scale of illegal sports betting makes opposition to betting meaningless. He also stated a willingness to &quot;try to shape&quot; any future legislation at federal level. This was noted as a marked contrast to former Commissioner of the MLB Bud Selig, with Manfred going beyond tacit approval and stating, &quot;There is this buzz out there in terms of people feeling that there may be an opportunity here for additional legalized sports betting.&quot;

MLB released the following statement when the Supreme Court overturned PASPA: &quot;Today&#x27;s decision by the United States Supreme Court will have profound effects on Major League Baseball. As each state considers whether to allow sports betting, we will continue to seek the proper protections for our sport, in partnership with other professional sports. Our most important priority is protecting the integrity of our games. We will continue to support legislation that creates air-tight coordination and partnerships between the state, the casino operators and the governing bodies in sports toward that goal.&quot;

In April 2022, league-owned television channel MLB Network launched &quot;Pregame Spread&quot;, a weekday afternoon show hosted by Matt Vasgersian dedicated to analysis of betting lines and other aspects of sports gambling.

=== NFL ===
The National Football League (NFL) remains the only sports league to maintain public opposition to sports betting, however critics have noted that with the move of the Oakland Raiders to Las Vegas in 2019, the NFL has positioned itself for legalization, while simultaneously contradicting its long-held position that sports betting in NFL markets would lead to potential match-fixing. Commissioner Roger Goodell agreed with Manfred in a July 2017 seminar that betting on in-game events, as opposed to the outcome of games, was a more palatable form of sports betting.

Like the NBA and MLB, the NFL issued a statement on May 14, 2018. It emphasized the league&#x27;s commitment to protecting the integrity of the game: &quot;The NFL&#x27;s long-standing and unwavering commitment to protecting the integrity of our game remains absolute.&quot; Moreover, the NFL called on Congress to craft a Federal framework for regulated sports betting. &quot;Congress has long recognized the potential harms posed by sports betting to the integrity of sporting contests and the public confidence in these events. Given that history, we intend to call on Congress again, this time to enact a core regulatory framework for legalized sports betting.&quot;

=== NHL ===
The National Hockey League (NHL) has not stated a public position for or against sports betting, with Commissioner Gary Bettman noting that they are smaller than the NBA and NFL and less vulnerable to negative issues as a result. The NHL was the first major professional league to place a team in Nevada, when the expansion Vegas Golden Knights took the ice in 2017: since then the league has signed sponsorship agreements with William Hill and MGM Resorts International that include betting partnerships and access to in-play data. Other clubs in states with legal sports gambling, such as the New Jersey Devils and Philadelphia Flyers, also have similar sponsorships with bookmakers.

Following other US professional sports leagues, the NHL acknowledged the Supreme Court&#x27;s PASPA decision with an internal review of its policies. &quot;The Supreme Court&#x27;s decision today paves the way to an entirely different landscape – one in which we have not previously operated. We will review our current practices and policies and decide whether adjustments are needed, and if so, what those adjustments will look like. It&#x27;s important to emphasize that the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision has no immediate impact on existing League rules relating to sports wagering, and particularly, wagering involving NHL games.&quot;

=== Other leagues ===
Major League Soccer (MLS) the top soccer league in the United States and Canada has expressed sports betting as a possible way to gain popularity. Commissioner Don Garber has stated about sports gambling, &quot;We have a project going on now to really dig in deeply and understand it. I&#x27;ll join the chorus of saying it&#x27;s time to bring it out of the dark ages. We&#x27;re doing what we can to figure out how to manage that effectively.&quot;

The Alliance of American Football and XFL have both publicly endorsed gambling on their games, with the AAF securing a partnership with MGM Resorts International and the XFL partnering with DraftKings.

=== Advocacy and lobbying ===
The American Gaming Association stated in June 2017, that a coalition will advocate for the repeal of the United States&#x27; sports betting ban.

In February 2018, a lobbying document surfaced advocating a new position held by the NBA and MLB – that sports leagues should be financially compensated for betting activity.

==Position of the American National Collegiate Athletic Association ==

Perhaps the most extreme ban on sports betting is imposed by the NCAA, the main governing body for U.S. college sports. The NCAA reified their position in the wake of various betting scandals, including two high-profile men&#x27;s basketball episodes in the 1990s—the 1992 University of Nevada, Las Vegas and 1994 Arizona State University point shaving scandals. As states began legalizing sports betting in the late 2010s, the NCAA signaled a shift in tone. In 2017, then-NCAA President Mark Emmert talked about Las Vegas possibly hosting the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament in the future.

Emmert acknowledged the Supreme Court&#x27;s overturn of PASPA on May 14, 2018, restating the NCAA&#x27;s strong commitment to competition and its student-athletes. &quot;Our highest priorities in any conversation about sports wagering are maintaining the integrity of competition and student-athlete well-being.&quot; Emmert also emphasized the importance of proper federal regulation. &quot;While we recognize the critical role of state governments, strong federal standards are necessary to safeguard the integrity of college sports and the athletes who play these games at all levels.&quot;

Three days after the Supreme Court ruling, the NCAA suspended its policy prohibiting championship events from being held in states with legal sports betting. The policy was fully rescinded in May 2019. In October 2020, Las Vegas was awarded the West Regional of the 2023 Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament; the Frozen Four, the final phase of the Division I men&#x27;s hockey tournament, in 2026; and the men&#x27;s basketball Final Four in 2028.

As of the 2024–25 school year, the official manuals for all three NCAA divisions still expressly ban a member institution&#x27;s athletic department staff, non-athletic staff with responsibilities related to athletic activities, athletic conference staff, and student athletes from knowingly participating in sports wagering activities.

This ban covers all competitions, whether intercollegiate, amateur, or professional, as well as team practices, in any sport in which the NCAA conducts a championship, plus Division I FBS football (whose championships have never been operated by the NCAA) and all sports within the scope of the NCAA Emerging Sports for Women program. The only exception is traditional wagers between institutions, most commonly associated with rivalries or bowl games; according to the NCAA, &quot;items wagered must be representative of the involved institutions or the states in which they are located&quot;.

The NCAA maintains that &quot;Sports wagering has the potential to undermine the integrity of sports contests and jeopardizes the well-being of student-athletes and the intercollegiate athletics community. It also demeans the competition and competitors alike by spreading a message that is contrary to the purpose and meaning of &#x27;sport.&#x27;&quot;

==Positions of other sports leagues and governing bodies==

=== English football ===

The Football Association, the governing body for association football in England, has imposed football betting bans on all individuals involved in the sport—players, managers, match officials, and club staff. The scope of these bans varies based on level of the English football pyramid.

The following individuals are banned from betting on any football-related matter worldwide, or providing inside information to any individual who can reasonably be assumed to use said information for betting purposes:
* All players, managers, and club staff associated with any club occupying any of the top eight levels of the men&#x27;s league system (the Premier League, English Football League, and the top four levels of the National League system) or the top two levels of the women&#x27;s league system (the Women&#x27;s Super League and Women&#x27;s Championship).
* All match officials, plus coaches and assessors thereof, who operate at Level 3 or above in the FA&#x27;s referee classification system.

Individuals who are associated at clubs at lower levels of the men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s league systems, plus match officials at FA Level 4 or below, are only banned with respect to the match or competition in which they are involved or can influence, and also to the league in which they participate.

All individuals are banned from advertising or promoting any football betting activity in which FA regulations prohibit them from engaging. This, however, only applies to individuals in their personal capacities. For example, if a club is sponsored by a betting company and said company places its logo on the club&#x27;s kit, the team&#x27;s players are not in violation of the betting rules.

=== International baseball and softball ===
The World Baseball Softball Confederation, the international governing body for baseball and softball, has betting rules similar to those of Major League Baseball. Participants in any WBSC-sanctioned event are banned from betting on the following:
* Any WBSC competition in which they are participating.
* Any event in the participant&#x27;s sport, even if not directly governed by WBSC. For example:
** An individual involved with a national baseball team cannot bet on a Major League Baseball game.
** However, someone involved solely with a national softball team can bet on an MLB game.
* Any event in any multisport competition in which an individual is participating. For example, an Olympic baseball or softball player cannot bet on any Olympic event taking place at that specific Summer Olympics.
The WBSC statutes define &quot;participant&quot; as any player, team staff member (including coaches/managers), tournament official (such as umpires and official scorers), or anyone in an ownership, executive, or staff role within any entity that organizes or promotes a WBSC-sanctioned event.

The betting ban, as in the case of The FA&#x27;s rules outlined above, also extends to providing inside information that the tipper could reasonably believe will be used to bet on a WBSC event.

=== Cricket ===
The International Cricket Council imposes a blanket ban on what it calls &quot;corrupt conduct&quot; by anyone it defines as a &quot;participant&quot;.

Under the ICC anti-corruption statutes, a &quot;participant&quot; is defined as:
* Anyone who has been selected to play in any international or domestic match that falls under the jurisdiction of any national cricket federation within the previous 24 months (defined by the ICC as a &quot;player&quot;).
* Anyone who &quot;is employed by, represents or is otherwise affiliated to&quot; any international or domestic team falling under the jurisdiction of any national federation (defined by the ICC as &quot;player support personnel&quot;). Those who have served in such a role in the past remain subject to the code for 24 months after the end of their term.
* Any cricketer or player support staffer who is currently under a ban imposed for violations of the ICC anti-corruption code, or the equivalent code of any national federation.
* Any ICC administrative official, match referee, pitch curator (groundskeeper), player agent, umpire, or umpire support staffer.

The ICC shares anti-corruption jurisdiction with national cricket federations, all of which have anti-corruption rules substantially identical to those of the ICC. The ICC has elaborate mechanisms for determining whether it or a national federation will take action under the relevant anti-corruption code. In general, the ICC has either exclusive or priority jurisdiction over international matches, while national federations have responsibility for actions relating only to domestic matches.

The ICC code bans the following activities with regard to any international match, whether or not the participant had any involvement in said match, or any possible means of influencing the outcome:
* Any attempted or actual match fixing, including spot-fixing (i.e., manipulating a specific event within a match).
** However, manipulation of international matches strictly for strategic or tactical reasons is specifically excluded from the anti-corruption code. Such actions instead constitute violations of the ICC&#x27;s code of conduct.
* Seeking, offering, accepting, or agreeing to accept a bribe to fix a match or event within a match.
* Betting on any match, or on any event within a match. Soliciting such a bet is also banned.
* Misuse of inside information that could reasonably be used for betting purposes.
* Providing any benefits for the purpose of violating the code.
* Failing to report any attempted violation of the code by another individual, once the subject has become aware of it.

== Famous betting scandals ==
In 1919, the Chicago White Sox faced the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series. This series would go down as one of the biggest sports scandals of all time. As the story goes, professional gambler Joseph Sullivan paid eight members of the White Sox (Oscar Felsch, Arnold Gandil, Shoeless Joe Jackson, Fred McMullin, Charles Risberg, George Weaver, and Claude Williams) around 10,000 dollars each to fix the World Series. All eight players were banned from playing professional baseball for the rest of their lives. Pete Rose, the all-time MLB leader in hits, was similarly banned from baseball in 1989 for betting on games while he was an MLB manager.

The rule against gambling in baseball is known as &quot;Rule 21&quot;, which is publicly posted on dugout walls and states: &quot;Any player, umpire, or club or league official or employee, who shall bet any sum whatsoever on any baseball game in connection with which the bettor has a duty to perform shall be declared permanently ineligible.&quot; People permanently banned from Major League Baseball are also forever banned from entry into the Baseball Hall of Fame, although most such people have been reinstated a few years later by a later Commissioner of Baseball. For instance, while Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays were both banned from baseball in 1983 after taking jobs as casino greeters, they were reinstated two years later. 

A 1906 betting scandal between the Massillon Tigers and Canton Bulldogs, two of the top teams in professional American football in the early 1900s, led to the demise of &quot;big-money&quot; professional football for several years. Modern research has suggested that the claims of betting were unsubstantiated.

On December 7, 1980, the San Francisco 49ers overcame a halftime deficit of 28 points in what became the greatest regular season comeback victory in NFL regular season history. By the beginning of the third quarter, notorious Vegas bookmaker Frank Rosenthal received forfeiture notices from 246 San Francisco bettors totaling more than $25,000 in premature winnings. Rosenthal was able to retain these winnings despite the outcome of the game due to gambling regulations previously established by the NAGRA.

The &quot;Cronje Affair&quot; was an India-South Africa Cricket match fixing scandal that went public in 2000. It began in 1996 when the-then captain of the South African national cricket team, Hansie Cronje, was convinced by Mukesh &quot;John&quot; Gupta, an Indian bookmaker, to throw a match during a Test in Kanpur, India. The scheme was discovered when Delhi police recorded illegal dealings between Indian bookmaker Sanjay Chawla and Cronje. According to the &quot;Telegraph&quot; in 2010, Cronje was paid off a total of £65,000 from Gupta.

Corruption in tennis has been long considered as issue. In 2011, the former world No. 55 Austrian tennis player, Daniel Köllerer, became the first tennis player to be banned for life for attempting to fix matches. The violations were outstanding between October 2009 and July 2010 after The Tennis Integrity Units had launched an investigation on behalf of the International Tennis Federation and the ATP and WTA tours. In 2004 and 2006, Koellerer was banned for six months due to his bad behavior. In addition, in August 2010, he facilitated betting by placing odds for matches and had links for placing bets.

== Machine learning in sports betting ==
Machine learning models can make predictions in real time based on data from numerous disparate sources, such as player performance, weather, fan sentiment, etc. Some models have shown accuracy slightly higher than domain experts.

<doc id="1328079" wikidata="Q1628058" url="?curid=1328079" title="Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 2501">
<text>Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 2501 was a DC-4 operating its daily transcontinental service between New York City and Seattle when it disappeared on the night of June 23, 1950. The flight was carrying 55 passengers and three crew members; the loss of all 58 aboard made it the deadliest commercial airliner accident in America at the time.

The aircraft was at approximately over Lake Michigan, NNW of Benton Harbor, Michigan, when flight controllers lost radio contact with it soon after the pilot had requested a descent to . Witnesses reported hearing engine sputtering noises and a flash of light after the last radio transmission. A widespread search was commenced including using sonar and dragging the bottom of Lake Michigan with trawlers, but to no avail. Considerable light debris, upholstery, and human body fragments were found floating on the surface, but divers were unable to locate the plane&#x27;s wreckage.

== Cause ==
It is known that Flight 2501 was entering a squall line and turbulence, but since the plane&#x27;s wreckage underwater was not found, the cause of the crash was never determined. There is output from a hindcast simulation of the possible weather conditions during the event. The incident was reported on June 25 by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as follows:

== Aftermath ==

The missing airliner is the subject of an annual search by Michigan Shipwreck Research Associates (MSRA), a Michigan-based non-profit organization. The search effort began in 2004 as a joint venture between author and explorer Clive Cussler and the MSRA. Cussler ended his involvement in 2013, but sent his side-scan sonar operator back to Michigan in 2015, 2016, and 2017 to follow some leads discovered by MSRA.

In September 2008, MSRA affiliate Chriss Lyon, investigating the crash of Flight 2501, found an unmarked grave that contains the remains of some of the 58 victims. Valerie van Heest, MSRA co-director and author of the book &quot;Fatal Crossing&quot;, says human remains from the June 1950 crash into Lake Michigan washed ashore and were buried in a mass grave. She claims they were buried in a St. Joseph–area cemetery without the knowledge of the victims&#x27; families, and the grave was never marked. In a 2008 ceremony at the cemetery with 58 family members of Flight 2501, a large black granite marker, donated by Filbrandt Family Funeral Home, was placed in Riverview Cemetery that now lists the names of the 58 and the words &quot;In Memory of Northwest Flight 2501, June 23, 1950. Gone but Never Forgotten.&quot;

Another mass burial site was discovered in 2015 at Lakeview Cemetery in South Haven. The site had long been unmarked, until cemetery sexton Mary Ann Frazier and her mother, Beverly Smith, working on a genealogy project, found it. The women contacted van Heest and together they planned a memorial service before the 65th anniversary. Filbrandt organized the service, which was led by Pastor Robert Linstrom. St. Joe Monument Works donated a marker for the gravesite; it was delivered to the cemetery a few days before the 65th anniversary of the crash. On June 24, 2015, a remembrance service was held at the grave site. South Haven Mayor Robert Burr, along with Craig Rich from the MSRA, read off all of the 58 victims&#x27; names. After each name was read, a bell was rung.

The crash was featured on an episode of the Discovery Channel program &quot;Expedition Unknown&quot; (season 8, episode 2), which aired on February 12, 2020.

The crash was featured on an episode of the History Channel program &quot;The Unbelievable with Dan Aykroyd&quot; (season 1, episode 1), which aired on December 1, 2023.

<doc id="1328092" wikidata="Q7595746" url="?curid=1328092" title="Stabilizers (band)">
<text>Stabilizers were an American pop/rock duo from Erie, Pennsylvania, founded in the mid-1980s by musicians Dave Christenson (lead vocals) and England-born Rich Nevens (guitars and occasional keyboards). The duo experienced moderate national success upon the release of their lone full-length album. They are perhaps best remembered for their 1986/87 single, “One Simple Thing”.

==History==

In the early 1980s, Christenson was the bassist/singer in the local Erie band Prophecy, which also included keyboardist John Schaaf, who later joined Stabilizers’ Erie-based live band. Prophecy toured across Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New York, scoring a local hit with “Another American Rock &#x27;N Roll Story”. The band broke up by design when Schaaf left for law school and drummer Brad Vargo left for medical school, playing their final show in 1984; Christenson connected with Nevens later that year to form Stabilizers, writing and recording the group&#x27;s songs. George Hazuda was added on drums for live performances, with other members soon joining the group, including Schaaf on keyboards and saxophone. “The Stabilizers” had been the name of Nevens’ previous band, during his time in school at his alma mater, Penn State, and he reappropriated the moniker for the new group. After continuing to tour the Pennsylvania area and recording original compositions on a 4-track recorder, they were signed to Columbia Records in 1985, releasing &quot;Tyranny&quot;, their first and only album, the following year.

The first single from &quot;Tyranny,&quot; “One Simple Thing”, peaked at #21 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in 1986 and #93 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1987, helped by the band&#x27;s performance of the song on &quot;American Bandstand&quot;. The song peaked at #100 in Australia. Two music videos were released to promote the album: “One Simple Thing”, directed by David Fincher, who would go on to greater success directing the feature films &quot;Alien 3&quot;, &quot;Se7en&quot;, and &quot;Fight Club&quot;; and “Tyranny”, directed by David Hogan. The “Tyranny” single failed to chart, and for the next five years, Stabilizers disappeared from view.

Following the acquisition of Columbia Records by Sony, Stabilizers signed a new deal with MCA Records, but did not initially release any material. However, in 1991, an unreleased track from the MCA Records sessions, “Maybe This Time”, was included in the film &quot;If Looks Could Kill&quot; and its soundtrack album.

Dave Christenson and Rich Nevens remained in fairly steady contact after the dissolution of the band.

David D. Christenson (born on March 15, 1963, in Erie, Pennsylvania) died in Seattle, Washington on December 13, 2017, after a three-year battle with lung cancer. He was 54 and was survived by his wife and two sons.

<text>Manil Suri (born July 1959) is an Indian-American mathematician and writer of a trilogy of novels all named for Hindu gods. His first novel, &quot;The Death of Vishnu&quot; (2001), which was long-listed for the 2001 Booker Prize, short-listed for the 2002 PEN/Faulkner Award and won the Barnes &amp; Noble Discover Prize that year. Since then, he has published two more novels, &quot;The Age of Shiva&quot; (2008) and &quot;The City of Devi&quot; (2013), completing the trilogy.

==Biography==
Suri was born in Bombay, the son of R.L. Suri, a Bollywood music director, and Prem Suri, a schoolteacher. He attended the University of Bombay before moving to the United States, where he attended Carnegie Mellon University. He received a Ph.D. in mathematics in 1983, and became a mathematics professor at University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Suri began writing short stories in the 1980s during his spare time, but none were published. In 1995 he began writing &quot;The Death of Vishnu&quot;, a novel about social and religious tensions in India taking place in an apartment building in contemporary Mumbai. An excerpt, &quot;The Seven Circles&quot;, appeared in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and the novel was published in 2001, becoming an international bestseller. Suri received a six-figure advance as a result of a bidding war between publishing houses, ultimately won by W.W. Norton. In 2002, Suri won the PEN/Robert W. Bingham Prize for &quot;The Death of Vishnu&quot;. His second novel, &quot;The Age of Shiva&quot; (2008), was listed as one of the best books of the decade by About.com. His third novel, &quot;The City of Devi&quot; (2013), was ranked number 12 in the &quot;50 essential works of LGBT fiction&quot; list by Flavorwire.

Suri was planning to write a trilogy of novels with titles featuring the three Hindu gods Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. The second book in the trilogy, &quot;The Age of Shiva&quot;, was published in 2008, with &quot;The Birth of Brahma&quot; slated as the third. This third novel ended up being based on Devi (the Mother Goddess) instead, with the title &quot;The City of Devi.&quot;

In December 2013, Suri won the &quot;Bad Sex in Fiction&quot; prize for the climactic sex scene in &quot;The City of Devi&quot;. However, a reviewer in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; praised the sex writing in the book, as did a reviewer in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, who also commented that Suri &quot;admirably&quot; handles the strands of &quot;sex, mythology and global politics&quot;.

Suri has written an essay about growing up gay in India in the journal Granta and has published op-eds about gay issues in the New York Times and the Washington Post.

<text>Bitburg (; ; ) is a city in Germany, in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate approximately 25 km (16 mi.) northwest of Trier and 50 km (31 mi.) northeast of Luxembourg city. The American Spangdahlem Air Base is nearby.

==History==
The city&#x27;s name derives from its Celtic toponym, &quot;Beda&quot;.

Bitburg originated approximately 2,000 years ago as a stopover for traffic from Lyon through Metz and Trier to Cologne. The first name mentioned was &quot;Vicus Beda&quot;. Emperor Constantine the Great expanded the settlement to a road castle around 330, the central part of which forms the town centre today. Bitburg is first documented only after the end of the Roman Empire around 715 as &quot;castrum bedense&quot;. It subsequently became part of Franconia.

The first mention of Bitburg in historic annals occurred in connection with the signing in 1239 of the Trier-Luxembourg Treaty between Archbishop Theoderich II of Trier and Countess Ermesinde II of Luxemburg, under which the town came under the archbishopric&#x27;s protection. Bitburg received a town charter in 1262 from Count Henry V of Luxembourg.

In 1443, Bitburg came under the sway of the Duchy of Burgundy, then in 1506 was acquired by the Austrian Netherlands, which controlled most of modern Belgium. In 1794 the city came under French administration, and in 1798 became part of the newly created &quot;Département des Forêts&quot;. This led to a short lived economic upturn, and Bitburg received among other things a court and a land registry.

In 1815, under agreements at the Congress of Vienna following the final defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte, Bitburg was, after having been a part of the Duchy of Luxembourg for centuries, transferred to the Kingdom of Prussia, where until 1822 it belonged administratively to the province of Lower Rhine, and afterwards to the Rhine province. With the unification of Germany under Prussian dominance in 1871, Bitburg became part of the German Empire, and after World War I the Weimar Republic of Germany.

In the interwar years, Bitburg, like most of the Eifel region, was impoverished and comparatively backward. Economic growth began after the Nazi Seizure of Power and the Nazi regime&#x27;s introduction of employment-boosting public works projects, including infrastructure for war, particularly the Westwall; new armed forces barracks; and the development of the Nims-Sauer Valley railway. It is said that the building now used as the post office at Bitburg Annex (what is left of Bitburg Air Base) was the headquarters for Adolf Hitler when he was in the city.

In late December 1944, Bitburg was 85 percent destroyed by Allied bombing attacks, and later officially designated by the U.S. military as a &quot;dead city.&quot; Subsequently, the town was occupied by Luxembourg soldiers, who were replaced by French forces in 1955.

In 1952 a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) base was opened at Bitburg by the U.S. Air Force. At the end of the 1980s, French troops were withdrawn and NATO took over the former French barracks. After the First Gulf War most of the USAF forces were moved to the larger Spangdahlem Air Base, about 12 km east of Bitburg. In 1994, NATO turned the Bitburg Air Base over to the city, which devoted it to public works projects. The Nims-Sauer Valley railway was abandoned step by step, beginning in 1969. Parts of it were converted into a bicycle path (&quot;Radweg&quot;).

In 1985, Bitburg came to international attention due to a ceremonial visit by U.S. President Ronald Reagan and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to the nearby Kolmeshöhe Military Cemetery – which among its 2,000 graves included those of 49 members of the Waffen-SS.

==Economics and industry==

The most widely known Bitburg enterprise, and landmark of the city, is the Bitburger brewery. Its Pilsener-style lager beer ranks No. 3 among Germany&#x27;s best selling beers, with sales of 3.86 million hectolitres (in 2008).

In 1995, the former NATO base was designated the Bitburg Airfield Trade Area, providing commercial development district where 180 enterprises have established themselves.

==Transport==

Bitburg-Erdorf station is part of the Eifel line (KBS 474). Trains that pass through include:
*The Eifel Mosel express (RE 12) – Cologne, Euskirchen, Gerolstein, Trier
* The Eifel line (RB 83) – Gerolstein, Trier

==Points of interest==

The Regional Museum of Bitburg-Prüm is housed in a former agricultural school. It contains numerous artifacts of the history of Bitburg and the Eifel Region in general.

In the cultural centre &quot;Haus Beda&quot; are exhibited works of the Düsseldorf painter Fritz von Wille (1860–1941), the Eifel&#x27;s most widely known artist. More than 100 paintings are on display, including &quot;Die blaue Blume&quot;, &quot;Mosenberg&quot;, &quot;Burg Reifferscheid im Winter&quot; and &quot;Ein klarer Tag&quot;.

Bitburg is partnered or twinned with:
* Arlon, Belgium since 1965
* Bad Köstritz (Thuringia), Germany since 1992
* Diekirch, Luxembourg since 1962
* Rethel, France since 1965
* Shelbyville, Kentucky (USA) since 1962

<text>Neutrino oscillation is a quantum mechanical phenomenon in which a neutrino created with a specific lepton family number (&quot;lepton flavor&quot;: electron, muon, or tau) can later be measured to have a different lepton family number. The probability of measuring a particular flavor for a neutrino varies between three known states, as it propagates through space.

First predicted by Bruno Pontecorvo in 1957, neutrino oscillation has since been observed by a multitude of experiments in several different contexts. Most notably, the existence of neutrino oscillation resolved the long-standing solar neutrino problem.

Neutrino oscillation is of great theoretical and experimental interest, as the precise properties of the process can shed light on several properties of the neutrino. In particular, it implies that the neutrino has a non-zero mass outside the Einstein-Cartan torsion, which requires a modification to the Standard Model of particle physics. The experimental discovery of neutrino oscillation, and thus neutrino mass, by the Super-Kamiokande Observatory and the Sudbury Neutrino Observatories was recognized with the 2015 Nobel Prize for Physics.

==Observations==
A great deal of evidence for neutrino oscillation has been collected from many sources, over a wide range of neutrino energies and with many different detector technologies. The 2015 Nobel Prize in Physics was shared by Takaaki Kajita and Arthur B. McDonald for their early pioneering observations of these oscillations.

Neutrino oscillation is a function of the ratio, where is the distance traveled and is the neutrino&#x27;s energy. (Details in below.) All available neutrino sources produce a range of energies, and oscillation is measured at a fixed distance for neutrinos of varying energy. The limiting factor in measurements is the accuracy with which the energy of each observed neutrino can be measured. Because current detectors have energy uncertainties of a few percent, it is satisfactory to know the distance to within 1%.

===Solar neutrino oscillation===
The first experiment that detected the effects of neutrino oscillation was Ray Davis&#x27; Homestake experiment in the late 1960s, in which he observed a deficit in the flux of solar neutrinos with respect to the prediction of the Standard Solar Model, using a chlorine-based detector. This gave rise to the solar neutrino problem. Many subsequent radiochemical and water Cherenkov detectors confirmed the deficit, but neutrino oscillation was not conclusively identified as the source of the deficit until the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory provided clear evidence of neutrino flavor change in 2001.

Solar neutrinos have energies below 20 MeV. At energies above 5 MeV, solar neutrino oscillation actually takes place in the Sun through a resonance known as the MSW effect, a different process from the vacuum oscillation described later in this article.

===Atmospheric neutrino oscillation===
Following the theories that were proposed in the 1970s suggesting unification of electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces, a few experiments on proton decay followed in the 1980s. Large detectors such as IMB, MACRO, and Kamiokande II have observed a deficit in the ratio of the flux of muon to electron flavor atmospheric neutrinos (see &quot;muon decay&quot;). The Super-Kamiokande experiment provided a very precise measurement of neutrino oscillation in an energy range of hundreds of MeV to a few TeV, and with a baseline of the diameter of the Earth; the first experimental evidence for atmospheric neutrino oscillations was announced in 1998.

===Reactor neutrino oscillation===

Many experiments have searched for oscillation of electron anti-neutrinos produced in nuclear reactors. No oscillations were found until a detector was installed at a distance 1–2 km. Such oscillations give the value of the parameter . Neutrinos produced in nuclear reactors have energies similar to solar neutrinos, of around a few MeV. The baselines of these experiments have ranged from tens of meters to over 100 km (parameter ). Mikaelyan and Sinev proposed to use two identical detectors to cancel systematic uncertainties in reactor experiment to measure the parameter .

In December 2011, the Double Chooz experiment found that Then, in 2012, the Daya Bay experiment found thatwith a significance of These results have since been confirmed by RENO.

===Beam neutrino oscillation===
Neutrino beams produced at a particle accelerator offer the greatest control over the neutrinos being studied. Many experiments have taken place that study the same oscillations as in atmospheric neutrino oscillation using neutrinos with a few GeV of energy and several-hundred-km baselines. The MINOS, K2K, and Super-K experiments have all independently observed muon neutrino disappearance over such long baselines.

Data from the LSND experiment appear to be in conflict with the oscillation parameters measured in other experiments. Results from the MiniBooNE appeared in Spring 2007 and contradicted the results from LSND, although they could support the existence of a fourth neutrino type, the sterile neutrino.

In 2010, the INFN and CERN announced the observation of a tauon particle in a muon neutrino beam in the OPERA detector located at Gran Sasso, 730 km away from the source in Geneva.

T2K, using a neutrino beam directed through 295 km of earth and the Super-Kamiokande detector, measured a non-zero value for the parameter  in a neutrino beam. NOνA, using the same beam as MINOS with a baseline of 810 km, is sensitive to the same.

==Theory==
Neutrino oscillation arises from mixing between the flavor and mass eigenstates of neutrinos. That is, the three neutrino states that interact with the charged leptons in weak interactions are each a different superposition of the three (propagating) neutrino states of definite mass. Neutrinos are emitted and absorbed in weak processes in flavor eigenstates but travel as mass eigenstates.

As a neutrino superposition propagates through space, the quantum mechanical phases of the three neutrino mass states advance at slightly different rates, due to the slight differences in their respective masses. This results in a changing superposition mixture of mass eigenstates as the neutrino travels; but a different mixture of mass eigenstates corresponds to a different mixture of flavor states. For example, a neutrino born as an electron neutrino will be some mixture of electron, mu, and tau neutrino after traveling some distance. Since the quantum mechanical phase advances in a periodic fashion, after some distance the state will nearly return to the original mixture, and the neutrino will be again mostly electron neutrino. The electron flavor content of the neutrino will then continue to oscillate – as long as the quantum mechanical state maintains coherence. Since mass differences between neutrino flavors are small in comparison with long coherence lengths for neutrino oscillations, this microscopic quantum effect becomes observable over macroscopic distances.

In contrast, due to their larger masses, the charged leptons (electrons, muons, and tau leptons) have never been observed to oscillate. In nuclear beta decay, muon decay, pion decay, and kaon decay, when a neutrino and a charged lepton are emitted, the charged lepton is emitted in incoherent mass eigenstates such as because of its large mass. Weak-force couplings compel the simultaneously emitted neutrino to be in a &quot;charged-lepton-centric&quot; superposition such as which is an eigenstate for a &quot;flavor&quot; that is fixed by the electron&#x27;s mass eigenstate, and not in one of the neutrino&#x27;s own mass eigenstates. Because the neutrino is in a coherent superposition that is not a mass eigenstate, the mixture that makes up that superposition oscillates significantly as it travels. No analogous mechanism exists in the Standard Model that would make charged leptons detectably oscillate. In the four decays mentioned above, where the charged lepton is emitted in a unique mass eigenstate, the charged lepton will not oscillate, as single mass eigenstates propagate without oscillation.

The case of (real) W boson decay is more complicated: W boson decay is sufficiently energetic to generate a charged lepton that is not in a mass eigenstate; however, the charged lepton would lose coherence, if it had any, over interatomic distances (0.1 nm) and would thus quickly cease any meaningful oscillation. More importantly, no mechanism in the Standard Model is capable of pinning down a charged lepton into a coherent state that is not a mass eigenstate, in the first place; instead, while the charged lepton from the W boson decay is not initially in a mass eigenstate, neither is it in any &quot;neutrino-centric&quot; eigenstate, nor in any other coherent state. It cannot meaningfully be said that such a featureless charged lepton oscillates or that it does not oscillate, as any &quot;oscillation&quot; transformation would just leave it the same generic state that it was before the oscillation. Therefore, detection of a charged lepton oscillation from W boson decay is infeasible on multiple levels.

===Pontecorvo–Maki–Nakagawa–Sakata matrix===

The idea of neutrino oscillation was first put forward in 1957 by Bruno Pontecorvo, who proposed that neutrino–antineutrino transitions may occur in analogy with neutral kaon mixing. Although such matter–antimatter oscillation had not been observed, this idea formed the conceptual foundation for the quantitative theory of neutrino flavor oscillation, which was first developed by Maki, Nakagawa, and Sakata in 1962 and further elaborated by Pontecorvo in 1967. One year later the solar neutrino deficit was first observed, and that was followed by the famous article by Gribov and Pontecorvo published in 1969 titled &quot;Neutrino astronomy and lepton charge&quot;.

The concept of neutrino mixing is a natural outcome of gauge theories with massive neutrinos, and its structure can be characterized in general. In its simplest form it is expressed as a unitary transformation relating the flavor and mass eigenbasis and can be written as
:formula_1
:formula_2

where
: formula_3 is a neutrino with definite flavor = (electron), (muon) or (tauon),
: formula_4 is a neutrino with definite mass formula_5 formula_6
: the superscript asterisk (formula_7) represents a complex conjugate; for antineutrinos, the complex conjugate should be removed from the first equation and inserted into the second.

The symbol formula_8 represents the &quot;Pontecorvo–Maki–Nakagawa–Sakata matrix&quot; (also called the &quot;PMNS matrix&quot;, &quot;lepton mixing matrix&quot;, or sometimes simply the &quot;MNS matrix&quot;). It is the analogue of the CKM matrix describing the analogous mixing of quarks. If this matrix were the identity matrix, then the flavor eigenstates would be the same as the mass eigenstates. However, experiment shows that it is not.

When the standard three-neutrino theory is considered, the matrix is 3×3. If only two neutrinos are considered, a 2×2 matrix is used. If one or more sterile neutrinos are added (see later), it is 4×4 or larger. In the 3×3 form, it is given by

:formula_9

where and The phase factors and are physically meaningful only if neutrinos are Majorana particles—i.e. if the neutrino is identical to its antineutrino (whether or not they are is unknown)—and do not enter into oscillation phenomena regardless. If neutrinoless double beta decay occurs, these factors influence its rate. The phase factor is non-zero only if neutrino oscillation violates CP symmetry; this has not yet been observed experimentally. If experiment shows this 3×3 matrix to be not unitary, a sterile neutrino or some other new physics is required.

===Propagation and interference===
Since formula_10 are mass eigenstates, their propagation can be described by plane wave solutions of the form

:formula_11

where
* quantities are expressed in natural units formula_12 and formula_13
* formula_14 is the energy of the mass-eigenstate formula_15,
* formula_16 is the time from the start of the propagation,
* formula_17 is the three-dimensional momentum,
* formula_18 is the current position of the particle relative to its starting position

In the ultrarelativistic limit, formula_19 we can approximate the energy as
:formula_20
where is the energy of the wavepacket (particle) to be detected.

This limit applies to all practical (currently observed) neutrinos, since their masses are less than 1 eV and their energies are at least 1 MeV, so the Lorentz factor, , is greater than in all cases. Using also where is the distance traveled and also dropping the phase factors, the wavefunction becomes
:formula_21

Eigenstates with different masses propagate with different frequencies. The heavier ones oscillate faster compared to the lighter ones. Since the mass eigenstates are combinations of flavor eigenstates, this difference in frequencies causes interference between the corresponding flavor components of each mass eigenstate. Constructive interference causes it to be possible to observe a neutrino created with a given flavor to change its flavor during its propagation. The probability that a neutrino originally of flavor will later be observed as having flavor is
:formula_22

This is more conveniently written as
:formula_23
where formula_24 

The phase that is responsible for oscillation is often written as (with and formula_25 restored)
:formula_26
where 1.27 is unitless. In this form, it is convenient to plug in the oscillation parameters since:

* The mass differences, {{math|Δ&quot;m&quot;}}{{sup|2}}, are known to be on the order of {{10^|−4}} eV{{sup|2}} = ({{10^|−2}} eV){{sup|2}}
* Oscillation distances, {{mvar|L}}, in modern experiments are on the order of kilometers
* Neutrino energies, {{mvar|E}}, in modern experiments are typically on order of MeV or GeV.

If there is no CP-violation ({{mvar|δ}} is zero), then the second sum is zero. Otherwise, the CP asymmetry can be given as
:formula_27

In terms of Jarlskog invariant 
:formula_28 
the CP asymmetry is expressed as
:formula_29

===Two-neutrino case===
The above formula is correct for any number of neutrino generations. Writing it explicitly in terms of mixing angles is extremely cumbersome if there are more than two neutrinos that participate in mixing. Fortunately, there are several meaningful cases in which only two neutrinos participate significantly. In this case, it is sufficient to consider the mixing matrix

:formula_30

Then the probability of a neutrino changing its flavor is

:formula_31

Or, using SI units and the convention introduced above

:formula_32

This formula is often appropriate for discussing the transition {{math|&quot;ν&quot;{{sub|μ}} ↔ &quot;ν&quot;{{sub|τ}} }}in atmospheric mixing, since the electron neutrino plays almost no role in this case. It is also appropriate for the solar case of {{math|&quot;ν&quot;{{sub|e}} ↔ &quot;ν&quot;{{sub|x}} ,}} where {{math|&quot;ν&quot;{{sub|x}} }}is a mix (superposition) of {{math|&quot;ν&quot;{{sub|μ}} }}and {{math|&quot;ν&quot;{{sub|τ}} .}} These approximations are possible because the mixing angle {{mvar|θ}}{{sub|13}} is very small and because two of the mass states are very close in mass compared to the third.

=== Classical analogue of neutrino oscillation ===
{{multiple image | direction = vertical | width = 200

|caption2=Time evolution of the pendulums
|image3=Gleichsinnig.svg
|caption3=Lower frequency normal mode
|image4=Gegensinnig.svg
|caption4=Higher frequency normal mode
The basic physics behind neutrino oscillation can be found in any system of coupled harmonic oscillators. A simple example is a system of two pendulums connected by a weak spring (a spring with a small spring constant). The first pendulum is set in motion by the experimenter while the second begins at rest. Over time, the second pendulum begins to swing under the influence of the spring, while the first pendulum&#x27;s amplitude decreases as it loses energy to the second. Eventually all of the system&#x27;s energy is transferred to the second pendulum and the first is at rest. The process then reverses. The energy oscillates between the two pendulums repeatedly until it is lost to friction.

The behavior of this system can be understood by looking at its normal modes of oscillation. If the two pendulums are identical then one normal mode consists of both pendulums swinging in the same direction with a constant distance between them, while the other consists of the pendulums swinging in opposite (mirror image) directions. These normal modes have (slightly) different frequencies because the second involves the (weak) spring while the first does not. The initial state of the two-pendulum system is a combination of both normal modes. Over time, these normal modes drift out of phase, and this is seen as a transfer of motion from the first pendulum to the second.

The description of the system in terms of the two pendulums is analogous to the flavor basis of neutrinos. These are the parameters that are most easily produced and detected (in the case of neutrinos, by weak interactions involving the W boson). The description in terms of normal modes is analogous to the mass basis of neutrinos. These modes do not interact with each other when the system is free of outside influence.

When the pendulums are not identical the analysis is slightly more complicated. In the small-angle approximation, the potential energy of a single pendulum system is formula_33, where &quot;g&quot; is the standard gravity, &quot;L&quot; is the length of the pendulum, &quot;m&quot; is the mass of the pendulum, and &quot;x&quot; is the horizontal displacement of the pendulum. As an isolated system the pendulum is a harmonic oscillator with a frequency of formula_34. The potential energy of a spring is formula_35 where &quot;k&quot; is the spring constant and &quot;x&quot; is the displacement. With a mass attached it oscillates with a period of formula_36. With two pendulums (labeled &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;) of equal mass but possibly unequal lengths and connected by a spring, the total potential energy is

: formula_37

This is a quadratic form in &quot;x&quot;&quot;a&quot; and &quot;x&quot;&quot;b&quot;, which can also be written as a matrix product:

:formula_38

The 2×2 matrix is real symmetric and so (by the spectral theorem) it is &quot;orthogonally diagonalizable&quot;. That is, there is an angle &quot;θ&quot; such that if we define

:formula_39

then

:formula_40

where &quot;λ&quot;1 and &quot;λ&quot;2 are the eigenvalues of the matrix. The variables x1 and x2 describe normal modes which oscillate with frequencies of formula_41 and formula_42. When the two pendulums are identical (&quot;L&quot;&quot;a&quot; = &quot;L&quot;&quot;b&quot;), &quot;θ&quot; is 45°.

The angle &quot;θ&quot; is analogous to the Cabibbo angle (though that angle applies to quarks rather than neutrinos).

When the number of oscillators (particles) is increased to three, the orthogonal matrix can no longer be described by a single angle; instead, three are required (Euler angles). Furthermore, in the quantum case, the matrices may be complex. This requires the introduction of complex phases in addition to the rotation angles, which are associated with CP violation but do not influence the observable effects of neutrino oscillation.

==Theory, graphically==

=== Two neutrino probabilities in vacuum ===

In the approximation where only two neutrinos participate in the oscillation, the probability of oscillation follows a simple pattern:

The blue curve shows the probability of the original neutrino retaining its identity. The red curve shows the probability of conversion to the other neutrino. The maximum probability of conversion is equal to sin22&quot;θ&quot;. The frequency of the oscillation is controlled by Δm2.

===Three neutrino probabilities===
If three neutrinos are considered, the probability for each neutrino to appear is somewhat complex. The graphs below show the probabilities for each flavor, with the plots in the left column showing a long range to display the slow &quot;solar&quot; oscillation, and the plots in the right column zoomed in, to display the fast &quot;atmospheric&quot; oscillation. The parameters used to create these graphs (see below) are consistent with current measurements, but since some parameters are still quite uncertain, some aspects of these plots are only qualitatively correct.

The illustrations were created using the following parameter values:
* sin2(2&quot;θ&quot;13) = 0.10 (Determines the size of the small wiggles.)
* sin2(2&quot;θ&quot;23) = 0.97
* sin2(2&quot;θ&quot;12) = 0.861
* &quot;δ&quot; = 0 (If the actual value of this phase is large, the probabilities will be somewhat distorted, and will be different for neutrinos and antineutrinos.)
* Normal mass hierarchy: &quot;m&quot;1 ≤ &quot;m&quot;2 ≤ &quot;m&quot;3
* Δ&quot;m&quot;{{su|p=2|b=12}} = {{val|0.759|e = −4|u = eV2}}
* Δ&quot;m&quot;{{su|p=2|b=32}} ≈ Δ&quot;m&quot;{{su|p = 2|b = 13}} = {{val|23.2|e = −4|u = eV2}}

==Observed values of oscillation parameters==

* {{math|&quot;δ&quot;, &quot;α&quot;1, &quot;α&quot;2,}} and the sign of {{math|Δ&quot;m&quot;}}{{su|p=2|b=32}} are currently unknown.

Solar neutrino experiments combined with KamLAND have measured the so-called solar parameters {{math|Δ&quot;m&quot;}}{{su|p=2|b=sol}} and{{nobr| {{math|sin2 &quot;θ&quot;}}sol .}} Atmospheric neutrino experiments such as Super-Kamiokande together with the K2K and MINOS long baseline accelerator neutrino experiment have determined the so-called atmospheric parameters {{math|Δ&quot;m&quot;}}{{su|p=2|b=atm}} and {{nobr|{{math|sin2 &quot;θ&quot;}}atm .}} The last mixing angle, {{mvar|θ}}13, has been measured by the experiments Daya Bay, Double Chooz and RENO as {{nobr| {{math|sin2(2 &quot;θ&quot;13″)}} .}}

For atmospheric neutrinos the relevant difference of masses is about {{nobr|{{math|Δ&quot;m&quot;2 {{=}} }}{{val|24.|e=-4|u=eV2}} }}and the typical energies are {{val|p=≈|1|u=GeV}}; for these values the oscillations become visible for neutrinos traveling several hundred kilometres, which would be those neutrinos that reach the detector traveling through the earth, from below the horizon.

The mixing parameter {{mvar|θ}}13 is measured using electron anti-neutrinos from nuclear reactors. The rate of anti-neutrino interactions is measured in detectors sited near the reactors to determine the flux prior to any significant oscillations and then it is measured in far detectors (placed kilometres from the reactors). The oscillation is observed as an apparent disappearance of electron anti-neutrinos in the far detectors (i.e. the interaction rate at the far site is lower than predicted from the observed rate at the near site).

From atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillation experiments, it is known that two mixing angles of the MNS matrix are large and the third is smaller. This is in sharp contrast to the CKM matrix in which all three angles are small and hierarchically decreasing. The CP-violating phase of the MNS matrix is as of April 2020 to lie somewhere between −2 and −178 degrees, from the T2K experiment.

If the neutrino mass proves to be of Majorana type (making the neutrino its own antiparticle), it is then possible that the MNS matrix has more than one phase.

Since experiments observing neutrino oscillation measure the squared mass difference and not absolute mass, one might claim that the lightest neutrino mass is exactly zero, without contradicting observations. This is however regarded as unlikely by theorists.

==Origins of neutrino mass==
The question of how neutrino masses arise has not been answered conclusively. In the Standard Model of particle physics, fermions only have intrinsic mass because of interactions with the Higgs field (see &quot;Higgs boson&quot;). These interactions require both left- and right-handed versions of the fermion (see &quot;chirality&quot;). However, only left-handed neutrinos have been observed so far.

Neutrinos may have another source of mass through the Majorana mass term. This type of mass applies for electrically neutral particles since otherwise it would allow particles to turn into anti-particles, which would violate conservation of electric charge.

The smallest modification to the Standard Model, which only has left-handed neutrinos, is to allow these left-handed neutrinos to have Majorana masses. The problem with this is that the neutrino masses are surprisingly smaller than the rest of the known particles (at least 600,000 times smaller than the mass of an electron), which, while it does not invalidate the theory, is widely regarded as unsatisfactory as this construction offers no insight into the origin of the neutrino mass scale.

The next simplest addition would be to add into the Standard Model right-handed neutrinos that interact with the left-handed neutrinos and the Higgs field in an analogous way to the rest of the fermions. These new neutrinos would interact with the other fermions solely in this way and hence would not be directly observable, so are not phenomenologically excluded. The problem of the disparity of the mass scales remains.

===Seesaw mechanism===
{{Main|Seesaw mechanism}}
The most popular conjectured solution currently is the &quot;seesaw mechanism&quot;, where right-handed neutrinos with very large Majorana masses are added. If the right-handed neutrinos are very heavy, they induce a very small mass for the left-handed neutrinos, which is proportional to the reciprocal of the heavy mass.

If it is assumed that the neutrinos interact with the Higgs field with approximately the same strengths as the charged fermions do, the heavy mass should be close to the GUT scale. Because the Standard Model has only one fundamental mass scale, all particle masses must arise in relation to this scale.

There are other varieties of seesaw and there is currently great interest in the so-called low-scale seesaw schemes, such as the inverse seesaw mechanism.

The addition of right-handed neutrinos has the effect of adding new mass scales, unrelated to the mass scale of the Standard Model, hence the observation of heavy right-handed neutrinos would reveal physics beyond the Standard Model. Right-handed neutrinos would help to explain the origin of matter through a mechanism known as leptogenesis.

===Other sources===
There are alternative ways to modify the standard model that are similar to the addition of heavy right-handed neutrinos (e.g., the addition of new scalars or fermions in triplet states) and other modifications that are less similar (e.g., neutrino masses from loop effects and/or from suppressed couplings). One example of the last type of models is provided by certain versions supersymmetric extensions of the standard model of fundamental interactions, where R parity is not a symmetry. There, the exchange of supersymmetric particles such as squarks and sleptons can break the lepton number and lead to neutrino masses. These interactions are normally excluded from theories as they come from a class of interactions that lead to unacceptably rapid proton decay if they are all included. These models have little predictive power and are not able to provide a cold dark matter candidate.

==Oscillations in the early universe==
During the early universe when particle concentrations and temperatures were high, neutrino oscillations could have behaved differently. Depending on neutrino mixing-angle parameters and masses, a broad spectrum of behavior may arise including vacuum-like neutrino oscillations, smooth evolution, or self-maintained coherence. The physics for this system is non-trivial and involves neutrino oscillations in a dense neutrino gas.

<text>, sometimes transliterated Shimbashi, is a district of Minato, Tokyo, Japan.

==Name==
Read literally, the characters in Shinbashi mean &quot;new bridge&quot;.

==History==
The area was the site of a bridge built across the Shiodome River in 1604. The river was later filled in. Shinbashi was the Tokyo terminus of the first railway in Japan in 1872. It remains a major railway hub and has since developed into a commercial center, most recently with the construction of the Shiodome &quot;Shiosite&quot; high-rise office complex.

==Places in Shinbashi==
*Reconstructed Shimbashi Station, which now houses a museum and restaurant.
*Shiodome Shiosite high-rise commercial complex.

==Economy==
The Shiodome City Center building in Shiodome includes the corporate headquarters and public and investor relations offices of Fujitsu, the headquarters of All Nippon Airways, and the headquarters of ANA subsidiaries Air Nippon and ANA &amp; JP Express. In addition ANA subsidiary Air Japan has some offices in Shiodome City Center. In the late 1960s All Nippon Airways had its headquarters in the Hikokan Building in Shinbashi.

Other companies in Shinbashi include:
*Dentsu
*Kyodo News
*Nippon Television
*Nittsu
*Panasonic Electric Works (Tokyo head office)
*Shiseido
*Softbank
*Yakult

==Train stations==

*Shimbashi Station (Ginza Line, Keihin-Tohoku Line, Toei Asakusa Line, Yamanote Line, Yokosuka Line, Yurikamome)
*Shiodome Station (Toei Oedo Line, Yurikamome)

==Education==
Minato City Board of Education operates public elementary and junior high schools.

Shinbashi 1-6-chōme is zoned to Onarimon Elementary School (御成門小学校) and Onarimon Junior High School (御成門中学校).

<text>Westside is a New Zealand comedy drama television series created by Rachel Lang and James Griffin for South Pacific Pictures. It is a prequel to &quot;Outrageous Fortune&quot;, and chronicles the lives of Ted and Rita West. The show aired from 31 May 2015 to 16 November 2020 on Three, formerly known as TV3.

Series 4 premiered on 9 July 2018. On 21 July 2018 NZ on Air announced funding for a fifth series which will consist of 10 episodes. On 19 July 2019, NZ on Air announced funding for a sixth and final series of &quot;Westside&quot;.

== Plot ==
The first series is set in the 1970s, it features a Westie couple, and stars Antonia Prebble and David de Lautour as Rita and Ted West. In the first episode, set in 1974, it features John Walker beating Rod Dixon in the 1500 metres at the 1974 Commonwealth Games. Each episode covers one year, from 1974 to 1979, with events like the Muldoon election, dawn raids on overstayers, carless days, and the birth of the punk rock scene in Auckland.

The second series is set in 1981, and follows the Springbok Tour. The series starts with Rita returning home from prison to find the West household in disrepair. Throughout the course of the series Ted&#x27;s gang plots to steal from the South Africans visiting New Zealand, preventing them from buying land, while Rita plans a job against developer Evan Lace.

The third series is set in 1982 and deals with the fallout from the Evan Lace job and Wolf&#x27;s first meeting with his future wife, Cheryl.

<text>The Town of Windsor is a former local government area of Queensland, Australia, located in northern Brisbane.

==History==

On 11 February 1887, a portion of the Ithaca Division was proclaimed a municipality to be known as the Shire of Windsor.

On 10 February 1904, the shire was proclaimed the Town of Windsor.

On 1 October 1925, the town was amalgamated into the City of Brisbane.

==Windsor Town Council Chambers==

In the 1860s, local Brisbane tuff stone was extracted from a quarry at Windsor alongside Lutwyche Road. In 1897 the Windsor Shire Council built their Shire Chambers (later Town Chambers) at 356 Lutwyche Road (corner of Palmer Street) (), immediately beside the quarry using stone from the quarry.

After the amalgamation into City of Brisbane, the Windsor Town Council Chambers was used as storage and office space by the Brisbane City Council, which undertook a restoration of the building in 1987.

Today it is home to the Windsor and District Historical Society and the National Trust of Queensland; the public is welcome to visit.

The Windsor Town Council Chambers was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register in 1992.

<doc id="1328167" wikidata="Q993066" url="?curid=1328167" title="Ipecac Recordings">
<text>Ipecac Recordings is an independent record label based in California. It was founded on April 1, 1999, by Greg Werckman (ex-label manager of Alternative Tentacles, ex-lead singer of DUH, ex-employee of Mercury Records) and Mike Patton (Faith No More, Mr. Bungle, Fantômas, Tomahawk, Peeping Tom, and Mondo Cane) in Alameda, California.

Originally, the label was created for the sole purpose of releasing the first Fantômas album. It has since distributed music by artists such as Melvins, Oxbow and Isis, as well as several of Patton&#x27;s other projects and collaborations.

The label is named after syrup of ipecac, an emetic, or vomit-inducing, medicine. Its slogan is &quot;Ipecac Recordings—Making People Sick Since 1999&quot;.

== Business practices ==

Ipecac is distinguished from most labels (independent labels included) by their policy of signing bands to only one-album contracts. Werckman claims that &quot;when starting our label we decided that it did not feel right to &#x27;own&#x27; the artists on our label. Instead we would rent or license records from artists that we liked.&quot; &quot;Lawyers or businesspeople call us morons for only doing one-record deals,&quot; Werckman scoffs. &quot;They say, &#x27;You&#x27;re not really anything, then.&#x27; Well, we like our catalogue. We like the records we put out. Our bands aren&#x27;t rushing away. Our job isn&#x27;t to own any artist. We&#x27;re here to put out the art that people create.&quot; Low overhead and no video or promotional cost partnered with very little distribution costs allow for hearty royalties. &quot;Every six months I send those guys royalty checks,&quot; Werckman says. &quot;It&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s the way it should be. Even bands that are very successful — when they get royalty checks from us, they&#x27;re stunned.&quot;

Ipecac has offices in California.

<text>Caterina Jarboro (July 24, 1898 – August 13, 1986) was an American opera singer. She was the first female black opera singer to sing with a major company, twenty-two years before Marian Anderson&#x27;s début at the Metropolitan Opera.

==Biography==
Jarboro was born in 1898 as Katherine (Katie) Lee Yarborough in Wilmington, North Carolina. Her father John was African-American and her mother Annie was Native-American. She had at least four siblings and was raised Catholic (baptized at St Thomas Church in her hometown).

Jarboro studied in North Carolina and then in New York. She sang in the theater musical &quot;Shuffle Along&quot; and in James P. Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Running Wild&quot;. In 1930 she debuted in opera with Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot; at the Puccini Theatre in Milan, Italy.

In 1933, twenty-two years before Marian Anderson&#x27;s début at the Metropolitan Opera, impresario Alfredo Salmaggi hired Jarboro to sing with his opera company at the New York Hippodrome. She was presented in the title role of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot;.

Later she appeared with the company as Sélika in Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Africaine&quot;. She was the first female black opera singer ever to perform a leading role with an otherwise all-white company in America (baritone Jules Bledsoe had sung Amonasro with the Cleveland Stadium Opera in 1932). This milestone earned Salmaggi special recognition from First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. Many other opera appearances throughout Europe followed.

She returned to the United States in 1941. Among her performances were a recitals at the Town Hall in 1942 and Carnegie Hall in 1944. The New York Metropolitan Opera Association invited her to become a member, but when they realized she was not Italian, but Afro-Indian, they denied her membership. After a lengthy and successful career she declined membership when a second invitation was extended. She retired in 1955. She was a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Incorporated.

Jarboro died on August 13, 1986, in Manhattan at age 88. Her siblings alive at her time of death were Joseph Yarborough of Philadelphia, and Anna Gayle of Palmetto, Florida.

<doc id="1328186" wikidata="Q1404473" url="?curid=1328186" title="Female Trouble">
<text>Female Trouble is a 1974 American independent dark comedy film written, produced and directed by John Waters. It stars Divine, David Lochary, Mary Vivian Pearce, Mink Stole, and Edith Massey, and follows delinquent high school student Dawn Davenport (played by Divine), who runs away from home, gets pregnant while hitchhiking, and embarks upon a life of crime.

Made directly after his notorious 1972 cult hit &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot; (which used much of the same cast and was made in a similar low-budget style), Waters also acted as cinematographer and co-editor. The film is dedicated to Manson Family member Charles &quot;Tex&quot; Watson. Waters&#x27; prison visits to Watson inspired the &quot;crime is beauty&quot; theme of the film and in the film&#x27;s opening credits, Waters includes a wooden toy helicopter that Watson made for him.

==Plot==
In Baltimore in 1960, delinquent high-school student Dawn Davenport goes berserk when her parents refuse to buy her the cha-cha heels she wanted for Christmas. In a fit of rage, she topples the family Christmas tree on her mother, and storms out of the house barely even dressed. Dawn hitchhikes a ride with a repulsive, lecherous man, Earl Peterson, who drives her to a dump where they have sex on a discarded mattress. Dawn becomes pregnant, but Earl refuses to support her. She eventually gives birth to a daughter, Taffy, whom she often beats and punishes severely. Dawn works various dead-end jobs, such as a waitress in a diner, and a stripper, and engages in criminal activities such as burglary and street prostitution with her former high-school friends Concetta and Chicklette.

Dawn frequents the Lipstick Beauty Salon and marries Gater Nelson, her hair stylist and next-door neighbor. Donald and Donna Dasher, the owners of the beauty salon, recruit Dawn to be part of an artistic experiment to prove &quot;crime and beauty are the same&quot;. They entice Dawn to commit crimes by promising her fame, and photograph her crimes to stoke her vanity.

Gater&#x27;s aunt, Ida Nelson, is distraught over her nephew&#x27;s marriage because she wants him to date men instead of women. When the marriage fails, Dawn persuades the Dashers to fire Gater, who moves to Detroit to work in the auto industry. Ida blames Dawn for driving Gater away and exacts revenge by throwing acid in her face, leaving Dawn hideously disfigured. The Dashers discourage Dawn from having corrective cosmetic surgery and use her as a grotesquely made-up model. They redecorate her home, and provide her with new clothes, money and make-up (which they make her inject like a drug). After they kidnap Ida and imprison her in a large birdcage as a gift to Dawn, they give Dawn an axe to chop off her hand as revenge for the acid attack.

Taffy, now a teenager, is distressed by her mother&#x27;s criminal lifestyle and the fact that Dawn keeps trying to make her believe she is intellectually disabled. Taffy persuades Dawn to reveal the identity of her father, but when Taffy traces him, she finds him drunk, disheveled and living in squalor. She stabs him to death with a chef&#x27;s knife after he tries to molest her. Taffy returns home, falsely claims she was unable to locate her father, and announces she is joining the Hare Krishna movement. Dawn threatens to kill her if she does.

Dawn, now with bizarre hair, make-up and outfits provided by the Dashers, mounts a nightclub act. When Taffy appears backstage in religious attire, Dawn fulfills her threat and strangles her to death. As part of her nightclub act, Dawn bounces on a trampoline, tears a phone directory into pieces, and cavorts in a crib full of dead fish. She then brandishes a gun onstage and begins firing into the crowd, wounding and killing several audience members. When police arrive to ostensibly subdue the crowd, they shoot several audience members themselves but allow the Dashers to leave when they claim to be upright citizens. Dawn flees into a forest, but is soon arrested by the police and put on trial for murder.

At the trial, the judge grants the Dashers immunity from prosecution for testifying against Dawn. The Dashers feign innocence and completely blame Dawn for the crimes she committed at their behest, and they bribe Ida to give false testimony in order to get Dawn convicted. Although Dawn&#x27;s lawyer tries to have her found not guilty by reason of insanity, the jury finds Dawn guilty and sentences her to die in the electric chair. In prison, after Dawn says goodbye to her fellow inmate and lesbian lover Earnestine, she is escorted by a priest and two guards to her execution. As Dawn is strapped to the chair, she makes a speech to an imaginary audience as if she were accepting an award, and is then executed.

==Cast==
==Theme song==
The lyrics to the title song, sung by Divine, were written by Waters and set to the instrumental track of &quot;Black Velvet Soul&quot; by jazz musician Cookie Thomas. The lyrics foreshadow the ending of the film with Dawn being sent to the electric chair.

==Production notes==
* The unique production design is by Dreamlander Vincent Peranio, who created Dawn&#x27;s apartment in a condemned suite above a friend&#x27;s store. 
* Waters explained in a 2015 interview that Dawn Davenport&#x27;s look was based on the woman in the famous 1966 Diane Arbus photograph of a young Brooklyn family on a Sunday outing.
* Divine chose to perform his own stunts, the most difficult of which involved doing flips on a trampoline during his nightclub act. Waters took Divine to a YMCA, where he took lessons until the act was perfected to the point where he did the athletic stunt without his wig being dislodged. Divine also nailed a difficult outdoor stunt involving crossing a real river in drag in the sleet and rain. He could have been swept downstream, but made his mark on the other side with a smile on his face.
* The birth scene was saved until the end of shooting, when Dreamlander Susan Lowe gave birth to a son and agreed to Waters&#x27; request that they film her son as Dawn&#x27;s baby. The umbilical cord was fashioned out of prophylactics filled with liver, while the baby (Ramsey McLean) was doused in fake blood. The scene greatly confused Lowe&#x27;s mother-in-law, who was visiting from England to meet her grandchild for the first time.
* On the 2004 DVD Director&#x27;s Special Comments, Waters states that the original working title of the film was &quot;Rotten Mind, Rotten Face&quot;. He changed it because he did not want to risk having hostile film critics using the headline &quot;Rotten Mind, Rotten Face, Rotten Movie&quot;. In his book &quot;Shock Value&quot;, Waters credits Cookie Mueller with the title &quot;Female Trouble&quot;. When Mueller was hospitalized for pelvic inflammatory disease in Provincetown, Waters and Mink Stole visited her. &quot;What happened, Cook?&quot; Waters asked. &quot;Just a little female trouble, hon,&quot; she replied.
* This film ended up being John Waters&#x27; last time he would work with actor David Lochary. Lochary was intended to act in Waters&#x27; next film&quot; Desperate Living&quot;, but he was on PCP at the time of production. He would die months after the movie was released.
* In the trial scene, the jury consisted of many of the main cast and crew&#x27;s relatives. The easiest to point out were David Lochary&#x27;s (Donald Dasher) mother (who was sitting on the top row to the far right) and brother (who is in the middle in the front row); and the mother of actor Ed Peranio (Wink) and set designer Vincent Peranio (who is spotted on the top row, third from the right).

==Reception==
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 90% based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Director John Waters&#x27; affection for camp brings texture to societal transgression in &quot;Female Trouble&quot;, a brazenly subversive dive into celebrity and mayhem.&quot;

==Alternate versions==
The initial 16 mm release of the film which was shown at colleges ran 92 minutes. However, when the film was blown up to 35 mm and shown theatrically, it was cut to 89 minutes. This version was the only version seen in the United States for many years. However, a recent restoration was done of the original cut, which runs 97 minutes; it has played at this 97-minute length in Europe, however, since its initial release.

The 97-minute version was shown in select theaters and was included in an out-of-print DVD set paired with &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot; (&quot;Female Trouble&quot; is still available on DVD as a single disc and as part of the DVD box set &quot;Very Crudely Yours, John Waters&quot;). This version also has a soundtrack remixed in stereo surround. The 97-minute version contains some additional scenes, including the chase through the woods, as well as an appearance by Sally Turner, the Elizabeth Taylor lookalike customer in the Lipstick Beauty Salon (Turner served as Divine&#x27;s double in the junkyard sex scene between Dawn Davenport and Earl Peterson).

The film was shown in the 89-minute cut when re-released in 2002.

The 97-minute version is now available on DVD and includes an audio commentary by Waters.

The Criterion Collection released a restored version of the film on DVD and Blu-ray on June 26, 2018.

<doc id="1328187" wikidata="Q1507340" url="?curid=1328187" title="Carniolan honey bee">
<text>The Carniolan honey bee (&quot;Apis mellifera carnica&quot;, Pollmann) is a subspecies of the European honey bee. The Carniolan honey bee is native to Slovenia, southern Austria, and parts of Albania, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, parts of Serbia, Hungary, parts of Romania and North-East Italy.

==Origin==
The Carniolan honey bee is a subspecies of the Western honey bee, that has naturalised and adapted to the Kočevje (Gottschee) sub-region of Carniola (Slovenia), the southern part of the Austrian Alps, Dinarides region, southern Pannonian plain and the northern Balkans. These bees are known as Carniolans, or &quot;Carnies&quot; for short, in English. At present this subspecies is the second most popular among beekeepers (after the Italian bee).

==Qualities==
It is favored among beekeepers for several reasons, not the least being its ability to defend itself successfully against insect pests while at the same time being extremely gentle in its behavior toward beekeepers. These bees are particularly adept at adjusting worker population to nectar availability. It relies on these rapid adjustments of population levels to rapidly expand worker bee populations after nectar becomes available in the spring, and, again, to rapidly cut off brood production when nectar ceases to be available in quantity. It meets periods of high nectar with high worker populations and consequently stores large quantities of honey and pollen during those periods. They are resistant to some diseases and parasites that can debilitate hives of other subspecies.

==Anatomy and appearance==
Carniolan honey bees are about the same size as the Italian honey bee, but they are physically distinguished by their generally dusky brown-grey color that is relieved by stripes of a subdued lighter brown color. Their chitin is dark, but it is possible to find lighter colored or brown colored rings and dots on their bodies. They are also known as the &quot;grey bee&quot;.

Carniolan bees are nearly as big and long as the Western European black bees, though their abdomens are much slimmer. Furthermore, the Carniolan bee has a very long tongue (6.5 to 6.7 mm, which is very well adapted for clover), a very high elbow joint and very short hair.

==Character and behavior==

Strengths
*Gentle and non-aggressive
*Can be kept in populated areas
*Better sense of orientation relative to the Italian honey bee
*Less drifting of bees from one hive to a neighboring hive
*Not as prone to robbing from other hives relative to the Italian honey bee
*Able to overwinter in smaller numbers of winter bees
*Thrifty during Winter, conserving honey stores
*Able to quickly adapt to changes in the environment
*Good for areas with longer winters
*Fast rhythm of brood production and then brood rearing reduction when available forage decreases 
*Lower use of propolis
*Increased resistance to brood diseases
*Good build up for areas with strong spring nectar flow and early pollination
*Forage earlier in the morning and later in the evening, and on cooler, wetter days
*Workers live up to 12% longer than other sub-species

<text>Desperate Living is a 1977 American black comedy film directed, produced, and written by John Waters. The film stars Liz Renay, Mink Stole, Susan Lowe, Edith Massey, Mary Vivian Pearce, and Jean Hill.

It is the third installment of what Waters has labeled the &quot;Trash Trilogy&quot;, which also includes &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot; (1972) and &quot;Female Trouble&quot; (1974), and the only one to not feature Divine. The film generated a cult following around Renay, who appeared in at least two dozen other films.

Following the murder of her husband, a suburban housewife and her maid agree to be exiled to Mortville, a shantytown ruled by a tyrannical queen regnant.

==Plot==
Neurotic and delusional suburban housewife Peggy Gravel and her overweight maid, Grizelda Brown, go on the lam after Grizelda smothers Peggy&#x27;s husband Bosley to death. A cross-dressing policeman arrests the pair and gives them an ultimatum: go to jail or be exiled to Mortville, a filthy shantytown ruled by the evil Queen Carlotta and her treasonous daughter, Princess Coo-Coo.

Peggy and Grizelda choose Mortville, and engage in lesbian prison sex. They become associates of self-hating lesbian wrestler Mole McHenry, who wants a sex change to please her lover, Muffy St. Jacques. After confiscating a lottery ticket from Peggy, Mole wins the Maryland Lottery and uses the money to obtain gender reassignment surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital. However, Muffy is repulsed by Mole&#x27;s phalloplasty and insists he cut it off, so Mole gives himself a penectomy.

Most of Mortville&#x27;s social outcasts—criminals, nudists, and sexual deviants—conspire to overthrow Queen Carlotta, who banishes Coo-Coo after she elopes with a garbage collector named Herbert, whom Queen Carlotta&#x27;s guards later shoot to death. Coo-Coo hides in Peggy and Grizelda&#x27;s house with her dead lover. When Peggy betrays Coo-Coo to the Queen&#x27;s guards, Grizelda fights them and dies when the house collapses on her. Peggy, however, joins the queen in terrorizing her subjects, even infecting them (and Princess Coo-Coo) with rabies.

Eventually, Mortville&#x27;s denizens, led by Mole, overthrow Queen Carlotta and execute Peggy by shooting a gun up her anus. To celebrate their freedom, the townsfolk roast Carlotta on a spit and serve her, pig-like, on a platter with an apple in her mouth.

==Cast==
==Production==

Art director Vincent Peranio built the exterior sets for Mortville on a 26-acre farm in Hampstead, Maryland, owned by Waters&#x27; friend, Peter Koper. The exterior sets were largely constructed of plywood and rubbish Peranio and Waters had collected from around Baltimore. Production manager Robert Maier recalled the challenges of shooting without adequate facilities, how the cast and crew overwhelmed the farm&#x27;s septic system, how heavy rains nearly washed away the set, and how &quot;charmed&quot; Waters seemed through it all.

The Mortville interiors were filmed in a 5000-sq-ft, second-story loft in a rented warehouse located in Fells Point, Baltimore. The space was unheated, noisy, and poorly suited for film production according to Maier.

&quot;Desperate Living&quot; was edited for 10 weeks in the basement of editor Charles Roggero&#x27;s home. It was Waters&#x27; first film with original music, by Chris Lobingier and Allen Yanus, to provide a &quot;cheesy &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;-type score&quot;.

===Casting===
&quot;Desperate Living&quot; is the only feature film Waters made without Divine prior to the actor&#x27;s death in 1988. Divine had to reluctantly back away from the film because he was committed to appearing in &quot;Women Behind Bars&quot;. Susan Lowe, who had appeared in small or supporting roles in Waters&#x27; previous films, was chosen to take over for the role of Mole McHenry. This was also Waters&#x27; first film without David Lochary, because of Lochary&#x27;s addiction to drugs. Waters said, &quot;The reason that David wasn&#x27;t in &quot;Desperate Living&quot; is because of PCP. That&#x27;s all that&#x27;s to it. I know that&#x27;s why he wasn&#x27;t in the film, and he knows it, too.&quot; Lochary died a few weeks after the film&#x27;s release, when he injured himself while under the influence of the drug.

Waters had received a copy of Liz Renay&#x27;s autobiography &quot;My Face for the World to See&quot; and wanted to offer her a role in the film. He went to see Renay in a burlesque show in Boston, then traveled to Los Angeles to offer her the role of Muffy St. Jacques. He offered her only a brief outline of the story, withholding some of the more graphic details for fear that she might refuse the role. Renay accepted the offer and flew to Baltimore for three weeks of shooting (which was, reportedly, all that the production could afford to pay Renay for her services).

==Release==
As with Waters&#x27; previous films, the premiere was held in the auditorium of the University of Baltimore. A brief controversy arose when lesbian groups attacked the film for its depiction of lesbianism, and for taking the title of a defunct lesbian magazine. New Line Cinema blew the film up from 16 to 35 mm and opened it at midnight in Manhattan, though the original poster (featuring a cooked rat on a plate) was rejected by &quot;The New York Times&quot; to run, forcing a new poster to be created three days before the opening. The new poster featured Liz Renay in a screaming pose, fashioned from a production still.

Critics from &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; walked out of the film after 10 minutes. Otherwise, &quot;Playboy&quot; enjoyed the film, stating it had to be &quot;seen to be believed&quot;. David Chute of &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot; said of the film: &quot;In &quot;Desperate Living&quot;, Waters comes close to creating a work of true trash art.&quot; 
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 70% based on 10 reviews, with an average rating of 5.9/10.

<text>Muhammad Najib ar-Ruba&#x27;i (; also spelled Al-Rubaiy; 1904–1965) was an Iraqi military officer and politician who served as the first president of Iraq, from 14 July 1958 to 8 February 1963. Together with Abdul Karim Qassim, he was one of the leaders of the 14 July Revolution that toppled King Faisal II and the Hashemite Iraqi monarchy in 1958.

While Qassim became prime minister and held most of the power, Ar-Ruba&#x27;i was elected head of state with the title of &quot;Chairman of the Sovereignty Council&quot;. The Sovereignty Council had a representative from each of the communal/ethnic groups. Ar-Ruba&#x27;i represented the Sunni community.

In 1963, Qassim was deposed in the Ramadan Revolution. This led Ar-Ruba&#x27;i to retire from politics, and he eventually died in 1965.

<doc id="1328190" wikidata="Q4115786" url="?curid=1328190" title="TWA Flight 903">
<text>TWA Flight 903 was a regularly scheduled flight from Bombay International Airport, India to New York-Idlewild Airport, via Cairo-King Farouk Airport and Rome-Ciampino Airport.

== Background ==
=== Aircraft ===
The aircraft involved was a Lockheed L-749A Constellation, called &quot;The Star of Maryland&quot;, registered as N6004C. It had 1,100 flight hours at the time of the crash.
=== Flight crew ===
Captain Walton B. Webb (age 45) had been employed by TWA since July 1, 1940. He had 10,664 flight hours, 822 of which were on the Lockheed L-749 Constellation.

First officer H. J. Hammitt (age 34) had been employed by TWA since September 12, 1945. He had 6,355 flight hours, 307 of which were on the Lockheed L-749 Constellation.

The other crew members were navigator H. B. Hackett, flight engineer Melvin C. House, radio operator H. J. Stiles, flight purser Jose Bernard, and flight attendant J. Lorenzi.

== Flight ==

The aircraft departed Cairo at 23:35 for Rome with 55 persons aboard, (48 passengers and seven crew members), in good weather.

As Flight 903 was climbing at , the crew reported that its number three engine was on fire and that they needed a priority return to Cairo. As the plane was returning to Cairo, the engine separated from the aircraft, forcing the crew to attempt a forced landing in the desert about 65 miles NNW of Cairo. The airliner went down near the village of Itay El Barud at the rim of the Western Desert, killing all 55 on board. 

Searchers found the wreckage strewn over after trekking over hot sands to reach it, where the aircraft wreckage was found almost completely burnt out. The bodies of the victims were badly charred, delaying identification. A United Press International correspondent reported that the plane had smashed into a narrow-gauge railway in hitting the ground and had plowed up a considerable stretch of track.

Among those killed were Egyptian film star Camelia; Polish architect Maciej Nowicki, who had been working on the design of the new city of Chandigarh; and Indian mathematician S. S. Pillai, who was on his way to participate in the International Congress of Mathematicians at Harvard University.

== Investigation ==
After an intensive investigation, the probable cause of the crash was cited to be failure of the rear master rod bearing on the number three engine. The failure caused the rear crankpin to overheat and fail, whereupon all the rear connecting rods failed, tearing through the cylinder walls and crankcase. In the process, oil lines were torn open, which caused the fire. Sludge buildup in the crankpins, blocking oil flow was thought to be the root cause, which resulted in improved oil screens and the implementation of a crankpin plug, as well as revised oil change intervals.

<doc id="1328198" wikidata="Q7787509" url="?curid=1328198" title="Thomas Beck (actor)">
<text>Thomas Beck (December 29, 1909 – September 23, 1995) was an American film and stage actor during the mid to late 1930s, who first attracted attention playing juvenile leads in several Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto films.

==Early life==
Born in New York City, Beck entered college with the intention of becoming a doctor but abandoned that for engineering.

==Career==
His first professional work was in a stock company and he later played on Broadway. His work interested film executives who sent him to Hollywood. Beck was featured in 28 films in his career, with notable roles in several Charlie Chan films: &quot;Charlie Chan in Paris&quot; (1935), &quot;Charlie Chan in Egypt&quot; (1935), &quot;Charlie Chan at the Race Track&quot; (1936), and &quot;Charlie Chan at the Opera&quot; (1936). He also worked opposite Will Rogers in &quot;Life Begins at 40&quot; (1935), in which he played the spoiled son of a landowner; appeared as a French legionnaire in &quot;Under Two Flags&quot; (1936), played Pastor Schultz, the village priest, in Shirley Temple&#x27;s 1937 film &quot;Heidi&quot;; and appeared opposite Temple&#x27;s counterpart Jane Withers in &quot;Can This Be Dixie?&quot; (1936). He was seen to good advantage in two 1936 Fox motion pictures, in which he had leading roles: as a pilot in Peter Lorre&#x27;s first American film, the espionage thriller &quot;Crack-Up&quot; and as a rich socialite in &quot;Champagne Charlie&quot;.

He also worked to promote the Screen Actors Guild to improve working conditions for actors, and when his career seemed ready to take off he suddenly left movie work in 1939 after the studio tried to reduce his wages. He then served in the Army, serving in the Pacific theatre during World War II, finishing as a major in 1945. He briefly returned to the theatre in 1946, appearing with Blanche Yurka in &quot;Temper the Wind&quot;, in New York City.

==Death==
Beck died after battling Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and heart conditions in Miami Shores, Florida on September 23, 1995.

<text>Julius Lorenzo Cobb Bledsoe (December 29, 1897 – July 14, 1943) was an American baritone, a leading figure in the Harlem Renaissance, the first major Black opera singer in the United States, and one of the first Black artists to gain regular employment on Broadway.

==Early life and education==
Jules Bledsoe was born Julius Lorenzo Cobb Bledsoe in Waco, Texas in 1897 or 1898, the only child of Henry L. and Jessie Cobb Bledsoe. When his parents separated in 1899, Julius went with his mother to live with the Cobb family. His grandmother, mother, and aunts taught him to sing and play the piano. His grandfather, Stephen Cobb, in 1866 was the founding pastor of New Hope Baptist Church, the first organized religious congregation for freed slaves in Waco. It was where Bledsoe reportedly sang his first concert at the age of 5. During his youth Bledsoe attended Central Texas Academy from 1905 to 1914. After graduating as valedictorian, he studied liberal arts and music at Bishop College in Marshall, Texas, earning his B.A. &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in May 1918. (Bishop College also awarded Bledsoe an honorary Doctorate later in his career.) After graduation, he moved to Harper&#x27;s Ferry, West Virginia, where he served in the Civilian Chaplain Service, worked as a secretary, and promoted musical entertainment for the YMCA. He was also a member of the ROTC at Virginia Union University in Richmond, Virginia. After discharge from ROTC in December 1918, he moved to Brooklyn, New York, working as a freelance musician. In 1920 he began to study medicine at Columbia University but reevaluated his goals after his mother died. He decided to pursue a career as a professional musician instead, and began voice study with Claude Warford. Later he also studied under Lazar Samoiloff, Luigi Parisotti in Rome, and Mme. Bakkers in Paris.

==Career==

Opportunities for Black singers, especially Black male singers, were nearly non-existent on the concert or operatic stage in the early 1920s. Most of the few who found any success did so by traveling to Europe to establish a professional career. Bledsoe was an exception. He was able to sign with New York City musical agent and impresario Sol Hurok, who would manage contralto Marian Anderson a decade later. With Hurok&#x27;s sponsorship, Bledsoe made his professional singing debut in New York&#x27;s Aeolian Hall on Easter Sunday, April 20, 1924. Over the course of his career he traveled throughout the United States and Europe performing, acting, and writing. In 1927, when he was hired for the musical &quot;Show Boat&quot;, he announced that he changed his first name from &quot;Julius&quot; to &quot;Jules.&quot;

In New York City, early in his career, Bledsoe lived on Sugar Hill in Harlem. His addresses included:

* The Colonial Parkway Apartments at 409 Edgecombe Avenue
* 880 St. Nicholas Avenue
* The Garrison Apartments, 435 Convent Avenue, where in 1929 he was one of this cooperative apartment building&#x27;s original shareholders and Board members
Later in his career, he lived in East Midtown at 147 East 56th Street.

===Opera and music===

Bledsoe performed in many major operas and was in high demand due to his impressive vocal range and his ability to speak and sing in 8 languages: English, French, Italian, German, Russian, Spanish, Yiddish, and Dutch. In 1926 Bledsoe was a soloist at concerts in Boston under the direction of Serge Koussevitsky and also created the role of Tizan in W. Franke Harling and Laurence Stallings&#x27;s &quot;Deep River&quot;, a voodoo-themed opera set in 1835 in New Orleans, produced by Arthur Hopkins at the Imperial Theatre. A critic from the &quot;New York Morning Telegraph&quot; praised Bledsoe as the &quot;Deep River&quot; star who could “pick the heart right out of anybody.” In 1927, Bledsoe shared the stage with Rose McClendon, Abbie Mitchell, and Frank Wilson in Paul Green’s &quot;In Abraham’s Bosom&quot;, which won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1927. Bledsoe also performed the title character in Modest Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;. 

Bledsoe was the first to perform the role of Joe in Florenz Ziegfeld&#x27;s 1927 production of &quot;Show Boat&quot; by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II (based on the 1926 novel &quot;Show Boat&quot; by Edna Ferber). It became Bledsoe&#x27;s best known role, and his interpretation of &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; made the song a popular American classic. He recreated the role in the part-talkie 1929 film &quot;Show Boat&quot;. Bledsoe&#x27;s only recording of &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; is today occasionally played on the NPR musical theatre program, &quot;A Night on the Town&quot;. His rendition of the song, in comparison to those by Paul Robeson, William Warfield (in the 1951 film version), Bruce Hubbard (on the 1988 three-disc EMI album), and Michel Bell (in the Harold Prince revival of the show), is somewhat melodramatic in the manner of early twentieth-century acting. Bledsoe rolls all his Rs, as a baritone might when singing solos in an oratorio. A 2007 compact disc of vintage American Negro Spirituals includes Bledsoe singing &quot;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot&quot; in that same style, which demonstrates that it was not unique to his performance of &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River.&quot; Bledsoe was also filmed singing &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; in the sound prologue to the 1929 film &quot;Show Boat&quot;.

In 1932, Bledsoe appeared with the Cleveland Stadium Opera Company in its production of Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot;. He was called up with only 24 hour&#x27;s notice to replace Mostyn Thomas in the role of the Ethiopian king, Amonasro. It was a performance that crossed the color line for first time in American opera. In 1933, Bledsoe also sang the role of Amonasro with Alfredo Salmaggi&#x27;s Chicago Opera Company at the New York Hippodrome and with the Royal Dutch-Italian Opera Company in Amsterdam. He reprised the role in November 1934 with the Cosmopolitan Opera Association, also at the New York Hippodrome.

In 1930, Bledsoe created an original, more Afro-centric operatic adaptation of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s play, &quot;The Emperor Jones&quot;, from which he excised the word &quot;nigger.&quot; He could not secure the opera rights to the play, however; O&#x27;Neill had already given them to composer Louis Gruenberg. Literary scholar Katie N. Johnson discovered Bledsoe&#x27;s operatic scenario for it (retitled &quot;L&#x27;Empereur Jones&quot; in French) concealed in an undated travel journal among his papers in The Texas Collection at Baylor University, as well as nearly 30 pages of his operatic score tucked away and not indexed in a box labeled &quot;Sheet Music&quot; among Bledsoe&#x27;s papers at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture of the New York Public Library. Johnson notes that &quot;Bledsoe&#x27;s version was performed, though how often or where is uncertain.&quot; In 1934, Gruenberg&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;The Emperor Jones&quot; toured abroad, in England and the Netherlands, with Bledsoe starring in the title role. He got rave reviews, and returned to the United States intent on playing the role at home, even if it was Gruenberg&#x27;s and not his own adaptation. But in the early 1930s nearly all American opera houses were segregated, and when Gruenberg&#x27;s &quot;The Emperor Jones&quot; ran in New York at the Metropolitan Opera in 1933-1934, the title role, Brutus Jones, went to the legendary white baritone Lawrence Tibbett, who sang it in blackface. His performance was praised in the white press and panned in the Black press. The role remained Tibbett&#x27;s. Barred from singing at The Met because of his race, Bledsoe starred instead in an all-Black production of Gruenberg&#x27;s &quot;The Emperor Jones&quot; in the summer of 1934 by the all-Black but short-lived Aeolian Opera Company, which staged it just blocks away from The Met at the Mecca Temple (now the New York City Center). It was a history-making show, enthusiastically praised in both the white and Black press. In the winter of 1934, Bledsoe reprised the role with the Cosmopolitan Opera Company at the New York Hippodrome, to excellent reviews. 

Bledsoe was also a composer. For voice, violin, and orchestra, he composed a set of four songs called &quot;African Suite&quot;, which he performed with the BBC Symphony in 1936 and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam in 1937. He also wrote several other songs, including &quot;Does I Luv You,&quot; &quot;Poor Monah,&quot; &quot;Grandmother&#x27;s Melodies,&quot; &quot;Beside a New-Made Grave,&quot; &quot;The Farewell,&quot; &quot;Good Old British Blue,&quot; and &quot;Ode to America.&quot; He set Countee Cullen’s poem “Pagan Prayer” to music and performed it to widespread acclaim. In 1939 he wrote a full opera called &quot;Bondage&quot;, based on Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s novel &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;. Most of his composing was done on his farm in the Catskill Mountains, outside Roxbury, New York, which he had purchased in 1929 and named &quot;Jessie&#x27;s Manna Farm&quot; in honor of his mother.

Early in his career, Bledsoe recognized his own role as a Black trailblazer in theatre and music. In 1928 in &quot;,&quot; he published an essay titled &quot;Has the Negro a Place in the Theatre?&quot; His conclusion is that &quot;It is up to the few of us that have gotten past the sentinels at the gate, to fling the gates wide open for our successors.&quot; Bledsoe believed that Black artistic talent must be proven &quot;by the excellence of the many, rather than that of the few.&quot;

===Film===
Between 1929 and 1930, Bledsoe appeared in three musical film Shorts: &quot;Old Man Trouble&quot;, &quot;On the Levee&quot;, and &quot;Dear Old Southland&quot;. He spent 1940 and 1941 working in Hollywood, and played the part of Kalu in &quot;Drums of the Congo.&quot; He is believed to have acted in &quot;Safari, Western Union&quot; and &quot;Santa Fe Trail&quot;, although his name did not appear in the credits.

==Personal life==

Jules Bledsoe was gay, but during his lifetime his personal life and sexual orientation were not directly acknowledged or discussed in the newspapers and other media. Bledsoe&#x27;s manager, Adriaan Frederik &quot;Freddy&quot; Huygens, a member of the rich and influential Huygens family of the Netherlands, was also his lover and life-partner. They met in 1931. Huygens was living in London, and a reporter for the &quot;Daily Sketch&quot; wrote on July 27, 1931:

In London, Bledsoe and Huygens lived together at 21 Lowndes Square and 25 De Walden Street. In New York City, they lived together at 147 East 56th Street (in the parlor floor apartment) from 1934 to 1936. In March 1940, Bledsoe and Huygens moved to Hollywood, Los Angeles, California so that Bledsoe could pursue the next phase of his career in film. Their shared home is described in Clarence Rhambo’s self-published biography of Bledsoe. According to the 1940 Census record, the house was at 6930 Camrose Drive in Hollywood, rented by Adrian F. Huygens, age 40, of the Netherlands. Mr. Bledsoe is not listed. They later lived at 6642 Emmet Terrace in Hollywood. 

When Bledsoe died in July 1943, his aunt Naomi Cobb had his body brought to Waco, Texas for the funeral and burial. A spray of red roses from Huygens covered the casket. Heartbroken, Huygens decided to leave the Hollywood house he had shared with Bledsoe; he wrote to Naomi Cobb, “I cannot bear being in this house any longer, where every object speaks of him, and where I would suffocate.”

==Legacy and death==
Bledsoe died in Hollywood, California, on July 14, 1943 following a cerebral hemorrhage. At his funeral at New Hope Baptist Church in Waco, Texas, he was eulogized by J. J. Rhoades, the President of Bishop College, and A. J. Armstrong, the President of Baylor University. Bledsoe is buried in Greenwood Cemetery, a city-owned cemetery in Waco, Texas. His papers, including sheet music, photographs, and correspondence, are housed in The Texas Collection at Baylor University. The Jules Bledsoe papers, 1931–1939 are held in the Manuscripts, Archives and Rare Books Division at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, which is one of the research centers of the New York Public Library. These papers consist of correspondence, contracts, musical compositions, legal documents, financial records, programs, broadsides, and news clippings documenting Bledsoe&#x27;s professional career, particularly in Europe. The Bledsoe-Miller Community Center, a recreation facility in Waco, is jointly named for Bledsoe and Doris Miller.

<text>Grochów is a district of Warsaw, officially part of the borough of Praga-Południe although not connected at all to the historical &quot;Praga&quot; district. It is one of the most notable residential areas of right-bank Warsaw. There are many blocks of flats, as well as many pre-WWI houses. Grochów is nicknamed &quot;the lungs of Warsaw&quot;, owing to its many green spaces. Despite plans made by the former Communist authorities, Grochów had not transformed into a strictly industrial district, even though it had been such in the 19th century.

==History==
For centuries, Grochów was a small village south-east of Praga. The fields of Grochów and nearby Kamion saw the election of Henryk Walezy (in 1573) and August III Sas (in 1733) as Polish kings, since these fields were chosen as the seat of the Polish election Sejms. Until the late 18th century the village was the property of the bishops of Płock and shared the fate of the nearby Kamion. Since the 16th century, the field of Grochów was about 2.6 square kilometres in size and was one of the biggest undivided fields in all of Masovia. However, the Swedish Invasion of 1656 wreaked destruction, and a prosperous village was completely looted and burnt to the ground; only 9 houses remained. In 1780 Grochów was bought by King Stanisław August Poniatowski who gave it to his nephew, Prince Stanisław Poniatowski. The latter soon built a small manor in the village, the first house there to be constructed of anything besides wood. He soon subdivided the village into eight separate properties, selling each to a different family. This led to a period of prosperity as the village was rebuilt and began to serve as one of the most important centres of grain production and trade for the nearby city of Warsaw.

The Battle of Grochów took place on February 25, 1831, between the Polish forces of Józef Chłopicki and the Russian army of Hans Karl von Diebitsch. Grochów was severely damaged in the fighting, and as late as 1827 had only 105 inhabitants and 22 houses. Then the population grew again rapidly, and by the end of the 1820s several weaving plants and tobacconists&#x27; shops were founded. Another battle took place in the vicinity of Grochów during the November Uprising on February 25, 1831, and was named after the nearby woods, the Battle of Olszynka Grochowska. Until the 1850s several other small factories were located in the village, including ones for candles, soap, matches, paints, &quot;champagne wine&quot; and a brewery, as well as the first steam-powered laundry in Central and Eastern Europe. Such growth led to a rapid increase of the number of inhabitants who settled along the Warsaw-Terespol road (which was renamed &quot;Grochowska&quot; Street soon afterwards). Finally, in 1916, after the creation of the Kingdom of Poland as a puppet state of Germany, the village of Grochów became a part of Warsaw and a seat of &quot;Grochów Area of Warsaw&quot; (&quot;Komisariat XVII Grochowski&quot;).

After Poland regained her independence in 1918, Grochów and all the nearby villages started to grow rapidly. Grochów itself soon lost its rural and industrial character and was gradually converted into a borough built up with blocks of flats. New streets were paved, gas, running water and sewer networks were installed and it soon became one of the most popular places for companies and societies to build cheap houses for their employees and members.

During World War II Grochów escaped destruction, and from the early 1960s, it saw a new period of rapid growth and expansion as new areas were heavily built up with blocks of flats.</text><links>

<doc id="1328211" wikidata="Q707499" url="?curid=1328211" title="Bobby Cruz">
<text>Bobby Cruz (born February 2, 1938) is a Puerto Rico salsa singer and religious minister. He was part of the duo Richie Ray &amp; Bobby Cruz. Both Cruz and Ray became religious ministers and as such founded over 70 Christian churches during the period of about 16 years of their music&#x27;s greatest popularity, before they retired from popular music.

==Early years==
Cruz (birth name: Robert Cruz Ramos) was born in Hormigueros, Puerto Rico and raised in the humble surroundings on his family&#x27;s farm; his father was a sugar cane fields worker who later became a workers&#x27; union leader. In Cruz&#x27;s childhood, his parents moved to New York City where he was educated; there he also enjoyed singing; Bobby regarded the legendary Puerto Rican salsa band El Gran Combo&#x27;s style of music as the most influential in his life.

==Cruz meets Richie Ray==
In New York in 1964 Bobby Cruz met fellow Puerto Rican multi-instrumentalist Richie Ray and soon joined his orchestra as a back-up singer. In 1968, Cruz was the lead singer on the English-language song &quot;Mr. Trumpet Man&quot; (an attempt to exploit the boogaloo style that had grown popular in New York and other &quot;Latin&quot; (Spanish language) markets).

Between 1965 and 1975, the pairing of Richie Ray and Bobby Cruz had become one of the most popular salsa duets in the world. Ray and Cruz had a considerable influence in the Latino music world just because of four accomplishments:

* Their orchestra&#x27;s all-trumpet &quot;sonora&quot; sound, reminiscent of that of the Sonora Matancera, was called by that orchestra&#x27;s founder Rogelio Martínez as &quot;the best tribute the band ever had.&quot;
* Inadvertently, Ray and Cruz misinterpreted a comment by a Venezuelan television announcer during a visit to the country, and popularized the term &quot;salsa&quot; as a result (they thought the announcer&#x27;s reference to a tomato paste product was a slang reference to their music, and they incorporated it into their act).
* They are partially credited with keeping the Anglo style of Rock n Roll from invading Puerto Rico. (Curiously enough, at one time, the band&#x27;s horn section featured an entirely non-Latino lineup) Ray in particular is credited with bringing his classical musical influences to the band&#x27;s mix, and taking advantage of Cruz&#x27;s almost-operatic vocal range as a result.
* Cruz is credited for assisting Rubén Blades into getting work at Fania Records. Cruz&#x27;s band even recorded some of Blades&#x27; earliest compositions, particularly &quot;(Yo Soy) Cipriano Armenteros&quot;, part of a four-song saga about the fictional character recorded by Ray and Cruz, Ismael Miranda, and Blades himself.

==Gold record awards==
Ray and Cruz won a total of nine gold record awards during this period with hits such as:

* &quot;Aguzate&quot; (Get Wise);
* &quot;A Mi Manera&quot; (a remake of the French song My Way);
* &quot;Sonido Bestial&quot; (Beastly Sound);
* &quot;Amparo Arrebato&quot;
* &quot;El Diferente&quot; (The Different One), and
* &quot;Mi Bandera&quot; (My Flag, a non-controversial homage to the Puerto Rican flag that has become a patriotic and cultural reference in the country since)

==Return to Puerto Rico==
In 1970, Cruz and Ray opened a nightclub in San Juan, Puerto Rico. However they found that managing the club required too much of their time as they had a lot of other commitments to attend to and so decided that it would be much better if they sold the nightclub.

In addition to the duets, Cruz also sang solo when in 1972 he recorded &quot;Bobby Cruz canta para Tí&quot; (Bobby Cruz sings for You), produced by Richie Ray. He also reached No.1 in the Latin Music Hit Charts with &quot;&#x27;Ya ni te Acuerdas&quot;&quot; (You don&#x27;t even Remember).

In 1974, they won first place in the Festival of Orchestras for the composition &quot;La Zafra&quot;, whose lyrics describe the struggles of sugar cane workers in western Puerto Rico and elsewhere. Later that year Ray became a Christian convert. Initially Cruz refused to accept his friend&#x27;s change, however two months&#x27; later he himself became a convert.

As an experiment, they recorded what would become their most popular song, the salsa-merengue fusion &quot;Juan en la Ciudad&quot; (Juan in the City), in which Cruz&#x27;s lyrics narrate the Parable of the Prodigal Son. It became a huge salsa hit in Latino markets in the United States and in Latin America, mostly because of its catchy, danceable refrain/chorus. Two full albums followed with religious-themed songs. &quot;Pa&#x27; Atrás y Pa&#x27; Atrás&quot; (Backwards and Backwards) was a minor hit at the time.

==Christian salsa==
The change to a religious focus was not easy and they lost many of their fans and found opposition among the members of their own faith when they suggested the idea of Christian salsa. They stood their ground and little by little they started to regain the confidence of their fans and fellow Christians, when they recorded salsa songs with a religious message. However, so as to concentrate in their religious ministries, Ray and Cruz decided to record one last &quot;secular&quot; salsa song together: &quot;Adios a la Salsa&quot; (Goodbye to Salsa) was a farewell tribute to the style of music which gave them fame and fortune.

Ray and Cruz founded over 70 Christian churches during the time they retired from popular music, which lasted about 16 years. However, hardcore salsa fans constantly pressured them to return to secular work. After considerable reluctance (they feared alienating their religious followers), they gave away to fans&#x27; wishes, and played sold-out return concerts in Puerto Rico, Miami and New York, to their own surprise. Even when specifying that these joinings were to be sporadic and occasional, popular demand for their music remained constant; the Ray and Cruz orchestra played to sold-out crowds in the few tours that followed. They changed the lyrics of some of their old songs as to reflect their religious beliefs, particularly their old hits &quot;Agúzate&quot; (where its old santería references gave way to references to the Holy Spirit) and &quot;Lluvia&quot; (where an innocuous reference to a fool getting caught in the rain became a suggesting petition for the listener to convert to Christianity).

In 1996, Cruz published a book titled &quot;Cuando era un Niño&quot; (&quot;When I was a Child&quot;). In 1999, Richie Ray and Bobby Cruz held a concert in the Rubén Rodríguez Coliseum in Bayamón, where they sang some of their early hits together with some of their religious songs. The result was so impressive that they were offered a contract by Universal Records to record their concerts.

==Later years==
In 2000, Cruz and Ray held a series of concerts that were completely sold out at the Antonio Paoli Hall at the Luis A. Ferre Fine Arts Center in San Juan. They were also the main honorees at the Puerto Rican National Day of Salsa in Bayamón. In 2002, Bobby Cruz and Richie Ray were inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame.

Cruz and Ray currently continue their music and evangelical ministries. Ray occasionally plays Latin jazz as part of experimental musical collective La Orquesta Experimental. Occasionally, they perform &quot;secular&quot; salsa music (mostly in concerts), perhaps with less popularity than in their heyday, but still influencing a new generation of performers.

On April 19, 2008, Bobby Cruz was the pastor who pronounced the marriage vows between Jackie Guerrido and Don Omar in a ceremony held at the Ritz Carlton Hotel of San Juan. On August 16, 2008, Richie Ray &amp; Bobby Cruz celebrated 45 years in the musical business, with a concert at José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum. Prior to the presentation, the duo noted that the concert would last at least three hours. The duo has expressed that this might be their last &quot;big scale concert&quot;.

<doc id="1328216" wikidata="Q3327689" url="?curid=1328216" title="Multiple Maniacs">
<text>Multiple Maniacs is a 1970 independent American black comedy film composed, shot, edited, written, produced, and directed by John Waters, as his second feature film and first &quot;talkie&quot;. It features several actors who were part of the Dreamland acting troupe for Waters&#x27; films, including Divine, Mary Vivian Pearce, David Lochary, Mink Stole, Edith Massey, George Figgs, and Cookie Mueller. The plot follows a traveling troupe of sideshow freaks who rob their unsuspecting audience members.

A major restoration received national exhibition in August 2016, after initially screening in June at the Provincetown Film Festival.

==Plot==
Lady Divine (Divine) is the owner and operator of The Cavalcade of Perversion, a free exhibit of various perversions and fetish acts and obscenities, such as the &quot;Puke Eater&quot;. The show is free, but the various performers must persuade and even physically drag reluctant passersby to attend.

At the finale to every show, Lady Divine appears and robs the patrons at gunpoint. This arrangement seems successful to Mr. David (David Lochary), Lady Divine&#x27;s lover, but Lady Divine becomes bored with the routine and decides to murder the patrons rather than merely robbing them. After escaping the murder scene, she comes home to Cookie (Cookie Mueller), her prostitute daughter, and her new boyfriend Steve (Paul Swift), a member of the Weather Underground.

Lady Divine receives a call from Edith (Edith Massey), proprietor of the local bar, who informs her that Mr. David had been at her bar with another woman (Mary Vivian Pearce). Lady Divine heads there to catch them, but is raped on the way by two glue-sniffers. Meanwhile, Mr. David and his new lover Bonnie, a woman who desperately wants to be part of the troupe, engage in sex acts at the home he shares with Lady Divine, during which Bonnie anally penetrates him with a dildo.

While Lady Divine contemplates her rape, the Infant of Prague (Michael Renner Jr.) appears and leads her to a church. Making her way uncertainly into the church, Lady Divine prays, but is then approached and seduced by a strange young woman named Mink (Mink Stole). They have a sexual encounter in the church pew, with Mink inserting a rosary in Divine&#x27;s rectum while describing the Stations of the Cross.

Now lesbian lovers, Lady Divine and Mink go to Edith&#x27;s bar with the intent to kill Mr. David and his mistress, but they are too late: David and Bonnie, who have by this time decided that they have to kill Lady Divine to protect themselves, have left.

Mr. David returns to Cookie&#x27;s house, intent on killing Divine, but instead he finds Cookie and fellow Cavalcade performer Ricky (Rick Morrow) there. An argument ensues, and Bonnie accidentally kills Cookie. They tie up Ricky and hide Cookie&#x27;s corpse just before Divine and Mink return. When Bonnie tries to shoot Lady Divine, Divine attacks and kills her with a knife. She then turns on Mr. David and eviscerates him as well, cannibalizing his internal organs, and becoming even more frenzied. Ricky suddenly surprises Mink, who shoots him. In a fit of anger, Divine accuses Mink of betrayal and stabs her. Divine becomes even more crazed upon finding her daughter Cookie&#x27;s body hidden behind the couch.

Exhausted from the ordeal, Lady Divine collapses on a couch and is subsequently raped by a giant lobster. In the aftermath (mumbling &quot;You&#x27;re a maniac now, Divine&quot;), she destroys a car, then wanders Baltimore trying to kill anyone she can. The National Guard appear, surround Lady Divine on the street, and shoot her, to the tune of &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;.

==Production==
===Development===
Waters has said he was influenced by Herschell Gordon Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Two Thousand Maniacs!&quot; (1964) when writing the film, and the title &quot;Multiple Maniacs&quot; is a direct reference. The idea for &quot;Lobstora&quot;—the giant lobster that rapes Divine towards the end of the film—was derived from a combination of influences: Salvador Dalí; Jack Smith; a postcard for Provincetown, Massachusetts, that featured a lobster in the sky overlooking a beach; and taking LSD and cannabis.

===Filming===
Filming took place in Baltimore, Maryland. The scene in which Divine cannibalizes Mr. David&#x27;s innards was accomplished using a cow&#x27;s heart that Waters had purchased from a butcher two days prior and refrigerated. Lobstora was played by Vince Peranio and Peranio&#x27;s brother in a papier-mâché costume.

== Themes ==
=== Queerness and trash ===
Waters, in a 2016 interview regarding the re-release of the film, quoted as saying &quot;There was such a war going on then between the hippies and the straight world; and straight didn’t mean heterosexual... it meant you didn’t smoke pot or you didn’t think the revolution was going to happen.&quot; &quot;Multiple Maniacs&quot; has often been described as a camp movie. Guy Schaffer, a lecturer at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, describes camp aesthetics in queer cinema as a way of reappropriating and revaluing &quot;trash&quot; whilst still broadcasting the trashiness of what it glamorizes. The perceived trash in this case is not only the visual aesthetics but the main characters which are depicted as criminals, sodomites, cannibals, etc, the trash of society. This is evident as in the Cavalcade of Perversion, where &quot;puke eaters&quot; and &quot;actual queers kissing&quot; are part of the same spectacle and elicit the same guttural reactions from the &quot;straight&quot; audience. These depictions of filth reflect the sentiment social deviants such as queers might feel in reaction to society&#x27;s treatment of deviants. &quot;By forging a radical form of glamour based on a revaluation of trash and low culture, these performances refuse to value authenticity over artifice, beauty over ugliness, truth over trash.&quot;

At the end of the film, after being raped and beaten, Divine proclaims, &quot;I&#x27;m a &quot;maniac!&quot; A maniac that cannot be cured! O Divine, I am Di-&quot;vine&quot;!&quot; Although she might have been merely proclaiming her name, it is no accident that Divine was the chosen name of a character that seems to embody degeneracy itself. Divine draws power in these stories from the misfortune she faces, as every crime committed (against her or by her) pushes her further from society, prompting her to radicalize her behavior in retribution, which paradoxically grants her a sense of freedom from societal restraints. &quot;Multiple Maniacs&quot; is the intrinsic depiction of the perceived &quot;free queer&quot; in the 70s when the film was made—a sideshow attraction, a criminal, a junkie—yet it is also an intrinsic satire.

=== Religious imagery ===
John Waters has been described as the &quot;Pope of Trash,&quot; a reference to the role that religious imagery plays throughout his films. In &quot;Multiple Maniacs,&quot; Divine is part of a dysfunctional heterosexual relationship. After being assaulted once more, she awakens to the Infant of Prague by her side. The child leads her to a church where she has her first homosexual encounter: a &quot;rosary job&quot; performed by Mink Stole&#x27;s character. The sex scene is intercut with reenactments of the crucifixion. In a 2016 interview, Waters noted that the Catholic church is the only enemy he has left and that religion is so inherently anti-sex that it&#x27;s easy to sexualize it. Moreover, he describes that rosaries and other religious symbols were popular in counterculture movements during the era, such as goth. The scene itself was inspired by a rosary that Mink Stole wore off-camera.

==Release==
&quot;Multiple Maniacs&quot; had its world premiere at the First Unitarian Church in Baltimore on April 10, 1970. Waters later recalled that he toured the film throughout the United States, showing it at small arthouse theaters and other venues which often required a deposit to screen features. The film also showed internationally, with screenings in England in early 1971. In 2024, Waters recalled an incident where the Ontario Censor Board burnt a print of &quot;Multiple Maniacs&quot; that he sent for review.

===Critical response===
Upon the film&#x27;s debut in 1970, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;″s Lou Cedrone wrote: &quot;&quot;Multiple Maniacs&quot; is very smelly, save for a moment here and there when the Waters humor is apparent. And humor he has. It&#x27;s just a shame he has chosen to ignore that for the brutality which is not, as he and his audiences may think, a gas.&quot; In 1981, Geoffrey Himes, also of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, referred to the film as &quot;thoroughly disgusting&quot; yet &quot;also quite funny at times.&quot;

The film holds a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, Waters&#x27; highest-rated film on the site.

===2016 restoration===
A new restoration of &quot;Multiple Maniacs&quot; by American art house film distribution company Janus Films and video distribution company The Criterion Collection was previewed June 17, 2016 at the Provincetown Film Festival, and national exhibition began August 5, 2016 at the IFC Center in New York City.

The Criterion Collection released the restored print on Blu-ray and DVD on March 21, 2017, featuring a commentary track by Waters among other newly produced special features. This release marked the first time the film had been available on a home format in 30 years, since its original VHS release by Cinema Group in 1987.

==Box office==
&quot;Multiple Maniacs&quot; grossed $33,036 in North America.

<doc id="1328218" wikidata="Q1826421" url="?curid=1328218" title="Linea nigra">
<text>Linea nigra (Latin for &quot;black line&quot;), colloquially known as the pregnancy line, manifests as a linear area of heightened pigmentation frequently observed on the abdominal region during pregnancy. Typically spanning approximately one centimeter (0.4 in) in width, this brownish streak extends vertically along the midline of the abdomen, spanning from the pubis to the umbilicus. Variably, it may traverse from the pubis to the upper abdominal region.

For pregnant women, the emergence of linea nigra is attributed to an increased production of melanocyte-stimulating hormone by the placenta. This physiological phenomenon is concomitant with the occurrence of melasma and darkened nipples. Individuals with lighter skin pigmentation tend to exhibit this phenomenon less frequently in comparison to those possessing darker pigmentation. It is typical for the linea nigra to fade and dissipate within several months following childbirth.

Although predominantly associated with pregnancy, it can manifest in people of either sex and all ages. Beyond the gestational context, its prevalence is found to be uniformly elevated in either sex during the ages of 11 to 15. This is potentially attributable to hormonal fluctuations characteristic of puberty. After age 15, the prevalence of the linea nigra declines. Particularly in postpubescent people, it often serves as an indicator of elevated benign estrogens. The prevalence of this phenomenon drops below 10% following the age of 30. Furthermore, its appearance may ensue after rapid weight gain over a short interval. It could also rarely serve as an indicator of underlying hormonal imbalances, genetic disorders, malignancy, inflammation, or even fungal infections.

<doc id="1328219" wikidata="Q1660304" url="?curid=1328219" title="Imperial Teen">
<text>Imperial Teen is a San Francisco–based indie pop group made up of Roddy Bottum (Faith No More), primarily on guitar/vocals; Will Schwartz (also of Hey Willpower), primarily on guitar/vocals; Lynn Truell (née Perko, formerly of Sister Double Happiness, the Dicks, and the Wrecks), primarily on drums and backing vocals; and Jone Stebbins (previously of the Wrecks), primarily on bass and backing vocals. Imperial Teen became known for its boy–girl harmonies and for all four members switching off and on instruments during shows.

== History ==
Imperial Teen first gained notice with its debut album, &quot;Seasick&quot;, in 1996, which was produced by Steve McDonald (Redd Kross). &quot;Spin&quot; magazine went on to list it as the fourth-best album of the year and in the top 50 albums of all time. Of the &quot;queer alt-rockers Imperial Teen&quot;, one &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer wrote that &quot;though every song on the album is good, the best are the ones about homosexuality (&#x27;Butch&#x27;), Kurt Cobain (&#x27;You&#x27;re One&#x27;), and complete nonsense (&#x27;Imperial Teen&#x27;)&quot;. &quot;You&#x27;re One&quot; was the album&#x27;s breakout single, receiving heavy radio play on alternative stations; a promotional video was also produced for the song. Prior to the debut album&#x27;s release, the band was called Star 69, but was forced to change the name after a band from New York threatened to sue.

The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;What Is Not to Love&quot;, was released in 1998 and expanded the three-minute pop of &quot;Seasick&quot; with songs of over six minutes in length. A &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review of the album said that &quot;Imperial Teen still have this turf all to themselves, and they blast through the bubblegum riffs of &#x27;Birthday Girl&#x27;, &#x27;Year of the Tan&#x27; and &#x27;Lipstick&#x27;&quot;. Its single &quot;Yoo Hoo&quot; appeared on the soundtrack to &quot;Jawbreaker&quot;, starring Rose McGowan; McGowan also appeared alongside the band in the video for the song, which was included on the &quot;Jawbreaker&quot; DVD. To add authenticity to a parody scene in &quot;Not Another Teen Movie&quot;, &quot;Yoo Hoo&quot; is heard briefly during Jaime Pressly&#x27;s slow-motion entrance. &quot;Yoo Hoo&quot; was also heard at the beginnings of the &quot;Numbers&quot; season 4 episode &quot;Black Swan&quot; and the &quot;Daria&quot; season 3 episode &quot;Daria Dance Party&quot;.

The band toured throughout these years, and its success led to opening several dates in 1998 for Hole, fronted by Courtney Love, a friend and (briefly) former Faith No More bandmate of Roddy Bottum. Imperial Teen was also slated to be the opening act for one leg of the 1999 Marilyn Manson–Hole Beautiful Monsters Tour, but the tour ended after only a few March dates when Hole dropped out and Manson had to postpone dates due to an ankle injury. Imperial Teen ended up headlining a club tour instead.

A 1999 article in &quot;The Advocate&quot; said of the band, &quot;With lyrical allusions to wearing lipstick and male pronouns used to address love objects, Imperial Teen serves up a gay sensibility that ordinarily surfaces only from straight bands like Pulp or Pizzicato Five.&quot; Bottum (who came out as gay in 1993) noted, &quot;I think there&#x27;s a resistance from gay artists to go that route just because it&#x27;s so predictable. But it is annoying to see bands play it as safe as they do these days. That&#x27;s why something that visually screams as loud as Marilyn Manson is such a breath of fresh air.&quot;

Issues with support levels and label restructuring at Universal Records prompted Imperial Teen to switch to Merge Records for the 2002 release of its third album, &quot;On&quot;, which was produced by Steve McDonald (again) and Anna Waronker (of That Dog). The lead track, &quot;Ivanka&quot; (originally released on the &quot;Sweet and Touching&quot; 7-inch), received radio play. Imperial Teen toured with the Breeders in 2002 in support of the album. On July 31, 2002, the band played a gig at Maxwell&#x27;s in Hoboken, New Jersey, that was recorded for posterity and released three months later as the CD &quot;Live at Maxwell&#x27;s&quot;.

Will Schwartz joined with Tomo Yasuda for his dance side project Hey Willpower. The outfit, also including dancers Erin Rush and Justin Kelly, released a self-titled EP in 2005.

Imperial Teen returned on the live scene with two shows at the South by Southwest music festival in March 2007. The band released its first album in five years, &quot;The Hair the TV the Baby and the Band&quot;, in late August 2007 on Merge Records. It was later selected as the 38th-best record of 2007 by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine.

The band&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Feel the Sound&quot;, was released on January 31, 2012.

Jone Stebbins said in a 2017 interview that the band was preparing material for a sixth studio album, although the process is slowed down by their living far apart from one another. Roddy Bottum revealed in late 2018 that he was mixing a new Imperial Teen album. The album was released by Merge Records in June 2019, titled &quot;Now We Are Timeless&quot;.

<doc id="1328222" wikidata="Q5167087" url="?curid=1328222" title="Cookie Mueller">
<text>Dorothy Karen &quot;Cookie&quot; Mueller (March 2, 1949 – November 10, 1989) was an American actress, writer, and Dreamlander who starred in many of filmmaker John Waters&#x27; early films, including &quot;Multiple Maniacs&quot;, &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot;, &quot;Female Trouble&quot;, and &quot;Desperate Living&quot;.

== Early life ==
Cookie Mueller grew up with her parents Frank Lennert Mueller (d. 1984) and Anne (Sawyer) Mueller (d. 1995, aged 82) in the Baltimore suburbs in a house near the woods, a mental hospital and railroad tracks. She was nicknamed Cookie as a baby: &quot;Somehow I got the name Cookie before I could walk. It didn&#x27;t matter to me, they could call me whatever they wanted.&quot; During her childhood Cookie, along with her parents, brother Michael, and sister Judy, took road trips across the country:

In 1959, with eyes the same size, I got to see some of America traveling in the old green Plymouth with my parents, who couldn&#x27;t stand each other, and my brother and sister, who loved everyone. [Cookie&#x27;s brother Michael actually died in an accident on March 20, 1955.] I remember the Erie Canal on a dismal day, the Maine coastline in a storm, Georgia willow trees in the rain, and the Luray Caverns in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia where the stalagmites and -tites were poorly lit.

Mueller had many pets as a child, including many turtles (one named Fidel), a dog named Jip, snakes, and tadpoles. Cookie began to write at age 11, when she wrote a 321-page book about the Johnstown flood of 1889. She stapled it together, wrapped it in butcher paper and Saran wrap, and placed it on the shelves of a local library in what would have been its proper place. The book was never seen again.

With a swath of pivotal events in Mueller&#x27;s life—including her brother&#x27;s death at age 14, the result of climbing a dead tree, which collapsed on him in the woods near their home—she went on to pursue her writing, and in high school hung out with the hippie crowd. One of Mueller&#x27;s idiosyncrasies as a teen was that she constantly dyed her hair: &quot;&#x27;Whenever you&#x27;re depressed, just change your hair color,&#x27; she [her mother] always told me, years later, when I was a teenager: I was never denied a bottle of hair bleach or dye. In my closet there weren&#x27;t many clothes, but there were tons of bottles.&quot;

She took a small job at a Baltimore men&#x27;s department store and saved enough funds to head to Haight-Ashbury, where she continued the hippie lifestyle. Mueller traveled across the country, living with groups of vagrants, and settled in places such as Provincetown, Massachusetts; British Columbia; San Francisco; Pennsylvania; Jamaica; and Sicily.

==Career==
=== Film ===
In 1969, Mueller first met film director John Waters at the Baltimore premiere of his film &quot;Mondo Trasho&quot;. Mueller subsequently starred in Waters&#x27;s films, including a major role as Cookie the Spy in &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot;. She and Sharon Niesp, another Dreamlander, were lovers. In his book &quot;Shock Value&quot;, John Waters credits Mueller with the title for his 1974 film &quot;Female Trouble&quot;. When she was hospitalized for pelvic inflammatory disease in Provincetown, Waters and Mink Stole visited Mueller. &quot;What happened, Cook?&quot; Waters asked. &quot;Just a little female trouble, hon,&quot; she replied.

After her underground film status had faded, she moved to New York and became a writer, journalist, and columnist.

=== Author ===
Mueller wrote the health column &quot;Ask Dr. Mueller&quot; for the &quot;East Village Eye&quot; and later served as art critic for &quot;Details&quot;. Mueller&#x27;s books, &quot;How to Get Rid Of Pimples&quot; (with photos by David Armstrong, Nan Goldin, Peter Hujar) (1984, Top Stories #19-20); &quot;Ask Doctor Mueller&quot; (1996), a collection of her writings; &quot;Walking Through Clear Water in a Pool Painted Black&quot; (1990), a memoir; and &quot;Garden of Ashes&quot; (Hanuman Books, 1990) are cult classics. Other works include the novella &quot;Fan Mail, Frank Letters, and Crank Calls&quot; (Hanuman Books, 1988) and several collections of short prose.

== Personal life ==
Mueller was in a relationship with Sharon Niesp, an actress, singer and Provincetown fixture.

Mueller later married the Italian artist Vittorio Scarpati, who died of AIDS in September 1989.

== Death and legacy ==
Mueller died from AIDS-related pneumonia on November 10, 1989, at Cabrini Medical Center in New York City, aged 40. Her ashes are interred in multiple locations: on the beach near Provincetown; in the flowerbed of the Church of St. Luke in the Fields in Greenwich Village; alongside those of Vittorio and her dog Beauty in the Scarpati family crypt in Sorrento, Italy; under the statue of Christ the Redeemer atop Corcovado in Rio de Janeiro; in the South Bronx; and in the holy waters of the Ganges River. She was survived by her son, Max Wolfe Mueller, who appeared in &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot;.

The last of Mueller&#x27;s quotes, an elegy of her intent and existence, was written shortly before her death:

Fortunately I am not the first person to tell you that you will never die. You simply lose your body. You will be the same except you won&#x27;t have to worry about rent or mortgages or fashionable clothes. You will be released from sexual obsessions. You will not have drug addictions. You will not need alcohol. You will not have to worry about cellulite or cigarettes or cancer or AIDS or venereal disease. You will be free.

Nan Goldin created and widely exhibited &quot;The Cookie Portfolio 1976–1989&quot;, a series of 15 portraits, after Mueller&#x27;s death. One photograph, &quot;Cookie and Vittorio&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (1986), documents Mueller&#x27;s wedding to Vittorio Scarpati, an Italian artist and jewelry designer from Naples who died of AIDS just seven weeks before Mueller. Another of Goldin&#x27;s photographs, &quot;Cookie at Vittorio&#x27;s Casket, NYC, September 1989,&quot; was called a &quot;magnificent portrait ... a great image. Devastating but great,&quot; by the San Francisco Examiner&#x27;s art critic David Bonetti.

&quot;Edgewise: A Picture of Cookie Mueller&quot;, an oral history of Mueller&#x27;s life, was published in 2014.

She is one of many commemorated in the AIDS Quilt.

<doc id="1328223" wikidata="Q2502366" url="?curid=1328223" title="Buddhism in Singapore">
<text>Buddhism is the largest religion in Singapore, practiced by approximately 31.1% of the population as of 2020. As per the census, out of 3,459,093 Singaporeans polled, 1,074,159 of them identified themselves as Buddhists.

Buddhism was introduced in Singapore primarily by migrants from around the world over the past centuries. The first recorded histories of the Indian religion in Singapore can be observed in early monasteries and temples such as Thian Hock Keng and Jin Long Si Temple that were built by settlers that came from various parts of Asia.

There are a variety of Buddhist organizations in Singapore, with the more predominant authorities being established ones such as the Singapore Buddhist Federation (SBF).

==History==

Given the historic status of Singapore as a British trade port and colonial state, as well as a brief period of Japanese colonial rule during World War II, over the centuries a variety of Buddhist lineages from across the globe has appeared gradually on the island. They include Japanese and Western interpretations of the tripitaka, although a substantial local presence have their origins dating back into historic South East and East Asian kingdoms.

==Modern day==

Buddhists generally classify themselves as either from Theravāda Tradition or Mahāyāna Tradition. As the Singaporean Buddhist population is mostly ethnic Chinese people, they adhere to Chinese Buddhism (a Chinese form of Mahayana Buddhism).

===Institutions===
The first existing Sunday Dhamma School was organised by late Mahaweera Maha Nayaka Thero in 1940, the syllabus was set according to the standard of Young Men&#x27;s Buddhist Association (YMBA) of Colombo in Sri Lanka. In 1982, a 3-storey annex was built in Mangala Vihara to cater for the rapidly expanding Sunday Dhamma School. The Buddhist and Pali College of Singapore was set up in 1993 at Mangala Vihara, it is to cater for the religious and educational needs of Singaporeans who seek to widen and deepen their understanding and knowledge of Buddhism. Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery has also established another institution known as The Buddhist College of Singapore in 2006.

===Youth groups=== 
Buddhism in Singapore has been experiencing a revival after the implementation of Religious Knowledge as compulsory programme in all secondary schools from 1984 to 1989, There are youth groups set up in various Buddhist Temples and Centres like Wat Ananda Youth, Young Buddhist Chapter (YBC), Mangala Vihara Youth Circle, Singapore Buddhist Mission Youth and Buddhist Fellowship Youth etc. Buddhist societies are established in various tertiary institutions like NUS Buddhist Society (NUSBS), NTU Buddhist Society (NTUBS), SMU Dhamma Circle (SMUDC), SIM Buddhist Bhavana (SIMBB), Ngee Ann Polytechnic Buddhist Society (NPBS) and Singapore Polytechnic Buddhist Society (SPBS). There are also many foreign students in tertiary institutions joining and involving in these Buddhist societies.

===Buddhist events===
In the early eighties, Sri Lankan Buddhist monk and scholar Ven K. Sri Dhammananda and several other Buddhist monastic members were frequently invited to Singapore to conduct English public talks and forums. There were also some famous Chinese Mahayana monks from Taiwan that are invited to conduct Mandarin or Hokkien public talks at the same period too. Singapore Buddhist Youth Mission once organised a large Mandarin public talk in 1999 by Ven Hui Lui from Taiwan at Singapore Indoor Stadium.

Since Ajahn Brahm was invited to be the Spiritual Patron of the Buddhist Fellowship in Singapore, he has frequently conduct English public talks in various locations of Singapore like Chui Huay Lim Club, Singapore Conference Hall and Ren Ci Hospital auditorium. In recent years, several monks from Thai Forest Tradition have been invited to conduct public talks in Singapore; Ajahn Jayasaro was invited to conduct a teaching tour in Singapore in 2017 and Ajahn Sumedho was invited to conduct a public talk at the auditorium of Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery in 2019.

Since 2009, Buddhist film festivals were also organised in Singapore.

==Inter-faith==
Singapore is a society of diverse religious traditions. The Buddhist community in Singapore has contributed much to the Singapore society. One example is the Buddhist Free Clinic. The Buddhist Free Clinic has multiple outlets across Singapore, providing free healthcare services to the public, regardless of the patients&#x27; ethnicity or beliefs. This demonstrates how Buddhism is part of the religious fabric in Singapore and how multiple faiths in Singapore get along with one another.

==Controversies==
Venerable Ming Yi of Foo Hai Ch&#x27;an Monastery as of 2015 was imprisoned in a high-profile corruption scandal a few years ago. Ming Yi had been sentenced to 10 months in jail in November 2009 after being convicted on four charges of fraud, falsifying documents, misappropriating funds and giving false information to the Commissioner of Charities in 2008. Resulting from criminal charges and investigation, the Commissioner of Charities then suspended him from decision-making positions in Foo Hai Ch&#x27;an Monastery; Foo Hai Ch&#x27;an Buddhist Cultural and Welfare Association; Singapore Buddhist Free Clinic; the Singapore Regional Centre of the World Fellowship of Buddhists; and the Katho Temple.

Venerable Guo Jun, former abbot of the Mahabodhi Monastery in Bukit Timah, has drawn criticism for owning a property in Sydney worth more than A$500,000 (S$514,000) and for not wearing his monk&#x27;s robe on at least one occasion in public and staying in Marina Bay Sands (MBS) integrated resort. Guo Jun also faced a lawsuit from a trustee Lee Boon Teow of the monastery, who has filed a Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) report against him.

<doc id="1328229" wikidata="Q843469" url="?curid=1328229" title="Hokuriku Broadcasting Company">
<text>, also known as MRO, is a Japanese broadcast network affiliated with the Japan News Network (JNN). Their headquarters is located in Ishikawa Prefecture.

The &quot;MRO&quot; abbreviation is taken from the last letters of the call signs &quot;JOMR&quot; and &quot;JOMO&quot; of the Kanazawa and Nanao broadcasting stations, respectively. JOMO is no longer operational.

MRO functions as the default Japan News Network affiliate for the Fukui Prefecture, as that area doesn&#x27;t have a JNN affiliate of its own.

== Network ==
* TV: Japan News Network (JNN)
* RADIO: Japan Radio Network (JRN), National Radio Network (NRN)

== History ==

=== Early history ===
On December 24, 1948, the Ishikawa Prefectural government applied for a license to operate a commercial broadcaster under the name Hokuriku Cultural Broadcasting, and was the fourth Japanese company to apply to operate a commercial broadcaster. This application was later rejected due to Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers&#x27; media censorship.

After the establishment of the &quot;Three Radio Laws&quot; (Radio Law, Broadcasting Law, and Radio Supervisory Committee Establishment Law) in 1950, multiple license to operate a commercial broadcasting applications appear in various parts of Japan. The local newspaper Hokkoku Shimbun in Ishikawa Prefecture revived its plans to operate a new broadcaster.On February 10, 1951, Hokkoku Shimbun took the lead and the founders meeting were held.In April 21 of the same year, the Ministry of Posts granted 16 of the broadcast licenses and Hokuriku Cultural Broadcasting was listed. However, the broadcast area is limited to Ishikawa Prefecture, and does not include Toyama and Fukui prefectures, which are within the scope of the application.

=== Start as radio broadcaster ===
Two test radio broadcasts were launched: on April 22, 1952, at 9 amand on May 1 of the same year.At 6 am on May 10, 1952, Hokuriku Cultural Broadcasting was officially launched, becoming the first commercial radio broadcaster along the Sea of Japan.The broadcaster was initially located in the 4th floor of the Marukoshi Department Store in Kanazawa City.

On November 28, 1956, Hokuriku Culture Broadcasting changed its company name to Hokuriku Broadcasting. In order to strengthen the advertising business, Hokuriku Broadcasting, together with Kita Nippon Broadcasting and Fukui Broadcasting, formed the &quot;Hokuriku Radio Alliance&quot; on February 1, 1953, to increase income and reduce expenditure. Hokuriku Broadcasting achieved uninterrupted broadcasting throughout the day on May 1 of the same year, and achieved profit for the first time in June. In February 1954, Hokuriku Broadcasting realized its first stock dividend. At the end of 1955, Hokuriku Broadcasting set up a relay station in Nanao at the northern end of the Noto Peninsula, covering most of Ishikawa Prefecture. According to the first listening rate survey in November 1955, the listening rate of Hokuriku Broadcasting reached 56.8%, far exceeding the 39.3% of NHK Radio 1. Hokuriku Broadcasting changed the abbreviation from MR to MRO on January 1, 1956 (O is taken from the call sign JOMO of Nanao Broadcasting Bureau), and formulated a new trademark. On April 1 of the same year, Hokuriku Broadcasting began construction of a new headquarters in Takaoka-cho (now Korinbo), Kanazawa City. The building has five floors above ground and one floor underground, and was completed on December 7 of the same year.

===Jump to television===
Hokuriku Broadcasting applied for a TV broadcasting license on August 31, 1953. On October 22, 1957, Hokuriku Broadcasting obtained a TV pre-broadcast license. At 8:10 p.m. on November 6 of the following year, Hokuriku Broadcasting launched a TV test signal. On November 15, Hokuriku Broadcasting obtained the official TV broadcasting license. At 18:00 on November 17, Hokuriku Broadcasting began to broadcast TV programs.

At 11 a.m. on December 1, 1958, Hokuriku Broadcasting officially began broadcasting TV programs, becoming the first commercial TV station on the coast of the Sea of Japan in Honshu. Shortly after Hokuriku Broadcasting started, TV began to spread rapidly due to the wedding of Crown Prince Akihito. In December 1960, the TV penetration rate in Ishikawa Prefecture reached 34.6%. At the same time, according to the first ratings survey in May 1959, the average weekly ratings of Hokuriku Broadcasting reached 40.1%, surpassing the 34.1% of NHK General Television. At the same time as JNN was established, Hokuriku Broadcasting also became a founding member of JNN in August 1959. On August 2, 1960, the Hokuriku Broadcasting Union was established. Beginning in April 1962, Hokuriku Broadcasting began broadcasting educational programs for schoolchildren every Monday to Saturday morning. On July 22 of the same year, Hokuriku Broadcasting began broadcasting color TV. With the Nanao Broadcasting Bureau starting to broadcast TV signals in October 1962, the TV signals of Hokuriku Broadcasting were able to cover most of Ishikawa Prefecture.

The broadcast division of Hokuriku Broadcasting joined JRN in May 1965. In the mid-1960s, in response to the advertising competition plan caused by the opening of the new UHF station, Hokuriku Broadcasting and Kitanihon Broadcasting jointly proposed to the Hokuriku Radio Supervision Bureau in 1966 that the three prefectures of Hokuriku should be used as the same TV broadcasting area to expand the advertising market, but this idea failed to come true. To celebrate the 15th anniversary of its founding, Hokuriku Broadcasting published &quot;Ishikawa Prefecture Folklore&quot; in 1967, which included 484 ballads. In September 1967, Hokuriku Broadcasting began to build its third-generation headquarters Hokuriku Broadcasting Hall. In October of the following year, Hokuriku Broadcasting began to broadcast programs from the Hokuriku Broadcasting Hall. In August 1976, Hokuriku Broadcasting and Buffalo&#x27;s WBEN-TV (now WIVB-TV) signed a sister station agreement.

In July 1997, Hokuriku Broadcasting was exposed to the problem of fewer advertisements. In the five years since 1992, Hokuriku broadcast less than 2,659 advertisements of 181 companies that should have been broadcast; this incident led to Hokuriku Broadcasting being suspended by the Japanese private broadcasting union for one year . On July 1, 2006, Hokuriku Broadcasting began to broadcast digital TV signals. Hokuriku Broadcasting completely stopped broadcasting analog TV signals on July 24, 2011. On January 10, 2018, because the signal tower shared by Hokuriku Broadcasting and Ishikawa TV caught fire due to a lightning strike, the Kaga area and other places could not watch the programs of Hokuriku Broadcasting. Hokuriku Broadcasting set up a temporary antenna on January 18 to broadcast TV signals. On August 1 of the same year, the signal tower was completely repaired.

<text>Mary Vivian Pearce (born November 9, 1947) is an American actress. She has worked primarily in the films of John Waters.

== Life and career ==

Pearce is a childhood best friend of Waters and has appeared as an actress in all of his films. Because of her work with Waters, she is considered one of the Dreamlanders, Waters&#x27; ensemble of regular cast and crew members. Along with Mink Stole and Pat Moran, she is one of only three actors to appear in all of his films to date. Pearce is always credited by her real name, but in her personal life, she is known as Bonnie. Her first film with Waters, in 1964, was a 17-minute independent short film called &quot;Hag in a Black Leather Jacket&quot;. The film was never released. In the rest of Waters&#x27; films, she&#x27;s played both main and bit parts.

Her most famous roles were in Waters&#x27; &quot;Mondo Trasho&quot;, &quot;Multiple Maniacs&quot;, &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot;, &quot;Female Trouble&quot; and &quot;Desperate Living&quot;. However, as the years progressed, Pearce appeared less and less in Waters&#x27; films, usually as an extra or a character without a major impact on the plot. She continues to appear in Waters&#x27; films; she appeared as a protester in &quot;Cecil B. Demented&quot; just weeks after brain surgery.

== Personal life ==
At the age of eighteen, Pearce was married to a jockey who worked at Saratoga. In an interview with Gerald Peary, Pearce explained that she left for Provincetown to live with Waters and his then-girlfriend, Mona Montgomery:
I was 18, and it was three months after I got married. My husband was a jockey at Saratoga, and he told my father I&#x27;d left him and run off with beatniks. I was so pissed at him for telling! As far as I was concerned, it was a fake marriage to get me out of the house. I&#x27;d taken all our wedding presents back and bought books and records.
Pearce&#x27;s alma mater is Goucher College. She has a graduate degree in creative writing. She lives in Baltimore, Maryland, with her sister and brother-in-law.

<text>Cradle of Fear is a 2001 British horror film, directed by Alex Chandon. It was released direct-to-video on 4 July 2001. Taking inspiration from the anthology films produced by Amicus Productions in the 1970s, it features three separate half-hour segments, linked by a fourth story. The main narrative involves imprisoned serial killer Kemper wreaking vengeance on those responsible for his capture. This he does through his son: Dani Filth playing an unnamed character referred to in the credits as &quot;The Man&quot;.

Shot on video and on a very low budget, the film received a lukewarm reception in the horror press, and is chiefly of interest to Cradle of Filth fans, as it features the entire lineup (principally Dani, but the rest crop up in cameo roles) from the band&#x27;s &quot;Midian&quot; era. Chandon&#x27;s association with Cradle of Filth began with the promo video for &quot;From the Cradle to Enslave&quot;, and he went on to direct the clips for &quot;Her Ghost in the Fog&quot; and &quot;No Time to Cry&quot;, plus some DVD documentaries. Kemper is played by David McEwen, who also appeared in the video for &quot;Her Ghost in the Fog&quot;, miming to Doug Bradley&#x27;s narration.

== Plot ==
The opening scene sees &quot;The Man&quot; being approached and attacked by two muggers in a dark alley of London. As the muggers check their seemingly unconscious victim for cash, The Man regains consciousness and brutally kills them. Around that time, Inspector Peter Neilson is investigating the apparent murder scene of the young Melissa and Nikki. In a flashback, the two girls are shown in a goth club looking to pick up men. Melissa spotted The Man and took him home. After spending the night with him, she began hallucinating about the people around turning to her with monstrous faces and voices. Melissa went to Nikki&#x27;s house to seek help, then a creature burst out of Melissa&#x27;s womb and attacked Nikki, killing both.

Sophie and Emma break into a house in a burglary attempt. When Emma finds a box of money under a bed, a bony old man pops up from the bedcovers and attacks her. The girls stab and bludgeon the old man multiple times before he finally dies. Intending to keep the loot to herself and seeing Emma as a liability for revealing their plan to her sister, Sophie kills Emma and runs home. There, the re-animated bodies of Emma and the old man appear and stab Sophie to death.

As the dead bodies are identified, Inspector Neilson links them to an earlier case he had solved in the past. The case involved a man named Kemper, former hypnotist and son of an infamous Satanist. Kemper had been using his skills to manipulate, abduct and kill children for over 25 years until he was apprehended by Neilson, tried and committed to a lunatic asylum. Neilson&#x27;s boss has Kemper transferred to another facility so that his cell can be investigated.

Nick Holland is an amputee who is unable to engage in sexual activity with his girlfriend Natalie due to his frustration with the loss of his left leg in a prior accident. Nick visits his old friend Thomas and shoots him in the head. He then removes Thomas&#x27; left leg, puts it on ice and has it transplanted to himself by his doctor overnight. Nick goes through rehabilitation and eventually becomes able to move his transplanted leg. One night, while driving with Natalie, Nick loses control of his leg which steps on the accelerator, resulting in a crash that instantly kills Natalie. As two policemen arrive on the scene, they witness Nick stab himself to death, then The Man appears and kills them both. Meanwhile, a hit list is found in Kemper&#x27;s old cell, containing the names and addresses of those responsible for his capture and their relatives, including the recent victims and Neilson himself. During his confinement, Kemper had also managed to give a copy of the list to The Man.

Richard is a reporter with a morbid obsession for extreme pornography and snuff films. He is chastised by his employer for misusing the work computer. Real footage of the Chechclear beheading plays on his computer screen. One day he finds a website offering real-time footage of people being attacked and tortured on commands issued by remote users. Richard&#x27;s escalating obsession with the website causes him to lose his job and, eventually, his house. While attempting to log into the site from an internet cafe, he receives an email from an anonymous sender who reveals the location of the house where the live footage is filmed. Upon reaching the house, Richard is taken by the homeowner to the supposed location of the filming equipment, but instead he finds himself on the set of the snuff filming, where he is murdered by two masked men upon orders issued remotely by The Man. As his body is found and identified, Richard is revealed to be Neilson&#x27;s son.

Determined to avenge his son and end the streak of killings, Neilson goes to the facility where Kemper is held and forces the staff to take him to Kemper&#x27;s cell at gunpoint. He shoots Kemper in a leg and arm, but is immobilised by reinforcement guards before he can kill him. The Man, disguised as one of the guards, uses a machete to kill the director of the facility and the remaining guards, and is now revealed to be Kemper&#x27;s son. Neilson shoots The Man, blowing half his head off, then delivers the fatal gunshot to Kemper. The Man however gets back on his feet and, with claws and tentacles emerging from the remaining half of his head, supposedly kills Neilson off-camera.

==Production==
== Release ==

&quot;Cradle of Fear&quot; has a chequered release history. Aside from the festival and convention circuit, the film never saw a cinema screen, and was released straight to video.

The UK distributors initially made it available as a mail order VHS title, on the grounds that this would allow the release of an uncut and unrated version, posted out from Europe and circumventing the BBFC (the assumption being that the BBFC would not pass the film without significant alterations). After long delays, these tapes were finally sent out, but, much to the producers&#x27; embarrassment, the film was passed completely uncut by the BBFC barely a month later, and picked up for exclusive distribution on DVD by the Blockbuster chain, who immediately sold it at a fraction of the price of the mail order tapes.

In 2006 the HMV chain signed an agreement with Pragmatic Pictures for UK distribution of the DVD version, which subsequently entered HMV&#x27;s DVD Top 10 chart. The film is now widely available on DVD.

==Reception==

Critical reception for the film has been mixed to positive.

Adam Tyner from DVD Talk gave the film a mixed review stating that knowing that each character would meet their demise got in the way of any suspense. &quot;Digital Retribution&quot; gave the film a negative review, criticizing the film&#x27;s poor execution, and overlong running time, calling the film a huge disappointment. Empire awarded the film four out of five stars, praising the film&#x27;s creature effects and gore effects calling the film a must see for gore fans. &quot;Horror News.net&quot; gave the film a positive review praising the film&#x27;s clever writing, acting, and gore effects calling the film&#x27;s gore scenes &quot;both terrifying and visceral&quot;. Bloody Disgusting awarded the film a score of 4 out of 5, complimenting the film&#x27;s writing, music, performances, and frantic camerawork.

<doc id="1328236" wikidata="Q130754" url="?curid=1328236" title="2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami">
<text>On 26 December 2004, at 07:58:53 local time (UTC+7), a major earthquake with a magnitude of 9.2–9.3 struck with an epicentre off the west coast of Aceh in northern Sumatra, Indonesia. The undersea megathrust earthquake, known by the scientific community as the Sumatra–Andaman earthquake, was caused by a rupture along the fault between the Burma plate and the Indian plate, and reached a Mercalli intensity of IX in some areas.

A massive tsunami with waves up to high, known as the Boxing Day Tsunami after the Boxing Day holiday, or as the Asian Tsunami, devastated communities along the surrounding coasts of the Indian Ocean, killing an estimated 227,898 people in 14 countries, violently in Aceh (Indonesia), and severely in Sri Lanka, Tamil Nadu (India), and Khao Lak (Thailand). The direct results caused major disruptions to living conditions and commerce in coastal provinces of surrounded countries. It is the deadliest natural disaster of the 21st century, one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history, and the worst tsunami disaster in history. It is also the worst natural disaster in the history of Indonesia, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand. Along with the 2010 Haiti earthquake, it is a contender for the deadliest natural disaster of the decade.

It was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Asia, the most powerful earthquake in the 21st century, and at least the third most powerful earthquake ever recorded in the world since modern seismography began in 1900. It had the longest fault rupture ever observed, between 1,200 km and 1,300 km (720 mi and 780 mi), and had the longest duration of faulting ever observed, at least ten minutes. It caused the planet to vibrate as much as , and also remotely triggered earthquakes as far away as Alaska. Its epicentre was between Simeulue and mainland Sumatra. The plight of the affected people and countries prompted a worldwide humanitarian response, with donations totalling more than US$14 billion (equivalent to US$ billion in currency).

==Earthquake==
The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was initially documented as having a moment magnitude of 8.8. The United States Geological Survey has its estimate of 9.1. Hiroo Kanamori of the California Institute of Technology estimates that 9.2 is best representative of the earthquake&#x27;s size. More recent studies estimate the magnitude to be 9.3. A 2016 study estimated the magnitude to be 9.25, while a 2021 study revised its 2007 estimate of 9.1 to a new magnitude of 9.2.

The hypocentre of the main earthquake was approximately off the western coast of northern Sumatra, in the Indian Ocean just north of Simeulue island at a depth of below mean sea level (initially reported as ). The northern section of the Sunda megathrust ruptured over a length of . The earthquake (followed by the tsunami) was felt in Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, Sri Lanka and the Maldives. Splay faults, or secondary &quot;pop up faults&quot;, caused long, narrow parts of the seafloor to pop up in seconds. This quickly elevated the height and increased the speed of waves, destroying the nearby Indonesian town of Lhoknga.

Indonesia lies between the Pacific Ring of Fire along the north-eastern islands adjacent to New Guinea, and the Alpide belt that runs along the south and west from Sumatra, Java, Bali, Flores to Timor. The 2002 Sumatra earthquake is believed to have been a foreshock, preceding the main event by over two years.

=== Historical comparisons ===

Great earthquakes, such as the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, are associated with megathrust events in subduction zones. Their seismic moments can account for a significant fraction of the global seismic moment across century-scale periods. Of all the moment released by earthquakes in the 100 years from 1906 through 2005, roughly one eighth was due to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. This quake, together with the Great Alaskan earthquake (1964) and the Great Chilean earthquake (1960), account for almost half of the total moment.

Since 1900, the only earthquakes recorded with a greater magnitude were the 1960 Chile earthquake (magnitude 9.5) and the 1964 Alaska earthquake in Prince William Sound (magnitude 9.2). The only other recorded earthquakes of magnitude 9.0 or greater were off Kamchatka, Russia, on 5 November 1952 (magnitude 9.0) and Tōhoku, Japan (magnitude 9.1) in March 2011. Each of these megathrust earthquakes also spawned tsunamis in the Pacific Ocean. In comparison to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, the death toll from these earthquakes and tsunamis was significantly lower, primarily because of the lower population density along the coasts near affected areas.

Comparisons with earlier earthquakes are difficult, as earthquake strength was not measured systematically until the 1930s. However, historical earthquake strength can sometimes be estimated by examining historical descriptions of the damage caused, and the geological records of the areas where they occurred. Some examples of significant historical megathrust earthquakes are the 1868 Arica earthquake in Peru and the 1700 Cascadia earthquake in western North America.

===Tectonic plates===
The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was unusually large in geographical and geological extent. An estimated of fault surface slipped (or ruptured) about along the subduction zone where the Indian plate slides under (or subducts) the overriding Burma plate. The slip did not happen instantaneously but took place in two phases over several minutes: Seismographic and acoustic data indicate that the first phase involved a rupture about long and wide, beneath the sea bed—the largest rupture ever known to have been caused by an earthquake. The rupture proceeded at about , beginning off the coast of Aceh and proceeding north-westerly over about 100 seconds. After a pause of about another 100 seconds, the rupture continued northwards towards the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The northern rupture occurred more slowly than in the south, at about , continuing north for another five minutes to a plate boundary where the fault type changes from subduction to strike-slip (the two plates slide past one another in opposite directions).

The Indian plate is part of the Indo-Australian plate, which underlies the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal, and is moving north-east at an average of . The India Plate meets the Burma plate (which is considered a portion of the great Eurasian plate) at the Sunda Trench. At this point, the India Plate subducts beneath the Burma plate, which carries the Nicobar Islands, the Andaman Islands, and northern Sumatra. The India Plate sinks deeper and deeper beneath the Burma plate until the increasing temperature and pressure drive volatiles out of the subducting plate. These volatiles rise into the overlying plate, causing partial melting and the formation of magma. The rising magma intrudes into the crust above and exits the Earth&#x27;s crust through volcanoes in the form of a volcanic arc. The volcanic activity that results as the Indo-Australian plate subducts the Eurasian plate has created the Sunda Arc.

As well as the sideways movement between the plates, the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake resulted in a rise of the seafloor by several metres, displacing an estimated of water and triggering devastating tsunami waves. The waves radiated outwards along the entire length of the rupture (acting as a line source). This greatly increased the geographical area over which the waves were observed, reaching as far as Mexico, Chile, and the Arctic. The raising of the seafloor significantly reduced the capacity of the Indian Ocean, producing a permanent rise in the global sea level by an estimated .

===Aftershocks and other earthquakes===

Numerous aftershocks were reported off the Andaman Islands, the Nicobar Islands and the region of the original epicentre in the hours and days that followed. The magnitude 8.6 2005 Nias–Simeulue earthquake, which originated off the coast of the Sumatran island of Nias, is not considered an aftershock, despite its proximity to the epicentre, and was most likely triggered by stress changes associated with the 2004 event. The earthquake produced its own aftershocks (some registering a magnitude of as high as 6.9) and presently ranks as the third-largest earthquake ever recorded on the moment magnitude or Richter scale.

Other aftershocks of up to magnitude 7.2 continued to shake the region daily for three or four months. As well as continuing aftershocks, the energy released by the original earthquake continued to make its presence felt well after the event. A week after the earthquake, its reverberations could still be measured, providing valuable scientific data about the Earth&#x27;s interior.

The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake came just three days after a magnitude 8.1 earthquake in the sub-antarctic Auckland Islands, an uninhabited region west of New Zealand, and Macquarie Island to Australia&#x27;s north. This is unusual since earthquakes of magnitude eight or more occur only about once per year on average. The U.S. Geological Survey sees no evidence of a causal relationship between these events.

The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake is thought to have triggered activity in both Leuser Mountain and Mount Talang, volcanoes in Aceh along the same range of peaks, while the 2005 Nias–Simeulue earthquake sparked activity in Lake Toba, a massive caldera in Sumatra.

===Energy released===

The energy released on the Earth&#x27;s surface (&quot;M&quot;e, the energy magnitude, which is the &quot;seismic potential for damage&quot;) by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was estimated at 1.1 joules.

The earthquake generated a seismic oscillation of the Earth&#x27;s surface of up to , equivalent to the effect of the tidal forces caused by the Sun and Moon. The seismic waves of the earthquake were felt across the planet, as far away as the U.S. state of Oklahoma, where vertical movements of were recorded. By February 2005, the earthquake&#x27;s effects were still detectable as a complex harmonic oscillation of the Earth&#x27;s surface, which gradually diminished and merged with the incessant free oscillation of the Earth more than four months after the earthquake.
Because of its enormous energy release and shallow rupture depth, the earthquake generated remarkable seismic ground motions around the globe, particularly due to huge Rayleigh (surface) elastic waves that exceeded in vertical amplitude everywhere on Earth. The record section plot displays vertical displacements of the Earth&#x27;s surface recorded by seismometers from the IRIS/USGS Global Seismographic Network plotted with respect to time (since the earthquake initiation) on the horizontal axis, and vertical displacements of the Earth on the vertical axis (note the 1 cm scale bar at the bottom for scale). The seismograms are arranged vertically by distance from the epicentre in degrees. The earliest, lower amplitude signal is that of the compressional (P) wave, which takes about 22 minutes to reach the other side of the planet (the antipode; in this case near Ecuador). The largest amplitude signals are seismic surface waves that reach the antipode after about 100 minutes. The surface waves can be clearly seen to reinforce near the antipode (with the closest seismic stations in Ecuador), and to subsequently encircle the planet to return to the epicentral region after about 200 minutes. A major aftershock (magnitude 7.1) can be seen at the closest stations starting just after the 200-minute mark. The aftershock would be considered a major earthquake under ordinary circumstances but is dwarfed by the mainshock.

The shift of mass and the massive release of energy slightly altered the Earth&#x27;s rotation. Weeks after the earthquake, theoretical models suggested the earthquake shortened the length of a day by 2.68 microseconds, due to a decrease in the oblateness of the Earth. It also caused the Earth to minutely &quot;wobble&quot; on its axis by up to in the direction of 145° east longitude, or perhaps by up to . Because of tidal effects of the Moon, the length of a day increases at an average of 15 microseconds per year, so any rotational change due to the earthquake will be lost quickly. Similarly, the natural Chandler wobble of the Earth, which in some cases can be up to , eventually offset the minor wobble produced by the earthquake.

There was movement laterally and vertically along the fault line. Early speculation was that some of the smaller islands south-west of Sumatra, which is on the Burma plate (the southern regions are on the Sunda plate), might have moved south-west by up to , but more accurate data released more than a month after the earthquake found the movement to be about . Since movement was vertical as well as lateral, some coastal areas may have been moved to below sea level. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands appear to have shifted south-west by around and to have sunk by .
In February 2005, the Royal Navy vessel surveyed the seabed around the earthquake zone, which varies in depth between . The survey, conducted using a high-resolution, multi-beam sonar system, revealed that the earthquake had made a considerable impact on the topography of the seabed. thrust ridges created by previous geologic activity along the fault had collapsed, generating landslides several kilometres wide. One such landslide consisted of a single block of rock some high and long. The momentum of the water displaced by tectonic uplift had also dragged massive slabs of rock, each weighing millions of tonnes, as far as across the seabed. An oceanic trench several kilometres wide was exposed in the earthquake zone.

The TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1 satellites happened to pass over the tsunami as it was crossing the ocean. These satellites carry radars that measure precisely the height of the water surface; anomalies in the order of were measured. Measurements from these satellites may prove invaluable for the understanding of the earthquake and tsunami. Unlike data from tide gauges installed on shores, measurements obtained in the middle of the ocean can be used for computing the parameters of the source earthquake without having to compensate for the complex ways in which proximity to the coast changes the size and shape of a wave.

=== Assessment of potential earthquakes in the future ===

Before the 2004 quake there were three arguments against a large earthquake occurring in the Sumatra region. After the quake it was considered that earthquake hazard risk would need to be reassessed for regions previously thought to have low risk based on these criteria:

#The subducting plate at the location of the 2004 quake is older and more dense. Before the 2004 earthquake it was thought that only the subduction of young and buoyant crust could produce giant earthquakes.
#Slow plate motion. Previously it was thought that the convergence rate had to be fast.
#Before the 2004 quake it was thought that giant earthquakes only occurred in regions without back-arc basins.

==Tsunami==

The sudden vertical rise of the seabed by several metres during the earthquake displaced massive volumes of water, resulting in a tsunami that struck the coasts of the Indian Ocean. A tsunami that causes damage far away from its source is sometimes called a teletsunami and is much more likely to be produced by the vertical motion of the seabed than by horizontal motion.

The tsunami, like all the others, behaved differently in deep water than in shallow water. In deep ocean water, tsunami waves form only a low, broad hump, barely noticeable and harmless, which generally travels at the high speed of ; in shallow water near coastlines, a tsunami slows down to only tens of kilometres per hour but, in doing so, forms large destructive waves. Scientists investigating the damage in Aceh found evidence that the wave reached a height of when coming ashore along large stretches of the coastline, rising to in some areas when travelling inland. Radar satellites recorded the heights of tsunami waves in deep water: the maximum height was at two hours after the earthquake, the first such observations ever made.

According to Tad Murty, vice-president of the Tsunami Society, the total energy of the tsunami waves was equivalent to about , which is more than twice the total explosive energy used during all of World War II (including the two atomic bombs) but still a couple of orders of magnitude less than the energy released in the earthquake itself. In many places, the waves reached as far as inland.

Because the fault affected by the earthquake was in a nearly north–south orientation, the greatest strength of the tsunami waves was in an east–west direction. Bangladesh, which lies at the northern end of the Bay of Bengal, had few casualties despite being a low-lying country relatively near the epicentre. It also benefited from the fact that the earthquake proceeded more slowly in the northern rupture zone, greatly reducing the energy of the water displacements in that region.
Coasts that have a landmass between them and the tsunami&#x27;s location of origin are usually safe; however, tsunami waves can sometimes diffract around such landmasses. Thus, the state of Kerala was hit by the tsunami despite being on the western coast of India, and the western coast of Sri Lanka suffered substantial impacts. Distance alone was no guarantee of safety, as Somalia was hit harder than Bangladesh despite being much farther away.

Because of the distances involved, the tsunami took anywhere from fifteen minutes to seven hours to reach the coastlines. The northern regions of the Indonesian island of Sumatra were hit quickly, while Sri Lanka and the east coast of India were hit roughly 90 minutes to two hours later. Thailand was struck about two hours later despite being closer to the epicentre because the tsunami travelled more slowly in the shallow Andaman Sea off its western coast.

The tsunami was noticed as far as Struisbaai in South Africa, about away, where a tide surged on shore about 16 hours after the earthquake. It took a relatively long time to reach Struisbaai at the southernmost point of Africa, probably because of the broad continental shelf off South Africa and because the tsunami would have followed the South African coast from east to west. The tsunami also reached Antarctica, where tidal gauges at Japan&#x27;s Showa Base recorded oscillations of up to a metre (), with disturbances lasting a couple of days.

Some of the tsunami&#x27;s energy escaped into the Pacific Ocean, where it produced small but measurable tsunamis along the western coasts of North and South America, typically around . At Manzanillo, Mexico, a crest-to-trough tsunami was measured. As well, the tsunami was large enough to be detected in Vancouver, which puzzled many scientists, as the tsunamis measured in some parts of South America were larger than those measured in some parts of the Indian Ocean. It has been theorized that the tsunamis were focused and directed at long ranges by the mid-ocean ridges which run along the margins of the continental plates.

===Early signs and warnings===

Despite a delay of up to several hours between the earthquake and the impact of the tsunami, nearly all of the victims were taken by surprise. There were no tsunami warning systems in the Indian Ocean to detect tsunamis or to warn the general population living around the ocean. Tsunami detection is difficult because while a tsunami is in deep water, it has little height and a network of sensors is needed to detect it.

Tsunamis are more frequent in the Pacific Ocean than in other oceans because of earthquakes in the &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;. Although the extreme western edge of the Ring of Fire extends into the Indian Ocean (the point where the earthquake struck), no warning system exists in that ocean. Tsunamis there are relatively rare despite earthquakes being relatively frequent in Indonesia. The last major tsunami was caused by the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa. Not every earthquake produces large tsunamis: on 28 March 2005, a magnitude 8.7 earthquake hit roughly the same area of the Indian Ocean but did not result in a major tsunami.

The first warning sign of a possible tsunami is the earthquake itself. However, tsunamis can strike thousands of kilometres away where the earthquake is felt only weakly or not at all. Also, in the minutes preceding a tsunami strike, the sea sometimes recedes temporarily from the coast, which was observed on the eastern earthquake rupture zone such as the coastlines of Aceh, Phuket island and Khao Lak in Thailand, Penang island in Malaysia, and the Andaman and Nicobar islands. This rare sight reportedly induced people, especially children, to visit the coast to investigate and collect stranded fish on as much as of exposed beach, with fatal results. However, not all tsunamis cause this &quot;disappearing sea&quot; effect. In some cases, there are no warning signs at all: the sea will suddenly swell without retreating, surprising many people and giving them little time to flee.

One of the few coastal areas to evacuate ahead of the tsunami was on the Indonesian island of Simeulue, close to the epicentre. Island folklore recounted an earthquake and tsunami in 1907, and the islanders fled to inland hills after the initial shaking and before the tsunami struck. These tales and oral folklore from previous generations may have helped the survival of the inhabitants. On Maikhao Beach in north Phuket City, Thailand, a 10-year-old British tourist named Tilly Smith had studied tsunamis in geography at school and recognised the warning signs of the receding ocean and frothing bubbles. She and her parents warned others on the beach, which was evacuated safely. John Chroston, a biology teacher from Scotland, also recognised the signs at Kamala Bay north of Phuket, taking a busload of vacationers and locals to safety on higher ground.

Anthropologists had initially expected the aboriginal population of the Andaman Islands to be badly affected by the tsunami and even feared the already depopulated Onge tribe could have been wiped out. Many of the aboriginal tribes evacuated and suffered fewer casualties, however. Oral traditions developed from previous earthquakes helped the aboriginal tribes escape the tsunami. For example, the folklore of the Onges talks of &quot;huge shaking of ground followed by high wall of water&quot;. Almost all of the Onge people seemed to have survived the tsunami.

===Indonesia===

====Aceh====
The tsunami devastated the coastline of Aceh province, about 20 minutes after the earthquake. Banda Aceh, the closest major city, suffered severe casualties. The sea receded and exposed the seabed, prompting locals to collect stranded fish and explore the area. Local eyewitnesses described three large waves, with the first wave rising gently to the foundation of the buildings, followed minutes later by a sudden withdrawal of the sea near the port of Ulèë Lheue. This was succeeded by the appearance of two large black-coloured steep waves which then travelled inland into the capital city as a large turbulent bore. Eyewitnesses described the tsunami as a &quot;black giant&quot;, &quot;mountain&quot; and a &quot;wall of water&quot;. Video footage revealed torrents of black water, surging by windows of a two-story residential area situated about inland. Additionally, amateur footage recorded in the middle of the city captured an approaching black surge flowing down the city streets, full of debris, inundating them.

The level of destruction was extreme on the northwestern areas of the city, immediately inland of the aquaculture ponds, and directly facing the Indian Ocean. The tsunami height was reduced from at Ulee Lheue to a further to the north-east. The inundation was observed to extend inland throughout the city. Within of the shoreline, houses, except for strongly-built reinforced concrete ones with brick walls, which seemed to have been partially damaged by the earthquake before the tsunami attack, were swept away or destroyed by the tsunami. The area toward the sea was wiped clean of nearly every structure, while closer to the river, dense construction in a commercial district showed the effects of severe flooding. The flow depth at the city was just at the level of the second floor, and there were large amounts of debris piled along the streets and in the ground-floor storefronts. In the seaside section of Ulee Lheue, the flow depths were over . Footage showed evidence of back-flowing of the Aceh River, carrying debris and people from destroyed villages at the coast and transporting them up to inland.

A group of small islands: Weh, Breueh, Nasi, Teunom, Bunta, Lumpat, and Batee lie just north of the capital city. The tsunami reached a run-up of on the western shorelines of Breueh Island and Nasi Island. Coastal villages were destroyed by the waves. On Weh Island, strong surges were experienced in the port of Sabang, yet there was little damage with reported runup values of , most likely due to the island being sheltered from the direct attack by the islands to the south-west.

Lhoknga is a small coastal community about south-west of Banda Aceh, located on a flat coastal plain in between two rainforest-covered hills, overlooking a large bay and famous for its large swathe of white sandy beach and surfing activities. The locals reported 10 to 12 waves, with the second and third being the highest and most destructive. Interviews with the locals revealed that the sea temporarily receded and exposed coral reefs. In the distant horizon, gigantic black waves about high made explosion-like sounds as they broke and approached the shore. The first wave came rapidly landward from the south-west as a turbulent bore about high. The second and third waves were high at the coast and appeared like gigantic surfing waves but &quot;taller than the coconut trees and was like a mountain&quot;. The second wave was the largest; it came from the west-southwest within five minutes of the first wave. The tsunami stranded cargo ships, barges and destroyed a cement mining facility near the Lampuuk coast, where it reached the fourth level of the building.

Meulaboh, a remote coastal city, was among the hardest hit by the tsunami. The waves arrived after the sea receded about , followed by an advancing small tsunami. The second and third destructive waves arrived later, which exceeded the height of the coconut trees. The inundation distance is about . Other towns on Aceh&#x27;s west coast hit by the disaster included Leupung, Lhokruet, Lamno, Patek, Calang, and Teunom. Affected or destroyed towns on the region&#x27;s north and east coast were Pidie Regency, Samalanga, Panteraja, and Lhokseumawe. The high fatality rate in the area was mainly due to lack of preparation of the community towards a tsunami and limited knowledge and education among the population regarding the natural phenomenon. Helicopter surveys revealed entire settlements virtually destroyed, with destruction extending miles inland. Only a few mosques remained standing.

The greatest run-up height of the tsunami was measured at a hill between Lhoknga and Leupung, on the western coast of the northern tip of Sumatra, near Banda Aceh, and reached .

The tsunami heights in Sumatra:
* on the west coast of Aceh
* on the Banda Aceh coast
* on the Krueng Raya coast
* on the Sigli coast
* on the north coast of Weh Island directly facing the tsunami source
* on the opposite side of the coast of Weh Island facing the tsunami

===Sri Lanka===

The island country of Sri Lanka, located about from Sumatra, was ravaged by the tsunami around two hours after the earthquake. The tsunami first struck the eastern coastline and subsequently refracted around the southern point of Sri Lanka (Dondra Head). The refracted tsunami waves then inundated the southwestern part of Sri Lanka after some of its energy was reflected from impact with the Maldives. Civilian casualties here were second only to those in Indonesia, with approximately 35,000 killed. The eastern shores of the country were the hardest hit since it faced the epicentre of the earthquake, while the southwestern shores were hit later, but the death toll was just as severe. The southwestern shores are a hotspot for tourists and fishing. The degradation of the natural environment in Sri Lanka contributed to the high death tolls. Approximately 90,000 buildings and many wooden houses were destroyed.

The tsunami arrived on the island as a small brown-orange-coloured flood. Moments later, the ocean floor was exposed for as much as in places, which was followed by massive second and third waves. Amateur video recorded at the city of Galle showed a large deluge flooding the city, carrying debris and sweeping away people while in the coastal resort town of Beruwala, the tsunami appeared as a huge brown-orange-coloured bore which reached the first level of a hotel, causing destruction and taking people unaware. Other videos recorded showed that the tsunami appeared like a flood raging inland. The construction of seawalls and breakwaters reduced the power of waves at some locations.

The largest run-up measured was at with inundation distance of in Yala. In Hambantota, run-ups measured with the greatest inundation distance of . Run-up measurements along the Sri Lankan coasts are at . Waves measured on the east coast ranged from at Pottuvill to Batticaloa at in the north-east around Trincomalee and in the west coast from Moratuwa to Ambalangoda.

Sri Lanka tsunami height survey:
* at Koggala
* at Galle port
* around the Galle coast
* at Nonagama
* at Weligama
* at Dodanduwa
* at Ambalangoda
* at Hikkaduwa Fishery Harbour
* at Kahawa
* at North Beach of Beruwala
* at Paiyagala

A regular passenger train operating between Maradana and Matara with over 1,750 passengers was derailed and subsequently overturned by the tsunami, claiming at least 1,000 lives in the largest single rail disaster death toll in history. Estimates based on the state of the shoreline and a high-water mark on a nearby building place the tsunami above sea level and higher than the top of the train.

===Thailand===
The tsunami travelled eastward through the Andaman Sea and hit the south-western coasts of Thailand, about 2 hours after the earthquake. Located about from the epicentre, at the time, the region was popular with tourists because of Christmas. Many of these tourists were caught off-guard by the tsunami, as they had no prior warning. The tsunami hit during high tide. Major locations damaged included the western shores of Phuket island, the resort town of Khao Lak in Phang Nga Province, the coastal provinces of Krabi, Satun, Ranong and Trang and small offshore islands like Ko Racha Yai, the Phi Phi islands, the Surin Islands and the Similan archipelago. Approximately 8,000 people were killed.

Thailand experienced the second largest tsunami run-up. The tsunami heights recorded:

* in Khao Lak
* along the west coast of Phuket island
* along the south coast of Phuket island
* along the east coast of Phuket island
* on the Phi Phi Islands
* at Ban Thung Dap
* at Ramson
* at Ban Thale Nok
* at Hat Praphat (Ranong Coastal Resources Research Station)
* at Thai Mueang District
* at Rai Dan

The province of Phang Nga was the most affected area in Thailand. The quiet resort town of Khao Lak is located on a stretch of golden sandy beach, famed for its hotels overlooking the Andaman Sea and hilly rainforests. A video, taken by a local restaurant manager from a hill adjacent to the beach, showed that the tsunami&#x27;s arrival was preceded by a sudden retreat of the sea exposing the seafloor. Many tourists and locals can be seen trying to gather fish. Moments later, the tsunami arrives as a wall of foaming water that slams into the coast, washing away numerous people who had no time to escape. Another amateur video, captured by a German family at beach level, showed the tsunami appearing as a white horizontal line in the distant horizon, gradually becoming bigger (bore-like), engulfing a jet skier and lifting two police boats. A maximum inundation of approximately was measured, the inundated depths were and there was evidence that the tsunami reached the third floor of a resort hotel. The tsunami in Khao Lak was bigger due to offshore coral reefs and shallow seafloor which caused the tsunami to pile-up. This was similar to eyewitness accounts of the tsunami at Banda Aceh.

Khao Lak also experienced the largest tsunami run-up height outside of Sumatra. The highest-recorded tsunami run-up was measured at Ban Thung Dap, on the south-west tip of Ko Phra Thong Island and the second-highest at at Ban Nam Kim. Moreover, the largest death toll occurred at Khao Lak, with about 5,000 people killed.

In addition, the tsunami inflicted damage to the popular resort town of Ao Nang in Krabi Province. Video footage showed that the tsunami appeared as multiple white surfs violently lifting up yachts, boats and crashing onto beaches. Footage captured at Koh Lanta showed a wall of water swamping the beach, while another video taken at another location showed a large surfing wave like tsunami approaching the shore, lifting up a yacht and flooding the beach. At Koh Sriboya, the tsunami advanced inland as a turbulent medium bore, while at Koh Phayam, Ranong Province, the tsunami appeared as a wall of water.

At Phuket Province, the island province&#x27;s western beaches were struck by the tsunami. At Patong Beach, a popular tourist destination, the tsunami first arrived as a small flood, which swept away cars and surprised people. About 10 minutes later, the sea receded for a while before the tsunami arrived again as a large wall of water looming over the skyline and flooding the coast. Another video from Kamala Beach showed the tsunami flooding the ground floor of a restaurant sweeping away an elderly couple. On Karon Beach, Kamala Beach and Kata Beach, the tsunami came in like a surging flood inland carrying people and cars. On some locations, a coastal road was built which was higher than the shore, protecting a hotel which was behind it. On the east coast of Phuket Island, the tsunami height was about 2 m. In one river mouth, many boats were damaged. The tsunami moved counter-clockwise around Phuket Island, as was the case at Okushiri Island in the 1993 Hokkaido earthquake. According to interviews, the second wave was the largest. The tsunami heights were and the inundated depth was about . The tsunami surprised many tourists at Koh Racha Yai, where it flooded the resorts. About 250 people perished directly in the tsunami.

The Phi Phi Islands are a group of small islands that were affected by the tsunami. The north bay of Phi Phi Don Island opens to the north-west in the direction of the tsunami. The measured tsunami height on this beach was . According to eyewitness accounts, the tsunami came from the north and south. The ground level was about 2 m above sea level, where there were many cottages and hotels. The south bay opens to the south-east and faces in the opposite direction from the tsunami. Furthermore, Phi Phi Le Island shields the port of Phi Phi Don Island. The measured tsunami height was in the port. Amateur camcorder footage taken by Israeli tourists showed the tsunami advancing inland suddenly as a small flood, gradually becoming more powerful and engulfing the whole beach and resort, with the tsunami carrying a yacht out to sea.

Moreover, the tsunami was detected by scuba divers around offshore islands like the Similan Islands and the Surin Islands. The divers reported being caught in a violent, swirling current suddenly while underwater. Local camcorder footage showed the tsunami surging inland and flooding camping equipment at the Similan Islands while the tsunami caught tourists unaware at the Surin Islands, and dragging them out towards the sea.

===India===

The tsunami reached the states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu along the southeastern coastline of the Indian mainland about two hours after the earthquake. At the same time, it arrived in the state of Kerala, on the southwestern coast. There were two to five tsunamis that coincided with the local high tide in some areas.

The tsunami runup height measured in mainland India by Ministry of Home Affairs includes:
* at Kerala, inundation distance of with of coastline affected
* at the southern coastline of Tamil Nadu, inundation distance of with of coastline affected
* at the eastern coastline of Tamil Nadu facing tsunami source, inundation distance of with of coastline affected
* at Pondicherry, inundation distance of with of coastline affected
* at Andhra Pradesh, inundation distance of with of coastline affected

Along the coast of Tamil Nadu, the Marina Beach in Chennai was battered by the tsunami which swept across the beach taking morning walkers unaware. Amateur video recorded at a resort beach showed the tsunami arriving as a large wall of water as it approached the coast and flooding it as it advanced inland. Besides that, a black muddy tsunami ravaged the city of Karaikal, where 492 people died. The city of Pondicherry, protected by seawalls was relatively unscathed. Local video recorded that before the arrival of the tsunami, people can be seen swarming the beach to check on stranded fish from the exposed beach. Furthermore, at the coastal town of Kanyakumari, the seabed was exposed briefly before a large wall of water can be seen on the horizon and subsequently flooding the town. Other footage showed the tsunami dramatically crashed into the Vivekananda Rock Memorial. The worst affected area in Tamil Nadu was Nagapattinam district, with 6,051 fatalities caused by a tsunami, followed by Cuddalore district, with many villages destroyed. Most of the people killed were members of the fishing community. Velankanni, a coastal town with a Catholic Basilica and a popular pilgrimage destination was also one of the worst hit by the tsunami that struck at around 9.30 am on that Sunday, when pilgrims who were mostly from Kerala among others were inside the church attending the Malayalam Mass. The rising sea water did not enter the shrine, but the receding waters swept away hundreds of pilgrims who were on the beach. The shrine&#x27;s compound, nearby villages, hundreds of shops, homes and pilgrims were washed away into the sea. About 600 pilgrims died. Rescue teams extricated more than 400 bodies from the sand and rocks in the vicinity and large number of unidentified bodies were buried in mass graves.

Kerala experienced tsunami-related damage in three southern densely populated districts, Ernakulam, Alappuzha, and Kollam, due to diffraction of the waves around Sri Lanka. The southernmost district of Thiruvananthapuram, however, escaped damage, possibly due to the wide turn of the diffracted waves at the peninsular tip. Major damage occurred in two narrow strips of land bound on the west by the Arabian Sea and on the east by the Kerala backwaters. The waves receded before the first tsunami with the highest fatality reported from the densely populated Alappad panchayat (including the villages of Cheriya Azhikkal and Azhikkal) at Kollam district, caused by a tsunami.

Many villages in Andhra Pradesh were destroyed. In the Krishna District, the tsunami created havoc in Manginapudi and on Machalipattanam Beach. The most affected was Prakasam District, recording 35 deaths, with maximum damage at Singarayakonda. Given the enormous power of the tsunami, the fishing industry suffered the greatest. Moreover, the cost of damage in the transport sector was reported in the tens of thousands.

The tsunami run-up was only in areas of Tamil Nadu shielded by the island of Sri Lanka but was in coastal districts such as Nagapattinam in Tamil Nadu directly across from Sumatra. On the western coast, the runup elevations were at Kanyakumari District in Tamil Nadu and each at Kollam and Ernakulam districts in Kerala. The time between the waves ranged from about 15 minutes to 90 minutes. The tsunami varied in height from to based on survivors&#x27; accounts. The tsunami travelled at its maximum inland at Karaikal, Puducherry. The inundation distance varied between in most areas, except at river mouths, where it was more than . Areas with dense coconut groves or mangroves had much smaller inundation distances, and those with river mouths or backwaters saw larger inundation distances. Presence of seawalls at the Kerala and Tamil Nadu coasts reduced the impact of the waves. However, when the seawalls were made of loose stones, the stones were displaced and carried a few metres inland.

====Andaman and Nicobar Islands====

Due to close proximity to the earthquake, the tsunami took just minutes to devastate the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The Andaman Islands were moderately affected while the island of Little Andaman and the Nicobar Islands were severely affected by the tsunami.

In South Andaman Island, based on local eyewitnesses, there were three tsunami waves, with the third being the most destructive. Flooding occurred at the coast and low-lying areas inland, which were connected to open sea through creeks. Inundation was observed, along the east coast of South Andaman Island, restricted to Chidiyatapu, Burmanallah, Kodiaghat, Beadnabad, Corbyn&#x27;s Cove and Marina Park/Aberdeen Jetty areas. Several near-shore establishments and numerous infrastructures such as seawalls and a 20 MW diesel-generated power plant at Bamboo Flat were destroyed. At Port Blair, the water receded before the first wave, and the third wave was the tallest and caused the most damage.

Results of the tsunami survey in South Andaman along Chiriyatapu, Corbyn&#x27;s Cove and Wandoor beaches:
* in maximum tsunami height with a run-up of at Chiriyatapu Beach
* in maximum tsunami height and run-up at Corbyn&#x27;s Cove Beach
* in maximum tsunami height and run-up of at Wandoor Beach

Meanwhile, in the Little Andaman, tsunami waves impinged on the eastern shore about 25 to 30 minutes after the earthquake in a four-wave cycle of which the fourth tsunami was the most devastating with a wave height of about . The tsunami destroyed settlements at Hut Bay within a range of from the seashore. Run up level up to have been measured.

In Malacca, located on the island of Car Nicobar, there were three tsunami waves. The sea was observed to rise suddenly before the onset of the first wave. The first wave came 5 minutes after the earthquake, preceded by a recession of the sea up to .. The second and third waves came in 10 minutes intervals after the first wave. The third wave was the strongest, with a maximum tsunami wave height of . Waves nearly three stories high devastated the Indian Air Force base, located just south of Malacca. The maximum tsunami wave height of . Inundation limit was found to be up to inland. The impact of the waves was so severe that four oil tankers were thrown almost from the seashore near Malacca to the Air force colony main gate. In Chuckchucha and Lapati, the tsunami arrived in a three-wave cycle with a maximum tsunami wave height of .

In Campbell Bay of Great Nicobar Island, the tsunami waves hit the area three times with an inundation limit of . A rise in sea level was observed before the first wave came within 5 minutes of the earthquake. The second and third waves came in 10-minute intervals after the first. The second wave was the strongest. The tsunami waves wreaked havoc in the densely populated Jogindar Nagar area, situated south of Campbell Bay. According to local accounts, tsunami waves attacked the area three times. The first wave came five minutes after the mainshock (0629 hrs.) with a marginal drop in sea level. The second wave came 10 minutes after the first one with a maximum height of to 8 m (26 ft) and caused the major destruction. The third wave came within 15 minutes after the second with lower wave height. The maximum inundation limit due to tsunami water was about .

The worst affected island in the Andaman and Nicobar chain is Katchall Island, with 303 people confirmed dead and 4,354 missing out of a total population of 5,312. The significant shielding of Port Blair and Campbell Bay by steep mountainous outcrops contributed to the relatively low wave heights at these locations, whereas the open terrain along the eastern coast at Malacca and Hut Bay contributed to the great height of the tsunami waves.

Reports of tsunami wave height:

* at Diglipur and Rangat at North Andaman Island
* high at Campbell Bay on Great Nicobar Island
* high at Malacca (in Car Nicobar Island) and at Hut Bay on Little Andaman Island
* high at Port Blair on South Andaman Island

===Maldives===
The tsunami severely affected the Maldives at a distance of from the epicentre. Similar to Sri Lanka, survivors reported three waves with the second wave being the most powerful. Being rich in coral reefs, the Maldives provides an opportunity for scientists to assess the impact of a tsunami on coral atolls. The significantly lower tsunami impact on the Maldives compared to Sri Lanka is mostly due to the topography and bathymetry of the atoll chain with offshore coral reefs, deep channels separating individual atolls and its arrival within low tide which decreased the power of the tsunami. After the tsunami, there was some concern that the country might be submerged entirely and become uninhabitable. However, this was proven untrue.

The highest tsunami wave measured was at Vilufushi Island. The tsunami arrived approximately two hours after the earthquake. The greatest tsunami inundation occurred at North Male Atoll, Male Island at along the streets.

Local footage recorded showed the tsunami flooding the streets up to knee level in town, while another video taken at the beach showed the tsunami slowly flooding and gradually surging inland.

The Maldives tsunami wave analysis:
* at North Male Atoll, Male Island
* at North Male Atoll, Huhule Island
* at South Male Atoll, Embudhu Finothu
* at Laamu Atoll, Fonadhoo Island
* at Laamu Atoll, Gan Island
* at North Male Atoll, Dhiffushi Island
* at North Male Atoll, Huraa Island
* more than at North Male Atoll, Kuda Huraa Island

===Myanmar===
In Myanmar, the tsunami caused only moderate damage, which arrived between 2 and 5.5 hours after the earthquake. Although the country&#x27;s western Andaman Sea coastline lies at the proximity of the rupture zone, there were smaller tsunamis than the neighbouring Thai coast, because the main tsunami source did not extend to the Andaman Islands. Another factor is that some coasts of Taninthayi Division were protected by the Myeik Archipelago. Based on scientific surveys from the Irrawaddy Delta through Taninthayi Division, it was revealed that tsunami heights along the Myanmar coast were between . Eyewitnesses compared the tsunami with the &quot;rainy-season high tide&quot;; although at most locations, the tsunami height was similar or smaller than the &quot;rainy-season high tide&quot; level.

Tsunami survey heights:
* around the Irrawaddy delta
* at Dawei area
* around Myeik
* around Kawthaung

Interviews with residents indicate that they did not feel the earthquake in Taninthayi Division or the Irrawaddy Delta. The 71 casualties can be attributed to poor housing infrastructure and additionally, the fact that the coastal residents in the surveyed areas live on flat land along the coast, especially in the Irrawaddy Delta, and that there is no higher ground to which to evacuate. The tsunami heights from the earthquake were not more than along the Myanmar coast, the amplitudes were slightly large off the Irrawaddy Delta, probably because the shallow delta caused a concentration in tsunami energy.

===Somalia===
The tsunami travelled west across the open ocean before striking the East African country of Somalia. Around 289 fatalities were reported in the Horn of Africa, drowned by four tsunami waves. The hardest-hit was a stretch of coastline between Garacad (Mudug region) and Hafun (Bari region), which forms part of Puntland province. Most of the victims were reported along the low-lying Xaafuun Peninsula. The Puntland coast in northern Somalia was by far the area hardest hit by the waves to the west of the Indian subcontinent. The waves arrived around noon local time.

Consequently, tsunami runup heights vary from to with inundation distances varying from to . The maximum runup height of almost was recorded in Bandarbeyla. An even higher runup point was measured on a cliff near the town of Eyl, solely on an eyewitness account.

The highest death toll was in Hafun, with 19 dead and 160 people presumed missing out of its 5,000 inhabitants. This was the highest number of casualties in a single African town and the largest tsunami death toll in a single town to the west of the Indian subcontinent. Small drawbacks were observed before the third and most powerful tsunami wave flooded the town.

===Other locations===

The tsunami also reached Malaysia, mainly on the northern states such as Kedah, Perak and Penang and on offshore islands such as Langkawi island. Peninsular Malaysia was shielded by the full force of the tsunami due to the protection offered by the island of Sumatra, which lies just off the western coast.

Bangladesh escaped major damage and deaths because the water displaced by the strike-slip fault was relatively little on the northern section of the rupture zone, which ruptured slowly. In Yemen, the tsunami killed two people with a maximum runup of .

The tsunami was detected in the southern parts of east Africa, where rough seas were reported, specifically on the eastern and southern coasts that face the Indian Ocean. A few other African countries also recorded fatalities; one in Kenya, three in Seychelles, ten in Tanzania, and South Africa, where two were killed as a direct result of the tsunami—the furthest from the epicentre.

Tidal surges also occurred along the Western Australian coast that lasted for several hours, resulting in boats losing their moorings and two people needing to be rescued.

==Impact==
===Countries affected===
According to the final report of the Tsunami Evaluation Coalition, a total of 227,898 people died. Another common total, as given by the UN Office of the Special Envoy for Tsunami Recovery, is 229,866 dead. Measured in lives lost, this is one of the ten worst earthquakes in recorded history, as well as the single worst tsunami in history. Indonesia was the worst affected area, with most death toll estimates at around 170,000. The death toll for Indonesia alone may be as high as 172,761 lives. An initial report by Siti Fadilah Supari, the Indonesian Minister of Health at the time, estimated the death total to be as high as 220,000 in Indonesia alone, giving a total of 280,000 fatalities. However, the estimated number of dead and missing in Indonesia were later reduced by over 50,000. In their report, the Tsunami Evaluation Coalition stated, &quot;It should be remembered that all such data are subject to error, as data on missing persons especially are not always as good as one might wish&quot;. A much higher number of deaths has been suggested for Myanmar based on reports from Thailand.

The tsunami caused severe damage and deaths as far as the east coast of Africa, with the furthest recorded fatality directly attributed to the tsunami at Rooi-Els, close to Cape Town, from the epicentre.

Relief agencies reported that one third of the dead appeared to be children. This was a result of the high proportion of children in the populations of many of the affected regions and because children were the least able to resist being overcome by the surging waters. Oxfam went on to report that as many as four times more women than men were killed in some regions because they were waiting on the beach for the fishers to return and looking after their children in the houses.

States of emergency were declared in Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and the Maldives. The United Nations estimated at the outset that the relief operation would be the costliest in human history. Then-UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan stated that reconstruction would probably take between five and ten years. Governments and non-governmental organizations feared that the final death toll might double as a result of diseases, prompting a massive humanitarian response.

In addition to a large number of local residents, up to 9,000 foreign tourists (mostly Europeans) enjoying the peak holiday travel season were among the dead or missing, especially people from the Nordic countries. Sweden was the European country most severely affected both in absolute numbers, and by a wide margin when considered in relation to the country&#x27;s population, with a death toll of 543. Germany was close behind with 539 identified victims.


===Environmental impact===

Beyond the heavy toll on human lives, the Indian Ocean earthquake caused an enormous environmental impact that affected the region for many years. Severe damage was inflicted on ecosystems such as mangroves, coral reefs, forests, coastal wetlands, vegetation, sand dunes and rock formations, animal and plant biodiversity and groundwater. Also, the spread of solid and liquid waste and industrial chemicals, water pollution and the destruction of sewage collectors and treatment plants threatened the environment even further. The environmental impact took a long time and significant resources to assess.

The main effect was caused by poisoning of the freshwater supplies and of the soil by saltwater infiltration and a deposit of a salt layer over arable land. In the Maldives, 16 to 17 coral reef atolls that were overcome by sea waves are without fresh water and could be rendered uninhabitable for decades. Uncountable wells that served communities were invaded by sea, sand, and earth, and aquifers were invaded through porous rock. On the island&#x27;s east coast, the tsunami contaminated wells on which many villagers relied for drinking water.

The Colombo-based International Water Management Institute monitored the effects of saltwater and concluded that the wells recovered to pre-tsunami drinking water quality one-and-a-half years after the event. The IWMI developed protocols for cleaning wells contaminated by saltwater; these were subsequently officially endorsed by the World Health Organization as part of its series of Emergency Guidelines.

Salted-over soil becomes sterile, and it is difficult and costly to restore for agriculture. It also causes the death of plants and important soil micro-organisms. Thousands of rice, mango, and banana plantations in Sri Lanka were destroyed almost entirely and will take years to recover.

In addition to other forms of aid, the Australian government sent ecological experts to help develop strategies for reef-monitoring and rehabilitation of marine environments and coral reefs in the Maldives, Seychelles and other areas. Scientists had developed significant ecological expertise from work with the Great Barrier Reef, in Australia&#x27;s northeastern waters.

In response to the unprecedented situation, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) worked with governments in the region to determine the severity of the ecological impact and how to address it. UNEP established an emergency fund, set up a Task Force to respond to requests for assistance from countries affected by the tsunami, and was able to mobilize and distribute approximately US$9.3 million for environmental recovery and disaster risk reduction between 2004 and 2007. Funding came from other international agencies and from countries including Finland, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

Evidence suggested that the presence of mangroves in coastal areas had provided some protection, when compared to areas that had been cleared for aquaculture or development. As a result, mangrove restoration become a focus of a number of projects, with varied success. Such approaches to ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction appear to be most successful when local communities are closely involved as stakeholders throughout the process, and when careful attention is paid to the physical conditions of chosen sites to ensure that mangroves can thrive there.

===Economic impact===

The level of damage to the economy resulting from the tsunami depends on the scale examined. While the overall impact on the national economies was minor, local economies were devastated. The two main occupations most affected by the tsunami were fishing and tourism. Some economists believe that damage to the affected national economies will be minor because losses in the tourism and fishing industries are a relatively small percentage of the GDP. However, others caution that damage to infrastructure is an overriding factor. In some areas drinking water supplies and farm fields may have been contaminated for years by saltwater from the ocean.

The impact on coastal fishing communities and the people living there, some of the poorest in the region, has been devastating with high losses of income earners as well as boats and fishing gear. In Sri Lanka, artisanal fishery, in which the use of fish baskets, fishing traps, and spears are commonly used, is an important source of fish for local markets; industrial fishery is the major economic activity, providing direct employment to about 250,000 people. In recent years the fishery industry has emerged as a dynamic export-oriented sector, generating substantial foreign exchange earnings. Preliminary estimates indicated that 66% of the fishing fleet and industrial infrastructure in coastal regions were destroyed by the wave surges.

While the tsunami destroyed many of the boats vital to Sri Lanka&#x27;s fishing industry, it also created a demand for fibreglass-reinforced plastic catamarans in the boatyards of Tamil Nadu. Given that over 51,000 vessels were lost to the tsunami, the industry boomed. However, the huge demand has led to lower quality in the process, and some important materials were sacrificed to cut prices for those who were impoverished by the tsunami.

Even though only coastal regions were directly affected by the waters of the tsunami, the indirect effects have spread to inland provinces as well. Since the media coverage of the event was so extensive, many tourists cancelled vacations and trips to that part of the world, even though their travel destinations may not have been affected. This ripple effect could especially be felt in the inland provinces of Thailand, such as Krabi, which acted as a starting point for many other tourist destinations in Thailand.

Countries in the region appealed to tourists to return, pointing out that most tourist infrastructure is undamaged. However, tourists were reluctant to do so for psychological reasons. Even beach resorts in parts of Thailand which were untouched by the tsunami were hit by cancellations.

Both the earthquake and the tsunami may have affected shipping in the Malacca Straits, which separate Malaysia and the Indonesian island of Sumatra, by changing the depth of the seabed and by disturbing navigational buoys and old shipwrecks. In one area of the Strait, water depths were previously up to , and are now only in some areas, making shipping impossible and dangerous. These problems also made the delivery of relief aid more challenging. Compiling new navigational charts may take months or years. Officials also hoped that piracy in the region would drop off, since the tsunami had killed pirates and destroyed their boats. Due to multiple factors, there was a 71.6% drop in the number of piracy incidents between 2004 and 2005, from 60 to 17 incidents. Levels remained relatively low for some years. However, between 2013 and 2014, piracy incidents rose dramatically by 73.2% to exceed pre-tsunami levels.

===Historical context===
The last major tsunami in the Indian Ocean was about A.D. 1400. In 2008, a team of scientists working on Phra Thong, a barrier island along the hard-hit west coast of Thailand, reported evidence of at least three previous major tsunamis in the preceding 2,800 years, the most recent from about 700 years ago. A second team found similar evidence of previous tsunamis in Aceh, a province at the northern tip of Sumatra; radiocarbon dating of bark fragments in the soil below the second sand layer led the scientists to estimate that the most recent predecessor to the 2004 tsunami probably occurred between A.D. 1300 and 1450.

The 2004 earthquake and tsunami combined is the world&#x27;s deadliest natural disaster since the 1976 Tangshan earthquake. The earthquake was the third-most-powerful earthquake recorded since 1900. The deadliest-known earthquake in history occurred in 1556 in Shaanxi, China, with an estimated death toll of 830,000, though figures from this period may not be as reliable.

Before 2004, the tsunami created in both Indian and Pacific Ocean waters by the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, thought to have resulted in anywhere from 36,000 to 120,000 deaths, had probably been the deadliest in the region. In 1782, about 40,000 people are thought to have been killed by a tsunami (or a cyclone) in the South China Sea. The deadliest tsunami before 2004 was Italy&#x27;s 1908 Messina earthquake on the Mediterranean Sea where the earthquake and tsunami killed about 123,000.

===Other effects===
Many health professionals and aid workers have reported widespread psychological trauma associated with the tsunami. Even 14 years afterwards, researchers find HPA axis dysregulation and &quot;burnout&quot; in survivors. Traditional beliefs in many of the affected regions state that a relative of the family must bury the body of the dead, and in many cases, no body remained to be buried. Women in Aceh required a special approach from foreign aid agencies, and continue to have unique needs.

The hardest-hit area, Aceh, is a religiously conservative Islamic society and has had no tourism nor any Western presence in recent years due to the insurgency between the Indonesian military and Free Aceh Movement (GAM). Some believe that the tsunami was divine punishment for lay Muslims shirking their daily prayers or following a materialistic lifestyle. Others have said that Allah was angry that Muslims were killing each other in an ongoing conflict. Saudi cleric Muhammad Al-Munajjid attributed it to divine retribution against non-Muslim vacationers &quot;who used to sprawl all over the beaches and in pubs overflowing with wine&quot; during Christmas break.

The widespread devastation caused by the tsunami led GAM to declare a cease-fire on 28 December 2004 followed by the Indonesian government, and the two groups resumed long-stalled peace talks, which resulted in a peace agreement signed 15 August 2005. The agreement explicitly cites the tsunami as a justification.

In a poll conducted in 27 countries, 15% of respondents named the tsunami the most significant event of the year. Only the Iraq War was named by as many respondents. The extensive international media coverage of the tsunami, and the role of mass media and journalists in reconstruction, were discussed by editors of newspapers and broadcast media in tsunami-affected areas, in special video-conferences set up by the Asia Pacific Journalism Centre.

The tsunami left both the people and government of India in a state of heightened alert. On 30 December 2004, four days after the tsunami, Terra Research notified the India government that its sensors indicated there was a possibility of 7.9 to 8.1 magnitude tectonic shift in the next 12 hours between Sumatra and New Zealand. In response, the Indian Minister of Home Affairs announced that a fresh onslaught of deadly tsunami was likely along the southern Indian coast and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, even as there was no sign of turbulence in the region. The announcement generated panic in the Indian Ocean region and caused thousands to flee their homes, which resulted in jammed roads. The announcement was a false alarm, and the Home Affairs minister withdrew their announcement. On further investigation, the India government learned that the consulting company Terra Research was run from the home of a self-described earthquake forecaster who had no telephone listing and maintained a website where he sold copies of his detection system.

The tsunami had a severe humanitarian and political impact in Sweden. The hardest-hit country outside Asia, Sweden, lost 543 tourists, mainly in Thailand. The Persson Cabinet was heavily criticized for its inaction.

Smith Dharmasaroja, a meteorologist who had predicted that an earthquake and tsunami &quot;is going to occur for sure&quot; in 1994, was assigned the development of the Thai tsunami warning system. The Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System was formed in early 2005 to provide an early warning of tsunamis for inhabitants around the Indian Ocean coasts.

The changes in the distribution of masses inside the Earth due to the earthquake had several consequences. It displaced the North Pole by . It also slightly changed the shape of the Earth, specifically by decreasing Earth&#x27;s oblateness by about one part in 10 billion, consequentially increasing Earth&#x27;s rotation a little and thus shortening the length of the day by 2.68 microseconds.

==Humanitarian response==

A great deal of humanitarian aid was needed because of widespread damage to the infrastructure, shortages of food and water, and economic damage. Epidemics were of particular concern due to the high population density and tropical climate of the affected areas. The main concern of humanitarian and government agencies was to provide sanitation facilities and fresh drinking water to contain the spread of diseases such as cholera, diphtheria, dysentery, typhoid and hepatitis A and .

There was also a great concern that the death toll could increase as disease and hunger spread. However, because of the initial quick response, this was minimized.

In the days following the tsunami, significant effort was spent in burying bodies hurriedly due to fear of disease spreading. However, the public health risks may have been exaggerated, and therefore this may not have been the best way to allocate resources. The World Food Programme provided food aid to more than 1.3 million people affected by the tsunami.
Nations all over the world provided over US$14 billion in aid for damaged regions, with the governments of Australia pledging US$819.9 million (including a US$760.6 million aid package for Indonesia), Germany offering US$660 million, Japan offering US$500 million, Canada offering US$343 million, Norway and the Netherlands offering both US$183 million, the United States offering US$35 million initially (increased to US$350 million), and the World Bank offering US$250 million. Also, Italy offered US$95 million, increased later to US$113 million of which US$42 million was donated by the population using the SMS system. Australia, India, Japan and the United States formed an ad-hoc corroborative group, and it was the origin of Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.

According to USAID, the US has pledged additional funds in long-term U.S. support to help the tsunami victims rebuild their lives. On 9 February 2005, President Bush asked Congress to increase the U.S. commitment to a total of US$950 million. Officials estimated that billions of dollars would be needed. Bush also asked his father, former President George H. W. Bush, and former President Bill Clinton to lead a U.S. effort to provide private aid to the tsunami victims.

In mid-March, the Asian Development Bank reported that over US$4 billion in aid promised by governments was behind schedule. Sri Lanka reported that it had received no foreign government aid, while foreign individuals had been generous. Many charities were given considerable donations from the public. For example, in the United Kingdom, the public donated roughly £330 million sterling (nearly US$600 million). This considerably outweighed the allocation by the government to disaster relief and reconstruction of £75 million and came to an average of about £5.50 (US$10) donated by every citizen.

In August 2006, fifteen local aid staff working on post-tsunami rebuilding were found executed in north-east Sri Lanka after heavy fighting between government troops and the Tamil Tiger rebels, the main umbrella body for aid agencies in the country said.

<text>Flirting Scholar (Cantonese: 唐伯虎點秋香; Jyutping: tong⁴ baak³ fu² dim² cau¹ heong¹) is a 1993 Hong Kong comedy film directed by Lee Lik-Chi. It parodies famous works of literature which feature the same characters and settings.

The title is itself a pun. The phrase &quot;點秋香&quot; means &quot;to light Autumn incense&quot;, but as &quot;秋香&quot; is the actual name of a character, the title can also mean &quot;courts Chow Heung&quot;.

==Plot==
In the Ming Dynasty, there were four scholars, whose literary and artistic skills are unmatched in China. Tong Pak Fu (Stephen Chow) is the most famous, for having eight wives in addition to his expertise as an artist, poet, and calligrapher. However, Tong&#x27;s wives are all gambling addicts and unappreciative of Tong&#x27;s artistic skills. This leads to Tong&#x27;s quest for a woman who can truly appreciate his strengths.

The Tong Family comes from a pedigree of martial arts masters. They have two major enemies: the Evil Scholar, a notorious swordsman known for The Deadly Scholastic Sword (書生奪命劍), and an evil ex-girlfriend of his father&#x27;s. Due to these rivalries, Tong Pak Fu is forbidden by his mother to use any form of martial arts.

One day, Tong stumbles upon the convoy of the House of Wah and meets Chow Heung (&quot;Autumn Fragrance&quot;) (Gong Li), one of the four maids in the House of Wah (Who are named after the four seasons). This chance encounter convinces Tong that he has finally found his true love. On the advice of a boatman, Tong pretends to be a lowly servant 9527 in order to gain employment in the House of Wah.

Tong finds life as a servant very difficult, until after a night incident (which involved the saving of Chow Heung from rape by the Wolf gang), Madame Wah (Cheng Pei-pei) discovers that Tong is actually educated. After some persuasion by Chow Heung, Tong is hired as an assistant tutor for Madame Wah&#x27;s two young sons, Madame Wah named him as Washington but Tong insisted use lower status name and Madame Wah named him as Wah On. After the accidental death of the main tutor of the House of Wah, Tong is promoted to senior tutor and manages to get closer to Chow Heung.

The House of Wah is then suddenly visited by Chancellor Wah&#x27;s political rival, Prince Ning, who is planning a coup. During the visit Prince Ning shows off a painting of Tong Pak Fu. Slowly the showing turns violent as the Evil Scholar, now a subordinate under Prince Ning, fights and injures Madam Wah. Tong steps in to stop the battle but, in turn, destroys the Tong Pak Fu painting Prince Ning brought. Prince Ning seizes the opportunity to blame the House of Wah for insulting him and destroying the painting. Tong quickly grabs Chow Heung, lies to Prince Ning that the painting they had was a fake and the real one is in the Wah House. Chow Heung attempts to recreate the painting in the study to pacify the situation, but doubts that her painting skills can fool Prince Ning. While she was rambling, Tong completed a re-creation of the painting. Prince Ning doubts the painting, but has his own scholar verify that is it indeed a Tong Pak Fu painting and not a fake. Embarrassed Prince Ning leaves hastily and vows to kill the entire House of Wah.

However, in reproducing a painting and fighting off the Evil Scholar, Madame Wah is able to deduce Tong&#x27;s true identity and poisons him. It is then revealed that Madame Wah was the former love rival of Tong&#x27;s mother and still hold grudges against his father. With his strength nullified, Tong is then held prisoner in the Wah&#x27;s tinder room.

Several days later, the Evil Scholar returns to annihilate the entire House of Wah. Madame Wah attempts to defend the family but is almost killed. At the last minute, Tong appears and, after a fierce battle, kills the Evil Scholar. As a reward, the House of Wah gives Tong Chow Heung&#x27;s hand in marriage. Tong then discovers that Chow Heung is just as much a gambling addict as his other eight wives.

== Reviews ==
&quot;Flirting Scholar&quot; is the pinnacle of Stephen Chow&#x27;s nonsensical comedy, showing his unique comedic talent and creativity. The film successfully combines kung fu and comedy elements, and the actors&#x27; performances are unforgettable, especially Stephen Chow. However, film critics pointed out that Gong Li&#x27;s performance did not fit the overall comedy style of the film. Overall, the film has become a classic that is difficult to replicate thanks to the actors&#x27; excellent acting skills and unique humor.

<text>Atlit (, ) is a coastal town located south of Haifa, Israel. The community is in the Hof HaCarmel Regional Council in the Haifa District of Israel.

Off the coast of Atlit is a submerged Neolithic village. The town of Atlit is named after the nearby Crusader outpost and fortified town of Atlit, also known as Château Pèlerin, which although in ruins remained populated until 1948.

The town was established in 1903 under the auspices of Baron Edmond de Rothschild, approximately two kilometers south of the historical site which was then a small Palestinian village. The Atlit detainee camp is nearby, which was used by the British to intern Jewish refugees and is now a museum. From 1950 until the unification of the municipalities in 2003, Atlit was a local council whose jurisdiction was 14,000 dunams. In the population was .

==History==
===Neolithic===

Atlit Yam is an ancient submerged Neolithic village off the coast of Atlit. Atlit-Yam provides the earliest known evidence for an agro-pastoral-marine subsistence system on the Levantine coast.

===Bronze Age===
Atlit shows evidence of human habitation since the early Bronze Age.

===Crusader period===

The Crusaders built the historical settlement of Atlit, also known as Château Pèlerin. It was one of the largest citadels in the Holy Land, and became the last remaining Crusader outpost (see also: Fall of Ruad), remaining in Crusader&#x27;s hands until 1291.

The ruins of the citadel are still visible in modern times. Immediately to the north also lies a large medieval Christian cemetery hosting the graves of men, women and children who lived in the surrounding during the 13th century.

===Foundation===
In 1903, Jewish immigrants began to build a nearby village approximately 2 km south of the ancient site which they also called Atlit. The village was established by Edmond James de Rothschild, with most of the land bought from Arab fishermen. A hundred families settled there but much of it was swampland, and many residents succumbed to malaria. Aaron Aaronsohn established an agricultural station in Atlit in 1911, and during World War I the village was used as a base by the Nili organisation.

===British Mandate period===

In the 1922 census of Palestine, during the British Mandate of Palestine period &quot;Athlit Colony&quot; had a population of 78 Jews and 3 Muslims, while &quot;Athlit Salt works&quot; had a population of 196 Jews, 1 Muslim and 1 Christian.

The population of the wider had increased in the 1931 census to 413 Muslims, 496 Jews and 39 Christians; in a total of 193 houses; in addition to historical Atlit, this included Atlit Salt Co., Atlit Labour Group, Atlit Quarry, Aaronson Farm, Atlit Station and Atlit Police Post.

The Arab presence underwent a sharp decline in the 1940s due to land sales, so that by the 1945 statistics there were only 150 Arabs still living there (90 Muslims and 60 Christians) alongside 510 Jews.

===State of Israel===
The circumstances under which the remaining Arabs left in 1948 are unknown. The Atlit detainee camp was used by the British authorities to detain Jewish migrants to Palestine.

It is now a museum of the Ha&#x27;apala (illegal Jewish immigration 1934–48). The headquarters of Shayetet 13 marine commandos is located at Atlit naval base on the Atlit promontory, placing the Crusader ruins there off-limits for regular visitors.

Atlit was declared a local council in 1950, but in 2004 was incorporated in the Hof HaCarmel Regional Council as one of a handful of Regional Councils. The late Knesset member Pesah Grupper lived in Atlit. He was head of its local council in the years 1959–1962 and 1969–1971.

=== Archaeology ===
In August 2021, marine archeologists headed by Yaakov Sharvit from Israel Antiquities Authority announced the discovery of 1,700-year-old coins weighing a total of 6 kg., dated back to the 4th century AD. According to Sharvit, coins demonstrated that they were assembled together and agglutinated because of oxidation of the metals.

== Wildlife ==
Flamingos heading to Africa for the winter make migration stops in Atlit.

==Neighborhoods==
Neighborhoods in Atlit are Neve Moshe, Yamit, Giv&#x27;at HaPrahim, Giv&#x27;at HaBrekhot, Giv&#x27;at Sharon, Shoshanat HaYam, HaGoren, Yafe Nof, Argaman, Hofit, Savyonei Atlit and Allon. Atlit is in immediate vicinity of the villages Neve Yam and Ein Carmel.

<doc id="1328243" wikidata="Q7375285" url="?curid=1328243" title="Roz Chast">
<text>Roz Chast (born November 26, 1954) is an American cartoonist and a staff cartoonist for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. Since 1978, she has published more than 1000 cartoons in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. She also publishes cartoons in &quot;Scientific American&quot; and the &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot;.

In recognition of her work, ComicsAlliance listed Chast as one of twelve women cartoonists deserving of lifetime achievement recognition. She was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2010. In May 2017, she received the Alumni Award for Artistic Achievement at the Rhode Island School of Design commencement ceremony. In 2024, Chast was awarded a National Humanities Medal by President Joe Biden.

==Early life and education==
Chast grew up in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, the only child of George Chast, a high school French and Spanish teacher&quot;,&quot; and Elizabeth, an assistant principal in an elementary school. Her Jewish parents were children during the Great Depression, and she has spoken about their extreme frugality. She graduated from Midwood High School in Brooklyn, and attended Kirkland College (which later merged with Hamilton College). She studied at the Rhode Island School of Design and received a BFA in painting in 1977. She also holds honorary doctorates from Pratt Institute, Dartmouth College, and the Art Institute of Boston at Lesley University; and is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

==Career==
Chast&#x27;s subjects often deal with domestic and family life. In a 2006 interview with comedian Steve Martin for the New Yorker Festival, Chast revealed that she enjoys drawing interior scenes, often involving lamps and accentuated wallpaper, to serve as the backdrop for her comics. Her comics reflect a &quot;conspiracy of inanimate objects&quot;, an expression she credits to her mother.

Her first &quot;New Yorker&quot; cartoon, &quot;Little Things&quot;, was sold to the magazine in April 1978. The cartoon, which Chast describes as &quot;peculiar and personal&quot;, shows a small collection of &quot;Little Things&quot;—strangely-named, oddly-shaped small objects such as &quot;chent&quot;, &quot;spak&quot;, and &quot;tiv&quot;.

Her &quot;New Yorker&quot; cartoons began as small black-and-white panels, but increasingly used more color and often appeared over several pages. Her first cover for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; was the August 4, 1986 issue.

Chast has written or illustrated more than a dozen books, including &quot;Unscientific Americans&quot;, &quot;Parallel Universes&quot;, &quot;Mondo Boxo&quot;, &quot;Proof of Life on Earth&quot;, &quot;The Four Elements&quot; and &quot;The Party After You Left: Collected Cartoons 1995–2003&quot; (Bloomsbury, 2004). In 2006, &quot;Theories of Everything: Selected Collected and Health-Inspected Cartoons, 1978–2006&quot; was published, collecting most of her cartoons from &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and other periodicals. One characteristic of her books is that the &quot;author photo&quot; is always a cartoon she draws of, presumably, herself. The title page, including the Library of Congress cataloging information, is also hand-lettered by Chast.

Her book, &quot;Can&#x27;t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?&quot; is a graphic memoir, combining cartoons, text, and photographs to tell the story of an only child helping her elderly parents navigate the end of their lives.

On October 30, 2024, Chast was awarded a National Humanities Medal by the National Endowment for the Humanities for &quot;deepen[ing] the nation&#x27;s understanding of the humanities and broad[ening] our citizens&#x27; engagement with history, literature, languages, philosophy, and other humanities subjects&quot;. President Joe Biden presented the medal to Chast.

==Personal life==
Chast lives in Ridgefield, Connecticut with her husband, humor writer Bill Franzen. They have two children.

Prior to his MMA career, Penn was known as the first non-Brazilian to win the World Jiu-Jitsu Championship at black belt level. In mixed martial arts, Penn has competed in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) and in K-1 in the Featherweight, Lightweight, Welterweight, Middleweight, and Heavyweight/Openweight divisions. Penn fought to a draw against Caol Uno in the UFC 41 Lightweight Tournament. Through his tenures as champion, Penn unofficially unified the UFC Lightweight Championship (against Sean Sherk) and broke the all-time lightweight title defense record. In 2015, Penn was made the inaugural inductee into the Modern-era wing of the UFC Hall of Fame.

Penn was considered one of the top pound-for-pound mixed martial artists in the world early in his career and holds victories over opponents such as Din Thomas, Caol Uno, Paul Creighton, and Matt Serra. Penn won the Rumble on the Rock Lightweight Championship in K-1. He submitted long-reigning then-champion Matt Hughes to capture the UFC Welterweight Championship. Following a period in which Penn competed exclusively for K-1, he returned to the UFC and won the UFC Lightweight Championship. He made a record three subsequent title defenses before losing his title to Frankie Edgar.

Penn is regarded as one of the best competitors in the UFC&#x27;s history. UFC President, Dana White, credits Penn with bringing the lower weight divisions into the mainstream of mixed martial arts; he describes Penn as &quot;the first crossover pay-per-view star for the Ultimate Fighting Championship&#x27;s lighter weight divisions&quot;, as well as saying that &quot;[through his] accomplishments, B.J. Penn built the 155-pound division&quot;.

Penn hoped to run for governor of Hawaii in the 2022 Hawaii gubernatorial election but was eliminated in the Republican Party primary.

==Early life and education==
Penn was born in Hawaii to Jay Dee Penn, who is of Irish American descent, and Lorraine Shin, who is of Korean and Hawaiian descent. At the age of 17, Penn began training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu after being introduced to it by his neighbor, Tom Callos. Callos had put up fliers in local gyms looking for people to train with, and B.J.&#x27;s father Jay Dee Penn had called Callos and said his boys were interested. Callos then taught B.J. and his brother what he knew. Shortly thereafter, B.J. moved to San Jose, California, to begin training at the Ralph Gracie BJJ academy with Dave Camarillo, with whom he lived and became close friends. It was here during his time in San Jose that he decided to pursue a martial arts career.

==Mixed martial arts career==

===Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu===
In 1997 Penn began training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu under Ralph Gracie, eventually earning his purple belt from Gracie. At that point he moved to Nova União, where he was eventually awarded his black belt in 2000 by André Pederneiras. A few weeks later, he became the first non-Brazilian to win in the black-belt division of the World Jiu-Jitsu Championship held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. While Penn&#x27;s most well-known and prestigious achievement was placing first in the black belt division in the 2000 world championships, he had success at the Mundials in previous years. In 1999, at the age of 20, Penn finished 3rd, earning himself a bronze medal in the brown belt division, losing only to Fernando &quot;Tererê&quot; Augusto, and in 1998, earned a silver medal, placing 2nd in the blue belt division. Penn is thought to have earned the fastest legitimate black belt of all active Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioners.

===Ultimate Fighting Championship===
His accomplishments in the World Jiu-Jitsu Championship caught the attention of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, which convinced him to switch to mixed martial arts. Penn made his mixed martial arts debut with the company on May 24, 2001, with a win over Joey Gilbert at UFC 31. He then demonstrated strong striking skills, knocking out lightweights Din Thomas and Caol Uno before suffering a decision loss in a championship fight against UFC Lightweight Champion, Jens Pulver. In 2003, after Pulver left the UFC and relinquished his title, a tournament to crown a new champion flopped when Penn fought Uno to a draw in the finals at UFC 41, a failure which caused the UFC to later suspend its lightweight division. Penn bounced back later in the year with a victory over future PRIDE Lightweight Champion Takanori Gomi to earn his first MMA championship, the Rumble on the Rock Lightweight Championship, in K-1 Fighting Network&#x27;s Rumble on the Rock, an MMA organization promoted by Penn&#x27;s brother, and Fighting and Entertainment Group (FEG), the parent company of the largest kickboxing organization, K-1.

Penn received his first UFC Championship in 2004 at UFC 46. Penn jumped up in weight classes to challenge the five-time defending UFC Welterweight Champion Matt Hughes to fill a title contention slot in a division where Hughes had already defeated all the available opposition. Heavily favored to win, Hughes lost the fight four minutes into the first round by rear naked choke after giving up his back with only 23 seconds left in the round, in a bout which remains as one of the biggest upsets, as well as one of the greatest submission victories in mixed martial arts history.

===Fighting and Entertainment Group===
Penn signed to fight for the Japanese Fighting and Entertainment Group&#x27;s (FEG) &quot;K-1&quot; promotion citing a lack of challenging fights left for him in the UFC. The UFC promptly stripped him of the welterweight title, claiming Penn breached his contract and that the signing constituted as him refusing to defend his title. Penn filed a suit against the UFC and publicized his side of the conflict, claiming his UFC contract had already expired. Penn filed a motion to stop the UFC from awarding a new welterweight title, but that motion was denied.

In his second fight for FEG, Penn fought again at welterweight and defeated Duane Ludwig at the 2004 K-1 MMA Romanex show in under five minutes by arm triangle choke. Following the Ludwig fight, Penn moved up in weight class to face the undefeated Rodrigo Gracie at middleweight. Penn won by decision, extending his winning streak to four fights. On March 26, 2005, at the inaugural event of FEG&#x27;s new MMA promotion Hero&#x27;s, Penn faced future UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Lyoto Machida, losing by unanimous decision at K-1 Hero&#x27;s 1. The fight happened at an open weight class with Penn weighing in at and Machida weighing in at . Later that year at K-1 World Grand Prix Hawaii, Penn returned to middleweight to face Pride Fighting Championship veteran Renzo Gracie, which he won by unanimous decision.

===Return to the UFC===

In early 2006 at &quot;UFC 56&quot;, UFC president Dana White announced that Penn and the UFC had agreed to a settlement and Penn was to return as a top welterweight contender. Penn re-debuted on March 4 at UFC 58, losing to Georges St-Pierre by split decision in a fight that determined the number one welterweight contender. Although St. Pierre was declared the winner after a three-round decision, some believed that Penn had done enough to earn himself the victory, causing noticeably more damage throughout the fight, as Joe Rogan described St-Pierre&#x27;s face being &quot;a bloody mess&quot; while B.J. Penn &quot;barely having a scratch on him.&quot; Despite having lost the bout, Penn&#x27;s performance against Georges St-Pierre, is considered to be one of the best put forth against the future UFC Champion.

After new top contender St. Pierre injured himself during training, the UFC announced that Penn would replace St. Pierre in an upcoming title fight, setting up a highly anticipated rematch with Hughes at UFC 63 on September 23, 2006. In the bout, Penn controlled the first two rounds, but sustained a rib injury during the scramble to take Hughes&#x27; back in round two. He was visibly different in the third round, appearing exhausted and missing punches he was landing earlier. Hughes was able to take Penn to the mat, and in side control crucifix position rained punches on Penn&#x27;s head until referee &quot;Big&quot; John McCarthy stopped the fight at 3:53 of the third round, making this the first time that Penn had been stopped in a fight. In an interview found on Penn&#x27;s personal website, Penn stated that by round three he could hardly breathe and had no &quot;mobility in his core.&quot; Despite the injury, Penn congratulated Hughes, calling him a great fighter and saying he deserved the victory.

Penn was a coach for The Ultimate Fighter 5, which debuted on April 5, 2007. Penn lead a team of eight lightweight fighters, and fought a rematch against Jens Pulver at The Ultimate Fighter 5#The Ultimate Fighter 5 Finale on June 23, 2007. He won with a rear naked choke in the second round after controlling Pulver from the mount and then taking Pulver&#x27;s back. Although he held the choke for a moment after Pulver tapped out, the two then embraced, with both later saying they no longer held any ill will against each other.

On July 7, 2007, during the post-fight press conference of UFC 73, UFC president Dana White announced that Penn would stay at lightweight to fight current UFC Lightweight Champion Sean Sherk. However, Sean Sherk subsequently was suspended by the California State Athletic Commission, and the status of the possible title fight was left in limbo as he pursued his appeals. With Sherk&#x27;s title status still in limbo after months of hearings, the UFC scheduled Penn to fight Joe Stevenson at &quot;UFC 80&quot; on January 19, 2008, for an interim lightweight title. The subsequent final decision by the California State Athletic Commission, which did not overturn Sherk&#x27;s suspension, led to the title being stripped from Sherk and the Penn-Stevenson fight being upgraded to a full title bout, with the winner facing Sherk in their first defense.

====Lightweight Championship====
Penn knocked Stevenson down seconds into the first round with a right uppercut, then took Stevenson down, delivering a well placed elbow from the top position that inflicted a serious cut near Stevenson&#x27;s hairline. In the second round, Stevenson fought more aggressively but was still unable to threaten Penn. Penn worked to back mount and defeated him by rear naked choke at 4:02 of the second round to win the Lightweight Championship. He celebrated the win by licking Joe Stevenson&#x27;s blood off of his gloves. The win for Penn was awarded Beatdown of the Year by Sherdog for 2008. With this win, Penn became the second man (after Randy Couture) to win UFC titles in two different weight classes.

On May 24, 2008, at UFC 84 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada, Penn fought former champion Sean Sherk in his first title defense bout. The fight was billed by color commentator Mike Goldberg as the &quot;biggest fight in the history of the UFC lightweight division&quot;. Sherk attempted to take Penn down only once (in the first round), instead the fighters traded punches and leg kicks for the remainder of the fight. Penn landed jabs several times, utilizing his reach advantage over Sherk. In the closing seconds of the third round, Penn threw a punch and a hook that backed Sherk into the cage. Sherk then ducked under another punch – possibly to shoot for a takedown – when he was hit in the head by a flush flying left knee from Penn. Sherk went down and Penn continued with strikes, but the round ended before the referee stopped the fight. However, Sherk was unable to continue and Penn was declared the victor by TKO (strikes). After the fight, in response a question by Joe Rogan about his future, Penn asked the crowd if they wanted to see him fight Georges St-Pierre and was answered with a loud ovation. Later, Penn told Fighters Club TV that he would face the winner of the UFC 87 Welterweight title fight between Georges St-Pierre and Jon Fitch, which St-Pierre ended up winning by unanimous decision. St-Pierre&#x27;s victory led to the scheduling of B.J.&#x27;s next fight as a Welterweight Championship fight.

====Welterweight title shot====

Penn challenged Georges St-Pierre for St-Pierre&#x27;s welterweight title on January 31, 2009, the night before the Super Bowl. The date led &quot;UFC 94&quot; to be billed as the &quot;UFC Super Bowl Weekend,&quot; and it was anticipated to be the biggest UFC pay-per-view event ever. Before the fight with St-Pierre, Penn made a controversial comment that he was going to try to kill St-Pierre in the ring, but he later explained that he was speaking figuratively.

The first round of the fight was somewhat even, with Penn exercising elusive head movement, fast hands and good take-down defense, thwarting all of St-Pierre&#x27;s take-down attempts while both exchanged punches. In the ensuing three rounds, however, Penn turned out a lackluster performance. St-Pierre scored his first take-down of the night midway through the second round, and by the end of the round Penn was visibly tired. At the start of round three, St-Pierre landed a &quot;superman punch&quot; that bloodied Penn&#x27;s nose and shortly took Penn down again. From that point on, St-Pierre took Penn down almost at will, repeatedly passed Penn&#x27;s renowned guard, and persistently punished the Hawaiian with a ground-and-pound attack. Penn later admitted that he could not recall anything that happened during the 3rd and 4th rounds because &quot;I was probably borderline knocked out or something.&quot; At the end of the fourth round, after more of St-Pierre&#x27;s ground-and-pound onslaught, and upon B.J.&#x27;s command, Penn&#x27;s brother requested that the referee stop the fight. After the fight, Penn failed to attend the post-fight press conference due to having stayed in the hospital.

A controversy arose during the fight as St-Pierre&#x27;s corner-men were spotted rubbing St-Pierre&#x27;s back immediately after applying Vaseline to his face. Members of the Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC) came into the octagon and wiped St-Pierre&#x27;s torso down. Penn later sent a formal request to the NSAC, asking them to investigate. Despite all of the complaints by the Penn camp, the NSAC ruled that there was no infraction. This incident was famously coined by Penn fans as the &quot;Greasegate&quot; and remains as one of the biggest controversial moments in UFC history.

The rules of the UFC were modified so that only the official &quot;cut men&quot; would be allowed to have or apply Vaseline to the fighters. The procedures governing the transition from the fighters walk-in to the cage and while in the cage were also changed. Previously, fighters would walk up next to the cage, see the cut man who would apply Vaseline, be checked by the referee, and then have an opportunity to speak with or hug their coaches or cornermen before entering the cage. To prevent an opportunity for the fighters to have Vaseline applied illicitly, fighters now must first part from any company, have Vaseline applied by the cut man, be checked by the referee, and then go directly to the cage. Finally, no cornermen will be allowed to have Vaseline in the cage between rounds. In this way, the fighter&#x27;s contact with Vaseline is fully controlled by the cut men and referee, who work independently of the UFC.

UFC President Dana White said that the incident had no effect on the outcome of the fight although he wished the incident had not happened. Penn did, after all, quit after the fourth round. In his first post-fight interview Penn spoke of his belief that if St-Pierre were found to have been &quot;greased&quot; he would lose all respect for him, while admitting that &quot;[I] definitely got my butt kicked.&quot; Penn claims that before the match he warned the NSAC that St-Pierre might use grease intentionally. St-Pierre responded to the allegations by offering to fight a rematch against Penn. Penn went on record as accepting the offer for a re-match. Following his informal acceptance of a proposed second rematch, Penn filed a formal complaint with Nevada State Athletic Commission seeking to prevent St-Pierre from fighting by suspending St-Pierre&#x27;s fighter&#x27;s license. In addition, Penn unsuccessfully requested the suspension of St-Pierre&#x27;s cornermen, Greg Jackson and Phil Nurse, a fine of $250,000, and overturning the result of the fight to a no-contest.

====Return as Lightweight Champion====
Penn began negotiations to fight Kenny Florian in the summer of 2009. The Florian-Penn title fight was scheduled for &quot;UFC 99&quot;, but B.J. Penn requested more time off after his fight with GSP. He defended his title against Florian on August 8, 2009, at &quot;UFC 101&quot;. Penn looked noticeably in better physical shape than his previous outings at 155 lbs and negated any sort of takedown offense from Florian the entire match despite his opponent&#x27;s persistence in grappling and engaging the clinch.

On his feet, Penn avoided virtually any damage, constantly stuffing or evading any attempts of a left high kick, punches, or elbows from Florian when the two departed from the clinch. In a measured performance, Penn preferred to pace himself in his standup, occasionally showing explosive bursts of striking up until the fourth round, where he executed a powerful takedown and quickly assumed the half guard position, punishing the contender with elbows until gaining the full mount, where punches followed to continue the ground and pound assault from the BJJ specialist.

A scramble ensued, where Florian gave up his back twice but was unable to escape Penn&#x27;s mount, the second time Penn took his opponent&#x27;s back, he looked to trap Florian&#x27;s arm with one of his legs, but was unable to do so, instead striking the liver of Florian with his heel, which eventually led Penn to secure a rear naked choke at 3:45 of the fourth round to defend his lightweight championship title.

Penn fought Diego Sanchez for the UFC Lightweight Championship on December 12, 2009, at &quot;UFC 107&quot;. Penn negated virtually any offense from the contender, exercising good footwork and elusive head movement whilst remaining flawless in his takedown defense on 27 attempts from Sanchez. He stalked his opponent for large periods of the match and stunned Sanchez early, dropping him; following up with multiple clean shots, which Sanchez showed good durability in weathering. Penn, showing good conditioning for the duration of the bout, continued to stuff all takedowns, punches and left high kicks from Sanchez and dominated with aggressive bursts of striking throughout. He hurt Sanchez several times, until finally rocking him with a flurry in the final round, swarming to finish the combo with a right high kick. The kick opened up a huge cut on Sanchez&#x27;s forehead above his left eye, causing the fight to be halted on doctor&#x27;s advice at 2:47 of the fifth round with a TKO. The victory marked only the second fight in UFC history to end in the fifth round, and also earned Penn the distinction of being the only man to have stopped Sanchez.

The performance marked the third time Penn had successfully finished a fight in defending his UFC Lightweight Championship, setting a new record of lightweight title defenses, by breaking the previous record of two defenses by Jens Pulver. Later during the post-fight press conference UFC President Dana White told the media he was proud of Penn&#x27;s willingness to take MMA more seriously in his training when earlier he felt Penn had coasted through the UFC solely on natural talent.
====Losing the title====
Penn&#x27;s next defense was on April 10, 2010, at &quot;UFC 112&quot; against Frankie Edgar. Despite being an overwhelming favorite coming into the fight, Penn lost the closely contested bout by unanimous decision; breaking his eight-year undefeated streak in the lightweight division. 8 of 9 media outlets scored the bout in favor of Penn. After the fight, Penn congratulated Edgar on winning the belt. Despite this, the results garnered much criticism as many disagreed with the judges decision after the five round fight, having believed that Penn had done enough to earn himself the victory. Due to the controversy surrounding the outcome, an immediate rematch with Edgar was scheduled as his first title defense.

Penn fought Edgar in a rematch at &quot;UFC 118&quot;. Edgar was able to negate his ground offense and control the fight with good movement and striking combinations. All three judges scored the fight 50–45 for Edgar.

====Return to welterweight and hiatus====
Penn fought Matt Hughes at UFC 123 in a rubber match after their previous two fights at UFC 46 and UFC 63. Penn defeated Hughes in 21 seconds of the first round by knockout after flooring Hughes with a right hand and following with additional strikes on the mat. Penn earned knockout of the night honors for his performance.

Following the UFC 123 post-fight press conference, UFC president Dana White said that Penn would fight top welterweight contender Jon Fitch at UFC 127 in Australia. Penn trained with Matt Hughes and Floyd Mayweather Sr. in preparation for the fight. Penn surprised Fitch by taking him to the ground instead of using his stand up skills. The fight ended in a draw, snapping Fitch&#x27;s five fight UFC win streak, and Penn stated that he would gladly have a rematch in the future. UFC matchmaker Joe Silva stated that neither the fans nor the UFC are interested in a Penn-Fitch rematch.

Penn was expected to face Carlos Condit on October 29, 2011, at UFC 137. B.J. Penn relocated his camp to Southern California in an effort to prepare for the bout. Penn was joined in California by former UFC middleweight and Ultimate Fighter winner Kendall Grove and B.J.&#x27;s brother Reagan Penn, as they both prepared for their August 27 fights on the ProElite show in Hawaii. However, on September 7, Condit was pulled from the bout and replaced Nick Diaz in the main event against Georges St-Pierre. Dana White stated that Penn will fight Nick Diaz in the main event at UFC 137 after GSP pulled out due to knee injury. Penn lost via unanimous decision after winning the first round by crisp boxing as well as mixing in a takedown against the former Strikeforce Welterweight Champion, but was unable to mount any significant offense or defense against Diaz&#x27;s stand-up attack in the remaining two rounds.

Immediately following the loss to Diaz, Penn announced his plans to retire, saying into the microphone, &quot;Joe, this was probably the last time you&#x27;ll see me in here. I can&#x27;t keep performing at the top level. That&#x27;s it Joe. I got a daughter and another daughter on the way, I don&#x27;t want to go home looking like this. I&#x27;m done.&quot; On November 1, Penn posted a message to fans on his website indicating that he plans to take some time off, but the retirement decision is not yet official. He said, &quot;I want to thank all the fans for their love and support. I have decided to take some time off to enjoy life, train and teach. I will keep you guys posted with what’s next.&quot; A few months afterwards, B.J. tweeted angrily at both Jon Fitch and Nick Diaz, causing many to believe that Penn would be returning from his retirement within the near future. His manager has stated that the old B.J. is back and could be returning to MMA. In April 2012 UFC president Dana White said B.J. Penn turned down a fight with the reigning Strikeforce Lightweight Champion, Gilbert Melendez, and that Penn wants to continue at 170 pounds &quot;whenever he is ready&quot;. White also said he feels that B.J. Penn deserves to be in the UFC Hall of Fame, stating that he was a pioneer for the lightweight division, at a time when many believed that there couldn&#x27;t be any stars at 155 pounds.

Several months after declaring his retirement from mixed martial arts, B.J. Penn announced that he would be returning to the octagon after repeated challenges made by welterweight prospect Rory MacDonald; stating, &quot;Rory, I accept your challenge!&quot;. Initially, Penn was expected to face Rory MacDonald on September 22, 2012, at UFC 152. However, MacDonald pulled out of the bout after sustaining a cut to the forehead while training. Penn vs. MacDonald eventually took place on December 8, 2012, at UFC on Fox 5. Penn lost the fight via unanimous decision. After the fight Dana White stated that he&#x27;d like to see B.J. Penn retire from mixed martial arts, although Penn has hinted a desire to return to the UFC&#x27;s lightweight division. Following months of silence regarding his future, Penn spoke with Ariel Helwani in an interview for UFC on Fox, where he admitted that he was still undecided on his future, telling him that &quot;at this moment, my guess is probably a little better than yours, but I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m enjoying what I&#x27;m doing.&quot;

====Move to featherweight and losing streak====
An announcement was made on &quot;UFC Tonight&quot; in September 2013 that Penn will return from his hiatus and move to the Featherweight division to coach against rival, Frankie Edgar for the 19th season of &quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot;. This move marked Penn&#x27;s second appearance serving as a head coach for The Ultimate Fighter, his first being &quot;The Ultimate Fighter 5&quot;, opposite Jens Pulver. The season aired on &quot;Fox Sports 1&quot; and featured middleweight and light heavyweight contestants. The two coaches faced each other for the third time on July 6, 2014, at The Ultimate Fighter 19 Finale.

Penn returned to Nova União under coach André Pederneiras (who promoted Penn to black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu in 1999) in preparation for his fight camp against Edgar; training alongside former UFC Bantamweight Champion Renan Barão and UFC Featherweight Champion José Aldo. Later in the camp, he also enlisted former UFC Bantamweight Champion Dominick Cruz in Hilo, Hawaii for his preparation. Penn lost the one sided bout by TKO in the third round. At the conclusion of the bout, Penn announced his intentions to retire again during the event&#x27;s post-fight press conference.

In January 2016, after an 18-month hiatus, the 37 year old Penn announced his intentions to return to active competition with plans to continue in the UFC&#x27;s featherweight division. He was briefly expected to return in April 2016 at UFC 197. However, Penn&#x27;s return was delayed after an investigation into criminal allegations made against him was launched. In turn, Penn was expected to face Dennis Siver on June 4, 2016, at UFC 199. However, Siver was forced out of the bout in early May with an undisclosed injury. He was replaced by Cole Miller. Subsequently, Penn himself was removed from the card on May 23 after he was flagged for the use of a medically administered IV during a non-fight period, when the use of IV had been recently banned 365 days a year.

Penn was expected to face Ricardo Lamas on October 15, 2016, at UFC Fight Night 97. However, on October 4, Penn pulled out of the fight citing an injury. In turn, the promotion announced on October 6 that they had cancelled the event entirely.

After three delays in getting his return fight scheduled, Penn returned to the UFC in early 2017. He faced Yair Rodríguez in the main event on January 15, 2017, at UFC Fight Night 103. Penn lost the one-sided fight via TKO in the second round.

A rescheduled bout with Dennis Siver took place on June 25, 2017, at UFC Fight Night 112. Penn lost the fight by majority decision.

For his next fight, Penn returned to lightweight to face Ryan Hall on December 29, 2018, at UFC 232; it was his third stint in the lightweight division. In preparation for the fight against Hall, Penn returned to train at Nova União. Penn lost the fight via a heel hook submission in the first round.

Penn faced Clay Guida on May 11, 2019, at UFC 237. He lost the fight by unanimous decision.

On July 26, 2019, news surfaced that Penn was expected to face Nik Lentz in a grudge match, at a UFC event to be determined. However, Penn was released from the promotion in early September after video evidence surfaced showing Penn fighting patrons in a bar brawl in Pahoa, Hawaii.

==Personal life==

His nickname &quot;B.J.&quot; is a shortened version of another nickname &quot;Baby Jay&quot;, which itself derives from the fact that Penn is the last of three brothers named &quot;Jay Dee Penn&quot;. B.J.&#x27;s father, who is Irish and English, named 3 of his 4 children &quot;Jay Dee&quot;, while the fourth is Reagan. In order to avoid confusion each of the sons named &quot;Jay Dee&quot; goes by a nickname: &quot;Jay&quot; (Jay Dee Penn), &quot;Jay Dee&quot; (Jay Dee Penn II), and &quot;Baby Jay&quot; (Jay Dee Penn III). Penn&#x27;s mother, Lorraine Shin, is of Hawaiian and Korean descent.

Being born in Hawaii, Penn takes much pride in his Hawaiian upbringing. Penn often plays Hawaiian music during his walk-out entrances, a combination of &quot;Hawaii ’78&quot; into &quot;E Ala E&quot;, both performed by Hawaiian musician Israel Kamakawiwoʻole as a tribute to his Hawaiian heritage and respect for his opponents, fans and the fight game. Penn has also stated that he identifies strongly with his Korean roots and has traveled to South Korea to hold seminars. He also said that he gets his hot temper from his Korean side which helps him use this energy in his fights.

Penn has two daughters with the same mother. He says that they have never married and &quot;it doesn&#x27;t matter that much in Hawaii.&quot;
Penn is the co-author of &quot;Mixed Martial Arts: The Book of Knowledge&quot;, an instructional book on mixed martial arts fighting. Penn, along with Dave Weintraub, authored the autobiography &quot;Why I Fight: The Belt is Just an Accessory&quot; in 2010. The book debuted at #22 on the New York Times bestseller list. Penn also appeared in the film &quot;Never Surrender&quot; in 2009.

Penn was also the subject of a Paternity Lawsuit in relation to a daughter, approximately a year after the girl&#x27;s birth. On the 5th of October, 2021, Penn also announced his intention to run for governor in the 2022 Hawaii gubernatorial election. He lost the Republican primary, ending as the runner-up to winner Duke Aiona. Following the election, he filed a complaint with the Hawaii Supreme Court contesting the results.

In 2024, Penn ran for Hawaii County Council in District 1 (North and South Hilo–Hamakua–Waimea).

== Legal controversies ==
Penn has an extended history of alcohol-induced violence. In January 2015, Penn was arrested in Kihei, Hawaii and charged with assault after a brawl outside of a bar.

In 2019, Penn&#x27;s estranged girlfriend, Shealen Uaiwa, filed a restraining order against him in October from her and Penn&#x27;s children, alleging years of physical and sexual abuse. The order was granted in February 2019 and was in order through October 2021.

In June 2019, an intoxicated Penn fought a bouncer outside of a Honolulu strip club.

On August 27, 2019, Penn was involved in a bar brawl on Hawaii&#x27;s Big Island. Subsequently, Penn was released from the UFC in early September following the incident.

On February 7, 2020, Penn was involved in a single-car accident in his home town of Hilo, Hawaii. According to local media, Penn was allegedly speeding when he lost control of his pickup truck and his vehicle flipped in front of a Hilo shopping mall. Penn was the only occupant of the vehicle, and he was transported to a nearby hospital by ambulance. Penn was investigated by the Hilo Police Department for DUI and his blood was drawn at the scene, but no charges were filed.

On December 8, 2020, a paternity lawsuit was filed against Penn by the mother of his most recent child, Camila Amado.

On January 23, 2021, Penn was arrested in Honokaa, Hawaii, and was charged with DUI. Penn was later released from jail hours after his arrest pending an investigation. Video footage recorded from a bystander shows a handcuffed, drunk, and belligerent Penn yelling racial expletives at the police and the man recording while being assisted into an unmarked police vehicle.

==Legacy and influence==
Since his debut in the Ultimate Fighting Championship, Penn emerged as one of the biggest stars in the history of the sport, headlining a total of eleven main-events (nine pay-per-view main-events) for the UFC during the course of his career (in addition to five for K-1). Penn was regarded as one of the most controversial and outspoken players in the history of mixed martial arts whose influence was considered instrumental in popularizing the UFC around the world in the 2000s and 2010s. His impact on the sport went beyond his UFC titles and dominant performances inside the octagon. A longtime advocate for drug testing in the sport, Penn was also the first to introduce an independent foundation in MMA to promote, coordinate and monitor the fight against performance-enhancing drugs in sports with the inclusion of &quot;Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (VADA)&quot; during his and his opponent&#x27;s training camps.

Recognized for his role in the resurgence of the lightweight division, Penn is considered to have been the division&#x27;s most influential figure, turning the weight class around (in bouts with Sean Sherk, Kenny Florian, Diego Sanchez, Jens Pulver, and Joe Stevenson) to become one of the UFC&#x27;s most popular, at a time when they had considered disbanding the division altogether and many publications had questioned whether lighter-weights could be successful. His nickname, The Prodigy originates prior to him competing in mixed martial arts, from accomplishing his extraordinary feat in the sport of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (earning his black belt in just under three years and winning the black belt division in the World Jiu-Jitsu Championship only three weeks later). His biography on the UFC website expressed this accomplishment as &quot;an astonishing achievement in a sport where it takes the average athlete ten years or more to reach black belt status.

The Ultimate Fighting Championship&#x27;s inaugural signature gym located in Honolulu, Hawaii, &quot; &#x27;UFC Gym BJ Penn&#x27; &quot; is named in Penn&#x27;s honor. The gym has grown to become one of the largest and most successful in the state of Hawaii. Penn (in his knockout victory over former UFC Lightweight Champion Sean Sherk) is featured in the UFC &quot;Evolution&quot; pay-per-view introduction.

===Ranking in mixed martial arts history===
He is widely considered one of the greatest lightweight (155 lbs) competitors in the sport&#x27;s history, and as one of the greatest Welterweight (170 lbs) competitors as well due to his performances against Georges St-Pierre and Matt Hughes. Penn was also simultaneously ranked number one in both of these divisions following his back-to-back submission victories over Takanori Gomi and Matt Hughes, where he is the only fighter to hold such an honor.

Renowned boxing coach Freddie Roach has famously described Penn as the best boxer in all of mixed martial arts. Former UFC Middleweight Champion Anderson Silva, has said on numerous occasions that he believes Penn to be the greatest pound-for-pound fighter in the history of the sport. UFC Hall of Famer, UFC 10 and UFC 11 Tournament Champion and former UFC Heavyweight Champion Mark Coleman acknowledges Penn as his idol in the sport of mixed martial arts. Penn was ranked within the top five in the &quot;FightersOnly! Magazine&quot; &quot; &#x27;100 Greatest Fighters in History&#x27;.&quot;

====UFC Hall of Fame====
During the televised broadcast of UFC 187 in May 2015, it was revealed on Fox Sports that Penn would be inducted into the revamped UFC Hall of Fame under the Modern Category during International Fight week festivities prior to UFC 189.

<doc id="1328249" wikidata="Q3276313" url="?curid=1328249" title="Maelcum Soul">
<text>Patricia Ann Soul (September 22, 1940 – April 5, 1968), known professionally as Maelcum Soul, was an American bartender, artist&#x27;s model, and actress. In the 1960s, she portrayed leading characters in two of filmmaker John Waters&#x27; earliest works, &quot;Roman Candles&quot; and &quot;Eat Your Makeup&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Patricia Ann Soul was born September 22, 1940. She studied painting at the Maryland Institute College of Art and worked at the Fat Black Pussycat Cafe on Minetta Lane in New York City.

== Career ==
Soul later worked as a barmaid at Martick&#x27;s (later Martick&#x27;s Restaurant Francais), a bistro run by Morris Martick on Mulberry Street in Baltimore. Here, she also worked as an artist&#x27;s model. Her role in Baltimore was compared with Paris&#x27; Kiki de Montparnasse. Starting November 4, 1966, Martick&#x27;s hosted &quot;The Maelcum Show&quot; with 25 art works of her nude, created by different artists, including her husband Dudley Gray with various styles and mediums. Some pieces were made of stained glass and cardboard cutouts. During her life, most &quot;young-Turk&quot; artists of Baltimore used Soul as a model. Earl Hofmann painted her as a surrealistic giant towering over Baltimore. In response to the exhibit, Soul reported &quot;It’s very funny to see 25 of yous staring at you. It&#x27;s a happy things, a fun thing, I feel like it’s my birthday.&quot;

John Waters called Maelcum Soul “my first star”, adding &quot;she was ahead of her time&quot;. She was known for her wild looks, with burnt red hair, white chalk makeup, and very long eyelashes. Waters said she scared everyone, including him, but he loved her. She starred in his first Dreamland-produced movie, &quot;Roman Candles&quot;, as the Smoking Nun. For Waters&#x27; next movie, &quot;Eat Your Makeup&quot;, she played the role of the Governess. The third movie she was in was &quot;Dorothy, the Kansas City Pothead&quot;. She was to play the Wicked Witch, but very little was shot and the project was abandoned. Waters said that she was a &quot;big influence&quot; on him, Divine, and his makeup artist, Van Smith.

== Artistry ==
The name Maelcum Soul is said to be of Czech origin. She is described as bohemian &quot;in both the old-baltimore and art-world sense of the word.&quot; Soul was reportedly considered the &quot;Alice Prin&quot; of Baltimore. She was known for dyeing her hair an &quot;iron-ore red&quot; and wearing heavy eyeliner and &quot;hip haberdashery&quot; drawing from the style of the Berlin cabarets of Weimar Republic.

== Personal life ==
Soul married Maryland Art Institute student Dudley Gray. She lived in Baltimore and New York City. Soul was described by John Waters as a bohemian. In 1968, she died from a drug overdose. She is buried in Bohemian National Cemetery in Baltimore.
== Legacy ==
Posthumously, &quot;The Evening Sun&quot; reported that despite a short and &quot;busy&quot; life, Soul achieved &quot;a certain fame.&quot; She became &quot;semilegendary among younger admirers of the beat generation. A dozen artists painted her.&quot; Soul has been described as a &quot;fabled starlet.&quot;

== Filmography ==
*&quot;Roman Candles&quot; (1966) as Smoking Nun
*&quot;Eat Your Makeup&quot; (1968) as Governess
*&quot;Dorothy, the Kansas City Pothead&quot; (1968) as Wicked Witch

<text>This is a list of the largest cities in the European Union according to the population within their city boundary. The cities listed all have populations over 300,000. The list deals exclusively with the areas within city administrative boundaries as opposed to urban areas or larger urban zones (metropolitan areas), which are generally larger in terms of population than the main city (although they can also be smaller).

As some cities have a very narrow boundary and others a very wide one, the list may not give an accurate view of the comparative magnitude of entire urban areas, and thus the figures in the list should be treated with caution. Common examples of confusion are Paris, where the Paris metropolitan area has different boundaries than the city proper, the City of Brussels that is confused with the Brussels-Capital Region, and Portuguese municipalities, where the population of the municipality&#x27;s core may be significantly lower than the total population within its boundaries.

==Cities by population within the city boundary==
Cities in bold are capital cities of their respective countries.

<doc id="1328261" wikidata="Q13562237" url="?curid=1328261" title="Michela Alioto-Pier">
<text>Michela Alioto-Pier (born April 29, 1968) is an American politician and small business owner who served as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors from 2004 to 2011. A Democrat, she represented District 2, encompassing the Marina and Pacific Heights neighborhoods. She previously served as a member of the San Francisco Port Commission. She was appointed to the Board of Supervisors by Gavin Newsom after he was elected mayor, in 2003. Newsom himself was initially appointed to this seat by former mayor Willie Brown.

Alioto-Pier&#x27;s paternal grandfather was former San Francisco mayor Joseph Alioto and her maternal grandfather was Michael J. Driscoll Sr., a former San Francisco port commissioner and former San Francisco supervisor. She is the niece of Angela Alioto, former president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. She is the most recent member of the Alioto family to hold an elected political office in San Francisco.

==Early life==
In 1981, at age thirteen, Alioto-Pier was paralyzed from the waist down when she fell from a ski lift in the Lake Tahoe area. At age seventeen, she was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to the advisory board of the President&#x27;s National Council on Disability. Alioto-Pier later received a degree in anthropology from UCLA. 

==Early political career==
After working as an aide to Vice President Al Gore, Alioto-Pier made her first run for public office at 28 in 1996 against Republican Congressman Frank Riggs in California&#x27;s 1st congressional district, which included Napa, Mendocino, and Humboldt counties, stretching along the coast up to the Oregon border. She won the Democratic nomination, but lost the general election. She is credited with mounting a strong campaign despite the loss. At the time, she ran under the name Michela Alioto.

Shortly after losing that election, Alioto-Pier announced that she would try again in 1998 but withdrew from the race in deference to fellow Democrat (and eventual winner) Mike Thompson. Instead, she ran for the office of California Secretary of State and won the Democratic nomination but ultimately lost against Republican incumbent Bill Jones. She again ran for Secretary of State in 2002, but lost the Democratic nomination to fellow San Franciscan Kevin Shelley, whose father preceded Alioto-Pier&#x27;s grandfather as that city&#x27;s mayor.

==San Francisco Board of Supervisors==
In January 2004, Alioto-Pier was appointed by Mayor Gavin Newsom to his old seat in District 2 on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Although even-numbered districts were not slated for election until 2006, an off-year election was held for District 2 because Alioto-Pier was an appointed supervisor. She ran for the seat in the November 2004 election and won, and in 2006 she ran for a full term and won easily.

As a supervisor, Alioto-Pier was committed to the preservation of St. Brigid&#x27;s Church, which was once slated for demolition. Another top priority for Alioto-Pier was earthquake preparedness, especially important for her district which was hit hard by the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Alioto-Pier explained: &quot;As the district representative for a community that was really hit in Loma Prieta, it is my responsibility to make sure if something like that happens again that we know what we&#x27;re doing.&quot;

In May 2004, she introduced a payroll tax exemption for biotech companies in efforts to create a biotech cluster in San Francisco which was later passed by the full Board of Supervisors. San Francisco had over 250 biomedical companies.

As a San Francisco moderate, Alioto-Pier was attacked by San Francisco progressives for having a poor attendance record and mediocre constituent relations. One significant source of the criticism was over Alioto-Pier&#x27;s attendance record while she was giving birth to her third child, which was a first for an elected official in San Francisco. Alioto-Pier responded by passing a family leave policy for elected officials in San Francisco.

In 2007 it was announced that St. Luke&#x27;s, a hospital serving under-privileged communities, would be closed to acute and sub-acute patients and serve as an outpatient facility only. In January 2008, it was announced that Alioto-Pier would lead a panel of stakeholders to save St. Luke&#x27;s. &quot;Maintaining and rebuilding St. Luke&#x27;s and developing it into a first-class hospital for the Mission District and the Southeast section of San Francisco is my primary objective.&quot; In response to the recommendations of the panel, in September 2008 California Pacific Medical Center (owner of St. Luke&#x27;s) announced a reversal of their decision, stating that St. Luke&#x27;s would be re-built to continue serving the communities that depend upon it.

On July 20, 2009, &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; political columnists Phillip Matier and Andrew Ross broke the story of Alioto-Pier&#x27;s announcement for state insurance commissioner.

Alioto-Pier subsequently left the race for insurance commissioner due to a leg injury.

===Re-election challenge in 2010===

On June 3, 2010, Alioto-Pier submitted papers to register as a candidate for re-election to District Two of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. San Francisco Department of Elections Director John Arntz issued a letter that same day in which he announced she was ineligible to run for re-election for District Two supervisor due to a 2008 ruling regarding term limits issued by City Attorney Dennis Herrera. Arntz wrote, &quot;Accordingly, the Department of Elections cannot list you as a candidate for this office on the November 2, 2010 ballot or any other election materials for that election.&quot; She would have served on the Board of Supervisors for seven years when her term expired in January 2011. Supervisors are limited to serving two four-year terms.

The municipal ordinance providing for term limits was a matter of debate. Some claimed that the ordinance states that any person who has served more than one-and-a-half four-year terms in office (six years) shall be deemed to have effectively served for two full terms and thus be ineligible to seek re-election. Others claimed that the law is more nuanced and that one must be appointed to serve more than two years for it to count as a full term. Alioto-Pier was appointed to serve one year, ran for a two-year term, and then ran again for a four-year term. According to this view, the question is whether or not the year she served as an appointed supervisor and the truncated two years she served can be combined and rounded up to count as a four-year term.

Alioto-Pier challenged the ruling from the Department of Elections in Superior Court and won. In response, Herrera appealed that decision and overturned Alioto-Pier&#x27;s victory, forcing her out of the 2010 election for District 2 Supervisor.

==Candidate for Mayor in 2011==
On February 7, 2011, Alioto-Pier filed as a candidate for mayor of San Francisco. In the November election, she placed ninth in a field of 16 candidates.

==Candidate for the California State Board of Equalization, District 2==
On March 10, 2022, Alioto-Pier filed as a candidate for the California State Board of Equalization, District 2.

<text>Frederick William Nicholls Crouch (30 July 1808 – 18 August 1896) was an English composer and cellist.

==Biography==
Crouch was born in Marylebone in the city of Westminster, in London. He emigrated to the United States in 1849 and settled in Richmond, Virginia. During the Civil War, Crouch took up arms for the Richmond Grays and the 1st Richmond Howitzers, Confederacy.

Crouch was noted as a fine cellist, having played in the King&#x27;s Theatre as well as St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London, before relocating to the United States, but the majority of his compositions were not successful. His most famous song is &quot;Kathleen Mavourneen&quot;. He also set a poem &quot;Donna Dear&quot; a poem by the British poet Katherine Ashton Simpson. 

During his years in the United States, Crouch composed two operas and unsuccessfully tried various musical undertakings (i.e., conducting, singing and teaching). Well traveled after the Civil War, Crouch eventually settled in Baltimore, Maryland.

He was married four times, and was the father of 27 children, including the famous French courtesan Cora Pearl.

He died on 18 August 1896 in Portland, Maine, and was buried on Confederate Hill in Baltimore&#x27;s Loudon Park Cemetery.

After success in the DTM he drove in Formula One from until the 2007 British Grand Prix, shortly after which he was dropped by the Spyker F1 team. In 2008, he returned to the DTM series as a driver for the Audi Futurecom TME team. Albers acted as Team Principal and CEO of the Caterham F1 Team from July to September 2014 after it was acquired by new team owners. His estimated net-worth is $50 million.

==Personal==
Christijan was born in Eindhoven, the son of former rallycross ace and Porsche 911 Carrera campaigner André Albers, who won the 1979 Dutch International Rallycross Championship (GT Division). They are not related to their compatriot Marcel Albers, who was killed in a British Formula Three accident at Thruxton in 1992.

Albers is married to Liselore Kooijman. Their wedding took place on 11 November 2006 in Amsterdam. He resides in Monaco.

==Early career==
Albers began kart racing at a young age, winning the Dutch National championship in 1997. That same year, he was crowned Formula Ford 1800 champion in both Netherlands and Belgium. He also participated in the Renault Megane Marlboro Masters series. In 1998, he moved up to the German Formula Three series, winning the championship in 1999 with six wins and ten poles.

In 2000, Albers raced in the International Formula 3000 championship as team-mate to Mark Webber. He failed to score a point, but team boss Paul Stoddart later signed him again. He also raced in European Formula Racing.

==DTM==
Beginning in 2001, Albers raced in the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters for Mercedes-Benz, and graduated from a privately run team to the works AMG outfit in 2003 after the departure from the series of Uwe Alzen. He was instantly a front-runner, finishing runner-up in 2003 with a season-high four wins, and challenging DTM veteran and multiple champion Bernd Schneider for the title all the way up to the final race. In 2004, he again challenged for the championship lead for most of the season but eventually finished third.

==Formula One==

===Minardi (2005)===

While racing in the DTM, Albers continued to be a test and reserve driver for Minardi&#x27;s Formula One interests, and also drove the team&#x27;s two-seater Formula One cars. In November 2004, he set the fastest time at a Misano di Gera d&#x27;Adda Minardi test session. He was chosen by the team to drive in the Formula One World Championship in 2005. At the 2005 United States Grand Prix he gained his first championship points with a fifth-place finish, a race where only six drivers started.
===Midland/Spyker F1 (2006–2007)===

On 31 October 2005 Albers was confirmed as Midland&#x27;s first official Formula One driver. Midland, the renamed Jordan team, made their debut in the 2006 Formula One season.

Albers started the 2006 season well, out-pacing Midland teammate Tiago Monteiro. However, during the first few races, Midland found themselves battling with the Super Aguri team, particularly Takuma Sato. At the 2006 San Marino Grand Prix, Albers found himself being crashed into by Yuji Ide and sent into a series of spectacular rolls. Incredibly he was unharmed. Ide was reprimanded by the race stewards. Ide also had his Super Licence revoked for severe dangerous driving.

After initial confusion over Albers&#x27;s plans for 2007 after the takeover of MF1 by Spyker Cars, it was eventually confirmed that he would be driving for the Spyker F1 team in 2007.

It was later found out that Albers signed a contract with Midland F1 to remain with the team prior to the sale to Spyker. Albers&#x27;s personal sponsors had major influences in Spyker buying the Midland F1 team.

In early 2007 he was outperformed by rookie team-mate Adrian Sutil. At Magny-Cours he ignored the lollipop telling him not to leave the pits during a pitstop, driving off with part of the fuel rig still attached. Albers expressed relief that nobody was hurt, but he received a €5,000 penalty for dangerous driving. Spyker technical director Mike Gascoyne commented that he was mystified by the mistake.

On 10 July 2007 he was released from his Spyker contract, due to a lack of sponsorship money, which would have compromised the team&#x27;s development programme. Team owner Michiel Mol described it as &quot;one of the toughest decisions of my career&quot;. His replacement for the 2007 European Grand Prix was former Spyker test driver Markus Winkelhock. Sakon Yamamoto then raced for Spyker for the rest of the year.

Albers returned with the Spyker team for the Rotterdam street racing event in the Netherlands, on the 18 / 19 August.

===Team principal at Caterham F1 (2014)===
On 2 July 2014 Tony Fernandes sold the Caterham F1 Team to a consortium of Swiss-Middle Eastern investors. Subsequently, team principal Cyril Abiteboul stepped down and Albers was given his position in the team by the consortium. He ran the team on a day-to-day basis until Caterham collapsed following the 2014 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
==Return to DTM==

Christijan Albers returned to the DTM-series in December 2007 as the Dutchman was invited by the Audi-team of Futurecom TME for a week of testing in Jerez de la Frontera. He tested for this team again on the Mugello Circuit in early March.

Christijan Albers was confirmed as a race driver for the Futurecom TME race team for 2008. He raced alongside Katherine Legge in a 2006 Specification Audi A4 DTM.

Albers is the Netherlands&#x27;s most successful driver in the DTM series, finishing as runner-up in the 2003 championship.
==Sportscar racing==
It was announced on 9 October 2008 that Albers would be racing with Audi Sport North America in the American Le Mans Series. He piloted the #1 R10 TDI, partnered with Emanuele Pirro at Laguna Seca, the ALMS final round. This was another step by Audi to bring youth to their Le Mans programs, following Marcel Fässler&#x27;s two races in the R10. He finished this race in second place behind the #2 car from the same team.

He moved into the Le Mans Series for the 2009 season, moving to the customer Audi team, run by Colin Kolles.

==Helmet design==
Albers&#x27; helmet design consists of an orange helmet with multiple black dots over it. He later changed it to the same design, but with inverted colors.

== Career as TV analyst ==
Albers is part of the permanent team of Formula One analysts for the new Dutch sports broadcaster Viaplay from 2022 onwards. At the Dutch TV channel, Albers is accompanied by other analysts such as former Formula One driver Giedo van der Garde as well as Tom Coronel and former GP2 driver and current WEC driver
Ho-Pin Tung.

<doc id="1328272" wikidata="Q3244962" url="?curid=1328272" title="Pornographic magazine">
<text>Pornographic magazines or erotic magazines, sometimes known as adult magazines or sex magazines, are magazines that contain content of an explicitly sexual nature. Publications of this kind may contain images of attractive naked subjects, as is the case in softcore pornography, and, in the usual case of hardcore pornography, depictions of masturbation, oral, manual, vaginal, or anal sex.

They primarily serve to stimulate sexual arousal and are often used as an aid to masturbation. Some magazines are general in their content, while others may be more specific and focus on a particular pornographic niche, part of the anatomy, or model characteristics. Examples include &quot;Asian Babes&quot; which focuses on Asian women, or &quot;Leg Show&quot; which concentrates on women&#x27;s legs. Well-known adult magazines include &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;Penthouse&quot;, &quot;Playgirl&quot;, and &quot;Hustler&quot;. Magazines may also carry articles on topics including cars, humor, science, computers, culture, and politics. With the continued progression of print media to digital, retailers have also had to adapt. Software such as Apple&#x27;s discontinued Newsstand enabled the downloading and displaying of digital versions of magazines but did not allow pornographic material. However, there are specific digital newsstands for pornographic magazines.

== History ==
Pornographic magazines form a part of the history of erotic depictions. It is a form for the display and dissemination of these materials.

In 1880, halftone printing was used to reproduce photographs inexpensively for the first time. The invention of halftone printing took pornography and erotica in new directions at the beginning of the 20th century. The new printing processes allowed photographic images to be reproduced easily in black and white, whereas printers were previously limited to engravings, woodcuts, and line cuts for illustrations. It allowed pornography to become a mass-market phenomenon, it is becoming more affordable and more easily acquired than any previous form.

First appearing in France, the new magazines featured nude and semi-nude photographs on the cover and throughout; often, burlesque actresses were hired as models. While they would now be termed softcore, they were quite shocking for the time. The publications soon either masqueraded as &quot;art magazines&quot; or publications celebrating the new cult of naturism, with titles such as &quot;Photo Bits&quot;, &quot;Body in Art&quot;, &quot;Figure Photography&quot;, &quot;Nude Living&quot;, and &quot;Modern Art for Men.&quot; The British magazine &quot;Health &amp; Efficiency&quot; (now &quot;H&amp;E naturist&quot;, often known simply as &quot;H&amp;E&quot;) was first published in 1900, and began to include articles about naturism in the late 1920s. Gradually, this material came to dominate – particularly as other magazines were taken over and absorbed. At times in its post-WWII history, &quot;H&amp;E&quot; has catered primarily to the soft-porn market.

Another early form of pornography were comic books known as Tijuana bibles that began appearing in the U.S. in the 1920s and lasted until the publishing of glossy colour men&#x27;s magazines. They were crude hand-drawn scenes often using popular characters from cartoons and culture.

In the 1940s, the word &quot;pinup&quot; was coined to describe pictures torn from men&#x27;s magazines and calendars and &quot;pinned up&quot; on the wall by U.S. soldiers in World War II. While the 1940s images focused mostly on legs, by the 1950s, the emphasis shifted to breasts. Betty Grable and Marilyn Monroe were two of the most popular pinup models. Monroe continued to be a popular model for the men&#x27;s magazines in the 1950s.

The 1950s saw the rise of the first mass market softcore pornographic magazines: &quot;Modern Man&quot; in 1952 and &quot;Playboy&quot; in 1953. Hugh Hefner&#x27;s &quot;Playboy&quot; started a new style of the men&#x27;s glossy magazine (or girlie magazine). Hefner coined the term centerfold, and in the first edition of his &quot;Playboy&quot; used a photograph of a nude Monroe, despite her objections. Another term that became popular with Playboy readers was the &quot;Playboy Playmate&quot;. These new-style magazines featured nude or semi-nude women, sometimes simulating masturbation, although their genitals or pubic hair were not actually displayed.

In 1963, &quot;Lui&quot; started in France to compete against &quot;Playboy&quot;, while Bob Guccione did the same in the United Kingdom in 1965 with &quot;Penthouse&quot;. &quot;Penthouse&#x27;s&quot; style was different from other magazines, with women looking indirectly at the camera, as if they were going about their private idylls. This change of emphasis influenced erotic depictions of women. &quot;Penthouse&quot; was also the first magazine to publish pictures that included pubic hair and full frontal nudity, both of which were considered beyond the bounds of the erotic and in the realm of pornography at the time. In 1965, &quot;Mayfair&quot; was launched in the UK in competition to &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;Penthouse&quot;. In September 1969 &quot;Penthouse&quot; was launched in the U.S., bringing new competition to &quot;Playboy&quot;. In order to retain its market share &quot;Playboy&quot; followed &quot;Penthouse&quot; in the display of pubic hair, risking obscenity charges, and launching the &quot;Pubic Wars&quot;. As competition between the two magazines escalated, their photos became increasingly more explicit. In the late 1960s, some magazines began to move into more explicit displays often focusing on the buttocks as standards of what could be legally depicted and what readers wanted to see.

By the 1970s magazines containing images of the pubic area became increasingly common. In the UK, Paul Raymond acquired and then relaunched &quot;Men Only&quot; in 1971 as a pornographic magazine, and then launched &quot;Club International&quot; in 1972. &quot;Playboy&quot; was the first to clearly show visible pubic hair in January 1971. The first full frontal nude centerfold was &quot;Playboy&#x27;s&quot; Miss January 1972. In 1974, Larry Flynt first published &quot;Hustler&quot; in the US, which contained more explicit material. Some researchers have detected increasingly violent images in magazines like &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;Penthouse&quot; over the course of the 1970s, with them then returning to their more upscale style by the end of the decade. Paul Raymond Publications relaunched &quot;Escort&quot; in 1980 in the UK, &quot;Razzle&quot; in 1983, and &quot;Men&#x27;s World&quot; in 1988.

Sales of pornographic magazines in the U.S. have declined significantly since 1979, with a nearly 50% reduction in circulation between 1980 and 1989. The fact that the U.S. incidence of rape had increased over the same period has cast doubt on any correlation between magazine sales and sex crimes. Studies from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s nearly all confirmed that pornographic magazines contained significantly less violent imagery than pornographic films.

In the 1990s, magazines such as &quot;Hustler&quot; began to feature more hardcore material such as sexual penetration, lesbianism and homosexuality, group sex, masturbation, and fetishes. In the late 1990s and 2000s the pornographic magazines market declined, as they were challenged by new &quot;lad mags&quot; such as &quot;FHM&quot; and &quot;Loaded&quot;, which featured softcore photos. The availability of pornographic DVDs and internet pornography also led to a decline in magazine sales. Many magazines developed their own websites which also show pornographic films. Despite falling sales, the top-selling U.S. adult magazines still maintain high circulations compared to most mainstream magazines, and are amongst the top-selling magazines of any type.

Paul Raymond Publications dominates the British adult magazine market today, distributing eight of the ten top selling adult magazines in the UK. There were about 100 adult magazine titles in the UK in 2001.

==Common features==
Several magazines feature photos of &quot;ordinary&quot; women submitted by readers, for example the &quot;Readers Wives&quot; sections of several British magazines, and &quot;Beaver Hunt&quot; in the US. Many magazines also feature supposed stories of their reader&#x27;s sexual exploits, many of which are actually written by the magazines&#x27; writers. Many magazines contain a high number of advertisements for phone sex lines, which provide them with an important source of revenue.

== Gay magazines ==
An early example of borderline gay pornography was the physique magazine, a genre which had wide circulation in the 1950s and 1960s. Physique magazines mostly consisted of photographs of attractive, scantily-clad young men, and occasionally homoerotic illustrations by gay artists like George Quaintance and Tom of Finland. The magazines contained no overt mentions or depictions of homosexuality and used the pretense of demonstrating bodybuilding techniques or providing photos as visual references for artists, but it was widely understood that they were purchased almost exclusively by gay men. Major examples of the genre include &quot;Physique Pictorial&quot; (the first of its kind, debuting in 1951), &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Man&quot;, and &quot;Grecian Guild Pictorial&quot;.

Shifts in the judicial interpretation of obscenity in the US and elsewhere led to physique magazines being supplanted in the mid-to-late 1960s by new publications which openly acknowledged a gay audience and featured nudity, and later hardcore sex.

==Production, distribution, and retail==
A successful magazine requires significant investment in production facilities and a distribution network. They require large printing presses and numerous specialized employees, such as graphic designers and typesetters. Today a new magazine start-up can cost as much as $20 million, and magazines are significantly more expensive to produce than pornographic films, and more expensive than internet pornography.

Like all magazines, pornographic magazines are dependent on advertising revenue, which may force a magazine to tone down its content.

Depending on the laws in each jurisdiction, pornographic magazines may be sold in convenience stores, newsagents and petrol stations. They may need to be sold on the top shelf of a retail display to prevent children reaching them, hence their euphemistic name &quot;top shelf magazines&quot;. Alternatively it may be necessary to sell them under the counter or in plastic wrappers. Some retail chains and many independent retail outlets do not stock pornographic magazines. They may also be sold in sex shops or by mail order.

<doc id="1328274" wikidata="Q316048" url="?curid=1328274" title="Alan Hollinghurst">
<text>Sir Alan James Hollinghurst (born 26 May 1954) is an English novelist, poet, short story writer and translator. He won the 1989 Somerset Maugham Award and the 1994 James Tait Black Memorial Prize. In 2004, he won the Booker Prize for his novel &quot;The Line of Beauty&quot;. Hollinghurst is credited with having helped gay-themed fiction to break into the literary mainstream through his seven novels since 1988.

==Early life and education==
Hollinghurst was born in Stroud, Gloucestershire, only child of bank manager James Hollinghurst, who served in the RAF in the Second World War, and his wife, Elizabeth. He attended Dorset&#x27;s Canford School.

He studied English at Magdalen College, Oxford, receiving a BA in 1975 and MLitt in 1979. His thesis was on works by three gay writers: Firbank, Forster and Hartley. He house-shared at Oxford with future poet laureate Andrew Motion, and was awarded poetry&#x27;s Newdigate Prize, a year before Motion. In the late 1970s he lectured at Magdalen, then at Somerville and Corpus Christi. In 1981 he lectured at UCL, and in 1982 joined &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, serving as deputy editor, 1985–90.

Hollinghurst discussed his early life and literary influences at length in a rare interview at home in London, published in &quot;The James White Review&quot; in 1997–98.

==Writing==
He won the 2004 Booker Prize for &quot;The Line of Beauty&quot;. His next novel, &quot;The Stranger&#x27;s Child&quot;, made the 2011 Booker Prize longlist.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; has called Hollinghurst &quot;one of the great writers of our time.&quot; The &quot;Sunday Times&quot; has stated &quot;at the sentence level, Hollinghurst remains an English stylist without obvious living equal.&quot;

==Personal life==
Hollinghurst is gay and lives in London. In 2018 he lived with the non-binary writer Paul Mendez, though the two are now separated. Hollinghurst previously said: &quot;I&#x27;m not at all easy to live with. I wish I could integrate writing into ordinary social life, but I don&#x27;t seem to be able to. I could when I started [writing]. I suppose I had more energy then. Now I have to isolate myself for long periods.&quot;

<doc id="1328283" wikidata="Q3892124" url="?curid=1328283" title="Rebecca Guay">
<text>Rebecca Guay is an artist known early in her career as an illustrator, commissioned for work on role-playing games, collectible card games, comic books, as well as work on children&#x27;s literature. Guay subsequently turned primarily toward gallery work, opening her first solo exhibition in 2013 at the R.Michelson Gallery.

==Early life==
Guay received a degree in Illustration from the Pratt Institute in New York City in 1992.

==Career==

===Early career===
After graduation, Guay became an illustrator at Marvel (&quot;2099 Unlimited&quot;) and landed numerous gigs at DC Comics and its Vertigo Imprint, like becoming the full-time penciller for &quot;Black Orchid&quot; and various work with Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;Sandman&quot; universe.

After painting the &quot;&quot; CCG tie-in graphic novels &quot;The Serra Angel&quot; and &quot;Magic the Homelands&quot; in 1995 for Valiant Comics, Guay worked with Wizards of the Coast/Hasbro extensively on the card game itself and was commissioned for anywhere from 3 to 12 cards per release, beginning with &quot;Alliances&quot; in 1996 through the set &quot;Eventide&quot; in 2008. Other TCG/RPG outfits she has been involved with include &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, White Wolf Publishing, Bella Sara and &quot;World of Warcraft Trading Card Game&quot;.

Her other major clients include Topps, Dark Horse Comics, MTV Animation, Lucasfilm, Simon &amp; Schuster, Scholastic, Barefoot Books and Houghton Mifflin.

=== Collaborations ===
Guay has worked with writers such as Jane Yolen (on the children&#x27;s book &quot;Ballet Stories&quot; and the graphic novel adaptation of Yolen&#x27;s &quot;The Last Dragon&quot;), Holly Black, Louise Hawes, Alisa Kwitney, and Bill Willingham on &quot;A Flight of Angels&quot;.

===Gallery work===
After the completion of her last two painted graphic novels in 2011, she began focusing primarily on large scale gallery work done in oil. Her gallery work focuses on the figure with the goal being a strong emotional connection to the audience. She opened her first solo exhibition in September 2013 at the R. Michelson Gallery. Her pieces have since been shown and acquired by private collectors and several museums, including the Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art and the Museum of American Illustration at the Society of Illustrators in New York City.

In a crossover between her gallery work and her work in illustration, one of her pieces, &quot;The Visitor&quot;, was chosen as the cover of &quot;Spectrum 21&quot;.

== Fandom ==
After the release of &quot;Onslaught&quot; (2002), it was reported on Magic the Gathering news sites that Guay had been informed that the seven works she created for the set would be her last. In what the sites reported to be her own words: &quot;the new art director, Jeremy Cranford, thinks my work is too feminine for the vision he has for the game.&quot;

Amid fan outrage, Wizards of the Coast released a statement clarifying their position — that Guay was never fired, but simply not contracted as a freelance artist for &quot;Legions&quot; (2003), and that her work would be used in future sets:

Wizards of the Coast used Guay&#x27;s work for at least seven Magic sets and a number of other products since then. One of the commissioned works, a tribute to the controversy, appeared in the 2004 joke set &quot;Unhinged&quot;:

A card satirizing Jeremy Cranford also appeared in Unhinged:

=== Evolution ===

In 2014 Guay launched a Kickstarter project collecting her artworks from 1993 to 2014, &quot;EVOLUTION&quot;. It was successfully funded by her fans in March of the same year (reaching over three times its intended goal of $36,000 at $124,057) and arrived from publication in January, 2015.

==Teaching==
Guay has been an instructor at the Pratt Institute and a guest lecturer at the Savannah College of Art and Design, University of Massachusetts, Rhode Island School of Design and the Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art. Guay is also the creator of two professional mentorship programs, the Illustration Master Class at Amherst College and its online sister program, the SmArt School.

==Awards and honors==
Guay&#x27;s work won as Best in Show at Gen Con in 2004, and she was elected Best Artist in 2005 by &quot;InQuest Magazine&quot;″s Fan Choice Awards.

Guay&#x27;s work on &quot;Sandman: The Book of Destiny&quot; was nominated for Eisner Award in 1998, and &quot;Flight of Angels&quot; for Vertigo was a 2013 YALSA pick.

Guay has received multiple awards for her gallery work and has been the recipient of several industry honors, including two gold medals from Spectrum.

==Personal life==
Guay resides in Amherst, Massachusetts with her husband, artist Matthew Mitchell.

<text>&quot;Kathleen Mavourneen&quot; is a song written in 1837, composed by Frederick Crouch with lyrics by a Mrs. Crawford. Crawford&#x27;s name is variously cited as Annie, Julia, Louise Macartney, Louise Matilda Jane, or Marion; Crouch is also sometimes incorrectly cited as the author of the song&#x27;s lyrics. It was popular during the American Civil War. &quot;Mavourneen&quot; is a term of endearment derived from the Irish Gaelic &quot;mo mhuirnín&quot;, meaning &quot;my beloved&quot;.

The Irish soprano Catherine Hayes (1818–1861)—the first Irish woman to sing at La Scala in Milan—learned &quot;Kathleen Mavourneen&quot; while training in Dublin. It became her signature tune during concerts, and she sang it for Queen Victoria and over 500 royal guests during a performance at Buckingham Palace in June 1849. &quot;Kathleen Mavourneen&quot; gained popularity with American audiences as a direct result of Hayes&#x27;s international concert tours between 1851 and 1856.

The song plays a prominent role in Michael Shaara&#x27;s American Civil War historical novel &quot;The Killer Angels&quot; and its film adaptation &quot;Gettysburg&quot;. Confederate Brigadier General Lewis A. Armistead recalls a dinner at the marital home of his best friend—the now-Union Major General Winfield Scott Hancock—at the U.S. Army garrison in Los Angeles, California in 1861 (at which time Armistead was a major and Hancock a captain), and that the song was sung there that night. This was the night before Armistead and several other Southern officers were to depart for the Confederacy, having resigned their US Army commissions. Armistead and Confederate Brigadier General Richard B. Garnett—who was also present at the dinner—go on to be killed and Hancock to be severely wounded as Armistead&#x27;s and Garnett&#x27;s brigades assault the position defended by Hancock&#x27;s II Corps on Cemetery Ridge in Gettysburg during Pickett&#x27;s Charge. During &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, &quot;Kathleen Mavourneen&quot; is sung once by an Irish tenor at the Confederate camp and thereafter is used frequently as a theme in Randy Edelman&#x27;s musical score for the film.
Several silent films were titled &quot;Kathleen Mavourneen&quot;, the first such drama being produced in 1906 starring Kitty O&#x27;Neil, Walter Griswoll and H.L. Bascomb. Other such silent films were produced in 1911, 1913 and 1919, the last of these starring Theda Bara. Two sound films with this title were produced, in 1930 and 1937. At the release of the 1919 film, Irish and Catholic groups protested not only the depiction of Ireland but the use of a Jewish actress for the leading role. Fox Film Corporation pulled the film after several movie-theater riots and bomb threats.

The song was sung in an episode of the TV series Maverick featuring Roger Moore as Beau Maverick. (The Bold Fenian Men Series 4 Episode 14.)
