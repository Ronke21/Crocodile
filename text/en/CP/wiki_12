<doc id="1316216" wikidata="Q5048759" url="?curid=1316216" title="Cashmere, New Zealand">
<text>Cashmere () is a suburb which rises above the southern end of the city of Christchurch in New Zealand&#x27;s South Island, on the north side of the Port Hills. It covers an area of and has a population of 6,453 as at 2018. 

Cashmere is prone to hill related hazards such as rock fall, cliff collapse and landslips. 

==Geography==
Cashmere is situated on the north side of the Port Hills, immediately above the southern terminus of Colombo Street and approximately five kilometres south of the city centre. The suburb&#x27;s location on the Port Hills offers it a commanding view over the rest of the mostly flat city. Cashmere&#x27;s proximity to the rest of the Port Hills has also made it a favourite for recreation, with the upper reaches of the suburb dominated by Victoria Park with its multiple bike and walking tracks and connections to further tracks running the length of the Port Hills. Above Victoria Park is Sugarloaf, a peak which is the location of a transmission tower used for local radio and TV stations. The Ōpāwaho / Heathcote River marks the northern extent of the suburb, flowing roughly along the base of the Port Hills. Cashmere is prone to hill related hazards such as rock fall, cliff collapse and landslips.

=== Canterbury earthquakes ===
Cashmere was hit hard by the 4 September 2010 Canterbury and 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquakes. The fault rupture (a &#x27;blind&#x27; fault) extended from Cashmere east-northeast to the estuary area. A GNS report on land instability indicated 36 areas of mass movement. The fault caused extensive damage due to rockfalls, land movement and cliff collapse. Following the quake, deep tension cracks and rents on slopes indicated areas with potential for further collapse. Rock fall included both cliff collapse and boulder roll, loess landsildes, retaining wall and fill failures. Hundreds of houses were damaged by rock fall, landslides and ground cracking.

==History==

The Māori name for the area occupying modern-day Cashmere is &quot;Te Iringa-o-Kahukura&quot;. According to Māori mythology, the Māori name reflects a demigod who uplifted a wooden figure of Kahukura near the eastern edge of Dyers Pass who also recited a karakia.

Cashmere takes its name from Sir John Cracroft Wilson&#x27;s farm in the area, which in turn was named after his birthplace of Kashmir (with Cashmere being the British spelling of that region at the time). Wilson briefly moved to Christchurch in 1854 from India by way of Australia, where he purchased 108 hectares of land to develop into Cashmere farm. Wilson built multiple farm buildings on the property, some of which persist to this day. In 1979, the house Wilson built for his Indian workers became a function centre known as &quot;The Old Stone House&quot;. The building has been significantly damaged and restored twice, following a fire in 1971 and earthquakes in 2010 and 2011.

In the late 19th century, the area around Cashmere began to be settled by Europeans. Homes began to be built in Cashmere in the 1890s, although informal church services were being held as early as the 1880s. In response to the growth of this congregation, land from John Cracroft Wilson donated land for a church, which was completed in 1908 and marked the parish&#x27;s formal split from neighbouring Sydenham. At roughly the same time, the Christchurch tramway system was extended to include the area, with the previous Cashmere line being extended from the southern end of Colombo street to the future site of the Sign of the Takahe. The tram line continued operation until 1954, with Cashmere gaining a reputation as one of the country&#x27;s more well-to-do and refined suburbs in the process. This reputation continues to the present day, with the 2018 census showing that Cashmere has a significantly higher percentage of incomes over NZ$70,000 than the rest of Christchurch city.

<text>Originally a separate village, Halswell is now a residential suburb of Christchurch, New Zealand, located southwest of Cathedral Square on State Highway 75.

==History==
Halswell is named after Edmund Halswell QC (1790–1874), a government officer and member of the management commission of the Canterbury Association. He arrived in New Zealand in 1841 and was appointed Commissioner of Native Reserves. The Māori name of Tai Tapu for the area is preserved in the name of a village located some south of the centre of Halswell.

==Overview==
Until fairly recently, Halswell was completely separated from the city geographically. In the 1960s the suburb of Oaklands was established to the north of the original Halswell village, and this expanded further when Westlake was developed in the late 1980s. The subdivision of Aidanfield in the 1990s effectively joined Halswell to the Christchurch urban area. 

The Rocks subdivision was established at the top of Kennedy&#x27;s Bush Road, which is situated on the Port Hills, while the rest of Halswell sits on the flat ground of the Canterbury Plains.

Since the Christchurch earthquakes of 2011, the Halswell area has been growing rapidly, with subdivisions now extending in all directions. Longhurst and Knights Stream have been developed to the west, with amenities such as a medical centre, kindergarten and shopping hub.

Halswell has a public swimming pool, library, community hub, Catholic, Anglican, and United churches, and a post office with Kiwibank. The Halswell Quarry Park is a family orientated park maintained by the Christchurch City Council. The park features all weather walking tracks, a network of mountain bike tracks, dog and horse exercise areas as well as native and exotic planted areas. Although named for this suburb, the quarry is located in the adjacent suburb Kennedys Bush.

Halswell Domain is a park in the centre of Halswell. It includes a playground and skate park, a boating pond and a miniature railway, which runs on Sunday afternoons. On the edge of Halswell Domain is the Halswell War Memorial, unveiled in 1924 by Sir Heaton Rhodes MP.

The Nottingham Stream flows through the suburb and joins the Halswell River.

<doc id="1316228" wikidata="Q5904115" url="?curid=1316228" title="Hornby, New Zealand">
<text>Hornby is a major residential and retail suburb at the western edge of Christchurch, New Zealand. The suburb is directly connected to other parts of Christchurch and the South Island by a number of main arterial routes, including State Highway 1 and the Christchurch Southern Motorway. 

==History==

===European settlement===

During the early stages of European settlement, Hornby was originally referred to as Southbridge Junction – with the junction acting as the start of the main road south.

Due to rising confusion with the nearby town of Southbridge, a decision was made to rename the area to Hornby in 1878, although the origins of this name are unclear. One explanation holds that the suburb was named after Hornby-with-Farleton in Lancashire by Frederick William Delamain, who came to Christchurch from England in 1852. Delamain owned a nearby homestead, which gave its name to the nearby suburb of Yaldhurst, and was a prominent figure in the area during the latter half of the 19th century. Another version suggests that the name refers to Geoffrey Hornby, who was the Admiral of the British flying squadron and who visited Christchurch in 1870, just prior to the suburb being renamed on 2 September 1878.

===Modern history===

In 1922, the suburb was chosen by Kempthorne Prosser to be the location for a new super-phosphate plant, used to develop fertiliser. The plant was the company&#x27;s first in Christchurch and third overall, developed in response to an 1881 incentive from the New Zealand government to facilitate the construction of a local fertiliser industry. This fertiliser plant remains in operation, and is now run by Ravensdown limited, which bought Kempthorne Prosser in 1978. The plant was the location of a large fire in 2018, which prompted nearby evacuations in fear of an explosion and caused thick black smoke to be visible across the region.

Prior to the development of adjacent suburbs such as Wigram, Hornby&#x27;s isolation from the rest of Christchurch as a result of Wigram Aerodrome and the industrial estates of Sockburn led to it occasionally being considered a town in its own right, however officially it has always been a suburb of Christchurch. Hornby is home to a velodrome and a BMX track. In the past, it has been the location for &quot;Westside Party in the Park&quot;, a free Christmas concert.

In April 2024, a new community centre and swimming pool facility opened. It is called the Matatiki Hornby Centre.

==Demographics==

<text>Sydenham () is an inner suburb of Christchurch, New Zealand, south of the city centre, on and around the city&#x27;s main street, Colombo Street. It is a residential, retail and light industrial suburb.

==History==

While the Sydenham area had seen development from the earliest days of European settlement in Christchurch, it was originally split between the Heathcote and Spreydon road districts instead of being a locality of its own right. The name Sydenham originally referred only to &quot;Sydenham House&quot;, a crockery and china shop in the area so named by its owner, Charles Prince, after the north-west Kent town of Sydenham, which is now a London suburb within the London Borough of Lewisham. At a meeting regarding the formation of a borough council for the area, brought on by growth in the area, surveyor and future mayor Charles Allison advocated for the area to be named Sydenham, after the shop. The name was agreed upon, and Sydenham Borough Council came into existence in 1876. The first council and its mayor, George Booth, were elected in 1877. The population of the borough around this time was between five and six thousand, a number which doubled by the end of the 19th century, making it among the largest boroughs in New Zealand at the time.

Sydenham quickly flourished as a suburb. By 1902, the population of the suburb had more than doubled since its formation, making it the largest borough in New Zealand. It had roughly 2500 buildings with a combined value of roughly one million pounds, of roads, and 95 gas lamps for street lighting. On 31 March 1903, the borough amalgamated with the City of Christchurch and became a suburb. At that time Sydenham already had its own swimming-baths, fire-engine, cemetery and recreation grounds.

The shopping precinct located on Colombo Street was badly affected by the 2010 and 2011 Christchurch earthquakes with many commercial buildings demolished. Approximately 35 sites lost buildings.

The Christchurch City Council produced a master plan in 2012 for redeveloping Sydenham after the earthquakes.

The business district located south of Moorhouse Avenue was nicknamed &quot;SoMo&quot; by Lonely Planet in 2012.

There were around 800 businesses employing 5000 people in Sydenham in 2013. The business precinct had branded itself as &quot;Sydenham Quarter&quot;. This marketing campaign was part of the Sydenham master plan.

The Sydenham school site surrounded by Colombo, Brougham, Buchan and Waverley streets was purchased by the New Zealand Government from the Christchurch City Council for $4.5 million dollars in 2015. This was then sold to Fletchers who built 76 terrace style houses on the site and named the development &quot;350 Colombo&quot;.

==Geography==
Sydenham is located near the centre of Christchurch, and is separated from the central city by the South Island Main Trunk Railway and Moorhouse Avenue. State Highway 76 runs through the middle of Sydenham before connecting to the Christchurch Southern Motorway in the neighbouring suburb of Spreydon to the west. A number of suburbs are located to the south of Sydenham at the base of the Port Hills, including Somerfield, Beckenham and Cashmere. To the east, Sydenham is separated from neighbouring St Martins by the Ōpāwaho / Heathcote River, and from Waltham by Waltham Road.

<text>Bagombo Snuff Box is a collection of 23 short stories written by Kurt Vonnegut. The stories were originally published in US periodicals between 1950 and 1963, and consisted of virtually all of Vonnegut&#x27;s previously published short fiction of the 1950s and 60s that had not been collected in 1968&#x27;s &quot;Welcome to the Monkey House&quot;. This collection was published in 1999 by G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons.

Vonnegut revised three stories for publication in this collection: &quot;The Powder-Blue Dragon&quot; (1954), &quot;The Boy Who Hated Girls&quot; (1956), and &quot;Hal Irwin&#x27;s Magic Lamp&quot; (1957). The unrevised version of &quot;Hal Irwin&#x27;s Magic Lamp&quot; was anthologized in &quot;Canary in a Cat House&quot; (1961). The final work in the collection, &quot;Coda to My Career as a Writer for Periodicals&quot;, is an essay in which Vonnegut reflects on the writing of the stories in this collection, and the person he was at the time.

The title story, &quot;Bagombo Snuff Box&quot;, was adapted into a short film by Igor Stanojević. The film, called &quot;Čovek iz Bagomba&quot; or &quot;The Man from Bagombo&quot;, stars Dragan Jovanović and Gala Videnović; it premiered in 2010.

<doc id="1316266" wikidata="Q1064900" url="?curid=1316266" title="Asahi Broadcasting Corporation">
<text>is a certified broadcasting holding company headquartered in Osaka, Japan. Until March 31, 2018, it was a unified radio and television broadcaster serving in the Kansai region.
On April 1, 2018, its radio and television broadcasting divisions were spun off into two subsidiaries, with taking over the radio broadcasting business, and took over television broadcasting.

==History==

===Radio===
In 1948, when the Asahi Shimbun set up a committee for a private radio station in Tokyo, the name ABC was decided upon to be the name of the station. Asahi Broadcasting requested licenses in December 1949 to both Tokyo and Osaka, but in December 1950, the original company merged with Tokyo Broadcasting (Dentsu), Yomiuri Broadcasting and Radio Nippon (funded by Mainichi Shimbun) to create Radio Tokyo (JOKR, KRT, now TBS). In 1951, the ABC plan was revived for a new radio station in Osaka.

The new Asahi Broadcasting Corporation was founded in Nakanoshima, Kita-ku, Osaka on March 15, 1951, with Mitsujirō Ishii appointed as its first president. ABC started AM radio broadcasting on November 11 (1010 kHz). It became the third commercial radio station to sign-on in Japan overall.

On April 1, 1958, the station relocated to the Shin-Asahi Building and in June, started simultaneous broadcasts with KRT Radio, carrying the first commercial radio simulcasts between Tokyo and Osaka. The frequency output doubled from 10KW to 20 in 1959.

After joining JRN in 1965, ABC moved again to the ABC Center in 1966. The output increased again in 1971, this time to 50KW. In line with changes to the frequency plan set up by the ITU, ABC Radio moved from 1010 kHz to 1008 kHz on November 23, 1978.

On April 1, 1989, the station adopted ABC Radio as its commercial name.

On March 19, 2016, ABC started broadcasting over the Wide FM band, alongside OBC and MBS.

===Television===
Japan&#x27;s private TV began with the idea of Masori Matsutaro, the owner of the Yomiuri Shimbun, to use the microwave communication network to build a TV station covering the whole of Japan. In July 1952, Nippon Television in Tokyo obtained a television preparatory license and became Japan&#x27;s first private television station. At the same time, Sankei Shimbun, Kyoto Broadcasting, Kobe Broadcasting, Yomiuri Shimbun and other companies also intended to set up private TV stations in Osaka Prefecture, and the two private broadcasting stations in Kansai, Asahi Broadcasting and New Japan Broadcasting Company (currently Mainichi Broadcasting System) decided to join forces. In August 1952, Asahi Broadcasting and Nippon Broadcasting revoked their original application for a TV license, and jointly applied for a TV license in the name of (OTV, renamed &quot;Osaka TV Broadcasting&quot; in August of the following year). In the following year, Osaka TV Broadcasting purchased land in Dojimahama-dori, Osaka City, for the construction of the headquarters&#x27; building. Osaka TV Broadcasting also selected the trademark through public solicitation in newspapers. On December 3, 1955, Osaka TV Broadcasting obtained the preparatory license; the call sign is JOBX-TV. Before broadcasting, OTV set a goal of 40% self-made programs, and decided to rebroadcast the programs of Tokyo&#x27;s KRT TV and Nippon TV at the same time to maximize profits. In order to popularize television, OTV also set up 60 street TV sets in various parts of Kansai before the broadcast started. In November 1956, Osaka TV Broadcasting began to conduct trial broadcasts, broadcasting 2.5 hours of programs every day. At 9:30am on December 1, 1956, OTV officially started broadcasting, becoming the first private TV station in Kansai. At the beginning of the broadcast, TV dramas, audience-participating programs, and news programs accounted for nearly half of all programs broadcast on Osaka TV. Osaka TV purchased two taping machines in 1958 and was the first TV station in Japan to introduce video recording facilities. In the same year, Osaka TV also achieved Japan&#x27;s first live broadcast from the top of Mount Fuji.

In January 1957, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications issued a new basic policy for the VHF band in Japan at the same time as OTV, and the metropolitan areas outside Tokyo were allocated more TV channels. There were also 7 operators in Kansai who applied for TV licenses, and Asahi Broadcasting and Mainichi Broadcasting also joined the list of operators applying for TV licenses. However, due to the limited number of channels, the two parties finally agreed to apply for a new station license from Mainichi Broadcasting after the talks between the two parties, while Asahi Broadcasting and Osaka TV Broadcasting merged. At that time, among the employees of TV Broadcasting in Osaka, 200 people wanted to stay in the new company after the merger, and 104 people wanted to join Mainichi Broadcasting. At the same time, because Nippon Television stopped providing programs to Osaka TV after Yomiuri TV started broadcasting in August 1958, Osaka TV and KRT TV established a network relationship. On June 1, 1959, Osaka TV Broadcasting and Asahi Broadcasting merged on an equal basis to become the TV division of Asahi Broadcasting.

<doc id="1316267" wikidata="Q650446" url="?curid=1316267" title="Uriah Tracy">
<text>Uriah Tracy (February 2, 1755July 19, 1807) was an American lawyer and politician from Connecticut. He served in the US House of Representatives (1793 to 1796) and the US Senate (1796 to 1807). From May to November 1800, Tracy served as President pro tempore of the United States Senate.

==Youth, family life and early career==
Tracy was born in Franklin in the Connecticut Colony. In his youth, he received a liberal education. His name is listed among those in a company from Roxbury that responded to the Lexington Alarm at the beginning of the American Revolutionary War. He later served in the Roxbury Company as a clerk

In 1778, Tracy graduated from Yale University, his contemporaries including Noah Webster. He was admitted to the bar in 1781 and then practiced law in Litchfield for many years.

Tracy had five children with Susannah Bull; Sally, Susan, Julia, George and Caroline. All five would survive to adulthood. His daughter Sally was married to jurist James Gould.

==Political career==
He served in the state legislature in 1788 to 1793 and in the US House of Representatives from April 8, 1793 to October 13, 1796 after he had been chosen as a Federalist.

He resigned his seat when he was elected to the US Senate in place of Jonathan Trumbull Jr., who had resigned. 

He has the distinction of being the first member of Congress to be interred in the Congressional Cemetery. His descendants include the mathematician Curtis Tracy McMullen and the author Jeanie Gould.

In 1803, he and several other New England politicians proposed secession of New England from the union because of the growing influence of
Jeffersonian Democrats that had been helped by the Louisiana Purchase, which they felt further diminished Northern influence.

===Death and aftermath===
Tracy died in Washington, D.C on July 19, 1807 at the age of 52, of a long illness which caused dropsy. He was buried at Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

On October 25, 1807, Chauncey Goodrich was elected by the Connecticut General Assembly to serve the remaining portion of Tracy&#x27;s term.

==Legacy==
His portrait, painted by Ralph Earl, is in the collection of the Litchfield Historical Society in Litchfield, Connecticut.

<doc id="1316272" wikidata="Q7999696" url="?curid=1316272" title="Wigram">
<text>Wigram is a suburb in the southwest of Christchurch, New Zealand. The suburb lies close to the industrial estates of Sockburn and the satellite retail and residential zone of Hornby, and has undergone significant growth in recent years due to housing developments. It is seven kilometres to the west of the city centre.

==Etymology==
The suburb is named after Sir Henry Wigram, mayor of Christchurch from 1902 to 1903, who established a flying school there in 1916. Wigram kept the aviation school going until March 1923, when the government decided to take over the company and run the airbase under a military umbrella. The final purchase price was £31,012.

In June 1923 the base was officially handed over and renamed Wigram Aerodrome. Wigram continued to support the base, gifting a further of land in 1932.

==History==
The first trans-Tasman flight touched down in Wigram on 11 September 1928 at 9.22 a.m. Piloted by Australian&#x27;s Charles Kingsford Smith and Charles Ulm they departed Richmond, west of Sydney flying the &quot;Southern Cross&quot;. The welcome was tremendous. A crowd of 30,000 people, one quarter of the total population of Christchurch at that time, turned out to see this historic event. A plaque on the landing site at Wigram Skies commemorates the event. The Heritage Reserve, located on Bennington Way in the George West neighbourhood, marks the actual location of the touchdown by the Southern Cross. The commemorative plaque placed nearby was originally used in 1978 to mark the 50th Anniversary of this landing.

The worst RNZAF crash in New Zealand history occurred at Wigram on 15 October 1953, killing seven men. Two Royal New Zealand Air Force De Havilland Devons, the NZ1811 and NZ1810 from RNZAF Station Wigram, collided over Wigram Aerodrome. They had been part of the last section of a 27 aircraft flypast over Harewood International Airport (as Christchurch airport was then called) marking the 1953 London to Christchurch Air Race Prize Giving Ceremony. When the formation broke up as the aircraft prepared to land back at Wigram, NZ1811 was struck on the wing by its “No. 2”, NZ1810. Sixty-five years after the fatal air collision, a plaque, inset into a boulder and featuring the names of the flight crew has been placed next to a memorial seat in a reserve at the end of Edwin Ebbett Place. All seven crew members are remembered by street names in the area such as Erling Ziesler Lane.

Wigram was home to RNZAF Wigram, one of the main bases of the Royal New Zealand Air Force, but this was closed in 1995 after cutbacks in military spending. The majority of Wigram Aerodrome was purchased by Ngāi Tahu in 1997, and continued to be used as a private airfield until it was finally closed on 1 March 2009. The RNZAF retained the original portion of the aerodrome which had been purchased by the Crown for the purpose of an Air Force base in 1923, an area which includes the Air Force Museum of New Zealand.

The 21st century has seen several subdivision developments being undertaken in Wigram.

=== Wigram Skies ===
The remainder of the former airfield was subdivided by Ngāi Tahu Property into the Wigram Skies development following its closure. Street names in the new development reflect the area&#x27;s aviation heritage, with names such as Corsair Drive, Kittyhawk Avenue and Skyhawk Road alongside The Runway – a road which follows the route of the former runway.

=== Broken Run (East) ===
In 2005, this subdivision created six new roads and two new formed and sealed rights of way to provide access to 126 new residential allotments, and six new reserves totalling 2.8 hectares.

The subdivision has been named “Broken Run” by Brian Gillman Limited, as the land before development was a grazing farm with a natural valley and waterway splitting the farm into two halves, thus being a broken farm or run. The property is located at the headwaters of the Heathcote River.

The road names in Broken Run share a common theme of high country stations, e.g. Longspur Avenue (Longspur is a high country station near the Rakaia Gorge) and Highpeak Place (Highpeak Station is located at the head of the Selwyn River).

=== Broken Run (West) ===
Surplus land from Christchurch&#x27;s Southern Motorway extension was purchased in 2013 and subsequently developed by Gillman Wheelans in 2015. The Western part of Broken Run backs onto the original Broken Run subdivision separated by the Heathcote River.
The subdivision created sixty-one residential allotments, two allotments to vest in the Council as reserve, and a further four allotments vested as legal road.

The road names for this stage continued the theme from the original Broken Run subdivision of high country farms e.g. Four Peaks Drive (Four Peaks Station, near Fairlie in South Canterbury).

==Geography==
Wigram is north of Aidanfield, separated by the Christchurch Southern Motorway. Wigram also borders several other suburbs:

Middleton to the east, separated by Curletts Road.

Hornby to the west and northwest separated by Awatea Road (properties on Awatea road are not part of Wigram except a small number of properties on the east side of Awatea Road (numbers 65–135 inclusive), Springs Road and Main South Road (properties located on these roads are not part of Wigram)

Sockburn to the north separated by the Main South Line Railway

Hillmorton to the southeast separated by Curletts Road and the Heathcote River (Ōpāwaho)

==Economy==
===Commercial===
The Landing, located at the heart of Wigram Skies, provides a convenient and modern retail and mixed use space for Wigram Skies residents and greater south west Christchurch.
Stage one of The Landing, which was completed in mid-2015, has a 8975 sqm site area, including 2000 sqm of retail and office space spread across three buildings and a 2600 sqm New World supermarket.

Stage Two, which was completed in 2017 boasts a 3509sq m site area, including 1800sq m of retail, 600sq m of office space, and 451sq m of hospitality spread across three buildings.

The latest development, a new Cimena Complex with eight cinema screens, each seating 48 people, is set to Open in July 2021

===Industrial===
One of the hotspots in the Christchurch scene is Wigram Business Park, developed by Ngāi Tahu, with most of the properties sold to owner occupiers. It is located on Hayton Road on approximately 25 hectares of zoned Business 4 and has 52 lots. It adjoins Hayton Stream and multiple reserves which separate it from Wigram Skies.

The park is now home to a prestigious collection of occupiers and is very popular among businesses wanting to occupy modern, state-of-the-art premises on quality land to the west of Christchurch.

Wigram Business Park provides for businesses in Christchurch who were expanding but also offered a safe alternative for operators who were looking at relocating or re-establishing their businesses after earthquakes. One example is the purchase by NZX 50 listed Skellerup of a 3.4-hectare site in 2013 for $7.1 million which was subsequently developed into a $30 million, 18,900-square-metre purpose built manufacturing and office facilities to replace their quake-damaged Woolston site.

<text>Gideon Tomlinson (December 31, 1780 – October 8, 1854) was a United States senator, United States Representative, and the 25th Governor for the state of Connecticut.

==Biography==
Born in Stratford, Tomlinson completed preparatory studies and graduated from Yale College in 1802. He went to Virginia for a year to be a private tutor and to study law. When he returned to Fairfield he continued his studies and was admitted to the bar in 1807. That same year he married Sarah Bradley. He received a Master of Arts, in 1808 from Yale. Their only child, Jabez Huntington Tomlinson, was born in 1818 but died at the young age of 19 in 1838. Mrs. Tomlinson died in 1842. In 1846, Gideon married Mrs. Lydia Ann Wells Wright, widow of William Wright of Bridgeport, Connecticut.

==Career==
Tomlinson entered politics in 1817, as clerk of the Connecticut House of Representatives, and was reelected again in 1818, when he served as speaker. He was Delegate to the State Constitutional Convention in 1818.

Elected to the Sixteenth and to the three succeeding United States Congresses, Tomlinson served as a Representative from March 4, 1819 to March 3, 1827, and was chairman of the Committee on Commerce (Nineteenth Congress).

Winning the 1827 gubernatorial nomination, Tomlinson was elected Connecticut&#x27;s eighth governor. He was reelected to the governor&#x27;s office in 1828, 1829, and 1830. During his tenure, prison reform was accomplished in 1827 with the opening of a more civilized penitentiary. His administration advocated educational improvements and fiscal support to the public school system. On March 2, 1831, Tomlinson resigned from office to accept an appointment to the U.S. Senate.

Tomlinson served in the United States Senate and served from March 4, 1831, to March 3, 1837. There, he served as chairman of the Committee on Pensions (Twenty-third and Twenty-fourth Congresses). In 1837, he left the Senate and became the first President of the newly chartered Housatonic Railroad Company.

He was a trustee of Trinity College, then retired to private life.

==Death and legacy==
Tomlinson died in Fairfield on October 8, 1854. He is interred at the Old Congregational Cemetery, Stratford, Connecticut. The Tomlinson Bridge (built 1796-98) of Fair Haven (part of New Haven) Connecticut is named after him. The Tomlinson Middle School in Fairfield is named in his honor.

<text>Truman Smith (November 27, 1791 – May 3, 1884) was a Whig member of the United States Senate from Connecticut from 1849 to 1854 and a member of the United States House of Representatives from Connecticut&#x27;s 4th and 5th congressional districts from 1839 to 1843 and from 1845 to 1849. He also served in the Connecticut House of Representatives from 1831 to 1832, and in 1834. Between 1846 and 1854, Smith oversaw the national campaigns of the Whigs in a role similar to a modern national party chairman.

==Biography==
Smith was born in Roxbury, Connecticut. He was the nephew of Nathaniel Smith and Nathan Smith. Smith completed preparatory studies and graduated from Yale College in 1815, where he was a member of Brothers in Unity. He studied law at Litchfield Law School and was admitted to the bar in 1818, commencing practice in Litchfield, Connecticut. He married Maria Cook on June 2, 1832, and they had three children, Catherine Marie Smith, Jeannie Penniman (Jane) Smith, and George Webster Smith. His wife, Marie, died on April 20, 1849. He married Mary Ann Dickinson Walker on November 7, 1850, by whom he had six children, Truman Houston Smith, Samuel Hubbard Smith, Edmond Dickinson Smith, Robert Shufeldt Smith, Henry Humphry Smith, and Allen Hoyt Smith.

==Career==
Smith was a member of the Connecticut House of Representatives from 1831 to 1832 and again in 1834. He was elected as a Whig to the United States House of Representatives, representing the 5th district, during the Twenty-sixth and Twenty-seventh Congresses, and serving from March 4, 1839, to March 3, 1843, declining renomination in 1842.

Smith was a presidential elector on the Whig ticket in 1844. He was elected back to the House of Representatives representing the 4th District for the Twenty-ninth and Thirtieth Congresses. He served from March 4, 1845, to March 3, 1849.

Between 1846 and 1854, Smith acted as a prototypical national party chairman for the Whig Party. In 1846, he traveled across the country collecting donations from business leaders. The funds were used to print and distribute pamphlets and speeches on the Whig platform and strengthen local Whig organizations in the states and territories. The Whigs did particularly well in the Congressional elections that fall, holding all of their Northern Congressional seats and picking up fourteen House Seats in New York, one in New Jersey, five in Pennsylvania, three in Ohio and one in Georgia, although they failed to gain Iowa&#x27;s two new senatorial seats, which Smith spent considerable resources on. In the 1848 presidential election, Smith became an early backer of the candidacy of Zachary Taylor, believing that the general would have the broadest appeal to voters outside of Connecticut and other Whig strongholds. During the fall campaign, Smith sent contradictory pamphlets to Northern and Southern voters, arguing in the South that Taylor would best defend Southern interests as a slaveholder, and in the North that he would stand against slavery and support the Wilmot Proviso.

After Taylor&#x27;s victory, many Whigs desired Smith&#x27;s inclusion in the cabinet. However, he declined an appointment to be the first United States Secretary of the Interior from President Taylor in 1849, having been elected to the United States Senate. He was sworn in on March 4, 1849. In 1852, he supported Winfield Scott&#x27;s campaign with pamphlets attacking the character and positions of Democrat Franklin Pierce. He overestimated Whig support in the South, leading to surprise when Scott was defeated in a landslide. After the election, Smith began regularly criticizing his fellow Whigs and expressed futility for the party&#x27;s prospects. In correspondence with Thurlow Weed, he refused to help rally the Whigs for a comeback in the 1854 elections, declaring he would &quot;never again lift a finger to put the Whig Party in power&quot;. He resigned from the Senate on May 24, 1854.

Afterwards, he lived in Stamford, Connecticut, with his second wife, Mary Ann Dickinson Smith, while practicing law in New York City. Mary Ann was the adopted daughter of the miniaturist Anson Dickinson. 
Smith&#x27;s New York law office was open from 1854 to 1871. In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln appointed Smith judge of the Court of Arbitration under the treaty of 1862 with Great Britain for the suppression of the slave trade where he served until 1870.

==Death==
Smith retired from business that year and died in Stamford, Connecticut, on May 3, 1884 (age 92 years, 158 days). He is interred at Stamford in Woodland Cemetery.

<text>Francis Gillette (December 14, 1807 – September 30, 1879) was a politician from Connecticut, US. He was the father of actor and playwright William Gillette and politician and editor Edward H. Gillette.

Gillette was born in Old Windsor, Connecticut (today part of the town of Bloomfield), Gillette moved with his parents, Rev. Ashbel and Achsah Francis, to Ashfield, Massachusetts as a child. He graduated from Yale College in 1829 and commenced the study of law, but his health becoming impaired, he instead engaged in agricultural pursuits in Bloomfield.

He was a member of the Connecticut House of Representatives in 1832, 1836 and 1838 and was an unsuccessful candidate for Governor of Connecticut in 1842, losing to Chauncey F. Cleveland, and nine times subsequently.

Gillette served as chairman of the Connecticut Board of Education from 1849 to 1865 and moved to Hartford, Connecticut in 1852 and later developed the neighborhood, &quot;Nook Farm&quot; with his brother-in-law, John Hooker.

He was elected a Free Soiler to the United States Senate in 1854 to fill a vacancy and served until the end of the term in 1855, not being a candidate for reelection. Afterwards, Gillette became a lecturer on agriculture and temperance and was a trustee of the Connecticut State Normal School, also serving as its president for many years.

He aided in the formation of the Republican Party in Connecticut and for several years was a silent partner in the &quot;Evening Press&quot;, the organ of the party.

He engaged in the real estate business in Hartford, Connecticut until his death there on September 30, 1879. He was interred in Riverside Cemetery in Farmington, Connecticut.

The Francis Gillette House in Bloomfield, Connecticut, his home in early years of his antislavery involvement, is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

== Legacy ==
Gillette Ridge Golf Club is named after Francis Gillette.

<doc id="1316295" wikidata="Q3561125" url="?curid=1316295" title="VisualWorks">
<text>VisualWorks (formerly ObjectWorks, afterward Cincom Smalltalk) is a cross-platform implementation of the Smalltalk language. It is implemented as a development system based on &quot;images&quot;, which are dynamic collections of software objects, each contained in a system image.

The lineage of VisualWorks goes back to the first Smalltalk-80 implementation by Xerox PARC. In the late 1980s, a group of Smalltalk-80 developers spun off ParcPlace Systems to further develop Smalltalk-80 as a commercial product. The commercial product was initially named ObjectWorks, and then VisualWorks. On August 31, 1999, the VisualWorks product was sold to Cincom Systems. VisualWorks runs under many operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and several Unix versions.

VisualWorks supports cross-platform development projects, because of its built-in multi-platform features. For example, a graphical user interface (GUI) application needs to be developed only once, and can then be switched to different widget styles. A VisualWorks application can be run on all supported platforms with no modifications. Only the virtual machine is platform-dependent.

== Benefits and drawbacks ==
VisualWorks allows for very fast application development, as individual methods can be compiled even while the program to be developed is running. Compiling a Smalltalk method typically takes significantly less than a second, while doing the same for a C++ project often takes a minute or more, and cannot be done easily without restarting the process. The various code browsers of VisualWorks help the developer to quickly locate a class or method of interest.

The performance and throughput of Smalltalk programs can approach the performance of static languages such as C++, Fortran, Pascal, or Ada using a just-in-time compiler by generating machine code that is specialised for frequently used types, but numeric processing and programs that benefit from precise memory layout may still run slower. The generational garbage collector minimises most collection pauses, but may not be suitable for hard real-time and determinism requirements, as long full collections may occur, which may stop the world for tens to hundreds of milliseconds, proportional to heap size. However, garbage collection is preferable over manual memory management in an object-oriented language, and the programmer can take various actions to control when and for how long garbage collection occurs; so under most circumstances, garbage collection is not a concern.

== Installation ==
All components of the VisualWorks system are installed on Windows 7 or later in a Program Files\Cincom directory named after the version number of the installed system – for instance, codice_1. This directory contains several subdirectories including bin, doc, examples and many others.

== Mouse buttons and menus ==
VisualWorks assumes a three-button mouse with buttons having logical names codice_2, codice_3, and codice_4. Although, a one or two button mouse can be used along with Ctrl, Option, or Command keys. codice_2 selects any interface object. codice_3 brings up a menu of operations for the current view/selection. codice_4 initiates actions (move, close...) on VisualWorks windows.

== File-in format==
File-in format is the original Smalltalk format for representing classes as text files. These can be &quot;filed in&quot; to the VisualWorks IDE to generate any classes not already contained in the Smalltalk image. Every file-in document provides a simple textual representation of a Smalltalk class, or classes, in a text file with a codice_8 suffix. It is still supported in VisualWorks, but has been superseded by a Parcels mechanism. There are examples in file-in format in the examples subdirectory.

== Parcels ==
Parcels are external file representations of packages.

An Examples Browser is provided as a parcel in the examples directory. Several image level switches are available to specify parcel loading on image startup.
The parcel path is the list of directories where VisualWorks looks for parcels. This can be set using the System Settings tool.

Parcels provide the component technology for VisualWorks. Packages and bundles organize the code and model the contents of parcels. Parcels are created by publishing packages/bundles. The term &quot;components&quot;, in the VisualWorks sphere, is used to refer to parcels, packages, and bundles when it is not necessary to be specific.

The parcel code&#x27;s organization on loading is determined by its creation. If it was created by publishing a package, it is loaded into the same package. If created from a bundle, it can be reloaded as the bundle or as one package.

The load sequence for a package is:

# Any prerequisite components are loaded.
# Any defined pre-load action is performed (e.g. undeclared variables initialized).
# Objects in the package are installed.
# Every class in the parcel is sent message post Load: the Package, and any action executed. This is often an application launch.

== Parcel manager ==
The Parcel Manager is used to load and unload all parcels on the parcel path. A Suggestions view lists Categories containing key add-in parcels-by selecting a category, you get a list of recommended parcels. For example, the UI Painter is located in the Essentials category. There is also a Directory-tree view of the parcel path, for finding parcels outside the Suggestions view. A Loaded view lists all parcels already in the image. Only loaded parcels can be browsed.

A supported VisualWorks product parcel is represented by an icon that looks like a parcel. Parcels from other vendors look like a shopping sack. Because of the convoluted history of Smalltalk class development this can be very useful. For instance, a parcel icon indicates that the Arbor hypertext system is now VisualWorks supported.

One can also load and unload parcels programmatically from the application.

== Packages ==
When a parcel is loaded it is organized as a package, or bundle of packages. When looking for code loaded from a parcel, one can locate the bundle or package with the same name in the System Browser. Packages are categories that organize classes into related groups, according to component. Packages can be grouped into bundles. Packages and bundles can be saved (published) as parcels, or saved into a source code repository.

== Loading code libraries ==
The initial visual.im image contains minimal development facilities, using basic class libraries. Additional class libraries are provided by VisualWorks or third-party vendors, usually as parcel files. For most non-Smalltalk development environments, code libraries are imported at compile time, using an include command. In Smalltalk, code libraries are loaded into the running system, and become part of the environment. For example, the UI Painter is loaded as a parcel.

== VisualWorks Launcher ==
The VisualWorks Launcher, usually just called &quot;the Launcher&quot;, is the control centre for the VisualWorks system. It is the launching pad for all the major tools.

== Smalltalk basics ==
Smalltalk is a pure object oriented programming language, which means the only way to get something to happen within Smalltalk is by sending messages to objects. VisualWorks uses the Smalltalk-80 language as standard, but comes with its own set of classes and methods. So even basic classes, like Object, differ from those in other Smalltalk-80 IDEs like Squeak and Dolphin Smalltalk. The illustrative examples here work in VisualWorks Smalltalk, but may not work in other Smalltalks because the classes and/or methods may differ.

== Browsing and editing Smalltalk code ==
In traditional object-oriented programming environments a developer directly edits a plain text source code file containing class and method definitions. In VisualWorks, like all Smalltalks, everything is an executing object, including classes. In browsing Smalltalk classes the developer gleans definitions from executing objects. The main browser/editor in VisualWorks is the System Browser. It allows the developer to browse classes either in the overall class hierarchy or through their packages. It is launched from the VisualWorks Launcher.

List panes in the System Browser allow developers to navigate to class and method definitions. They can then be viewed or edited in a code view, or modified with a new definitions.

== Undeclared variables ==
When a variable is deleted while references to it still exist, or is loaded via a parcel but never declared, its name enters the Undeclared name space. Undeclared variables can cause certain program errors.

== String and files ==
Cincom&#x27;s first tutorial on VisualWorks illustrates how VisualWorks can be used to manipulate server log files. It illustrates how things like strings and files can be easily subsumed into the object structure within VisualWorks. Consider the Smalltalk expression:

 &#x27;ws000101.log&#x27; asFilename edit

One can evaluate this expression as-is in a VisualWorks workspace using one command in the operate menu. This creates:

# An object of class ByteString containing the string (as bytes) and the methods for manipulating it;
# An object of class NTFSFilename (in Windows XP); and
# An editor object.

The latter is a simple notebook-like editor containing the contents of the file. That is, the evaluation created a filename object as a gateway to the file codice_9 and opened an editor onto it. The editor itself is an object, as are all its components (down to and including the characters in its menus). The source code is available for all these objects, and VisualWorks has a plethora of inspectors, browsers, and other tools for anyone to evaluate and inspect the code in static or dynamic mode.

== Tutorials ==
Tutorials are produced for Cincom Smalltalk often, and a Seaside tutorial exists.

<text>La Fayette Sabine Foster (November 22, 1806 – September 19, 1880) was an American politician and jurist from Connecticut. He served in the United States Senate from 1855 to 1867 and was a judge on the Connecticut Supreme Court from 1870 to 1876. He served in the United States Senate from 1855 to 1867 and was a judge on the Connecticut Supreme Court from 1870 to 1876. He was President pro tempore of the United States Senate from 1865 to 1867, and was first in the presidential line of succession for most of his tenure, following the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.

==Biography==
La Fayette Sabine Foster was born in Franklin, Connecticut, on November 22, 1806, to Daniel Foster and his second wife, Welthea Ladd. His father Daniel was a captain in the Continental Army and fought in several battles including the battles of White Plains, Stillwater, and Saratoga. Daniel Foster was a lieutenant in Latimer&#x27;s Regiment of Militia during the Battle of Saratoga. While on the field of battle, he received a warrant of promotion to the post of adjutant.

Foster began his education in the common schools around Franklin. He entered his college preparatory studies under the tuition of the Rev. Abel Flint of Hartford, Connecticut, who he studied under for five months. Foster taught school in Franklin for two subsequent winters. He completed his preparatory studies under the Rev. Cornelius B. Everest of Windham, Connecticut, in 1824, and in February 1825 enrolled at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. He graduated from Brown University in 1828. He was an assistant in the school of Roswell C. Smith in Providence for the winter after his graduation. In the following spring, he began to study law back in Norwich, Connecticut, in the office of Calvin Goddard. He took charge of an academy in Centerville, Maryland, where he was admitted to the Maryland bar in 1830, then returned to Connecticut and was admitted to the bar of New London County in 1831. He opened a law office in Hampton, Connecticut in 1833, but then moved back to Norwich a year later, which became his home for the rest of his life.

On October 2, 1837, Foster married Joanna Boylston Lanman, the daughter of the former U.S. Senator, Connecticut judge, and mayor of Norwich, James Lanman. Foster was the editor of the &quot;Norwich Republican&quot;, a Whig newspaper, and relinquished the position after his legal business greatly increased. He was first elected as one of the representatives of the town of Norwich to the Connecticut House of Representatives in 1839. He was elected to the House again in 1840, 1846, 1847, 1848, 1854, and in 1870.

In 1846, Foster took his first journey to Europe, sailing for Liverpool on the packet ship &quot;Henry Clay&quot;, under captain Ezra Nye, on October 7, 1846. He visited the law courts in London and also visited Paris. He recorded his observations and appreciations in his journal.

He was elected as the Speaker of the Connecticut House of Representatives in 1847 and re-elected in 1848. In 1848, he was considered by the Whig Party in the United States Senate elections of that year and received several votes in the nomination, but was ultimately unsuccessful. Foster was also appointed as the State Director of the Merchants Bank of Norwich. He was the Whig nominee for the Governor of Connecticut in 1850 and 1851, but lost both elections. At this time the governor was elected by the members of the Connecticut General Assembly. In 1851, in the gubernatorial election against his opponent, Thomas H. Seymour, the Whigs had a slight majority in the House. However, there was division amongst the party, and Seymour was elected by one vote in a vote of 122–121. Foster was appointed as the State Director for the Merchants&#x27; Bank, Norwich, for the year after he was nominated by Philo M. Judson and a successful vote. In the same year, in the deliberations for the United States Senate election in Connecticut, after the Whig Party had vainly attempted to elect Roger S. Baldwin to the Senate, they attempted unsuccessfully to unite under Foster. After 22 attempts of the session&#x27;s election for United States Senate, the voting was indefinitely postponed. He was conferred a Legum Doctor degree in 1851 by Brown University. Foster was the mayor of Norwich from 1851 to 1852.

He was again re-elected as the Speaker of the Connecticut House of Representatives in 1854. On May 19, 1854, Foster was elected to a full six-year term in the United States Senate by the votes of the Whigs and Free Soilers. He was an Oppositionist in his first term in the Senate. Two days after the Kansas–Nebraska Act was passed by the House in May 1854, he addressed a public meeting in New Haven, Connecticut, saying that the time for speechmaking was over, and the time for action against slavery had come. He resigned his seat in the Connecticut House of Representatives on June 8, 1854.

Foster&#x27;s first notable speech in the Senate was given on June 25, 1856, in which he eulogized and defended the participants of a public meeting in New Haven to extend aid to departing emigrant Free-Staters, and analyzed the arguments of Stephen A. Douglas, the author of the Kansas–Nebraska Act. In 1858, during the deliberations regarding the admission of the state of Kansas under the proposed Lecompton Constitution, he said the repeal of the Missouri Compromise &quot;was a violation of plighted faith. I believe it was an outrage upon the moral sense of the nation, and it ought not to have been done.&quot; He also said he would never vote for the admission of a slave state formed from territory north of the 36°30′ parallel. Foster&#x27;s wife, Joanna Boylston Lanman, died on April 11, 1859. 

On January 4, 1860, Foster addressed the Senate regarding a resolution to print the annual message to the Senate given by President James Buchanan. Buchanan&#x27;s message included a recommendation that he be authorized &quot;to employ a sufficient military force to enter Mexico, for the purpose of obtaining indemnity for the past and security for the future.&quot; Foster opposed Buchanan&#x27;s recommendation in a speech condemning it as unconstitutional, against international law, and with intent to conquest Mexico, which he considered undesirable for many reasons. He asked the question, &quot;Is the life, liberty, or property of an American citizen, within the slaveholding States of this confederacy today, who entertains opinions obnoxious to those communities on the subject of slavery, any more safe than the liberty or property of our citizens within the Republic of Mexico?&quot; He referred to the advertisements in Southern journals setting prices on the heads of Northern abolitionists, to the outrages committed by the polygamist Mormons in the Utah Territory, and to the bad faith of the U.S. government to the Native Americans. Foster defeated William W. Eaton, a Democrat, in his re-election for United States Senate in 1860. There, he served as chairman of the Committee on Pensions from the 37th to the 39th Congress. On October 2, 1860, Foster married Martha Prince Lyman.

Foster was elected President pro tempore of the Senate on March 6, 1865, and held the title until he resigned the office on March 2, 1867. Six weeks into his tenure, President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated, and Vice President Andrew Johnson succeeded to the presidency. Consequently, Foster became first in the line of presidential succession. From 1865 to 1867, Foster was described as &quot;acting vice president&quot; by many, even though no such position is defined in the Constitution. 

In 1866 Foster was elected as a Companion of the Third Class (i.e. an honorary member) of the Pennsylvania Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United Statesa military society of officers who served in the Union armed forces during the American Civil War and their descendants.

Foster sought reelection to a third term in 1866, but was defeated by Orris S. Ferry; his Senate career ended on March 3, 1867. He became a professor of law at Yale College in 1869 and returned to the Connecticut House of Representatives in 1870. He was once again elected Speaker of the House, but resigned to take a seat on the Connecticut Supreme Court. Foster was a Democratic candidate for the United States House of Representatives in 1874 for Connecticut&#x27;s 3rd congressional district. but was unsuccessful and retired from the court in 1876 when he reached the mandatory retirement age of 70 and was disqualified by statutory limitation. During his retirement he helped tutor young lawyers like Charles W. Comstock. Foster delivered a course of lectures on &quot;Parliamentary Law and the Science of Legislation&quot; at Yale from 1875 to 1880. Foster died in Norwich, on September 19, 1880, and was interred there in Yantic Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Foster willed his personal library to the town of Norwich and his residence for the use of the Norwich Free Academy. He also endowed two academic endeavors, the Lafayette Sabine Foster Prize in Greek at Brown University and the Lafayette S. Foster Professorship of English Common Law at Yale University. Charles Calverley, an American sculptor, created a marble bust of Foster that was presented to the Senate by Foster&#x27;s second wife Martha Prince Lyman Foster in 1885. She gave Brown University a portrait of Foster in 1895 that was made by the portraitist Robert Cutler Hinckley.

<text>Orris Sanford Ferry (August 15, 1823 – November 21, 1875) was a Republican American lawyer and politician from Connecticut who served in the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate. He was also a brigadier general in the Union Army during the American Civil War.

==Early life==
Ferry was born on August 15, 1823, in Bethel, Connecticut. He attended the Hopkins School, and worked at his father&#x27;s shoe factory as a boy. It was here that he realized his love of books. At age 17, Ferry entered Yale, where he served as one of the editors of the &quot;Yale Literary Magazine&quot; and was a member of Skull and Bones. He graduated in 1844. Ferry first settled in Fairfield, Connecticut, where he studied law under Thomas B. Osborne. He then settled in Norwalk, Connecticut, and served in the office of Thomas B. Butler. Ferry married Charlotte Bissell, the daughter of Governor Clark Bissell. He was admitted to the bar in 1846. The following year, he was commissioned a lieutenant colonel in the 12th Regiment of Connecticut Militia. During his time in the militia, Ferry did not fight in any battle or war.

==Early political career==
Ferry served as a probate judge soon after being admitted to the bar. At age 32, he was elected to a term in the Connecticut Senate representing the 12th District. He then served as the State&#x27;s Attorney for Fairfield County from 1856 to 1859. Ferry was a member of the Toleration Party, but in 1856 became a Republican. After joining the party, he campaigned for John C. Frémont. In 1857, Ferry was nominated to serve in the United States House of Representatives, but lost the election. In 1859, he was again nominated, and this time he won.

==House of Representatives==
During his time in Congress, Ferry was known for extemporaneous speaking. He gave numerous speeches against slavery. Ferry was chosen as Connecticut&#x27;s representative to the Committee of Thirty-Three. This Committee was created in the hopes that peace could be settled between the Northern and Southern states. However, Southern states continued to secede from the Union, and the committee was disbanded. Ferry also served on the Committee of Revolutionary Claims. In 1861, he was renominated for his seat, but lost the election.
==American Civil War==
At the outbreak of the American Civil War, and before regiments of Northern troops had arrived to defend Washington, there was a report of a plot to burn the capital. On April 18, 1861, this report mobilized loyal citizens, including Ferry, and state senator A. Homer Byington, also of Norwalk, to form a militia. This militia was led by Cassius Marcellus Clay, and came to be known as the Cassius Clay Guard.

On July 23, 1861, he was put in command of the 5th Connecticut Volunteer Infantry, and given the rank of colonel. The original regiment was the 1st Regiment Colts Revolving Rifles of Connecticut and was supposed to be led by Samuel Colt, but the unit never took the field. Its organization failing, the regiment was reorganized in May 1861. In early March 1862, Ferry led his troops across the Potomac River, and attacked the Confederates at Winchester, Virginia. This action would later lead to what became the First Battle of Winchester. Ferry was well praised for his ability as a leader and as a military strategist. Ferry was promoted to brigadier general on March 17, 1862. He was then put under the command of General James Shields, whose division joined that of Gen. Irvin McDowell. It was under McDowell that Ferry fought at the First Battle of Winchester. Ferry continued to serve under Shields, during the Valley Campaign.

===Battle of Cedar Mountain===

Shortly after the First Battle of Winchester, Ferry and the 5th Connecticut Infantry were put under the command of Maj. Gen. Nathaniel Banks. On August 9, Ferry, under Banks, encountered Stonewall Jackson at the Battle of Cedar Mountain. The Union troops attacked to gain early advantage, but a Confederate counterattack repulsed Banks&#x27;s corps and won the day. Later that day, Union reinforcements under Maj. Gen. John Pope arrived. This led to a two-day stand-off between the two armies. The battle ended in a Confederate victory.

===Services and resignation===
During the war, Ferry served in the VII Corps, X Corps, and XVIII Corps. He was also the head of the District of Lehigh, from August 20, 1863, until May 1864, and served as the head of the District of Philadelphia from December 16, 1864, until July 15, 1865. Ferry was brevetted a major general of volunteers in recognition of his services during the Peninsula Campaign. He resigned from the military on July 15, 1865. His resignation followed the Confederate surrender.

==Senate career==
After the Civil War, Ferry returned to both his political career and law practice. In 1866, he ran against Lafayette S. Foster, the incumbent of the Class III Connecticut Senate seat. Ferry won the election, and took his place in the U.S. Senate on March 4, 1867. He became very active in committees, and favored amnesty for members of the Confederacy. Ferry participated in the Impeachment of President Andrew Johnson, voting to convict. In 1869, Ferry was attacked by a rare disease of his spine. This disease led to a slow deterioration of his spine. This slowed his workings in the Senate, but he continued to play an active role. From 1870 to 1871, he served as the chairman of the Committee to Audit and Control the Contingent Expenses. From 1871 to 1875, he was chairman of the Committee on Patents. Ferry also served on the United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. Ferry was considered a Liberal Republican, but he declined to officially associate with the breakaway party. In 1872, Ferry was reelected for a second term. His main supporters were Democrats and Liberal Republicans.

===Alexander Caldwell scandal===
In 1871, Alexander Caldwell was elected to the Senate from Kansas. From the start, allegations of corruption and pay-offs emerged.
In 1873, Congressman Sidney Clarke, who assisted in Caldwell&#x27;s election, testified that Caldwell&#x27;s campaign had claimed that it would pay $250,000 to secure the election. Kansas Governor Thomas Carney testified that he was paid $15,000 to drop out of the race. An investigation followed; its final report asked the Senate to expel Caldwell for not being &quot;duly and legally elected&quot;. On March 21, 1873, Ferry took to the floor of the Senate and gave a speech asking the Senate to expel Caldwell: &quot;The crime of bribery goes down to the very foundations of the institutions under which we live. We all know it and ... we shall stifle our consciences if we do not vote to expel.&quot; After a survey of the Senate, Caldwell saw his inevitability of being expelled, and resigned, on March 23.

===Later Senate career===
In 1874, Ferry gave a speech against the future Civil Rights Act of 1875. After speaking, Senator Charles Sumner, both a friend of Ferry&#x27;s and the proposer of the bill, stood up and said, &quot;Mr. Ferry, your speech is far the most damaging blow my measure has yet received&quot;. The Civil Rights Act would eventually pass, but was deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, on the basis that Congress did not have the power to regulate the conduct of individuals. His last speech in Congress was considered an uncommonly eloquent dissertation on his former friend, William Alfred Buckingham.

==Death==
After his final speech, Ferry left the capital for a new medical treatment. The treatment was to help heal his decaying spine, but the procedure failed. On November 20, 1875, Ferry&#x27;s friends and doctors helped take him home. He died of his spine disease the next day. His funeral was attended by dignitaries such as Schurz. Ferry was interred at Union Cemetery in Norwalk.

<doc id="1316305" wikidata="Q954977" url="?curid=1316305" title="Official development assistance">
<text>Official development assistance (ODA) is a category used by the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to measure foreign aid. The DAC first adopted the concept in 1969. It is widely used as an indicator of international aid flow. It refers to material resources given by the governments of richer countries to promote the economic development of poorer countries and the welfare of their people. The donor government agency may disburse such resources to the government of the recipient country or through other organizations. Most ODA is in the form of grants, but some is measured as the concessional value in soft (low-interest) loans.

In 2019, the annual amount of state donor aid counted as ODA was US$168 billion, of which US$152 billion came from DAC donors.

==Concept and definition==
In order to co-ordinate and measure international aid effectively, the DAC needs its members to have agreed clear criteria for what is counted as aid. The precise type of aid to be counted was given the name of official development assistance (ODA) (where &quot;official&quot; indicates that the aid is public and from governments).

The full definition of ODA is:
In other words, ODA needs to contain the three elements:
# undertaken by the official sector (official agencies, including state and local governments, or their executive agencies)
# with promotion of economic development and welfare as the main objective; and
# at concessional financial terms (if a loan, having a grant element of at least 25 per cent).

This definition is used to exclude development aid from the two other categories of aid from DAC members:
* Official Aid (OA): Flows which meet conditions of eligibility for inclusion in Official Development Assistance (ODA), other than the fact that the recipients are on Part II of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) List of Aid Recipients.
* Other Official Flows (OOF): Transactions by the official sector with countries on the List of Aid Recipients which do not meet the conditions for eligibility as Official Development Assistance or Official Aid, either because they are not primarily aimed at development, or because they have a grant element of less than 25 percent.

For example:
* If a donor country accords a grant or a concessional loan to Afghanistan it is classified as ODA, because it is on the Part I list.
* If a donor country accords a grant or a concessional loan to Bahrain it is classified as OA, because it is on the Part II list.
* If a donor country gives military assistance to any other country or territory it is classified as OOF, because it is not aimed at development.

=== Developments since inception ===

The concept of ODA was adopted by the OECD DAC in 1969, creating a standard of international aid based on &quot;promoting the economic and social development of developing countries&quot; in a way that was &quot;intended to be concessional in character&quot;. This clarified previous conceptions of aid or development assistance; some grants and loans were now differently categorized as &quot;other official flows (OOF)&quot;. It marked an advance on the effort to define aid that had been made in the DAC&#x27;s 1962 &quot;Directives for reporting aid and resource flows to developing countries&quot;. The establishment of ODA provided a basis for most DAC members to commit to the target, set by the United Nations General Assembly in 1970, that economically advanced countries should devote 0.7% of their national incomes to international aid.

The definition of ODA was made firmer in 1972, specifying that qualifying loans should have a grant element of at least 25%. At the same time, donors (except Italy) adopted a target that at least 84% of their overall ODA should be grant, or count as grant element, rather than commercially repayable loan. This proportion was increased to 86% in 1978.

The legitimacy of &quot;tied aid&quot; (aid dependent on the use of exports from the donor country) had been debated periodically in the DAC. In 1992 the DAC adopted rules for ODA restricting tied aid to lower-income countries and less &quot;commercially viable&quot; projects: restrictions that had been pushed by the U.S. to reduce protectionism in the world trading system. The DAC made a further recommendation on untying in 2001.

In 2012 the DAC began a process of modernizing its statistical system and reforming some of the ways in which ODA is counted. In 2014 the DAC donors agreed that ODA should measure the &quot;grant equivalent&quot; of loans estimated at the time of the loan, rather than loan inflows and outflows as they occurred. It took five years, however, before this was implemented. Between 2016 and 2018 the rules were clarified for counting incidental developmental contributions by foreign military forces when deployed in underdeveloped countries for peace and security purposes. In this period there was also clarification of the criteria for counting some in-donor refugee costs as humanitarian assistance ODA. In 2019, the DAC switched its main reporting of ODA loans to the grant equivalent basis. But this approach creates problems for the accounting of debt relief within ODA, and donors only reached consensus on how to treat this in 2020.

As of 2020, two major items remained as works in progress in the aid modernization agenda: the counting of aid provided through private sector instruments (PSIs), and the construction of a system for measuring broader contributions to global public goods in support of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The latter type of aid is expected to be recorded as Total Official Support for Sustainable Development (TOSSD), and will be a separate category from ODA.

=== 0.7% target ===
The target of spending 0.7% of gross national income on ODA is the best known international aid target. It was formalised on 24 October 1970, when the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution which included the goal that &quot;Each economically advanced country will progressively increase its official development assistance to the developing countries and will exert its best efforts to reach a minimum net amount of 0.7% of its gross national product at market prices by the middle of the Decade [by 1975].&quot; Sweden and the Netherlands were the first countries to meet the target, in 1974, but it has been met by few other countries since.

=== Overall quantity ===
In 2019, the annual amount of state donor aid counted as ODA was US$168 billion, of which US$152 billion came from DAC donors. In the decade 2010–2019, average annual ODA was US$151.5 billion (in 2018 prices).

Historically, the amount of ODA disbursed every year rose approximately four-fold in real terms during the 60 years from 1960. The level was rather stagnant up to 1973 (although inflation meant that it grew in nominal terms). It generally rose from 1973 to 1992, then declined to 1997, then increased again.

=== ODA as a proportion of donor national incomes ===
The proportion of their combined gross national income (GNI) spent by DAC donors on ODA decreased from over 0.5% in 1961 to less than 0.3% in 1973. After that, while donors&#x27; incomes continued to grow, the level of ODA remained around 0.3 - 0.35%, except when it dipped below that level in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The USA - the donor with the largest economy - spent more than 0.5% of its GNI on ODA prior to 1966, but this proportion gradually dropped, reaching a low point of 0.1% in the late 1990s, and standing at 0.15% in 2019.

===Quantities of ODA from leading donors===
Since 1960 the five largest donors of ODA have been: the US, Germany, the UK, Japan and France. See chart on the right.

The top 10 donors of ODA (by absolute amount transferred) in 2019 were: United States, Germany, United Kingdom, France, Japan, Turkey, Netherlands, Sweden, Canada and Italy. See pie chart below. Of these, Turkey is the only non-member of the DAC. Turkey&#x27;s large ODA contribution is associated with the great numbers of Syrian refugees in the country.

=== Donor countries by percentage of gross national income ===

The OECD also lists countries by the amount of ODA they give as a percentage of their gross national income. In 2019 six countries met the longstanding UN target for an ODA/GNI ratio of 0.7%. The ratios of the five most generous donors in this sense, and the five highest-volume donors, are shown in the chart below.
In 2021, the UK reduced its annual aid budget from 0.7% of gross national income to 0.5%.
===Quantities of ODA by recipient country===
In 2019, Syria was the focus of more ODA than any other country, at $10.3 billion. Next were Ethiopia ($4.8 billion), Bangladesh ($4.5 billion), Yemen ($4.4 billion) and Afghanistan ($4.3 billion). China, Indonesia and Thailand were negative recipients: their repayments of past ODA loans were higher than their new receipts. See choropleth map below.

According to estimates that the OECD made in 2014, 28 countries with an aggregate population of around 2 billion people will cease to be ODA eligible by 2030. They include emerging markets such as China, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Malaysia, Thailand and Turkey.

=== Multilateral ODA ===

Most ODA is bilateral, meaning that its state donor is identifiable at the point of delivery to intended beneficiaries. Multilateral ODA, on the other hand, is aid given into a pool administered by some intermediate organisation, so that the delivered aid is no longer attributable to a particular original state donor. In 2019, 28% of all ODA was multilateral. The main organizations for multilateral ODA were the European Union, the IDA (the concessional lending branch of the World Bank), regional development banks and UN agencies.

=== Tied ODA ===
Tied aid is aid given on condition that the money is used to buy things from the donor country or a severely limited group of countries. The legitimacy of tied ODA has long been a point of contention within the DAC. Targets have been set to reduce tying: for example in the 2005 Paris Declaration and the DAC&#x27;s &quot;Recommendation&quot; on untying, first agreed in 1998 and subsequently maintained in revised forms. Official monitoring of performance against these targets is, however, undermined by a discrepancy between what the OECD calls &quot;de jure&quot; and &quot;de facto&quot; rates of tying, i.e. what the donors report and what they do. A major review of the Paris Declaration targets found that, in 2009, 51% (by value) of contracts was spent in the country of the donor, even though donors were reporting only 14% of their aid as tied. The report pointed out that most DAC members failed to use a public bulletin board to advertise contract tenders. The OECD&#x27;s 2020 report on tied aid found this failure was still widespread. Hence the official statistics on tied ODA must be treated with caution.

In 2019 five DAC members declared giving more than half of their ODA in the form of tied aid (Greece 100%, Hungary 78%, Poland 75%, Slovenia 74%, Austria 55%). The largest donor, the US, gave almost 40% of its ODA as tied aid, amounting to US$11.0 billion. Overall, DAC donors in 2019 reported US$22.1 billion – about 20% – of their ODA as tied aid. Historically, the reported proportion of tied aid dropped from about 50% in 1979 to less than 10% in 2003, but rose again, and fluctuated between 15 and 20% between 2007 and 2019 (see chart on the right). This was despite agreement by the donors in the 2005 Paris Declaration to further reduce their tying of aid.

While the last paragraph refers to the proportion of tied aid in overall ODA, the DAC &quot;Recommendation&quot; on untying applies only to Low-Income Countries and a few other countries. In 2018, 87% of all DAC ODA to these countries was reported as being untied. While 19 of the 30 DAC members claimed to have untied more than 90% of their ODA to these countries, the average was dragged down mainly by the United States, which reported only 64% untied aid to these recipients. (The United States, however, was one of the few DAC countries that systematically posted open tenders for its untied aid on a public bulletin board.)

== Problem areas and alternatives ==
=== Problem areas ===
ODA is widely acknowledged to be an untidy and somewhat arbitrary category of aid, its definition having been agreed by the DAC members only with difficulty and awkward compromises. Arbitrariness is seen in the fixing of the qualifying rates of loan concessionality and the applied discount rates. While in the past these rates were set at 25% and 10% respectively, as of 2021 the rates are different for different kinds of recipient but may still be regarded as in some ways arbitrary.

The criterion that ODA must primarily serve &quot;economic development and welfare&quot; leads to dissatisfaction because these two things are often seen as different priorities, and there are differing views about what actions are effective in leading toward development. For example, some stakeholders are particularly interested in progress toward economic convergence of rich and poor countries, and for this purpose the inclusion of humanitarian aid within ODA can seem an interference.

Seen as a measure of donor countries&#x27; contribution to a common effort or to altruistic purposes, ODA is criticized for including expenditures that may mostly benefit the donor country or that are already included in that country&#x27;s international legal obligations. Such types of spending include tied aid, administrative costs, imputed costs of education for foreign students in the donor country, subsistence of refugees inside donor countries, and &quot;development awareness&quot; programmes in donor countries.

The counting of loans in ODA is problematic. Until 2018, loan disbursements were counted in full as aid in the year they were given, and repayments were negative aid in the year they were returned. Some DAC members considered this method &quot;did not reflect actual efforts by donor countries&quot; (perhaps particularly when looking at an individual year). So in 2014 the DAC decided to record the &quot;grant equivalent&quot; of loans as ODA in the year the loan was agreed. This involves complex estimation: the exact methodology took years to finalize and was only first implemented in 2019. Even then, there was no agreement in the DAC on how to treat debt relief. When this agreement was reached, in 2020, it was criticized by commentators as producing a situation in which risky loans, subsequently defaulted, could count for as much ODA as simply giving a grant for the whole amount, yet cost less to the donor if some of the repayments have been made.

=== Alternatives ===
Recognizing that ODA does not capture all the expenditures that promote development, the International TOSSD Task Force started establishing a wider statistical framework called TOSSD (Total Official Support for Sustainable Development) that would count spending on &quot;international public goods&quot;. The TOSSD data for 2020 shows more than US$355 billion disbursed to support for sustainable development, from almost 100 provider countries and institutions. In March 2022, TOSSD was adopted as a data source for indicator 17.3.1 of the SDGs global indicator framework to measure development support.

The Commitment to Development Index is an alternative measure that ranks the largest donors on a broad range of their &quot;development friendly&quot; policies, including: the quality of aid (for instance by giving countries fewer points for tied aid), and considering country policies on issues such as trade, migration and international security.

== Society and culture ==

=== Global goals ===
Several of the Sustainable Development Goals (to be achieved by 2030 at a global level) include ODA in their targets and indicators. This applies to SDG 17 which is to &quot;Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development&quot;. Its second target is worded as &quot;Developed countries to implement fully their official development assistance commitments, including the commitment by many developed countries to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income for official development assistance (ODA/GNI) to developing countries and 0.15 to 0.20 per cent of ODA/GNI to least developed countries; ODA providers are encouraged to consider setting a target to provide at least 0.20 per cent of ODA/GNI to least developed countries.&quot;

SDG 10 (Reduce inequality within and among countries) also includes a target on ODA: &quot;Encourage official development assistance and financial flows, including foreign direct investment, to States where the need is greatest, in particular least developed countries, African countries, small island developing States and landlocked developing countries, in accordance with their national plans and programmes.&quot;

<text>Entrance is a display manager for the X Window System. It is written using the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries, a graphical toolkit written in C.

Entrance is themeable, and is capable of launching different desktop environments from a list, as well as remembering users for auto-login. It also allows animation and visual effects. Customization is achieved by editing a database located in /etc/entrance/entrance.conf by default.

Development of Entrance was started around 2003 by Ibukun Olumuyiwa in order to create a successor to a program called Elogin. The project went on hiatus in 2005. On 9 August 2012, development was restarted by Michael Bouchaud, who renamed his previous display manager (&quot;Elsa&quot;) to Entrance. That project also went on hiatus in 2015-2016. In 2017 development was restarted by William L. Thomson Jr. by forking Entrance.

The name of Entrance may be a play on words, as the correct pronunciation hints at putting the user in a trance, though it is also the &quot;entrance&quot; to the graphical desktop.

<text>Prince Krzysztof Radziwiłł, epithet &quot;Piorun&quot; (&quot;Lightning&quot;) (, 1547–1603) was a Reichsfürst of the Holy Roman Empire and a member of the nobility of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

He was cup-bearer of Lithuania from 1569; Field Hetman of Lithuania from 1572; Castellan of Trakai, Deputy Chancellor of Lithuania from 1579; Voivode of Vilnius Voivodeship from 1584; Lithuanian Grand Hetman from 1589; and &quot;Starost&quot;.

==Life==
Radziwiłł was one of the most talented commanders in the service of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth during the wars against Muscovy and Sweden, and won the Battle of Kokenhausen. He received the epithet &quot;Piorun&quot; (translated as &quot;Lightning&quot; or &quot;Thunderbolt&quot;) for his deadly and very successful cavalry raids against Ivan the Terrible&#x27;s forces in Russian Tsardom territory during the Livonian War, forcing it to capitulate.

His achievements, combined with his powerful Radziwiłł family backing, helped him rise to his various voivode and &quot;starost&quot; offices and further increased his family&#x27;s wealth.

Like his father, brother, and nephew, he was an ardent Calvinist and adherent of the Polish Reformed Church, and defended it against the rise of the Counter-Reformation.

<text>Alessandro D&#x27;Ancona (20 February 18359 November 1914) was an Italian critic and writer.

==Life==
He was born at Pisa, of a wealthy Jewish family, and educated in Florence; at the age of eighteen he published his essay on the life and work of the philosopher Tommaso Campanella.

In 1855 Ancona went to Turin, nominally to study law, but in reality to act as intermediary between the Tuscan Liberals and Cavour; he was an intimate friend of Luigi Carlo Farini and represented Tuscany in the Società Nazionale. On the fall of the Austrian dynasty in Tuscany (27 April 1859), he returned to Florence, where he edited the newly founded newspaper &quot;La Nazione&quot;. In 1861 he was appointed professor of Italian literature at the University of Pisa.

Among his works the following may be mentioned: &quot;Opera di Tommaso Campanella&quot;, 2 vols. (Turin, 1854); &quot;Sacre Rappresentazioni dei secoli XIV., XV., e XVI.&quot; (3 vols., Florence, 1872); &quot;Origini del Teatro in Italia&quot; (2 vols., Florence, 1877); &quot;La Poesia popolare italiana&quot; (Livorno, 1878), besides several volumes of literary essays, editions of the works of Dante and other early Italian writers, etc.

<doc id="1316349" wikidata="Q1169276" url="?curid=1316349" title="New Slang">
<text>&quot;New Slang&quot; is a song by American rock band The Shins, released in February 2001 as the lead single from the group&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Oh, Inverted World&quot; (2001). Written by guitarist and vocalist James Mercer, it concerns his hometown of Albuquerque, New Mexico and his experiences there in his late 20s. The lyrics are fueled with &quot;angst and confusion,&quot; as Mercer was finding himself constantly depressed and disconnected from his friends and scene. The song attracted attention from Sub Pop Records, who issued the song as a single in February 2001. The buzz created by the song led to positive press for the group&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Oh, Inverted World&quot;.

The song began to be licensed in a variety of media beginning in 2002, including various television programs and a McDonald&#x27;s advert that aired during the 2002 Winter Olympics. Although the song never charted on any international charts, it became a sensation following its appearance in the film &quot;Garden State&quot; (2004), where Sam, a character played by Natalie Portman, referred to it as a song that &quot;will change your life.&quot; The band saw increased record sales and visibility as a result. Critics were very positive in their assessments of &quot;New Slang&quot;, with many calling it one of the best songs from &quot;Oh, Inverted World&quot;.

The song&#x27;s music video was directed by Lance Bangs, and features shots filmed in Albuquerque and Portland, Oregon.

==Background==
The Shins were not truly a band when James Mercer composed the song, and the idea of making music his career seemed uncertain. The song&#x27;s creation was partially a reaction to the music scene in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the band&#x27;s hometown, which Mercer described as &quot;macho, really heavy, and aggressive.&quot; He characterized it as a punk rock-esque move akin to giving the finger to the entire town. The song was born out of frustration regarding his personal life and future. &quot;It&#x27;s definitely a moment in my life, that sort of angst and confusion about what my future was going to be,&quot; he remarked. He described it as a &quot;Saturn return&quot; period of his life, in which he felt he could not relate to anyone in his hometown and his life there had become depressing. He had become a &quot;hermit&quot; working on the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Oh, Inverted World&quot;, and had lost interest in partying with friends. The line &quot;Gold teeth and a curse for this town&quot; refers to his songwriting talent and his feelings on Albuquerque.

Friends of the band, including Zeke Howard from Love As Laughter and Isaac Brock from Modest Mouse sent record labels cassette demos of the band&#x27;s songs, including &quot;New Slang&quot;. Mercer sent a demo to Sub Pop Records in Seattle, Washington, and label co-founder Jonathan Poneman caught a concert in San Francisco while the band was on tour with Modest Mouse. He offered the band a one-off single deal, and the label included it in their Single-of-the-Month series, issuing a 7&quot; single to fan club members in February 2001. Positive press for &quot;New Slang&quot; made the group&#x27;s debut, &quot;Oh, Inverted World&quot;, one of the most anticipated indie rock albums of 2001, and Sub Pop signed the band in full.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;New Slang&quot; received positive critical reception. Stewart Mason of the &quot;Weekly Alibi&quot; in the band&#x27;s hometown of Albuquerque called it &quot;the most immediately appealing song on the album,&quot; praising it as &quot;simply brilliant, [...] mostly acoustic ballad with the absolute finest melody the band has yet concocted and Mercer&#x27;s typically oblique but evocative lyrics.&quot;

AllMusic called the song a &quot;mid-tempo, strummy folk tune with a real catch-on falsetto melody,&quot; giving its 7&quot; single a four-star review, summarizing that the release &quot;could be a lost single from a brilliant, obscure &#x27;60s psych-folk band while still sounding far ahead of its time.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it the &quot;most affecting&quot; song from &quot;Oh, Inverted World&quot;, describing it as &quot;a shuffling folk ballad with a spaghetti-western feel and a somber melody that could have come off an Elliott Smith album.&quot; &quot;Pitchfork&quot; panned the song, deeming it an imitation of Simon &amp; Garfunkel. &quot;The New York Times&quot; also covered the song, noting that &quot;It has an odd, slightly serpentine vocal melody (it sounds a bit like an adapted madrigal), and the lyrics are absurd and somehow touching.&quot;

&quot;The A.V. Club&quot; called &quot;New Slang&quot; one of the year&#x27;s &quot;loveliest ballads.&quot; Will Hermes, in a piece on NPR&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, called the song a &quot;masterpiece,&quot; as well as &quot;ridiculously melodic and structurally flawless.&quot; &quot;Pitchfork&quot; later included the song at number 62 on its list of &quot;The Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s,&quot; calling it &quot;An agoraphobic bedroom-pop gem that shuffled its way onto a stage larger than anyone imagined possible. &quot;New Slang&quot; paved the way for Norah, Nick, Juno, and the many lovely, odd, and grating mainstream/indie pairings to come.&quot;

The song&#x27;s music video was filmed in various locations in Albuquerque and Portland. Among the areas filmed included the Rio Grande, junkyards, and near Mercer&#x27;s home. The clip was directed by Lance Bangs, an associate of Spike Jonze. It features the band re-enacting the cover art of other bands&#x27; albums, including &quot;Zen Arcade&quot; and &quot;New Day Rising&quot; by Hüsker Dü, &quot;Let It Be&quot; by The Replacements, &quot;Moon Pix&quot; by Cat Power, &quot;Double Nickels on the Dime&quot; by The Minutemen, Squirrel Bait&#x27;s first EP, Sonic Youth&#x27;s &quot;Sister&quot; and Slint&#x27;s &quot;Spiderland&quot;. Shooting in just two cities created logistical problems for album covers originally photographed in cities such as Los Angeles, Minneapolis, and Louisville. For the homage to &quot;Double Nickels on the Dime&quot;, the band had to track down the exact model of the car featured on the album cover (a Volkswagen Beetle), and Albuquerque happened to have a San Pedro Street, which is featured on a freeway sign on the original cover.

The video was in rotation on M2, Much Music, and on the program &quot;120 Minutes&quot;. The clip was also available for download from Sub Pop&#x27;s website in 2002.

==Commercial performance and usage==
The song proved to be a &quot;stealth hit,&quot; helping &quot;Oh, Inverted World&quot; move over 100,000 copies within two years, considered remarkable for an independent label; Sub Pop had hoped the record would sell 10,000 copies. The song was also used on an episode of &quot;Scrubs&quot;, &quot;The O.C.&quot;, &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, the MTV reality series &quot;&quot; and video game &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2&quot;. Mercer was positive in licensing the song to a variety of media, confirming to &quot;The New York Times&quot; that he received more money from touring and licensing than record sales.

The song was featured in a McDonald&#x27;s advert that aired during the 2002 Winter Olympics. Mercer elaborated on the song&#x27;s inclusion in the ad in an interview: &quot;That whole thing was just an ad agency that McDonald’s hired to do a “hip commercial,” or whatever. So the kid who offered the whole thing up to us was a Shins fan.&quot; Online message boards (many on &quot;Pitchfork&quot;) and fans of the Shins criticized the move as excessively commercialist. The band&#x27;s hometown alt weekly ran an editorial titled &quot;McShins, New Corporate Suck-ass&quot; in reaction. The ad&#x27;s aesthetics were criticized for straying from the company&#x27;s typical upbeat themes, and fans of the band found its inclusion subversive, considering a set of the song&#x27;s lyrics, which at times refer to &quot;the dirt in your fries.&quot; The royalties Mercer earned from the commercial allowed him to purchase a home. In addition, the band used the money to finance a tour and relocate to Portland, Oregon, where they built a basement studio and recorded their second album, &quot;Chutes Too Narrow&quot; (2003). Mercer nevertheless &quot;recognized the detrimental capacity of linking music with advertising,&quot; remarking, &quot;Imagine us playing &quot;New Slang,&quot; and everyone in the audience going, &#x27;That&#x27;s the song from the McDonald&#x27;s commercial — I&#x27;m loving it.&#x27;&quot;

&quot;New Slang&quot; achieved a new level of cultural significance when it was prominently featured in the film &quot;Garden State&quot; (2004). In a scene from the film, Sam (portrayed by Natalie Portman) tells Andrew Largeman (played by Zach Braff) that the song &quot;will change your life.&quot; The song had previously been featured on the first soundtrack to Braff&#x27;s television show &quot;Scrubs&quot;. The film &quot;&quot;changed everything&quot; for the group, leading their first two albums to sell more than twice what they had prior to the film&#x27;s debut. &quot;Almost overnight, the Shins became indie-rock icons,&quot; wrote Robert Levine of &quot;Spin&quot;. The band extended their tour in support of the song and its popularity. &quot;We saw a change in our audience. By the time we were done touring for &quot;Chutes Too Narrow&quot;, there was this new interest,&quot; said Mercer. &quot;We toured again almost as the soundtrack to that movie, and colleges were all of a sudden interested in us playing on their campuses. We wanted to consummate the new relationship by touring and having a relationship with them. I mean, it just kept growing!&quot; This additional exposure helped &quot;Oh, Inverted World&quot; move 500,000 units in the United States.

The band performed the song on their debut appearance at &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 2007. Mercer was disappointed the show&#x27;s producers requested he perform a song at that point six years old, but obliged after hearing stories of artists that argued their setlist and were not invited back.

<doc id="1316353" wikidata="Q4118461" url="?curid=1316353" title="Myloi, Argolis">
<text>Myloi (), is a village in the southwestern part of Argolis, Greece. Myloi was the seat of the former municipality of Lerna. It is 4 km southwest of Nea Kios, 9 km south of Argos and 8 km west of Nafplio. The Greek National Road 7 passes through the village. It had a train station on the Corinth–Kalamata railway, but passenger service on this line was halted in 2010.

Situated on the northwestern coast of the Argolic Gulf, Myloi is a popular fishing village and local tourist destination for its beaches and restaurants, hotels, market, and bakery open for most of the year. 

== Sites ==

=== Lerna ===
Lerna is a Bronze Age settlement site located in Myloi that was occupied from the Neolithic to the Mycenean period (6th - 1st century BC). Excavated by the American School of Classical Studies in Athens, several buildings were recovered with the most famous being the House of the Tiles, a large monumental building names after the remains of baked roofing tiles. 

The site is managed by the Ephorate of Antiquities of Argolida and can be visited with the price of admission.
=== Castle Kiveri ===
Built during the 14th century AD, the remains of the are located on Pontinos Hill, overlooking the Argolic Gulf. While there are mentions of a Temple of Athena Saitis by Pausanias in this location, the structures that remain date to the Frankish period and are attributed to Gautier de Brienne. The castle and surrounding structures are said to have been destroyed during the first Ottoman–Venetian War (1463–1479).

Today, a few standing structures remaining and a modern church can be found on the top of the hill.

<text>The Autumn of the Middle Ages, The Waning of the Middle Ages, or Autumntide of the Middle Ages (published in 1919 as &quot;Herfsttij der Middeleeuwen&quot; and translated into English in 1924, German in 1924, and French in 1932), is the best-known work by the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga.

In the book, Huizinga presents the idea that the exaggerated formality and romanticism of late medieval court society was a defense mechanism against the constantly increasing violence and brutality of general society. He saw the period as one of pessimism, cultural exhaustion, and nostalgia, rather than of rebirth and optimism.

His main conclusion is that the combination of required modernization of statehood governance, stuck in traditionalism, in combination with the exhausting inclusion of an ever-growing corpus of Catholic rites and popular beliefs in daily life, led to the implosion of late medieval society. This provided light to the rise of (religious) individualism, humanism and scientific progress: the renaissance.

The book was nominated for the 1939 Nobel Prize for Literature, but lost to the Finnish writer Frans Eemil Sillanpää.

Huizinga&#x27;s work later came under some criticism, especially for relying too heavily on evidence from the rather exceptional case of the Burgundian court. Other criticisms include the writing of the book being &quot;old-fashioned&quot; and &quot;too literary&quot;.

A new English translation of the book was published in 1996 because of perceived deficiencies in the original translation. The new translation, by Rodney Payton and Ulrich Mammitzsch, was based on the second edition of the Dutch publication in 1921 and compared with the German translation published in 1924.
To mark the centenary of &quot;Herfsttij&quot;, a new translation by Diane Webb appeared in 2020, published by Leiden University Press: &quot;Autumntide of the Middle Ages&quot;. According to Benjamin Kaplan, this translation &quot;captures Huizinga&#x27;s original voice better than either of the two previous English editions&quot;. This new English edition also includes for the first time 300 full-colour illustrations of all the works of art Huizinga mentions in his text.

In the 1970s, Radio Netherlands produced an audio series about the book, entitled &quot;Autumn of the Middle Ages: A Six-part History in Words and Music from the Low Countries&quot;.

It features English renderings of the Middle French poems and other contemporary sources, and its colour illustrations include over three hundred paintings and prints, illuminated manuscripts, and miniatures pertinent to Huizinga’s discourse. Also includes a complete bibliography of Huizinga’s sources and an epilogue that addresses the meaning and enduring importance of this classic work.

<text>Dino Meneghin (, ; born 18 January 1950) is an Italian former professional basketball player. He is widely considered to be the best Italian player ever, as well as one of Europe&#x27;s all-time greats. A 2.06 m (6 ft 9 in) tall center, Meneghin was born in Alano di Piave, Veneto (northeast Italy). On 20 November 1966, when he was 16 years old, he played in his first game in the Italian League, with Ignis Varese. He played the last game of his career at the age of 45.

He holds the record for the most EuroLeague championships won by a player, with seven, when counting all formats of the competition&#x27;s history, dating back to the inaugural 1958 season. In 2003, Meneghin became a Basketball Hall of Fame player. In 2006, he became a member of the Italian Basketball Hall of Fame. In 2010, he became a FIBA Hall of Fame player.

==Professional career==
In total, Meneghin played in 836 games and scored 8,560 points in the Italian League championship. Meneghin became the second player from a European league to be drafted by an NBA team, when the Atlanta Hawks manager Marty Blake selected him with a late-round pick in the 1970 NBA draft. He never played in the US, however.

In 1980 and 1983, he was elected European Player of the Year: Mr. Europa, and he also won the Euroscar European Player of the Year award in 1983. In 1991, he was named the greatest FIBA European Champions&#x27; Cup (EuroLeague) basketball player of all time, by the Italian basketball magazine Giganti del Basket.

One of the greatest records of his career is his number of Finals appearances in the FIBA European Champions Cup (EuroLeague). He played in 10 consecutive finals with Pallacanestro Varese, winning 5; and later in 2 more consecutive finals with Olimpia Milano, winning both. Finally, before his playing career ended, Meneghin played in the Italian League against his son, Andrea, who was also a great international player.

On 28 October 2019, 25 years after he last played professionally, Olimpia Milano retired the number 11 in honor of Meneghin. The number 11 matched the number of seasons that he had played with the Italian club.

==National team career==
With the senior Italian national basketball team, Meneghin played in 271 games, and totaled 2,847 points scored. With Italy, he won the bronze medal at both the 1971 EuroBasket and the 1975 EuroBasket. He also won the silver medal at the 1980 Summer Olympics, and the gold medal at the 1983 EuroBasket.

==Post-playing career==
On 5 September 2003 Meneghin became the second Italian player to enter into the Basketball Hall of Fame, after Cesare Rubini, who served Olimpia Milano, both as player and coach between the 1940s and the 1970s. After his playing career ended, Meneghin has since worked for the Italian Basketball Federation and for Olimpia Milano.

==Personal life==
Dino Meneghin is the father of Andrea Meneghin, who also played professional basketball. Andrea played against his father, during the latter&#x27;s last season as a pro.

<doc id="1316411" wikidata="Q752486" url="?curid=1316411" title="Minnesota Fighting Saints">
<text>The Minnesota Fighting Saints was the name of two professional ice hockey teams based in Saint Paul, Minnesota, that played in the World Hockey Association. The first team was one of the WHA&#x27;s original twelve franchises, playing from 1972 to 1976. The second team was relocated from Cleveland, Ohio, and played for part of the 1976–77 season. Neither edition of the franchise completed its final season of play.

==Original team==
Founded in November 1971, the first Fighting Saints team played four seasons beginning in 1972–73 under the ownership of nine local businessmen. St. Paul attorney Wayne Belisle purchased the team late in the 1973–74 season. Belisle was the front man for a group of owners that included Jock Irvine. The Saints&#x27; first game, a 4–3 loss to the Winnipeg Jets, was played October 13, 1972, at the St. Paul Auditorium. The team moved to the new St. Paul Civic Center, which opened in January 1973. The first game in the new arena was on January 1, 1973, a 4–4 overtime tie with the Houston Aeros.

The team colors were royal blue, white and new gold. The name was taken from the St. Paul Saints of the Central Hockey League, who had used the nickname &quot;Fighting Saints&quot; in promotional material.

The team originally had three sets of jerseys—white, blue and gold—all bearing the Saints &quot;S&quot; logo on the front, with the word &quot;Saints&quot; across the middle of the &quot;S.&quot; (The gold jerseys were rarely used, and were worn only in the first season.) When the Saints left the St. Paul Auditorium for the new Civic Center on January 1, 1973, the familiar &quot;little saint&quot; logo replaced the &quot;S&quot; on the white and blue jerseys. While a halo was part of the team&#x27;s &quot;little saint&quot; logo in promotions and advertising, it was never used on the jersey.

At the outset, the Saints had a policy of favoring local players, with the 1972–73 roster featuring no fewer than 11 athletes who were either born in Minnesota or were at least American citizens (as in the case of former Team USA players Keith Christiansen, George Konik and Carl Wetzel). This was almost unheard of in the early 1970s, when few NHL or WHA teams had even a single American player. In fact, one of the players the Saints selected in the inaugural WHA draft in 1972 was Wendell Anderson, a former star defenseman at the University of Minnesota and a member of the silver medal-winning Team USA squad at the 1956 Winter Olympics. Anderson said he was flattered, but he chose not to join the Saints and instead stuck to his day job—as Governor of Minnesota.

The Saints never missed the playoffs nor had a losing record. Perhaps even more impressively, given that they were in direct competition with the Minnesota North Stars of the established National Hockey League, the Fighting Saints always drew more fans than the WHA average. On a few occasions, the Fighting Saints drew more fans than their local NHL rivals. They also boasted a handful of expensive marquee players such as Mike Walton, Dave Keon and John McKenzie. Eventually, it was the team&#x27;s high payroll that largely contributed to its demise. Without a marketable star in Gordie Howe or Bobby Hull&#x27;s mold, the Saints were unable to secure a lucrative television deal. As a result, even above-WHA average gate receipts were not enough to overcome the team&#x27;s financial woes.

In 1975–76, the Saints had a record of 30–25–4 and were second in the West behind the Houston Aeros when they ceased operations because of financial struggles. Saints officials announced on December 31, 1975, that the team was broke, and the players would continue to play without pay. (Belisle&#x27;s group withdrew its backing at the start of the season.) A permanent buyer was never found, and the players received one paycheck in the final two months.

The Fighting Saints&#x27; last game was played February 25, 1976, at the Civic Center, a 2–1 overtime loss to the San Diego Mariners in front of an announced crowd of 6,011. The decision to fold the franchise occurred February 28, 1976, in the lobby of the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport, moments before the team was scheduled to board a flight to Cincinnati for a game that night.

==Second team==

After the NHL&#x27;s California Golden Seals moved to Cleveland to become the Cleveland Barons, the WHA&#x27;s Cleveland Crusaders moved to St. Paul for the 1976–77 season. Like their predecessors, this second version of the Saints (called the &quot;New Fighting Saints&quot; in advertising and promotional material) had a winning record through their first 42 games (19–18–5), but owner Nick Mileti was unable to sell the team to local buyers. (Also, the new Saints weren&#x27;t drawing as well as the old ones: just 6,211 a night, versus the league average of 7,675.)

The &quot;New&quot; Fighting Saints played their final game on January 14, 1977, a 9–5 home win over the Indianapolis Racers. The franchise officially folded on January 20, 1977. The team&#x27;s logo and uniforms were identical to the first team&#x27;s, but with scarlet replacing royal blue.

==Players==

Ted Hampson was the Saints&#x27; captain in their first four seasons. In the final season, Ron Ward was the team captain, replaced on December 28, 1976, by John Arbour.

Among the Saints&#x27; notable players were Wayne Connelly (the team&#x27;s career scoring leader with 283 points in 291 games), Mike Walton, Mike Antonovich (the team&#x27;s career games leader with 309), Hockey Hall of Famer Dave Keon, John McKenzie and Rick Smith, and goalies Mike Curran and John Garrett. Also on the Minnesota roster were Jeff Carlson, Steve Carlson, and David Hanson, who played the infamous Hanson Brothers in the 1977 cult movie &quot;Slap Shot&quot;. (The trio weren&#x27;t the Saints&#x27; only connection to the film: in the 1974 WHA semifinals against Houston, controversial forward Bill &quot;Goldie&quot; Goldthorpe played three games for the Fighting Saints, compiling no points and 25 penalty minutes; &quot;Slap Shot&quot; featured a wild player named Ogie Oglethorpe, based on Goldthorpe.) Veteran NHL coach Bruce Boudreau made his professional debut with the Saints, playing 30 games in the 1975–76 season and scoring three goals and six assists.

The last active Fighting Saints player in major professional hockey was Jack Carlson, who retired after the 1986–87 NHL season with the North Stars (Carlson was also invited to be in &quot;Slap Shot&quot;, but had to decline as his team was in the playoffs, so his role was recast). The last Saint regularly playing in pro hockey was Bruce Boudreau, who played in the American Hockey League until 1992. (In 1996, Mike Antonovich came out of retirement as a player-coach, playing a few games in the United Hockey League.)

==Executives and staff==
Glen Sonmor was the Saints general manager throughout their history. Sonmor coached the Saints for the first part of their inaugural season. When Sonmor gave up his coaching duties, assistant coach Harry Neale took over as head coach (his first game was February 17, 1973). Sonmor coached the Saints again during their final season, 1976–77. Neale became head coach of the New England Whalers after the original Saints folded in 1976, and later coached the Vancouver Canucks in the National Hockey League.

The Saints&#x27; public address announcers included Al Tighe (1973–74) and Rod Trongard (1974–1977). Team organists included Rob Meads (1973–1976) and Ronnie Newman (1976–77). Jim Bowers often sang the National Anthem. George Nagobads was the team&#x27;s physician from 1973 to 1976.

==Media coverage==
Games of the original Fighting Saints were heard on WLOL Radio (1330 AM) from 1972 to 1976, with Frank Buetel as play-by-play announcer. Buetel was the original TV voice of the NHL&#x27;s Minnesota North Stars from 1967 to 1970 on WTCN-TV (now KARE-TV). Buetel&#x27;s color commentators included Roger Buxton (1972–73) and Bob Halvorson, the Saints&#x27; first-season public relations director (1972–73), and Bill Allard (1973–1976). Al Hirt&#x27;s version of &quot;When the Saints Go Marching In&quot; was used as the theme song for WLOL&#x27;s Fighting Saints broadcasts. No local radio station carried games of the New Fighting Saints (1976–77).

Fighting Saints games were televised sporadically on WTCN from 1973 to 1975. The first WTCN game was a home contest versus Cleveland on December 23, 1973, with Buetel and Allard simulcasting. Buxton called subsequent games on WTCN.

On January 7, 1973, CBS aired its first WHA game between the Fighting Saints and Winnipeg Jets live from the new St. Paul Civic Center with Ron Oakes, Gerry Cheevers and Dick Stockton announcing. In the 1973–74 season, one Saints home game was carried on KTCA-TV (PBS). No local TV station aired games of the New Fighting Saints.

The main sponsors of the Fighting Saints on radio and TV were Schmidt Beer and Midwest Federal.

The main sportswriters who covered the Fighting Saints were Charley Hallman of the &quot;St. Paul Pioneer Press-Dispatch&quot; and John Gilbert of the &quot;Minneapolis Tribune&quot;.

<doc id="1316424" wikidata="Q5095825" url="?curid=1316424" title="Chicago Union Stock Yards fire (1910)">
<text>The Chicago Union Stock Yards fire occurred from December 22 to December 23, 1910, in Chicago, resulting in the deaths of twenty-one Chicago Fire Department firemen.

Until the September 11 attacks, the fire was the deadliest building collapse in American history, although the Texas City Disaster of 1947 killed more firefighters overall. It remains the worst such incident in Chicago history.

==History==

The fire, which broke out at Warehouse 7 of the Nelson Morris Company at the Chicago Union Stock Yards on the 4300 block of South Loomis Street, was first reported on December 22 at 4:09 am. Half an hour later it was listed as a 4-11 (four alarm) blaze and within a few hours, more than thirty fire engines were battling the blaze. By the time the blaze was extinguished at 6:37 am on December 23, 50 engine companies and seven hook and ladder companies had been called to the scene. Fire hydrants near the location had been shut off prior to the outbreak of the fire to prevent freezing.

Twenty-one firemen, including Fire Chief James J. Horan, and three civilians were killed when one of the blazing buildings collapsed with them inside. Following Horan&#x27;s death, First Assistant Chief Charles Seyferlich took command of the operations, diverting men from fighting the fire to search and retrieve the dead firefighters.

==Memorials==

In 2004, a memorial to all Chicago firefighters who have perished in the line of duty was erected near the location of the 1910 Stock Yards fire. The memorial was created at the urging of Chicago firefighters, who helped to raise about 75% of the $170,000 cost of the statue. The memorial includes the names of all Chicago firefighters who have died in the line of duty since 1865.

A historical marker titled &quot;The Fallen 21,&quot; affixed to the old Union Stock Yard Gate a short distance from the memorial, offers a description of the fire.

Early film pioneer Freeman Harrison Owens filmed a newsreel of the fire and the firefighting effort.

<text>Prince Krzysztof Radziwiłł () (22 March 1585, Biržai – 19 November 1640) was a Polish–Lithuanian noble (szlachcic), and a notable magnate, politician and military commander of his epoch. Sometimes referred to as &quot;Krzysztof Radziwiłł II&quot;, to distinguish him from his father, Krzysztof Mikołaj &#x27;Piorun&#x27; Radziwłł.

==Biography==
Owner of Biržai, he was Field Hetman of Lithuania from 1615, Castellan of Vilnius from 1633, Voivode of Vilnius from 1633. Grand Lithuanian Hetman from 1635. starost of Mogilev, Bystrzyca, Žiežmariai and Seje. In 1632 he served as Marshal of the Sejm.

He successfully fought in Livonia against Sweden from 1600s to 1617. He took part in the campaign against the Swedes in the Baltic region in 1621–1622 (Polish-Swedish War), where he agreed to a controversial truce (as he had no permission to negotiate it from the king or the Sejm). Important commander of Lithuanian forces during the Smolensk War, where he was instrumental in obtaining the capitulation of the Russian army in the relief of Smolensk. Afterwards, in 1635, he retired from his military career, concentrating on administering his estates. A Calvinist, he was a great protector of Protestants in Lithuania.

He was an opponent of Catholic king Sigismund III Vasa, but a supporter of his more tolerant son, Władysław IV. An advocate of Władysław&#x27;s marriage to a Protestant princess, he distanced himself from the king after Władysław declined this marriage proposal. He opposed an alliance between the Commonwealth and the Habsburgs. On his lands in Kėdainiai he founded a major Calvinist cultural and religious centre, which flourished till the 19th century as a center of the Lithuanian Reformed Church. His large horse stables were famous throughout Europe.

==Collector==
Radziwiłł collected various curiosities at the Lubcha Castle: minerals, mollusc shells, corals, hunting trophies, whale bones, elephant tusk, nut shells, and similar items. It is believed that at least three items (moose horn collection, a chair made of horns, and a jaw bone of bowhead whale) of the collection are preserved at the Zoological Museum of Vilnius University.

<doc id="1316448" wikidata="Q2826643" url="?curid=1316448" title="French Development Agency">
<text>The French Development Agency (, AFD), known from 1992 to 1998 as the Caisse Française de Développement (CFD, ), is a public financial institution that implements France&#x27;s development and international solidarity policies. It works to fight poverty and promote sustainable development. It is active in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, the Caribbean, and the French overseas territories, where it finances and supports projects that improve living conditions for populations, promote economic growth and protect the planet.

In 2023, AFD earmarked €11.3 billion to finance projects in developing countries and the French overseas territories. This development assistance represented 0.55% of France&#x27;s GDP in 2023. According to the OECD, France is in the global Top 5 for providers of official development assistance (ODA) in volume, with a strong focus on Africa. 

AFD&#x27;s headquarters is located in Paris. Its teams are based in Paris, Marseille, and in a network of 72 agencies and representations abroad and in the French overseas territories.

== History ==
AFD&#x27;s origins go back to the Caisse Centrale de la France Libre (CCFL), created by Charles de Gaulle on and successively renamed the Caisse Centrale de la France d&#x27;Outre-Mer (CCFOM) in February 1944 and the Caisse Centrale de Coopération Économique (CCCE) in 1958. By 1967, the CCCE had lost all the money-issuing duties that had been at the origin of the CCFL, but had expanded the development financing that the CCFOM had acquired in 1944. 

In 1992, the CCCE was renamed the Caisse Française de Développement. With the reform of French development cooperation in 1998, the CFD became .

In addition to a marked increase in its financing, between 2001 and 2010, there was a diversification in the financial instruments used by AFD: grants, of course, but also highly “concessional” loans or loans without interest subsidies, investment funds, guarantee funds and partnerships. AFD can provide loan recipients with liquidity to finance, at attractive rates – due to the AAA rating, the highest for long-term issuances, given to AFD by the international rating agencies –, their investment policies or programs when markets are unable to meet their needs.

In 2013, Anne Paugam took over from Dov Zerah as CEO. She is the first woman to head AFD.
In 2014, The Act on Development and International Solidarity recognized the importance of the work conducted by AFD towards France&#x27;s international commitments.
In 2015, Gaël Giraud became AFD&#x27;s Chief Economist. In 2016, Rémy Rioux took over as CEO from Anne Paugam.

== AFD’s framework for activity ==

=== General legal framework ===

As a specialized credit institution, AFD is subject to banking law, particularly in the field of risk sharing. 
AFD is a public financial institution. The Government has entrusted it with the role of the main operator for France&#x27;s cooperation policy. It thereby combines the functions of development bank and implementing agency for France&#x27;s Official Development Assistance policy.

=== AFD and French government’s policy ===

AFD has a contract of objectives and policies with the state and implements the orientations defined by the Inter-ministerial Committee for International Cooperation and Development (CICID), chaired by the Prime Minister.

* “Contribute to the implementation of the state’s official development assistance policy abroad”
* “Contribute to the development of France’s overseas departments and territories, as well as New Caledonia.”

In overseas France, AFD conducts a policy, on behalf of the state, to support public authorities and finance the economy. This mandate was reaffirmed during the first Inter-ministerial Committee for Overseas France, chaired by the French president, which was held in November 2009.

=== Governance ===

Its board of directors comprises a chairperson and 16 members appointed by a decree, including 6 representatives of the State: Ministry of the Economy, Industry and Digital Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development, Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Overseas France.

==Operations==

The French Development Agency (AFD) implements the policy defined by the French Government. It works to combat poverty and promote sustainable development.

It achieves this by financing and supporting projects that improve living conditions for populations, promote economic growth and protect the planet.

In 2014, AFD allocated EUR 8.1bn to finance projects, including EUR 6.35bn in developing countries and EUR 1.55bn for overseas France.

=== Sectors ===
In 2014, AFD allocated some EUR 767m to education and health and invested over EUR 633m in water and sanitation programs. Projects related to territorial development benefited from over EUR 4bn, i.e. almost half AFD&#x27;s commitments, with projects in the energy, transport and telecommunications sectors in rural and urban areas. For 2014, the breakdown for commitments by sector is as follows:

* 22% in the productive sector,
* 27% in infrastructure and urban development,
* 21% in energy,
* 2% in biodiversity and natural resources,
* 8% in water and sanitation,
* 9% in education and health,
* 2% in agriculture and food security.
* 7% is divided among various sectors.

=== Development and climate change ===
AFD also operates in emerging
countries for issues related to the protection of the environment and energy management.

In a crosscutting manner to these sectors, in 2014, AFD earmarked 53% of its international activity for the fight against climate change, &quot;i.e.&quot; EUR 2.8bn, which financed development projects that also have a positive impact on the climate.

AFD, &quot;via&quot; the projects it finances and several initiatives, is gearing up for the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). For example, with the GoodPlanet Foundation, it is putting on a photo exhibition “60 SOLUTIONS Against Climate Change”, which presents concrete, innovative and effective initiatives in four sectors that combine climate change and economic development.,

=== Geographical areas of operation ===

AFD has been working for over sixty years to promote development in Southern countries and the French overseas territories. It is active in the field in over 90 countries, where it finances and supports projects that improve living conditions for populations, promote economic growth and protect the planet: getting children into school, assisting farmers, financing small businesses, water supply, tropical forest conservation, combating climate change... AFD&#x27;s strategy is guided by sustainable development. Its operations are in line with the Millennium Development Goals, at the intersection of the objectives of economic growth, poverty reduction and environmental conservation.

A wide range of financial and technical instruments meet the different needs of countries: grants, guarantees, equity investments, subsidized loans, loans on market terms and technical assistance.

It develops financial and intellectual partnerships with other donors and contributes, in conjunction with its supervisory authorities, to public policymaking and to France&#x27;s influence in the development sphere.

==== Latin America and Caribbean ====
In Latin America and the Caribbean, AFD promotes sustainable and equitable development through green and inclusive growth. There are a number of projects to fight climate change, for urban development, as well as projects to promote social convergence.

==== Sub-Saharan Africa ====
Sub-Saharan Africa is the priority region for France&#x27;s public development policy. In 2014, AFD invested EUR 2.95bn in the region, i.e. 36.5% of its total financing. Among the many projects, a number focus on promoting access to essential services, the growth of sustainable cities, the development of infrastructure, family farming and job-creating enterprises, as well as on the preservation of natural resources.

==== Asia ====
In Asia, AFD works to promote environmental and regional balances, with a focus on projects that limit the environmental footprint of cities or contribute to regional convergence.

==== Mediterranean and Middle East ====
AFD supports the region&#x27;s political and economic transition, with a focus on promoting Euro-Mediterranean integration, territorial development and job creation. The AFD also funds restoration works, such as that of the Saint Hilarion monastery which the AFD funded in order to have the Byzantine-era site inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage Sites list.

==== Overseas France ====
Since 1946, AFD has had a public service mandate to provide a reference public service provision for credit and social housing. In 2014, overseas France accounted for 19% of AFD&#x27;s activity, i.e. EUR 1.55bn. AFD conducts several types of action in overseas France. Its activities are based on the following areas: financing and assisting public policies, advisory services for local authorities, promoting business competitiveness and job creation, supporting regional integration and action for sustainable development. This involves financing and supporting projects that improve living conditions for populations and promote economic growth, while preserving the environment. Thanks to its financing, its expertise and its knowledge production, it assists the local public sector, finances companies, housing and urban development, and supports regional cooperation.

It fulfills this mandate through nine agencies throughout the overseas territories: French Guiana, French Polynesia, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, New Caledonia, Réunion, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Wallis and Futuna.

In the overseas departments (DOM), in Saint Martin, Saint Barthélemy and Saint Pierre and Miquelon, AFD also represents the public investment bank Bpifrance, which finances the creation, innovation, investments and international development of French SMEs.

AFD is the reference shareholder in seven social housing companies (Simar in Martinique, Sic in New Caledonia, Sig in Guadeloupe, SIDR in Réunion, Siguy and Simko in French Guiana and Sim in Mayotte). These property companies promote, manage and build social housing.

Finally, it provides part of the staff of the note-issuing banks, Institut d&#x27;Emission d&#x27;Outre-mer and Institut d&#x27;Emission des Départements d&#x27;Outre-mer.

=== Knowledge production ===

Knowledge production is a major activity for AFD and aims to contribute to the definition of the public policies of France and its partners. It has become an essential complement to the financial and technical tools. AFD&#x27;s knowledge production started to play an important role in the 2000s. This drive for knowledge production is based on the organization of seminars and conferences, training given by CEFEB, a studies and research program, and the establishment of partnerships with academic and research institutes.

AFD also offers a number of publications on developing countries and the French overseas territories:
* Afrique Contemporaine, a sociological, political and economic review on Africa;
* The Working Papers series, which reports on ongoing research;
* The ExPost publications;
* The Focales series, which describes practical case studies (projects, partnerships, experiments...) and puts them into perspective;
* The A Savoir series, which gathers either literature reviews or existing knowledge on issues that present an operational interest;
* The Recherches series, which presents research actions initiated or led by AFD;
* The Conférences et Séminaires series, which provides a wide audience of readers with the main outcomes and lessons learned from the research conducted by AFD and its partner development assistance actors;
* The MacroDev series, which provides analyses focused on a country, region, or on macroeconomic issues related to development processes;
* Publications co-edited with the World Bank;
* Other co-publications;
* Regards sur la Terre, the annual sustainable development report coordinated by AFD and IDDRI;
* The Ideas for Development blog, a forum for exchanges coordinated by AFD, open to development actors and the public interested in development.

All this contributes to improving knowledge of the Official Development Assistance policy: “its rationale, its effectiveness, its interactions with the other public policies, its role in the management of globalization” AFD&#x27;s aim is to become an internationally recognized research center, both in terms of sustainable development and global public goods, and the design of innovative financing instruments.

=== AFD departments and subsidiaries ===

==== PROPARCO ====

PROPARCO is an AFD subsidiary set up in 1977. It is a development finance institution with a mandate to promote private investments for growth, sustainable development and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in emerging and developing countries. It provides financing tailored to the specific needs of investors in the productive sector, financial systems, infrastructure and private equity.

PROPARCO is jointly held by AFD (59.04%) and private shareholders from the North and South.

==== CEFEB ====
The Center for Economic and Banking Studies (CEFEB) is AFD&#x27;s training institute. It is based in Marseille and offers training for partners from the South in order to contribute to building their capacities. It also acts as a platform for the dissemination of AFD&#x27;s expertise towards its partners.

==== FFEM ====
AFD handles the secretariat and financial management of the French Facility for Global Environment (FFEM), a bilateral public fund set up by the French Government in 1994. It is a financial instrument for France&#x27;s cooperation and development policy dedicated to environmental protection and sustainable development.

It is coordinated by five ministries (Economy and Finance, Foreign Affairs, Sustainable Development, Research, Agriculture) and AFD.

==Leadership==

==Controversy==

In 2007, AFD was called into question for its support for French companies suspected of contributing to deforestation in Central Africa. However, no legal proceedings were brought against AFD.

AFD has strict procedures during project appraisal for impact control and measurement in terms of social and environmental responsibility. It has provided EUR 900,000 of financing to the Central Africa Forest Commission (COMIFAC), which is responsible for guiding, coordinating, harmonizing and taking decisions in terms of the conservation and sustainable management of forest ecosystems. Mr. Joyandet, French Secretary of State for Cooperation and Francophonie from March 2008 to July 2010, criticized the Chief Executive Officer at the time, Mr. Severino, for AFD&#x27;s emergency-oriented approach, without a long term-vision and a certain lack of scope. However, the Minister&#x27;s remarks did not gain wide consensus among the development community.

According to the Cameroon National Anti-corruption Commission (CONAC), two front companies, including one controlled by AFD, have been suspected of fraud. In December 2013, CONAC presented its 2012 activity report in Yaoundé, indicating that over CFA 113bn had been misappropriated from the cotton development company (SODECOTON) between 2002 and 2011.

In December 2021, created under the name Caisse centrale de la France libre in 1941, the public financial institution could change its name again in the coming months, 80 years after its launch. Or a project in the process of reflection, which also includes an overhaul of its operation and its development policy, which &quot;appear unsuitable in relation to our experience&quot;, according to its director Rémy Rioux.

<text>Corinnidae is a family of araneomorph spiders, sometimes called corinnid sac spiders. The family, like other &quot;clubionoid&quot; families, has a confusing taxonomic history. Once it was a part of the large catch-all taxon Clubionidae, now very much smaller. The original members of the family are apparently similar only in that they have eight eyes arranged in two rows, conical anterior spinnerets that touch and are generally wandering predators that build silken retreats, or sacs, usually on plant terminals, between leaves, under bark or under rocks.

In 2014, Martín Ramírez recognized the family in a restricted sense, including only the subfamilies Corinninae and Castianeirinae. Two former subfamilies of the Corinnidae are now treated as separate families, Phrurolithidae and Trachelidae. As now recognized, Corinnidae contains 71 genera and over 800 species worldwide.

Members of the genus &quot;Castianeira&quot; appear to be mimics of ants and velvet ants. Other corinnid ant-like genera include &quot;Mazax&quot;, &quot;Myrmecium&quot; and &quot;Myrmecotypus&quot;. &quot;Corinna&quot; is the type genus for the family and consists of small running spiders.

<doc id="1316478" wikidata="Q2705098" url="?curid=1316478" title="Television personalities in Japan">
<text>[[Television personalities]] in Japan, known as in Japanese, are celebrities who regularly appear in mass media in Japan, especially as panelists on variety shows. During the Golden Age of Hollywood, bankable stars in the United States were described as &quot;talents&quot; and were distinguished from production crews, which were seen as having more technical than charismatic talents.

==Careers==
Japanese television programs often feature these media personalities. Many, sometimes dozens at a time, are called in to take part in these prime time shows. Their participation in these programs varies greatly and includes performing, voicing opinions, mimicking fellow celebrities in a practice called &quot;monomane&quot;, taking part in game shows, joking or just being present for the entire duration of the show (known as being part of the &quot;gallery&quot;).

While it is very common for &quot;tarento&quot; to appear in serious Japanese television drama or movies, they are distinguished from mainstream actors by the fact that, where an actor might go on variety television to advertise their latest venture, &quot;tarento&quot; often appear on variety shows with no apparent promotional agenda outside of a personal one.

Often, &quot;tarento&quot;, whether men or women, have notoriously short career spans (around one or two years) and their earning capabilities are not as high as popularly imagined. The vast majority make just enough to maintain a middle-class lifestyle in Tokyo, Japan&#x27;s media capital. This is because their talent agencies take a majority share of their earnings for the appearances that they make on TV. Part of the money given up by the &quot;tarento&quot; is to pay for initial support the agencies gave them in terms of free housing, financial stipends, and promotion of that person. These cuts can sometimes be as much as 90%. However, their work achieves social prominence (and all the associated benefits) and a successful &quot;tarento&quot; career can be the launching point for a career as movie actor or even political figure. &quot;Tarento&quot; who are unable to leverage their career into something larger sometimes slowly fade away into eventual obscurity.

Important considerations for &quot;tarento&quot; include , which is the Japanese equivalent of a Q Score, , and the character or personality by which they are known (often just &quot;chara&quot;). The distinction between the first two terms is an important one, as celebrities such as Egashira 2:50 might be widely disliked by audiences and still make a living; being disliked is a part of their character. Additional elements of a &quot;tarento&quot;″s character may include their origins and other careers (e.g., author/illustrator Lily Franky), intelligence (e.g., Masaru Hamaguchi, a comedian who once misspelled his own name on a televised test), hobbies and skills (many female celebrities are known for how well or poorly they can cook, from the former members of Pink Lady on the high end of the continuum to race queen Yinling on the low end) or appearance (many non-Japanese talents such as Bobby Ologun use their looks to this effect). The way by which a person becomes &quot;tarento&quot; can more often than not be categorized.

==Types==
===Multi-tarento===
Celebrities that have established themselves or are/were active in another field within the industry are considered to be multi-tarento. These people usually come from a different background within the entertainment industry than just appearing on television programs. They then transition into becoming television personalities. Multi-tarento can be actors, musical artists, models, voice actors, directors or anyone known for their work within the industry. In the United States and European countries, Takeshi Kitano is recognized as a prominent director, but is still evaluated as a &quot;multi-talent&quot; in Japan and still appears on Japanese talk shows in a humorous context. Other examples are IKKO, Shoko Nakagawa and Shinobu Sakagami.

===Owarai tarento===

&#x27;Owarai&#x27; is Japanese for laughter, or in this case a &quot;comic talent&quot;. &quot;Owarai tarento&quot; are generally former comedians, often in manzai (type of stand up), who, after becoming famous, make appearances on variety television programs that are comedic in nature.

Owarai tarento have different genres and cast-types on television programs. In variety shows, they are generally cast to create comedic effect and to keep conversation flowing. Some owarai tarento become MCs (Masters of Ceremony) in later stages of their career, where they direct the flow of a program and often the most important individuals for the show. The MCs are usually those with exceptional conversational abilities and reaction, as they hold an important role. Examples are Shinya Ueda, Sanma Akashiya, Shōfukutei Tsurube II and George Tokoro.

:See list of Japanese comedians.

===Nepotic tarento===

Sometimes, Tarento are given prominent air time on TV and are promoted heavily due to their association or relationship to an established celebrity or politician, and not because they possess any discernible skills for entertaining audiences. One of the bigger examples of this phenomenon is Kazushige Nagashima, the son of the legendary Yomiuri Giants player and manager Shigeo Nagashima. After failing to become a successful baseball player, he turned to the entertainment circuit and used his father&#x27;s name to make inroads. The son of controversial Tokyo governor Shintaro Ishihara, Yoshizumi Ishihara, has also achieved a measure of exposure due to nepotism as well as Kotaro Koizumi, son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.

===Athlete tarento===

These are usually former athletes who flourished as sportspeople and have retired to become a tarento in the entertainment industry. Due to their achievements as athletes in their respective sports, they garner a good deal of attention and often become successful television personalities. Athlete tarento can be active athletes as well, although most often they do not enter the entertainment industry until after retirement. Examples are Masakiyo Maezono, Karina Maruyama, So Takei, Konishiki Yasokichi, and Saori Yoshida.

===Gimmicked tarento===
These are people on programs that have a &quot;trademarked&quot; phrase, wardrobe, or mannerism that is used to elicit laughs from the audience. Their on-TV characters tend to be very shallow as they milk the comic device or &quot;neta&quot; (ネタ) that gave them notoriety and hardly ever expand on their character. It is these figures that tend to have the shortest shelf life on TV as they quickly fade into obscurity after the novelty of their act wears off. They are known in Japan as &quot;ippatsuya&quot; (一発屋), or &quot;one trick ponies&quot;. Examples are Yoshio Kojima, Dandy Sakano, and Razor Ramon Hard Gay.

===Idol tarento===
Additionally, Tarento, both male and female, may be discovered and be given considerable exposure due to their perceived physical beauty and endowments, but the way they are promoted is different from being strictly a fashion model. This is because they spend time making music CDs, star vehicles, and television appearances that capitalize on their physical beauty or on-screen charisma. These people are occasionally referred to as &quot;obaka-aidoru&quot; or &quot;dumb idols&quot;. Many of the men that fall into this category come from Johnny &amp; Associates, a male talent agency.

===Gaijin tarento===
A , also known as and abbreviated &quot;gaitare&quot;, is a foreign celebrity active exclusively or almost exclusively in Japan. The phrase literally means &quot;foreign talent&quot;. Having at least a conversational level Japanese, combined with foreign looks as well as a standout personality, they are often chosen because they meet the Japanese stereotypes of foreigners (for example, the notion that Americans generally look rugged and have blond hair and blue eyes). &quot;Gaikokujin tarento&quot; are seen as curiosities by the Japanese, just as other &quot;tarento&quot;, and are cast differently depending on their ethnicities. In the 1991 documentary &quot;The Japanese Version&quot;, veteran foreign personality, Dave Spector, stated, &quot;[I&#x27;m] doing things like the lowest bozo, circus kind of stuff. But it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. A lot of times the foreigners on TV, models and what-not, are compared to pandas. They use that term here—pandas—because they&#x27;re cuddly, you can go and have fun with them, and throw a marshmallow and that&#x27;s about it. And you don&#x27;t get involved any deeper than that. But ... since I&#x27;m making half a million dollars a year, I&#x27;m very happy to be a panda.&quot;

Gaijin tarento largely inspire interest in the Japanese viewer due to their use of the Japanese language, a feat considered especially remarkable by the Japanese. Native Japanese speakers consider their language to be especially difficult to learn due to the depth of ritual expressions, methods of referring to the self and others, and indirect and empathetic speech. These skills are viewed as unlikely and impressive in a non-native Japanese speaker. Thus the main attraction of gaijin tarento is not their talent or fame but their clown-like clumsy use of the Japanese language, which serves to further define the Japanese as &#x27;those who can speak Japanese&#x27;. Gaijin tarento is overall an objectification of foreigners that reinforces the separateness, uniqueness, and specialness of &quot;Japaneseness&quot;.

==Maintaining relevance==
Occasionally, people will become tarento as a result of a directional shift in their career due to a loss of popularity and relevance in their original field. It is especially common for musicians to become tarento due to the tremendous turnover in acts that are featured by record labels. Some examples include Kiriko Isono, who debuted as part of a singing trio and made a name for herself based on a rapid wit and willingness to put herself down for a laugh; Mari Yaguchi, the third leader of Morning Musume who left the group in 2005 due to a scandal but has continued to appear on variety shows and Japanese television drama since leaving; the late Ai Iijima, a former porn starlet; and Yūsuke Santamaria, who fronted several bands before moving into acting and being a tarento. Fashion modeling can also provide an entry path, with such examples as Rinka and Aya Sugimoto.

<doc id="1316480" wikidata="Q15514847" url="?curid=1316480" title="Uncertainty avoidance">
<text>In cross-cultural psychology, uncertainty avoidance is how cultures differ on the amount of tolerance they have of unpredictability. Uncertainty avoidance is one of five key qualities or &quot;dimensions&quot; measured by the researchers who developed the Hofstede model of cultural dimensions to quantify cultural differences across international lines and better understand why some ideas and business practices work better in some countries than in others.According to Geert Hofstede, &quot;The fundamental issue here is how a society deals with the fact that the future can never be known: Should we try to control it or just let it happen?&quot;

The uncertainty avoidance dimension relates to the degree to which individuals of a specific society are comfortable with uncertainty and the unknown. Countries displaying strong uncertainty avoidance index (UAI) believe and behave in a strict manner. Individuals belonging to those countries also avoid unconventional ways of thinking and behaving. Weak UAI societies display more ease in regards to uncertainty. People in cultures with high uncertainty avoidance try to minimize the occurrence of unknown and unusual circumstances and to proceed with careful changes step by step by planning and by implementing rules, laws and regulations. In contrast, low uncertainty avoidance cultures accept and feel comfortable in unstructured situations or changeable environments and try to have as few rules as possible. People in these cultures tend to be more pragmatic and more tolerant of change.

When it comes to the tolerance of unpredictability, the areas which uncertainty avoidance deals with the most are technology, law, and religion. Technology assists with the uncertainty done by nature with new developments. Law defends the uncertainty of behavior by the people with rules that are set. Religion accepts the uncertainty people cannot get protected from. Individuals use their beliefs to get through their uncertainties.

==Key concepts==
There is a wide scale on where specific cultures fall under the uncertainty avoidance. Three types of uncertainty avoidance are high, low, and moderate uncertainty avoidance. Hofstede&#x27;s uncertainty avoidance scale shows the want to reduce any visible uncertainty that is placed in the life of a person.

===High uncertainty avoidance===
There are many ways to detect if someone has a high amount of uncertainty avoidance. Typically, the use of formality in interaction with others, dependence of formalized policies and procedures, apparent resistance of change, and intolerance of untraditional ways are all characteristics of high uncertainty avoidance.

Also, people from high uncertainty avoidance cultures demonstrate higher stress and anxiety levels. These individuals have a high value on control, which means that having a set structure in everything of their life helps. The use of rigid rules assists them with defining what they believe in and how they behave. The development of new ideas makes them uncomfortable and only take risks that they know have success rates. Older people in high UA are highly respected and feared of. When children are being taught the beliefs of their culture, they cannot question them. 

People in high uncertainty avoidance societies may be afraid of people who are different from them. They may show signs of Xenophobia.

====High uncertainty avoidance countries====
Some of the highest uncertainty avoidance countries include Finland, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Japan, Mexico, Portugal, and South Korea.

===Low uncertainty avoidance===
In contrast, people can also exhibit characteristics of low uncertainty avoidance. Unlike high UA, those with a low level use informality in interaction with others, they often rely on informal norms and behaviors in most matters. Also, they will show moderate resistance to change.

Individuals that come from a culture with low UA care about letting the future come without the control or plan of it. Rules that are placed do not have an influence on them. Those with a low UA believe that it is okay to question the people in higher positions. They have lower stress and anxiety rates. Younger people in low UA are respected and when they are being taught the beliefs within their culture, they do not have to follow them right away. When new ideas are brought up, they are open-minded when hearing about them. People from low UA don&#x27;t find situations that aren&#x27;t clear as problems that might cause them trouble. Originality will have higher value and likely to be taken into consideration.

Additionally, people with low uncertainty avoidance do not have any difficulty with interacting with people who are different from them.

====Low uncertainty avoidance countries====
Some of the lowest uncertainty avoidance countries include Jamaica, Denmark, Singapore, Sweden, and Ireland.

===Moderate uncertainty avoidance===
People of moderate uncertainty avoidance cultures are in between the high and the low uncertainty avoidances. These in take some characteristics from both avoidances. The people with moderate UA are those who live in the United States and Canada.

===Risk===
Uncertainty avoidance is commonly mistakenly associated with risk avoidance. However, UAI does not deal with risk avoidance. In fact, it deals with the habits and rituals in which a society feels comfortable practicing.

==Applications==
===Business===

David S. Baker and Kerry D. Carson performed a study to evaluate uncertainty avoidance among field sales personnel. They selected 155 subjects from the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. Their research pointed towards individuals using both attachment and avoidance to lower their uncertainty avoidance in the workplace. People who were high on uncertainty avoidance and those low on it behaved differently. Sales personnel who were low on uncertainty avoidance saw no need to attach with their team or adapt to their environment, but those high on it used both avoidance and attachment to deal with situations. Those who reported moderate levels of uncertainty avoidance preferred to use adaptation rather than attachment when needed. 

In a study conducted by Nelson O. Ndubisi, Naresh K. Malhotra, Dilber Ulas, and Gibson C. Ndubisi it was found that customer loyalty is less in countries with low uncertainty avoidance. Additionally, it can be inferred from the study that customer trust is higher in countries with high uncertainty avoidance.

It is also believed that the uncertainty avoidance index (UAI) has a significant effect on consumers&#x27; acceptance of unfamiliar brands in the retail market. Brand familiarity, celebrity endorsement, and cultural differences all have an effect on determining an individual&#x27;s UAI. Eliane Karsaklian has studied the effect UAI has on consumers&#x27; attitudes towards familiar and unfamiliar brands in different cultures (specifically American and French). She concludes that uncertainty avoidance has a deep role in shaping consumers&#x27; attitudes towards brands. However, the claim that UAI (or any other dimension) has an &quot;effect&quot; is inconsistent with Hofstede&#x27;s acknowledgement in his reply to Brendan McSweeney (Human Relations, 55.11 - 2002) that &quot;dimensions do not exist&quot; and therefore cannot be causal i.e. they cannot have effects. Like many studies, Karsaklian analysis confuses correlation with causation.

Hofstede concluded that people in high uncertainty avoidance societies may avoid changing jobs. Whereas, people in low uncertainty avoidance societies may feel more at ease with changing jobs.

===Politics===

In politics, cultures with high uncertainty avoidance citizens tend to have low interest in politics and citizen protests are repressed. This is because political unrest would bring about changes which the majority would not be comfortable with. There also tends to be many laws with laws being more specific as to avoid any uncertainty in the interpretation and to guide which behavior is acceptable.
On the other side of the spectrum in cultures with low uncertainty avoidance citizens tend to be very interested in politics as it serves as a tool for change. Protests are accepted as another tool for change and laws are general.

===Crime===
In 2005 Robert M. Wiedenhaefer conducted a study on the factors contributing to terrorism. Wiedenhaefer concluded that uncertainty avoidance has a high association with terrorism. He asserted through his analysis that uncertainty avoidance is the strongest predictor in such crimes.

Ellen Giebels, Miriam Oostinga, Paul Taylor, and Joanna Curtis conducted a study in February 2017 on the impact between police-civilian interactions. They hypothesized that a clear and more communicative style of interaction would be used by high uncertainty avoidance negotiators. Their study supported this hypothesis. In addition, they found that uncertainty avoidance highly influences interactions between said individuals.

===Education===

In cultures with high uncertainty avoidance, teachers are viewed as having all the answers and learning is structured. In cultures with low uncertainty avoidance, teachers are not necessarily viewed as all knowing and the learning is open minded with less focus on facts.

=== Nursing ===
In the study of &quot;Transformational Leadership, Creative Self-Efficacy, Trust in Supervisor, Uncertainty Avoidance, and Innovative Work Behavior of Nurses&quot; done by Bilal Afsar and Mariam Masood in Mansehra, Pakistan, there were two groups of nurses to see how the relationship among transformational leadership relate to their work behaviors in self-efficacy, trust in superiors, and uncertainty avoidance. The first study hypothesized that there is a correlation between transformational leadership, trust, and uncertainty avoidance that takes a toll on the successfulness or effectiveness of their work behavior. The second study hypothesized that the correlation between transformational leadership, trust, and uncertainty avoidance is due to self-efficacy. With a strong and effective transformational leader, leader that finds a change that needs to be done and makes the change following a specific path with the help of members in the group, providing them with what is necessary to work with; makes their work behavior more successful when nurses have a high level of trust and uncertainty avoidance.

The nurses from Study 1 were from public sector hospitals where they were allowed to test out new ideas without the fear of losing their job. They were allowed to take risks in their job location. Employees with high uncertainty avoidance deal with uncertainty through the use of rules and regulations that are set in place. Transformational leaders assist their employees or people below them to take their risks with the correct research and knowledge prior to taking them. These employees with high UA are more open to their transformational leaders. The nurses from Study 2 were from private sector hospitals where they were allowed to do the same as Study 1. Both studies turned out to have the same conclusion, where there were high levels of trust and uncertainty avoidance, transformational leadership had a higher relationship with innovative behavior. Also, creative self-efficacy did have a correlation among transformational leadership, trust, and uncertainty avoidance. Although, it was discovered that transformational leadership was only useful when there was high levels of trust and high uncertainty avoidance. The leadership wouldn&#x27;t work if there was a high level of trust and low uncertainty avoidance or the opposite.

<doc id="1316481" wikidata="Q2405147" url="?curid=1316481" title="MacGyver">
<text>Angus &quot;Mac&quot; MacGyver is the title character and the protagonist in the TV series &quot;MacGyver&quot;. He is played by Richard Dean Anderson in the 1985 original series. Lucas Till portrays a younger version of MacGyver in the 2016 reboot.

In both portrayals MacGyver is shown to possess a genius-level intellect, proficiency in multiple languages, superb engineering skills, excellent knowledge of applied physics, military training in bomb disposal techniques, and a preference for non-lethal resolutions to conflicts. MacGyver works for the fictional &quot;Phoenix Foundation&quot; in Los Angeles, which in the original series was an independent think tank, and in the 2016 reboot is a clandestine government organization using the cover of a think tank. In addition to his scientific knowledge and inventive use of common items, he always carries a Swiss Army knife and refuses to carry a gun.

==&quot;MacGyver&quot; (1985–1992 original series, 1994 specials)==
===Personality===
MacGyver is a non-violent problem solver and typically eschews the use of guns. His violent actions are performed in self-defense, and he takes non-fatal action when possible.

MacGyver is depicted as an ally to social and environmental causes. He aids vulnerable populations throughout the series. During vineyard worker strikes, MacGyver assists Latino protesters against vineyard owners. MacGyver appears to have a strong connection with children, filling the role of &quot;big brother&quot; at the series&#x27; inception. MacGyver demonstrates his allegiance to children by assisting a mountain excursion for delinquent youths. MacGyver also conducts hearing research at a school for deaf children. In regard to the environment, MacGyver strives to protect endangered species such as eagles, the black rhino, and wolves. At an unspecificed date during the series, MacGyver begins practicing vegetarianism.

MacGyver is persistent and spontaneous. He employs improvisation to evade anticipatory countermeasures, and his plans are difficult to thwart on account of their unpredictability. This constant spontaneity challenges MacGyver as well as his adversaries. Because MacGyver continues to operate in this manner, it is assumed the tactical advantage of spontaneity outweighs its disadvantages. This is observed by MacGyver&#x27;s nemesis Murdoc.

MacGyver demonstrates mood congruence, exhibiting grief in tragedy, fear in peril, and pain in suffering. This stands in contrast to exaggeratedly macho or stoic action heroes. MacGyver is introspective, and takes responsibility for personal losses and tragedies. He experiences guilt when duty prevents him from attending his mother&#x27;s death and funeral. He experiences depression when his best friend suffers a fatal climbing accident.

MacGyver&#x27;s most-used item is his Swiss Army knife. He usually carries a roll of duct tape in his back pocket, flattened out to make it fit. Other items he often has on hand are: an ID card, a Timex Camper watch, strike-anywhere matches, a few paper clips, chewing gum, and a flashlight. He also has a toolbox in his Jeep. MacGyver initially used a Jeep Cherokee and then a Jeep Wrangler beginning with Season 2, but in Season 5 he began driving his grandfather Harry&#x27;s &quot;classic&quot; 1946 Chevrolet pickup truck.

MacGyver is proficient in Russian, German, French, Italian, Spanish, and American Sign Language, and knows how to use International maritime signal flags and Morse code. He is an avid outdoorsman with skills that include skiing and outdoor survival. Despite an acute fear of heights, he is skilled at mountain/rock climbing, hang gliding, and parachuting - static line, ripcord and high-altitude military parachuting. His other hobbies include ice hockey and racing, and he has shown interest in painting and guitar.

His haircut is a mullet, in a clean-cut, lightly gelled variation on the classic hairstyle.

While never being in a long-term on-screen relationship, he has relationships with several women in individual episodes and several past long-term relationships are mentioned, from which he has one child. He is on good terms with his past romantic acquaintances.

===First name===
MacGyver&#x27;s first name was originally intended to be Stacey, as seen in a press release from Paramount. However, it was never confirmed in any episode, and remained a mystery until the seventh season; whenever he is asked about it, he says he dislikes his first name and quickly changes the subject. His grandfather, Harry Jackson, calls him &quot;Bud&quot; or &quot;Buddy&quot;. Most of his friends and colleagues call him by his last name MacGyver or simply &quot;Mac&quot;. In the final season, his first name is canonically revealed to be Angus when, while knocked unconscious and hallucinating, he meets a 7th-century man named Ian M&#x27;Iver (&quot;son of Ingmarr&quot;) whose son has the same first name. This revelation is repeated in the series finale, which introduces MacGyver&#x27;s son as having the middle name Angus, as well as on the packaging of the &quot;MacGyver&quot; DVD season sets.

===Biography===
MacGyver&#x27;s birthdate is first seen as January 23, 1951 but was then revised in season 2 as March 23, 1952, the date which continued to be used for the rest of the series. (However, in Series 6 Episode 12 &quot;Jerico Games&quot;, he looks at a 1968 high school yearbook when he was supposedly 18.) He was raised in Mission City, Minnesota. MacGyver was in the Cub Scouts. A Den Mother by the name of Mrs. Fryfogel taught him &quot;backwoods common sense&quot; and the motto &quot;Be prepared.&quot; At the age of 7, his grandmother Celia Jackson and father James MacGyver (Martin Milner) were killed in a car accident in which they both drowned, and MacGyver grew up with his mother, Ellen MacGyver. His grandfather, Harry Jackson (John Anderson) acted as his father, but moved away when MacGyver was 16, working for a time in Alaska while sending money to MacGyver and his mother, and eventually settled down as a farmer in Minnesota. At about 12 years of age, MacGyver had a traumatic experience of the accidental shooting death of a friend by a bullet from a falling gun. MacGyver is a lifelong player of ice hockey, having played in his local hockey leagues and coached for a minor league team; he is also a supporter of the Calgary Flames and believed he could have made the NHL. He met Jack Dalton while in high school.

MacGyver went to Western Tech where he graduated with a dual degree in chemistry and physics. After graduating from college he turned down an offer to work at the nearby nuclear power plant and it is later revealed that he briefly served during the Vietnam War in a bomb-defusing team. Five years before the start of the series, MacGyver worked as a &quot;Hell Fighter,&quot; fighting oil well fires in Sumatra, Indonesia. Sometime during this time MacGyver&#x27;s mother died of a stroke while he was in Afghanistan on assignment, though no specifics are given other than it being after Christmas. Eventually he moved to Los Angeles where he held numerous jobs until he accidentally meets Peter Thornton, an agent at the Department of External Services (DXS). When MacGyver saves Thornton&#x27;s life using a paper clip, a wrench and shoelaces, MacGyver is offered a job as a field agent at the DXS.

In the first episode of Season 2, Thornton takes a job as Director of Operations at the Phoenix Foundation, and MacGyver follows, where he is hired as a &quot;sort of troubleshooter.&quot; He is assigned to a variety of tasks, usually field operations such as conducting environmental surveys and testing security systems. In the fifth season, Harry dies of a heart attack, at which point MacGyver believes he has no remaining relatives. In the second to last episode of the show, it is revealed that MacGyver has a son, Sean &quot;Sam&quot; Angus Malloy. Sean&#x27;s mother is the photojournalist Kate Malloy who MacGyver had met after college. Kate had been murdered in China several years prior to MacGyver meeting their son for the first time. After discovering and reuniting with Sean, MacGyver decides to resign from the Foundation in order to spend time with his son.

Two television specials featuring the character followed, both occurring and released in 1994, two years after the series ended. In the first one (&quot;MacGyver: Lost Treasure of Atlantis&quot;), MacGyver teams up with his former college archaeology instructor, Professor Atticus (Brian Blessed), to help him prove his theories about ancient Atlantis while dodging the bullets of genocidal Yugoslav troops, a Greek revolutionary and a ruthless treasure hunter. Soon thereafter (&quot;MacGyver: Trail to Doomsday&quot;), he investigates the murder of a friend in Britain, and eventually traces it to an unscrupulous businessman who sells nuclear arms research for profit. No mention in either special is made of Pete Thornton, Jack Dalton, MacGyver&#x27;s son Sean or any of the show&#x27;s other regulars.

===Family===
*Harry Jackson (John Anderson) – MacGyver&#x27;s maternal grandfather. Harry is introduced in season 1. Harry usually calls MacGyver &quot;Bud&quot;, and MacGyver refers to him as &quot;Harry&quot;, but why is never revealed until the episode &quot;Phoenix Under Siege&quot;. Harry had cut ties with Mac and his mom, and was living a life of solitude until MacGyver came to him while trying to keep a low profile due to a bounty on his head. After this they kept in regular contact, with Harry appearing in several more episodes until he dies of a heart attack in the fifth season. MacGyver&#x27;s grandmother was mentioned several times but never portrayed in the series, though her name was revealed to be Celia.
*James (Martin Milner) and Ellen MacGyver (Shelia Moore) – MacGyver&#x27;s parents. Both of MacGyver&#x27;s parents are deceased before the series begins. James MacGyver died, along with MacGyver&#x27;s grandmother, when their car went off the road and they drowned in a creek when MacGyver was 7. His mother, Ellen died from a stroke the day after an unspecified Christmas, but Mac was not able to make it home to see her. James appears in two episodes. Ellen appears in one.
*Sean &quot;Sam&quot; Angus Malloy (Dalton James) – MacGyver&#x27;s first son. Sean is the son of MacGyver and photojournalist Kate Malloy, who had a relationship after college before the series began. Unknown to MacGyver until several years after Kate&#x27;s death, he fathered a child with Malloy, Sean. Sean appears in only one episode.

===Cultural impact===

The term &quot;MacGyver&quot; has now become part of the colloquial American English lexicon. When one &quot;MacGyvers&quot; a solution to a problem, one finds a simple yet elegant solution using existing resources. This is in contrast to a kludge, or a Rube Goldberg, which is generally complicated and problematic.

==&quot;MacGyver&quot; (2016–2021 series)==
Lucas Till portrays a younger version of Angus &quot;Mac&quot; MacGyver in the 2016 reboot of the series.

===Personality and skills===
MacGyver has a genius-level intellect and a particular ability for adaptation and improvisation. He is a resourceful U.S. operative who works for the Phoenix Foundation, a covert U.S. government agency operating under the guise of a think tank. Trained as an EOD technician for the Army, Mac prefers to use non-lethal means to stop his enemies, and refuses to carry a gun, though if necessary he will resort to lethal measures. He is never without his trusty Swiss Army knife and uses anything in his environment to his advantage. While not an expert in biology or medicine, MacGyver is shown to be an efficient field medic and knowledgeable in crime scene techniques and DNA sequencing procedures.

He is afraid of heights, though is able to overcome his fear to finish his missions. Though not an expert fighter, he is shown to be able to temporarily hold off multiple enemies in hand-to-hand combat, typically long enough for him to figure out a way to end the conflict using his adaptation and improvisational skills. He is proficient in multiple languages, including Italian, German and Mandarin. He also knows Morse code.

He is shown to be charming, personable, and with an easy ability to make and keep friends. MacGyver shows flashes of intense anger when his friends are threatened or when his father, who disappeared from MacGyver&#x27;s life at the age of 10, is mentioned.

===Biography===
MacGyver was raised primarily in Mission City, California. His mother died when MacGyver was 5, and his father disappeared from MacGyver&#x27;s life when MacGyver was 10. After his father&#x27;s disappearance, MacGyver was raised by his grandfather. MacGyver met his best friend Wilt Bozer in the fifth grade, and both graduated from Mission City High School. Bozer and MacGyver are roommates when the series begins, although Bozer initially believes that MacGyver works as an IT expert. MacGyver spent two years at MIT studying physics, though did not graduate. He left MIT to join the Army because he wanted to make an actual difference in people&#x27;s lives rather than thinking about theoretical problems, being trained as an EOD technician and spending three years in Afghanistan. In the Army he met Jack Dalton, who was a Delta Force soldier.

After leaving the Army, MacGyver was hired by the Department of External Services, a government clandestine operation using the guise of a think tank. Eventually, Jack Dalton left his position with the CIA and became MacGyver&#x27;s partner at DXS; by the time of the series pilot, they had spent three years as partners at DXS. After DXS&#x27;s original, unnamed cover is blown a new cover is needed which will allow for a transition of the organization&#x27;s assets so its work can continue. MacGyver suggests the name &quot;Phoenix&quot;, after the mythological bird that is reborn by rising from its own ashes, and the organization begins using the cover-name of the &quot;Phoenix Foundation&quot;.

<doc id="1316487" wikidata="Q2081109" url="?curid=1316487" title="Chilcompton">
<text>Chilcompton is a village and civil parish in Somerset, England, in the Mendip Hills two miles south of Midsomer Norton and 3.0 miles south-west of Westfield. It is on the B3139 road between Radstock and Wells, close to the A37 (between Shepton Mallet and Bristol).

==History==

The parish was part of the hundred of Chewton.

The village&#x27;s history is mainly that of farming and mining. There is a coal waste mound in the north-east end of the village. The village used to have Chilcompton railway station on the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, which closed in 1966.

==Governance==

The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council’s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.

The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Clutton Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.

Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.

The village falls in the Ashwick, Chilcompton and Stratton electoral ward. From Chilcompton the ward stretches south to Ashwick. The ward total population taken at the 2011 census was 4,835.

It is also part of the Frome and East Somerset constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. It was part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020, which elected seven MEPs using the d&#x27;Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.

==Geography==

Chilcompton has a population of 1,918. The village is situated one mile west of the Fosse Way Roman road, Downside Abbey, and Downside School, and one mile north-east of Blacker&#x27;s Hill fort. 
The only bus service that serves Chilcompton is the 173 Bath to Wells Mendip Xplorer service operated by First West of England. There are also several bus routes running between neighbouring villages and the town of Midsomer Norton.

The village has a well called Fry&#x27;s Well which lends its name to a road.

The River Somer rises in small streams around Chilcompton.

==Education==

Chilcompton has a primary school called St. Vigor and St. John. The village also has four nearby state secondary schools, The Blue School in Wells, Norton Hill School and Somervale School in Midsomer Norton and Writhlington School in Radstock. There are two private schools nearby, Wells Cathedral School and Downside School. The nearest universities are in Bath and Bristol.

==Economy==

Chilcompton is the headquarters of the fashion company Mulberry Group plc. 

There is a local store which belongs to the co-operative society, as a branch of the Radstock district co-operative society. There are also two hairdressers in the village, along with a small industrial estate in the north-east of the village. This estate has a few units of small businesses such as Nova fitness equipment and a small fruit machine distributor. There were four pubs in the village some time ago; currently there are two left: The Somerset Wagon (previously The Railway) and The Redan Inn. The Britannia and Naishes Crossing had been the other two, The Britannia being the later of the two to close in the 1980s.

==Religious sites==

The Church of St John The Baptist dates from the 15th century and was largely rebuilt in the 19th. The perpendicular embattled tower dates from around 1460 and contains six bells. The nave and aisles were completed in 1839 by Jesse Gane and the chancel and flanking chapels in 1897 by Frederick Bligh Bond. An enclosed modern structure links it to the adjoining parish hall. It is a Grade II* listed building and lies a short distance to the north of the village. The ecclesiastical parish is now united with that of Saint Vigor&#x27;s at Stratton-on-the-Fosse.

The former Christ Church on Stockhill Road, Downside, was built in 1838 by John Pinch the Younger. It was a Commissioners&#x27; church, which means it was built with money voted by Parliament as a result of the Church Building Acts of 1818 and 1824. The 1818 Act supplied a grant of money and established the Church Building Commission to direct its use, and in 1824 made a further grant of money. The building is no longer used for its religious function. It has been converted to a private residence. 

Near the village cross there was a modern Catholic church dedicated to St Aldhelm that was built by Francis Pollen in 1976 and it was served by monks from the nearby Downside Abbey until its closure in 2015.

==Recreation==

There is a skateboarding park in the north end of the village on the recreational ground, which also has a football pitch, a sports clubhouse and a tennis/basketball court. There are two more parks in the village, one of which is in the south end with a 5-a-side football pitch and a small playpark. There is another in a small cul-de-sac in the east side of the village. The primary school also hosts a multi-sports facility.

==Events==

The village holds a village day fete every year, hosting live acts, games, stalls and foodstuffs, along with guest speakers such as Michael Eavis (owner of Glastonbury Festival). There have also been some charity events such as sports relief run-a-mile held in the recreational grounds. The primary school hosts summer and winter fairs. The village hall holds many events from the team at Take Art, a group providing a variety of entertainment, such as stand-up comedy, musical acts and other entertaining acts. The local actors guild (CADS — Chilcompton Amateur Dramatics Society) led by a headmaster of a nearby school, Andrew Morris, put on productions every year, traditionally comic, though recently they have moved to more serious plays, such as Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;.

The Redan Inn won the award for the best rural pub in Mendip in Bloom competition 2006.

===Sports clubs===

The Chilcompton football team is in division 2 of the junior league. A cricket team is being organised to play the local village rival Stratton-on-the-Fosse.

<doc id="1316491" wikidata="Q6922542" url="?curid=1316491" title="Mount Olive Correctional Complex">
<text>Mount Olive Correctional Complex (MOCC) is the male maximum security prison for the state of West Virginia, United States. MOCC is an operational unit of the West Virginia Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation.

Built as a replacement for the Civil War-era West Virginia Penitentiary at Moundsville, Mount Olive Correctional Complex (MOCC) is located seven miles east of Montgomery on Cannelton Hollow Road in Fayette County. MOCC is the state&#x27;s only maximum-security correctional facility and has a current capacity of 1,030 inmates. MOCC houses the most violent, high-risk, dangerous and disruptive inmates in the state and has the most diverse inmate population in the state; consisting of general population, punitive segregation, administrative segregation, intake, special management, mental health, acute medical, and work camp inmates.

Construction of MOCC began in the spring of 1991 and was completed in December 1994. The facility was dedicated on December 12, 1994, and received it first inmates on February 14, 1995. Inmate transfers were completed on March 27, 1995, and the West Virginia Penitentiary was closed. Total construction costs for MOCC were $61.8 million.

The facility is encompassed by a secure perimeter fence approximately one mile long. Of the 120-acre site, approximately 80 acres are inside the secure perimeter. Extensive use is made of both electronic and manual security controls. MOCC operates as a small town, having its own post office and ZIP code, power plant, electrical sub-station, fuel depot, water supply, central warehouse, maintenance garage, hospital and medical clinic, gymnasium, chapel, library, classrooms, courtroom, food service and laundry facilities.

Professionals through contractual agreements provide medical, dental, mental health and food services. The West Virginia Department of Education provides many educational and vocational programs for the inmate population such as ABE/GED, Transition Skills, Business Education, Vocational Agriculture, Welding and Culinary Arts. An Apprenticeship Program in Food Service is also available. Limited college courses for associate degrees are also available through BridgeValley Community &amp; Technical College.

In partnership with Catalyst Ministries, Appalachian Bible College operates an on-site extension campus at MOCC which focuses on moral rehabilitation. Mount Olive Bible College offers an accredited Bachelor of Arts degree in Bible &amp; Theology, and allows inmates to be ordained as ministers. This program is unique to all but two prisons in the United States.

<doc id="1316505" wikidata="Q5109774" url="?curid=1316505" title="Christian Jacob (musician)">
<text>Christian Jacob is a French jazz pianist. He has gained widespread exposure as co-leader, arranger and pianist with vocalist Tierney Sutton, although he has also maintained a substantial career as a solo artist and leader.

==Early years==
Jacob was born in Metz, Lorraine on 8 May 1958. A pianist by age four, he was immersed in studying the French classics. Something of a child prodigy, Jacob had perfect pitch and natural talent. He did not discover jazz until age 10, but when he did, its improvised nature appealed to him immediately. Early influences were Dave Brubeck and Oscar Peterson. As a teen, Jacob studied under Pierre Sancan at the Conservatoire National Superieur de Musique in Paris. Later, he would teach piano at the Conservatoire National de Region in Metz.

In January 1983, Jacob entered Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts, and won many awards as a student, including the Joe Zawinul Jazz Masters Award, Oscar Peterson Jazz Masters Award, and &quot;Down Beat&quot; &quot;Top Collegiate Jazz Soloist&quot; before graduating magna cum laude in 1985. Jacob then took a teaching position at Berklee.

During his years in Boston, he formed &quot;Bostonian Friends&quot;, a musical partnership with Swiss saxophonist Fritz Renold, which produced jazz recordings (&quot;Starlight&quot; 1996) and classical commissions (&quot;The 6 Cycles&quot; with the Thai Symphony Orchestra 1999, and &quot;Helvetic Suite&quot; 1998). Although having renounced the classical performing circuit for jazz, Jacob has maintained ties with the classical world through projects such as these commissioned works. Renold introduced Jacob to the Swiss Youth Jazz Orchestra, for which he was an arranger and educator throughout the 1990s. From 1992 to 1994, Jacob also served as Director in Residence of the &quot;Orchestre Regional Jazz de Lorraine&quot; in Nancy, Meurthe-et-Moselle, and composed their inaugural commission.

== Career ==

===Professional years===
While still at Berklee, Jacob worked with vibraphonist Gary Burton, but left Boston to tour with Maynard Ferguson through 1992. Jacob served as performer, writer, and arranger with Ferguson&#x27;s band. This led to Ferguson producing Jacob&#x27;s first piano trio record, featuring John Patitucci and Peter Erskine. Sidemen for his follow-up trio project &quot;Time Lines&quot; were Steve Swallow and Adam Nussbaum. Jacob developed material with a third trio featuring Miroslav Vitouš and Bill Stewart. The first two recordings were released on Concord Records, but the later is yet to be released.

Jacob has extensive credits as a sideman, including Phil Woods, Michael Brecker, Randy Brecker, Flora Purim, Airto Moreira, Terje Gewelt, Carl Saunders and others, but his most visible association has been as co-leader and pianist for Telarc recording artist Tierney Sutton.

===The Tierney Sutton Band===
Initially Jacob was hired to perform on one recording with Tierney, but the group bonded musically and gave up their leader/sidemen statuses. Sutton, Trey Henry, Ray Brinker, Kevin Axt and Jacob became co-leaders of The Tierney Sutton Band. As co-leaders, they recorded eight CDs. &quot;Unsung Heroes&quot;, &quot;Blue in Green&quot;, &quot;Something Cool&quot;, &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m with the Band&quot;, &quot;On the Other Side&quot;, &quot;Desire&quot; and &quot;American Road&quot;. The latter four were each nominated for a Grammy Award. In 2012 Christian and The Tierney Sutton Band received two Grammy nominations for &quot;American Road&quot;, Best Jazz Vocal Album and Best Arrangement Accompanying a Vocalist.

===The Christian Jacob Trio===
Jacob released three trio recordings on his own independent label WilderJazz. The 2004 release, &quot;Styne &amp; Mine&quot;, is a tribute to the music of Jule Styne, and reached No. 3 in the jazz radio charts. The trio then recorded &quot;Contradictions&quot; in 2006. The recording pays homage and offers another look at the original compositions of pianist Michel Petrucciani. Jacob&#x27;s next trio recording was a joint venture with Japanese label SSJ, titled &quot;Live in Japan&quot;. It was recorded live at Tokyo Tuc Jazz Club in 2008.

===Musical director for Betty Buckley===
In 2011 Jacob became music director for the Broadway singer Betty Buckley. His introduction to her world of Broadway was a week of sold out performances at Feinstein&#x27;s nightclub in New York. Musically it was a perfect fit. He was happy to reunite with an aspect of classical music. At the end of 2011 they brought the show into the recording studio. &quot;Ah, Men! The Boys of Broadway&quot; will be released in August 2012 by Palmetto Records.
His arranging credits include writing for Randy Brecker, Franco Ambrosetti, Benny Golson, Gary Burton, Tommy Smith and The Scottish National Jazz Orchestra, Jazzaar (The Swiss Youth Jazz Orchestra) and his own big band &quot;Big Band Theory&quot;.

<text>Edgar Bennett III (born February 15, 1969) is an American football coach and former running back who is the wide receivers coach for the Jacksonville Jaguars of the National Football League (NFL). Bennett played college football for the Florida State Seminoles and was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the fourth round of the 1992 NFL draft. He also played for the Chicago Bears.

==Early life==
Bennett attended Robert E. Lee High School in Jacksonville, Florida and won varsity letters in football, basketball, and track. Influenced by football coach Corky Rogers, he was a Class 4A All-State running back, and was a SuperPrep All-Dixie selection.

==Playing career==
===College===
Bennett attended Florida State University. He lined up primarily at fullback in a backfield that included future NFL running backs Amp Lee, Marquette Smith, William Floyd, Zach Crockett and Sean Jackson. When Lee was suspended for the Cotton Bowl, Bennett started at halfback.
Bennett is considered one of the most versatile fullbacks in FSU history. His career all-purpose yardage totaled more than 2,300 on 389 touches, good for 20 touchdowns. He was an all-around player who ran a 4.5 40 and caught 93 passes for over 1,000 yards.

===National Football League===

====Green Bay Packers====
Bennett was drafted in the fourth round (103rd overall) by the Packers in the 1992 NFL draft. He started his Packer career as a fullback, but he became the starting running back in 1995 and gained 1,067 yards rushing. As both a fullback and a running back, Bennett excelled as a receiver leading the Packers in receptions. He continued as the starting running back throughout the 1996 season, but in the latter half, Dorsey Levens was receiving significant playing time at running back. Bennett&#x27;s career as a Packer culminated in their Super Bowl XXXI victory. He ruptured his Achilles tendon in the 1997 preseason and did not play that year. He was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in 2005.

====Chicago Bears====

Bennett played with the Chicago Bears in 1998 and 1999 before retiring after the 1999 season.

==NFL career statistics==

==Coaching career==

===Green Bay Packers===

Bennett rejoined the Packer organization in 2001 as director of player development. He later served as running backs coach for six seasons. In February 2011, Bennett was named wide receivers coach. In February 2015, Packers head coach Mike McCarthy promoted Bennett to offensive coordinator.

===Oakland / Las Vegas Raiders===
On January 13, 2018, Bennett was hired by the Oakland Raiders as their wide receivers coach under head coach Jon Gruden. On February 2, 2022, the team announced it would retain Bennett under new head coach Josh McDaniels. On February 4, 2025, Bennett was dismissed by the Raiders.

===Jacksonville Jaguars===
On February 7, 2025, the Jacksonville Jaguars hired Bennett to serve as their wide receivers coach.

==Personal life==
Edgar&#x27;s daughter Elyse Bennett was the seventh overall pick in the 2022 NWSL Draft to KC Current.

The Salm () is a river in eastern Belgium (provinces of Liège and Luxembourg), left tributary to the river Amblève. Its source is in the Ardennes, close to the border with Luxembourg near Bovigny. The Salm flows through the municipalities Gouvy, Vielsalm and Trois-Ponts, where it joins the river Amblève. It was also fought over in World War II. The 106th Golden Lions Division of the United States Army held the river until overrun by the Germans. Some of the men ran into the river to get away from the Germans and made it across successfully.</text><links>

<doc id="1316537" wikidata="Q7441106" url="?curid=1316537" title="Sean Jones (defensive end)">
<text>Dwight Andre Sean O&#x27;Neil Jones (born December 19, 1962) is a Jamaican-born former professional football defensive end, who played for the Los Angeles Raiders (1984–1987), Houston Oilers (1988–1993), and Green Bay Packers (1994–1996). He won Super Bowl XXXI with the Packers, beating the New England Patriots. Jones was selected to the Pro Bowl after the 1993 season. Sean Jones&#x27; brother Max Jones played college football at Massachusetts and later played professional football with the Birmingham Stallions in the USFL in 1984. 

==College career==
Jones attended Northeastern University, where he lettered for four years in football. At Northeastern he played on the offensive line his freshmen and sophomore seasons before flipping to the defensive side for his junior and senior season where he became a defensive presence.

Prior to attending Northeastern University, Jones graduated from the Montclair Kimberley Academy in Montclair, New Jersey where he played football, basketball and lacrosse.

Jones became a member of the Nu Phi graduate chapter of Omega Psi Phi fraternity in Houston, Texas in 2004.

==Professional career==
Jones played the first four years of his career for the Los Angeles Raiders, who selected him in the second round of the 1984 NFL draft with the 51st overall pick. In Jones&#x27; third year, 1986, he had a career high 15.5 sacks and 74 tackles. In 1988 the Houston Oilers traded the ninth overall pick in the NFL draft for Jones. Jones went on to play six seasons for the Oilers, amassing 50 sacks during this time. In 1994, Jones signed with the Green Bay Packers as a free agent. Jones formed a bookend at defensive end with Reggie White. Jones retired after the Packers won Super Bowl XXXI on January 26, 1997. During his three years with the Packers, Jones had 24.5 sacks.

==Post NFL career==
In 2001 and 2002, Jones was a reserve color commentator for the NFL on FOX.

In December 2003, arbitrator Roger Kaplan ruled that Jones violated National Football League Players Association regulations in his financial dealings with NFL player Ebenezer Ekuban. Jones received a two-year suspension, prohibiting him from representing NFL players until February 26, 2005. Jones later sued Ekuban and his attorney for slander and libel leading to Ekuban declaring bankruptcy in 2003. Former player Cris Dishman won a US$396,000 judgment against Jones involving a bad investment. Jones later counter-sued Cris Dishman and his former wife Karen Dishman; the previous matter was declared settled and Jones received a money judgment against both Cris and Karen Dishman in 2006 for their part in illegally trying to extort more money from Jones.

In January 2016, he became a co-host for KBME Houston. He now is the defensive coordinator for Cornell University Sprint Football.

<doc id="1316541" wikidata="Q21507872" url="?curid=1316541" title="Henning (surname)">
<text>The surname Henning was originally found in East Prussia. It is derived from &quot;Henneke&quot;, which is a diminutive of Johannes. The Low German suffix &quot;-ing&quot; means &quot;son of&quot;. The name is indigenous to the North German areas Mecklenburg, Hannover, Hamburg, Holstein and Pommern; especially the towns Stralsund and Greifswald, in Mecklenburg, near the Baltic Sea is well known as places where the name originated. Both towns formed part of Denmark up until the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648).

==Etymology==
Between the years 1300 and 1500 the name HENNING was used as a popular nickname for “the Son of John (Johannes)”. In the old Baltic dialect a rooster was called a “Hen” (hen = male, henne = female). The Baltic (or North German) “ing” was added to indicate that it was a name deduced from the name of a father or ancestor.

==Origins==
The name originated amongst noblemen and knights, such as:

* Henning = Johannes Older, who lived during 1290 in the vicinity of Stralsund;
* Henning = Johannes Brunswick, who lived during 1305 at Kolberg. Today Kolberg is in Poland, but during 1305 it formed part of the country which is known today as Germany.
* Henning = Johannes Dotenberg (Knight) who lived during 1326 in the vicinity of Greiffswald. It is thought that he could be a descendant of Johannes Older.
* Earl Henning of Irkesleve who lived during 1330 in Haldslohe.

==Distribution==
During the 13th and 14th centuries the descendants of these first Hennings spread over the areas today known as Germany, Denmark and Norway. Unfortunately all records from this time were destroyed.

During the 17th and 18th centuries several Hennings moved elsewhere—also to the New World. Today, one of the biggest Henning clans is found in South Africa. However, Henning families exist in almost every country in the Western world.

==Descendants==
A few Henning descendants, however, remained in the vicinity of Stralsund and Greifswald. It is known that Jacob Henning (the Old) was born during 1635 at Demmin (near Greifswald). Jacob Henning and his descendants became known as the Henning Family of Karnin. Karnin is approximately 25 km from Stralsund. Jacob Henning and his descendants were wealthy and important property owners, who lived in a castle. Their castle was confiscated in 1945, during the Second World War, by the communist government who took over Eastern Germany. Consequently the family spread across Western Germany.

<doc id="1316565" wikidata="Q4766653" url="?curid=1316565" title="Ann Rutledge (train)">
<text>The Ann Rutledge was a passenger train service operated by Amtrak running between St. Louis, Missouri, and Kansas City, Missouri, as part of the &quot;Missouri Services&quot; brand. In 2009 Amtrak consolidated the &quot;Ann Rutledge&quot;, &quot;Kansas City Mule&quot;, and the &quot;St. Louis Mule&quot; under the new name &quot;Missouri River Runner&quot;.

== History ==
=== Pre-Amtrak ===
The Alton Railroad inaugurated the &quot;Ann Rutledge&quot; in 1937 as a companion to the &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; over the St. Louis–Chicago route. The Alton named the train after Ann Rutledge, a woman from New Salem, Illinois, who may have been the first love of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln. The &quot;Ann Rutledge&quot; used the &quot;Lincoln&quot;&#x27;s original lightweight equipment set, while the &quot;Lincoln&quot; received a matching set originally used by the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad&#x27;s (B&amp;O) &quot;Royal Blue&quot;. The Gulf, Mobile &amp; Ohio Railroad (GM&amp;O) continued the &quot;Ann Rutledge&quot; upon its merger with the Alton in 1947. The GM&amp;O ended the &quot;Ann Rutledge&quot; on April 27, 1958.

=== Amtrak ===

Amtrak revived the name &quot;Ann Rutledge&quot; on February 15, 1976, for an Amfleet-equipped train on the St. Louis-Chicago route, replacing a &quot;Turboliner&quot; frequency. The revival proved short-lived: on October 31 Amtrak extended the Laredo-St. Louis &quot;Inter-American&quot; through to Chicago, replacing the &quot;Ann Rutledge.&quot; In a reversal of the situation with the Alton in the 1930s, Amtrak used the &quot;Ann Rutledge&quot;&#x27;s Amfleet coaches to re-equip a revived &quot;Abraham Lincoln.&quot; Amtrak revived the &quot;Ann Rutledge&quot; again on October 30, 1977, replacing the &quot;Abraham Lincoln.&quot;

From its revival in 1977 until October 30, 2006, the &quot;Ann Rutledge&quot; operated as trains 303/304 along a route between Chicago and Kansas City via St. Louis, serving as part of both the &quot;Illinois Service&quot; and &quot;Missouri Service&quot;. On October 30, 2006, the Chicago-St. Louis &quot;State House&quot; was replaced with the &quot;Lincoln Service&quot;, and the &quot;Ann Rutledge&quot; was cut back to a St. Louis-Kansas City service. It operated as trains 313/314, connecting to &quot;Lincoln Service&quot; trains 303/304 at St. Louis. In 2009, Amtrak consolidated the &quot;Ann Rutledge&quot;, &quot;Kansas City Mule&quot;, and the &quot;St. Louis Mule&quot; under the new name &quot;Missouri River Runner&quot;.

In May 2022, Amtrak quietly returned the Chicago-Kansas City via St Louis route under the name &quot;Lincoln Service Missouri River Runner&quot;, a combination of the names of the two services.

<text>Prince Janusz Radziwiłł, also known as Janusz the Second or Janusz the Younger (, 2 December 1612 – 31 December 1655) was a noble and magnate in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Throughout his life he occupied a number of posts in the state administration, including that of Court Chamberlain of Lithuania (from 1633), Field Hetman of Lithuania (from 1646) and Grand Hetman of Lithuania (from 1654). He was also a voivode of Vilna Voivodeship (from 1653), as well as a starost of Samogitia, Kamieniec, Kazimierz and Sejwy. He was a protector of the Protestant religion in Lithuania and sponsor of many Protestant schools and churches.

For several decades, the interests between the Radziwłł family and the state (Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth) had begun to drift apart, as the Radziwiłłs increased their magnate status and wealth. Their attempts to acquire more political power in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania culminated in the doings of Janusz Radziwiłł, who is remembered in Polish historiography as one of the Grand Duchy nobles responsible for the end of the Golden Age of the Commonwealth.

In his times he was one of the most powerful people in the Commonwealth, often described as a &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the entire Grand Duchy of Lithuania. During the Deluge, the Swedish invasion of Poland-Lithuania during the Second Northern War, he sided with the Swedish king signing the Treaty of Kėdainiai and the Union of Kėdainiai. This move however antagonised him with most of other nobles, including members of his own family. His forces were eventually defeated in battle and he himself died in a besieged castle at Tykocin.

==Early life==

He was born on 2 December 1612 in Papilys (Popiela). He was heir to one of the most powerful of princely Polish–Lithuanian families, the Radziwiłł family.

In September 1628 he departed for a four-year-long voyage, primarily in Germany and the Netherlands, returning to the Commonwealth&#x27;s capital of Warsaw by autumn 1632. Soon afterward the new king of the Commonwealth, Władysław IV Vasa, sent him with a diplomatic mission to the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. As a reward, he received his first governmental office, becoming the podkomorzy (Court Chamberlain) of Lithuania in early 1633. He took part in the Smolensk War in 1634, through he primarily accompanied the king, and did not participate actively in major combats. He became a regular part of Władysław IV Waza&#x27;s company, spending much time at the royal court over the next five years. In 1635 he became the starost of Kamieniec, and in 1638, Kazimierz Dolny (near Lublin). Since 1636 he administered his family&#x27;s estates, through not very efficiently, which he admitted himself. He also attended most of the Sejm (Commonwealth&#x27;s parliament) sessions.

He married a Katarzyna Potocka on 2 February 1638. He was a Calvinist, and his wife, Catholic, though this did not cause significant difficulties. They had three children, though only their daughter Anna Maria, born in 1640, survived to adulthood. Katarzyna died on 21 November 1642. In 1645 he married Maria Lupu, daughter of a Moldavian voivod Vasile Lupu.

==Rise to power==

The death of his father in 1641 made him one of the wealthiest magnates in the entire Commonwealth. In 1646 he became a member of the senate of Poland, as he an important office that granted him this privilege: in April that year, he became the Field Hetman of Lithuania. Later, in November, he also received another prestigious title, that of a starost of Samogitia. In 1648 he was elected to the Lithuanian Tribunal. Later that year, the Commonwealth suffered two drastic events: death of king Władysław (succeeded by John II Casimir Vasa), and the beginning of the Khmelnytsky Uprising. In February 1649 he commanded the Commonwealth forces in the victorious Battle of Mazyr, and in July, at Battle of Loyew. Fighting resumed in 1651, and Radziwiłł was once again victorious, commanding the Lithuanian forces at the Second Battle of Loyew in July, capture of Kiev on 4 August, and the Battle of Bila Tserkva in September.

In 1652 a liberum veto was invoked in the Sejm by Władysław Siciński, forcing it to disband. Some historians have speculated that Siciński might have acted on orders from Janusz Radziwiłł, through Wisner observed there is no evidence to support this theory.
In 1653 the Cossacks allied themselves with Russia, and in turn, Russian forces invaded the Commonwealth from the east. In March that year Janusz received the office of voivode of Wilno. On 17 June 1654 Janusz was elevated from the Field Hetman position to the Grand Hetman of Lithuania. Despite the nominations, relations between him and the king have been worsening. In late August 1654 Janusz Radziwiłł defeated invading Russians at the Battle of Shklow, but this was his last victory. Days later he was defeated by the Russians at the Battle of Shepeleviche. The following winter Lithuanian counter-offensive proved unsuccessful; with the inconclusive Siege of Mahylyow.

==Union with Sweden==
Janusz Radziwiłł trust in the Poles was damaged during the Battle of Vilnius in 1655 when he, being the Great Hetman of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, had to defend the Grand Duchy&#x27;s capital Vilnius from the approaching Tsardom of Russia forces. When a large Russian army approached Vilnius (at least 41,000 men), Janusz Radziwiłł could muster just 5,000 to 7,000 men. The morale was further damaged by the order of king John II Casimir Vasa to royal troops (about 5,000 men) to retreat to Marienburg. City residents began hasty evacuations. Most valued treasures, including the coffin of Saint Casimir, main books of Lithuanian Metrica, and valuables from Vilnius Cathedral, were transported outside the city.

Janusz Radziwiłł took up defensive position on the northern shore of the Neris river near the present-day Green Bridge to cover the evacuations. The battle started around 6 a.m. on 8 August 1655 and lasted the whole day. The Lithuanians managed to capture three Russian flags. At night, the Lithuanian army split into two groups that retreated to Vilkaviškis and to Kėdainiai. The garrison of the Vilnius Castle Complex surrendered two days later. The invading forces plundered the city and murdered its inhabitants for several days. A fire consumed part of the city. Tsar Alexis of Russia arrived to the city on 14 August. The city was so badly devastated that he could not find suitable accommodations in the city and instead built a large tent in .

With the war against Russia still ongoing, the Commonwealth suddenly had to face a new enemy. In June 1655 Swedish forces started to advance across the northern territories of the Commonwealth. The Swedish invasion of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, part of the Second Northern War, is known in Lithuanian history as the Deluge. Together with his cousin Bogusław Radziwiłł, Janusz began talks with Swedish king Charles X Gustav of Sweden, discussing how to reverse the Union of Lublin which created the Commonwealth. Janusz first declared the Grand Duchy a Swedish protectorate in the Treaty of Kėdainiai on 17 August 1655, then the brothers signed another treaty on 20 October according to which the Swedish–Lithuanian union was founded, and in which Radziwiłł&#x27;s were to rule a part of the Grand Duchy.

Janusz was not alone in abandoning the Polish side; many Polish nobles, such as Deputy Chancellor of the Crown Hieronim Radziejowski and Grand Treasurer of the Crown Bogusław Leszczyński, believing that John II Casimir was a weak king or a Jesuit-king, encouraged Charles Gustav to claim the Polish crown. John II Casimir had few friends among the Polish szlachta, as he openly sympathized with Austria and showed disregard and contempt for the Commonwealth. Poznań Voivode Krzysztof Opaliński surrendered Greater Poland to Charles Gustav, and soon other voivodes followed.

Although much of the Commonwealth, including Warsaw, Kraków, and the western portions of the Grand Duchy, were taken by the Swedes, King John II Casimir and his allies were able to regain power after a few years starting with the Jasna Góra resistance and the Tyszowce Confederation. The Swedish defeat and eventual retreat from the territories of the Commonwealth spelled an abrupt end for the plans of Janusz and Bogusław. Janusz died in Tykocin, besieged by loyal Commonwealth forces (desperate Swedish defenders later blew themselves up).

==Legacy==

Janusz Radziwiłł is ill-remembered in Polish popular culture, particularly due to the negative portrayal of his supposed treason and alliance with Swedes during the Deluge by Polish 19th century Nobel Prize winner, Henryk Sienkiewicz. Sienkiewicz, in his Trilogy, wrote about Radziwiłł&#x27;s death: &quot;Earthly ruin, a fallen soul, darkness, nothingness-that is all he managed to attain as a reward for service to himself&quot;.

In Lithuania Janusz Radziwiłł (Jonušas Radvila) is remembered favourably as prominent patron of Lithuanian press and defender of Lithuanian interest.

Janusz Radziwiłł (1612–1655) is portrayed prominently as Hetman by Władysław Hańcza, in the movie-epic &quot;The Deluge&quot; by Jerzy Hoffman.

<text>Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives,  represents the wheel arrangement of no leading wheels, eight powered and coupled driving wheels on four axles and no trailing wheels. Locomotives of this type are also referred to as eight coupled.

==Overview==
Examples of the 0-8-0 wheel arrangement were constructed both as tender and tank locomotives. The earliest locomotives were built for mainline haulage, particularly for freight, but the configuration was later also often used for large switcher locomotives (shunter locomotives).

The wheel arrangement provided a powerful layout with all engine weight as adhesive weight, which maximised the tractive effort and factor of adhesion. The layout was generally too large for smaller and lighter railways, where the more popular wheel arrangement would often be found performing similar duties.

==Usage==
===Austria===
Two 0-8-0 locomotives were delivered from Andre Koechlin &amp; Cie in Mulhouse to the Austrian Southern Railway in 1862. They were later sent to Italy and worked over the Apennines between Bologna and Pistoja.

===China===

In 1952, the Chrzanów works in Poland supplied 81 gauge locomotives, which were later versions of the Russian P24 class. By 1958, China was building their own copies resulting in such classes as the C2, YJ, ZM-4, ZG and ZM16-4.

===Christmas Island===
Peckett and Sons of Bristol built a 0-8-0 tender locomotive for the Christmas Island Phosphate Co.&#x27;s Railway in 1931.

=== France ===
The &quot;Fortes Rampes&quot; Class of 0-8-0 was designed by Jules Petit for the Chemins de Fer du Nord. built in 1858-1865 a total of 50 were made. They used a unique steam dryer mounted to the top of the boiler. This was similar to the Franco-Crosti boiler developed later. 

===Germany===

Freight engines with an 0-8-0 wheel arrangement were once very popular in Germany. The Prussian state railways had several types of 0-8-0s that were all classified as G7, G8 and G9.

The latest of these, the Prussian G 8.1, was the most numerous German state railway locomotive with over five thousand examples being built between 1913 and 1921. They remained in service with the Deutsche Bundesbahn until 1972.

The narrow gauge Heeresfeldbahn class HF 160 D were developed for wartime service during the Second World War. The engines were also classified as &quot;Kriegsdampflokomotive 11&quot; (Military steam locomotive 11 or KDL 11). After the war, the locomotives were put to use for civilian purposes.

===Russia===

The first steam locomotives 0-8-0 in Russia — have been produced since 1858. In Russia, the 0-8-0 type locomotives were represented by the various O-class (Osnovnoj-mainline) freight locomotives. They were built from the end of the 19th century until the 1920s. They were commonly called the &quot;Ovechka&quot; (Sheep) and were the most common freight locomotives in Tsarist Russia. Some are still preserved in working order.

One-thousand of the gauge standard design, also known as class 159, were built between 1930 and 1941. They were poor performers, so the Kolomna works built an improved version of these locomotives, known as the P24 class. Nine were built before 1941.

===South Africa===
On the South African Railways (SAR), shunting was traditionally performed by downgraded mainline locomotives. When purpose-built shunting locomotives were eventually introduced in 1929, the SAR preferred to adhere to the American practice of using tender locomotives for shunting, rather than the European practice of using tank locomotives. Three classes of 0-8-0 shunting steam locomotives were introduced between 1929 and 1952.
In 1929, fourteen Class S locomotives were placed in service. They were built by Henschel &amp; Son in Germany and designed to SAR specifications, with the top sides of the tender&#x27;s coal bunker being set inwards and the water tank top rounded to improve the crew&#x27;s rearward vision.
The second type, the Class S1, was designed by MM Loubser, chief mechanical engineer of the SAR from 1939 to 1949. Twelve of these locomotives, a heavier version of the Class S, were built at the Salt River workshops in Cape Town with the first being delivered in October 1947. A further 25 Class S1 locomotives were ordered from the North British Locomotive Company. Glasgow in 1952 and delivered in 1953 and 1954. The Class S1 was noted for its efficiency and economy and could cope with block loads of up to .
To meet the need for shunting locomotives with a light axle load for harbour work, these were followed in 1952 and 1953 by 100 Class S2 locomotives, built by Friedrich Krupp in Essen, Germany. To adhere to the specified weight limit, the Class S2 was built with a small boiler, with the result that it had the appearance of a Cape gauge locomotive with a narrow gauge boiler, particularly when viewed from the front. Also to reduce the axle load, it had Type MY1 tenders which rode on Buckeye three-axle bogies.

===Sweden===

0-8-0 was wheel arrangement on some Swedish freight locomotives in the early 20th century.
The most well known is probably the E class of steam locomotives as many of them survived in the strategic reserve until the 1990s, when all steam engines were removed from the strategic reserve.
The E class of locomotives entered production in 1907 and many were modified to a 2-8-0 configuration with a name change to E2.
The locomotives were intended as mixed locomotives in northern Sweden with its steeper inclines and for heavy freight in southern Sweden where the landscape is flatter.

Another locomotive was the Prussian G8.1 named the G class in Sweden which was ordered by the national railway company during WWI in 1916, but delivery was delayed until 1918.

===United Kingdom===
Two examples of 0-8-0T tank locomotives were built by Archibald Sturrock of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Great Northern Railway in 1866, but the design was not perpetuated. A tender locomotive version was introduced on the Barry Railway Company in 1889 to haul coal trains.
Francis Webb of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) built 282 examples of a compound 0-8-0 locomotive between 1892 and 1904. A further 290 examples of a simple expansion version were built by his successor between 1910 and 1922.

In 1902, John Robinson of the Great Central Railway introduced his Class 8A tender engines, which were designated the Q4 class under the London and North Eastern Railway. From 1934, the class was replaced by the Robinson 2-8-0&#x27;s and their withdrawal and scrapping began, but between 1942 and 1945 Edward Thompson converted thirteen into side-tanks, designated LNER Class Q1.

Under the grouping of 1923, the LNWR became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). Henry Fowler designed an inside cylinder engine in 1929 to replace the LNWR examples, but they proved to be unsatisfactory and ended up having shorter lives than the LNWR locomotives.

In 1914, Manning Wardle of Leeds built a side-tank engine called &quot;Katharine&quot; for the Bridge Water Collieries system. On the Kent and East Sussex Railway, the &quot;Hecate&quot; was built for Colonel Stephens by Hawthorn and Leslie in 1904, but the branchline for which it was built was never completed and since the engine was too big for his other railways, it was exchanged in 1932 for a smaller engine from the Southern Railway. &quot;Hecate&quot; ended up as a motive power depot shunter at Nine Elms Locomotive Works and was scrapped in 1950.

On the Southern Railway, Richard Maunsell&#x27;s Z class side-tank engines were first built in 1929 as a heavy shunting engine, 8 were built by 1930.

===United States===

The 0-8-0 wheel arrangement appeared early in locomotive development in the United States, during the mid-1840s. The configuration became popular and was more commonly constructed as a tender locomotive. It saw extensive use as a heavy switcher and freight engine.

Beginning in 1844, Ross Winans developed a series of 0-8-0 types for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O), starting with a vertical-boiler design where the crankshaft was directly above and geared to the rear driving wheel. With a horizontal boiler, this became the &quot;Mud Digger&quot; class of engines on the B&amp;O, of which twelve were built. In late 1847, the B&amp;O moved to abandon geared drives and, in 1848, Baldwin delivered the first of a series of freight engines.

The USRA 0-8-0 was a USRA standard class, designed by the United States Railroad Administration during World War I. This was the standard heavy switcher locomotive of the USRA types, of which 175 examples were built by ALCO, Baldwin and Lima for many different railroads in the United States. After the dissolution of the USRA in 1920, an additional 1,200 examples of the USRA 0-8-0 were built.

In the 1920s, the Pennsylvania Railroad wanted the best motive power possible to handle the switching chores at their yards and interchanges. Built in its own Juniata Shops, the Pennsylvania Railroad class C1, at 278,000 lb, was the heaviest two-cylinder 0-8-0 switcher ever produced. The calculated tractive effort was 76,154 lb.

The last steam locomotive to be built in the United States for a Class I railroad was 0-8-0 no. 244, a Class S1 switch engine erected by the Norfolk and Western&#x27;s Roanoke Shops in December 1953. It was retired in March 1958.

<text>Swami Vireshwarananda, the tenth President of the Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission, was born on 31 October 1892 at Gurupura, Near Mangalore, South India. His pre-monastic name was Pandurang Prabhu; he was later known as Prabhu Maharaj. After his father&#x27;s death at an early age, his mother moved with them to his maternal uncle&#x27;s house at Mangalore.

Pandurang Prabhu studied at Madras (Chennai) Law College, where he had a chance to read the Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda. He joined at the Belur Math in the first half of 1916 and was initiated by the Holy Mother, in June 1916. He received his monastic vows from Swami Brahmananda on 12 January 1920.

After his initiation into sannyasa, Swami Vireshwarananda stayed at Varanasi. In 1921, he was sent to the Advaita Ashrama at Mayavati as a monastic worker. Later, he became its manager at Kolkata Office and was made its head in 1927. He became a trustee of the Ramakrishna Math and a member of the governing body of the Ramakrishna Mission in 1929. He was made one of the Joint Secretaries of the Order on 7 April 1938.

Vireshwarananda was sent to Varanasi, Orissa, Madras Presidency, Ceylon and other places to organize the workings of ashramas. In 1942 he finally returned to the Belur Math. When the Indian subcontinent and Asia were passing through a critical period during 1942 to 1947, he had successfully conducted several relief operations. When Swami Madhavananda took leave from his office of the General Secretary on health grounds, Vireshwarananda officiated on his behalf from 1949 to 1951. In May 1961 he was made the General Secretary of the Order, and he became the President of the Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission, on 22 February 1966 after the death of Madhavananda.

As the President of the Order, Vireshwarananda travelled extensively throughout India to spread the message of the Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Movement. During his tenure, the Order grew and became consolidated. He introduced many philanthropic activities including rural development, &#x27;Pallimangal&#x27; and training of youth in self-employment, &#x27;Janashiksha&#x27;, which encouraged the Order to venture into newer fields and thus expand its scope of service.

Though Vireshwarananda was busy with administrative work, he could find time for reading extensively. He translated into English many Sanskrit scriptures, including the gloss of Sridhara on the Bhagavadgita, the commentaries of Sankara and Ramanuja on Brahmasutra. He served the Order as its President until he died on 13 March 1985.

<text>Bryce Eric Paup (born February 29, 1968) is an American former professional football player who was a linebacker for eleven seasons in the National Football League (NFL) with the Green Bay Packers, Buffalo Bills, Jacksonville Jaguars and the Minnesota Vikings.

==Early life==
Paup grew up on a farm in Scranton, Iowa, where he played football at Scranton High School, a small school that saw Paup as one of just 19 senior graduates in 1986.

He played collegiately at the University of Northern Iowa and was selected by the Packers in the sixth round of the 1990 NFL draft.

==Professional career==
Paup played five games in his rookie 1990 season, recording no sacks. In the first game of the 1991 season, Paup was involved in a tackle below the waist on quarterback Randall Cunningham of Philadelphia Eagles that saw contact on the knee for what was soon diagnosed as a torn ACL for the quarterback that sidelined him the rest of the season (Cunningham was quoted as curious about why his knee was hit like that when Paup was already down around the waist but did not wish to put a burden on him). Paup recorded a career-high 4.5 sacks in his second year on September 15 against Tampa Bay, which also included him recording a safety in the 15–13 victory. Paup was utilized in four defensive positions during his Green Bay years, which would see him record 11 sacks in 1993 but somehow was not a Pro Bowl selection. It was 1994 when he managed to earn a Pro Bowl selection when he recorded three interceptions and 7.5 sacks. Despite being named to the Pro Bowl that year, he was not offered a contract by the Packers (who were paying him less than $600,000 that year) after the season ended, as they initially cited the salary cap as a reason before team GM Ron Wolf admitted his error in letting Paup go loose. His aggressive physical style led Packers fans to refer to his tackle as “Paup Smear”, with Paup recording 32.5 sacks in his time with Green Bay.

On March 8, 1995, the Bills signed Paup to a three-year contract worth $7.6 million with a $3.3 million signing bonus that would pair him with Bruce Smith in a 3-4 defense that had Paup assigned to &quot;line up over the tight end and rush the quarterback all game.&quot; In 1995, his first season with the Buffalo Bills, Paup was named NFL Defensive Player of the Year by the Associated Press. Paup led the NFL with 17.5 sacks, the fourth-highest single-season total of the 1990s. Paup has been considered one of the top 50 players in Bills history. NFL Total Access listed him as one of the Top 10 free agents of all time.

On February 15, 1998, Paup signed a five-year contract worth $22 million with the Jacksonville Jaguars, making him the second highest-paid linebacker in the league next to Junior Seau. Troubles with being asked to drop into coverage and a decline in sacks (having just 7.5 in 31 games) led to his unhappiness in Jacksonville; he was released after the 1999 season ended. Paup signed a one-year contract just above the league minimum on February 6, 2000. He made no starts in ten games played that year while recording two sacks.
In his career, Paup was a four-time Pro Bowl selection.

==NFL career statistics==
===Regular season===
==Coaching career==
On March 19, 2007, Paup was introduced as the head football coach at Green Bay Southwest High School. He compiled a 22–14 regular season record in his first four seasons, and in 2009 secured the second playoff victory in school history. Prior to accepting the job, he was an assistant volunteer football coach for the De Pere High School Redbirds of De Pere, Wisconsin for three years, working primarily with the linemen and linebackers.

On March 5, 2013, Paup resigned from Green Bay Southwest and began his first season as the defensive line coach at the University of Northern Iowa.

January 14, 2017, Paup was named University of Minnesota&#x27;s defensive line coach. After one season with the Gophers, Paup left the Minnesota coaching staff, reportedly to pursue a coaching opportunity in the NFL.

In August 2018, he returned to the University of Northern Iowa defensive line coach.

==Personal life==
Paup lives in Cedar Falls, IA, with his wife Denise. They have six children: Alex, Nathan, Rachel, Hailey, and twins Paige and Lauren.

<text>The Lincoln Service is a higher-speed rail service operated by Amtrak that runs between Chicago, Illinois and St. Louis, Missouri. The train is a part of the &quot;Illinois Service&quot; and is partially funded by the Illinois Department of Transportation. The train uses the same route as the long-distance &quot;Texas Eagle&quot;, which continues to and . A connection with the -bound &quot;Missouri River Runner&quot; is available in St. Louis.

, the average trip time between Chicago and St. Louis was 4 hours 59 minutes. 

During fiscal year 2023, the &quot;Lincoln Service&quot; trains carried 523,304 passengers, an increase of 9.9% from FY2022. This is a 16.7% decrease from pre-COVID-19 pandemic ridership, with 627,599 passengers in FY2019. In FY2015, the service had a total revenue of $14,266,964, a decrease of 1.3% from FY2015.

==History==
Prior to the &quot;Lincoln Service&quot;, Amtrak had operated the daily &quot;State House&quot; train between Chicago and St. Louis since 1973. Originally intended to connect Chicago and Springfield, Amtrak extended the &quot;State House&quot; south to St. Louis at its own expense because Springfield station was not designed to turn equipment. The train used a route previously owned by the Alton Railroad, which had merged with the Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad (GM&amp;O) in 1947. The GM&amp;O merged with the Illinois Central Railroad in 1972, a year after Amtrak took over passenger train service.

On October 30, 2006, Amtrak rebranded the &quot;State House&quot; as the &quot;Lincoln Service&quot; upon the addition of two new round trips, made possible by upgrades to the line. This resulted in a total of five daily round trips on the Chicago-St. Louis corridor, including the &quot;Texas Eagle&quot; and &quot;Ann Rutledge&quot;, which terminated beyond St. Louis. Beginning in April 2007, the &quot;Ann Rutledge&quot; operated only between Kansas City and St. Louis, where it connected once daily to the Lincoln Service. The &quot;Ann Rutledge&quot; was folded into the &quot;Missouri River Runner&quot; in 2009, though one &quot;Lincoln Service&quot; round trip continued to connect with the &quot;Missouri River Runner.&quot; On May 23, 2022, Amtrak began through-routing one round trip of the &quot;Missouri River Runner&quot; and &quot;Lincoln Service&quot;, creating a second one-seat service between Kansas City and Chicago (additional to the &quot;Southwest Chief&quot;, which takes a more direct route.)

===Track upgrades===

In July 2010, the state of Illinois and the Union Pacific Railroad reached an agreement under which track speeds between Dwight and Alton, Illinois were to be raised to as high as . This speed will cut the travel time between Chicago and St. Louis by 90 minutes, bringing the trip to under four hours. The first track upgrade construction was planned to be between Alton and Lincoln, Illinois and was projected to cost $98 million. The construction on this stretch began on September 17, 2010, in Alton and was completed in 2011. Most of the funding came from $1.1 billion in stimulus money for Illinois high-speed rail from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The remainder of this grant, as well as $400 million in funding from the state of Illinois, was used to complete a high-speed rail corridor for the remaining portions of the St. Louis–Chicago track. Senator Dick Durbin suggested the Dwight–Alton upgrades would create some 900 jobs, while the overall project could generate 24,000.

On March 22, 2011, an announcement was made in Chicago that an additional $685 million would be used to upgrade trackage and grade crossings between Dwight and Lincoln. Construction on the improvement project began on April 5, 2011. Upgrades included rebuilding the passing sidings so that the track spacing between the main track is increased from to .

Although much of track upgrade work was completed between 2010 and 2012, there are additional constructions including second trackage, bridge replacement and rehabilitation, drainage improvements, and grade crossings and signal improvements before the full service can be fully operated on this route. After all required improvements on the first segment between Dwight and Pontiac, Illinois were completed, Amtrak started the higher-speed rail service with top speeds of on that segment in November 2012, with the entire section between Alton and Joliet expected to have operation by 2017. 

Starting on July 7, 2021, &quot;Lincoln Service&quot; and &quot;Texas Eagle&quot; trains were allowed a top speed of after Federal Railroad Administration dual certification of the Incremental Train Control System and Interoperable Electronic Train Management System between south of Joliet Union Station and Alton, Illinois. On December 13, 2021, scheduled travel times were reduced by approximately 15 minutes between St. Louis and Chicago as a result of the increased speeds. Amtrak began testing the line for revenue service in 2022. Effective May 3, 2023, trains are authorized to travel up to on the line, while new schedules are written for the line. The new schedules debuted on June 26, 2023.

The slowest portion of the corridor is the segment between Chicago and Joliet, but improving this would require an additional $1.5 billion investment. Two projects proposed from the Chicago Region Environmental and Transportation Efficiency Program (CREATE) would remove two diamond crossings and construct an overpass to increase train speed and eliminate delays. One project is in the preliminary design phase while the proposed flyover at Brighton Park crossing is unfunded. , an alternative solution rerouting trains via the Rock Island District, which bypasses these diamond crossings and has relatively few freight trains, is being considered. This option would reduce delays and allow higher speeds between Joliet and Chicago.

==Operation==
===Equipment===

A &quot;Lincoln Service&quot; train consists of the following:
*One or two Siemens SC-44 locomotives
*Three to seven Amfleet, Horizon Fleet, or Venture coaches 
*One Amfleet or Horizon Fleet cafe/business car
===Route===

The Metra &quot;Heritage Corridor&quot; commuter line uses the same route from Joliet to Union Station.

One daily &quot;Lincoln Service&quot; round trip (train 318/319) is coupled with the &quot;Missouri River Runner&quot; at St. Louis, providing a one-seat ride between Chicago and Kansas City. Additionally, one southbound &quot;Lincoln Service&quot; (train 301) runs express to St. Louis with stops only at Joliet, Bloomington-Normal, Springfield, and Alton.

<text>Robert Darren Brooks (born June 23, 1970) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the South Carolina Gamecocks. Brooks played in the NFL for the Green Bay Packers (1992–1998) and the Denver Broncos.

==Early life==
Brooks started playing football in a pee wee league at the age of six. He then moved on to playing at Northside Junior High. He played running back until he reached college. In his senior year at Greenwood high school, he scored 14 touchdowns and gained over 700 yards. He was also a state champion track star in high school. He was considered one of the best track athletes in the world after winning the 110 meter high hurdles with a time of 13.9 seconds at the Keebler International Prep Track and Field Invitational in June 1988.

==College career==
Brooks played collegiately for the University of South Carolina (1988–1991). He was a fan favorite throughout his college career, Brooks was known for his fluid running and sure hands. He was a Freshman All-American in 1988.
Originally recruited as a running back, Brooks took to the field at wide receiver wearing the jersey number 49 for the Gamecocks. During the 1988 season, Brooks, then a freshman, made an exceptional over-the-shoulder one-handed catch for a touchdown against the Georgia Bulldogs.

==Professional career==

Brooks was drafted in the third round, 62nd overall, of the 1992 NFL draft to the Green Bay Packers. He played for the Green Bay Packers (1992–1998) and the Denver Broncos (2000). He led the NFL in kickoff returns in 1993 with a 26.6-yard average. He came into his own in 1995, following a career-ending injury to teammate Sterling Sharpe. That year, he led the Packers with 102 receptions and 13 touchdowns, while racking up 1,497 receiving yards, a franchise record that stood until broken by Jordy Nelson in 2014. During the 1995 season, Brooks caught a 99-yard pass play from Brett Favre during a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game against the Chicago Bears September 11, 1995. This reception currently ties the records for longest pass play from scrimmage with twelve other receivers.

Brooks suffered a severe knee injury in week 7 of the 1996 season against the San Francisco 49ers, when Niners cornerback Tyronne Drakeford fought off a block and pulled him down tearing his anterior cruciate ligament and patellar tendon on the play. He missed the remainder of the season, and was unable to play in Super Bowl XXXI. The Packers beat the New England Patriots 35–21. Brooks vowed to return the next season, and in 1997 he won the NFL Comeback Player of the Year award, catching 60 passes for 1,010 yards and 7 touchdowns.

Brooks later developed back problems as he was forced to change his running mechanics. He suffered through a painful season in 1998, and briefly retired before attempting a comeback with the Broncos in 2000. He appeared in only a handful of games in Denver, before again retiring from the NFL. He finished his career with 309 receptions, 4,276 yards, and 32 touchdowns. In 2007, he was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame.

Brooks popularized the Lambeau Leap touchdown celebration.

As of 2019&#x27;s NFL off-season, Robert Brooks held at least 3 Packers franchise records, including:
* Most Punt Ret Yds (playoff career): 214
* Most 100+ yard receiving games (season): 11 (1995, two in postseason)
* Most 100+ yard receiving games (playoffs): 3 (tied with Antonio Freeman and Greg Jennings)

=== Playoffs ===
==Post-football career==
After his professional football career ended, members of Brooks family called him about going into the music industry, using the nickname “Shoo-in” which he had developed during his football-playing days. Brooks created the record label “Shoo-in 4 Life”. He also has produced two CD&#x27;s entitled &quot;Jump&quot; and &quot;Down wit’ tha Bay&quot;.
He is the wide receivers coach at Brophy College Preparatory, a high school in Phoenix Arizona. 
Brooks is now married and the father of three children — Robert, Elisha and Austin — residing in the Menomonie, WI area. He has become the minister of The River Of Life Church in Menomonie, WI

<text>Huttonsville Correctional Center is a prison located near Huttonsville in Randolph County, West Virginia. It was created by an act of the Legislature in 1937 to relieve overcrowding at the West Virginia State Penitentiary. It remained a branch of the parent institution until 1947, at which time the Legislature established it as a separate entity – the West Virginia Medium Security Prison. In 1970, the center received its current name by legislative act. Huttonsville Correctional Center has been in operation since 1939 and is the oldest facility in the state.

With recently completed construction, the capacity of the Huttonsville Correctional Center is 1,186. Living quarters at this facility consist of military style dormitories in the original building and single/multi-cell housing in the new units. A Segregation Unit known as &quot;The Hole&quot; and an Intake Unit were established upon the opening of the new additions, which houses 120 single cells. Huttonsville Correctional Center is one of the largest employers in Randolph County with a Staff of 383.

There are many educational programs, both vocational and academic, offered to inmates by The State Department Of Education. These classes give them an opportunity to engage in rehabilitation efforts during their incarceration. Inmates are able to attend classes in the Adult Basic Education Program to work towards or obtain GED certificates. Vocational Courses offered includes Auto Mechanics, Auto Body, Welding, Machine Shop, Carpentry, Masonry, Electrical, and Computer Lab.

Prison Industries operate the Braille Program and Furniture plant located at Huttonsville. Regular textbooks are transcribed into Braille and distributed throughout the United States. The furniture plant refinishes and builds new furniture for various agencies.

The original focus of the prison was as a labor-intensive general-purpose farm. In 1977 the farm was turned over to the state Farm Management Commission and converted to a beef cattle operation, and the majority of inmates were transferred to other work. Today inmates work on the cattle farm, in a furniture plant, automotive parts shop, and welding shop. The prison is the largest transcriber of textbooks into Braille in the United States, accounting for almost 90% of the Braille textbooks.

The current capacity of the prison is 1183. The majority of inmates live in barracks-style housing, but two new 120-inmate cell units were opened in 2000.

<doc id="1316604" wikidata="Q663728" url="?curid=1316604" title="Silvery gibbon">
<text>The silvery gibbon (Hylobates moloch), also known as the Javan gibbon, is a primate in the gibbon family Hylobatidae. It is endemic to the Indonesian island of Java, where it inhabits undisturbed rainforests up to an altitude of . It has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 2008, as the wild population is estimated to comprise less than 2500 mature individuals.

Its coat is bluish-grey, with a dark grey or black cap. Like all gibbons, the silvery gibbon lacks an external tail, has dorsally placed scapulae, and reduced flexibility in its lumbar region. It has long, curved fingers and very long forelimbs relative to its hind limbs. On average, it reaches in weight.
It is diurnal and arboreal, climbing trees skilfully and brachiating through the forests. Brachiation is possible because of its mobile wrist joints, full rotation of the upper arm, and the ability to lock elbows in suspension. Its diet consists of fruits, leaves, and flowers.

Every three years, on average, the female gives birth to a single young, after a gestation of seven months. The offspring is nursed for about 18 months and lives with the family group until it is fully mature at about eight to ten years old.

==Threats and conservation==
The silvery gibbon ranks among the most threatened primates. It is listed as Endangered on the 2009 IUCN Red List, with the population appearing more stable than in a 2004 assessment of the species being Critically Endangered, which suggested there was a 50% chance of the silvery gibbon becoming extinct within the next decade. Habitat destruction on densely populated Java continues to reduce the natural range of the species. Many gibbons are also lost to the illegal pet trade when adults are hunted so their young can be sold in the markets as pets. There are less than 2,000 silvery gibbons in the wild on eight sites that are considered to be genetically viable for the continuation of the species. There are also a dozen small, non-viable populations. Mount Halimun Salak National Park sustains the largest population of ca. 1,000 gibbons. Other large populations of several hundred are found in the Gunung Ciremai National Park and Gunung Gede Pangrango National Park. In the latter, there is a Javan Gibbon Centre that rehabilitates ex-captive gibbons.

Several zoos operate silvery gibbon breeding programs. Despite these efforts, the future survival of this species is in question.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Like all gibbon species, the silvery gibbon lives in pairs and stakes out territory that the pair strongly defends; it has relatively small territories of about 42 acres. Females sing to declare their territory several times a day, and if strangers are spotted, the male screams in an attempt to scare them away. The majority of the solo song bouts or scream bouts are produced by females. The female vocal bouts occur after 0500 hr, with the vocal bout activity peaking around 0600 hr. In contrast, the male vocal bouts primarily occurred before 0500 hr was created in the style of a chorus, with a minimum of three participants. There are choruses around every 8.5 days. It took place sooner and lasted longer than female solo song fights. The majority of male songs begin in the dark, between 0355 and 0440 hours. The males are usually very aggressive toward others.

==Classification==
Some authors recognize two subspecies of &quot;Hylobates moloch&quot;:
* Western silvery gibbon or western Javan gibbon, &quot;H. m. moloch&quot;
* Eastern silvery gibbon or central Javan gibbon, &quot;H. m. pongoalsoni&quot;

<text>Timothy David Harris (born September 10, 1964) is an American former professional football player who was a linebacker and defensive end in the National Football League (NFL) for the Green Bay Packers (1986–1990), the San Francisco 49ers (1991–1992, 1994–1995), and the Philadelphia Eagles (1993). He played college football at the University of Memphis and was selected by the Packers in the fourth round of the 1986 NFL draft.

As he entered Birmingham&#x27;s Woodlawn High School, he began to excel in both football and basketball, but he moved with his aunt and uncle, who were teachers, to Memphis after his junior season. &quot;My grades were not so good (at Woodlawn High) and I was not hanging around with the right people,&quot; Harris said. &quot;And my mom and I thought I&#x27;d get more exposure in Memphis.&quot; [1]

Harris attended Memphis Catholic High School, but he was ineligible for most of the football season because of the move. Catholic High made the playoffs and Harris was finally declared eligible.

In his one and only game for Catholic, Harris recorded 22 tackles and caught the attention of major college coaches, including those at UCLA, Notre Dame and Tennessee. But he chose to stay close to home and play for the University of Memphis Tigers, where he was part of the nation&#x27;s top-ranked defense for two seasons in 1984 and 85.

In The NFL, Harris was a key defensive player for a Packers team that finished 10-6 during the 1989 season, their best record since 1972. The team was referred to as the &quot;Cardiac Pack&quot; because of several close game wins. Harris finished that season with a career best 19.5 sacks and was selected to the Pro Bowl. Later in his career, he recorded 17 sacks as part of the 1992 San Francisco team that reached the NFC Championship Game. Two seasons later, he would earn a Super Bowl ring as the 49ers won Super Bowl XXIX.

Harris was a talkative, outgoing player, whose signature celebration after a sack was &quot;six gun&quot; hand gestures, whereby he pretended to shoot the opposing player. The NFL eventually banned his celebration as overly aggressive and unsportsmanlike.

During a Chicago Bears game in 1987 at Soldier Field, Harris and a young pair of Bears fans almost got into a fight over a flattened cup that was thrown directly at Harris. After the NFL and Pete Rozelle investigated the incident, it was determined that no disciplinary action would take place against Harris for the outburst.

In 2022, Harris was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame.

<doc id="1316629" wikidata="Q6498635" url="?curid=1316629" title="Laura Antoniou">
<text>Laura Antoniou (born 1963) is an American novelist. She is the author of The Marketplace series of BDSM-themed novels, which were originally published under the pen name of Sara Adamson.

Antoniou is also known for her work as an editor and pioneer on the field of contemporary erotic fiction and in particular as editor of lesbian erotica anthologies including the three-volume &quot;Leather Women&quot; series, &quot;Some Women&quot;, &quot;By Her Subdued&quot;, &quot;No Other Tribute&quot;, and a collection of her own short stories and essays titled &quot;The Catalyst and Other Works&quot;. 

Antoniou&#x27;s fiction and her essays on alternate views of sexual roles have been cited by writers on the evolution of erotic fiction, and on the social politics of gender roles. Documentary filmmaker and author Tanya Trepanier&#x27;s described Antoniou as part of a growing trend of novelists exploring hybrid forms of identity, including cultural and sexual identity, that don&#x27;t fit into simple categories, using narrative storytelling as a way of understanding identities that can&#x27;t be easily defined in a traditional manner. In an analysis of contemporary novelists in the area of women&#x27;s erotic fiction, Carolyn Allen cites Antoniou&#x27;s writings as describing the concept that all relationships between people include elements of power exchange, with one partner taking the more dominant role even in day-to-day interactions. Nikki Sullivan, lecturer in Cultural and Critical Studies at Macquarie University, in her essay &quot;Sadomasochism as Resistance?&quot; refers to Antoniou&#x27;s description of sexual roles as a loose structure, due to the many choices available to the participants, with the key element being the choice of which participant guides the activities.

Writings by Antoniou are at the Leather Archives and Museum.

<doc id="1316633" wikidata="Q1680714" url="?curid=1316633" title="James Lofton">
<text>James David Lofton (born July 5, 1956) is an American former professional football player and coach. 
He played in the National Football League (NFL) as a wide receiver for the Green Bay Packers (1978–1986), Los Angeles Raiders (1987–1988), the Buffalo Bills (1989–1992), Los Angeles Rams (1993) and Philadelphia Eagles (1993). He was also the NCAA champion in the long jump in 1978 while attending Stanford University.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest wide receivers of all time, Lofton was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2003. After his playing career ended, he became a wide receivers coach for the San Diego Chargers and Oakland Raiders.

==Early life==
Lofton prepped at George Washington High School in Los Angeles, California, where he played quarterback and safety.

==College career==
Lofton played college football at Stanford University. As a senior in 1977, he received 57 passes for 1,010 yards (17.72 yards per reception average) with 14 touchdowns, and was an AP &amp; NEA second-team All-American selection. Lofton was a member of Theta Delta Chi fraternity, and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in industrial engineering in 1978.

===Track and field===
Lofton won the long jump at the 1978 NCAA Track and Field Championships with a wind-aided jump of 26 feet 11¾ inches. He won the long jump at the 1974 CIF California State Meet with a jump of 24 feet 3½ inches after placing sixth in this meet the year before. He was also a sprinter of note, with a best of 20.5 in the 200 meter. He has been an active participant in Masters track and field since 1997.

==Professional career==
Lofton was drafted in the first round (sixth overall) of the 1978 NFL draft by the Green Bay Packers. He was named to the NFL Pro Bowl eight times (seven with the Packers, one with the Bills). He was also named to four All-Pro teams. He also played in three Super Bowls during his career with the Bills. Lofton was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2003.

In his 16 NFL seasons, Lofton caught 764 passes for 14,004 yards and 75 touchdowns. He averaged 20 yards per catch or more in five seasons, leading the league in 1983 and 1984 with an average of 22.4 and 22 yards respectively. He also rushed 32 times for 246 yards and one touchdown.

Lofton is the first NFL player to record 14,000 yards receiving and was the second (one game after Drew Hill) to score a touchdown in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. During his nine seasons in Green Bay, Lofton played in seven Pro Bowls and left as the team&#x27;s all-time leading receiver with 9,656 yards (since broken by Donald Driver). On April 13, 1987, he was traded for two draft picks to the Raiders in the wake of his charge for second degree sexual assault. A month later, he was found not guilty by Brown County Circuit Court jury. Two mediocre seasons (a combined 69 catches in 28 games) with the Raiders followed before he was signed as a free agent by Buffalo in 1989. He was to sign a two-year deal with Oakland in 1993 but instead joined the Los Angeles Rams, where he played just one game before finishing the season with Philadelphia.

On the retirement of Steve Largent, Lofton became the NFL&#x27;s active leader in receiving yards at the start of 1990, through to his retirement in 1993. In 1991, Lofton became the oldest player to record 1,000 receiving yards in a season (since broken by Jerry Rice). On October 21, of that same year, Lofton became the oldest player to record 200 yards receiving as well as 200 yards from scrimmage in a game (35 years, 108 days). He is also the 2nd oldest player to have 200+ all-purpose yards in a game behind Mel Gray, (35 years, 204 days). He was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in 1999.

==Coaching career==
Lofton became the wide receiver coach for the San Diego Chargers in 2002 and continued that role until he was fired on January 22, 2008. Early in his coaching career, Lofton watched Robert Woods in a high school track meet, he noted that he would be an incredible NFL prospect. In 2005 at the NFL draft, Lofton played catch with Desean Jackson, noting he was going to be an excellent deep ball threat. Lofton was later announced as a candidate to become head coach for Oakland Raiders in 2007 but the job would later go to Lane Kiffin. In 2008, the Raiders hired him as their wide receivers coach. On January 13, 2009, Lofton was let go by the Oakland Raiders and replaced by Sanjay Lal.

==Broadcasting career==
Lofton served as a color analyst and sideline reporter for NFL coverage on Westwood One radio from 1999 to 2001. In 2009, he re-joined the network to team with Dave Sims and later Kevin Kugler on &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; broadcasts. He moved to a television position on the &quot;NFL on CBS&quot; in 2017, replacing the departing Solomon Wilcots. He has been the game analyst paired with Andrew Catalon since then. In 2023, Lofton was considered by many to be in the running for a promotion to higher tiers of the announcing ranks on CBS.

==NFL career statistics==
===Regular season===
==Personal life==
Lofton and his wife Beverly have three children including David who also played college football at Stanford. Lofton&#x27;s cousin, Kevin Bass, was a Major League Baseball player.

In October 1984, a dancer at the Marquee Club in Milwaukee accused James Lofton and his Packers teammate Eddie Lee Ivery of sexual assault. Lofton and Ivery asserted that the acts were consensual. Neither player ended up being charged in the incident due to a lack of evidence. Two years later, Lofton was charged with second-degree sexual assault following an incident in the stairwell of a Green Bay nightclub. He was found not guilty of that charge.

<doc id="1316635" wikidata="Q3264389" url="?curid=1316635" title="Lower Lea Valley">
<text>The Lower Lea Valley is the southern end of the Lea Valley which surrounds the River Lea in eastern Greater London. It is part of the Thames Gateway redevelopment area and was the location of the 2012 Summer Olympics.

A 2005 documentary &quot;What Have You Done Today, Mervyn Day?&quot; focused on the history and landscape of the Lower Lea Valley. The film was made by Paul Kelly in conjunction with British pop group Saint Etienne.

==Geography==
The Lower Lea Valley can be described as the part to the south of the long chain of reservoirs which end with the East and West Warwick Reservoirs. The Lea changes course at this point, changing from a SSW to a SSE direction for the last before its confluence with the Thames at Blackwall and Canning Town.

The north-west of the area is in the London Borough of Hackney, the south-east is in the London Borough of Newham, the south-west is in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, and the north-east is in the London Borough of Waltham Forest.

== Parkland ==

The Lower Lea includes Hackney Marshes and the Lea River Park, a collection of six parks which connect Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park to the Royal Docks and the River Thames; linked by the Leaway. 

The redevelopment of the Lea River Park opens up of new space creating walkways and cycle paths. The project completes the 26-mile long Lee Valley Regional Park which connects Ware in Hertfordshire to the River Thames.

It takes an hour to walk the entire Lea River Park with the opportunity to stop off and learn about some of the area&#x27;s rich history, including:

* Dane&#x27;s Yard – the first phase of Vastint&#x27;s Sugar House Island project. Dane&#x27;s Yard is a Conservation Area sensitively being refurbished into a business hub for creative industries. The Sugar House, a Victorian warehouse on site, is one of the development&#x27;s buildings being refurbished. 
* Three Mills – a beautiful and historic area which is home to the world&#x27;s biggest tide mill (which was listed in the Domesday Book). The mills were originally used to grind grain for flour (Stratford bakers were renowned and mentioned by Chaucer). Later the mills ground grain to make gin, and a large distillery was set up on Three Mills Island. Owned at the time by Nicholson, it fuelled the Gin Craze in London. The distillery is now 3 Mills Studios, an independent film studio, home of &quot;MasterChef&quot; and many British-made films.
* Bow Ecology Park – a thriving wildlife sanctuary with newts, water scorpions and flocks of wading birds.
* Trinity Buoy Wharf – home to London&#x27;s only lighthouse.
* Cody Dock – with Rolling Bridge – a formerly derelict dock which is being transformed into a thriving creative community space.
* The banks of the Lea at the Bow Brewery where India Pale Ale was first brewed.

== Redevelopment areas ==
Responsibility for the redevelopment of most of the area was under the remit of the London Thames Gateway Development Corporation until 2012. The area around the Olympic site is now under the control of the London Legacy Development Corporation. Part of the area is an enterprise zone including Silvertown Quays, Royal Albert Dock and Royal Albert Basin. Current areas identified for redevelopment are:

* Bromley-by-Bow, led by Tesco, Tower Hamlets
* Canning Town and Custom House, Newham
* Chobham Manor, Newham
* East Village, the former Olympic village, Newham
* East Wick, Hackney
* Marshgate Wharf, Newham
* Pudding Mill, Newham
* Silvertown Quays, Newham
* Stratford City, led by Westfield, Newham
* Sugar House Island, led by Vastint, Newham
* Sweetwater, Tower Hamlets
* Bromley-by-Bow gasholders, led by St William

<text>Cheongju National College of Science and Technology () was a public technical college in South Korea. In 2006 it amalgamated with Chungju National University which later merged with Korea National Railroad College into Korea National University of Transportation in 2012. 

The main campus is situated in Cheongju, which is the capital of North Chungcheong province. A satellite campus is located in Jeungpyeong County. The college employed about 60 professors.

==Academics==
The school&#x27;s offerings, loan modification which are entirely at the undergraduate level, are arranged under four divisions: Nursing and Health, Social Work, Industry, and Arts.

==History==
The school was first founded in the early years of Japanese occupation. It was opened by the occupation government in April 1914, as the Cheongju Jahye Hospital Nursing and Infant Care Training Facility (청주 자혜의원 조산부 및 간호부 양성소), attached to Jahye Hospital. It was reorganized as a provincial three-year technical high school in 1948, continuing its emphasis on nursing and child care. It became a technical college in 1979, and its management was transferred from provincial to national authorities in 1983.

<doc id="1316638" wikidata="Q424182" url="?curid=1316638" title="Heptose">
<text>A heptose is a monosaccharide with seven carbon atoms.

They have either an aldehyde functional group in position 1 (aldoheptoses) or a ketone functional group in position 2, 3 or 4 (ketoheptoses). Ketoheptoses have 4 chiral centers, whereas aldoheptoses have 5.

==Examples==
There are few examples of seven-carbon sugars in nature, among which are:
* sedoheptulose or -&quot;altro&quot;-heptulose (a ketose), an intermediate in the Calvin cycle and in lipid A biosynthesis
* mannoheptulose (a ketose), found in avocadoes
* -&quot;glycero&quot;--&quot;manno&quot;-heptose (an aldose), a late intermediate in lipid A biosynthesis.

== Structural role ==
The production of heptose is conserved across gram-negative bacteria. In the form of L-glycero-D-mannose-heptose, heptose is a key component in the secondary membrane of gram-negative bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria, in addition to having a cell wall, are also encapsulated by a membrane composed of lipopolysaccharides. These lipopolysaccharides comprise an endotoxin that acts as an immune system agonist and elicits strong responses. This toxin, known as lipid A, consists of a core of one to three heptose molecules. The 7-carbon heptose molecules are essential for stability in the lipopolysaccharide membrane, forming an interconnected network utilizing divalent cations.

== Role in cell signaling ==
Heptose, in the form of heptose 1-7-bisphosphate, has been found to be one of the components responsible for the pathogenic nature of gram negative bacteria. In the bacterium biosynthesis pathway, heptose is phosphorylated to heptose 1-7-bisphosphate. In addition, like other sugars, heptose may exist in either the alpha anomer or the beta anomer. Before synthetic production of heptose-bisphosphate (HBP) for studies, cytosolic HBP was thought to influence NF-kB, a transcription factor in mammalian cells. Along with producing the first synthetic version of HBP, it was shown that the beta form of the heptose acts as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) and activates the NF-kB signaling pathway. A PAMP is a specific structure, component, or molecule that triggers the immune response after recognition by pattern recognition receptors on mammalian cells.

<doc id="1316643" wikidata="Q3220135" url="?curid=1316643" title="LeRoy Butler">
<text>LeRoy Butler III (born July 19, 1968) is an American former professional football player who spent his entire 12-year career from 1990 to 2001 as a safety for the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (NFL). He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2022.

Butler was born in Jacksonville, Florida, where he was challenged by physical problems which forced him to wear leg braces and use a wheelchair at times during his childhood. However, he overcame his disability and was able to excel at high school football; Butler was named one of the 33 best Florida High School football players of all time in 2007. He went on to be a three-year starter playing college football for the Florida State Seminoles, and after a successful college career, he was selected in the second round (48th overall) of the 1990 NFL draft by the Packers.

In his 12 seasons with the Packers, Butler was a four-time first-team All-Pro. Butler recorded a sack in the Packers&#x27; Super Bowl XXXI win over the New England Patriots, and he is recognized as the creator of the Lambeau Leap touchdown celebration. Butler was named a member of the NFL 1990s All-Decade Team and was enshrined in the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Butler attended Robert E. Lee High School in Jacksonville, Florida, and played under the direction of the all-time wins leader for a high school football coach in the state of Florida&#x27;s history, Corky Rogers. Rogers coached at Robert E. Lee High School from 1972 to 1988, where he coached Butler and fellow NFL star Edgar Bennett, and from 1989 to 2016 at The Bolles School in Jacksonville, having won a total of 8 football State Championships. Before moving onto Florida State, Butler was an astounding player for the Robert E. Lee High School Generals football program.

==College career==
Butler played under head coach Bobby Bowden at Florida State University. He was a three-year starter, collecting 194 tackles and 9 interceptions, but he&#x27;s most remembered by FSU fans for his role in the &quot;puntrooskie.&quot; In 1988, against rival Clemson, FSU was backed up to its own 21-yard line, on fourth down, with a minute and 30 seconds left to play and the score tied at 21. Bowden called the famous trick play, a fake punt. The snap went to upback Dayne Williams and he slipped the ball to Butler, who ran 78 yards to set up the game-winning field goal.

==Professional career==

The Green Bay Packers selected Butler in the second round (48th overall) of the 1990 NFL draft. Butler was the third safety drafted in 1990.

He played in 181 games, earned a Super Bowl ring, for Super Bowl XXXI, following the 1996 season, was selected as an All-Pro four times and was selected to the Pro Bowl four times (1993, 1996, 1997, and 1998). He was named to the 1990s NFL All Decade Team, by the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and was later inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame, in 2007.

On November 6, 1997, the Green Bay Packers signed Butler to a five-year, $15 million contract extension that includes a signing bonus of $5 million.

On October 7, 1999, the Green Bay Packers signed Butler to a three-year, $21.50 million contract extension that includes a signing bonus of $1.63 million.

After being selected to his first Pro Bowl, the emphasis of his first name was questioned by sports commentator John Madden, who was told by Packers running back Edgar Bennett that his name is pronounced (&quot;LEE-Roy&quot;); but, after hearing a broadcast, Butler&#x27;s mother sent an e-mail to Madden describing the emphasis as (&quot;L&#x27;ROY&quot;). During his 12 seasons with the Packers, he recorded 953 tackles, 38 interceptions, 553 return yards, 12 fumble recoveries, 3 defensive touchdowns and 20½ sacks. He led or tied for the team lead in interceptions in five different seasons. He was the first defensive back in NFL history to gain entrance in the 20 Sack/20 Interception Club.

A broken shoulder blade sustained while tackling Atlanta Falcons running back Maurice Smith in the 2001 season forced him into retirement just before the 2002 season when it was discovered it had not healed properly. In 2007, he was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame.

On November 21, 2017, Butler was announced as one of 27 semi-finalists for the 2018 class of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The nomination was not Butler&#x27;s first to the Hall of Fame, but marked the first time he was named a semi-finalist for the honor.

On January 2, 2020, he was announced as one of the modern-era finalists for the 2020 class of the Hall of Fame. It was his first time being named as a finalist. He joined 14 other modern-era finalists for the class of 2020. On February 10, 2022, Butler was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

===Lambeau Leap===

Butler is credited with inventing the Lambeau Leap, a touchdown celebration in which the scoring player leaps into the arms of awaiting fans in the stands near the end zone. On December 26, 1993, the Packers were playing the visiting Los Angeles Raiders. On a second-down swing pass to running back Randy Jordan, Butler forced a fumble that was recovered by Reggie White at the Raiders&#x27; 35-yard-line. After running with the ball for 10 yards, White lateraled to Butler, who ran the remaining 25 yards into the end zone and then made a spontaneous leap into the arms of fans in the south bleachers. The Packers went on to win 28–0 to clinch what would be the first of six consecutive playoff berths, and their first in a non-strike season in more than 20 years. The move was later popularized by wide receiver Robert Brooks, who carried it a step further by leaping completely into the stands. This move is called the Lambeau Leap and now is used after most Packer touchdowns scored at Lambeau Field.

<text>Anhalt-Dessau was a principality of the Holy Roman Empire and later a duchy of the German Confederation. Ruled by the House of Ascania, it was created in 1396 following the partition of the Principality of Anhalt-Zerbst, and finally merged into the re-united Duchy of Anhalt in 1863. The capital of the state was Dessau in present-day Saxony-Anhalt.

==History==

The Principality of Anhalt arose in 1212 under its first ruler Henry I, son of the Saxon duke Bernhard III. Named after Anhalt Castle, the ancestral seat of the Ascanian dynasty near Harzgerode, the principality experienced a number of partitions throughout its centuries-long existence.
The Anhalt territory was divided among the sons of Prince Henry I into the principalities of Anhalt-Aschersleben, Anhalt-Bernburg and Anhalt-Zerbst in 1252. In the course of the partition, Prince Siegfried I, the youngest son of Henry I, received the lands around Köthen, Dessau, and Zerbst. His son and successor Prince Albert I took his residence at Köthen Castle in 1295. In 1396, the surviving sons of Prince John II of Anhalt-Zerbst again divided their heritage. The elder Sigismund I became Prince of Anhalt-Dessau and took his residence at Dessau, while his younger brother Albert IV went on to rule as Prince of Anhalt-Köthen.

Upon the death of Sigismund&#x27;s son Prince George I of Anhalt-Dessau in 1474, the principality was again divided with Anhalt-Köthen. Anhalt-Dessau was partitioned for a second time in 1544 with Anhalt-Zerbst and Anhalt-Plötzkau being created. From 1561 until 1603 Anhalt-Dessau was under the rule of the Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst, and in 1603 Anhalt-Dessau was recreated, being raised to a duchy in 1807.

Anhalt-Köthen became extinct on the death of the Duke of Anhalt-Köthen, 23 November 1847, and its territories were united to Anhalt-Dessau by Patent of 22 May 1853. Following the death of the last Duke of Anhalt-Bernburg on 19 August 1863, all of the Anhalt lands came under the rule of the Duke of Anhalt-Dessau who then took the new title of Duke of Anhalt for the newly created Duchy of Anhalt.

<doc id="1316648" wikidata="Q5164489" url="?curid=1316648" title="Constructive dilemma">
<text>Constructive dilemma is a valid rule of inference of propositional logic. It is the inference that, if &quot;P&quot; implies &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;R&quot; implies &quot;S&quot; and either &quot;P&quot; or &quot;R&quot; is true, then either &quot;Q or S&quot; has to be true. In sum, if two conditionals are true and at least one of their antecedents is, then at least one of their consequents must be too. &quot;Constructive dilemma&quot; is the disjunctive version of modus ponens, whereas destructive dilemma is the disjunctive version of &quot;modus tollens&quot;. The constructive dilemma rule can be stated:

:formula_1

where the rule is that whenever instances of &quot;formula_2&quot;, &quot;formula_3&quot;, and &quot;formula_4&quot; appear on lines of a proof, &quot;formula_5&quot; can be placed on a subsequent line.

== Formal notation ==
The &quot;constructive dilemma&quot; rule may be written in sequent notation:

: formula_6

where formula_7 is a metalogical symbol meaning that formula_5 is a syntactic consequence of formula_2, formula_3, and formula_4 in some logical system;

and expressed as a truth-functional tautology or theorem of propositional logic:

:formula_12

where formula_13, formula_14, formula_15 and formula_16 are propositions expressed in some formal system.

== Natural language example ==

:If I win a million dollars, I will donate it to an orphanage.
:If my friend wins a million dollars, he will donate it to a wildlife fund.
:Either I win a million dollars or my friend wins a million dollars.
:Therefore, either an orphanage will get a million dollars, or a wildlife fund will get a million dollars.

The dilemma derives its name because of the transfer of disjunctive operator.

<doc id="1316653" wikidata="Q2451275" url="?curid=1316653" title="Vila de São Sebastião">
<text>Vila de São Sebastião, commonly shortened to São Sebastião (Portuguese for Saint Sebastian), is a civil parish in the municipality of Angra do Heroísmo, on the island of Terceira in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores. The population in 2011 was 2,096, in an area of . It is in the southeastern part of the island of Terceira. It contains the localities Arrabalde, Boavista, Cavalas, Canada da Salga, Contendas, Cruz, Maria Vieira, Ribeira Seca de Cima, Ribeira Seca de Baixo, Salgueiros and Vila de São Sebastião.

==History==
The history of the parish is tied to the early settlement of Terceira. A year after the Infante Henry the Navigator signed a charter on 21 March 1450 in Silves to pass the donatorio of the island to the Flemish nobleman Jacome de Bruges, the nobleman made for Terceira, where he disembarked along the southeast shoreline of the island, in an area called Pesqueiro dos Meninos. But, as Francisco Ferreira Drummond later indicated, &quot;that they established themselves a league away, on a vast and appreciable field, that they called Porta Alegre, constructing a small church to the invocation of Santa Ana, the first and only church on the island, where were annexed the chapels of Santo António do Porto Judeu and São Pedro da Ribeirinha...&quot;. Drummond later added that these early settlers moved so far to avoid impending conflicts with Spain, in which Portugal was commonly active.

This areas was the oldest demographic centre by the time that Jácome de Bruges left Porta Alegre in 1456 to launch another settlement in Praia. By this time a second place, Ribeira de Frei João was already inhabited by a nascent community. The discovery of a marble slab with inscriptions by Drummond and local inhabitants in 1780 imply that the parochial church of São Sebastião was established in 1480. Although the early church of Sant&#x27;Ana da Portalegre das Quatro Ribeiras was constructed some time after early settlement, the construction of a temple in the locality of Ribeira de Frei João was almost immediate.

King Manuel I in a charter dated 23 March 1503 elevated the local community to the status of &quot;Vila&quot; (&quot;town&quot;) and seat of the municipality (which included the parishes of Porto Judeu and the locality of Raminho, which for a time pertained to the ecclesiastical parish of Altares). At this time, owing to the Church&#x27;s patron saint being Saint Sebastian, the new municipality was renamed &quot;São Sebastião&quot;.

In 1836, Francisco Ferreira Drummond fought against the idea of dissolving the old municipality and merging it into Angra do Heroísmo. On April 1, 1870, São Sebastião became part of Angra do Heroísmo and changed its name to Vila de São Sebastião.

==Architecture==
===Civic===
* Fountain of Santa Ana ()
* Lighthouse of Ponta das Contendas (), located on the southeast coast of the parish, the lighthouse is an H-shaped structure used to protect this region as a navigational aid; its plan was initiated in 1882, but nonetheless, its construction only began in 1930, becoming operational on 1 February 1934.

===Military===
* Fort of Greta (), a 16th century fort that protected the southern coast, working in conjunction with the Fort of Santa Catarina de Mós. For many years it was used to defend the territory from pirate raids, until the end of the 19th century, when it fell into ruin.

===Religious===
* Chapel of the Misericórdia of São Sebastião (), a chapel and shelter erected by the Misericórdia in the 16th century, it later became the home of the historian Francisco Ferreira Drummond until his death.
* Church of Santa Ana (),
* Church of São Sebastião () 
* Império of the Holy Spirit of São Sebastião ()

==Notable citizens==
* Francisco Ferreira Drummond (21 January 1796 - 11 September 1858), a Portuguese writer, historian and politician who fought against the extinction of the former municipality of São Sebastião, as well as author of the Annals of the island of Terceira.

The first president was an American missionary by the name of Samuel Austin Moffett. The school was forced to close by the Japanese occupation government in 1938. It was reopened in 1948, now located in Seoul. A four-year college was created in 1969. The seminary became an accredited graduate school in 1978. It became a university in 1995.

<doc id="1316660" wikidata="Q3821512" url="?curid=1316660" title="Battle of Day's Gap">
<text>The Battle of Day&#x27;s Gap, fought on April 30, 1863, was the first in a series of American Civil War skirmishes in Cullman County, Alabama, that lasted until May 2, known as Streight&#x27;s Raid. Commanding the Union forces was Col. Abel Streight; Brig. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest led the Confederate forces.

==Background==
The goal of Streight&#x27;s raid was to cut off the Western &amp; Atlantic Railroad, which supplied General Braxton Bragg&#x27;s Confederate army in Middle Tennessee. Starting in Nashville, Tennessee, Streight and his men first traveled to Eastport, Mississippi, and then eastward to Tuscumbia, Alabama. On April 26, 1863, Streight left Tuscumbia and marched southeastward. Streight&#x27;s initial movements were screened by Union Brig. Gen. Grenville Dodge&#x27;s troops.

==Battle==
On April 30 at Day&#x27;s Gap on Sand Mountain, Forrest caught up with Streight&#x27;s expedition and attacked his rear guard. Streight&#x27;s men managed to repulse this attack and as a result they continued their march to avoid any further delays and envelopments caused by the Confederate troops.

==Aftermath==
This battle set off a chain of skirmishes and engagements at Crooked Creek (April 30), Hog Mountain (April 30), Blountsville (May 1), Black Creek/Gadsden (May 2), and Blount&#x27;s Plantation (May 2). Finally, on May 3, Forrest surrounded Streight&#x27;s exhausted men 3 mi east of Cedar Bluff, Alabama, and forced their surrender. They were sent to Libby Prison in Richmond, Virginia. Streight and some of his men escaped on February 9, 1864.

The battle also led indirectly to the death of Confederate Lieutenant A. Wills Gould, an artillery officer of questionable competence, who left guns behind to be spiked by Union forces. Gould was furious with Forrest&#x27;s decision to transfer him to another command and fought an impromptu duel with him on June 14, 1863, in which Gould was killed.

==Union order of battle==
These regiments participated in Streight&#x27;s raid:
* 80th Illinois Infantry
* 51st Indiana Infantry
* 73rd Indiana Infantry
* 3rd Ohio Infantry
* 1st Middle Tennessee Cavalry (two companies)

==Preservation==
As of mid-2023, the American Battlefield Trust and its partners have saved 82 acres of the battlefield at Day&#x27;s Gap. The Trust and its partners have also preserved 40 acres at the battlefield at nearby Hog Mountain, where fighting occurred on the same day. 

Historian Fred Wise opened the Crooked Creek Civil War Museum on the land in which the skirmish at Crooked Creek took place. The museum houses numerous relics recovered from the property.

<doc id="1316666" wikidata="Q372578" url="?curid=1316666" title="Steve McMichael">
<text>Stephen Douglas McMichael (born October 17, 1957), nicknamed &quot;Mongo&quot;, &quot;Ming&quot;, and &quot;Ming the Merciless&quot;, is an American former professional football player and professional wrestler. He was a defensive tackle for 15 seasons in the National Football League (NFL), primarily for the Chicago Bears. He played college football for the Texas Longhorns and was selected by the New England Patriots in the 1980 NFL draft. After his professional football career he would go on to professional wrestling in WCW and was part of The Four Horsemen stable.

During his time with the Bears, he was a two-time Pro Bowler and five-time All-Pro, winning Super Bowl XX with the team. He ended his football career with the Green Bay Packers, before making appearances for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) ahead of WrestleMania XI.

He became a professional wrestler with World Championship Wrestling (WCW), where he became a member of the Four Horsemen stable and was a one time WCW United States Heavyweight Champion.

Before retiring from public appearances, McMichael was a regular presence on Chicago sports radio and was the namesake of a restaurant in the southwest suburbs of Chicago.

From 2007 to 2013, McMichael was the head coach of the Chicago Slaughter of the Continental Indoor Football League (CIFL). He campaigned unsuccessfully to be mayor of Romeoville, Illinois.

In 2021, he was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). McMichael was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2024.

==Early life==
McMichael was born on October 17, 1957, in Houston, Texas. His parents separated before his second birthday, and his mother later remarried E.V. McMichael, an oil company executive whose surname McMichael adopted. He has three other siblings: older brother John Richard and younger sisters Kathy and Sharon. The family moved to Freer, where he attended Freer High School. In his senior year, he lettered in six sports: football, basketball, baseball, track, tennis and golf. Baseball was his preferred sport, and whilst playing as a catcher, he batted .450 in his senior year, garnering attention from the St. Louis Cardinals and Cincinnati Reds.

==College career==
McMichael&#x27;s performances for his high school football team saw him being offered scholarships by 75 institutions. He decided to attend the University of Texas at Austin. He played as a defensive tackle for the Texas Longhorns football team from 1976 to 1979, but his freshman season was marred by the death of his stepfather. In his senior season, he was a consensus first-team All-American, and he was defensive MVP at the 1979 Hula Bowl. During his time at Texas he was an All-Southwest conference choice in 1978 and 1979, the team MVP in 1979 and the backup place kicker in 1977. In 1999 he was inducted into the Longhorn Hall of Honor

On July 17, 2010, McMichael was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.

==Professional football career==
McMichael was drafted out of Texas in 1980 by the New England Patriots but was cut before his second season. The Chicago Bears signed him as a free agent in 1981. He became one of their starting defensive tackles and helped them to a Super Bowl win in 1985. He had a streak of 101 games started until 1990, when his playing time was reduced. He led the Bears with 11 sacks in 1988. He had 108 tackles in 1989. McMichael was named to the NFC&#x27;s Pro Bowl teams for the 1986 and 1987 seasons.

McMichael gained notability in a 1991 game against the New York Jets. With the Bears down 13–6 with 1:54 remaining, McMichael forced a Blair Thomas fumble and recovered it at the New York 36. Quarterback Jim Harbaugh then threw a game-tying touchdown to Neal Anderson with :18 left in the game. The Bears went on to win in overtime when Harbaugh scored on a 1-yard TD run. Bears coach Mike Ditka said in 2005 that McMichael was the toughest player he had ever coached. He played with the Green Bay Packers in 1994 before retiring. Aside from his &quot;Mongo&quot; moniker, McMichael was also nicknamed &quot;Ming the Merciless&quot;, or &quot;Ming&quot; for short.


In August 2023, he was named a finalist for the Seniors ballot of the Pro Football Hall of Fame for the class of 2024. He had previously been nominated in 2014 and 2015. On February 8, 2024, McMichael was officially selected to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. He was formally inducted on August 3, 2024, with his sister Kathy delivering a speech on his behalf. Members of the 1985 Bears traveled to his home to share the celebration with him.

==Professional wrestling career==
===World Wrestling Federation (1995)===
After the end of his NFL career, he appeared at ringside in the WWF for Lawrence Taylor at WrestleMania XI on April 2, 1995, in Hartford, Connecticut. Taylor was wrestling Bam Bam Bigelow and there were several football players at ringside to keep wrestlers from interfering in the match. During the March 20 episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, McMichael provided guest commentary with Vince McMahon and would later brawl with Kama Mustafa, one of Bigelow&#x27;s comrades. The fight was all over the arena floor and almost into the stands, knocking over the broadcast table, soon being broken up by personnel. Taylor ended up winning the later match.

===World Championship Wrestling (1995–1999)===
==== Color commentator (1995–1996) ====
In 1995, McMichael was hired by World Championship Wrestling (WCW). On September 4, 1995, he made his debut with the company as the pro-babyface color commentator on the premiere of &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot;, with Bobby Heenan fulfilling his typical pro-heel commentator role alongside lead broadcaster Eric Bischoff. McMichael would root for the popular wrestlers during matches, would bicker with Heenan on a regular basis, and brought his dog Pepe with him to the broadcast booth.

==== The Four Horsemen (1996–1997) ====

In April 1996, Ric Flair started hitting on McMichael&#x27;s wife Debra, who would sit at ringside during &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot;. McMichael challenged Flair and Arn Anderson to a match with his partner Kevin Greene. He trained with Randy Savage (he was actually trained by Terry Taylor at the WCW Power Plant), while Flair and Anderson got Heenan to be their coach for the match.

The match took place at The Great American Bash. During the match, Debra and Greene&#x27;s wife were chased to the back by Woman and Miss Elizabeth, who were Flair&#x27;s valets. Debra came back with Woman and Elizabeth, and she had a briefcase full of money and a Four Horsemen T-shirt. McMichael accepted it and hit Greene in the head with the briefcase. McMichael&#x27;s first singles match was against Joe Gomez at Bash at the Beach.

He went on to feud with the Dungeon of Doom with the other Horsemen, and he had problems with Jeff Jarrett over the affections of Debra in late 1996 through early 1997. Woman would trash Debra, causing McMichael and Chris Benoit to step in each time. The turning point in the McMichael–Jarrett feud was at SuperBrawl VII. McMichael wrestled Jarrett, and if Jarrett won, he was an official Horseman. Debra interfered for Jarrett, so he would win. Then McMichael and Jarrett had to team, and they bickered at first but later became a solid tag team. McMichael wrestled two football players in 1997. He beat Reggie White at Slamboree and lost to Kevin Greene at The Great American Bash, which saw McMichael slapped by Greene&#x27;s mother at ringside.

In July 1997, Jarrett was kicked out of the Horsemen, and Debra soon left McMichael for Jarrett. McMichael got his revenge when he defeated Jarrett for his WCW United States Heavyweight Championship on the August 21 episode of &quot;Clash of the Champions XXXV&quot;. Just weeks earlier, Arn Anderson had been forced to retire due to an injury, and Curt Hennig took his place in the Horsemen. At Fall Brawl, Hennig turned on the Horsemen and joined the nWo, during the War Games match that the Horsemen were involved in. McMichael was handcuffed to the steel cage surrounding the ring along with Benoit, and neither man could defend Flair from the 5-on-1 assault from the nWo; the match ended after McMichael surrendered to stop the nWo from attacking Flair, although Hennig would still slam the cage door on Flair&#x27;s head (which was edited out of the home video release, but included on the WWE Network in full), even after the submission was made. The next night on &quot;Nitro&quot;, McMichael dropped his United States title to Hennig, and Flair disbanded the Horsemen.

==== Various rivalries and departure (1997–1999) ====
McMichael went after Debra&#x27;s stable of wrestlers that included Jarrett, Eddie Guerrero and Alex Wright. Debra hired Goldberg to get McMichael, and he became one of Goldberg&#x27;s first victims in November 1997. Goldberg stole McMichael&#x27;s Super Bowl ring and weeks later McMichael hit Goldberg with a pipe and reclaimed it. He briefly helped Benoit feud with Raven&#x27;s Flock in January 1998 and then got into a feud with The British Bulldog, in which he broke his hand during a match at SuperBrawl VIII in February 1998. McMichael returned in June and had a feud with Stevie Ray and helped reform the Four Horsemen in October with Flair, Benoit, Dean Malenko and manager Arn Anderson. They feuded with the nWo until McMichael made his final TV appearance on the February 8, 1999, episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;. His last match was on March 6, 1999 teaming with Chris Benoit and Dean Malenko defeating Curt Hennig, Barry Windham and Wrath on a house show.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2008)===
McMichael returned to professional wrestling for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling&#x27;s flagship pay-per-view, Bound For Glory, where he refereed the Monster&#x27;s Ball Match. This match was notable for McMichael&#x27;s extremely slow cadence for a three count.

==Other endeavors==

McMichael co-hosted a Bears pre-game show with Jeff Dickerson on ESPN 1000 in Chicago. He was the head coach of the Chicago Slaughter of the Indoor Football League from 2007 until the team&#x27;s final season in 2013.

McMichael and fellow 1985 Chicago Bears alumni Dan Hampton and Otis Wilson performed in a rock and roll oldies band (with entertaining satirical Mike Ditka verses) called the Chicago 6.

On August 7, 2001, during the seventh-inning stretch of a game between the Chicago Cubs and the Colorado Rockies at Wrigley Field, McMichael, who was visiting the Cubs television booth, took a turn as the guest singer for &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot;. Earlier in the game in the bottom of the 6th inning, home plate umpire Ángel Hernández had controversially called Cubs infielder Ron Coomer out at the plate. Before singing Take Me Out to the Ball Game, McMichael announced to those in attendance over the PA system that he would &quot;have some speaks&quot; with Hernández after the game, presumably as a result of Hernández&#x27;s call on Coomer. Crew chief Randy Marsh ordered McMichael to be ejected from the ballpark, and the umpires later received an apology for McMichael&#x27;s conduct from then-Cubs general manager Andy MacPhail.

On August 16, 2012, McMichael announced his intentions to run for mayor of Romeoville, Illinois. He lost the race to incumbent John Noak, garnering 39 percent of the vote.

==Personal life==

In 1985, McMichael married Debra Marshall. They divorced in 1998.

McMichael married Misty Davenport on March 24, 2001. Their daughter, Macy Dale, was born in 2008.

On April 23, 2021, McMichael announced that he was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

The Les Turner ALS Foundation awarded McMichael with the ALS Courage Award on September 18, 2021.

<text>Coleford is a village and civil parish in Somerset, England, situated on the Mells River in the Mendip Hills five miles west of Frome. The parish has a population of 2,313 in 2011.

==History==

Coleford was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Colford&quot;, meaning &quot;the hill ford&quot;, possibly from the Old French &quot;col&quot; and &quot;ford&quot;, or alternatively &quot;the coal ford&quot;, a ford over which charcoal was carried.

There are visible remains of a famous unfinished engineering project, the Dorset and Somerset Canal aqueduct, known locally as the &#x27;Huckyduck&#x27;, which was abandoned in 1803.

The village once had several coal mines as part of the now closed Somerset coalfield. Just north of Coleford there were the collieries of Newbury and Mackintosh. Mackintosh opened in 1867 but closed in 1919, due to flooding. The Natural Stone Products factory is built on the site of Newbury Colliery. This pit started around the beginning of the 19th century and closed in 1927. The Coal Barton mine was the scene of a firedamp explosion which killed nine miners in 1869.

==Governance==

The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council&#x27;s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.

The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Frome Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.

Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.

The village falls within the &#x27;Coleford and Holcombe&#x27; electoral Ward. The ward stretches in the east from &quot;Coleford&quot; before going west to Holcombe and then south west to Stoke St. Michael. Mells is also included.
The total ward population as at the 2011 census was 4,700.

It is also part of the Frome and East Somerset county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and was part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020, which elected seven MEPs using the d&#x27;Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.

==Religious sites==

The Anglican Parish Church of The Holy Trinity was built in 1831 by J. Sperring. The Methodist Chapel is a little more recent having been built in 1865.

<doc id="1316668" wikidata="Q7309207" url="?curid=1316668" title="Regional development agency">
<text>In the United Kingdom, regional development agencies (RDAs) were nine non-departmental public bodies established for the purpose of development, primarily economic, of England&#x27;s Government Office regions between 1998 and 2010. There was one RDA for each of the NUTS level 1 regions of England. Similar activities were carried out in Wales by the Welsh Government Department of Economy and Transport, in Northern Ireland by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and in Scotland by Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise.

In June 2010 the UK government announced the abolition of the RDAs which took place on 31 March 2012, with a view to reducing the government deficit; similar economic development would be undertaken by local councils and local enterprise partnerships (LEPs). There was no direct replacement for the RDAs as LEPs did not at first receive funding from central government, and local councils did not receive an equivalent injection of income from central funds, having been called upon to make savings and support similar initiatives.

==Background==

Regional development had been a concern of UK policymakers, particularly on the Left, since at least the 1970s. After Labour came to power in the 1997 election, eight RDAs were created on 25 November 1998 following the passing of the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998 (c. 45). In subsequent years their scope and powers were enhanced, and a ninth agency, for London, was established in July 2000. The statutory objectives of the RDAs were:
# to further economic development and regeneration;
# to promote business efficiency and competitiveness;
# to promote employment;
# to enhance the development and application of skills relevant to employment, and
# to contribute to sustainable development.

They took over responsibility from Government Offices for administering European Union regional development funds.

==Funding==
The RDAs were funded from HM Treasury via six central government departments:
*Department for Business, Innovation and Skills
*Department for Communities and Local Government
*Department for Energy and Climate Change
*Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
*Department for Culture, Media and Sport
*UK Trade and Investment

The funding from these departments was pooled, and then allocated to each of the RDAs based on several factors, such as the percentage of people living in deprived areas within the RDA catchment area and the unemployment rate. The total funding, known as the &#x27;Single Pot&#x27;, was:
*2006/2007 – £2.244 billion
*2007/2008 – £2.297 billion
*2008/2009 – £2.193 billion
*2009/2010 – £2.260 billion
*2010/2011 – £1.760 billion

In 2009 a study by accountants PriceWaterhouseCoopers showed that RDAs were generating £1 for the local economy for every £1 of public spending, though this figure was estimated to rise to £4.50 when long-term investments in infrastructure matured.

==Structure==
Eight of the nine RDAs reported to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), the exception being the London Development Agency (LDA), which reported directly to the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.

Each RDA was led by a chair and a board of 15 people, appointed by BIS ministers (except in London, where the mayor appointed). The RDA chairs were all business people, while the boards were made up of representatives of business, local government, trade unions and voluntary organisations.

The day-to-day running of the RDA was the responsibility of the Chief Executive who was appointed by the board, subject to approval by BIS ministers (or the London Mayor in the case of the LDA).

==Operation==
The objectives of the RDAs were set out in the Regional Economic Strategy (RES) of each region. The RES was a document created and maintained by the RDA for the whole region, i.e. it was not simply a document to guide the RDA, it was intended to guide the work of other organisations also. Each RDA updated their RES on a regular basis (approximately every three years) by consulting widely with their partners, and stakeholders in the region, including local government, voluntary organisations, private organisations, and other interested groups. The RES was submitted to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills for formal approval.

The RDAs sought to achieve their objectives in a variety of ways. The most obvious of these was by funding projects aimed at addressing them, either directly from the RDA, or indirectly through a funded body. Secondly, they sought to influence other stakeholders in the region to take action themselves. Thirdly, they sought to influence the policies of central government where they might impact on the region.

The RDAs worked together in a number of areas, with different RDAs taking the &#x27;lead&#x27; role in varying policy areas. Additionally, the RDAs jointly funded a central secretariat to co-ordinate this activity. Finally, the three northern RDAs (Northwest Regional Development Agency, Yorkshire Forward and One NorthEast) collaborated on The Northern Way.

Each RDA had a science and industry council (SIC) made up of business, university and public sector experts. Each SIC advised its RDA on science and innovation investments. Each region had a slightly different focus, but all SICs contributed to the national &quot;Technology Strategy&quot; (owned by the Technology Strategy Board). This was done via a strategic advisory group on which the chairs of each science and industry council sat.

==Abolition and replacement==
Following the June 2010 &quot;emergency&quot; budget, the coalition government announced its intention to replace the RDAs by smaller-scale partnerships between local authorities and businesses, known as local enterprise partnerships (LEPs). The RDAs were abolished on 31 March 2012. The RDA for the South West became Regen, a not-for-profit focused on accelerating the transition to clean energy

==List==

<text>Retrospective determinism is the informal fallacy that because something happened under some circumstances, it was therefore bound to happen due to those circumstances; the term was coined by the French philosopher Henri Bergson. For example:
:&quot;When he declared himself dictator of the Roman Republic, Julius Caesar was bound to be assassinated.&quot;
Were this an argument, it would give no rational grounds on which to conclude that Caesar&#x27;s assassination was the only possible outcome, or even the most likely outcome under the circumstances. This type of fallacy can precede a hasty generalization: because something happened in given circumstances, it was not only bound to happen, but will in fact always happen given those circumstances. For example:
:&quot;Caesar was assassinated when he declared himself dictator. Sic semper tyrannis: this goes to show that all dictators will eventually be assassinated.&quot;
Not only is this irrational, it is factually false.

<doc id="1316684" wikidata="Q11900227" url="?curid=1316684" title="Power distance">
<text>Power distance is the unequal distribution of power between parties, and the level of acceptance of that inequality; whether it is in the family, workplace, or other organizations. 

The concept is used in cultural studies to understand the relationship between individuals with varying power, and the effect this has on society. It was introduced in the 1970s by Geert Hofstede, who outlined a number of cultural theories throughout his work. 

Members within a power network may accept or reject the power distance within an institution&#x27;s cultural framework, and the Power Distance Index (PDI) was created to measure the level of acceptance. It may be low, moderate, or high.

It is theorized that democratic governments occur most commonly among low power distance societies, where unquestionable hierarchies are not ingrained at an early age, as they tend to be in high power distance societies. 

== Origin ==
Geert Hofstede was a Dutch psychologist and professor. He conducted a survey from the 1960s to the 1970s through IBM, a multinational computer manufacturing company, which was the main contribution to his development of the cultural dimensions theory. 

In the study, Hofstede distributed questionnaires to various IBM employees in different countries relating to value differences within the company. He observed different power distance levels and management styles and theorized four cultural dimensions: individualism/collectivism, masculinity/femininity, power distance and uncertainty avoidance. 

Later research led to the discovery of a fifth and sixth dimension. Chinese sociologists identified long term/short term orientation as the fifth and a replica of Hofstede&#x27;s study identified the sixth: indulgence/restraint. These dimensions were described in his popular work, &quot;Culture&#x27;s Consequences.&quot; 

Hofstede created a measurement tool for the power distance dimension. The Power Distance Index (PDI) measures to what degree a country, organization, or institution accepts the distribution of power and authority; it can be high, moderate, or low.

==Development and studies on the theory==

===Hofstede===

====Cultural dimensions theory====
Hofstede developed the cultural dimensions theory, which is widely used as a crucial framework for cross-cultural communication. It is the earliest theory that could be quantified and is used to explain perceived differences between cultures and has been applied extensively in many fields, especially in cross-cultural psychology, international business, and cross-cultural communication. It was driven by the statistical procedure (also called &quot;factor analysis&quot;) to make the development, based on the result of a global survey of the values of IBM employees conducted from 1967 and 1973. Hofstede&#x27;s theory identified six dimensions of culture: power distance, individualism vs collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity vs femininity, short-term vs long-term orientation, and indulgence vs self-restraint.

Research has suggested that power distance can vary from culture to culture, which can be particularly prevalent in international corporations. A study performed by Xiaoshuang Lin &quot;et al.&quot; found that employees are more inclined to speak up under leaders deemed to be humble by their employees. Humility is a trait often associated with low-power distance cultures. The study found that an employee&#x27;s self-conceptualization of power determined not only their workplace voice, but also their superior&#x27;s humility. An environment such as this would also be akin to the collectivism dimension that Hofstede proposed. 

====Power Distance Index (PDI)====
The PDI is designed to measure the extent to which power differs within the society, organization, and institutions is accepted by less powerful members. The index assigns a score to each country that indicates its level of power distance and dependent relationships. The PDI also represents society&#x27;s level of inequality that is defined from below rather than from above. The PDI uses relative values; it is only useful when comparing countries.

Hofstede derived power distance scores for three regions and fifty countries from the answers given by IBM employees in the same type of positions to the same questions. The PDI was calculated by:

1. Preparing three survey questions:
* How frequently, in the employees&#x27; experience, were they afraid to express disagreement with their managers? (mean score on a 1–5 scale from &quot;very frequently&quot; to &quot;very seldom&quot;)
* Subordinates&#x27; perception of their boss&#x27;s actual decision-making style (percentage choosing either the description of an autocratic or of a paternalistic style, out of four possible styles plus &quot;none of these alternatives&quot;)
* Subordinates&#x27; preference for their boss&#x27;s decision-making style (percentage preferring an autocratic or a paternalistic style, or, as type based on majority vote, but not a consultative style)
2. Pre-coding the answers to be represented as numbers (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4...)

3. Computing the mean score for the answers of equal samples of people from each country or percentage that chose particular answers

4. Sorting the questions into groups—known as clusters or factors—by using a statistical procedure

5. Adding or subtracting the three scores after multiplying each with a fixed number

6. Adding another fixed number

Hofstede found that the emotional distance is relatively small in lower PDI cultures. There are more democratic or consultative relations between expecting and accepting power. People are relatively interdependent to the power holders, and there is a relatively low inequality of power distributed among the people. Under these circumstances, the decentralized authority and flat management structure is common but not universal, which suggests that managers and subordinates will, on average, be relatively less concerned with status, and the distribution of decision-making responsibility is extensive. Policies like the &quot;open door&quot; policy are implemented more often, which influence higher-ranking individuals to be more receptive to lower-ranking individuals, and subordinates to be more likely to challenge or give suggestions to their superiors. Examples of countries with low PDIs include the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, and the Nordic countries.

In higher PDI cultures, the power relations are paternalistic and autocratic, and centralized authority exists; there is a wide gap or emotional distance which is perceived to exist among people at different levels of the hierarchy. There is considerable dependence (also known as counter-dependence) on individuals who hold power. In the workplace, subordinates are willing to accept their inferior positions, and superiors may not ask for broad participation in the decision-making process. Higher PDI cultures usually adopt an autocratic leadership style, which means subordinates may be unlikely to approach and contradict their bosses directly. Countries with high power distance cultures usually believe that there is nothing wrong with inequality and everyone has specific positions. China, Belgium, France, Malaysia, and the Arab world are regarded as examples of countries or regions with high PDI cultures.

Hofstede&#x27;s study is limited by two factors: neutralization and analyzing non-Western countries with a Western methodology. Each stage of the research process makes the unneutral seem neutral. The questionnaire reflects a large power distance: its questions were explicitly designed to resolve the normative concerns of researchers; it primarily served the concerns of those who needed to do comparative analysis and created it through &quot;coercing a culturally distinct axis of comparison&quot; on a variety of employees. Additionally, the questionnaire adopted a Western methodology to analyze non-Western countries and was relatively selective in representing the inequality within Western countries. For example, the PDI concentrated on the boss and subordinate relationship, which could be seen as biased, as it ignores other forms of western inequality. Apparently, the questions failed to measure the racial, colonial, and broader class inequalities that should be taken into account when measuring power distance.

===Haire, Ghiselli, and Porter===
Mason Haire, Edwin Ghiselli, and Lyman Porter explored the differences in preferences for power among different cultures with remarkable outcomes, without yet mentioning the concept of power distance. They conducted their study with a questionnaire, which was based on a modified version of Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs. The aim of the questionnaire was to evaluate how managers from 14 countries were satisfied regarding their needs when they were in their current positions. The dimensions that were linked to power distance across cultures in their questionnaire were autonomy and self-actualization.

In accordance with the responses to the questions in their questionnaire, the 14 countries were clustered into five main groups, which Haire &quot;et al.&quot; labeled Nordic-European (Denmark, Germany, Norway, and Sweden), Latin-European (Belgium, France, Italy, and Spain), Anglo-American (England and the United States), Developing (Argentina, Chile, and India), and Japan. The analysis used various mean standardized scores that the five groups presented with respect to autonomy and self-actualization; positive figures described greater satisfaction of need than for the average manager across all 14 countries, while negative figures described lesser satisfaction.
=== Mulder ===
Another major study of power distance was done by Mauk Mulder. It was based on the premise that as societies become weaker in power distance, the underprivileged will tend to reject their power dependency. Mulder&#x27;s laboratory experiments in the social and organizational context of the Netherlands, a low power distance culture, concluded that people attempted to seek &quot;power distance reduction&quot;. He found that:
* More privileged individuals tend to try to preserve or to broaden their power distance from subordinates.
* The larger their power distance is from a subordinate, the more the power holder tends to try to increase that distance.
* Less powerful individuals try to decrease the power distance between themselves and their superiors.
* The smaller the power distance, the more likely it is that less powerful individuals will try to reduce that distance.

===After Hofstede – the GLOBE Study===
Following Hofstede, the Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness (GLOBE) project defined &quot;power distance&quot; as &quot;the degree to which members of an organization or society expect and agree that power should be shared unequally&quot;. Power distance was further analyzed as one of the nine cultural dimensions explained in the GLOBE Research Program, which was conceived in 1990 by Robert J. House of the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania.

Given the premise that leader effectiveness is contextual, the research was conducted by believing that the social and organizational values, norms and beliefs of those who are being led are closely connected to the effectiveness of the leader. GLOBE measures the practices and values that exist at the levels of industry (financial services, food processing, telecommunications), organization (several in each industry), and society (62 cultures). The results are presented in the form of quantitative data based on responses from about 17,000 managers from 951 organizations functioning in 62 societies throughout the world, which shows how each of the 62 societies scores on nine major attributes of cultures, including Power Distance, and six major global leader behaviors.

Regarding power distance, GLOBE researches cultural influences on power distance values, practices and other aspects, including &quot;Roots of Power Distance&quot;, &quot;The Psychological Stream and Power&quot;, and &quot;The Cross-Cultural Stream and Power Distance&quot;. It also investigates how family power values are taught and makes a comparison of high versus low power distance societies.

When discussing &quot;The Cross-Cultural Stream and Power Distance&quot;, four primary factors affecting a society&#x27;s level of power distance are explained separately: the predominant religion or philosophy, the tradition of democratic principles of government, the existence of a strong middle class, and the proportion of immigrants in a society&#x27;s population. Connections exist among the four fundamental phenomena, but the study concluded that a society&#x27;s main beliefs, values, and religion, will have the strongest and longest lasting influence on power distance, which would be moderated by a democratic tradition and the existence of a strong middle class to some extent. Both factors are expected to narrow power distance. Finally, a large proportion of immigrants in a given society makes the low power distance trend stronger in all circumstances presented above. The study also concludes that regardless of religion, any society that does not have a tradition of democracy or a significant middle class will have a substantially high power distance levels.

==Applications and effects==
Power distance is a significant dimension in cross-cultural environments that it unconsciously influences people&#x27;s behavior in different countries, which contributes to so-called &quot;cultural norms&quot;, which are shaped by perceptions and acceptance of power inequality to a certain degree. These &quot;cultural norms&quot; lead to various reactions when facing same situations or in the same environment. However, there are some consequences that result from acquiescence in inequality in organizations and societies, especially for high power distance countries.

===The workplace===

====Effects on management style====
In organizations with high power distance, employees acknowledge their lesser standing, and are respectful and submissive towards their superiors, who in turn are more likely to give orders rather than consult with their employees while making decisions. Status symbols are often displayed and flaunted. Employers or managers would not have meals together with their subordinates, and might have private facilities such as rooms, parking lots, or elevators. Having a high level of education is important to climb the corporate ladder, and the higher-ranking members of the organization are often paid much more than their subordinates when compared with companies with lower power distance.

In low power distance organizations, superiors are not as concerned with status symbols and would be more open to employee discussion and participation. Employees are less submissive to their superiors, and are more likely to make themselves heard or to challenge the management.

==== The relationship between leadership and voice behavior ====
The ability for employees to speak up is described as their voice behavior and expression, which is dependent upon the leadership style as well as the power distance. Sheng-Min Liu and Jian-Qiao Liao developed a questionnaire that asked 495 subordinates (engineers) and 164 leaders (senior engineers and project managers) to determine the outcome of subordinate voice behavior based on the leadership style, which is influenced by power distance because of the closeness in proximity and structure of those cultures. The study finds that low power distance leaders facilitate a change-oriented environment for subordinates to discuss their ideas and concerns which leads to their admiration.

The study finds that in high power distance businesses, subordinates obey the gap between them and their leaders, and rarely interact with their superiors. The study further confirms that the ideas and solutions in this power index are given to them by their leaders, so it seems contradictory for those in the high-power distance to speak up about their concerns or ideas because they are accustomed to direction. The contradiction of the high-power index shows that it weakens the leader–subordinate relationship causing a lack of expression. Thus, voice behavior and expression rely on the transformational leadership style often seen in low power distance cultures. The study concludes that the leadership style which is based on power distance culture correlates with the tools given to an employee to speak up in his or her environment.

====Effects on employee behavior ====
In business, power distance can be defined as the acceptance (by employees) of the relationship between the highest and lowest ranked members in an organization. Studies have suggested that employees in low power distance workplaces directly impact the distribution of office power. This could be due in part to the employees possessing more power (and therefore, more freedom to make changes) than in a high-power distance setting. In addition, the opposite has been suggested for employees in high power distance environments, with superiors not varying much in their position. Culture can have an effect on this, as lower-level employees in high power distance cultures may be unable to have a large impact on their workplace.

In high power distance regions, people in higher positions hold great amounts of power with little challenge. The hierarchy and authority empower employers and supervisors with more rights of resource allocation, rewards, and punishment, which reinforce their status and enable them to lead and guide their subordinates autocratically. The hierarchical differentiation between the top and the bottom gradually creates an invisible gap in the workplace, where subordinates tend to build greater sensitivity and cautiousness when communicating with their supervisors.

It is a common phenomenon that junior employees turn to their seniors for help and advice when getting into a new environment. Yet, some researchers recently attested that employees and junior staff from high power distance countries are less likely to seek help from their supervisors. One of the reasons is that lower ranking staff have few chances and little time to meet the high ranking managers in person, as subordinates are usually only able to reach their immediate supervisors. It is also widely believed that subordinates asking for help equates to incompetence or a lack of ability, which subdues themselves into unfavorable circumstances. Some supervisors who are incapable of solving more complicated problems will become suspicious of their subordinates, regard the problems as a challenge to their status and capabilities, or even as humiliation from the lower ranking staff. Such climates have gradually reinforced employees to think that it is more effective and efficient to deal with difficulties by themselves, rather than talking to their managers.

In a high power distance environment, supervisors tend to pay more attention on tasks instead of employees, who are the main focus for supervisors in a low power distance environment. Apparently, task orientation emphasizes heavily on daily work completion and performance efficiency, yet the top-bottom relationship grows far more slowly since there is a lack of communication beyond work, which in turn reduces subordinates&#x27; willingness of seeking help from supervisors. Compared to low power distance countries, equality is embraced by the society that power is minimized to a large extent, where authority and hierarchy are not highlighted and supervisors are accessible and willing to build close relationship with subordinates, whose worries of any harm are turned down when seeking help from the top.

The beliefs employees hold regarding procedural justice—defined as the level of fair treatment by the superiors in the organization toward the employees—shape the nature of their relationships with authority. Fair treatment in the workplace is incumbent upon three established criteria: gender, trust amongst authority, and the psychological contract fulfillment—the employee&#x27;s idea of receiving the benefits promised by the workplace. Employee perception of procedural justice is affected by power distance and gender. In low power distance cultures employees are more likely to have a strong personal connection and a better understanding of the authority they are dealing with. Negative behavior in a low power distance culture increases when organizations treat them poorly because they lack the characteristics of submitting humbly before authority. Therefore, the relationship between employees and superiors are outlined by procedural justice and trust in authority in low power distance cultures. In contrast, employees in high power distance cultures are less likely to be themselves around authority; They are also less sensitive to insulting remarks, and more likely to accept an erroneous action from authority without consideration of fair treatment (procedural justice). For both low and high power distance cultures, they perceived fair treatment to be a fulfillment of the psychological contract made by the organization.

===In charitable behavior===
According to research, people from high power distance countries are generally less responsible towards charitable behaviors than people from low power distance countries. The explanation for this phenomenon is that the rooted perception and acceptance of inequality somehow dampens their sensitivity to any unfair or inappropriate situations, which they may consider as a normal social circumstance and simply accept it rather than making a change. Cumulatively, the more inequality they accept, the less unconformity they will notice, and the less responsibilities they will eventually take. The consequence is high power distance enlarging the gap between human beings in terms of relations and wealth conditions. Conversely, people in low power distance countries are more sensitive towards any unequal phenomena, and their in-acceptance of dissonance endows them with a greater sense of responsibility for adjusting or correcting the problems in person.

====Influence of controllable/uncontrollable needs====
The types of needs influence people&#x27;s charitable behavior regardless of their power distance backgrounds. The needs generated are classified into controllable and uncontrollable categories, where the occurrence of the former is due to a lack of effort, while the latter occurs from unforeseeable events such as natural disasters. The ability of whether individuals are able to control the situations affects how they will react to the rising needs.

The level of power distance influences a society&#x27;s reaction towards controllable needs. People with high power distance backgrounds perceive most of the issues as rightful inequality, and are reluctant to get themselves involved with &quot;troubles&quot;, and usually ignore them. Conversely, low power distance societies are intolerant with unfairness and are more likely to make an effort in eliminating dissonance in every possibility.

People tend to be more responsive and willing to assist when others suffer from uncontrollable circumstances. It is assumed that people consider that the aid for uncontrollable needs will not greatly change societal rightful inequality, and hence generous assistance and help will be offered to those in need regardless of power distance background. In such circumstances, a sense of duty is more likely to be raised, where people tend to undertake charitable behaviors.

====Influence of communal/exchange relationship norms====
The relationship norms behind the needs also affect the sense of responsibility. The types of relationships are mainly classified as exchange relationships, in which people are expecting a reasonable privilege or benefit in return for offering aid; and communal relationships, where those giving assistance are wholeheartedly and generously taking care of those in need without any expectation of reciprocation. According to research, people are more likely to refuse to aid when encountering needs associated with exchange relationships rather than needs with communal relationships. As such, Karen Page Winterich and Yinlong Zhang recommended that charitable organizations in high power distance countries should stress the significance of uncontrollable needs or salient communal relationship norms, through which the populace are more easily motivated to make a difference on social inequality.

==Examples of high and low power distance cultures and their effects==
Power distance affects cultures all over the world and the interactions different cultures have with each other.

Malaysia is a country that scores high on the PDI. Due to high power distance, it is a culture where one may not question someone in power like a manager, a professor, or a government official, because authority is valued and power is not equally distributed. When this country is compared to the United States, a country that scores lower on the Power Distance Index, there are many differences one may come across. The United States, having moderate power distance, allows a person to question a professor or give ideas to a boss.

Due to many changes and advances in today&#x27;s world, some organizations have expanded globally and send workers from country to country or students abroad. If an American manager travels to Malaysia to manage a company, they will run into situations that would be surprising to them. The American manager may ask the workers for their opinions on how to do something or improve something and the Malaysians may just sit still and not speak up because they do not feel as if they have the authority to do so.

Egypt is another country that scores high on the Power Distance Index. Students in this country tend to respect their professors and not question them. The country also has exams that determine whether or not a student can continue studying; by doing this, a level of authority that cannot be surpassed unless done correctly is created. Students from this country when compared to students in Canada, a country that scores lower on the Power Distance Index, cannot question a professor on a grade. Therefore, they would require clear guidelines of what is expected of them in order to succeed. Many international students experience culture shock when they study abroad in the United States, for example. They may be unfamiliar with a variety of things such as the differences in academic writing in America or the informality of certain relationships with &quot;authority figures,&quot; like professors. 

==Individualism/collectivism and power distance==
Different cultures have different views on power distance. Something that is related to and overlaps with power distance is individualism vs. collectivism. Hofstede is the scholar behind both power distance and individualism and collectivism. Hofstede defines collectivism as &quot;...a preference for a tightly knit social framework in which individuals can expect their relatives, clan, or other in-group to look after them, in exchange for unquestioning loyalty&quot; and individualism as &quot;...a preference for a loosely knit social framework in a society in which individuals are supposed to take care of themselves and their immediate families only.&quot; An example of an individualistic country is the United States, as people tend to care more about their own well-being than the good of the whole group. It is contrasted with China, a collectivist country people tend to worry more about the overall well-being of the group and put that at a higher importance than their personal wants or needs. Individualism and collectivism relate to power distance because they influence how a culture behaves in society.

Individualism, collectivism, and power distance can be linked together in different ways. They are typically studied together because overall in scoring, a country&#x27;s PDI score is positively correlated with its degree of collectivism. This is explained as individualistic countries being typically focused on an individual and their desires, where power status has a less significant role, and collectivist countries focusing on the collective good. Hofstede found that individualism, collectivism, and power distance are greatly correlated to a nation&#x27;s wealth. Wealthy countries usually score high for individualism and low on the Power Distance Index, while poorer countries score high for both collectivism and the PDI.

A study conducted by Yuan Feirong and Jing Zhou demonstrates how individualism and collectivism correlate with power distance as well as its impact on creativity in a conceptual model. The model examines the creativity of groups based on group member interactions that occur in face to face meeting or teleconferences, and individual employee contributions to the group. Cultures high on the PDI typically interact and speak less to group members, as they rely heavily on the person with the highest status in the group to determine and make final decisions. Therefore, high power cultures &quot;may not always foster creativity, and can sometimes undermine it. They do not function in actual teams.&quot; Meanwhile, for low power distance cultures it is crucial for each individual to have a say in the overall group function which has proven to increase creativity and develop great innovations, and creativity in groups &quot;highlights the value of group member cognitive diversity&quot;. Power distance influences cultures based on the index creating different environments for group creativity and interactions.

==Linked factors==

===Democracy===
It has been asserted that democratic governments occur most commonly among low power distance societies, where it is not ingrained into the minds of the people since young age that there are unquestionable hierarchies in life that should not be disputed. It has been found that the &quot;ideological breach between labor and conservatives&quot; is polarized in high power distance societies, while in low power distance cultures, people tend to try to attain balance between the two extremes in order to avoid damaging and draining conflicts.

<doc id="1316691" wikidata="Q1012573" url="?curid=1316691" title="Tsing Yi South Bridge">
<text>Tsing Yi South Bridge, opened as the Tsing Yi Bridge on 28 February 1974, was the first bridge to Tsing Yi, Hong Kong. It spans the Rambler Channel, linking Tsing Yi Island to the former Pillar Island, Kwai Chung. The bridge spans 610 metres (about 2,000 feet) and is 26 metres (85 feet) high. It contributed significantly to the development of Tsing Yi, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s. It is the only bridge across the channel which may be used by cycles (the other bridges are either expressways or have signs prohibiting them) and so is the only route connecting Tsing Yi and the Tsuen Wan/Kwai Chung area for cyclists. The name &quot;Tsing Yi South Bridge&quot; was adopted following the 1987 opening of the second bridge to Tsing Yi, the Tsing Yi North Bridge.

==History==
The bridge was built by Tsing Yi Bridge Company Limited (), a joint venture of six Hong Kong companies on the island, namely, China Light and Power, Hongkong Cement, International Containers, Mobil Oil, Gulf Oil, and Standard Oil. In 1970, they budgeted HK$18 million to build the bridge, while the Hong Kong Government contributed $7.5 million to the road connections.

The government granted a licence for construction of the bridge on 18 May 1971. The contractor was Gammon Construction and the engineers were W.V. Zinn and Associates.

Completed in February 1974, the bridge finally cost HK$21 million. It was opened on 28 February 1974 by Sir Murray MacLehose, the Governor of Hong Kong. Upon completion, the bridge was given to Hong Kong Government and the government built roads to link up various areas on the island. Originally, only vehicles displaying a permit issued by the Commissioner of Transport were allowed to use the bridge. Private cars were allowed free access to the bridge from 1 May 1976.

Until the 1987 opening of the Tsing Yi North Bridge, Tsing Yi Bridge was the only fixed link to mainland Hong Kong. It became notorious for traffic congestion, and when the Kwai Chung Port would close for typhoons the bridge would sometimes become blocked by lorries waiting for the port to reopen. Residents became accustomed to having to walk across the bridge when such incidents occurred.

There are two lanes on the bridge. Before the rebuilding, the bridge was two-way; afterwards, two lanes are outward bound, and the Duplicate Tsing Yi Bridge serves inward traffic.

A stone was erected on the Pillar Island end of the bridge in memory of the completion. The stone was moved to the Tsing Yi end to spare space for building the Tsing Yi Doubling Bridge.

==Connection==
Tsing Yi Bridge is connected to Tsing Yi Road and Tsing Yi Heung Sze Wui Road on Tsing Yi Island, and Kwai Tsing Road and Tsing Kwai Highway in Kwai Chung.

==Structure==
Tsing Yi Bridge is formed by 5 levers, identical pairs of arms supported by stands, 18 metres (60 feet) above the water, in the middle, with round-shaped caissons on the seabed.

The arms are made of pre-tensioned concrete. Their cross section is of hollow boxes. There are some power cables and two oil pipes inside the boxes. Both sides of hollow boxes have water pipes for the Tsing Yi Island.

On the bridge, 7 metres (24 feet) width is provided for vehicles with a 1.5 metre (5 foot) wide pedestrian walkway on each side.

The bridge is designed to withstand typhoons, strong waves and accidental collisions by ships.

==Collision==
Ships operating in nearby water and passing through have collided with the bridge several times, and caused minor damage to the bridge. Protection islands are built on the channel to avoid further accidents. Warning signs have been erected reminding that only ships under 17 metres are allowed to sail through the channel. Ships are prohibited from staying or operating near the bridge.

==Aging and renovation==
Tsing Yi Bridge once was the sole connection of the Tsing Yi island to the rest of Hong Kong. As residential population grew, the bridge loading was exceeded. The two lanes become a traffic bottleneck and serious traffic congestion ensued.
Heavy overloading, with dramatic increases in heavy vehicle traffic, made the bridge age quickly and the gap edge bent downward. Though later Tsing Yi North Bridge was built thus alleviating the congestion a bit, and the bridge was closed once in 1989 (after the opening of the North bridge) for renovation, the safety of the bridge was still a major concern. Finally, a rescue plan was implemented. A new bridge, Duplicate Tsing Yi Bridge, was built alongside to at first to replace Tsing Yi Bridge temporarily while Tsing Yi Bridge was closed for fixing in 2000. Some tensioned steel cables replaced the aging cables inside the bridge to straighten out the bent parts. After the project completed, the Tsing Yi Bridge, together with its &#x27;new&#x27; brother, served the island again.

==Celebration==
On the 10th birthday of the bridge, a carnival was held on the football field, near Chan Lai So Chun Memorial School, of Cheung Ching Estate on the Tsing Yi Island.

<text>Janusz Radziwiłł (; 2 July 1579 – 3 December 1620) was a noble and magnate of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. He was the deputy cup-bearer of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania since 1599, the castellan of Vilnius since 1619, and the starost of Borysów. Radziwiłł also held the title of &quot;Reichsfürst&quot; (Imperial Prince) of the Holy Roman Empire.

He married Zofia Olelkowicz Słucka on 1 October 1600. She died in 1612, and was canonized by the Belarusian Orthodox Church as saint &quot;Sofia of Slutsk&quot; thanks to her charity and miracles on the grave. Zofia&#x27;s large estate (seven castles and palaces and some thirty-two villages) contributed to the already significant Radziwłł&#x27;s wealth. His second marriage was to Elisabeth Sophia of Brandenburg, daughter of John George, Elector of Brandenburg, on 27 March 1613 in Berlin.

It was during Radziwiłł&#x27;s life that the interests between his family and the Polish Crown began to drift apart, as the Radziwiłłs sought to increase their wealth and power, safeguard Protestantism and support ethnically Lithuanian culture.

In 1606 he joined the opposition against King Sigismund III Vasa and became one of the leaders of the Zebrzydowski&#x27;s Rokosz. This &quot;confederatio&quot;, an armed and legal rebellion, was aimed at weakening the king.

Janusz Radziwiłł is one of the characters on the painting by Jan Matejko: &quot;Kazanie Skargi&quot; (The Sermon of Piotr Skarga).

<doc id="1316701" wikidata="Q201106" url="?curid=1316701" title="Grey-headed woodpecker">
<text>The grey-headed woodpecker (Picus canus), also known as the grey-faced woodpecker, is a Eurasian member of the woodpecker family, Picidae. Along with the more commonly found European green woodpecker and the Iberian green woodpecker, it is one of three closely related species found in Europe. Its distribution also stretches across large parts of the central and Eastern Palaearctic, all the way to the Pacific Ocean and south to the Himalaya and the Malay Peninsula.

The grey-headed woodpecker is more demanding than the European green woodpecker in terms of its habitat. It prefers deciduous forest with a high proportion of dead trees, feeding primarily on ants, although not being as exclusively dependent on this group as the green woodpecker. The grey-headed woodpecker&#x27;s nest is typically excavated into dead or severely damaged trees.

In the majority of areas for which population numbers are available, the grey-headed woodpecker is in decline. IUCN&#x27;s &quot;Least Concern&quot; rating is primarily based on the large distribution of the species.

==Taxonomy==
The grey-headed woodpecker was formally described by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1788 in the 13th edition of the &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the current binomial name &quot;Picus canus&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;canus&quot; is the Latin for &quot;grey&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;grey-headed green woodpecker&quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1747 by the English naturalist George Edwards. Edward&#x27;s specimen had come from Norway.

Ten subspecies are recognised; they divide into two groups, a northern group of two subspecies where the nape is grey, and a southeastern group of eight where the nape is black.
;Grey-naped subspecies
* &quot;P. c. canus&quot; Gmelin, JF, 1788 – north and central Europe to west Siberia
* &quot;P. c. jessoensis&quot; Stejneger, 1886 – east Siberia to northeast China, Korea and north Japan (includes &quot;P. c. griseoviridis&quot;)
;Black-naped subspecies
* &quot;P. c. kogo&quot; (Bianchi, 1906) – central China
* &quot;P. c. guerini&quot; (Malherbe, 1849) – north central and east central China
* &quot;P. c. sobrinus&quot; Peters, JL, 1948 – southeast China and northeast Vietnam
* &quot;P. c. tancolo&quot; (Gould, 1863) – Hainan Island (off southeast China) and Taiwan
* &quot;P. c. sordidior&quot; (Rippon, 1906) – southeast Tibet and southwest China to northeast Myanmar
* &quot;P. c. sanguiniceps&quot; Baker, ECS, 1926 – northeast Pakistan to north India and west Nepal
* &quot;P. c. hessei&quot; Gyldenstolpe, 1916 – Nepal and northeast India to Myanmar and Indochina
* &quot;P. c. robinsoni&quot; (Ogilvie-Grant, 1906) – west Malaysia
The eight subspecies with a black nape are treated as a separate species black-naped woodpecker (&quot;Picus guerini&quot;) by some authorities, including the IUCN; as a group, they occur in the southeast of the range, from central China south to the Malay Peninsula and southwest to the Himalaya. As well as having a black nape, they are also darker green to brownish-green on the wings than the two grey naped northern subspecies.

The Sumatran woodpecker (&quot;P. dedemi&quot;) was formerly considered a subspecies of the grey-headed woodpecker, but was split as a distinct species by the IOC in 2021; it differs markedy in the dark red-brown, rather than green, body plumage.

There is evidence for hybridisation between grey-headed and European green woodpeckers. However, these seem extremely rare. It appears that the female partner was invariably a grey-headed woodpecker. Nothing has been reported concerning the fertility of such hybrid offspring. Their plumage more closely resembles grey-headed woodpeckers, but with a red parting on the head, a reddish nape and a brighter iris, while some were conspicuous for their darker colour.

==Description==
The grey-headed woodpecker is in length, has a wingspan of and weighs around . The male of the nominate subspecies has a grey head with a red forecrown. There is a black line across the lores and a narrow black moustache stripe. The back, and wing are green. The breast and underbody are pale grey. The folded primaries are barred brown-black on grey-white. The female lacks the red forecrown but has fine black streaks on the crown. The widely distributed &quot;Picus canus jessoensis&quot; is very similar to the nominate subspecies but is slightly greyer and less green. The Chinese subspecies &quot;Picus canus guerini&quot; has a black nape patch and a greenish underbody. The subspecies &quot;Picus canus hessei&quot; is similar to &quot;P. c. guerini&quot; but is more golden green above and a deeper green below. Specimens of the more widespread of the two Eastern subspecies, &quot;P. c. jessoensis&quot;, are usually a little larger and heavier than individuals from the type locality. On average, it is somewhat smaller and lighter than the European green woodpecker. In the field, this distinction in size is difficult to make. Its size is approximately that of a Eurasian collared dove.

Grey-headed woodpeckers have uniformly olive green upperparts, transitioning across the neck to a light grey, the head being that latter colour. The typical woodpecker markings are small and not particularly conspicuous. It has a grey head with black moustache, and the male has a red crown. It has a shorter neck, slimmer bill and slightly rounder head than the green woodpecker.

===Sounds===

Calls made by the European green woodpecker and grey-headed woodpecker resemble each other. The far-carrying territorial song of the grey-headed woodpecker is more melodic and cleaner than the explosive &quot;laughter&quot; of the green woodpecker. The call series consists of ten to fifteen utterances of declining pitch and gradual slowing. The verse may appear melancholic and &quot;dying&quot;. The territorial song of females is similar, but somewhat quieter, less melodious, but more croaky and often shorter.

Besides these partner-specific vocalisations, aggressive noises can be heard from both sexes, but more often the male. Typical are individual, sharp &quot;kuek&quot; sounds that may, with increasing irritation, be placed in sequence and be continued as &quot;kek&quot;. A single &quot;kuek&quot; may also be a predator warning, as begging nestlings will immediately fall silent if this call is made by either parent. Individual drumming activity by grey-headed woodpeckers can be quite varied, but they drum on more occasions than European green woodpeckers. Drumming frequence can be 20 Hertz, with a &quot;drum roll&quot; lasting up to 40 beats, or two seconds. Both sexes drum, but the female less often than the male, and usually more quietly and shorter. Grey-headed woodpeckers often continue to use the same well-resonating drum sites for years – these can even be at a considerable distance from the nest. Grey-headed woodpeckers often use metal covers on masts and roofs as drumming substrate due to their favourable resonance characteristics.

==Distribution and habitat==
The grey-headed woodpecker is found in wide parts of central, northern and eastern Europe, as well as a wide belt south of the boreal coniferous forests across Asia all the way to the Pacific coast, Sakhalin and Hokkaidō. Its northern limit is at the border between closed coniferous and mixed forest; the southern limit is where tree steppe transitions to treeless shrubby steppe. In East Asia, the species is most differentiated, and south of Manchuria covers the Korean Peninsula, as well as large parts of eastern China, the Himalaya, and the mountain forests of the Malay Peninsula.

In Europe, the nominate subspecies breeds within a wide belt from western France to the Urals. It has settled medium latitudes of Scandinavia as well as central, eastern and southern Europe. In Italy, it is confined to the northernmost areas. There is contradictory information regarding its occurrence in Turkey. Most likely, several hundred pairs breed in Mittelgebirge habitats of the Pontic Mountains. The species is absent from the North German Plain, British Isles, Iberian Peninsula, and Mediterranean islands.

==Behaviour and ecology==

===Breeding===
Grey-headed woodpeckers breed in May and lay five to ten eggs which are brought up by both parents. The young hatch after 15–17 days, and fledge in 24–25 days.

===Food and feeding===

The grey-headed woodpecker is a somewhat less specialised ant hunter than the European green woodpecker. In its foraging strategy it is intermediate between many &quot;Dendrocopos&quot; species on the one hand, and the often ant-specific members of the genus &quot;Picus&quot;. This reduced ant specialisation of the grey-headed woodpecker allows it to be sympatric with European green woodpeckers and even to breed at about 100 metres from them.

Nonetheless, ants and their immatures make up the great bulk of the grey-headed woodpecker&#x27;s diet, particularly in spring and summer. Wood ants of the genus &quot;Formica&quot; as well as members of &quot;Lasius&quot; and Myrmicinae such as &quot;Myrmica&quot; spp. predominate, and with termites, may make up 90% of the diet. Besides those, caterpillars, crickets, bark and wood beetle larvae, flies, spiders and lice are part of the diet. In late autumn and early winter, grey-headed woodpeckers switch to including significant amounts of vegetable matter, such as berries and other fruits, in their diets on a regular basis.

==Conservation status==
The grey-headed woodpecker is difficult to record, as isolated breeding pairs rarely call much. These are therefore easily overlooked, and population records have corresponding gaps. It is probable that European populations, especially at the north-western margin of the range, have receded in numbers and distribution. Since the 1990s, populations seem to be recovering as a result of mild winters. Globally, there is a slight reduction in population numbers, but insufficiently so for an elevated threat status. The species is therefore considered safe.

The observation of stable or slightly increasing populations in Europe may, however, be based solely on greater effort in recording the species. The overall European population is estimated at 180,000 to 320,000 breeding pairs. Key populations are found in European parts of Russia as well as Romania. Germany has around 15,000 pairs, Austria approximately 2,500 and Switzerland about 1,500. There are no summary figures for populations outside Europe.

As the grey-headed woodpecker prefers undisturbed and ancient forests with natural cohort structure as well as riparian forests for breeding, the destruction of such habitat is the greatest threat to the species.

<text>The minister of foreign affairs of the Russian Federation is a high-ranking Russian government official who heads the ministry of foreign affairs of the Russian Federation. The foreign minister is one of the five presidential ministers, along with the ministers of defence, interior, emergencies and justice. Although they are members of the Cabinet, they are directly subordinate to the President.

The foreign minister, like other presidential ministers, is nominated and appointed by the President after consultation with the Federation Council (whereas non-presidential ministers are nominated by the Prime Minister and appointed by the President after approval by the State Duma). The foreign minister is also a permanent member of the Russian Security Council.

<doc id="1316706" wikidata="Q2139980" url="?curid=1316706" title="Dual-mode bus">
<text>A dual-mode bus is a bus that can run independently on power from two different sources, typically electricity from overhead lines like a trolleybus or from batteries like a hybrid bus, alternated with conventional fossil fuel (generally diesel fuel). In contrast to other hybrid buses, dual-mode buses can run forever exclusively on their electric power source (wires). Several of the examples listed below involve the use of dual-mode buses to travel through a tunnel on electric overhead power.

Many modern trolleybuses are equipped with auxiliary propulsion systems, either using a small diesel engine or battery power, allowing movement away from the overhead wires, called &quot;off-wire&quot; movement, but such vehicles are generally not considered to be dual-mode buses if their off-wire capability is very limited. Examples include the fleet of about 300 trolleybuses in San Francisco and the trolleybuses used on a 2005-opened system in Rome, Italy, which are capable of running on battery power only for short distances or short periods of time before needing recharging. The Rome vehicles are powered from overhead trolley wires over most of the 11.5-km route and only use battery power on the 500-metre section closest to the city centre. Dual mode trolleybuses in a number of Chinese cities can operate significant distances (8 to 10 km) off-wire on battery power.

==Examples==

* Beijing, China uses a fleet of over 1,250 dual-mode trolleybuses for its trolleybus network.
* Bergen, Norway features dual-mode MAN-Neoplan buses in the Bergen trolleybus system
* Boston, Massachusetts, USA installed dual-mode Neoplan DMA-460LF buses on the Waterfront portion of its Silver Line in 2005 and removed in 2023. Electric power was required in the exclusive right of way that runs in a tunnel under Fort Point Channel to South Station; diesel power was used to run on city streets and highways, including the Ted Williams Tunnel to Logan Airport
* San Francisco, California MUNI&#x27;s 30 Stockton uses battery power on a short section of the route, and trolleybus power on the rest of it.
* Castellón de la Plana, Spain installed a new trolleybus line that went into operation 25 June 2008. The Irisbus Civis vehicles are optically guided and are capable of switching to diesel engine power for turning in front of the Parque Ribalta.
* Seattle, Washington, USA used 236 dual-mode Breda ETB buses in its downtown bus tunnel from 1990 until late 2004, when the fleet of dual-mode buses were retired, except for 59 converted to electric-only service and were replaced in the tunnel by hybrid diesel-electric buses.
*Shanghai, China uses a fleet of over 300 dual-mode trolleybuses for its network.
* Ploiești, Romania features ex-Lausanne Neoplan N6121 dual-mode buses in the Ploiești trolleybus system.
* São Paulo, Brazil also has a dual bus that operates in the Jabaquara district, in the south zone. One of these is a Superarticulated Bus that operates in the Corredor ABD.
* Gdynia and Lublin, both Poland have the dual-mode buses running as part of their trolleybus networks, in case of Gdynia, their (PKT&#x27;s) duobuses are Solaris Trollinos and Mercedes Citaros (which were converted into trolleybuses in 2012). Both of these types, unlike typical dual-mode buses, are trolleybus and electric bus hybrids.

<text>The Kawasaki GPZ900R (also known as the ZX900A or Ninja 900) is a motorcycle that was manufactured by Kawasaki from 1984 to 2003. It is the earliest member of the Ninja family of sport bikes. The 1984 GPZ900R (or ZX900A-1) was a revolutionary design that became the immediate predecessor of the modern-day sport bike. Developed in secret over six years, it was Kawasaki&#x27;s and the world&#x27;s first 16-valve liquid-cooled inline four-cylinder motorcycle engine.

The 908 cc four-cylinder engine delivered , allowing the bike to reach speeds of , making it the first stock road bike to exceed .

Prior to its design, Kawasaki envisioned producing a sub-liter engine that would be the successor to the Z1. Although its steel frame, 16-inch front and 18-inch rear wheels, air suspension, and anti-dive forks were fairly standard at that time, the narrow, compact engine was mounted lower in the frame, allowing it to take Japanese superbike performance to a new level. Six months after being unveiled to the press in December 1983, dealers entered three works GPZ900R bikes in the Isle of Man Production TT finishing in first and second places.

==Description==
Technical advances included water cooling and 16 valves, allowing additional power, and a frame that used the engine as a stressed member for improved handling and reduced weight, as a result of testing that showed that the standard downtubes carried virtually no weight and could be eliminated. Its top speed gave it the title of the fastest production bike at the time, and standing quarter mile times of 10.976 seconds, or 10.55 seconds recorded by specialist rider Jay &quot;Pee Wee&quot; Gleason. The 1984 GPZ900R was the first Kawasaki bike to be officially marketed (in North America) under the Ninja brand name.

In spite of its performance, the GPZ900R was smooth and rideable in urban traffic, owing to the new suspension and a crankshaft counter-balancer that nearly eliminated secondary vibration. The fairing&#x27;s aerodynamics combined with good overall ergonomics enabled comfortable long-distance riding.

The GPZ1000RX was to be the replacement for the GPZ900R in 1986, but the Ninja 900 continued alongside the GPZ 1000RX. In 1988 the GPZ 1000RX was replaced by the ZX-10, yet still the GPZ900R remained. With the release of the ZZ-R1100 in 1990, the GPZ900R lost its status as Kawasaki&#x27;s flagship model, but continued, with some revisions of the fork, wheels, brakes and airbox, until 1993 in Europe, until 1986 in the US and until 2003 in Japan.

The GPZ900R was featured in the movie &quot;Top Gun&quot;, becoming a cultural icon.

<doc id="1316725" wikidata="Q10836067" url="?curid=1316725" title="Lost Horizons (Lemon Jelly album)">
<text>Lost Horizons is the second studio album from the British electronic duo Lemon Jelly, released on 7 October 2002. Released by XL Recordings and produced by Nick Franglen, the album generated two charting singles in the UK, &quot;Space Walk&quot; and &quot;Nice Weather for Ducks&quot;; the latter has often been called the album&#x27;s stand-out track. The album, which is built around a mix of organic instrumentation and idiosyncratic samples, was met with largely positive reviews by music critics, although it was somewhat criticised due to its near-constant mellowness.

In the United Kingdom, &quot;Lost Horizons&quot; peaked at number 20 on the Official Albums Chart, whereas in the United States, it peaked at number 24 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top Electronic Albums component chart. The album&#x27;s two singles, &quot;Space Walk&quot; and &quot;Nice Weather for Ducks&quot;, were also successful, peaking on the UK Singles Chart, at number 36 and 16 respectively. The album was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize and Brit Award in 2003, and was eventually certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry for shipments exceeding 100,000 copies.

==Music==
&quot;Lost Horizons&quot; opens with &quot;Elements&quot;, which &quot;blends acoustic guitars, flugelhorns, synths, skittering breakbeat rhythms, a folksy harmonica, and ... a falsetto &#x27;doo-doo&#x27; chorus&quot;. Overlaying the music is a voiceover, courtesy of English actor John Standing, that lists the basic &#x27;elements&#x27; that make up the world: earth, metal, water, wood, fire, and (eventually, later in the song) sky. The second track, &quot;Space Walk&quot;, is set to a recording of Ed White&#x27;s 1965 space walk on the Gemini 4 mission. Franglen and Deakin chose to use the sample after listening to an album called &quot;Flight to the Moon&quot; (1969); the two were struck by how moving and emotive many of the tracks were. Deakin later said, &quot;&#x27;One small step&#x27; leaves me cold, because it was so obviously scripted. But the spacewalk… even after hearing it so many times, it&#x27;s so vivid.&quot;

&quot;Ramblin&#x27; Man&quot; features a conversation between an interviewer (the voice of Michael Deakin—uncle of Lemon Jelly&#x27;s Fred Deakin) and &quot;John the Ramblin&#x27; Man&quot; (the voice of Standing), during which he lists various places from around the world, ranging &quot;from small Sussex villages to major world capitals.&quot; When listed in the order in which the locations are narrated, the message &quot;Bagpuss Sees All Things&quot; is spelled out midway through the song (from Brixton at four minutes ten seconds, to San José at four minutes 31 seconds) using the first letter of each location. The band had initially intended to use a sample of Errol Flynn talking about his travels, but since it only included four destinations they compiled a list of 200 places and recorded Standing reading them.

The fourth track, &quot;Return to Patagonia&quot;, features several jazz-inspired elements. It also samples the opening lines to the 1974 film &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; The song &quot;Nice Weather for Ducks&quot; is built around a sample inspired by John Langstaff&#x27;s song &quot;All the Ducks&quot;. This song was based on the popular Dutch children&#x27;s song, &quot;Alle eendjes zwemmen in het water&quot; (translated: &quot;All the ducklings are swimming in the water&quot;). Franglen later said that he and Deakin were drawn to Langstaff&#x27;s recording because it &quot;had a gentle madness to it, slightly unhinged&quot;. The duo had attempted to clear Langstaff&#x27;s version for sampling, but were unable to. In the end, they had Enn Reitel re-record the vocal snippet. Franglen, while noting that Reitel&#x27;s performance was good, said that once the sample was re-recorded, its &quot;edge disappeared&quot;. &quot;Experiment Number 6&quot;, arguably the album&#x27;s darkest track, features a fictional field recording of a doctor documenting the side effects of an unnamed drug administered to a patient; the recording tells how the patient progresses from normalcy, to an &quot;overwhelming sense of well-being and euphoria&quot;, before eventually dying. The album closes with &quot;The Curse of Ka&#x27;Zar&quot;, which features &quot;a two-part harmony chorus and jazzy drum loop&quot;.

==Artwork==
The artwork for &quot;Lost Horizons&quot; was created by bandmember Fred Deakin and his London-based graphic design company Airside. The sleeve features a three-dimensional landscape of a city and countryside: The cover features the landscape during the day, which depicts the countryside as vibrant and the city as dull and grey. Conversely, the interior of the sleeve features the same landscape at nighttime; in this piece, the countryside is dark and the city is illuminated. The cover was designed by Airside member Sam Burford, which Deakin then turned into a computer-generated image.

==Reception==
===Critical reviews===
&quot;Lost Horizons&quot; received mostly positive reviews from music critics, although several critics critiqued the album&#x27;s near-constant mellowness. Stuart Mason of AllMusic called the album &quot;a delightful but slightly faceless blend of lounge pop, subtle beats, found sound, with mellow jazz influences.&quot; A reviewer for Entertainment.ie praised the band for approaching electronica from a new angle, writing, &quot;this London-based duo employ Playschool pianos, acoustic guitars and sprightly beats to create laid-back instrumentals guaranteed to soothe even the most restless of souls. [...] What really marks Lemon Jelly as exciting new talents is their quirky sense of humour, which they use to brighten up their sound with skilful use of nursery rhymes, brass bands and offbeat samples.&quot; Pascal Wyse of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;Everything is approachable and purely crafted, but &quot;Lost Horizons&quot; cheats banality with some choice quirks: Magnificent Seven strings, astronauts chatting, panoramic sound effects.&quot; Chris Dahlen of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; felt that the album was a little too saccharine at times, but that it is &quot;the perfect disc to throw on after your four-disc &quot;Ultrachill Dub Groove Mix&quot; has put the whole party to sleep. It&#x27;s like eight flavors of ribbon candy, beach balls hitting the ground like hail, and a big plastic clown face that blows helium.&quot;

Many reviews singled out &quot;Nice Weather for Ducks&quot; as the album&#x27;s stand-out track. Mason selected the &quot;dreamy, acoustic guitar-based&quot; song as one of the album&#x27;s highlights in his review. Dahlen described it as &quot;the most likeable&quot; on the album, and concluded that it is &quot;a happy-slappy lollipop of a song that nicely sums this record up: Sunny, bright, and vaguely irritating.&quot; Wyse wrote, &quot;When the flugelhorn arrives on &#x27;Nice Weather for Ducks&#x27; it is impossible to believe there is any evil in the world.&quot;

Conversely, several critics felt that &quot;Experiment Number Six&quot; did not fit with the overall mood of the album. Wyse called it a &quot;pool of darkness&quot; that &quot;comes as quite a shock&quot;. Dahlen felt that the song &quot;is the only break in the [album&#x27;s] mood&quot;. While he enjoyed the song&#x27;s concept, calling it &quot;so different and sinister that it&#x27;s more intriguing than the rest of the album&quot;, he felt that it was &quot;annoyingly displaced&quot;. Hermann, on the other hand, called the track &quot;clever&quot; and &quot;spooky&quot; with &quot;music ... so well crafted that [the concept] works&quot;.

===Sales and accolades===
In the UK, the album charted at number 20 on the Albums Chart. In the US, it peaked at number 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Electronic Albums chart. In both cases, it was the first Lemon Jelly album to do so. The album&#x27;s two singles, &quot;Space Walk&quot; and &quot;Nice Weather for Ducks&quot;, also managed to chart on the UK Singles Chart, at number 36 and 16 respectively. Again, this was a first for the band. On 20 December 2002 the album was certified Silver. Almost six months later, on 22 July 2003, it was certified Gold, denoting shipments of over 100,000. In 2003, the album was nominated for a Mercury Music Prize and a Brit Award.

<doc id="1316732" wikidata="Q246437" url="?curid=1316732" title="List of Billboard Hot 100 number ones of 2005">
<text>The &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing singles of the United States. Published by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, the data are compiled by Nielsen SoundScan based collectively on each single&#x27;s weekly physical and digital sales, and airplay. In 2005, there were eight singles that topped the chart in fifty-three issues of the magazine, the second lowest of any year.

During the year, five acts achieved their first US number-one single, either as a lead artist or featured guest: Mario, Olivia, Gwen Stefani, Carrie Underwood, and Chris Brown. Stefani earned her first number-one single in the United States this year, although she had been with band the No Doubt since 1986. Hip hop artist Kanye West gained his first number-one single, &quot;Gold Digger&quot;, as lead artist; West previously had a number-one single with &quot;Slow Jamz&quot;, a 2004 song by rapper Twista. Two acts, Underwood and Brown, scored a number-one debut single this year. Mariah Carey was the only act to have more than one number one song, with her earning two.

Mariah Carey&#x27;s &quot;We Belong Together&quot; is the longest-running single of 2005, topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for 14 non-consecutive weeks. The single is tied with &quot;I Gotta Feeling&quot; by American group The Black Eyed Peas for the longest-running number-one single of the decade. As of 2018, &quot;We Belong Together&quot; was tied for the second longest-running number-one single in the entire Hot 100 era behind Boyz II Men&#x27;s and Carey&#x27;s 1995 single &quot;One Sweet Day&quot;, which spent sixteen weeks at number one. Despite being surpassed by three other songs during the years, &quot;We Belong Together&quot; still is one of the songs with the most weeks spent at number one in the entire Hot 100 history. West&#x27;s &quot;Gold Digger&quot; is the second longest-running, having peaked the chart for 10 consecutive weeks. Other singles with extended chart runs include R&amp;B singer Mario&#x27;s &quot;Let Me Love You&quot;, his best-performing song to date, and rapper 50 Cent&#x27;s &quot;Candy Shop&quot;, each spent nine straight weeks at number one.

Carey is the only artist to have earned two number-one singles in 2005 after &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget About Us&quot; topped the chart in the final calendar issue of &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget About Us&quot; is Carey&#x27;s 17th number-one single, placing her third in the list of acts with most number ones in the United States at the time, behind only The Beatles and Elvis Presley. &quot;We Belong Together&quot; is the best-performing single of the chart year, topping the Top Hot 100 Hits of 2005; this gave Carey her first number-one single in the year-end chart.

<doc id="1316745" wikidata="Q5378344" url="?curid=1316745" title="English Partnerships">
<text>English Partnerships (EP) was the national regeneration agency for England, performing a similar role on a national level to that fulfilled by regional development agencies on a regional level. On 1 December 2008 its powers passed to a successor body, the new Homes and Communities Agency.

It was responsible for land acquisition and assembly and major development projects, alone or in joint partnership with private sector developers. It was particularly active in major regeneration areas such as the Thames Gateway and in expansion areas such as Milton Keynes, where the Deputy Prime Minister (acting as Environment Minister) removed planning from local control and appointed them as the statutory planning authority.

It was a non-departmental public body funded through the Department for Communities and Local Government (CLG), and was previously by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (the predecessor department to CLG).

==Structure==
English Partnerships was legally two entirely independent bodies set up under separate statutes. One was the Commission for New Towns, launched in October 1961, which was responsible for the development corporations established by the New Towns Act 1959.

The other was the Urban Regeneration Agency set up by the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993. The URA originated as the English Industrial Estates Corporation, which was &quot;established in 1936 as North Eastern Trading Estates Ltd to help to alleviate the problems caused by the decline of heavy industries such as shipbuilding and coalmining&quot;

==Successor==
On 17 January 2007 Ruth Kelly, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, announced proposals to bring together the delivery functions of the Housing Corporation, English Partnerships and parts of CLG to form a new unified housing and regeneration agency, the Homes and Communities Agency (initially announced as &quot;Communities England&quot;); this became operational on 1 December 2008.

Baneham reportedly signed up to work on the planned , and in an interview on &quot;The Tommy Tiernan Show&quot; which aired on 12 January 2017, Baneham confirmed that he was in pre-production on Avatar 2, 3, 4 and 5.

At the 16th Visual Effects Society Awards in February 2018, a team of visual effects artists, including Baneham, was recognised for its work on &quot;Avatar: Flight of Passage&quot; - an attraction at Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom. In 2019, he was credited for visual effects work on &quot;&quot;.

In 2023, together with Joe Letteri, Eric Saindon and Daniel Barrett, he won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects at the 95th Academy Awards for his work on &quot;&quot;.

<text>The Institute Of Advanced Motorists Limited, trading as IAM RoadSmart, is a charity based in the United Kingdom, whose objective is to improve car driving standards, motorcycle riding standards, and enhance road safety by using the British police&#x27;s system of car and motorcycle control. The System was devised in 1937 by racing driver Mark Everard Pepys, 6th Earl of Cottenham, to reduce accidents in police pursuits.

Results between those who do and do not pass the IAM test vary in frequency of crashes on the road. 

The IAM was formed in 1956 and has over 77,000 members, all of whom have taken and passed an advanced test in a car, commercial vehicle or on a motorcycle. In 2006, the charity took over the work of the AA Motoring Trust, which had been established in 2002 by The Automobile Association. The charity brought its different activities and programmes together under one umbrella called IAM RoadSmart in 2016.

==History==
The organization was formed in March 1956.

In 2006, two new assessments were introduced: DriveCheck and RideCheck. These checks provide the opportunity to have your driving or riding ability assessed by an IAM observer. DriveCheck and RideCheck are not, however, a test. There is no pass or fail. The IAM later added DriveCheck55, which offers the opportunity for people over the age of 55 to have their driving checked and receive tips from a police Class 1 driver. This was later renamed Mature Driver Review.

At the end of 2006 the organization formed the IAM Motoring Trust and took over the work of the AA Motoring Trust which had been formed by The Automobile Association in 2002.

In 2010, the IAM published &quot;How to be a better cyclist&quot; (the third in the IAM Series, the others being &quot;How to be a better driver&quot; and &quot;How to be a better rider&quot;). However, the organization no longer offers cycling training; this role is undertaken by Bikeability in the UK.

Market research suggested the title &quot;Institute&quot; did not appeal to younger drivers, and the charity rebranded itself as &quot;IAM Roadsmart&quot;. In 2011, reducing the queue for the advanced test itself become a priority due to growing popularity.

The IAM also has a commercial subsidiary that provides occupational driver risk management products and services to the UK business community.

The IAM began a modernization programme in 2015 updating its driving standards and increasing its services. On 4 April 2016, as a result of a rebrand, the charity brought its different activities and programmes together under one umbrella brand called IAM RoadSmart. None of the changes affected its charitable status.

==Structure==
&quot;The Institute of Advanced Motorists Limited&quot; was incorporated on 10 March 1956 as a company limited by guarantee. A separate &quot;Institute of Advanced &quot;Motorcyclists&quot;&quot; was registered in 2006, although it rarely or never features in IAM publications. IAM is privately owned, holding no shares. It is registered as a charitable organisation in Scotland, England, and Wales. Its official purpose is to &quot;improve the standard of driving and the promotion of road traffic safety for the public benefit, in particular by (but not limited to), the operation of an advanced driving test&quot;.

The institute is organized on two levels: there is a head office in Welwyn Garden City (1 Albany Place, Hyde Way, Welwyn Garden City AL7 3BT) and around 180 local groups in the UK. Other groups are in Australia, Bermuda, Hong Kong, Cyprus, Kenya, New Zealand, Portugal and Turkey. Local groups are largely independent, setting their own fees, meeting times and places. Some groups cater for all vehicles, while others may be car or motorcycle-only.

Significant people

Nigel Mansell, a former World Champion in Formula One, became President in 2006. The Chief Executive Officer is Antony Kildare who succeeded Tony Greenidge in February 2022. Tony succeeded Mike Quinton in December 2020. Mike succeeded Sarah Sillars OBE in 2018, who replaced Simon Best in 2015.

Ambassadors

In 2017 IAM RoadSmart had a number of Ambassadors performing various roles for the charity.

Former World Rally Championship winner Paddy Hopkirk was an advocate for the Mature Driver Assessment and later became the charity&#x27;s Mature Driver Ambassador.

David Gallagher was the charities Young Driver Ambassador.

Catie Munnings was the charities Driver Ambassador.

Maria Costello was the charities Rider Ambassador
and Ash Hall was appointed in 2018 as an ambassador for disabled drivers.

The charities ambassadors had varied involvement with the charity. On rare occasions such as a project with the BRDC&#x27;s young racing drivers at Silverstone, they were all present. 

Maria Costello as rider ambassador did about 5 engagements per year with the charity and was mostly active at the charities skills days. Catie Munnings and Ash Hall both attended large PR events but weren&#x27;t hugely active within the charity. David Gallagher was the only paid ambassador and visited IAM Groups, schools, colleges, sixth forms and universities as well as representing the charity at events. Paddy Hopkirk was incredibly generous with his time and represented the charity at his ambassadorial engagements with other organisations such as BMW/MINI, BRDC, Silverstone and other organisations that he dealt with when carrying out business for his company Hopkirks. Paddy also worked very closely with Young Driver Ambassador David Gallagher and together they delivered a co-presentation to groups around the country as well as continue young driver education work once the IAM&#x27;s ambassadorial programme finished.

Today none of these roles are fulfilled by any of these individuals and it seems the ambassadorial programme is no longer active within the charity.

Chairmen

Stuart Donald QPM was elected chair in 2021 succeeding Derek McMullan, who was elected chairman in October 2019 - taking over from Ken Kier OBE, former executive vice president of Honda Motor Europe. Current vice presidents of the IAM include former BBC Crimewatch presenter and safety campaigner Nick Ross and former transport minister Sir Peter Bottomley MP.
Antony Kildare was appointed Chief Executive Officer of IAM RoadSmart in August 2022.

==Membership==
Anyone with a full driving licence can join IAM Roadsmart as an associate member. Full membership requires passing the IAM&#x27;s advanced test (but there are exemptions for people with suitable emergency services or military driving qualifications). Trainees are called &quot;associates&quot;, and instructors &quot;observers&quot;.

Membership fees are paid to both head office and the local group. Full membership is renewable annually at £38 to head office, and many local groups charge around £20 yearly. Associates pay £149 once to the Head Office to join, which includes the first attempt at the advanced test.

Despite the name &quot;Advanced&quot;, only a few months&#x27; experience (one year in Northern Ireland, because of speed restrictions on newly qualified drivers) are necessary to become an associate. Many people report the value in joining the IAM early in their driving careers, because it helped them to avoid typical new driver accidents.
There are four levels of IAM membership, which represent the increasing skill levels. IAM entry level is considered a foundation in advanced motoring, which is easily achievable by most people. It requires only a rudimentary grasp of the police system of driving. At a higher skill level, a &quot;F1RST&quot; is awarded to those who pass their advanced test and achieve a score of 1 in virtually every category. An IAM F1RST is considered to be at least as high as standard as a &quot;RoSPA Gold&quot;. Moving up to a much higher skill level are &quot;Masters&quot; and &quot;Masters with distinction&quot; (described below).

==Activities==
The IAM&#x27;s objective is to increase road safety by improving driving standards. Many people find their increased skills bring more enjoyment to driving.

The charities 3 main charitable aims are
* To reduce the number of those killed and seriously injured on the roads. 
* To improve the standard of driving on the roads. 
*To administer the advanced test.

==Advanced driving test==

The IAM offers an advanced driving test. It is run independently and does not affect the driving licence from the country where the associate lives. The test is significantly more difficult than the standard driving test but is within the reach of most drivers with the right guidance. The techniques are based on the UK police driving manual.

Reasons for attempting the test include improving skills, safety or simply for fun. Motor insurers normally award a small discount on premiums (typically 10%), but a greater insurance discount is usually found with the IAM&#x27;s associated insurance company (IAM Surety). It may also appeal because the associate can improve their skill as an individual, avoiding default assumptions of risk based on statistics.

It is marketed under the name &quot;Skills for Life&quot; to emphasise the purpose of preventing fatalities and enhanced skills.

Research has shown advanced drivers to be safer and have better fuel efficiency too. For example, a study by Brunel University found advanced drivers who had been through the IAM system of car control were nearly 70% better in all aspects of their driving – from steering to judging distances and speed. Earlier research by the Transport Research Laboratory that concluded drivers are less likely to crash if they have reached a measurable higher driving standard. Unpublished research by IAM Surety showed that insurance claims by IAM members were far cheaper than comparable non-IAM members, because IAM members generally didn&#x27;t have big accidents. Additionally – according to the Association of Motor Insurers – there is a reduction in claims for the first four years after passing the IAM test. In short, IAM members are safer drivers.

400,000 people have attempted the advanced test, and the pass rate is around 75%.

===Training===
Before attempting the test, associates complete a training programme with volunteers called &quot;observers&quot; provided by the local group, and arranged at mutually convenient times. IAM suggest six lessons may be enough to pass, but time taken varies and there is no maximum. Associates use a textbook called &quot;How to be a Better Driver&quot;, which is a simplified version of the police driving manual &quot;Roadcraft&quot;. &quot;How to be a Better Driver&quot; has been criticised by some for being over simplified.

Observers are not paid for their time, although motorcycle associates may reimburse their observers for fuel. (In motorcycling, the associate and observer ride their own bikes.) Observers are trained internally, but accredited though an external body. Variable quality of observers was a criticism of the IAM, which it started to address in 2013-14 by strengthening observer training and using IMI to externally accredit observers. Some observers are professional instructors or hold the RoSPA Diploma in Advanced Instruction. There are some more senior instructors, called National Observers, in each group.

As with any road situation, legality and paperwork (including licence, insurance, and vehicle inspection) is the driver&#x27;s responsibility. In particular, motorcycle observers are advised to check they are insured for that purpose, since they ride their own bike.

===Test procedure===
Unlike the standard driving test administered by the DVSA, the IAM advanced test has less pressure, because pass or fail makes no difference to the driver&#x27;s licence. Rather, the IAM &quot;test&quot; provides the opportunity to gain assessment, guidance and tips from a police pursuit driver.

The test lasts for approximately 90 minutes and covers about and includes urban and rural areas; and motorways and/or dual carriageways, to test the candidate in a wide range of conditions and hazards. The examiner is a serving or retired police officer who holds a Police Advanced Driving Certificate (or holds the Police Driving Instructor Certificate from the UK Home Office).

Tests are marked simply as a fail, pass or F1RST, and can be retaken as often as desired. It is not unusual for those who have passed to retake the test to aim for a F1RST. Once the test is passed, the candidate is an advanced driver for life – unlike RoSPA Advanced Drivers and Riders (RoADAR), which require a 3-yearly re-test. An IAM advanced driver is not subject to re-testing, even if their licence is suspended by the government, but relevant motoring convictions must be disclosed on annual renewal of membership.

==Other services==
In 2014, the IAM introduced &quot;master&quot; as an even higher standard of driving. Master is a big step up from the IAM entry level. The IAM Masters programme provides true &quot;one-to-one&quot; mentoring support and guidance, to help people achieve the highest level of civilian driving standard in the country. Before the introduction of the IAM Masters programme, &quot;RoSPA Gold&quot; and the &quot;DIAmond Special Test&quot; were considered the highest civilian driving qualification in the UK. However, the IAM Masters is now widely recognised as the highest civilian qualification in the UK. There are two grades of Master – pass and distinction.

Building on the basics of advanced driving, the Masters programme enhances the following driving skills:

* Cornering
* Overtaking
* Recognizing opportunities to make safe progress (within the speed limits)
* Improving observation, anticipation and awareness consistent with vehicle speed
* Applying sound judgement of speed and distance
* Delivering a fluent, relevant and continuous commentary
The advanced test is offered in variants: as an accelerated programme (within three days) called FastTrack, membership and the test only (no training), taster sessions, and assessments for drivers over 55.

Motor insurance offered through IAM Surety (a trading brand of Cornmarket Insurance Services), which expressly covers observing for IAM. Typically, the insurance discounts from IAM Surety exceed those offered to advanced drivers by other insurers.

==Policy and Research==
Policy and Research were formerly called IAM Motoring Trust, which incorporates the AA Motoring Trust, it is the policy and research division of road safety of the IAM. It was formed in 2006 to carry out road safety research and advocate for safer roads, drivers, and vehicles when the IAM assumed responsibility for the work of the AA Motoring Trust.

The AA Motoring Trust was formed in 2002 after the demutualisation of The Automobile Association in 1999. The Trust was to carry out the organisation&#x27;s public interest motoring and road safety work.

The activities of the AA Motoring Trust were then transferred to the newly formed IAM Motoring Trust on 31 December 2006.

The stated objectives of the organisation are concerned with the undertaking of road safety research, the promotion of practical evidence-based policies to improve road safety, the advocacy of safer roads, drivers and vehicles, and the encouragement of responsible motoring.

===Campaign for Safe Road Design===
In July 2008, the IAM Motoring Trust became a partner in the Campaign for Safe Road Design which is calling on the UK government to make safe road design a national transport priority.

==Driver rehabilitation==
IAM RoadSmart is dedicated to re-educating drink-driving offenders through the Drink Drive Rehabilitation Course, which is officially accredited by the DVSA the course is delivered through its business unit IAM DRA.

=== Drugs and driving ===
It was estimated approximately 400 people per month were being arrested for drug-driving in England and Wales, based on statistics obtained from UK police force by IAM RoadSmart, with 900 arrests made by police forces between March and June 2015. By 2016 it&#x27;s estimated as many as 200 drug driving-related deaths occurred every year in Great Britain. Surveys suggest that one in ten young male drivers have driven under the influence of cannabis and 370,000 have driven under the influence of class A drugs.

=== Driver rehabilitation ===

New research from THINK! shows that while half the population (51%) would not consider consuming any alcoholic drinks before driving, 1 in 10 people would consider having 2 or more drinks before they get behind the wheel. This increases to 1 in 5 among men aged 18 to 34 (19%).
Sarah Sillars, Institute of Advanced Motorists chief executive officer, said: ‘Many of the people we work with on our drink-drive rehabilitation courses aren’t repeat offenders, many are drivers who thought that a second one couldn’t hurt. We support THINK!’s campaign which highlights the importance of avoiding the temptation of ‘just one more’. Know your limits and know the legal limit. Getting that second drink calculation wrong is easily avoided just by remembering that if you drive, don’t drink.’&quot;

<text>Svante Elis Strömgren (31 May 1870 – 5 April 1947) was a Swedish–Danish astronomer.

Strömgren was born in 1870 in Helsingborg, in the Scania province of Sweden. He received his doctorate at Lund University in 1898, becoming docent there the same year. He worked at the University of Kiel from 1901, and assisted in the publication of Astronomische Nachrichten from 1901 to 1904. He became Professor of Astronomy and director of the Copenhagen Observatory of the University of Copenhagen in 1907. He died in Copenhagen in 1947. The minor planet 1422 Strömgrenia was named in his honour.

Strömgren worked in a variety of fields but was particularly interested in theoretical astronomy and celestial mechanics, publishing works on the origin and orbits of comets. He also worked on the calculations for Jens Olsen&#x27;s World Clock after 1928.

His spouse, the dentist and writer Hedvig Lidforss (1877–1967), was daughter of the philologist Edvard Lidforss in Lund, and sister of the publicist and botanist Bengt Lidforss. Elis Strömgren&#x27;s sons were the astronomer Bengt Strömgren, who succeeded his father in Copenhagen in 1940 and Erik Strömgren notable danish psychiatrist.

<doc id="1316796" wikidata="Q515870" url="?curid=1316796" title="Ryan Leaf">
<text>Ryan David Leaf (born May 15, 1976) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback for four seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played for the San Diego Chargers and the Dallas Cowboys between 1998 and 2001, and also played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Seattle Seahawks.

Leaf played college football with the Washington State Cougars, finishing as a finalist for the Heisman Trophy after his junior year. He was selected as the second overall pick by the San Diego Chargers in the 1998 NFL draft after Peyton Manning, but his career was shortened due to poor play, bad behavior, injuries, and struggles with his work ethic and ability to stay focused.

After his NFL career ended, Leaf completed his degree at Washington State. He had legal troubles involving drugs beginning in 2010 when a Texas judge sentenced him to 10 years’ probation. Two years later, Leaf pleaded guilty to felony burglary and drug possession in Montana. After a suspended sentence with a stint in drug rehabilitation, Leaf began serving a seven-year sentence in state prison in December 2012. On September 9, 2014, Leaf was sentenced in Texas to five years in prison for violating his Texas probation by committing the robbery in Montana, but he never served time for this due to receiving credit for time served. He was released from prison in Montana on December 3, 2014. In October 2020, he pled guilty to a misdemeanor domestic violence charge in California and was sentenced to probation.

Leaf has worked as a Program Ambassador for Transcend Recovery Community, a group of sober living houses in Los Angeles, Houston, and New York. He also hosts a radio show and works as a college football analyst on television.

==College career==
After leading Charles M. Russell High School in Great Falls, Montana, to the 1992 Montana state title, he was told that his build and athleticism was good for a tight end, or maybe a linebacker by the head coach of the time, Dennis Erickson, at the University of Miami. He chose to be a quarterback for the Washington State Cougars instead after head coach Mike Price, who had coached longtime New England Patriots starting quarterback Drew Bledsoe, called him on the phone while Leaf was watching the Rose Bowl, and told him &quot;If you come here, we&#x27;re going there&quot;. Leaf did not know that Washington State had not reached the Rose Bowl since 1931, but later told &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; that he immediately knew he wanted to accept a scholarship and play for Price.

He played in 32 games for Washington State, starting 24 of them. In his junior year, he averaged 330.6 yards passing per game and threw for a then Pacific-10 Conference (Pac-10) record 33 touchdowns. He also led the Cougars to their first Pac-10 championship in school history. Despite his strong early showing in the 1998 Rose Bowl, Washington State was defeated 21–16 by the eventual Associated Press national champion Michigan Wolverines.

Leaf was a finalist in balloting for the Heisman Trophy that year, which is given annually to the &quot;most outstanding&quot; player in American college football voted in by media figures and former players. He finished third behind the winner, defensive back Charles Woodson of Michigan, and fellow quarterback Peyton Manning of Tennessee. He was named Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Year and was part of the All-Conference team.
Leaf was also named first-team All-America by &quot;The Sporting News&quot; while finishing second in the nation in passer rating. The Rose Bowl helped make him a possible first overall selection in the NFL draft, and Leaf decided to forgo his senior year at Washington State and enter the 1998 draft.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
===1998 NFL draft===
Peyton Manning and Leaf were widely considered to be the two best players available in the 1998 NFL draft, and scouts and analysts debated who should be selected first. Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach Tony Dungy recalled that although his team did not need a quarterback, &quot;Manning-Leaf was really split when you talked to people&quot;. Many, including 14 of 20 NFL coaches and executives in a survey, favored Leaf&#x27;s stronger arm and greater potential. Others preferred Manning as the more mature player and safer pick. Most observers believed that it would not greatly matter whether Manning or Leaf was drafted first because either would greatly benefit his team.

The Indianapolis Colts owned the first draft pick that year. Team scouts favored Leaf, but Colts president Bill Polian and coaching staff preferred Manning, especially after discovering during individual workouts that he could throw harder than Leaf. Manning also impressed the team during his interview, while Leaf missed his. Leaf&#x27;s draft prospect profile described the player as &quot;self-confident to the point where some people view him as being arrogant and almost obnoxious&quot;. Leaf gained about 20 pounds between the end of his junior season and the NFL Combine in February, which Jerry Angelo, one of six experts &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; consulted on the choice, described as &quot;a [negative] signal&quot; about his self-discipline. All six believed that Manning was the better choice, but the magazine concluded &quot;What does seem reasonably certain is that ... both Manning and Leaf should develop into at least good NFL starters&quot;.

The San Diego Chargers had the third overall pick. Polian told Chargers general manager Bobby Beathard that he would not trade the Colts&#x27; pick. Beathard later said that he would have taken Manning with the first pick because he knew his father Archie Manning, &quot;but that didn&#x27;t mean there was anything bad that way with Ryan at the time&quot;. His team needed a new quarterback after having scored the fewest touchdowns in the league in the previous season. To obtain the second draft pick from the Arizona Cardinals, San Diego traded its third overall pick, a future first round pick, a second round pick, and three-time Pro Bowler Eric Metcalf, guaranteeing the right to draft whichever of the two quarterbacks Indianapolis did not take first. Manning was drafted first by the Colts and Leaf second by the Chargers, who signed him to a four-year contract worth $31.25 million, including a guaranteed $11.25 million signing bonus, the largest ever paid to a rookie at the time. Leaf said, &quot;I&#x27;m looking forward to a 15-year career, a couple of trips to the Super Bowl, and a parade through downtown San Diego.&quot; The night after the draft, Leaf flew to Las Vegas, Nevada on the jet of Chargers owner Alex Spanos and partied all night; the following day Leaf yawned during his first news conference.

===San Diego Chargers===

====1998 season====
San Diego&#x27;s high hopes for Leaf were soon dashed as his rookie season was marred by poor behavior, starting with skipping the final day of a symposium mandatory for all NFL draftees and incurring a $10,000 fine. Leaf nonetheless did well in the preseason and the start of the regular season, as the Chargers won their first two games. The Chargers won the season opener on September 6, 1998, 16–14 over the Buffalo Bills despite mistakes from Leaf such as fumbling his first snap and throwing two interceptions; Buffalo penalties voided two would-be interceptions from Leaf. In the game, Leaf&#x27;s 6-yard touchdown pass to Bryan Still that followed a 67-yard pass to Still gave San Diego a 10–0 lead. However, late in the game, San Diego fell behind 14–13 after a Leaf interception. Leaf completed 16 of 31 passes for 192 yards in the opener and 13 of 24 passes for 179 yards (with 31 rushing yards in 7 carries) in the second game, a 13–7 win over the Tennessee Oilers.

Three days before the Chargers&#x27; September 20 game against the Kansas City Chiefs, Leaf was hospitalized for a viral infection that he attributed to an improperly cleaned artificial-turf burn. He started the game but completed only one of 15 passes for four yards, threw two interceptions and had four fumbles (three lost) in a 23–7 loss. The next day, Leaf was caught on camera shouting at &quot;San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; reporter Jay Posner to &quot;knock it off&quot; during a locker-room interview and was led away by Junior Seau and a team executive, during which he called Posner a &quot;fucking bitch&quot;. He later apologized to Posner for the incident.

After Leaf had four first-half passes picked off by the New York Giants in Week 4 (September 28), he was benched by head coach Kevin Gilbride in favor of former sixth-round pick Craig Whelihan. He started the following game on October 4 in a 17–12 loss to the Indianapolis Colts and top pick Peyton Manning. Both quarterbacks completed 12 of 23 passes and threw one interception, with Leaf having 23 more passing yards (160) than Manning, but Manning threw the game&#x27;s only touchdown and was never sacked while Leaf was downed four times. Inside the final two minutes and San Diego down 14–6, Leaf&#x27;s 56-yard pass to Charlie Jones set up a one-yard Natrone Means touchdown run, but Leaf&#x27;s potential tying two-point conversion pass to Webster Slaughter was incomplete. He then lost his starting job permanently to Whelihan following a 4-of-15, 23-yard performance with an interception against the Denver Broncos on November 8. Leaf finished the season with 1,289 passing yards in ten games and a 45.3% completion percentage with only two touchdowns against fifteen interceptions, earning him an abysmal quarterback rating of 39.0.

Leaf related poorly to both the media and his teammates, whom he tended to blame for his poor play, and developed a reputation for a poor work ethic, such as playing golf while other quarterbacks were studying film. Beathard said, &quot;Guys can be jerks, but I&#x27;ve never seen a guy that worked harder at alienating his teammates. Junior Seau, Rodney Harrison, they came to me and said, &#x27;Bobby, this guy is killing me.&#x27;&quot; Harrison described the 1998 season as &quot;a nightmare&quot; due to Leaf&#x27;s immaturity and Whelihan&#x27;s inefficiency: &quot;If I had to go through another year like that, I&#x27;d probably quit playing.&quot; During the offseason, the team&#x27;s defensive veterans called on management to sign a veteran quarterback, claiming Leaf&#x27;s shortcomings undercut their league-leading performance. Seau, for instance, urged management to &quot;get a guy in here not to babysit, but to win&quot; and give Leaf time to develop.

====1999 season====
Leaf suffered an injury to his throwing shoulder 20 minutes into the Chargers&#x27; opening training camp workout on July 23, 1999. One month later, a fan heckled Leaf by singing lyrics from the Little River Band song &quot;Lonesome Loser&quot; and comparing him to failed NFL quarterback Heath Shuler. Leaf, accompanied by a coach and security guards, went to confront the fan but was restrained by two coaches, with another Chargers employee saying, &quot;No, don&#x27;t do it, Ryan. Don&#x27;t do it.&quot; Leaf later explained the incident: &quot;...what I wanted to do was say, &#x27;Hey, look, I&#x27;ve grown up, I&#x27;m calm about it, I would like to understand why you would say that about me.&#x27;&quot;

Leaf underwent surgery to fix a labral tear in his shoulder and missed the 1999 season. He was placed on injured reserve but made headlines in early November when he got into a shouting match with Beathard and a coach, resulting in a fine, a suspension without pay, and an apology from Leaf four weeks later. During his suspension, he was caught on video playing flag football at a San Diego park, a violation of his contract according to team management.

====2000 season====
In the final game of the 2000 preseason, Leaf completed a pass to Trevor Gaylor to seal a 24–20 win over the Arizona Cardinals. After the game, he appeared on the cover of the September 4, 2000, issue of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; along with headline &quot;Back from the Brink&quot;. The cover story characterized his comeback as &quot;an ascent from pariah to possible standout pro passer&quot;. He started the first two games of the 2000 season but completed less than half of his pass attempts and threw five interceptions against only one touchdown. In the season opener on September 3, a 9–6 loss to the Oakland Raiders, Leaf completed 17 of 39 passes for 180 yards and three picks, including one on a 4th-and-inches play with 1:37 left that sealed the Raiders&#x27; victory. He suffered swelling in his left hand in addition to a chin gash that required stitches following a late hit from Raiders defensive tackle Regan Upshaw. The following game, a 28–27 loss to the New Orleans Saints, Leaf completed 12 of 24 passes for 134 yards and threw his first touchdown pass since his rookie season, a 20-yarder to Curtis Conway, but also threw two interceptions, one of which again cost the Chargers at the end of the game.

Head coach Mike Riley planned to start backup Moses Moreno in Week 3, but Leaf started after Moreno suffered a shoulder injury. The following week, Leaf suffered a sprained wrist that caused him to miss the next five games. In November, he publicly speculated that the Chargers would release him after the season, and later that month, reports suggested that Leaf had lied about his wrist injury to get out of practice and play golf instead.

In the Week 11 game on November 12 against the Miami Dolphins, Leaf replaced Moreno mid-game. Leaf threw an interception on his fourth snap, led a touchdown drive in the Chargers&#x27; next series, and left the game with nearly a minute to go after straining a hamstring on a scramble. This game was the first since 1993 where three quarterbacks on the same team – in this case Leaf, Moreno, and Jim Harbaugh – each threw an interception in one game. On November 19 against the Denver Broncos, Leaf completed 13 of 27 passes and reached career single-game highs in quarterback rating (111.8), passing yards (311), and passing touchdowns (3), but the Chargers lost the game 38–37. After an 0–11 start, the Chargers got their first win on November 26, 17–16 over the Kansas City Chiefs. The Chargers took a 14–3 lead early in the second quarter after Leaf threw two touchdowns to Freddie Jones, but the offense struggled late in the game on the back of two interceptions, one of which was returned for a touchdown.

Leaf would again play poorly with four more picks against the San Francisco 49ers on December 3, and with only 9 of 23 passes completed on December 10 in a loss to the Baltimore Ravens. He rebounded with 23 of 43 passes for 259 yards, two touchdowns and one interception in a December 17 loss to the Carolina Panthers 30–22. In the Chargers&#x27; final drive, with nearly two minutes remaining in the game, Leaf completed a 10-yard pass to Curtis Conway that was ruled six inches short of the end zone. On first down, however, miscommunication between Leaf and running back Jermaine Fazande resulted in a fumble and 8-yard loss, and the next two plays followed by a penalty forced a fourth down and goal 10 yards from the end zone, and Leaf&#x27;s fourth-down pass was incomplete. On the final game of the season on December 24, Leaf made a 71-yard touchdown pass to Jeff Graham on the first play from scrimmage, but San Diego lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers 34–21. In the game, Leaf completed 15 of 29 passes for 171 yards, 1 touchdown, and 1 interception, and a fumble of his final snap. For the 2000 season, Leaf completed 50% (161 of 322) of his passes for 1,883 yards, 11 touchdowns, and 18 interceptions.

After finishing the season with a disastrous 1–15 record, the Chargers released Leaf on February 28, 2001. In three seasons with the Chargers, he won only four of 18 games as a starter, and threw a total of 13 touchdowns and 33 interceptions.

===Tampa Bay Buccaneers===
On March 2, 2001, two days after the Chargers released him, Leaf was claimed by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who were intrigued by his physical talent and planned to develop him more slowly, giving him time to watch and learn. Leaf&#x27;s wrist had still not healed, and doctors recommended surgery. After mediocre preseason performances, he was asked to accept demotion to fourth quarterback status on the team and accept a lower salary. He refused, and was released on September 3, five days before the start of the 2001 season.

===Dallas Cowboys===
Leaf&#x27;s next attempt at a comeback was with the Dallas Cowboys, who signed him after the Buccaneers released him, but he failed his first physical and was let go on September 5. After regular starter Quincy Carter suffered an injury, the Cowboys signed Leaf again on October 12. The Cowboys released him in May 2002 after he had appeared in only four games – all losses – throwing for a four-game total of 494 yards with only one touchdown and three interceptions.

===Retirement and legacy===
Days later, Leaf got still another chance when the Seattle Seahawks signed him to a one-year contract, planning to let him develop slowly (as the Buccaneers had done) to allow his still-injured wrist time to heal. He attended the team&#x27;s spring minicamps and seemed upbeat about his new team, but then abruptly retired at the age of 26 just before the start of the Seahawks&#x27; 2002 training camp, offering no explanation at first. Seahawks head coach and general manager Mike Holmgren told the media Leaf&#x27;s wrist did not bother him with either the Cowboys or the Seahawks.

During his brief career in the NFL, Leaf appeared in 25 games and made 21 starts. He completed 317 of 655 (48.4%) passes for 3,666 yards, with 14 touchdowns and 36 interceptions and a career quarterback rating of 50.0. Rodney Harrison, one of Leaf&#x27;s most outspoken critics on the Chargers, said of his retirement, &quot;He took the money and ran. Personally, I could never rest good at night knowing my career ended like that. Normally in this game, you get back what you put into it, and he pretty much got back what he put into it&quot;.

ESPN put Leaf first on its list of 25 biggest sports flops between 1979 and 2004. NBC Sports commentator Michael Ventre called him &quot;the biggest bust in the history of professional sports&quot;. Since Leaf&#x27;s retirement, sportswriters and commentators have characterized subsequent drafted potential NFL quarterback flops as &quot;the next Ryan Leaf&quot;. In 2010, NFL Network listed Leaf as the number one NFL quarterback bust of all time, adding that the only good that came out of drafting Leaf for the Chargers is that it put the team in position to draft LaDainian Tomlinson, Drew Brees, and eventually (after it initially appeared Brees himself would be a draft bust) Philip Rivers.

&quot;Deadspin&quot; ranked Leaf as the sixth worst NFL player of all time in 2011, opining &quot;To call Leaf a bust is unfair to the Blair Thomases and David Carrs of the world.&quot;

Dish Network included Leaf in their 2015 &quot;Biggest NFL Bust Bracket&quot; where he was a &quot;1 Seed&quot; along with fellow busts JaMarcus Russell, Tony Mandarich, and David Carr.

Leaf in 2016 compared the problems of Cleveland Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel to his own, saying it was like &quot;looking in the mirror&quot; and that the only difference was that Leaf&#x27;s substance abuse problems happened after he retired. Leaf went on to state that Manziel is able to get the help he needs. According to Leaf, Archie Manning asked Leaf&#x27;s father before the 2004 NFL draft about how the Chargers treated him. While accepting responsibility for his poor behavior and play, Leaf said that his father telling Archie that the team did not help him was part of why Peyton&#x27;s brother Eli Manning forced the Chargers to trade him to the New York Giants that year.

==Life after football==
After retiring from professional football, Leaf returned to San Diego and became a financial consultant. In 2004, Leaf resumed his education at Washington State University and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in humanities in May 2005.

He then joined Don Carthel&#x27;s West Texas A&amp;M University staff as a volunteer quarterbacks coach in 2006, commenting, &quot;About a year after I retired from playing, I decided that I wanted to get back to college, where I had the greatest time of my life, and to get involved with college football.&quot; He also admitted that he was unprepared for the NFL when he was drafted back in 1998. In April 2008, ESPN described Leaf as having come to terms with his past. He said at the time, &quot;When playing football became a job, it lost its luster for me. I kind of got out of the spotlight, and life&#x27;s never been this good.&quot; But in November 2008 he was put on indefinite leave, and resigned the next day from his coaching position at West Texas A&amp;M for allegedly asking one of his players for a pill to help him deal with pain in his wrist from past injuries. Leaf&#x27;s usage of painkillers dates back to 2002, when he took Vicodin from a boxing promoter after attending a match in Las Vegas. Leaf described the event as what &quot;started about an eight-year run of off-and-on opioid abuse that took my life to the very bottom&quot;.

In October 2009, he went to work in Vancouver, British Columbia as business-development manager for a travel company.

In September 2010, he began writing a regular column about Washington State University football for the website Cougfan.com. He wrote nine columns that football season and his work attracted a strong following among Washington State fans. In December 2010, he signed a contract with Pullman, Washington-based Crimson Oak Publishing to write no fewer than three memoirs. Crimson Oak describes its mission as publishing books with themes of &quot;hope, possibility, and determination&quot;. Crimson Oak released Leaf&#x27;s first book &quot;596 Switch: The Improbable Journey from The Palouse to Pasadena&quot; in October 2011. The book, which he co-wrote with fellow Washington State graduate Greg Witter, focuses on the 1997 Washington State football team that made the 1998 Rose Bowl.

As of April 2018, he was working as a Program Ambassador for Transcend Recovery Community after staying sober the last six years. Transcend is a recovery community with nine locations in Houston, New York, and Los Angeles. In an interview with Ellen DeGeneres, he stated, &quot;I started a foundation called the Focus Intensity Foundation, what I do is I raise money for scholarships for people who can&#x27;t afford treatment, mental health treatment.&quot; In April, he wrote an article for &quot;The Players&#x27; Tribune&quot; titled &quot;Letter to My Younger Self&quot;, describing his NFL career and life after its end.

Leaf also has a radio show and works as a college football analyst on television for the Pac-12 Network.

On July 14, 2019, Leaf was hired by ESPN as an analyst for the 2019–2020 college football season for games on ESPN2 and ESPNU. Leaf has worked as an analyst for select weeks of Westwood One&#x27;s Sunday night Football since the 2021 season and as a Sideline Reporter for the NFL Playoffs on Westwood One. 
He has appeared as an analyst in the show NFL overtime on Sky Sports in the UK during the 2021 season.

Leaf joined The CW broadcast team in 2024 and called Pac-12 games.

==Personal life==
In 2001, Leaf married Nicole Lucia, a Charger cheerleader and daughter of financial radio host Ray Lucia. They separated in November 2003 and eventually divorced. In 2017 he was engaged to former Georgetown Hoyas volleyball player Anna Kleinsorge. The couple have two children, a daughter and a son.

His younger brother Brady Leaf played quarterback for the Oregon Ducks football team behind Dennis Dixon from 2003 to 2006.

In September 2010, the Associated Press reported that Leaf was spending time with his family in Montana.

In June 2011, he had a benign tumor from his brainstem surgically removed.

On April 1, 2012, Leaf attempted suicide and slit his wrists.

===Legal troubles===
In May 2009, Leaf was indicted on burglary and controlled substance charges in Texas. He was in a drug-rehabilitation program in British Columbia, Canada at the time of the indictment and was arrested by customs agents at the border on his return to the U.S. as he was intending to fly to Texas to surrender on the indictment. However, his attorney Jeffrey A. Lustick successfully blocked the fugitive warrant extradition process, therefore legally allowing Leaf to go to Texas on his own. Lustick later successfully got the Washington fugitive action against Leaf dismissed with prejudice. On June 17, he posted a $45,000 bond in Washington state for the criminal charges in Texas. In April 2010, he pled guilty in Amarillo, Texas to seven counts of obtaining a controlled substance by fraud and one count of delivery of a simulated controlled substance, all felonies. State District Judge John B. Board sentenced him to ten years of probation and fined him $20,000.

On March 30, 2012, he was arrested on burglary, theft, and drug charges in his home town of Great Falls, Montana. Four days later, he was arrested again on burglary, theft, and two counts of criminal possession of dangerous drugs. As part of a plea bargain on May 8, 2012, he pled guilty to one count of felony burglary and one count of criminal possession of a dangerous drug.

In late April 2012, Texas authorities issued two arrest warrants for him and set his bond at $126,000.

On June 19, 2012, Leaf was sentenced to seven years in custody of the Montana Department of Corrections, with two years suspended if he abided by the conditions imposed by District Judge Kenneth Neil in Montana. He was to spend the first nine months of his sentence in a lockdown addiction treatment facility, Nexus Treatment Center in Lewistown, Montana. But on January 17, 2013, Leaf was remanded to Montana State Prison in Deer Lodge after being found guilty of &quot;behavior that violated conditions of his drug treatment placement&quot;. He was also accused of threatening a program staff member.

In May 2014, Leaf was incarcerated at Crossroads Correctional Facility in Shelby, Montana.

On September 9, 2014, a Texas judge sentenced Leaf to five years&#x27; imprisonment, giving credit for time spent in prison in Montana. According to ESPN, Leaf would not see further time in jail, but would also not be released from Montana prison. On December 3, 2014, Leaf was released from prison and placed under the supervision of Great Falls Probation and Parole.

On May 22, 2020, Leaf was arrested for misdemeanor domestic battery in Palm Desert, California. Nearly five months later, he admitted to the charge in a plea deal that resulted in three years of probation and a 12-month class on domestic violence.

<text>Henri-François-Joseph de Régnier (; 28 December 1864 – 23 May 1936) was a French symbolist poet, considered one of the most important of France during the early 20th century.

==Life and works==
He was born in Honfleur (Calvados) on 28 December 1864, and educated in Paris for law. In 1885 he began to contribute to the Parisian reviews, and his verses were published by most of the French and Belgian periodicals favorable to the symbolist writers. Having begun as a Parnassian, he retained the classical tradition, though he adopted some of the innovations of Jean Moréas and Gustave Kahn. His vaguely suggestive style shows the influence of Stéphane Mallarmé, of whom he was an assiduous disciple.

His first volume of poems, &quot;Lendemains&quot;, appeared in 1885, and among numerous later volumes are &quot;Poèmes anciens et romanesques&quot; (1890), &quot;Les Jeux rustiques et divins&quot; (1890), &quot;Les Médailles d&#x27;argile&quot; (1900), &quot;La Cité des eaux&quot; (1903). He is also the author of a series of realistic novels and tales, among which are &quot;La Canne de jaspe&quot; (2nd ed., 1897), &quot;La Double maîtresse&quot; (5th ed., 1900), &quot;Les Vacances d’un jeune homme sage&quot; (1903), and &quot;Les Amants singuliers&quot; (1905). Régnier married Marie de Heredia, daughter of the poet José María de Heredia, and herself a novelist and poet under the pen name of Gérard d&#x27;Houville.

He was a contributor to &quot;Le Visage de l&#x27;Italie&quot;, a 1929 book about Italy prefaced by Benito Mussolini.

&quot;La Canne de jaspe&quot; and &quot;Histoires Incertaines&quot; (1919) were translated in 2012 by Brian Stableford under the title &quot;A Surfeit of Mirrors&quot; 

Henri de Régnier died in 1936 at age 71 and was interred in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

== Other media ==
*An edition of Maurice Ravel&#x27;s waltz &quot;Valses nobles et sentimentales&quot; was published with a quotation from de Régnier &quot;…le plaisir délicieux et toujours nouveau d&#x27;une occupation inutile&quot;
*In the introductory cutscene to the 2012 video game &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Dogma&quot; by Capcom, the quotation &quot;le plaisir délicieux... d&#x27;une occupation inutile&quot; (subtitled trans. &quot;The delightful and ever-novel pleasure of a useless occupation.&quot;) is given and attributed to de Régnier himself.

<text>Bogusław Radziwiłł (; 3 May 1620 – 31 December 1669) was a Polish princely magnate and a member of the Polish-Lithuanian &quot;szlachta&quot;, or nobility. He was of the Radziwiłł magnate family. By birth he was an Imperial Prince of the Holy Roman Empire. He was a descendant of the famous knight, Zawisza the Black. Following the death of Janusz Radziwiłł, he briefly served as Grand Hetman of Swedish Lithuania.

==Biography==
Born of the mightiest and highest resident family of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (as well as a blood descendant of King Casimir IV of Poland, and Kęstutis and Vytautas, monarchs of Lithuania), Radziwiłł was the owner of Biržai, Dubingiai, Słuck, and Kopyta, the great Standard-bearer of Lithuania since 1638, the Master of the Stables of Lithuania since 1648, and the Starost of Bar. Radziwiłł was Governor of the Duchy of Prussia (Brandenburg-Prussia) (&quot;generalny gubernator Prus Książęcych&quot;) since 1657.

From 1637 to 1648 Radziwiłł studied abroad, in Germany, Netherlands, England, and France.

For several decades, the interests between the Radziwiłł family and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth had begun to drift apart, as Radziwłł were less satisfied with the magnate status of the family and its immense wealth and began craving more political power.

Together with his cousin Janusz Radziwiłł in 1654 during The Deluge, or Swedish invasion of Poland, Bogusław Radziwiłł began negotiations with King Charles X Gustav of Sweden aimed at breaking the Commonwealth and the Polish–Lithuanian union. They signed a treaty according to which the Swedish–Lithuanian union was founded and the Radziwiłłs were to rule over two duchies carved up from the lands of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (this was also confirmed in another treaty, the treaty of Radnot).

The Swedish defeat and eventual retreat from the territories of the Commonwealth abruptly ended the plans of Janusz and Bogusław. The former died at Tykocin Castle besieged by forces loyal to the Commonwealth, while Bogusław retreated with his forces to Prussia, where he supported Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, against the Polish king. In the Battle of Prostki on 8 October 1656, Bogusław&#x27;s forces were decimated by the Commonwealth forces under Hetman Wincenty Korwin Gosiewski. Radziwiłł himself was captured by the Tatars, who initially enslaved him and wanted to transport him to Crimea. After fierce discussions with the Tatar commanders, he was handed over to Gosiewski.

Boguslaw married Anna Maria Radziwiłł, the only daughter of his relative and collaborator, the late prince Janusz. In turn, this couple had only one surviving child, a daughter, Ludwika Karolina Radziwiłł. Both Bogusław&#x27;s and Janusz&#x27;s lines of the Radziwiłł family became extinct by the next generation.

In Poland it is believed that Bogusław&#x27;s and Janusz&#x27;s only lasting achievement was to tarnish the Radziwiłł family name for years to come with their treason, eclipsing the deeds of other Radziwiłłs like Michał Kazimierz Radziwiłł, who fought for the Crown and the Commonwealth against the Swedes. Bogusław is the archvillain in a novel by Henryk Sienkiewicz, &quot;The Deluge&quot;, which is mandatory school reading in Poland, and is also the basis for a very popular eponymous film.

Bogusław died in exile in Königsberg in Brandenburg-Prussia. He was the last Calvinist male member of his family. His estates and the task to protect the Polish Reformed Church passed to his only daughter, Princess Ludwika Karolina.
