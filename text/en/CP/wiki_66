<text>James Sykes (March 27, 1761 – October 18, 1822) was an American physician and politician from Dover, in Kent County, Delaware. He was a member of the Federalist Party, who served in the Delaware General Assembly and as Governor of Delaware.

==Early life and family==
James Sykes was born near Dover, Delaware, the son of James and Agnes Sykes. His father was a member of the Delaware General Assembly and a delegate to the Continental Congress. James Jr. studied medicine under Dr. Joshua Clayton and first practiced in Cambridge, Maryland. While there he married Elizabeth Goldsborough, daughter of Judge Robert Goldsborough. After four years they returned to Dover living on The Green. They had three children; James, Anna Matilda, and William, and were members of Christ Episcopal Church. Their house is now an office building.

==Professional and political career==
In 1791 the Delaware General Assembly appointed Sykes to help manage a lottery to raise one thousand pounds to defray expenses incurred in constructing a new state house. After serving as clerk for the State House in 1796, he was elected to the State Senate in 1793. He served one term for the 1794, 1795, and 1796 sessions. Returning a year later, he served six more terms from the 1798 session through the 1812 session. He was Speaker in 1801, and then in every session from 1804 through 1812. He was also the Democratic-Republican nominee in all three of Delaware&#x27;s U.S. Senate elections in 1798 and 1799.

On February 20, 1801, Governor Richard Bassett resigned following his appointment as U.S. Circuit Court Judge by U.S. President John Adams. As the Speaker of the State Senate, Sykes was next in line of succession and took office as governor. He chose not to run for election in his right, and returned to the State Senate on January 19, 1802.

In the meantime, Sykes had become one of the state&#x27;s most renowned surgeons. From his office at 45 The Green in Dover, he specialized in treating gallstones and yellow fever. In 1814 he moved his practice to New York City for six years, but then returned to the Dover practice with his son, James. In 1822 he became President of the Delaware Medical Society.

==Death and legacy==
Sykes died at Dover and is buried there in the Christ Episcopal Church Cemetery. His son, James, was a physician in Dover and his son, William, was the father of Major General George Sykes, a commander at Gettysburg in the American Civil War.

==Almanac==
Elections were held the first Tuesday of October, and members of the General Assembly took office the first Tuesday of January. State senators had a three-year term. The governor took office the third Tuesday of January and had a three-year term. However, Sykes served as State President, only filling the vacancy caused by the resignation of Richard Bassett.

<text>The 1964 United States House of Representatives elections was an election for the United States House of Representatives on November 3, 1964, to elect members to serve in the 89th United States Congress. They coincided with the election to a full term of President Lyndon B. Johnson. Johnson&#x27;s landslide victory over Barry Goldwater allowed his Democratic Party to gain a net of 36 seats from the Republican Party, giving them a two-thirds majority in the House. The election also marked the first time since Reconstruction that Republicans made inroads in the Deep South, with Republicans winning seats in Georgia for the first time since 1874, and Alabama and Mississippi since 1876.

Disappointment over the results caused House Republicans to replace Minority Leader Charles Halleck with future President Gerald R. Ford.

==Overall results==
397 incumbent members sought reelection, but 8 were defeated in primaries and 45 defeated in the general election for a total of 344 incumbents winning.

Summary of the November 3, 1964, election results


=== Maps ===
== Southern significance==
While the GOP performed badly nationally, Goldwater&#x27;s tremendous success in the Deep South led to the election of several Republicans to the House from those states, many of them the first Republicans elected there since Reconstruction. These &quot;Goldwater Republicans&quot; were elected:

* Glenn Andrews (AL-4)
* John H. Buchanan Jr. (AL-6)
* Bo Callaway (GA-3)
* William L. Dickinson (AL-2)
* Jack Edwards (AL-1)
* James D. Martin (AL-7)
* Prentiss Walker (MS-4)
* Albert Watson (SC-2)

== Alabama ==

Alabama, which had not agreed on a redistricting plan until 1964 and had elected all members at-large in 1962, went back to electing from districts. While most of the at-large representatives were former district representatives and were thus geographically diverse, the 1st district near Mobile lacked an incumbent, and neither of the incumbents who lived in the 7th district were nominated.

== Michigan ==

Michigan redistricted, converting its at-large seat into a 19th district and realigning the other districts to account for population growth in the Detroit suburbs. Two Democratic seats and one Republican seat were eliminated or combined at redistricting, but the defeat of three Republican incumbents and the election of Democrats to all the new seats yielded a net shift of four seats, changing the party balance from 11–8 Republican to 12–7 Democratic.

Rowe later appeared in a national road show version of the series entitled &quot;Hee Haw Honey Reunion&quot;.

==Film &amp; Television==
In addition to her roles on &quot;Hee Haw&quot; and &quot;Hee Haw Honeys&quot;, Rowe portrayed carhop Wendy in early seasons of the sitcom &quot;Happy Days&quot; and Maid Marian in the Mel Brooks-produced &quot;When Things Were Rotten&quot; (1975). Rowe&#x27;s 1980s television appearances include several episodes of &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; and &quot;The Love Boat&quot; and portraying a country music singer on &quot;Airwolf&quot;. 

On film, Rowe has twice portrayed Marilyn Monroe, in &quot;Goodbye, Norma Jean&quot; (1976) and &quot;Goodnight, Sweet Marilyn&quot; (1989). Her other film credits include &quot;The Hitchhikers&quot; (1972), &quot;Loose Shoes&quot; (1980), &quot;The Man with Bogart&#x27;s Face&quot; (1980), &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Class Reunion&quot; (1982), and &quot;Meatballs Part II&quot; (1984), and the television movie &quot;&quot; (1977).

==Stage==
Rowe&#x27;s stage credits include children&#x27;s theater (&quot;Misty&#x27;s Magic Moo Town&quot;), appearing as Patsy Cline in the off-Broadway musical &quot;Always...Patsy Cline&quot;, and the Atlantic City production &quot;Misty Christmas, Finally a Fruitcake You&#x27;ll Like!&quot; In 2010, Rowe appeared in the self-written, off-Broadway musical &quot;Fandance: The Legend of Sally Rand.&quot;

==In other media==
Austin, Texas rock band Young Heart Attack wrote a song called &quot;Misty Rowe&quot;. In a 2004 interview, songwriter Steven Hall said about the song: &quot;I was obsessed with this actress [Rowe] who was on &quot;Hee Haw&quot; and &quot;Happy Days&quot;. She was really sexy and Misty Rowe was the first woman on television who made me feel...different.&quot;

<doc id="1341873" wikidata="Q1177765" url="?curid=1341873" title="Tower of David">
<text>The Tower of David (), also known as the Citadel (), is an ancient citadel and contemporary museum, located near the Jaffa Gate entrance to the Old City of Jerusalem.

The citadel that stands today dates to the Mamluk and Ottoman periods. It was built on the site of a series of earlier ancient fortifications of the Hasmonean, Herodian, Byzantine and Early Muslim periods, after being destroyed repeatedly during the last decades of Crusader presence in the Holy Land by their Muslim enemies. It contains artifacts from the Iron Age including a quarry dated to the Second Temple period and pottery, fishbones, and other archaeological finds dating from the First Temple Period, and is a venue for benefit events, craft shows, concerts, and sound-and-light performances.

Dan Bahat, an Israeli archaeologist, writes that the original three Hasmonean towers standing in this area of the city were altered by Herod, and that &quot;the northeastern tower was replaced by a much larger, more massive tower, dubbed the &#x27;Tower of David&#x27; beginning in the 5th century CE&quot; Originally referring to the Herodian tower in the northeast of the citadel, in the 19th century the name &quot;Tower of David&quot; began to refer to the 17th-century minaret at the opposite side of the citadel, and since 1967 officially refers to the entire citadel.

==Names==
===Tower of David: Herodian tower===
The name &quot;Tower of David&quot; was first used for the Herodian tower in the 5th centuryCE by the Byzantine Christians, who believed the site to be the palace of King David. They borrowed the name &quot;Tower of David&quot; from the Song of Songs, attributed to Solomon, King David&#x27;s son, who wrote: &quot;Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men&quot; (Song of Songs, 4:4).

===Arabic names===
An Arabic name of the massive Herodian-Mamluk northeast tower is the ().

During the Early Muslim and Ayyubid periods it was known in Arabic as , . Note that there is also another mihrab called , built into the inner side of the Southern Wall of the Haram esh-Sharif/Temple Mount.

==History==

===Hasmonean period===
During the 2nd century BCE, the Old City of Jerusalem expanded further onto the so-called Western Hill. This high prominence, which comprises the modern Armenian and Jewish Quarters as well as Mount Zion, was bounded by steep valleys on all sides except for the north. The first settlement in this area was about 150 BCE, around the time of the Hasmonean kings, when what Josephus Flavius called &quot;the First Wall&quot; was constructed.

===Herod&#x27;s towers===
Herod, who wrested power from the Hasmonean dynasty, added three massive towers to the fortifications in 37–34 BCE. He built these at the vulnerable northwest corner of the Western Hill, where the citadel is now located. His purpose was not only to defend the city, but to safeguard his own royal palace located nearby on Mount Zion. Herod named the tallest of the towers, in height, Phasael, in memory of his brother who had committed suicide while in captivity. Another tower was called Mariamne, named for his second wife whom he had executed and buried in a cave to the west of the tower. He named the third tower Hippicus after one of his friends. Of the three towers, only the base of one of them survives today—either the Phasael or, as argued by archaeologist Hillel Geva who excavated the citadel, the Hippicus Tower. Of the original tower itself (now called the &quot;Tower of David&quot;), some 16 courses of the Herodian stone ashlars still rise from ground level (partially hidden by a much later built glacis), upon which were added smaller stones in a later period, that added back significantly to the height of the remaining stump of the Herodian tower.

During the Jewish war with Rome, Simon bar Giora made the tower his place of residence. Following the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 CE, the three towers were preserved as a testimony of the might of the fortifications overcome by the Roman legions, and the site served as barracks for the Roman troops.

When the Roman Empire adopted Christianity as its favoured religion in the 4th century, a community of monks established itself in the citadel. It was during the Byzantine period that the remaining Herodian tower, and by extension the citadel as a whole, acquired its alternative name—the Tower of David—after the Byzantines, mistakenly identifying the hill as Mount Zion, presumed it to be David&#x27;s palace mentioned in 2 Samuel.

===Early Muslims, Crusaders, Ayyubids===

After the Arab conquest of Jerusalem in 638, the new Muslim rulers refurbished the citadel. This powerful structure withstood the assault of the Crusaders in 1099, and surrendered only when its defenders were guaranteed safe passage out of the city.

During the Crusader period, thousands of pilgrims undertook the pilgrimage to Jerusalem by way of the port at Jaffa. To protect pilgrims from the menace of highway robbers, the Crusaders built a tower surrounded by a moat atop the citadel, and posted lookouts to guard the road to Jaffa. The citadel also protected the newly erected palace of the Crusader kings of Jerusalem, located immediately south of the citadel.

In 1187, Sultan Saladin captured the city including the citadel. In 1239, the Ayyubid emir of Karak, An-Nasir Dawud, attacked the Crusader garrison and destroyed the citadel. In their 1244 siege of the city, the Khwarazmians defeated and banished the Crusaders from Jerusalem for a last time, destroying the entire city in the process. The Mamluks destroyed the citadel in 1260.

===Mamluk and Ottoman citadel===

In 1310 the citadel was rebuilt by Mamluk sultan Al-Nasir Muhammad ibn Qalawun, who gave it much of its present shape.

The citadel was expanded between 1537 and 1541 by the Ottoman sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, whose architects designed a large entrance, behind which stood a cannon emplacement. For 400 years, the citadel served as a garrison for Turkish troops. The Ottomans also installed a mosque near the southwest corner of the citadel commonly known as the (&#x27;Prayer niche of David&#x27;s fortress&#x27;), erecting a minaret during the years 1635–1655. In the 19th century the conspicuous minaret, which still stands today, became commonly referred to as the &quot;Tower of David&quot;. At least two mosques are known to exist within the citadel.

During World War I, British forces under General Edmund Allenby successfully captured Jerusalem. Allenby formally proclaimed the event standing on a platform at the outer eastern gate of the citadel.

===British and Jordanian periods===
During the period of British rule (1917–1948), the High Commissioner for Palestine established the Pro-Jerusalem Society to protect the city&#x27;s cultural heritage. This organisation cleaned and renovated the citadel and reopened it to the public as a venue for concerts, benefit events and exhibitions by local artists. In the 1930s, a museum of Palestinian folklore was opened in the citadel, displaying traditional crafts and clothing.

Following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the Arab Legion captured Jerusalem and converted the citadel back to its historical role as a military position, as it commanded a dominant view across the armistice line into Jewish Jerusalem. It would keep this role until 1967.

==Tower of David Museum==

Since the Six-Day War in 1967, the citadel&#x27;s cultural role was revived.

The Tower of David Museum of the History of Jerusalem was opened in 1989 by the Jerusalem Foundation. Located in a series of chambers in the original citadel, the museum includes a courtyard which contains archeological remains dating back 2,700 years.

The exhibits depict 4,000 years of Jerusalem&#x27;s history, from its beginnings as a Canaanite city to modern times. Using maps, videos, holograms, drawings and models, the exhibit rooms each depict Jerusalem under its various rulers. Visitors may also ascend to the ramparts, which command a 360-degree view of the Old City and New City of Jerusalem.

As of 2002, the Jerusalem Foundation reported that over 3.5 million visitors had toured the museum.

==Archaeology==
In 2010, a survey of the site was conducted by Yehudah Rapuano on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA).

<text>Fusignano () is a &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Ravenna (Emilia-Romagna) in Italy. It is located on the river Senio.

==History==
The city was created in 1250 by count Bernardino of Cunio after a flood which had destroyed his castle at Donigallia. After several passages of property in the hands of local noble families, the castle of Fusignano was transferred to the Este family in 1445.

When the Duchy of Ferrara was annexed to the Papal States (1598), the fief was elevated to a marquisate, which in 1622, after a long struggle with the Corelli family, was acquired by the Calcagnini. In the 18th century the city recovered from a dark period, and in 1796 became part of the French dominions. In 1815 it returned to the Papal States. With the unification of Italy (1860), Fusignano was separated from Ferrara and included in the province of Ravenna.

During World War II, as part of the Spring 1945 offensive in Italy, Fusignano was for four months on the front line, and reduced to ruins. One soldier Ali Haidar was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions here during World War II.

==Main sights==
The church of San Giovanni Battista houses a 16th-century pale portraying the &quot;Baptism of Christ&quot;. In the church of San Savino the ancient sepulchre of the namesake saint, one of the first evangelizers of Romagna, can be seen: however, the relics it contained were transferred by Astorre II Manfredi to a chapel in the Cathedral of Faenza.

==Twin towns==

Fusignano is twinned with:
* Biddulph, United Kingdom

==Personalities==
* Arcangelo Corelli (1653 in Fusignano – 1713) Italian violin player and Baroque music composer
* Lea Melandri (born 1941 in Fusignano) feminist and writer
* Arrigo Sacchi (born 1946 in Fusignano) Italian football manager,

<doc id="1341882" wikidata="Q2634516" url="?curid=1341882" title="State monopoly">
<text>In economics, a government monopoly or public monopoly is a form of coercive monopoly in which a government agency or government corporation is the sole provider of a particular good or service and competition is prohibited by law. It is a monopoly created, owned, and operated by the government. It is usually distinguished from a government-granted monopoly, where the government grants a monopoly to a private individual or company.

A government monopoly may be run by any level of government—national, regional, local; for levels below the national, it is a local monopoly. The term state monopoly usually means a government monopoly run by the national government.

== Characteristics of state monopolies ==
A state monopoly can be characterized by its commercial behavior not being effectively limited by the competitive pressures of private organisations. This occurs when its business activities exert an extensive influence within the market, can act autonomously of any competitors, and potential competitors are unable to successfully compete with it.

These activities have a major influence on the operational environment, when its trading activities are not subject to competitive forces inherent within free trading markets. Therefore, this results in using its market dominance and influence to its advantage, in affecting how the market evolves over a long period of time. This is especially the case if the state monopoly controls access to vital inputs essential to operating within the market. 

The high degree of autonomy and ability to act independently in the market, has been demonstrated by the ability to alter relationships with its customers to its advantage, without negatively impacting its dominant market share. A state monopoly&#x27;s ability to increase the price or quantity of goods and services provided, without a relational change in its own operating costs (coupled with maintaining this price or quantity at above a market clearing rate), demonstrates its ability to disregard any competitive forces within the market. A state monopoly also retains the ability to reduce service value, or impose restrictive terms and conditions, without experiencing a loss in market share.

== Purpose of state monopolies ==
The theoretical purpose of state monopolies is to maximise collective welfare. This is based on the idea that public administrations are not strictly aimed at profit-making. Products or services therefore can be guaranteed to consumers of that supply of that product or service under the best conditions and at prices that are comparable to the expectations of the value and characteristics of the product or service.

However, the structure of a country&#x27;s economy more broadly usually determines how state monopolies operate. In countries that are members of the OECD, sectors where there are state monopolies are usually those that are meeting the &quot;needs of utilities and public services.&quot; Whereas, in developing economies, state monopolies can disrupt healthy business competition, and in centrally controlled economies, such stifling of private competition plateaus economic growth.

The concept of public goods, as produced and distributed under state monopolies, are that they are supplied at a level independent from, or inconsistent with, the actual market demand for the good. Therefore, the price does not reflect the utility of the product or service. Under Marxist economic ideology, this advocates for a centralised production system to account for the fact this product or service should be universally available and competition &#x27;badly adapts,&#x27; to the constraints to which the supply of these products or services are subject.

Interestingly, a 2013 study found that when private options for products or services are available, welfare is more likely to be maximised. The simple rationalisation to this is that when there are more players, there is therefore more choice. More choice allows greater access to a greater number of people.

== Market power ==
A state monopoly&#x27;s market power and dominance can arise from its superior innovative capacity or greater performance. However, any of the three following factors more broadly explain a state monopoly&#x27;s existence:

* A natural monopoly endures within the market, whereby the most efficient form of meeting demand is through the creation of a single government entity.
* The state monopoly is legislated for, with legislative instruments precluding competitive activities regarding the provision of goods or services.
* A poorly contestable market exists, with competition previously operating inefficiently despite the lack of legal restrictions.

=== Evidence of exercising market power ===
The primary determinations of demonstrating the market power of state monopolies are:

* The monopoly&#x27;s economic income within the market is characterized by disproportionate returns on its existing asset base. This income would be excessive, if it were not a result of its inefficient operations.
* There is a substantial difference between best practice benchmarks within private organisations, and the state monopoly&#x27;s own productive efficiency. For example, a monopoly&#x27;s lack of productive efficiency could be resultant of gold plating of assets.
* The monopoly cross-subsidies incomes between loss-making activities and profitable activities. If the aforementioned occurs through production or pricing behaviors, this suggests usual competitive forces characteristic of competitive markets are not being applied to the state monopoly. A firm engaging in this practice under normal market conditions, would not survive in the long run.

== Examples ==
The most prominent example of the monopoly is law and the legitimate use of physical force. In many countries, the postal system is run by the government with competition forbidden by law in some or all services. Also, government monopolies on public utilities, telecommunications and railroads have historically been common, though recent decades have seen a strong privatization trend throughout the industrialized world.

In Nordic countries, some goods deemed harmful are distributed through a government monopoly. For example, in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden government-owned companies have monopolies for selling alcoholic beverages. Casinos and other institutions for gambling might also be monopolized. In Finland, the government has a monopoly to operate slot machines (see Veikkaus). Similar regimes for alcohol exist in the United States, where certain alcoholic beverage control states (ABC states), e.g. Pennsylvania and Virginia, maintain state-owned-and-operated monopolies on the sale of certain kinds of alcohol (typically distilled spirits and sometimes wine or beer). In these monopolies over harmful goods or services, the monopoly is designed to reduce consumption of the product by deliberately decreasing the efficiency of the market.

Governments often create or allow monopolies to exist and grant them patents. This limits entry and allow the patent-holding firm to earn a monopoly profit from an invention.

Health care systems where the government controls the industry and specifically prohibits competition, such as in Canada, are government monopolies.

== Reforms to enhance competition ==
Although state monopolies are sustained through legislative instruments, many major economies have seen efforts to reform the disproportionate market powers they sustain, to therefore enhance competition. This has been enacted through regulatory reforms (removing statutory restrictions to market competition) and structural reforms (including separating contestable elements of a state monopoly, and creating third party rights of access to natural monopolies).

Across all levels of governmental jurisdiction, both structural and regulatory reforms have been preferred, as it forces all market participants (both state monopolies and private industry) to respond to competitive pressures, as opposed to legislated regulatory structures. This has been observed to result in more optimal outcomes for an economy, as resource allocation is no longer directed by legislative instruments or regulatory authorities.

Despite these reform efforts to promote competitive markets, regulatory and structural reforms struggle to overcome the entrenched market dominance of state monopolies. This is resultant of advantages enjoyed by state monopolies, including first mover advantages.

== Advantages ==
The following advantages, may happen or not:

* Government monopolies tend to comply with law (tax compliance, environmental law, safety regulations)
* Prices of a good or service might be stabler, or at a set price.
* No economical dead-weight in advertising
* Greater and stabler government income, than with a state owned company in a free market
* No pressure to drive down costs (race to the bottom), which can be seen as posing bases for more ethical business
* Can take over a private monopoly judged harmful.

== Disadvantages ==
Government monopolies have traditional risks of usual monopolies:

* High prices can arise
* Abuse of market dominance
Furthermore, there are concerns that government-controlled entitles can be manipulated by political will. This can manifest through the allocation of resources for the purpose of political ends, rather than for the promotion of economic efficiency.

<text>Ralph James Scott (October 15, 1905 – August 5, 1983) was a Democratic U.S. Representative from North Carolina between 1957 and 1967.

==Biography==
Born near Pinnacle, North Carolina in Surry County, Scott attended public schools and then Wake Forest University, where he studied law. He was admitted to the bar in 1930 and practiced in Danbury, North Carolina.

Scott was elected to the North Carolina House of Representatives in 1936, serving for one term, and was a delegate to state Democratic Party conventions from 1936 to 1968. He chaired the Executive Committee of the Stokes County, North Carolina Democratic Party from 1936 to 1970, during that time serving as the solicitor of the twenty-first judicial district of North Carolina (1938–1956) and a member of the U.S. House of Representatives (for five terms, serving (January 3, 1957 – January 3, 1967).

Scott did not stand for election to a sixth term in 1966 and returned to his law practice; he lived in Danbury until his 1983 death, and is buried in the Pinnacle Baptist Church cemetery.

<text>The 1962 United States House of Representatives elections was an election for the United States House of Representatives on November 6, 1962, to elect members to serve in the 88th United States Congress. They occurred in the middle of President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s term. As in most midterm elections, Kennedy&#x27;s Democratic Party lost seats to the opposition Republican Party, but retained a majority. House Democrats were expected to lose their majority, but the resolution over the Cuban Missile Crisis just a few weeks prior led to a rebound in approval for the Democrats under President Kennedy.

The number of seats up for election went back to 435, in accordance with reapportionment and redistricting resulting from the 1960 census. The membership had been increased temporarily to 437 in 1959, providing 1 seat each for the new states of Alaska and Hawaii, while the other 435 seats continued with the reapportionment resulting from the 1950 census.

This was the last midterm election cycle until 2022 in which a Democratic president experienced net losses for his party in the House while experiencing net gains in the Senate.

==Overall results==
402 incumbent members sought reelection, but 12 were defeated in primaries and 22 defeated in the general election for a total of 368 incumbents winning.



== Special elections ==

Elections are listed by date and district.

== Alabama ==

Alabama lost 1 seat in redistricting and elected all seats at-large as a method of determining which seat to eliminate.

== Alaska ==



== Arizona ==

Arizona gained one seat and formed a new third district out of the northern part of the state.

== Arkansas ==

Arkansas lost two seats and merged the 5th and 6th districts into the other districts. 5th district incumbent Dale Alford chose to run for governor rather than face Wilbur Mills in a primary, and 6th district incumbent Catherine Dorris Norrell retired after serving out the remainder of her husband&#x27;s term.

== California ==

Eight new seats were gained in reapportionment, including 4 additional districts in Greater Los Angeles alone as well as others in San Diego, the Northern Central Valley, Alameda County, and the Central Coast, increasing the delegation from 30 to 38 seats. Seven of the new seats were won by Democrats, one by a Republican. Two Republican incumbents lost re-election to Democrats. Therefore, Democrats increased by 9 seats and Republicans decreased by 1.

== Colorado ==

== Connecticut ==

== Delaware ==

== Florida ==

Florida gained 4 new districts at reapportionment: the 3rd around Miami, the 9th in the Panhandle, the 10th around Tampa, and the 11th in Orlando and the nearby Atlantic coast.

== Georgia ==

== Hawaii ==

Hawaii gained a second seat at reapportionment and elected both seats at-large.

== Idaho ==

== Illinois ==

Illinois lost one seat at reapportionment, merging the existing 21st district into the 20th and 23rd, and the Chicago districts were realigned to give more representation to the suburbs.

== Indiana ==

== Iowa ==

Iowa lost one seat at reapportionment and divided the existing 6th district in north-central Iowa among several neighboring districts with compensating boundary changes elsewhere. Incumbent Merwin Coad chose to retire rather than run against one of the other incumbents.

== Kansas ==

Kansas lost one seat at reapportionment and redistricted from 6 to 5, combining the existing southwestern 5th and northwestern 6th districts into a single district, in which incumbents J. Floyd Breeding and Bob Dole ran against each other, and making modest boundary changes elsewhere.

== Kentucky ==

Kentucky lost one seat at reapportionment. 5th district incumbent Brent Spence elected to retire, and his district was divided between several other districts with the lion&#x27;s share going to the 4th.

== Louisiana ==

== Maine ==

Maine lost one seat at reapportionment, redistricting from 3 seats to 2 -- a 1st district containing the coastal parts of the existing 1st and 2nd districts, and a 2nd district containing the existing 3rd district and the rest of inland Maine.

== Maryland ==
Maryland gained an eighth seat at reapportionment and chose to elect it at-large.

== Massachusetts ==

Massachusetts lost two seats at reapportionment, one from each party.

== Michigan ==

Michigan gained one seat at reapportionment, which it elected at-large rather than redistricting.

== Minnesota ==

Minnesota lost one seat at reapportionment, and the 7th saw the largest change, with its territory split between the existing 2nd and 6th districts.

== Mississippi ==

Mississippi lost one seat at reapportionment, and merged the 2nd and 3rd districts without making other boundary changes.

== Missouri ==

Missouri lost one seat at reapportionment, and merged the 11th and 8th districts with compensating boundary changes to other districts.

Nebraska lost one seat at reapportionment and split the southern 1st district between the eastern 3rd and western 4th districts.

== Nevada ==

== New Hampshire ==

== New Jersey ==

New Jersey gained one seat and formed a 15th district out of parts of the existing 3rd and 5th districts around Perth Amboy without making substantial changes elsewhere.

== New Mexico ==

== New York ==

New York lost 2 seats at reapportionment; after redistricting, Long Island actually gained two seats while Manhattan lost two and Brooklyn and Upstate New York lost one each. As of 2020, this would be the last time Republicans would win the most congressional districts in New York.

== North Carolina ==

== North Dakota ==

== Ohio ==

== Oklahoma ==

== Oregon ==

== Pennsylvania ==

Three seats were lost in reapportionment, decreasing the delegation from 30 to 27 seats, with redistricting removing one seat in Philadelphia and two in central Pennsylvania.

<doc id="1341891" wikidata="Q521044" url="?curid=1341891" title="Jaguar XJ220">
<text>The Jaguar XJ220 is a two-seat supercar produced by British luxury car manufacturer Jaguar from 1992 until 1994, in collaboration with the specialist automotive and race engineering company Tom Walkinshaw Racing. The XJ220 (with catalytic converter removed) recorded a top speed of during testing by Jaguar at the Nardo test track in Italy. This made it the fastest production car from 1992 to 1993. According to Jaguar, an XJ220 prototype managed a Nürburgring lap time of 7:46.36 in 1991 which was faster than any production car lap time before it.

The XJ220 was developed from a V12-engined 4-wheel drive concept car designed by an informal group of Jaguar employees working in their spare time. The group wished to create a modern version of the successful Jaguar 24 Hours of Le Mans racing cars of the 1950s and 1960s that could be entered into FIA Group B competitions. The XJ220 made use of engineering work undertaken for Jaguar&#x27;s then current racing car family.

The initial XJ220 concept car was unveiled to the public at the 1988 British International Motor Show, held in Birmingham, England. Its positive reception prompted Jaguar to put the car into production. Approximately 1,500 deposits of £50,000 each were taken and deliveries were planned for 1992.

Engineering and emissions requirements resulted in significant changes to the specification of the XJ220, most notably the replacement of the Jaguar V12 engine by a turbocharged V6 engine. The changes to the specification and a collapse in the demand of high performance cars brought about by the early 1990s recession resulted in many buyers choosing not to exercise their purchase options. A total of just 275 cars were produced by the time production ended, each with a retail price of £470,000 in 1992, making it one of the most expensive cars at that time.

==Conception==
Racing team owner Tom Walkinshaw approached Jaguar executives and encouraged the company to enter the XJS into the 1981 European Touring Car Championship. The partnership succeeded in winning the competition in 1983. Jaguar had started to provide factory support to racing team Group 44 Racing, who were using the Jaguar-engined XJR-5 in the IMSA GT Championship, supplying V12 engines from 1983 onwards and supporting a Le Mans entry in 1984. Tom Walkinshaw and Jaguar agreed to enter the FIA Group C World Sportscar Championship and developed the XJR-6, which was powered by the same Jaguar V12 engine used by Group 44 Racing. The car was launched during the 1985 season.

TWR took over the IMSA GT Championship operation in 1988 and one model – XJR-9 – was launched to compete in both series. The XJR-9, which retained the Jaguar V12 engine, went on to win the 1988 24 Hours of Le Mans and World Sportscar Championship in the same year. The poor fuel consumption of the Jaguar V12 combined with new rules restricting refueling during races, forced the replacement of the V12 engine in the successors to the XJR-9, the XJR-10 and XJR-11. The normally-aspirated Austin Rover V64V engine, designed for the MG Metro 6R4 had recently been made redundant due to the Group B rally ban in 1987 and the design rights were for sale. The compact, lightweight and fuel efficient nature of the small-displacement, turbocharged engine was investigated by TWR. They considered it an ideal basis for a new engine to power the XJR-10 and purchased the design rights from Austin Rover Group.

Jaguar and their Director of Engineering, Jim Randle, felt these racing cars were too far removed from the product available to the general public, especially with the rule changes that mandated the replacement of the Jaguar V12 engine in the forthcoming XJR-10 and XJR-11 racing cars. Therefore, a project was initiated to design and build a car capable of winning Le Mans &quot;in house&quot;, just as the C-Type and D-Type had done. The groundwork for the project was undertaken by Randle over Christmas 1987, when he produced a 1:4 scale cardboard model of a potential Group B racing car.

The cardboard model was taken into the Jaguar styling studio and two mock-ups were produced. One was said to be reminiscent of the Porsche 956, the other took elements of the then current XJ41 project and Malcolm Sayer&#x27;s work on the stillborn XJ13 racing car. The second design, by Keith Helfet, was chosen as it was &quot;more obviously Jaguar in its look&quot;.

The project still had no official support, leaving Randle no option but to put together a team of volunteers to work evenings and weekends in their own time. The team came to be known as &quot;The Saturday Club&quot; and consisted of twelve volunteers. To justify the resources consumed by the project, the XJ220 needed to provide meaningful data to the engineers on handling, aerodynamics – particularly at high speeds – and aluminium structures. These requirements, together with FIA racing regulations and various government regulations governing car design and safety, influenced the overall design and engineering direction of the car.
==Concept car==
The FIA Group B regulations steered the concept towards a mid-engine, all-wheel-drive layout, with a Jaguar V12 engine as the power source. The concept car was designed and built at very little cost to Jaguar, as Randle called in favours from component suppliers and engineering companies he and Jaguar had worked with in the past. In return he offered public recognition for their assistance and dangled the possibility of future contracts from Jaguar.

The name XJ220 was chosen as a continuation of the naming of the XK120, which referred to the top speed of the model in miles per hour. The concept car had a targeted top speed of so the name became XJ220. The XK120, like the XJ220, was an aluminium-bodied sports car and when launched was the fastest production car in the world.

===Engine and transmission===
Jaguar&#x27;s engine designer Walter Hassan had previously developed a 48-valve variant of their V12 engine specifically for motorsport use. It featured a double overhead camshaft layout with four valves per cylinder, compared with the single overhead camshaft and two valves per cylinder of the production engine, which was used in the XJ and XJS models at the time.

TWR had manufactured a number of these racing V12 engines during the 1980s and they had been raced competitively, with a 7-litre version of this engine featuring in the Le Mans-winning XJR-9. Five of these engines still existed, all of which were fitted with dry sump lubrication. One of five of these engines was chosen and considered to be especially useful as the dry sump would lower the vehicle&#x27;s centre of gravity. The displacement of the V12 was set at 6.2 litres (6,222 cc) for the XJ220. The engine fitted to the XJ220 concept had titanium connecting rods.

Jaguar had little experience with four-wheel drive systems at the time, having previously only produced rear-wheel drive cars. Randle approached Tony Rolt&#x27;s company, FF Developments to design the transmission and four-wheel drive system for the XJ220, with Rolt&#x27;s son Stuart running the project. Tony Rolt was the Technical Director of Ferguson Research, where he was heavily involved in the design of the four-wheel drive system used in the Jensen FF, the first sports car to be fitted with such a system. Tony Rolt also had a long involvement with Jaguar, winning the 1953 24 Hours of Le Mans with the factory works team driving the C-Type.

The mid-mounted engine complicated the design of the four-wheel drive system and an innovative solution was needed to get power from the mid-mounted rear engine to the front wheels. The chosen design took the front-wheel drive from the central differential on the rear transaxle and sent it through the V in the centre of the engine using a quill drive, before joining an inverted differential. The clutch was a twin-plate unit designed by AP Racing.

===Bodywork and interior===
The design brief for the exterior restricted the use of aerodynamic aids and aimed for a simple yet clean and functional body similar to classic Jaguar sports cars, such as the D-Type and E-Type. Drag and lift were limited at the envisioned ground clearance for road use, but the design allowed for additional downforce when the car was set up for racing. The body produced around of downforce at . The design was also intended to have a variable rear wing that folded into the bodywork at lower speeds. Aerodynamic work was undertaken at the Motor Industry Research Association wind tunnel using a 1:4 scale model, as the project was unable to budget for a full-scale mock-up.

The bodywork for the concept car displayed in 1988 was hand built from aluminium by Park Sheet Metal, a specialist automotive engineering company that manufactures concept cars and low-volume niche models for various manufacturers, including Bentley. QCR Motors LTD undertook final painting of the body in silver. The concept also featured electrically operated scissor doors and a transparent engine cover to show off the V12 engine.

The concept car had a Connolly Leather-trimmed interior trimmed by Callow &amp; Maddox and was fitted with front and rear heated windscreens, electric windows, air conditioning, heated electrically adjustable seats and an Alpine CD player. The dashboard was supplied by Veglia.

===Chassis===
The chassis was manufactured from aluminium using Alcan&#x27;s bonded aluminium structure vehicle technology (ASVT) and had a wheelbase of . The design for the chassis featured rear wheel steering and packaged the fuel tank behind the centre bulkhead. Suspension design largely focused on road use, but a good compromise for racing use was achieved and the suspension height was adjustable. The concept car was fitted with a four-channel anti-lock braking system.

The concept car was larger than the production model at in length and was wide. It weighed .

===Launch===
The concept car was completed in the early hours of 18 October 1988, the day it was due to be unveiled at the British International Motor Show, being held at the National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham. The vehicle was completed at 03:00 GMT, moved to Jaguar&#x27;s stand at 06:00 GMT and unveiled at 11:00 GMT.

Jaguar&#x27;s marketing department had allocated space on their stand at the motor show for the XJ220, but had not seen the vehicle until its arrival. Jaguar chairman John Egan and Roger Putnam, who was in charge of Jaguar&#x27;s racing activities, were shown the vehicle the week before the motor show and signed off on the concept, allowing its unveiling. The car received an overwhelmingly positive reception by public and press and a number of wealthy Jaguar enthusiasts handed over blank cheques to secure a purchase option should the XJ220 concept go into production. Ferrari&#x27;s display of their F40 flagship model at the same event was overshadowed, as an estimated 90,000 additional visitors came to see the XJ220.

The XJ220 was not initially intended to be a production car, but following the reception of the concept and financial interest from serious buyers, a feasibility study was carried out by teams from TWR and Jaguar. The conclusion was that such a car would be technically feasible (subject to engineering changes) and that it would be financially viable. The announcement of a limited production run of 220 to 350 cars was made on 20 December 1989. The list price on 1 January 1990 was £290,000 exclusive of value-added tax (VAT), options and delivery charges, but by 1992 that had increased considerably owing to indexation of contracts. The offer was four times oversubscribed and deposits of £50,000 exclusive of (VAT) were taken from around 1,400 customers. First deliveries were planned for mid-1992.
==Production version==
Jaguar were unable to develop the XJ220 in-house as the available engineering resources were committed to working on the XJ and XJS models. Jaguar and TWR had an existing joint venture, JaguarSport Ltd. formed in 1987 to produce racing cars. Jaguar&#x27;s board made the decision that subject to contractual agreement, TWR and JaguarSport would be responsible for the XJ220. JaguarSport formed a new company, Project XJ220 Ltd., specifically to develop and build the XJ220.

The team that would determine the necessary engineering work and assess the car&#x27;s financial viability was put in place during mid-1989, working from the TWR workshops. Mike Moreton headed the team, joining TWR to run the XJ220 project. Moreton came from Ford Motorsport where he led the team responsible for the Ford Sierra RS500 Cosworth, and was a project manager for the Ford RS200 Group B rally car program. Richard Owen was appointed chief designer and the remainder of the team was made up of Jaguar and TWR staff, including Pete Dodd, the only member of the group of twelve responsible for the XJ220 concept. The exterior and interior designers who had worked on the XJ220 prototype, Keith Helfet and Nick Hull, rejoined the project when it became clear that more design work would be needed.

===Development===
The development team looked at the two principal competitors, the Ferrari F40 and the Porsche 959. These were powered by compact, lightweight engines; both the Ferrari and the Porsche used forced induction to obtain high power outputs from small-displacement engines. Ferrari used a twin-turbocharged V8 engine that was rated at whilst Porsche used a twin-turbocharged flat-six engine rated at , resulting in cars that were significantly lighter and smaller than the XJ220 concept: the Ferrari was lighter by and shorter, whilst the Porsche was lighter and shorter. The Porsche&#x27;s specifications were closer to the Jaguar&#x27;s, with all-wheel drive and a luxurious interior. By comparison, the rear-wheel drive Ferrari had a very basic interior, with no carpets, door handles or a stereo.

===Engine===
The production version of the XJ220 used a twin-turbocharged V6 engine, which was given the designation &quot;Jaguar/TWR JV6&quot; Jaguar JRV-6 engine . This engine, which replaced the Jaguar V12 engine featured in the concept car, was a heavily redesigned and significantly altered version of the Austin Rover V64V V6 engine. The decision to change the engine was based on engine weight and dimensions, as well as environmental emission considerations. Use of the shorter V6 engine design allowed the wheelbase of the XJ220 to be shortened and its weight to be reduced; the V12 engine was definitively ruled out when it was determined it would have difficulty at simultaneously meeting emissions legislations.

TWR purchased the rights to the V64V engine from Austin Rover in 1989 and developed a completely new turbocharged engine, codenamed JV6, under the auspices of Allan Scott, with proportions roughly similar to the V64V, and suitable for sports car racing. As the V64V was originally naturally aspirated, it was necessary to redesign all parts of the engine to accommodate forced induction. A few of the changes included increasing the displacement to 3.5 litres, strengthening the internals and adding two Garrett TO3 turbochargers. The JV6 engine would first be used in the JaguarSport XJR-10 and XJR-11 racing cars; its compact dimensions and low weight made it an ideal candidate for the XJ220. The engine had a 90° bank angle, four valves per cylinder and belt-driven double overhead camshafts.

The V64V engine chosen had a short but successful career as a purpose-designed racing car engine. It was designed by Cosworth engine designer David Wood for Austin Rover Group&#x27;s Metro derived Group B rally car, the MG Metro 6R4. The redesign work necessary to create the Jaguar/TWR JV6 engine was undertaken by Andrew Barnes, TWR&#x27;s Powertrain Manager, and also involved Swiss engine builder Max Heidegger, who had designed and built the race engines used in the XJR-10 and XJR-11 racing cars.

The XJ220&#x27;s engine had a bore x stroke of , dry sump lubrication, multi point fuel injection with dual injectors and Zytek electronic engine management. The engine was manufactured with an aluminium cylinder block and aluminium cylinder heads with steel connecting rods and crankshaft. In the standard state of tune, it was rated at a power output of at 7,200 rpm and torque of at 4,500 rpm. The XJ220 could accelerate from 0– in 3.6 seconds and could attain a top speed of . &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; tested a top speed of , 0– acceleration in 4.8 seconds and 12.4 seconds for the standing .

The XJ220&#x27;s exhaust system consists of two catalytic converters, which reduce the power output of the engine. During testing at the Nardò Ring in Italy, one XJ220 had its catalytic converters removed and its rev limit increased to 7,900 rpm; these modifications increased the car&#x27;s power output by and the car was then driven by 1990 Le Mans Winner Martin Brundle to a top speed of . Owing to the circular nature of the track, some (including the British car magazines Top Gear and Autocar) say a speed of is equivalent to on a straight, level road. However, on other tracks it performed differently; when top speed was tested on a straight level road by &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; it only amounted to , it was slower than the Bugatti EB 110 at the same event and the Ruf CTR tested there in 1987. The V64V engine had the additional benefit of being very economical for such a powerful petrol engine, according to Jaguar it was capable of achieving . In contrast, the Jaguar saloon having the smallest engine of the time, the XJ6 3.2 could only achieve around .

The engine was manufactured and built at the new purpose-built facility in Kidlington, Oxfordshire. TWR invested heavily in a state of the art machining facility capable of servicing all of its race and road car projects. The facility was initially setup to produce the XJ220&#x27;s engine under Simon Lockwood, an ex-March Engineering suspension specialist.

===Transmission===
All-wheel drive was decided against early in the development process, for a number of reasons. It was thought rear-wheel drive would be adequate in the majority of situations, that the additional complexity of the four-wheel drive system would hinder the development process and potentially be problematic for the customer. FF Developments were contracted to provide the gearbox/transaxle assembly, modifying their all-wheel drive transaxle assembly from the XJ220 concept into a pure rear-wheel drive design for the production car. The transaxle featured a viscous coupling limited slip differential to improve traction.

The transmission featured triple-cone synchromeshing on first and second gears to handle rapid starts, whilst remaining relatively easy for the driver to engage and providing positive feel.

AP Racing provided an diameter clutch.

===Exterior===
The exterior retained the aluminium body panels of the XJ220 concept, but for the production cars Abbey Panels of Coventry were contracted to manufacture the body shells. The scissor doors were dropped for the production model and significant redesign work was carried out on the design when the wheelbase and overall length of the car was altered. Geoff Lawson, design director at Jaguar at the time, took a greater interest in the car and insisted the design had to be seen as a Jaguar if it were to be successful in promoting the company. Keith Helfet returned to undertake the necessary redesign work mandated by the change in the wheelbase, which was reduced by .
The turbocharged engine required larger air intakes to feed the two intercoolers. Situated between the doors and the rear wheels, the air intakes were larger on the production version of the XJ220 than on the concept car. A number of small design changes for the body were tested in the wind tunnel; the final version had a drag coefficient of with downforce of at . The XJ220 was one of the first road cars to intentionally use underbody airflow and the venturi effect to generate downforce. Additionally, the XJ220 could be ordered with optional BBS wheels for improved brake ventilation and aesthetics.

The rear lights used on the production XJ220 were sourced from the Rover 200.

===Chassis===
The production model utilised the same Alcan bonded honeycomb aluminium structure vehicle technology (ASVT) as the concept car for the chassis. The chassis design featured two box section rails which acted as the suspension mounting points and would provide an energy absorbing structure in the event of a frontal impact; these were successfully tested at speeds up to . An integral roll cage formed part of the chassis and monocoque, providing additional structural rigidity for the car and allowing the XJ220 to easily pass stringent crash testing.

The rear-wheel steering was dropped from the production car to save weight and reduce complexity, as was the height adjustable suspension and active aerodynamic technology. The suspension fitted to the production model consisted of front and rear independent suspension, double unequal length wishbones, inboard coil springs and anti-roll bars, with Bilstein gas-filled dampers.

The braking system was designed by AP Racing and featured ventilated and cross-drilled discs of diameter at the front and diameter at the rear. The calipers were four-piston aluminium units. JaguarSport designed the handbrake, which has separate calipers acting on the rear brake discs. Feedback from enthusiasts and racing drivers resulted in the decision to drop the anti-lock braking system from the production car. The braking system was installed without a servo, but a number of owners found the brakes to be difficult to operate when cold and subsequently requested a servo to be fitted.

A rack and pinion steering was fitted, with 2.5 turns lock to lock; the steering had power assistance. The Bridgestone Expedia S.01 asymmetric uni-directional tyres were specially developed for the XJ220. Rally alloy wheel specialists Speedline Corse designed the alloy wheels, these are both wider and have a larger diameter on the rear wheels; wheels are fitted to the front and are fitted at the rear, with 255/55 ZR17 tyres at the front and 345/35 ZR18 tyres at the rear.

===Interior===
The interior was designed for two passengers and trimmed in leather. Leather trimmed sports seats were fitted together with electric windows and electrically adjustable heated mirrors. The dashboard unusually curves round and carries onto the drivers door, with a secondary instrument binnacle containing four analogue gauges, including a clock and voltmeter fitted on the front of the drivers door. Air conditioning and green tinted glazing was also fitted.

The luggage space consists of a small boot directly behind and above the rear portion of the engine, also trimmed in leather.

===Production===
The car was assembled in a purpose-built factory at Wykham Mill, Bloxham near Banbury in Oxfordshire. Diana, Princess of Wales officially opened the factory and unveiled the first production XJ220 in October, 1991.

The JV6 engines used in the Jaguar racing cars were produced by Swiss engineer Max Heidegger, but delivering the number of engines required for the XJ220 program was considered beyond his capacity. TWR formed a division, TWR Road Engines, to manage the design, development, construction and testing of the engines for the production cars. The JV6 engine used in the XJ220 featured little commonality with the engines Heidegger built for use in the XJR racing cars, being specifically engineered to meet performance and in particular, the European emissions requirements, which the race engines didn&#x27;t have to meet.

FF Developments, in addition to the design work undertaken on the gearbox and rear axle assembly, was given responsibility for the manufacture of these components. The aluminium chassis components and body panels were manufactured and assembled at the Abbey Panels factory in Coventry, before the body in white was delivered to the assembly plant at Bloxham. The car, including chassis and body components, consists of approximately 3,000 unique parts.

The first customer delivery occurred in June 1992 and production rates averaged one car per day. The last XJ220 rolled off the production line in April 1994; the factory was then transferred to Aston Martin and used for the assembly of the Aston Martin DB7 until 2004.
==Guinness World Record==

Jaguar had performed high speed testing of the pre-production XJ220 with chassis number 004 at Fort Stockton, Texas in 1991 and recorded a maximum speed of , which was faster than any production car at the time.

According to &quot;Car&quot; magazine, Jaguar hoped to attain with the XJ220, mainly for promotional reasons. The decision was made to undertake further high speed testing in June 1992 at the Nardò Ring in Italy, with one journalist from &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; and one from the &quot;Car&quot; magazine together with a photographer and a BBC cameraman recording for BBC &quot;Top Gear&quot; as independent witnesses. None of the independent witnesses understood how Jaguar&#x27;s testing equipment worked. The pre-production XJ220 with chassis number 009 would be driven by Martin Brundle, who had won the 1990 24 Hours of Le Mans driving the XJR-12.

The initial high speed runs, with the car configured in standard trim (catalytic converters connected, lower rev-limit of 7,400 rpm) achieved a maximum recorded speed of , the same speed as previously reached at Fort Stockton during testing. Brundle reported that the car was hitting the rev limiter during the run.

The rev limiter was increased to 7,900 rpm and the catalytic converters were removed in favour of installing straight-through exhaust pipes for a second series of runs, and it was this attempt which resulted in the maximum recorded speed of . It was estimated that the removal of the catalytic converters, which were not mandated in Europe at the time, increased the power output by around .

Guinness Book of World Records recorded the 217.1 mph run as the official fastest speed ever attained by a standard production car, this figure was reported in the 1994 to 1999 editions of the Guinness Book of World Records. Guinness World Records then recognised the McLaren F1 driven by Andy Wallace which achieved a maximum recorded speed of in March 1998 (also with rev-limiter increased) as the fastest standard production car in the world.
==Reception and sales==
Press coverage of the XJ220 concept in 1988 was overwhelmingly positive and contributed to the decision in 1989 to put the XJ220 into limited production. The production version of the car was first shown to the public in October 1991, at the Tokyo Motor Show. The first car was launched for press review in Autumn 1991.

&quot;Autocar&quot;″s Andrew Frankel was the first journalist to road-test the car and reported: &quot;Savage acceleration really is a given here. What&#x27;s really incredible about the XJ220 is its ability to provide such performance in a way that never, ever intimidates.&quot; He was particularly impressed with the throttle response, the driver&#x27;s ability to control the performance of the car very precisely, and the way in which the engine delivers its power progressively rather than in one short burst.

&quot;Performance Car&quot; reviewer John Barker was also impressed with the performance as well as the ride and stability of the car, writing &quot;The V6 has a rumbly, loping note which, in league with a remarkably supple ride, belies the speed we are travelling at. I glance to the speedo and have trouble believing that it is indicating 170 mph.&quot; Barker was also impressed with the engineering, saying &quot;this car is catalysed, fully homologated and has passed the same tests that a Volvo needs before going on sale&quot;, going on to discuss how the vehicle looked at home on the racetrack thanks to the design. &quot;Autocar&quot;″s verdict was &quot;Right now, the XJ220 gives us a standard by which all other fast cars can be compared. For the few who will actually own and, hopefully, use their XJ220s, the fact that they are in command of the most accomplished supercar ever made should suffice.&quot;

Ergonomics and ride were also praised by Gavin Green in &quot;Car&quot; August 1992: &quot;you sit straight ahead, pedals and four-spoked Nardi wheel beautifully positioned. There&#x27;s none of the askew nonsense that plagues Italian supercars...forward visibility is panoramic and side vision is good. Rear vision is better than on some other mid-engined monsters.&quot; He went on to describe the ride: &quot;The XJ220 rides over knobbly tarmac with extraordinary dexterity...the big Jag rides urban blacktop better than many sports saloons, never mind supercars.&quot;

In a comparison test published in the &quot;Car&quot; March 1994 issue, the testers liked the &quot;sheer blistering pace, looks and a superb cabin&quot; but its size, the doors not opening far enough and handling were criticised: &quot;If there&#x27;s a more evil device on our roads, I wouldn&#x27;t like to find it, for the XJ220 suffers from immense initial understeer followed by violent and snappy pendulous oversteer.&quot;
Most disappointing was the engine, at idle it sounded &quot;like someone&#x27;s clanking a bucket of rusty nails together&quot;. 
While its rival, the Bugatti EB 110, impressed the testers, the XJ220 disappointed: &quot;The Jaguar is outmoded and lacks soul: it looks like a cynical marketing exercise and feels it in its lack of purity and coherence.&quot;

Motoring journalists have been critical of its size, being too big for a two-seater with virtually no luggage space, too wide to fit through traffic restrictors or to drive comfortably on most roads. The very heavy unassisted steering and pedals, underwhelming brakes without ABS, poor directional stability and &quot;terrible visibility&quot; were also disliked.
Most criticised was the behavior at low revs, the engine sound was described with words like &quot;a pail of nuts and bolts being poured through a Magimix&quot;, rattling clutch, grinding transmission, crackling chassis, rumbling and groaning body contributing to the impression of imminent breakdown. Driving in the city was sheer torture, worsened by the first gear being far too tall for stop-and-go traffic.

Sales performance was disappointing. Jaguar had intended to produce up to 350 cars, but production ceased in 1994 with 281 production cars produced, not all of which had been sold; some left-hand drive examples were still available in 1997. The recession combined with the drastic changes to the production version left many of those who placed a deposit unable to complete the purchase. The index linking of contracts exacerbated the issue, and added almost £200,000 to the purchase price between early 1990 and mid-1992. The McLaren F1 suffered from similarly poor sales performance, with just 71 cars sold against McLaren&#x27;s target of 300. McLaren&#x27;s F1 program eventually turned a small profit due to the sale and servicing of the 28 GTR racing variants produced.

Jaguar customers attempting to withdraw from their contracted purchases were given the option to buy themselves out of their contracts, but by 1995, the issue had resulted in legal action as buyers claimed the specification changes rendered any contracts void. Jaguar produced evidence clearly demonstrating that the vehicle specification shown in the contract matched the vehicle that was delivered and the presiding judge, John Donaldson, quickly ruled in Jaguar&#x27;s favour. The last of the unsold XJ220s were sold for £127,550 plus VAT in 1997. While never officially approved for sale in the United States, the XJ220 was approved under the Show or Display exemption by 2001.

The XJ220 appeared in later motoring press articles; &quot;Evo&quot; journalist David Vivian, writing a head-to-head test between the XJ220 and the Lamborghini Murciélago in 2009, commented that &quot;going ludicrously fast seems trivially easy&quot; and acknowledged that the decision to change the V12 engine for a turbocharged V6 engine &quot;would garner more acceptance now&quot;. The Lamborghini delivered the far better driving experience however: &quot;After the XJ220, it’s almost absurdly agile&quot;, &quot;the big difference, and it is massive, is how much more exciting, entertaining and accessible the LP640 is to drive.&quot;
==Racing==
A racing version was introduced at the 1993 Autosport International motor show; given the model name XJ220-C, it was built to compete in FISA GT racing. The XJ220-C driven by Win Percy won its first race, a round of the BRDC National Sports GT Challenge at Silverstone.

Three works XJ220-Cs were entered in the 1993 24 Hours of Le Mans race, in the newly created Grand Touring Class. John Nielsen, David Brabham and David Coulthard won the GT class, beating Porsche by two laps; the other two cars retired, both through engine failure. However, the class win was revoked when the Jaguar XJ220-C was controversially disqualified for failing to run with catalytic converters. The Jaguars had passed scrutiny and completed the first day of qualifying when senior steward Alain Bertaut complained that Jaguar were not running catalytic converters. The cars had been entered under the IMSA GT category and Bertaut claimed that they needed to run with catalysts. The cars ran in the race under appeal. International Motor Sports Association (IMSA) officials wrote to the Automobile Club de l&#x27;Ouest (ACO) (English: Automobile Club of the West), organisers of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, confirming that the XJ220-Cs entered had complied with IMSA rules. Jaguar won their appeal (supported by the FIA) but were nevertheless disqualified, as the ACO confirmed that the appeal had not been lodged in time.

Four cars were entered in the GT1 class for the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans, two by PC Automotive Jaguar and two by Chamberlain Engineering, though the latter did not run their cars. Neither team had Jaguar or TWR backing; both of PC Automotive&#x27;s cars were outpaced by the new McLaren F1 GTR. Richard Piper, Tiff Needell and James Weaver were holding fourth position until an engine failure during the night, ending their race, whilst the second XJ220-C retired after leaving the road.

A lightly modified road-going XJ220 was also entered in the Italian GT Championship in 1993, although without factory support; where it raced in Martini livery. This entry predated the factory&#x27;s Le Mans entry.

The XJ220-C was promoted in the United States in the-made-for-TV &quot;Fast Masters&quot; racing series at Indianapolis Raceway Park, airing on ESPN in the summer of 1993 and featuring invited drivers over 50 years old in an elimination format. The competition became a farce due to the cars&#x27; viscous Limited-slip differentials proving ill-suited for the oval track the organizers had chosen, producing strange handling characteristics that resulted in several crashes.

TWR developed a further six road cars called the XJ220-S, featuring one-piece carbon-fibre-reinforced polymer front and rear bodywork; the engine was tuned to . The XJ220-S models did away with the hidden headlamps of the original and instead opted for perspex covered lights. The S models were essentially road-going versions of the XJ220-C race car and as a result featured a much simpler race-orientated interior with kevlar seats and the removal of the leather trim. Colin Goodwin, a writer for &quot;Autocar&quot;, tested an XJ220-S in June 1995 at Millbrook Proving Ground and set the lap record at an average speed of .
==Jaguar XJ220 Pininfarina==
The Jaguar XJ220 Pininfarina is a special XJ220 built in 1995 for the Sultan of Brunei and his brother Prince Jefri, who commissioned a number of rare and one-off heavily modified cars based on expensive luxury cars. This car was modified by Pininfarina with the redesigned body being manufactured by coach maker Coggiola with modifications including fixed headlights, new rear lights with a redesigned double-vane rear wing, and a new interior package. The car also comes with dark green exterior paint.

<text>The 1960 United States House of Representatives elections was an election for the United States House of Representatives on November 8, 1960, to elect members to serve in the 87th United States Congress. They coincided with the election of President John F. Kennedy and was the first house election to feature all 50 current U.S. states.

There were 437 seats, the most in U.S. history: 435 from the reapportionment in accordance with the 1950 census, and one seat for each of the new states of Alaska and Hawaii.

Although Democrats retained control, it was the first time since 1908 that an incoming president&#x27;s party lost seats in the House, which would not happen again until 1988.

This was the most recent election cycle in which no new female representatives were elected to the House.

==Overall results==
405 incumbent members sought reelection, but 5 were defeated in primaries and 25 defeated in the general election for a total of 375 incumbents winning.

<text>Jean Gebser (; August 20, 1905 as Hans Karl Hermann Rudolph Gebser – May 14, 1973) was a Swiss philosopher, linguist, and poet who described the structures of human consciousness.

==Biography==
Gebser was born Hans Karl Hermann Rudolph Gebser in Posen in Imperial Germany (now Poland). His father was lawyer Frederich Gebser and mother was Margaretha Grundmann. He was a cousin of World War I-era chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg.

He left Germany in 1929, living for a time in Italy and then in France. He then moved to Spain, mastered the Spanish language in a few months and entered the Spanish Civil Service where he rose to become a senior official in the Ministry of Education. 
Before the Spanish Civil War began, he moved to Paris, and then to Southern France. It was here that he changed his German first name &quot;Hans&quot; to the French &quot;Jean.&quot; He lived in Paris for a while but saw the unavoidability of a German invasion. He fled to Switzerland in 1939, escaping only hours before the border was closed. He spent the rest of his life near Bern, where he did most of his writing. Even late in life, Gebser travelled widely in India, the Far East, and the Americas, and wrote half a dozen more books. He was also a published poet.

Gebser died in Wabern bei Bern on May 14, 1973 &quot;with a soft and knowing smile.&quot; His personal letters and publications are held at the Gebser Archives at the University of Oklahoma History of Science Collections, Norman, Oklahoma, Bizzel Libraries.

==Consciousness in transition==
Gebser&#x27;s major thesis was that human consciousness is in transition, and that these transitions are &quot;mutations&quot; and not continuous. These jumps or transformations involve structural changes in both mind and body. Gebser held that previous consciousness structures continue to operate parallel to the emergent structure.

Consciousness is &quot;presence&quot;, or &quot;being present&quot;:
Each consciousness structure eventually becomes deficient, and is replaced by a following structure. The stress and chaos in Europe from 1914 to 1945 were the symptoms of a structure of consciousness that was at the end of its effectiveness, and which heralded the birth of a new form of consciousness. The first evidence he witnessed was in the novel use of language and literature. He modified this position in 1943 so as to include the changes which were occurring in the arts and sciences at that time.

His thesis of the failure of one structure of consciousness alongside the emergence of a new one led him to inquire as to whether such had not occurred before. His work, &quot;Ursprung und Gegenwart&quot; is the result of that inquiry. It was published in various editions from 1949 to 1953, and translated into English as &quot;The Ever-Present Origin&quot;. Working from the historical evidence of almost every major field, (e.g., poetry, music, visual arts, architecture, philosophy, religion, physics and the other natural sciences, etc.) Gebser saw traces of the emergence (which he called &quot;efficiency&quot;) and collapse (&quot;deficiency&quot;) of various structures of consciousness throughout history.

==Structures of consciousness==
Gebser distinguished the following structures:
# The &quot;archaic&quot; structure
# The &quot;magic&quot; structure
# The &quot;mythical&quot; structure
# The &quot;mental&quot; structure
# The &quot;integral&quot; structure

===Archaic structure===
The archaic structure is the first structure of consciousness to emerge from the &quot;ever-present origin&quot;:
No direct information on this structure is available; it is inferred from writings from later times. It is zero-dimensional; consciousness is only &quot;a dimly lit mist devoid of shadows&quot;. It is not individual, but &quot;was totally identical with the whole&quot;:
===Magic structure===
In the magical structure events, objects and persons are magically related. Symbols and statues do not just &quot;represent&quot; those events, objects and persons, but &quot;are&quot; those same objects and persons.
Gebser symbolizes this &quot;one-dimensional&quot; consciousness structure by the space-less, time-less &quot;point&quot;. Unlike the archaic structure in which there is a &quot;perfect identity of man and universe&quot;, man is aware of nature as something within his community to which it must &quot;listen&quot; and out of which it must act in order to survive.

===Mythical structure===
Gebser symbolizes the &quot;two-dimensional&quot; mythical structure by the circle and cyclical time, based on man&#x27;s discovery of the rhythmic recurrence of natural events and of his inner reflections on his experience of those events. &quot;...[W]hereas the distinguishing characteristic of the magic structure was the emergent awareness of nature, the essential characteristic of the mythical structure is the emergent awareness of soul.&quot; In the mythical structure events, objects and persons are woven together in stories. Mythologies give coherence to consciousness. An important element in myth is &quot;polarity&quot;; the etymology of &quot;myth&quot; itself implies both speaking (mouth, &quot;mythos&quot;) and silence (mute, &quot;&quot;). Gebser explains that polarity makes myth particularly foreign to the mental consciousness structure: &quot;Only when we acknowledge both meanings of the root can we discern the fundamental nature of the mythical structure. Only when taken together as an elemental ambivalence, and not a rational contradiction, are they constitutive for the mythical structure.&quot; &quot;Only a mental world requires laws; the mythical world, secure in the polarity, neither knows nor needs them.&quot;

===Mental structure===
The mental structure appropriates events, objects and persons by the use of logic. In its efficient form, the mental structure is &quot;three-dimensional&quot;. Gebser symbolizes it with the &quot;triangle&quot;, which illustrates a &quot;trinity&quot; of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis: &quot;the base of the triangle with its two points lying in opposition represents the dual contraries or antinomies which are unified at the point or apex.&quot; For Gebser, this is the essence of &quot;the emergence of directed or discursive thought&quot; with which Western science would be built. &quot;It required centuries to sufficiently devitalize and demythologize the word so that it was able to express distinct concepts freed from the wealth of imagery, as well as to reach the rationalistic extreme where the word, once a power [magic] and later an image [myth], was degraded to a mere formula.&quot;

The deficient form of the mental structure Gebser called the &#x27;rational&#x27; structure. The rational structure of awareness seeks to deny the other structures with its claim that humans are exclusively rational.

The rational structure is known for its extremes as evidenced in various &quot;nothing but...&quot; statements. Extreme materialism claims that &quot;everything is nothing but matter — atoms&quot;. Philosophy, the love of wisdom, is replaced with instrumental reason, the ability &quot;to make&quot;. Contemplation—looking inward—is devalued in relation to what one &quot;can do&quot;. &quot;Wise men&quot; fall out of favor and are replaced by the &quot;man of action.&quot; Successes in technologically re-shaping matter offer solutions to some problems but also give rise to problems of their own making. Mechanized slaughter of two world wars and the new atomic weapons exemplified and symbolized the expression of the ontology of the rational/mental structure. Living becomes hard to bear in such a consciousness structure.

Some saw the cause of this despair as a lack of values or ethics. Gebser saw that it is the very consciousness structure itself which has played out to its inherent end. He saw that its metaphysical presumptions necessarily led to this ethical dead end. A &quot;value-free&quot; ontology like materialism leads of necessity to living &quot;without value&quot;. Any attempt to remedy the situation by a return to &quot;values&quot; would ultimately fail. But it was through this very quagmire of &quot;the decline of the West&quot; that Gebser saw the emergence of a new structure of consciousness which he termed the integral.

===Integral structure===
The integral consciousness structure was made evident by a new relationship to space and time. In the second part of his work, Gebser set out to document the evidence that he saw throughout various human endeavors. Of note here were the incorporation of time in physics, the attempts to &quot;paint&quot; time in the visual arts and the like. Gebser noticed that the integral structure of consciousness was largely witnessed as the irruption of time into the &quot;fixed-reality&quot; of the mental structure. For Gebser, dualistically opposed and &quot;static&quot; categories of Being gave way to transparency.

Transparency points to how it is that the one is &quot;given-through&quot; and always &quot;along-with&quot; the other. For centuries, time was viewed as having distinct categories of past, present and future. These categories were said to be wholly distinct one from the other. Of course, this created all kinds of difficulties regarding how beings moved from one category to the other — from present to past, for example. What integral awareness notices is that though we may utilize categorical thinking for various purposes, we also have the realization that time is an indivisible whole. That various beings in the present are crystallized from the past, and which also extend into the future. In fact, without already having an integral awareness, one could have no notion of time as &quot;past&quot; or &quot;present&quot;, etc. Without the awareness of the whole, one would be stuck in a kind of &quot;not-knowing&quot; of an always only &quot;now&quot; not connected to any sense of past or future. Even the mental awareness which divides this whole into distinct categories could not have become aware of those categories without an awareness which was already integral. Thus, awareness is already integral.

Gebser introduced the notion of &quot;presentiation&quot; which means to make something present through transparency. An aspect of integral awareness is the presentation, or &quot;making present&quot;, of the various structures of awareness. Rather than allowing only one (rational) structure to be valid, all structures are recognized, presented, one through the other. This awareness of and acceptance of the various structures enables one to live through the various structures rather than to be subjected to them (&quot;lived by&quot; them in German).

To realize the various structures within one&#x27;s language and habits, and even within one&#x27;s own life and self is a difficult task. But Gebser says that it is a task that we cannot choose to ignore without losing ourselves. This means that our so-called &quot;objective thinking&quot; is not without consequences, is not innocent. That to live &quot;objectively&quot; means to give life to the horrors of nihilism combined with the know how of highly &quot;efficient&quot; weapons. It means that &quot;objectivity&quot; gets applied to &quot;engineering humanity&quot; whether it is in the behavioral sciences or the physical sciences. He asks of us whether or not we have had our fill of those horrors yet. Are we willing to settle into the comfort of our daily life or to take on the process of change? He offers as a guiding note that just as there is also a time to act, there is also the much neglected time of contemplation. In a world where &quot;know-how&quot; is overvalued, simple &quot;knowing&quot; must also be nurtured. Furthermore, he knew that thought was never simply a mental exercise restricted to one&#x27;s writing. He calls upon us to realize that &quot;we are what we think&quot;.

==Terminology==

===Discontinuity===
Gebser cautioned against using terms like &quot;evolution&quot;, &quot;progression&quot;, or &quot;development&quot; to describe the changes in structures of consciousness that he described.

Gebser traces the evidence for the transformations of the structure of consciousness as they are concretized in historical artifacts. He sought to avoid calling this process &quot;evolutionary&quot;, since any such notion was illusory when applied to the &quot;unfolding of consciousness.&quot; Gebser emphasized that biological evolution is an &quot;enclosing&quot; process which particularizes a species to a limited environment. The unfolding of awareness is, by contrast, an opening-up.

Any attempt to give a direction or goal to the unfolding of awareness is illusory in that it is based upon a limited, mentalistic, linear notion of time. Gebser notes that &quot;to progress&quot; is to move toward something and is thus also to move away from something else; therefore, &quot;progress&quot; is an inappropriate term to describe the structures of consciousness. Gebser wrote that the question as to the fate of humanity is still open, that for it to become closed would be the ultimate tragedy, but that such a closure remains a possibility. To Gebser, our fate is not assured by any notion of &quot;an evolution toward&quot;, or by any kind of ideal way of being.

===Space and time===
Gebser notes that the various structures of consciousness are revealed by their relationship to space and time. For example, the mythical structure embodies time as cyclical/rhythmic and space as enclosed. The mental structure lives time as linear, directed or &quot;progressive&quot; and space becomes the box-like, vacuum-like space of geometry.

==Influence==
Gebser&#x27;s work has formed the basis of a number of other studies and writers.

===Ken Wilber===
Ken Wilber referred to and quoted Gebser (along with many other theorists) in his 1981 &quot;Up from Eden&quot; and subsequent works. Wilber found Gebser&#x27;s &#x27;pioneering&#x27; work to align to his own model of consciousness, although Wilber finds evidence for additional later mystical stages beyond Gebser&#x27;s integral structure.

===William Irwin Thompson===
In his 1996 &quot;Coming into Being&quot;, cultural critic William Irwin Thompson compared Gebser&#x27;s structures of consciousness to Marshall McLuhan&#x27;s conception of the development of communication technology from oral culture to script culture, alphabetic culture, print culture, and then to the emerging electronic culture. Thompson applied these insights to education theory in his 2001 &quot;Transforming History: A Curriculum for Cultural Evolution&quot;. In his 2004 &quot;Self and Society: Studies in the Evolution of Consciousness&quot;, and in collaboration with the mathematician Ralph Abraham, Thompson further related Gebser&#x27;s structures to periods in the development of mathematics (arithmetic, geometric, algebraic, dynamical, chaotic) and in the history of music.

===New Age===
Gebser&#x27;s integral philosophy is evaluated and applied to New Age thinking about a nascent shift in consciousness in the 2006 book &quot;2012, The Return of Quetzalcoatl&quot; by Daniel Pinchbeck. In &quot;A Secret History of Consciousness&quot; (2003) cultural historian Gary Lachman links Gebser&#x27;s work to that of other alternative philosophers of consciousness, such as Owen Barfield, Rudolf Steiner, Colin Wilson, and Jurij Moskvitin.

<text>Dumitru Stăniloae (; – 4 October 1993), also Anglicized as Demetrius Staniloae, was a Romanian Orthodox Christian priest, theologian and professor. He worked for over 45 years on a comprehensive Romanian translation of the Greek Philokalia, a collection of writings on prayer by the Church Fathers, together with the hieromonk Arsenius Boca, who brought manuscripts from Mount Athos. His book, &quot;The Dogmatic Orthodox Theology&quot; (1978), made him one of the best-known Christian theologians of the second half of the 20th century. He also produced commentaries on earlier Christian thinkers, such as St Gregory of Nyssa, Saint Maximus the Confessor, and St Athanasius of Alexandria. 

He is a controversial figure outside the Orthodox Church view, in his early activity as a journalist he promoted antisemitism and praised totalitarian figures such as Ion Antonescu and Adolf Hitler, before and during World War II. He was recruited by the Securitate under the codename &quot;Văleanu Ion&quot; as an informant following his release from prison in 1963 but he did not cooperate. Accused of being a &quot;mystical element with hostile concepts&quot; he would be removed from the network of informants in 1973.

He is saint of the Romanian Orthodox Church and was officially canonized on the 4th of February, 2025.

==Biography==
Dumitru Stăniloae was born on 16 November 1903, in Vlădeni, in what is now Brașov County, Romania. He was the last of five children of Rebeca (mother) and Irimie (father). His mother was a priest&#x27;s niece. On 10 February 1917 he went to Brașov to study at the Andrew Șaguna High School. He received a fellowship from the Gojdu Foundation in 1918 and a fellowship from the University of Cernăuți in 1922. Disappointed by the quality of the manuals and the teaching methods, he left for the University of Bucharest after one year. He was offered a fellowship by metropolitan bishop Nicolae Bălan at the Metropolitan Center in Sibiu in 1924 during Lent. Stăniloae graduated from the University of Cernăuți in 1927, receiving a fellowship to study theology in Athens. In the fall of 1928 he earned his PhD degree at Cernăuți, with thesis &quot;Life and work of Dositheos II of Jerusalem (1641-1707) and his connections with Romanian Principalities&quot;. The Metropolitan Center in Sibiu offered him a fellowship in Byzantine studies and Dogmatics. He went to Munich to attend the courses of August Heisenberg (father of physicist Werner Heisenberg), and then went to Berlin, Paris, and Istanbul to study the work of Gregory Palamas.

He married on 4 October 1930, and his wife gave birth to twins in 1931, named Demetrius and Maria. He and his wife had another daughter, Lidia, on 8 October of the following year; and that year he met and befriended ultra-right ideologist Nichifor Crainic.

In January 1934, Stăniloae took over as editor in chief of the Transylvanian bi-weekly church newspaper &quot;Telegraful român&quot; &quot;(The Romanian Telegraph)&quot;. He would hold the position until May 1945. Under the previous editor in chief, George Proca, &quot;Telegraful român&quot; had published ambivalent articles about the Jewish minority. Under Stăniloae, the editorial line became aggressively antisemitic. It published eulogies of legionaries Ion Moța and Vasile Marin, far-right politician A. C. Cuza, Romanian dictator Ion Antonescu and even Adolf Hitler. As antisemitic legislation was adopted by the successive Romanian governments &quot;Telegraful&quot; supported the legislation. Deportations of Roma and Jews were also encouraged. Some editorials (including a 1942 article suggestively titled &quot;Au să dispară din Europa&quot;, i.e., &quot;They will disappear from Europe&quot;) go as far as advocating the Final Solution:

&quot;The newspaper Raza from Bessarabia prints the joyful news that the last Jewish convoy from Chişinău is heading towards the Russian steppe, and thus the city got rid of the Jewish cancer. According to the aforementioned newspaper, the departure of the Jews took place with the same swiftness in the other cities of Bessarabia. So it should be – in Bessarabia and all the other provinces of the country.&quot;

As a result of his political writing and his notability, a generation of theologians, associated with him or sharing his political views - in particular antisemitism, is known as &quot;Stăniloae Generation&quot;.

Stăniloae was ordained a deacon on 8 October 1931 and was ordained priest on 25 September 1932. In June 1936 he became rector of the Theological Academy in Sibiu. In 1940, at the initiative of poet Sandu Tudor, the &quot;Rugul aprins&quot; (&quot;Burning Bush&quot;) group was founded. It was composed of priest-monk Ivan Kulighin (confessor of Russian Metropolitan bishop of Rostov, refugee at Cernica Monastery), priest-monk Benedict Ghius, priest-monk Sofian Boghiu, Prof. Alex. Mironescu, poet Vasile Voiculescu, architect Constantin Joja, Father Andrew Scrima and John Marin Sadoveanu. The group gathered regularly at the Cernica and Antim monasteries, maintaining Christian life in Bucharest.

In 1946 he was asked by metropolitan bishop Nicholas Bălan, under pressure from Petru Groza, first Communist Prime Minister of Romania, to resign as rector of the Theological Academy in Sibiu. He remained a professor until 1947, when he was transferred to the University of Bucharest&#x27;s Faculty of Theology, as the Ascetics and Mystics chair.

Because of political unrest in Romania in 1958, following a split in the Romanian Communist Party, Father Demetrius was arrested by the Securitate on 5 September. While he was in Aiud Prison as a political prisoner, his only surviving child, Lidia, gave birth to his grandchild, Demetrius Horia. Lidia was asked to leave the University of Bucharest&#x27;s Faculty of Physics because of the arrest of her father.

He was freed from prison in January 1963, and then began work as a clerk at the Holy Synod of the Romanian Orthodox Church, and began teaching again in October. He attended conferences in Freiburg and Heidelberg at the invitation of Prof. Paul Miron, with the permission of the State Department of Cults, who wanted to change the image of Romania. While lecturing at Oxford University, he became friends with the theologian Donald Allchin. He retired in 1973.
He received honorary doctorates from the University of Thessaloniki in 1976, the Saint-Sergius Orthodox Institute in Paris in 1981, the Faculty of Orthodox Theology in Belgrade in 1982, and the University of Bucharest in 1992. He was awarded the &quot;Dr. Leopold Lucas&quot; prize of the Faculty of Theology in Tübingen in 1980 and the Cross of St Augustine in Canterbury&quot; in 1982.

He died in Bucharest on 5 October 1993, at the age of 90.
===Canonization===
Father Dumitru Stăniloae was canonised in 2025 as the Romanian Orthodox Church celebrates 140 years of autocephaly and 100 years since obtaining the status of a patriarchate. On July 11th and 12th, 2024, the Romanian Orthodox Church officially approved the canonization of Stăniloae along with 15 other Romanian Orthodox saints. His feast day is on October 4th.

His canonization, along with Ilarion Felea&#x27;s and Ilie Lăcătuşu&#x27;s, was criticised by Elie Wiesel National Institute for Studying the Holocaust in Romania:

“We question whether elevating to sainthood individuals who, during their lives, shared the values of fascism through words or deeds is consonant with Christian ethics”

The Romanian Orthodox Church promptly replied to criticism, supporting the decision:

&quot;Some saints venerated in the Orthodox Church have had, at certain times in their lives, attitudes, and gestures that are hard to understand or even contrary to Christian teachings. However, the Church considers the sinner&#x27;s change of life and, especially, how they ended their lives, without encouraging (sanctifying) certain deviations that these persons may have had during their lives.&quot;

<text>Pärk or Paerk is a game somewhat similar to a game of baseball but where the aim is to gain ground like in American football, that has been played for centuries on the island of Gotland in Baltic Sea. The game is played with two teams of 7 people on a field that is wide and that can vary in length. The players hit the ball with their hands or feet. The paerk, or serve area, is marked off with wooden laths and measures .

The ball is made of a tight ball of yarn that has been dressed in sheepskin.

Pärk is one of the disciplines at the annual Stånga Games (&quot;Stångaspelen&quot;).

<text>Carrefour Laval (corporately styled as &quot;CF Carrefour Laval&quot;) is a superregional shopping mall in Laval, Quebec, Canada. It is located in the Chomedey neighbourhood of the city at the intersection of Laurentian Autoroute (A-15) and Autoroute Jean-Noël-Lavoie (A-440). 

At , it is both the largest enclosed shopping centre in the Greater Montreal area and the largest mall operating on a single floor in all of Quebec. Virtually untouched by the ongoing decline of indoor malls, it typically ranks among the top shopping centres in Quebec for its number of visitors as well as sales per square foot and has been home to many retail firsts in the province.

==Stores==
The mall has three anchor stores: Hudson&#x27;s Bay, Simons and Rona L&#x27;Entrepôt. Various other stores, boutiques and restaurants are represented in the mall. 

==History==

===Planning for a new mall (1969-1973)===
Construction of the mall was announced on February 27, 1969, by Steinberg&#x27;s and Eaton&#x27;s. The consortium announced that a 150-store mall would be built on a property next to the Laurentian Autoroute, subject to the construction of the necessary infrastructure by the newly formed city of Laval.

Construction was intended to start in 1971 but the project had been delayed after a zoning bylaw proposed by mayor Jacques Tétreault, that would effectively have given the Carrefour Laval consortium a monopoly over the development of the proposed downtown core of Laval, was challenged by the opposition and by members of his own party who founded his idea to be discriminatory and too restrictive towards other businesses. Carrefour Laval finally broke ground the following year and undertaken by Fairview Corporation which had previously developed the shopping malls Fairview Pointe-Claire and Galeries d&#x27;Anjou.

===Timeline===
*1974: Carrefour Laval opens with major tenants Simpsons, Eaton&#x27;s, Dupuis Frères, Pascal&#x27;s and Beaucoup. The L-shaped Carrefour Laval has 125 stores. Eaton&#x27;s and Beaucoup anchor the ends of the mall and Simpsons is at the junction. Carrefour Laval has three owners: Fairview Corporation, Ivanhoe Corporation and Eaton&#x27;s. It has a size of 850,000 square feet and occupies a land of 29.6 hectares. Almost 200,000 square feet of it goes to the Eaton&#x27;s store.
*1978: Dupuis Frères closes.
*1983: The mall increases to 1.15 million square feet by expanding to the west with 90 new stores and a Sears department store of 158,000 square feet.
*1984: The Beaucoup concept is abandoned. Steinberg&#x27;s and Miracle Mart now have their separate anchor spaces, although they remain side by side.
*1985: Miracle Mart is converted to M.
*1989: Simpsons is converted to The Bay.
*1991: Pascal&#x27;s closes.
*1992: Steinberg&#x27;s and M close.
*1993: Staples also becomes a tenant of Carrefour Laval. It is located in a portion of the former Pascal&#x27;s hardware store&#x27;s. Moreover, work begins to convert the space that had been occupied by M to accommodate what would have been the first Costco store in Quebec, but this is halted when Costco and Price Club merge the same year, since there was already a Price Club store right across the expressway. 
*1994: Rona L&#x27;Entrepôt opens on what used to be the anchor spaces of Steinberg&#x27;s and M.
* 1995: Wise closes.
*1996: Les Ailes de la Mode opens. Like Staples, it opens in the former Pascal outlet. 
*1999: Eaton&#x27;s closes.
*2000: Cadillac Fairview acquires full ownership of the mall. Until now it had been co-owned by Ivanhoe.
*2002: Carrefour Laval expands with 80 new stores and anchor Simons. This expansion took place on the former spot of the Eaton&#x27;s store which has been demolished. The new section is characterized on a map as the southern eastern portion of the mall with the shape of an arc.
*2008: A newer, expanded food court and redesign of the flooring and ceilings is underway and scheduled to be completed in two phases by 2009. The food court offers now 1,200 seats.
*2009: The new food court opens with 22 fast food restaurants, 1,200 seats and an upscale restaurant, &quot;Table 51&quot;. This results in a small increase of the total size of Carrefour Laval (attributed to the northern part of the new food court) although insignificant in comparison to the mall&#x27;s expansions in 1983 and 2002. Conversion of the old 1983 food court into retail space begins.
*2010: End of the work for the conversion of the old food court
*2011: Les Ailes de la Mode closes.
*2012: Crate &amp; Barrel opens, in part of Les Ailes de la Mode&#x27;s past location. The rest is split between The Keg and P.F. Chang&#x27;s. 
*2014: Staples closes.
*2018: Sears closes.
*2019: TD Asset Management becomes owner of the mall at 50%.
*2022: Sears&#x27; former building is demolished. Sporting Life opens in its former location at 26,827 square feet. 

==Transit accessibility==
Non-local car traffic to the mall is mainly accessible via the two major highways that border it: Highway 15 and Highway 440. Additionally, it is served by public transit via the STL, which has its EXO bus terminal located across from the mall, with bus service that connects to the Montreal Metro (via the terminus of the orange line in Laval).

<doc id="1341918" wikidata="Q7302184" url="?curid=1341918" title="Reborn in the USA">
<text>Reborn in the USA is a British reality television show broadcast on ITV, in which ten British pop acts were transported to the US, where they were supposedly not known in the hope of revitalising their music career.

Each week, the American audience voted for their favourite act. The two acts with the fewest votes would then face the vote from the British public, where the following week the act with the fewest votes was eliminated from the contest and sent back to Britain. The series was presented by Davina McCall and the eventual winner was ex Spandau Ballet lead singer Tony Hadley, who was awarded with the prize of a recording contract.

== Overview ==
The competitors were: Tony Hadley, Michelle Gayle, Gina G, Elkie Brooks, Dollar, Leee John (of Imagination), Haydon Eshun (of Ultimate Kaos), Sonia and Mark Shaw of Then Jerico. Shaw quit the show in the first week after being criticised by other participants for his drunken behaviour prior to the recording of the first concert. Peter Cox (of Go West) was flown in as a replacement.

Further controversy arose in the second week when acts Dollar and Sonia had received the fewest votes and were both up for the public vote. Sonia elected to leave the tour due to stress, but then decided to return to face the vote. Dollar (David Van Day and Thereza Bazar) accused her of pulling a publicity stunt to gain votes, resulting in a heated argument between the two acts, where Sonia ultimately told Van Day he was &quot;a nasty piece of work&quot;. In the end, Dollar were voted off and Sonia continued in the show for a few more weeks.

The format for the show had the artists travelling on a tour bus to a new venue each week. Each would perform one song which would relate to the city they were performing in (e.g. the concert in New Orleans would have each perform a well-known song about New Orleans). All songs performed were cover versions, until the final show where the final two (Hadley and Gayle) each sang one of their own hits. Despite his late entry to the show, Peter Cox was the favourite to win, but he finished in third place after forgetting the words to the song he was performing.

The show&#x27;s theme music was composed and produced by Stuart Hancock for London-based music production company Mcasso Music, and variations of this theme music were used to accompany the on-screen action between song performances.

Following the show&#x27;s transmission, a book and an album was released. The album contained studio recordings of various cover versions by the acts, comprising 17 songs.

Blyden was born to Adolph and Marian (née Davidson) Blieden in Houston, Texas, and raised in the Jewish faith. As a child, he attended Wharton Elementary School and Sidney Lanier Junior High School. 

His neighbor Elmore Torn also became an actor, Rip Torn. The Blieden and Torn families were friends; the Blieden family name was pronounced &quot;bleedin&#x27;&quot;, giving rise to a family joke. As Blyden recalled, when Rip and Larry&#x27;s fathers introduced themselves, Torn would announce, &quot;I&#x27;m Torn and he&#x27;s Blieden.&quot; 

Blyden became interested in acting at a young age and made his stage debut in a production headed by Margo Jones when he was 14 years old. 
After graduating from Lamar High School, Blyden attended Southwestern Louisiana Institute for a year before enlisting in the U.S. Marine Corps during World War II, rising to the rank of second lieutenant. After leaving the service in 1946, he enrolled at the University of Houston. While in college, Blyden worked as an announcer for KPRC radio and performed at the Alley Theatre and Houston Little Theater. After graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1948, Blyden moved to New York City to pursue an acting career.

==Career==

===Stage and films===
While in New York, Blyden again worked in radio and studied acting at the Stella Adler Studio of Acting for eighteen months. While starring in a showcase of &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;, he was spotted by director Joshua Logan who cast him in a small role in the Broadway production of &quot;Mister Roberts&quot;. He was then cast in the larger role of &quot;Ensign Pulver&quot;, and remained with the production until 1951. His second Broadway role was that of &quot;Schmutz&quot; in the original production of &quot;Wish You Wish Here&quot;. In 1958, Blyden replaced Larry Storch as &quot;Sammy Fong&quot; in the out-of-town tryouts for the musical &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot;. He remained in the role during the show&#x27;s original Broadway run for which he was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical. The show was choreographed by his then-wife, Carol Haney. That same year, he appeared in &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It with You&quot;, at Expo 58 (also known as Brussels World&#x27;s Fair).

In November 1962, Blyden tried his hand at stage directing in the Broadway production of &quot;Harold&quot;, starring Anthony Perkins and Don Adams. The production closed after twenty performances. In February 1967, Blyden replaced Martin Balsam in the Broadway production of &quot;You Know I Can&#x27;t Hear You When the Water&#x27;s Running&quot;. Blyden&#x27;s second stage directing effort was the play &quot;The Mother Lover&quot;, in which he also starred. The production also featured Eileen Heckart and Valerie French and premiered at the Booth Theatre on February 1, 1969. In March 1972, he portrayed the role of &quot;Hysterium&quot; in the revival of &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot;, starring Phil Silvers, which Blyden also produced. He won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical for his work in the play.

In 1974, Blyden appeared as &quot;Dionysos&quot; with the Yale Repertory Theatre in the musical comedy &quot;The Frogs&quot;, in New Haven, Connecticut. The play was written by Burt Shevelove, and based on a play written by Aristophanes in 405 B.C. The play&#x27;s music and lyrics were composed by Stephen Sondheim. Blyden&#x27;s final stage role was that of &quot;Sidney&quot; in Alan Ayckbourn&#x27;s comedy &quot;Absurd Person Singular&quot;, for which he was nominated for a Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actor in a Play and a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play. He remained with the production for 250 performances.

Over the course of his career, Blyden appeared in three feature films. He made his film debut in a supporting role in the 1957 drama &quot;The Bachelor Party&quot;, starring Don Murray. He also had supporting roles in &quot;Kiss Them for Me&quot; (1957) and &quot;On a Clear Day You Can See Forever&quot; (1970).

===Television===

In addition to stage and occasional film work, Blyden also appeared in guest spots for television shows. In the 1950s, he made guest performances on several dramatic anthology shows including &quot;Playhouse 90,&quot; &quot;Omnibus,&quot; &quot;The Loretta Young Show&quot; and &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;. In May 1955, CBS announced that Blyden was set to star opposite Nita Talbot in the sitcom &quot;Joe and Mabel&quot;. The series, which was based on the radio series of the same name that had aired on the NBC Red Network from February 1941 to September 1942, was scheduled to premiere on September 20, 1955. Production began that summer but was hampered by the Screen Actors Guild strike that began on August 5, 1955. Although the strike lasted just ten days, production on the series ceased. Production eventually resumed but the series was plagued with various issues and, upon being previewed for critics, was poorly received. CBS eventually decided to burn off the series&#x27; thirteen completed episodes during the summer of 1956 after which it was canceled. 

After the cancellation of &quot;Joe and Mabel&quot;, Blyden returned to stage work (replacing Ray Walston in the Philadelphia and Broadway runs of &quot;Who Was That Lady I Saw You With?&quot; and &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot;). He returned to television in 1959 as &quot;Sammy Glick&quot; in the television adaptation of Budd Schulberg&#x27;s 1941 novel &quot;What Makes Sammy Run?&quot; The two-part special aired on the &quot;NBC Sunday Showcase&quot; on September 27 and October 4, 1959, and also starred John Forsythe, Dina Merrill and Barbara Rush.

In the early 1960s, Blyden returned to television with guest starring roles in two episodes of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;: &quot;A Nice Place to Visit&quot; in April 1960 and &quot;Showdown with Rance McGrew&quot; in February 1962 in which he starred as the title character. In 1963, Blyden was cast to star in a second sitcom, NBC&#x27;s &quot;Harry&#x27;s Girls&quot;. Produced by MGM Television, the series was an adaptation of the Robert E. Sherwood play &quot;Idiot&#x27;s Delight&quot;, with Blyden starring as Harry, a vaudeville style performer constantly getting into trouble and falling in love. The series received a great deal of publicity before it aired because it was being filmed on location in Europe (interiors were filmed at the Victorine Studios in France while exteriors were shot on location in Rome, Paris and other European locations). Upon its debut, &quot;Harry&#x27;s Girls&quot; was also not well received and was canceled after one season. For the remainder of the decade, Blyden continued with guest roles on television including spots on &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;The Defenders&quot;, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, and &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;

In the late 1960s, Blyden began working as a game show host and master of ceremonies starting with &quot;Personality&quot; in June 1967. In 1969, he hosted &quot;You&#x27;re Putting Me On&quot; and &quot;The Movie Game&quot;. He also appeared as a guest panelist on the Goodson-Todman daytime CBS game show &quot;Match Game &#x27;74&quot;. 

In 1972, Blyden took over hosting duties for the syndicated revival of the game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; Blyden remained the show&#x27;s host until Goodson-Todman discontinued production on December 12, 1974.

In the weeks before his death, Blyden was involved in several major projects. He co-hosted the 29th Tony Awards telecast that aired on ABC on April 20, 1975. On May 2, Blyden reprised his role as Ensign Pulver opposite Henry Fonda at a gala tribute to director Joshua Logan at Broadway&#x27;s Imperial Theatre (which was recorded and eventually released on a privately distributed LP album). He also narrated a segment of CBS&#x27;s &quot;Bicentennial Minute&quot; which aired during primetime the evening of May 30.

==Personal life==
Blyden married actress and dancer Carol Haney on April 17, 1955, in Las Vegas. The couple had two children: Joshua and Ellen Rachel. Blyden and Haney were divorced in 1962.

During their marriage, Blyden and Haney purchased the historic Achenbach House in Saddle River, New Jersey, which they believed to be haunted by the spirit of its builder. After Haney&#x27;s death in 1964, Blyden inherited the home and became convinced that her own spirit was haunting the house. Blyden later told a friend that in the months after Haney&#x27;s death, the house was filled with the smell of brownies baking which had been Haney&#x27;s favorite. Blyden told his friend that after he yelled at Haney to leave him alone, the smell instantly vanished. 
The house was later sold to tour operator Mario Perillo and was destroyed by fire in 2004.

==In later life==
Blyden&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; producer offered an insight on Blyden&#x27;s later life: &quot;Like most performers, the only thing that Larry said he really wanted in his career he never seemed able to get. He was not particularly happy hosting game shows. He was good at it. I think he enjoyed it, but it was not the challenge he wanted. And he was bored with the repetition of eight performances a week on the stage. Although he was brilliantly funny in the murderously demanding part of Sidney in &quot;Absurd Person Singular&quot;, he really hated the cliquey bickering of the all-star cast. Larry wanted to do films, but nobody asked him... The trouble was that there were very few great parts for medium-tall, medium good-looking, 50-year-old Larry Blyden. He had lots more to give.&quot;

On May 6, 1975, Blyden left the production of &quot;Absurd Person Singular&quot; after he was hired to host a new game show entitled &quot;Showoffs&quot;, a video version of the parlor-game charades. The project began unhappily, owing to &quot;Larry&#x27;s phobia about not wasting time and Mark Goodson&#x27;s total disregard of time when he is in the throes of the creative process.&quot; On May 24, 1975, the day the pilot episode was taped, Blyden was furious that studio delays forced him to miss his daughter&#x27;s graduation play, but he remained professional and hosted the pilot.

==Death==
Before production was set to begin on &quot;Showoffs&quot;, Blyden was granted a two-week vacation and decided to fly to Marrakesh, Morocco. While he was driving near Agadir on May 31, Blyden&#x27;s rental car reportedly went off the road and overturned. According to Blyden&#x27;s manager, Blyden suffered injuries to the chest, head and abdomen. He underwent surgery, but died of his injuries on June 6, 1975 at the age of 49, just 17 days before his 50th birthday. Blyden&#x27;s body was flown back to the United States on June 13. A memorial was held on June 20, after which he was buried at Forest Park Lawndale Cemetery in Houston.

<text>The 1958 United States House of Representatives elections was an election for the United States House of Representatives to elect members to serve in the 86th United States Congress. They were held for the most part on November 4, 1958, in the middle of Dwight Eisenhower&#x27;s second presidential term, while Maine held theirs on September 8. There were 436 seats during these elections: 435 from the reapportionment in accordance with the 1950 census, and one seat for Alaska, the new state that would officially join the union on January 3, 1959.

The economy was suffering the Recession of 1958, which Democrats blamed on Eisenhower. The President&#x27;s Republican Party lost 48 seats in this midterm election, increasing the Democratic Party&#x27;s majority to a commanding level that Republicans would not be able to overcome for another 36 years. Another factor which may have contributed to the Democratic gains include public consternation over the launch of Sputnik and Cold War politics.

Disappointment with the results led House Republicans to replace Minority Leader Joseph W. Martin Jr. with his deputy, Charles Halleck.

==Overall results==
394 incumbent members sought reelection, but 3 were defeated in primaries and 37 defeated in the general election for a total of 354 incumbents winning.

<text>An inland port is a port on an inland waterway, such as a river, lake, or canal, which may or may not be connected to the sea. The term &quot;inland port&quot; is also used to refer to a dry port.

==Examples==
The United States Army Corps of Engineers publishes biannually a list of such locations and for this purpose states that &quot;inland ports&quot; are ports that are located on rivers and do not handle deep draft ship traffic. The list includes ports such as St. Louis, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Kansas City, and Memphis.
A dense network of inland waterways including ports exists also in Europe (France, Germany, Poland, Russia, the United Kingdom and the Benelux countries), as well as in China and Brazil.

<text>The Turkish Grand Prix () is a Formula One motor race held at Istanbul Park, designed by Hermann Tilke. The race was part of the Formula One World Championship between and , and to , the latter two being due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Felipe Massa and Ferrari are the most successful driver and constructor respectively, having won the race three times each.

==History==
Despite the major challenges involved including completing part of the journey by boat, teams drove their equipment from their European factories to the track for each meeting except the 2020 race.

The nature of the circuit resulted in the inaugural 2005 Turkish Grand Prix weekend seeing exciting on-track action, with many drivers spinning off throughout the weekend due to pushing too hard, particularly at Turn 8 where Juan Pablo Montoya ran wide with two laps to go following a tangle with the Jordan of Tiago Monteiro. This allowed Fernando Alonso to take second place behind Kimi Räikkönen, an event which had a significant bearing on their battle for the World Championship headed towards its culmination.

A year later, Felipe Massa took his first pole position and victory at Tuzla. The Ferraris were 1–2 in early stages of the race, with Massa ahead of Michael Schumacher. Vitantonio Liuzzi&#x27;s spin brought out the safety car and the Ferraris had to pit on the same lap. Alonso was able to get past Schumacher and the order stayed until the end of the race. Massa repeated in 2007 ahead of his new teammate Räikkönen.

In 2008, the race was held in May. Two-stopping Massa won the race ahead of three-stopping Lewis Hamilton, although Hamilton had passed him during the race.

For 2011, the race was put in doubt because Bernie Ecclestone wanted to double the fees for hosting the race. Ecclestone later confirmed, however, that it would feature on the 2011 calendar, which would expand to twenty races with the addition of the Indian Grand Prix (although the cancellation of the Bahrain Grand Prix meant only nineteen Grands Prix were held).

On 30 July 2011 it was announced that the Turkish Grand Prix would not be on the calendar from 2012 due to a lack of agreement on the annual cost. The race organisers claimed that the hosting fee was too high, while Ecclestone blamed poor promotion for the race&#x27;s lack of profitability. On 9 January 2013 the government chose not to approve the Formula 1 deal that would have held the race in Tuzla in 2013.

The project, set to cost Turkey around 20 million dollars in total, needed to receive 13 million dollars of state funding.
The government, however, did not give its approval, and the project fell through.

=== 2005 ===

The winner of the inaugural Turkish Grand Prix was Kimi Räikkönen (McLaren-Mercedes), Fernando Alonso (Renault F1) came in second, followed by Juan Pablo Montoya (McLaren-Mercedes).

The fastest race lap was achieved by Juan Pablo Montoya in 1&#x27;24.770, a time which is yet to be surpassed.

=== 2006 ===

The 2006 Turkish Grand Prix was won by Felipe Massa (Ferrari), who led from start to finish, Fernando Alonso (Renault F1) came in second and seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher in third.

The fastest race lap was achieved by Michael Schumacher in 1&#x27;28.005.

As part of the podium ceremony after the 2006 race, the winner&#x27;s trophy was presented by Mehmet Ali Talat, who was introduced to television viewers via the captions as the president of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, a state which is recognised only by Turkey. The FIA announced they would be investigating this incident, as a possible breach of the organisation&#x27;s political neutrality. The identity of the person who would present the winner&#x27;s trophy was left to the last minute, leaving the FIA no time to veto the choice. Some commentators feared this incident could jeopardise the future of the Turkish Grand Prix, and possibly also Turkey&#x27;s round of the World Rally Championship, another FIA-sanctioned series. It was concluded with a 5 million dollar fine, which was later reduced by half.

=== 2007 ===

The winner of the 2007 Turkish Grand Prix was the Brazilian Felipe Massa (Ferrari), who won the race for the second year in a row having qualified in pole position. During the press conference following the race, he commented that &quot;the Istanbul Park was the track where he made his career turn-around, and finally began winning races.&quot; He also praised the track as well as the city.

The fastest race lap was achieved by Kimi Räikkönen in 1&#x27;27.295.

=== 2008 ===

The winner of the 2008 Turkish Grand Prix was the Brazilian Felipe Massa (Ferrari), who won the race for the third year in a row, also starting in pole position.

The fastest race lap was achieved by Kimi Räikkönen in 1&#x27;26.506.

=== 2009 ===

The winner was the British Jenson Button of Brawn GP, with Australian Mark Webber and Germany&#x27;s Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull Racing completing the podium.

The fastest race lap was achieved by eventual winner, Jenson Button with a 1&#x27;27.579.

=== 2010 ===

The winner was Britain&#x27;s Lewis Hamilton of McLaren, with teammate and countryman Jenson Button in second and Australian Mark Webber of Red Bull Racing in third. Webber had started in pole position and had been leading the race until he collided with teammate Sebastian Vettel.

=== 2011 ===

Sebastian Vettel won the 2011 event for Red Bull Racing, ahead of team-mate Mark Webber and Ferrari&#x27;s Fernando Alonso. The race featured the greatest recorded number of pit stops and overtaking manoeuvres in a dry race in F1 history.

=== 2020 ===

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 several originally scheduled races were cancelled. The Turkish Grand Prix was added to the revised calendar in August 2020 and the race weekend was held between 13 and 15 November 2020. The race weekend was marred by a newly resurfaced track, which Pirelli was not aware of and could not test or bring appropriate tyres for, and heavy rainfall exacerbating the already slippery conditions. Lance Stroll of Racing Point took pole position in wet conditions. It was Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes, starting from sixth, who took the lead in the middle stages of the race and led to win the race and claim his seventh world title, equaling Michael Schumacher&#x27;s record.

=== 2021 ===

The Turkish Grand Prix was initially brought in as a replacement for the Canadian Grand Prix for the 2021 Formula One World Championship due to the entry restrictions of Canada. The event was postponed due to travel restrictions from Turkey imposed by the British government, with the Styrian Grand Prix taking its place. The race was later re-added to the calendar to take the place of the cancelled Singapore Grand Prix. The race was won by Valtteri Bottas for Mercedes, who started from pole position and led most of the race.

<text>The Automotive Hall of Fame is a hall of fame and museum honoring influential figures in the history of the automotive industry. Located in Dearborn, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit, US. The Hall of Fame is part of the MotorCities National Heritage Area.

==History==
The Automotive Hall of Fame was founded on October 18, 1939, in New York City by a group called the &quot;Automobile Old Timers.&quot; Its original mission was to perpetuate the memories of early automotive pioneers and to honor people from all parts of the auto industry worldwide. For its first three decades, The Automotive Hall of Fame had four name changes. Its second iteration was &quot;Automotive Old Timers&quot; adopted in 1957 and intended to recognize its broader base, including automotive-related industries. In 1971 it became &quot;The Automotive Organization Team.&quot; Finally, it became known as &quot;The Automotive Hall of Fame&quot; and that resulted in greater growth.

In 1946 the hall worked with the &quot;National Golden Jubilee&quot; (50th anniversary of the creation of the automobile). As General William S. Knudsen stated, the selection to the Hall of Fame included &quot;Ten pioneers whose engineering and administrative genius made possible the present day.&quot; The selection was done in cooperation with the Automobile Manufacturers Association, the &quot;National Automotive Golden Jubilee committee of which Knudsen was president. Edgar Apperson, William Crapo Durant, J. Frank Duryea, Henry Ford, George M. Holley, Charles B. King, Charles W. Nash, Barney Oldfield, Ransom E. Olds, and Alfred P. Sloan Jr. were selected.

The organization moved to Washington, D.C. in 1960, sharing space in the National Automobile Dealers Association building. In 1971, it moved to Midland, Michigan, where it got its first home at Northwood University. In 1997, it moved to its present home, a 25,000-square-foot building in Dearborn, Michigan, adjacent to The Henry Ford; in addition to automobile history artifacts, it contains a small theater and a central enclosed building area for public events, meetings and other exhibits.

The Hall celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2014.

During the 2016 induction ceremony, the Hall of Fame&#x27;s president announced that the museum was exploring a possible move to downtown Detroit. These plans never materialized.

==Awards==
The Hall honors members of the automotive industry each year. There were 271 people inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame through 2016. These inductees include the founders of Benz, Bosch, Bugatti, Buick, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Citroen, Cord, Daimler, Dodge, Duesenberg, Durant, Duryea, Ferrari, Ford, Honda, Maybach, Olds, Peugeot, Porsche, Renault and Toyota among others.

Along with the Hall of Fame induction awards, the Hall also honors individuals with three other significant awards each year:
*Distinguished Service Citation
*Industry Leader of the Year Award
*Young Leader and Excellence Award
For Hall induction, the Distinguished Service Citation, and Young Leader and Excellence Award, anyone can submit a nomination by filling out the form or sending a letter, along with reference materials that may assist the Awards Committee. The Industry Leader of the Year Award is nominated and awarded solely by the Awards Committee, so no external nominations are accepted.

<text>Bevis of Hampton ( or or ; Anglo-Norman: ; ) or Sir Bevois was a legendary English hero and the subject of Anglo-Norman, Dutch, French, English, Venetian, and other medieval metrical chivalric romances that bear his name. The tale also exists in medieval prose, with translations to Romanian, Russian, Dutch, Irish, Welsh, Old Norse and Yiddish.

==Legend==

&quot;Sir Bevis of Hampton&quot; (c. 1324) is a Middle English romance. It contains many themes common to that genre: a hero whose exploits take him from callow youth to hard-won maturity, ending with a serene and almost sanctified death. Supporting him are a resourceful, appealing heroine and faithful servants set against dynastic intrigue, and a parade of interesting villains, both foreign and domestic. The plot has a geographical sweep that moves back and forth from England to the Near East and through most of western Europe, replete with battles against dragons, giants and other mythical creatures. Forced marriages, episodes of domestic violence, a myriad of disguises and mistaken identities, harsh imprisonments with dramatic escapes, harrowing rescues, and violent urban warfare fill out the protagonist&#x27;s experiences. Last but not least, he has a horse of such valor that the horse&#x27;s death at the end of the poem is at least as tragic as that of the heroine, and almost as tragic as that of Bevis himself. Not surprisingly though, this much variety makes the poem a difficult one to characterize with any degree of certainty, and several other factors make it a poem that is perhaps easier to enjoy than to evaluate accurately.

Bevis is the son of Guy, the count of Hampton (Southampton), and Guy&#x27;s young wife, who is a daughter of the King of Scotland. Discontented with her marriage, Bevis&#x27;s mother asks a former suitor, Doon or Devoun, emperor of Almaine (Germany), to send an army to murder Guy in a forest. The plot succeeds and the countess marries Doon. Threatened with future vengeance by her ten-year-old son, she determines to do away with him also, but Bevis is saved from death by a faithful tutor.

Bevis is subsequently sold to pirates and ends up at the court of King Hermin, whose realm is variously placed in Egypt and Armenia. The legend continues to relate the exploits of Bevis, his defeat of Ascapart, his love for the king&#x27;s daughter Josiane, his mission to King Bradmond of Damascus with a sealed letter demanding his own death, his eventual imprisonment, and his final vengeance on his stepfather. After succeeding in claiming his inheritance, however, Bevis is driven into exile and separated from Josiane, with whom he is reunited only after each of them has contracted, in form only, a second union. The story also relates the hero&#x27;s eventual death and the later fortunes of his two sons.

==Texts==

The oldest version known, , is an Anglo-Norman text that dates back to the first half of the 13th century. It consists of 3,850 verses written in s.

Three continental French chansons de geste of , all in decasyllables, were written in the 13th century. One is preserved in BnF Français 25516. They consist of between 10,000 and 20,000 verses. A French prose version was made before 1469. is an Old Norse translation of a lost version of the Anglo-Norman poem. The earliest manuscript of the saga dates to c. 1400.

The English metrical romance, (see Matter of England), is founded based on some French origins, varying slightly from those that have been preserved. The oldest manuscript dates from the beginning of the 14th century. A translation into Irish survives in a 15th-century manuscript.

The printed editions of the story were most numerous in Italy, where or was the subject of more than one poem, and the tale was interpolated in the , the Italian compilation of Carolingian legend. An anonymous was printed in 1480, and a &quot;Tuscan&quot;, in fact Padan of the Po Valley, version in 1497.

From Italian, it passed into Yiddish, where the became the first non-religious book to be printed in Yiddish. It is considered the most popular and critically honored Yiddish-language chivalry romance.

In Russia, the romance attained an unparalleled popularity and became a part of Russian folklore. The Russian rendition of the romance appeared in mid-16th century, translated from a Polish or Old Belarusian version, which were in turn, translated from a Croatian rendition of the Italian romance, made in Ragusa. The resulting narrative, called (, lit. The Story of ), gradually merged with Russian folktales, and the principal character attained many features of a Russian folk hero (bogatyr). Since the 18th century until 1918, various versions of the had been widely circulated (particularly among the lower classes) as a . Such writers as Derzhavin and Pushkin praised &#x27;s literary value. The latter praised a version of by Alexander Radishchev, written in 1799 and used some elements of the in his fairy tales (principally The Tale of Tsar Saltan).

==Sources==
R. Zenker (&quot;Boeve-Amlethus&quot;, Berlin and Leipzig, 1904) established a close parallel between Bevis and the Hamlet legend as related by Saxo Grammaticus in the &quot;Historia Danica&quot;. Some of the details that point to a common source are the vengeance of a stepfather for a father&#x27;s death, the letter bearing his own death-warrant entrusted to the hero, and his double marriage. However, the motive of feigned madness is lacking in Bevis. The princess who is Josiane&#x27;s rival is less ferocious than the Hermuthruda of the Hamlet legend, but she does threaten Bevis with death should he refuse her. Both seem modeled on the type of *Modthryth or Thryðo of the Beowulf legend. The 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; characterizes the mooted etymology connecting Bevis (Boeve) with Béowa (Beowulf), as &quot;fanciful&quot; and &quot;inadmissible&quot; on the ground that they were both dragon slayers. One alternative theory is that Doon may be identified with the emperor Otto the Great, who was the contemporary of Edgar the Peaceful, the English king Edgar of the story.

<doc id="1341952" wikidata="Q2442343" url="?curid=1341952" title="Fort McHenry Tunnel">
<text>The Fort McHenry Tunnel is a four-tube, bi-directional tunnel that carries traffic on Interstate 95 (I-95) underneath the Baltimore Harbor. Named for nearby Fort McHenry, the tunnel is the lowest point in the Interstate Highway System under water.

Construction began in May 1980; the tunnel opened on November 23, 1985. Having consumed some $750 million (equivalent to $ billion in ), it was the most expensive Interstate project until surpassed by the Big Dig in Boston. , it was used by 43.4 million vehicles annually.

Tolls are collected in both directions. The toll for cars is $3 with a Maryland E-ZPass and $4 with another state&#x27;s E-ZPass. Vehicles without an E-ZPass pay more, as do those with more than two axles—up to $45 for a 6+ axle vehicle without an E-ZPass. All-electronic tolling using E-ZPass or toll-by-plate started in March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and was made permanent in August 2020. A project to demolish the toll plaza and replace it with overhead gantries for open road tolling started in 2022.

==Location==

The tunnel crosses the Patapsco River, just south of Fort McHenry; it connects the Locust Point and Canton areas of Baltimore City.

==Design and construction==
Plans for a second crossing of the Baltimore Harbor that would become the Fort McHenry Tunnel began in the late 1960s. Early plans called for an 8-lane double-deck bridge to carry I-95 over the harbor just south of Fort McHenry. In 1975, plans were changed to a tunnel after it was determined that a bridge would hurt Fort McHenry&#x27;s status as a national monument.

The state of Maryland originally intended to build the tunnel with a reinforced concrete box design, but plans were changed in February 1976 to use a steel tubular design after a dispute with the Federal Highway Administration. The tunnel was to be constructed using the immersed tube method, with prefabricated tubes sunken into the harbor.

Construction began in May 1980 by K-R-T (a joint venture between Peter Kiewit Sons Company, Raymond International Builders, and Tidewater Construction Corporation), and was completed in November 1985. Ninety percent of construction costs were covered by federal funding, while 10 percent came from state funding. The tunnel consists of 32 tube sections, each wide and tall. The east and west approaches are and long, respectively.

Opened on time and under budget, the tunnel closed a gap in I-95 through Maryland. Soon after the Fort McHenry Tunnel opened, the nearby Baltimore Harbor Tunnel, which had opened to traffic in 1957, was extensively rehabilitated.

The Fort McHenry Tunnel continues to be a vital transportation link in the Mid-Atlantic region. After the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed on March 26, 2024, the tunnel became one of the primary alternate routes for drivers and trucks containing non-hazardous loads.

<doc id="1341969" wikidata="Q1638662" url="?curid=1341969" title="Hurricane Kenna">
<text>Hurricane Kenna was the fourth-most intense tropical cyclone on record in the Eastern Pacific basin, and at the time the third-most intense Pacific hurricane to strike the west coast of Mexico. Kenna was the sixteenth tropical depression, thirteenth tropical storm, seventh hurricane, sixth major hurricane, and third Category 5 hurricane of the 2002 Pacific hurricane season. After forming on October 22 to the south of Mexico from a tropical wave, forecasters consistently predicted the storm to strengthen much less than it actually did. Moving into an area of favorable upper-level conditions and warm sea surface temperatures, Kenna quickly strengthened to reach peak winds of as a Category 5 hurricane, on October 25, while located about southwest of Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco. Weakening as it turned to the northeast, the hurricane made landfall near San Blas, Nayarit as a Category 4 hurricane, with sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h), before dissipating on October 26 over the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains.

The name &quot;Kenna&quot; was retired from the list of Pacific hurricane names due to its effects on Mexico, which included US$101 million in damage and four deaths. The worst of the hurricane&#x27;s effects occurred between San Blas in Nayarit and Puerto Vallarta in Jalisco, where over 100 people were injured and thousands of homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed. 95% of the buildings in San Blas were damaged, and hundreds of buildings were destroyed along coastal areas of Puerto Vallarta.

==Meteorological history==

The origin of Hurricane Kenna can be traced to a tropical wave moving westward through the Caribbean Sea on October 16, possibly the same wave that passed near Barbados two days earlier. The wave entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on October 19, and a tropical disturbance along the wave axis gradually became better organized. Conditions favored continued development, and Dvorak classifications began late on October 20. Early on October 22, the system developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E while located about south of Manzanillo, Colima. Initially the depression was disorganized, with little inner convective structure and sporadic deep convection. Computer models predicted an increase in wind shear by 60 hours; as such the National Hurricane Center forecast the depression to strengthen to a peak strength of before weakening.

The depression quickly became better organized with a great increase in convection near the center, and six hours after forming it strengthened into Tropical Storm Kenna. Upper-level outflow and banding features improved in an organization, as well. With warm water temperatures of over and updated model forecasts anticipating light amounts of vertical wind shear, forecasters predicted Kenna to slowly intensify to reach winds of within 72 hours of October 22. The storm moved to the west-northwest around the periphery of a mid-level high-pressure system, and initially failed to strengthen further with much of its convection being associated with outer rainbands. On October 23, the outer rainbands dissipated and convection became more concentrated near the center, which coincided with a steady increase in strength. Late on October 23, Kenna intensified into a hurricane while located about southwest of Manzanillo.

Shortly after becoming a hurricane, Kenna began to rapidly intensify with a wide eye located within its well-defined central dense overcast. Early on October 24 Kenna became a major hurricane, and in a 24‑hour period the hurricane more than doubled its windspeed from winds to . After turning to the north and northeast in response to the flow ahead of a large mid to upper-level trough, Kenna attained peak winds of early on October 25 while located about southwest of Puerto Vallarta, the third Category 5 hurricane of the season. A Hurricane Hunter flight into the hurricane while it was near peak intensity recorded a pressure of 913 mbar (hPa), the fourth lowest recorded pressure for a Pacific hurricane.

Quickly after peaking, wind shear from the approaching trough weakened the hurricane, and by six hours after reaching peak intensity, the winds in Hurricane Kenna dropped to , after the eye nearly dissipated. Despite a 27 mbar increase in pressure in 12 hours, convective activity increased prior to Kenna making landfall. On October 25, Hurricane Kenna made landfall near San Blas in the state of Nayarit, as a Category 4 hurricane, with estimated sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h). Hurricane Kenna was at the time, the third most intense Pacific hurricane to strike Mexico. The hurricane rapidly weakened over the mountainous terrain of western Mexico, and the circulation dissipated on October 26 over the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains. The remnants continued northeastward into the Gulf of Mexico and the southeastern United States later that day, producing rainfall across the region.

==Preparations==

About 27 hours before landfall, Mexican officials issued a hurricane watch from Mazatlán to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco, with a tropical storm watch issued further south to Manzanillo. Six hours later when its track became more apparent, the watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning from Mazatlán to La Fortuna, with a tropical storm warning southward to Manzanillo.

Roughly 8,800 of the 9,000 residents in the landfall location, San Blas, evacuated, which ultimately contributed to a low death toll. Officials ordered for the evacuation of 50,000 residents and fishermen along the southwest coast of Mexico, including 3,000 in the Islas Marías, 10,000 near Mazatlán, and 15,000 near flood-prone areas. Civil authorities closed all schools and docks in potentially affected areas. The Mexican Red Cross prepared for the storm by shipping 215 tonnes of relief supplies such as food, water, clothing, and medicine to the Red Cross branch in Jalisco. Assistance from the Yucatán Peninsula delivered 10 tonnes of food and water, as well. The Mexican Red Cross prepared 20 emergency shelters in the state of Nayarit. Officials took security measures in Los Cabos, Baja California Sur, where the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation was meeting during the passage of the hurricane. Early forecasts indicated a possible threat to the meeting, causing the government to prepare for a potential alternate site. Officials recommended boats to stay at port due to severe conditions.

==Impact==
Few official surface observations are available for the passage of the hurricane. Upon making landfall, Kenna was accompanied with an estimated storm surge in San Blas. The surge also affected Puerto Vallarta, with reports of waves rushing inland from the bay. The hurricane dropped about of precipitation while passing about east of the offshore archipelago, Islas Marías. There, sustained winds reached an estimated . On land, Kenna dropped heavy rainfall peaking at at San Ignacio, Sinaloa, and near Manzanillo, Colima. The highest recorded sustained wind on land was about at Tepic, Nayarit, with wind gusts at Puerto Vallarta reaching . The hurricane also produced heavy rainfall in Guerrero, Michoacán, Colima, and Jalisco, and hit Baja California Sur with strong winds and rough seas.

In San Blas, strong winds from the hurricane damaged or destroyed 95% of the homes, with 1,540 houses damaged and 8,800 people affected. There, large commercial shrimp boats were swept up to inland from their docks. An elderly woman died in the city when the wall of her house collapsed on her. Large portions of the city were covered with building debris and sand washed from the ocean. Elsewhere in Nayarit, flying debris killed a person in Santiago Escuintla. There, two elderly men drowned, one by falling into a river. Both were believed to have been killed during the storm as they fled their homes. In Santiago Ixcuintla, the hurricane damaged 3,770 homes, and throughout Nayarit, strong winds from the hurricane destroyed the roofs of hundreds of houses. Federal authorities lost communications with at least 30 Indian villages due to the high winds of the hurricane. Kenna destroyed the entire banana, tobacco, and tomato crops in the rural areas of San Blas, Tecuala, and Acaponeta, leaving more than 700 subsistence farmers and their families in need of water and food.

In Puerto Vallarta, about southeast of the landfall location, the storm surge resulted in an estimated damage total of US$5 million, primarily to hotels. The surge flooded the hotels and other waterfront areas, and extended up to inland. Waist-deep floodwaters swept away vans and cars, ruining several vehicles. The passage of the hurricane destroyed 150 stores near the ocean and extensively damaged three hotels. Damage to the city&#x27;s port was minor.

The hurricane injured at least 52 in Puerto Vallarta and dozens in San Blas from widespread flying glass and other forms of debris, with two people seriously injured due to the hurricane. Ten municipalities suffered substantial damage, with insured damage in Mexico totaling . Rainfall from the hurricane spread across northern Mexico, causing minor flash floods and mudslides.

The remnants of Kenna entered the south-central United States on October 26, resulting in enhanced rainfall in various locations.

==Aftermath==

The Mexican government declared the region in Nayarit near the landfall of Kenna as a disaster area, allowing for the usage of emergency funds. Immediately after the passage of the hurricane, the Mexican Red Cross prepared 180 technical staff and volunteers from seven states to deliver 125 MT of food, medicine, and clothes to the areas most affected. The Mexican government deployed the Mexican Army to the area to remove fallen trees and establish water treatment plants to assist the affected population. The Mexican Navy was sent to assist to support medical personnel in the San Blas area, and the government Department for Family Development assisted the Mexican Red Cross in delivering food. Grupo Modelo, brewers of Corona beer, sent 6,600 gallons (25,000 liters) of drinking water and 1000 food sets for the San Blas area.

Backhoes and dump trucks gradually removed the debris and sand from San Blas. Dozens of storeowners, municipal employees, and volunteers in Puerto Vallarta worked to clear the debris caused by the storm. The remaining stores, bars, and shops placed signs on their windows describing they were open in an effort to attract the tourists still in the town. By about two months after the hurricane, most hotels, restaurants, and shops were reopened.

===Retirement===
In the spring of 2003, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name &quot;Kenna&quot; from its rotating eastern Pacific name lists due to the deaths and damage this hurricane caused, and it will never be used again for another tropical cyclone. &quot;Kenna&quot; was replaced with &quot;Karina&quot; for the 2008 season.

<text>The 1956 United States House of Representatives elections was an election for the United States House of Representatives to elect members to serve in the 85th United States Congress. They were held for the most part on November 6, 1956, while Maine held theirs on September 10. They coincided with the re-election of President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

With no major national issues and the economic upswing of the 1950s in full force, voters generally chose to uphold the status quo, keeping the Republican president and the Democratic Congress.

==Overall results==
410 incumbent members sought reelection, but 6 were defeated in primaries and 15 defeated in the general election for a total of 389 incumbents winning.




== Special elections ==
In these special elections, the winner was seated during 1956 or before January 3, 1957; ordered by election date.

<text>Achille Zavatta (6 May 1915 – 16 November 1993) was a French clown, artist and circus operator.

==Biography==
Zavatta was born in La Goulette, Tunisia, the son of Federico Zavatta, a circus owner. He started performing in his family&#x27;s circus show at the age of three, forming with his brothers Michel and Rolph, the &quot;Zavatta Trio&quot;. He was the interval act at the 1962 Eurovision Song Contest in Luxemburg. To this day the Zavatta Circus tours France and surrounding countries, these performances include live tiger acts, which means the circus cannot tour Britain under the Animal Welfare Act. The circus is rated as a top show in France.

<text>Fairview Pointe-Claire (corporately styled as &quot;CF Fairview Pointe-Claire&quot;) is the largest shopping mall in the West Island and one of the biggest on the Island of Montreal. It is located in the city of Pointe-Claire, Quebec, Canada, at the intersection of Trans-Canada Highway and Saint-Jean Boulevard.

Fairview Pointe-Claire attracts 8 million visitors each year. 175 stores occupy about spread on two levels of shopping space. It is one of Cadillac Fairview&#x27;s oldest shopping malls. The major tenants are Hudson&#x27;s Bay, Winners, HomeSense, Sports Experts/Atmosphere, La Maison Simons and Best Buy.

==History==
Fairview Pointe-Claire was inaugurated on August 12, 1965 with anchors Simpsons, Steinberg&#x27;s, Eaton&#x27;s and Pascal&#x27;s. It had exactly 70 tenants. Notable mid-sized tenants included Holt Renfrew, Ogilvy&#x27;s and Woolworth&#x27;s. Fairview Pointe-Claire was a single level mall at the time; only tenants Simpsons, Eaton&#x27;s, W.H. Smith Books, and Pascal&#x27;s had two floors. Although they initially had only two floors, Simpsons and Eaton&#x27;s were both built with the capacity to each house a third level in the future. Simpson&#x27;s was located on the east end of the mall and had on the parking its own auto centre with an Esso. Eaton&#x27;s was in the west end and back then used the English name (with the letter &quot;s&quot;) for the store signage of this location.

At the time of its opening, Fairview Pointe-Claire was the first enclosed shopping mall in the West Island, the first shopping centre in Quebec with either a Simpsons or Eaton&#x27;s store, as well as the second largest mall in all of Canada. Simpsons purchased a replica of Michelangelo&#x27;s Statue of David and installed it in the mall&#x27;s hallway, a move that was met with criticism.

In 1985, Fairview Pointe-Claire was extensively converted to a two-level shopping mall whose renovation was completed on August 14, almost to the day of its 20th anniversary. The mall went from 88 to 201 stores and its first floor was completely renovated. Among the additions was the introduction of the food court.

Simpsons was taken over by The Bay on January 29, 1989, with no layoffs in the store.

Pascal&#x27;s declared bankruptcy in 1991.

A Sears store of 164,000 square feet opened on August 12, 1992. It was a new construction built on the south side of the shopping centre. 

Eaton&#x27;s closed on October 17, 1999 after 34 years in the mall. Sears relocated in 2001 to Eaton&#x27;s former location. Sears&#x27;s original location is now home to Winners/HomeSense, Sports Experts/Atmosphere, Renaud-Bray, Old Navy and Starbucks Coffee.

On July 26, 2001, Déco Découverte opened one of its first two Quebec stores in Super C&#x27;s former space.

A Best Buy opened in the fall of 2005. It was built in the place of the torn down Pascal&#x27;s store, itself having been converted from 1992 to 1998 into an Aventure Électronique Superstore, competing against nearby Future Shop in Complexe Pointe-Claire . Like Aventure Électronique (but unlike Pascal&#x27;s), Best Buy can only be access from outdoor.

It was announced in September 2017 that the Sears at Fairview Pointe-Claire was targeted for closure along with nine other stores all located outside of Quebec. The Pointe-Claire location closed in December 2017. The first level was repurposed for dining with the food court moving into the space on April 1, 2021. The second and third floors of the location were replaced a year later by Simons on May 5, 2022. The old food court was subdivided for Dollarama and Linen Chest.

==Ownership==

Fairview Pointe-Claire was originally the joint property of Simpsons Limited and Cemp Investments, and managed by Fairview Shopping Centres Ltd (a subsidiary of Cemp Investments). The mall was built by Cadillac Development Corporation.

In 1974, Cadillac Development Corporation and Fairview Corporation merge to form Cadillac Fairview. From then on, Fairview Pointe-Claire was the joint property of Cadillac Fairview and Simpsons.

In 1984, Markborough Properties replaced Simpsons as co-owner of the mall. Cadillac Fairview retained its share of the mall.

In 1997, Markborough Properties was swallowed by Cambridge Shopping Centres which merge in 2001 with Ivanhoe Corporation to form Ivanhoé Cambridge.

In 2021, Cadillac Fairview swapped the 50% share it held in Galeries d&#x27;Anjou for Ivanhoé Cambridge&#x27;s in Fairview Pointe-Claire to become the sole owner of the mall.

==Public transportation==
The north parking lot of Fairview Pointe-Claire is home to Fairview bus terminus of the Société de transport de Montréal. A new light metro station Fairview–Pointe-Claire station of Réseau express métropolitain is under construction next to the mall.

<text>Complexe Desjardins is a mixed-use office, hotel, and shopping mall complex located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, in the Quartier des spectacles area of Saint Catherine Street. The project was designed to develop the eastern end of downtown Montreal, it is located in the quadrilateral formed by Saint Catherine, Saint-Urbain, Jeanne Mance and René Lévesque Boulevard.

Its architectural design consists of several towers housing offices of the Desjardins Group, Quebec Government offices and other companies, as well as a hotel, linked by an atrium shopping centre anchored by IGA. This design produces the effect of an indoor square. It is one of very few buildings in Canada to have its own postal code prefix, H5B.

The Complexe Desjardins is connected by the underground city to Place des Arts and the Place-des-Arts Metro station to the north, and the Complexe Guy-Favreau, the Palais des congrès de Montréal, and Place-d&#x27;Armes Metro station to the south.

The hotel in the complex opened as the Hotel Meridien Montreal in April 1976. It was later renamed the Wyndham Montreal, then the Hyatt Regency Montreal in 2003, then the DoubleTree by Hilton Montreal in December 2018.

On July 26, 1992, a man, whose body is still unidentified to this day, fell to his death fifty feet from the Complexe Desjardins.

==Monument à Alphonse Desjardins==

Yves Trudeau&#x27;s Monument à Alphonse Desjardins was located outside at the corner of St. Urbain and St. Catherine from 1976 to 1995 but since relocated to Parc Catchpaw, in Orford, Quebec.

<text>Rev. Edward Bickersteth (19 March 1786 – 28 February 1850) was an English evangelical clergyman from the prominent Bickersteth family.

==Life==

He was born at Kirkby Lonsdale, Westmorland, the fourth son of Henry Bickersteth, a surgeon. Bickersteth attended Kirby Longsdale Grammar School and practised as a solicitor at Norwich from 1812 to 1815.

Within space of only 11 days in December 1815 he was ordained both as a deacon and priest. In January 1816 travelled to Africa to inspect and report on the work of the Church Missionary Society (CMS). He continued to travel overseas in connection with the work of the CMS throughout his life. He was the secretary of the CMS from 1824 to 1831.

On receiving the living of Watton, Hertfordshire, in 1830, he resigned his secretaryship, but continued to lecture and preach, both for the &quot;Church Missionary Society&quot; and the &quot;Society for the Conversion of the Jews&quot;. He was instrumental in the merger of the Anglican Central Committee and the Continental society in 1840 to form the Foreign Aid Society which supported evangelical Protestant ministry on the continent of Europe.

Bickersteth met Lord Ashley in 1835. The Earl made a visit of several days to Watton Rectory in the summer 1836. Following this visit the pair became friends, with Bickersteth becoming one of the reformer&#x27;s close advisers.

He was active in promoting the Evangelical Alliance of 1845, strongly opposed the Tractarian Movement, and was one of the founders of the 1849 created Irish Church Missions, and also of the 1841 created Parker Society, societies. Bickersteth&#x27;s library was sold at auction by Edmund Hodgson on 17 February 1851 (and 11 following days). It contained over 3900 lots. A copy of the catalogue is available at Cambridge University Library (shelfmark Munby.c.116(6)).

==Works==

His works include &quot;A Scripture Help&quot; (London, 1816), which has been translated into many European languages, and &quot;Christian Psalmody&quot; (London, 1833), a collection of over 700 hymns, which forms the basis of the &quot;Hymnal Companion&quot; (London, 1870), compiled by his son, Edward Henry Bickersteth, bishop of Exeter (1885–1890).

==Family==
Bickersteth was the brother of Henry, Baron Langdale, Master of the Rolls (1836–1851), and uncle of Robert Bickersteth, Bishop of Ripon (1857–1884).

His wife Sarah, whom Bickersteth married in 1812, was the eldest daughter of Thomas Bignold of Norwich, together they had six children. Edward Henry Bickersteth (1825-1906) Bishop of Exeter was his only son and Edward Bickersteth, founder of the Cambridge Mission to Delhi and later bishop of South Tokyo, his grandson.

Edward Bickersteth, Dean of Lichfield, was his nephew.

<doc id="1342013" wikidata="Q1297879" url="?curid=1342013" title="1954 United States House of Representatives elections">
<text>The 1954 United States House of Representatives elections was an election for the United States House of Representatives to elect members to serve in the 84th United States Congress. They were held for the most part on November 2, 1954, in the middle of Dwight Eisenhower&#x27;s first presidential term, while Maine held theirs on September 13. Eisenhower&#x27;s Republican Party lost eighteen seats in the House, giving the Democratic Party a majority that it would retain in every House election until 1994. This was nonetheless the first occasion when a Republican won a seat from Florida since 1882, and the first when the GOP won a seat from Texas since 1930.

Perhaps the major reason for the Republican defeat was the backlash against the Army–McCarthy Hearings, in which prominent Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy accused countless political and intellectual figures of having communist ties, usually with no evidence. Another issue was the Dixon–Yates contract to supply power to the Atomic Energy Commission. Other factors included a comment made in Detroit by Defense Secretary Charles Wilson, former president of General Motors, equating unemployed auto workers with &quot;lazy kennel dogs who sit... and yell.&quot;

However, it has been pointed out that losses in the midterm election were considerably less than the White House party generally faces in the midterm elections, and this has been attributed to the overall popularity of President Eisenhower, who participated in the campaign along with Vice-President Richard Nixon and other members of the cabinet.

Sam Rayburn of Texas became Speaker of the House, exchanging places with new Minority Leader Joseph W. Martin Jr. of Massachusetts; they went back to what they had been before the 1952 elections.

<text>Galeries d&#x27;Anjou (formerly &quot;CF Galeries d&#x27;Anjou&quot;) is a shopping mall located in the borough of Anjou in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Major tenants include Hudson&#x27;s Bay, Simons, The Brick, Winners, Sports Experts/Atmosphere and Aubainerie. In addition to the main indoor shopping centre, Galeries d&#x27;Anjou has several stores around its parking lot including Best Buy and Rona l&#x27;Entrepôt.

Formerly owned by Cadillac Fairview, the mall had long been associated with the company&#x27;s other shopping centres in the area Fairview Pointe-Claire, Carrefour Laval and Promenades Saint-Bruno. It is now wholly-owned by Ivanhoé Cambridge and operated by JLL. It is one of two super-regional malls in eastern Montreal, along with Place Versailles. Galeries d&#x27;Anjou is over and was by far the largest shopping mall on the Island of Montreal throughout the 1970s and much of the 1980s.

==History==
In 1967, the part of Radisson Street in Anjou was renamed Galeries d&#x27;Anjou Boulevard in honor of the upcoming shopping mall. Construction of the shopping mall began in the spring of 1967 and it was overall completed in May 1968 as planned. However, further work needed to be done indoor before the mall could be opened to the public.

Galeries d&#x27;Anjou inaugurated on August 8, 1968 with 85 stores. Its original anchors were the department stores Simpsons and Eaton&#x27;s, and the supermarkets Steinberg&#x27;s and Dominion. As with Fairview Pointe-Claire, Simpsons and Eaton&#x27;s were located at the extremities of the mall. Simpsons always had three levels, making it the largest store of Galeries d&#x27;Anjou, but only its first and second floors were used to sell merchandise (its basement was at the time reserved for store services and an employees&#x27; cafeteria). Eaton&#x27;s had two floors and, unlike its other Montreal stores at the time, used the French name Eaton (without the &quot;&#x27;s&quot;) for its location at Galeries d&#x27;Anjou. Both Simpson&#x27;s and Eaton&#x27;s had a restaurant inside their store. Steinberg&#x27;s and Dominion faced each another in the north side of the mall and were separated from one another by a corridor. Upon its opening, Galeries d&#x27;Anjou was the second largest shopping mall in Canada after Yorkdale in Toronto. The mall was the joint property of Simpsons Limited and Cemp Investments. It is the second shopping centre in the Montreal area developed and owned by the duo of Simpsons and Cemp Investments.

In 1975, then manager and co-owner Cadillac Fairview announced the expansion of Galeries d&#x27;Anjou to bring the total size of the shopping centre from 700,000 to 920,000 square feet. As a result, 65 new stores opened on March 25, 1976, in a new mall wing. This new section was anchored a few months later by Sears which inaugurated on August 18, 1976.

In 1979, Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company acquired the Simpsons chain which it kept as a subsidiary. In 1984, Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company transferred to its real-estate unit Markborough Properties the shopping malls that were owned by Simpsons. Galeries d&#x27;Anjou was therefore the joint property of Cadillac Fairview and Markborough. Simpsons continued operating its store in the mall until it converted to The Bay in March 1989. The store&#x27;s basement once served in the early 1990s as a warehouse for The Bay&#x27;s bargains in Montreal, specifically on household products such as large appliances and home furnishings.

Dominion rebranded as Provigo on June 29, 1981. Based on past telephone directories, the Provigo at Galeries d&#x27;Anjou lasted until 1989-1990. Ironically, the Steinberg&#x27;s store in the mall was later rebranded as a Provigo for a brief time in 1992 before being converted into a Maxi supermarket that same year.

Galeries d&#x27;Anjou underwent through a $18-million renovation in 1993. The shopping centre did not increase size this time, but it added 30 new retail stores, a new food court in addition to making a series of interior upgrades to rejuvenate the 25-year-old mall that had become outdated and was losing young customers to rival Place Versailles.

In 1997, Cambridge Shopping Centres absorbed Markborough along with its ownership in shopping malls like Galeries d&#x27;Anjou. Cambridge later merged with Ivanhoe Corporation in 2001 to form Ivanhoé Cambridge.

Eaton&#x27;s went out of business in 1999. Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company acquired its first floor for a new Zellers store that opened in Spring 2000. The second floor was taken over by The Brick four years later on April 14, 2004.
In August 2013, Galeries d&#x27;Anjou introduced a new section of 150,000 square feet featuring Simons and some 15 other retailers. Simons itself was built on the mall&#x27;s parking lot, while the small tenants took the site of the former food court whose building was torn down to accommodate the expansion. The food court was relocated on the other side of the shopping centre near Zellers (later Target).

Target acquired the lease of Zellers at Galeries d&#x27;Anjou, allowing it to open its own store on October 18, 2013. After Target closed all its stores in Canada in April 2015, its space at Galeries d&#x27;Anjou was left vacant for two years. Winners, Saks Off 5th and Old Navy opened in 2017 in the former Target location. Saks and Winners both opened on August 3, 2017, whereas Old Navy arrived two months later in October. In spite of these major arrivals, a small space of the former Target store was still unoccupied. It has since been filled by a Cacao 70 chocolatier shop and a Copper Branch restaurant, both of which are accessible only from outside. Moreover, a Dollarama opened up on the second floor and appears to have taken the space of a downsizing The Brick.

The Sears at Galeries d&#x27;Anjou was among the stores that closed during the chain&#x27;s final day in Canada on January 14, 2018. The store opened at the former Sears on November 2, 2022.

On May 19, 2021, Ivanhoé Cambridge became the sole owner of the mall by acquiring Cadillac Fairview&#x27;s share of Galeries d&#x27;Anjou in exchange for Ivanhoé Cambridge&#x27;s share of Fairview Pointe-Claire. Prior to this, the two shopping centres were co-owned by Ivanhoé Cambridge and Cadillac Fairview, with the latter serving as manager of both malls.

==Public transit access==
Most buses that stop at Galeries D’Anjou go to Radisson metro station. All buses stop on both sides of Galeries D’Anjou boulevard.

It is expected that with the Blue line extension into Anjou the future metro station will connect underground to the mall through a pedestrian tunnel. On February 16, 2023, it was announced that Ivanhoé Cambridge and the STM, owners of the Montreal metro, have agreed to the construction of the brand new Anjou terminus station of the Blue Line to take place right near the mall. Expropriation of the affected mall space by the STM is expected to occur in March 2024, which would give time to the affected businesses to relocate elsewhere while the new station is being constructed. The station is projected to open in 2029.

<text>Joseph Blackburn (died 1787) was an English painter who worked mainly in British North America. His notable works include portraits of Hugh Jones (circa 1777) and Colonel Theodore Atkinson (circa 1760).

==Life and career==
He seems to have been the son of a painter, and to have had a studio in Boston from 1755 until 1765; among his patrons were many important early American families, including the Apthorps, Amorys, Bulfinches, Lowells, Ewings, Saltonstalls, Winthrops, Winslows and Otises of Boston. Blackburn spent time in Bermuda (1752–1753), Newport (1754), Boston (1755–1758), and Portsmouth (1758–1762). In late 1763 he returned to London and painted portraits in southwestern England, Wales, and Dublin between 1768 and 1777. Approximately one hundred fifty of Blackburn&#x27;s portraits survive. He excelled at painting textiles (i.e., representing the shimmer of silks, the texture of laces, and the folds of fabrics).

Some of his portraits are in the possession of the public library of Lexington, Massachusetts, and of the Massachusetts Historical Society, but most of them are privately owned and are scattered over the country, the majority being in Boston. One portrait, of Elizabeth Browne Rogers completed in 1761, is part of the permanent American art collection at Reynolda House Museum of American Art located in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.
John Singleton Copley was Blackburn&#x27;s pupil, and it is said that he finally left his studio in Boston, through jealousy of Copley&#x27;s superior success. His pictures were long attributed to Copley. 

&quot;Now, thanks to evidence found within records held in our collections, we are able to confirm that Joseph Blackburn lived and died in the city of Worcester. He and his family lived in Broad Street in the parish of St. Nicholas. The exact date they moved there is unclear, but he certainly is a resident in 1768. They also leased properties around St. Martins Gate in the city, including The White Horse pub. Joseph inherited the lease for the properties after his father, Joseph Blackburn, gentleman, of Kinfare, (now Kinver), Staffordshire, and possibly his aunt, Henrietta Blackburn of Worcester died in 1759.

&quot;The 1759 will of Henrietta mentions Joseph’s wife Mary and their two daughters, Henrietta and Elizabeth. His daughters both married local men: Henrietta to William Hill and Elizabeth to George Squire, but both women appear to have died without children. ...&quot;

Art historian Lawrence Park authored, and the American Antiquarian Society published, the first biographical and critical study of Blackburn in 1923, restoring this long-overlooked artist to the attention of scholars and connoisseurs.

==Dates of birth and death==

There is a degree of confusion about the dates of birth and death of Blackburn. The most common suggestion for year of death is 1778 (see for instance the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; and the &quot;American Artists Bluebook&quot;) whereas Microsoft Encarta suggests 1774. 1730 is usually posited as the year of birth but it is at best an estimate.

Some sources still give 1700–1765 as Blackburn&#x27;s years. These most likely derive from the 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, published prior to Lawrence Park&#x27;s review, &quot;Joseph Blackburn – Portrait Painter&quot;, printed in the &quot;Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society&quot; in 1922, which established many of the known works of Blackburn.

In 2015 Worcestershire Archives announced that they had located details of Blackburn&#x27;s burial in Worcester in 1787.

<text>Journey&#x27;s End is a 1928 dramatic play by English playwright R. C. Sherriff, set in the trenches near Saint-Quentin, Aisne, towards the end of the First World War. The story plays out in the officers&#x27; dugout of a British Army infantry company from 18 to 21 March 1918, providing a glimpse of the officers&#x27; lives in the last few days before Operation Michael.

The play was first performed at the Apollo Theatre in London by the Incorporated Stage Society on 9 December 1928, starring a young Laurence Olivier, and soon moved to other West End theatres for a two-year run. It was included in Burns Mantle&#x27;s &quot;The Best Plays of 1928–1929&quot;. The piece quickly became internationally popular, with numerous productions and tours in English and other languages. A 1930 film version was followed by other adaptations, and the play set a high standard for other works dealing with similar themes, and influenced playwrights including Noël Coward. It was Sherriff&#x27;s seventh play. He considered calling it &quot;Suspense&quot; or &quot;Waiting&quot;, but eventually found a title in the closing line of a chapter of an unidentified book, &quot;It was late in the evening when we came at last to our journey&#x27;s end.&quot;

==Plot summary==

=== Act I ===
In the British trenches facing Saint-Quentin, Captain Hardy converses with Lieutenant Osborne, an older man and public school master, who has come to relieve him. Hardy jokes about the behaviour of Captain Stanhope, who has turned to alcohol to cope with the stress that the war has caused him. While Hardy jokes, Osborne defends Stanhope and describes him as &quot;the best company commander we&#x27;ve got&quot;.

Private Mason, a servant cook, often forgets about ingredients and key parts of the food that he prepares for the officers. He is really part of the infantry but the company has let him be a part-time cook.

Second Lieutenant Trotter is a rotund officer commissioned from the ranks who likes his food; he cannot stand the war and counts down each hour that he serves in the front line by drawing circles onto a piece of paper and then colouring them in.

Second Lieutenant James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Raleigh is a young and naive officer who joins the company. Raleigh knew Stanhope from school, where Stanhope was skipper at rugby; Raleigh refers to Stanhope as Dennis. He also has a sister whom Stanhope is dating.

Raleigh admits that he requested to be sent to Stanhope&#x27;s company. Osborne hints to Raleigh that Stanhope will not be the same person he knew from school, as the experiences of war have changed him; however, Raleigh does not seem to understand.

Stanhope is angry that Raleigh has been allowed to join him and describes the boy as a hero-worshipper. As Stanhope is in a relationship with Raleigh&#x27;s sister Madge, he is concerned that Raleigh will write home and inform his sister of Stanhope&#x27;s drinking. Stanhope tells Osborne that he will censor Raleigh&#x27;s letters so this will not happen; Osborne does not approve.

Stanhope has a keen sense of duty and feels that he must continue to serve rather than take leave to which he is entitled. He criticises another soldier, Second Lieutenant Hibbert, whom he thinks is faking neuralgia in the eye so that he can be sent home instead of continuing fighting.

Osborne puts a tired and somewhat drunk Stanhope to bed. Stanhope, as well as the other officers, refers to Osborne as &quot;Uncle&quot;.

===Act II===

==== Scene 1 ====
Trotter and Mason converse about the bacon rashers which the company has to eat. Trotter talks about how the start of spring makes him feel youthful; he also talks about the hollyhocks which he has planted. These conversations are a way of escaping the trenches and the reality of the war.

Osborne and Raleigh discuss how slowly time passes at the front, and the fact that both of them played rugby before the war and that Osborne was a schoolmaster before he signed up to fight. While Raleigh appears interested, Osborne points out that it is of little use now.

Osborne describes the madness of war when describing how German soldiers allowed the British to rescue a wounded soldier in no man&#x27;s land, while the next day the two sides shelled each other heavily. He describes the war as &quot;silly&quot;.

Stanhope announces that the barbed wire around the trenches needs to be mended. Information gathered from a captured German indicates that an enemy attack is planned to begin on Thursday morning, only two days away.

Stanhope confiscates a letter from Raleigh, insisting on his right to censor it. Stanhope is in a relationship with Raleigh&#x27;s sister and is worried that, in the letter, Raleigh will reveal Stanhope&#x27;s growing alcoholism. Full of self-loathing, Stanhope accedes to Osborne&#x27;s offer to read the letter for him. The letter is, in fact, full of praise for Stanhope. The scene ends with Stanhope quietly demurring from Osborne&#x27;s suggestion to re-seal the envelope.

==== Scene 2 ====
In a meeting with the Sergeant Major it is announced that the attack is taking place on Thursday. Stanhope and the Sergeant-Major discuss battle plans. The Colonel relays orders that the General wants a raid to take place on the German trench prior to the attack, &quot;a surprise daylight raid&quot;, all previous raids having been made under cover of darkness, and that they want to be informed of the outcome by 7 p.m. Stanhope states that such a plan is absurd, and that the General and his staff merely want this so their dinner will not be delayed.

The Colonel agrees with Stanhope but says that orders are orders, and they must be obeyed. Later, it is stated that in a similar raid, after the British artillery bombardment, the Germans had tied red rag to the gaps in the barbed wire so that their soldiers knew exactly where to train their machine guns.

It is decided that Osborne and Raleigh will be the officers to go on the raid, despite the fact that Raleigh has only recently entered the war.

Hibbert complains to Stanhope about the neuralgia he states he has been suffering from. Stanhope replies: &quot;it would be better to die from the pain, than from being shot for desertion&quot;. Hibbert maintains that he does have neuralgia and the right to leave the battlefield to seek treatment, but when Stanhope threatens to shoot him if he goes, Hibbert breaks down crying. He says &quot;Go on then, shoot!&quot;, suggesting that he would rather die than stay on the battlefield. The two soldiers admit to each other that they feel exactly the same way, and are struggling to cope with the stresses that the war is putting on them. Stanhope comforts Hibbert by saying they can go on duty together.

Osborne reads aloud to Trotter from Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;; another attempt to escape from the realities of the war. The scene ends with the idealistic Raleigh, who is untouched by the war, stating that it is &quot;frightfully exciting&quot; that he has been picked for the raid.

===Act III===

==== Scene 1 ====
There is confirmation that the raid is still going ahead. The Colonel states that a German soldier needs to be captured so that intelligence can be extracted from him. Osborne admits to Stanhope that he knows he is probably not coming back, and asks Stanhope to look after his most cherished possessions and send them to his wife if he does not return after the raid. In the minutes before going over the top, Raleigh and Osborne talk about home – the New Forest and the town of Lyndhurst – to pass the time. Smoke-bombs are fired, the soldiers move towards the German trench, and a young German soldier is captured. However, Stanhope finds out that Osborne has been killed although Raleigh has survived.

Stanhope sarcastically states, &quot;How awfully nice – if the Brigadier&#x27;s pleased&quot;, when the Colonel&#x27;s first concern is whether information has been gathered, not whether all the soldiers have returned safely. Six of ten other ranks have been killed.

==== Scene 2 ====
Trotter, Stanhope, and Hibbert drink and talk about women. They all appear to be enjoying themselves until Hibbert is annoyed when Stanhope tells him to go to bed, and he tells Stanhope to go to bed instead, then Stanhope suddenly becomes angry and begins to shout at Hibbert, and tells him to clear off and get out.

Stanhope also becomes angry at Raleigh, who did not eat with the officers that night but preferred to eat with his men. Stanhope is offended by this, and Raleigh eventually admits that he feels he cannot eat while he thinks that Osborne is dead, and his body is in No Man&#x27;s Land. Stanhope is angry because Raleigh had seemed to imply that Stanhope did not care about Osborne&#x27;s death because Stanhope was eating and drinking. Stanhope yells at Raleigh that he drinks to cope with the fact that Osborne died, to forget. Stanhope asks to be left alone and angrily tells Raleigh to leave.

==== Scene 3 ====
The German attack on the British trenches approaches, and the Sergeant Major tells Stanhope they should expect heavy losses. When it arrives, Hibbert is reluctant to get out of bed and into the trenches.

A message is relayed to Stanhope telling him that Raleigh has been injured by a shell and that his spine is damaged, meaning he cannot move his legs. Stanhope orders that Raleigh be brought into his dugout. He comforts Raleigh while Raleigh lies in bed. Raleigh says that he is cold and that it is becoming dark; Stanhope moves the candle to the bed and goes deeper into the dugout to fetch a blanket, but, by the time he returns, Raleigh has died.

The shells continue to explode in the background. Stanhope receives a message that he is needed. He gets up to leave and, after he has exited, a mortar hits the dugout causing it to collapse and entomb Raleigh&#x27;s corpse.
== Productions (professional) ==
Sherriff had trouble getting &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; produced in the West End, writing that &quot;Every management in London had turned the play down. They said people didn&#x27;t want war plays [...] &#x27;How can I put on a play with no leading lady?&#x27; one [theatre manager] had asked complainingly.&quot; Sherriff used &quot;No Leading Lady&quot; as the title of his autobiography, published in 1968.

Geoffrey Dearmer of the Incorporated Stage Society suggested that Sherriff send the script to George Bernard Shaw, because a good word from him would convince the ISS committee to stage it. Shaw replied that, like other sketches of trench life, it was a &quot;useful [corrective] to the romantic conception of war&quot;, and that &quot;As a &#x27;slice of life&#x27; – horribly abnormal life – I should say let it be performed by all means&quot;.
&quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; opened as a semi-staged production running for two nights at the Apollo Theatre. It starred Laurence Olivier, then only 21, offered the role of Stanhope by the then equally unknown director James Whale. Under a new producer, Maurice Browne, the play soon transferred to the Savoy Theatre where it ran for three weeks starting on 21 January 1929. The entire cast from the Apollo reprised their roles (George Zucco playing Osborne and Maurice Evans Raleigh) except for Olivier, who had secured another role and was replaced by Colin Clive as Stanhope. The play was extremely well received: in the words of Whale&#x27;s biographer James Curtis, it &quot;managed to coalesce, at the right time and in the right manner, the impressions of a whole generation of men who were in the war and who had found it impossible, through words or deeds, to adequately express to their friends and families what the trenches had been like&quot;. It transferred to the Prince of Wales Theatre, where it ran for a further two years.

Whale travelled to the United States to direct the Broadway production in 1930 at Henry Miller&#x27;s Theatre. Colin Keith-Johnston played Stanhope, and Leon Quartermaine Osborne. By late 1929 the work was played by 14 companies in English and 17 in other languages, in London, New York, Paris (in English), Stockholm, Berlin, Rome, Vienna, Madrid, and Budapest, and in Canada, Australia, and South Africa. The first revival of the work was in 1934, with Horne, Stoker and Smith reprising their original roles, and Reginald Tate as Stanhope. The first New York revival was in 1939, with Keith-Johnston again playing Stanhope. There were further London revivals in 1950 (which won enthusiastic praise from Field Marshal Montgomery) and 1972. The play was staged as the final production of the Edinburgh Gateway Company during the Edinburgh International Festival in August 1965.

In 2004, the play was again revived in London, directed by David Grindley. From its initial twelve-week season at the Comedy Theatre from January 2004, it transferred to the Playhouse Theatre and the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre, finally closing on 18 February 2005. A touring company took the same production to over 30 venues across Britain in 2004 and 2005 and back to London, to the New Ambassadors Theatre from September 2005 to January 2006. Grindley&#x27;s production received its Broadway debut in 2007. Starring Hugh Dancy, Boyd Gaines, Jefferson Mays and Stark Sands, it opened in New York at the Belasco Theatre on 22 February 2007 and closed on 10 June after 125 performances. Grindley&#x27;s production was revived in 2011 for a UK tour from March to June, and transferred to the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre in the West End from July to September. The Sell A Door Theatre Company ran this play at the Greenwich Theatre until 17 February 2013. During 2014 it was presented at the Octagon Theatre, Bolton; directed by David Thacker, it featured David Birrell, Richard Graham and, as Stanhope, James Dutton.

== Productions (amateur) ==
Over the years there have been numerous amateur productions, the all-male cast making the play a particularly attractive choice for boys&#x27; schools, scout troops and other all-male environments. The British Scout Association owns a share of the rights to the play.

During the 1930s, the Pavilion Theatre in Selsey, Sussex, staged several productions of &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;. Sherriff (who had a holiday home nearby) attended a rehearsal in 1933, and advised the cast before his departure to Hollywood.

On 15 April 1939, Dirk Bogarde&#x27;s first starring role was as Raleigh in a production of &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; with Newick Amateur Dramatic Society in Sussex.

In January 1944, during the Second World War, a production was staged by members of the Royal Natal Carbineers at El Khatatba, Egypt. Other productions were staged by British prisoners in Changi Prison, Singapore (February 1943); at Tamarkan, Thailand, a Japanese labour camp on the Burma Railway (July 1943); in Stalag 344, near Lamsdorf, Germany (July 1944); and in Campo P.G. 75, near Bari, Italy.

In 2015 the Shute Theatre and Arts Guild (STAG) staged a production of the play in St Michael&#x27;s Church, Shute, Devon, directed by Elisabeth Miller.

In August 2018 a production was staged to commemorate the end of the First World War at St John&#x27;s School, Leatherhead, and the Leatherhead Theatre, directed by Graham Pountney.

In September 2018 a production was staged by Fintry Amateur Dramatic Society (FADS), in &quot;The Studio&quot;, a converted barn outside Killearn, Stirling.

==Adaptations==
===Film===
In 1930, James Whale directed an eponymous film based on the play, starring Colin Clive, David Manners and Ian Maclaren. A German remake, &quot;The Other Side&quot; (&quot;Die andere Seite&quot;), was directed by Heinz Paul in 1931. The play is the basis for the film &quot;Aces High&quot; (1976), although the action was switched from the infantry to the Royal Flying Corps. A second eponymous British film adaptation was released in 2017, with a wider theatrical release in the spring of 2018.

===Television===
The play was televised by the BBC Television Service, live from its Alexandra Palace studios, on 11 November 1937, in commemoration of Armistice Day. Condensed into a one-hour version by the producer George More O&#x27;Ferrall, some short sequences from the film &quot;Westfront 1918&quot; (1930) by G. W. Pabst were used for scene-setting purposes. Reginald Tate starred as Stanhope, with Basil Gill as Osborne, Norman Pierce as Trotter, Wallace Douglas as Raleigh, J. Neil More as the Colonel, R. Brooks Turner as the Company Sergeant-Major, Alexander Field as Mason, Reginald Smith as Hardy, and Olaf Olsen as the young German soldier. Because it was broadcast live, and the technology to record television programmes did not exist at the time, no visual records of the production survive other than still photographs.

The play was adapted for television in 1988, starring Jeremy Northam as Stanhope, Edward Petherbridge as Osborne, and Timothy Spall as Trotter. It held close to the original script although there were changes, the most obvious being the depiction on camera of the raid, which happens off-stage in the theatre production.

===Radio===
A radio adaptation by Peter Watts was produced for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Theatre&quot; in November 1970, featuring Martin Jarvis as Captain Stanhope.

==Legacy==
Other plays of the period dealing with the war tended to be judged by the standard of &quot;Journey&#x27;s End.&quot; The play and its characters also influenced other writers. In 1930, Noël Coward briefly played the role of Stanhope while on tour in the Far East. He did not consider his performance successful, writing afterwards that his audience &quot;politely watched me take a fine part in a fine play and throw it into the alley.&quot; However, he was &quot;strongly affected by the poignancy of the play itself&quot;, and was inspired to write &quot;Post-Mortem&quot;, his own &quot;angry little vilification of war&quot;, shortly afterwards.

An alternative-timeline version of Raleigh appears in the 1995 novel &quot;The Bloody Red Baron&quot; by Kim Newman. The final series of the British comedy programme &quot;Blackadder&quot; (&quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot;) focuses on the same theme and setting, sometimes with heavy parallels. In &quot;Withnail &amp; I&quot; the out-of-work actor Marwood (played by Paul McGann) is seen reading a copy of the play in the holiday cottage and goes on to win a role in a touring production by the close of the film.

The play is part of the British GCSE English literature qualification that is studied and tested in secondary schools, specifically the Cambridge IGCSE and Pearson Edexcel IGCSE specifications for English.

<doc id="1342025" wikidata="Q7894718" url="?curid=1342025" title="University Health Network">
<text>University Health Network (UHN) is a public research and teaching hospital network in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is affiliated with the University of Toronto, and is the largest health research organization in Canada, ranking first in Canada for total research funding.

The network includes four hospitals – Toronto General Hospital, Toronto Western Hospital, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre – West Park Healthcare Centre, the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, and The Michener Institute, a post-secondary institution granting diplomas and certificates in health sciences and leadership. In the 2019-2020 fiscal year, there were more than 39,000 acute inpatient stays and close to 121,000 emergency department visits across the three acute care hospitals.

&quot;Newsweek&quot; has consistently named UHN&#x27;s Toronto General Hospital as among the world&#x27;s top hospitals, most recently ranking Toronto General as the world&#x27;s 3rd best hospital in 2024, and first in Canada. The hospital was named Canada&#x27;s top research hospital by Research Infosource from 2015 to 2022.

==History==

A series of mergers over many years has resulted in the UHN in its current form. In 1986, the Toronto Western Hospital and the Toronto General Hospital merged to form the Toronto Hospital. In 1998, the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre joined, with the resulting institution named the University Health Network in 1999. The Toronto Rehabilitation Institute joined in 2011, facilitating rehabilitation services for patients as they transitioned out of acute care. All four hospitals are affiliated with the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Toronto and serve as teaching hospitals for resident physicians, nurses, and other healthcare professions. 2016 saw the integration of The Michener Institute into the UHN. The Michener Institute for Education was originally established in 1958 and is the first non-medical unit to join the UHN. On April 1, 2024, West Park Healthcare Centre joined the UHN.

== Programs ==
UHN and Sinai Health System jointly run the SHS-UHN Antimicrobial Stewardship Program, advocating for improved patient access to appropriate antibiotics while combating antimicrobial resistance. The program is led by infectious diseases specialist Andrew Morris, who joined as founding director at its inception in 2009.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, UHN received a $323,981 grant from the Public Health Agency of Canada&#x27;s Immunization Partnership Fund to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake among personal support workers and their patients.

<text>Bands Reunited is a television program produced by VH1 in 2004. Hosted by Aamer Haleem, the show documents attempted reunions of formerly popular musical groups for special concerts in either London or Los Angeles.

A show normally consists of the crew first hunting down the ex-members of the band (often first in a ruse) one-by-one, and convincing them to agree for the one-time concert. The members are &quot;contracted&quot; by signing an LP record by their former band. The band members are interviewed, usually focusing on the reasons of their disbandment. The final segment is the formal reunion of the band in the rehearsing studio, and a joint interview about having disbanded. If the reunion was successful, the episode ends with the final performance.

In 2005, VH1 attempted to reunite the English rock band the Smiths, but the show abandoned its attempt after Aamer Haleem unsuccessfully apprehended their former lead vocalist Morrissey before a show.

== Criticism ==
The artificial and invasive nature of the reality show, and the contractual arrangements behind it, have been criticized. Kurt Harland of Information Society detailed his own negative experiences with the program, and how his experiences differed from the portrayal of events as broadcast, on his website; citing examples of misinformation, poor background research and manipulation from the show&#x27;s production crew, regarding the show to have been more interested in sensationalising his band&#x27;s breakup than a genuine reunion.

<doc id="1342036" wikidata="Q4756292" url="?curid=1342036" title="Andrew Barrowman">
<text>Andrew Barrowman (born 27 November 1984) is a Scottish retired professional footballer, who played as a striker. A journeyman, Barrowman played for 15 different sides during his career, including Inverness Caledonian Thistle, Ross County and Dunfermline Athletic in Scotland and Birmingham City and Walsall in England.

He spent two years as sporting director of Kelty Hearts before becoming chief executive of Raith Rovers in 2023.

==Career==

===Birmingham City===
Barrowman was born in Wishaw, North Lanarkshire. He joined Birmingham City at the age of 16, having been with Rangers for four years as a schoolboy. In 2002, he represented Scotland under-19s in the first qualifying round for the 2003 UEFA European Under-19 Championship. He had previously represented Scotland at other youth levels.

He signed his first senior contract at Birmingham for the start of the 2003–04 season, but made his debut in the Football League as a Crewe Alexandra player, in a match against Bradford City on 14 October 2003, after signing on a month-long loan. He hit his first goal in his next match, a 3–0 victory against Derby County four days later.

Between November and the close of the season, he played once in the Premier League for Birmingham City, at home against Leicester City. In the summer of 2004, his contract was renewed.

Loaned to Blackpool for the first three months of the 2004–05 season, Barrowman made his debut against Sheffield Wednesday, coming on as a substitute in a 2–1 home loss. He walked out on the club after another substitute appearance.

===Walsall===
Barrowman would prove never to become a regular squad member at St Andrew&#x27;s. In January 2006 he signed for Walsall. He made his debut in a 5–0 defeat to Brentford, which proved to be the final act of manager Paul Merson&#x27;s spell as manager. Barrowman gave away a penalty in this game with a &quot;bizarre handball&quot; with the score at 4–0. His fortunes improved the week after when he helped to rescue a point on his home debut against Scunthorpe United. With Walsall down to ten men, Barrowman latched onto a long ball and lobbed the goalkeeper to make it 2–2.

===Return to Scotland===
On 26 July 2006, Barrowman returned to Scotland and signed a one-year contract with Scottish Premier League club Kilmarnock, but after initially failing to break into the first team he joined Queen of the South on a month&#x27;s loan during September. This loan deal was subsequently extended until the end of December. On 1 February 2007, after his release from Rugby Park, he signed a short-term contract with Queen of the South until the end of the season.

Barrowman scored once for Queen of the South, his goal coming in a 2–2 draw against future club Dundee on 17 March 2007. He signed for Ross County for the 2007–08 season. He hit terrific form during his first season with County, scoring a total of 29 goals, 24 in the league, which helped the club to win the Second Division championship. In late May he turned down a contract extension with County in the hope of moving to a bigger club. Inverness Caledonian Thistle manager Craig Brewster captured his main transfer target on 25 June 2008 when, after much deliberation, Barrowman committed himself to a three-year contract with the club. He scored on his league debut in a 2–0 win over Aberdeen.

Despite scoring on his debut, Barrowman struggled to live up to his potential and found himself in and out of the Inverness team in his first season.

===Ross County, Dunfermline &amp; Dundee===
On 1 February 2010, Barrowman re-signed for title challengers Ross County on an 18-month deal after securing a release from Inverness. He contributed an assist for the second goal as Ross County eliminated Celtic on their way to the 2010 Scottish Cup Final. Barrowman played the whole game as Ross County lost 3–0 to Dundee United. On 12 October 2010, he returned to first-team duty after two months out with a broken foot to score a late equaliser against Partick Thistle in the semi-final of the Scottish Challenge Cup; Ross County won the penalty shootout to qualify for the final. He then scored the opening goal in the final as Ross County won the trophy beating Queen of the South 2–0.

On 3 June 2011, he left Ross County to join SPL newcomers Dunfermline Athletic on a two-year contract. On 26 March 2013, Dunfermline applied to enter into administration Two days later the club announced that eight players had been made redundant with Barrowman amongst them.

On 31 March 2013, it was announced that Barrowman had signed a deal with Dundee until the end of the season, following his release from Dunfermline.

===Livingston, Morton and return to Dunfermline===
Barrowman signed for Livingston on 23 August 2013, in a deal lasting through to January 2014. He then extended his contract until the end of the season. He was released in May 2014.

After leaving Livingston, Barrowman signed for League One side Greenock Morton. He was released by mutual consent in January 2015. On 13 January 2015, the same day he left Morton, Barrowman signed for former club Dunfermline Athletic on a short term six-month deal. The switch was part of a swap deal which saw Ross Forbes go the other way and head to Morton. He made his second Dunfermline debut at the first opportunity, starting in a 2–2 draw against Airdrieonians on 17 January 2015.

===Albion Rovers===
In July 2015, Barrowman signed for Albion Rovers alongside former Raith Rovers midfielder Mark Ferry. His season with Rovers was hampered by injury, though he did make 25 appearances across all competitions, scoring 4 times for the Scottish League One side. At the end of the 2015–16 season, Barrowman confirmed his retirement from football. Towards the end of his playing career, Barrowman had started a degree course in business management.

===Arthurlie===
In the 2018–2019 season, Barrowman made a return to football with Junior club Arthurlie where he made a handful of appearance before going back into retirement due to injury.

==Post-playing career==

<doc id="1342042" wikidata="Q1856701" url="?curid=1342042" title="St James Park (Exeter)">
<text>St James Park is a football stadium in Exeter and the home of Exeter City FC. The stadium is served by the St James Park railway station, which is right next to the ground (the line runs behind the grandstand). It has been adopted by the club who contribute to its upkeep, under the community rail scheme, and its railings have been painted in the red and white of Exeter&#x27;s strip.

The capacity of St James Park following completion of a £3.4 million redevelopment project is 8,219. The record attendance is 20,984, who watched Exeter lose 4–2 to Sunderland in an FA Cup Sixth Round Replay in 1931.

==Stands==
The Stagecoach Stand and the away terrace were closed for the 2017–18 season to allow redevelopment work at the stadium, with away fans only allocated around 200–300 tickets in the main seated stand during that time. This temporarily reduced the stadium capacity to around 6,000.

In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the televised second leg of the 2019–20 League Two play-off semi-final between Exeter City and Colchester United was played at St James Park without spectators. Paying £25 each, Exeter City supporters provided 1,256 personal photographic portraits to a company called FaceInTheCrowd, and the company manufactured life size polypropylene &quot;cutouts&quot; which were placed in the Stagecoach stand for the match, and then transported to Wembley Stadium after Exeter won through to the play-off final. The supporters&#x27; payment for the cutouts, less production costs, was donated to the club. The supporters who wished to were able to reclaim their cutouts after the play-offs.

The current certified capacity of the stadium is 8,720 but, in order to comply with updated safety guidance, the operational capacity at St James Park is 8,219.

==History==
In 1654 the land was owned by Lady Anne Clifford who rented it out for fattening pigs. The proceeds went to a charity set up to pay for the apprenticeship of a poor child from the parish of St Stephen, an arrangement that was supposed to be renewed &quot;yearly to the world&#x27;s end.&quot; Pigs were resident for nearly 250 years and in later times, were joined by other tenants of low repute. Prior to 1904, Exeter United FC played its games here and after merging with St. Sidwell&#x27;s United, the ground was leased to the newly formed Exeter City FC with the new contract stipulating that &quot;no menageries, shows, circuses or steam roundabouts&quot; were to be allowed on the premises.

In the ground&#x27;s early days, some visiting clubs complained about the ground claiming it wasn&#x27;t regulation length, and both Stoke (in 1909) and Reading (1910) refused to play FA Cup games at the ground, although the matter was resolved in 1920 when the club purchased the land east of the ground and were able to extend the pitch and construct the Big Bank stand.

In 1921 the club was able to buy the site, thanks to money raised through the record breaking sale of Dick Pym to Bolton, and proceeded to develop the ground, adding a roof to the Cowshed stand and in 1926 rebuilding the Grandstand destroyed by fire the previous year.

===Modern development===
In 1994 the club encountered financial difficulties and the ground was sold to Beazer Homes, and was later purchased by Exeter City Council who leased it back to the club. Finances had improved by 1996 and the club began to redevelop St James Park, rebuilding the Big Bank stand (2000) and replacing the Cowshed terrace with an all-seater stand (2001). The neighbouring former St. James&#x27; School building was refurbished into new offices, a social club and corporate hospitality /conference and banqueting facilities.

Financial difficulties, including debt to stadium redevelopers Mowlem, caused the redevelopment plans to be put on hold but matters continued to decline, culminating in the club&#x27;s most traumatic episode at the end of the 2002/03 season, when police raided the club and removed the recently instated chairman, his wife and the vice-chairman for questioning. Later that year the Supporters Trust took over day-to-day running of the club, and to overcome the financial problems entered into a CVA.

In 2005, thanks largely to the money generated from the FA Cup third round match at Old Trafford the previous year, the club came out of administration and the Supporters Trust began again to look at the redevelopment of the ground. In the meantime, much of the small scale maintenance and repair work has been undertaken by a volunteer workforce of fans organised by the Trust, using resources donated by local businesses.

In 2004, talks were held with the Exeter Chiefs rugby club, who were in with a good chance of obtaining promotion to the Zurich Premiership that season. Because the Chiefs 100-year-old County Ground didn&#x27;t meet Premiership requirements and their new Sandy Park Stadium was not due to open for another season, the clubs were looking at a possible one year groundshare at St James Park. There were also talks of a future groundshare at the Sandy Park stadium should Exeter City decide to leave St James Park. In the end, the Chiefs missed promotion by 4 points to Bristol and were able to stay at the County Ground for the next season. Contractual restrictions on the use of Sandy Park halted talk of a future groundshare there too.

In May 2016, permission was granted for a redevelopment of the Old Grandstand (then known as the Stagecoach Family Stand), that would see the 90-year-old stand be demolished and replaced with a new 1,600 seat stand, which would be financed by the building of new student accommodation behind the Big Bank. The option for a new, covered standing away terrace was also included and approved under planning permission. As part of the redevelopment, the club announced in October 2018 that the Old Grandstand&#x27;s replacement would be named &#x27;The Stagecoach Adam Stansfield Stand&#x27;, in honour of the striker who died from cancer in 2010, at the age of 31.

==International matches==
St James Park hosted an international fixture on 22 November 2006, when England Women&#x27;s Under 21s took on France in a friendly match. The game finished 1–1.

The Park also hosted the England C international match against Wales on 20 February 2008, which England won 2–1.

<doc id="1342067" wikidata="Q1487502" url="?curid=1342067" title="GUS (retailer)">
<text>GUS plc was a FTSE 100 retailing, manufacturing and financial conglomerate based in the United Kingdom. GUS was an abbreviation of Great Universal Stores, the company&#x27;s name before 2001, while it was also known as the &quot;Glorious Gussies&quot; amongst stockbrokers. The company started out as Universal Stores, a mail order business created by the Rose family. In 1931, Isaac Wolfson joined the mail order company and would, through a series of takeovers, turn it into a retail, manufacturing and financial conglomerate, becoming Europe&#x27;s biggest mail order firm and with over 2,700 physical stores. His son, Leonard Wolfson, followed him as chairman, to be succeeded by his nephews David Wolfson (1996–2000) and Victor Barnett (2000–2002). During the 1980s, the business divested much of its physical retail and manufacturing subsidiaries under Leonard Wolfson to concentrate on mail order, property and finance. In October 2006, the company was split into two separate companies: Experian which continues to exist, and Home Retail Group which was bought by Sainsbury&#x27;s in 2016.

==History==
Universal Stores was founded in 1900 as a mail-order business in Manchester, England by Abraham, George and Jack Rose. A private company, Universal Stores (Manchester) Ltd, was set up to manage the business and the company was incorporated in 1917. In 1930, the company changed its name to Great Universal Stores Limited. The next year it was listed on the London Stock Exchange. At this stage, it was the leading mail order business in the UK, with a single catalogue, &quot;Great Universal&quot;. A second catalogue, &quot;John England&quot;, was launched later in 1933. The company set up a chain of department stores in a joint venture with American businessman Charley Nicholls called New Universal Stores.

In 1931, Isaac Wolfson was invited to join the company as merchandise controller after impressing director George Rose at a trade fair in Manchester, accepting no wages in return of share options. The flotation of the company was not a huge success, and with an ill-advised move to London the share price dropped. Wolfson, using money borrowed from his father in law, purchased a large amount of shares and became the joint managing director a year later with George Rose, who subsequently resigned in 1934 leaving Wolfson in sole charge. In 1933 the company had made a loss of £55,000, but Wolfson&#x27;s reorganisation turned this around to a profit of £330,000 in 1934. He was chairman from the late 1940s until his retirement in 1987. Wolfson grew GUS by offering &#x27;A&#x27; ordinary shares, which had no voting rights, or by selling the premises and leasing it back. Through his wealth gained at Great Universal Stores, he established the Wolfson Foundation in 1955. By 1983 the company had expanded its range of operations significantly. Catalogue mail order was by far the company&#x27;s primary business but the company was also engaged in retailing through shops, the manufacture of clothing and household goods, financial services, property investment and travel. Until 1997, GUS had 48 years of consecutive profit growth.

===UK mail order catalogues growth===

Great Universal acquired Kay &amp; Company Ltd in 1937, and continued to run its catalogue, &quot;Kays&quot;, as a separate title. Based in Worcester, Kay &amp; Company began life in the 1880s and was an established mail order company at the time of the GUS takeover. Two further mail order firms were purchased in 1938, Trafford Warehouse and Samuel Driver.

After World War II, the expansion of the mail order business restarted with the purchase of Morses in 1947. This was followed by the purchase of the famous mail order business of Pryce Pryce-Jones, The Royal Welsh Warehouse, which was acquired in 1954. The company further expanded the mail order business during the 1960s by buying rivals Bollin House (1961), Dyson and Horsfall (1962) and Chorlton Warehouse (1963).

GUS acquired A &amp; S Henry &amp; Co group in 1971 after a battle with fellow retailing group United Drapery Stores. This group was primarily a group of paper pulp and carpet manufacturing businesses and a mail order unit trading as John Noble. This was followed in 1976 by the acquisition of the retail business of S &amp; U Stores Ltd, a 120 chain store holding company which operated catalogues, &quot;Greenbank&quot; and &quot;Meridien&quot;; In 1977 the business of Henry Wigfall &amp; Son Ltd catalogue business of &quot;All Yours&quot;, &quot;Wigfalls at Home&quot; and &quot;Choice Mail Order&quot; were purchased, and in 1981 GUS acquired the &quot;John Myers Home Shopping&quot; catalogue business from UDS Group plc. All of these mail order businesses became part of the GUS subsidiary, the British Mail Order Corporation Ltd (BMOC) and were run separately from Kay &amp; Company Ltd. However, in 1983 the Monopolies &amp; Mergers Commission vetoed a merger of GUS with rival Empire which GUS had already purchased 36% of the shares in. Two thirds of the shares in Empire was sold to a Dutch company, Vendex, with GUS retaining a 12% holding. UK operations were grown in 1997 with the purchase of most of Arcadia Group&#x27;s catalogue business, which included the catalogues Innovations and McCord.

===European mail order catalogues growth===
From the 1960s, GUS grew its presence on continental Europe. This started with the purchase of the Wehkamp mail order business based in Holland. This was increased by Swedish catalogue Hallens I. Barrasford which was purchased in 1966 and the Austrian mail order firm Universal Versand in 1968. The last purchase was Verdia in Switzerland, which was purchased in 1982 The Wehkamp catalogue was expanded by its parent company, GUS Holland BV, by purchasing smaller Dutch rival Bertels in 1970, moving into the Belgium and Germany markets and offering separate catalogues selling everything from flower bulbs to furniture and holding a third of the mail order market in Holland. GUS expanded Halens catalogue into the Finnish market in 1997.

===Furniture business growth===

In 1934, Great Universal started to grow its furniture business by purchasing the Midland and Hackney chains. This was followed in 1943 by the purchase of the Jays and Campbell chains for £1.2 million from its owner Sir Julien Cahn, and British and Colonial Furniture Company in 1945, along with its Cavendish, Woodhouse and Dale chains for £1 million and the manufacturing business of Tyne Plywood Works. Smart Brothers furniture chain was added in 1948 for a further £1 million. In 1946, a Working Party report stated its concerns about GUS purchases: 
They continued to buy furniture stores, with Oetzmann &amp; Co. purchased in 1954, Godfrey and James Broderick stores added. The biggest name purchased was Waring &amp; Gillows in 1953, however a large share of the business was sold to rival furniture chain &quot;John Peters&quot;, run by Manny Cussins for cash and shares in 1960. During 1955, GUS furniture factories were hit by the UK government&#x27;s restrictions to hire purchase, with Tyne Furniture Works, one of Europe&#x27;s biggest furniture factory&#x27;s, having to go on short time due to the fall in orders. In 1957, GUS funded research by the Furniture Development Council into blooming caused by lacquers used on furniture products. In 1968, GUS purchased the combined furniture and menswear group Times-Willerby, adding The Times Furnishing Company to its furniture retail portfolio, while also purchasing the Welsh-based furniture retailer S. Aston &amp; Sons in 1968. During the same year GUS was taken to Court by Cheltenham department store Cavendish House about using the Cavendish name on the former Dale furniture store. In 1985, GUS combined The Times Furnishing Group, and its remaining furniture businesses that had been consolidated under Cavendish-Woodhouse, and branded them under the Times name. The 375 store business was sold to Harris Queensway in 1986, for an exchange of a 20% shareholding in Harris Queensway.

===Department stores and Draperies===
In 1937, Charley Nicholls, the part owner of New Universal Stores sold his shares to Zellers, the Canadian retailer, who took over management of the chain and renamed it Hills &amp; Steele. The business was making a loss and GUS took over management of the business in 1939, but sold it to British Home Stores in 1944. GUS however did not pull out of this market, and went on a purchasing spree. The first bought was Cardiff based store, Leslie Stores and its subsidiaries, John Dyer in Southsea,
London House in Newport was purchased in 1940. World War II briefly slowed the growth, but after the war Bainbridges of Lincoln, Lincolnshire &amp; Wisbech was purchased in 1949, quickly followed by J Robb &amp; Co of Belfast in 1951. GUS subsidiary, Kays purchased the Kidderminster store Attwoods, while in 1954 Bladons of Hull and Jones &amp; Higgins Peckham were acquired. The company added Pim Brothers (Dublin) and Darling &amp; Co. Edinburgh in 1955, Ben Evans in Swansea in 1955, Houndsditch Warehouse, Houndsditch, London in 1958 and
Beavans in Byker in 1964. Other department stores acquired during this time included Butterfield and Massies of Barnsley, Webbers of Maidenhead, Wickhams and Pyne Brothers both of London. GUS also purchased during this period smaller Drapery Stores, many of which offered credit to their customers. These included W. Brydson &amp; Co of Perth, Evans and Allen of Newport, Garrett &amp; Co of Woolwich, Rees Howell in Glamorgan, R. W. Pritchard in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, the Taylor-Nottidge Group which included the subsidiaries:
F. Taylor &amp; Sons (Lambeth), J. T. Nottidge (Islington), Gergels (Gravesend), Beck Jones (Lewisham), John Williams &amp; Co (Rotherhithe), Heywoods (Manor Park). The biggest purchase was Penberthys of Oxford Street in 1955.

However the age of the department store and drapery was starting to falter, and GUS sold, closed down or repurposed the stores. Darling &amp; Co. was sold to House of Fraser in January 1961. J Robb &amp; Co was closed in 1973, as was Pim Brothers in 1967, both being rented out by GUS Property before being redeveloped. Jones &amp; Higgins was closed as a department store in 1980, becoming a branch of Houndsditch Warehouse before it eventually closed in 1984, with Houndsditch itself closing in 1986 and being redeveloped by GUS Property as 133 Houndsditch, an office development. Garrett &amp; Co in Woolwich was closed 1972 and replaced by a Times Furnishing store, while the likes of Bainbridges and Butterfield and Massies were converted into Thoms discount stores.

===Early Do it yourself stores===
In 1958, GUS purchased Art Wallpapers, a chain of paint and wall covering stores. The business was grown by adding more stores, as well as purchasing further DIY retailers Great Clowes Discount Warehouse, and Home Charm. By the 1980s the business had 175 stores, but was sold to Harris Queensway in exchange for shares as part of the same deal that Harris had acquired Times Furniture.

===Grocery retail business===
In 1962, the business moved into the grocery business by buying William Cussons, a northern based chain, which operated a further 40 Carline Supermarkets and the high end grocery chain Hodgson &amp; Hepworth in Doncaster. These businesses were sold to Associated British Foods grocery business Fine Fare in November 1968.

===Clothing retail===
After the Second World War, Wolfson expanded GUS into the world of clothing retailing. It purchased the retail chains, Jays of Regent Street in 1946; ladys outfitters Wilsons in 1947
followed by Jax in 1949. During 1954, men&#x27;s tailoring chain John Temple was purchased along with Rego Clothiers. Two high end retailers, Burberry and The Scotch House were added to the company&#x27;s portfolio in 1955 along with national chain Weaver to Wearer. Two years later GUS purchased the multiple retailer Morrisons Associated Companies, which included its subsidiaries, Ashley Russell; Audrey; Cliftons; Edgar Allen; Graftons; Irene Adair and Paige. It also added in 1957 the men&#x27;s tailoring stores of Neville Reed. The following year saw GUS expand its clothing empire by buying the men&#x27;s tailoring chains of Hector Powe and Hope Brothers (which included subsidiary 
John Maxwell) and ladies outfitters J.Marksmith &amp; Co. with its subsidiary Vogue Fashions. Headrow Clothiers, a manufacturing and clothing retail business was purchased in 1962, with the manufacturing business being sold onto Manny Cussins company, John Peters, but with GUS retaining the 88 Hipp/Tailorfit stores. As part of the purchase of Times Willerby, a furniture and men&#x27;s tailoring business in 1968, the Willerby tailor stores were added to the GUS portfolio. The company expanded into European markets in 1972 by purchasing the French men&#x27;s retailer 100,000 Chemises. During the 1970s, the clothing operations management were consolidated under Morrisons Associated Companies, with the company rebranding it&#x27;s men stores under the Just Pants Plus brand, while the womenswear brands were reduced to Paige, Wilsons and Jax. In 1986, the 246 Paige stores were sold to retail group Combined English Stores.

===Footwear Retailers===
In addition to clothing retailers, Isaac Wolfson expanded GUS retail portfolio into the world of Footwear. The first purchase was in 1956 when they acquired the Flateau Group, which included the subsidiaries Henry Playfair, Metropole Shoes and the Metropolitan Boot Co. This soon added to by the purchase of manufacturer and retailer Greenlees &amp; Sons in 1957, whose subsidiaries included Easiphit; Dicks; J.W. Haylock; Peter of Durham; K. Stanton &amp; Sons and Sandra. In 1973, the business was grown further by the purchase of Lennards. The businesses were merged into a new company called Greenlees Lennards Ltd. The combined company was sold to Charterhall during 1988.

===Electrical retailers===
Great Universal Stores expanded into the High Street electrical retail market in 1948 by buying Boyds, a radio and television retailerand rental company. This area of the business was further expanded by 1955 with the purchase of W H Barnes, but it was not until 1971 that further expansion occurred with the purchase of J &amp; F Stone Lighting and Radio Ltd. The 100 stores of the J &amp; F Stone brand were sold in 1975 to Thorn Electrical Industries who combined them into their existing Rumbelows chain, while Boyds was sold to the Electronics Rental Group in 1974.

===Other retail and manufacturing growth===

GUS developed its manufacturing businesses in the 1950s, with products including clothing, bedding, upholstery, textiles and pottery.

A joint venture started in 1984 between commercial delivery firm Lex Wilkinson and GUS Transport, better known as White Arrow. During the 1980s, Leonard Wolfson divested much of the companies retail and manufacturing business, to concentrate on mail order, Burberry, finance and property sectors. While divesting the retail businesses, GUS kept hold of the freeholds of the properties and added them to their property business GUS Property Management, leasing the properties back to the purchasing businesses.

In 1995, Marks and Spencers and GUS discussed a merger but it was eventually blocked by the M &amp; S board. In 1997, Great Universal Stores appointed Rose Marie Bravo as the new CEO of Burberry given the task of improving the company, which had been hit by the Asian crisis. The company acquired Argos in 1998 in a hostile takeover bid and the UK&#x27;s second largest online retailer at the time, Jungle.com, in 2000 for £37 million.

==== Argos Retail Group (2000–2006) ====
In 2001 the company changed its name to GUS plc using the identifier GUS on the London Stock Exchange. In November 2002, Homebase was acquired by GUS plc for £900 million, where it formed part of the Argos Retail Group. The previous month, GUS had announced that the Jungle.com business was also to be merged into the ARG division of the business and run from Argos&#x27; Milton Keynes headquarters. From early in the year the Home Shopping division also embarked on a successful turnaround strategy helped by advisers managed by Rob Wherrett of Zymolysis.

===Canadian operations===
With the purchase of British &amp; Colonial Furniture in 1945, GUS gained ownership of their first Canadian business, Woodhouse &amp; Co. Great Universal Stores of Canada Limited was expanded with the further purchases of Legare Co., C. W. Lindsay, Forsts and Adams Furniture Co. In 1953, Isaac Wolfson investigated a merger of his Canadian operations with Canadian department store Robert Simpson but withdrew from the deal at the last minute. By 1964, GUS operated 125 furniture and appliance stores across Canada. Charles Wolfson, Isaac&#x27;s brother was formerly president, became chairman as of 1 January 1963, and John P. Adderley became president and chief executive officer.

The businesses included: 
* Woodhouse &amp; Co (purchased 1945)
* Legare Co.
* Adams Furniture Co.
* C. W. Lindsay and Co.
* Forst&#x27;s Ltd. (purchased 1955)

In the early 1990s the Canadian company was fined $45,000 (Canadian) for misleading advertising, the largest total fine during that fiscal year. At that point, the company was doing business under the name of Légaré Woodhouse in Montreal and elsewhere in Quebec. The business was sold at a loss of £1.7 million in 1998, as GUS pulled out of the Canadian retail market.

===South African operations===
In 1947, Isaac Wolfson visited South Africa on a fact finding mission for investments and purchased shares in the newly public issued furniture retailer Lewis Stores, which operated 8 stores Lewis Stores share holding was grown to take ownership of the business, and further investments were made in manufacturing businesses Workwear, Sweet-our, Lydbrook and Durban Bag Company. By 1956, Lewis Stores had grown to a 45 store chain including the brands Lewis Stores, Baron Furnishings, Excelsior Meubels and a credit clothing store called Universal Stores. By 1964 the retail business had grown to 120 stores. In 1972, Universal Stores were sold to South African rival Edgars, while 50 furniture stores were purchased from Edgar&#x27;s and renamed Dan Hands, and the business opened stores in Botswana, Namibia and Swaziland. During the 1990s the furniture stores were rebranded under the Lewis brand, and the electrical retailer Best Electricals was started up. The retail business by 2003 had a total of 395 stores under the Lewis and Best Electrical brands.

GUS were put under pressure during the apartheid years regarding their investments, including pressure from Wolfson College, Oxford, which had been set up by a grant from the Wolfson Foundation.

In 2003 it was announced the South African business would be partially floated on the Johannesburg market as part of the divestment of non core business. The remaining shares of the business were sold in 2005.

===America plans===
In 1949, GUS applied to the UK government asking to extend their dollar facilities to £750,000 to invest in the US to increase the sale of British goods. In 1954, GUS made an approach to purchase the US mail order and department store group Montgomery Ward with a plan to invest $100 million in the business, however the bid was rejected by Montgomery Ward&#x27;s board. In December 1964, Isaac Wolfson announced they planned to expand into both the retail and manufacturing trades in the US, however no purchases were made. GUS did set up Great Universal Stores Development Company Inc. in 1964 to work with two American partners on property development, and in 1968 set up a new subsidiary, BRAMBEC, as a commercial furniture contractor for its manufacturing businesses, working in partnership with Holiday Inn.

===Travel &amp; holiday business===

In 1956, GUS purchased Global Tours, Europe&#x27;s biggest coach tour company that had been formed by Harry Rosenthal, Joe and Harry Shuman adding Overland Tours later that year. GUS added a further business to its Global subsidiary, Sunlight Holidays in 1962. By 1969, the Global business had grown and was delivering 150,000 Tours annually, in the areas of air, coach rail and cruise tours. Great Universal was a large shareholder in British Caledonian Airways, and Global formed a strong partnership with a time charter arrangement. By 1977, Global was offering low priced tours leaving from 10 different airports in the British Isles. The company however suffered from a blacklisting from Arab countries due to the company chairman being Lord Mancroft, and the companies links to Israel. In 1985, as part of Leonard Wolfsons divesting plans, Global, along with its brands Overland and Golden Circle were sold to rival tour company Intasun.

===GUS Property===

GUS Property divisions started out as an investment company developing modern office blocks, including Dale Street in Manchester, Chatworth House, and in partnership with Gerald Ronson. The company also invested in retail developments, including the 1985 development of St Nicholas Centre while redeveloping the former Robb department store in Belfast into the Donegall Arcade. In the 1980s, GUS started selling off its physical retail businesses, but retained the freehold and leaseholds, changing the company to GUS Property Management. The company continued to invest in property by purchasing &quot;The Forge&quot; shopping centre in Glasgow from Arlington Retail for £35 million in 1993 and the &quot;Connswater Shopping Centre&quot; in Belfast for £23.25m in 1996. In 1997, GUS set up a joint company with British Land to manage the £900 million property portfolio held by GUS Property Management. Called BL Universal, British Land paid £230 million for its half share of the joint company. The new business sold or relinquished 894 properties, either reinvesting in new property, such as retail parks, or returning cash to the share holders. In 2003, British Land purchased the remaining 50% shareholding from GUS for £120 million, and paid off a £43 million loan that GUS had provided to BL Universal.

===Finance business===
GUS purchased Whiteaway, Laidlaw &amp; Co, a British owned department store chain located in the far East in 1957. The business included several finance arms including General Guarantee Corp Ltd, a company dealing in equipment leasing and hire purchase financing. In 1964, Great Universal started selling motor insurance via their catalogues. In 1997 General Guarantee purchased the vehicle leasing company Highway Vehicle Management.

The finance business was sold as part of the company refocus under David Wolfson and Victor Barnett. Highway Vehicle Management was sold to First National, a division of Abbey National for around £170 million in 2000, with K.C Finance, its Channel Island subsidiary of General Guarantee Finance sold for £54 million. The remaining part of General Guarantee Finance was closed down in 2000 with the loss of 600 jobs after failing to find a buyer. The Whiteaway Laidlaw Bank was then transferred to the Home Retail Group, and was sold in 2007 to the Manchester Building Society.

===Credit agency and direct marketing business===
In the 1970s, the Midland Household stores division of GUS developed a credit referencing system to help against bad debt on credit provided in its furniture stores. It was such a success that it was offered to other parts of the GUS group, and it grew and developed into direct marketing, credit management and store cards. In 1980, GUS sought assistance from IBM, who recommended that they sold its products to others, thus the department became a separate organisation called Commercial Credit (Nottingham) (CCN), which sold its products to organisations outside of the GUS group. During 1984 GUS purchased Manchester Guardian Society for the Protection of Trade. In 1986, CCN bought US business MDS (Management Decision Systems), a specialist company developing credit scoring models.

In November 1996, TRW sold their credit agency unit TRW Information Systems and Services Inc, that operated under the name Experian to Bain Capital and Thomas H. Lee Partners. Just one month later, the two firms sold Experian to Great Universal Stores. GUS merged the business with CCN and renamed the business Experian. In 1997, GUS purchased US direct marketing company Direct Marketing Technology for $246 million.

===2000s divestment and demerger===
The company started divesting its business by selling its Universal Versand business in April 2001 to the Otto group for £23 million. Its luxury brand The Scotch House was put up for sale, but no buyer could be found and so the business was closed down in 2001 and its Knightsbridge store transferred to Burberry. The company expanded into new markets by buying the Reality Group, a Web design, hosting and e-commerce consultancy business it had acquired for £35 million and merging it with its GUS Transport business, known as White Arrow, naming the combined business Reality. Later on in 2001, Breathe.com, at the time Britain&#x27;s 4th largest internet service provider was purchased from near bankruptcy, but was sold just three months later at a profit to Affinity Internet Holdings.

In 2004, the company sold its traditional home shopping (catalogues) division in the UK and Scandinavia and its Reality business, which included the White Arrow business to the Barclay twins for £590 million, who later merged the Littlewoods mail order operations into it. This included the iconic &quot;Great Universal Stores&quot; catalogue, from which the company took its name, and completed the departure of GUS from its original business areas. Around the same time, the Barclays announced the closure of the Littlewoods Index catalogue showroom chain, the principal rival to Argos in the UK, selling around 35 stores to Argos.

Following a reorganization led by Barnett, it was announced in May 2005 that GUS would divest its stake in Burberry by distributing Burberry shares to its own shareholders. In October the Wehkamp business was sold to Swedish investment company Industri Kapital for 390 million euros, selling the last remnant of the companies mail order business. The Burberry demerger was completed in December 2005. GUS plc ranked as the highest-spending online advertiser in the US, according to Nielsen NetRatings, spending over $US659m in 2006. The next-ranked online advertiser, Vonage, had sales of just over $US294m.

On 28 March 2006, it was announced that the company would split into two separate businesses, Home Retail Group and Experian, with both companies listed separately on the London Stock Exchange as of 11 October 2006. GUS plc became a wholly owned subsidiary of Experian plc after the demerger and was renamed Experian Finance plc.

<text>Carl Motteram (born 3 September 1984) is an English professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for South Molton F.C. in the North Devon Premier League.

Moterram was born in Birmingham and joined Birmingham City as a 12-year-old. He progressed through the youth and trainee sides and turned professional in August 2003. He made the substitutes&#x27; bench for the trip to Tottenham Hotspur on 7 January 2004, but that was the closest he got to playing for Birmingham&#x27;s first team.

He joined Conference club Tamworth on loan in November 2005 where he played for them against Hartlepool United on their FA Cup run. He then moved on to Torquay United on a free transfer in July 2006.

He made his Torquay debut in the League Cup defeat at home to Norwich City on 23 August 2006, coming on as a late substitute for Chris McPhee. He struggled to establish himself at Torquay, finding himself even further away from the starting line-up once Ian Atkins, who had signed him, was replaced by new manager Lubos Kubik. In December 2006 he was given a one-month extension to his contract, but on 22 January 2007 it was announced that he would be released at the end of the month.

He signed for Moor Green of the Conference North in February 2007. Moor Green merged with Solihull Borough in the summer of 2007 and Motteram was retained by the newly formed Solihull Moors.

<text>King Edward Point (also known as KEP) is a permanent British Antarctic Survey research station on South Georgia island and is the capital of the British Overseas Territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. It is situated in Cumberland East Bay on the northeastern coast of the island. The settlement is the second smallest capital in the world by population, after Ngerulmud in Palau.

==History==
The area was explored by the Swedish Antarctic Expedition of 1901–04 under Otto Nordenskiöld. It was named around 1906 after King Edward VII of the United Kingdom. Since 1909, King Edward Point has been the residence of a British Magistrate administering the island. In 1925, the government of the United Kingdom established Discovery House, a marine laboratory for Discovery Investigations.

==Research station==
On 1 January 1950, the station ownership was assumed by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey. The station was manned from 1 January 1952 to 13 November 1969. The British Antarctic Survey provided the British presence at the station until 1982.

At the beginning of the Falklands War on 3 April 1982, Argentine forces occupied South Georgia and closed the station. They were soon expelled during Operation Paraquet later the same month and British military forces retook the point. A series of civilian Marine Officers was appointed to carry out customs and fisheries duties for the South Georgia Government from 1991, and were billeted with the small garrison.

On 22 March 2001, the British Antarctic Survey reopened the station on behalf of the Government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (GSGSSI). Most of the old, dilapidated (and arguably historic) buildings were destroyed to make way for new ones, with the exception of Discovery House (1925) and the Gaol (1912).

Currently twelve BAS personnel overwinter at the station, rising to around 22 in summer. Two Government Officers plus partners are stationed on KEP, overlapping by about three months during the busy winter fishing season. Summer staff from the Museum at Grytviken are also accommodated at KEP.

The continued occupation of the station serves a political purpose as well: it helps to maintain British sovereignty against Argentina&#x27;s claim for ownership of the territory.

The chief activities of the station are applied fisheries research on behalf of the Government of South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands, to assist its policies for sustainable management of the commercial fishery, and to provide logistic support for the Government Officer(s).

==Climate==
King Edward Point and Grytviken have a tundra climate (Köppen &quot;ET)&quot; with long, cold winters and short, cool summers. The highest temperature ever recorded at Grytviken/King Edward Point was on 10 March 1922.

<text>Kevin Miles Murphy (born 1958) is the George J. Stigler Distinguished Service Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution.

== Life and career ==
Murphy has a B.A. (economics, Phi Beta Kappa), from the University of California, Los Angeles, 1981; and PhD, University of Chicago, 1986 (thesis: &quot;Specialization and Human Capital&quot;).

In 1997 Murphy was awarded the prestigious John Bates Clark Medal by the American Economic Association, given once every two years to the most outstanding American economist under the age of forty, and widely considered to be the second most prestigious prize in economics (after the Nobel Prize in Economics). Murphy was cited for his study of the causes of growing income inequality between white-collar and blue-collar workers in the United States and his research linking the growth in income inequality to growth in the demand for skilled labor. His other research has covered such topics as economic growth, income inequality, valuing medical research, rational addiction, and unemployment.

Murphy has authored over 50 published articles on a variety of topics including a cost–benefit analysis of the war in Iraq.

On September 20, 2005, he was named as one of the 2005 recipients of the MacArthur Fellowship, often referred to as the &quot;genius grant.&quot;

On November 13, 2023, Murphy, while serving as an expert witness for Google during a trial, disclosed that Apple gets 36% of the revenue Google generates from being the default browser on the Safari browser.

<text>William Guybon Atherstone (; 1814–1898) was a medical practitioner, naturalist and geologist, one of the pioneers of South African geology and a member of the Cape Parliament.

==Life==
He arrived in South Africa with his parents as 1820 Settlers. His father, Dr John Atherstone, was appointed District Surgeon of Uitenhage in 1822. William, a young man of wide interests and outstanding ability, received his first training at Dr James Rose Innes&#x27;s academy in Uitenhage, being at first apprenticed to his father and then serving as Assistant-Surgeon in the Sixth Frontier War 1834–1835. In 1836 he studied medicine in Dublin and was admitted as M.R.C.S. the following year, obtaining an MD in Heidelberg, Germany in 1839, returning to Grahamstown in the same year and joining his father in practice. He carried out research in lung-sickness, horse-sickness and tick-borne fever and was in 1847 the first surgeon outside Europe and America to perform an amputation using an anaesthetic. This operation, on 16 June 1847, was performed on the Albany Deputy Sheriff, Mr F Carlisle, and was completely successful. On recovering from the anaesthetic, the patient said &quot;What? My leg is off? Impossible - I can&#x27;t believe it!...It&#x27;s the greatest discovery ever made&quot;. In 1839 his interest was aroused in geology, and from that date he devoted the leisure resulting from a long and successful medical career to the pursuit of geological science.

In 1857 he published an account of the rocks and fossils of Uitenhage. He also studied many fossil reptilia from the Karroo beds, and sent specimens to the British Museum. These were described by Sir Richard Owen.

Atherstone&#x27;s identification, in 1867, with the help of Peter MacOwan and HG Galpin, of a crystal found at De Kalk near Hopetown, as the Eureka Diamond - the first found in Africa - led indirectly to the establishment of the diamond industry of South Africa. He encouraged the workings at Jagersfontein, and he also called attention to the diamandiferous pipe at Kimberley. He was partly responsible for the foundation of the Grahamstown library, botanical garden and, in 1855, the Albany Museum.

He traveled widely in the eastern Cape, Namaqualand and the Transvaal, collecting minerals, fossils, plant specimens and seeds, sending material to Hooker at Kew. He was a friend of Andrew Geddes Bain of pass-building fame. He was made F.R.C.S. in 1863 and F.G.S in 1864. He represented Grahamstown as Member of Parliament from 1881 to 1883 whence he was elected to the Legislative Council where he served until 1891.

He is commemorated in the genus &quot;Atherstonea&quot; Pappe and in the names of various fossil reptiles. He was one of the founders of the Geological Society of South Africa at Johannesburg in 1895. He died at Grahamstown, on 26 June 1898.

<text>The Eternal Word Television Network (EWTN) is an American basic cable television network which presents around-the-clock Catholic programming. It is the largest Catholic television network in America, and is purported to be &quot;the world&#x27;s largest religious media network&quot;, (and according to the network itself) reaching 425 million people in 160 countries, with 11 networks. 

The network was originally founded by Mother Angelica , in 1980 and began broadcasting on 15 August 1981 from a garage studio at the Our Lady of the Angels Monastery in Irondale, Alabama, which Mother Angelica founded in 1962. She hosted her own show, &quot;Mother Angelica Live&quot;, until health issues led to her retirement in September 2001. As of 2017, Michael P. Warsaw, who is a consultant to the Vatican&#x27;s Dicastery for Communications, leads EWTN.

In addition to its television network, EWTN owns the &quot;National Catholic Register&quot; newspaper, which it acquired in January 2011, and Catholic News Agency. The network maintains an online presence through its primary site, EWTN.com, and it has a dedicated commercial site, EWTNReligiousCatalogue.com. EWTN also has a 24-hour radio network, offering Catholic talk and worship programming to about 350 radio stations around the U.S. as well as SiriusXM Satellite Radio and shortwave radio. Some of the schedule is the audio from EWTN television shows and some is original programming for radio listeners.

Regular network programs include a daily Catholic Mass and sometimes in the Tridentine Mass format, the traditionalist Stations of the Cross, a taped daily recitation of the Rosary, and daily and weekly news, discussion, and Catechetical programs for both adults and children. Christmas and Easter programming; the installation Masses of bishops and cardinals; coverage of World Youth Days; and Papal visits, deaths, funerals, conclaves, and elections are also presented. Spanish language broadcasts are available on all platforms. On December 8, 2009, EWTN began broadcasting high-definition television.

The network is overseen by trustees rather than shareholders or owners. All of the network&#x27;s funding comes from viewer donations, protecting it from advertising secular or non-Catholic programming.

== Development ==
Mother Angelica made her profession of vows in 1953. In 1962 she established Our Lady of the Angels monastery. During the 1970s, she was an in-demand lecturer and produced pamphlets and audio and video tapes. She had been a guest on local station WBMG (currently WIAT, Channel 42), and on shows on the Christian Broadcasting Network and the Trinity Broadcasting Network. After she gave an interview on then-Christian station WCFC (Channel 38) in Chicago, she decided she wanted her own network. &quot;I walked in, and it was just a little studio, and I remember standing in the doorway and thinking, &#x27;It doesn&#x27;t take much to reach the masses&#x27;. I just stood there and said to the Lord, &#x27;Lord, I&#x27;ve got to have one of these&#x27;&quot;.

Mother Angelica purchased satellite space and EWTN began broadcasting on August 15, 1981, with four hours of daily programming, which included her own show, &quot;Mother Angelica Live&quot; (aired bi-weekly), a Sunday Mass, and reruns of older Catholic programs such as Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen&#x27;s &quot;Life Is Worth Living&quot;. The remainder of the time was filled with shows produced by dioceses across the country, shows from Protestant sources which Mother Angelica determined were in concert with Catholic teachings, and children&#x27;s shows such as &quot;Joy Junction&quot; and &quot;The Sunshine Factory&quot;. About one-third of programming time consisted of secular content, such as re-runs of &quot;The Bill Cosby Show&quot;, public domain films, and cooking and western-themed shows. EWTN eventually increased its broadcast schedule to six hours per day and then to eight hours per day by 1986. Secular content was gradually reduced from 1986 to 1988, and satellite distribution was expanded late in 1987, after which EWTN acquired a far more desirable satellite channel and began broadcasting around the clock. At this point, EWTN began broadcasting the praying of the rosary on a daily basis and added a number of educational shows. In-house production of original programming gradually increased. The Mass became televised daily in 1991 from a chapel on the monastery grounds. Most shows from non-Catholic sources were eliminated and a more theological image gradually developed.

From 1982 to 1994, the network had competition from another Catholic broadcaster, the Catholic Telecommunications Network of America. The network was sponsored by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops which poured $30 million into the venture before it failed.

In 2000, &quot;in the midst of an apostolic visitation by San Juan Archbishop Roberto González Nieves&quot; to investigate Mother Angelica&#x27;s authority over the station and monastery, Mother Angelica gave control of EWTN to a board of lay people.

As of 2011, the network&#x27;s chairman of the board and chief executive officer is Michael P. Warsaw.

As of 2019, EWTN programming was available through &quot;more than 6,000 TV affiliates as well as on Roku, Apple TV, Amazon Fire and YouTube&quot;. In addition to its Irondale campus, the network maintains a Washington, D.C., facility for its news division, along with a West Coast broadcast facility on the campus of the Christ Cathedral in Garden Grove, California.

==Other media==
=== Radio ===

In 1992, EWTN established the largest privately owned shortwave radio station, WEWN. The station broadcasts from Vandiver, Alabama, in the vicinity of greater Birmingham.

In 1996, Mother Angelica announced that EWTN would make its radio signal available via satellite to AM and FM stations throughout the United States at no cost.

In 1999, programs included &quot;Mother Angelica Live&quot; and &quot;Life Is Worth Living&quot; with Fulton J. Sheen. WGSN in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, was an affiliate. Current radio programs include &quot;Open Line&quot; in which callers can have their questions regarding the Catholic Faith answered.

In 2004, EWTN announced an agreement with Sirius Satellite Radio, which thereafter merged with XM Satellite Radio to become Sirius XM Satellite Radio. EWTN broadcasts on Channel 130 on Sirius XM.

As of August 2020, EWTN Radio is affiliated with 384 stations in the United States and more than 500 stations globally.

=== Newspapers ===

In January 2011, EWTN acquired the &quot;National Catholic Register&quot;, a newspaper founded in Denver, Colorado, in 1924 as a periodical for local Catholics, and which became a national publication three years later. EWTN officially assumed total control on February 1, 2011. EWTN also owns Catholic News Agency which is a Catholic news service with bureaus across America, Latin America and Europe.

=== News coverage ===
The EWTN news department produces a daily news service for television and radio, featuring news sources including Vatican Radio. A reflection of its size and influence is that it has 30 staff members covering the Vatican alone, &quot;far outnumbering other English-language media outlets&quot;. Tracy Sabol is currently the lead anchor of the network&#x27;s nightly news program, &quot;EWTN News Nightly&quot;, succeeding Lauren Ashburn, who in turn succeeded founding anchor Colleen Carroll Campbell.

It also produces &quot;The World Over Live&quot;, which reports current events. Journalist and author Raymond Arroyo, who is EWTN&#x27;s news director, hosts the program. The program is conservative in its political orientation and generally conservative in its religious orientation. Notable guests have included Robert Rector of The Heritage Foundation, author and activist George Weigel, political commentator Laura Ingraham, conservative political commentator Pat Buchanan, and the late columnist and commentator Robert Novak, a Jewish convert to the Catholic Faith.

==Finance==
While the network has trustees, it does not have shareholders or owners. A majority of the network&#x27;s funding is from viewer donations about which it advertises &quot;100% viewer supported&quot;, which keeps it from advertising secular or non-Catholic programming. Its traditional plea for donations is &quot;Keep us between your gas and electric bill&quot;.
Mother Angelica developed the fund raising slogan for viewers, &quot;Please keep us between your gas and electric bill!&quot;

== History of programming ==

EWTN was founded by Mother Angelica, PCPA, in 1980 and began broadcasting on August 15, 1981, from a garage studio at the Our Lady of the Angels Monastery in Irondale, Alabama, which Mother Angelica founded in 1962.

Mother Angelica hosted her own show, &quot;Mother Angelica Live&quot;, until suffering a major stroke and other health issues in September 2001. Repeats now air as either the &quot;Best of Mother Angelica Live&quot; or &quot;Mother Angelica Live Classics&quot;. From then until her death on Easter Sunday of 2016, she led a cloistered life at the Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament in Hanceville, Alabama.

In its early history, EWTN broadcast Catholic programming from a great variety of Catholic sources, which ranged from Catholic charismatic programming, such as that of Fr. Michael Manning, to programs focusing on social reform and social justice, such as &quot;Christopher Closeup&quot;, to doctrinal programs hosted by clergy. The network began broadcasting daily rosary broadcasts in 1987 and daily Mass in 1991.

In the early 1990s, EWTN began producing more of its own programs. This effort marked a conspicuously conservative shift in its overall orientation, with programs on topics of social reform and justice gradually eliminated and replaced by programs on doctrine and programs of dialogue. The shift was apparent in the daily televised Masses, which, in 1992, began incorporating Latin into the liturgy and gradually eliminated contemporary music. Some untelevised Masses are totally in English and some include more contemporary music. On Christmas Eve of 1993, Mother Angelica and the nuns of her order reverted to traditional habits. From 1992 on, the Latin portions of the Mass included the Gloria, introduction of the Gospel readings, the Sanctus, and the remainder of the Mass after the Great Amen, beginning with the Lord&#x27;s Prayer.

Among its notable weekly programs are &quot;The Journey Home&quot; and &quot;Life on the Rock&quot;. &quot;The Journey Home&quot;, hosted by Marcus Grodi, presents converts to the Catholic Faith. Grodi is a former Presbyterian minister who converted to the Catholic Faith in 1992. Although most guests are former Protestants, former members of non-Christian faiths (such as Judaism) and former atheists occasionally appear. &quot;Life on the Rock&quot; is hosted by Rev. Mark Mary, MFVA.

The HD feed first became available to Comcast customers in Richmond, Virginia, and its vicinity on May 11, 2010.

In October 2011, EWTN became available through the Roku streaming player. The player provides six live channels of EWTN at no cost, including English, Spanish, and German languages, thus permitting users to view the channel on their televisions. In addition, select EWTN programs can be viewed through the video on demand option, and a live feed of EWTN Radio is available.

Often, EWTN airs special programming – holiday-specific programs; coverage of the deaths of Supreme Pontiffs; Papal conclaves, Papal elections, inaugurations, and visits; Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and Easter Masses; installations of bishops, archbishops, and cardinals; and World Youth Days.

EWTN&#x27;s top news program, &quot;EWTN News Nightly&quot;, is hosted by Tracy Sabol and features correspondents Erik Rosales, Owen T. Jensen, Mark Irons and Colm Flynn. It was previously anchored by Lauren Ashburn, who in turn succeeded founding anchor and journalist Colleen Carroll Campbell.

==Views, criticism, Apostolic visitation ==

===World Youth Day (1993) ===

Until 1993, EWTN head Mother Angelica showed little propensity for politically conservative culture warfare, stating for example on October 27, 1992, &quot;I believe people should vote pro-life, but life is everything: the elderly, the born, the unborn, all of us.&quot; However, in a 1993 episode of &quot;Mother Angelica Live&quot; broadcast live from World Youth Day 1993, Mother Angelica harshly criticized a mimed re-enactment of the Stations of the Cross where a woman played Jesus, which Pope John Paul II did not attend. Mother Angelica denounced the display as &quot;an abomination to the Eternal Father&quot; and proceeded with a half-hour criticism of the &quot;liberal church in America&quot; and the post Second Vatican Council reforms. &quot;I&#x27;m so tired of you, liberal church in America[...] Your whole purpose is to destroy[...] It&#x27;s time somebody said something about all these tiny little cracks that you have been putting for the last 30 years into the church.&quot; Among other things she opined that &quot;We&#x27;re just tired of you constantly pushing anti-God, anti-Catholic and pagan ways into the Catholic Church. Leave us alone. Don&#x27;t pour your poison, your venom, on all the church.&quot;

Then-Archbishop of Milwaukee Rembert Weakland criticized Mother Angelica&#x27;s comment as &quot;one of the most disgraceful, un-Christian, offensive, and divisive diatribes I have ever heard&quot;. Mother Angelica responded that &quot;He didn&#x27;t think a woman playing Jesus was offensive? He can go put his head in the back toilet as far as I am concerned!&quot; The event is believed by some (&quot;National Catholic Reporter&quot;) to mark Mother Angelica&#x27;s emergence &quot;as a culture warrior&quot;, as prior to it she had sometimes &quot;criticized feminists&quot; but &quot;rarely, if ever, attacked the ecclesiastical hierarchy&quot;. Following the attack, &quot;Mother Angelica and the sisters in her convent abandoned their modified post-Vatican II habits in favor of the pre-Vatican II style.&quot;

In 1997, Mother Angelica publicly criticized Cardinal Roger Mahony, then Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, for his pastoral letter on the Eucharist, &quot;Gather Faithfully Together: A Guide for Sunday Mass&quot;, which she perceived as lacking emphasis on transubstantiation (the presence of Christ in the Eucharist): &quot;I&#x27;m afraid my obedience in that diocese would be absolutely zero. And I hope everybody else&#x27;s in that diocese is zero&quot;. Cardinal Mahony regarded her comments as accusing him of heresy. Mother Angelica later conditionally apologized for her comments.

In 1999, Bishop David E. Foley of the Diocese of Birmingham, Alabama, issued a decree prohibiting priests in his diocese from celebrating Mass (which literally denotes &#x27;to the east&#x27;, which refers to the priest having their back to the congregation) under most circumstances. Although the decree did not specifically name EWTN, supporters and critics generally agreed that the decree, which applied to &quot;any Mass that is or will be televised for broadcast or videotaped for public dissemination&quot;, was authored specifically to target EWTN. Bishop Foley stated that the practice of the priest celebrating &quot;amounts to making a political statement and is dividing the people.&quot;

=== Apostolic Visitation (2000) ===
In 2000, Archbishop Roberto González Nieves of San Juan, Puerto Rico, performed an apostolic visitation of EWTN. Nieves focused on three issues – the actual ownership of the network; the associated monastery&#x27;s right to donate property to EWTN; and, since she had never been elected, the authority of Mother Angelica. However, before Nieves could write his final report, Mother Angelica resigned from her positions as EWTN CEO and board chair. According to Global Sister Report, a final report by Nieves was never issued, and &quot;even today, outsiders know little about what occurred&quot;. When asked about the visitation by Global Sister, &quot;EWTN did not respond&quot;.

===Conflict with Pope Francis===
In March 2021, Pope Francis reportedly told the EWTN reporter and cameraman on board a papal flight to Iraq that the network &quot;should stop bad-mouthing me,&quot; according to a report in the Jesuit magazine &quot;America.&quot; On a 2021 trip to Slovakia, Francis complained in a &quot;meeting with Jesuits&quot; that &quot;a large Catholic television channel that has no hesitation in continually speaking ill of the pope,&quot; and that &quot;they are the work of the devil[...] I have also said this to some of them.&quot; In reply, archbishop emeritus Charles J. Chaput, who &quot;led the archdiocese of Philadelphia and who is a former EWTN board member&quot;, stated that &quot;any suggestion that EWTN is unfaithful to the Church&quot; is &quot;simply vindictive and false.&quot;

Recurring guests on the weekly EWTN show &quot;The World Over&quot;, hosted by EWTN anchor Raymond Arroyo, include:

Other guests include Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, who has called on the pope to resign. EWTN also features a group calling itself &quot;The Papal Posse&quot;—which includes along with Raymond Arroyo, the Rev. Gerald Murray (a New York priest, former U.S. Navy chaplain and canon lawyer), and Robert Royal (a Catholic author who founded the D.C. think tank the Faith and Reason Institute and the blog &quot;The Catholic Thing&quot;)—that according to Colleen Dulle of America magazine, &quot;riffs on one another&#x27;s criticisms of the pope and has given uncritical interviews to anti-Francis guests like Steve Bannon, who argued on air that his own populist politics better represent Catholic social teaching than Pope Francis does&quot;.

=== Francis Mary Stone ===
In 2007, Francis Mary Stone, an ordained Catholic priest who hosted the network&#x27;s show &quot;Life On The Rock&quot;, was suspended from the network after it was revealed that he violated his vow of celibate chastity and fathered a child with EWTN employee Christina Presnell. Stone was forced on leave of absence, and Presnell was fired from EWTN. By 2018, he was reported to be suspended from his religious order.

=== Gloria Purvis ===
In summer 2020, the network came under fire from listeners for its &quot;Morning Glory&quot; show, a radio program hosted by Gloria Purvis and Deacon Harold Burke-Sivers (both African American), and Msgr Charles Pope, among other guest hosts. In the wake of the murder of George Floyd, Purvis became known for defending anti-racist measures around the country in response, while the more conservative Burke-Sivers, Pope, and another priest opposed the measures and Purvis&#x27; sentiments.

Listeners from EWTN&#x27;s largest radio affiliate, Guadalupe Radio Network, complained about the alleged &quot;conflicts&quot; and GRN suspended the show in response, making headlines in Catholic media and elsewhere. Purvis was interviewed by the &quot;New York Times&quot; concerning the controversy, and EWTN initially expressed support for her and said the show would continue to be produced despite the suspension (which was in fact permanent).

In December 2020, however, the network canceled the show without explanation, occasioning accusations of racism. Purvis was hired for her own podcast affiliated with America Media in 2021.

== Viewership ==
EWTN is the largest religious media network in the world, and it says it has a reach of a quarter-billion people in 140 countries. The network is unrated in the United States, though various articles cite millions of viewers watch per month. On YouTube and other social media platforms, EWTN has more than 1,000,000 active followers and online viewers. EWTN is also available on demand on streaming services Roku, Kindle, and Apple TV. EWTN&#x27;s Internet site is viewed three to four million times monthly, according to SimilarWeb. In the United States, EWTN is available through most cable and satellite providers with a reach of around 70 million households. EWTN had an annual revenue of $64,946,744 in 2019, and has received an 84.3 (out of 100) overall score and rating from Charity Navigator.

== List of programs ==
== Branding ==
The logo of EWTN has incorporated a globe outline in some form since the network&#x27;s launch in 1981 to suggest the network&#x27;s hope of a worldwide reach, usually with an outline of the dome of Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica within a profile of a satellite dish inside of it. 

The network had the sub-branding of the &quot;Catholic Cable Network&quot; until 1995, when with the American launch of DirecTV and Dish direct satellite broadcasters (where it was a charter network with both providers) it took a new sub-branding of &quot;International Catholic Network&quot;, then &quot;Global Catholic Network&quot; in 1996 as it began to move towards satellite, then to the current day, Internet-based broadcasting worldwide.

<text>Anchor bottlers are a soft drink manufacturer’s major bottlers around the world. For example, The Coca-Cola Company employed the strategy of &quot;anchor bottlers&quot; to penetrate markets like China, Eastern Europe and Russia.

Notable anchor bottlers include:

* Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, subsidiary of The Coca-Cola Company, the company&#x27;s anchor bottler for the North American market.
* Coca-Cola Europacific Partners, spun out by The Coca-Cola Company in 1986 and now covering Belgium, continental France, Great Britain, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden, as a result of a three-way combination completed on May 28, 2016, of the former Coca-Cola Enterprises, the Coca-Cola bottler covering Spain and Portugal and the Coca-Cola bottler in Germany.
* Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company (&quot;CCHBC&quot;) formed from the de-merger of Coca-Cola Amatil&#x27;s eastern European interests into Coca-Cola Beverages and that company&#x27;s subsequent merger with the Hellenic Bottling Company, now covering 29 countries in central and Eastern Europe, Russia and Nigeria and Egypt.
* Coca-Cola Amatil covering Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea;
* Coca-Cola Icecek (&quot;CCI&quot;) covering Turkey; Middle Eastern (Iraq, Jordan, Syria), Central Asian (Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan) and South Asian (Pakistan &amp; Bangladesh) regions
* Coca-Cola Beverages Philippines, Inc., covering the Philippines
* The Pepsi Beverages subsidiary of PepsiCo is the company&#x27;s anchor bottler for the North American market.
* The bottling subsidiary of Dr Pepper Snapple, formerly the Dr Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Group, is the anchor bottler for most of the company&#x27;s soda brands in the US.
* Carlsberg Breweries, which in 2001 took over part of the Scandinavian market from Coca-Cola Nordic Beverages after Orkla and Carlsberg A/S merged their beverages operations, while Coca-Cola took over Swedish and Norwegian activities and the Icelandic factory was sold to local investors.
*Swire covering the Greater China region.

<text>The Thomas J. Hatem Memorial Bridge is a road bridge in northeast Maryland that crosses the Susquehanna River between Havre de Grace and Perryville via Garrett Island. It carries U.S. Route 40. It is the oldest of the eight toll facilities operated and maintained by the Maryland Transportation Authority, and the southernmost automotive bridge across the Susquehanna.

It is named for Thomas J. Hatem, whose long involvement in Harford County politics (as a Democrat) includes one term in the Maryland House of Delegates, a long stint as a county commissioner, service as state insurance commissioner and six years on the Public Service Commission.

==Background==
The bridge was far from the first crossing of the Susquehanna River between the Harford County community of Havre de Grace and the Cecil County town of Perryville. A succession of ferries made the trip for more than 200 years, and two railroad bridges were constructed during the last half of the 19th century. The first vehicle bridge was converted from a railroad bridge constructed in 1873. It opened in 1910, and was operated by a group of private citizens as a toll facility until 1923.

The State Roads Commission (SRC), predecessor of the Authority, bought the bridge in 1923 and continued to operate it as a toll facility. The structure was extremely narrow, with a roadway only wide. Heavy trucks inched past each other, and there were many side-swiping accidents on the bridge. Traffic usually moved at a snail’s pace. To alleviate the problem, the SRC in 1926 built a second deck over the old bridge, converting each level into a crossing for one-way traffic. This project was considered one of the most ingenious bridge-engineering feats of the time. Then new problems surfaced. The new deck had a vertical clearance of — barely sufficient to accommodate the growing number of commercial vehicles traveling the bridge in the 1930s. Frequently, trucks stacked too high with freight became wedged between the deck and the overhead structure and could proceed only after their tires were deflated to allow adequate clearance. The need for a newer, more modern structure became apparent in the mid-1930s.

At the same time, the Maryland General Assembly authorized the State Roads Commission to formulate a comprehensive plan for the construction of bridges and tunnels across major bodies of water in Maryland. These projects would be financed and operated through toll funding. The plan developed by the SRC was ratified by the United States Congress in 1938 under its regulatory powers over navigable waterways. The plan became known as Maryland’s Primary Bridge Program and provided, among other projects, for the construction of a bridge across the Susquehanna River parallel to the overtaxed double-decker structure. Construction of this new span, which was designed by the J. E. Greiner Company, began in February 1939 and was completed at a cost of $4.5 million.

==Operations==

The bridge, named the Susquehanna River Toll Bridge, opened to traffic on August 28, 1940. The obsolete double-decker bridge was later demolished (there was an effort to keep it for local traffic, but then its steel was taken for the war effort). The first toll collectors at the bridge were all men; this changed as World War II drew men to military service and women took over traditionally male-dominated jobs.

Exact-change lanes were a novelty in toll collection when they were installed at the bridge in 1958. Their contribution to efficient toll collection was overshadowed in 1976 with the introduction of AVI (Automatic Vehicle Identification) decals. AVI works on the same principle as automated checkouts at retail stores, and the decal itself looks like a large universal-product code symbol commonly found on many items.

The bridge was renamed after Thomas J. Hatem died in 1985 at age 59; the official renaming took place in May 1986.

In 1991, a one-way toll collection system was introduced, and the $8.00 toll is now collected in the eastbound direction only. The barcode decal, for $10, is no longer issued. Motorists may purchase the Thomas Hatem Bridge Plan for a Maryland E-ZPass. This plan costs $20 for 12 months&#x27; unlimited use. In April 2019, MDTA announced that the bridge will become a cashless toll facility by October 2019. With this system, customers without E-ZPass will pay using video tolling. Cashless tolling began on the bridge on October 16, 2019.

In 2012, Harford Transit introduced bus service across the bridge, linking Havre de Grace and Perryville.

Bicycles were long prohibited on the bridge, which lacks a safe shoulder. On July 1, 2016, the bridge opened to bicyclists, along with lights to warn drivers about bicycles in the travel lanes. Initially, bicyclists were allowed to use the bridge all week long, with limited hours on weekdays, but since September 6, 2016, bicycle passage has been restricted to weekends, holidays, and other designated dates. Bicycle usage in the first two months was minimal, but Maryland officials said the change was unrelated.

<doc id="1342098" wikidata="Q934309" url="?curid=1342098" title="Mediterranean cuisine">
<text>Mediterranean cuisine is the food and methods of preparation used by the people of the Mediterranean basin. The idea of a Mediterranean cuisine originates with the cookery writer Elizabeth David&#x27;s book, &quot;A Book of Mediterranean Food&quot; (1950), and was amplified by other writers working in English.

Many writers define the three core elements of the cuisine as the olive, wheat, and the grape, yielding olive oil, bread and pasta, and wine; other writers deny that the widely varied foods of the Mediterranean basin constitute a cuisine at all. A common definition of the geographical area covered, proposed by David, follows the distribution of the olive tree.

The region spans a wide variety of cultures with distinct cuisines, in particular (going anticlockwise around the region) the Maghrebi, Egyptian, Levantine, Ottoman (Turkish), Greek, Italian, French (Provençal), and Spanish, although some authors include additional cuisines. Portuguese cuisine, in particular, is partly Mediterranean in character.

The historical connections of the region, as well as the impact of the Mediterranean Sea on the region&#x27;s climate and economy, mean that these cuisines share dishes beyond the core trio of oil, bread, and wine, such as roast lamb or mutton, meat stews with vegetables and tomato (for example, Spanish &quot;andrajos&quot;), vegetable stews (Provençal ratatouille, Spanish &quot;pisto&quot;, Italian &quot;ciambotta&quot;), and the salted cured fish roe, bottarga, found across the region. Spirits based on anise are drunk in many countries around the Mediterranean.

The cooking of the area is not to be confused with the Mediterranean diet, made popular because of the apparent health benefits of a diet rich in olive oil, wheat and other grains, fruits, vegetables, and a certain amount of seafood, but low in meat and dairy products. Mediterranean cuisine encompasses the ways that these and other ingredients, including meat, are dealt with in the kitchen, whether they are health-giving or not.

== Geography ==

Various authors have defined the scope of Mediterranean cooking either by geography or by its core ingredients. Elizabeth David, in her &quot;A Book of Mediterranean Food&quot; (1950), defines her scope as &quot;the cooking of the Mediterranean shores&quot; and sketches out the geographical limits:

Despite this definition, David&#x27;s book focuses largely on Spain, France, Italy, and Greece.

She defines this region as coextensive with the range of the olive tree: &quot;those blessed lands of sun and sea and olive trees.&quot; The olive&#x27;s natural distribution is limited by frost and by availability of water. It is therefore constrained to a more or less narrow zone around the Mediterranean Sea, except in the Maghreb and in the Iberian Peninsula, where it is distributed more widely, and on the islands of the Mediterranean, where it is widespread.

The Tunisian historian Mohamed Yassine Essid similarly defines the region by the olive&#x27;s presence, along with bread, wheat, and the grape as the &quot;basic products of Mediterranean folk cuisine&quot;:

Other authors question that there is any such common core:

Some writers include the cuisines of the eastern Adriatic coast of Dalmatia—Albanian, Montenegrin, and Croatian, while most do not mention them. Some writers also include areas not touching the Mediterranean Sea or supporting olive cultivation, including Serbian, Macedonian, and Portuguese cuisine.

== Key ingredients ==

Essid identifies the &quot;trinity&quot; of basic ingredients of traditional Mediterranean cuisine as the olive, wheat, and the grape, yielding oil, bread, and wine respectively. The archaeologist Colin Renfrew calls this the &quot;Mediterranean triad&quot;.

=== Olive ===

The olive appears to come from the region of Persia and Mesopotamia, at least 6,000 years ago. It spread from there to nearby areas, and has been cultivated since the early Bronze Age (up to 3,150 BC) in southern Turkey, the Levant, and Crete. The ten countries with the largest harvests (in 2011) are all near the Mediterranean (Portugal being the tenth largest): together, they produce 95% of the world&#x27;s olives.

The olive yields bitter fruits, made edible by curing and fermentation, and olive oil. Some 90% of the fruit production (1996) goes into olive oil. The Mediterranean region accounts for the world&#x27;s highest consumption of olive oil: in 2014, the highest-consuming country, Greece, used 17 kg per head; Italy, 12 kg, Spain, 13 kg; the United States for comparison used only 1 kg per head.

=== Wheat ===

Wheat was domesticated in the Fertile Crescent, in and near the Levant some 10,000 years ago. Its ancestors include wild emmer wheat; this was hybridised, harvested and sown to create domestic strains with larger grains, in ears that shatter less readily than wild forms. It was spread across the Mediterranean region as far as Spain by 5,000 BC.

Wheat is a staple food in the Mediterranean region. Wheat bread was already critically important in the empire of ancient Rome, which included the entire region; at that time, around 2,000 years ago, North Africa was the &quot;breadbasket&quot; of the empire. Other staple wheat-based Mediterranean foods include pasta and semolina (wheat middlings) products such as couscous and bulgur. In turn, these are made into dishes such as the Greek dessert &quot;galaktoboureko&quot; (&quot;milk börek&quot;), consisting of filo pastry parcels around a custard made with semolina. A widespread wheat dish from Turkey and the Levant to Iran and India is halva, a dessert of sweetened semolina with butter, milk, and pine kernels.

=== Grape ===

The grape was domesticated between 7,000 and 4,000 BC between the Black Sea and Persia; archaeological evidence shows that wine was being made there by 6,000 BC, reaching Greece and Crete in the fifth millennium BC and Spain by the last millennium BC. Winemaking started in Italy in the ninth century BC, and in France around 600 BC.

Grapes are mostly grown for making wine and vinegar as basic components of the Mediterranean diet, as well for drying as raisins or for eating as table grapes. Raisins and table grape varieties are chosen for their flavour. 

== History ==

=== Concept ===

The concept of a Mediterranean cuisine is very recent, probably dating from the publication of David&#x27;s &quot;A Book of Mediterranean Food&quot; (1950). David herself did not use the term, speaking instead of Mediterranean &quot;food&quot;, &quot;cookery&quot;, or &quot;cooking&quot;. The usefulness of the concept is disputed. Carol Helstosky, author of the book &quot;Food Culture in the Mediterranean&quot; (2009), is among the authors who use &quot;Mediterranean cuisine&quot; interchangeably with &quot;Mediterranean food&quot;. In the preface to her book she writes:

Essid acknowledges that &quot;geographical differences and the vicissitudes of history&quot; have affected the food of different Mediterranean lands, but nonetheless asserts that:

On the other hand, Sami Zubaida argues in his book &quot;Culinary Cultures of the Middle East&quot; (1994) that:

The cookery author Clifford A. Wright wrote in 1999: &quot;There really is no such thing as &#x27;Mediterranean cuisine&#x27;. At the same time, we seem to know what we mean when we use the expression ...&quot; Wright argued that David&#x27;s book itself was largely about specifically &quot;French&quot; Mediterranean food, pointing out that &quot;only 4 percent of her recipes come from North Africa or the Levant&quot;, so that the focus was on an aspect of European cuisine, largely omitting coverage of Middle Eastern cuisine.

Since David&#x27;s time, a variety of books on Mediterranean cuisine have been written, including Abu Shihab&#x27;s 2012 book of that name; Helstosky&#x27;s 2009 book; books by other cookery writers include S. Rowe&#x27;s &quot;Purple Citrus and Sweet Perfume: Cuisine of the Eastern Mediterranean&quot; (2011); and Mari-Pierre Moine&#x27;s &quot;Mediterranean Cookbook&quot; (2014). There are many more cookbooks covering specific cuisines in the Mediterranean area, such as B. Santich&#x27;s &quot;The Original Mediterranean Cuisine: Medieval Recipes for Today&quot; (1995), on Catalan and Italian recipes; and H. F. Ullman&#x27;s (2006), on the cooking of Tunisia, Spain, and Italy, each one subtitled &quot;Mediterranean Cuisine&quot;.

=== Origins ===

The ingredients of Mediterranean cuisine are to an extent different from those of the cuisine of Northern Europe, with olive oil instead of butter, and wine instead of beer. The list of available ingredients has changed over the centuries. One major change was the introduction of many foods by the Arabs to Portugal, Spain, and Sicily in the Middle Ages. Those foods included aubergines, spinach, sugar cane, rice, apricots, and citrus fruits, creating the distinctive culinary tradition of Al-Andalus.

Another major change was the arrival of foods from the Americas in early modern times (around the sixteenth century), notably the incorporation of the potato into Northern European cuisine, and the eager adoption of the tomato into Mediterranean cuisine. The tomato, so central now to that cuisine, was first described in print by Pietro Andrea Mattioli in 1544. Similarly, many of the species of &quot;Phaseolus&quot; beans now used around the Mediterranean, including &quot;P. vulgaris&quot; (the French or haricot bean), were brought back from the Americas by Spanish and Portuguese explorers.

== Cooking ==

David&#x27;s introduction to her 1950 book characterises the cooking of the Mediterranean countries as &quot;conditioned naturally by variations in climate and soil and the relative industry or indolence of the inhabitants&quot;.

David identifies &quot;the ever recurring elements&quot; in the food of this extensive region as olive oil, saffron, garlic, &quot;pungent&quot; local wines, as well as the &quot;aromatic perfume&quot; of herbs, especially rosemary, wild marjoram, and basil, and the bright colours of fresh foods in the markets, &quot;pimentos, aubergines, tomatoes, olives, melons, figs&quot; and &quot;shiny fish, silver, vermilion, or tiger-striped&quot;. She includes cheeses of &quot;sheep&#x27;s or goat&#x27;s milk&quot;, &quot;figs from Smyrna on long strings&quot; and &quot;sheets of apricot paste which is dissolved in water to make a cooling drink&quot;.

With common ingredients including the olive, wheat, and grape; a shared climate; and a long period for cultural exchange, it might be expected that a single, pan-Mediterranean cuisine would have developed. Certain items, such as olive oil, bread, wine, roast lamb, or mutton (such as Maghrebi &quot;méchoui&quot;, Greek &quot;kleftiko&quot; and souvlaki, and Turkish shish kebab), bottarga, and stews of meat with vegetables and tomato (such as Spanish &quot;andrajos&quot;, French &quot;&quot;, Italian &quot;ciambotta&quot;, and Turkish &quot;buğu kebabı&quot;), are indeed found all around the Mediterranean. Seafood including sea bream and squid is eaten, often in stews, stuffed, or fried, in Spanish, French, and Italian dishes. Despite this, however, the lands bordering the Mediterranean sea have distinct regional cuisines, from the Maghrebi, Levant, and Ottoman to the Italian, French, and Spanish. Each of those, in turn, has national and provincial variations.

=== Maghrebi ===

Mediterranean Maghrebi cuisine includes the cuisines of Algeria, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia. One of the most characteristic dishes of the region is couscous, a steamed, small-grained wheat semolina, served with a stew. The dish is ancient, mentioned by the Medieval traveller Ibn Battuta, and found for example also in the Western Sicilian cuisine, especially in the province of Trapani, where it was re-introduced after 1600.

One stew that may be served with couscous is the Moroccan tagine, a hearty, somewhat dry dish of meat and vegetables, cooked slowly in a pot (called a tagine) with a tall conical lid. Dishes from the Maghreb region of North Africa are often coloured and flavoured with the hot spice mixtures harissa and ras el hanout (containing such spices as cumin, coriander, saffron, cinnamon, cloves, chillies, and paprika). Other characteristic flavourings of the region are preserved lemons and dried apricots and raisins.

=== Egyptian ===

Egyptian cuisine has ancient roots, with evidence that, for example, cheese has been made in Egypt since at least 3,000 BC. Falafel are small fried croquettes of bean or chickpea flour, currently also eaten across the Levant and the West, but originating in Egypt&#x27;s Roman era; they are claimed as theirs by Coptic Christians. &quot;Duqqa&quot; is a dip made of pounded herbs, hazelnuts, and spices, eaten with bread. &quot;Kushari&quot; is a vegan dish of rice, lentils, and pasta, variously garnished; it began as food for the poor, but has become a national dish.

=== Levantine ===

Levantine cuisine is the cooking of the Levant (Mediterranean coast, east of Egypt). Among the most distinctive foods of this cuisine are traditional small meze dishes such as tabbouleh, hummus, and baba ghanoush. Tabbouleh is a dish of bulgur cracked wheat with tomatoes, parsley, mint, and onion, dressed with olive oil and lemon juice. Baba ghanoush, sometimes called &quot;poor man&#x27;s caviar&quot;, is a puree of aubergine with olive oil, often mixed with chopped onion, tomato, cumin, garlic, lemon juice, and parsley. The dish is popular across the whole of the Eastern Mediterranean and North Africa.

&quot;Ful medames&quot;, originally from Egypt and still a national dish there, consists of fava beans with oil and cumin; it is popular throughout the Levant. The dish may be ancient: dried beans of Neolithic age have been found near Nazareth, Israel.

=== Ottoman ===

Ottoman cuisine has given rise to the cuisines of modern Turkey, parts of the Balkans, Cyprus, and Greece. A distinctive element is the family of small flaky pastries called &quot;börek&quot;. These are popular and widespread across the Eastern Mediterranean region, and date as far back as ancient Roman times. &quot;Börek&quot; are made of thin sheets of filo pastry, filled with mixtures such as meat, caramelised onion and sweet peppers.

Another widespread and popular dish is moussaka, a baked dish of aubergine or potato with various other ingredients: often minced meat and tomatoes, sometimes a layer of egg custard or béchamel sauce on top. In its Greek variant, well known outside the region, it includes layers of aubergine and minced meat with custard or béchamel sauce on top, but that version is a relatively recent innovation, introduced by the chef Nikolaos Tselementes in the 1920s.

=== Greek ===

Greek cookery makes wide use of vegetables, olive oil, grains, fish, wine, and meat (white and red, including lamb, poultry, rabbit, and pork). Other important ingredients include olives, cheese, aubergine, courgette, lemon juice, vegetables, herbs, bread, and yoghurt. Some more dishes that can be traced back to ancient Greece are: lentil soup, &quot;fasolada&quot;, retsina (white or rosé wine flavoured with pine resin), and &quot;pasteli&quot; (sesame seeds baked with honey); some to the Hellenistic and Roman periods include: &quot;loukaniko&quot; (dried pork sausage); and Byzantium: feta cheese, &quot;avgotaraho&quot; (bottarga), and &quot;paximadhia&quot; (rusk). &quot;Lakerda&quot; (pickled fish), mizithra cheese and desserts such as &quot;diples&quot;, &quot;koulourakia&quot;, &quot;moustokouloura&quot;, and &quot;melomakarono&quot; also date back to the Byzantine period, while the variety of different pitas probably dates back to ancient times. Much of Greek cuisine is part of the larger tradition of Ottoman cuisine, the names of the dishes revealing Arabic, Persian, or Turkish roots: moussaka, tzatziki, &quot;yuvarlakia&quot;, keftes, and so on. Many dishes&#x27; names probably entered the Greek vocabulary during Ottoman times, or earlier in contact with the Persians and the Arabs. However, some dishes may be pre-Ottoman, only taking Turkish names later; the historians of food John Ash and Andrew Dalby, for example, speculate that grape-leaf dolmadhes were made by the early Byzantine period, while Alan Davidson traces &quot;trahana&quot; to the ancient Greek &quot;tragos&quot; and &quot;skordalia&quot; to the ancient Athenian &quot;skorothalmi&quot;.

=== Balkan ===

David barely mentioned the non-Greek Balkans, stating only that yoghurt and moussaka are widespread in the region. Some later cooks, such as Paula Wolfert, give a few recipes from Dalmatia, some being Ottoman.

Albena Shkodrova notes that the cuisines of the coastal provinces of Istria and Dalmatia were influenced by Venice. She adds that cuisines labelled as &quot;Italian&quot; and &quot;Mediterranean&quot; are becoming popular in the Balkans, which she calls &quot;a historical crossroads of Oriental, Mediterranean and Central-European influences&quot;.

=== Italian ===


Mediterranean Italian cuisine includes much of Italy outside the north and the mountainous inland regions. It is a diverse cuisine, but among its best-known and most characteristic foods are pizza in Neapolitan and Sicilian styles, pasta dishes such as spaghetti, and risotto.

Risotto is a dish made using Italian short-grain rice, which is both highly absorbent and resistant to turning into a pudding when cooked with stock and flavoured with onions and garlic, cooked in butter. Anna Gosetti della Salda&#x27;s book of Italian regional cookery lists 37 risotto recipes, 18 of them from the Veneto. Variations among Veneto risottos include additions of fish and white wine; chicken; eel; mushrooms and grated Parmesan cheese; quails; small pieces of beef; courgettes; clams; ragù; beans; mussels; prawns; cuttlefish; and asparagus.

Pizza is a piece of bread dough rolled out thin, with a topping which varies from place to place, but is generally much simpler than those in the English-speaking world. Although the toppings in Italian pizzas may be, depending on the order, unquantifiable, in the most rigorous tradition of Neapolitan cuisine there are only two variants: Margherita and marinara.

Spaghetti dishes also vary. It may be eaten as David says &quot;simply with olive oil and garlic&quot;, without cheese, or with a sauce of &quot;very red and ripe peeled tomatoes&quot;, cooked briefly and flavoured with garlic and either basil or parsley.

=== French ===
 

Mediterranean French cuisine includes the cooking styles of Provence, Occitania, and the island of Corsica. Distinctive dishes that make use of local ingredients include bouillabaisse and salade niçoise.

Bouillabaisse is a substantial dish from the French port of Marseille, capital of Provence. It is a stew for at least eight people, because it should contain many types of fish such as crayfish, gurnard, weever, John Dory, monkfish, conger eel, whiting, sea bass, and crab. These are cooked with Mediterranean vegetables and herbs, namely onions, garlic, tomatoes, thyme, fennel, parsley, bay, and orange peel.
Salade niçoise is a colourful salad of tomatoes, tuna, hard-boiled eggs, Niçoise olives, and anchovies, dressed with a vinaigrette.

=== Spanish ===

Spain&#x27;s varied Mediterranean cuisines include the cooking of Andalusia, Murcia, Catalonia, Valencia, and the Balearic islands. Paella is a characteristic Spanish dish, originally from Valencia, radiating early on to Catalonia and Murcia along Spain&#x27;s Mediterranean coast. It comes in many versions, and may contain a mixture of chicken, pork, rabbit, or shellfish, sautéed in olive oil in a large shallow pan, with vegetables, and typically round-grain rice (often of the local &quot;albufera&quot;, &quot;arròs bomba&quot;, &quot;sénia&quot; varieties or similar) cooked to absorb the water and coloured with saffron. The dish may be varied with artichoke hearts, peas, sweet peppers, lima beans, string beans, or sausages.

Catalan cuisine has developed over centuries since ancient times in a cultural context distinct from that of other parts of Spain. It arose from the cooking of the Romans who occupied Iberia for nearly 700 years, until the latter part of the 5th century. Catalan cooking is a sophisticated cuisine with its own methods and recipes, and was influenced by Moorish, French, and Italian cookery. It shares with other Mediterranean cuisines ingredients such as bread and wine, fresh herbs and fruit, olive oil, garlic, tomatoes, peppers, onions, fish and shellfish, rice, pasta, sausages, lentils, chickpeas, and nuts including hazelnuts, almonds, and pine nuts.

=== Portuguese: partly Mediterranean ===

Portugal lies on the Atlantic, not the Mediterranean, but it is in the Mediterranean basin, characterised by olive groves and a Mediterranean climate, except on the wetter Atlantic coast. Its cuisine too is partly Mediterranean, with the usual trio of bread, wine, and olive oil, but also partly Atlantic, with a tradition of fishing and many seafood dishes such as seafood rice (&quot;arroz de Marisco&quot;), clams, squid (&quot;lulas grelhadas&quot;), and &quot;bacalhau&quot;, imported salted cod. There are, equally, many meat dishes, using chicken, pork, and rabbit. Other major ingredients are onions, garlic, bay leaves, sweet peppers (&quot;pimentão&quot;), cloves, and &quot;chouriço&quot; sausage. Portuguese vegetables include the tomatoes common in Mediterranean cuisine, but also kale, carrots, and broad beans. Sweet dishes include &quot;pastéis de nata&quot;, custard tarts with cinnamon. The country produces red wines such as Alentejo.&#x27;

== Anise spirits ==

Anise is used around the Mediterranean to flavour various traditional spirits, including:

* French pastis and absinthe
* Greek ouzo
* Italian sambuca
* Spanish anísado
* Balkan rakı
* Levantine arak
* Algerian anisette cristal

== Mediterranean diet and cuisine ==

The Mediterranean diet, popularised in the 1970s, is inspired by the cuisine of Greece, especially Crete, and Southern Italy in the early 1960s. The American Diabetes Association writes about &quot;Mediterranean-Style Eating&quot;, mentioning &quot;the traditional Mediterranean lifestyle ... of ... eating healthfully ... together among family and friends&quot;, and asserting that &quot;Mediterranean cuisine is plant-based&quot;, citing the ingredients &quot;whole grains, fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices, beans, nuts, seeds, and olive oil&quot;, and stating that most foods &quot;in a Mediterranean diet come from plants&quot;.
The 1984 &quot;Guida all&#x27;Italia gastronomica&quot; states that, &quot;around 1975, under the impulse of one of those new nutritional directives by which good cooking is too often influenced, the Americans discovered the so-called Mediterranean diet. The name even pleased Italian government officials, who made one modification: changing from &quot;diet&quot;—a word which has always seemed punitive and therefore unpleasant—to Mediterranean &quot;cuisine&quot;.&quot;

== Developments since 1950 ==

Since David wrote about Mediterranean food in 1950, and indeed since dietary researchers showed in the 1950s that people around the Mediterranean had less coronary heart disease than the peoples of Northern Europe, the traditional Mediterranean ways of life and of eating have changed. Increased wealth and busy lives have led people to eat more meat and less vegetables: their diet is becoming more Northern European, with more convenience foods and with less of a preventive effect on cardiovascular disease.

In 2013, &quot;Mediterranean diet&quot;, stated to encompass the &quot;skills, knowledge, rituals, symbols and traditions concerning crops, harvesting, fishing, animal husbandry, conservation, processing, cooking, and particularly the sharing and consumption of food&quot; of the Mediterranean basin, was inscribed on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

<doc id="1342111" wikidata="Q709660" url="?curid=1342111" title="Hoare–Laval Pact">
<text>The Hoare–Laval Pact was an initially secret pact made in December of 1935 between French Foreign Minister Pierre Laval and British Foreign Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare for ending the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. Italy wanted to incorporate the independent nation of Abyssinia (Ethiopia) into its Italian Empire and also avenge the 1896 Battle of Adwa, a humiliating defeat. The pact proposed to partition Abyssinia and thus partially achieve Italian dictator Benito Mussolini&#x27;s goal of making Abyssinia an Italian colony.

The proposal was met with outrage in Britain and France and never went into effect. Hoare and Laval were both sacked.

==Background==
In 1935 the Abyssinian Crisis and Second Italo-Ethiopian War began. In the United Kingdom many people and the official opposition supported League of Nations sanctions against Fascist Italy, as did the Dominions. The government hoped that strong sanctions against Italy might discourage Nazi Germany from similar actions, and won the November general election with a pro-League platform.

On 8 December 1935, British Foreign Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare discussed with his French counterpart Pierre Laval (who was both Prime Minister and Foreign Minister) how to end the war. On 9 December British newspapers revealed leaked details of an agreement by the two men to give much of Ethiopia to Italy to end the war. The British Cabinet had not approved the preliminary plan, but decided to support it to not embarrass Hoare.

==Reaction==

===Britain===

The Pact was met with a wave of moral indignation in Britain. On 10 December the Opposition Labour Party claimed if the reports in the press of the contents of the Pact were true, the government had contradicted the pro-League policy on which it had just won the 1935 election.
The Conservatives dominated the government and cared little for opinion on the left. They paid attention, however, when attacks came from the right. In an editorial titled ‘A Corridor for Camels’, &quot;The Times&quot; on 16 December denounced the Pact and said there never was &quot;the slightest doubt that British public opinion would recommend them for approval by the League as a fair and reasonable basis of negotiations&quot;. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Cosmo Lang, condemned the Pact in a letter to &quot;The Times&quot;, and many other bishops wrote directly to Stanley Baldwin to oppose it.

Duff Cooper, the Secretary of State for War, later wrote:

But before the Duce had time to declare himself there arose a howl of indignation from the people of Great Britain. During my experience of politics I have never witnessed so devastating a wave of public opinion. Even the easy-going constituents of the St. George&#x27;s division were profoundly moved. The post-bag was full and the letters I received were not written by ignorant or emotional people but by responsible citizens who had given sober thought to the matter.

The Conservative Chief Whip told Baldwin: &quot;Our men won&#x27;t stand for it&quot;. Sir Austen Chamberlain in a speech to the Conservative Foreign Affairs Committee condemned the Pact and said: &quot;Gentlemen do not behave in such a way&quot;. Harold Nicolson later wrote that he had had sleepless nights worrying whether he could keep his seat.

===France===

When the Chamber of Deputies debated the Pact on 27 and 28 December, the Popular Front condemned it, with Léon Blum telling Laval: &quot;You have tried to give and to keep. You wanted to have your cake and eat it. You cancelled your words by your deeds and your deeds by your words. You have debased everything by fixing, intrigue and slickness... Not sensitive enough to the importance of great moral issues, you have reduced everything to the level of your petty methods&quot;.

Yvon Delbos declared: &quot;Your plan is dead and buried. From its failure, which is as total as possible, you could have – but you have not – drawn a personal conclusion. Two lessons emerge. The first is that you were in a dead end because you upset everyone without satisfying Italy. The second is that we must return to the spirit of the Covenant [of the League of Nations] by preserving agreement with the nations gathered at Geneva&quot;.

Paul Reynaud attacked the government for aiding Hitler by ruining the Anglo-French alliance. On the motion of censure, the French government had a majority of 296 votes to 276, with 37 Radicals voting for the government.

==Outcome==
The British government withdrew the plan, and Hoare resigned. In early 1936 Italy began a new, larger advance using poison gas, and entered Addis Ababa on 5 May 1936.

==Historiography==

A. J. P. Taylor argued that it was the event that &quot;killed the League [of Nations]&quot; and that the pact &quot;was a perfectly sensible plan, in line with the League&#x27;s previous acts of conciliation from Corfu to Manchuria&quot; which would have &quot;ended the war; satisfied Italy; and left Abyssinia with a more workable, national territory&quot; but that the &quot;common sense of the plan was, in the circumstances of the time, its vital defect&quot;.

The military historian Correlli Barnett has argued that if Britain alienated Italy, Italy &quot;would be a potential enemy astride England&#x27;s main line of imperial communication at a time when she was already under threat from two existing potential enemies at opposite ends of the line [Germany and Japan]. If – worse – Italy were to fight in a future war as an ally of Germany or Japan, or both, the British would be forced to abandon the Mediterranean for the first time since 1798&quot;. Therefore, in Barnett&#x27;s view, it was &quot;highly dangerous nonsense to provoke Italy&quot; due to Britain&#x27;s military and naval weakness and that therefore the pact was a sensible option.

<doc id="1342112" wikidata="Q3256896" url="?curid=1342112" title="Live &amp; Kicking">
<text>Live &amp; Kicking is a British children&#x27;s television series that originally aired on BBC1 from 2 October 1993 to 15 September 2001. It was the replacement for &quot;Going Live!&quot;, and took many of its features from it, such as phone-ins, games, comedy, competitions and the showing of cartoons. Once &quot;Live &amp; Kicking&quot; had become established in series two, it reached its height in popularity during series four, when it was presented by Zoe Ball and Jamie Theakston; their final edition won a BAFTA award. After this, the programme&#x27;s ratings dropped with the launch of &quot;SMTV Live&quot; on ITV and the show ended in 2001.

==History==
&quot;Live &amp; Kicking&quot; was conceived as a replacement for &quot;Going Live!&quot;. It was first broadcast on 2 October 1993 at 9 am on BBC1. The original hosts were Andi Peters, Emma Forbes who had presented a cookery segment in &quot;Going Live!&quot;, and John Barrowman. For the second series, Barrowman was relegated to hosting the showbiz &quot;Electric Circus&quot; segment, leaving Peters and Forbes to become the main hosts. He left after one series of Electric Circus to concentrate on acting. Comedy duo Trevor and Simon and Peter Simon, in the &quot;Run the Risk&quot; segment, were also regulars who had featured on &quot;Going Live!&quot;.While the first series was not as popular as its predecessor, the second series was more successful.

It was broadcast during the winter months, from September to April, with &quot;Fully Booked&quot; replacing it during the summer. 

New episodes of &quot;Rugrats&quot; were shown. The series went out opposite ITV&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Up Doc?&quot; but during its third series issues were raised by the ITC, and a number of people left including Don Austen and John Eccleston (Bro and Bro&#x27;s puppeteers) who defected to &quot;Live &amp; Kicking&quot; to star as leprechaun brothers Sage and Onion.

Andi Peters decided to leave the programme in 1996, after being offered an executive role at LWT, where he also presented Saturday mid-morning music programme &quot;The Noise&quot;. Emma Forbes initially planned to continue, but during the programme&#x27;s summer break she also decided to leave, after finding out she was pregnant.

They were replaced by Zoë Ball and Jamie Theakston, who presented it for three years. According to the BBC, the show&#x27;s popularity was at its peak during the 1996/1997 series when the show regularly had 2.5 million viewers. Around this time Mr. Blobby, played by Barry Killerby, also appeared on the series.

After three years, Ball decided to move on due to a hectic schedule, and Theakston followed. The final episode hosted by Ball and Theakston later won the show a children&#x27;s BAFTA award for Best Entertainment show in November 1999.

The show returned in Autumn 1999 with new presenters Emma Ledden and Steve Wilson. They only lasted for one series, because ratings dropped to 1.6 million during their tenure. At the same time rival &quot;SMTV Live&quot; on competitor channel ITV was relaunched to feature more comedic elements and its innuendo and features began to gain popularity. &quot;Fully Booked&quot;, the BBC&#x27;s summer replacement, was also revamped and retitled as &quot;FBi&quot;, but ratings continued to drop. The following October, the programme was completely revamped, with a line-up of four: Ortis Deley, Katy Hill, Trey Farley and Sarah Cawood.

Ratings continued to plummet, because of the continuing success of &quot;SMTV Live&quot;. In an unprecedented move, in March 2001 the BBC extended the series over the summer, like &quot;SMTV&quot; was broadcast, but announced it would end in the autumn. Hill was replaced by Heather Suttie as the show was moved to BBC Scotland on 21 April until 15 September 2001 when the final show aired. It was replaced by &quot;The Saturday Show&quot;, which continued to be broadcast all year round.

==Format==
&quot;Live &amp; Kicking&quot; was a weekly magazine show broadcast every Saturday morning, from late September or early October to April and in Series 8, it was broadcast from October to September. It was aimed at young people. It featured music performances, &quot;hot seat&quot; questions for celebrity guests, phone-ins, games, comedy sketches, competitions, and television programmes and cartoons. It used the taglines &quot;Miss it, miss out&quot; and &quot;The only way to start your weekend&quot; on promotional adverts for the show. As well as the main presenters, there were regulars such as comedy duo Trevor and Simon, and later Ben, Gez and Rich from The Cheese Shop and SuperGirly. A segment in the first few series that was an adaptation of &quot;Going Live&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Double Dare&quot; was &quot;Run the Risk&quot;, a game in which teams of children completed various obstacle courses and challenges. Gunge was often included to make the tasks harder. &quot;Run The Risk&quot; was later broadcast separately. From 1994 until 2000, there was a showbiz segment called the &quot;Electric Circus&quot;, which featured the latest films, music, computer games and gossip. It was first presented by John Barrowman after he stepped aside as a regular presenter, and was later hosted by a variety of people.

The first series featured the computerised head of a cat named &quot;Ratz&quot; announcing links, but this was dropped after one series. It was replaced by human announcer Mitch Johnson, who, as well as providing commentary and links for each item, would interact with both the audience and the presenters too. From the second series, two puppet leprechauns, later named as Sage and Onion, became regulars. They were designed and built by Darryl Worbey Studios and played by Don Austen and John Eccleston, who had previously been the puppeteers of the wolves &#x27;Bro &amp; Bro&#x27; on ITV&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Up Doc?&quot; They performed comedy sketches throughout the morning, and often interacted with the people in the studio. Another comedy character who first appeared in the third series was Mr Blobby, who had previously appeared in &quot;Noel&#x27;s House Party&quot;. Most regular features were dropped for the final series, when the show was revamped. A feature that stuck throughout was the jingle for the phone number, first 081 811 8181, then 0181 811 8181, then 0845 610 1515.

As well as the television show, &quot;Live and Kicking&quot; launched a music CD, composed of the best music that artists had sung live on the programme. A video game called &quot;Live and Kicking: Showmaker&quot; was also created, where the user could combine elements of the show to create their own television production on a small scale. A monthly magazine was also produced, though sales of the magazine dropped significantly towards the end of &quot;Live &amp; Kicking&quot;&#x27;s production, reflecting its loss of viewers.

For series five and six, there was a short version of the show that aired on Friday afternoons called &quot;L&amp;K Friday&quot;, but this was cancelled after two series. The regular Saturday presenters Jamie Theakston and Zoe Ball presented the first series, and Steve Wilson and Liz Fraser presented the second series. A 90-minute version of the show also aired on BBC Choice and was entitled &quot;L&amp;K Replay&quot;.

In May 2000, two months before Wilson and Ledden officially resigned from &quot;Live &amp; Kicking&quot;, the show was brought back for a one-off special during the summer break. It was to mix in with the BBC&#x27;s Music Live and the show was titled as &quot;Music Live &amp; Kicking&quot; with Wilson and Ledden returning to present along with future presenter Ortis Deley and special guest presenter Stephen Gately of &quot;Boyzone&quot;. This special was dedicated to a series of music performances (hence the title) and was the first edition to be broadcast in widescreen.

One of the last features was &quot;L&amp;K Castaway&quot;, a spin-off of the BBC reality show &quot;Castaway 2000&quot;. Each week, six children would spend four days on a remote Scottish island, learning how to survive, among other skills. Points were earned through passing various tasks, and were lost if contestants entered the &quot;Temptation Hut&quot;, which contained various modern electrical appliances.

==Overview==
Live &amp; Kicking began on 2 October 1993 and saw the introduction of presenters Andi Peters, Emma Forbes and John Barrowman. Trev and Simon also joined them and provided the comedy for the show; both had also been on the former show &quot;Going Live!&quot; with Forbes.

The computer game for the 1995 series was called &quot;Snuffle the Truffles&quot; and involved viewers guiding a pig character around a pigpen eating truffles, whilst Trev and Simon invited two guests to review videos in the &quot;Video Galleon&quot;. The last show before the programme went on a summer break in 1996 saw Peters and Forbes leave the show. The programme returned in September 1996 with the introduction of new presenters Zoë Ball and Jamie Theakston, and an array of new features.

Its return in 1997 saw the replacement of the white set with a new one that maintained the same shape and layout, but was curvier and larger. This coincided with the show moving into the larger Studio 6. This series also saw the introduction of Ben Ward, Richard Webb and Gerard Foster (known as Ben, Gez and Rich) of The Cheese Shop who took over the comedy from &#x27;Trev and Simon&#x27;. The computer game for this series became &quot;Grabbit Rabbit&quot; which involved guiding &#x27;Warren the Rabbit&#x27; down a course collecting carrots whilst dodging obstacles such as fences and bushes. Ball later said in an interview that Blake Harrison of &quot;The Inbetweeners&quot; had told her that he had once been a player on &quot;Grabbit Rabbit&quot; when he was younger.

In September 1998 Live &amp; Kicking began with the leprechaun Mr Onion being temporarily written out of the show after supposedly being swept down the plughole in the bath. This was done intentionally as puppeteer John Eccleston was in Australia filming for &quot;Farscape&quot; and would not be available. To compensate for Eccleston&#x27;s absence, a new leprechaun puppet was added called &#x27;Shamrock&#x27; (voiced by Rebecca Nagan of &quot;Rosie and Jim&quot; fame). On 3 October 1998, future &quot;Harry Potter&quot; star Daniel Radcliffe also appeared in the audience during &quot;The Hot Seat&quot; item where he proceeded to ask The Chuckle Brothers a question. The final edition before the programme went on a summer break also saw the departure of Ball and Theakston as hosts and featured them both in &quot;The Hot Seat&quot; being interviewed by Michael Parkinson about their time on the show. This episode later went on to win a Children&#x27;s BAFTA in November 1999.

Live &amp; Kicking returned in September 1999 and saw the introduction of new presenters Steve Wilson and Emma Ledden. New features were added however unlike previous series, many of them failed to last and were continuously replaced. It also saw leprechaun Mr Onion return, however Shamrock remained meaning the show now had three leprechaun puppets. A new comedy duo called &quot;Supergirly&quot; were also introduced from January 2000 to fill the gap left by &#x27;Ben, Gez and Rich&#x27; who had quit the show the previous series. Supergirly, which consisted of Louise McClatchy and Jai Simeone, (known as Lou and Jai) would feature in sketches throughout the morning as BBC make-up artists who were rude to the guests.

October 2000 saw a number of major changes to the show. The set was entirely revamped with a new layout, new titles were added along with a new arrangement of the theme tune. Mr Blobby, The Leprechauns, Supergirly, Renoir and Mitch had also been removed from the show and unlike previous series, there were now four presenters instead of two: Katy Hill, Ortis Deley, Trey Farley and Sarah Cawood. The programme also saw the introduction of gunge based games. A new game was also introduced on the roof of BBC Television Centre called &quot;Sacrifice Your Family&quot; which Cawood hosted that put two families against each other in various games.

From 21 April 2001, &quot;Live &amp; Kicking&quot; began broadcasting from BBC Scotland in Glasgow and saw Farley, Cawood and Deley joined by Heather Suttie who replaced Hill. The last show on 15 September 2001 saw many of the old features and presenters return, including leprechauns Mr Sage and Mr Onion, who acknowledged in the final few minutes of the show that they were the longest serving presenters of the show. The final edition ended with a montage of the series&#x27; best moments over a live performance of the Steps song &quot;It&#x27;s The Way You Make Me Feel&quot;.

==Demise and replacement==
The Ball and Theakston era was considered to be when &quot;Live &amp; Kicking&quot; was at its peak in popularity. After their final show on 17 April 1999, they were replaced by new presenters Emma Ledden and Steve Wilson on 25 September 1999. Ledden and Wilson did not know each other at the start of the series, and so there was none of the interaction between them, as seen between Ball and Theakston. Additionally, &quot;SMTV Live&quot; which broadcast opposite on ITV was slowly becoming more popular, and gaining the audience the BBC was losing. After just one series, Ledden and Wilson&#x27;s contracts were not renewed.

Wilson later said that they were dropped just as they were starting to form a relationship, and that Ant &amp; Dec, presenters of SMTV Live, had the edge over them as they had known each other much longer. Ledden had already been dropped when Wilson went through several meetings with the BBC. He decided it was better to leave after one good series, rather than do a second &quot;lame&quot; series, and went on to appear in rival SMTV Live&#x27;s 100th show, in the Friends skit, &#x27;Chums&#x27;. When &quot;Live &amp; Kicking&quot; returned on 7 October 2000, it was completely revamped, with brand new titles and a line-up of four presenters.

However, this did nothing to increase viewing figures, and the chemistry between the presenters was even less apparent. It was decided not to end the show in April and replace it with a summer show, because the replacement &quot;FBi&quot; had lost even more viewers for the BBC. The show continued until 15 September 2001 after a move to Glasgow where the summer show had normally been filmed. Just before the move it was announced it would be the final series. The principal reason given for the decision was the increasing loss of viewers to &quot;SMTV Live&quot;, which had a similar format and was more successful. &quot;Live and Kicking&quot; was replaced by &quot;The Saturday Show&quot;, fronted by Dani Behr and Joe Mace, which was shown all year round until September 2003 when it began an Autumn-Spring/Summer loop with &quot;Dick and Dom in da Bungalow&quot;.

&quot;Live &amp; Kicking&quot; was featured in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;It Started with Swap Shop&quot; programme in 2006, in which Noel Edmonds interviewed the first pair of presenters, Andi Peters and Emma Forbes, about their time on the show.

==Production==
For the first four series, &quot;Live &amp; Kicking&quot; broadcast from TC 7 at BBC Television Centre however as of Series 5, it moved next door into TC 6 where it gained a larger set due to it being a larger studio. On 14 April 2001, the final show from TC 6 at BBC Television Centre was broadcast before the show moved to &#x27;Studio A&#x27; in BBC Scotland the following week, which at the time, was based on Queen Margaret Drive, Glasgow. It then remained there until the end of its run.

Studio A at Queen Margaret Drive has since been demolished following the BBC&#x27;s move to new studios at Pacific Quay in 2007. Property developer &quot;David Wilson Homes&quot; are currently building new homes called &quot;The Botanics&quot; on the site of the old &quot;Live &amp; Kicking&quot; studio.

Studios TC 6 and TC 7 at BBC Television Centre also suffered a similar fate in 2015 when they too were demolished in the restructure of the building. As such, none of the studios used by &quot;Live &amp; Kicking&quot; exist anymore.

== After Live &amp; Kicking ==
On Friday 16 November 2001, two months after the show had finished, parts of the old &quot;Live &amp; Kicking&quot; set from Series 8 were resurrected and reused as part of BBC Scotland&#x27;s regional studio set for &quot;BBC Children in Need&quot;. In an attempt to disguise the set&#x27;s former use, all traces of &quot;L&amp;K&quot; branding were removed and replaced with &quot;Children In Need&quot; logos and throughout the course of the evening, the old gunge tank, beanbag seating area and performance stage were reused one more time.

In 2004, former presenters Katy Hill and Trey Farley, who had presented the show together in Series 8, went on to marry each other at a register office in Surrey before flying to Tuscany to seal their marriage. They later had two children together- a daughter called &#x27;Kaya Skye&#x27; born in 2006 and a son called &#x27;Akira&#x27; born in 2007.

In 2009, Zoë Ball and Jamie Theakston who had presented the programme together between 1996 and 1999, were reunited to present a new game show for Channel 5 called &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Brain&quot; which ran from 28 October to 16 December 2009.

<doc id="1342114" wikidata="Q333449" url="?curid=1342114" title="William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland">
<text>William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland, PC (Ire), FRS (3 April 174528 May 1814) was a British diplomat and politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1774 to 1793.

==Early life==
A member of the influential Eden family, Auckland was a younger son of Sir Robert Eden, 3rd Baronet, of Windlestone Hall, County Durham, and Mary, daughter of William Davison. His brothers included Sir John Eden, 4th Baronet, also an MP; Sir Robert Eden, 1st Baronet, of Maryland, the last royal Governor of Maryland; and Morton Eden, 1st Baron Henley, diplomat.

He was educated at Durham School, Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, and was called to the bar, Middle Temple, in 1768.

==Career==

In 1771, Auckland published &quot;Principles of Penal Law&quot;, and soon became a recognized authority on commercial and economic questions. In 1772 he took up an appointment as Under-Secretary of State for the North, a post he held until 1778. He was Member of Parliament for Woodstock from 1774 to 1784 and served as a Lord of Trade from 1776 to 1782. 

In 1778, he carried an Act for the improvement of the treatment of prisoners, and accompanied the Earl of Carlisle as a commissioner to North America on an unsuccessful mission to bring an end to the American War of Independence. 

During the War, he was head of the British spies in Europe, his budget reaching £200,000 by 1778. He probably oversaw a small group of intelligence collectors for Lord Suffolk. On his return in 1779 he published his widely-read &quot;Four Letters to the Earl of Carlisle&quot;. 

In 1780, Auckland became Chief Secretary for Ireland, which he remained until 1782, and was admitted to the Irish Privy Council in 1780. He represented Dungannon in the Irish House of Commons between 1781 and 1783 and was Joint Vice-Treasurer of Ireland between 1783 and 1784. While in Ireland he established the National Bank.

Between 1784 and 1793, Auckland was Member of Parliament for Heytesbury. He was sworn of the British Privy Council in 1784 and served as Envoy to France from 1785 to 1787 (on a mission dealing with commerce); he was Ambassador to Spain between 1787 and 1789 and Ambassador to the Netherlands between 1789 and 1793. 

In 1789, he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Auckland and in 1793 he retired from public service, receiving a pension of £2300, and was further honoured when he was made Baron Auckland, of West Auckland in the County of Durham, in the Peerage of Great Britain.

During his retirement in the country at Beckenham, he continued his friendship with William Pitt the Younger, his nearest neighbour at Holwood House, who at one time had thoughts of marrying his daughter (see below). With Pitt&#x27;s sanction he published his &quot;Remarks on the Apparent Circumstances of the War&quot; in 1795, to prepare public opinion for a peace.

He was later included in Pitt&#x27;s government as Joint Postmaster General in 1798. He severely criticized Pitt&#x27;s resignation in 1801, from which he had endeavoured to dissuade him, and retained office under Henry Addington. This terminated his friendship with Pitt, who excluded him from his administration in 1804 though he increased his pension. Auckland later served under Lord Grenville as President of the Board of Trade in the Ministry of All the Talents between 1806 and 1807.

His &quot;Journal and Correspondence&quot;, published in 1861–1862, throws much light on the political history of the time. The subantarctic Auckland Islands group to the south of New Zealand, discovered in 1806, were named after him, as was Eden Quay in Dublin.

==Personal life==

In 1776, Lord Auckland married Eleanor Elliot, daughter of Sir Gilbert Elliot, 3rd Baronet and Agnes Dalrymple-Murray-Kynynmound (daughter and heiress of Hugh Dalrymple-Murray-Kynynmound). Eleanor was a sister of Gilbert Eliott, 1st Earl of Minto. They had six sons and eight daughters, including:

* Eleanor Agnes Eden (1777–1851), who became the subject of intense public interest in 1797 when it was rumoured that she was about to marry the Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger; when the matter became public, however, Pitt denied that he had proposed to Eleanor, much to her father&#x27;s fury. Instead, she married Robert Hobart, 4th Earl of Buckinghamshire in 1799, and Pitt never married.
* Catharine Isabella Eden (1778–1810), who married Nicholas Vansittart, 1st Baron Bexley.
* Elizabeth Charlotte Eden (1780–1847), who married Francis Osborne, 1st Baron Godolphin.
* Caroline Eden (1781–1851), who married Arthur Vansittart (1775–1829) of Shottesbrooke. They were great-grandparents of T. E. Lawrence.
* William Eden (1782–1810), who was Member of Parliament for Woodstock but seemingly committed suicide by drowning in 1810.
* George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland (1784–1849), who died unmarried.
* Henry Eden (1787–1794), who died young.
* Mary Louisa Eden (1788–1858), who married Andrew Colville, who was instrumental in opening up the Red River Colony in Manitoba, Canada to poor Scottish emigrants.
* Mary Dulcibella Eden (1793–1862), who married Charles Drummond (1790–1858), eldest son and heir of banker Charles Drummond (and grandson of William Drummond, 4th Viscount Strathallan) and Frances Dorothy Lockwood (a daughter of Rev. Edward Lockwood of Dews Hall).
* Emily Eden (1797–1869), was a poet and novelist. Her letters were edited by Violet Dickinson and published in 1919.
* Robert Eden, 3rd Baron Auckland (1799–1870), who married Mary Hurt (–1872), the sister of Francis Hurt of Alderwasley Hall.
* Frances Eden (1801–1849)

Lord Auckland died in May 1814 and was succeeded by his second but eldest surviving son, George, who was created Earl of Auckland in 1839. Lady Auckland died in May 1818.

<doc id="1342115" wikidata="Q1553816" url="?curid=1342115" title="Booing">
<text>Booing is an act of publicly showing displeasure for someone or something, such as an entertainer or an athlete, by loudly yelling &quot;Boo!&quot; and sustaining the &quot;oo&quot; sound by holding it out. People may also make hand signs such as the thumbs down sign.

Players booed for their performance felt booing &quot;spooked&quot; or &quot;bothered&quot; them or their teammates, and that it &quot;affected their performance&quot;. Nick Swisher stated &quot;It hurts. Sometimes I&#x27;m a sensitive guy and some of the things people say, they get under your skin a little bit.&quot; Ledley King stated, &quot;It just frustrates me when the crowd boo England, who is that going to help? It just heaps more pressure on the players and gives us even less of a chance of scoring&quot;. However, the counterargument goes that the combination of booing and applause help keep the quality of public performance high, by emotionally rewarding the good and punishing the bad.

Booing is not always a judgement of performance, but can be an expression of disapproval of a third party.

==Sports==

In sports, booing by fans is quite common. They may boo particularly-hated players on the opposing team (such as when they leave their original team to individually sign with another team in free agency, or get traded to said team and sign for a significant amount of money), or any opposing player when there is an intense rivalry between the teams. Unsportsmanlike behavior is also booed, such as intentionally hitting home team batters in baseball or diving in association football or basketball (where it is a technical foul). Booing of referees or umpires after an unpopular ruling is also common. Booing of expelled players after receiving a second yellow card or a direct red card is also common for many reasons. In professional sports, one&#x27;s own home team, players or coach may be booed due to a poor performance or season.

===Examples===

* Baseball Hall of Famer Ted Williams was booed off and on throughout his career; the boos directed to him led Williams (who always had a frosty relationship with the fans) to stop acknowledging the fans early in his career. For the rest of his tenure with the Red Sox, Williams would never again tip his hat to the fans.
* In 1968, fans of the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League infamously booed and threw snowballs at a man dressed as Santa Claus in what became known as the Philadelphia Eagles Santa Claus incident.
* Adam Goodes who played for the Sydney Swans in the Australian Football League was repeatedly and loudly booed by opposition fans during the 2015 AFL season at most of the matches whenever he touched the ball. During a match against Carlton, during the AFL&#x27;s annual Indigenous Round, after he kicked a goal, he celebrated the goal by performing an Aboriginal war dance in which he mimed throwing a spear in their direction. Afterwards, Goodes claimed that the dance was based on the one he learned from the under-16s Indigenous team the Flying Boomerangs, and that it was intended as an expression of indigenous pride during Indigenous Round, not with the intention of offending and intimidating the crowd.
* Brazilian motor racing driver Emerson Fittipaldi was booed when he, after winning the 1993 Indianapolis 500, chose to drink orange juice instead of the milk traditionally drunk by winners of the race. Fittipaldi had made the move in order to promote the Brazilian citrus industry.
* During professional wrestling matches, all heels traditionally receive boos from the audience as the villain. The ability to infuriate audiences and draw &quot;heat&quot; (negative reactions such as boos and jeers) is considered an essential skill for all heel performers.
* NFL fans booed players from the Kansas City Chiefs and Houston Texans prior to the coin toss of their game in the beginning of the 2020 season, as the Houston Texans emerged from the locker room. The Houston Texans had stayed in the locker room during the national anthem in a statement for racial justice. The booing continued as they interlocked arms midfield with the Kansas City Chiefs during what was supposed to be a moment of silence.
*NHL commissioner Gary Bettman is booed whenever he makes an appearance in front of fans, notably at the NHL Entry Draft and at the ceremony to present the Stanley Cup to the league&#x27;s champion.
* At The Game Awards 2015, the audience booed in disapproval at the announcement that Konami legally barred Hideo Kojima from making an appearance. Host Geoff Keighley agreed with the sentiment, saying, &quot;it&#x27;s disappointing and it&#x27;s inconceivable to me that an artist like Hideo would not be allowed to come here and celebrate with his peers and his fellow teammates.&quot;
* In 2019, Toronto Maple Leafs hockey player John Tavares, who formerly played for the New York Islanders, was heavily booed by Islanders fans when he played his first game at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum after signing with the Maple Leafs during the 2018 NHL Free Agency period. Fans booed Tavares during the warm-ups and threw items at him as he headed towards the dressing room at the end of the warm-ups, as well as when a tribute video honoring him was played on the jumbotron, in addition to loudly heckling him throughout the game. Prior to the game, some fans repurposed their old Tavares jerseys and made merchandise with the message &quot;TR91TOR&quot; on it (a reference to Tavares&#x27; jersey number when he was an Islander and the team he signed with during the Free Agency). The Islanders won the game 6–1. The booing and heckling was condemned by many, including by New York Rangers alum Sean Avery, whose team has had a notable intra-city rivalry with the Islanders throughout the years.
* In 2022, Denver Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson, who formerly played for the Seattle Seahawks, was heavily booed by Seahawks fans in his first game back at Lumen Field as a Bronco after being traded to the Broncos from the Seahawks and then signing a five-year contract extension worth $245 million prior to the season beginning, while his back-up (who then became the starter for the Seahawks after his departure), Geno Smith, was cheered and met with chants of &quot;Geno! Geno! Geno!&quot;. Wilson was also booed when he appeared on the jumbotron at WNBA player Sue Bird&#x27;s final home game with the Seattle Storm at Climate Pledge Arena a month before his Broncos debut.
* In 2023, Columbus Blue Jackets hockey player Johnny Gaudreau, who formerly played for the Calgary Flames, was booed heavily by Flames fans when he played his first game at Scotiabank Saddledome as a member of the Blue Jackets after signing with the Blue Jackets during the 2022 NHL Free Agency period. During the free agency period that happened in the summer of 2022, the Flames initially offered Gaudreau an 8-year contract with an AAV of $10.5 million per year, but Gaudreau turned down the Flames’ offer. This would have made Gaudreau, a player who finished the 2022 campaign second in the scoring race with 40 goals and 75 assists for 115 points, one of the highest paid players in the league, as well as the highest paid player in Calgary Flames history, had he accepted the offer. Speculations around the NHL were that Gaudreau, a New Jersey native, would sign with either the Philadelphia Flyers or the New Jersey Devils in order to be not too far away from his hometown should he choose to not remain a Flame. Instead, Gaudreau stunned the hockey community by signing with the Blue Jackets for a lesser amount of time and money — 7 years with a $9.75 million AAV. The move was not well received in Calgary and was even mocked by a local newscaster that summer. During the game, Gaudreau was booed heavily every time he touched the puck, as well as during the warmups. The boos made way for cheers, albeit temporarily, when the Flames played a tribute video to honor him, but the boos returned when play resumed. He also had a penalty shot attempt in that game, where he was also booed, but missed the shot, to the delight of the Flames fans in attendance. The Flames won the game 4–3 in overtime. Gaudreau had two assists in the game for the Blue Jackets.
* In 2025 during the first quarter of Super Bowl LIX, singer Taylor Swift appeared on the VIP seat, as the Philadelphia Eagles fans went booing at her, and Donald Trump mocked her afterwards.

==Politics==

In the Parliament of the United Kingdom, booing is officially not permitted; &quot;Erskine May&quot; states: &quot;Members must not disturb a Member who is speaking by hissing, chanting, clapping, booing, exclamations or other interruption.&quot; Nevertheless, jeering and heckling are somewhat common during Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions.

==The Arts==
Although rare in the performing arts, opera remains one of the arts where booing remains, if not common, customary as merited.

Many composers had their works - now considered core repertoire - booed at their premiere performances. Famously, Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Le Sacre du Printemps&quot; was met with boos (and more) at its 1913 Paris premiere. Gustav Mahler&#x27;s orchestral transcription of part of Beethoven&#x27;s opus 95 string quartet in 1899 was met with so much booing that Mahler reportedly sent two orchestra members into the audience to eject the most vociferous booers. A 1964 performance of John Cage&#x27;s &quot;Atlas eclipitcalis&quot; by the New York Philharmonic under Leonard Bernstein was met with boos, a recording of which exists.

==Popular culture==
Rarer still is for motion pictures to be booed at their openings, and this is usually confined to film festivals when the production team is present.

In traditional British pantomime, the audience is generally encouraged to direct boos and possibly other forms of put-downs towards the antagonist(s), while the protagonist and other positive characters are celebrated.
