<text>Clarence Dillon (born Clarence Lapowski; September 27, 1882 – April 14, 1979) was an American financier, and namesake of Dillon, Read &amp; Co., an investment bank. In 1957, Fortune Magazine listed Dillon as one of the richest men in the United States, with a fortune then estimated to be from $150 to $200 million.

==Early life==
Dillon was born Clarence Lapowski. His parents were Bertha Stenbock (1862–1951) and Samuel Lapowski (1848–1912), who emigrated to the United States. Dillon&#x27;s father was a Polish Jewish immigrant, likely born at Łomża, Poland, in 1848. His paternal grandparents were Joshua Lapowski and Paulina Dylion, the daughter of Michel Dylion, a Frenchman.

In 1878, his father went to San Antonio, Texas, and married Bertha Stenbock one year later. Stenbock was born 1862 in Denver, Colorado, the daughter of Gustav Stenbock, a Swedish immigrant, who was prospecting for lead and silver in the Colorado Western Slope. In 1884, the family moved to Abilene, Texas. They became naturalized citizens in the Abilene District Court, on September 25, 1891, legally changing the family name to Dillon on September 17, 1901. Clarence&#x27;s father died in San Francisco, California, on June 23, 1912, and his mother died in New York City, on January 1, 1951.

Dillon graduated from Worcester Academy, located in Worcester, Massachusetts, and one of the country&#x27;s oldest day-boarding schools, and then Harvard University in 1905.

==Career==

In 1912, Dillon met William A. Read, founder of the Wall Street bond broker firm William A. Read &amp; Company through an introduction by his Harvard classmate, William A. Phillips. Dillon joined Read&#x27;s Chicago office in that year, later moving to the firm&#x27;s New York office in 1914. Following Read&#x27;s death in 1916, Dillon bought a majority interest in the firm and was chosen to head the company. In 1921, the company&#x27;s name was changed to Dillon, Read &amp; Co.

In 1921, Dillon focused on the beleaguered Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company which was in receivership. He succeeded in crafting a settlement with Goodyear&#x27;s bankers, creditors, and stockholders as well as raising more than $100 million in funding in an extremely difficult credit market. In 1925, only four years later, Dillon bought the Dodge Brothers Company for $146 million in cash which was the largest such transaction in industrial history at the time. After the acquisition of Dodge, Dillon merged the company with the Chrysler Corporation in 1927 resulting in Chrysler&#x27;s becoming one of the &quot;big three&quot; in the automobile industry.

A number of Dillon, Read &amp; Co. partners served in senior roles in government, including Dillon and his right-hand man, James Forrestal, who served as Secretary of the Navy, and later, Secretary of Defense. During World War I, Bernard Baruch, chairman of the War Industries Board, (known as the Czar of American Industry) asked Dillon to be Assistant Chairman of the War Industries Board.

===Hobbies===
Dillon was a Francophile both because he had French origins and for his own personal tastes. In 1929, he purchased an apartment in Paris where he stayed a part of each year until he was well into his 80s. An oenophile as well. Dillon negotiated for months to purchase Château Haut-Brion from Bordeaux businessman André Gibert who had controlled the French wine producer since 1923. Dillon ultimately made the acquisition on May 13, 1935, for 2,300,000 francs. Dillon made Seymour Weller, who was the son of his wife&#x27;s sister, president of the new company, Société Vinicole de la Gironde, (later Domaine Clarence Dillon). Weller retired as president of the company in 1975. Dillon is said to have purchased Château Haut-Brion because it was his favorite wine. However Haut-Brion is also near Bordeaux, and good riding and hunting land surrounds the estate.

Clarence purchased miniature poodle show dog Fontclair Festoon from Dody Jenkins. This dog would go on to win best-in-show at the Westminster Kennel Club in 1959. The dog was handled by Anne Rogers Clark.

==Personal life==

On February 4, 1908, Dillon married Anne McEldin Douglass (1881–1961) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Anne was the daughter of George Douglass and his wife and second cousin Susan Virginia Dun. Together, Clarence and Anne were the parents of a son and daughter:

* Clarence Douglass Dillon (1909–2003), who served as the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury from 1961 to 1965 and the U.S. Ambassador to France. He married Phyllis Chess Ellsworth in 1931. After her death in 1982, he married Susan Sage in 1983. They remained married until his death in 2003.
* Dorothy Anne Dillon (1913–2005), who married Philip Elsworth Allen in 1934. After their divorce, she married Dr. Sydney Shepherd Spivack (1907–1969), a sociologist, in 1965. After his death in 1969, she married Eric Eweson in 1976, who died in 1988.

Dillon died on April 14, 1979, at his home in Far Hills, New Jersey.

<text>John Linwood Fox (April 2, 1907 – April 6, 1954), better known as Tiger Jack Fox was an American light heavyweight boxer, who fought from 1928 to 1950.

==Boxing career==
Fox claimed he got his start in boxing when he was picked up while hitchhiking in Georgia by boxer Young Stribling. At that time, Stribling was travelling from town to town and engaging in boxing matches, and Fox took a job as a sparring partner.

In their first sparring session, Stribling knocked Fox out with a right hand to the jaw. Fox claimed he didn&#x27;t sleep that night, reliving the events of the day and studying how to avoid a similar fate the next day. The next day, the two sparred again. Fox won the fight, and was fired as a sparring partner.

Fox then moved to Indianapolis, where he hung around a boxing gym until he was offered a fight. Fox accepted and was on his way. He relocated to Terre Haute, Indiana to train under Bud Taylor and became the &quot;Indiana colored heavyweight champion&quot;. He fought frequently for the next nine years without losing. His first loss was to Maxie Rosenbloom. Fox claimed he engaged in over 300 fights, but many were not recorded. He claimed that he had never fought a preliminary bout in his career, just main events.

Fox was defeated by Melio Bettina in his only crack at the light heavyweight championship, New York States Athletic Commission version. In this elimination bout to name a champion, Fox was stopped in the 9th round. Two months before the fight, he was stabbed near the heart in a Harlem hotel in a dispute over a woman.

Fox also fought and knocked out Bob Olin in two rounds, and he knocked out Lou Brouillard in seven. He was knocked out in three rounds by John Henry Lewis.

Fox also won against Jersey Joe Walcott on May 12, 1937, knocking him out in the 8th round. In 1938, Fox again defeated Walcott, this time in the 10th round.

Fox is second on the all-time list for first-round knockouts, and was named to &quot;The Ring&quot;&#x27;s list of 100 greatest punchers of all time.

Fox was posthumously inducted into the International Boxing Hall Of Fame in 2023, almost 70 years after his untimely death in the associations &quot;Old Timers&quot; category.

<doc id="1342924" wikidata="Q5321966" url="?curid=1342924" title="E. J. Pipkin">
<text>Edward Joseph Pipkin Jr. (born November 1, 1956) is an American activist, politician, and Republican former member of the Maryland State Senate, had represented Maryland&#x27;s 36th Senate district, and was first elected in 2002 and served until 2013. Prior to his election to the state senate, he worked in the field of business finance, trading bonds in New York City. He also founded an environmental group known as &quot;Citizens Against Bay Dumping,&quot; during which he was successful in lobbying for legislation that banned irresponsible disposal of dredge spoils in the Chesapeake Bay. Pipkin currently lives in Dallas. In 2004, he unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate against Barbara Mikulski. Then, in 2008, he unsuccessfully ran for Congress in Maryland&#x27;s 1st congressional district, against incumbent Wayne Gilchrest and State Senator Andy Harris, losing the primary to Andy Harris. On August 5, 2013, Pipkin announced he would retire from the State Senate to attend graduate school.

==Early life==
Pipkin grew up in Dundalk, Maryland, and went to Dundalk High School. He initially attended Salisbury University, but ultimately received his B.A. from Roanoke College. He received an M.B.A. from the University of Virginia.

==Personal life==
Pipkin has three children: Carter, Meredith and Tyler.

==State Senate==
Pipkin was elected to the State Senate in 2002 after defeating Democrat Walter M. Baker, who held that seat since 1979 and the chairman of the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee. Baker was the only state senator to vote against Pipkin&#x27;s efforts to ban open bay dumping. Pipkin defeated Baker by 24 percentage points.

Since his arrival to the Senate, Pipkin has authored legislation that include creating a task force to bring broadband internet to his eastern shore constituents; creating a committee that will ensure responsible handling of taxpayer dollars by the state government; and advocating for an elected school board in Cecil County to increase public involvement in public schools.

Pipkin was re-elected in 2006 with 63.7% of the vote, and re-elected again in 2010.

On August 5, 2013, Pipkin announced that he would retire from the State Senate, effective the following week, to pursue a graduate degree in sports management at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas.

==U.S. Senate campaign==
In the 2004 U.S. Senate election, Pipkin ran unsuccessfully against incumbent Democratic senator Barbara Mikulski.

He ran a series of ads during the campaign with his self-coined slogan &quot;who knew&quot; that attacked Mikulski&#x27;s policies. This led Mikulski, who was already considered a favorite, to hold a debate with Pipkin.

==Voting record==
In 2003, Pipkin sponsored a bill to return a tax credit to employers who provide daycare for their employees. In 2004, he sponsored a permanent repeal of the estate tax in Maryland. In 2006, Pipkin sponsored a reduction in state property taxes and a reduction in income taxes.

==Chesapeake Bay Bridge==
As a resident of Stevensville, Pipkin himself has been affected by traffic congestion on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, and has fought to reduce the problem. In 2005, he proposed a set of bills, which ultimately failed to pass, in that year&#x27;s Maryland General Assembly session, known as the &quot;Bay Bridge Users&#x27; Bill of Rights&quot;. The bills would have, among other things, made various modifications to the governing board of the Maryland Transportation Authority (MdTA), banned trucks from the bridge when one of its dual spans is carrying two-way traffic, and waived tolls whenever backups extended beyond a certain point.
Later that year, Pipkin was one of the 22 citizens appointed by Governor Robert Ehrlich to serve on the Bay Bridge Task Force, to explore the possibility of building a new crossing of the Chesapeake Bay.

In the 2006 Maryland General Assembly session, Pipkin once again tried to pass parts of the Bay Bridge Users&#x27; Bill of Rights, this time more successfully. Among the bills that passed that year included one that made various modifications to the governing board of the MdTA (e.g. addition of two appointed members; imposition of three term limit of service; lengthening of terms to four years, rather than three years; etc.).
Along with Delegate Mary Roe Walkup (R-Dist. 36), Pipkin also proposed a bill to remove the Baltimore County-Kent County crossing from the list of crossing locations that could potentially be studied in the future).
However, that bill did not pass (nor did it pass when re-introduced in 2007).
Also during 2006, Pipkin worked collaboratively with MdTA to promote successful legislation (Senate Bill 168, signed into law as Chapter 24 of 2007 of the Laws of Maryland) that doubled the amount of violations fines that could be issued for overweight tractor-trailers crossing the bridge.

<text>Karl Kalman Targownik (June 17, 1915 – January 2, 1996) was a psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor.

Dr. Karl Targownik was born in Budapest, Hungary. His parents were Polish Jews who fled to Hungary to escape the Russian invasion during World War I. Soon after the War was over they returned to Poland and settled in the small village of Bochnia, located in the Southwest of Poland near Kraków. While studying in Poland to become a medical doctor, Targownik was captured and sent to a concentration camp. For a period of time, Targownik was a prisoner at the infamous Auschwitz camp. At 29 years old and a mere 80 pounds (36 kg), Targownik was liberated on April 29, 1945 from the Dachau camp.

Soon after liberation, Targownik obtained his medical degree and practiced in New York City. In 1952, Targownik moved to Topeka, Kansas, to work at the Menninger Clinic, a popular treatment center for the mentally ill. He developed a friendship with Karl Menninger, and soon rose through the ranks to become one of the institution&#x27;s top psychiatrists. Targownik frequently spoke to groups about his Holocaust experience, and gained recognition throughout the state of Kansas and much of the Midwest. He was named Kansan of the Year in 1976 by the newspaper of Topeka, Kansas.

Dr. Targownik worked and led the Kansas Reception &amp; Diagnostic Center, a State Prison outside of Topeka. It was one of the few remaining institutions for new, incoming state prisoners, where they could be evaluated medically, psychologically and educationally. A team of clinicians would then recommend the level of placement in the state prison system.
This Reception &amp; Diagnostic concept followed from Dr. Karl Menninger&#x27;s philosophy of criminal rehabilitation, as written about in his book, &quot;The Crime of Punishment&quot;

Targownik continued to speak and give interviews through the end of his life, which was complicated by Alzheimer&#x27;s and Parkinson&#x27;s diseases. He died at 80 on January 2, 1996, at his Topeka home.

<text>Château Haut-Brion () is a French wine estate of Bordeaux wine, rated a &quot;Premier Grand Cru Classé&quot; (First Growth), located in Pessac just outside the city of Bordeaux. It differs from the other wines on the list in its geographic location in the north of the wine-growing region of Graves. Of the five first growths, it is the only wine with the Pessac-Léognan appellation and is in some sense the ancestor of a classification that remains the benchmark to this day.

In addition to the &quot;grand vin&quot; (LWIN 1011247), Haut-Brion produces a red second wine. Formerly named Château Bahans Haut-Brion, beginning with the 2007 vintage, it was renamed Le Clarence de Haut Brion (LWIN 1008153). The vineyard also produces a dry white wine named Château Haut-Brion Blanc (LWIN 1017092), with a limited release of the second dry white wine, Les Plantiers du Haut-Brion, renamed La Clarté de Haut-Brion for the 2008 vintage.

==History==
Although grapes are thought to have been grown on the property since Roman times, the earliest document indicating cultivation of a parcel of land dates from 1423. The property was bought by Jean de Ségur in 1509, and in 1525 was owned by Admiral Philippe de Chabot.

The estate Château Haut-Brion dates back to April 1525 when Jean de Pontac married Jeanne de Bellon, the daughter of the mayor of Libourne and &quot;seigneur&quot; of Hault-Brion, who brought the land in her dowry. In 1533 bought the title to the domain of Haut-Brion, while construction of the château was begun in 1549.

1649, Lord Arnaud III de Pontac became owner of Haut-Brion, and the wine&#x27;s growing popularity began in earnest. The first records of Haut-Brion wine were found in the wine cellar ledger of the English King Charles II in 1660. During the years 1660 and 1661, 169 bottles of the &quot;wine of Hobriono&quot; were served at the king&#x27;s court. Charles Ludington states: &quot;The re-establishment of a royal court and of court culture generally required an increase in luxury goods. This demand inspired Pontac to launch the prototype of top-growth claret in London. The wine was called Haut-Brion, after the name of the estate from which it came.&quot;

Samuel Pepys wrote in his diary, having tasted the wine at Royal Oak Tavern on April 10, 1663, that he had &quot;[drunk] a sort of French wine called Ho Bryen that hath a good and most particular taste I never met with&quot;. Pepys provided what Prof. Ludington called &quot;the first tasting note of Haut-Brion&quot;.

Therefore both Charles II&#x27;s cellar book and Pepys&#x27; note &quot;provide the first mention in any language of estate-named claret and are among the many proofs that Haut-Brion was created specifically for the English market.&quot; Pontac went even further in developing the renown of his wine: &quot;By improving and &quot;branding&quot; a product, [...] he created and named a wine that came from a small, circumscribed area of land for the purpose of enhancing its value in the minds and on the palates of discerning English customers.&quot;

The original diary of Pepys is held in the Pepys Library at Magdalene College, Cambridge while the 1660 Cellar Book of King Charles II is held by the British National Archives. In 1927, writer Dorothy L. Sayers, in her novel &quot;Unnatural Death&quot;, had detective Lord Peter Wimsey joke about Pepys Anglicizing the wine&#x27;s name (&quot; . . . a bottle of what Pepys calls Ho Bryon&quot;). In April 2013, the Magdalene College, Cambridge, displayed the Pepys Diary opened at the page of the Haut-Brion mention for the 350th Anniversary of this historical mention. Dr Jane Hughes lectured on Pepys and wine before the gala dinner hosted by the Cambridge University Wine Society and featuring tributes to Pepys. Prince Robert of Luxembourg then challenged wine historians and amateurs to find a new reference to Haut-Brion in history prior to 1660.

In 1666, after &quot;The Great Fire&quot;, the son François-Auguste, opened a tavern in London called &quot;L&#x27;Enseigne de Pontac&quot;, or the &quot;Sign of Pontac&#x27;s Head&quot;, which was according to André Simon, London&#x27;s first fashionable eating-house. Jonathan Swift &quot;found the wine dear at seven shillings a flagon&quot;.

By the end of the 17th century the estate amounted to of which some were under vine. The wine was often sold under the name Pontac, though since the Pontac family owned numerous wine estates that could use the name, it is often impossible to tell when a wine came from Haut-Brion. Sometimes also spelled Pontack, another Pontac estate at Blanquefort which produced white wine would also often go by this name.

English philosopher John Locke, visiting Bordeaux in 1677, spoke of Haut-Brion, &quot;...The wine of Pontac, so revered in England, is made on a little rise of ground, lieing[sic] open most to the west. It is noe thing but pure white sand, mixed with a little gravel. One would imagin it scarce fit to beare anything..&quot; On the cause of its increasing costliness, he stated, &quot;thanks to the rich English who sent orders that it was to be got for them at any price&quot;. The German philosopher Hegel was also enchanted with the wine of Pontac, though it is unknown if his orders were for other de Pontac wines of Saint-Estèphe.

With the death of François-Auguste de Pontac, François-Joseph de Fumel, a nephew by marriage, inherited two-thirds of Haut-Brion with a third coming to Louis-Arnaud Le Comte, Lord Captal of Latresne. The de Fumel family also at one point owned Château Margaux.

In 1787, Thomas Jefferson, then American minister to France, came to Bordeaux. On May 25 he visited to Haut-Brion, describing the &quot;terroir&quot;, &quot;The soil of Haut-Brion, which I examined in great detail, is made up of sand, in which there is near as much round gravel or small stone and a very little loam like the soils of the Médoc&quot;. His notes placed Haut-Brion among the four estates of first quality, with the entry, &quot;3. Haut-Brion, two-thirds of which belong to the Count de Fumel who sold the harvest to a merchant called Barton. The other third belongs to the Count of Toulouse; in all, the château produces 75 barrels.&quot; Haut-Brion became the first recorded first growth wine to be imported to the United States, when Jefferson purchased six cases during the travels and had them sent back to his estate in Virginia., as stated in his letter to his brother-in-law Francis Eppes on May 26, 1787: &quot;(...) I cannot deny myself the pleasure of asking you to participate of a parcel of wine I have been chusing for myself. I do it the rather as it will furnish you a specimen of what is the very best Bourdeaux wine. It is of the vineyard of Obrion, one of the four established as the very best, and it is of the vintage of 1784 (...).&quot;

As a consequence of the French Revolution, in July 1794 Joseph de Fumel was guillotined, and his holdings were divided. Posthumously, de Fumel&#x27;s nephews obtained a pardon for him as well as the restitution of the confiscated property, but they left France. In 1801, they sold Haut-Brion to Talleyrand, Prince of Benevento, owner of Haut-Brion for three years.

A less prosperous period followed between 1804 and 1836 under successive ownership of various businessmen, until Joseph-Eugène Larrieu bought Haut-Brion when it was sold by auction. In 1841, by buying the Chai-Neuf building from the Marquis de Catellan, he brought the estate back to the former size of the estate up until the death of François-Auguste de Pontac in 1694. Larrieu&#x27;s family owned Haut-Brion until 1923.

In the classifications of 1855 ahead of the International Exhibition in Paris, Château Haut-Brion was classified &quot;Premier Grand Cru&quot;, as the only estate from Graves among the three established First Growths of the Médoc. The prices of Haut-Brion in the 19th century were consistently higher than those of any other Bordeaux wine. This trend has continued into the present day, with the price of the estate&#x27;s &quot;grand vin&quot; averaging $571.

===Modern history===

After a series of unsuccessful owners during difficult times, the American banker Clarence Dillon bought Château Haut-Brion on May 13, 1935 for ₣2,300,000. Several unverified anecdotes surround the acquisition, as Dillon was believed to also consider buying châteaux Cheval Blanc, Ausone or a majority share in Margaux, but did not care to make the trip on a rainy, chilly day, and chose Haut-Brion for its proximity to Bordeaux and riding facilities. One account claims Dillon never got out of the car.

Dillon made his nephew Seymour Weller president of the new company &quot;Société Vinicole de la Gironde&quot; (later Domaine Clarence Dillon S.A.S.), who held the position for five decades. Weller restored the park, cleaned the chais, and installed electricity along with new vinification equipment. He retained Georges Delmas, the &quot;régisseur&quot; and director of Haut-Brion since 1921, and former manager of Cos d&#x27;Estournel.

Haut-Brion first began using its distinctive bottle, emulating designs of old decanter models, from the 1958 vintage which was released in 1960.

Georges Delmas retired in 1961, and was succeeded by his son Jean-Bernard Delmas, born at the estate, instigating a number of renovations. In the 1960s, Haut-Brion was the first of the great growths to innovate with new stainless steel fermentation vats. Clonal selection research was begun in 1972, in collaboration with INRA and the Chambre d&#x27;Agriculture. Insisting that great wine cannot be made with only one clone, Jean-Bernard Delmas has stated, &quot;You need an assemblage of excellent clones&quot;, adding, &quot;We know where each plant is located&quot;. At Haut-Brion, each hectare contains 10 to 15 different clonal selections.

in 1975, at the age of 83, Seymour Weller retired as President of the company. His cousin&#x27;s daughter (and granddaughter of Clarence Dillon) Joan Dillon, then Princesse Charles de Luxembourg and later Duchesse de Mouchy, replaced him. In 1976, the 1970 vintage of Haut-Brion ranked fourth among the ten French and California red wines in the historic &quot;Judgment of Paris&quot; wine competition.

The fierce competition that had existed between Haut-Brion and Château La Mission Haut-Brion over several years, which rose to a peak in the 1970s and early 1980s, ended when Domaine Clarence Dillon acquired La Mission in 1983.

From the 2007 vintage, in connection with the 75th anniversary of Dillon family ownership, the red second wine Château Bahans Haut-Brion was released under the new name Le Clarence de Haut-Brion. The name Château Bahans Haut-Brion had been in use for at least a century, and over a period it was sold without a declared vintage. Starting with the 2009 vintage, the white second wine Les Plantiers du Haut-Brion was renamed La Clarté de Haut-Brion.

Manager Jean-Bernard Delmas retired in 2003, and was succeeded by his son Jean-Philippe Delmas. Prince Robert of Luxembourg (son of Prince Charles of Luxembourg) who has acted as an administrator at Haut-Brion since the age of 18, became in 2008 Président Directeur Général of Domaine Clarence Dillon.

==Production==

Château Haut-Brion devotes to red grape varieties, with a distribution of 45.4% Merlot, 43.9% Cabernet Sauvignon, 9.7% Cabernet Franc and 1% Petit Verdot, and to white grape varieties, distributed with 52.6% Sémillon and 47.4% Sauvignon blanc.

The vineyards are elevated, up to 27 meters, somewhat above the Bordeaux norm. The soil consists of Günzian gravel and some parcels have high contents of clay. All the vineyards are located in a cluster near the château itself and on the other side of the main road.

The selection of optimum rootstocks and clones has been a large task at Château Haut-Brion, pioneered by Jean-Bernard Delmas, which has greatly contributed to the quality of the plant material in the vineyard. The long-term aim has been to lower yields, not by green-harvesting but by ensuring healthy and balanced vines. The average age of the vines is approximately 35 years with the oldest parcels dating back to the 1930s, planted with an average vine density of 8000 vines/ha.

Harvesting takes place by hand and each parcel is worked by the same team of workers to increase the teams&#x27; familiarity with the individual vines. The harvest of the white grapes takes place very early due to the proximity to the city of Bordeaux which results in a warmer microclimate and thus earlier ripening. The red grapes are picked as late as possible, sorted and then pneumatically pressed in whole bunches. There is no skin contact and fermentation takes place in oak barrels with indigenous yeast. After sorting in the field, the red grapes are destemmed, crushed and moved to a special double-tank with fermentation taking place in the top and malolactic fermentation in the bottom, using gravity to move the wine. Previously ageing took place in 100% new oak casks lasting 18 months. This has been reduced to 35% new casks and wine destined for the second wine Le Clarence is aged in 25% new oak. The white wine is aged in 40-45% new oak for 10–12 months. Château Haut-Brion has its own cooperage.

The annual production ranges from of the red &quot;grand vin&quot; Château Haut-Brion, and from of Château Haut-Brion Blanc. Of the second wines, the red Le Clarence de Haut-Brion previously named Château Bahans Haut-Brion, has a production of , and the white La Clarté de Haut-Brion, previously named Les Plantiers du Haut-Brion, has a production of .

<text>Light heavyweight is a weight class in combat sports.

==Boxing==

===Professional===
In professional boxing, the division is above and up to , falling between super middleweight and cruiserweight.

The light heavyweight class has produced some of boxing&#x27;s greatest champions: Bernard Hopkins (who, upon becoming champion, broke the record for oldest man to win a world title), Tommy Loughran, Billy Conn, Joey Maxim, Archie Moore, Michael Moorer, Bob Foster, Ann Wolfe, Michael Spinks, Dariusz Michalczewski, Roy Jones Jr., Sergey Kovalev and Zsolt Erdei.

Many light heavyweight champions unsuccessfully challenged for the heavyweight crown until Michael Spinks became the first reigning light heavyweight champion to win the heavyweight championship. Bob Fitzsimmons captured the light heavyweight championship after losing his heavyweight championship. Two all-time great heavyweight champions, Ezzard Charles and Floyd Patterson, started out as light heavyweights. Charles defeated Archie Moore and Joey Maxim several times in non-title bouts before becoming heavyweight champion and Patterson lost an eight-round decision to Joey Maxim before becoming heavyweight champion himself. Evander Holyfield successfully moved up from the light heavyweight division to the cruiserweight division and eventually the heavyweight division and became undisputed champion of the latter two.

<text>The State Fair of West Virginia is an annual state fair for West Virginia, United States. It is held annually in mid-August on the State Fairgrounds in Lewisburg. This year&#x27;s State Fair is scheduled for 8-17 August 2024. The State Fairgrounds consists of a large open park for carnivals and exhibition, grandstands, and several exhibition buildings. Free parking is provided adjacent to the fairgrounds.

Over the years the following concerts have been held at the grandstand:

• Conway Twitty
• Loretta Lynn
• George Jones
• Merle Haggard
• Johnny Cash
• Lorrie Morgan
• Little Big Town
• Britney Spears
• Big Time Rush
• Victoria Justice
• Tammy Wynette
• Travis Tritt

At the 2019 State Fair Alabama was scheduled to perform but Randy Owen became ill. 
Jamey Johnson filled in for Alabama.

==History==

The first event to be called the State Fair occurred in Wheeling on February 1, 1881. The Lewisburg fair evolved from local events that date back to 1854. World War I caused the 1917 &amp; 1918 fairs to be cancelled. In 1941 the state government declared it to be the official State Fair. However, World War II forced cancellation of the event until 1946. The Meadow River Lumber Building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. There was also no fair in 2020.

==Current activities==
By the standards of large states with a more agricultural economies, the West Virginia event is relatively small. It lasts over eight days. It features a traveling carnival with various rides, competitive exhibitions by farmers and 4-H and FFA members, harness racing (no gambling is currently allowed), exhibitions by manufacturers of farm machinery and industrial tools, and a nightly concert performed by popular artists. Higher stakes Bingo is conducted at the fair than is normally permitted under state law. A beauty queen is selected. In political years, elaborate displays by candidates and political parties are also a part of the fair. 
Midway Rides are provided by the Orange unit of Reithoffer Shows. 

The 2006 fair generated 174,438 paid admissions, which was the highest number since 2002; that year, security screens were set up at the gates. Adding children under five (who are admitted free) and various other complementary admissions brings the estimated attendance to 210,000. Prior to the completion of Interstate 64 in 1988 the fairground was difficult to access from most of the state and the event was much more local in nature. However, it has grown greatly since that time.

The Fair is a non-profit organization under section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Although the Fair does not release its financial statements to the public, managers claim that it operates on a &quot;small margin.&quot; According to a 2006 report commissioned by the Fair, it has an annual economic impact of $8.9 million on Greenbrier County.

The Fair receives no appropriation from the state, supporting itself from admissions, fees charged to vendors, and rental of the fairgrounds to other groups. It does receive support in kind from the state Department of Agriculture and from West Virginia University.

<doc id="1342939" wikidata="Q3244583" url="?curid=1342939" title="List of extreme points of India">
<text>The extreme points of India include the coordinates that are further north, south, east or west than any other location in India; and the highest and the lowest altitudes in the country. The northernmost point claimed by India is in territory disputed between India and Pakistan, and administered partially by both. With the exception of Kanyakumari, the southernmost location of mainland India, all other extreme locations are uninhabited.

The latitude and longitude are expressed in decimal degree notation, in which a positive latitude value refers to the northern hemisphere, and a negative value refers to the southern hemisphere. Similarly, a positive longitude value refers to the eastern hemisphere, and a negative value refers to the western hemisphere. The coordinates used in this article are sourced from Google Earth, which makes use of the WGS84 geodetic reference system. Additionally, a negative altitude value refers to land below sea level.

==Extreme points==
The northernmost point claimed by India lies in the Pakistani-administered territory of Gilgit-Baltistan, which India claims as a part of the union territory of Ladakh. The northernmost point administered by India lies in the union territory of Ladakh, which is claimed by Pakistan as a part of the autonomous territory of Azad Kashmir. This list provides the northernmost point as claimed by India; the northernmost disputed point that is administered by India; and the northernmost undisputed point in India. This case also applies to the highest elevated regions.

India&#x27;s easternmost state is Arunachal Pradesh. Part of the state is claimed by China as part of Tibet Autonomous Region, though administered by India, The easternmost of Indian-administered territory is located in this disputed region. Consequently, this list mentions both the disputed and undisputed easternmost points in India. 

All astronomical calculations are performed with respect to a Central Station at longitude 82°30’ East, latitude 23°11’ North.

<doc id="1342945" wikidata="Q420463" url="?curid=1342945" title="Nasonov pheromone">
<text>The Nasonov (alternatively, Nasanov) pheromone is released by worker bees to orient returning forager bees back to the colony. To broadcast this scent, bees raise their abdomens, which contain the Nasonov glands, and fan their wings vigorously. 

Nasonov includes a number of different terpenoids including geraniol, nerolic acid, citral and geranic acid. Bees use these to find the entrance to their colony or hive, and they release them on flowers so other bees know which flowers have nectar. Once the foraging bee leaves the nest it uses its sense from special sensing cells on the antennae to locate and distinguish forage plants, which each give off a unique blend of odour chemicals. When a beekeeper lifts out frames from a hive they disturb the balance of smells within the hive. It can take up to 48 hours for the colony to re-establish its scent equilibrium.

A synthetically produced Nasonov pheromone can be used to attract a honey bee swarm to an unoccupied hive or a swarm-catching box. Synthetically produced Nasonov consists of citral and geraniol in a 2:1 ratio.

The Nasonov gland was first described in 1882 by the Russian zoologist Nikolai Viktorovich Nasonov. Nasonov thought that the gland performed perspiration; it was Frederick William Lambert Sladen (May 30, 1876 - 1921) of England who in 1901 first proposed that the gland produced a pheromone.

<text>That Yellow Bastard is a six-issue comic book limited series and the sixth in the &quot;Sin City&quot; series. It was published by Dark Horse Comics in February–July 1996. It follows the usual black and white noir style artistry of previous Sin City novels, with the exception of yellow on Roark Junior late in the story.

It is one of the comics adapted into the &quot;Sin City&quot; film.

==Plot==

The story begins more than eight years before any other Sin City book takes place, with policeman John Hartigan on his final mission before his forced retirement (he suffers from severe angina). Roark Junior, son of one of the most powerful and corrupt officials in Basin City, is indulging his penchant for raping and murdering pre-pubescent girls. It is Hartigan&#x27;s mission to rescue Junior&#x27;s latest quarry, an 11-year-old named Nancy Callahan.

Hartigan succeeds in rescuing Nancy by disabling Junior&#x27;s getaway car, which was being guarded by Burt Schlubb and Douglas Klump, two guns-for-hire with &quot;delusions of eloquence&quot;. Hartigan knocks them out and kills the twin guards Benny and Lenny. He chases the escaping Junior to the pier and then proceeds to use his revolver to surgically shoot off Junior&#x27;s left ear, right hand, and genitals. Before he can finish Junior off, Hartigan&#x27;s corrupt partner Bob, who fears angering Senator Roark, shoots Hartigan several times. Hartigan then stalls Bob for as long as he can to save Nancy when backup arrives, going so far as to pull a spare gun and have Bob unload his gun on him. Bob leaves the fallen Hartigan, who passes out with Nancy in his arms.

Roark Jr. lapses into a coma from his injuries, and Senator Roark takes issue with the abuse of his son. Hartigan survives and recovers thanks to the senator, who wants Hartigan to suffer for the rest of his life. He is framed for raping Nancy, branded as a pedophile and sentenced to a lengthy prison term amid a public outcry that brands him one of Sin City&#x27;s most hated citizens. He remains silent about his pain, knowing that Senator Roark would execute anyone who ever found out the truth. The only one to whom Hartigan speaks in the hospital is Nancy, who sneaks out against her parents&#x27; wishes to see the man who saved her. Hartigan tells her to stay away from him, so Nancy tells Hartigan she will write him letters instead. She will sign her name as &quot;Cordelia&quot; to hide her identity. Before leaving, Nancy tells Hartigan she loves him.

After his stint in the hospital, Hartigan is seen tied to a chair, cuffed and being beaten by Det. Liebowitz in order to force him to sign a false confession. Amid the hours of repeated punching and being tempted by prison luxuries and even sex with an Old Town prostitute, Hartigan doesn&#x27;t crack under the pressure, although he hallucinates that he is granted the strength of Hercules, breaks from his cuffs and kills Liebowitz by exploding his head.

Afterwards, alone in prison and abandoned by his wife Eileen (who remarries and finally has children) and his friends, he finds solace in the carefully disguised weekly letters he receives from Nancy. Hartigan quickly develops a paternal love for young Nancy, and sees her as the daughter he never had. For eight years, he drags himself through his jail time, his only respite the letters his young admirer sends him, until finally the letters stop coming. Although he initially believes Nancy has merely outgrown her childhood hero, Hartigan soon becomes increasingly worried that Senator Roark has finally found her. His fears are confirmed when a deformed, hairless visitor with sickly yellow skin who smells distinctly like garbage arrives at his prison cell and punches him out. Hartigan awakens and discovers the same type of envelope Nancy always uses containing an index finger from the right hand of a 19-year-old girl.
Believing Nancy to be in imminent danger, Hartigan decides to find some way out, and contacts his lawyer, Lucille (the lesbian parole officer from &quot;The Hard Goodbye&quot;). Much to her surprise and disgust, Hartigan decides to claim responsibility to the crimes of which he was accused. At his parole hearing, he is humiliated again when Senator Roark piously offers to forgive him. Hartigan knows it&#x27;s a ruse to insult him, but asks Senator Roark for forgiveness in order to win parole. Hartigan is finally released, apparently due to Senator Roark&#x27;s satisfaction over his confession and submission.

Back on the streets, the now 60-year-old Hartigan sets off to find Nancy. He goes to her apartment, but finds it empty and in disarray. The only clue to her whereabouts is a pack of matches from Kadie&#x27;s bar. Following the lead, Hartigan discovers that she is now a woman who works in the club as an exotic dancer - and is unharmed. The envelope containing the finger was merely a ploy to lead Roark to Nancy. Hartigan smells a set-up, and something far worse: the distinct odor of rotting garbage. &quot;That Yellow Bastard&quot;, the man who arrived at the cell with the envelope, has followed him and found Nancy.

Nancy recognizes Hartigan and jumps into his arms, kissing him. They leave Kadie&#x27;s and get into her car. There is a high-speed pursuit, with the &quot;Bastard&quot; close on their tail, Hartigan uses Nancy&#x27;s revolver to fire a precise shot that hits the &quot;Bastard&quot; in the neck. Hartigan insists on stopping to confirm the kill; accompanied by Nancy, he discovers the &quot;Bastard&#x27;s&quot; foul-smelling blood everywhere, but no body. Eventually, he and Nancy hide out in a motel. There, they share a kiss, where Nancy reveals she is in love with him; but Hartigan refuses to move any further because of his age and the paternalistic nature of his relationship to Nancy. Unknown to them, the &quot;Bastard&quot; has hidden in the backseat of Nancy&#x27;s car, and he emerges while they talk.

Hartigan, in the shower, is ambushed once again by &quot;That Yellow Bastard&quot;, who reveals himself to be none other than Roark Junior. Senator Roark used his vast financial resources to resurrect his son using new medical techniques to re-grow his severed body parts. As a result, Junior lives, but with some &quot;side-effects&quot;. Junior knocks Hartigan down, attempts to hang him naked with a noose, and boasts of raping and killing dozens of girls over the past eight years. He then taunts Hartigan with the promise that Nancy will suffer the same fate. Roark Jr. kicks the desk out from under Hartigan and escapes with Nancy.
At first, Hartigan resigns himself to death but, in a sudden bout of determination, he revives himself through sheer will, breaks a window and cuts his hands free with a glass shard. Schlubb and Klump arrive to dispose of Hartigan&#x27;s body, but Hartigan subdues them and forces them to reveal Junior and Nancy&#x27;s whereabouts. He learns that Junior has fled to the Roark Family Farm (described as &quot;a place where bad things happen&quot;).

Racing to the Farm, Hartigan suffers a severe angina attack, but soldiers through the pain. Meanwhile, Nancy is being flogged by Junior but, like Hartigan, resists the urge to scream in order to deny her torturer the satisfaction; she then realizes that Junior is impotent unless he hears his victims scream. Hartigan takes down four other corrupt police officers guarding the Farm and confronts Junior, who by that time has Nancy at knife point. Hartigan fakes a heart attack to catch Junior off guard. He stabs Junior, castrates him (this time with his bare hands), and beats him to death. Nancy and Hartigan share another, more passionate, kiss, and Hartigan tells Nancy to flee, assuring her that he will call up some old police friends of his to clean up the scene of the crime.

After Nancy leaves, Hartigan narrates that he had to lie to her in order to protect her; Senator Roark will want to punish Hartigan for killing his son, and would not hesitate to use Nancy in order to do so. Knowing full well that no sane attorney would try to prosecute Senator Roark, Hartigan realizes that there is only one way to end the entire ordeal. In an act of pure love and sacrifice, Hartigan shoots himself in the head to save Nancy and end Roark&#x27;s vendetta. 
==Collected editions==
It was first collected as a trade paperback in July 1997 () which was republished in 2005 (). In 1997 Titan Books released a hardcover edition (). Noticeably, it is the first Sin City trade paperback to include color in the story.

==Awards==
*1998: Won &quot;Best Graphic Album-Reprint&quot; Eisner Award

==Film adaptation==

In the film adaptation, Bruce Willis stars as Hartigan, Jessica Alba as Nancy, Nick Stahl as the Yellow Bastard/Junior, Powers Boothe as Senator Roark and Michael Madsen as Hartigan&#x27;s partner, Bob. There are only a few notable differences in the film version: Mort is replaced by Bob when Hartigan is released from prison, and an appearance by Carla Gugino as Lucille is omitted (but reinstated in the extended version released to DVD).

In the DVD commentary, Frank Miller indicated that he was initially motivated to write &quot;That Yellow Bastard&quot; after his disappointment with &quot;The Dead Pool&quot;, the fifth and final film in the Dirty Harry series. Nancy — who prior to this story had no last name — was named &quot;Callahan&quot;, a name shared with Clint Eastwood&#x27;s character, Harry Callahan.

<text>Lieutenant William Ward Burrows II (6 October 1785 – 5 September 1813) was an officer in the United States Navy during the First Barbary War and the War of 1812. His father, William Ward Burrows I, was the second Commandant of the Marine Corps.

Burrows was born in Philadelphia, and appointed a Midshipman in 1799. He distinguished himself at Tripoli onboard &quot;Constitution&quot;. Lieutenant Burrows died while in command of the brig USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; as a result of wounds received during the engagement with the British brig HMS &quot;Boxer&quot;. He was buried at Eastern Cemetery in Portland, Maine, next to the slain commander of &quot;Boxer&quot;, Samuel Blyth. His tablet notes that it was &quot;erected by a passing stranger.&quot; For Burrows&#x27; actions, he was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal.

Three ships in the United States Navy have been named USS &quot;Burrows&quot; for him. Blyth &amp; Burrows, a bar in Portland, Maine, is named for the duo.

==Congressional Gold Medal citation==
:That the President of the United States be requested to present to the nearest male relative of lieutenant William Burrows, and to lieutenant Edward R. McCall of the brig &quot;Enterprise&quot;, a gold medal with suitable emblems and devices; and a silver medal with like emblems and devices to each of the commissioned officers of the aforesaid vessel, in testimony of the high sense entertained in the conflict with the British sloop &quot;Boxer&quot;, on the fourth of September, in the year one thousand eight hundred and thirteen. And the President is also requested to communicate to the nearest male relative of lieutenant Burrows the deep regret which Congress feel for the loss of that valuable officer, who died in the arms of victory, nobly contending for his country&#x27;s rights and fame.

<text>The Big Fat Kill is a five-issue comic book limited series published by Dark Horse Comics in November 1994–March 1995.

==Plot==
Inside her apartment, a frightened Shellie is comforted by Dwight - with a new face since the events of &quot;A Dame To Kill For&quot; - as the drunken Jackie Boy bangs on the door. Dwight tells Shellie to let Jack and his entourage in, confident he can &#x27;handle them&#x27;.

Jackie Boy enters and insists Shellie call her fellow barmaids to join his pub crawl but she refuses, and Jack hits her. He goes to the bathroom where Dwight ambushes him with a straight razor and tells him to stop bothering Shellie, dunking his head in the toilet.

Jack storms out with his posse. Shellie finds Dwight on the ledge outside the building; determined to stop Jack from causing more trouble, Dwight pursues him, ignoring Shellie&#x27;s muffled yell that sounds like &quot;Stop!&quot;.

Speeding after Jack&#x27;s car, Dwight catches the attention of police, who follow them to the border of Old Town, the area of Sin City populated by prostitutes. Walking alone, Becky rejects Jack’s request for her services. In pursuit, Dwight meets Gail, one of Old Town&#x27;s most experienced hookers and guardians, who advises him to let the girls handle Jack themselves. Spotting Miho on the roof, he agrees.

When Jack pulls a handgun on Becky, Miho throws a Manji-shaped shuriken that cuts off Jack&#x27;s hand, then descends on the car and kills his entourage. Jack aims his gun at Miho, who throws a plug into the barrel. Jack tries to shoot Dwight and the gun shatters, embedding the slide into his forehead. Miho finishes him off by slicing his neck, making &quot;a Pez dispenser out of him&quot;.

As the girls loot the corpses, Dwight finds Jack’s police badge, revealing him to be Detective Lieutenant &quot;Iron&quot; Jack Rafferty - he realizes that Shellie had screamed &quot;COP!&quot; As Jack’s death would break Old Town’s shaky truce with the police, Dwight recommends disposing of the bodies in the tar pits.

The bodies are sliced up to fit in the trunk of a car, leaving Jack in the passenger seat, and Dwight begins the rainy drive to the Pits. He is taunted by Jack’s corpse and is pulled over by police, who let him off with a warning for a broken taillight.

At the Tar Pits, Dwight is attacked by Irish mercenaries and is seemingly killed by a shot to the chest. The mercenaries finds Jackie Boy&#x27;s badge, having stopped the bullet, and Dwight disposes of several of them but is knocked into the pits with the sinking car. A mercenary removes Jackie Boy&#x27;s head as proof of his murder, and leaves Dwight for dead. Miho rescues Dwight, and he deduces that an informant in Old Town has told the mob of Jack’s death. Dwight takes off with Miho and her driver, Dallas, in pursuit of the remaining mercenaries.

In Old Town, Gail is kidnapped and tortured by Manute, having survived his previous encounter with Dwight and Miho. Gail refuses to &quot;facilitate&quot; the process of surrendering Old Town; she learns Becky has sold them out, and bites a chunk off of her neck.

Dwight recalls the Battle of Thermopylae, where King Leonidas defeated his enemies in a narrow trap (a story Miller would later tell in &quot;300&quot;). They catch up to their targets in the Projects. Dallas rams the car into the mercenaries&#x27; and is gunned down. Dwight corners the last mercenary, Brian, in the sewers, but is caught off guard by grenades until Miho kills Brian. Recovering the head, they return to Old Town.

As the gangsters prepare to further torture Gail and kill Becky, Miho shoots a henchmen with an arrow bearing a note, offering to trade Jack&#x27;s head for Gail&#x27;s life.

The gangsters find Dwight alone in a narrow alley. He hands over the head and takes Gail, then triggers a grenade taped inside Jack’s mouth.
The gangsters realize their fatal mistake as the heavily armed girls of Old Town appear on the rooftops, opening fire until, in Dwight&#x27;s words, &quot;the things we&#x27;re pumping bullets into are nothing but twisted toppling screaming smudges of movement.&quot;

==Collected editions==
The series has been collected into a trade paperback ().

==Reception==
Steve Faragher reviewed &quot;The Big Fat Kill&quot; for &quot;Arcane&quot; magazine, rating it an 8 out of 10 overall. Faragher comments that &quot;this is a beautiful book studded with rusty nails, a glorious synergy of text and art and a must read for all his fans.&quot;

==Awards==
*1996:
** Won &quot;Best Limited Series&quot; Eisner Award
** Frank Miller nominated for &quot;Best Cover Artist&quot; Eisner Award, for &quot;The Big Fat Kill&quot;

==Film adaptation==

The story is one of three from &quot;Sin City&quot; related in the film &quot;Sin City&quot;. In the film, Clive Owen plays Dwight, Brittany Murphy plays Shellie, Benicio del Toro plays Jack, Rosario Dawson plays Gail, Devon Aoki plays Miho, Alexis Bledel plays Becky, and Michael Clarke Duncan plays Manute. The film was directed by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez, with Quentin Tarantino co-directing &quot;The Big Fat Kill&quot;, specifically the drive-to-the-pits scene in which Dwight talks with a dead Jack Rafferty.

A notable difference from the comic version is that Becky survives the final gunfight by hiding in a nook in the alley, leaving her alive for the final &quot;epilogue&quot; scene of the movie which ends when she meets The Salesman from &quot;The Customer is Always Right&quot;, who had been introduced in the movie&#x27;s prologue. He then offers her a cigarette just like he did in &quot;The Customer is Always Right&quot;, and Becky seems to sense why he&#x27;s there and tells her mother she loves her before hanging up. There is also a deleted/extended scene from the movie, where Manute and two thugs actually escape the gunfight, bloodied and battered, only to be cornered by Miho in the alley. Miho then tosses the sword right through the two thugs, and finally and definitely kills Manute by bisecting him with a scythe.

<text>Dimitar Blagoev Nikolov (, ; 14 June 1856 – 7 May 1924) was a Bulgarian political leader and philosopher. He was the founder of the Bulgarian left-wing political movement and of the first social-democratic party in the Balkans, the Marxist &quot;Bulgarian Social Democratic Party&quot;. Blagoev was also an important figure in the early history of Russian Marxism, and later founded and led the Bulgarian Communist Party. He was a prominent proponent of ideas for the establishment of a Balkan Federation. He is usually regarded and self-identified as a Bulgarian, and occasionally as a Macedonian Slav.

==Biography==

===Early years and education===
Blagoev was born in the village of Zagorichani in the region of Macedonia (today Vasiliada in Agioi Anargyroi, Kastoria, Greece), at that time part of the Ottoman Empire. In his youth he was influenced by the atmosphere of the Bulgarian National Revival. In his memoirs written in 1922, Blagoev mentions that he was born in a pure Bulgarian village, receiving his national idea by Bulgarian agitators and as a result he was educated in nationalist spirit. He learned consequently in Bulgarian Exarchate&#x27;s schools in Istanbul (1873–1874), Adrianople (1874–1875), Gabrovo (1875–1876) and Stara Zagora (1876–1877). As a student in Gabrovo he supported the cause of the April uprising, and participated on its preparation. During the Russo-Turkish War, he supported the activity of the opalchentsi and the Imperial Russian Army. Later he studied at the Odessa Realschule from 1878 to 1880. 

In autumn 1880, Blagoev enrolled in Saint Petersburg University. In the Imperial capital, he was originally influenced by the populist ideas of Lavrov those of the French anarchist Proudhon. But by the autumn of 1883, reading the first volume of Das Kapital, by Karl Marx, and works by the German socialist Lassalle, and pamphlet &quot;Socialism and the Political Struggle&quot; written by the exiled Russian Marxist Georgi Plekhanov had converted him to Marxism. In 1884, he formed the first Marxist group to operate within Russia, which was known as the Blagoev Group. In 1885, the group produced a newspaper, &quot;&quot;Rabochii&quot; (Worker), Russia&#x27;s first Marxist publication. Also in 1885, it aligned with Plekhanov&#x27;s Emancipation of Labour Group, based in Switzerland. 

In 1883, Blagoev met and married the teacher, writer, and women&#x27;s activist Vela Blagoeva (née Victoria Atanasova Zhivkova) with whom he would have four children: Stela, Natalia, Vladimir and Dimitur.

===Return to Bulgaria===

Blagoev was arrested on 1 March 1885, and extradited to Bulgaria, settled in Sofia and began to propagate socialist ideas. In July 1891, on his initiative, the social democratic circles of Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Sliven, Stara Zagora, Kazanlak and other cities united to form the &quot;Bulgarian Social Democratic Party&quot; (BSDP). The marxist nucleus of the BSDP was opposed by a group, who were essentially opposed to making the social democratic movement into a party. In 1893 this group, led by Yanko Sakazov, founded a reformist organization, the &quot;Bulgarian Social Democratic Union&quot;. In 1894, Blagoev’s supporters agreed to unite with the Unionists in the interests of working class unity and took the name Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers Party. He was a founder and became the leader of its left wing, which split from the BSDWP in 1903 to found the Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party (Narrow Socialists). Blagoev was also activist of the Plovdiv Macedonian-Adrianople Committee, and its chairman from 1897. In 1898 Gotse Delchev made attempt to convince him to lead the Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Committee, but he refused. Under his guidance the foundations of the class trade-union movement was laid in 1904. From 1897 to 1923 Blagoev directed the publication of the party’s theoretical organ, the journal &quot;Novo vreme&quot;, which published more than 500 of his articles. Meanwhile, he worked as teacher in different cities in Bulgaria. In 1905, Blagoev translated into Bulgarian the first volume of &quot;Das Kapital&quot; and a number of other works by Marx. Blagoev’s book &quot;From the History of Socialism in Bulgaria&quot;&quot; was published in 1906 and it has initiated Bulgarian Marxist historiography. He led the delegations of narrow socialists at the Balkan socialist conferences in Belgrade (1910) and Bucharest (1915).

===Wartime activities and stance===

He was against foreign intervention by the Great Powers in Southeast Europe, believed in a Balkan Federative Republic and opposed Bulgaria&#x27;s military engagements in the Second Balkan War and First World War. A deputy to the National Assembly of Bulgaria, Blagoev voted in October 1914, along with the rest of the faction of narrow socialists, against war credits. During World War I as deputy Blagoev exposed &quot;the war’s imperialist nature and the &quot;traitorous role&quot; of the Second International&quot;. Blagoev hailed the Russian October Revolution and propagandized for the ideas of the Bolsheviks. Under his leadership the Narrow Socialist party broke with the Second International. In a speech before the Bulgarian National Assembly in 1917, Blagoev called himself &quot;Macedonian Slav&quot;. In a Declaration against the Treaty of Neuilly, read by Dimiter Blagoev in the Bulgarian National Assembly in 1919 he protested against the partition of the Bulgarian land and nation and promoted the ideas of the Bulgarian Soviet Socialist Republic, as a part of a Balkan Federal Soviet Socialist Republic, as the only political solution able to assure freedom of Macedonia, Thrace and Dobruja and as a counterweight of Bulgarian nationalism.

===Later years and death===

Blagoev led the Narrow Socialists into the Communist International in 1919, and the party changed its name to the Bulgarian Communist Party. However, during this period Blagoev and the party as a whole did not completely adopt Bolshevik positions on the basic questions. This determined the party’s policies during the Vladaya Soldiers’ Rebellion of 1918 and the military coup of 9 June 1923 when the party adopted a position of neutrality. He was also an opponent of the failed September Uprising, believing that conditions were not ripe for a revolution in Bulgaria at that time.

Blagoev was also author of a number of research essays on questions of Marxist philosophy, political economy, history, esthetics, and Bulgarian literature. He died in Sofia, Bulgaria.

<text>Oak Ridge Cemetery is an American cemetery in Springfield, Illinois.

The Lincoln Tomb, where Abraham Lincoln, his wife and all but one of their children lie, is there, as are the graves of other prominent Illinois figures. Opened in 1860, it was the third and is now the only public cemetery in Springfield, after the City Cemetery and Hutchinson.

The cemetery was designed by William Saunders in the Rural Cemetery Landscape Lawn style. The location was chosen for its topography, including rolling hills, key to this style. The many eponymous oak trees cover a ridge bordering low-lying Spring Creek, a landscape unusual in central Illinois. The newest, southwest section opened after 1945. Its design follows the Memorial Park style, in which roadways are wide enough for motor vehicles.

Oak Ridge has a Korean War memorial, the World War II Illinois Veterans Memorial and the Illinois Vietnam Veterans Memorial. The Springfield and Central Illinois African-American History Museum is adjacent.

<doc id="1342971" wikidata="Q964024" url="?curid=1342971" title="Moldavian Democratic Republic">
<text>The Moldavian Democratic Republic (MDR; , ), also known as the Moldavian Republic or Moldavian People&#x27;s Republic, was a state proclaimed on by the &quot;Sfatul Țării&quot; (National Council) of Bessarabia, elected in October–November 1917 following the February Revolution and the start of the disintegration of the Russian Empire.

The &quot;Sfatul Țării&quot; was its legislative body, while the &quot;Council of Directors General&quot;, renamed the &quot;Council of Ministers&quot; after the Declaration of Independence, was its government. The Republic was proclaimed on 2/15 December 1917, as a result of the Declaration of the Rights of the Peoples of Russia.

The anthem of the country was &quot;Deșteaptă-te, române!&quot;.

== History ==
===Summarized===
The brief history of the 1917–1918 Moldavian Democratic Republic can be divided into three periods: the period of autonomy within Russia, the period of independence, and the period of federation with Romania. On 2/15 December, Moldavia proclaimed itself a constituent republic of the Russian Federative Democratic Republic. On 1/14 January 1918, the Front Section of the Rumcherod Bolsheviks entered Chișinău, the capital of the nascent republic. After the nationalist faction of the &quot;Sfatul Țării&quot; requested military assistance from Romania, the Romanian Army crossed the republic&#x27;s border on 10/23 January, taking the capital within days. With the Romanian Army in full control, on 24 January/6 February, the Moldavian Democratic Republic proclaimed its independence. On 27 March/9 April, Moldavia entered a conditioned union (essentially a federation) with the Kingdom of Romania, retaining its provincial autonomy as well as its legislative body (the &quot;Sfatul Țării&quot;). On 27 November/10 December, after the end of World War I, a secret meeting of &quot;Sfatul Țării&quot; members renounced all conditions and proclaimed the unconditional union of Bessarabia with Romania, effectively amounting to an annexation by the latter. This was its last act, as it was subsequently dissolved and prominent unionists were invited to Bucharest. During its 1-year existence, the Moldavian Democratic Republic had three Prime Ministers: Pantelimon Erhan, Daniel Ciugureanu and Petru Cazacu.

===Detailed===
When the February Revolution occurred in Petrograd in 1917, the governor of the Bessarabia Governorate stepped down and passed his legal powers to Constantin Mimi, the President of the Gubernial Zemstvo, which was named &quot;the Commissar of the Provisional Government in Bessarabia&quot;, with Vladimir Cristi his deputy. Similar procedures took place in all regions of the Russian Empire: the chiefs of the Tsarist administrations passed their legal powers to the chiefs of the County and Governorate Zemstvos, which were then called &quot;County/Governorate Commissars&quot;.

The Peasants&#x27; Congress, which took place in October 1917, voted Mimi out and Ion Inculeț in as the new Commissar. This move was planned by Alexander Kerensky, who sent Inculeț, an associate professor at the University of Petrograd, to Bessarabia to take hold of the situation. As soon as the Peasants&#x27; Congress, which had no legal power, voted, Kerenski formally replaced Mimi with Inculeț. When Inculeț arrived in Chișinău to take power, he faced the quiet opposition of the nobility, so he agreed to take the position of deputy commissar to Vladimir Cristi. When the republic was proclaimed, Cristi stepped down and passed his legal powers to Inculeț.

The &quot;Sfatul Țării&quot; (National Council) of Bessarabia was elected in October–November 1917, and started to work in December 1917. It proclaimed the Moldavian Democratic Republic as a federal subject (autonomous republic) of the Russian Democratic Federative Republic. The &quot;Sfatul Țării&quot; voted 86 in favour of proclamation, 6 against, and 36 abstentions. However only within three days, the Bolsheviks seized power in Chișinău.

In the context of the October Revolution, the Russian Army on the Romanian Front disintegrated. The large number of retreating soldiers increased the level of anarchy in Bessarabia, leaving the National Council with only minimal authority over the territory. To further complicate matters, as the council was delaying a decision on the agrarian question, peasants across the region started to break up the estates of the large landowners and divide them among themselves. As the General Staff of the Romanian Front was unable to send any troops, attempts were made to organize a Moldavian National Guard, but the results were far from expectations. Furthermore, most of the army corps nominally subjected to the National Council came under Bolshevik influence. However, in mid-January Romanians entered the country, engaged in battles with the Moldavian and Bolshevik troops and within a couple of weeks controlled much of the country. Among the leaders of Moldavian troops that offered resistance were also figures formerly loyal to the National Council, such as captain Anatolie Popa.

Following the signing of separate peace armistices by Imperial Germany with Romania, Ukraine and Bolshevik Russia the &quot;Sfatul Țării&quot;, with 86 votes in favour, 3 against and 36 abstentions, proclaimed the Union of Bessarabia with the Kingdom of Romania on , with the condition of local autonomy and the continuation of Bessarabian legislative and executive bodies, legally ending the Moldavian Democratic Republic. Discouraged by the fact that the Romanian troops were already present in Chișinău, many minority deputies abstained from voting. The union was confirmed in the Treaty of Paris (1920).

== Leadership ==
The leadership of the Moldavian Republic was composed of Ion Inculeț, the president of the &quot;Sfatul Țării&quot; and President of the Republic; and Pantelimon Erhan, the President of the &quot;Council of Directors General.&quot; The new leadership and Council was put in place after the country was declared independence by Daniel Ciugureanu, as President of the Council of Ministers. The &quot;Sfatul Țării&quot; was initially composed of 120 elected members, although member numbers were later increased to 135 and then 150. For example, on 9 April, there were 138 legislators, of which 125 took part in the vote, and 13 were absent.

On , the &quot;Sfatul Țării&quot; elected the government of the Moldavian Democratic Republic - the Council of Directors General, with nine members, seven Moldavians, one Ukrainian, and one Jew:
* Pantelimon Erhan, President of the council, and Director General for Agriculture.
* Vladimir Cristi, Director General for Internal Affairs.
* Ștefan Ciobanu, Director General for Education.
* Teofil Ioncu, Director General for Finance.
* Nicolae Bosie-Codreanu, Director General for Railways.
* Major Teodor Cojocaru, Director General for Armed Forces.
* Mihail Savenco, Director General for Justice.
* E. Grinfeld, Director General for Industry and Trade.
* Ion Pelivan, Director General for Foreign Affairs.

In its first decree, the Council set forward the aim to &quot;introduce order in all the aspects of life of the country, to eliminate anarchy and disaster, to organize all the aspects of state administration&quot;. An Executive Clerk Office (&quot;Cancelarie&quot;) of the Council of Directors General was set up, and all state, public and private institutions were required to communicate through the Executive Clerk Office to the corresponding Director General for all questions regarding the government of the country. All acts in the domain of public administration made without the previous consent of the respective Directors-General were declared legally void, while the director freed from responsibility for such acts.

<text>Linda Bell Viera Caballero (born March 9, 1969), known professionally as La India, is a Puerto Rican singer and songwriter of salsa, house music and Latin pop. La India has been nominated for both Grammy and Latin Grammy Awards, winning the Latin Grammy Award for Best Salsa Album for the &quot;Intensamente La India Con Canciones De Juan Gabriel&quot; album.

== Early life ==
Viera was born in Río Piedras, San Juan. Both her parents moved to New York City soon after her birth, settling in the South Bronx area of the city. Initially, they lived with Viera&#x27;s grandmother, a woman who served as an important influence on Viera&#x27;s life. Viera began singing as a young girl, even taking opera training for a brief time. Her stage name, La India, was given to her by her grandmother because of her dark features and long, straight, black hair. La India describes herself as a feminist, having witnessed domestic violence from her father.

== Career ==
===1985: Early career===
In 1985, when Caballero was 16 years old, she joined the Latin freestyle group TKA, a fact not widely known. Credited as &quot;Linda,&quot; she appeared in the group photo on the back cover of TKA&#x27;s second single, &quot;Come Get My Love.&quot; She left shortly thereafter.

Caballero signed a record contract with Reprise/Warner Bros. Records, who planned to market her as the Latin version of Madonna (who recorded for sister label Sire Records). India&#x27;s debut album was titled &quot;Breaking Night&quot;. Three singles were released (“Dancing on the Fire,” “Right from the Start,” and “The Lover Who Rocks You All Night”), which all became big hits in the dance clubs. She also added her vocals to the Jellybean-produced single &quot;Mirage&quot;. After recording the album, Caballero decided that she didn&#x27;t want to take that route in her career. She decided to switch to salsa because she believed that she needed to &quot;cross over to [her] people.&quot;

=== 1992–1994: First salsa album ===
An important event took place when she accompanied her husband &quot;Little&quot; Louie Vega to a studio session. Salsa bandleader Eddie Palmieri happened to visit the studio, and was impressed with Caballero when he heard her singing. In 1992, Palmieri produced Caballero&#x27;s first Spanish-language salsa album &quot;Llego La India via Eddie Palmieri&quot; (The India has Arrived via Eddie Palmieri), which was acclaimed as one of the best salsa albums of the year. From then on, Caballero became known to all as La India. India received a Lo Nuestro Award nomination in 1993 for Best Female Performer, Tropical/Salsa.

In 1994 La India, together with Louie Vega, recorded the house-music single &quot;Love and Happiness&quot; (Yemaya y Ochún), which paid tribute to Santería (a syncretic religion based in the Caribbean). This up-beat track was played heavily in dance clubs internationally. La India&#x27;s involvement with Santería drew much criticism. Sergio George produced La India&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Dicen Que Soy&quot;, a 2× gold-certified &quot;Billboard&quot; hit that added to her legend in the Latin-American music realm. The album also included her cover of Cuba’s Adalberto Alvarez Y Su Son’s hit song &quot;Vivir Lo Nuestro,&quot; featuring a duet with Marc Anthony. Later this same year, &quot;Combinación Perfecta&quot; was released.

=== 1996–present: La India, the Princess of Salsa ===

In 1996, La India worked with Tito Puente on &quot;Jazzin&quot;, an English-language album of swing classics with a Latin twist, on RMM Records. That same year she contributed the song &quot;Banderas&quot; to the album titled &quot;Voces Unidas&quot; (United Voices), a multi-artist tribute to the 1996 Summer Olympics. She also released &quot;India: Mega Mix&quot; that same year before divorcing Vega. La India sang a duet titled &quot;La Voz de la Experiencia&quot; (The Voice of Experience) with Celia Cruz, the late Queen of Salsa. It was then that Cruz gave Caballero her longer name: La India, the Princess of Salsa. In 1997, La India recorded &quot;Sobre el Fuego&quot; (Over the Fire) with Puerto Rican salsa singer Kevin Ceballo as backup vocalist. The song was nominated for Best Latin Tropical Performance Grammy Award. In 1998, she won an ACE Award.

On May 31, 1998, La India performed two sold-out concerts at the Luis A. Ferre Performing Arts Center in San Juan, Puerto Rico. She returned to the United States, and television network UPN aired one of her shows. With training provided by New York&#x27;s famed choreographer Sara D&#x27;Arce India was also able to perform concerts in New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden and in El Festival de la Calle Ocho in Miami, Florida. In September 1999, La India released her album &quot;Sola&quot;, which earned positive reviews for the single &quot;Sola&quot; and for covers of two hits by the late Cuban sensation La Lupe, &quot;Que Te Pedi&quot; and &quot;Si Vuelves Tu&quot;.

On February 5, 2000, a full-page ad in Billboard Magazine congratulated La India for her second Grammy Award nomination. In March 2000, she was featured in Vibe Magazine. On November 26, 2003, La India released &quot;Latin Songbird: Mi Alma y Corazón&quot;. The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Sedúceme&quot; became a hit on the Latin charts, and topped the U.S. Billboard Hot Latin Tracks for several weeks. This romantic salsa hit single was La India&#x27;s first number-one song. &quot;Latin Songbird&quot; brought her a new fan base with many awards and nominations, including two Latin Grammy nominations for Best Salsa Album and Best Tropical Song in 2003, and her third Grammy Award nomination for Best Salsa Album in 2004.

In 2005, La India participated in the musical presentation &quot;Selena ¡VIVE!&quot;, a tribute to the late Tejano sensation Selena Quintanilla-Perez. In 2006, La India released the album &quot;Soy Diferente&quot;, which contained two songs that became award-winning hits. The 2007 Annual Latin &quot;Billboard&quot; Awards honored La India with Best Tropical Album of the Year Female for &quot;Soy Diferente&quot; (I Am Different), and Latin Dance Club Play Track of the Year for &quot;Solamente Una Noche&quot; (Just for One Night). In 2007, La India collaborated with Latin sensation Gloria Estefan in a duet titled &quot;90 Millas.&quot;

On June 11, 2006, La India was honored by Union City, New Jersey with a star on the Walk of Fame at Union City&#x27;s Celia Cruz Park.

La India released her ninth studio album in 2010. La India mentioned to the Associated Press, &quot;I am reinventing myself ... changing my physical image. La India will return to become a Barbie. But more than that, I feel like a new woman because I have been blessed with many beautiful things. After many years, I have my family with me, and I am not separated from my mother, in which I suffered greatly. I have her in my life, and that brings inner peace that I haven&#x27;t had in a long time.&quot;

On February 23, 2010, La India&#x27;s hit single &quot;Estupida&quot; was released on iTunes. The single was a cover of the 2009 Italian version &quot;Stupida&quot; by Alessandra Amoroso. La India&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;Unica&quot;, was released June 1, 2010.

In 2011, La India continued to release new music. She performed a duet with Issac Delgado titled &quot;Que No Se Te Olvide.&quot; In 2011, La India released a new house track titled &quot;Tacalacateo,&quot; on which she worked with Italian DJ Peppe Citarella. &quot;Tacalacateo&quot; peaked at #13 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s dance music chart.

In 2012, La India performed as part of : The Latin Tribute to Michael Jackson, along with other Latin artists such as Tito Nieves and Kevin Ceballo.

In 2014, La India once again signed with the record label Top Stop Music, also joining the Salsa Giants project with Sergio George. La India released her tenth studio salsa album &quot;Intensamente Con Canciones de Juan Gabriel&quot; on Top Stop Music in 2015. It includes duets and solo pieces by both artists. This album was number one on Billboard&#x27;s tropical chart for a consecutive four weeks. One song in particular, &quot;Ahora Que Te Vas&quot; quickly rose to number one on Billboard&#x27;s tropical chart. With this song, La India became the Latino woman with the most-ever number ones, a record previously held by Gloria Estefan.

In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked La India at number 113 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

<doc id="1342975" wikidata="Q104419402" url="?curid=1342975" title="Yusef Salaam">
<text>Yusef Salaam (born 1974) is an American politician, motivational speaker, and activist currently serving as a member of the New York City Council, representing the city&#x27;s 9th council district since 2024. A member of the Democratic Party, Salaam, one of the Exonerated Five, was wrongfully convicted of raping a woman in Central Park in 1989. He and his co-defendants were cleared of wrongdoing in 2002.

==Early life==
Salaam was born in 1974 in New York City to Sharonne Salaam.

===Central Park jogger case and conviction===

On April 19, 1989, Trisha Meili, a woman jogging in Central Park, was assaulted and raped by Matias Reyes. Authorities accused Salaam, Korey Wise, Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray and Raymond Santana of assaulting her; the five teenagers—of Black and Latino race—became known as the &quot;Central Park Five,&quot; later the &quot;Exonerated Five.&quot; At the time, Salaam was 15. The teenagers confessed to assaulting her, but later claimed the confessions were the result of beatings and threats by police officers. Salaam later claimed that police had deprived the teenagers of &quot;food, drink or sleep&quot; for more than a day. All five were convicted in 1990. His conviction was upheld by the Appellate Division, and was again upheld in 1993 by the Court of Appeals of the State of New York. He was released from prison in 1997. His conviction was vacated in 2002 and in 2014 New York City paid $41 million to settle a civil rights lawsuit brought by the Exonerated Five.

== Career ==
Following his release in 1997, Salaam worked as a construction worker in an apartment complex in the Mitchell–Lama Housing Program on Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard. He was fired after the company discovered who he was. Salaam then worked at Weill Cornell Medicine. He has served on the board of the Innocence Project.

In 2021, Salaam considered running for the New York State Legislature, but decided against it due to residency requirements. Salaam moved back to New York City from Georgia in 2022. On February 4, 2023, Salaam announced his candidacy for the 9th City Council District of New York City representing Harlem in the 2023 elections. During the campaign, he was endorsed by Cornel West. He won the Democratic primaries on July 5, replacing outgoing councilwoman Kristin Richardson Jordan and defeating assemblymembers Inez Dickens and Al Taylor.

In January 2024, Salaam&#x27;s car, which had Georgia license plates and dark-tinted windows that are illegal in New York, was stopped in Harlem by a New York City police car. When the officer approached his car, Salaam said he was a member of the city council and that he was on city business. He was on a business call with several of his colleagues including City Council member Sandy Nurse, who heard the entire police interaction. He was driving to dinner with his wife and four of his children. Salaam asked why he had been stopped but the officer, on hearing that he was a council member on business, cut off the interaction and walked away saying, &quot;Take care, sir.&quot; Officers are not required to give a reason for stopping a car, but Salaam said the police should have done so voluntarily. Critics of Salaam said he smeared the police and used his position to get out of a possible ticket.

In the aftermath of the second 2024 presidential debate, Salaam confronted former president Donald Trump who previously called for Salaam to be executed, but Trump refused to walk back his statements.

==Personal life==
Salaam is a practicing Muslim. He has ten children, three of whom are stepchildren. In 2016, he received a Lifetime Achievement Award from then-president Barack Obama.

In film, Salaam is featured in documentarian Ken Burns&#x27;s film &quot;The Central Park Five&quot; (2012). He is portrayed as an adult by Chris Chalk and as a child by Ethan Herisse in filmmaker Ava DuVernay&#x27;s television miniseries &quot;When They See Us&quot;. In 2022, &quot;Gate of the Exonerated&quot; was dedicated at the northern end of Central Park in honor of Salaam and the other members of the Exonerated Five.

<doc id="1342978" wikidata="Q1546155" url="?curid=1342978" title="Lerch transcendent">
<text>In mathematics, the Lerch transcendent, is a special function that generalizes the Hurwitz zeta function and the polylogarithm. It is named after Czech mathematician Mathias Lerch, who published a paper about a similar function in 1887. The Lerch transcendent, is given by:

:formula_1.

It only converges for any real number formula_2, where formula_3, or formula_4, and formula_5.

==Special cases==
The Lerch transcendent is related to and generalizes various special functions.

The Lerch zeta function is given by:

:formula_6

The Hurwitz zeta function is the special case
:formula_7
The polylogarithm is another special case:
:formula_8
The Riemann zeta function is a special case of both of the above:
:formula_9
The Dirichlet eta function:

:formula_10

The Dirichlet beta function:

:formula_11

The Legendre chi function:

:formula_12

The inverse tangent integral:

:formula_13

The polygamma functions for positive integers &quot;n&quot;:

:formula_14

The Clausen function:

:formula_15

==Integral representations==

The Lerch transcendent has an integral representation:
:formula_16
The proof is based on using the integral definition of the Gamma function to write
:formula_17
and then interchanging the sum and integral. The resulting integral representation converges for formula_18 Re(&quot;s&quot;) &gt; 0, and Re(&quot;a&quot;) &gt; 0. This analytically continues formula_19 to &quot;z&quot; outside the unit disk. The integral formula also holds if &quot;z&quot; = 1, Re(&quot;s&quot;) &gt; 1, and Re(&quot;a&quot;) &gt; 0; see Hurwitz zeta function.

A contour integral representation is given by
:formula_20
where &quot;C&quot; is a Hankel contour counterclockwise around the positive real axis, not enclosing any of the points formula_21 (for integer &quot;k&quot;) which are poles of the integrand. The integral assumes Re(&quot;a&quot;) &gt; 0.

===Other integral representations===

A Hermite-like integral representation is given by

:formula_22
for
:formula_23
and
:formula_24
for
:formula_25

Similar representations include

:formula_26

and

:formula_27

holding for positive &quot;z&quot; (and more generally wherever the integrals converge). Furthermore,

:formula_28

The last formula is also known as &quot;Lipschitz formula&quot;.

==Identities==
For λ rational, the summand is a root of unity, and thus formula_29 may be expressed as a finite sum over the Hurwitz zeta function. Suppose formula_30 with formula_31 and formula_32. Then formula_33 and formula_34.

:formula_35

Various identities include:
:formula_36

and

:formula_37

and

:formula_38

==Series representations==
A series representation for the Lerch transcendent is given by

:formula_39
(Note that formula_40 is a binomial coefficient.)

The series is valid for all &quot;s&quot;, and for complex &quot;z&quot; with Re(&quot;z&quot;)&lt;1/2. Note a general resemblance to a similar series representation for the Hurwitz zeta function.

A Taylor series in the first parameter was given by Arthur Erdélyi. It may be written as the following series, which is valid for
:formula_41
:formula_42

If &quot;n&quot; is a positive integer, then
:formula_43
for formula_44

The representation as a generalized hypergeometric function is
:formula_45

== Asymptotic expansion ==
The polylogarithm function formula_46 is defined as
:formula_47
Let
:formula_48
For formula_49 and formula_50, an asymptotic expansion of formula_19 for large formula_52 and fixed formula_53 and formula_54 is given by
:formula_55
for formula_56, where formula_57 is the Pochhammer symbol.

Let
:formula_58
Let formula_59 be its Taylor coefficients at formula_60. Then for fixed formula_61 and formula_62,
:formula_63
as formula_64.

==Software==
The Lerch transcendent is implemented as LerchPhi in Maple and Mathematica, and as lerchphi in mpmath and SymPy.

<text>One Moment More is the debut album by American singer-songwriter Mindy Smith.

In 2003, she was invited by producer Steve Buckingham to record a cover version of &quot;Jolene&quot; for the tribute album &quot;Just Because I&#x27;m a Woman: Songs of Dolly Parton&quot;. That song drew attention to Smith, a native of Long Island, New York, who had moved to Nashville. She signed with the jazz label Vanguard Records and released her debut album in 2004. It was produced by Buckingham, who is a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame. During the same year, Smith won the award for Emerging Artist of the Year from the Americana Music Association.

The song &quot;Come to Jesus&quot; reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. The Gaither Vocal Band recorded a cover version that won Bluegrass Song of the Year at the Dove Awards in 2012. Ten years after her recording, Smith said, &quot;I believe God breathed it through me, and I was able to put it to paper.&quot; &quot;One Moment More&quot; is named after a song on the album that addresses the death of her mother. Similarly, the rest of the album deals with loss, struggle, and renewal.

The album sold over 400,000 copies.

<text>&quot;Alabama&quot; is the regional anthem of the U.S. state of Alabama; it was adopted as the official state song in 1931.

==History==
&quot;Alabama&quot; was written as a poem by Julia Tutwiler, a distinguished educator and humanitarian. It was first sung to an Austrian air, but in 1931, the music written by Edna Gockel Gussen, an organist, and choirmaster from Birmingham, Alabama, was adopted by the State Federation of Music Clubs and through their efforts, House Joint Resolution 74 was adopted March 9, 1931. Act no. 126, adopted the music and words as the state song of Alabama. The bill was introduced by the Hon. Tyler Goodwyn, Montgomery, and was signed into law by Governor B. M. Miller.

The inspiration for writing the poem Alabama came to Julia Tutwiler after she returned to her native state from Germany, where she had been studying new educational methods for girls and women. She recalled that in Germany patriotism was inspired by spirited songs. She thought that it would be helpful toward restoring the spirits of her own people to give them a new patriotic song, inspiring her to write &quot;Alabama.&quot;

==Lyrics==
: Alabama, Alabama, We will aye be true to thee,
: From thy Southern shores where groweth,
: By the sea thine orange tree.
: To thy Northern vale where floweth,
: Deep and blue the Tennessee,
: Alabama, Alabama, We will aye be true to thee!

: Broad thy stream whose name thou bearest;
: Grand thy Bigbee rolls along;
: Fair thy Coosa-Tallapoosa
: Bold thy Warrior, dark and strong,
: Goodlier than the land that Moses
: Climbed lone Nebo&#x27;s Mount to see,
: Alabama, Alabama, we will aye be true to thee!

: From thy prairies, broad and fertile,
: Where thy snow-white cotton shines.
: To the hills where coal and iron,
: Hide in thy exhaustless mines,
: Strong-armed miners -sturdy farmers;
: Loyal hearts what&#x27;er we be,
: Alabama, Alabama, we will aye be true to thee!

: From thy quarries where the marble
: White as that of Paros gleams
: Waiting till thy sculptor&#x27;s chisel,
: Wake to life thy poet&#x27;s dreams;
: Fear not only wealth of nature,
: Wealth of mind hast thou no fee,
: Alabama, Alabama, we will aye be true to thee!

: Where the perfumed south-wind whispers,
: Thy magnolia groves among,
: Softer than a mother&#x27;s kisses,
: Sweeter than a mother&#x27;s song,
: Where the golden jasmine trailing,
: Woos the treasure-laden bee,
: Alabama, Alabama, we will aye be true to thee!

: Brave and pure thy men and women,
: Better this than corn and wine
: Make us worthy, God in Heaven
: Of this goodly land of Thine.
: Hearts as open as thy doorways.
: Liberal hands and spirits free.
: Alabama, Alabama, we will aye be true to thee!

: Little, little can I give thee,
: Alabama, mother mine.
: But that little - hand, brain, spirit.
: All I have and am are thine.
: Take, O take, the gift and giver.
: Take and serve thyself with me.
: Alabama, Alabama, we will aye be true to thee!

<text>Winthrop Paul &quot;Win&quot; Rockefeller (September 17, 1948 – July 16, 2006) was an American Republican politician and businessman who served as the 17th lieutenant governor of Arkansas from 1996 until his death in 2006. He was a member of the Rockefeller family.

==Early life ==
Rockefeller was born in New York City, New York, the only child of Arkansas Governor Winthrop Rockefeller and actress Jievute &quot;Bobo&quot; Paulekiute. His parents separated in 1950 and divorced four years later. His maternal grandparents were Lithuanian.

Rockefeller grew up in both the United States and in Europe and was educated at schools in New York, England, and in Switzerland. He attended the American College of Switzerland, and Pembroke College, Oxford for one year, before graduating with a Certificate from the Ranch Management program at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas in 1974.

==Political career and terms as lieutenant governor==

Rockefeller served from 1981 to 1995 on the Arkansas State Police Commission. In 1991, he was appointed by President George H. W. Bush to serve on the President&#x27;s Council on Rural America and became chairman of the council. He was a president of the Quapaw Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America and served on the board of directors of the national Scouting organization.

Rockefeller&#x27;s first foray into elective politics came when he won a narrow victory over Arkansas State Senator Charlie Cole Chaffin, the first woman elected to serve in the Arkansas State Senate and the 1994 nominee for Lieutenant Governor. The November 1996 special election was necessitated by the resignation of Governor Jim Guy Tucker and the elevation of Lieutenant Governor Mike Huckabee to the Governorship. Rockefeller was subsequently re-elected in 1998 to a full four-year term with 67 percent of the vote, over physician Dr. Kurt Dilday. This margin far greater than the vote received by his father in the 1966 and 1968 gubernatorial elections. Rockefeller was elected once again in 2002 with 60 percent of the vote, over Arkansas State Supreme Court Justice Ron Sheffield, the first Black man nominated for statewide office as a Democrat. Money was important to the race.

As Lieutenant Governor, Rockefeller was an avid proponent of the state’s economic interests, and he often traveled at his own expense to seek out potential foreign investors, while at the same time donating his own governmental salary to charity. As Acting Governor on September 11, 2001, the day terrorists attacked the World Trade Center and The Pentagon, he resisted calls to declare a state of emergency and instead urged Arkansans to remain calm and to donate blood. He sponsored Project ChildSafe, a national firearms safety program that has distributed hundreds of thousands of free trigger locks in Arkansas. He was honorary chairman of the Arkansas Literary Festival. In 1997, Rockefeller created Books in the Attic, a program using existing resources, Boy Scouts, and volunteers to ensure access to reading opportunities for all children. In 2004, he served as the chairman of the Arkansas Republican Party.

==Personal life==
On March 22, 1971, Rockefeller married Deborah Cluett Sage of New York, the eldest daughter of Louis Davidson Sage and the former Constance Cluett Ward. The couple met while both were studying in Oxford, England. The wedding took place at the Bruton Parish Church at Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia.

The couple had three children:
*Andrea Davidson Rockefeller (b. July 31, 1972)
*Katherine Cluett Rockefeller (b. February 7, 1974)
*Winthrop Paul Rockefeller Jr. (b. July 10, 1976)

The couple divorced on January 11, 1979.

On June 4, 1983, Rockefeller married Lisenne Dudderar, an administrative assistant with the Arkansas Nature Conservancy. They had four sons:
*William Gordon Rockefeller (born 1986), who serves as managing director of Bank OZK, as well as on the leadership team of Rockefeller Capital Management and a variety of profit and nonprofit boards. In 2014, he married Caroline Farrior Boone of Tuscaloosa, Alabama.
*Colin Kendrick Rockefeller (born 1990), married in 2014 to Taylor Elise Stevens, at Winrock Farms.
*John Alexander Camp Rockefeller (born 1992)
*Louis Henry Rockefeller (born 1996), who was sentenced on one count of transfer of a machine gun, and ordered to serve 52 months in federal prison in March 2022.

They adopted a daughter, Grace, in Hong Kong. Win and Lisenne founded a school for children with learning disabilities in Little Rock, now known as the Academy at Riverdale.

==Wealth==
Rockefeller served as chief executive of Winrock Farms, Inc., which had been set up by his father, and had interests in various small businesses around the state: in retailing, automobiles, farming, and the resort industry. He was an active member of the National Federation of Independent Business. Rockefeller was ranked # 283 on the &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine list of the nation&#x27;s wealthiest people in 2005, with a fortune the magazine estimated at $1.2 billion. As lieutenant governor, which was a part-time job, he forwarded his $34,673 state salary to charity.

==Illness and death==
Rockefeller had announced his candidacy for governor and was expected to face Asa Hutchinson in the Republican primary election in May 2006. On July 20, 2005, however, he bowed out of the race due to his myeloproliferative disease, a blood disorder that can develop into leukemia if left untreated. In October 2005 and March 2006, Rockefeller underwent unsuccessful bone marrow transplants at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington. On July 8, 2006, after the failure of his second bone marrow transplant, he returned to Little Rock, where he died eight days later at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. On July 19, his body lay in state in the rotunda of the Arkansas State Capitol, and the next day, a memorial service was held at Pulaski Heights United Methodist Church, of which Rockefeller was a member. At the time of his death, he was survived by his mother, wife, children, and one granddaughter.

That fall in November, then-Attorney General Mike Beebe, the Democrat who won the race for Governor of Arkansas by defeating Hutchinson, gave tribute to the late Rockefeller saying, &quot;Had he lived, we all know I would not have been here but rather we would have been congratulating a good friend and a great Arkansan as the next Governor, Win Paul Rockefeller.&quot;

<doc id="1342988" wikidata="Q1034197" url="?curid=1342988" title="Capacitor plague">
<text>The capacitor plague was a problem related to a higher-than-expected failure rate of non-solid aluminium electrolytic capacitors between 1999 and 2007, especially those from some Taiwanese manufacturers, due to faulty electrolyte composition that caused corrosion accompanied by gas generation; this often resulted in rupturing of the case of the capacitor from the build-up of pressure.

High failure rates occurred in many well-known brands of electronics, and were particularly evident in motherboards, video cards, and power supplies of personal computers.

A 2003 article in &quot;The Independent&quot; claimed that the cause of the faulty capacitors was due to a mis-copied formula. In 2001, a scientist working in the Rubycon Corporation in Japan stole a mis-copied formula for capacitors&#x27; electrolytes. He then took the faulty formula to the Luminous Town Electric company in China, where he had previously been employed. In the same year, the scientist&#x27;s staff left China, stealing again the mis-copied formula and moving to Taiwan, where they created their own company, producing capacitors and propagating even more of this faulty formula of capacitor electrolytes.

==History==

===First announcements===
The first flawed capacitors linked to Taiwanese raw material problems were reported by the specialist magazine &quot;Passive Component Industry&quot; in September 2002. Shortly thereafter, two mainstream electronics journals reported the discovery of widespread prematurely failing capacitors, from Taiwanese manufacturers, in motherboards.

These publications informed engineers and other technically interested specialists, but the issue did not receive widespread public exposure until Carey Holzman published his experiences about &quot;leaking capacitors&quot; in the overclocking performance community.

===Public attention===
The news from the Holzman publication spread quickly on the Internet and in newspapers, partly due to the spectacular images of the failures – bulging or burst capacitors, expelled sealing rubber and leaking electrolyte on countless circuit boards. Many PC users were affected, and caused an avalanche of reports and comments on thousands of blogs and other web communities.

The quick spread of the news also resulted in many misinformed users and blogs posting pictures of capacitors that had failed due to reasons other than faulty electrolyte.

===Prevalence===
Most of the affected capacitors were produced from 1999 to 2003 and failed between 2002 and 2005. Problems with capacitors produced with an incorrectly formulated electrolyte have affected equipment manufactured up to at least 2007.

Major vendors of motherboards such as Abit, IBM, Dell, Apple, HP, and Intel were affected by capacitors with faulty electrolytes.

In 2005, Dell spent some US$420 million replacing motherboards outright and on the logistics of determining whether a system was in need of replacement.

Many other equipment manufacturers unknowingly assembled and sold boards with faulty capacitors, and as a result the effect of the capacitor plague could be seen in all kinds of devices worldwide.

Because not all manufacturers had offered recalls or repairs, do it yourself repair instructions were written and published on the Internet.

===Responsibility===
In the November/December 2002 issue of &quot;Passive Component Industry&quot;, following its initial story about defective electrolyte, reported that some large Taiwanese manufacturers of electrolytic capacitors were denying responsibility for defective products.

While industrial customers confirmed the failures, they were not able to trace the source of the faulty components. The defective capacitors were marked with previously unknown brands such as &quot;Tayeh&quot;, &quot;Choyo&quot;, or &quot;Chhsi&quot;. The marks were not easily linked to familiar companies or product brands.

The motherboard manufacturer ABIT Computer Corp. was the only affected manufacturer that publicly admitted to defective capacitors obtained from Taiwan capacitor makers being used in its products. However, the company would not reveal the name of the capacitor maker that supplied the faulty products.

==Symptoms==

===Common characteristics===
The non-solid aluminium electrolytic capacitors with improperly formulated electrolyte mostly belonged to the so-called &quot;low equivalent series resistance (ESR)&quot;, &quot;low impedance&quot;, or &quot;high ripple current&quot; e-cap series. The advantage of e-caps using an electrolyte composed of 70% water or more is, in particular, a low ESR, which allows a higher ripple current, and decreased production costs, water being the least costly material in a capacitor.

===Premature failure===
All electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte age over time, due to evaporation of the electrolyte. The capacitance usually decreases and the ESR usually increases. The normal lifespan of a non-solid electrolytic capacitor of consumer quality, typically rated at 2000 h/85 °C and operating at 40 °C, is roughly 6 years. It can be more than 10 years for a 1000 h/105 °C capacitor operating at 40 °C. Electrolytic capacitors that operate at a lower temperature can have a considerably longer lifespan.

The capacitance should normally degrade to as low as 70% of the rated value, and the ESR increase to twice the rated value, over the normal life span of the component, before it should be considered as a &quot;degradation failure&quot;. The life of an electrolytic capacitor with defective electrolyte can be as little as two years. The capacitor may fail prematurely after reaching approximately 30% to 50% of its expected lifetime.

===Electrical symptoms===
The electrical characteristics of a failed electrolytic capacitor with an open vent are the following:
*capacitance value decreases to below the rated value
*ESR increases to very high values.

Electrolytic capacitors with an open vent are in the process of drying out, regardless of whether they have good or bad electrolyte. They always show low capacitance values and very high ohmic ESR values. Dry e-caps are therefore electrically useless.

E-caps can fail without any visible symptoms. Since the electrical characteristics of electrolytic capacitors are the reason for their use, these parameters must be tested with instruments to definitively decide if the devices have failed. But even if the electrical parameters are out of their specifications, the assignment of failure to the electrolyte problem is not a certainty.

Non-solid aluminium electrolytic capacitors without visible symptoms, which have improperly formulated electrolyte, typically show two electrical symptoms:
*relatively high and fluctuating leakage current
*increased capacitance value, up to twice the rated value, which fluctuates after heating and cooling of the capacitor body

===Visible symptoms===
When examining a failed electronic device, the failed capacitors can easily be recognized by clearly visible symptoms that include the following:

*Bulging of the vent on top of the capacitor. (The &quot;vent&quot; is stamped into the top of the casing of a can-shaped capacitor, forming a seam that is meant to split to relieve pressure build-up inside, preventing an explosion.)
*Ruptured or cracked vent, often accompanied by visible crusty rust-like brown or red dried electrolyte deposits.
*Capacitor casing sitting crooked on the circuit board, caused by the bottom rubber plug being pushed out, sometimes with electrolyte having leaked onto the motherboard from the base of the capacitor, visible as dark-brown or black surface deposits on the PCB. The leaked electrolyte can be confused with thick elastic glue sometimes used to secure the capacitors against shock. A dark brown or black crust up the side of a capacitor is invariably glue, not electrolyte. The glue itself is harmless.

==Investigation==
===Implications of industrial espionage===
Industrial espionage was implicated in the capacitor plague, in connection with the theft of an electrolyte formula. A materials scientist working for Rubycon in Japan left the company, taking the secret water-based electrolyte formula for Rubycon&#x27;s ZA and ZL series capacitors, and began working for a Chinese company. The scientist then developed a copy of this electrolyte. Then, some staff members who defected from the Chinese company copied an incomplete version of the formula and began to market it to many of the aluminium electrolytic manufacturers in Taiwan, undercutting the prices of the Japanese manufacturers. This incomplete electrolyte lacked important proprietary ingredients which were essential to the long-term stability of the capacitors and was unstable when packaged in a finished aluminium capacitor. This faulty electrolyte allowed the unimpeded formation of hydroxide and produced hydrogen gas.

There are no public court proceedings related to the alleged theft, as Rubycon&#x27;s complete electrolyte formula remained secure. However, independent laboratory analysis of defective capacitors has shown that many of the premature failures appear to be associated with high water content and missing inhibitors in the electrolyte, as described below.

===Incomplete electrolyte formula===
Unimpeded formation of hydroxide (hydration) and associated hydrogen gas production, occurring during &quot;capacitor plague&quot; or &quot;bad capacitors&quot; incidents involving the failure of large numbers of aluminium electrolytic capacitors, has been demonstrated by two researchers at the Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering of the University of Maryland who analyzed the failed capacitors.

The two scientists initially determined, by ion chromatography and mass spectrometry, that there was hydrogen gas present in failed capacitors, leading to bulging of the capacitor&#x27;s case or bursting of the vent. Thus it was proved that the oxidation takes place in accordance with the first step of aluminium oxide formation.

Because it has been customary in electrolytic capacitors to bind the excess hydrogen by using reducing or depolarizing compounds, such as aromatic nitrogen compounds or amines, to relieve the resulting pressure, the researchers then searched for compounds of this type. Although the analysis methods were very sensitive in detecting such pressure-relieving compounds, no traces of such agents were found within the failed capacitors.

In capacitors in which the internal pressure build-up was so great that the capacitor case was already bulging but the vent had not opened yet, the pH value of the electrolyte could be measured. The electrolyte of the faulty Taiwanese capacitors was alkaline, with a pH of between 7 and 8. Good comparable Japanese capacitors had an electrolyte that was acidic, with a pH of around 4. As it is known that aluminium can be dissolved by alkaline liquids, but not that which is mildly acidic, an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX or EDS) fingerprint analysis of the electrolyte of the faulty capacitors was made, which detected dissolved aluminium in the electrolyte.

To protect the metallic aluminium against the aggressiveness of the water, some phosphate compounds, known as inhibitors or passivators, can be used to produce long-term stable capacitors with high-aqueous electrolytes. Phosphate compounds are mentioned in patents regarding electrolytic capacitors with aqueous electrolytic systems. Since phosphate ions were missing and the electrolyte was also alkaline in the investigated Taiwanese electrolytes, the capacitor evidently lacked any protection against water damage, and the formation of more-stable alumina oxides was inhibited. Therefore, only aluminium hydroxide was generated.

The results of chemical analysis were confirmed by measuring electrical capacitance and leakage current in a long-term test lasting 56 days. Due to the chemical corrosion, the oxide layer of these capacitors had been weakened, so after a short time the capacitance and the leakage current increased briefly, before dropping abruptly when gas pressure opened the vent. The report of Hillman and Helmold proved that the cause of the failed capacitors was a faulty electrolyte mixture used by the Taiwanese manufacturers, which lacked the necessary chemical ingredients to ensure the correct pH of the electrolyte over time, for long-term stability of the electrolytic capacitors. Their further conclusion, that the electrolyte with its alkaline pH value had the fatal flaw of a continual buildup of hydroxide without its being converted into the stable oxide, was verified on the surface of the anode foil both photographically and with an EDX-fingerprint analysis of the chemical components.

<text>The Rhodocyclales are an order of the class &quot;Betaproteobacteria&quot; in the phylum &quot;Pseudomonadota&quot; (&quot;Proteobacteria&quot;). Following a major reclassification of the class in 2017, the previously monofamilial order was split into three families:

*&quot;Rhodocyclaceae&quot; (type family) contains the genera &quot;Rhodocyclus&quot; (type genus), &quot;Azospira&quot; and &quot;Propionivibrio&quot;. Cells are curved rods, rings or spirillae. Dominant respiratory quinones are menaquinone-8, ubiquinone-8 and . G+C fractions are 61.6 - 65.3 mol%.
*&quot;Azonexaceae&quot; contains the genera &quot;Azonexus&quot; (type genus), &quot;Dechloromonas&quot;, &quot;Ferribacterium&quot; and &quot;Quatrionicoccus&quot;. Cells are curved rods or cocci. Dominant respiratory quinone is ubiquinone-8. G+C fractions are 63.5 - 67.0 mol%.
*&quot;Zoogloeaceae&quot; contains the genera &quot;Zoogloea&quot; (type genus), &quot;Thauera&quot;, &quot;Uliginosibacterium&quot; and &quot;Azoarcus&quot;. Cells are rod shaped. Dominant respiratory quinones are ubiquinone-8 and rhodoquinone-8. G+C fractions are 59.3 - 69.0 mol%.

The genus &quot;Azovibrio&quot; also falls within the order but is &quot;incertae sedis&quot;, falling between the &quot;Zoogloeaeceae&quot; and the &quot;Azonexaceae&quot;.

<doc id="1342993" wikidata="Q2343580" url="?curid=1342993" title="Vincenzo Bellavere">
<text>Vincenzo Bellavere (also Bell&#x27;haver, Bell&#x27;aver, Belaver) (c.1540-1541 – 29 August 1587) was an Italian composer of the Venetian School. While a fairly minor figure in the Venetian School, he was a competent composer of madrigals and wrote a few works in the grand Venetian polychoral style.

== Biography ==
Nothing is known about him prior to his appearance in Padua in 1567 as an organist at Crosieri Cathedral. That same year he tried to gain the prestigious job as first organist of the cathedral there. In 1568 he acquired the position of primary organist at the Scuola Grande di San Rocco, a Venetian establishment almost as prestigious as St. Mark&#x27;s; he held this post until 1584 at which time he returned to Padua to take the post at the cathedral that he at first failed to win. In December 1585 he was fired from his job in Padua, probably because of an unexcused absence, but he returned to Venice to become organist of yet another Venetian church, Santo Stefano. In 1586 he became first organist at St. Mark&#x27;s, the position just vacated by Andrea Gabrieli; thus he was first organist alongside Giovanni Gabrieli, who was second organist. Unfortunately Bellavere died after only holding this post for nine months.

Bellavere was a talented composer and could have become a major member of the Venetian school, had his career not been cut short; possibly he died fairly young, though reliable information on his age is missing.

== Works ==
Bellavere wrote, besides keyboard works (being an organist), choral works, notably madrigals in a light style reminiscent of Andrea Gabrieli, as well as four motets and two settings of the Magnificat.

His last music shows a progressive use of the multiple choir and instrument group style that was to make Giovanni Gabrieli famous, and which is the hallmark of the Venetian School.

<doc id="1343000" wikidata="Q734156" url="?curid=1343000" title="Here Come the Warm Jets">
<text>Here Come the Warm Jets is the debut solo studio album by English musician Brian Eno (mononymously credited as &quot;Eno&quot;), released on Island Records on 8 February 1974. It was recorded and produced by Eno following his departure from Roxy Music, and blends glam and pop stylings with avant-garde approaches. The album features numerous guests, including several of Eno&#x27;s former Roxy Music bandmates along with members of Hawkwind, Matching Mole, Pink Fairies, Sharks, Sweetfeed, and King Crimson. Eno employed unusual directions and production methods to coax unexpected results from the musicians.

&quot;Here Come the Warm Jets&quot; peaked at number 26 on the United Kingdom album charts and number 151 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, receiving mostly positive reviews. It was re-issued on compact disc in 1990 on Island Records and remastered in 2004 on Virgin Records, and continued to elicit praise.

== Production ==

&quot;Here Come the Warm Jets&quot; was recorded in twelve days at Majestic Studios in London during September 1973 by recording engineer Derek Chandler. It was mixed at Air and Olympic Studios by Eno and engineer Chris Thomas. The album&#x27;s title was long thought to be a slang term for urination, but in a 1996 interview with &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine, Eno said it came from a description he wrote for the treated guitar on the title track; he called it &quot;&#x27;warm jet guitar&#x27; ... because the guitar sounded like a tuned jet.&quot;

Eno enlisted sixteen guest musicians to play on the album, who were invited on the basis that Eno thought they were musically incompatible with each other. He said he &quot;got them together merely because I wanted to see what happens when you combine different identities like that and allow them to compete ... [The situation] is organized with the knowledge that there might be accidents, accidents which will be more interesting than what I had intended&quot;.

Eno directed the musicians by using body language and dancing, as well as through verbal suggestion, to influence their playing and the sounds they would emit. He felt at the time that this was a good way to communicate with musicians. The album credits Eno with instruments such as &quot;snake guitar&quot;, &quot;simplistic piano&quot; and &quot;electric larynx&quot;. These terms were used to describe the sound&#x27;s character or the means of production used to treat the instruments. After recording the individual tracks, Eno condensed and mixed the instrumentation deeply, resulting in some of the tracks bearing little resemblance to what the musicians recorded during the session.

Eno&#x27;s girlfriend at the time, potter Carol McNicoll, supervised the design of the cover for the album, which features one of her teapots. The back also has a picture of what appears to be a &quot;naughty&quot; playing card showing a woman urinating outdoors, thus lending support to the original interpretation of the album title.

== Music and lyrics ==

The songs on &quot;Here Come the Warm Jets&quot; reference various musical styles from the past and present. The overall style of the album has been described as &quot;glammed-up art-pop&quot;, showcasing glam rock&#x27;s simple yet theatrical crunchy guitar rock and art pop&#x27;s sonic texture and avant-garde influences. The album has been also described as art rock. On some tracks, Eno&#x27;s vocals emulate singer Bryan Ferry, of Eno&#x27;s former band Roxy Music. On other songs they were described as &quot;more nasal and slightly snotty vocals&quot;. Musically, the album borrows from popular styles of the music of the 1950s such as the tinkling pianos and falsetto backing vocals on &quot;Cindy Tells Me&quot;, and the drum rhythm of &quot;Blank Frank&quot;, taken from Bo Diddley&#x27;s song &quot;Who Do You Love?&quot;. Critic Robert Christgau noted that &quot;minimally differentiated variations on the same melody recur and recur,&quot; adding that &quot;chances are he meant it that way, as a statement.&quot;

To create the lyrics, Eno would later play these backing tracks singing nonsense syllables to himself, then take them and form them into actual words, phrases and meaning. This lyric-writing method was used for all his more vocal-based recordings of the 1970s. The lyrics on &quot;Here Come the Warm Jets&quot; are macabre with an underlying sense of humour. They are mostly free-associative and have no particular meaning. Exceptions include &quot;The Paw Paw Negro Blowtorch&quot;, about the historical A.W. Underwood of Paw Paw, Michigan with the purported ability to set items ablaze with his breath; according to Eno, the song &quot;celebrates the possibility of a love affair with the man.&quot; Eno has attempted to dissuade fans from reading too much into his words; he claims that the song &quot;Needles in the Camel&#x27;s Eye&quot; was &quot;written in less time than it takes to sing ... I regard [the song] as an instrumental with singing on it&quot;.

== Release ==

&quot;Here Come the Warm Jets&quot; was released on 8 February 1974. The album was one of Brian Eno&#x27;s best-selling releases, charting for two weeks and peaking at number 26 on the UK Albums Chart on 9 March 1974, and number 151 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tapes chart. Eno planned a tour with the band The Winkies to accompany him following the release of &quot;Here Come the Warm Jets&quot;. Eno had to depart the tour after being diagnosed with a collapsed lung. After recovering, Eno played at an Island Records 1 June 1974 concert with fellow musicians Nico, Kevin Ayers and John Cale.

&quot;Here Come the Warm Jets&quot; was later re-issued on Polydor in March 1977, and again on compact disc in January 1987. In 2004, Virgin Records began reissuing Eno&#x27;s albums in batches of four to five. The remastered digipak release of &quot;Here Come the Warm Jets&quot; was released on 31 May 2004 in the UK and on 1 June 2004 in North America.

== Critical reception ==
Initial critical reception for the album was mostly positive, with praise focused on its experimental tendencies. Critic Lester Bangs of &quot;Creem&quot; declared it &quot;incredible,&quot; and noted that &quot;the predominant feel is a strange mating of edgy dread with wild first-time-out exuberance.&quot; Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; gave it an &quot;A&quot; rating, stating that &quot;The idea of this record—top of the pops from quasi-dadaist British synth wizard—may put you off, but the actuality is quite engaging in a vaguely Velvet Underground kind of way.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote a positive review, stating that &quot;... while it all may be a bit unpredictable, and may be a longshot to do much in the U.S. market, it is an excellent LP.&quot; The album was also placed in &quot;Circus&quot; magazine&#x27;s section for &quot;Picks of the Month&quot;. Cynthia Dagnal of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote an article on Eno, calling the album &quot;a very compelling experiment in controlled chaos and by his own self-dictated standards a near success.&quot; The next month, Gordon Fletcher wrote a negative review for the album in the &quot;Records&quot; section of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, stating &quot;[Eno&#x27;s] record is annoying because it doesn&#x27;t do anything ... the listener must kick himself for blowing five bucks on baloney.&quot; In 1974, &quot;Here Come the Warm Jets&quot; was voted one of the best albums of the year in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll for that year.

Later assessments of the album have been positive; critic Steve Huey of AllMusic stated that the album &quot;still sounds exciting, forward-looking, and densely detailed, revealing more intricacies with every play&quot;. In 1991, &quot;Select&quot; writer David Cavanagh described it as a &quot;classic&quot; album of &quot;mind-blowing diversity&quot;. In 2003, the album placed at number 436 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, climbing to number 432 in the 2012 update and to number 308 in the 2020 edition. In a retrospective review, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s J. D. Considine commented that &quot;It may be easy to hear both an anticipation of punk and an echo of Roxy Music in the arch clangor of &quot;Here Come the Warm Jets&quot;, but what shines brightest is the offhand accessibility of the songs&quot;, adding that &quot;the melodies linger on ... the album seems almost a blueprint for the pop experiments Bowie (with Eno collaborating) would conduct with &quot;Low&quot;&quot;. In 2004, Pitchfork ranked the album at number 24 on its &quot;Top 100 Albums of the 1970s&quot; list. In 2003, &quot;Blender&quot; placed the album on its list &quot;500 CDs You Must Own: Alternative Rock&quot;, stating that &quot;Here Come the Warm Jets&quot; &quot;remains his best pop effort. His experimental touch turns basic glam-rock into something sick and sinister. The free-associating, posh-voiced vocals are an acquired taste, but there&#x27;s method in this madness&quot;. The Canadian music magazine &quot;Exclaim!&quot; referred to &quot;Here Come the Warm Jets&quot; as &quot;Arguably one of the greatest solo debuts of the 1970s ... Songs such as &quot;Baby&#x27;s on Fire&quot;, &quot;Driving Me Backwards&quot; and &quot;Needles in the Camel&#x27;s Eye&quot; capture the lush and sleazy underpinning narratives of the British Invasion in arrangements that sound quintessentially timeless&quot;. In 2012, &quot;Treble&quot; named the album in the list &quot;10 Essential Glam Rock Albums.&quot;

== Legacy ==
The album&#x27;s title track was sampled by Injury Reserve for the track &quot;Bye Storm&quot;, which is the final track on their album &quot;By the Time I Get to Phoenix&quot;.

<doc id="1343002" wikidata="Q2846038" url="?curid=1343002" title="And death shall have no dominion">
<text>&quot;And death shall have no dominion&quot; is a poem written by Welsh poet Dylan Thomas (1914–1953). The title comes from St. Paul&#x27;s epistle to the Romans (6:9): &quot;Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no dominion over him.&quot; The poem portrays death as a guarantee of immortality, drawing on imagery from John Donne&#x27;s &quot;Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions&quot;.

== Poem ==
&lt;poem&gt;And death shall have no dominion.
Dead men naked they shall be one
With the man in the wind and the west moon;
When their bones are picked clean and the clean bones gone,
They shall have stars at elbow and foot;
Though they go mad they shall be sane,
Though they sink through the sea they shall rise again;
Though lovers be lost love shall not;
And death shall have no dominion.

And death shall have no dominion.
Under the windings of the sea
They lying long shall not die windily;
Twisting on racks when sinews give way,
Strapped to a wheel, yet they shall not break;
Faith in their hands shall snap in two,
And the unicorn evils run them through;
Split all ends up they shan&#x27;t crack;
And death shall have no dominion.

And death shall have no dominion.
No more may gulls cry at their ears
Or waves break loud on the seashores;
Where blew a flower may a flower no more
Lift its head to the blows of the rain;
Though they be mad and dead as nails,
Heads of the characters hammer through daisies;
Break in the sun till the sun breaks down,
And death shall have no dominion.&lt;/poem&gt;

==Publication history==
In early 1933 Thomas befriended Bert Trick, a grocer who worked in the Uplands area of Swansea. Trick was an amateur poet who had several poems published in local papers. In spring 1933 Trick suggested the two men both write a poem on the subject of &#x27;immortality&#x27;. Trick&#x27;s poem, which was published in a newspaper the following year, contained the refrain &quot;For death is not the end.&quot; In 1933, in a notebook marked &#x27;April&#x27;, Thomas wrote the poem &quot;And death shall have no dominion&quot;. Trick persuaded him to seek a publisher and in May of that year it was printed in &quot;New English Weekly&quot;.

On 10 September 1936, two years after the release of his first volume of poetry (&quot;18 Poems&quot;), &quot;Twenty-five Poems&quot; was published. It revealed Thomas&#x27;s personal beliefs pertaining to religion and the forces of nature, and included &quot;And death shall have no dominion&quot;.

==Cultural references==
The poem was set to music by Paul Kelly in his album &quot;Nature&quot; (2018). The titles of the novels &quot;They Shall Have Stars&quot; (1956) by James Blish and &quot;No Dominion&quot; (2006) by Charlie Huston are both taken from the poem. Mithu Sanyal quotes the poem at length in her novel &quot;Identitti&quot; (2022). Disc 2 of UNKLE Sounds&#x27; release &quot;Edit Music For A Film&quot; (2005) features the first verse of the poem, played over an UNKLE Sounds edit of &quot;Next Life/Is That What Everybody Wants&quot;.

<doc id="1343005" wikidata="Q8067147" url="?curid=1343005" title="Zatra">
<text>Zatra(जात्रा) is the Konkani language term for the pilgrimage festivals celebrated at Hindu temples in Goa, India; the equivalent of &quot;yatra&quot; and &quot;jatra&quot;. In Maharashtra the alternative term Urus is used as well.

During the zatra, the idol(s) or murtis of the Hindu deity or deities are taken out on special procession either in a &quot;Palkhi&quot; (sort of a Palanquin) or in a large, multi-storied chariot called the Rath.

Traditionally, every temple observes this festival once a year on the traditional day. All zatras usually occur after Diwali in October and continues until the Shigmo or Holi festival in March.

The most famous zatra of Goa is that of the temple of the Hindu deity Lairai at Shirgao, a place located roughly 30 km away from Panaji when people walk on burning coals with bare legs and that of deity Goddess Shantadurga at Village Fatorpa in Quepem Taluka; approx 50 km from Panaji and 18 km from Madgao. These Zatras can be compared to Mela (Hindi) for its other commercial and entertainment activities.

Popular snacks sold and consumed during zatra are ladu which is the local name for laddu and khaje (खाजें) which are fried chickpea flour sticks dipped in a jaggery and sesame mixture.

Also occurring during the zatra is the phenomenon of possession, usually but not exclusively of women, by the spirit of the deity; this is called &quot;Bhar&quot;, whereby they act as oracles and claim to predict future events.

Outside of Goa, the most famous &quot;zatra&quot; is the Rath Yatra of the Jagannath Temple in Puri, Odisha, India which contributed the word &quot;juggernaut&quot; to the English language.

<text>Troy Broadbridge (5 October 1980 – 26 December 2004) was an Australian rules footballer with the Melbourne Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL).

==AFL career==

===Melbourne career (2001–2004)===
Broadbridge began his career as a defender with South Australian National Football League (SANFL) club Port Adelaide, the team his father Wayne played for, and was drafted by the Melbourne Football Club at the beginning of the 2001 AFL season. He won the club&#x27;s Most Improved Player award in 2001, and became a regular in the side, playing a total of 40 games over his three seasons.

Broadbridge&#x27;s first and last AFL games were both against – he made his debut in Round 8, 2001, in the teams&#x27; first meeting since the 2000 Grand Final, while his last league game was also against Essendon, in the 2004 elimination final. On both occasions, Melbourne lost. His final game of football at any level was in the 2004 premiership team of Melbourne&#x27;s , Sandringham.

==Marriage and death==
Broadbridge married Trisha Silvers on 18 December 2004. On 26 December, while spending their honeymoon in the Phi Phi Islands, Thailand, he drowned after being swept out to sea by the tsunami that followed the Indian Ocean earthquake, but Silvers survived. His father located his body in a Thai morgue on 3 January 2005.

==Legacy==
Trisha wrote a book about the events, &quot;Beyond The Wave&quot;, and was named as the 2006 Young Australian of the Year for her volunteer work for various charities, including building a school on Phi Phi named in Troy Broadbridge&#x27;s honour.

In Melbourne&#x27;s first match of the 2005 season, played against Essendon, the Demons all wore black armbands with number 20 sported on them in memory of Broadbridge. The Demons won that game and dedicated the win to him and his widow, Trisha. Broadbridge&#x27;s number 20 guernsey was retired for the following two seasons (2005–2006), and it was revived in 2007 by new player Colin Garland.

Since 2007, the Troy Broadbridge Memorial Trophy has been awarded to any Melbourne-listed player that accumulates the most votes for the club&#x27;s VFL affiliate.

Melbourne captain Max Gawn paid tribute to Broadbridge, among other deceased club identities, in a post-match interview upon the club winning the 2021 AFL Grand Final.

<text>Yessentuki () is a city in Stavropol Krai, Russia, located in the shadow of Mount Elbrus at the base of the Caucasus Mountains. The city serves as a railway station in the Mineralnye Vody—Kislovodsk branch, and is located southwest of Mineralnye Vody and west of Pyatigorsk. The city is renowned for its mineral springs and therapeutic spas, and is part of the Caucasian Mineral Waters region.

It is considered the cultural capital of Russia&#x27;s Greek population and close to ten percent of its population is of Greek descent. Population: 

==History==
Research by the Soviet archaeologist M.E. Masson and excavations of eight mausoleums showed that there was a large Golden Horde settlement near the present-day Essentuki in the 13th-15th centuries. Masson believed that the name Essentuki came from the name of a certain Khan Essentug from the names &quot;Yesan Forest&quot; and &quot;Yesan Field&quot; that have survived to this day.

In 1798, the Russian military and border redoubt of Yessentuksky was laid on the right bank of the Bolshoy Yessentuchok River, near its confluence with the Podkumok River. After the construction of the Kislovodsk fortress in 1803, the redoubt was abolished, and only the Cossack post was kept on its site.

The mineral waters of Yessentuki were first probed in 1810 by the Moscow doctor Fyodor Gaaz. Gaaz found two small wells with salty water (the present Gaazo-Ponomaryovsky spring) in the valley of the stream of Kislusha, about northeast of the Yessentuksky post. A detailed study of Bugunta mineral waters (the original name of the waters, after the Bugunta River flowing nearby) was made in 1823 by the Russian doctor and pharmacologist A. P. Nelyubin, who found twenty more mineral springs on the slopes of the mountain he referred to as Shchelochnaya (Nelyubin&#x27;s numbering of the Yessentuki mineral waters is still maintained). In 1825, General Yermolov founded the &quot;stanitsa&quot; of Yessentukskaya on the Bugunta River northeast of the former Yessentuksky post; its inhabitants were engaged in trade, trucking, and serving arriving patients. In 1839, water from springs ##23-26 was led to the common pool, where the first two baths of the wooden bathhouse were built at the expense of the Cossack Regiment Management.

Since 1840, springs ##4 and 17 have come into use and become especially popular. Yessentuki was recognized as one of the best health resorts for treatment of the digestive organs. In 1846, Prince Mikhail Vorontsov, the &quot;namestnik&quot; (vicegerent) of Caucasus, ordered to extend the territory of the &quot;stanitsa&quot; of Yessentukskaya to the northeast to approach the springs. Since then, Buguntinskiye mineral waters were referred to as Yessentukskiye. In 1847, some grounds closely adjacent to the springs were transferred to the newly established state Management of Waters in Pyatigorsk. In the late 1840s, bottling of Yessentuki waters and their dispatch to other cities of the country began. By the early 1870s, regular sale of the water was carried out in most of the large Russian cities. Construction of the Rostov-on-Don–Mineralnye Vody railway in 1875 and the Mineralnye Vody–Kislovodsk highway (via Pyatigorsk and Yessentuki) contributed to increase in the number of guests coming to Yessentuki for treatment. In 1883, the resort was visited by about 5,000 people; in 1900, by more than 13,000; in 1913, by 38,000. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, medical establishments, hotels, and summer residences were intensively built. In 1902, a seventy-bed sanatorium for the poor, the first one within the Caucasian Mineral Water system, was opened; in a year, the first departmental twenty-bed sanatorium for postal workers was built. In 1905, drilling of holes resulted in discovery of new springs (main spout of spring #17, new discharges of the water similar to the one of spring #4).

In 1917, the resort area was separated from the &quot;stanitsa&quot; of Yessentukskaya and was granted town status. During the Russian Civil War, resort facilities of Yessentuki fell into decay. Restoration work began only in 1920. In 1922, the clinical branch of Pyatigorsk Balneal Institute (the present Pyatigorsk Research Institute of Balneology and Physiotherapy) was opened. In 1925, the health resort operated six sanatoria and treated the total of about 13,000 patients. During the Great Patriotic War of 1941–1945, the health resort was heavily damaged by Nazi occupation from August 10, 1942 to January 11, 1943 and was restored at the end of the 1940s.

In 1991, Yessentuki provided rest and treatment for more than 217,000 patients. In 1991, the health resort operated twenty-five sanatoria, including ten belonging to the trade unions; the number of beds totaled over 10,000. It also provided outpatient treatment and board and treatment authorization. Service of guests involved such facilities as a resort polyclinic with aerosun rooms and climatic pavilions; a therapeutic mud bath; three bathhouses: Nizhniye (lower) baths (50 baths), Verkhniye (upper) baths (90 baths), and a new bathhouse (110 baths); 4 drinking galleries and well-rooms of springs ##4 and 17; an inhalatorium shared by all the resorts; a department of mechanotherapy, applying special techniques of therapeutic physical training.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as the city of krai significance of Yessentuki—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of krai significance of Yessentuki is incorporated as Yessentuki Urban Okrug.

==Mineral springs==
Of all mineral springs of Yessentuki, about twenty are of medical value. Sodium carbonic hydrocarbonate-chloride (i.e. salt-alkaline) water of springs #4 and #17, which have made the health resort popular, are the most famous and therapeutically valuable. The hot springs (35.5°–46 °C) similar to the waters of springs #4 and #17 in their structure have been led to the surface in the vicinities of the village of Novoblagodarnoye ( north of Yessentuki). The water of springs #4 and #17 and their analogues are used for peroral treatment. Carbonic hydrogen-sulphide water of holes #1 and #2, as well as calcium-sodium hydrosulphuric sulphate-hydrocarbonate (the so-called sulphur-alkaline) water of the Gaazo-Ponomarevsky spring are used for baths, lavages, inhalations and other balneotherapeutic procedures. Calcium-magnesium sulphate-hydrocarbonate water of spring #20 is used for baths. The water of springs #4 and #17 is bottled by a local bottler as a healing water (#17) and as a healing table water (#4) under the name of &quot;Yessentuki&quot;.

Alongside mineral waters, the medical establishments of Yessentuki use sulphide silt muds of Tambukan Lake ( southeast of Pyatigorsk). Besides, climatotherapy, electrochromophototherapy, etc. are widely used. The health resort specialises in treatment of patients with diseases of digestion organs as well as those with metabolic disorder.

==Economy==
The town has food-processing enterprises (a cannery, a dairy factory, a brewery, a meat-processing plant, etc.), a knitting mill, a clothes and a shoe factory.

==Points of interest==
The oldest architectural monument of Yessentuki is the wooden St. Nicholas&#x27; Church (built in the mid-1820s, presumably by the architects Giovanni and Giuseppe Bernardacci) in the centre of the former stanitsa. The orthogonal lay-out of the town, dating back to the middle of the 19th century, and a regular residential building-up of the second half of the 19th and the early 20th centuries, have been preserved here, in the southern end of Yessentuki. The resort area is to the north-east of the stanitsa part of Yessentuki. Its core is the extensive Kurortny (Glavny) Park (planted mostly with ash, oak, hornbeam, chestnut, maple, poplar, linden, etc., decorative bushes, flowers), laid in 1849, with springs of mineral water and numerous constructions: the building of the drinking gallery (1847–1856, architect S. Upton, Moresque style), the Nikolayevskiye (the present Verkhniye) baths (1899, architects N. V. Dmitriyev and B. V. Pravzdik), the Commercial gallery (1912, architect Y. F. Shreter, neo-classicism; the present Electroheliotherapy Institute), the wooden observation pavilion with colonnade referred to as Oreanda (1912), four pavilions above drinking well-rooms (1912–1913, architect N. N. Semyonov, neo-classicism), etc. The majority of sanatoriums and boarding houses are concentrated around Glavny Park. The area to the north of the Park (between the latter and the railway line) was developed since the end of the 19th century as a zone for private sanatoriums, villas (Orlinoye gnezdo, 1912–14, Art Nouveau), and resort constructions; the monumental building of the therapeutic mud bath in the spirit of ancient Roman thermae decorated with a mighty Ionic portico and numerous sculptures (1913–1915, architect Shreter, sculptors L. A. Ditrikh and Vasily Kozlov). In 1903, the Angliysky Park was laid out behind the railway line.

The main area of modern industrial and residential building is the so-called Novye Yessentuki. Among the significant structures of the middle of the 20th century are four solemn entrances to the Kurortny Park (mid-1950s, architect P. P. Yeskov), the drinking gallery of spring No. 4 (1967, architect V. N. Fuklev), the Ukraina sanatorium (1972), etc.

==Climate==
The climate is moderately continental. Winter is mild, with thaws; the temperature in January averages to ; severe frosts sometimes take place; mists are frequent. Spring is short, sometimes the weather is cool, rainy (mostly in April). Summer is warm, with a large number of hot and dry days; the temperature in July averages to . Fall is warm and lasting; the temperature in September averages to about 15-20 °C. Precipitations of about a year. A large number of clear, sunny days (280 a year on average) is typical. The open position in the east and in the west makes Yessentuki accessible for winds prevailing here: dry eastern ones, which are hot in summer and cold in winter; and wet south-west ones, cool in summer and warm in winter.

==Notable people==
Fast growth of the Yessentuki health resort in the last third of the 19th and the early 20th centuries attracted famous representatives of Russian culture, including the writers Vladimir Korolenko, Aleksandr Kuprin, Maxim Gorky and Konstantin Balmont; the composers Sergei Taneyev, Sergei Rachmaninoff and Sergei Prokofiev; the singer Feodor Chaliapin; and the theatrical figures Maria Savina, Vera Komissarzhevskaya and Konstantin Stanislavsky.

Boris Petrovsky, a well-known surgeon and long-term Soviet health minister, was a native of Yessentuki.

<text>Eufrosinia Antonovna Kersnovskaya (; 8 January 1908 – 8 March 1994) was a Russian woman who spent 12 years in Gulag camps and wrote her memoirs in 12 notebooks, 2,200,000 characters, accompanied with 680 pictures.

She wrote three copies of the work. In 1968, friends typed samizdat copies, repeating the pictures on the back sides of the sheets. Excerpts from the work were first published in &quot;Ogonyok&quot; and &quot;Znamya&quot; magazines in 1990, as well as in &quot;The Observer&quot; (June 1990). After that, German and French publications followed. In 2001 the complete text, in six volumes, was published in Russia.

== Biography ==

Eufrosinia Kersnovskaya was born in Odessa to a family of Russian gentry. During the Russian Civil War the family moved to their estate in Bessarabia to become farmers. Bessarabia was soon united with Romania.

In 1940, Bessarabia was annexed by the Soviet Union, and the Kersnovskaya family (Eufrosinia and her mother) were oppressed as former landowners. In June 1941 she was deported to Siberia as an exile settler (ссыльнопоселенец) to work as a logger.

In 1942 she attempted to escape, but was recaptured and sentenced to death. She refused to ask for clemency and wrote on a sheet of paper provided to her for this purpose: &quot;I cannot demand justice, I do not want to ask for mercy&quot;. Kernovskaya&#x27;s death sentence was nevertheless commuted to 10 years of labor camps, which she spent in the Norillag (Норильлаг, Norilsk labor camp) at mining works.

After the discharge in 1953 she lived in Yessentuki and wrote her memoirs during 1964–1968, which were published only in 1990.

Her memoirs are illustrated by hundreds of drawings of life in the Gulag. They are also remarkable for the quality of the drawings.

<doc id="1343030" wikidata="Q381443" url="?curid=1343030" title="Tarjei Vesaas">
<text>Tarjei Vesaas (20 August 1897 – 15 March 1970) was a Norwegian poet and novelist. Vesaas is widely considered to be one of Norway&#x27;s greatest writers of the twentieth century and perhaps its most important since World War II.

Vesaas&#x27; work is characterized by simple, terse, and symbolic prose. His stories often feature rural people who go through severe psychological changes. These works are characterized by their usage of the demanding Norwegian landscape and themes such as guilt and death. His mastery of the Nynorsk language has contributed to its acceptance as a medium of world class literature.

A prolific author, he won a number of awards, including the Gyldendal&#x27;s Endowment in 1943 and the Dobloug Prize in 1957. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature on 57 occasions (once in 1946, and often multiple times every year between 1950 and 1970).

His novels have been translated into 28 languages. Several of his books have been translated into English—many of them published by Peter Owen Publishers—among them &quot;Spring Night&quot;, &quot;The Birds,&quot; &quot;Through Naked Branches,&quot; and &quot;The Ice Palace&quot;.

==Biography==
Vesaas was born on 20 August 1897 in Vinje, Telemark, Norway to Olav Vesaas (1870–1951), a farmer and Signe Øygarden (1870–1953), a teacher. He was the oldest of three sons, and was guilt-ridden by his refusal to take over the family farm which had been in the family for almost 300 years. He was forced to leave school at fourteen, and never had any higher education except for a year at Voss Folk High School from 1917 to 1918. Lars Eskeland, Vesaas&#x27; teacher at Voss Folk, translated some of Rabindranath Tagore&#x27;s writings; these later influenced Vesaas&#x27; writing style.

He spent much of his youth in solitude, seeking comfort and solace in nature. He married the writer Halldis Moren Vesaas (the daughter of Sven Moren and the sister of Sigmund Moren) and moved to Midtbø in his home district of Vinje in 1934. They had two children: a son, Olav Vesaas and a daughter, Guri Vesaas.

== Career ==
=== Early writing (1923–1933) ===
Vesaas&#x27; early writing focused on the neo-romantic tradition, with prominent religious sentiments. These early works had many authorial influences, including Rabindranath Tagore; Rudyard Kipling; Selma Lagerlöf, especially her &quot;Gösta Berling&#x27;s Saga&quot;; Knut Hamsun, particularly his neo-romantic novels, &quot;Pan&quot; and &quot;Victoria&quot;; Henrik Ibsen; and Hans E. Kinck. The poems of Edith Södergran caused him to shift more towards the free verse form; Olav Aukrust, Olav Nygard, and Olaf Bull were also poetic inspirations.

Vesaas sold his first short stories to a magazine in the early 1920s. His first attempt at writing a novel was rejected by publishers, and thrown onto a fire. His debut was in 1923 with &quot;Menneskebonn&quot; (&quot;Children of Man&quot;). The novel tells the story of a boy who loses his parents and lover, yet still believes in the importance of being good. A year later, his second novel &quot;Huskuld the Herald&quot; was published, which tells the story of a village eccentric whose final years are brightened when he befriends a young child abandoned by his mother. In 1925 and 1926, Vesaas&#x27; novels &quot;Grindegard: Morgonen&quot; (&quot;Grinde Farm&quot;) and &quot;Grinde‐kveld, eller Den gode engelen&quot; (&quot;Evening at Grinde&quot;, &quot;or The Good Angel&quot;) were published.

Vesaas&#x27; first successful novel came with the release of &quot;Dei svarte hestane&quot; (&quot;The Black Horses&quot;) in 1928, after his previous works were adversely criticized. It also marked the increase in realism and contemporary awareness in Vesaas&#x27; novels. The next year, Vesaas published his first short story collection, &quot;Klokka i haugen&quot; (&quot;The Bell in the Mound&quot;), which contained seven stories written expressly for the collection. It was the first of his books to be translated into another language.

In 1930, Vesaas published &quot;Fars reise&quot; (&quot;Father&#x27;s Journey&quot;), the first in a tetralogy focusing on protagonist Klas Dyregodt. The second and third books in the series, &quot;Sigrid Stallbrokk&quot; and &quot;Dei ukjende mennene&quot; (&quot;The Unknown Men&quot;), were published in 1931 and 1932, respectively. Although it was originally intended as a trilogy, the final novel in the series, &quot;Hjarta høyrer sine heimlandstonar&quot; (&quot;The Heart Hears Its Native Music&quot;), was published six years later in 1938. It has a much lighter tone than the first three novels.

In 1933, Vesaas&#x27; novel &quot;Sandeltreet&quot; (&quot;The Sandalwood&quot;) was published. The book was written over the course of a few weeks in the summer of 1933 after Vesaas&#x27; last trip abroad. It focuses on a pregnant woman who believes she will not survive the delivery process, so she goes on a journey to experience as much of life as possible.

=== Literary breakthrough and success (1934–1939) ===
Vesaas&#x27; breakthrough was in 1934 with &quot;The Great Cycle&quot; (&quot;Det store spelet&quot;), which was praised by contemporary critics. The sequel, &quot;Kvinnor ropar heim&quot; (&quot;Women Call Home&quot;), was published a year later, in 1935.

Also in 1934, Vesaas&#x27; second play &quot;Ultimatum&quot; was published; it was primarily written two years earlier in September 1932 in Strasbourg. &quot;Ultimatum&quot; focuses on the reactions of a group of young people just before a war breaks out. It features a flashing neon sign, adapted from the stage effects Vesaas had seen while traveling in Germany. The play was inspired by Vesaas&#x27; frightened reaction to German soldiers marching and holding swastikas. It was not well received by Norwegian audiences when it was first performed at Det Norske Teatret in Oslo.

Two years later saw the publication of Vesaas&#x27; second short story collection, &quot;Leiret og hjulet&quot; (&quot;The Clay and the Wheel&quot;). Most of the stories deal with the aspects of rural life.

=== Experimentation (1940–1956) ===
Vesaas&#x27; novel &quot;Kimen&quot; (&quot;The Seed&quot;) is frequently seen as a dividing line between his earlier realistic novels and his later, more symbolic and experimental works. Vesaas stated, &quot;Among my books &quot;The Seed&quot; stands as a dividing line. It wasn&#x27;t planned that way, but something so horrifying and unbelievable had happened that it simply brought with it a new way of writing. ... Some sort of new way of reacting to things.&quot; The novel was written in the summer of 1940 during the first few months of the German occupation of Norway.

In the winter and spring of 1945, Vesaas wrote his next novel, &quot;Huset i mørkret&quot; (&quot;The House in the Dark&quot;), an allegorical novel about the German occupation and the Norwegian resistance movement during the Second World War. Due to the dangers of owning the manuscript, it was hidden away in a zinc box until the end of the occupation in May 1945. The book was published in the autumn later that year. &quot;Kjeldene&quot; (&quot;The Springs&quot;), Vesaas&#x27; first poetry collection, was published in 1946. In 1931, Vesaas&#x27; wife Halldis Moren gave him a poetry collection by Edith Södergran; these inspired Vesaas to begin writing poetry himself. His initial attempts were unsuccessful, causing him to turn away from poetry. However, fourteen years later, his passion for poetry reemerged, and he wrote &quot;The Springs&quot;.

Also in 1946, Vesaas&#x27; novel &quot;Bleikeplassen&quot; (&quot;The Bleaching Place&quot;), was published. The book is an extensively reworked version of his unpublished play &quot;Vaskehuset,&quot; which he had withdrawn from its public premiere six years earlier. A year later, his second poetry collection, &quot;Leiken og lynet&quot; (&quot;The Game and the Lightning&quot;), was published. The collection marked the first time free verse dominated in Vesaas&#x27; poetry, largely due to Södergran&#x27;s poetic influence.

In 1948, his novel &quot;Tårnet&quot; (&quot;The Tower&quot;) was published. Both &quot;Bleikeplassen&quot; and &quot;Tårnet&quot; were written before &quot;Huset i mørkret&quot; but published later because of the German occupation. &quot;Lykka for ferdesmenn&quot; (&quot;Wanderers&#x27; Happiness&quot;), Vesaas&#x27; third poetry collection, was published in 1949.

Vesaas&#x27; novel &quot;Signalet&quot; (&quot;The Signal&quot;) was published in 1950. The novel, set in a train station, focuses on a group of people waiting for the signal to leave, but it will never come. The book has been described as similar to the works of Franz Kafka and Samuel Beckett due to its surrealism, allegory, and mood. Vesaas&#x27; third short story collection, &quot;Vindane&quot; (&quot;The Winds&quot;), featuring thirteen stories, was published in 1952. The following year, Vesaas won the Venice Triennale Prize for the collection. &quot;Vårnatt&quot; (&quot;Spring Night&quot;), Vesaas&#x27; next novel, was published in 1954.

Two years later, &quot;Ver ny, vår draum&quot; (&quot;May Our Dream Stay New&quot;) was published; it was the last poetry collection to be published in Vesaas&#x27; lifetime.

=== Later works (1957–1970) ===
The most famous of his works are &quot;The Ice Palace (Is-slottet)&quot;, a story of two girls who build a profoundly strong relationship, and &quot;The Birds (Fuglane)&quot;, a story of an adult of a simple childish mind, which through his tenderhearted empathy and imagination bears the role of a seer or writer. He was awarded the Nordic Council&#x27;s Literature Prize in 1963 for &quot;The Ice Palace.&quot;

Vesaas&#x27; fourth and final short story collection, &quot;Ein vakker dag&quot; (&quot;A Lovely Day&quot;), was published in 1959. The stories in the collection primarily deal with everyday events. His penultimate novel, &quot;Bruene&quot; (&quot;The Bridges&quot;), was published in 1968. Two years later, his final novel, &quot;Båten om Kvelden&quot; (&quot;The Boat in the Evening&quot;) was published. The book consists of lyrical sketches which often, according to scholar Kenneth G. Chapman, eliminates &quot;the distinction between prose and poetry.&quot;

His final poetry collection, &quot;Liv ved straumen&quot; (&quot;Life by the Stream&quot;), was released posthumously in 1970. It is generally considered his best collection.

<doc id="1343032" wikidata="Q6571459" url="?curid=1343032" title="List of Friends schools">
<text>Friends schools are institutions that provide an education based on the beliefs and testimonies of the Religious Society of Friends, known as Quakers. 

Friends schools vary greatly, both in their interpretation of Quaker principles and in how they relate to formal organizations that make up the Society of Friends. Most Friends schools are similar in their mission however: to provide an academically sound education while also instilling values of community, spirituality, responsibility and stewardship in their students.

Some institutions founded by Friends were never formally &quot;Quaker schools&quot;. Some historically Friends institutions are no longer formally associated with the Society of Friends. Those that continue to call themselves &quot;Quaker schools&quot; may have formal oversight from a Friends yearly or monthly meetings (often called coming &quot;under care of&quot; a meeting), and others are governed by members of the Society of Friends and/or adhere to aspects of Quaker practice.

Because of the wide range of Friends, the branch (or branches) of Quakerism with which the school affiliates are included, and where applicable the Yearly, Quarterly or Monthly Meeting under whose care or governance the school is held is shown.

The following is a list of schools currently or historically associated with the Society of Friends, regardless of their current degree of affiliation:

==Australia==

<doc id="1343044" wikidata="Q516231" url="?curid=1343044" title="Minilla">
<text>is a fictional monster, or kaiju who first appeared in Toho&#x27;s 1967 film &quot;Son of Godzilla&quot;. He is the adopted son of Godzilla, and is sometimes referenced as Minya, Godzilla Jr., and Baby Godzilla in the American dubbed versions.

==Overview==
===Development===
According to director Jun Fukuda, Minilla&#x27;s creation was not an attempt at appealing to child audiences, but was merely a new approach for the series. After filming &quot;Ebirah, Horror of the Deep&quot;, Godzilla creator Tomoyuki Tanaka reportedly approached screenwriter Shinichi Sekizawa and suggested the idea of giving Godzilla a son to commemorate the New Year. According to Godzilla historian Steve Ryfle, the character&#x27;s creation was likely a response to the contemporary light-hearted Gamera films.

===Shōwa era (1967–1969)===
In his debut film, &quot;Son of Godzilla&quot;, Minilla was born on Sollgel Island, when his egg was prematurely cracked open by a group of mutant giant mantises called Kamacuras. Godzilla soon arrived, killed two of the Kamacuras, and rescued Minilla. Godzilla proceeded to train Minilla and defended him against further attacks from the final Kamacuras and the giant spider Kumonga. Godzilla and Minilla were placed in hibernation when a group of scientists completed a weather experiment, resulting in the freezing of their island. The monsters were revived when the snow melted, and eventually relocated to Monster Island, as seen via stock footage in &quot;Godzilla vs. Gigan&quot;.

In &quot;Destroy All Monsters&quot;, Minilla, Godzilla, and many other Earth monsters live on a new island called Monsterland. Together, they battle King Ghidorah summoned by Kilaaks at Mount Fuji. They kill Ghidorah and save planet Earth from Kilaaks. After, Minilla and the other monsters return to Monsterland.

===Millennium era (2004)===
In &quot;&quot;, Minilla accompanies Kenta and Samon Taguchi on an adventure around Japan after he was found by them in Aokigahara during Xillien invasion. During Godzilla battles Xillien-controlled Rodan, Anguirus and King Caesar, he grows about half size of his father. Minilla arrives at ruined Tokyo after Godzilla defeated Keizer Ghidorah and convinced his father to forgive mankind for their sins. In the end, Minilla bids farewell to Kenta, Samon and Gotengo&#x27;s crew and leaves with Godzilla into the ocean.

===Other===
The children&#x27;s web-series &quot;Godziban&quot; has Minilla and Little Godzilla (who now goes by simply &#x27;Little&#x27;) co-existing as Godzilla&#x27;s kid brothers, embarking on many misadventures while Godzilla tries to teach them important monster skills.

In &quot;Chibi Godzilla Raids Again&quot;, a genderbend version of Minilla is depicted as Chibi Godzilla&#x27;s younger sister.

<text>Chinesisch-Deutsches Hochschulkolleg () is the Chinese German College for Postgraduate Studies affiliated with Tongji University located in Shanghai, China.

==History==

The idea to combine educational activities in a joint Chinese-German university college for postgraduate studies dates back to the visit of former German chancellor Dr. Helmut Kohl in November 1993. Negotiations between China and Germany started in 1994, and in the following year the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) was assigned the realization of this project.

The Shanghai &quot;Chinesisch-Deutsches Hochschulkolleg&quot; or CDHK, as the college for postgraduate studies is called for short, was finally opened in February 1998. On October 7, 2002, the college moved into new modern building in Chifeng Lu.

==Objectives==

As an institute at Tongji University, the CDHK today offers bilingual master studies in the following fields:
*electrical engineering (automation, information technology)
*mechanical engineering (production engineering, automotive engineering)
*economics (supply chain management, marketing, financial management, economic law, actuarial science)

According to German educational standards, the curriculum is oriented towards broad knowledge and practical experience. Thus, the CDHK is able to train junior staff with both leadership qualities and experience in two cultures for the benefit of Chinese and German companies in China.

==Course of studies==

The postgraduate studies at CDHK take three years and start with intensive German language training in the first semester. From the second to the third semester students proceed their language studies in addition to their respective field studies and will attend a language test. As an end of the German language training course, all the students are obliged to take a middle-level German test and received a German language certificate issued by German College of Tongji University.

The students attend classes of Chinese professors who themselves have studied in Germany for a considerable time or finished their PhD at a German university. Moreover, each semester CDHK invites German tutors for one or two weeks to hold German language lectures in their respective fields. Basically all the courses are co-conducted by Chinese and German Professors.

===Double Masters Program===
In the fourth semester students have the chance to go to Germany for an internship in a company and/or study at one of its partner universities. In the later case, students must have passed TestDAF, a German language test, with at least a score of 16(on a 20 scale). In electro technics there even is the chance to prepare for an international final degree at the Technical University of Munich, the so-called &quot;double master&quot; program. In the year of 2008, this &quot;double master &quot; program was extended to the students of mechanical engineering with the partner university of Ruhr-University Bochum This program is sponsored partially by DAAD. Several graduates already work on their PhD either in Germany or China.

==Perspectives==

The Chinese-German College for Postgraduate Studies is sponsored by Tongji-University and the DAAD as well as by numerous companies that have among others donated eighteen chairs and support the project by presentation, visits and contacts. It is the first educational joint-venture of this dimension, enjoying the support of both governments, and has the advantage of the close cooperation with its entrepreneurial sponsors.

Born and raised in Albany, New York, Gregory Maguire is the youngest of four children born to Helen and John Maguire. His mother died from complications suffered giving birth to him, which prompted his father to send him to live with an aunt. His aunt relinquished him to a local orphanage when he was six months old. He was reclaimed from the orphanage at age two, after his father&#x27;s remarriage. Maguire has three half-siblings from his father&#x27;s second marriage.

Schooled in Catholic institutions through high school, he received a BA degree in English from the State University of New York at Albany in 1976, an MA degree in children&#x27;s literature from Simmons College in 1978, and a PhD in English and American literature from Tufts University in 1990, with his dissertation titled &quot;Themes in English Language Fantastic Literature for Children, 1938-1988&quot;.

In 1978, at the age of 24, Maguire published his first novel, &quot;The Lightning Time&quot;. Around the same time, he began to realize he was gay. He was a professor and co-director at the Simmons College Center for the Study of Children&#x27;s Literature from 1979 to 1986. In 1987, Maguire co-founded a nonprofit educational charity, Children&#x27;s Literature New England, Inc., and was co-director for twenty-five years. He has lived in Dublin, London, and the greater Boston area.

In 1995, Maguire published his first adult novel, &quot;Wicked: the Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West&quot;. A word of mouth success, it sold 500,000 copies by the time the Broadway adaptation opened in 2003. In 2005, ten years after its publication, &quot;Wicked&quot; spent 26 weeks on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list.

== Personal life ==
Maguire met American painter Andy Newman in 1997 at the Blue Mountain Center, an artists&#x27; and writers&#x27; colony. Within a month of meeting, they had fallen in love. They adopted three children: Luke and Alex, originally from Cambodia, and Helen, originally from Guatemala. Maguire and Newman were married in June 2004, shortly after same-sex marriage became legal in Massachusetts. They have lived in Concord, Massachusetts since 1999. On April 13, 2009, Maguire and his family were featured on &quot;Oprah&quot;. 

Maguire is a practicing Catholic.

<doc id="1343066" wikidata="Q332967" url="?curid=1343066" title="Sino-Albanian split">
<text>The Sino-Albanian split was the gradual worsening of relations between the People&#x27;s Socialist Republic of Albania and the People&#x27;s Republic of China in the period 1972–1978.

Both countries had supported each other in the Albanian–Soviet and Chinese–Soviet splits, together declaring the necessity of defending Marxism–Leninism against what they regarded as Soviet revisionism within the international communist movement. By the early 1970s, however, Albanian disagreements with certain aspects of Chinese policy deepened as the visit of Nixon to China along with the Chinese announcement of the &quot;Three Worlds Theory&quot; produced strong apprehension in Albania&#x27;s leadership under Enver Hoxha. Hoxha saw in these events an emerging Chinese alliance with American imperialism and abandonment of proletarian internationalism. In 1978, China broke off its trade relations with Albania, signalling an end to the informal alliance which had existed between the two states.

==Origins==
In September 1956, Enver Hoxha headed a delegation of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania (PLA) at the 8th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party. Writing years later of his impressions of the country before the visit, he noted that:
Khrushchev&#x27;s rehabilitation of Josip Broz Tito and the Yugoslavia and his &quot;Secret Speech&quot; denouncing Joseph Stalin in February 1956 put the Soviet leadership at odds with its Albanian counterpart. According to the Albanians, the &quot;Khrushchev group&#x27;s approaches to the Yugoslav revisionists and its open denigration of Joseph Stalin were the first open distortions of an ideological and political character, which were opposed by the PLA.&quot; After arriving in Beijing on September 13, Hoxha held his first (and only) meeting with Mao Zedong in between sessions of the party&#x27;s congress. Mao&#x27;s first two questions concerned Yugoslav-Albanian ties and the Albanians&#x27; opinion on Stalin. Hoxha replied that Albania&#x27;s relations with Yugoslavia were &quot;cold&quot; and he gave Mao &quot;a brief outline, dwelling on some of the key moments of the anti-Albanian and anti-Marxist activity of the Yugoslav leadership.&quot; On the subject of Stalin, Hoxha stated that the Party of Labour considered him &quot;a leader of very great, all-round merits, a loyal disciple of Lenin and continuer of his work.&quot; Mao argued that the 1948 Information Bureau decision to expel Yugoslavia was incorrect, and also stressed what he considered to have been Stalin&#x27;s mistakes in regard to China.

Hoxha later recalled that 

According to Hoxha, Mao at the 1957 International Conference of the Communist and Workers&#x27; Parties declared that, &quot;If Stalin were here, we would find it difficult to speak like this. When I met Stalin, before him I felt like a pupil in front of his teacher, while with Comrade Khrushchev we speak freely like equal comrades&quot; and condemned the &quot;Anti-Party Group&quot; of Molotov and others. Hoxha also claimed that Mao expressed regret that the Yugoslavs refused to attend the conference, with Mao speaking of those &quot;who are 100 per cent Marxists, and others who are 80 per cent, 70 per cent or 50 per cent, indeed there are some who may be only 10 per cent Marxists. We ought to talk even with those who are 10 per cent Marxists, because there are only advantages in this. Why should we not gather, two or three of us, in a small room and talk things over? Why should we not talk, proceeding from the desire for unity?&quot; In Hoxha&#x27;s view the refusal of the Yugoslavs to attend, as well as both Soviet and Chinese desires to enhance their prestige in the world communist movement in response to events over the previous year, produced a situation where &quot;the 1957 Moscow Declaration [resulting from the Conference], in general, was a good document&quot; owing to its emphasis on opposing revisionism, which both the Soviets and Chinese found advantageous to stress at the time.

According to William E. Griffith, the Chinese position on international affairs had begun to shift to the left owing to deepening contradictions with the Soviet Union and the failure of the Hundred Flowers Campaign at home. &quot;Only when the Chinese decided, in 1957 and openly in 1960, to challenge Soviet domination of the [communist] bloc did they seriously look around for allies whom they were ready and willing to support.&quot; By 1960 the Albanians found themselves in ideological agreement with the Chinese, as Elez Biberaj notes: &quot;The Chinese had criticized Khrushchev for his rapprochement with Tito, and considered the toleration of Yugoslav &#x27;revisionism&#x27; dangerous to the entire communist bloc... Although the seeds of the Sino-Soviet conflict were sown during Stalin&#x27;s time, policy differences between Beijing and Moscow emerged during the mid- and the late 1950s, coinciding with the deterioration of Albanian-Soviet relations.&quot; The Chinese found the Albanians useful owing to their hostility to perceived Soviet revisionism, with Albanian articles on the subject being reprinted in the Chinese media.

In November 1960 the Second International Conference of the Communist and Workers&#x27; Parties was to be held, and a Commission was created in October to prepare for it. The Albanian delegation headed by Hysni Kapo and the Chinese delegation headed by Deng Xiaoping, however, were at odds; Kapo&#x27;s speech to the Commission criticized the Soviet handling of the Bucharest Conference and its attacks on China, whereas Deng stated that, &quot;We are not going to speak about all the issues... We are not going to use such terms as &#x27;opportunist&#x27;, or &#x27;revisionist&#x27;, etc.&quot; Neither Kapo nor Ramiz Alia (another member of the delegation) felt this stand was correct, with Hoxha sending letters to the delegation calling Deng&#x27;s speeches &quot;spineless&quot; and further replying that, &quot;They are not for carrying the matter through to the end... They are for mending what can be mended, and time will mend the rest... If I were in the Soviets&#x27; shoes, I would accept the field which the Chinese are opening to me, because there I will find good grass and can browse at will.&quot; Alia thus wrote that on the subject of principles, &quot;The Chinese were concerned only about the [Soviet] &#x27;conductor&#x27;s baton&#x27;, which they wanted to break. They went no further.&quot;

Nonetheless, Hoxha recalled years later that, concerning the breakdown in relations between China and the Soviet Union, &quot;we were quite clear that [the Soviets] did not proceed from principled positions in the accusations they were making against the Chinese party. As became even clearer later, the differences were over a series of matters of principle which, at that time, the Chinese seemed to maintain correct stands. Both in the official speeches of the Chinese leaders and in their published articles, especially in the one entitled &#x27;Long Live Leninism&#x27;, the Chinese party treated the problems in a theoretically correct way and opposed the Khrushchevites.&quot; On this basis it defended the activity of the Communist Party of China at the Conference, &quot;it did so in full consciousness in order to defend the principles of Marxism-Leninism, and not to be given some factories and some tractors by China in return.&quot;

==1960s==

Griffith wrote in the early 60s that &quot;Albanian documents are notable for their tone of extreme violence and defiance. A remarkable combination of traditional Balkan fury and left-wing Marxist-Leninist fanaticism, the Albanian anti-Khrushchev polemics... were certainly much more extreme than the relatively moderate, flowery, and above all &#x27;correct&#x27; language in which the Chinese Communists have normally couched their most icy blasts against Moscow... It seems doubtful that Peking initiated or even necessarily approved the intensity and extent of the Albanian verbal violence... they quite possibly could not or did not feel it wise to restrain him.&quot; One author noted that &quot;Hoxha&#x27;s speech [to the November 1960 Conference] so vehemently denounced Khrushchev that even the Chinese delegates looked embarrassed.&quot;

With both states claiming that the Soviet leadership had betrayed Marxism–Leninism and was presiding over the restoration of capitalism in the USSR, &quot;China came to be perceived as having replaced the Soviet Union as the leader of the &#x27;anti-imperialist struggle.&#x27; This image was reinforced by the poor state of Beijing&#x27;s relations with the capitalist countries in general. ... The revolutionary spirit characterizing the Chinese society was highly regarded by the Albanian leadership, and was considered as an indication of the Marxist-Leninist character of the CCP and its policies. During the formative years of the alliance, Tiranë looked to Beijing as a center for the development of a new and &#x27;truly&#x27; Marxist-Leninist movement.&quot; In 1964 Zhou Enlai visited Albania and signed a joint statement which, among other things, stated that, &quot;Relations between socialist countries, big or small, economically more developed or less developed, must be based on the principles of complete equality... It is absolutely impermissible to impose the will of one country upon another, or to impair the independence, sovereignty and interests of the people, of a fraternal country on the pretext of &#x27;aid&#x27; or &#x27;international division of labor.&#x27;&quot;

The informal alliance between China and Albania was considered by Jon Halliday to be &quot;one of the oddest phenomena of modern times: here were two states of vastly differing size, thousands of miles apart, with almost no cultural ties or knowledge of each other&#x27;s society, drawn together by a common hostility to the Soviet Union.&quot; Biberaj wrote that it was unusual, &quot;a political rather than a military alliance&quot; without any formal treaty having been signed and &quot;lacking an organizational structure for regular consultations and policy coordination,&quot; being &quot;characterized by an informal relationship conducted on an ad hoc basis.&quot;

One early disagreement between the Chinese and Albanians concerned the character of the Soviet leadership and polemics against it. In July 1963 Hoxha wrote in his diary that, &quot;The Chinese are saying about Khrushchev today what Khrushchev said about Tito yesterday: &#x27;He is an enemy, a Trojan horse, but we must not let him go over to the enemy, must not let him capitulate, because there is the question of the peoples of Yugoslavia&#x27;, etc.&quot; and that &quot;we are not dealing with a person or a group that is making some mistakes, that in the middle of the road sees the disaster looming up ahead and turns back; in this case it would be essential to manoeuvre, without giving way on principles, &#x27;to prevent him from going over to the imperialists&#x27;. But with Khrushchev it is not at all in order, or correct, even to consider, let alone do such a thing. He has betrayed completely.&quot; The Chinese were reluctant to engage in public polemics with the Soviet leadership in 1961–63, stressing the need for a &quot;united front&quot; against the Americans and accordingly asking the Albanians to tone down their own polemics and ask for the restoration of diplomatic relations from the Soviet Union, with the Albanians taking offense to such views.

Another early disagreement between the Chinese and Albanians was over the subject of border disputes. Hoxha wrote in his diary in August 1964 that &quot;Chou En-lai raises with the Rumanians territorial claims against the Soviet Union. He accuses the Soviet Union (Lenin and Stalin because, this &#x27;robbery&#x27;, according to Chou En-lai, took place in their time) of having seized Chinese, Japanese, Polish, German, Czech, Rumanian, Finnish, and other territories. On the other hand, Chou En-lai tells the Rumanians that they are doing well to claim the territories which the Soviet Union has seized from them. These are not Marxist-Leninist, but national-chauvinist positions. Regardless of whether or not mistakes may have been made, to raise these things now, when we are faced, first of all, with the ideological struggle against modern revisionism, means not to fight Khrushchev, but on the contrary to assist him on his chauvinist course.&quot; In September that year the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania sent a letter to the CC of the CCP on the Sino-Soviet border dispute, stating that, &quot;Under the pressure of Khrushchev&#x27;s revisionist propaganda, under the influence of Khrushchev&#x27;s slanders and calumnies, and for many other reasons, the masses of the Soviet people will not understand why People&#x27;s China is now putting forth territorial claims to the Soviet Union, they will not accept this, and Soviet propaganda is working to make them revolt against you. But we think that even true Soviet communists will not understand it, nor will they accept it. This would be a colossal loss for our struggle.&quot; The CC of the CCP did not reply.

With the downfall of Khrushchev and rise of Leonid Brezhnev in October 1964 the Chinese called for the Party of Labour of Albania to join in supporting the new leadership &quot;in the struggle against the common enemy, imperialism.&quot; The Party of Labour felt that Brezhnev&#x27;s rise merely represented &quot;Khrushchevism without Khrushchev&quot; and in a letter to the CC of the CCP urged the continuation of polemics against the Soviet leadership, whereas the Chinese sought to get the Albanians to send a delegation to Moscow together with their own delegation headed by Zhou Enlai. Recalling this incident in 1968 Hoxha wrote that, &quot;Chou En-lai went to Moscow without us and there he suffered [an] ignominious defeat... Later we were told: &#x27;We made a mistake in going to Moscow and in proposing it to you, too&#x27;, etc., etc.&quot; Regardless of these and future differences between the two informal allies, the Albanians subsequently wrote that they &quot;supported China publicly... in the international arena for those stands of the Chinese side which were correct.&quot;

A constant irritant on the Albanian side was an inability to have regular contacts with the Chinese. Examining Hoxha&#x27;s two-volume &quot;Reflections on China&quot; (consisting of extracts from his political diary), Halliday writes that, 

In October 1966 Hoxha delivered a speech to a plenum of the CC of the Party of Labour titled &quot;Some Preliminary Ideas about the Chinese Proletarian Cultural Revolution,&quot; noting that, &quot;We have been informed about and have followed the recent developments in China only through the Chinese press and Hsinhua. The Communist Party of China and its Central Committee have not given our Party and its Central Committee any special comradely information. We think that as a party so closely linked with ours, it ought to have kept us better informed in an internationalist way, especially during these recent months.&quot; Hoxha analyzed the events in China in an overall negative fashion, criticizing among other things the fact that the CCP had not held a congress in ten years and that four years had gone by without a plenum of the CC being called, a practice which &quot;cannot be found in any Marxist-Leninist party.&quot; Hoxha said that &quot;the cult of Mao was raised to the skies in a sickening and artificial manner&quot; and further added that, in reading of its purported objectives, &quot;you have the impression that everything old in Chinese and world culture should be rejected without discrimination and a new culture, the culture they call proletarian, should be created.&quot; He further stated that, &quot;It is difficult for us to call this revolution, as the &#x27;Red Guards&#x27; are carrying it out, a Proletarian Cultural Revolution... the enemies could and should be captured by the organs of the dictatorship on the basis of the law, and if the enemies have wormed their way into the party committees, let them be purged through party channels. Or in the final analysis, arm the working class and attack the committees, but not with children.&quot;

The beginning of the Cultural Revolution coincided with the intensification of the Albanian Ideological and Cultural Revolution in the fields of culture, economics and politics, which unlike its Chinese counterpart was presented as &quot;a continuation and deepening of policies, programs, and efforts undertaken by Albania over a period of some twenty years,&quot; with other differences being that Hoxha&#x27;s presence was never given &quot;the symbolic and mystical stature in the Albanian revolution that Mao Tse-tung enjoyed in China,&quot; there was no inner-party factional struggle at the root of Albanian initiative, the Albanian army played no significant role in events, and there were no Albanian equivalents to the Red Guards nor was there an &quot;influx of supporters of the revolution from the provinces to Tiranë... no public purges, no turmoil in the State University of Tiranë or dislocations of the school system, and no damaging blow to the economy as a result of changes brought on by the revolution.&quot; The Albanians also resisted Chinese efforts to get them to praise &quot;Mao Zedong Thought&quot; as constituting a &quot;higher stage&quot; of Marxism–Leninism.

Another difference between the Albanians and Chinese was on the treatment of &quot;anti-revisionist&quot; parties in Europe and elsewhere who openly upheld the positions of the Albanians and Chinese against the Soviet Union, with the Chinese being reluctant to organize them in joint endeavors due to fears of alienating &quot;neutral&quot; parties such as those in North Korea and North Vietnam, whereas the Albanians took an active interest in such efforts; Hoxha wrote that the CCP: Following the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 an Albanian delegation to Beijing was told by Zhou Enlai that &quot;Albania, as a small country, had no need of heavy armament and that it was not at all in a position to defend itself alone from foreign aggression... Therefore, according to Chou En-lai, the only road for Albania to cope with foreign aggression was that of... concluding a military alliance with Yugoslavia and with Rumania... [and he] repeated this same thesis to the Albanian Government delegation which had gone to Peking in July 1975... [which] was turned down again by our delegation in a clear-cut and categorical manner.&quot; An indication of the Albanian position on Romania was shown by Nicolae Ceaușescu&#x27;s visit to China in June 1971, with Hoxha writing in his diary that: &quot;Hsinhua reported only that [Mao] said to him: &#x27;Rumanian comrades, we should unite to bring down imperialism&#x27;. As if Ceausescu and company are to bring down imperialism!! If the world waits for the Ceausescus to do such a thing, imperialism will live for tens of thousands of years. It is the proletariat and the peoples that fight imperialism.&quot;

==1970s==
Following Lin Biao&#x27;s downfall the Chinese leadership began seeking an accommodation with the United States against the Soviet Union, viewing the latter as a more dangerous opponent to its interests. Henry Kissinger&#x27;s visit to China in July 1971 and the subsequent announcement of Nixon&#x27;s visit came as a shock to the Albanians, with Hoxha writing in his diary at the time that &quot;when the Americans were killing and bombing in Vietnam and the whole of Indochina, China held secret talks with the Americans... These disgraceful, anti-Marxist, uncomradely negotiations were held without the knowledge of the Vietnamese, let alone any knowledge on our part. This was scandalous. This was a betrayal of the Chinese towards the Vietnamese, towards their war, towards us, their allies, and all the other progressive peoples. This is revolting.&quot;

A month later the CC of the Party of Labour of Albania sent a letter to its Chinese counterpart strongly protesting the decision to receive Nixon, writing among other things that The CC of the CCP did not reply to the letter. In that year and in 1972, however, the Chinese did send messages notifying the Albanians that they should expect a lower level of economic activity with China in the future.

In October 1971 Hoxha was informed that the Chinese would not be sending a delegation to the 6th Congress of the Party of Labour held next month, which prompted Hoxha to write that, &quot;Every cloud has a silver lining. Reaction and the revisionists will make the most of this anti-Marxist action of the leadership of the Communist Party of China, but the international communist movement will judge how right our Party has been in its line and how wrong the Communist Party of China is on this question.&quot; At the 6th Congress Hoxha indirectly criticized recent Chinese foreign policy moves by declaring that, &quot;As long as American imperialism and the Soviet revisionist imperialism are two imperialist superpowers and come out with a common counter-revolutionary strategy, it is impossible for the struggle of the peoples against them not to merge into a single current. You cannot rely on the one imperialism to oppose the other.&quot;

In 1973 China&#x27;s trade with Albania experienced a significant decline, to $136 million from $167 million a year earlier. Reflecting on China&#x27;s relations with the Party of Labour at this point, Hoxha wrote that &quot;Chou En-lai, Li Hsien-nien and Mao have cut off their contacts with us, and the contacts which they maintain are merely formal diplomatic ones. Albania is no longer the &#x27;faithful, special friend&#x27;. For them it comes at the end of the line, after Rumania and Yugoslavia in Europe ... it is quite obvious that their &#x27;initial ardour&#x27; has died.&quot; In April the same year Geng Biao informed the Albanians that &quot;China does not approve the creation of Marxist-Leninist parties and does not want the representatives of these parties to come to China. Their coming is a nuisance to us but we can do nothing about them, for we cannot send them away. We accept them just as we accept the representatives of bourgeois parties.&quot;

In 1974–75 various figures in Albanian military, economic and cultural fields were arrested, with some executed on charges of plotting a coup d&#x27;état which would install a government favorable to greater ties with the West and which would promote economic and cultural liberalization on broadly Yugoslav lines. In his diary at the time Hoxha wrote that, 

In April 1974 Deng Xiaoping, head of the Chinese delegation to the United Nations, proclaimed the &quot;Three Worlds Theory&quot; at a speech to its General Assembly, which declared that the world was divided into &quot;first&quot; (the United States and the Soviet Union), &quot;second&quot; (France, Great Britain, West Germany, Japan, etc.), and &quot;third&quot; (the various countries of Africa, Latin America and Asia) worlds, of which China was declared to be in the third. Writing on such matters, Hoxha declared that, &quot;When China took its pro-American and anti-Soviet stance, this policy was manifested in all its relations with the foreign world. Imperialist America, the fascists Pinochet and Franco, Tito and Ceausescu, renegades and adventurers, German revanchists and Italian fascists are its friends. For China ideology has no importance... The Chinese imagine (there is no other way their actions can be interpreted) that the whole world thinks and is convinced that China is red and revolutionary. This policy which China is pursuing has a &#x27;revolutionary&#x27; aim: to unite the &#x27;third world&#x27;, the &#x27;second world&#x27; and American imperialism against the Soviet social-imperialists. And from their actions it turns out that in order to achieve this &#x27;ideal&#x27; they must not take much account of principles. &#x27;We now defend the United States of America,&#x27; the Chinese justify themselves, &#x27;because it is weaker than the Soviet Union, but with this we must also deepen the contradictions between the Soviet Union and the United States of America&#x27;. ... Having deviated from a principled Marxist-Leninist class policy, China, naturally, must base itself on the political conjunctures, on the manoeuvres and intrigues of reactionary governments.&quot;

In response to Albania&#x27;s refusal to endorse the &quot;Three Worlds Theory,&quot; the rapprochement with the United States, and other activities, &quot;Beijing had drastically reduced the flow of its economic and military assistance&quot; to Albania by 1976, trade declining to $116 million in that year from $168 in 1975.

==Culmination==

At the 7th Congress of the Party of Labour, held in November 1976, Hoxha indicated his opposition to the new Chinese leadership that had taken over with the death of Mao Zedong in September by refusing to mention Hua Guofeng and openly denouncing Deng Xiaoping while calling for a multilateral meeting of Marxist–Leninist parties. According to the Albanians in their 1978 letter to the Chinese, the latter had tried to pressure them to denounce those who were not part of the ruling group in China: &quot;As we did not do this, it comes to the conclusion that we are partisans of Lin Piao and &#x27;the gang of four&#x27;. It is wrong in both aspects. ... The Party of Labour of Albania never tramples on Marxist-Leninist principles, and has never been, nor will it ever be, anybody&#x27;s tool.&quot; The Congress also saw activity on the part of various delegations from &quot;anti-revisionist&quot; parties, 29 in all, of whom a number expressed definite preference for the Albanian line over its Chinese counterpart.

Speaking at the Congress, Hoxha reiterated his declaration at the 6th Congress on opposing both superpowers equally, and also denounced the Common Market and NATO, both of which were looked upon favorably by China in its anti-Soviet strategy. &quot;Loyal to the interests of the revolution, socialism, and the peoples,&quot; Hoxha said, &quot;our Party will support the proletariat and the peoples who are against the two superpowers and for their destruction, against the capitalist and revisionist bourgeoisie and for its overthrow.&quot; In December the Albanians were given a Chinese note criticizing Hoxha&#x27;s report to the Congress, with Hoxha deciding to have the CC of the Party of Labour give an official reply, stressing in it that &quot;the PLA is an independent Marxist-Leninist party which formulates its own line itself, from the viewpoint of the Marxist-Leninist theory, on the basis of realistic analyses of the internal and external situation... it accepts criticism by sister Marxist-Leninist parties, and it will discuss many problems with them, and vice-versa, the PLA also has the same right towards other sister parties.&quot; Hoxha also had the reply mention that various letters sent to the CC of the CCP by its Albanian counterpart never received replies, such as the letter on Nixon&#x27;s decision to visit China. The new Albanian letter did not receive a reply.

Around this time Hoxha began analyzing the works of Mao Zedong and the history of the Communist Party of China. As part of his examination of the then-recently released 1956 Mao speech &quot;On the Ten Major Relationships&quot; in late December, Hoxha wrote of the Sino-Soviet split that Hoxha further wrote that: &quot;Mao Tsetung accuses Stalin of left adventurism, of having exerted great pressure on China and the Communist Party of China. ... Glancing over all the main principles of Mao Tsetung&#x27;s revisionist line, in regard to all those things which he raises against Stalin, we can say without reservation that Stalin was truly a great Marxist-Leninist who foresaw correctly where China was going, who long ago realized what the views of Mao Tsetung were, and saw that, in many directions, they were Titoite revisionist views, both on international policy and on internal policy, on the class struggle, on the dictatorship of the proletariat, on peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, etc.&quot;

In May 1977 a Chinese parliamentary delegation visited Romania and Yugoslavia, but not Albania, and referred to the Yugoslav system as socialist while praising the Non-Aligned Movement, while Tito was invited to Beijing in August and praised by his hosts. In September 1978 Tito declared that, according to Hua, &quot;Mao Zedong said that he should have invited me for a visit, stressing that in 1948, too, Yugoslavia was in the right, a thing which he had declared even then, to a narrow circle. But, taking into consideration the relations between China and the Soviet Union at that time, this was not said publicly.&quot;

On July 7, 1977, an editorial in &quot;Zëri i Popullit&quot; written but not signed by Hoxha and entitled &quot;The Theory and Practice of the Revolution&quot; openly attacked the &quot;Three Worlds Theory&quot; by name and thus signified a direct attack on the Chinese. Among other things the editorial stated that, 
Hoxha wrote on the occasion of the editorial&#x27;s publication that, The Chinese temporarily revived their interest in the pro-Chinese parties in order to use them as polemicists against attacks on the &quot;Three Worlds Theory&quot; while pro-Albanian parties fought back; on November 1 &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; dedicated its entire issue that day to an article entitled &quot;Chairman Mao&#x27;s Theory of the Differentiation of the Three Worlds Is A Major Contribution to Marxism-Leninism&quot; in recognition that China could no longer rely entirely on proxies in defending its foreign policy from the Albanians.

In December 1977 Hoxha recorded in his diary that a group of Chinese specialists were not being sent to Albania because in their excuse &quot;the appropriate conditions do not exist, therefore as long as good conditions and understanding have not been created, we are not going to send our specialists for these objects.&quot; In April and May 1978 the Albanian Foreign Ministry made an official complaint that Chinese experts in the country &quot;had the deliberate intention of harming Albania&#x27;s economy&quot; and on July 7 that year, on the first anniversary of the publication of &quot;The Theory and Practice of the Revolution,&quot; the Chinese Foreign Ministry informed the Albanian embassy in Beijing that it was ceasing all economic and military agreements with the country. On July 29 the Albanians replied, declaring the July 7 decision 
The letter went on to note delays on the Chinese side in providing equipment and materials for the vast majority of its economic projects in Albania, but also concluded that, &quot;The true motives for the cessation of aid and loans to Albania have not an exclusively technical character, as the note of the Chinese Government makes out, on the contrary they have a deep political and ideological character.&quot; The letter concluded that, &quot;Albania will never submit to anybody, it will stand to the end loyal to Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. It will march non-stop on the road of socialism and communism illuminated by the immortal teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin. ... Though encircled, socialist Albania is not isolated because it enjoys the respect and love of the world proletariat, the freedom-loving peoples and the honest men and women throughout the world. This respect and love will grow even more in the future. Our cause is just! Socialist Albania will triumph!&quot;

==Subsequent developments==
Following the split with China, the Albanians proclaimed that their country was the only one in the world genuinely constructing a socialist society. In December 1977 Hoxha wrote an analysis of the Chinese revolution, declaring that, contrary to the Chinese view, &quot;in general, the decisions and directives of the Comintern, first of all of the time of Lenin, were correct, and that those of the time of Stalin were correct, too.&quot; On the character of the revolution he wrote that, &quot;In my opinion, and as far as I can judge, China carried out a bourgeois-democratic revolution of a new type through the national liberation armed struggle&quot; and that &quot;the revolution in China could not be carried through to the end. ... So long as the working class in China shared power with the bourgeoisie, this power, in essence, was never transformed into a dictatorship of the proletariat, and consequently the Chinese revolution could not be a socialist revolution.&quot;

Biberaj writes that throughout the alliance the Albanians had a definite advantage in that &quot;the scope of China&#x27;s decision-making participation in Albania was insignificant ... it was the Albanians rather than the Chinese who decided on the use of the aid... Tiranë was in a stronger bargaining position than Beijing because the Chinese were more keen in maintaining the alliance.&quot; Peter R. Prifti noted that Albania&#x27;s relations with China &quot;emphasize[d] once again the great importance the Albanian leaders attach to ideology ... [and] proved conclusively—if such proof were needed—Albania&#x27;s independence of China. It demonstrated that the Albanian Party was not a mere mouthpiece of Peking but follows a basically independent foreign policy.&quot;

Recalling his pre-1956 impressions of China, Hoxha once wrote that, Likewise in September 1977 Hoxha wrote that, &quot;The question of Chinese communism has been an enigma to me. I am not saying this only now, but have expressed my doubt years ago in my notes. This doubt arose in my mind immediately after the Bucharest Meeting, and it was aroused because of the timorous stand the Chinese adopted there. ... Khrushchev&#x27;s activity compelled Teng to change [his conciliatory] report and make it somewhat more severe, because Khrushchev issued a document in which China was attacked, and distributed it before the meeting. Teng was also compelled by the resolute stand of our Party, but that is a long story. The later stands of the Chinese, I am speaking about their political and ideological stands, have shown continuous vacillation, and this was precisely the basis of the enigma and my doubt about them ... but now we can say that this policy of China was a great fraud, a major manoeuvre of the Chinese revisionists to disguise themselves.&quot;

In the view of the Albanians, the shift in China&#x27;s line between 1956 and 1960 was due to the following: 
 As Hoxha put it, 

In December 1978, Hoxha&#x27;s &quot;&quot; was released, the second half of which was a criticism of the &quot;Three Worlds Theory,&quot; Chinese foreign policy in general, and Maoism. Hoxha declared that China had become a &quot;social-imperialist&quot; country, aspiring to superpower status alongside the US and USSR by tactically allying with the former against the latter on account of the former&#x27;s greater economic strength and willingness to invest in the Chinese economy. On the subject of Maoism Hoxha stated that &quot;Mao Zedong was not a Marxist-Leninist, but a progressive revolutionary democrat, who remained for a long time at the head of the Communist Party of China and played an important role in the triumph of the Chinese democratic anti-imperialist revolution. Within China, in the ranks of the party, among the people and outside China, he built up his reputation as a great Marxist-Leninist and he himself posed as a communist, as a Marxist-Leninist dialectician. But this was not so. He was an eclectic who combined some elements of Marxist dialectics with idealism, even with ancient Chinese philosophy.&quot;

In a 1988 publication, the Albanians stated that they &quot;appreciated China&#x27;s aid and its role, among other outside factors, in the development of our country&#x27;s economy, seeing it as aid by a friendly people, aid without strings attached and without political conditions, which served the general cause of the revolution and socialism.&quot; However, &quot;In order to subjugate the PLA and the Albanian state, the Chinese revisionists raised many serious difficulties and obstacles for the fulfilment of the 6th Five-Year Plan [of 1976-1980]. Under various trumped-up excuses, they recalled some of their specialists who worked in Albania, slowed down the rates of work and, especially, postponed the setting up of the industrial projects ... which were planned to be built with the aid of China.&quot; Following the split Albania also became a country &quot;relying entirely on its own forces, without any kind of aid or credits from abroad, without external and internal debts.&quot;

<text>Batya Gur (; 1 September 1947 – 19 May 2005) was an Israeli novelist. Her specialty was detective fiction. She was a 1994 recipient of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Prize for Hebrew Literary Works.

==Biography==
Batya Gur was born in Tel Aviv in 1947 to parents who survived the Holocaust. She earned a master&#x27;s degree in Hebrew literature from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Between 1971 and 1975 Batya lived in Greensboro, NC, where she taught Hebrew and Jewish studies to elementary students at the North Carolina Hebrew Academy at Greensboro (now called B&#x27;nai Shalom Day School). Before writing her first detective novel at the age of 39, she taught literature at the Hebrew University Secondary School. Gur was also a literary critic for &quot;Haaretz&quot; newspaper.

==Literary career==
In 1988 she began writing a series starring the character of police detective Michael Ohayon: an educated, pensive, and intellectual detective. Five sequels ensued. The first book was adapted as a film for Israeli television. In every book in the series Michael Ohayon enters a closed world, an isolated society, with rules of its own (for example psychoanalysts, literary scholars in academia, or members of a kibbutz). By his fundamental approach and his inner understanding of human nature, Ohayon succeeds in breaking the ring of silence and solving the murder mystery on his way to the next book.

==Critical acclaim==
Gur&#x27;s crime novels were described as &quot;less about the death of the body than...sustained, thoughtful explorations of the life of the mind.&quot;

==Death==
On 19 May 2005, Gur died of lung cancer in Jerusalem at the age of 57. She was buried at Har HaMenuchot.

<text>The Adventist Development and Relief Agency International (ADRA or ADRA International) is a humanitarian agency operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church for the purpose of providing individual and community development and disaster relief. It was founded in 1956, and it is headquartered in Silver Spring, Maryland, United States.

In 2004, ADRA reported assisting nearly 24 million people with more than US$159 million in aid. Its staff numbered over 4,000 members. As of the end of 2007, it had operations in 125 countries. According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, in 2005, ADRA ranked among America&#x27;s 200 largest charities

Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) is a faith-based, non-governmental organization that has made strides of holistic effort for the perseverance of human well-being. This organization is motivated by religious beliefs regarding humanity and distributes social service through volunteers.

ADRA distributes relief to communities living in life-threatening poverty, war impacted zones and other critical living conditions.

==Mission==
The organization&#x27;s mission statement is: &quot;ADRA works with people in poverty and distress to create just and positive change through empowering partnerships and responsible actions.&quot; Its stated reason for existence is &quot;to follow Christ&#x27;s example by being a voice for, serving, and partnering with those in need&quot;, and the 1983 organizational documents include a biblical rationale for conducting humanitarian work.

==Purpose==

ADRA partners with communities, organizations, and governments in order to develop: 
*Food Security
*Economic Development
*Primary Health
*Emergency Management
*Basic Education

ADRA says that it serves people without discriminating against their ethnic, political, or religious association. Priority is given to those with disabilities, children, and senior citizens.

ADRA&#x27;s areas of expertise include: Education, Emergencies, Food/nutrition, HIV/AIDS, Health, Refugees and IDPs, Shelter, Training and development, Water and sanitation, Women, Children, Monitoring and Evaluation, Programme management, and Security.

A Los Angeles Times story from 1998 reports on ADRA&#x27;s 1996 10-year strategic plan, which calls the agency &quot;a bona fide ministry of Jesus Christ and the Seventh-day Adventist Church&quot; and &quot;provides a strategy to reach people previously untouched by other church institutions. The church&#x27;s mission is incomplete without ADRA&#x27;s distinctive ministry.&quot; Much has been said about faith-based agencies taking US government funding and using those funds to further religious doctrinal missions, however, ADRA does not proselytise. It claims to operate &quot;by love with no strings attached&quot;. As a global organisation, ADRA is a signatory of the Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief, which states that &quot;aid will not be used to further a particular political or religious standpoint&quot;, that &quot;aid is given regardless of the race, creed, or nationality&quot;, and that organizations &quot;shall respect culture and custom.&quot;

This organization has helped a total of 25.3 million people throughout 120 countries, with over a thousand of projects created over the years. ADRA claims their main focus areas are “improving health,” “increasing livelihoods,” “providing access to education,” and “responding to disasters.” This charity has only met an increase of need and opportunity as the years have gone by. Over time, they are expanding their outreach.

==History==
ADRA was established as the Seventh-day Adventist Welfare Service (SAWS) in November 1956. The name was changed to Seventh-day Adventist World Service in 1973.

In 1983, the organisation was renamed the &#x27;Adventist Development and Relief Agency&#x27; to better reflect its missions and activities.

===International Development Degree Program===

In 1996 ADRA and Andrews University established the ADRA Professional Leadership Institute (APLI). The institute provided field-based training and continuing professional education to ADRA staff around the world. By the year 2000, the APLI program was used as a model by the Food Aid Management members as an example of &quot;best practices for local capacity building.&quot; The model was well received by Africare, World Vision, and others. By 2003, the ADRA and Andrews University partnership offered a master&#x27;s degree in International Development. More than 160 students had graduated. Sixty of those graduates had moved into management positions across the network. Seventh-day Adventist institutions of higher education on four continents offered degrees in International Development.

===United Nations===

The United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) granted ADRA general Consultative Status in 1997.

===Emergency response===

, ADRA International had responded to approximately 60 emergencies worldwide, by which more than 127,000 people have directly benefited.

Ten years later, in 2024, ADRA had an outreach to 120 countries resulting in over 1,600 projects reaching over 21 million lives.

=== Foundational Beliefs ===
The Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) is a humanitarian agency that is faith based. Their outreach targets nations that experience poverty, disaster-struck areas, lack of educational opportunities and populations needing advocacy. 

This organization has made strides of holistic efforts for the perseverance of human well-being. This organization is motivated by religious beliefs regarding humanity and distributes social service through volunteers. 

Although faith based and operated by the Seventh-Day Adventist Church, they do not discriminate. With a motto of, “to serve humanity so all may live as God intended,” their belief is in giving freely to all in need. ADRA believes in human rights, yet are &quot;motivated&quot; by their religious beliefs. ADRA is funded through several contributions such as donations from corporations, community, governmental and nongovernmental organizations.

Their outlook on development originates from a Christian perspective that &quot;development is transformation.&quot;

Outreach

Through examination of ADRA&#x27;s impact in Hargeisa, North-Western Somalia, there were several projects to contribute to the well-being of this small community. This study documents that ADRA created opportunities for skill development that directly led to town improvement. However, humane and sustainability matters are in question, such with many other NGOs.

In Hargeisa, many locals of the small community saw a large increase of their skill-set, yet low employment rates which led to no increase of their income, continuing the cycle of poverty. However, the majority of the community did not suffer from worse negative impacts. Although, in examination of ADRA&#x27;s attempts for self-reliance and increase of income in Ghana, the attempts deemed successful for the majority.

ADRA also assisted in developing electricity in schools, stoves to provide a flow of food while training individuals to become electricians or manufacturers. Their goal was to assist in the present, but create self-sustaining careers to help with the social and economic development of the community.

Socio-Economic Development

NGOs are committed to helping the lives of the poverty stricken, alleviating those levels and creating a sustainable life for people in communities. ADRA has been a contributor to this development, significantly in the Global South.

ADRA has been established in Bangladesh since 1997. This organization has created sustainable development contributing to the social and economic uprising of Bangladesh. Their attempts to decrease poverty levels were successful by distributing workforce lessons and more. It gave the members of these communities a livelihood by giving them an income. This supports the local economy as well as people and their family’s survival.

Another major part of Bangladesh&#x27;s growing economy was the effort of ADRA vocational training in the health-care industry. Impacting overall health creates a positive environment and hopeful livelihood of human-beings, but also provides more income opportunities. AAs they provided aid to those who were underprivileged during disaster relief missions, they took the opportunity to let professionals train others, while creating jobs.

ADRA worked towards nation building in the southern global regions, including Bangladesh. A notable project from this organization was the “Women’s Development Project.” Women were placed in communities where they lived and worked alongside other women surviving in that community. Their outreach began by teaching basic hygiene for infection control and disease prevention. They also trained women to assist with labor and delivery plus including their own materials for themselves. This was a contribution equally important to the social and economic development of women in Bangladesh, while contributing to physical health.

Nonetheless, Bangladesh is still in desperate need of help and improvements need to be underway from all actors in the south. ADRA’s efforts now in 2024, compared to those in 1997, have continued to grow, but not at the exact rate predicted years ago.

<doc id="1343098" wikidata="Q7510014" url="?curid=1343098" title="Siege of Fort Meigs">
<text>The siege of Fort Meigs took place in late April to early May 1813 during the War of 1812 in northwestern Ohio, in present-day Perrysburg. A small British Army unit with support from Indians attempted to capture the recently constructed fort to forestall an American offensive against Detroit, and its Fort Detroit in the Great Lakes region which the British from the north in Canada had captured it the previous year. An American sortie and relief attempt failed with heavy casualties, but the British failed to capture the fort and were eventually forced to raise the siege.

== Background ==
In the early days of the War of 1812 (1812–1815), an American Army under Brigadier General William Hull (1753–1825), surrendered following the siege of Detroit. To recover the town of Detroit and Fort Detroit, the Americans formed the Army of the Northwest. Brigadier General James Winchester (1752–1826), briefly commanded this army before William Henry Harrison (1773–1841), Congressional delegate and then secretary of the old Northwest Territory, then first governor of the Indiana Territory and future 9th president (1841) was commissioned a major general in the regular United States Army and appointed to the command by fourth president James Madison.

Harrison&#x27;s advance was hampered by bad weather and shortage of supplies. On 22 January 1813, the leading detachment of his army (commanded by Winchester) was defeated at the Battle of Frenchtown. Harrison withdrew with his main body to the Maumee or also called Miami du Lac River, and in spite of rebukes from future 5th President James Monroe, who was temporarily serving as United States Secretary of War, he declined to resume his advance immediately and instead gave orders for the construction of several forts to protect the rivers and trails which his army would use in any renewed advance. Two of the most important were Fort Meigs (named for Return J. Meigs Jr., the Governor of Ohio) on the Maumee River and Fort Stephenson on the Sandusky River in the northwest corner of the decade old state.

Harrison descended the Maumee to the proposed site of Fort Meigs with an army which ultimately numbered 4,000 men (mainly militia) and began construction of the fort on 1 February 1813. He contemplated making a hit-and-run attack across the frozen Lake Erie against the British position at Amherstburg in Upper Canada and moved to the mouth of the Maumee, but found that the ice on the frozen lake was already breaking up and returned to the half-finished fort. He found the officer he had left in charge, Joel B. Leftwich, had left with all his men because the enlistment period of the militia units assigned to the task had expired. Construction had halted, and the wood that had been cut was being used as firewood.

As the enlistments of Harrison&#x27;s Ohio and Kentucky militia were also about to expire, Harrison disbanded his force and departed for Cincinnati, Ohio to the south on the Ohio River, to raise a fresh army. He left Army Corps of Engineers Major Eleazer D. Wood to complete the construction of the fort. The garrison consisted of several hundred men from the 17th and 19th Regiments, U.S. Infantry, who were inadequately clothed, plus militia from Pennsylvania and Virginia whose own enlistments were soon to expire.

The fort was on the south bank of the Maumee, near the Miami Rapids. Across the river were the ruins of the old British Fort Miami and the site of the pivotal 1794 Battle of Fallen Timbers. Fort Meigs occupied an area of , the largest fortification constructed in North America to that date. The perimeter consisted of a fifteen-foot picket fence, linking eight blockhouses. The north face was protected by the Maumee, and the east and west faces by ravines. The south face was cleared of all timber to create an open glacis.

The poor weather of early spring prevented a British attack while the fort was still vulnerable. The British Army commander on the Detroit frontier, Major General Henry Procter, had been urged to attack Fort Presque Isle (present day Erie, Pennsylvania), where the Americans were constructing a flotilla intended to seize control of Lake Erie, but Procter refused unless he received substantial reinforcements. Instead, he decided upon an attack on Fort Meigs, to disrupt American preparations for a summer campaign and hopefully capture supplies. Harrison received word of Procter&#x27;s preparations, and hastened down the Maumee with 300 reinforcements, increasing the garrison of the fort to a total of 1,100 men. He had persuaded Isaac Shelby, the Governor of Kentucky, to call up a brigade of 1,200 Kentucky militia under Brigadier General Green Clay. Clay&#x27;s brigade followed Harrison down the Maumee, but had not reached the fort before it was besieged.

== Siege begins ==
Procter&#x27;s force disembarked at the mouth of the Maumee on 26 April. His force consisted of 31 men of the Royal Artillery, 423 men of the 41st Regiment of Foot, 63 men of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment, 16 men from other units, and 462 Canadian militia. He also had roughly 1,250 Native American warriors led by Shawnee chief Tecumseh and Wyandot chief Roundhead. His artillery consisted of two 24-pounder guns which had been captured at Detroit, nine lighter guns and two gunboats mounting 9-pounder guns.

It took several days for the British force to move up the Maumee and set up batteries. Most of these were on the north side of the river, but one was set up on the south side. Most of the Natives also were on the south side of the river, loosely investing the fort. As the British established their batteries, Harrison ordered &quot;traverses&quot;, embankments high, to be hastily thrown up within the fort. The British batteries opened fire on 1 May, but most of the cannon shot fired sank harmlessly into the wet earth of the traverses and embankments.

== Battle of the Miami ==

On 2 May, Harrison sent a courier to Clay&#x27;s force, with orders for part of them to spike the British guns on the north bank and then withdraw into the fort, while a sortie from the fort attacked the battery on the south bank.

The Kentuckians gained complete surprise. Early on the morning of 5 May, a detachment from Clay&#x27;s brigade under Colonel William Dudley landed from boats on the north bank of the river. Dudley&#x27;s command comprised 761 of his own 10th Kentucky Detached Regiment of Militia, 60 of the 13th Kentucky Detached Regiment of Militia and 45 U.S. Army regular troops. This force stormed the batteries on the north bank and spiked the guns but used ramrods for the spiking instead of handspikes, which meant that the cannons were only temporarily disabled. Dudley then lost control of some of his men. Coming under fire from Natives in the woods, part of the Kentuckian force pursued Tecumseh&#x27;s men, who led them deeper into the forest. Dudley followed in an attempt to bring them back, leaving Major James Shelby in command at the battery. Major Adam Muir led three companies of the 41st Foot and one of Canadian militia from the British camp and stormed the battery, killing many of the Kentuckians and forcing Shelby to surrender. In the woods, the disorganised Kentuckians were decimated in confused fighting against the Natives. Of Dudley&#x27;s 866 officers and men, only 150 escaped to the fort. This became known as &quot;Dudley&#x27;s Massacre&quot; or &quot;Dudley&#x27;s Defeat&quot;. The rest of Clay&#x27;s force, which had not been involved in the attack on the batteries, reached the fort safely to reinforce the garrison.

On the south bank, the American sortie against the British battery was partially successful. Colonel John Miller, at the head of 350 regulars and volunteers, captured the battery and took 41 prisoners. However, Captain Richard Bullock, with the flank companies of the 1/41st Foot, two companies of militia and 300 Indians, counterattacked and, in hard fighting, drove Miller&#x27;s detachment back into the fort with heavy casualties.

=== Aftermath ===
After the battle, the prisoners from Dudley&#x27;s command were taken for confinement to the ruined Fort Miami near the British camp. Here, some of the Native warriors began massacring the prisoners and several Americans were killed before Tecumseh, Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Elliott and Captain Thomas McKee of the Indian Department persuaded the warriors to stop. Tecumseh is reputed to have asked Procter why he had not stopped the massacre and, when Procter replied that the Indians could not be made to obey, replied, &quot;Begone! You are unfit to command. Go and put on petticoats&quot;. Another version of the incident had Tecumseh rebuking Procter with, &quot;I conquer to save; you to kill&quot;. Eye-witness accounts stated that between 12 and 14 prisoners were killed in the massacre.

The battle of 5 May was known to the British as &quot;the Battle of the Miami&quot;, having taken place beside the Miami du Lac River (now known as the Maumee River). The 41st Regiment, whose successor in the British Army is the Royal Welsh Regiment, was awarded the battle honour, &quot;Miami&quot;, in commemoration of its successful action during the battle.

Within the Canadian Army both the Royal Newfoundland Regiment and the Essex and Kent Scottish Regiment carry the battle honour &quot;Maumee&quot; to commemorate the participation of their ancestor units in the campaign.

Five active regular battalions of the United States Army (1-3 Inf, 2-3 Inf, 4-3 Inf, 2-7 Inf and 3-7 Inf) perpetuate the lineage of the old 17th, 19th and 24th Infantry Regiments, which had elements that were engaged at Fort Meigs. In addition, Virginia militia units that eventually became the 150th Cavalry (ARNG WV) were present during the construction of the fort.

=== Casualties ===
The British official casualty return gave 14 killed, 47 wounded and 40 captured. It was headed as being for May 5 but it appears to have been for the entire siege up to and including May 5, since it included among the wounded Captain Laurent Bondy of the Canadian militia, who is known to have received his (ultimately fatal) wound from artillery fire on May 3. The Native Americans allied to the British had 19 men killed and wounded, including Roundhead&#x27;s brother Jean-Baptiste.

Harrison reported the casualties sustained by his garrison in the entire siege, from 28 April to 9 May, as 80 killed and 190 wounded, of whom 12 were killed and 20 wounded by artillery fire. This would indicate 68 killed and 170 wounded during the engagement on 5 May. An official British return of prisoners details 547 captured Americans but a note from Procter states that &quot;since the above return was made out more than eighty prisoners have been brought by the Indians&quot;. This would give a total of about 630 Americans captured at the battle. Harrison reported no men missing or captured from his garrison, so all of the prisoners taken on 5 May must have been from Dudley&#x27;s troops on the north bank of the river. The official casualty report for Dudley&#x27;s command, compiled after the Kentucky Militia prisoners were paroled, details 80 men killed and 100 wounded (all of whom had been captured). This gives total casualties for Dudley&#x27;s 866-strong detachment of 80 killed, 100 wounded prisoners, 530 unwounded prisoners and 6 missing; and an overall American loss on May 5 of 148 killed, 170 wounded, 100 wounded prisoners, 530 unwounded prisoners and 6 missing.

== End of the siege ==
On 7 May, terms were arranged providing for the mutual exchange of all regular prisoners and the parole of the Kentucky Militia prisoners, who were convoyed to Sandusky under pledge of performing no further military service until formally exchanged for British prisoners. On the same day, Procter&#x27;s artillery resumed fire, but most of the Natives had abandoned the army and the Canadian militia were anxious to get back to their farms. The renewed bombardment had little effect, and the garrison of the fort now outnumbered the besiegers. Procter abandoned the siege on 9 May. The total American loss in the siege came to 160 killed, 190 wounded, 100 wounded prisoners, 530 other prisoners and 6 missing: 986 in all. John Sugden says that 14 killed, 47 wounded and 41 captured were Procter&#x27;s entire (non-Indian) casualties for the siege, which indicates that 1 man was captured after 5 May.

== Order of battle ==
== Second siege ==
Once the British had departed, Harrison left Clay in command of the fort with about 100 militiamen. Tecumseh urged Procter to make a renewed effort to capture the fort in July. Tecumseh&#x27;s warriors staged a mock battle in the woods to make it appear as if they were attacking a column of American reinforcements to lure Clay out of the fort. However, Clay knew no reinforcements were coming, and the ruse failed. Procter quickly abandoned the second siege.

<doc id="1343107" wikidata="Q354629" url="?curid=1343107" title="Mario Melchiot">
<text>Mario Dino Patrick Melchiot (born 4 November 1976) is a Dutch former professional footballer who played as a defender. He played both as a right-back and as a centre-back, and also occasionally played in midfield. He represented the Netherlands national football team at UEFA Euro 2008, and mostly played abroad for football clubs in England, France and Qatar.

==Early life==
Melchiot was born and raised in Amsterdam, living with his two brothers and two sisters. He enjoyed a close relationship with his eldest brother, Winston, who acted as Mario&#x27;s mentor after their parents split up. When Winston died of a heart attack at the age of 25 in 1996, Melchiot considered giving up football.

==Club career==
===Ajax===
Melchiot started his career in the youth system at Ajax, and made his debut in the 1996–97 season. He scored his first goal for the club in the semi-final of the Champions League in a 4–1 defeat against Juventus. Melchiot spent three seasons at the club, winning the Eredivisie in 1998 and the KNVB Cup in 1998 and 1999. In the summer of 1999, he signed a three-year contract with Chelsea under the Bosman ruling.

===Chelsea===
For most of his first season at the club, Melchiot did not feature in the first team due to injuries. However, on 22 April 2000, following an injury to Albert Ferrer, he finally made his debut in a 1–1 draw against Middlesbrough. A month later he played in the 2000 FA Cup Final against Aston Villa where he played a major role in helping Chelsea win the match.

At the start of the 2000–01 season, Melchiot scored his first goal for Chelsea in a 2–0 win against Manchester United in the 2000 FA Charity Shield. His second goal was also against Manchester United, as he helped his team to a memorable 3–0 win at Old Trafford in the 2001–02 season. Under the management of Claudio Ranieri, He quickly established himself as the club&#x27;s first-choice right-back, and was soon rewarded with a contract extension, keeping him at the club until 2004.

===Birmingham City===
Melchiot signed for Birmingham City on a three-year contract in July 2004, and made his debut in a 1–1 draw against Portsmouth. In his second season, Birmingham found themselves in a relegation battle. He soon became a scapegoat for the club&#x27;s poor performances, and was booed by his own supporters in a match against Tottenham Hotspur. Birmingham were finally relegated in April 2006 after a 0–0 draw with Newcastle United. He played his last game for Birmingham in their 1–0 defeat to Bolton Wanderers on 7 May 2006. He scored two league goals during his spell at Birmingham, against Charlton Athletic and Wigan Athletic.

===Rennes===
In August 2006, Melchiot joined French outfit Rennes on a one-year contract. He scored his first goal for the club in a Coupe de la Ligue Round of 16 tie against Ligue 2 club Libourne-Saint-Seurin. He endeared himself to the Rennes faithful when he scored his first league goal for the club in a 2–0 win over fierce rivals Nantes. Melchiot&#x27;s contract with Rennes lasted until the summer of 2007.

===Wigan Athletic===
Melchiot joined Wigan Athletic on a free transfer on 15 June 2007. On 24 July 2007, he was given the Wigan captaincy, following the departure of his compatriot Arjan de Zeeuw. He became a fan-favourite at the JJB Stadium, and made &quot;Latics&quot; history when he became the first Wigan player to play in a major international tournament by coming on for the Netherlands against Romania at the UEFA Euro 2008 tournament. He made 101 appearances for Wigan during his three years at the club.

===Umm Salal===
In June 2010, Melchiot turned down a new contract from Wigan and agreed to join Umm-Salal Sports Club on a free transfer after his existing contract expired at the end of the month. He was signed by Umm Salal manager, Henk ten Cate, as he was reportedly interested in an experienced defender after signing Spanish midfielder Gabri. He made his debut in a 2–2 draw against Al-Arabi. At the end of the 2010–11 Qatar Stars League Season, he left Umm-Salal as they opted not to give him a new one-year contract.

==International career==
Melchiot was capped 22 times for the Netherlands since making his international debut on 11 October 2000 in a 2–0 World Cup qualifier defeat against Portugal. His last international appearance was in the final group match of UEFA Euro 2008 against Romania on 17 June 2008.

==Outside football==
In 1998, Melchiot and Ajax teammates Benni McCarthy and Dean Gorre, calling themselves BMD, released a rap/R &amp; B track called &quot;Midas Touch&quot;. He has also campaigned for the British Heart Foundation and has appeared on the quiz show &quot;A Question of Sport&quot;.

<doc id="1343111" wikidata="Q741335" url="?curid=1343111" title="Public Eye (TV series)">
<text>Public Eye is a British television drama that ran from 1965 to 1975, produced by ABC Weekend TV for three series, and Thames Television a further four. It depicted investigations handled by enquiry agent Frank Marker (Alfred Burke), an unmarried loner who is in his early forties when the series begins. The title is a twist on the more usual &quot;private eye&quot;.

==Background==
The series was created by writers Roger Marshall and Anthony Marriott with the aim of getting away from &quot;square-jawed&quot; heroes of the type featured in Hollywood movies—a wish shared by Alfred Burke, the actor chosen to play Marker. This aim allowed for flexibility in the structure and plot lines of the episodes; each individual episode usually dealt with an individual case for Marker, but story arcs spanning several episodes, or in one case an entire series, were produced during the life of the programme. Marker&#x27;s work ranged broadly, from routine matters such as gathering evidence for divorces (at a time when British law required evidence of infidelity or other compelling reason for annulling a marriage) or creditworthiness enquiries, to more exotic investigations such as tracing missing people (or in one case, a prize-winning whippet). Many of the narratives conclude with Marker leaving a situation as it was at the beginning of the episode—for example, in &quot;The Man Who Didn&#x27;t Eat Sweets&quot;, he fails to tell his client that she is one of her husband&#x27;s three wives.

==Cast==
*Alfred Burke as Frank Marker

===Recurring===
*Pauline Delaney as Helen Mortimer (season 4-7)
*John Grieve as Hull (season 4)
*Ray Smith as D.I. Percy Firbank (season 5-7)
*Brenda Cavendish as Nell Holdsworth (season 5-6)
*Peter Childs as Ron Gash (season 7)

===Guest stars===
*Derek Benfield as Carter (season 2)
* Betty Albergeas Mrs Green (season 5)

==Episodes produced by ABC Television 1965–1968==
The first episode of the series was broadcast (in black and white) in January 1965 and was set in London, although very little (if any) location work was actually performed and the episodes were mostly confined to the TV studio. Of the 41 episodes produced by ABC, only five are currently known to exist in television-broadcastable format—the rest being victims of the common television company policy of wiping. However, two episodes from the first series remain.

In &quot;Nobody Kills Santa Claus&quot;, the second episode of the first series (transmitted 30 January 1965), Marker plays comparatively little part in the plot. The episode does establish key aspects of Marker&#x27;s character: his modest lifestyle arising from his modest fees for his work—the oft-quoted &quot;six guineas a day plus expenses&quot; (which became £6.30 a day in the later Thames-produced episodes, once Britain converted to decimal currency)—his shabby office, and the fact that he is often compelled to take on almost any offer of work just to earn his living. The plot concerns Marker being hired to protect a rather unlikeable businessman, Garston, who is receiving death threats. In keeping with the series&#x27; ethos of downplaying physical violence, Marker insists on being employed as a chauffeur rather than a bodyguard. He ends up taking a physical beating for his unlikeable client—a beating that is mostly off-screen and one that the viewer only sees the results of. The episode ends with Marker refusing an offer of permanent employment by Garston and returning to his freelance ways.

Marker&#x27;s work of necessity often involved him with the police and the criminal underworld—both factions dislike him and, although they have some need for him, make his life difficult. The other surviving series 1 episode, &quot;The Morning Wasn&#x27;t So Hot&quot;, sees Marker cross paths with an organised criminal gang; he is thrown into the River Thames by underworld figures as &quot;persuasion&quot; to drop his enquiries into the whereabouts of a missing girl he has been hired to trace—she has been forced into a life of professional vice at the behest of the gang. Partly as a result of this, the beginning of the second series he decides to leave London and moves to England&#x27;s second city of Birmingham. Things do not improve, and he continues to be mixed up in a world of shadowy figures.

The ABC episodes ended with &quot;Cross That Palm When We Come To It&quot; (broadcast on 13 April 1968) as Marker acts for a solicitor over some stolen jewels, as a go-between with the gang who stole them and want the reward money. Taking the recovered jewels back to his office, Marker receives a visit from the police and is convicted of receiving stolen property—the solicitor who hired him was crooked and has disappeared. Marker pleads guilty to the charge and is sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison. &quot;Cross That Palm&quot; is not one of the five surviving ABC episodes. It did however provide the basis for a 1974 novelisation by Audley Southcott (Sphere Books, ).

==Episodes produced by Thames Television 1969–1975==
Big changes had occurred in the ITV franchises in Britain in 1968, and ABC had been forced to merge with rival company Rediffusion London to create what became one of the powerhouses of UK television production—Thames Television. Thames picked up the series again in 1969 and produced 46 more episodes; unlike their ABC precursors all 46 remain safely in the archives, although 11 of these were still produced and broadcast in black and white. One other was made in colour (but broadcast in black and white) as a test of Thames&#x27;s new colour equipment, which was first used for broadcasting from November 1969—two months after the fourth series of &quot;Public Eye&quot; finished its on-air run.

ABC&#x27;s audience research had shown that many viewers found the character of Marker as interesting as his cases. For this reason, the first Thames series is quite different in style from the other three, and was written entirely by &quot;Public Eye&quot; co-creator Roger Marshall. Commonly referred to as &#x27;the Brighton series&#x27;, the collection of seven episodes links together to tell the story of Marker&#x27;s release from prison and his gradual rehabilitation into everyday life, culminating in him renting a new office and starting up again as an enquiry agent. This series also introduces regular characters such as Marker&#x27;s probation officer Mr Hull and his landlady Mrs Mortimer — the first such characters in the series apart from Marker himself.

===The Brighton episodes===
The first episode of the fourth series, &quot;Welcome to Brighton?&quot; (broadcast 30 July 1969) starts with a custom title sequence giving a brief recap of Marker&#x27;s offence and his prison career. The first shot is of Marker lying awake in bed with the judge&#x27;s voice going through his head, passing sentence on him. It is about a year since the events of &quot;Cross That Palm When We Come To It&quot; and Marker has been transferred to an open prison before being released on parole to complete his sentence. He is determined not to fall into a life of crime, despite what his fellow prisoners tell him (&quot;You&#x27;ve crossed over the line now, mate — you&#x27;re not one of them, you&#x27;re one of us!&quot;). In the first half of the episode, Marker is released from prison and heads for Brighton where the parole system has arranged accommodation for him with a Mrs Mortimer (Pauline Delaney). Through an extensive location-shot sequence on the sea front at Brighton, the viewer experiences Marker&#x27;s disorientation at a world which appears to have changed considerably since he was sent to prison. He immediately encounters the very same sort of people with whom he dealt every day in his pre-prison life; a semi-drunken encounter with a woman who tries to steal his money and using his detective skills to trace the wife of a fellow inmate from the prison he has just been released from. Marker meets his parole officer, Mr Hull (played by John Grieve) and gets a job with a local builder, Mr Kendrick.

In the third episode of the series, &quot;Paid in Full&quot;, a colleague at Kendrick&#x27;s yard has his pay packet stolen (workers in Britain were still paid in cash, rather than by cheque or bank transfer, in the late 1960s). Although completely innocent of any wrongdoing (as he points out, he would be stupid to steal the money as it would immediately end his parole and send him back to prison) Marker is placed under immense pressure by Kendrick&#x27;s other employees once they find out he is an ex-prisoner. The episode ends with Marker reluctantly agreeing to give up the job at Kendrick&#x27;s, and graphically illustrates the problems faced by ex-convicts as they try to reintegrate into society. &quot;Paid in Full&quot; also contains a scene where Marker visits an antiques shop in Brighton to enjoy his newfound freedom to purchase something with the money he is earning. A conversation ensues with the old lady who owns the shop, wherein Marker explains some of his family history.

The fourth episode in the Brighton series, &quot;My Life&#x27;s My Own&quot;, is notable for an early television treatment of a lesbian relationship. Characters from the episode would later appear in the &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; play &quot;Wednesday&#x27;s Child&quot; in 1970, though the role of Shirley is played by Stephanie Beacham in &quot;Public Eye&quot; and Prunella Ransome in the &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; episode (the other two overlapping roles are played by the same actors, however).

The Brighton series sees Marker establish a platonic friendship with Mrs Mortimer. Although he is told that she is a widow, she later confides in him that she has a husband who left her, and who she presumes is still alive. She tells the probation service she is a widow because she feels it would be more socially acceptable for a widow to be seen to take in ex-prisoners as lodgers—an interesting comment on the social attitudes of late-1960s England. Towards the end of the series, Marker works briefly for another enquiry agent, Rylands—in &quot;The Comedian&#x27;s Graveyard&quot; he is hired to trace a young girl who has run away from her home and is now appearing in a run-down end-of-pier theatre act. Unthinkably for the character during the ABC episodes, he invites Mrs Mortimer out for an evening at the theatre, together with the girl&#x27;s aunt who has hired him. The partnership with Rylands soon splits up as Marker finds his working methods intolerable and makes it clear he thinks Rylands is less than honest with his clients.

The final episode of the Brighton series was &quot;A Fixed Address&quot;, broadcast (in monochrome) on 10 September 1969—although it was actually made in colour, as noted above (it is now shown in colour by Talking Pictures TV as part of the re-runs of the complete Brighton and Eton series). The series afforded a great deal of character development to secondary characters. Mrs Mortimer&#x27;s estranged husband turns up on her doorstep claiming that he wants to restart their relationship. It transpires that his employers have offered him a lucrative post in an exotic overseas location—but only if he is a married man accompanied by his wife. The episode is notable for Marker setting up on his own again as an enquiry agent. The end credits are played over shots of him admiring his new (but still run-down and dingy) office. The end credits returned to the original theme music of previous series rather than the barer, more static arrangement that had been used especially for the Brighton episodes.

===The Eton episodes===
Thames commissioned a further series, this time of thirteen episodes, and the fifth series began on 5 July 1971. Several ITV companies in the early 1970s faced strike action as unions demanded better wages for handling the more complex colour broadcasting equipment. As a result, the first five episodes of series five were made in black and white although they were juggled around for transmission so that all five were not shown together.

The series opened with &quot;A Mug Named Frank&quot;; some months have passed since &quot;A Fixed Address&quot; and Marker is still living with Mrs Mortimer. She comments to him that his old problems are still present in Brighton—the police all know of him and of his record of being in prison. She also points out that, by his own admission, life has not been easy for Marker since he set up office on his own again and that he isn&#x27;t getting much work. A chance encounter in a supermarket ultimately results in Marker making the decision to move to Eton. To emphasise this, the opening titles to the episode are those used for the Brighton series, whereas the closing credits play over a film of Marker walking around Windsor and Eton, as used for the rest of the series. The episode also introduces the new regular character of Detective Inspector Percy Firbank (played by Ray Smith)—a local police officer whose interest is piqued by Marker. The remaining 12 episodes of series 5 often explore the Marker-Firbank relationship in detail. Marker is very suspicious of authority figures, especially policemen, and Firbank—at least initially—considers enquiry agents to be a lower form of life. The two gradually come to like each other, even when their relationship is tested—the final episode of the series is &quot;John VII, Verse 24&quot; (29 September 1971) in which it appears Firbank is corrupt and is accepting money from known criminals.

Series 5 also demonstrates the variety that the programme could offer: in &quot;Well—There Was This Girl, You See...&quot; Marker again becomes involved in stolen jewels, but is exceptionally careful, too careful as it turns out, as his tactic of exerting pressure on a young man he thinks is involved backfires when he chooses to run to the police rather than Marker, and wrecks Marker&#x27;s chances of getting a share of the reward money. An embarrassed Marker has to explain to an amused Firbank what has gone wrong.

In &quot;Shades of White&quot;, Marker is hired to monitor the suspicious activities of an ambitious local businessman&#x27;s daughter—he becomes friendly with the businessman&#x27;s housekeeper but then has his trust betrayed (again) when it transpires the housekeeper is acting to receive items stolen by the daughter&#x27;s friends.

Lighter moments in series 5 come with &quot;Transatlantic Cousins&quot; as a visiting American hires Marker to trace his English relatives, assisted by the tourist&#x27;s daughter. They find out that the American family does have an English relative who has inherited a baronetcy but the daughter also discovers that, because of a previously unknown member of the family who was killed in a war, her father is actually the rightful inheritor of the title.

===Marker&#x27;s failed alliances===
A further series of Eton-based episodes aired from 8 November 1972 to 14 February 1973, with the series now fully in colour. The final series began on 6 January 1975 with another arc of related episodes. Starting with &quot;Nobody Wants To Know&quot;, Marker investigates a horse-doping racket being run by an organised criminal gang. He ignores warnings to drop the case, because he &quot;doesn&#x27;t like being bullied&quot; but gets a serious beating-up for this.

The next episode, &quot;How About a Cup of Tea?&quot;, recalls the Brighton era as Marker comes out of hospital and his friends (including Firbank and a returning Mrs Mortimer) attempt to rally round him and cheer him up. He tries to find a career other than enquiries but is told by an unhelpful job centre clerk (Robin Askwith) that he is too old to do anything new. The episode concentrates again on Marker and how, with his friends to help him, he pulls himself out of the negative cycle of self-pity and depression.

The final episode of the trilogy is &quot;How About It, Frank?&quot;, in which he reluctantly takes revenge on those responsible for his beating up and narrowly avoids another encounter with the wrong side of the law. He enters into a partnership with another enquiry agent, Ron Gash (Peter Childs). Gash is an ex-policeman and, although much more likeable than Rylands (of the Brighton episodes) he does have very different ideas about the job from Marker. Although Marker would show interest in money if a large quantity of it appeared to be heading his way (such as &quot;Well—There Was This Girl, You See ...&quot;) he never considers raising his fees to provide himself with a more comfortable living standard. Gash is far more profit-motivated and also considers Marker&#x27;s shabby appearance to be off-putting to potential clients. Yet again Marker decides he doesn&#x27;t like working with a partner, and in the episode &quot;What&#x27;s to Become of Us?&quot; (10 February 1975) Gash and he part ways peacefully and amicably. For the final half-dozen episodes Marker relocates to Chertsey in Surrey, partly to avoid a clash of location with Gash&#x27;s business.

The move to Chertsey sees the series return to its traditional format of a new case each week for Marker. In &quot;Fit of Conscience&quot; he is asked to investigate the collapse of a residential apartment block and it becomes apparent that the concrete has been incorrectly formulated. Those responsible for this, the primary cause of the collapse, leave the country and avoid being brought to British justice for their actions. The series often produced such downbeat endings, with the villains getting away with their crimes or at the very least, with the resolution unclear and further thought required on the part of the viewer.

==The end of the series, its fate and legacy==
&quot;Public Eye&quot; came to an end on 7 April 1975 with the episode &quot;Unlucky For Some&quot;. A hotel owner asks Marker to investigate his wife&#x27;s odd behaviour. It transpires that her first husband is still alive and she is being blackmailed about this. Marker traces the first husband and plans to claim a large reward on offer for doing so, only to find that, 15 minutes before he could stake his claim, the blackmailer has carried out his threat and has therefore obtained the money. Marker is left with nothing and, ten years after he first appeared on British TV screens, Frank Marker still needs to take every case that comes his way in order to make ends meet.

Thames had not wanted to end the series at this point. The intention was that Euston Films, Thames&#x27; film-making subsidiary, would continue with an eighth and final series but would make it on film, rather than the PAL 625-line video format which it had been recorded on up till then. This made sense as Euston had a good track record, having scored major successes with &quot;Van der Valk&quot;, their revamped version of &quot;Special Branch&quot;, and &quot;The Sweeney&quot;. These were generally larger-scale, glossier and more &#x27;action-packed&#x27; operations than the more intimate &quot;Public Eye&quot;. Alfred Burke, fearing that the move onto film would mean the series would lose its particular, low-key identity, decided not to take up the option.

&quot;Public Eye&quot; became largely forgotten and confined to archival oblivion for almost twenty years, despite being a popular favourite for a decade and a ratings-topper in its time. One episode (&quot;Who Wants To Be Told Bad News?&quot; from series 5) was repeated in 1989 to mark Thames Television&#x27;s 21st anniversary, but thereafter nothing more happened. Thames then lost its franchise in controversial circumstances in 1992. Thames&#x27; successor Carlton Television considered remaking the series in the 1990s, but again nothing came of this. Recognition returned in 1995 when British satellite channel UK Gold (then part-owned by Thames) repeated all the colour Thames episodes from series 5 onwards. UK Gold had a policy of not showing any black and white material; thus the Brighton episodes and &quot;Shades of White&quot; remained unscreened.

A small group of British Television enthusiasts, Kaleidoscope, did much to promote the programme and negotiated the rights to rescreen, at conventions and meetings, many of the black-and-white Thames episodes and the remaining ABC episodes. They also unearthed a 1968 ABC promotional reel, on a long-obsolete domestic videotape format, which included a five-minute extract from the otherwise-missing third series episode &quot;Must Be the Architecture, Can&#x27;t Be the Climate&quot; and audio recordings of several lost ABC episodes. Most notably, Kaleidoscope organised and hosted a &#x27;Public Eye: Thirtieth Anniversary&#x27; convention in 1995. This was attended by Alfred Burke in person.

The television channel Talking Pictures TV began repeating the series from series 4 onwards in October 2018. It has been one of the station&#x27;s &quot;most popular screenings&quot;, according to a list in an article published in The Guardian in May 2020.

===DVD release===
Network Video issued the Brighton series in a three-DVD box set in mid-2004, complete with some restoration work. Bonus material included the complete ABC episode &quot;Nobody Kills Santa Claus&quot; and the above-mentioned extract from &quot;Must Be The Architecture...&quot; Sales of the box set were moderate; a follow-up four-disc set of Series 5, including the ABC episode &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget You&#x27;re Mine&quot;, was released in December 2004. Network released the 1972/3 and 1975 series on DVD in 2008, and the remaining ABC material on 27 August 2012 (2-DVD set, Network/StudioCanal 7953731).

A 17-disc box set of every surviving episode, including a book on the making of the series by Andrew Pixley, plus interviews with Alfred Burke and surviving episode fragments and audio soundtracks, was released by Network Video in 2012. (&quot;A Box Named Frank&quot;, 7953697).

The downbeat, moody theme music for the series was composed by Robert Sharples, writing under the pseudonym of Robert Earley.

<text>Ards Football Club is a semi-professional, Northern Irish football club playing in NIFL Championship. The club is based in Newtownards, but plays its home matches at Clandeboye Park in Bangor, which it rents from rivals Bangor to play home games. The club colours are red and blue.

==History==
===Castlereagh Park===
Ards were forced to sell their Castlereagh Park home in 1998 to try to reduce their crippling debts. The stadium remained well tended for another three years while ambitious plans for a new ground further down the road were developed. In 2002 Castlereagh Park was demolished, as planned. Ards hoped to play at a new community-owned site, a stone&#x27;s throw from Castlereagh Park that was due to be developed in 2010 by the local council. This plan has since been shelved, and they are still the nomads of Northern Irish football. During the time since Ards left Castlereagh Park, they have shared football grounds at Cliftonville&#x27;s Solitude and Carrick Rangers&#x27; Taylors Avenue, their rivals Bangor&#x27;s ground, Clandeboye Park and Ballyclare Comrades&#x27; ground, Dixon Park.

===First top-flight return: 2013–14===
For the 2012–13 season they played their home games at Clandeboye Park and were promoted to the NIFL Premiership for the 2013–14 season and went straight back down that season..Ards 2014–15 season was a season of change, with many players coming and going from the club and the season ultimately ended in disappointment with them finishing 3rd.
The 2015–16 was a better one with Ards reaching the league cup final by knocking out premiership sides Ballinamallard United and Coleraine before losing 3–0 in the final to Cliftonville at Solitude. Ards kept a comfortable hold at the top of the table before becoming league champions on the last day of the season beating Loughgall to secure their promotion back to the Premiership after a two-year absence.

===Second top-flight return: 2016–17===
Amidst proposed new plans for a stadium to be built on the grounds of Movilla High School, Ards returned to the top-flight once more under the stewardship of Niall Currie, who sought to bolster his squad with no less than 15 new signings. These included experienced Premiership players such as Ballymena United centre-back Johnny Taylor, and former Glenavon striker Gary Liggett. Other recruitments included defender Stuart McMullan and French striker Guillaume Keke, both signed from Larne. Ards started the season with a credible 2–2 draw with Cliftonville and went on to win their next three games in a row to become early leaders at the top of the league table. Following Niall Currie&#x27;s move to manage hometown club Portadown the club appointed Glentoran legend Colin Nixon as his replacement.

===Londonderry Park===
Plans were under-way to develop Londonderry Park as the new grounds for the team. Planning officials gave Ards Borough Council the go-ahead on the £3.8 million plan in October 2010.

In 2009, supporters launched a campaign, &#x27;Bring Ards FC Home&#x27;, in which they publicised the need in the media and had discussions with politicians. Back as far as November 2008, the Council had discussed the need for a new Ards stadium. It was decided in April 2009 that Londonderry Park, on the Portaferry Road in Newtownards, was the best option and the Ards Council accepted the tender for redevelopment of the site in September 2010. Plans included upgrades to the existing grass surfaces and the addition of new synthetic surfaces, and to allow for the possibility of future upgrading to meet regulations should the need arise. The ground would have also continued to provide facilities for hockey and cricket.

However, in August 2012 it was announced that Ards Borough Council would not be proceeding with the new stadium, and the plans were shelved.

<text>Tokyo Designers Block (TDB) is one of Tokyo&#x27;s main recurring design events. It is a 5-day exhibition showcasing hundreds of international and domestic designers of all backgrounds. Works are displayed all through Tokyo&#x27;s fashionable districts, in shop windows, exhibition spaces and galleries.

TDB is the brainchild of Teruo Kurosaki, president of Aoyama design shop Idée, who got the idea following a visit to London&#x27;s &quot;designersblock&quot;. &quot;TDB is not a design event nor a trade show of product designs; we are willing to make fun of design and try the best how design can do to the society in Tokyo.&quot;

<doc id="1343122" wikidata="Q1785507" url="?curid=1343122" title="Equerry">
<text>An equerry (; from French &#x27;stable&#x27;, and related to &#x27;squire&#x27;) is an officer of honour. Historically, it was a senior attendant with responsibilities for the horses of a person of rank. In contemporary use, it is a personal attendant, usually upon a sovereign, a member of a royal family, or a national representative. The role is equivalent to an aide-de-camp, but the term is now prevalent only among some members of the Commonwealth of Nations.

==Australia==
Australian equerries are commissioned officers in the Australian Defence Force, appointed on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis to the King of Australia, Governor General, state governors or to visiting foreign heads of state.

==Canada==
Canadian equerries are drawn from the commissioned officers of the Canadian Armed Forces, and are most frequently appointed to serve visiting members of the Canadian Royal Family. The equerry appointed for the King of Canada is a senior officer, typically a major or a lieutenant-commander, while the equerry appointed for a child of the monarch is a junior officer, typically a captain or naval lieutenant.

==New Zealand==
New Zealand equerries are appointed to serve the King of New Zealand only for the duration of a royal visit to the country, and are always drawn from the officers of the New Zealand Defence Force, typically captains, flight lieutenants, and navy lieutenants.

Squadron Leader Leanne Woon of the Operational Support Squadron, part of the Royal New Zealand Air Force, was the equerry to the Queen of New Zealand during the most recent royal visit in 2002. She was the only woman to serve as an equerry to the monarch anywhere in the Commonwealth until the appointment of Captain Katherine Anderson Royal Artillery as the British Equerry to King Charles III in 2024. Captain Sam Stevenson of the New Zealand Army served as equerry to the Duke of Cambridge during his 2005 visit to New Zealand. Squadron Leader Marcel &#x27;Shagga&#x27; Scott of the Royal New Zealand Air Force served as equerry to HRH Prince Charles in November 2012. Squadron Leader Tim Costley of the Royal New Zealand Air Force served as equerry to the Duke of Cambridge during the 2014 Royal visit to New Zealand by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince George.

==United Kingdom==

In the UK equerries are appointed by working members of the royal family and are drawn from junior officers of the British Armed Forces (normally captains or majors). The role involves being in regular close attendance both within the royal residence and outside on public engagements. 

The Royal Household also includes a number of &quot;extra equerries&quot; – honorary appointees drawn from among the current and retired senior officers of the Royal Household. They are comparatively rarely required for duty, but their attendance can be called upon if needed.

The Crown Equerry is in charge of the Royal Mews Department and holds a distinct office.

Equerries, temporary equerries and extra equerries are entitled to wear aiguillettes as part of their uniform, and to wear the appropriate royal cypher below their badges of rank on the shoulder board (or equivalent). Army officers serving as equerries or extra equerries may wear a distinctive cocked hat (with red and white upright feathers) when on duty in full dress uniform.

===Present-day===
At the time of King Charles III&#x27;s accession to the throne, the &#x27;Household of the former Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall&#x27; included two equerries. 

As of February 2024 the King&#x27;s Household included a senior equerry (Lt Col. Jonathan Thompson), an equerry (Lt Cdr Will Thornton) and two assistant equerries (Capt. Hugh Scrope, Coldstream Guards and Capt. Kat Anderson, Royal Artillery).

In 2022 the Queen appointed her own equerry (Maj. Oliver Plunkett, The Rifles). 

Individuals who have served as equerry to the king include:
Those appointed as extra equerries by King Charles III (since the year 2022) include:
* Vice Admiral Sir Tom Blackburn (former Master of the Household) in 2023
* Lieutenant Colonel Sir Andrew Ford (former Comptroller, the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Office) in 2023
*Commodore Anthony Morrow (former commanding officer of HMY Britannia) in 2023
*Admiral Sir George Zambellas (former First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff) in 2023
*Lieutenant General Sir Alistair Irwin (former Adjutant-General to the Forces) in 2023 
*Lieutenant General Sir John Lorimer (Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man) in 2023 
* Vice Admiral Sir Anthony Johnstone-Burt (Master of the Household) in 2023
* Lieutenant Colonel Sir Alexander Matheson of Matheson, Bt (Senior Gentleman Usher) in 2023
* Lieutenant Colonel Michael Vernon (Comptroller, the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Office) in 2023
* Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Segrave (Secretary, Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood) in 2023
*Sir Nicholas Bacon, 14th Baronet (former Lord Warden of the Stannaries) in 2023
*Commander Richard Aylard (former Private Secretary to the Prince of Wales) in 2023
*Major General Arthur Denaro (former Commandant of the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst) in 2023
*Sir Stephen Lamport (former Private Secretary to the Prince of Wales) in 2023
*Ashe Windham (formerly extra equerry to the Prince of Wales) in 2023

Other working members of the Royal Family can also appoint Equerries; in the case of more junior members the appointment might be combined with another post. Like the monarch, they may also appoint extra equerries.

===Past===
For most of her reign Queen Elizabeth II maintained an establishment of two equerries plus a temporary equerry: the senior equerry was a permanent appointment (joined to the position of Deputy Master of the Household); whereas the junior equerry (who routinely held office for three years) was appointed in turn from each of the three services of the British Armed Forces. The temporary equerry was a captain of the Coldstream Guards, who provided part-time attendance, and who (when not required for duty) was assigned to regimental or staff duties. 

On overseas tours to Commonwealth realms an equerry was often appointed from the local armed forces to serve for the duration of the tour.

At her funeral, the late Queen&#x27;s senior equerry and junior equerry, ten past equerries and two extra equerries marched together as pallbearers (following a custom established by Queen Victoria); in this role (which is separate from that of the bearer party which carried the coffin) they walked immediately alongside the late Queen&#x27;s coffin in each of the state funeral processions which took place in London and Windsor.

Individuals who served as equerry to Elizabeth II include:
Those appointed by Elizabeth II as extra equerries (since the year 2000) included:
* Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Segrave (Secretary, Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood) in 2019
* Lieutenant Colonel Michael Vernon (then Secretary, Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood, now Comptroller, the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Office) in 2015
* Vice Admiral Tony Johnstone-Burt (Master of the Household)
* Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Matheson, younger of Matheson (then Secretary, Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood, now Senior Gentleman Usher) in 2006
* Lieutenant Colonel Sir Andrew Ford (Comptroller, the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Office) in 2005
* Air Vice Marshal David Walker (Master of the Household) in 2005 
* Group Captain Timothy Hewlett (Director of Royal Travel) in 2001 
* Vice Admiral Sir James Weatherall (former Marshal of the Diplomatic Corps) in 2001
* Vice Admiral Tom Blackburn (Master of the Household) in 2000
* Lieutenant Colonel Robert Cartwright (Secretary, Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood) in 2000
Senior courtiers often continued as extra equerries (or could be appointed to the position) after retirement; as such, they were sometimes called upon to represent the Queen e.g. at funerals or memorial services for former colleagues.

Other senior royals generally followed the Queen&#x27;s pattern of appointing an equerry from one of the three armed services, in rotation; and of appointing a temporary equerry, often from a regiment with which they had personal links: e.g. the Duke of Edinburgh used to appoint a temporary equerry from the Grenadier Guards, the Queen Mother one from the Irish Guards, the Prince of Wales one from the Welsh Guards.

<doc id="1343126" wikidata="Q253686" url="?curid=1343126" title="Keiko Abe">
<text>is a Japanese composer and marimba player. She has been a primary figure in the development of the marimba, in terms of expanding both technique and repertoire, and through her collaboration with the Yamaha Corporation, developed the modern five-octave concert marimba.

== Biography ==
Abe began playing the xylophone while in elementary school in Tokyo, Japan, studying under Eiichi Asabuki. At age 13, she won an NHK talent contest and began performing professionally on live radio. She attended Tokyo Gakugei University where she completed a bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degree in music education. She began working in the Nippon Columbia, NHK, and other recording studios while in college.

Abe’s first encounter with a marimba took place in the early 1950s when Lawrence L. Lacour, an American missionary and professor at Oral Roberts University, brought four marimbas to Japan. In 1962, she and two friends (who were also students of Asabuki) founded the Xebec Marimba Trio, performing popular music, arrangements of folk songs and some of Abe&#x27;s arrangements. They recorded more than seven albums between 1962 and 1966. During this period, she had her own show on Japanese television, instructing schoolchildren in xylophone playing, as well as a radio show called &quot;Good Morning Marimba&quot;. She also began her recording career, putting out 13 albums in a five-year span.

In 1963, the Yamaha Corporation sought Japanese marimba players to assist in the design of their new instruments; Keiko Abe was chosen for her original and clear ideas of the marimba sound and design, particularly her concept of how the marimba should be able to blend in ensembles, for example, moving away from the inconsistencies and lack of focus of folk percussion instruments. Her ideas for the desired sound of the instruments guided Yamaha&#x27;s design, and in the 1970s, began production. In addition, at her urging, the range of the new marimba was stretched from four octaves to five, which has become the standard for soloists. Abe has been closely associated with Yamaha ever since, and their first ever signature series of keyboard percussion mallets bears her name.

In addition to performing, she is a composer. Her music is published primarily by Xebec Music Publishing, Tokyo and Schott, Japan. Her compositions, including &quot;Michi&quot;, &quot;Variations on Japanese Children&#x27;s Songs&quot;, and &quot;Dream of the Cherry Blossoms&quot;, have become standards of the marimba repertoire. Abe is active in promoting the development of literature for the marimba, not only by writing pieces herself, but also by commissioning works by other composers and encouraging young composers. One of the most performed percussion quartets featuring marimba, &quot;Marimba Spiritual,&quot; by Minoru Miki, is among the many works commissioned and supported by Abe, and is dedicated to her. She has added at least 70 compositions to the repertoire. She uses improvisation as an important element in developing her musical ideas which she then uses in her compositions.

In addition to her intensive composing, touring, and recording schedule, Abe has been a lecturer, then professor, at the Toho Gakuen School of Music in Tokyo since 1970. She was the first woman to be inducted into the Percussive Arts Society Hall of Fame in 1993.

Abe uses the YM-6100 Marimba. This modern concert marimba design, with five octaves of range, was developed with Abe in partnership with the Yamaha Corporation over a fifteen-year period (from 1969 to 1984).

In May 2021, Abe was one of 10 new members elected to the Royal Swedish Academy of Music, alongside Marika Field, Katarina Karnéus, Jonas Knutsson, Sten Sandell, Đuro Živković, Richard Sparks, Giancarlo Andretta, Stefan Dohr, and Quincy Jones.

<text>The Longest Day is a 1959 book by Cornelius Ryan telling the story of D-Day, the first day of the World War II invasion of Normandy. It details the &quot;coup de main&quot; operation by gliderborne troops, which captured the Caen canal and Orne river bridges (Pegasus Bridge and Horsa Bridge) before the main assault on the Normandy beaches. It sold tens of millions of copies in eighteen different languages. It is based on interviews with a cross-section of participants, including U.S., Canadian, British, French and German officers and civilians.

==Overview==
Ryan received both financial and research assistance from the &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, with excerpts from the book appearing in the Digest in June and July 1959. 

The book begins and ends in the village of La Roche-Guyon. The book refers to the village as being the most occupied village in occupied France and states that for each of the 543 inhabitants of La Roche-Guyon there were more than three German soldiers in the village and surrounding area. Field Marshal Erwin Rommel commander-in-chief of Army Group B had his headquarters in the castle of the village which was the seat of the Duc de La Rochefoucauld.

Ryan&#x27;s book is divided into three parts: the first part is titled &quot;The Wait&quot;, the second part is named &quot;The Night&quot; and the third part is named &quot;The Day&quot;. The book includes a section on the casualties of D-Day and also lists the contributors including their service details on the day of the invasion and their occupations at the time the book was first published. Ryan dedicated his book for all the men of D-Day.

Researchers spent almost three years locating survivors of D-Day and over 3000 interviews were undertaken in the United States, Canada, Great Britain, France and Germany. 383 accounts of D-Day were used in the text of the book.

Senior Allied officers who assisted the author included General Maxwell D. Taylor, Lieutenant General James M. Gavin, Lieutenant General Sir Frederick E. Morgan and General Sir Richard Nelson Gale. German officers who assisted with the book included Generaloberst Franz Halder, Hauptmann Hellmuth Lang and General der Infanterie Günther Blumentritt. The author also used Allied and German post action reports, war diaries, histories and official records.

On 6 June 1965, the author published an article &quot;More of The Longest Day&quot; in &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; as a supplement.

Editor Peter Schwed gave the book its title from a comment made by the German field marshal Erwin Rommel to his aide Hauptmann Helmuth Lang on April 22, 1944: &quot;...the first 24 hours of the invasion will be decisive...the fate of Germany depends on the outcome...for the Allies, as well as Germany, it will be the longest day.&quot;

==Reception==
Simon &amp; Schuster published &quot;The Longest Day: June 6, 1944&quot; in November 1959 with a first printing of 85,000 copies. The book was reprinted numerous times as it spent twenty-two weeks on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list

==Adaptation==
In 1962, the book was adapted into a Hollywood film of the same name.

In May 2014, publisher Andre Deutsch released the 70th Anniversary Collector&#x27;s Edition, with the addition of 120 photographs, 30 unpublished removable facsimile documents from the Cornelius Ryan Archive and cover by Brazilian photographer Rodrigo Bressane, depicting an interpretation of the iconic Helmet in Omaha Beach, as seen on the Hollywood adaptation.

<text>John Bachmann, Sr. (Jan 31,1817–May 22, 1899) was a Swiss-born lithographer and artist best known for his bird&#x27;s-eye views, especially of New York City. He was a journeyman lithographic artist in Switzerland and Paris until 1847. His first known American print (credited to &quot;C Bachmann&quot; as artist and &quot;J Bachmann&quot; as publisher) appeared in 1848, a view from an imagined point above Union Square in New York, looking south toward The Battery. In 1849 and 1850, he created and published a series of American views, including views of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, New Orleans and Havana. Both directly copied and used as a primary source by other lithographers at home and in Europe, these were the first major bird&#x27;s eye views (drawn from an imagined perspective), as opposed to panoramic views (views drawn directly from the artists experience) in the United States (smaller views had appeared as early as the 1820s).


Although best known for his views of New York, his name is attached to a variety of prints, including the well-known &quot;Bird&#x27;s Eye View of the Seat of War&quot; series produced during the American Civil War, which show the theater of war in six sections, each a perspective view of entire states or sets of states.

Bachmann married twice, having 5 children with his first wife, 4 for whom were born in Switzerland, and one in Brooklyn, NY and had then four children with his second wife (Eliza), the eldest of whom, John Bachmann, Jr. also became a lithographer. Except for two brief sojourns in Philadelphia, he appears to have remained in the Heights neighborhood of Jersey City from the late 1850s until his death in 1899. Most of his views of New York City manage to sneak in his home neighborhood in Jersey City. His last known work, a view of Havana, is now in the collection of the Library of Congress. The one other known painting by Bachmann, a version of one of his views of Philadelphia, hangs in the Free Library of Philadelphia.
He immigrated to New York on 6 Nov. 1848 with his first wife and one surviving child from his first wife (Anna) on the ship Lady Arabella.

<doc id="1343136" wikidata="Q5602421" url="?curid=1343136" title="Green Clay">
<text>Green Clay (August 14, 1757 – October 31, 1828) was an American businessman, planter, military officer and politician in Virginia and Kentucky. Clay served in the American Revolutionary War and helped form the new state of Kentucky after representing its Madison County in the Virginia Ratifying Convention of 1788 and in the Virginia House of Delegates which ultimately authorized creation of the new state of Kentucky. He also served in Kentucky&#x27;s constitutional convention and in both houses of the Kentucky General Assembly, which would name a county for him in 1807. During the War of 1812 Clay was commissioned as a general and led the Kentucky militia in the relief of Fort Meigs in Ohio. He was believed to be one of the wealthiest men of the state, owning tens of thousands of acres of land, many slaves, several distilleries, a tavern, and ferries, although one of his sons, Cassius Marcellus Clay would become a prominent abolitionist.

==Early life and education==
Clay was born in 1757 to Charles and Martha Clay, in then-vast Cumberland County in the Colony of Virginia, probably in the eastern part which Virginia&#x27;s legislature split off from Cumberland in 1777 to become Powhatan County. His elder brothers included Rev. Charles Clay (1745–1820) and Matthew Clay who later became a U.S. Congressman. Green Clay received a private education suitable to his class, and apprenticed to a surveyor. He was a cousin of Virginia politician and Kentucky&#x27;s famous US Congressman and statesman Henry Clay, as well as and Alabama governor Clement Comer Clay.

==American Revolutionary War==

During the American Revolution, Clay enlisted as a private in Captain William McCracken&#x27;s Company, which was part of Clark&#x27;s Illinois Regiment of Virginia Militia. Thus he served under General George Rogers Clark during the Illinois Campaign. Green Clay also served for a time with the Continental Army.

==Kentucky politician and businessman==

Perhaps inspired by Daniel Boone, Clay had moved to then-vast Kentucky County by 1777. By 1781 he received an appointment as deputy surveyor of Lincoln County, Virginia which ultimately became part of the new state of Kentucky.

When Virginia&#x27;s legislature created Madison County. Clay became one of the new county&#x27;s (part-time) delegates to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1787, and won re-election twice, thus serving twice with Thomas Kennedy, then with John Miller. Meanwhile, Green Clay also won election as one of Madison County&#x27;s two representatives in the Virginia Ratifying Convention of 1788 (with John Miller; and his elder brother Rev. Charles Clay represented Bedford County, Virginia). Both Clay brothers (and John Miller) voted for adoption of amendments to the proposed federal Constitution, and unsuccessfully voted against ratification without them.

By 1793, Clay had become a justice of the peace in Madison County and by year&#x27;s end was elected to the lower house of Kentucky&#x27;s legislature. After two years in that body, he won election in 1795 to the Kentucky Senate (a four-year term). He returned as a Kentucky state senator in 1802 and continued in that role until 1808, when fellow senators elected him their speaker.In 1799 Green Clay was a leader in Kentucky&#x27;s second constitutional convention. Later he was elected and served at various time in both the house and senate of the Kentucky General Assembly, including a term as speaker of the Senate. However, he failed to win election as governor, then retired from elective politics.

In 1802, Clay had become one of the trustees of Transylvania University, and attempted to lure fellow Virginian James Madison to become that college&#x27;s president. However, as speaker of the Kentucky senate, he nominated Madison for U.S. president.
Although Clay was listed as both non-resident and non-tithable in Madison County during the 1787 Virginia tax census, he owned at least a horse and eleven cattle in the county at the time. Over the next decades, Clay developed and owned several distilleries and a tavern in central Kentucky, where development occurred near Lexington. He also provided ferry service at several stops across the winding Kentucky River.

==War of 1812==
During the War of 1812, Clay was commissioned as a general in the Kentucky militia. In the spring of 1813, he was ordered to the aid of General William Henry Harrison, who was besieged by British forces led by Gen. Proctor at Fort Meigs, Ohio. Clay and the three thousand men he had brought fought their way into the fort; and the British and native forces ultimately withdrew. However, many of his men were taken prisoner by Tecumseh after they had captured a British artillery battery. Moreover, when the British abandoned the siege, Clay was left in command of the fort. He remained in command when the British returned in July 1813. Though Tecumseh attempted to lure Clay and the garrison out of the fort (by staging a mock battle that appearing to ambush a column of American reinforcements), Clay was not fooled, since he knew no reinforcements were coming. He was able to hold out until the British again retreated, and ultimately Clay and his militiamen returned home.

==Personal life==
In 1795, Green Clay at 38 married the much younger Sally Lewis (d. 1867) in Kentucky. She was the daughter of Thomas and Elizabeth (Payne) Lewis. They had seven children, of whom six survived to adulthood. Their first child was Elizabeth Lewis Clay (1798–1887) and other daughters were Pauline, Sallie, and Sophia (b. 1813; d. 1814). 
Their sons were Sidney, Brutus J. Clay (b. 1808), Elijah (b. 1815), and Cassius Marcellus Clay (b. 1810). At age 17, Elizabeth married John Speed Smith, who became a politician in Kentucky and U.S. Congressman.

==Later years==
After the war, Clay returned to his plantation. He also published a pamphlet &#x27;To the People of Kentucky and of the United States&#x27; (1825) that concerned disputed title in the Tennessee River Valley.
He also directed the labor of his many slaves in cultivating commodity crops of tobacco and hemp. He is thought to have been the wealthiest man in Kentucky of his time, as his many slaves were valuable as property.

==Death and legacy==

Green Clay suffered from face cancer in his final years. He died at his Richmond, Kentucky home in 1828 at the age of 73, and was buried in the nearby family cemetery.
His widow Sally Lewis Clay married again, to Jeptha Dudley, a Baptist minister. She moved with him to Frankfort, Kentucky, living there for nearly 40 years before her death in 1867.

His grandson Green Clay Smith was named for his maternal grandfather. Like his father, and maternal uncles Brutus and Cassius, and several cousins, he also became a politician in Kentucky and the U.S. Congress.
Clay County, Kentucky, was named in his honor in 1807, during his lifetime.

<doc id="1343137" wikidata="Q805429" url="?curid=1343137" title="Ballymena United F.C.">
<text>Ballymena United Football Club is a semi-professional football club from Northern Ireland. Based in Ballymena, County Antrim, the team competes in the NIFL Premiership and plays home matches at the Ballymena Showgrounds. The club has been managed by former captain Jim Ervin since 2023.

The club was formed in 1934 after the dissolution of [[Ballymena F.C.|Ballymena]], a club formed on 7 April 1928 when four local businessmen and football enthusiasts decided that the town of Ballymena needed a senior football team in the Irish League. Nicknamed the &#x27;Braidmen&#x27; or &#x27;Sky Blues&#x27;, latterly because of the colour of the home shirts, United have won the Irish Cup five times. The main club rivals of Ballymena United are Coleraine. The annual Boxing Day derby fixture between the two teams attracts large crowds and is one of the high-profile fixtures in the Northern Irish football league calendar.

==Club history==

===Foundation and the War (1934–1946)===
Following the demise of Ballymena Football Club at the end of the 1933–34 season, three men, Simon McCrory, William McNeice and T. Moore, set about forming a new club in Ballymena with a view to seeking admission to the Irish League as Ballymena&#x27;s replacement. Crusaders were also applicants for the vacancy, but at the League&#x27;s annual general meeting on 20 June 1934, the new club known as Ballymena United was chosen unanimously.

Ballymena United approached the new season with some confidence. The new club took an unprecedented step by appointing a manager which was a departure from the previous practice of team selection by committee. The man in charge was Joe Millar who arrived from Bournemouth &amp; Boscombe and had previously been capped for Ireland, Millar used many of his contacts in Scotland to bring an influx of Scottish players to the Showgrounds. However, despite these new players and an Irish Cup semi-final appearance United suffered in their first season finishing a disappointing tenth in the League, their lowest finish to date. The 1934–35 also seen the introduction of the Reserve side at the Showgrounds.

The 1935–36 season was to be just as disheartening for United supporters as the club finished tenth again in the League table and failed to progress in the majority of the cup competitions. If the previous season was one to forget, any hope that 1936–37 would bring any cheer was dashed during the close season with the departure of Jock McNinch to Sligo Rovers. McNinch was leaving the club after 315 games and with him the last remaining link to the &#x27;old&#x27; Ballymena side. During the summer his contribution to the club was recognised when the club granted him a testimonial, the first such gesture by United.

Ballymena United finished bottom of the Irish League for the first time, after managing only four league wins over the course of the season. An Irish Cup run to the semi-final stage, before elimination to the mighty Belfast Celtic was the only cheer for the Light Blues. They carried this disastrous form into the following season when they suffered a record defeat to Derry City (1–9) and losing the next six games before the board appointed Steve Mitchell as player-manager – he instantly turned things around as Ballymena won 14 of their next 17 games. Despite their Championship form they rose from bottom to fifth in the table, only 8 points behind eventual winners Belfast Celtic. The club also made their first appearance in the final of the County Antrim Shield though lost 3–2 to Linfield.

This run of confidence ran all the way through to the following season, as Ballymena United nearly completed a double of the Irish League and Irish Cup – eventually finishing runners-up in both competitions. Finishing five points behind Belfast Celtic in the league race and a fourth Irish Cup final saw a third defeat to Linfield in the showpiece event, this time a 2–0 defeat at Solitude. However, one year on Ballymena United went one better by lifting the 1940 Irish Cup after a 2–0 win over Glenavon in which Sclater and Moore. This was the last &#x27;proper&#x27; Irish Cup before province wide football was suspended due to World War II. United did not play again until the 1946–47 season. The club withdrew from the Irish League shortly after the end of the season when the Showgrounds was taken over to assist the war effort.

===Post-war United (1946–1957)===
Even though World War II ended in time for the commencement of the 1945–46 season, it was not until the following term that Ballymena United made their comeback into the Irish League. Home friendlies early in 1946 were arranged against Belfast Celtic and Linfield but both were cancelled because the Showgrounds complex was not ready following the removal of the troops who were stationed there.

A new manager, Billy Reid, was appointed on 1 May but only lasted until late October, resigning after citing he could not devote enough time to the job and control of team affairs went back to committee. United made their comeback on 17 August 1946 with a 2–1 home victory in the Gold Cup against Distillery. The Braidmen joined the Irish Regional League in its final season before the return of the Irish League the following season and finished sixth. The Sky Blues did suffer their heaviest ever defeat during the Regional League campaign, losing 10–1 to Belfast Celtic. Ballymena United began the 1947–48 season with a new manager, Bob McKay, who was promoted from his role last season as chief scout and had previously been in charge of Dundee United. McKay guided Ballymena United to an impressive third place in the Irish League. Despite a first round exit to Linfield in the Irish Cup, the game attracted a record crowd of 9,067 and was a real end-to-end affair which afterwards saw the transfer of Frankie Houghton to Newcastle United for £6,000 – which was quite a considerable sum back then.

April 1948 saw United play their first competitive game outside Northern Ireland when they travelled to Dublin to play Shelbourne in the Inter-City Cup, a game which Ballymena lost 1–0 but progressed to the quarterfinals after winning the first leg 4–1 – this set up a clash with Shamrock Rovers who won the tie 8–3 on aggregate. The season did not end trophyless as a 2–1 victory over Linfield in May 1948 brought the County Antrim Shield to the Ballymena Showgrounds for the first time in the club&#x27;s history – that game saw the competitive debut of Eric Trevorrow, a 20-year-old signing from Glasgow junior club, Parkhead Juniors.

The following season began with much optimism after the success of the previous campaign, this optimism did not last long as Ballymena finished a disappointing tenth in the Irish League and failed to make any headway in any of the cup competitions. This ultimately cost Bob McKay his job in May 1949 during a stormy AGM, as McKay berated the board for interference with his team selections. Norman Kernaghan took over as player-manager and after a moderate first season he finished his second campaign as Irish Cup finalists and County Antrim Shield winners in 1950–51 – beating Cliftonville in the final.

For the second successive season Ballymena lifted a piece of silverware – one of only two occasions this has occurred – as Ballymena United lifted the Festival of Britain Cup after beating Crusaders 3–0 in the final in May 1952. The competition took the place of the Ulster Cup for one year as part of the Festival of Britain celebrations to mark the end of the war and the revival of Britain. The Sky Blues finished sixth in the race for the Gibson Cup and defender Eric Trevorrow was given the prestigious honour of being named Ulster Footballer of the Year by the Castlereagh Glentoran Supporters Club.

A third-place finish that season had many believing that United would pick up where they left off, becoming the biggest provincial side in the country; Having been the first team outside Belfast to win the County Antrim Shield. However, a series of poor seasons was stopped in 1951 with the club&#x27;s second County Antrim Shield – beating Cliftonville 2–0.

Despite the fact that the Irish League had not left Celtic Park between 1936 and 1948; Belfast Celtic was forced to leave the Irish League and Ballymena benefited by grabbing some of their talented players, including a new player-manager Billy McMillan. McMillan was replaced by the experienced Walter Rickett after two seasons. United reached the Irish Cup Final in 1951, only to be beaten by Glentoran 3–1 at Windsor Park, with their only goal coming from Currie.

The following season, Ballymena United won the Festival of Britain Cup, beating Crusaders 3–0 at Solitude. The one-off competition was played in 1952 to coincide with the Festival celebrations throughout Great Britain, and the trophy still resides at the Showgrounds.

However, after this victory United went through another bleak period in the mid-1950s as United finished bottom of the league twice. In 1955 the club was forced to launch an appeal to clear its mounting debts – the Ballymena people responded – debts were paid, and a small amount was left over to go into the club&#x27;s coffers.

===New beginning (1957–1969)===
In 1957, Scottish born Alex McCrae took over as player-manager of Ballymena United – he had been a successful inside-forward for Charlton Athletic and Middlesbrough in his playing days. He brought instant success to the Braid, as Ballymena finished third and won the Irish Cup in 1957–58.

The 1958 Irish Cup winning team was deemed one of the best Ballymena United teams ever to grace the Showgrounds, as they deservedly beat Jackie Milburn&#x27;s Linfield in the showpiece final – with McGhee and Russell scoring the goals in a 2–0 win at the Oval in front of 24,000 spectators.

The next year, with another impressive team marched onto another Irish Cup final (their eighth final); the Sky Blues were expected to beat Glenavon in a Windsor Park final. However, United&#x27;s bad luck struck again as they failed to beat Glenavon, only drawing 1–1 and were defeated 2–0 in the replay.

Former Liverpool legend, Geoff Twentyman, then came along as manager and brought the Ulster Cup to the Showgrounds in 1960 with a 3–1 win over Glenavon. Barr grabbed two final goals while McKinstry picked up the other. The following season, the Sky Blues were only two points away from winning the Irish League for the first time – finishing third in 1961–62.

Twentyman&#x27;s success did not continue, and he was replaced in time by George Smith, Dave Hickson, Alex Parker, and Dave Hickson again. Despite this hunt for success manager after manager failed, as the Braidmen constantly finished mid-table in the Irish League, with only one trophy in the 1960s. McCrae was then brought back to end another period of failure at the Warden Street Showgrounds

===The rollercoaster seventies (1970–1978)===
The Sky Blues reached an Irish Cup Final in 1970 as a mere 12,000, just over half the average Irish Cup final attendance in those days, watched United fall 2–1 to Linfield at Solitude. Fleming grabbed an early goal which proved United&#x27;s un-doing as they then mistakenly tried to sit back and defend out the remainder of the game. Incidentally this was Linfield&#x27;s last game at Solitude for over a quarter of a century, due to civil unrest. The other interesting point is that it was the first Irish Cup Final with substitutes – Nicholl filled that role for United.

Next came a colourful time in United&#x27;s history as one of the most &#x27;colourful&#x27; and arguably one of the most talented of United&#x27;s players – Sammy Frickelton was appearing at the Showgrounds to the delight of many fans. Scottish born Frickelton was followed by controversy but was still an exciting part of the club&#x27;s history.

Teenage goalkeeper Jim Platt was transferred to Middlesbrough (where he won 21 caps for Northern Ireland) for £7,000 and Ballymena Council purchased the Showgrounds in two major off the field happenings.
United was now under the charge of Arthur Stewart (as McCrae mysteriously resigned after a board member complained about his wages) as player/manager. United were involved in the incident which led to Derry City&#x27;s expulsion from the Irish League as their bus was burnt on a visit to the Brandywell during the height of the troubles in the province.

On the field Jimmy Martin was the major sensation as his goals brought United&#x27;s best performance in the ill-fated Texaco Cup – where the Sky Blues lost to Scottish side Airdieonians at the semi-final stage 1972, who went on to lose to Derby County in the final. United picked up the City Cup in 1971 for the only time in their history; Bobby Averill scored the goal as the Sky Blues picked up a long overdue trophy against Ards at the Oval.

In 1974 that same club beat United in the Irish Cup Final at Windsor Park. John Sloan scored but Ards ran out 2–1 winners. However, United won the Gold Cup – beating Glentoran 3–2 with Quentin McFall, Dessie Orr and Jimmy Brown scoring for the Sky Blues for the first and only time in the competition&#x27;s prestigious history.

United then lost the final of the Gold Cup to Coleraine the subsequent year and Arthur Stewart was dismissed after a good service to the club, particularly in the early seasons of his five years in the notoriously unstable Ballymena hotseat.

Former favourite from the 1958 side Eddie Russell became player-manager and scored as United won the County Antrim Shield for the first time in 25 years – beating Distillery 4–0 at Inver Park. After the burning of the stand and by social club members of the travelling community, the Showgrounds underwent major work and the side was unable to play at the main pitch until the next season. On the pitch too United experienced more problems – going 13 matches without victory at one stage. Russell was sacked as a result of the team&#x27;s poor performances and in came Billy Johnston.

United lost the 1978 Irish Cup Final 3–1 to Linfield at the Oval to complete a league and cup double. This meant though that Ballymena experienced a historic first in qualifying for the European Cup Winners Cup. United entertained top Belgian side SK Beveren, losing 3–0 and the score was repeated two weeks later in Antwerp, as the Braidmen fell 6–0 on aggregate.

===The glory years (1979–1989)===
During the 1978–79 season Johnston made way for the arrival of Alan Campbell and he moulded arguably one of the best United teams of recent years, who would constantly challenge for honours and even came second in the Irish League in 1979–80. This meant qualification for the UEFA Cup for the first time and a first (and only) win in Europe against East-German outfit FC Vorwaerts, only losing narrowly in the second leg.

On route to an early season cup game against Ards, manager Alan Campbell was involved in a car accident which meant that managerial duties had to be passed over to his assistant, Ivan Murray, on a caretaker basis as Campbell recovered from his horrific accident.

The following season seen a remarkable United side finish third and lift both the Irish Cup and the County Antrim Shield in the one campaign. The Irish Cup win over Glenavon was by a single Paul Malone strike at Windsor Park. Former Northern Ireland manager, Nigel Worthington was transferred to Notts County for a club record £125,000 fee after the Irish Cup win; United had also lost influential midfielder Gerry Mullan to Everton earlier in the season. The reward for the Cup win was a Cup Winners&#x27; Cup tie against Italian giants AS Roma, the Sky Blues fought valiantly but succumbed to the relentless pressure of the multimillion-pound side and lost 6–0 on aggregate.

Ivan Murray took over from Alan Campbell who resigned in January 1982, but failed to reproduce the team&#x27;s best form and was duly dismissed to be replaced by former Crusaders boss Ian Russell – who many thought would definitely bring success back to Warden Street.

Russell failed to take the Sky Blues to the next level, despite bringing Northern Ireland goalkeeper Jim Platt back home and also seen the late George Best turn out for the Sky Blues in a Friendly against Scottish side Motherwell. Russell barely lasted six months at the Showgrounds before being sacked by the trigger happy board.

After Ian Russell&#x27;s departure, it was Jim Platt who took over as player-manager at the Showgrounds and United, inspired by Sion Mills teenager Johnny Speak, defeated Carrick Rangers in the Irish Cup Final in 1984. However, after becoming the first United player to win a full International cap since 1933 – he unceremoniously left to take up the managers role at bitter rivals Coleraine.

Alan Campbell returned for his second spell in June 1984, but left after only one season due to a combination of poor results and the fans treatment of his son; Alan Campbell Jnr. However, in that season Ballymena suffered what the press described as &quot;One of the most embarrassing results in the club&#x27;s history&quot; – losing in both legs to Maltese minnows Ħamrun Spartans in the First Round of the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup.

Soon after this, Brian Crockard, United&#x27;s outstanding young defender died whilst on holiday, Crockard, a former United player of the year, is still remembered to this day having the player&#x27;s lounge named after him at the Showgrounds.

Jimmy Brown took the reigned from the departed Campbell in May 1985, but despite two full seasons in charge at Warden Street he could not turn the team&#x27;s fortunes with only a single County Antrim Shield Final appearance to show for his troubles, he resigned in September 1987 after a humiliating defeat to Larne.

In stepped former Reserve Team boss Alex McKee, with John Garrett as his assistant fired the Sky Blues to the Irish Cup the following season, defeating Larne in a lack-lustre showpiece final in which Paul Hardy proved to be the winner with a cheeky back-heel past Vince Magee in the Larne goal. The reward for the win was a plum tie against Belgian giants RSC Anderlecht – who proceeded to give United a footballing masterclass the following season, winning 10–0 on aggregate

===Barren nineties (1990–1999)===
The Irish League came up with the idea of promotion and relegation, and decided that they would combine the places of the 1993–94 and 1994–95 seasons to form a total score, on which to base a league upon. After a shaky start from Hagan, he was replaced by former Glentoran-boss Tommy Jackson, who fared no better. After a dismal season, he lasted only a couple of months into the following campaign before the axe was wielded yet again by the United board in October 1994.

The managerial merry-go-round continued when local man Gary Erwin was appointed in October 1994 in a vain attempt to secure a place in the Premier League, despite a famous win against Linfield, he failed miserably and was shown the door in March 1995. Alan Fraser was brought in at the end of the 1994–95 season, in order to prepare for the forthcoming First Division campaign (second tier of Northern Irish football at this time). Despite throwing the money about, United finished the following season well behind runaway leaders, Coleraine.

1996–97&#x27;s crop of players finally brought a League Championship to the Ballymena Showgrounds for the first time, albeit the First Division, which Alan Fraser&#x27;s side impressively won at a canter. This also ensured promotion to the top-flight after two seasons in the First Division as 21 wins from 28 games meant an astounding 15 point gap between United&#x27;s nearest challengers, Omagh Town, in second place. Fraser&#x27;s talented side also were close to a &#x27;double&#x27; when they cruelly lost the final of the County Antrim Shield to Cliftonville on penalties after being on top for most of the game. The season ended with Dessie Loughery&#x27;s testimonial against Coleraine at the Showgrounds, which produced a stunning 5–1 victory to give the United fans a taste of what to expect the following season.

Ballymena United made a blistering start in their first season in the Premier League in 1997–98 and looked to be genuine title challengers by Christmas time as they topped the table after a stunning 4–3 victory over reigning Champions Crusaders – which also meant one of the biggest crowds in years at Warden Street for the Boxing Day derby against Coleraine; with an estimated 7,000 strong crowd packing into the Showgrounds. In typical fashion it all went off the rails for Alan Fraser&#x27;s side as he splashed out a club record fee of £20,000 for Crusaders striker Glenn Hunter but the goals never came and the in-form Barry Patton also saw his goals dry up as Ballymena finished sixth in the table – missing out on a top half finish on goal difference. The season almost ended in a trophy as they reached the final of the Irish News Cup, a cross-border cup competition for clubs in the North-West – but lost out to Omagh Town over two legs.

Fraser&#x27;s aging side failed to push on the following season and the money was beginning to dry up restricting suitable replacements being brought in. Failure again to break into the top half of the Premier League table in 1999 was offset by a disappointing non-performance in the Irish Cup semi-final against Portadown, which ironically turned out to be &#x27;final&#x27; as Portadown lifted the Irish Cup by default following Cliftonville&#x27;s dismissal for fielding an ineligible player. Alan Fraser was relieved of his duties for failing to meet the ambitions of the United board just hours after the final League game of the season, which also proved to be long-serving Dessie Loughery&#x27;s last game as he made a controversial move to Coleraine after 11 years at the Braid. Shay Hamill took charge for the final of the Irish News Cup, but for the second consecutive season Ballymena lost the final this time to Johnny Speak&#x27;s Finn Harps. The search began for a new manager at Warden Street and a new era awaited.

===The wait goes on (2000–2011)===
Fraser&#x27;s replacement and the man set to lead Ballymena United into the new century was former Glenavon and Bangor manager, Nigel Best who was appointed in May 1999. However, with his predecessor&#x27;s aging side starting to break up and with little money to finance quality replacements; it was little surprise when Best&#x27;s team struggled badly during the 1999–00 campaign. Striker and talisman Glenn Hunter proved his worth by almost single-handedly keeping the Sky Blues in the division, as United avoided relegation on the final day of the season after defeating Portadown at Shamrock Park to maintain top-flight status amidst wild scenes of jubilation.

More departures followed the following summer and despite an encouraging start to the 2000–01 season, United&#x27;s frailties caught up with them and Nigel Best was sacked after an unacceptable run of results in December 2000, cumulating with a 5–2 defeat to Newry Town. Bizarrely the club appointed unqualified club physiotherapist George Magill was caretaker-manager until a suitable successor to Best could be found; Glenn Hunter, who had taken time out of the game to pursue a fire-fighting career would act as Magill&#x27;s assistant. In January 2001, former Coleraine manager Kenny Shiels took the reins of the Showgrounds side with the sole aim of keeping the Braidmen in the Premier League. Despite a late flurry in the final weeks of the campaign Ballymena just were not good enough and suffered relegation to the First Division after failing to defeat Portadown at home, when a win would have at least guaranteed another shot at survival in the play-offs.

It proved a season of rebuilding in the second-tier of Irish League football as the erratic Shiels made a number of &#x27;big-name&#x27; signings which all flopped before the eyes of the supporters; former Northern Ireland goalkeeper Tommy Wright, former Leeds United defender Paul Beesley and Liberian striker Leon Browne all failed miserably to make an impact at the Braid. This left Shiels with a number of totally inexperienced teenagers fighting his cause, however despite their best efforts, slumped to a dismal fifth-place finish during the 2001–02 season – Ballymena United&#x27;s lowest ever placing in their history.

Despite the previous season&#x27;s disappointment, Shiels&#x27; side bounced back with style the following season. Buoyed by the completion of an impressive new 2,000 seated stand at the Showgrounds, the free-scoring Sky Blues were playing an exciting and unstoppable brand of football, however finished the season with little to show for their season as they finished runners-up in the Ulster Cup, County Antrim Shield and First Division. The league campaign was particularly sickening, despite promotion, for Ballymena fans as they were leading the table for many weeks, only to capitulate to Dungannon Swifts during the final run-in. Media attention also circled around starlet striker Shea Campbell who bagged 38 goals and a Northern Ireland Under-21 cap as he was being hawked to moves across the water and also in the Irish League before committing himself to the Sky Blues.

Promotion back to the restricted sixteen team Premier League proved difficult at first for Shiels and his untested side – however the influence from former Nottingham Forest forward Nigel Jemson proved key to Ballymena&#x27;s success during the 2003–04 campaign as they equalled their best placed finish in the Premier League by finishing sixth and also gaining a return to European competition for the first time in 15 years through the Intertoto Cup. Ballymena travelled to Danish side Odense in June 2004 and produced a remarkable scoreless draw against the full-time side – only to lose the home second leg heavily with Spanish side Villarreal waiting in the next round.

Shiels was given the finance to attempt to bring the Gibson Cup to Mid-Antrim for the first time and signed a number of quality local players in Rory Hamill, Gary Smyth, Gordon Simms and Tim McCann but his team did not produce a return on his investment and eventually cost Shiels his job after seasons at the helm. The final nail in the coffin was the Irish Cup semi-final defeat to minnows Larne at the Oval, as the Braidmen finished a disappointing eighth after a season that had promised so much.

Former Northern Ireland and Ballymena United goalkeeper Tommy Wright took over as manager on a full-time basis – a first for the club. Despite a slow start, he stamped his authority on the side bringing a number of new players in including a young Scottish striker Kevin Kelbie, whose goals in the second half of the season almost fired United to their first trophy in 17 years when they agonisingly lost the County Antrim Shield final to Linfield at Seaview. A credible seventh place was reward for Wright&#x27;s work over the course of the 2005–06 season.

The following year proved disappointing as the club failed to make any progression to becoming a side capable of winning trophies after finishing ninth, the highlight of the season was the visit of English Premier League side Manchester City to Warden Street as part of the transfer deal that took goalkeeper Richard McKinney to England eight years earlier. The next season though saw Wright&#x27;s side finally come of age as after an incredible 4–2 victory at the Oval on New Year&#x27;s Day 2008 they looked like potential title challengers. This was to be the pinnacle of the success as teenage sensation Johnny Flynn was sold to Blackburn Rovers and Wright was linked with a move to Norwich City. Although the manager signed a new contract in January his team collapsed in their pursuit of success and Wright resigned in April 2008 only to re-emerge at Norwich a few months later. Jim Grattan was appointed caretaker manager briefly before Roy Walker took charge from 2008 to 2011 when he was sacked after little progress made during his time at the club.

===Glenn Ferguson era (2011–2016)===
Following Walker&#x27;s sacking, United asked permission from Lisburn Distillery to speak to their first team coach Glenn Ferguson and they successfully appointed him in June 2011. During Ferguson&#x27;s tenure they secured their first major trophy in quite a while by winning the County Antrim Shield and reaching the 2014 Irish Cup final before losing to Glenavon by 2–1 with the Mid-Ulster side winning their first Irish Cup in 17 years. The following year, United reached the semi-final of the Irish Cup before being defeated 3–1 by Portadown at The Oval. United started the 2015–16 in horrible form. Losing to promoted side Carrick Rangers losing 1–7 to Glenavon and being hammered by bitter rivals Coleraine. The Sky Blues form picked up, with them beating champions Crusaders 2–0 before beating Linfield in the County Antrim Shield final at Windsor Park. Ferguson was sacked in 2016 following a concerning slide in form that threatened the club&#x27;s Premiership status.

===David Jeffrey era (2016–2023)===
Following the sacking, the club spoke to legendary former Linfield manager and player David Jeffrey who, going into the interview, had little interest in the job. He found himself very impressed by what the board had to say, though, and decided to take the job, bringing former assistant Brian McLaughlin to the Showgrounds. His debut as manager was a 1–1 draw with champions Crusaders and his team won a series of games before going on a losing run, failing to enter the Europa League Play-Offs following a 0–2 defeat to relegation-threatened Portadown. The following season, The Sky Blues had a relatively good season, spending a lot of time in the top six and they reached the League Cup final against Carrick Rangers after beating rivals Coleraine 3–0 after extra time. They won the league cup against Carrick rangers following goals from Allan Jenkins and Conor McCloskey. The 2017/18 season was a relatively average season for the braid men as experienced players brought into the team during the transfer window did not work out as planned for David Jeffrey and his staff, the club finished the season in sixth place and lost out on a Europa League spot to Cliftonilee in the NIFL play-off system. Following a squad revamp of nine players coming through the doors in the summer transfer window the club had a good season reaching the league cup final and finishing second in the league. Between October and December, they had a 19-game unbeaten run.

In June they defeated Faroese team NSI Runavik at the Showgrounds 2–0 and progressed to the next round after an away scoreless draw. In July they played in the UEFA Europa League qualifying rounds 2019 and were defeated by Malmö FF 7–0 away and 0–4 at the Showgrounds.

Jeffrey and assistant Brian McLaughlin would depart the club in the summer of 2023, following a poor season in which United finished a distant 9th, and lost in the Irish Cup final to Crusaders.

===Jim Ervin Era 2023-===
The club appointed former captain Jim Ervin, as Jeffreys replacement in 2023. Ervin was faced with a reduced budget on account of missing European football in the past two seasons, with many high-profile names, such as David McDaid and Craig Farquhar departing the club.

<doc id="1343139" wikidata="Q468484" url="?curid=1343139" title="The Longest Day (film)">
<text>The Longest Day is a 1962 American epic war film based on Cornelius Ryan&#x27;s 1959 non-fiction book of the same name about the D-Day landings in Normandy on June 6, 1944. The film was produced by Darryl F. Zanuck for 20th Century Fox, and is directed by Ken Annakin (British and French exteriors), Andrew Marton (American exteriors), and Bernhard Wicki (German scenes). The screenplay was written by Ryan, with additional material written by Romain Gary, James Jones, David Pursall and Jack Seddon.

The film features a large international ensemble cast that includes John Wayne, Kenneth More, Richard Todd, Robert Mitchum, Richard Burton, Steve Forrest, Sean Connery, Henry Fonda, Red Buttons, Peter Lawford, Eddie Albert, Jeffrey Hunter, Stuart Whitman, Tom Tryon, Rod Steiger, Leo Genn, Gert Fröbe, Irina Demick, Bourvil, Curd Jürgens, George Segal, Robert Wagner, Paul Anka and Arletty. Many of these actors played roles that were essentially cameo appearances. Several cast members had seen action as servicemen during the war, including Albert, Fonda, Genn, More, Steiger and Todd, the latter having been among the first British officers to land in Normandy in Operation Overlord and participate in the assault on Pegasus Bridge.

The filmmakers employed several actual Allied and Axis D-Day participants as consultants, many of whom had their roles re-enacted in the film. These included Günther Blumentritt (a former German general), James M. Gavin (an American general), Frederick Morgan (Deputy Chief of Staff at SHAEF), John Howard (who led the airborne assault on the Pegasus Bridge), Lord Lovat (who commanded the 1st Special Service Brigade), Philippe Kieffer (who led his men in the assault on Ouistreham), Marie-Pierre Kœnig (who commanded the Free French Forces in the invasion), Max Pemsel (a German general), Werner Pluskat (the major who was the first German officer to see the invasion fleet), Josef &quot;Pips&quot; Priller (the hot-headed pilot) and Lucie Rommel (widow of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel).

&quot;The Longest Day&quot; premiered in France on September 25, 1962, and in the United States on October 4. It received acclaim from critics and was a significant commercial success, becoming the highest-grossing black-and-white movie at the time. At the 35th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for five Oscars, including Best Picture, and won awards for Best Cinematography (Black-and-White) and Best Special Effects.

==Plot==
Shot in a docudrama style (with captions identifying the different participants), the film opens in the days leading up to D-Day, depicting events on both sides of the English Channel. There is disagreement within the German High Command as to where the Allies will land and how the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; should respond, but the threat is not perceived to be imminent, given the stormy weather. On June 5, 1944, not wanting to keep his forces waiting any longer, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, Supreme Commander of SHAEF, makes the decision to go ahead with plans to invade France through Normandy the following day after receiving a somewhat hopeful weather report.

In the early hours of June 6, Allied airborne troops are sent in to take key locations, and the French Resistance reacts to the news that the invasion has started. British troops arrive in gliders to secure Pegasus Bridge, American paratroopers land scattered around Sainte-Mère-Église to defend a road that will be a vital artery for the invasion, and French Resistance and SOE agents conduct infiltration and sabotage work. There is uncertainty among German commanders about whether these events are a feint to distract from Allied crossings at the Strait of Dover (see Operation Fortitude), where the senior German staff had always assumed the invasion would begin.

As day breaks, Allied forces land on several beaches in Normandy and attempt to push inland, having particular trouble at Omaha Beach. Two lone &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; pilots strafe the beaches before flying away. The U.S. Provisional Ranger Group conducts an assault on the artillery at Pointe du Hoc, only to discover the guns are not functional. Free French Forces destroy a German stronghold in Ouistreham. After blowing through a concrete barrier, the American troops on Omaha Beach are able to begin their advance and join the rest of the Allied troops on the march to retake France and, eventually, conquer Germany.

===Development===
French producer Raoul Lévy signed a deal with Simon &amp; Schuster to purchase the filming rights to Cornelius Ryan&#x27;s book &quot;The Longest Day: June 6, 1944 D-Day&quot; on March 23, 1960. After finishing &quot;The Truth&quot;, Lévy set up a deal with the Associated British Picture Corporation and got director Michael Anderson attached. Ryan would receive $100,000, plus $35,000 to write the adaptation&#x27;s screenplay. Lévy intended to start production in March 1961, filming at Elstree Studios and the English and French coasts, but the project stalled when ABPC could not get the $6 million budget Lévy expected. Eventually, former 20th Century Fox mogul Darryl F. Zanuck learned about the book while producing &quot;The Big Gamble&quot;, and in December purchased Lévy&#x27;s option for $175,000. Zanuck&#x27;s editor friend Elmo Williams wrote a film treatment, which piqued the producer&#x27;s interest and made him attach Williams to &quot;The Longest Day&quot; as associate producer and coordinator of battle episodes. Ryan was brought in to write the script, but had conflicts with Zanuck as soon as the two met. Williams was forced to act as a mediator; he would deliver Ryan&#x27;s script pages to Zanuck, then return them with the latter&#x27;s annotations. While Ryan developed the script, Zanuck also brought in other writers for cleanups for the various nationalities, including James Jones for the Americans, Romain Gary for the French, Noël Coward for the British and Erich Maria Remarque for the Germans. As their contributions to the finished screenplay were relatively minor, Ryan managed to get the screenplay credit after an appeal to the Writers Guild arbitration, but four other writers are credited for writing &quot;additional episodes&quot; in the film&#x27;s closing credits.

During pre-production, producer Frank McCarthy, who had worked for the United States Department of War during World War II, arranged for military collaboration with the governments of France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Zanuck, who was friends with Supreme Allied Commander Lauris Norstad, secured 700 United States Army Europe and Africa soldiers for use as extras. However, hundreds of these soldiers had to be recalled after the Berlin Crisis of 1961, and many Members of Congress, such as Bob Wilson, criticized the military for transferring soldiers to a film production in France during a major Cold War standoff. The Senate Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights under Sam Ervin investigated the film for allegedly forcing soldiers to appear as extras against their will. In the end, the film included 250 U.S. Army soldiers and 500 British Army soldiers as extras.

Zanuck realized that, with eight battle scenes, shooting would be accomplished more expediently if multiple directors and units worked simultaneously, so he hired German directors Gerd Oswald and Bernhard Wicki, British director Ken Annakin, and Hungarian-American director Andrew Marton. Zanuck&#x27;s son Richard D. Zanuck was reluctant about the project, particularly the high budget; with a budget of $10 million ($ in dollars), this was the most expensive black-and-white film made until 1993, when &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; was released.

===Casting===

* Jack Lord was originally cast in a starring role in the film when Levy was producing it. 
* Charlton Heston actively sought the role of Lt. Col. Benjamin H. Vandervoort, but the last-minute decision of John Wayne to take the role prevented Heston&#x27;s participation. At 55, Wayne was 28 years older than Vandervoort was on D-Day (and 10 years older than he was in 1962). All of the other major actors accepted $25,000 as payment for their appearance in the film, but Wayne insisted on $250,000 to punish Zanuck for once referring to him as &quot;poor John Wayne&quot;, regarding Wayne&#x27;s problems with his lavish film &quot;The Alamo&quot; (1960).
* Pop stars Paul Anka, Tommy Sands, and Fabian appear together as Rangers in the film.
* Mel Ferrer was originally signed to play the role of Gen. James M. Gavin, but was recast due to a scheduling conflict.
* Richard Todd played Maj. John Howard, leader of the British airborne assault on the Pegasus Bridge, and Todd himself took part in the real bridge assault on D-Day. He was offered the chance to play himself, but took the part of Maj. Howard instead.
* Bill Millin was the piper who accompanied Lord Lovat to Normandy with his bagpipes, and it is a common misconception that he played himself in the film, while he was actually portrayed by Pipe Major Leslie de Laspee, the official piper to the Queen Mother at the time of filming.
* There were discussions about having former-President Dwight D. Eisenhower play himself in the film, and he indicated his willingness to participate. However, it was decided that makeup artists couldn&#x27;t make him appear young enough to play his World War II-era self, so the role went to Henry Grace, a set decorator who had been in the film industry since the mid-1930s. He had no acting experience, but Grace was a dead ringer for the younger Eisenhower (though his voice differed, so someone else dubbed his lines).
* In Sainte-Mère-Église, Pvt. John Steele from the 82nd Airborne (played by Red Buttons) has been memorialized by the local population with a dummy hanging from a parachute from the church tower on which he accidentally landed.
* According to the 2001 documentary &quot;Cleopatra: The Film That Changed Hollywood&quot;, Richard Burton and Roddy McDowall, having not been used for several weeks while filming in Rome, were so bored that they phoned Zanuck begging to do &quot;anything&quot; on &quot;The Longest Day&quot;. They flew themselves to the location and each filmed their cameos in a day for free.
* The film marked the last film appearance of Sean Connery before he was cast in the role of James Bond. Gert Fröbe (Sgt. Kaffeekanne) and Curd Jürgens (Gen. Günther Blumentritt) later played Bond villains Auric Goldfinger (&quot;Goldfinger&quot;) and Karl Stromberg (&quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;), respectively. Connery played Maj. Gen. Roy Urquhart in the 1977 film &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot;, which was also based on a book by Cornelius Ryan. Likewise, Wolfgang Preiss played Maj. Gen. Max Pemsel in &quot;The Longest Day&quot; and Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt in &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot;.
* Sgt. Kaffeekanne&#x27;s (Gert Fröbe) name is German for &quot;coffee pot&quot;, which he always carries.
* Zanuck hired more than 2,000 active soldiers for the film as extras.
* Henry Fonda and John Wayne would team up again three years later to make &quot;In Harm&#x27;s Way&quot;, a movie about the US Navy set after the attack on Pearl Harbor.
* Robert Ryan and Edmund O&#x27;Brien would team up again seven years later to make &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;, a movie set during the 1910 Mexican Revolution.
* One of the stuntmen on the film was Robert Weinstein (1936–2019), a French Jew who narrowly avoided the death camps. In his seventies, he wrote his memoirs with the help of Stéphanie Krug. &quot;Vent printanier&quot; was published by L&#x27;Harmattan, and was subsequently renamed &quot;L&#x27;orphelin du Vel&#x27; D&#x27;Hiv&quot; for its second edition. In it, Weinstein recounts the details of his life, including his work on this film.

===Filming===
* The film was shot at several French locations, including the Île de Ré, Saleccia beach in Saint-Florent, Port-en-Bessin-Huppain (filling in for Ouistreham), Les Studios de Boulogne in Boulogne-Billancourt, and the actual locations of Pegasus Bridge near Bénouville, Sainte-Mère-Église, and Pointe du Hoc.
* During the filming of the landings at Omaha Beach, the extras appearing as American soldiers did not want to jump off the landing craft into the water because they thought it would be too cold. Robert Mitchum, as Gen. Norman Cota, became disgusted with their trepidation and jumped in first, at which point they followed his example.
* The Rupert paradummies used in the film were far more elaborate and lifelike than those actually used in the decoy parachute drop (Operation Titanic), which were simply canvas or burlap sacks filled with sand. The dummies dressed in American jumpsuits were used in filming the Sainte-Mère-Église sequence. In the real operation, six Special Air Service soldiers jumped with the dummies and played recordings of loud battle noises to distract the Germans.
* In the scenes where the paratroopers land, the background noise of frogs croaking was incorrect for northern French frog species and showed that the film probably used an American recording of background night noises.
* Colin Maud lent Kenneth More, who had served as an officer in the Royal Navy during World War II, the actual shillelagh that he carried ashore during the invasion. Similarly, Richard Todd wears the beret that he actually wore on D-Day, although he changed the cap-badge to that of Maj. John Howard&#x27;s regiment, the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry.
* In the film, three Free French Special Air Service paratroopers jump into France before British and American airborne landings. This is accurate. Thirty-six Free French SAS (4 sticks) jumped into Brittany (Plumelec and Duault) on June 5 at 23:30 (Operation Dingson). The first Allied soldiers killed in action were Lt. Den Brotheridge of the 2nd Ox &amp; Bucks Light Infantry as he crossed Pegasus Bridge at 00:22 on June 6, and Corporal Emile Bouétard of the 4th Free French SAS battalion at the same time in Plumelec, Brittany.
* The United States Sixth Fleet extensively supported the filming and made available many amphibious landing ships and craft for scenes filmed in Corsica, though many of the ships were of newer vintage. The and were World War II light cruisers extensively reconfigured into guided missile cruisers, and both were used in the shore bombardment scenes. While the USS Springfield was scrapped in 1980, the USS Little Rock is now a museum ship in Buffalo, New York. 
*The film shows the attack by the 2nd Ranger Battalion on the Point de Hoc. The actual landings were slightly further east than shown in the film, owing to strong tides and high seas. When entering the bunker, one soldier says the guns were never installed. This is inaccurate, as the 155mm guns had been in position until a few days before D-Day, but were moved due to heavy bombing. In reality, the guns were discovered hidden a few hours later and were destroyed.
* French arms dealer and former flying ace Pierre Laureys restored and provided three Supermarine Spitfire aircraft for the scene of an attack on a German column. Laureys himself flew one of the Spitfire aircraft in the film.
* Gerd Oswald was the uncredited director of the parachute drop scenes into Sainte-Mère-Église, and Darryl F. Zanuck said he himself was the uncredited director of some pick-up interior scenes with American and British characters.
* Elmo Williams was credited as associate producer and coordinator of battle episodes. He later produced the historical World War II film &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; (1970) for Zanuck. It depicted the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, also using the docudrama style.

==Release==
The film premiered in France on September 25, 1962, in the United States on October 4, and in the United Kingdom on October 23. Funds from the premiers were donated to the Salk Institute for Biological Studies and the International Rescue Committee. Because Fox was suffering due to financial losses incurred during the concurrent production of &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, the studio wanted &quot;The Longest Day&quot; to go straight into wide release to reap quick profits, but Zanuck got them to do a proper roadshow theatrical release, threatening to sell distribution rights to Warner Bros. if Fox refused to do so. &quot;The Longest Day&quot; eventually became the box office hit Fox needed, with $30.5 million in worldwide theatrical rentals on a $7.5 million budget. It was the highest-grossing black-and-white movie at the time. Zanuck&#x27;s production company (DFZ Productions) received 50% of the profits, and by 1964 had received over $5.8 million.

There were special-release showings of the film in several cities in the United States at which men who had participated in D-Day were invited to see the film with their fellow soldiers. One such screening took place in Cleveland, Ohio, at the Hippodrome Theater.

The scenes in the film featuring German and French characters were shot both with them speaking their native language and with them speaking English. Almost uniquely among British- and American-produced World War II films of the time, the version of the film with foreign languages accompanied by English subtitles was more widely seen during the film&#x27;s initial release. The all-English version of the film was used more extensively during the film&#x27;s late 1960s re-release.

When the film was re-released in 1969, it opened at number one at the US box office with a first-week gross of $501,529. In the first four days of its worldwide re-release in 544 theatres, it grossed $2,846,627.

===Home media===
The film was released in widescreen with stereo surround sound on LaserDisc in 1989. A colorized version of the film was released on VHS in 1994, the 50th anniversary of the D-Day invasion. The original black-and-white version of the film was released on DVD on November 6, 2001. In 2008, 20th Century Fox released the film on Blu-ray.

==Reception==
The day after the film opened at the Warner Theatre in New York City, Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; declared: &quot;The total effect of the picture is that of a huge documentary report, adorned and colored by personal details that are thrilling, amusing, ironic, sad [...] It is hard to think of a picture, aimed and constructed as this one was, doing any more or any better or leaving one feeling any more exposed to the horror of war as this one does&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; described it as &quot;a solid and stunning war epic&quot; that &quot;emerges as a sort of grand scale semi-fictionalized documentary concerning the overall logistics needed for this incredible invasion&quot;.

Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the film &quot;a tingling, eye-gripping, fantastic picture&quot; that &quot;must rank as the screen&#x27;s most massive battle epic&quot;, his only criticism being &quot;the lack of perspective in depicting the German belief that the Normandy landings might not have succeeded had Hitler not taken a sleeping pill [...] &#x27;The Longest Day&#x27; should have taken infinitely more care to put this German belief, however strongly held, into proper proportion&quot;. Brendan Gill of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called the film &quot;a tour de force of audio-visual verisimilitude,&quot; but confessed that &quot;my emotions were hardly ever engaged, and I ended, rather to my embarrassment, by being bored&quot;. He continued: &quot;Mr. Zanuck made it all the harder for me to take this mock-documentary seriously by stuffing it with innumerable celebrated actors, most of whom make such fugitive appearances that the audience finds itself engaged in a distracting game of instant identification&quot;.

&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; stated: &quot;&quot;The Longest Day&quot; is a monument split down the middle by compromise. At its best, what comes across very strongly is the feeling of immense and careful organisation that went into the whole D-Day operation, the sheer crippling weight of noise, the simple fact that a lot of people died, and the sense of personal confusion and dismay of soldiers wandering alone through the countryside [...] But the film is, first and foremost, a spectacle, and therefore it has stars—a multitude of them, often with barely a line to speak, and usually with no real part to play&quot;.

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 84% based on 25 reviews, with an average score of 7.6/10.

<text>The Longest Day is a board wargame published by Avalon Hill in 1979 that simulates the Allied D-Day invasion of June 1944 and the subsequent Normandy campaign during World War II until August 31st, 1944.

==Background==
In early June 1944, Allied forces landed on the beaches of Normandy. Although German forces were not able to eliminate the beachhead, they were able to contain Allied forces within the Cotentin Peninsula for almost 8 weeks. The Allies finally broke out with simultaneous attacks by British and Canadian forces (Operation Goodwood) and American forces (Operation Cobra).

==Description==
&quot;The Longest Day&quot; is a &quot;monster game&quot; (one having more than 1000 counters) for 2–8 players (or two teams) that covers the Allied Operation Overlord from the Normandy invasion on 6 June 1944, to the Battle of the Falaise Gap in August 1944. &quot;Wargame Academy&quot; rates the game&#x27;s complexity as 6 on a scale of 10 and estimates that a campaign game would take 30–50 hours to complete, while Avalon Hill rates the game&#x27;s complexity as 8 on a scale of 10 and estimates that the game would take 50-90 hours to complete.

===Components===
The large game box is 14.25 inches x 11.25 inches x 2.5 inches, weighs nine pounds (4 kg) and contains:
*Seven mounted mapboards scaled at 2 km (1.2 mi) per hex with up to 16 types of terrain. When used together for the campaign game, the maps cover a total area of almost 14 square feet (1.3 square meters)
*2603 die-cut counters using German rather than NATO symbols to differentiate types of units
* Several tables, including Reinforcement and unit entry tracks, a Combat Results Table (CRT) and a Remnant Exchange Table
* Several booklets, including &quot;Rules of Play&quot;, &quot;Question Box&quot;, and unit placements 
* Four scenario sheets

== Gameplay ==

Each turn uses the following sequence:
* Allied movement
* German mechanized movement
* Allied combat
* German movement
* Allied mechanized movement
* German Combat
This completes one turn, which represents one day.

===Scenarios=== 
The game includes five scenarios that range in playing time from 3 to 12 hours and increase in complexity with the addition of new rules for each scenario: 
# Normandy Beachhead (6 June-8 June) (Played with every mapboard)
# Fall of Cherbourg (19 June-25 June) (Played with mapboard &quot;A&quot;)
# Operation Cobra (25 July-31 July) (Played with mapboard &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;F&quot;)
# Mortain Counterattack (6 August-9 August) (Played with mapboard &quot;F&quot;)
# Falaise Pocket (17 August-21 August) (Played with mapboard &quot;G&quot;)

There is also a complete Campaign Game.

There are six hypothetical &quot;what-if?&quot; add-ons included that simulate events that historically did not happen but were considered at the time as possible strategies by the relevant commands. These include a second Allied airdrop (which would later become a part of the regular Campaign scenario rules), Hitler abandoning the Channel Islands in order to reinforce Normandy, and moving German units quite close to beachheads before the invasion (General Erwin Rommel&#x27;s original counter-invasion plan).

There are three optional rules that can be added onto the Campaign Game: Counter-Battery Artillery Fire, Bridge Demolition and Repair, and Hedgerow Cutters.

==Publication history==
Randall C. Reed, the head of Avalon Hill&#x27;s research and development staff in the late 1970s, was one of the first new Avalon Hill employees after the Charles S. Roberts era. Reed designed &quot;The Longest Day&quot;, including the counters and maps. The game was published by Avalon Hill in 1979 with cover art by Rodger B. MacGowan.

The game was published with some counters missing. These were included in &quot;The General&quot;, Vol. 28, No. 6.

==Reception==
In Issue 33 of the British wargaming magazine &quot;Phoenix&quot;, Geoffrey Barnard examined the historicity of the game and found that it was inaccurate in several areas. This included geographical errors (9 of 11 British/Canadian landing beaches were incorrectly named), rules that do not accurately represent possible actions, and strategic errors. Barnard nevertheless concluded, &quot;It is worth playing and, even more so, it is worth studying [...] The game is, I feel, a valuable contribution to the advance of game design, even if just because it sets out to be, or at least seem, historically serious.&quot;

In Issue 6 of Richard Berg&#x27;s Review of Games, game designer Richard Berg noted that this was &quot;not a complex game — there are no convoluted mechanics to learn, no tortuous CRT&#x27;s to dissect, and no roster sheets full of minutiae to keep track of.&quot; Berg thought the first scenario (the Normandy landings) was the most interesting for players, given that the length of time to complete the entire campaign game &quot;is an extensive proceeding that will appeal to few because of the time and energy required.&quot; However, Berg found &quot;The set-up system is abysmal — there appears to be a fair number of holes and glitches in the initial set-up.&quot; Berg also found the set-up time to be overly long, writing, &quot;It actually takes less time to learn how to play the game than to set it up ... [But] once over that formidable wall and into the game, most players will find the assimilation of the system easy going.&quot; Berg added onto this by saying that &quot;...for those gamers for whom extended and difficult set-ups are a major bugaboo, TLD should be avoided like a Care package from Tehran.&quot;

<doc id="1343145" wikidata="Q6793497" url="?curid=1343145" title="Maurice Tempelsman">
<text>Maurice Tempelsman (born August 26, 1929) is a Belgian-American businessman, a diamond magnate and merchant. He was the longtime companion of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, former First Lady of the United States.

== Early life ==
Tempelsman was born on August 26, 1929, in Antwerp, Belgium, the son of Leon and Helene Tempelsman, both Orthodox Jews, in a Yiddish-speaking family in Antwerp&#x27;s Jewish community. In 1940, Tempelsman and his family emigrated to the United States to escape persecution by Nazi Germany during World War II. When he was 16, Tempelsman began working for his father, a diamond broker. He attended New York City&#x27;s public schools and New York University.

== Business interests ==
In 1950, Tempelsman created a new marketing niche by persuading the US government to stockpile African diamonds for industrial and military purposes, with him as the middleman. In 1957, at the age of 27, he and his lawyer, Adlai Stevenson, traveled to Africa, where Tempelsman had begun forging ties with leaders. His contacts eventually ranged from South African anti-apartheid politician Oliver Tambo to Zaire&#x27;s kleptocratic dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko and the influential Oppenheimer diamond family. Declassified memos and cables between former U.S. presidents and State Department officials from the 50&#x27;s to the 90&#x27;s have named Tempelsman with direct input in the destabilization of Congo, Sierra Leone, Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Rwanda and Ghana. He was involved in the overthrow of Ghana&#x27;s first elected president, Kwame Nkrumah, the CIA-backed assassination of Congo&#x27;s first-elected prime minister, Patrice Lumumba and cover-up of CIA covert support of the former president of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mobuto Sese Seko.

Tempelsman is chairman of the board of directors of Lazare Kaplan International Inc. (LKI), the largest diamond company in the United States, noted for its &quot;ideal cut&quot; diamonds sold worldwide under the brand name, Lazare Diamonds. Tempelsman is one of fewer than 90 &quot;sightholders&quot; in the world, which means that 10 times a year he is permitted to buy diamonds directly from the powerful De Beers cartel in the City of London. Because DeBeers was a virtual monopoly, for many years it could not operate legally in the United States.

 He is also a general partner of Leon Tempelsman &amp; Son, an investment company specializing in real estate and venture capital.

== Philanthropic and political activities ==
Tempelsman maintains relations with political and business leaders, in particular government leaders in Africa and Russia, and leading figures in the U.S. Democratic Party. His extensive political contacts and monetary contributions often provide him with access and prestige in those markets, as was the case during the presidency of Bill Clinton. From 1993 to 1997, Tempelsman visited the White House at least ten times, met privately with Hillary Clinton on two occasions, vacationed with the Clintons and the Kennedy family in Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, and flew to Moscow and back with President Clinton on Air Force One.

In Southern Africa, Tempelsman has played a key role in negotiations between hostile governments and companies engaging in diamond exploration. He met with Mobutu Sese Seko, to assist the regime&#x27;s business dealings with De Beers. In the 1960s Tempelsman hired as his business agent the CIA station chief in Kinshasa, Larry Devlin, who helped put Mobutu in power and afterward served as his personal adviser. From March 3, 1977, Tempelsman briefly held the title of honorary consul general for Zaire, now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), at the DRC&#x27;s consular offices in New York City. In addition to the DRC, Tempelsman has played a key role in the diamond industries of Angola, Botswana, Namibia, and Sierra Leone.

Tempelsman served as chairman of the Corporate Council on Africa (CCA) from 1999 to 2002 and again from 2007 to 2008, after which he was named chairman emeritus. An example of his work with the CCA involved assisting government leaders with establishing the New Partnership for Africa&#x27;s Development. Tempelsman was a board member of the Southern African Enterprise Development Fund, and past chairman and long-serving board member of the Africa-America Institute.

Tempelsman is a trustee of the Eurasia Foundation, and a director of the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, the Center for National Policy, the Business Council for International Understanding, and the U.S.-Russia Business Council.

He is chairman of the International Advisory Council of the Harvard School of Public Health&#x27;s AIDS Initiative, and is an honorary trustee and an honorary member of the corporation of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Tempelsman is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and was named a visitor to the Department of Classical Art at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. A director of the Academy of American Poets, Tempelsman also serves as a trustee of the New York University Institute of Fine Arts, and on Lenox Hill Hospital&#x27;s advisory board. He has served on several Presidential Commissions including the President&#x27;s Commission for the Observance of Human Rights, the Citizen&#x27;s advisory board of Youth Opportunities and the National Highway Safety Advisory Committee, and was appointed to the New York Council on International Business.

==Looted Morgantina acroliths==
In 1980, Tempelsman bought, for $1 million, two 500 BC acroliths representing Demeter and Persephone; the pieces consisted of two marble heads, three feet, and three hands. Tempelsman purchased them from the later-infamous art dealer Robin Symes. The Italian government first claimed the items when they were displayed in a 1988 exhibition at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu; the museum had listed them as belonging to a private collector. The Italian authorities determined that they were looted from Morgantina, and smuggled into Switzerland, where they were acquired by Symes. They were finally repatriated to the archeological museum of Aidone in 2007, after being on exhibit for five years at the Fralin Museum of Art, part of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. Putatively, in 2005, Tempelsman donated the pieces to the university museum, and the restitution to Italy was mediated by the university&#x27;s archeology professor Malcolm Bell III.

==Personal life==

===Marriage and children===
Tempelsman has adult children by his wife Lilly Bucholz, who had also fled Antwerp with her family. They were married in 1949. Their daughter, Rena, is the widow of Robert Speisman, an executive vice president of Lazare Kaplan International Inc. who died on board American Airlines Flight 77, when the aircraft crashed into The Pentagon during the September 11 attacks.

Tempelsman and Bucholz formally separated in 1984. According to &quot;People&quot;, Bucholz and Tempelsman never legally divorced.

=== Relationship with Jacqueline Onassis ===
Tempelsman was the longtime companion of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Maurice and Lilly Tempelsman were guests at the State Dinner given at Mount Vernon, Virginia in honor of the President Ayub Khan of Pakistan in 1961. The two began their lengthy relationship in 1980, five years after the death of Jacqueline Onassis&#x27; second husband Aristotle Onassis. In 1988, Tempelsman moved into Onassis&#x27;s Fifth Avenue penthouse apartment in New York City.

During their relationship, he handled Onassis&#x27;s finances, quadrupling the $26 million that was secured from her late husband&#x27;s estate. The couple frequently took walks through Central Park and were photographed doing so in the days preceding her death from Non-Hodgkin lymphoma at age 64 on May 19, 1994. At Onassis&#x27;s funeral Mass, Tempelsman read Constantine P. Cavafy&#x27;s poem &quot;Ithaca&quot;, one of her favorites, and concluded by saying: &quot;And now the journey is over, too short, alas, too short. It was filled with adventure and wisdom, laughter and love, gallantry and grace. So farewell, farewell.&quot; 

Tempelsman was one of two executors of the will that she had drawn up with her long-time attorney, Alexander D. Forger. She left him a &quot;Greek alabaster head of a woman&quot; and named Tempelsman to be a co‑chair of a charitable organization, the C &amp; J Foundation. However, there was no residuary left to fund the foundation after estate taxes were paid.

<text>Cliftonville Football &amp; Athletic Club is a semi-professional association football club playing in the NIFL Premiership – the top division of the Northern Ireland Football League. The club was founded in September 1879 by John McAlery in the suburb of Cliftonville in north Belfast and are the founders of football in Ireland.

It is the oldest football club in Ireland and celebrated its 140th anniversary in 2019. Since 1890, the club has played home matches at Solitude. Cliftonville contests the North Belfast derby with nearby rivals Crusaders, and also has local rivalries with Linfield and Glentoran.

The club has won the league title five times outright including one shared title, the Irish Cup nine times and the Northern Ireland Football League Cup six times.

==History==

===Founders of football in Ireland===
The foundation of Cliftonville F.C. was announced on 20 September 1879 in notices in the &quot;Belfast News-Letter&quot; and &quot;Northern Whig&quot;, which asked &quot;gentlemen desirous of becoming members&quot; of the &quot;Cliftonville Association Football Club (Scottish Association Rules)&quot; to communicate with John McAlery, a young Belfast businessman and manager of the &quot;Irish Tweed House&quot;, Royal Avenue, and later with premises in Rosemary Street, or R.M. Kennedy, and advertising an &quot;opening practice today at 3.30&quot;.

Only one week after the advertisement was published, Cliftonville played its first recorded game at Cliftonville Cricket Ground against a selection of rugby players known as &quot;Quidnunces&quot;, the game took place on 29 September 1879. The newly formed club, however, was beaten 2–1. In its first match against the Scottish club Caledonian, it fared worse: a 1–9 defeat.

In 1880, it was again John McAlery who was the moving spirit in the formation of the Irish Football Association. He issued an invitation to interested parties in Belfast and district for a meeting to be called. The first meeting took place on 18 November 1880 at Queen&#x27;s Hotel, Belfast, presided over by John Sinclair, from which the Irish Football Association was formed. While Major Chichester was appointed president, McAlery became the honorary secretary of the association. This meeting also paved the way for the Irish Cup.

===Early years===

The first Irish Cup final, played at Cliftonville on 9 April 1881, saw a 1–0 defeat against Moyola Park, an opponent that was well known for &quot;rough and brutal play&quot;. In the following year Cliftonville lost again in the Irish Cup final, 1–0 against Queen&#x27;s Island. In 1883 Cliftonville won the cup for the first time with a 5–0 win over Ulster.

During the 1880s Cliftonville also played in the English FA Cup, competing in the competition proper in 1886–87 and 1887–88. In 1886–87 they finally lost in the third round 11–0 at home to Partick Thistle after beating Blackburn Park Road 7–2 in an earlier round. In 1887–88 they scratched their match with Church (Accrington). The match lost to Linfield 7–0 in 1888 is the only FA Cup match to be played on Christmas Day.

The inaugural meeting of the Irish Football League was held on 14 March 1890 in the Belfast Estate Office of the Marquess of Dufferin and Ava with M. McNeice (Cliftonville) as its first president. Eight clubs agreed to participate: Cliftonville, Clarence, Milford, Oldpark, Distillery, Glentoran, Ulster and Linfield. In the 1905–06 season Cliftonville won the League for the first time, a success that was repeated in the 1909–10 campaign.

In 1891, Cliftonville became the first Irish football club to utilize floodlights during games. As reported, &quot;It seems incredible, but it is a fact that in 1891 two matches were played under electric lights at Cliftonville: Distillery defeated the Reds 4–2, and the Black Watch held Cliftonville to a 2–2 draw. Kick-off in each case was at 8 pm with lights suspended across the pitch. These were later dismantled with the announcement that spectators found it difficult to follow the action and that &quot;the players seemed to have all the fun in the middle&quot;. It had been a bold experience, but not a highly successful one with the public skeptical, almost contemptuous of this enterprising project.&quot;

In 1897 Cliftonville won the Irish Cup after a 3–1 win over Sherwood Foresters. A quite unusual protest was launched by Cliftonville after being beaten by Belfast Celtic in the 1900 Irish Cup competition. The Celtic goalposts were eventually measured and it was found out that they were much too short. A replay took place, in which Cliftonville reversed the 4–0 defeat in the earlier match. Subsequently they won the Cup that year, after beating Bohemians 2–1 in the Final.

===Long gap between victories===

Being an all-amateur team until the early 1970s, Cliftonville subsequently played a minor role in Northern Irish football as professionalism took hold. It was only in 1976, under manager Jackie Hutton and his assistant Jackie Patterson, that Cliftonville experienced a &quot;revolution in fortune&quot; which peaked on 28 April 1979 in the Irish Cup Final at Windsor Park. In front of 18,000 spectators, the largest attendance for many years, Cliftonville beat Portadown 3–2 with goals from John Platt, Mike Adair and a late winner from Tony Bell. Unusually, the Reds were playing in yellow and blue that day. A similar strip was launched for the club&#x27;s appearance in the 2009 showpiece.

In the years after this achievement, Cliftonville returned to the lower reaches of the Irish League, and in the Nineties frequently ended bottom of the league but relegation was not applied at that time. However, things started to improve after winning the Floodlit Cup in 1996 and the County Antrim Shield in 1997 for the first time in 88 years.

Under manager Marty Quinn, a player from the cup-winning side of 1979, Cliftonville won the Irish League in 1997–98 for the first time in 88 years at Solitude after a 1–1 draw against Glentoran. UTV&#x27;s coverage of the post-match wait in the home changing-room, which erupted in celebration once the title win had been confirmed, brought the Reds&#x27; victory to a wide audience. After the Cliftonville players returned to the Solitude pitch, Reds Captain Mickey Donnelly lifted the Irish League trophy. Donnelly was made new Captain at the start of the season after replacing Marty Tabb.

Yet the championship was followed by another potential highlight that turned out badly for Cliftonville, when the 1999 final of the Irish Cup between Cliftonville and Portadown was cancelled due to a Cliftonville player who had featured in the semi-final being deemed ineligible. Portadown were given a walkover in the final.

Cliftonville subsequently entered the European arena for the first time, playing Nantes of France in the first round of the European Cup Winners Cup. The Reds lost 7–0 in France and 1–0 at Solitude.

===21st century===

Former player and Captain Marty Tabb was appointed new manager and former defender Stephen Small was appointed Assistant Manager at the turn of the century. The Reds subsequently reverted to type, escaping relegation by beating Ards in relegation matches in two consecutive years. Nevertheless, in 2003 the Reds caused an upset by winning the Irish League Cup, beating Larne. The Reds were back in the relegation play-off in the 2003–04 season, but comfortably disposed of Armagh City over the two legs. After a string of poor results, Tabb resigned in 2004. Former Institute boss Liam Beckett took over but only managed the club for the 2004–05 season.

Since then the Reds have progressed, with a fifth-place finish in 2005–06 under new manager Eddie Patterson, (who replaced Liam Beckett), and his Assistant Tommy Breslin. Fifth was the club&#x27;s highest finish since the league win of 1997–98.

The 2006–07 season was a successful one for the club getting to the League Cup final and winning the County Antrim Shield. Finishing third ensured European football for the first time in five years.

Cliftonville beat Dinaburg of Latvia in the First Round of the 2007 UEFA Intertoto Cup, the home leg was played at Windsor Park, Belfast and finished 1–1 with Kieron O&#x27;Connor scoring the Cliftonville goal, on his competitive debut and the away leg was played at the Celtnieks Stadium in the Latvian city of Daugavpils. Mark Holland scored the only goal of the game and secured Cliftonville&#x27;s first victory in European competition.

During the 2007–08 campaign Cliftonville&#x27;s performances in the first half of the season had seemed to make them genuine title contenders, spending much of the early and middle part of the season top of the table, going top with five games to go, however a poor run of form in the final fixtures of the campaign ended their hopes of winning the biggest prize in local football. The Reds finished the league campaign in third position fourteen points adrift of Champions Linfield.

However Cliftonville again secured European football, in the shape of the UEFA Cup. This success meant that the club became the first Northern Irish side to play in all of UEFA&#x27;s competitions. This time being drawn against Danish giants Copenhagen, the home leg took place at Mourneview Park, Lurgan and resulted in a 4–0 defeat with the return leg two weeks later held in the Danish National Stadium, Parken Stadium and the result again was unfavourable – this time a 7–0 defeat.

During the 2008–09 campaign Cliftonville struggled in terms of their league performance but finished strongly to secure a top 6 finish. They won the County Antrim Shield and reached the Irish Cup final, 30 years since their previous victory in the competition. Cliftonville lost in the final to their near neighbours, Crusaders. The season was a success on a personal note for captain Chris Scannell, who finished top goalscorer in all competitions, and won the coveted Ulster Footballer of the Year trophy.

The Reds began the following season, 2009–10, eager to carry on the largely good form of the last few months of the previous one. That run largely continued, with the highlight a 4–0 destruction in the derby game against Linfield at Solitude. The Reds finished second on 69 points, a 1–0 defeat away to Linfield in the penultimate game cost the Reds the championship.

The 2010–11 season began with a 1–0 aggregate win over Croatian side HNK Cibalia in the second qualifying round of the Europa league. Cliftonville lost to CSKA Sofia in Bulgaria in the first match of the third qualifying round, 3–0. In the 2nd Leg Cliftonville lost 1–2 on the night which secured a 5–1 aggregate success for Sofia, who were allowed to remain in the competition when UEFA ruled that Cliftonville&#x27;s appeal over the ineligibility of CSKA midfielder Spas Delev had not been lodged within the required 24-hour time frame. At the end of the 2010–11 season, Eddie Patterson became the first manager to be sacked in the club&#x27;s history. He was replaced by Tommy Breslin.

The 2012–13 season was the most successful in the club&#x27;s history. A win in the 2012–13 Irish League Cup final in January 2013 over rivals Crusaders was followed up with a League Championship, courtesy of a ninety-second-minute penalty from George McMullan against Linfield on 14 April 2013. The club missed out on a treble when they were defeated 3–1 after extra time in the 2012–13 Irish Cup final by Glentoran on 4 May 2013.

The club started the following season in the UEFA Champions league second qualifying round, losing to Scottish champions Celtic in both legs. 
In January 2014, the club lifted their second consecutive League Cup against the same final opponents as the previous season, Crusaders. A 3–2 penalty shoot-out victory after a 0–0 draw was enough to earn the club&#x27;s third League Cup title overall.

In January 2015, Cliftonville defeated Ballymena United 3–2 in the League Cup final at Windsor Park to secure a third League Cup in a row.

In September 2015 Gerard Lyttle succeeded the highly successful Tommy Breslin.

On 13 February 2016, Cliftonville won its fourth consecutive League Cup by defeating Ards 3–0 in the final at Solitude.

In May 2017, Lyttle was replaced by Barry Gray. Gray guided his side to an Irish Cup final appearance in 2018, losing 3–1 to Coleraine.

On 4 February 2019, former Institute manager Paddy McLaughlin was appointed as Cliftonville manager following the dismissal of Barry Gray. In McLaughlin&#x27;s first full season in charge, the 2019–20 season, Cliftonville finished fourth in the NIFL Premiership.

In the 2021–22 season, Paddy McLaughlin guided the club to a strong second-placed finish, taking the title race with Linfield down to the wire.

On 13 March 2022 Cliftonville won its sixth League Cup against Coleraine at Windsor Park in a thrilling final that ended 4–3 to the Reds in extra time.

On 17 April 2023 Paddy McLaughlin left the manager&#x27;s post at Solitude to become the assistant manager at his hometown club Derry City. Jim Magilton was appointed in June 2023 as McLaughlin&#x27;s successor.

On 4 May 2024 Magilton ended the 45-year wait to lift the Irish Cup beating Linfield 3-1 AET at the National Stadium. Ronan Hale scoring a brace in extra time and his brother and captain Rory picking up the man of the match award.

<text>Boulevard Puerto Aéreo metro station is a station of the Mexico City Metro in Venustiano Carranza, Mexico City. It is an underground station with two side platforms, serving Line 1 (the Pink Line) between Balbuena and Gómez Farías metro stations. 

It services the (neighborhoods) of Moctezuma, Santa Cruz Aviación, and Valentín Gómez Farías. Situated beneath Puerto Aéreo Boulevard, after which it is named, the station is close to Calzada Ignacio Zaragoza. The station&#x27;s pictogram features a silhouette of an air vent under a road bridge, referencing a landmark found at the junction of these two avenues. The station facilities offer accessibility for people with disabilities, featuring elevators, escalators, tactile pavings and wheelchair ramps. Outside, the station includes a transport hub servicing local bus routes.

Boulevard Puerto Aéreo metro station was inaugurated on 4 September 1969, and opened the following day, as Aeropuerto metro station with westbound service towards Chapultepec and eastward service toward Zaragoza. It was initially named for its proximity to the Mexico City International Airport at the time of its opening, and its original pictogram depicted the silhouette of an airliner. However, in 1981, Terminal Aérea metro station on Line 5 (the Yellow Line) replaced this function because it was built next to the airport. Due to ongoing confusion among travelers, the station&#x27;s name and logo were changed in 1997.

In 2019, the station had an average daily ridership of 23,095 passengers, ranking it the 63rd busiest station in the network and the 13th most used on the line. Boulevard Puerto Aéreo metro station was closed from July 2022 to October 2023 due to modernization works on the tunnel and the line&#x27;s technical equipment.

In 2016, the station received renovation works that included repairs to ticket offices, floors, walls, ceilings, electrical installations, lighting, paging system and video surveillance system.

The station was closed on 11 July 2022 for modernization work on the tunnel and technical equipment of the line. After fifteen months of renovations, authorities reopened Boulevard Puerto Aéreo station on 29 October 2023. &quot;Excélsior&quot; reported in July 2024 that all the modernized stations had leaks of varying dimensions, with water filtrations detected in the walls of Boulevard Puerto Aéreo station, resulting in constant runoff into the drains. This issue left damp marks and affected the facilities. Authorities had stated they would seal these leaks during the 2022 modernization repairs.

===Name and pictogram===

Originally, Boulevard Puerto Aéreo was named Aeropuerto due to its proximity (approximately 15 blocks) to the Mexico City International Airport, and its original pictogram featured an airliner. In 1981, Terminal Aérea metro station on Line 5 (the Yellow Line) was built next to the airport. Despite this, confusion persisted, with passengers continuing to alight at Aeropuerto due to its name and pictogram. It was until 1997 that the station was renamed &quot;Boulevard Puerto Aéreo&quot; and the logo was replaced with a pictogram of a bridge with a dome below symbolizing a nearby air vent designed to prevent street garbage from entering the platforms.

===Incidents===
On 2 June 2021, the station received a bomb threat. Following six hours of examinations, the city&#x27;s Secretariat of Security determined that no explosives were present.

==Ridership==
According to data provided by authorities, before the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on public transport, commuters averaged per year between 22,800 and 29,600 daily entrances between 2014 and 2019; the station had a ridership of 8,429,972 passengers in 2019, marking an increase of 78,230 passengers compared to 2018. In 2019 specifically, Boulevard Puerto Aéreo metro station ranked as the 63rd busiest station out of the system&#x27;s 195 stations and was the 13th busiest on Line 1.

<doc id="1343154" wikidata="Q505077" url="?curid=1343154" title="Newfoundland French">
<text>Newfoundland French or Newfoundland Peninsular French () refers to the French spoken on the Port au Port Peninsula (part of the so-called “French Shore”) of Newfoundland. The francophones of the region can trace their origins to Continental French fishermen who settled in the late 1800s and early 1900s, rather than the Québécois. Some Acadians of the Maritimes also settled in the area. For this reason, Newfoundland French is most closely related to the Norman and Breton French of nearby St-Pierre-et-Miquelon. Today, heavy contact with Acadian French—and especially widespread bilingualism with Newfoundland English—have taken their toll, and the community is in decline.

The degree to which lexical features of Newfoundland French constitute a distinct dialect is not presently known. It is uncertain how many speakers survive; the dialect could be moribund. There is a provincial advocacy organisation &quot;Fédération des Francophones de Terre-Neuve et du Labrador&quot;, representing both the Peninsular French and Acadian French communities.

==Distribution==
Newfoundland French communities include Cap-St-Georges, Petit Jardin, Grand Jardin, De Grau, Ruisseau Rouge, La Pointe à Luc, Trois Cailloux, La Grand’Terre, L’Anse-à-Canards, Maisons-d’Hiver and Lourdes. In addition, there is a town named Port Aux Basques on the western side of Newfoundland.

There are also nearby Acadian French communities in the Codroy Valley and Stephenville. These francophones speak in the Acadian dialect of French, and not Newfoundland French.

==History==

===Origins===
France contested ownership of Newfoundland from 1662 until 1713, when it ceded the island to Great Britain as part of the Treaty of Utrecht. During the Seven Years&#x27; War, France (and Spain) vied for control of Newfoundland and the valuable fisheries off its shores. Fighting ceased in 1763, with French fishing rights to the western coast enshrined in the Treaty of Paris. This period saw an influx of Breton, Norman and Basque fishermen to the region, though most of the activity was seasonal, and French settlement before the late 1800s was forbidden. Despite British disapproval, the clandestine settlement continued, though without the benefit of schools and essential services. As a result, literacy among Francophones was uncommon in the twentieth century. In 1904 ownership of the region was transferred from France to the Colony of Newfoundland.

In addition to French immigration from Europe, Acadian immigrants arrived from Cape Breton Island and the Magdalen Islands to colonize Cape Saint-George, the Codroy Valley and Stephenville called &quot;l&#x27;Anse-aux-Sauvages&quot; (the Cove of Savages) beginning in the 19th century. Until the middle of the 20th century, fishermen from Brittany who spoke Breton as their mother tongue, but were educated in French through the Jules Ferry schools, came to establish themselves on the Port-au-Port peninsula; this is arguably the primary cause for the differences between Newfoundland and Acadian French.

===Contact with anglophone populations, bilingualism, and assimilation===
Contact between francophone and anglophone Newfoundlanders had been historically both limited and normally peaceful. In the first half of the twentieth century, the west coast of Newfoundland was roughly evenly distributed with English-speaking and French-speaking families, mostly working within their own linguistic communities. The major exception was the Catholic Church, wherein the priests were nearly always monolingually English-speaking. This strongly encouraged bilingualism in the francophone community and laid the seeds for assimilation.

In 1940, the establishment of the American air force base at Stephenville began French Newfoundland’s decline. Newfoundland French and Acadian French speakers who had lived and worked their entire lives in relative francophone isolation now found themselves at the heart of an American, Canadian, British and Newfoundlander anglophone economic centre. Families were grateful for the economic opportunities brought by the base, but transmission of French across generations dropped-off dramatically.

The absence of French-language education and the mandatory attendance of all children in English-speaking schools, as well as both radio and television programs in English, caused more recent generations to fail to master more complicated grammar and subject matter in French. English was becoming the only language of the educated.

Patrice Brasseur, a French linguist, has made numerous visits to the island. In speaking with remaining elderly Newfoundland francophones, he has found that French-speaking children were often punished for speaking French at school. Marriages between francophone and anglophone Catholics also became a contributing factor in assimilation, with intermarriages becoming more common from the 1930s onward.

===Confederation===
Since 1949, when Newfoundland became a Canadian province, the use of French on the island has continued to decline. The presence of French was ignored by both governments, similarly to the Mi&#x27;kmaq populations, with there being no official position on the matter, but with the &quot;de facto&quot; policy of assimilation. As a result of the absence of francophone education and religious teaching, Newfoundland French is now spoken by only a handful of elderly residents and is considered moribund. Typically, Franco-Newfoundlanders in Newfoundland now speak Acadian French rather than the Newfoundland dialect, though a small number of families still speak a strongly inflected hybrid dialect. Today, 15,000 descendants of French settlers live in the province, and there is a movement to reestablish the Newfoundland dialect as the French language of education in the province. However, schoolchildren in the province are currently being introduced to either standard Quebec French, or to a heavily Acadian-influenced variety thereof.

==Characteristics==
According to Patrice Brasseur&#x27;s articles &quot;Les Représentations linguistiques des francophones de la péninsule de Port-au-Port&quot; (2007) and &quot;Quelques aspects de la situation linguistique dans la communauté franco-terreneuvienne&quot; (1995) as well as according to the French Academy, some characteristics of French in Newfoundland can be kept in mind:
* the affrication of [k], noted &quot;tch&quot; or, most often, &quot;ch&quot; (with the frequent examples of &quot;cœur&quot; and &quot;quinze&quot; and &quot;cuiller&quot; and &quot;cuisine&quot;),
* the widespread use of English terms,
* the progressive extinction of the subjunctive form
* the use of septante, octante, and nonante

<doc id="1343165" wikidata="Q626745" url="?curid=1343165" title="The Alamo (2004 film)">
<text>The Alamo is a 2004 American war historical drama about the Battle of the Alamo during the Texas Revolution. The film was directed by John Lee Hancock, produced by Ron Howard, Brian Grazer, and Mark Johnson, distributed by Buena Vista Pictures (through its Touchstone Pictures banner), and starring Dennis Quaid as Sam Houston, Billy Bob Thornton as Davy Crockett, Jason Patric as Jim Bowie, and Patrick Wilson as William B. Travis. The screenplay is credited to Hancock, Stephen Gaghan, and Leslie Bohem.

The film received mixed to negative reviews from critics and was a box office flop, losing the studio over $146 million.

==Plot==
At a party in 1835, while trying to persuade people to migrate to Texas, Sam Houston encounters David Crockett, recently defeated in his bid for re-election to Congress. In San Felipe, the Texas provisional government is meeting to discuss what action to take after their capture of the Alamo and the town of San Antonio de Bexar in the recent fighting. Texas has rebelled against Mexico, and its dictatorial president Santa Anna is personally leading one wing of his army to retake San Antonio, then invade the settlements and put an end to the rebellion. Various members of the Texan War Party called for the Texas army to depart Bexar, cross into Mexico, and capture the town of Matamoros. The Opposition Party seeks to rebuild the Texan army and establish a permanent government. 

The provisional government votes out Sam Houston as commander of the Texas army; a disgusted Houston tells Jim Bowie to go to San Antonio, destroy the fortifications (including the Alamo), and retreat eastward. The Texas government then orders William Barret Travis to Bexar. Colonel Neil, the Alamo&#x27;s commander, gives Travis command of the post as Neil must leave to take care of a family emergency before returning with reinforcements. Knowing that the Alamo&#x27;s small force cannot withstand the Mexican Army, Travis sends pleas for reinforcements. Travis oversees defense preparations as small groups of Texans arrive, hoping enough reinforcements will arrive before the inevitable final assault.

Crockett, coming to Texas to revive his political career, arrives in San Antonio. He is surprised that the fighting isn&#x27;t over and that Santa Anna and his army aren&#x27;t expected until mid-March. But after a grueling forced march, Santa Anna unexpectedly arrives on Feb. 23, forcing the Texans to hurriedly retire to the Alamo compound. Despite its vulnerability, the Texans resume fortifying it as best they can. Travis continues to send for reinforcements, but few men arrive.

Santa Anna&#x27;s troops surround the fort, and the siege begins. Bowie meets with Mexican General Manuel Castrillón to talk things over, but Travis stubbornly fires a cannon at the Mexican camp, abruptly ending their conversation. Bowie returns to tell Travis that Santa Anna has offered the opportunity to surrender, but the defenders decide to stay and fight. With his hopes of an easy victory foiled, Santa Anna settles in for a siege but orders that no quarter be given to the Alamo defenders. He orders the band to play Èl Degüello (slit throat), which signifies no quarter will be given to the Texan defenders. Bowie&#x27;s ongoing illness renders him bedridden, and Travis assumes full command.

On Sunday, March 6, Mexican troops assault the Alamo in a pre-dawn attack. Despite heavy casualties, they breach the walls, and most of the Texans, including Travis and Bowie, are slain. Crockett, the last survivor, is taken prisoner. In a final act of defiance, he mockingly offers to safely lead Santa Anna to Sam Houston if he will surrender. Santa Anna angrily orders Crockett to be executed.

Days later, after hearing that the Alamo has fallen, Houston, now in full command of all Texan troops, orders a general retreat eastward. They are pursued by the victorious Mexican Army, led by the over-confident Santa Anna. In an attempt to catch the retreating Texans, and against the advice of his officers, Santa Anna divides his forces, taking a smaller, fast-moving force with him to chase Houston and the fleeing Texas government. A few weeks later, Houston halts his retreat near the San Jacinto River, where he decides to risk everything in a sudden attack when he learns of Santa Anna&#x27;s presence. With the support of two cannons and a group of Juan Seguin&#x27;s mounted Tejanos, Houston surprises Santa Anna&#x27;s army during its afternoon siesta and in the ensuing rout the vengeful Texans massacre at least 700 Mexican soldiers. Santa Anna is captured, and in exchange for his life, he agrees to order all Mexican troops to withdraw from Texas and accept Texan independence. The film ends with an eerie scene where Crockett is standing on the walls of the Alamo, playing his fiddle.

==Production==
=== Development and writing ===
The origin of the project began in the mid 1990&#x27;s, with screenwriter Leslie Bohem, who had previously worked on films such as &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child&quot;, and &quot;Dante’s Peak&quot;. Bohem had a conversation with &quot;Braveheart&quot; screenwriter Randall Wallace at the Austin Film Festival, who told Bohem about a trip he had taken to San Antonio to take a look at The Alamo. Bohem then set off to write a script. In 1998, Touchstone Pictures, a subsidiary of Disney bought the screenplay, and hired Ron Howard and Brian Grazer as producers, with Howard originally set to direct.
In January 2001, &quot;Variety&quot; announced that Kevin Jarre was writing a new script, In October of the same year, it was announced that John Sayles was hired to write a new draft, Sayles, who previously had written and directed &quot;Lone Star&quot;, had come up with a 137-page draft that was considered brilliant, In contrast to the 1960 film of the same name starring John Wayne, this film was going to attempt to depict the political points of view from both the Mexican and Texan sides, as well as explore the personal lives of Alamo heroes William Travis, Jim Bowie and Davy Crockett. Additionally, Santa Anna is more prominently featured. As Howard mentioned in an interview: &quot;I believe audiences are ready to embrace the complexities of the film, but it still boils down to heroism,” “The simplistic approach is not appropriate and it’s not interesting, We know there will be limitations and controversies&quot;. In June 2002, it was announced that Stephen Gaghan was hired to rewrite Sayles&#x27;s script.

Howard stated that he wanted to shoot a grittier film, much in the style of Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s work, with a budget costing about $130 million and having an R rating, further elaborating in interviews at the time with IGN and The Oklahoman, Howard said:&quot;I kept saying I sort of wanted to do &#x27;Traffic&#x27;, we kept working on the screenplay with that kind of multicharacter, multistory line kind of approach. … I can&#x27;t say we ever had anything on paper that I could look at the studio and say, &#x27;You&#x27;ve got it. You&#x27;re fools if you don&#x27;t do this just this way.&#x27; We didn&#x27;t have that. It was still this idea, this notion in my mind more than a really fully realized script.&quot; &quot;My sense of what I wanted to do with it was tougher, more graphic, a closer cousin to &#x27;Saving Private Ryan&#x27;.&quot;

There were financial and creative disagreements between Imagine Entertainment and Disney, particularly over Howard&#x27;s proposed budget. Disney rejected Imagine&#x27;s proposal, and due to the project not moving forward at the time, Howard stepped down as director, but he would stay on the project as an executive producer, alongside Grazer, who stated in an interview at the time:&quot;I wasn&#x27;t interested in making &#x27;The Alamo&#x27; as a PG-13 film, or PG movie, I didn&#x27;t get it, I just didn&#x27;t understand it. Whereas I did understand it through a different filter, through an R-rated, very intense (story) showing sacrifice, showing pain...all of those feelings...I didn&#x27;t understand why you should do it the other way&quot;

Robert Rodriguez was briefly considered for director, but Disney opted for director John Lee Hancock and a budget of $107 million.

===Casting===
During pre-production, several actors such as Mel Gibson and Brad Pitt were considered for roles in the movie. Russell Crowe was in talks to play Sam Houston, while Ethan Hawke signed on as William Barret Travis. Producer Brian Grazer wanted Sean Penn for the role of James Bowie, and Billy Bob Thornton was cast as David Crockett. After Howard stepped down as director, Crowe and Hawke exited the project while Thornton remained, Viggo Mortensen was considered as a possible replacement for Crowe, but Dennis Quaid got cast in the role of Houston. Jason Patric was cast as Bowie, and Patrick Wilson replaced Hawke as Travis. A full $35 million was spent promoting the film.

===Filming on the Alamo set===
Most of the film was shot between January and June 2003, primarily using sets built at a ranch near Austin; at 51 acres, it was the largest set ever built in North America (at the time). A number of buildings, including the mission, were constructed for the film, at a cost of about $10 million. They depicted a Spanish colonial village. The sets were subsequently abandoned but were visited occasionally, at the Milton Reimers Ranch Park, although they were deteriorating; they were not intended to endure for a long period of time. Nine of the 12 major structures were damaged in a fire in September 2011. The park&#x27;s web site in 2020 makes no mention of the movie or the sets.

Hancock&#x27;s version was purported to be the most accurate of all the Alamo films, but various liberties were taken, such as building the Alamo chapel facade forward 40 feet more than the extant (and presumably historically-correct) structure. According to one of the DVD version&#x27;s special features, Hancock did that to show the Alamo chapel and the interior of the fort in one shot.

===Battle scenes===
In the winter of 1835–1836, when the Mexican Army was moving north through desert areas, shortly before it crossed the Rio Bravo (Rio Grande), it endured a snowstorm of uncommon intensity, and soldiers suffered illness and hunger. Snow making machines were used to create the scenes of the march through the snow. Four days later, an actual snow storm blanketed the set. Two calls were made to find thin and gaunt extras to play the soldiers, but the film&#x27;s scenes of the attack on the Alamo were shot in harsh weather. Extras stood for hours in cold rain, making some scenes gruelingly realistic. A few days of the filming was held up, due to bitter cold and very muddy conditions.

===Final editing===
After the film was shot, it was edited down to three hours; later it was reduced to two hours, with scenes and certain characters removed. Shortly prior to the release, 15 minutes were added. Nonetheless, Quaid&#x27;s role had been significantly reduced from the first version.

==Historical accuracy==
The depiction of Crockett&#x27;s fate came from memoirs written by José Enrique de la Peña, an officer in Santa Anna&#x27;s army. Though accepted by many historians, this was the first film to show Crockett executed as a prisoner of war; all others had depicted his death as occurring during the battle. That sparked criticism from many Alamo enthusiasts and some historians, given the disputed nature of its origins.

==Release==

===Box office===
The film was a box office flop. Its opening was overshadowed by &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;, and first weekend earnings were only $9.1 million. The film closed with $22.4 million in the domestic market, and only $25.8 million in total, on a $107 million budget. &quot;The Alamo&quot; remains one of the biggest box office bombs of all time.

===Critical reception===
The film received mixed to negative reviews. It holds a 29% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 159 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10. The critics consensus reads, &quot;Too conventional and un-involving to be memorable&quot;. It holds a Metacritic score of 47/100 based on 38 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

&quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a historically credible but overly prosaic account of the most celebrated episode in the creation of an Americanized Texas&quot;. The &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; gave the film a grade of &quot;B&quot;, saying Hancock, whom the paper points out is a &quot;former Houstonian&quot;, &quot;shows respect if not reverence for his state&#x27;s mythical heritage, even while viewing it from modern perspectives&quot;; it notes the &quot;build-up to battle is prolonged and talky, and for a classic tale of heroic defiance, this &quot;Alamo&quot; feels more restrained than rousing. Again, it&#x27;s no-win. When Hancock supplies history, the action and drama bog down. And even when he&#x27;s right, he&#x27;s wrong, since so many historians disagree about what happened at the site in what is now Downtown San Antonio&quot;.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave it a &quot;C+&quot;, saying &quot;Hancock&#x27;s moderate, apolitical, war-is-hell dramatization of the famous 1836 battle that shaped the future of a free and independent American Texas isn&#x27;t nearly the flop that the exceptionally harsh and unavoidable advance chatter has suggested it is. It&#x27;s not the jingoistic call to patriotism of John Wayne&#x27;s 1960 version, either. But &quot;The Alamo&quot; never harmonizes into a cinematic experience any more resonant than the average, manly, why-we-fight pic, or coalesces into a stirring cry for freedom&quot;.

According to Roger Ebert: &quot;Conventional wisdom in Hollywood is that any movie named &quot;The Alamo&quot; must be simplistic and rousing, despite the fact that we already know all the defenders got killed (if we don&#x27;t know it, we find out in the first scene). Here is a movie that captures the loneliness and dread of men waiting for two weeks for what they expect to be certain death, and it somehow succeeds in taking those pop-culture brand names like Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie and giving them human form&quot;. He awarded the film three and a half out of four stars, and it notably became the film&#x27;s most positive review.

<text>Silent trade, also called silent barter, dumb barter (&quot;dumb&quot; here used in its old meaning of &quot;mute&quot;), or depot trade, is a method by which traders who cannot speak each other&#x27;s language can trade without talking. &quot;Group A&quot; would leave trade goods in a prominent position and signal, by gong, fire, or drum for example, that they had left goods. &quot;Group B&quot; would then arrive at the spot, examine the goods and deposit their trade goods or money that they wanted to exchange and withdraw. &quot;Group A&quot; would then return and either accept the trade by taking the goods from &quot;Group B&quot; or withdraw again leaving &quot;Group B&quot; to add to or change out items to create an equal value. The trade ends when &quot;Group A&quot; accepts &quot;Group B&#x27;s&quot; offer and removes the offered goods leaving &quot;Group B&quot; to remove the original goods.

This system was used in many parts of ancient Africa. Silent trading was mainly used during the period 500 to 1500. The practice was also well established between tribes in Africa in their trade with India. Cosmas Indicopleustes describes this practiced in Azania, where officials from Axum traded for gold with beef. Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal recorded this practice when he occupied Ceuta in 1415.

In West Africa gold mined south of the Sahel was traded for salt mined in the desert. The salt from the desert was needed by the people of Sahel to flavor and preserve their food and the gold had obvious value, especially in trading with the European people. Because of this trade, cities grew and flourished and parts of West Africa became commercial centers. West Africa produced large amounts of gold until about 1500 AD. The communication in this gold-for-salt was carried out using drums.

Silent trade might be used because of an inability to speak the other traders&#x27; language, or to protect the secrets of where the valuable gold and salt came from.

Silent bartering has been used since ancient times, such as the ancient Ghana Empire. The Ghanaian salt traders would leave pounds of salt by the Niger river and the gold traders would leave a fair amount of gold in turn.

==Procedure==
To perform a silent trade, one group of traders would go to a specific location, leave their trading goods and then withdraw to a distance. Then play a drum to signal the other traders that a silent trade was taking place. The other group of traders would then approach and inspect the goods (most commonly salt or gold). If the goods met with approval, the second group would then take the goods, leave their own goods in return, and depart. This system of trading was used in particular in ancient Ghana. It was also used among the Kushites and the Aksumites.

The Greek historian Herodotus wrote about the gold trade with Ghana and Carthage: &quot;The Carthaginians also tell us that they trade with a race of men who live in a part of Libya beyond the Pillars of Hercules. On reaching this country, they unload their goods, arrange them tidily along the beach, and then, returning to their boats, raise a smoke. Seeing the smoke, the natives come down to the beach, place on the ground a certain quantity of gold in exchange for the goods, and go off again to a distance. The Carthaginians then come ashore and take a look at the gold; and if they think it represents a fair price for their wares, they collect it and go away; if, on the other hand, it seems too little, they go back aboard and wait, and the natives come and add to the gold until they are satisfied. There is perfect honesty on both sides; the Carthaginians never touch the gold until it equals in value what they have offered for sale, and the natives never touch the goods until the gold has been taken away.&quot;

==Banyan merchants==
W.S.W. Ruschenberger, M.D., in Zanzibar in 1835, describes Banyan merchants, then cites &quot;Establecimientos ultramarinos. Tomo III. Madrid 1786&quot; in writing:
...A very short time sufficed them to transact the most important business. They usually dealt in bazaars; the vender told the price of his goods in a subdued voice and in few words; the purchaser replied by taking his hand, and by a certain manner of doubling and extending the fingers, explained what abatement he wished in the price. The bargain was often concluded without speaking a word; and, to ratify it, the hand was again taken in token of its inviolability...Such were the Banyans three centuries gone by, and we have reason to think, they have not been entirely changed.

<doc id="1343171" wikidata="Q5471670" url="?curid=1343171" title="Fort Meigs">
<text>Fort Meigs was a United States fortification along the Maumee River in what is now Perrysburg, Ohio during the War of 1812. The British Army, supported by Tecumseh&#x27;s Confederacy, failed to capture the fort during the siege of Fort Meigs. It is named in honor of Ohio governor Return J. Meigs Jr., for his support in providing General William Henry Harrison with militia and supplies for the line of forts along the Old Northwest frontier.

==History==
Construction of the fort started in February 1813 by soldiers under the command of General William Henry Harrison (future president) at a site where present-day Perrysburg, Ohio developed. It was to provide a supply depot and staging point for US military operations in Canada that would also command the rapids of the Maumee River. The remnants of the British Fort Miami were across the river downstream, to the northeast. The winter climate was harsh, and the landscape unforgiving. A U.S. sentry froze to death during his two hours of guard duty. The walls were constructed using logs cut to a 15-foot length, partially buried in the ground, then protected by a steep earthen slope thrown against the logs to strengthen them against bombardment. An embankment against the interior side provided a parapet. When completed, the fort was the largest wooden walled fortification in North America.

The first siege: On May 1, 1813, British allied forces, under General Henry Proctor and Chief Tecumseh, opened a bombardment of the fort, which had mustered 1,200 regulars and militia, and laid siege. Reinforcements reached the fort on May 4, increasing its garrison to 2,800. Early on the morning of May 5, a detachment from Clay&#x27;s brigade under Colonel William Dudley landed from boats on the north bank of the river, stormed the British batteries on the north bank and spiked the guns. Coming under fire from Indians in the woods, part of the Kentuckian force pursued Tecumseh&#x27;s men, who led them deeper into the forest. In the woods, the disorganized Kentuckians suffered heavy casualties in confused fighting. Nearly 550 were captured, and of Dudley&#x27;s 866 officers and men, only 150 returned to the fort. This became known as &quot;Dudley&#x27;s Massacre&quot; or &quot;Dudley&#x27;s Defeat&quot;.

The Shawnee, Delaware (Lenape) and other Native American warriors attacked any wood-gathering parties sent out from the fort. Harrison held out against the British by using a pair of 14-foot high embankments (&quot;traverses&quot;) thrown up inside the walls along the length of the interior to absorb the incoming British shells. Proctor abandoned the siege on May 9, 1813 and retreated to Detroit.

The second siege: Having mobilized the garrison into an army, Harrison left General Green Clay in command of the fort, much reduced in size from its original layout. In July 1813, the British attempted to appease their allies by again besieging Fort Meigs. The Indians staged a mock battle to lure the garrison out. The Americans, however, saw through the ploy. After the failed siege attempt, the British moved on to Fort Stephenson, where Fremont, Ohio stands today. That attack also failed, causing heavy British losses and forcing their retreat to Canada. Once the British had retreated from the area for good, General Harrison ordered Fort Meigs dismantled. In its place, a small, square stockade was constructed to serve as a supply base and to protect the Maumee rapids. The Treaty of Fort Meigs was signed there in 1817, and the post was abandoned that same year.

In 1864, brothers Timothy and Thomas Hayes became the owners of the land on which the fort had stood and were instrumental in preserving it in memory and honor of the men who fought the battles. The heirs of the Hayes brothers sold the property to the state in 1907. On September 1, 1908, the large obelisk monument that can be seen from outside the fort was dedicated by a local veteran of the Civil War to the fallen soldiers of Fort Meigs. The Ohio Historical Society reconstructed the fort in the late 1960s, and its museum, featuring numerous artifacts uncovered during excavation in connection with the rebuilding, opened in 1974. It is a National Historic Landmark.

==Memorial==

As of 2024, Fort Meigs is the site of an Ohio State Memorial in Perrysburg, Ohio. The 65-acre (263,000 m2) park includes the full-size 10-acre replica of the 1813 fort. Between 2000 and 2003 its wooden palisades were rebuilt with fresh timbers, the seven blockhouses were repaired, and exhibits or facilities built inside four of them. The $6.2 million renovation project also saw the museum replaced by a Museum and Education Center of 14,000 square feet that features 3,000 square feet of exhibits on Ohio&#x27;s role in the War of 1812, classrooms for student and adult workshops, and office and maintenance areas. The museum exhibit &quot;Legacy of Freedom: Fort Meigs and the War of 1812&quot; focuses on the themes of era, conflict, understanding and remembrance. These sections place the War of 1812 into the context of the times and explain Fort Meigs&#x27; role in the conflict.

The original grand traverse is preserved within the interior of the fort, although erosion has reduced it from its original 14-foot height, and a reverse traverse was constructed to the original specifications by the OHS. Located at the corner of a nearby cemetery are the remains of an original mortar position laid by the British for use during the siege.

==Re-enactments==
Several re-enactments take place at Fort Meigs each year. They include:
* &quot;First Siege&quot;, a battle re-enactment portraying the events of the siege of Fort Meigs in May 1813, complete with American and British infantry and artillery. This event is held on Memorial Day weekend and is followed on Monday by a ceremony commemorating the fallen soldiers.
* &quot;Muster on the Maumee&quot;, a &quot;timeline event&quot; held at the fort on Father&#x27;s Day weekend, includes military re-enactors from ancient Roman soldiers to the modern-era soldier.
* &quot;Independence Day&quot;, a re-enactment portraying the events on the Fourth of July in 1813. It includes toasts and an 18-gun salute.
* &quot;Garrison Ghost Walk&quot;, an event held on the last two weekends in October; a re-enactor guides visitors through the dark fort to tell ghost stories.

<text>Indios Verdes metro station is a station of the Mexico City Metro along Avenida de los Insurgentes, in Gustavo A. Madero, Mexico City. It is an at-grade station with two island platforms serving as the northern terminus of Line 3 (the Olive Line). It is followed by Deportivo 18 de Marzo metro station. Indios Verdes metro station was inaugurated on 1 December 1979 providing southward service toward Hospital General metro station.

The station services the (neighborhoods) of Residencial Zacatenco and Santa Isabel Tola. The station and surrounding area are named after the verdigris statues of Itzcoatl and Ahuitzotl, both Aztec rulers. Located in the nearby Parque Mestizaje, these statues are collectively known as the , and their silhouettes are depicted in the pictogram.

The station facilities are accessible to people with disabilities featuring tactile pavings and braille signage plates. The station is commonly ranked among the busiest in the system. In 2019, it recorded an average daily ridership of 107,376 passengers, making it the third-busiest station overall and the busiest on its line.

==Location and station layout==

Indios Verdes is an at-grade metro station located along Avenida de los Insurgentes in the &quot;colonias&quot; (&quot;neighborhoods&quot;) of Residencial Zacatenco and Santa Isabel Tola, in Gustavo A. Madero, in northern Mexico City. The railyard and the line&#x27;s workshop, known as Ticomán, are located adjacent to the station.

The station has four exits: one to the northeast and northwest, and one to the southeast and southwest. The station offers a partially disabled-accessible service with tactile pavings and braille signage plates. Within the system, Deportivo 18 de Marzo is the next station. Street stalls abound in the CETRAM, where commuters can purchase street food, clothing, accessories, flowers, gifts, and phone accessories. According to the vendors themselves, there are about 1,000 stalls.

The area is serviced by a (CETRAM), a transportation hub covering . From there, commuters can access various routes and modes of transportation. Among the available options are Lines 1, 3, and 7 of the Metrobús bus rapid transit (BRT) system, Line IV of the Mexibús BRT system, Line 1 of the Cablebús aerial lift network, and Line 2 of the Mexicable aerial lift network. The station facilities offer accessibility for people with disabilities, featuring elevators, escalators and tactile pavings.

Local buses departing from the area include Routes 101, 101-A, 101-B, 101-D, 102, 107-B, and 108 of the network. Additionally, as of 2017, there were 28 routes (bus and minibus routes) originating from various locations within the city and the metropolitan area.

==History and construction==

Line 3 of the Mexico City Metro was built by Ingeniería de Sistemas de Transportes Metropolitano, Electrometro, and Cometro, the latter being a subsidiary of Empresas ICA. It opened on 20 November 1970. Northward service toward Indios Verdes station began on 1 December 1979, becoming the line&#x27;s northern terminal station, with trains operating southward toward Hospital General metro station. The section between Indios Verdes and Deportivo 18 de Marzo station is long.

Originally, Line 8 (which runs from downtown Mexico City to Constitución de 1917 station in Iztapalapa) was planned to extend from Pantitlán in eastern Mexico City to Indios Verdes station. However, the project was canceled due to potential structural issues it would have caused near the Zócalo area, as it was intended to interchange with Line 2 at Zócalo station. The plan for Line 8 was later modified to run from Indios Verdes to Constitución de 1917 station. But its construction did not progress beyond Garibaldi / Lagunilla metro station, which has served as its provisional terminal since 1994.

The station&#x27;s CETRAM began reorganization in 2020. The project plan included demolishing the Metrobús station serving Lines 1 and 3, as well as the temporary Mexibús station, and relocating both next to the metro station building. It also aimed to reorganize the bus hub and facilitate connections between the stations through a series of pedestrian bridges linking them to the Cablebús, Metrobús Line 7, and Mexicable services. As of September 2024, the Metrobús, Mexibús, and Cablebús projects have been completed.

===Name and pictogram===

The station is named after the verdigris statues of two Aztec rulers, Itzcoatl and Ahuitzotl, collectively known as the (Green Indians Monument). The station&#x27;s pictogram features silhouettes of these statues. In April 2023, Adriana Espinosa de los Monteros, a representative for the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) party in the Congress of Mexico City, proposed renaming the metro station to Estación Emperadores Mexicas () because she considers the term &quot;Indian&quot; is derogatory, discriminatory, and &quot;[is still used to hurt] the sensitivity of the recipient by considering inferior due to their poverty or indigenous background&quot;. She argued that the change is necessary &quot;to respect the spirit of the Political Constitution of Mexico City&quot;. The proposed renaming would apply only to the metro station and does not mention any adjacent stations or the . Transport operators in the area have stated that the change would be unnecessary and that it would not affect commuters or how they refer to the station.

===Incidents===
Around 7:30 in the morning on 12 April 2013, an explosion was heard on the stairs leading to CETRAM&#x27;s I platform, with no injuries or damage reported. Authorities stated that a box containing explosives, cables, pellets, a battery, and a watch was allegedly left on the steps leading to exit I by a man assisted by an accomplice acting as a lookout. On 10 February 2021, during a rainy afternoon, an approaching train caught fire on the platform, but no passengers were reported harmed. On 20 April 2021, the third railcar of a train derailed when the driver performed a maneuver at the Ticomán railyard. No injuries were reported, but the train had to be taken out of service. Similarly, on March 30, 2023, another train experienced a comparable incident.

Indios Verdes is one of the metro stations that floods most frequently during heavy rain.

==Ridership==
According to the data provided by the authorities, Indios Verdes metro station is one of the busiest in the system&#x27;s 195 stations. Before the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on public transport, commuters averaged per year between 107,376 and 120,800 daily entrances between 2014 and 2019; the station had a ridership of 39,192,273 passengers in 2019, which represented a decrease of 1,109,896 passengers compared to 2018. In 2019 specifically, Indios Verdes metro station ranked as the third busiest of the system and it was the busiest of the line.

<text>Coleraine Football Club is a professional Northern Irish football club, playing in the NIFL Premiership, the highest level of the Northern Ireland Football League.

The club, founded in 1927 hails from Coleraine, County Londonderry, and plays its home matches at The Showgrounds. Club colours are blue and white. The club won the Irish League title once (in 1973–74) and the Irish Cup on six occasions, most recently in 2017–18. They are also the only Irish League club to have won two successive all-Ireland competitions, lifting the Blaxnit Cup in 1969 and 1970. The club share a rivalry with Ballymena United.

==History==

The original Coleraine Football Club was founded in June 1927 originally called Coleraine FC at a meeting in the local Orange hall. The club was formed out of a merger between two local sides: Coleraine Olympic and Coleraine Alexandra with John McCandless being one of the founders and original player / manager for the club. The original club colours were all white, hence the club&#x27;s original nickname – the Lilywhites. The club secured its first trophy in the 1931–32 season, defeating Ballymena United 3–0 at Solitude to win the Gold Cup.

In 1948, Coleraine reached its first Irish Cup final, going down 3–0 to Linfield. 1953 brought another appearance in the final and another defeat, again to Linfield, this time by five goals to nil. The 1950s saw the City Cup won for the first time (1953–54) and a second triumph in the Gold Cup (1958).

In 1961, chairman Jack Doherty persuaded Bertie Peacock to sign for Coleraine after he left Celtic. It would prove to be one of the most important transfers in the club&#x27;s history. In 1965, Coleraine won the Irish Cup for the first time, defeating Glenavon 2–1 at Windsor Park, with goals from Shaun Dunlop and Derek Irwin. Coleraine thus gained its first experience of European football, against Soviet outfit Dynamo Kiev, becoming the first football club from the United Kingdom to play behind the Iron Curtain. Coleraine also won the first two Blaxnit all-Ireland cups in 1969 and 1970. Coleraine faced Kilmarnock in the 1970 Fairs Cup, and after a 1–1 draw in the first leg, the Bannsiders pulled off an historic 3–2 victory thanks to a Des Dickson hat-trick.

In 1972, the Irish Cup was won again, this time by beating Portadown 2–1, with goals from Des Dickson and Ivan Murray. The Holy Grail of the Gibson Cup was finally captured in 1974. Under the management of Bertie Peacock, the squad consisting of the likes of Des Dickson, Johnny McCurdy, Ivan Murray, Michael Guy and Vince Magee clinched the title ahead of Portadown. Bertie Peacock resigned in 1974 and Ivan Murray and Johnny McCurdy took over the reins. Murray continued as manager until 1978 and during his spell in charge the Irish Cup was won twice more – both times against Linfield. In 1975, it took three games before a goal from Jim &quot;Chang&quot; Smith in the second replay proved decisive. The 1977 victory was more emphatic with Liam Beckett, Des Dickson, Frankie Moffatt and Michael Guy scoring to give Coleraine a 4–1 victory. It was to be the club&#x27;s last major trophy for 26 years.

In the 1980s there were two more cup finals, in 1982 and 1986, ending in defeats to Linfield and Glentoran respectively. For three seasons in a row in the mid-1980s the club finished second in the league behind Linfield, but in the first part of the 1990s Coleraine struggled. In 1995 they dropped into the First Division. Under Kenny Shiels, Coleraine won the inaugural First Division title and in its first season back in the top flight, won the Ulster Cup and came agonisingly close to the title, being pipped late on by Crusaders.

After a poor start to the 1999–00 season, Shiels resigned and was replaced by Marty Quinn, who rallied the team to finish second in the league behind Linfield and reach the Irish Cup semi-finals and the Coca-Cola Cup final. The next 2 seasons saw Coleraine finish fourth both times – potential title challenges being ruined by inconsistency. In 2002–03, Coleraine ended the season in third place and reached their first Irish Cup Final since 1986. In the final, they faced Glentoran as massive underdogs as the east Belfast side were looking to complete a clean sweep of trophies. After an early strike from Gareth McAuley was harshly ruled out, Coleraine kept going and scored through Jody Tolan. Despite increasing Glentoran pressure, Coleraine held on and the trophy famine was over. The following season saw the club reach the Irish Cup final again, but this time it was Glentoran who emerged triumphant.

The club&#x27;s well-publicised financial problems had already overshadowed much of the 2003–04 season (despite a substantial donation from &quot;Cold Feet&quot; actor and Coleraine fan James Nesbitt) and at its end the club was forced to operate on a reduced budget, with several top players leaving. Despite this a top six finish was still achieved. The summer of 2005 saw more budget cuts and several big names leaving the Showgrounds, but this time the main concern for fans was the very future of the club. In August, the Inland Revenue filed for a winding-up order against Coleraine due to debts of £1.3 million. The Friends of Coleraine, worked tirelessly to persuade the High Court to postpone the hearing to allow them to put together a business plan to show that the club could be viably run. The club were liquidated on 9 August 2006 after they were allowed to enter administration, and a steering committee was set up to run the new club Calver Holdings Ltd.

The club went on to defeat Institute to win the North West Senior Cup for the 1st time. The club were incredibly allowed to stay in the Premier League and survival was ensured on the pitch, the Friends of Coleraine formally took control of the club and appointed a new board. In 2008 the club reached the Irish Cup final, but lost 2–1 to Linfield. Manager Marty Quinn resigned after that game and his successor, former assistant David Platt, led Coleraine to a fifth-place finish in his first season in charge.

On 27 March 2010, Coleraine narrowly lost on penalties against Glentoran in the final of the Co-Operative Insurance Cup. They also lost out to Linfield in the semi-finals of the Irish Cup. Despite possessing the two top goalscorers in the league, including 41 goal Rory Patterson, Coleraine could only finish the season in seventh. Despite the arrival of much-travelled English striker Leon Knight, inconsistent form throughout the first half of the 2010–11 season resulted in manager David Platt being sacked at the start of February. His replacement, Oran Kearney revitalised a struggling team and they climbed the table rapidly, again ending up seventh.

An overhaul of the squad over the summer saw Kearney put his mark on the club and the improvement shown in his first four months in charge then continued, with Coleraine performing well in the league and reaching the final of the IRN-BRU League Cup.

In 2012–13 Coleraine finished the season in 6th place after making the split five games previously.

In the 2015–16 season, after many average seasons, the Bannsiders hit title winning form, going on a winning run with it being halted after a while by Linfield. They started to fall away after that result, being knocked out of the Irish Cup by 3–1 by Portadown and finished in 5th place and lost the Europa League Play-off by 2–1 to Glentoran.

The 2016–2017 was a fairly good one for the Bannsiders with them currently sitting an impressive 3rd in the table and they also booked their place in the 2017 Irish Cup Final by beating Glenavon 2–1 to reach their first final in nine years, where they lost 3–0 to the double winners Linfield.

At the start of the 2017/18 season &#x27;The Bannsiders&#x27; made a few new signings. Josh Carson, who came from Linfield originally playing for York City and Ipswich Town, signed for Coleraine as well as Aaron Traynor and Stephen O&#x27;Donnell from Warrenpoint Town and Institute respectively. They started their pre-season off well by beating Bangor City 3–1. They were then defeated in the Europa League first round qualifier by Haugesund from Norway. During the 2017/18 season, the Bannsiders went on an amazing run, losing once only to Linfield in the NIFL Premiership, finally finishing in second place, two points behind Crusaders. Although Coleraine did not attain the title, a sixth Irish Cup triumph was secured when they defeated Cliftonville in the final of that competition in May, thanks to the heroics of starlet Aaron Burns.

Oran Kearney left the club to take over at SPFL Premiership side St. Mirren in September 2018, and was replaced by Dungannon Swifts manager Rodney McAree, who guided Coleraine to a sixth-place finish and an Irish Cup semi-final. Following a failure to win the Europa League playoffs, McAree was sacked on 10 May 2019, having only been in charge for eight months. Kearney departed St. Mirren via mutual agreement to rejoin Coleraine as manager on 3 July 2019, citing family reasons as the main reason for leaving the Scottish side. Kearney settled back into his role as manager of Coleraine for a second spell. The summer transfer window of 19/20 caused some controversy with Kearney selling star striker Jamie McGonigle to Crusaders for £50,000, while Aaron Burns was also allowed to leave for free.
Despite losing two key players, Coleraine started the season well, recording notable victories over reigning Champions and runners ups, Linfield and Ballymena respectively. With the club involved in a five way title race, the club opted to bolster their squad in the January window with the signing of Nixon from Carrick Rangers. In February 2020, Coleraine beat Crusaders 2–1 in the Bet McLean League Cup final to win the first major trophy of the season, with another two still up for grabs. Coleraine were second four points behind Linfield and in an Irish Cup semi-final until the season was stopped due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Coleraine still qualified for the 2020 UEFA Europa League Qualifiers and were drawn against Slovenian champions NK Maribor, who played the likes of Chelsea and Sevilla in the UEFA Champions League a few years previous. Despite being massive underdogs, Coleraine won the game on penalties, sending them through to the second qualifying round, having defeated La Fiorita in the round previous to Maribor. The Bannsiders were drawn at home to SPFL Premiership side Motherwell and having been 2–0 down at half time, brought the game back to 2-2 and managed to hold 10-man Motherwell off until penalties, but the Scottish side progressed through thanks to goalkeeper Trevor Carson&#x27;s heroics in the penalty shootout.

In the 2020–21 season, Coleraine once again demonstrated their competitive edge by securing a commendable second place in the NIFL Premiership. The following season saw them make a notable run to the League Cup final, narrowly missing out on the trophy. Despite facing stiff competition, they maintained a solid sixth-place finish in the 2021-22 league campaign, reflecting their consistency on the pitch.

Oran Kearney&#x27;s side continued to perform steadily in the 2022–23 season, securing another sixth-placed finish in the league. Their appearance in another League Cup final highlighted their ongoing commitment to success, further solidifying their standing in Northern Irish football.

== Allegations of sectarianism ==
The club has long been associated with the Protestant / loyalist side of the community and in 2024 the club was reported to the IFA league for playing sectarian songs in their social club. An investigation suggested fans were also chanting anti-Catholic slogans. 

In 2022 it was reported that Coleraine supporters had teamed up with an English football hooligan firm to provoke violence ahead of a game against the predominantly Catholic supporters of Cliftonville club.

<text>The Alamo is a 1960 American epic historical war film about the 1836 Siege and Battle of the Alamo produced and directed by John Wayne and starring Wayne as Davy Crockett. The film also co-stars Richard Widmark as Jim Bowie and Laurence Harvey as William B. Travis, and features: Frankie Avalon, Patrick Wayne, Linda Cristal, Joan O&#x27;Brien, Chill Wills, Joseph Calleia, Ken Curtis, Ruben Padilla as Santa Anna, and Richard Boone as Sam Houston. Shot in 70 mm Todd-AO by William H. Clothier, it was released by United Artists.

==Plot==
Sam Houston leads the forces of Texas against Mexico and needs time to build an army. The opposing Mexican forces, led by General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna are numerically stronger as well as better-armed and trained. Nevertheless, the Texans have spirit and morale remains generally high. Lieutenant Colonel William Travis is tasked with defending the Alamo, a former mission in San Antonio. Jim Bowie comes with reinforcements and the defenders prepare. Meanwhile, Davy Crockett arrives with a group of Tennesseans.

Santa Anna&#x27;s armies arrive and surround the fort. The siege begins. An embassy from the Mexican Army approaches the Alamo, and as they list the terms of surrender, Travis fires a cannon, signalling his refusal to surrender. In a nighttime raid, the Texans sabotage a super-sized cannon used by the Mexicans. They maintain high hopes as they are told a strong force led by Colonel James Fannin is on its way to break the siege. Crockett, however, sensing an imminent attack, sends one of his younger men, Smitty, to ask Houston for help, knowing this will perhaps spare Smitty&#x27;s life.

The Mexicans frontally attack the Alamo. The defenders hold out and inflict heavy losses on the Mexicans, although the Texans&#x27; own losses are not insignificant, and Bowie sustains a leg wound. Morale drops when a messenger informs Travis that Fannin&#x27;s reinforcements have been ambushed and slaughtered by the Mexicans. Travis chooses to stay with his command and defend the Alamo, but he gives the other defenders the option of leaving. Crockett, Bowie and their men prepare to leave, but an inspired tribute by Travis convinces them to stay and fight to the end. The noncombatants, including most of the women and children, leave the Alamo.

On the thirteenth day of the siege, Santa Anna&#x27;s artillery bombards the Alamo, and the entire Mexican army sweeps forward, attacking on all sides. The defenders kill numerous Mexicans, but the attack is overwhelming and the fortress&#x27; walls are breached. Travis tries to rally the men, but is shot and killed. Crockett leads the Texans in the final defense of the fort, but the Mexicans swarm through and overwhelm the defenders. Crockett is killed in the chaos when he is run through by a lance and then blown up as he ignites the powder magazine. Bowie, in bed with his wound, kills several Mexicans but is bayoneted and dies. As the last Texan is killed, the Mexican soldiers discover the hiding place of the wife and child of Texan defender Captain Dickinson.

The battle eventually ends with a total victory for the Mexicans. Santa Anna observes the carnage and provides safe passage for Mrs. Dickinson and her child. Smitty returns too late, watching from a distance. He takes off his hat in respect and then escorts Mrs. Dickinson away from the battlefield.

The subplot follows the conflict existing among the strong-willed personalities of Travis, Bowie, and Crockett. Travis stubbornly defends his decisions as commander of the garrison against the suggestions of the other two - particularly Bowie with whom the most bitter conflict develops - as well as trying to maintain discipline among a force made up primarily of independently minded frontiersmen and settlers. Crockett, well liked by both Bowie and Travis, eventually becomes a mediator between the other two as Bowie constantly threatens to withdraw his men rather than deal with Travis. Despite their personal conflicts, all three learn to subordinate their differences, and in the end, bind themselves together in an act of bravery to defend the fort against inevitable defeat.

==Production==

===Background===
By 1945, John Wayne had decided to make a movie about the 1836 Battle of the Alamo. He hired James Edward Grant as scriptwriter, and the two began researching the battle and preparing a draft script. They hired John Ford&#x27;s son Patrick (who wrote a screenplay about the battle in 1948) as a research assistant. As the script neared completion, however, Wayne and Herbert Yates, the president of Republic Pictures, clashed over the proposed $3 million budget. Wayne left Republic over the feud but was unable to take his script with him. That script later was rewritten and made into the movie &quot;The Last Command&quot; with Jim Bowie the character of focus.

Wayne and producer Robert Fellows formed Batjac, their own production company. As Wayne developed his vision of what a movie about the Alamo should be, he concluded he did not want to risk seeing that vision changed; he would produce and direct the movie himself, though not act in it. However, he was unable to enlist financial support for the project without the presumptive box-office guarantee his on-screen appearance would provide. In 1956, he signed with United Artists; UA would contribute $2.5 million to the movie&#x27;s development and serve as distributor. In exchange, Batjac was to contribute an additional $1.5 to $2.5 million, and Wayne would star in the movie. Wayne secured the remainder of the financing from wealthy Texans who insisted the movie be shot in Texas. After the movie was finished, Wayne admitted he invested $1.5 million of his own money in the film (taking out second mortgages on his houses and using his vehicles as collateral to obtain loans) and believed it was a good investment.

===Set===

The movie set, later known as Alamo Village, was constructed near Brackettville, Texas, on the ranch of James T. Shahan. Chatto Rodriquez, the general contractor of the set, built of tarred roads for access to the set from Brackettville. His men sank six wells to provide 12,000 gallons (45.4 cubic meters) of water each day, and laid miles of sewage and water lines. They also built of horse corrals.

Rodriquez worked with art designer Alfred Ybarra to create the set. Historians Randy Roberts and James Olson describe it as &quot;the most authentic set in the history of the movies&quot;. Over a million-and-a-quarter adobe bricks were formed by hand to create the walls of the former Alamo Mission. The set was an extensive three-quarter-scale replica of the mission, and has been used in other Western films and television series, including other depictions of the battle. It took almost two years to construct.

===Casting===
Wayne was to have portrayed Sam Houston, a bit part that would have let him focus on his first major directing effort, but investors insisted he play a leading character. He took on the role of Davy Crockett, handing the part of Houston to Richard Boone. Wayne cast Richard Widmark as Jim Bowie and Laurence Harvey as William Barrett Travis. Harvey was chosen because Wayne admired British stage actors and he wanted &quot;British class&quot;. When production became tense, Harvey spoke lines from Shakespeare in a Texan accent. Other roles went to family and close friends of Wayne, including his son Patrick Wayne and daughter Aissa.

John Wayne had made &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; (1959) with singer Ricky Nelson in a supporting role to attract teen audiences. It had worked, so he hired Frankie Avalon to perform a similar function. According to Avalon, &quot;Wayne had seen some of the rushes from &quot;Timberland&quot; and thought I would be right&quot;. After making the film, Wayne told the press: &quot;We&#x27;re not cutting one bit of any scene in which Frankie appears. I believe he is the finest young talent I&#x27;ve seen in a long time&quot;. &quot;Mr. Wayne said I was natural as far as acting goes&quot;, said Avalon. Avalon&#x27;s character was fictitious and survived the attack. 

Several days after filming began, Widmark complained he had been miscast and tried to leave. Among other things, it seemed ridiculous that the relatively diminutive (5&#x27;9&quot;) [175 cm] Widmark would be playing the &quot;larger than life&quot; Bowie, who was a reported 6&#x27;6&quot; (198 cm). After threats of legal action, he agreed to finish the picture. During the filming he had Burt Kennedy rewrite his lines.

Avalon says: &quot;There may have been some conflict with Widmark in portraying the role that he did, but I didn&#x27;t see any of that. All I know is he was tough to work for without a doubt because he [Wayne] wanted it his way and he wanted professionalism. He wanted everybody to know their lines and be on their mark and do what he wanted them to do&quot;.

Sammy Davis Jr. asked Wayne for the part of a slave, for he wanted to break out of performing song and dance. Some producers blocked the move, apparently because Davis was dating white actress May Britt.

===Direction===
Wayne&#x27;s mentor John Ford showed up uninvited and attempted to exert undue influence on the film. Wayne sent him off to shoot unnecessary second-unit footage in order to maintain his own authority. Virtually nothing of Ford&#x27;s footage was used, but Ford erroneously is described as an uncredited co-director.

According to many people involved in the film, Wayne was an intelligent and gifted director despite a weakness for the long-winded dialogue of James Edward Grant, his favorite screenwriter. Roberts and Olson describe his direction as &quot;competent, but not outstanding&quot;. Widmark complained that Wayne would try to tell him and other actors how to play their parts which sometimes went against their own interpretation of characters.

===Filming===
Filming began on September 9, 1959. Some actors, notably Frankie Avalon, were intimidated by rattlesnakes. Crickets were everywhere, often ruining shots by jumping on actors&#x27; shoulders or chirping loudly.

A bit player, LeJean Ethridge, died in a domestic dispute during filming, and Wayne was called to testify at an inquest.

Harvey forgot that a firing cannon has a recoil; during the scene in which, as Travis, he fires in response to a surrender demand, the cannon came down on his foot, breaking it. Because he did not scream in pain until after Wayne had called &quot;Cut&quot;, Wayne praised his professionalism.

Filming ended on December 15. A total of 560,000 feet (170,688 meters) of film was produced for 566 scenes. Despite the scope of the filming, it lasted only three weeks longer than scheduled. By the end of development, the film had been edited to three hours and 13 minutes.

===Music===
The score was composed by Dimitri Tiomkin, and most famously featured the song &quot;The Green Leaves of Summer&quot;, with music by Tiomkin and lyrics by Paul Francis Webster. The song was performed on the soundtrack album by The Brothers Four whose rendition reached #65 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart; it has been covered by many artists.

Another well known song from this film is &quot;Ballad of the Alamo&quot; (with Paul Francis Webster), which was performed on the soundtrack album by Marty Robbins. Frankie Avalon released a cover version as did the folk duo Bud &amp; Travis whose rendition (with &quot;The Green Leaves of Summer&quot; on the flip side) reached #64 on the Billboard chart. Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time.

The original soundtrack album has been issued on Columbia Records, Varèse Sarabande, and Ryko Records. In 2010, a complete score containing recorded versions of Tiomkin&#x27;s music was issued on Tadlow Music/Prometheus Records, as conducted by Nic Raine and played by the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. This release contains previously unreleased material.

==Release==
Wayne hired publicist Russell Birdwell to coordinate the media campaign. Birdwell convinced seven states to declare an Alamo Day and sent information to elementary schools around the United States to assist in teaching about the Alamo.

On October 24, 1960, the world premiere was held at the Woodlawn Theatre in San Antonio, Texas.

==Themes==
===Historical accuracy===
The film does little to explain the causes of the Texas Revolution or why the battle took place. Alamo historian Timothy Todish claims that &quot;there is not a single scene in &quot;The Alamo&quot; which corresponds to a historically verifiable incident&quot;. One particularly egregious scene has a courier character (played by Wayne’s son Patrick) report that Goliad’s Col. Fannin would not provide reinforcements, because his troops had “been massacred,” even though that event transpired over two weeks after the fall of the Alamo. Historians James Frank Dobie and Lon Tinkle demanded their names be removed as historical advisors.

===Politics===
Wayne&#x27;s daughter Aissa wrote about her father&#x27;s project: &quot;I think making &quot;The Alamo&quot; became my father&#x27;s own form of combat. More than an obsession, it was the most intensely personal project in his career&quot;. Many of Wayne&#x27;s associates agreed that the film was a political platform for Wayne. Many of the statements that his character made reflected Wayne&#x27;s anti-communist views. To be sure, there is an overwhelming theme of freedom and the right of individuals to make their own decisions. One may point to a scene in which Wayne, as Crockett, remarks: &quot;Republic. I like the sound of the word. Means that people can live free, talk free, go or come, buy or sell, be drunk or sober, however they choose. Some words give you a feeling. Republic is one of those words that makes me tight in the throat&quot;.

The film draws elements from the Cold War environment in which it was produced. According to Roberts and Olson, &quot;the script evokes parallels between Santa Anna&#x27;s Mexico and Khruschchev&#x27;s Soviet Union as well as Hitler&#x27;s Germany. All three demanded lines in the sand and resistance to death&quot;.

Many of the minor characters, at some point during the film, speak about freedom and/or death, and their sentiments may have reflected Wayne&#x27;s own viewpoint.

==Critical reception==
Though the film had a large box-office take, its cost kept it from being a success, and Wayne lost his personal investment. He sold his rights to United Artists, which had released it, and it made back its money.

Critical response was mixed, from the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;″s four-star &quot;a magnificent job... Visually and dramatically, &quot;The Alamo&quot; is top-flight&quot; to &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;flat as Texas&quot;.

At the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a score of 55% from 22 reviews. The consensus summarizes: &quot;John Wayne proves to be less compelling behind the camera than he is before it in &quot;The Alamo&quot;, a blustery dramatization of the fort&#x27;s last stand that feels more like a first draft.&quot;

Wayne provided a clip of the film for use in &quot;How the West Was Won&quot;. Despite being anachronistic (&quot;How the West Was Won&quot; begins in 1839 and the Alamo fell in 1836), the clip occurs right before the second segment, The Plains, as Spencer Tracy narrates the events that led to the United States gaining large amounts of territory from the Mexican-American War.

===Awards and honors===
&quot;The Alamo&quot; was nominated for seven Academy Awards (winning for Best Sound). Its successful bid for several Oscar nominations over such films as &quot;Psycho&quot; (which received four nominations) and &quot;Spartacus&quot; (which received six) was largely due to intense lobbying by producer John Wayne.

The film is thought to have been denied awards because Academy voters were alienated by an overblown publicity campaign. Chill Wills&#x27; campaign for the Best Supporting Actor award was considered tasteless by many, including Wayne, who publicly apologized for Wills. Wills took out an advertisement in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; claiming that &quot;We of the Alamo cast are praying harder - than the real Texans prayed for their lives in the Alamo - for Chill Wills to win the Oscar&quot;. Wayne took out his own advertisement calling the claim &quot;untrue and reprehensible&quot; and that he was sure that Wills&#x27; &quot;intentions were not as bad as his taste&quot;. Wills&#x27; publicity agent, W.S. &quot;Bow-Wow&quot; Wojciechowicz, accepted blame for the ill-advised effort, claiming that Wills had known nothing about it.

In response to Wills&#x27;s ad, claiming that all the voters were his &quot;Alamo Cousins&quot;, Groucho Marx took out a small ad which simply said &quot;Dear Mr. Wills, I am delighted to be your cousin, but I voted for Sal Mineo&quot; (Wills&#x27;s rival nominee for &quot;Exodus&quot;).
==Alternate versions==
&quot;The Alamo&quot; premiered at its 70 mm roadshow length of 202 minutes, including overture, intermission, and exit music, but the negative was severely cut for wide release. UA re-edited it to 167 minutes. The 202-minute version was believed lost until Bob Bryden, a Canadian fan, realized he had seen the full version in the 1970s. He and Alamo collector Ashley Ward discovered the last known surviving print of the 70 mm premiere version in Toronto, in pristine condition. MGM (UA&#x27;s sister studio) used this print to make a digital video transfer of the roadshow version for VHS and LaserDisc release.

The print was taken apart and deteriorated in storage. By 2007, it was unavailable in any useful form. MGM used the shorter, general release version for subsequent DVD releases. At present, the only existing version of the original uncut roadshow release is on standard definition 480i digital video. It is the source for broadcasts on Turner Classic Movies. The best available actual film elements are of the 35 mm negatives of the general release version.

A restoration of the deteriorating print found in Toronto, supervised by Robert A. Harris, was envisaged but to date is not underway. The endangered version is the 70 mm uncut roadshow version (202 min). The cut 167-minute version still exists in decent condition in 35 mm.

In 2014, an Internet campaign was formed urging MGM to restore &quot;The Alamo&quot; from the deteriorating 70 mm elements. This garnered some publicity from KENS-TV in San Antonio, and attention from filmmakers such as: J.J. Abrams, Matt Reeves, Rian Johnson, Guillermo del Toro, Alfonso Cuarón and Alejandro González Iñárritu. In his 2014 biography of Wayne, &quot;John Wayne: The Life and Legend&quot; author Scott Eyman states that the full-length Toronto print has deteriorated to the point where it is now unusable.

<text>Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy is a compilation album of singles by English rock band the Who, released in 1971 as Track 2406 006 in the UK and as Decca DL 79184 in the US. It entered the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart on 20 November 1971, peaking at number 11, and the UK chart on 3 December 1971, peaking at number 9.

==Background==
&quot;Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy&quot; was compiled by Pete Townshend. The band&#x27;s manager Kit Lambert attempted to have the track order changed but failed because too many copies had already been pressed. The UK release was held up because the Who and their other manager Bill Curbishley had failed to clear it with Lambert.

Several songs on the album had previously been released on studio albums. The Who&#x27;s debut &quot;My Generation&quot; included the tracks &quot;A Legal Matter&quot; and &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot;; &quot;A Quick One&quot; included &quot;Boris the Spider&quot;, the one song written by John Entwistle, and in its American configuration &quot;Happy Jack.&quot; &quot;I Can See for Miles&quot; appeared on &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot;, and &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot; on &quot;Tommy&quot;. &quot;Pictures of Lily&quot; and &quot;Magic Bus&quot; previously appeared on the US compilation album &quot;Magic Bus: The Who on Tour&quot;. 

Aside from two songs, &quot;Boris the Spider&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m a Boy&quot;, every track on the album had been released as a single in the UK; further, all except &quot;A Legal Matter&quot;, &quot;Magic Bus&quot;, and &quot;The Seeker&quot; were top ten hits. &quot;Happy Jack&quot;, &quot;I Can See for Miles&quot;, &quot;Magic Bus&quot;, and &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot; had also been Top 40 hits in the US. &quot;I&#x27;m a Boy&quot; is represented by an alternate longer and slower version that was recorded three months after the original single release. Most of the tracks on this album would appear in subsequent compilations.

==Packaging==
The album is named after the members of the band: &quot;Meaty&quot; is Daltrey, who was quite fit at the time; &quot;Beaty&quot; is Moon, for his drumming; &quot;Big&quot; is Entwistle, who was a large person, often referred to as &quot;The Ox&quot; (lending his nickname to the instrumental of the same name); and &quot;Bouncy&quot; was Townshend, who jumped about quite acrobatically during performances. The album&#x27;s original title was &quot;The Who Looks Back&quot;.

On the front cover the Who are looking at four children, one of whom is Curbishley&#x27;s younger brother Paul. The panoramic photograph featured on the inside cover of the gatefold vinyl packaging is an exterior shot of the side of the Railway Hotel, a pub that was sited on the bridge next to Harrow &amp; Wealdstone station in north-west London. The Railway Hotel was a popular hangout for Mods and the Who became a regular attraction there from June 1964, shortly after Keith Moon joined the band, performing every Tuesday night. It was here that Kit Lambert, their manager, first saw the band, and here that Pete Townshend accidentally cracked his guitar&#x27;s neck on the low ceiling above the stage. In response to laughter from the crowd, he then smashed his guitar for the first time in public, a gimmick he maintained for many years when playing live. The band were filmed at the venue on 11 August – a copy of the recording turning up in 2002. The hotel was destroyed by fire in March 2000, after becoming empty and vandalised. The site is now occupied by blocks of flats where the buildings, such as Moon House and Daltrey House, are named after the band members.

== Critical reception ==
Robert Christgau remarked that &quot;In England, this is a greatest hits album [but] in the U.S., where some of these songs have never been released and most have never made the charts, it&#x27;s a mishmash revelation&quot;. Dave Marsh, however, greeted the collection as a disappointment for true fans because Townshend had publicly promised a rich, surprising, and comprehensive collection. Noting that less than half the tracks were new to the U.S. in any way, Marsh wrote somewhat bitterly on the predictable &quot;greatest hits&quot; nature of the tracklist: &quot;&quot;Meaty Beaty&quot; isn&#x27;t half what it pretends to be, nor is it anywhere near what it COULD have been. It&#x27;s not the album we dreamed about, Peter, but since there&#x27;s so much other stuff lying around unissued, do you think you could try it again?&quot; At the time there were many rarities in the Who catalog – B-sides, demos, and other tracks that were UK-only, live, or previously unreleased – and Marsh complained, &quot;Why reissue things for the second (third) time on an album when you have such an incredible backlog of material?&quot; In 1987, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it number 99 on their list of the 100 best albums of the period 1967–1987.

<text>The Ahwahnechee, Awani, or Awalache were an Indigenous people of California who historically lived in the Yosemite Valley. They were a band of Mono and Miwok People.

The Awani people&#x27;s heritage can be found all over Yosemite National Park.

== Name ==
The name &quot;Awani&quot; was also the name of their primary village. The anglicizations of their name from the 19th century have included Ahwahnechee (by Hittell in 1868), Awalache (by Johnston in 1851), Awallache (by McKee in 1851), and Awanee (by Powers in 1874).

== Language ==
They spoke Mono and Southern Sierra Miwok.

==History==
The Awani lived in Yosemite Valley for centuries. It is believed that they may have lived in the area for as long as 7,000 years. They were primarily Mono, and bordered on the north, south and west by various Miwok tribes. They routinely traded with the Paiute tribe across the mountains to the east.

=== Initial contacts ===
European-American contact began after 1833. In 1850 a settler named James D. Savage set up a mining camp down below the valley, and spent most of his time mining for gold and trading with the few other white men in the area. He took several Indian wives and developed influential relations with the nearby Native people. Later that year, Savage&#x27;s camp and post were attacked by the Ahwahnechee. Savage had moved into the Ahwahnechee land and effectively disrupted the lives of every Ahwahnechee. The Ahwahnechee raided his supplies, and killed two of his men. This, in turn, sparked the Mariposa Indian War of 1850 to 1851. In 1851, during the Mariposa War, California State Militia troops of the Mariposa Battalion burned Ahwahnechee villages and took their food stores. 

The state militia with Savage as their major and the Indian Commissioners from Washington were called out to either convince or force the Native people to sign treaties. Six tribes made agreements with the government to accept reservation land further down into the foothills. One of the tribes that refused to meet was the Ahwahnechees. When the soldiers, led by Savage, moved towards their camp to force them out, their chief, Teneiya, finally appeared alone and attempted to conceal the location and number of his people. Major Savage told Teneiya that he would travel to the valley to find his people. Chief Teneiya said that he would go back and return with his tribe. When the chief appeared again Savage noticed that there were very few of the Native people present. He asked the chief where the rest of his people were, and Teneiya denied having any more people than were there at the moment. Savage was convinced that if he found the rest of the tribe he could persuade them to come with him back to the negotiations. The Major took some men with him to the north through the mountains and came upon the valley. This was the first entry into Yosemite Valley by any white men. Camping that night the men debated what to call the valley they had just discovered. They agreed upon the name that the white men had already called the tribe, Yosemite. The date was March 25, 1851.
Once they reached the village of Teneiya&#x27;s people a search was made but no more Indians were found there or in the valley at all. The soldiers returned to the meeting place but Chief Teneiya and the part of the tribe that was already in their custody escaped and returned to the mountains.

That May, a second expedition of militia traveled north to capture the old chief and his band once and for all. Only a few warriors, among them two of Chief Teneiya&#x27;s sons, were found. The chief was eventually brought in to find that his sons had been shot for trying to escape. Within a few days the chief also tried to escape by jumping into the river.

With the recapture of Chief Teneiya the rest of the band was easily found and brought to the Fresno reservation in the foothills where they stayed long enough to regain their strength and petitioned for their freedom to return to their mountain home. This was granted and they returned to their secluded valley of &quot;Ahwahnee&quot;.

In 1852, a Mariposa expedition of US federal troops heard a report that Ahwahnechee Indians killed two European-American miners at Bridalveil Meadows. Soldiers were again dispatched and the troops executed five Ahwahnechee men. Later, the tribe fled over the mountains to shelter with a neighboring people, the Mono tribe. They stayed the year and then returned to their native valley taking with them horses stolen from the hospitable Monos who soon followed seeking revenge, killing Chief Teneiya and all but eight of the young braves and taking all the women and children captive.

=== Later history ===
Chief Teneiya (d. 1853) was a leader in Yosemite Valley. His father was Ahwahnechee. He led his band away from Yosemite to settle with Paiutes in eastern California. Tenaya has descendants living today.

The U.S. federal government evicted Yosemite Native people from the park in 1851, 1906, 1929, and 1969.

Jay Johnson of the Mariposa Indian Council identifies as an Ahwahnechee descendent.

==Plant use==
The Ahwahneechee burned undergrowth in the Valley to protect the oak trees. Acorns were a central staple of their diet, Black oak acorns providing almost 60% of it. The acorns were laid on a slab of rock in the sun to dry. Then they were ground up in small holes atop big granite slabs known as grinding rocks, like a mortar and pestle. Once they had been sufficiently ground down to a fine powder, the acorn flour was put into a shallow depression at the edge of the river. This depression was lined with leaves to keep the acorn powder from being lost in the sand. The flour was then rinsed to remove toxins, making it palatable. Once rinsed and edible, the flour was placed into willow cooking baskets with fresh water. Rocks were heated in a fire and placed in the basket to cook the mixture, which was then consumed either as a mush or baked into a flatbread.

National Park Service naturalist, Will Neely created a list of the plants commonly used by the Ahwahnechee. Black oak, sugar pine, western juniper, canyon live oak, interior live oak, foothill pine, buckeye, pinyon pine nuts provided acorns and seeds for food. Other plants provided smaller seeds. Mariposa tulip, golden brodiaea, common camas, squaw root, and Bolander&#x27;s yampah provided edible bulbs and roots. Greens eaten by the Ahwahnechee included broad-leaved lupine, common monkey flower, nude buckwheat, California thistle, miner&#x27;s lettuce, sorrel, clover, umbrella plant, crimson columbine, and alum root. Strawberry, blackberry, raspberry, thimbleberry, wild grape, gooseberry, currant, blue elderberry, western choke cherry, Sierra plum, and greenleaf manzanita provided berries and fruits.

The Ahwahnechee brewed drinks from whiteleaf manzanita and western juniper. Commonly used medicine plants included Yerba santa, yarrow, giant hyssop, Brewer&#x27;s angelica, sagebrush, showy milkweed, mountain dogbane, balsamroot, California barberry, fleabane, mint, knotweed, the California wildrose, meadow goldenrod, mule ears, pearly everlasting, and the California laurel.

The tribe used soap plant and meadow rue to make soap. They used fibers from Mountain dogbane, showy milkweed, wild grape, and soap plant for cordage.

Baskets were woven from splints of American dogwood, big-leaf maple, buckbrush, deer brush, willow, and California hazelnut Additional bracken fern would add black colors to the basket and redbud would provide red.

The tribe made bows from incense-cedar, and Pacific dogwood. They built homes from Incense-cedar.

== Architecture ==

The Awani people historically camped at the bottom of the valley, in small houses known as &quot;o-chum&quot;. These small homes were built with pine for the framing and supports, using the wood in a tipi-like structure with a diameter of about 12 feet. To insulate their homes, they covered pine poles with cedar bark to create a sturdy and durable shelter. An o-chum had two openings: an entrance at front and smokehole at its pinnacle

A small fire was built in the colder months for warmth. A family of about six could live in an o-chum. Pelts of small animals made bedding. Hides of bear or deer were used as mattresses. The blanket was - like the bedding - made from the skins of the smaller animals, cut into strips, and woven together for extra warmth.

Another sort of building that the Awani often used was a sweat house. These structures were somewhat similar to the o-chum, only with a rounded roof, as opposed to a pointed roof, and covered with mud. Young hunters used sweat houses before they went on a trip, to rid their bodies of the human smell that could betray their presence to the prey. Sweats also provided the men with a way to relax and cleanse themselves for religious and health purposes.

==Hunting==
The Awani historically hunted a range of animals, particularly deer.

==Ahwahnechee place names==

Some Ahwahnechee tribal names for areas around Yosemite Valley include the following:

* Ahwahne: Yosemite Valley
* Tesa&#x27;ak (Teh-sa-ahk&#x27;): Half Dome (South Dome) - name of a Mono woman for whom Half Dome was named. Half Dome resembled a Mono woman&#x27;s head and shoulder because they traditionally bobbed their hair and had bangs. The dark vertical dripping stripes of lichens resembled tear stains, and her tears were said to form Mirror Lake.
* Loya: Sentinel Rock
* Tutocanula or Tool-tock Awn-oo-lah: El Capitan
* Ahwayee: Mirror Lake
* Patillima or Ernating Lawootoo: Glacier Point
* Pohono: Bridalveil Fall
* Piwyack: Tenaya Lake
* Yonapah: Vernal Fall
* Yowihe: Nevada Fall
* Chookoneh: Royal Arches (Yosemite)
* Tokoyee: North Dome
* Wakalmata: Merced River
* Tahachee: Indian Canyon
* Yayan: Cascade Falls
* Yawachkee: Yosemite Museum - name of village where museum is currently located
* Mahtah: Liberty Cap
=== Villages ===
Nine Ahwahnechee villages in Yosemite Valley housed 450 Indigenous residents when Euro-American settlers first arrived. These villages were Awani, Hokokwito, Kumaini, Lesamaiti, Macheto, Notomidula, Sakaya, and Wahak.
The principal village, and by extension the whole Yosemite Valley, was Awani.

== Namesakes ==
The Ahwahnee Hotel and Ahwahneechee Village, a recreated 19th-century tribal village in Yosemite Valley, are both named for the tribe, as are the Ahwahnee Heritage Days, Ahwahnee, California, and Ahwahnee Estates, California.

== Descendants ==
Contemporary groups connected to the Ahwahneechee include the American Indian Council of Mariposa County, Inc. (or Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation), the Mono Lake Kootzaduka&#x27;a, and the following federally recognized tribes:
* Bishop Paiute Tribe
* Bridgeport Indian Colony
* Northfork Rancheria of Mono Indians of California
* Picayune Rancheria of Chukchansi Indians
* Tuolumne Band of Me-Wuk Indians.

An unrecognized tribe, the Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation is actively petitioning the U.S. Department of the Interior for federal recognition. The Bureau of Indian Affairs submitted a preliminary finding against federal recognition for the group in 2018. The Mono Lake Kootzaduka&#x27;a Tribe are also unrecognized.

<text>Rupert Neville Hine (21 September 1947 – 4 June 2020) was an English record producer and musician. He produced albums for artists including Rush, Kevin Ayers, Tina Turner, Howard Jones, Saga, the Fixx, Bob Geldof, Thompson Twins, Stevie Nicks, Chris de Burgh, Suzanne Vega, Underworld, Duncan Sheik, Formula and Eleanor McEvoy. Additionally, Hine recorded eleven albums, including those billed under his own name, the pseudo-band name Thinkman, and as a member of the band Quantum Jump; with the latter, he achieved a number 5 hit on the UK Singles Chart in 1979, &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;. Additionally, he composed for film and television soundtracks, including the 1989 Ian Fleming biopic &quot;Goldeneye&quot; and the black comedy &quot;Better Off Dead&quot;.

==Early life==

Hine was born in Wimbledon, London on 21 September 1947. He was the son of Maurice, a timber merchant, and Joan (née Harris), a Red Cross nurse. He grew up in a house full of music; his mother was an amateur ballet dancer and his father an amateur musician who also played drums in a jazz band when he was young. Hine&#x27;s mother was convinced he would be an architect, but Hine&#x27;s early ambition was to become a cartographer. Hine started playing in the school band at age 14 and played the mouth organ, mostly because it was the cheapest instrument to buy. He attended St John&#x27;s school in Horsham, West Sussex, before he came to King&#x27;s College School in Wimbledon. He was musically self-taught.

== Career ==
In the early 1960s, Hine formed half of the folk duo Rupert &amp; David with David MacIver. The duo performed in pubs and clubs and occasionally shared the stage with a then-unknown Paul Simon. The duo&#x27;s one released single (on the Decca label in 1965) was a cover of Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot;. The single was not a success, but was notable for featuring a young Jimmy Page on guitar and Herbie Flowers on bass. For several years Hine wrote songs with MacIver while working at temporary jobs, until he was helped by Deep Purple&#x27;s bassist Roger Glover, whom Hine knew from Glover&#x27;s previous band Episode 6. Hine and MacIver were signed to Deep Purple&#x27;s Purple label. Glover produced Hine&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Pick Up a Bone&quot; (1971). &quot;Unfinished Picture&quot; (1973) followed, but neither album was successful. However, Hine now became increasingly in demand as an independent producer, first with the 1972 single &quot;Who Is the Doctor&quot;, featuring Jon Pertwee narrating over the theme music from TV&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. He then produced Yvonne Elliman&#x27;s album &quot;Food of Love&quot; (1973), a second world war-themed compilation album called &quot;Colditz&quot; (1973), and Kevin Ayers&#x27;s &quot;The Confessions of Dr Dream and Other Stories&quot; (1974).

In 1973, Hine, along with guitarist Mark Warner, bassist John G. Perry (then of Caravan) and drummer Trevor Morais (formerly of The Peddlers) formed the band Quantum Jump, releasing two albums, &quot;Quantum Jump&quot; (1976) and &quot;Barracuda&quot; (1977). After the re-release of the single &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; (from &quot;Quantum Jump&quot;) became an unexpected UK Top five hit in 1979, a third album – &quot;Mixing&quot;, a reworking of tracks selected from the first two Quantum Jump albums – was released.

After Quantum Jump disbanded, Hine released a trilogy of albums under his own name, including &quot;Immunity&quot; (1981); &quot;Waving Not Drowning&quot; (1982); and &quot;The Wildest Wish to Fly&quot; (1983). The American release of &quot;Wildest Wish&quot; dropped two tracks, radically reworked two others and incorporated two tracks from 1981&#x27;s &quot;Immunity&quot; – including &quot;Misplaced Love&quot;, which featured a guest vocal by Marianne Faithfull and had been a minor hit in Australia, reaching number 14 on the chart. In 1985, Hine wrote and produced much of the soundtrack for the black comedy film &quot;Better Off Dead&quot;. Later he and composer Eric Serra wrote &quot;The Experience of Love&quot;, the end title song for &quot;GoldenEye&quot;. His film soundtrack credits also include &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; (composed by Serra), and &quot;The Addams Family&quot;.

Hine obtained a number of credits with some of the biggest musicians of his era. In 1984, he topped the UK Albums Chart with Howard Jones&#x27; debut album, &quot;Human&#x27;s Lib&quot;, and that same year enjoyed his most high-profile achievement with his work on Tina Turner&#x27;s album &quot;Private Dancer&quot;, which established Turner as a solo star and sold 20 million copies. Hine produced the Grammy-winning single &quot;Better Be Good to Me&quot; as well as co-writing &quot;I Might Have Been Queen&quot;.

In 1986, he created a solo project called Thinkman with a set of actors for stage performance. There were three albums released under this project: &quot;The Formula&quot; (1986), &quot;Life is a Full Time Occupation&quot; (1988), and &quot;Hard Hat Zone&quot; (1990). Thinkman is credited for one song on the &quot;Better Off Dead&quot; soundtrack, while Hine is credited for six.

In 1990, Hine and Kevin Godley worked together on the project &quot;One World One Voice&quot;, a musical chain letter that travelled the world starting with Sting and Afrika Bambaataa in New York and ending 300 artists/musicians later, in Moscow. It was an environmental awareness album, and a two-hour television program, broadcast the same day to 650 million people worldwide.

In 1993, he joined with guitarist Phil Palmer, Paul Carrack, Steve Ferrone and Tony Levin to form the band Spin 1ne 2wo. The group released a self-titled project, made up of rock covers of songs by artists including Jimi Hendrix, The Who, Led Zeppelin, Blind Faith, Steely Dan and Bob Dylan. In 1994, Hine released &quot;The Deep End&quot;. In 2008, Hine oversaw the direction of the compilation album &quot;Songs for Tibet: The Art of Peace&quot;, and also contributed to it a remixed version of his song, &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot; (from &quot;The Deep End&quot;). In 2008, during the Beijing Olympics, the album was iTunes third most downloaded around the globe. Hine wrote two songs for &quot;Le Cheshire Cat et moi&quot;, a 2009 CD by Nolwenn Leroy which was produced by Teitur Lassen.

In 2011, Hine launched Auditorius, a joint music publishing project with BMG Rights Management. In November of the same year, following a glowing citation from Bob Geldof, Hine was honoured by the APRS with a Sound Fellowship Award; presented to recognise special contributions to the &#x27;Art, Science and Business of Recording&#x27;. Hine joined Joe Boyd, Clive Green, Bob Ludwig, Jimmy Page and Chris Thomas to receive the award from Sir George Martin, APRS President, who together with a group of past recipients; sound and music innovators, including Sir Paul McCartney, Peter Gabriel, Chris Blackwell, also holds a Fellowship Award.

In March 2015, Esoteric Recordings (part of Cherry Red Records) issued &quot;Unshy on the Skyline&quot;, a compilation from a trio of albums Hine made between 1981 and 1983, &quot;Immunity&quot;, &quot;Waving Not Drowning&quot; and &quot;The Wildest Wish to Fly&quot;, complemented by the lyrics of poet and artist Jeannette-Thérèse Obstoj, and featuring guest contributions from musicians Robert Palmer, Phil Collins and guitarist Phil Palmer. The album has been re-mastered by sound engineer Stephen W Tayler, who had recorded, mixed and co-produced the original albums. To recognise the Dalai Lama&#x27;s 80th birthday in July 2015, the Art of Peace Foundation commissioned Hine to produce &quot;Songs for Tibet II&quot;, to celebrate and honour the Dalai Lama&#x27;s vision. A follow-up to the Grammy-nominated &quot;Songs for Tibet&quot; that Hine produced in 2008, artist contributions came from Sting, Peter Gabriel, Lorde, Kate Bush, Elbow, Duncan Sheik, Howard Jones, The Family Crest, Ed Prosek, Of Monsters and Men, Bob Geldof, Crystal Method, Rival Sons, Eleanor McEvoy and Hine himself.

In 2017, Hine was appointed Chairman of the Ivor Novello Awards, presented annually by The Ivors Academy (formerly the BASCA).

On 30 August 2019, Esoteric Recordings (part of Cherry Red Records) issued &quot;Fighting Apathy With Shock&quot;, a &quot;best of&quot; chosen by Hine from his Thinkman project, the albums &quot;The Formula&quot; (1986), &quot;Life Is A Full Time Occupation&quot; (1988) and &quot;Hard Hat Zone&quot; (1990) all with lyrics by Jeannette Obstöj (1949-2015). Re-mastering of the collection is by Stephen W Tayler who co-produced the original albums. Although Hine performed nearly all the music himself, there are contributions from The Fixx&#x27;s Jamie West-Oram, Stewart Copeland of The Police and Café Jacques&#x27; vocalist Chris Thomson.

Tina Turner, Stevie Nicks, Wilson Phillips and Dusty Springfield are among the artists who have recorded Hine&#x27;s songs. Hine has also directed videos for the artists he has produced. He was an early adopter of electronic music production techniques, and Hine was a founding member of Music Producers Guild, the International MIDI Association and a member of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences in the US. He has sat on the boards of committees for BASCA and the Ivors Academy.

Hine had quadruple bypass surgery in 2010 and was diagnosed with renal cancer the following year. He died at his home in Wiltshire on 4 June 2020 at the age of 72. He is survived by his wife Fay and his son Kingsley from a previous marriage.

At a London reception on September 20, 2023, Rupert was posthumously honoured by Ivors Academy with an award recognising &#x27;exceptional people across the music industry who create positive change and champion music creators&#x27;. The inaugural Ivors Honour, also presented to Carla Marie Williams, Crispin Hunt and Kevin Brennan MP, replaces BASCA&#x27;s Gold Badge Awards, last presented in 2019.
