<text>The Singapore People&#x27;s Party (abbreviation: SPP) is an opposition political party in Singapore.

==History==
SPP was founded on 21 November 1994 by Sin Kek Tong, who led a pro-Chiam See Tong faction out of the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP). Over two years, Sin stood as the pro-tem leader until Chiam joined the party and assumed leadership in December 1996, at the time the Parliament was dissolved ahead of the 1997 general election. Chiam then became the party&#x27;s first Member of Parliament (MP) when he won the constituency of Potong Pasir at the election, where he also did under the SDP banner.

===Membership of the Singapore Democratic Alliance===
In 2001, the SPP became a founding member of the Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA), along with the National Solidarity Party (NSP), the Singapore Justice Party (SJP) and the Singapore Malay National Organisation (PKMS). Chiam became the founding Chairman of SDA, which aimed to provide a common grouping under which different opposition parties could stand as a political coalition in elections against the ruling People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP).

At the 2001 general election, Chiam See Tong was returned to Parliament as MP for Potong Pasir. Though Chiam was the only SDA member to win an elected seat in Parliament, he was joined in Parliament by SDA member Steve Chia (then-leader of the National Solidarity Party) who became a non-constituency MP after securing 34.6% of the votes in the constituency of Chua Chu Kang, which was the highest percentage of the vote secured by a losing opposition candidate at the election. The result made Chiam the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the opposition in Parliament, as the SDA had two representatives (Chiam and Chia), whereas the only other opposition party represented in Parliament (the Workers&#x27; Party) had only one (Hougang MP Low Thia Khiang).

At the 2006 general election, Chiam See Tong was again re-elected as MP for Potong Pasir. However, the SDA did not win any other seats. Steve Chia lost his position as a non-constituency MP. Though Chia increased his share of the vote in Chua Chu Kang to 39.63%, this was lower than the 43.9% gained by the Workers&#x27; Party in Aljunied GRC. The role of &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the opposition in Parliament therefore passed from Chiam to Low, the Workers&#x27; Party leader.

===Withdrawal from the Singapore Democratic Alliance===
The NSP withdrew from the SDA in 2007, but the SPP remained in the alliance with the SJP and PKMS.

In 2010, Chiam tried to bring the Reform Party into the SDA. He reportedly accepted the conditions the RRP set out for joining the alliance, but the terms of entry were opposed by other members of the Central Executive Committee (CEC) who blocked the move. Chiam also suffered a mild stroke in 2008, following which he had to cut back on some of his political activities. This led some CEC members to question whether he was able to properly fulfill his role of Chairman of the alliance.

On 28 February 2011, the CEC voted to relieve Chiam of his role as chairman, however, the CEC stressed that they still hoped to field Chiam as a candidate at the next general election. Chiam had earlier announced his intention to stand in a Group Representation Constituency while leaving the Potong Pasir Single Member Constituency to a successor at the next general election. Two days later, Chiam announced that the party would be withdrawing from the SDA and that he would stand under the banner of the SPP instead of the SDA at the next general election. Due to the withdrawal, Chiam&#x27;s chairman role was succeeded to Desmond Lim, the leader of SJP.

At the elections, Chiam announced that he led his team to contest the Bishan-Toa Payoh Group Representation Constituency, leaving his Potong Pasir ward to his wife, Lina Loh Woon Lee (Lina Chiam). This was Loh&#x27;s debut in politics, although she had tirelessly campaigned with her husband over the years in many general elections in Singapore, including Cairnhill and Potong Pasir constituencies. Chairman Sin was also fielded to contest the newly-formed Hong Kah North SMC, a ward which was formerly part of the Hong Kah GRC (now Chua Chu Kang GRC).

After the polling day, the party was defeated in all the constituencies contested, including Potong Pasir which was reclaimed by the PAP for the first time since 1984; consequently, Chiam&#x27;s defeat ended his 27-year tenure in Parliament. However, Loh was offered a post for the Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) as a result of being the best performing opposition candidate (amongst unelected candidates) after narrowly losing the election 49.64% to the PAP&#x27;s Sitoh Yih Pin&#x27;s 50.36% (a margin of 114 votes).

In overall terms, the SPP managed to clinch 41.42% (62,504 votes) of the total number of votes in the constituencies that it contested.

===2015 General Elections===
Ahead of the 2015 elections (due to be held 11 September), Chiam announced that he would not stand as a candidate for the elections, for the first time since his debut in 1976. Another opposition party, the Democratic Progressive Party, who led by Benjamin Pwee and Hamin Aliyas, joined SPP to strengthen its team contesting Bishan–Toa Payoh GRC. New candidate Ravi Philemon replaced Chairman Sin as candidate for Hong Kah North, while Lina Chiam contested again in Potong Pasir. Former NSP member Jeannette Chong-Aruldoss joined the party prior, and contested Mountbatten SMC just as Chong did in the 2011 elections.

However, the absence of Chiam in the election saw their party suffered another major setback, not only did the party fail to win a parliamentary seat, their scores were overseen by large swings towards the PAP, one of which was Potong Pasir, where Lina Chiam managed to secure only 33.59% of the valid votes, down from 49.64%. Comparing to the Workers&#x27; Party&#x27;s performances (of East Coast GRC, Fengshan SMC and Punggol East SMC), this was not enough for Chiam to secure her NCMP seat for a second term, thus ending their party presence in Parliament since the party foundation. In terms of the party&#x27;s overall vote, they garnered only 27.08% of the votes cast, a swing of -14.34% from the previous election.

On 1 March 2017, the party reported that former party&#x27;s chairman Sin died from prostate cancer two days ago.

In January 2018, it was reported that Jose Raymond, a former Press Secretary to Vivian Balakrishnan (who also served as Chief Executive of the Singapore Environment Council and current Minister of Foreign Affairs), had joined the SPP. Also in the same year, WP&#x27;s Low Thia Khiang surpassed Chiam as the longest-serving opposition MP, having served in Parliament since 1991.

===Leadership Transition and 2020 elections===
On 4 September 2019, Chiam announced that he would step down from the secretary-general post due to declining health and Lina Chiam would step down from the chairman post, while the party&#x27;s Facebook page posted that they would electing a new leader by 16 October on a biennial Ordinary Party Conference, among which Jeannette Chong-Aruldoss would be stepping down from the party&#x27;s Central Executive Committee (CEC). Chiam stepped down on 16 October 2019, with four new faces elected into the Central Executive Committee. On 5 November 2019, Steve Chia was elected as the new Secretary-General of the Singapore People&#x27;s Party, along with Jose Raymond as Chairman.

On the election day on 10 July, the party failed to make headways for the third consecutive election as the party lost to the PAP on both of the two constituencies they contested (Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC and Potong Pasir SMC) despite seeing a small anti-PAP vote swing. Their party improved their party&#x27;s overall vote to 33.83%, but their overall popular vote fell to 1.52%.

On 22 December 2020, SPP Chairman Jose Raymond announced that he was retiring from politics, while revealing that the Assistant Secretary-General, Ariffin Sha, resigned from the party in August. Vice-Chairman Williiamson Lee became Acting Chairman, while Ariffin&#x27;s position was not filled. The SPP CEC accepted the resignations on 17 January 2021 and co-opted Khan Osman Sulaiman and Melvyn Chiu.

<doc id="1344392" wikidata="Q1972137" url="?curid=1344392" title="Fact table">
<text>In data warehousing, a fact table consists of the measurements, metrics or facts of a business process. It is located at the center of a star schema or a snowflake schema surrounded by dimension tables. Where multiple fact tables are used, these are arranged as a fact constellation schema. A fact table typically has two types of columns: those that contain facts and those that are a foreign key to dimension tables. The primary key of a fact table is usually a composite key that is made up of all of its foreign keys. Fact tables contain the content of the data warehouse and store different types of measures like additive, non-additive, and semi-additive measures.

Fact tables provide the (usually) additive values that act as independent variables by which dimensional attributes are analyzed. Fact tables are often defined by their grain. The grain of a fact table represents the most atomic level by which the facts may be defined. The grain of a sales fact table might be stated as &quot;sales volume by day by product by store&quot;. Each record in this fact table is therefore uniquely defined by a day, product, and store. Other dimensions might be members of this fact table (such as location/region) but these add nothing to the uniqueness of the fact records. These &quot;affiliate dimensions&quot; allow for additional slices of the independent facts but generally provide insights at a higher level of aggregation (a region contains many stores).

==Example==
If the business process is sales, then the corresponding fact table will typically contain columns representing both raw facts and aggregations in rows such as:
* &quot;$12,000&quot;, being &quot;sales for New York store for 15-Jan-2005&quot;.
* &quot;$34,000&quot;, being &quot;sales for Los Angeles store for 15-Jan-2005&quot;
* &quot;$22,000&quot;, being &quot;sales for New York store for 16-Jan-2005&quot;
* &quot;$21,000&quot;, being &quot;average daily sales for Los Angeles Store for Jan-2005&quot;
* &quot;$65,000&quot;, being &quot;average daily sales for Los Angeles Store for Feb-2005&quot;
* &quot;$33,000&quot;, being &quot;average daily sales for Los Angeles Store for year 2005&quot;
&quot;Average daily sales&quot; is a measurement that is stored in the fact table. The fact table also contains foreign keys from the dimension tables, where time series (e.g. dates) and other dimensions (e.g. store location, salesperson, product) are stored.

All foreign keys between fact and dimension tables should be surrogate keys, not reused keys from operational data.

==Measure types==
* Additive – measures that can be added across any dimension.
* Non-additive – measures that cannot be added across any dimension.
* Semi-additive – measures that can be added across some dimensions.

A fact table might contain either detail-level facts or facts that have been aggregated (fact tables that contain aggregated facts are often instead called summary tables).

Special care must be taken when handling ratios and percentages. One good design rule is to never store percentages or ratios in fact tables but only calculate these in the data access tool. Thus, only store the numerator and denominator in the fact table, which then can be aggregated, and the aggregated stored values can then be used for calculating the ratio or percentage in the data access tool.

In the real world, it is possible to have a fact table that contains no measures or facts. These tables are called &quot;factless fact tables&quot;, or &quot;junction tables&quot;.

The &quot;factless fact tables&quot; may be used for modeling many-to-many relationships or for capturing timestamps of events.

==Types of fact tables==
There are four fundamental measurement events, which characterize all fact tables.
; Transactional
:A transactional table is the most basic and fundamental. The grain associated with a transactional fact table is usually specified as &quot;one row per line in a transaction&quot;, e.g., every line on a receipt. Typically a transactional fact table holds data of the most detailed level, causing it to have a great number of dimensions associated with it.
; Periodic snapshots
:The periodic snapshot, as the name implies, takes a &quot;picture of the moment&quot;, where the moment could be any defined period of time, e.g. a performance summary of a salesman over the previous month. A periodic snapshot table is dependent on the transactional table, as it needs the detailed data held in the transactional fact table in order to deliver the chosen performance output.
; Accumulating snapshots
:This type of fact table is used to show the activity of a process that has a well-defined beginning and end, e.g., the processing of an order. An order moves through specific steps until it is fully processed. As steps towards fulfilling the order are completed, the associated row in the fact table is updated. An accumulating snapshot table often has multiple date columns, each representing a milestone in the process. Therefore, it&#x27;s important to have an entry in the associated date dimension that represents a placeholder for an unknown date, as many of the milestone dates are unknown at the time of the creation of the row.
; Temporal snapshots
:By applying temporal database theory and modeling techniques the &quot;temporal snapshot fact table&quot; allows to have the equivalent of daily snapshots without really having daily snapshots. It introduces the concept of time Intervals into a fact table, allowing saving a lot of space, optimizing performances while allowing the end user to have the logical equivalent of the &quot;picture of the moment&quot; they are interested in.

==Steps in designing a fact table==
* Identify a business process for analysis (e.g., sales).
* Identify measures of facts (sales dollar), by asking questions like &#x27;what number of X are relevant for the business process?&#x27;, replacing the X with various options that make sense within the context of the business.
* Identify dimensions for facts (product dimension, location dimension, time dimension, organization dimension), by asking questions that make sense within the context of the business, like &#x27;analyze by X&#x27;, where X is replaced with the subject to test.
* List the columns that describe each dimension (region name, branch name, business unit name).
* Determine the lowest level (granularity) of summary in a fact table (e.g. sales dollars).

An alternative approach is the four-step design process described in Kimball: select the business process, declare the grain, identify the dimensions, and identify the facts.

<text>Sonneberg () in Thuringia, Germany, is the seat of the Sonneberg district. It is in the Franconian south of Thuringia, neighboring its Upper Franconian twin town Neustadt bei Coburg.

Sonneberg became known as the &quot;world toy city&quot;, and is home to the and the Sonneberg observatory, founded in 1925. The Thuringian Slate Mountains border the city, with the Franconian Forest to the east.
==History==
&quot;The Sonneberg Castle was also called Sonneberg Castle or the Haus zu Sonneberg in old documents. In 480 Süne or Süno, Duke of Franconia, built this castle because of the Thuringian incursions ...&quot; so it says on page 64 in the topography of the Duke of Saxe-Meiningen&#x27;s share in the Duchy of Coburg from the year 1781. This not uncritical representation is based on the history of the Franks by Abbot Johannes Trithemius from 1514.

The name Sonneberg was first mentioned in documents in 1207. It goes back to the noble family of the Lords of Sonneberg, which is documented in the 12th and 13th centuries and founded a settlement below the Sonneberg Castle, which originally consisted of the estate and two hamlets, the village of &quot;Alt-Rötin, presumed to be in Herrnau &quot;And the&quot; Stätlein zu Rötin under the Sonneberg Castle&quot;. The Lords of Sonneberg were ministerials in the service of the Dukes of Andechs-Meranien, who, as a Bavarian noble family, established a lordly administration in the region around Sonneberg and Coburg.

The quarrying of whetstones and slate for slates has been documented since 1500. From the long-established wooden goods manufacture, the production of the Sonneberg toys known as Nuremberg trinkets developed from the 16th century onwards. Around 1700, the Dressel company, and from 1873 Cuno &amp; Otto Dressel, the largest manufacturer and exporter of toys was founded in Sonneberg. From 1805, with the introduction of paper mache, Sonneberg developed into a toy production center with international status, especially in the manufacture of dolls (see also: F. M. Schilling). In 1840 a city fire destroyed the old city center around the market square in what is now the Upper City. In 1883 the industrial school was opened in Mühlgasse 4, where artistic porcelain, glass and toy design was taught.
The term “world toy city” was coined around 1913 due to the share of Sonneberg&#x27;s production on the world market. Before the First World War, around 20% of the toys traded on the world market in the Sonneberg area were mainly manufactured at home. In addition to the term world toy city, Sonneberg advanced to become the “workshop of the Santa Claus”. From the 1870s onwards, the toy industry did not respond to increasing demand and falling sales prices with a transition to industrial production in larger factories using innovative techniques. Even if exports to the US rose by around 600% between 1865 and 1885, in 1880 85% of the companies had just four employees. [10] It was the number of these traditionally working small and micro-businesses that increased tremendously in response to the increased demand. In 1880 there were a total of 321 companies. 1899, almost 20 years later, 2395, an increase of 746%.

One of the heydays of the toy industry led to the development of the station square with representative buildings in the 1920s. First, the US company Halbourn built a six-story trading house that has been owned by the AOK since 1925. Opposite it, in 1926, the American department store company F. W. Woolworth Company, which had been purchasing locally since 1880, built a trading and warehouse for the purchase and export of toys and Christmas tree decorations. The five-storey reinforced concrete building with its own siding was built according to plans by the Sonneberg architect Walter Buchholz.

In divided post-war Germany, Sonneberg found itself within the borders of East Germany, cut off from its large neighbouring town of Coburg, Bavaria in West Germany and could only face north economically. It was served by an unnaturally winding railway route and thus became somewhat isolated from the rest of East Germany. Sonneberg Hauptbahnhof is served by the Coburg–Sonneberg line.

After the fall of the Wall, toy shops were privatized or re-privatized, if they still existed. In 2002 the Thuringian Day took place in Sonneberg. The city became a member of the European metropolitan region of Nuremberg in July 2012, initially on a trial basis, and has been a permanent member since October 2013.

The 14th Franconian Day was celebrated on July 6 and 7, 2019 by the district of Upper Franconia together with the Bavarian state government and the two host cities Sonneberg and Neustadt bei Coburg for the first time across borders with over 25,000 visitors under the motto: GEMEINSAM.FRÄNKISCH.STARK.

Sonneberg is a location with a close network with hydrogen initiatives in the metropolitan region of Central Germany and it is a member of the European metropolitan region of Nuremberg. Thus, Sonneberg has a &quot;hinge function&quot; to the important economic areas between the Main and Elbe. The HySon Institute for Applied Hydrogen Research emerged in February 2021 from a network of actors from business and science. There are 50 partners in total. Their common goal is to close the gap between research and application.

==Subdivisions==

The town Sonneberg consists of the following subdivisions:
Since 31 December 2013, when the former municipality Oberland am Rennsteig was merged into Sonneberg, the following villages also form part of Sonneberg: Haselbach, Eschenthal, Hasenthal, Hüttengrund and Spechtsbrunn.

<doc id="1344416" wikidata="Q982225" url="?curid=1344416" title="Eamon Gilmore">
<text>Eamon Gilmore (born 24 April 1955) is an Irish diplomat and former Labour Party politician. He has served as European Union Special Representative for Human Rights since February 2019. He has also been the European Union Special Envoy for the Colombian Peace Process since 2015. He was Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade from 2011 to 2014, Leader of the Labour Party from 2007 to 2014, Chair of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe from 2012 to 2013, Minister of State at the Department of the Marine from 1994 to 1997. He was a Teachta Dála for the Dún Laoghaire constituency from 1989 to 2016.

At the 2011 general election he led the Labour Party to its best electoral performance, with a record 37 Dáil seats. Labour entered into a coalition government with Fine Gael, with Gilmore being appointed Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.

As Minister for Foreign Affairs, he led Ireland&#x27;s seventh presidency of the European Council during the first half of 2013. Throughout 2012, he held the role of Chairperson-In-Office of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).

Born in County Galway, Gilmore graduated from University College Galway (UCG), becoming President of the Union of Students in Ireland. Later, he entered local politics and worked as a trade union organiser. As a Democratic Left TD, he helped to negotiate that party&#x27;s merger with Labour. Gilmore was elected unopposed as Labour Party leader in 2007; he resigned from the post in July 2014 and was succeeded by Joan Burton.

==Early life and career==
Eamon Gilmore was born into a small farming family in Caltra, County Galway in 1955. When he was 14 months old his father died, leaving his mother to run the mixed farm and raise Gilmore and his younger brother John.

Gilmore received his primary education in Caltra, a small two-teacher national school. He was taught there through the medium of Irish, and he is a fluent Irish speaker to this day. Following his sixth-year state primary exam, he qualified for a scholarship from Galway County Council which enabled him to attend secondary school. He entered Garbally College, Ballinasloe, as a boarder in 1967.

Availing himself of a third-level grant to fund his degree, he went on to study psychology at UCG. He was an active member of the Drama Society at the university, where his contemporaries included the theatre director Garry Hynes and actor Marie Mullen who both went on to found the Druid Theatre Company. He also took part in the university debating scene, mainly through the Literary and Debating Society.

He was elected class representative and later, at the age of 18, was elected President of UCG Students&#x27; Union from July 1974 to June 1975. In 1975, towards the end of his term of office, he joined the UCG Republican Club which was affiliated to Official Sinn Féin; that party was subsequently renamed Sinn Féin – The Workers&#x27; Party, and later still became the Workers&#x27; Party. In recent years he has been accused of being evasive on the subject and of trying to play down that he had joined the Official Republican Movement; he has stated that the party &quot;was in the process of becoming the Workers&#x27; Party at that time, I can&#x27;t recall exactly the dates&quot;.

From 1976 until 1978, Gilmore served as President of the Union of Students in Ireland (USI).

Before a career in politics, he worked as a trade union organiser. He joined the Irish Transport &amp; General Workers&#x27; Union (now SIPTU) in 1978 and, after brief spells in Dublin No. 4 (Hotels &amp; Catering) and Dublin No. 14 (Engineering) Branches, was rapidly promoted to become Acting Secretary of the Galway Branch (1978–79), Secretary of the Tralee Branch (1979–81), and of the Professional &amp; Managerial Staffs Branch (1981–89). He was heavily involved in organising tax protests in Galway and resisting redundancies and closures in County Kerry.

Gilmore has described the driving factors which have informed his working life, whether as a trade union officer or public representative. &quot;I like advocating. I love to share in the joy people get out of cracking it, getting the job or getting some right they should have. I get huge satisfaction out of working for improvements and seeing those come through&quot;.

==Political career==
Gilmore was elected at the 1985 election to the electoral county of Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, serving on both Dún Laoghaire Borough Council and Dublin County Council. He was re-elected at the 1991 election; both were abolished in January 1994, with Gilmore continuing thereafter for Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council.

He was first elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1989 general election as a member of the Workers&#x27; Party for the constituency of Dún Laoghaire and was re-elected at every subsequent general election until he retired at the 2016 general election.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, he was linked with Proinsias De Rossa in attempting to jettison some of the Workers&#x27; Party&#x27;s Marxist aspects and to move the party towards an acceptance of free-market economics.

In an attempt to address these issues Gilmore and De Rossa along with their supporters sought to distance themselves from paramilitary activity at a special held in Dún Laoghaire on 15 February 1992. A motion proposed by De Rossa and general secretary Des Geraghty sought to stand down the existing membership, elect an 11-member provisional executive council and make several other significant changes in party structures was defeated. The following day at an &quot;Ard Chomhairle&quot; meeting, six of the party&#x27;s seven TDs, including De Rossa and Gimore, resigned from the Workers&#x27; Party to create a new political party, Democratic Left (originally known as New Agenda).

Throughout his political career, Gilmore has worked for peace in Northern Ireland. Along with other prominent figures including Proinsias de Rossa and Eamon Dunphy, Gilmore was among the first organisers of the Peace Train campaign which was started in 1989 in response to the repeated bombing of the Dublin to Belfast railway by the Provisional IRA. Northern Ireland was also a priority for Gilmore as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade during which time his efforts to reach out to the unionist community in particular were acknowledged.

In the Rainbow Coalition, between 1994 and 1997, Gilmore served as Minister of State at the Department of the Marine where he is credited for overseeing major reform in port ownership, investment in port development, banning nuclear vessels from Irish seas and restricting dumping at sea.

With Labour&#x27;s Brendan Howlin, Gilmore was a central figure in the negotiations that led to the merger of Democratic Left with the Labour Party in 1999 under the Leadership of Ruairi Quinn. From 1999 to 2007, he sat on the Labour Party front bench as Environment, Housing and Local Government Spokesperson.
After Quinn&#x27;s resignation in 2002, Gilmore unsuccessfully contested the Leadership won by former student union and political colleague Pat Rabbitte.

Around this time, Gilmore voiced his support for the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which campaigns for the democratic reformation of the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system.

===Labour Party leader===

Following Pat Rabbitte&#x27;s resignation as party leader in August 2007, Gilmore announced his candidacy for the leadership. He received support from senior figures such as Michael D. Higgins, Ruairi Quinn, Willie Penrose, Liz McManus and Emmet Stagg, and did not have to contest a ballot, being formally confirmed as leader on 6 September, after being the only declared candidate. He became the tenth leader of the Labour Party.

From early on in his Leadership Gilmore insisted that Labour should aspire to lead the next Government and set about building Labour as a third option for voters. At the 2009 local elections, the Labour Party added to its total of council seats, with 132 seats won (a gain of 43) and by July 2010 had gained an additional six seats from councillors joining the party since the election. On Dublin City Council, the party was again the largest, but now with more seats than the two other main parties combined.

At the 2009 European Parliament election held on the same day, the Labour Party increased its number of seats from 1 to 3, retaining the seat of Proinsias De Rossa in the Dublin constituency, while gaining seats in the East constituency with Nessa Childers, and in the South constituency with Alan Kelly.

Gilmore campaigned for a Yes vote in the first Lisbon Treaty referendum in 2008. When it was defeated, he declared that the &quot;Lisbon Treaty is dead&quot;. According to a wikileaks cable dated 23 July 2008 and released in 2011, he told the US Ambassador privately that he would support a second referendum. The ambassador reported that: &quot;He explained his public posture of opposition to a second referendum as &#x27;politically necessary&#x27; for the time being&quot;. In 2009, after a second referendum had approved it, the Lisbon Treaty proposal was passed by the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland.

In September 2009, at the Labour Parliamentary Party Meeting in Waterford, Gilmore categorically ruled out a coalition with Fianna Fáil after the next general election, reiterating what he had said in earlier interviews.

In his leader&#x27;s address to the 2010 Labour Party Conference (17 April 2010), Gilmore outlined his vision that the Labour Party should lead the way in building &#x27;One Ireland&#x27;. In this speech, he listed the Labour Party&#x27;s policy priorities as Jobs, Reform and Fairness. He also said he was determined that the Labour Party would run enough candidates at the next general election to enable the Irish people to make Labour the largest party in the Dáil and to lead the next government.

In July 2010, Gilmore again ruled out a coalition between his party and Fianna Fáil after a general election, even if such a coalition would put him in a position to become Taoiseach. Gilmore also said his party was well-positioned to win at least one seat in each of the country&#x27;s 43 constituencies, and two seats in some constituencies in Dublin, Cork, other urban areas and commuter-belt counties. In all, he said the party had the potential to win 50 seats or more.

Gilmore also played a leading role in the modernisation and liberalisation of Ireland&#x27;s social legislation, most notably on divorce and abortion, and has been to the fore in the campaign for gay marriage. He is often quoted for citing gay marriage as &quot;the civil rights issue of this generation&quot;. Gilmore also committed to holding a constitutional referendum on the issue a key plank of the Labour/Fine Gael programme for government. A referendum on gay marriage was held in 2015. He was a member of the cabinet committee that steered through Ireland&#x27;s divorce legislation in 1996, as well as a member of the Divorce Action Group which campaigned for the legalisation of divorce in Ireland. In 1983, Gilmore campaigned against the ban on abortion in the Constitution.

As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Gilmore was behind the most significant expansion of Ireland&#x27;s embassy network for several decades, opening eight new diplomatic missions across Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas in 2014. Despite considerable media focus on the reopening of the embassy to the Vatican, which had been closed for economic reasons in 2011 along with the embassy to Tehran, the new missions are largely trade and investment-focussed.

In 2013, Gilmore launched the first review of Irish foreign policy since 1996.

Gilmore was a member of the Economic Management Council (EMC), along with Taoiseach Enda Kenny, Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan, and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Brendan Howlin, since March 2011. For the first three years of the Fine Gael/Labour government, the EMC was regarded as the lynchpin of the coalition&#x27;s stability.

In May 2014, after a poor showing for Labour at the local and European elections, Gilmore resigned as leader. Following a leadership election in July 2014, he was succeeded as party leader and as Tánaiste by Joan Burton.

===2011 general election===
Gilmore led Labour to the best electoral performance in the party&#x27;s 99-year history at the 2011 general election. The party won 37 seats. It did especially well in Dublin, taking 18 seats to become the largest party in the capital. Gilmore topped the poll in the Dún Laoghaire constituency.

===Tánaiste and government minister (2011–14)===
Following the election, Labour entered a coalition with Fine Gael. Gilmore became Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. He named five ministers to cabinet, six Ministers of State, and Máire Whelan as Attorney General. He also recreated the office of the Tánaiste within the Department of the Taoiseach to enhance his control over Government policy. This office was originally created under Tánaiste Dick Spring in 1992, but was abolished by his successor Mary Harney.

===Troika bailout exit===
On 15 December 2013, Ireland became the first eurozone country to exit a €67.5  billion EC/ECB/IMF bailout programme following a multi-year programme. The troika bailout was triggered in November 2010 following the collapse of the Irish property market which in turn had pushed the country&#x27;s banks into financial crisis.

A blanket guarantee on all of the liabilities of the Irish banks — established by the previous Fianna Fáil/Green Party coalition in September 2008 — dragged the State to near bankruptcy and forced the government to turn to the EU/IMF as lenders of last resort.

In November 2014, the Government announced that it would exit the EU/IMF bailout programme without seeking a precautionary credit line, often referred to as a &#x27;clean bailout exit&#x27;. In an interview with RTÉ&#x27;s Morning Ireland radio programme on 15 November, Gilmore explained that the Government had conducted a long process of consultation with international institutions and other EU member states before deciding to exit the bailout cleanly. He also pointed to the existence of a €20  billion &quot;backstop&quot; of reserve funding held by the National Treasury Management Agency that could fund the Irish State up until the beginning of 2015 if so required.

===Northern Ireland===
On 11 November 2012, Gilmore became the first Irish Government Minister to take part in the annual Remembrance Sunday ceremony in Belfast when he laid a laurel wreath at the Cenotaph at Belfast City Hall to honour those who had died in the First and Second World Wars. He attended the ceremony again the following year.

In September 2013, the Irish Times reported that he had &quot;br[oken] new political ground&quot; when in a speech to the British Irish Association in Cambridge, &quot;he went out of his way to address a unionist perception of a failure by a number of Irish governments to properly combat the IRA&quot;. In the same speech, he also said he hoped that the Government of Ireland could &quot;host representatives of the royal family and the British government, along with the leaders of unionism, in Dublin in three years&#x27; time in remembering the Easter Rising&quot;. He was part of the process which aimed at resolving issues relating to parading, flags and emblems, and the past that was chaired by US diplomat Richard Haass from September to December 2013, and he maintained contact with the parties involved until he was replaced as foreign affairs minister in a cabinet reshuffle the following year.

===OSCE chair===
On 1 January 2012, Ireland assumed the 2012 chair of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OCSE) for the first time. In his role as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Gilmore served as the Chairman-in-Office of the OSCE.

===EU Presidency and budget negotiations===
As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Gilmore led Ireland&#x27;s seventh Presidency of the Council of the European Union during the first half of 2013. He chaired the General Affairs Council of the European Union (EU) and acted as lead negotiator for the Council in talks with the European Parliament on a €960  billion, seven-year budget deal – also known as a Multi-Annual Financial Framework (MFF) – for the EU for the period 2014–2020.

===Ireland&#x27;s diplomatic network===
In November 2011, Gilmore announced the closure of Ireland&#x27;s embassies in Iran and the Vatican, and a representative office in East Timor, on economic grounds. Ireland was to retain an ambassador to the Holy See who would reside in Ireland rather than Rome. In January 2014, he announced that eight new diplomatic missions would be opened around the world, focusing mainly on trade and investment.

===Undocumented Irish citizens in the US===
As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Gilmore lobbied for comprehensive legislation overhauling US immigration laws to help an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants, over 50,000 of whom are believed to be Irish. On 17 June 2014, Gilmore travelled to Washington D.C. for two days of meetings, most of which focused on Republican members of the House of Representatives.

===Croke Park agreement===
In December, Gilmore once again put his support behind the Croke Park Deal on public sector pay and conditions. The dismissal of a renegotiation of the deal came in light of comments from Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources Pat Rabbitte that the deal could be renegotiated along with calls from junior Fine Gael TDs that the agreement should be scrapped.

==Retirement from Irish politics and afterwards==
On 2 June 2015, Gilmore announced that he would not contest the 2016 general election.

In February 2016, he was appointed as an adjunct professor in the School of Law and Government at Dublin City University.

In 2017, he was a Visiting Practitioner Professor at the School of Public Policy at the Central European University, Budapest. He has also lectured at universities, think tanks and public policy conferences throughout Europe, the UK, the US, Latin America and Africa.

He is also a Member of the External Advisory Board of the National University of Ireland, Galway and is a member of the International Advisory Board of the Alpbach Forum in Austria.

===European Union Special Representative===
On 1 October 2015, Gilmore was appointed by High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini as European Union Special Envoy for the Colombian Peace Process.

On 19 February 2019, the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini nominated Eamon Gilmore to be European Union Special Representative for Human Rights. His nomination was approved by the Foreign Affairs Council on 20 February 2019. His mandate ended on 29 February 2024.

== Awards and honours ==
In 2015, Gilmore was named by the Washington-based &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; as one of the 100 leading Global Thinkers for his role in Ireland&#x27;s marriage equality referendum, which approved same-sex marriage.

In 2016, he was conferred with an Honorary Doctorate in law by his alma mater, the National University of Ireland, Galway.

The Government of France has made him an Official of the Legion of Honour.

Colombia has honoured him with the Order of San Carlos (Gran Cruz) for his work on the Peace Process.

==Personal life==
Gilmore met his wife Carol at university. They have lived in Shankill, Dublin since 1979, and have two sons and one daughter. His brother, John, is a television producer in Washington D.C.

He described his religious beliefs during an interview, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m agnostic. I doubt rather than I believe, let me put it that way&quot;. He also said &quot;I&#x27;m pro-choice&quot; when asked during the same interview if abortion should be legalised.

He published a book in November 2010 entitled &quot;Leading Lights: People Who&#x27;ve Inspired Me&quot; and an account of his time as Labour leader during the financial crash and recovery&quot;, Inside the Room: The Untold Story of Ireland&#x27;s Crisis Government&quot; in 2016.

<text>Green building (also known as green construction, sustainable building, or eco-friendly building) refers to both a structure and the application of processes that are environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout a building&#x27;s life-cycle: from planning to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and demolition. This requires close cooperation of the contractor, the architects, the engineers, and the client at all project stages. The Green Building practice expands and complements the classical building design concerns of economy, utility, durability, and comfort. Green building also refers to saving resources to the maximum extent, including energy saving, land saving, water saving, material saving, etc., during the whole life cycle of the building, protecting the environment and reducing pollution, providing people with healthy, comfortable and efficient use of space, and being in harmony with nature. Buildings that live in harmony; green building technology focuses on low consumption, high efficiency, economy, environmental protection, integration and optimization.’

Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is a set of rating systems for the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of green buildings which was developed by the U.S. Green Building Council. Other certificate systems that confirm the sustainability of buildings are the British BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) for buildings and large-scale developments or the DGNB System (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Nachhaltiges Bauen e.V.) which benchmarks the sustainability performance of buildings, indoor environments and districts. Currently, the World Green Building Council is conducting research on the effects of green buildings on the health and productivity of their users and is working with the World Bank to promote Green Buildings in Emerging Markets through EDGE (Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies) Market Transformation Program and certification. There are also other tools such as NABERS or Green Star in Australia, Global Sustainability Assessment System (GSAS) used in the Middle East and the Green Building Index (GBI) predominantly used in Malaysia.

Building information modeling (BIM) is a process involving the generation and management of digital representations of physical and functional characteristics of places. Building information models (BIMs) are files (often but not always in proprietary formats and containing proprietary data) which can be extracted, exchanged, or networked to support decision-making regarding a building or other built asset. Current BIM software is used by individuals, businesses, and government agencies who plan, design, construct, operate and maintain diverse physical infrastructures, such as water, refuse, electricity, gas, communication utilities, roads, railways, bridges, ports, and tunnels.

Although new technologies are constantly being developed to complement current practices in creating greener structures, the common objective of green buildings is to reduce the overall impact of the built environment on human health and the natural environment by:
* Efficiently using energy, water, and other resources
* Protecting occupant health and improving employee productivity (see healthy building)
* Reducing waste, pollution, and environmental degradation

Natural building is a similar concept, usually on a smaller scale and focusing on the use of locally available natural materials. Other related topics include sustainable design and green architecture. Sustainability may be defined as meeting the needs of present generations without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Although some green building programs don&#x27;t address the issue of retrofitting existing homes, others do, especially through public schemes for energy efficient refurbishment. Green construction principles can easily be applied to retrofit work as well as new construction.

A 2009 report by the U.S. General Services Administration found 12 sustainably-designed buildings that cost less to operate and have excellent energy performance. In addition, occupants were overall more satisfied with the building than those in typical commercial buildings. These are eco-friendly buildings.

==Reducing environmental impact==
Buildings represent a large part of energy, electricity, water and materials consumption. As of 2020, they account for 37% of global energy use and energy-related emissions, which the United Nations estimate contributed to 33% of overall worldwide emissions. Including the manufacturing of building materials, the global emissions were 39%. If new technologies in construction are not adopted during this time of rapid growth, emissions could double by 2050, according to the United Nations Environment Program.

Glass buildings, especially all-glass skyscrapers, contribute significantly to climate change due to their energy inefficiency. While these structures are visually appealing and allow abundant natural light, they also trap heat, necessitating increased use of air conditioning systems, which contribute to higher carbon emissions. Experts advocate for design modifications and potential restrictions on all-glass edifices to mitigate their detrimental environmental impact.

Buildings account for a large amount of land. According to the National Resources Inventory, approximately of land in the United States are developed. The International Energy Agency released a publication that estimated that existing buildings are responsible for more than 40% of the world&#x27;s total primary energy consumption and for 24% of global carbon dioxide emissions.

According to Global status report from the year 2016, buildings consume more than 30% of all produced energy. The report states that &quot;Under a below 2°C trajectory, effective action to improve building energy efficiency could limit building final energy demand to just above current levels, meaning that the average energy intensity of the global building stock would decrease by more than 80% by 2050&quot;.Green building practices aim to reduce the environmental impact of building as the building sector has the greatest potential to deliver significant cuts in emissions at little or no cost. General guidelines can be summarized as follows: Every building should be as small as possible. Avoid contributing to sprawl, even if the most energy-efficient, environmentally sound methods are used in design and construction. Bioclimatic design principles are able to reduce energy expenditure and by extension, carbon emissions. Bioclimatic design is a method of building design that takes local climate into account to create comfortable conditions within the structure. This could be as simple as constructing a different shape for the building envelope or facing the building towards the south to maximize solar exposure for energy or lighting purposes. Given the limitations of city planned construction, bioclimatic principles may be employed on a lesser scale, however it is still an effective passive method to reduce environmental impact.

==Goals of green building==
The concept of sustainable development can be traced to the energy (especially fossil oil) crisis and environmental pollution concerns of the 1960s and 1970s. The Rachel Carson book, &quot;Silent Spring&quot;, published in 1962, is considered to be one of the first initial efforts to describe sustainable development as related to green building. The green building movement in the U.S. originated from the need and desire for more energy efficient and environmentally friendly construction practices. There are a number of motives for building green, including environmental, economic, and social benefits. However, modern sustainability initiatives call for an integrated and synergistic design to both new construction and in the retrofitting of existing structures. Also known as sustainable design, this approach integrates the building life-cycle with each green practice employed with a design-purpose to create a synergy among the practices used.

Green building brings together a vast array of practices, techniques, and skills to reduce and ultimately eliminate the impacts of buildings on the environment and human health. It often emphasizes taking advantage of renewable resources, e.g., using sunlight through passive solar, active solar, and photovoltaic equipment, and using plants and trees through green roofs, rain gardens, and reduction of rainwater run-off. Many other techniques are used, such as using low-impact building materials or using packed gravel or permeable concrete instead of conventional concrete or asphalt to enhance replenishment of groundwater.

While the practices or technologies employed in green building are constantly evolving and may differ from region to region, fundamental principles persist from which the method is derived: siting and structure design efficiency, energy efficiency, water efficiency, materials efficiency, indoor environmental quality enhancement, operations and maintenance optimization and waste and toxics reduction. The essence of green building is an optimization of one or more of these principles. Also, with the proper synergistic design, individual green building technologies may work together to produce a greater cumulative effect.

On the aesthetic side of green architecture or sustainable design is the philosophy of designing a building that is in harmony with the natural features and resources surrounding the site. There are several key steps in designing sustainable buildings: specify &#x27;green&#x27; building materials from local sources, reduce loads, optimize systems, and generate on-site renewable energy.

===Life cycle assessment===
A life cycle assessment (LCA) can help avoid a narrow outlook on environmental, social and economic concerns by assessing a full range of impacts associated with all cradle-to-grave stages of a process: from extraction of raw materials through materials processing, manufacture, distribution, use, repair and maintenance, and disposal or recycling. Impacts taken into account include (among others) embodied energy, global warming potential, resource use, air pollution, water pollution, and waste.

In terms of green building, the last few years have seen a shift away from a &quot;prescriptive&quot; approach, which assumes that certain prescribed practices are better for the environment, toward the scientific evaluation of actual performance through LCA.

Although LCA is widely recognized as the best way to evaluate the environmental impacts of buildings (ISO 14040 provides a recognized LCA methodology), it is not yet a consistent requirement of green building rating systems and codes, despite the fact that embodied energy and other life cycle impacts are critical to the design of environmentally responsible buildings.

In North America, LCA is rewarded to some extent in the Green Globes rating system, and is part of the new American National Standard based on Green Globes, &quot;ANSI/GBI 01-2010: Green Building Protocol for Commercial Buildings&quot;. LCA is also included as a pilot credit in the LEED system, though a decision has not been made as to whether it will be incorporated fully into the next major revision. The state of California also included LCA as a voluntary measure in its 2010 draft &quot;Green Building Standards Code&quot;.

Although LCA is often perceived as overly complex and time-consuming for regular use by design professionals, research organizations such as BRE in the UK and the Athena Sustainable Materials Institute in North America are working to make it more accessible.

In the UK, the BRE &quot;Green Guide to Specifications&quot; offers ratings for 1,500 building materials based on LCA.

===Siting and structure design efficiency===

The foundation of any construction project is rooted in the concept and design stages. The concept stage, in fact, is one of the major steps in a project life cycle, as it has the largest impact on cost and performance. In designing environmentally optimal buildings, the objective is to minimize the total environmental impact associated with all life-cycle stages of the building project. However, building as a process is not as streamlined as an industrial process, and varies from one building to the other, never repeating itself identically. In addition, buildings are much more complex products, composed of a multitude of materials and components each constituting various design variables to be decided at the design stage. A variation of every design variable may affect the environment during all the building&#x27;s relevant life-cycle stages.

===Energy efficiency===
Green buildings often include measures to reduce energy consumption – both the embodied energy required to extract, process, transport and install building materials and operating energy to provide services such as heating and power for equipment.

As high-performance buildings use less operating energy, embodied energy has assumed much greater importance – and may make up as much as 30% of the overall life cycle energy consumption. Studies such as the U.S. LCI Database Project show buildings built primarily with wood will have a lower embodied energy than those built primarily with brick, concrete, or steel.

To reduce operating energy use, designers use details that reduce air leakage through the building envelope (the barrier between conditioned and unconditioned space). They also specify high-performance windows and extra insulation in walls, ceilings, and floors. Another strategy, passive solar building design, is often implemented in low-energy homes. Designers orient windows and walls and place awnings, porches, and trees to shade windows and roofs during the summer while maximizing solar gain in the winter. In addition, effective window placement (daylighting) can provide more natural light and lessen the need for electric lighting during the day. Solar water heating further reduces energy costs.

Onsite generation of renewable energy through solar power, wind power, hydro power, or biomass can significantly reduce the environmental impact of the building. Power generation is generally the most expensive feature to add to a building.

Energy efficiency for green buildings can be evaluated from either numerical or non-numerical methods. These include use of simulation modelling, analytical or statistical tools.

In a report published in April 2024, the International Energy Agency (IEA) highlighted that buildings are responsible for about 30% of global final energy consumption and over 50% of electricity demand. It noted the tripling of heat pump sales from 2015 to 2022, electric cars accounting for 20% of 2023 vehicle sales, and a potential doubling of China&#x27;s peak electricity demand by mid-century. India&#x27;s air conditioner ownership could see a tenfold rise by 2050, causing a sixfold increase in peak electricity demand, which could be halved with efficient practices. By 2050, demand response measures might lower household electricity bills by 7% to 12% in advanced economies and nearly 20% in developing ones, with smart device installations nearly doubling by 2030. The US could see a 116 GW reduction in peak demand, 80 million tonnes less CO2 per year by 2030, and save between USD 100 billion and USD 200 billion over twenty years with grid-interactive buildings. In Alabama, a smart neighborhood demonstrated 35% to 45% energy savings compared to traditional homes.

===Water efficiency===

Reducing water consumption and protecting water quality are key objectives in sustainable building. One critical issue of water consumption is that in many areas, the demands on the supplying aquifer exceed its ability to replenish itself. To the maximum extent feasible, facilities should increase their dependence on water that is collected, used, purified, and reused on-site. The protection and conservation of water throughout the life of a building may be accomplished by designing for dual plumbing that recycles water in toilet flushing or by using water for washing of the cars. Waste-water may be minimized by utilizing water conserving fixtures such as ultra-low flush toilets and low-flow shower heads. Bidets help eliminate the use of toilet paper, reducing sewer traffic and increasing possibilities of re-using water on-site. Point of use water treatment and heating improves both water quality and energy efficiency while reducing the amount of water in circulation. The use of non-sewage and greywater for on-site use such as site-irrigation will minimize demands on the local aquifer.

Large commercial buildings with water and energy efficiency can qualify for an LEED Certification. Philadelphia&#x27;s Comcast Center is the tallest building in Philadelphia. It is also one of the tallest buildings in the USA that is LEED Certified. Their environmental engineering consists of a hybrid central chilled water system which cools floor-by-floor with steam instead of water. Burn&#x27;s Mechanical set-up the entire renovation of the 58 story, 1.4 million square foot sky scraper.

===Materials efficiency===
Building materials typically considered &#x27;green&#x27; include lumber( that has been certified to a third-party standard), rapidly renewable plant materials (like bamboo and straw), dimension stone, recycled stone, hempcrete, recycled metal &quot;(see: copper sustainability and recyclability)&quot;, and other non-toxic, reusable, renewable, and/or recyclable products. Materials with lower embodied energy can be used in substitution to common building materials with high degrees of energy consumption and carbon/harmful emissions. For concrete a high performance self-healing version is available, however options with lower yields of pollutive waste entertain ideas of upcycling and congregate supplementing; replacing traditional concrete mixes with slag, production waste, and aggregates. Insulation also sees multiple angles for substitution. Commonly used fiberglass has competition from other eco-friendly, low energy embodying insulators with similar or higher R-values (per inch of thickness) at a competitive price. Sheep wool, cellulose, and ThermaCork perform more efficiently, however, use may be limited by transportation or installation costs.

Furthermore, embodied energy comparisons can help deduce the selection of building material and its efficiency. Wood production emits less than concrete and steel if produced in a sustainable way just as steel can be produced more sustainably through improvements in technology (e.g. EAF) and energy recycling/carbon capture(an underutilized potential for systematically storing carbon in the built environment).

The EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) also suggests using recycled industrial goods, such as coal combustion products, foundry sand, and demolition debris in construction projects. Energy efficient building materials and appliances are promoted in the United States through energy rebate programs.

A 2022 report from the Boston Consulting Group found that, investments in developing greener forms of cement, iron, and steel lead to bigger greenhouse gas reductions compared with investments in electricity and aviation. In addition, the process of making cement without producing is unavoidable. However, using pozzolans clinkers can reduce emission while in the process of making cement.

===Indoor environmental quality enhancement===

The Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) category in LEED standards, one of the five environmental categories, was created to provide comfort, well-being, and productivity of occupants. The LEED IEQ category addresses design and construction guidelines especially: indoor air quality (IAQ), thermal quality, and lighting quality.

Indoor Air Quality seeks to reduce volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, and other air impurities such as microbial contaminants. Buildings rely on a properly designed ventilation system (passively/naturally or mechanically powered) to provide adequate ventilation of cleaner air from outdoors or recirculated, filtered air as well as isolated operations (kitchens, dry cleaners, etc.) from other occupancies. During the design and construction process choosing construction materials and interior finish products with zero or low VOC emissions will improve IAQ. Most building materials and cleaning/maintenance products emit gases, some of them toxic, such as many VOCs including formaldehyde. These gases can have a detrimental impact on occupants&#x27; health, comfort, and productivity. Avoiding these products will increase a building&#x27;s IEQ. LEED, HQE and Green Star contain specifications on use of low-emitting interior. Draft LEED 2012 is about to expand the scope of the involved products. BREEAM limits formaldehyde emissions, no other VOCs. MAS Certified Green is a registered trademark to delineate low VOC-emitting products in the marketplace. The MAS Certified Green Program ensures that any potentially hazardous chemicals released from manufactured products have been thoroughly tested and meet rigorous standards established by independent toxicologists to address recognized long-term health concerns. These IAQ standards have been adopted by and incorporated into the following programs: 
* The United States Green Building Council (USGBC) in their LEED rating system
* The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) in their section 01350 standards
* The Collaborative for High Performance Schools (CHPS) in their Best Practices Manual 
* The Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturers Association (BIFMA) in their level® sustainability standard.

Also important to indoor air quality is the control of moisture accumulation (dampness) leading to mold growth and the presence of bacteria and viruses as well as dust mites and other organisms and microbiological concerns. Water intrusion through a building&#x27;s envelope or water condensing on cold surfaces on the building&#x27;s interior can enhance and sustain microbial growth. A well-insulated and tightly sealed envelope will reduce moisture problems but adequate ventilation is also necessary to eliminate moisture from sources indoors including human metabolic processes, cooking, bathing, cleaning, and other activities.

Personal temperature and airflow control over the HVAC system coupled with a properly designed building envelope will also aid in increasing a building&#x27;s thermal quality. Creating a high performance luminous environment through the careful integration of daylight and electrical light sources will improve on the lighting quality and energy performance of a structure.

Solid wood products, particularly flooring, are often specified in environments where occupants are known to have allergies to dust or other particulates. Wood itself is considered to be hypo-allergenic and its smooth surfaces prevent the buildup of particles common in soft finishes like carpet. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America recommends hardwood, vinyl, linoleum tile or slate flooring instead of carpet. The use of wood products can also improve air quality by absorbing or releasing moisture in the air to moderate humidity.

Interactions among all the indoor components and the occupants together form the processes that determine the indoor air quality. Extensive investigation of such processes is the subject of indoor air scientific research and is well documented in the journal Indoor Air.

===Operations and maintenance optimization===
No matter how sustainable a building may have been in its design and construction, it can only remain so if it is operated responsibly and maintained properly. Ensuring operations and maintenance(O&amp;M) personnel are part of the project&#x27;s planning and development process will help retain the green criteria designed at the onset of the project. Every aspect of green building is integrated into the O&amp;M phase of a building&#x27;s life. The addition of new green technologies also falls on the O&amp;M staff. Although the goal of waste reduction may be applied during the design, construction and demolition phases of a building&#x27;s life-cycle, it is in the O&amp;M phase that green practices such as recycling and air quality enhancement take place. O&amp;M staff should aim to establish best practices in energy efficiency, resource conservation, ecologically sensitive products and other sustainable practices. Education of building operators and occupants is key to effective implementation of sustainable strategies in O&amp;M services.

===Waste reduction===
Green architecture also seeks to reduce waste of energy, water and materials used during construction. For example, in California nearly 60% of the state&#x27;s waste comes from commercial buildings During the construction phase, one goal should be to reduce the amount of material going to landfills. Well-designed buildings also help reduce the amount of waste generated by the occupants as well, by providing on-site solutions such as compost bins to reduce matter going to landfills.

To reduce the amount of wood that goes to landfill, Neutral Alliance (a coalition of government, NGOs and the forest industry) created the website dontwastewood.com. The site includes a variety of resources for regulators, municipalities, developers, contractors, owner/operators and individuals/homeowners looking for information on wood recycling.

When buildings reach the end of their useful life, they are typically demolished and hauled to landfills. Deconstruction is a method of harvesting what is commonly considered &quot;waste&quot; and reclaiming it into useful building material. Extending the useful life of a structure also reduces waste – building materials such as wood that are light and easy to work with make renovations easier.

To reduce the impact on wells or water treatment plants, several options exist. &quot;Greywater&quot;, wastewater from sources such as dishwashing or washing machines, can be used for subsurface irrigation, or if treated, for non-potable purposes, e.g., to flush toilets and wash cars. Rainwater collectors are used for similar purposes.

Centralized wastewater treatment systems can be costly and use a lot of energy. An alternative to this process is converting waste and wastewater into fertilizer, which avoids these costs and shows other benefits. By collecting human waste at the source and running it to a semi-centralized biogas plant with other biological waste, liquid fertilizer can be produced. This concept was demonstrated by a settlement in Lübeck Germany in the late 1990s. Practices like these provide soil with organic nutrients and create carbon sinks that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, offsetting greenhouse gas emission. Producing artificial fertilizer is also more costly in energy than this process.

===Reduce impact onto electricity network===
Electricity networks are built based on peak demand (another name is peak load). Peak demand is measured in the units of watts (W). It shows how fast electrical energy is consumed. Residential electricity is often charged on electrical energy (kilowatt hour, kWh). Green buildings or sustainable buildings are often capable of saving electrical energy but not necessarily reducing peak demand.

When sustainable building features are designed, constructed and operated efficiently, peak demand can be reduced so that there is less desire for electricity network expansion and there is less impact onto carbon emission and climate change. These sustainable features can be good orientation, sufficient indoor thermal mass, good insulation, photovoltaic panels, thermal or electrical energy storage systems, smart building (home) energy management systems.

==Cost and payoff==
The most criticized issue about constructing environmentally friendly buildings is the price. Photovoltaics, new appliances, and modern technologies tend to cost more money. Most green buildings cost a premium of &lt;2%, but yield 10 times as much over the entire life of the building. In regards to the financial benefits of green building, &quot;Over 20 years, the financial payback typically exceeds the additional cost of greening by a factor of 4-6 times. And broader benefits, such as reductions in greenhouse gases (GHGs) and other pollutants have large positive impacts on surrounding communities and on the planet.&quot; The stigma is between the knowledge of up-front cost vs. life-cycle cost. The savings in money come from more efficient use of utilities which result in decreased energy bills. It is projected that different sectors could save $130 billion on energy bills. Also, higher worker or student productivity can be factored into savings and cost deductions.

Numerous studies have shown the measurable benefit of green building initiatives on worker productivity. In general it has been found that, &quot;there is a direct correlation between increased productivity and employees who love being in their work space.&quot; Specifically, worker productivity can be significantly impacted by certain aspects of green building design such as improved lighting, reduction of pollutants, advanced ventilation systems and the use of non-toxic building materials. In &quot;The Business Case for Green Building&quot;, the U.S. Green Building Council gives another specific example of how commercial energy retrofits increase worker health and thus productivity, &quot;People in the U.S. spend about 90% of their time indoors. EPA studies indicate indoor levels of pollutants may be up to ten times higher than outdoor levels. LEED-certified buildings are designed to have healthier, cleaner indoor environmental quality, which means health benefits for occupants.&quot;

Studies have shown over a 20-year life period, some green buildings have yielded $53 to $71 per square foot back on investment. Confirming the rentability of green building investments, further studies of the commercial real estate market have found that LEED and Energy Star certified buildings achieve significantly higher rents, sale prices and occupancy rates as well as lower capitalization rates potentially reflecting lower investment risk.

==Regulation and operation==
As a result of the increased interest in green building concepts and practices, a number of organizations have developed standards, codes and rating systems for use by government regulators, building professionals and consumers. In some cases, codes are written so local governments can adopt them as bylaws to reduce the local environmental impact of buildings.

Green building rating systems such as BREEAM (United Kingdom), LEED (United States and Canada), DGNB (Germany), CASBEE (Japan), and VERDEGBCe (Spain), GRIHA (India) help consumers determine a structure&#x27;s level of environmental performance. They award credits for optional building features that support green design in categories such as location and maintenance of building site, conservation of water, energy, and building materials, and occupant comfort and health. The number of credits generally determines the level of achievement.

Green building codes and standards, such as the International Code Council&#x27;s draft International Green Construction Code, are sets of rules created by standards development organizations that establish minimum requirements for elements of green building such as materials or heating and cooling.

Some of the major building environmental assessment tools currently in use include:
*United States: International Green Construction Code (IGCC)

== Green neighborhoods and villages ==

At the beginning of the 21st century, efforts were made to implement the principles of green building, not only for individual buildings, but also for neighborhoods and villages. The intent is to create zero energy neighborhoods and villages, which means they&#x27;re going to create all the energy on their own. They will also reuse waste, implements sustainable transportation, and produce their own food. Green villages have been identified as a way to decentralize sustainable climate practices, which may prove key in areas with high rural or scattered village populations, such as India, where 74% of the population lives in over 600,000 different villages.

==International frameworks and assessment tools==
IPCC Fourth Assessment Report

Climate Change 2007, the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), is the fourth in a series of such reports. The IPCC was established by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to assess scientific, technical and socio-economic information concerning climate change, its potential effects and options for adaptation and mitigation.

UNEP and Climate change

United Nations Environment Program UNEP works to facilitate the transition to low-carbon societies, support climate proofing efforts, improve understanding of climate change science, and raise public awareness about this global challenge.

GHG Indicator

The Greenhouse Gas Indicator: UNEP Guidelines for Calculating Greenhouse Gas Emissions for Businesses and Non-Commercial Organizations

Agenda 21

Agenda 21 is a programme run by the United Nations (UN) related to sustainable development. It is a comprehensive blueprint of action to be taken globally, nationally and locally by organizations of the UN, governments, and major groups in every area in which humans impact on the environment. The number 21 refers to the 21st century.

FIDIC&#x27;s PSM

The International Federation of Consulting Engineers (FIDIC) Project Sustainability Management Guidelines were created to assist project engineers and other stakeholders in setting sustainable development goals for their projects that are recognized and accepted as being in the interests of society. The process is also intended to align project goals with local conditions and priorities and assist those involved in managing projects to measure and verify their progress.

The Project Sustainability Management Guidelines are structured with Themes and Sub-Themes under the three main sustainability headings of Social, Environmental and Economic. For each individual Sub-Theme a core project indicator is defined along with guidance as to the relevance of that issue in the context of an individual
project.

The Sustainability Reporting Framework provides guidance for organizations to use as the basis for disclosure about their sustainability performance, and also provides stakeholders a universally applicable, comparable framework in which to understand disclosed information.

The Reporting Framework contains the core product of the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, as well as Protocols and Sector Supplements.
The Guidelines are used as the basis for all reporting. They are the foundation upon which all other reporting guidance is based, and outline core content for reporting that is broadly relevant to all organizations regardless of size, sector, or location. The Guidelines contain principles and guidance as well as standard disclosures – including indicators – to outline a disclosure framework that organizations can voluntarily, flexibly, and incrementally, adopt.

Protocols underpin each indicator in the Guidelines and include definitions for key terms in the indicator, compilation methodologies, intended scope of the indicator, and other technical references.

Sector Supplements respond to the limits of a one-size-fits-all approach. Sector Supplements complement the use of the core Guidelines by capturing the unique set of sustainability issues faced by different sectors such as mining, automotive, banking, public agencies and others.

IPD Environment Code

The IPD Environment Code was launched in February 2008. The Code is intended as a good practice global standard for measuring the environmental performance of corporate buildings. Its aim is to accurately measure and manage the environmental impacts of corporate buildings and enable property executives to generate high quality, comparable performance information about their
buildings anywhere in the world. The Code covers a wide range of building types (from offices to airports) and aims to inform and support
the following;
* Creating an environmental strategy
* Inputting to real estate strategy
* Communicating a commitment to environmental improvement
* Creating performance targets
* Environmental improvement plans
* Performance assessment and measurement
* Life cycle assessments
* Acquisition and disposal of buildings
* Supplier management
* Information systems and data population
* Compliance with regulations
* Team and personal objectives

IPD estimate that it will take approximately three years to gather significant data to develop a robust set of baseline data that could be used across a typical corporate estate.

ISO 21931 

ISO/TS 21931:2006, Sustainability in building construction—Framework for methods of assessment for environmental performance of construction works—Part 1: Buildings, is intended to provide a general framework for improving the quality and comparability of methods for assessing the environmental performance of buildings. It identifies and describes issues to be taken into account when using methods for the assessment of environmental performance for new or existing building properties in the design, construction, operation, refurbishment and deconstruction stages. It is not an assessment system in itself but is intended be used in conjunction with, and following the principles set out in, the ISO 14000 series of standards.

<text>Jan O&#x27;Sullivan (; born 6 December 1950) is an Irish former Labour Party politician who served as Minister for Education and Skills from 2014 to 2016 and as a Minister of State from 2011 to 2014. She served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Limerick City constituency from 2011 to 2020, and previously from 1998 to 2011 for the Limerick East constituency.

==Personal life==
O&#x27;Sullivan was born in Clonlara, County Clare, in 1950. She was educated at Villiers School, Limerick, where her father was a journalist. After graduating from Trinity College Dublin, she took a Higher Diploma in Education at University College Cork. After working as a teacher for a short period of time, she studied as a Montessori teacher while living in Canada. After returning to Ireland, in the late 1970s, O&#x27;Sullivan helped to run Limerick&#x27;s family planning clinic.

A member of the Church of Ireland, she married Paul O&#x27;Sullivan, a Catholic and a GP; they have one daughter and one son. She spent time at home while having her children and once they were in school she ran a playgroup in the mornings, spent time with the children in the afternoon and did political work in the evenings.

==Political career==
===Democratic Socialist: 1982–1990===
In 1982, O&#x27;Sullivan joined the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), a small party founded by Limerick TD Jim Kemmy, who had previously been a members of the Labour Party. There had been no political tradition in her family – her parents had supported different parties – and her choice of party was based on her support for Kemmy&#x27;s anti-nationalist stance on Northern Ireland, and his advocacy of family planning services and a pro-choice approach to abortion. Family planning was deeply controversial in Ireland from the 1970s to the 1990s, particularly in Limerick, where Kemmy had lost his Dáil seat at the November 1982 general election, after being denounced by the Catholic Church for his opposition to the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution. Those such as O&#x27;Sullivan who were involved in the family planning services which Kemmy had helped found were labelled &quot;Kemmy&#x27;s Femmies&quot;.

O&#x27;Sullivan was elected to Limerick City Council in 1985, she also served as a member of the Mid-Western Health Board from 1991 to 2003.

===Labour: 1990s===
O&#x27;Sullivan joined the Labour Party when the DSP merged with Labour in 1990, having been one of the DSP&#x27;s negotiators in the merger discussions. At the 1992 general election, as the running-mate Jim Kemmy, she narrowly missed winning a second seat for Labour in Limerick East. In 1993, she was elected to the 20th Seanad on the Administrative Panel, and became leader of the Labour group in Seanad Éireann.

From 1993 to 1994, O&#x27;Sullivan was Mayor of Limerick. Her religion twice became an issue in 1994, when she was prevented from opening a Christian Brothers School and from reading a lesson at a mass for Limerick&#x27;s civic week.

O&#x27;Sullivan was unsuccessful again at the 1997 general election, but after Kemmy&#x27;s death in September 1997, she was selected as the Labour Party candidate for the by-election in March 1998. She held the seat in a close three-way contest, becoming the first female TD from County Limerick since Kathleen O&#x27;Callaghan in 1921. Both the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael candidates in the by-election were also women.

===Labour: 2000s===
O&#x27;Sullivan was re-elected at the 2002, 2007 and 2011 general elections, and at the 1999 local elections became Limerick&#x27;s first alderwoman (as well as its last, as the title was abolished by the Local Government Act 2001).

In the 28th Dáil, she was the Labour Party Spokesperson on Justice and Equality and a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women&#x27;s Rights. In the 29th Dáil, she was vice-chair of both the Dáil Select Committee on Education and Science and the Joint Committee on Education and Science, as well as her party&#x27;s spokesperson on Education and Science.

After Labour&#x27;s failed to make gains at the 2007 general election, Pat Rabbitte resigned as leader and the outgoing deputy leader, Liz McManus, did not seek re-election. Eamon Gilmore was elected unopposed as leader, O&#x27;Sullivan stood for the deputy leadership, and was defeated by Dublin West TD Joan Burton, by 1,480 votes to 1,276. In a frontbench reshuffle on 16 September 2007, Gilmore appointed O&#x27;Sullivan as Spokesperson for Health.

===Government: 2011–2016===

On 10 March 2011, she was appointed by the Fine Gael–Labour government as Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with special responsibility for Trade and Development. On 20 December 2011, she was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government with special responsibility for Housing and Planning. She attended meetings of the cabinet, a position described as a &quot;super junior&quot; minister.

In July 2014, she was appointed Minister for Education and Skills. She continued the promotion of plurality in a church-dominated system by divesting schools of church patronage, and announced new multi-denominational schools under the patronage divesting process.

In March 2015, the government, with O&#x27;Sullivan the minister responsible, confirmed it would lock away for 75 years any statements it received from victims of child sexual abuse (almost twice the normal length). This decision was criticised by survivors.

===Opposition: 2016–2020===
O&#x27;Sullivan retained her seat in the 2016 general election, one of only seven Labour TDs to be elected. The party did not enter government, though O&#x27;Sullivan retained her position as Minister for Education and Skills until talks on government formation had concluded and the formation of a new government on 6 May 2016.

She lost her seat at the 2020 general election.

<doc id="1344446" wikidata="Q6212336" url="?curid=1344446" title="Joe Sherlock">
<text>Joe Sherlock (26 September 1930 – 10 September 2007) was an Irish Labour Party politician who served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 2002 to 2007, 1987 to 1992 and 1981 to 1982. He was a Senator for the Labour Panel from 1993 to 1997.

==Biography==
Sherlock was born in Kildorrery, County Cork, in 1930. He was educated at the local national school. He took part in the IRA&#x27;s Border Campaign as a young man, which resulted in him being imprisoned in Mountjoy Prison for six months. However, following the failure of the campaign, he endorsed the IRA&#x27;s and Sinn Féin&#x27;s move towards social activism and participating in politics. He worked at the local sugar factory for 18 years, and first held political office in 1967, when he was elected to Mallow Urban District Council as a Sinn Féin representative. During the split in Sinn Féin in 1970, Sherlock remained with the &quot;Official&quot; wing of the movement. In 1974, he was elected to Cork County Council. He served as Chairperson of Mallow UDC. He held both seats until the ending of the dual mandate in 2003. He was first elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1981 general election as a Sinn Féin - The Workers&#x27; Party TD.

Sherlock was re-elected at the February 1982 general election, but lost his seat at the November 1982 general election. Despite the loss of his seat, he continued to be active in local politics. He was elected to the Dáil again at the 1987 and 1989 general elections, but lost his seat at the 1992 general election. Joining the new Democratic Left party, he was elected to Seanad Éireann in 1993 (as part of an election pact with the Progressive Democrats), serving in the upper house until 1997. He failed to be elected to the Dáil again at the 1997 general election, but eventually regained his seat after ten years at the 2002 general election.

In July 2005, Sherlock announced that he would not be standing again in the next general election. His son Seán Sherlock, then a member of both Cork County Council and Mallow Town Council, was elected at the 2007 general election to succeed him.

He died on 10 September 2007, after a short illness.

<doc id="1344453" wikidata="Q1932103" url="?curid=1344453" title="Sudden Strike">
<text>Sudden Strike is a series of real-time tactics video games set during World War II. The series is developed by Fireglow based in Russia and published by CDV software of Germany and has been re-published by ZOOM-Platform.com. The player selects a faction (e.g. Soviets, Germans, or Allied forces) and gains control of many varied units such as infantry, tanks and artillery. The games focus primarily on tactics, eschewing traditional real-time strategy resource gathering and base development.

==Games==
===&quot;Sudden Strike&quot;===

The original &quot;Sudden Strike&quot;, released in 2000, included three campaigns (Soviets, Germans, and Allied forces). The battles are presented in an isometric perspective with line-of-sight occlusions and practical cover. &quot;Sudden Strike&quot; helped pioneer the real-time tactics genre, building upon concepts established by &quot;Counter Action&quot; for DOS, which was published by Mindscape in 1996.

===&quot;Sudden Strike 2&quot;===

&quot;Sudden Strike 2&quot; was also developed by Russian developer Fireglow and published by CDV and was released in 2002. The game has since undergone minor changes in its game engine and now features a higher resolution setting and other graphical changes. The campaign still involves the Soviets and Allies, against the Germans and a new country, Japan.

===&quot;Sudden Strike 3: Arms for Victory&quot;===

&quot;Sudden Strike 3&quot; is the third title in the series and the first to incorporate a 3D graphics engine. The game was released in 2007.

====&quot;Sudden Strike: The Last Stand&quot;====
&quot;Sudden Strike: The Last Stand&quot; was released in March 2009. It is an enhanced version of &quot;Sudden Strike 3&quot; which brings back a few features from &quot;Sudden Strike 2&quot;. The user interface is reworked in order to make it easier for players to control units and realize their tactics in the game.

===&quot;Warfare Reloaded&quot;===
In 2010, GFI Russia made &quot;Confrontation. 3D. Reboot&quot;, a spin-off of the series set in the modern day with the Russian Federation fighting both the USA and Taliban in a fictional 10-day conflict. 

For the Western release, the game was renamed to &quot;Warfare Reloaded&quot;, likely since it used the same engine as &quot;Warfare&quot;, with the &quot;Confrontation&quot; (or &quot;Sudden Strike&quot; in English) branding removed. 

===&quot;Sudden Strike 4&quot;===

&quot;Sudden Strike&quot; was released in 2017. It was developed by Kite Games and published by Kalypso Media for PlayStation 4 and PC. While the developers hoped to remain true to the spirit of other games in the series, new skill trees and commander roles were introduced as features.

<text>Richard Levis McCormick (born December 26, 1947) is an American historian and academic administrator. He has been the interim president of Stony Brook University since August 2024 and is president emeritus of Rutgers University, having served as president from 2002 to 2012.

==Early life and education==
The son of Richard Patrick McCormick, a Rutgers professor and administrator, and Katheryne C. Levis, a University administrator, Richard Levis McCormick was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey.

After graduating from Piscataway Township High School in Piscataway, New Jersey, McCormick earned his Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) from Amherst College in American studies (1969) and subsequently a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in History (1976) from Yale University.

==Academic career==

===Rutgers faculty===
McCormick served on the Rutgers University History faculty from 1976 to 1992, including three years as Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. He team-taught an American history course with his father, Richard P. McCormick. In 1985, he held a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship as well as a Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars Fellowship.

===UNC-Chapel Hill===
McCormick served as vice chancellor and provost at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1992 to 1995. His tenure was marked by the settling of a controversy over a proposed Black Cultural Center. More than a dozen students were arrested in a sit-in protest demanding construction of the facility, which opponents viewed as an attempt to create a separatist facility. McCormick won campuswide support by emphasizing the academic aspects of the center and helped initiate a fundraising campaign to build it. The Sonja Haynes Stone Center for Black Culture and History opened in 2004.

===University of Washington Presidency===
McCormick served as President of the University of Washington from 1995 to 2002. Although hampered by declining state funding, McCormick promoted undergraduate research and helped boost UW&#x27;s six-year graduation rate from 67 percent in 1995 to 72 percent in 2000. He launched an annual faculty bus tour to encourage the university to adopt a statewide perspective. Research funding and private giving reached record levels in McCormick&#x27;s tenure, but he was unable to prevent passage of a 1998 statewide initiative, I-200 Initiative 200, ending the university&#x27;s affirmative action programs.

When McCormick announced his intent to take a position at Rutgers, he became the first UW president in 50 years to leave for another university. McCormick&#x27;s departure from the University of Washington was prompted, in part, by pressure from the UW Board of Regents regarding an affair McCormick had with a coworker during his presidency.

===Rutgers Presidency===
McCormick took office as Rutgers president in December 2002 and stepped down in June 2012. His tenure was highlighted by two far-reaching initiatives: the reorganization and strengthening of undergraduate education on the university&#x27;s largest campus, New Brunswick, and the passage of state legislation to merge nearly all of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey into Rutgers.

In 2004, McCormick launched a campuswide discussion of the university&#x27;s responsibility to undergraduate students, insisting that they receive the full benefits of the university&#x27;s mission as a research university. In 2006, the university&#x27;s Board of Governors approved his plan to reorganize the undergraduate colleges on the New Brunswick campus into a School of Arts and Sciences and School of Environmental and Biological Sciences, eliminating contradictory admissions and curriculum standards among these undergraduate colleges and emphasizing faculty-student interaction. Some students and alumni criticized the plan, arguing that it sacrifices Rutgers&#x27; unique institutional history and culture. The plan went into effect during the 2007–2008 academic year.

In January 2011, McCormick praised the recommendations of the New Jersey Higher Education Task Force, which proposed merging Rutgers with the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and two other units of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. A year later, in January 2012, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and a medical-education advisory committee appointed by Christie endorsed the merger proposal but also called for the merger of Rutgers&#x27; Camden campus into Rowan University. The final bill maintained the Camden campus as part of Rutgers while increasing the number of UMDNJ units being absorbed into Rutgers to include all but University Hospital in Newark and the School of Osteopathic Medicine in Stratford. The legislation, signed by Gov. Christie and approved by the Rutgers governing boards in 2012, took effect July 1, 2013.

McCormick&#x27;s tenure was noted for his efforts to broaden and deepen the university&#x27;s connections with New Jersey. He targeted research areas of particular interest to the state (transportation, nutrition, homeland security, climate change), and in 2008 announced Rutgers Against Hunger , an initiative to stock food banks in the state, provide consumer education on nutrition, and help community organizations fight hunger. In 2009 he launched Rutgers Day , an annual public event highlighting Rutgers academic, research, cultural, and recreational programs.

In 2008, McCormick established the Rutgers Future Scholars Program in conjunction with a series of initiatives designed to increase the diversity of the university population. Each year, a new cohort of fifty rising eighth-grade students from each of the university&#x27;s host cities of Newark, Camden, New Brunswick, and Piscataway begins a five-year process of regular visits to campus, college preparation activities, and mentoring, with the guarantee of free tuition at Rutgers for all those who earn admission after high school. Of the first cohort of 183 students in the program, 163 enrolled in college in fall 2013, including 98 at Rutgers.

During McCormick&#x27;s presidency, the university&#x27;s annual budget grew from $1.3 billion to $2.1 billion despite declining levels of state funding. He made new investments in Rutgers’ campuses, responding to student demand for additional housing, classroom repairs, and renovated or expanded student-life facilities. The Rutgers School of Law–Camden opened a new facility in 2008, and the Rutgers Business School—Newark and New Brunswick moved into a new home at One Washington Park in Newark in 2009.

In 2007 McCormick announced plans for redevelopment of the Livingston Campus in Piscataway, New Jersey, focused on professional education; a 2008 anonymous gift of $13 million, the second largest private gift in Rutgers’ history, has been earmarked for a new business school facility on that campus. 

In 2006 he held an international design competition to “green” the College Avenue Campus in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Some detractors said the designs, including those of the winning firm, were too modern for the historic campus, but others praised the proposed use of open space and planned transportation improvements. McCormick suspended the greening project in 2009, citing budgetary problems:

&quot;All of the other projects that we bring to you for your approval — the dining hall on [Livingston] campus, the proteomics building and the Nelson [Biology Laboratories C-wing] all come with revenue streams…. There&#x27;s no revenue stream for the greening of College Avenue unless you charge students for walking past bushes and trees…. I regret this, but we have no other choice,&quot; McCormick said.

In 2012 he announced a multifaceted project that, contingent on the success of its proposed funding plan, would add an honors college, an academic classroom building, a residence hall, and a dining hall to the College Avenue Campus.

In 2010, McCormick launched a $1 billion university fundraising campaign titled Our Rutgers, Our Future: A Campaign for Excellence. Two-thirds of the campaign goal was raised during McCormick&#x27;s tenure, the largest donation being a $27 million gift for endowed professorships. 

On May 31, 2011, McCormick submitted his formal resignation to the university Board of Governors, which took effect June 30, 2012. McCormick&#x27;s successor effective September 1, 2012, Robert L. Barchi, was announced and appointed on April 11, 2012.

McCormick has returned to teaching history in Rutgers&#x27; Graduate School of Education. He wrote a book titled &quot;Raised at Rutgers: A President&#x27;s Story,&quot; which was published by the Rutgers University Press in October 2014.

===Stony Brook Presidency===

On July 16, 2024, the Office of President of Stony Brook University issued an announcement naming McCormick as interim President effective August 1.

==Personal life==
He is married to Joan Barry McCormick, a 1988 Rutgers alumna and professional fundraiser whose undergraduate degree is in journalism, with a master&#x27;s degree in public administration from Kean University. McCormick has three children, Betsy, Michael, and Katie. Two of them are from his previous marriage to Suzanne Lebsock, a retired professor of history at Rutgers. He had been married to Lebsock since 1984.

<text>William Marvin Dees (January 24, 1939 – October 24, 2012) was an American musician known for his songwriting collaborations with singer Roy Orbison.

==Career==
Born and based out of Borger, Texas, United States, Dees played guitar and sang with a band called The Five Bops doing his first recordings with Norman Petty at his Clovis, New Mexico studio in May 1958. They later became The Whirlwinds, gaining enough recognition to perform on an Amarillo, Texas radio station. Dees eventually made his way to Nashville, Tennessee, where his meeting with Roy Orbison led to a collaboration that produced a string of successful songs for Monument Records, including the hits &quot;Oh, Pretty Woman&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Over&quot;.

In 1967, Dees co-wrote all the songs for the Orbison album and MGM motion picture &quot;The Fastest Guitar Alive&quot;.

Beyond his work with Orbison, Bill Dees wrote hundreds of songs, a number of which were recorded by performers such as Johnny Cash, Loretta Lynn, Skeeter Davis, Glen Campbell, Billy Joe Royal, Frank Ifield, Mark Dinning, and Gene Pitney. In 2000, he recorded his own album titled &quot;Saturday Night at the Movies&quot;, a compilation of songs previously sung by Orbison that had been written with Dees and some that Dees had written alone.

Bill Dees lived in Ozark, Arkansas &amp; New Boston, Texas, for a number of years. There he continued writing and playing his music. Later he resided near Branson, Missouri, and continued to write songs with collaborator Jack Pribek until his death on October 24, 2012. He was living at a nursing facility in Mountain Home, Arkansas, at the time of his death.

<doc id="1344468" wikidata="Q6775299" url="?curid=1344468" title="Martin Dillon">
<text>Martin Dillon (born 2 June 1949) is an Irish author, journalist, and broadcaster. He has won international acclaim for his investigative reporting and non-fiction works on the Troubles, including his bestselling trilogy, &quot;The Shankill Butchers&quot;, &quot;The Dirty War&quot; and &quot;God and the Gun&quot;, about the Northern Ireland conflict. The historian and scholar, Dr. Conor Cruise O&#x27;Brien, described him as &quot;our Virgil to that Inferno&quot;. &quot;The Irish Times&quot; hailed him as &quot;one of the most creative writers of our time&quot;.

==Early life==

Martin Dillon was born in the Lower Falls area of West Belfast, Northern Ireland. He grew up with nine siblings in a traditional Catholic household. His mother, Maureen, looked after the children while his father, Gerard, worked as a watch maker and later telephone engineer to support his large family. Dillon attended St Finian&#x27;s Primary School on the Falls Road.

In 1961, aged twelve, he left Belfast to pursue a religious vocation at Montfort College Seminary in Romsey, Hampshire. The seminary was run by the Montfort Fathers, a French religious Order devoted to the teachings of St. Louis Marie de Montfort. After four years, he abandoned it and returned to Belfast to finish his studies at St Malachy&#x27;s College and St Patrick&#x27;s, Barnageeha. He attended Belfast College of Business Studies in 1970.

==Career==

===Early career===

===Investigative journalism and first non-fiction book===

Martin Dillon began his distinguished career as a newspaper reporter in 1968. He trained with &quot;The Irish News&quot;, a daily newspaper with a mainly Irish Nationalist readership, and contributed to its weekly publication, &quot;The Irish Weekly&quot;. He reported on a variety of events including those related to The Troubles in Northern Ireland.

In 1972, he joined the &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot;. Mackay, 2017 stated &quot;As an investigative journalist Dillon tried to reveal objectively the truth about the Northern Ireland Conflict. Under his forensic gaze, the cruelties and failings of all sides were exposed, whether they were Loyalist, Republican or British&quot;

Dillon valued his early years in journalism because of the challenges and unique experiences that later found expression in his non-fiction works. In 1973 Dillon published his first non-fiction book, &quot;Political Murder in Northern Ireland&quot;(co-authored with Denis Lehane). The content of the book is based on much of Dillon&#x27;s own journalistic research and reporting for the &quot;Irish News&quot; and &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot;.

===BBC years===

====Radio broadcaster, producer/writer, creator of programmes and TV shows====

In 1973, Dillon joined BBC Northern Ireland’s Newsroom as a News Assistant. In 1975, he became a Radio Arts producer and later ran the General Programmes Radio Department, which constituted the majority of BBC Radio Ulster&#x27;s output. In that role, he created the Behind the Headlines and Talkback programmes. Talkback broke the &quot;normal rules of broadcasting&quot;, over 31 years ago. In 2016, Talkback celebrated its thirtieth anniversary.

In 1985, while working as a producer of the &quot;Behind the Headlines&quot;, he persuaded SDLP leader, John Hume, and Provisional Sinn Féin President, Gerry Adams, to debate their political positions live on the programme. During the broadcast, John Hume agreed to meet the Provisional IRA&#x27;s Army Council. It was a controversial decision by him, but also a defining moment that led to open a dialogue with the Provisionals. The debate proved to be a seminal element in the genesis of the Northern Ireland peace process. Dillon also introduced John Hume to UDA paramilitary leader, John McMichael, credited with running assassination teams in Northern Ireland.

He was offered a contract to work as a producer/writer with BBC 2 award-winning documentary department, Timewatch. His role was to script and produce a major series on the Northern Ireland Troubles. After a year working with the Timewatch, he clashed with the BBC authorities and resigned, reaching a financial settlement.

During his 18 years work for the BBC, Dillon created and produced some award-winning TV programmes. &quot;A brilliant producer (for BBC Northern Ireland radio and TV), Dillon recruited talented outsiders and created iconoclastic programmes that brought people living in the most afflicted areas into furious dialogue on air with politicians, police chiefs, comedians and writers. He worked with Paul Muldoon, became friends with Denis Johnston and Seán Ó Faoláin&quot; (McKay, 2017).

Reviewing &quot;Crossing The Line&quot; &quot;Brave chronicler of the Troubles who made a point of crossing the line. Martin Dillon was always determined to uncover the truth of our sordid war AS far as I’m concerned, Martin Dillon changed the way the Troubles were reported.&quot; (Jordan, Sunday World, 17 September 2017)

Throughout his broadcasting career, Dillon was known for his abrasive style and controversial programming. He fought against the BBC’s interpretation of balance in its news and current affairs output. His views brought him a lot of frustration and disillusionment with the BBC narrow interpretation of the concept of balance, which left the BBC’s Current Affairs department vulnerable to political manipulation in the divisive atmosphere of Northern Ireland.

TV commentator, columnist, terrorism analyst and expert

In 1992 Dillon left the BBC to pursue his writing career. He subsequently became a terrorism analyst and commentator for Sky Television and other television and radio networks. In 1992, he presented a television documentary &quot;The Last Colony&quot; for Channel Four and RTÉ. It examined the origins of The Troubles, focusing on the confusing nature and failure of much of British policymaking of the period, especially of the Tory government led by Prime Minister Edward Heath. The documentary also contained some sensational revelations, including Heath’s secret declaration that it was legal for British soldiers to shoot protesters on the streets of Northern Ireland because they were &quot;enemies of the Crown&quot;. Later, it formed part of the evidence against Heath at the Bloody Sunday Tribunal in 2003. During that period Dillon published seven best-selling books on the Irish conflict and three plays for radio and television. He also contributed as a TV commentator and terrorism expert to several networks including BBC, RTÉ, Sky TV and Channel Four.

Notable Works

The Shankill Butchers

The Dirty War

God and the Gun

===Literary works and themes===

In his bestselling trilogy &quot;The Shankill Butchers&quot;, &quot;The Dirty War&quot; and &quot;God and the Gun&quot;, Dillon offers a balanced and objective perspective of the conflict, the participants and their motives. As the Irish Times put it &quot;Dillon is recommended reading for anyone wishing to understand the complexities of the British – Irish politics&quot;.
&quot;The Shankill Butchers&quot;&quot;, A Case Study of Mass Murder&quot;, 1989, is a study of Northern Ireland&#x27;s infamous Shankill butchers gang who preyed on Belfast Catholics. Dillon exposes the depravity of the UVF gang that was run by an aggressive psychopath, Lenny Murphy, with the help of one of his brothers. The gang performed unspeakable acts on helpless victims, killing them in a gruesome fashion. Dillon painstakingly interviewed countless civilians, paramilitaries and police officers in compiling the book. According to the Listener, &quot;the great value of Martin Dillon&#x27;s carefully researched and readable work is that it enters a world that few journalists have been inclined or able to penetrate&quot;.
&quot;The Dirty War&quot;, 1990, is a detailed account of the undercover struggle in which all sides fought a no-rules battle, using spies, informants, assassins, disinformation and terrorist agents. Dillon examines the roles played by the Provisional IRA, British Intelligence, including MI5 and Special Branch, British Military Intelligence, the Irish Government, and the British Army, and reveals disturbing facts about the way in which terrorists and the Intelligence agencies targeted, undermined and penetrated each other’s ranks. Within the pages of the book Dillon was one of the first to expose the IRA&#x27;s practice of executing and secretly burying some of its victims; a practice which subsequently led to public demands for the IRA to reveal the whereabouts of those it made &quot;disappear&quot;. He also unraveled the use of state-sponsored terrorism and the phenomenon of &quot;Rompering&quot;, a form of sadistic torture used by the paramilitaries.
&quot;Killer in Clowntown&quot; &quot; – Joe Doherty the IRA and the Special Relationship&quot;, 1992, is the tale of Joe Doherty, the convicted IRA gunman who captured American popular opinion by frustrating the British Government’s attempts to have him extradited from New York to Northern Ireland to serve a 30-year prison sentence for murdering a British Special Air Services Officer. Dillon traces Doherty’s terror history, providing personal insights into legal events inside the US Attorney’s office in New York. He unveils proof of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s secret intervention in the case, including how she told the Americans overseeing the Doherty case that she considered his extradition to Britain a quid pro quo for her allowing U.S. jets to use British airspace on the way to bomb Libya.

Dillon was asked by the Federal Court in New York to provide testimony about the inner workings of the IRA, based on his work &quot;The Dirty War&quot;. He agreed on condition he would be judged a &quot;friend of the court&quot; witness and not one seen to be supporting one or the other side in the case. In the end, he was not called to give evidence. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Dillon&#x27;s book demands the attention of anyone concerned about civil liberties in the United Kingdom…a catalogue of cynicism, lies, harassment, torture and murder that makes the Cold war duplicity a la Deighton and Le Carre seem positively endearing&quot;. 
In &quot;Stone Cold: True Story of Michael Stone and the Milltown Massacre&quot;, 1992, Dillon portrays Michael Stone, a natural born killer, infamous for his murder spree during an IRA funeral in Belfast’s Milltown Cemetery in March 1988. Stone, armed to the teeth, fired into the crowd of mourners, killing three men and wounding several others. His targets had been the Provisional IRA leaders present at the graveside, in particular Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness. Stone was captured and confessed to a list of other murders, which landed him a life sentence in the Maze Prison where he became a Loyalist icon. Drawing on conversations with Stone in prison, including correspondence with him, as well as on a network of contacts in the military and paramilitary world, Dillon provides a portrait of a charming, boastful, meticulous, sentimental and lethal killer. According to Time Out: &quot;Dillon brings his customary expertise to this latest expose of Government complicity in sectarian murder, and delves into the byzantine world of terrorist organization with impressive results&quot;.
In &quot;The Enemy Within: The IRA War Against the British&quot;, 1994, Dillon examines the IRA bombing campaign in Britain before and after the Second World War, and through to the 1970s and 80s. He analyzes the IRA&#x27;s flirtation with Nazism and how Éire&#x27;s wartime neutrality conditioned subsequent British policy towards Ireland. Dillon applies his extensive knowledge on the subject to provide new evidence of the political and military mistakes, which he argues, made British cities the most vulnerable in Europe to terrorist attacks. In fact, Dillon reveals for the first time the existence of what the IRA called its &quot;England Department.&quot; He explains why the British Government held secret talks with the IRA/ Sinn Féin amid the carnage of Warrington, and what was behind the IRA’s reluctance to denounce the Downing Street Declaration. It is his contention that the various Government agencies combating the IRA failed to eradicate the terrorist thread, leading to intrigue among them and to MI5 being given the sole responsibility for coordinating the war against the Provisionals. 
&quot;25 years of Terror: The IRA’s War against the British&quot;, 1996, is the revised edition of &quot;The Enemy Within&quot;, 1994. Dillon provides the first comprehensive survey of the IRA in Britain. According to &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;, UK: &quot;Dillon&#x27;s account is packed with new information and should be required reading. It is a serious study, well researched and competently written&quot;.
&quot;The Serpent’s Tail&quot;, 1995, is Dillon’s first novel, based on a true-life story set against a background of ordinary family life in Catholic West Belfast. Dillon traces the steps of two young Belfast Catholics recruited as informers, who found themselves at the heart of a &quot;sting&quot; involving the IRA, the SAS and MI5. The film script of the novel won European Script Fund award in 1995.
&quot;In God and the Gun – The Church and Irish Terrorism&quot;, 1997, Dillon explores the nexus of religion and paramilitarism. Dillon interviewed paramilitaries and religious figures to discern whether this is a religious war or one of economics and class. The interviewees included the late Billy Wright, a.k.a. &quot;King Rat&quot;, a notorious Protestant assassin killed by the INLA in prison in 1997, Protestant terrorist Pastor Kenny McClinton, and Fr. Pat Buckley who admitted breaking the seal of the confessional to save lives on both sides. According to &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;: &quot;Dillon has written an eye-opening book about a sometimes-incomprehensible sectarian situation&quot;.

In &quot;The Trigger Men&quot;:&quot; Assassins and Terror Bosses in the Ireland Conflict&quot;, 2003, Dillon delves into the dark and sinister world of Irish terrorism and counterterrorism. He analyzes the personalities of some of the most dangerous, professional and ruthless killers in Northern Ireland, their motivations and the bizarre crimes they committed. Their individual stories are told in gripping, unflinching detail. Dillon also exposes the ideology of the cult of the gunmen and the greed combined with hatred that motivated the assassins in their killing sprees. He presents penetrating insights into the mindset of terrorist Godfathers and their triggermen like the infamous Protestant assassin Billy Wright, the INLA leader Dominic McGlinchey, &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Johnny Adair, the UDA hitman, Michael Stone, and British terrorist agent, Brian Nelson.
Dillon co-authored with Rt. Hon. Roy Bradford &quot;Rogue Warrior of the SAS&quot;&quot;: A Biography of Col. &quot;Paddy&quot; Blair Mayne&quot;, 1987.
Lt. Col. &quot;Paddy&quot; Blair Mayne is regarded as one of the greatest soldiers in the history of military special operations. He is the most decorated fighting soldier of WWII, receiving four DSOs, the Croix de Guerre, and the Legion d’Honneur. He was one of the six founder members of the SAS and pioneered tactics used today by Special Forces units across the globe. His exploits against Rommel&#x27;s Desert forces and against the Nazis in Italy, France and Germany were legendary. His courage, initiative and wildness made him a giant among his men. He was, however, denied the ultimate accolade of the Victoria Cross because of his unorthodox rules of war and his resentment of authority.
In 2002, Dillon updated the new, revised edition &quot;Rogue Warrior of the SAS - the Blair Mayne Legend&quot;, 2003 for Mainstream publishing. Dillon added a postscript with new facts about Mayne&#x27;s conflicted personal life, in particular, his sexuality, which was a topic purposely omitted in the first edition of the book. Drawing on Mayne&#x27;s personal letters and family papers, SAS secret records (now declassified), his own war diaries and eyewitness accounts from many who served with him, Dillon presents a compelling and perceptive portrait of a very special warrior.

&quot;The Assassination of Robert Maxwell&quot;&quot;: Israel’s Superspy&quot;, 2002, (co-authored with Gordon Thomas) is a biography of media mogul, Robert Maxwell, who played a crucial role for Israel&#x27;s Mossad spy agency. The authors unveil explosive revelations about Maxwell’s links to global organized crime, and his schemes to access White House, 10 Downing Street, and the Kremlin, in order to obtain knowledge of highly guarded secrets for Israel. Drawing on private interviews with senior intelligence officers and other integral players, Dillon and Thomas examine the clues, contradictions and cover-up surrounding Maxwell&#x27;s sudden and suspicious death. Dillon, using his sources within East European intelligence agencies and the FBI, charts Maxwell&#x27;s secret activities in Eastern Europe, especially his personal ties to KGB bosses during the Cold War.
In his 2017 memoir &quot;Crossing the Line-My Life on the Edge&quot;, Dillon, according to the &quot;Irish Times&quot; &quot;details a life that&#x27;s involved many incredible moments: witnessing the horrors of the Troubles; encounters with major political figures and paramilitaries; rubbing shoulders with Irish literary greats; a successful broadcasting career, but one where he butted heads with BBC management; and having to leave Northern Ireland because of death threats. Dillon’s book is replete with such colourful stories involving the politicians, terrorists, artists and writers he met while covering the conflict in Northern Ireland&quot;.
&quot;The Squad&quot;, 1976, is one of the first plays about the Troubles. It was produced on BBC Radio 3 and BBC2 TV by Ronald Mason, the Head of BBC Radio 3 Drama department.
&quot;He has that unique knack of combining forensic historical fact-based research with the art of thriller-like writing. His books have accurately chartered the terror and the horror of recent Northern Irish history but always in a tone of compassion for the innocent victims caught up in conflict. Works like his &#x27;The Shankill Butchers&#x27; and &#x27;The Dirty War&#x27; stand the test of time and will be essential reading for generations to come for those trying to make sense out of the madness that was &#x27;The Troubles&#x27;&quot; (Henry McDonald; author, journalist and Ireland correspondent for &quot;The Guardian&quot;.)

==Personal life==

As a journalist and writer, Dillon’s life has been intertwined with the history of the Troubles and its darkest days. Because of his investigative work in Northern Ireland, Dillon received numerous death threats.

In 1992, he left Ireland with his family, moving first to England, before settling in France where he continued to write about the Irish conflict and publish bestselling books.

After his divorce from his wife, Katherine Dillon (2000), from whom he has a daughter Nadia Katherine Dillon, born in 1988, he visited New York at the invitation of his publisher, and while there, he decided to make New York his home. He went on to write and broadcast for news outlets in the U.S. and Canada, appearing on CNN, ABC, NPR and NBC as a guest and a global expert on terrorism and organized crime.

In 2003, he married, Violeta Kumurdjieva, a Bulgarian journalist and translator. In 2014, they moved from New York City to San Francisco Bay area, California, where Dillon continues to work on his journalism, television and book projects.

<text>Al-Muminun (, ; &quot;The Believers&quot;) is the 23rd chapter (sūrah) of the Qur&#x27;an with 118 verses (āyāt). Regarding the timing and contextual background of the supposed revelation (&quot;asbāb al-nuzūl&quot;), it is a &quot;Meccan surah&quot; during the end period, which means it is believed to have been revealed before the migration of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and his followers from Mecca to Medina (&quot;Hijra&quot;).

This surah deals with the fundamentals of faith (Aqidah), Tawheed (Islamic monotheism), Risalah (Messengership), Resurrection and the supreme Judgement of God. The surah drives these themes home by drawing attention to God&#x27;s creation of man through different stages in the mother&#x27;s womb, His creation of the heavens and the earth, His sending down rains and growing plants, trees and fruits, and His providing of domestic animals with various benefits for man, all together with an emphasis on the fact that man shall die and shall be raised up on the Day of Resurrection. (See also: Islamic eschatology)

The theme of Risalah is emphasized with reference to the accounts of some prophets of Islam such as Nuh (Noah), Hud, Musa (Moses) and Isa (Jesus), noting that all of them delivered the same message of monotheism, but were disbelieved and opposed by the people they preached to, and that all of them were helped and rescued by Allah. A reference is also made to the similar unbelief and opposition of the Meccan leaders to the message delivered to them by Muhammad. The Surah ends with another reference to the inevitability of the Day of Resurrection and pointing out that man will not have a second chance to return to the worldly life and make amends for his lapses and mistakes.

The Surah begins with an assertion, &quot;Most certainly the Believers have attained true success&quot;, intending to put across a point that the criterion of success and failure which people who disbelieve in Islam, hold in mind is in fact erred because it is based on misconceptions and is transitory and limited in nature, in turn leading to eventual failure and not true success.

On the contrary, those who follow the teachings of Islam taught by Muhammad, regarded by the disbelievers as failures are actually the ones who are truly successful. Because by their acceptance of the invitation to Islam, they are guaranteed of true success and everlasting bliss in this world as well as in the Hereafter. By rejecting the message of Islam, the non-believers have incurred a profound loss and would meet with the evil consequences both in this world and the next.

This is the main theme of the Surah and the whole discourse, from the beginning to the end, is meant to impress the same.

==Q23:1-11 Qualities of the believers==
The first eleven verses mention the desired qualities of the believers, they are blessed and will attain victory:

A brief translation of the first 11 verses is as follows:
:(1) The believers have indeed attained true success!
:(2) Those who pray humbly,
:(3) who shun idle talk,
:(4) who pay the prescribed alms,
:(5) who guard their chastity
:(6) except with their spouses or their slaves ––with these they are not to blame,
:(7) but anyone who seeks more than this is exceeding the limits––
:(8) who are faithful to their trusts and pledges
:(9) and who keep up their prayers,
:(10) will rightly be given
:(11) Paradise as their own, there to remain.

===2 Possess &quot;Al-Khushoo&quot;===
The first quality as described in verse 2 of this Surah is, &quot;Those who are humble in their prayers&quot;; the Arabic word used to describe the people is &#x27;Khashi&#x27;oon&#x27; meaning those of who possess &#x27;Al-Khushoo&#x27;.

According to Tafsir ibn Kathir, a classical Tafsir (i.e. a commentary of the Quran written by Islamic scholar Ibn Kathir), the Arabic word &#x27;Khushoo&#x27; encompasses the meanings of calmness, serenity, tranquility, dignity, and humility.&quot;, while Ibn Abbas explains &#x27;Khashi&#x27;oon&#x27; to mean, with fear and tranquility. Al-Khushoo is a necessary component of Salaah, however can be very easily lost. In a hadith, Muhammad said &quot;The first thing to be lifted up (taken away) from this Ummah will be al-Khushoo; until you will see n o one who has al-Khushoo.&quot;

To attain al-Khushoo one must forget everything about the world and concentrate in the prayer acts, reciting the Qur&#x27;an and thinking of the verses one reads and bearing death, grave and the torment in mind so that he never loses concentration. In his Tafseer, Ibn Kathir writes, &quot;Khushoo is gained by the fear of Allah and the sense that He is always watching.&quot; In another section he says, &quot;&quot;The site of al-Khushoo is in the heart and heart is the king of the limbs, so if one intends to pray wholeheartedly the limbs will follow the heart as Allah says (in the Qur&#x27;an): &#x27;And seek help in patience and Salaat and truly it is extremely heavy and hard, except for Khashi&#x27;oon.&#x27; The meaning is that the burden of prayer is heavy indeed; except for those who have Khushoo.&quot;&quot;

Regarding the same verse, i.e. &#x27;And seek help in patience and Salaat and truly it is extremely heavy and hard, except for Khashi&#x27;oon.&#x27;, Ibn Taymiyyah is of the opinion that &quot;This (verse) implies condemnation of those who are not Khashi&#x27;oon... Condemnation only applies when something obligatory is not done, or when something forbidden is done. If those who do not have Khushoo are to be condemned, this indicates that Khushoo is obligatory.&quot;

In his book titled &quot;Towards Understanding the Qur&#x27;an&quot;, Islamic thinker and philosopher Abul Ala Maududi cites a notion that &quot;&quot;Al-Khushoo of the heart is to fear and stand in awe of a powerful person, and al-Khushoo of the body is to bow one&#x27;s head and lower one&#x27;s gaze and voice in his presence. In Salaah one is required to show al-Khushoo, both of the heart and of the body, and this is the essence of this Islamic Prayer.&quot; It has been reported that when Muhammad once saw a person offering Salaah, as well as playing with his beard, he remarked: &quot;Had he khushu in his heart, his body would have manifested it.&quot;

Maududi then continues, &quot;&quot;Though al-Khushoo is actually a condition of the heart, as stated by the above tradition, it is manifested by the body as a matter of course. The Shariah has enjoined certain etiquette which, on the one hand, helps produce al-Khushoo in the heart, and on the other, helps sustain the physical act of the Prayer in spite of the fluctuating condition of the heart. According to this etiquette, one should neither turn to the right or left, nor raise one&#x27;s head to look up: one may, however, look around from the corner of the eye, but as far as possible, one must fix the gaze on the place where the forehead would rest in prostration; one is also forbidden to shift about, incline side ways, fold the garments or shake off dust from them. It is also forbidden that while going down for prostration, one should clean the place where one would sit or perform prostration. Similarly it is disrespectful that one should stand stuffy erect, recite the verses of the Qur&#x27;an in a loud resounding voice, or sing them, or belch or yawn repeatedly and noisily. It has also not been approved that one should offer the Prayer in a hurry. The injunction is that each article of the Prayer should be performed in perfect peace and tranquility, and unless one article has been completely performed, the next should not be begun. If one feels hurt by something during the Prayer, one may cast it aside by one hand, but moving the hand repeatedly or using both the hands for the purpose is prohibited. with this etiquette of the body, it is also important that one should irrelevant things during the Prayer. If thoughts come to the mind intention, it is a natural human weakness, but one should try one&#x27;s best and try to ensure with one&#x27;s utmost that the mind and heart are wholly turned towards Allah, and the mind is in full harmony and tune with the tongue, and as soon as one becomes conscious of irrelevant thoughts one should immediately turn the attention to the Prayer&quot;.&quot;

===3 Turn away from &quot;Al-Lagw&quot;===
The next quality gathered from verse 3 is that the believers turn away from &quot;Al-Lagw&quot;. The Arabic word &quot;Al-Lagw&quot;, as explained by Ibn Kathir. in his &quot;Tafseer&quot;, refers to falsehood, which encompasses all acts of sin, including the greatest of them i.e. Shirk in Islam, and any words or deeds that are of no benefit. In a Sahih hadith from the al-Tirmidhi collection of &quot;aḥadīth&quot;, Muhammad is reported to have said: &quot;Out of a person being a good Muslim is his leaving alone, what does not benefit him&quot;; while in the Sahih al-Bukhari (the Sahih of Muhammad al-Bukhari) he is also reported to have said &quot;Let he who truly believes in Allah and the Last Day speak good or be silent.&quot;.

In his &quot;Musnad Ahmed&quot;, Imam Ahmed has reported, &quot;The faith of a man cannot be straight unless his heart is straight, and his heart cannot be straight, unless his tongue becomes straight.&quot; It was from the manners of the Sahabah to speak very little, while Abu Dharr al-Ghifari said: &quot;Adopt silence, this is the way of causing Shaytan to run away; it is a supporter to you in the matter of your religion.&quot; Abd Allah ibn Mas&#x27;ud is reported to have said: &quot;By the One other than whom there is no God on this earth there is no one more deserving of long imprisonment that the tongue.&quot;

In another place, Surah 2:83 mentions that the covenant taken by Musa (i.e. Moses) from Bani Israel had also included the condition that they should indulge in good and worthwhile conversation, while being kind to parents, kindred, orphans and those in need, practice regular charity and to worship God alone. While, Sura 104:1-19 condemns those who are scandal/gossip-mongers and backbiters in strong terms, describing their punishment as &quot;Nay, but verily he will be flung to the Consuming One; And what will explain to thee what the Consuming One is! (It is) the Fire of (the Wrath of) Allah kindled (to a blaze), Which rises above the hearts. Surely it shall be closed over upon them, In outstretched columns.&quot;, thus hinting that believers need to steer clear of such acts.

===4 Pay the &quot;Zakat&quot;===
Verse 4 says that the believers pay &quot;Zakat&quot;, i.e. poor-due that is paid on one&#x27;s wealth. Commentators on the Qur&#x27;an, like Ibn Kathir are of the opinion that this verse could also be referring to the poor-due mentioned in Sura 6:141 which states &quot;pay the due thereof on the day of their harvest.&quot;, as well as that it could be that what is meant here by Zakaat is purification of the soul from Shirk and filth, as in Sura 91:9-10 which says &quot;Indeed he succeeds who purifies himself (Zakkaha). And indeed he fails who corrupts himself.&quot; The commentators are hence of the opinion that probably both meanings are intended, purification of the soul as well as purification of one&#x27;s wealth, because that is also part of the purification of the soul, and the true believer is one who pays attention to both matters.

Surah 9:60 lists those who are eligible to receive Zakaat by saying &quot;Alms are for the poor and the needy, and those employed to administer the (funds); for those whose hearts have been (recently) reconciled (to Truth); for those in bondage and in debt; in the cause of Allah; and for the wayfarer: (thus is it) ordained by Allah, and Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom&quot;, while Sura 17:26 commands the believers to &quot;Render to the kindred their due rights, as (also) to those in want, and to the wayfarer: But squander not (your wealth) in the manner of a spendthrift. &quot;

The believers are also advised to &quot;listen and obey and spend in charity&quot; for &quot;the benefit of your own soul&quot; and be from the ones who &quot;achieve prosperity&quot;, as mentioned in Sura 64:16.

===5-7 Avoid Zina, i.e. guard their chastity===
Verses 5 through to 7 of this Surah says &quot;And who guard their modesty; Save from their wives or the (slaves) that their right hands possess, for then they are not blameworthy; But whoso craveth beyond that, such are transgressors&quot;. Zina (extramarital sex) is one of the major sins in Islam concerning which stern warnings have been issued in the Qur&#x27;an as well as authentic &quot;aḥadīth&quot; attributed to Muhammad. In Surah 17:32, God says &quot;…come not near to Zina. Verily, it is Fahishah (immoral sin) and an evil way.&quot; The Qur&#x27;an also says that Homosexuality too is &quot;Haraam&quot; (sinful) and it is against the natural inclination which God has placed in man, whereby the male is inclined towards female and vice versa. In an authentic hadith from the Tirmidhi collection, Muhammad is reported to have said: &quot;There is nothing I fear for my Ummah more than the deed of the people of Lot.&quot;.

Surah 27:54-58 refers to the punishment that befell the people of Lut: &quot;And (remember) Lut when he said to his people, &#x27;Do you commit al-Fahishah (evil, great sin, every kind of unlawful sexual intercourse, sodomy) while you see (one another doing evil without any screen) Do you practice your lusts on men instead of women? Nay, but you are a people who behave senselessly.&#x27; There was no other answer given by his people except that they said: &#x27;Drive out the family of Loot from your city. Verily, these are men who want to be clean and pure!&#x27; So We saved him and his family, except his wife. We destined her to be of those who remained behind. And We rained down on them a rain (of stones). So evil was the rain of those who were warned.&quot; Muhammad has also thus said: &quot;Whoever of you finds (someone) doing the deed of the people of Lot, kill the one who does it and the one to whom it is done.&quot;

Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya is of the opinion that: &quot;Both of them - fornication and homosexuality - involve immorality that goes against the wisdom of Allah&#x27;s creation and commandment. For homosexuality involves innumerable evil and harms, and the one to whom it is done would be better off being killed than having this done to him, because after that he will become so evil and so corrupt that there can be no hope of his being reformed, and all good is lost for him, and he will no longer feel any shame before Allah or before His creation… The scholars differed as to whether the one to whom it is done will ever enter Paradise. There are two opinions which I heard Shaikh al-Islam (rahimahullah) narrate.&quot;

===8 Are faithful to their covenants===
The next verse, i.e. Sura 23:8 stresses on the quality trust that the believers&#x27; are to possess describing them as &quot;Those who faithfully observe their trusts and their covenants&quot;. A similar message is found in Sura 4:58 where the Qur&#x27;an ordains God&#x27;s command as, &quot;Verily, Allah commands that you should render back the trusts to those, to whom they are due…&quot;

The believers in Islam are thus ordered fulfill the terms and conditions of the trusts which are placed in their charge. The Arabic word &quot;al-Amanah&quot; (or &quot;al-Amanat&quot;) includes all kinds of trusts which are placed in their charge including those placed by God as well as those placed by the society or individuals. Similarly, the Arabic term &#x27;`ahd&#x27; encompasses all compacts, pledges, and promises made between God and man, and amongst men themselves. Muhammad would always impress the importance of the fulfillment of pledges in his addresses to the people. On one occasion he is reported to have said &quot;The one, who does not fulfill the terms of his trust, has no Faith, and the one, who does not keep promises and pledges has no Islam.&quot;&quot;.

Muhammad, in Sahih Muslim is also reported to have said &quot;The rights will be rendered back to those to whom they are due, and even the sheep that does not have horns will take revenge from the horned sheep.&quot; And on another occasion he is reported to have said &quot;Certainly, al-Amanah (the trust or moral responsibilities, etc. and all the duties which Allah has ordained) descended from the Heaven and settled in the roots of the hearts of the faithful believers, and then the Qur&#x27;an was revealed, and the people read the Qur&#x27;an (and learnt al-Amanah from it) and also learnt it from the Sunnah. (i.e. Both the Qur&#x27;an and As-Sunnah strengthen the faithful believers&#x27; &#x27;Amanah&#x27;).&quot;

Regarding the verse 8 from Surah Al-Mu’minoon, Tafsir ibn Kathir says &quot;When they (the Believers) are entrusted with something, they do not betray that trust, but they fulfill it, and when they make a promise or make a pledge, they are true to their word.&quot;

Four characteristics of a hypocrite

According to a tradition reported both by Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim, Muhammad is reported to have said: &quot;&quot;Four characteristics are such that if a person has all the four in him, he is beyond any doubt a hypocrite, and the one who has one of these, is a hypocrite to that extent till he gives it up:&quot;
*&quot;(a) When something is placed in his trust, he commits breach of the trust,&quot;
*&quot;(b) when he speaks, he tells a lie,&quot;
*&quot;(c) when he makes a promise, he breaks it, and,&quot;
*&quot;(d) when he has a quarrel with somebody, he exceeds all limits (of decency and morality)&quot;&quot;

===9 Strictly guard their Salaat===
In the next verse, i.e. verse 9, Allah mentions preserving of Salaah (the formal Islamic prayer) as one of the important characteristics of successful believers. Verse 2 implied the believers&#x27; humility during act of performing Salaah, while verse 9 refers to the individual prayers offered in their own times. Believers are described as those strictly adhering to the prescribed times, performing them with due regard to their pre-requisites, conditions and articles with clean body and dress, and necessary ablutions. Believers are required to not regard their prayers as an unnecessary burden, completing the task mechanically, but are to understand their recital while being conscious that they are supplicating like humble servants.

Prophet Muhammed is reported to have said &quot;The first duty that Allah, the Supreme, has ordained upon my nation is that of offering Prayer, and indeed Prayer is the first thing that will be taken account of on the Day of Resurrection.&quot; as well as &quot;Whoever keeps the Prayer established, has kept his religion established - and whoever leaves Prayer has demolished religion (i.e. left the fold of Islam)&quot;. While, the Qur&#x27;an makes it clear that the purpose for creation is to worship Allah alone, and that the most excellent way of praying is to offer Salaah standing before Allah in devout obedience. The Islamic Adhaan (call for prayer) which is recited at time of each prayer contains two verses (each recited twice) &quot;Hayya’ala-Salaah&quot; and&quot; &quot;Hayya’ala-Falaah&quot; &quot;which translate to&quot; &quot;Come to Salaah&quot; &quot;and &quot;Come to success&quot; respectively, indicating that by performing Salaah, one may attain eternal success.

In a Hadith reference, Abdullah ibn Mas&#x27;ud narrates &quot;I asked Allah&#x27;s Messenger, Prophet Muhammed: &quot;O Messenger of Allah, which deed is most beloved to Allah?&quot; He said: &quot;Prayer at the appointed time.&quot; I said: &quot;Then what?&quot; He said: &quot;Kindness to parents.&quot; I said: &quot;Then what?&quot; He said: &quot;Jihad (struggle) in the way of Allah.&quot;. Prophet Muhammed is also reported to have likened the Salaah to five daily baths that cleanse a person&#x27;s sins; Abu Huraira narrates that &quot;I heard Allah&#x27;s Apostle saying, &quot;If there was a river at the door of anyone of you and he took a bath in it five times a day would you notice any dirt on him?&quot; They said, &quot;Not a trace of dirt would be left.&quot; The Prophet added, &quot;That is the example of the five prayers with which Allah blots out (annuls) evil deeds.&quot;&quot;

The Qur&#x27;an has also pointed out that believers perform Salaah only to earn the pleasure of Allah and not to impress anyone else, calling anyone who does so a hypocrite. Moreover, those who abandon Salaah are warned of dire consequences, while only those who humbly submit themselves to Allah alone are said to have ease in offering it. In Surah Al-Ma&#x27;arij, Allah uses the word &quot;halu’an&quot; to describe the restless and impatient nature of man, stating that whenever he is afflicted with trouble he lacks patience and trembles in despair. This occurs due to shortcomings in his faith, whereas when he is given in abundance he becomes ungrateful towards Allah. He is also arrogant and uncaring towards those less fortunate than him. The Qur&#x27;an then assures the observance of Salaah as way to preserve hope in times of grievance and humbleness as well as humility in periods of bountiful life. Salaah thus has the power to erase the roots of evil deeds which bring barriers in the society giving birth to racial as well as financial discriminations and sinful intentions.

===Good news of paradise for the believers===
After mentioning the characteristics of the successful believer, God gives them the good news of &quot;Firdaus&quot; (Ajma&#x27; (عجماء)). Muhammad said: &quot;If you ask Allah for Paradise, then ask him for Firdaus, for it is the highest part of Paradise, in the middle of Paradise, and from it spring the rivers of Paradise, and above it is the (Mighty) Throne of the Most Merciful.&quot;

Abu Hurairah said: &quot;The Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alaihe wa-sallam) said: &quot;There is not one among you who does not have two homes; a home in Paradise and a home in Hell. If he dies and enters Hell, the people of Paradise will inherit his home, and this is what Allah said: &#x27;These are indeed the heirs.&#x27;&quot;

<doc id="1344477" wikidata="Q61136" url="?curid=1344477" title="Gottfried von Cramm">
<text>Gottfried Alexander Maximilian Walter Kurt Freiherr von Cramm (; 7 July 1909 – 8 November 1976) was a German tennis player who won the French Championships twice, so becoming the first non American, British, Australian or French player to win a singles slam title at the 1934 French Open, and reached the final of a Grand Slam singles tournament on five other occasions. He was ranked number 2 in the world in 1934 and 1936, and number 1 in the world in 1937. He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1977, which states that he is &quot;most remembered for a gallant effort in defeat against Don Budge in the 1937 Interzone Final at Wimbledon&quot;.

Von Cramm had difficulties with the Nazi regime, which attempted to exploit his appearance and skill as a symbol of Aryan supremacy, but he refused to identify with Nazism. Subsequently he was persecuted as a homosexual by the German government and was jailed briefly in 1938.

Von Cramm figured briefly in the gossip columns as the sixth husband of Barbara Hutton, the Woolworth heiress.

==Birth and childhood==

Third of the seven sons of Baron Burchard von Cramm (1874-1936), by his marriage to Countess Jutta von Steinberg (1888–1972), Cramm was born at the family estate, Castle Nettlingen, Lower Saxony, Germany and grew up in Castle Brüggen which also belonged to his family. A younger brother, Wilhelm-Ernst Freiherr von Cramm (1917–1996), was a German officer who was highly decorated during the Second World War, and who after the war was leader of the German Party, a conservative German political party. Through the mutual ancestry from the Cramm family, he was third cousin of Bernhard, Prince of the Netherlands.

Von Cramm began playing tennis around the age of ten after his right hand had recovered from an accident. That accident, which resulted in him losing the top joint of his index finger on his right hand, was the result of a horse who took more than just the sugar cube offered to him by the young von Cramm.

==Tennis career==
In 1932, Cramm earned a place in the German Davis Cup team and won the first of four straight German national tennis championships. During this time he also teamed up with Hilde Krahwinkel to win the 1933 mixed doubles title at Wimbledon. Noted for his gentlemanly conduct and fair play, he gained the admiration and respect of his fellow tennis players. He earned his first individual Grand Slam title in 1934, winning the French Open. His victory made him a national hero in his native Germany; however, it was by chance that he won just after Adolf Hitler had come to power. The handsome, blond Gottfried von Cramm fitted perfectly the Aryan race image of a Nazi ideology that put pressure on all German athletes to be superior. However, Cramm steadfastly refused to be a tool for Nazi propaganda. Germany effectively lost its 1935 Davis Cup Interzone Final against the US when Cramm refused to take a match point in the deciding game, by notifying the umpire that the ball had tipped his racket, and thus calling a point against himself, although no one had witnessed the error.
For three straight years Cramm was the men&#x27;s singles runner-up at the Wimbledon Championships, losing in the final to England&#x27;s Fred Perry in 1935 and again in 1936. The following year he was runner-up to American Don Budge, both at Wimbledon and at the U.S. Open. In 1935, he was beaten in the French Open final by Perry, but turned the tables the following year and defeated his rival, gaining his second French championship.

In addition to his Grand Slam play, Gottfried von Cramm is recalled for his deciding match against Don Budge during the 1937 Davis Cup. He was ahead 4–1 in the final set when Budge launched a comeback, eventually winning 8–6 in a match considered by many as the greatest battle in the annals of Davis Cup play and one of the pre-eminent matches in all of tennis history. In a later interview, Budge said that Cramm had received a phone call from Hitler minutes before the match started and had come out pale and serious and had played each point as though his life depended on winning. Ted Tinling, who served as the Player Liaison for the All England Club, recalled in his memoir that as he was in the process of ushering Budge and von Cramm out to Centre Court, they were interrupted by a long-distance call for von Cramm, and that following the call, von Cramm turned to him and Budge and said, &#x27;Excuse me, gentlemen, it was Hitler. He wanted to wish me good luck.&#x27; Others say that Budge believed a tale invented by Teddy Tinling that Hitler had telephoned Cramm before the match.

For his successful tennis career, he was decorated by the President of the Federal Republic of Germany with the Silver Laurel Leaf, Germany&#x27;s highest sports award.

==Imprisonment for same-sex affair==
Despite his enormous popularity with the public, on 5 March 1938, von Cramm was arrested by the German government and tried on the charge of a homosexual relationship with Manasse Herbst, a young Galician Jewish actor and singer, who had appeared in the 1926 silent film &quot;Der Sohn des Hannibal&quot;. After being hospitalized for a nervous collapse after his arrest, on 14 March von Cramm was sentenced to one year&#x27;s imprisonment Cramm admitted the relationship, which had lasted from 1931 until 1934 and had begun shortly before he married his first wife. He was additionally charged with sending money to Herbst, who had moved to Palestine in 1936. According to a report on the trial in &quot;The New York Times&quot; of 15 May 1938, the judge stated that &quot;Baron von Cramm had alleged that his wife, during their honeymoon, had become intimate with a French athlete. The court held that this experience had unsettled the young tennis star and had resulted in his seeking a perverse compensation for an unhappy married life.&quot; Although Cramm had confessed to an affair with Herbst once he was arrested, he later changed his confession to one of &quot;mutual masturbation&quot;, and his lawyer was able to convince the judge that Cramm had been forced into sending money to Herbst because Herbst was a &quot;sneaky Jew&quot;.

Cramm&#x27;s international tennis friends were outraged at his treatment. Don Budge collected the signatures of high-profile athletes and sent a protest letter to Hitler. His friend King Gustaf V of Sweden also pressured the German government to have him released. Cramm was released on parole after six months, and in May 1939 returned to competitive tennis. Cramm competed at the Queen&#x27;s Club Championships in London, where he won the event by beating American Bobby Riggs 6–0, 6–1. Officials at Wimbledon reportedly refused to let him play in their tournament, using the excuse that he was a convicted criminal and therefore unfit; &quot;The New York Times&quot;, however, quoted Wimbledon sources as saying that Cramm would have been welcome to participate, had he submitted an entry.

A further humiliation was Germany&#x27;s decision in 1940 to recall Cramm from an international tennis tournament in Rome before he had a chance to play.

== Connections to the German resistance ==
Cramm refused to become a party member of the NSDAP during the entire period of the National Socialist regime, although Hermann Göring, who was a member of the same tennis club, tried to persuade him several times. Because Cramm never mentioned Hitler during speeches on international trips, watched films critical of the regime, and privately spoke disparagingly of the National Socialists, he increasingly aroused the displeasure of the Nazis.

Von Cramm showed solidarity with the active resistance to Hitler in the last years of the war, using his travels as a tennis coach to Sweden to pass on confidential messages from the 20 July conspirators. After the failed assassination attempt, he expressed his desire to join another attempt. Since the resistance never reorganised after the 20 July plot, he never got the chance to turn his words into deeds.

==Wartime service and postwar career==
In May 1940, some months after the outbreak of the Second World War, Cramm was conscripted into military service as a member of the Hermann Goering Division. He saw action on the Eastern Front and was awarded the Iron Cross. Despite his noble background, Cramm was enlisted as a private soldier until being given a company to command. His company faced harsh conditions on the Eastern Front, and Cramm was flown out suffering from frostbite, with much of his company dead. Because of his previous conviction, he was dismissed from military service in 1942.

While the war robbed Cramm of some of his best years as a tennis player, he won the German national championship in 1948 and again in 1949, when he was 40 years old. He went on playing Davis Cup tennis until retiring after the 1953 season and still holds the record for the most wins by any German team member.

Following his retirement from active competition, Cramm served as an administrator in the German Tennis Federation. He was instrumental in reviving the Lawn Tennis Club Rot-Weiss in Berlin following World War II, and later served as its Chairman and President (1958-death). Von Cramm became successful in business as a cotton importer. In addition, he managed the landed estate he had inherited from his father in Wispenstein, in Lower Saxony.

==Marriages==
Gottfried von Cramm married:
* Baroness Elisabeth &quot;Lisa&quot; von Dobeneck (1912–1975), a daughter of Robert, Baron von Dobeneck (died in 1926) and his wife, the former Maria Hagen (1889–1943), a granddaughter of the Jewish banker . They married on 1 September 1930 and divorced in 1937. Lisa von Cramm later married the German ice-hockey star Gustav Jaenecke.
* Barbara Hutton, an American socialite and an heiress to the Woolworth five-and-dime fortune. The couple married in 1955 and divorced in 1959. He had married her in order to &quot;help her through substance abuse and depression but was unable to help her in the end.&quot;

==Death==
While on a business trip, Cramm and his driver were killed in an automobile accident near Cairo, Egypt, in 1976, when the baron&#x27;s car collided with a truck. Two roads were named in his honor, the Gottfried-von-Cramm-Weg in Berlin-Wilmersdorf, where the Rot-Weiss Tennis Club is located, and a similarly named road in the small town of Merzig.

Gottfried von Cramm was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1977.

In his 1979 autobiography, Jack Kramer, the long-time tennis promoter and a great player, included Gottfried von Cramm in his list of the 21 greatest players of all time. Cramm was the subject of a radio play, titled &quot;Playing for His Life&quot;, first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in June 2011. The play focused on the 1937 Interzone Davis Cup final and on Cramm&#x27;s personal life. Cramm&#x27;s story is featured at some length in the 2023 Netflix documentary &quot;Eldorado – everything the Nazis hate&quot;.

==Grand Slam singles performance timeline==

== Notes ==
:Writing in 1979, Kramer considered the best ever to have been either Don Budge (for consistent play) or Ellsworth Vines (at the height of his game). The next four best were, chronologically, Bill Tilden, Fred Perry, Bobby Riggs and Pancho Gonzales. After these six came the &quot;second echelon&quot; of Rod Laver, Lew Hoad, Ken Rosewall, Gottfried von Cramm, Ted Schroeder, Jack Crawford, Pancho Segura, Frank Sedgman, Tony Trabert, John Newcombe, Arthur Ashe, Stan Smith, Björn Borg and Jimmy Connors. He felt unable to rank Henri Cochet and René Lacoste accurately but felt they were among the very best.

<text>In the mathematical field of topology a uniform isomorphism or  is a special isomorphism between uniform spaces that respects uniform properties. Uniform spaces with uniform maps form a category. An isomorphism between uniform spaces is called a uniform isomorphism. 

==Definition==

A function formula_1 between two uniform spaces formula_2 and formula_3 is called a uniform isomorphism if it satisfies the following properties

* formula_1 is a bijection
* formula_1 is uniformly continuous
* the inverse function formula_6 is uniformly continuous

In other words, a uniform isomorphism is a uniformly continuous bijection between uniform spaces whose inverse is also uniformly continuous. 

If a uniform isomorphism exists between two uniform spaces they are called &#x27; or &#x27;.

Uniform embeddings

A is an injective uniformly continuous map formula_7 between uniform spaces whose inverse formula_8 is also uniformly continuous, where the image formula_9 has the subspace uniformity inherited from formula_10

==Examples==

The uniform structures induced by equivalent norms on a vector space are uniformly isomorphic.

<doc id="1344486" wikidata="Q903283" url="?curid=1344486" title="Culture of New York City">
<text>New York City has been described as the cultural capital of the world. The culture of New York is reflected in its size and ethnic diversity. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. Many American cultural movements first emerged in the city. Large numbers of Irish, Italian, Jewish, and eventually African, Latino, and Asian Americans also migrated to New York throughout the 20th century and continuing into the 21st century, significantly influencing the city&#x27;s culture and image. The city became the center of stand-up comedy in the early 20th century. The city was the top venue for jazz in the 1940s, expressionism in the 1950s and home to hip hop, punk rock, and the Beat Generation. Along with London, New York City is the global center of musical theatre, often referred to as &quot;Broadway&quot; after the major thoroughfare in Manhattan. The Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village, Lower Manhattan, is a designated U.S. National Historic Landmark and National Monument, as the site of the June 1969 Stonewall riots and the cradle of the modern gay rights movement.

The city is the birthplace of many cultural movements, including the Harlem Renaissance in literature and visual art; abstract expressionism (also known as the New York School) in painting; and hip hop, punk, salsa, freestyle, Tin Pan Alley, certain forms of jazz, and (along with Philadelphia) disco in music. New York has been considered the dance capital of the world. The city is also frequently the setting for novels, movies (see List of films set in New York City), and television programs. New York Fashion Week is one of the world&#x27;s preeminent fashion events and is afforded extensive coverage by the media.
New York has also frequently been ranked the top fashion capital of the world on the annual list compiled by the Global Language Monitor. Artists have been drawn into the city by opportunity, as the city government funds the arts with a larger annual budget than the National Endowment for the Arts, and New York is the center of the global art market, which grew up along with national and international media centers.

==Pace==
One of the most common traits attributed to New York is its fast pace, which spawned the term . Journalist Walt Whitman characterized New York&#x27;s streets as being traversed by &quot;hurrying, feverish, electric crowds&quot;.

==Department of Cultural Affairs==
The Department of Cultural Affairs (DCLA), a branch of the government of New York City, is the largest public funder of the arts in the United States. DCLA&#x27;s funding budget is larger than that of the National Endowment for the Arts, the federal government&#x27;s national arts funding mechanism. DCLA provides funding and support services to about 1,400 art and cultural organizations in the five boroughs, including 375 museums, 96 orchestras, 24 performing arts centers, 7 botanical gardens, 5 zoos and 1 aquarium. Recipients span many disciplines, including the visual, literary and performing arts; public-oriented science and humanities institutions including zoos, botanical gardens and historic and preservation societies; and creative artists at all skill levels who live and work within the city&#x27;s five boroughs. DCLA also administers the Percent for Art program, which funds public art at building sites. In fiscal year 2007, DCLA&#x27;s expense budget, used for funding programming at non-profits, was $151.9 million. Its capital budget, used to support projects at 196 cultural organizations throughout the city ranging from roof replacement to new construction, is roughly $867 million for the period between 2007 and 2011.

===Music===


Beginning with the rise of popular sheet music in the early 20th century, New York&#x27;s Broadway musical theater and Tin Pan Alley&#x27;s songcraft, New York became a major center for the American music industry. Since then the city has served as an important center for many different musical topics and genres.

New York&#x27;s status as a center for European classical music can be traced way back to the early 19th century. The New York Philharmonic, formed in 1842, did much to help establish the city&#x27;s musical reputation. The first two major New York composers were William Fry and George Frederick Bristow, who in 1854 famously criticized the Philharmonic for choosing European composers over American ones. Bristow was committed to developing an American classical music tradition. His most important work was the &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; opera, which most influentially used an American folktale rather than European imitations.

The best-known New York composer, indeed, the best-known American classical composer of any kind, was George Gershwin. Gershwin was a songwriter with Tin Pan Alley and the Broadway theatres, and his works synthesized elements of many styles, including the music of New York&#x27;s Yiddish theatre, vaudeville, ragtime, operetta, jazz and the post-Romantic music of European composers. Gershwin&#x27;s work gave American classical music unprecedented international recognition. Following Gershwin, the next major American composer was Aaron Copland from Brooklyn, who used elements of American folk music and jazz in his compositions. His works included the &quot;Organ Symphony&quot;, which earned him comparisons to Igor Stravinsky, and the music for the ballet &quot;Appalachian Spring&quot; and the &quot;Copland Piano Variations&quot;.

The New York blues was a type of blues music characterized by significant jazz influences and a more modernized, urban feel than the country blues. Prominent musicians from this field include Lionel Hampton and Big Joe Turner. In New York, jazz became fused with stride (an advanced form of ragtime) and became highly evolved. Among the first major New York jazz musicians was Fletcher Henderson, whose jazz orchestra, first appearing in 1923, helped invent swing music. The swing style that developed from New York&#x27;s big jazz bands was catchy and very danceable, and was originally played largely by black orchestras. Later, white bands led by musicians like Jimmy Dorsey and Benny Goodman began to dominate and produced a number of instrumentalists that had a profound effect on the later evolution of jazz. Star vocalists also emerged, mainly women like the bluesy Billie Holiday and the scat singer Ella Fitzgerald.

Beginning in the 1940s, New York was the center of a roots revival in American folk music. Many New Yorkers developed a renewed interest in blues, Appalachian folk music and other roots styles. Greenwich Village, in Lower Manhattan, became a hotbed of American folk music as well as leftist political activism. The performers associated with the Greenwich Village scene had sporadic mainstream success in the 1940s and 1950s; some, like Pete Seeger and the Almanac Singers, did well, but most were confined to local coffeehouses and other venues. Performers like Dave Van Ronk and Joan Baez helped expand the scene by appealing to university students. In the early 1960s, Baez was instrumental in introducing the up-and-coming young folk artist Bob Dylan to her audience and he quickly achieved national prominence. By the mid-1960s, folk and rock were merging, with Bob Dylan taking the lead in July 1965, releasing &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;, with a distinctive, revolutionary rock sound for its time, steeped in tawdry New York imagery, followed by an electric performance in late July at the Newport Folk Festival. Dylan plugged an entire generation into the milieu of the singer-songwriter, often writing from an urban, distinctly New York point of view. By the mid to late 1960s, bands and singer-songwriters began to proliferate the underground New York art and music scene. The release of &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot; in 1967, featuring singer-songerwriter Lou Reed and German singer and collaborator Nico was described as &quot;most prophetic rock album ever made&quot; by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2003.

Other New York based singer-songwriters began to emerge, using the urban landscape as their canvass, a backdrop for lyrics in the confessional style of poets like Anne Sexton and Sylvia Plath. In July 1969, &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine ran a feature story, &quot;The Girls-Letting Go,&quot; describing the groundbreaking music of Joni Mitchell, Laura Nyro, Lotti Golden and Melanie, as a new breed of female troubadour: &quot;what is common to them are the personalized songs they write, like voyages of self discovery, brimming with keen observation and startling in the impact of their poetry.&quot; The work of these early New York based singer-songwriters, from Laura Nyro&#x27;s &quot;New York Tendaberry&quot; (1969), to Lotti Golden&#x27;s East Village diaries on &quot;Motor-Cycle&quot; her 1969 debut on Atlantic Records, has served as inspiration to generations of female singer-songwriters in the rock, folk and jazz traditions.
Disco music developed from the funk, soul and jazz of the 1960s, becoming a distinct genre of music, eschewing the raw sound of a four piece garage band and embracing a new technology that employed driving synthesizers with booming a bass drum that defined the disco sound with a steady quarter note beat, or Four on the floor (music). It was not unusual for producers to contract local symphony and philharmonic orchestras as well as session musicians to further refine the sound. Disco, a musical idiom that was strongly associated with minorities (primarily black and gay audiences), became a phenomenon in dance clubs and discothèques in the 1970s. Many of the major disco nightclubs were in New York, including Paradise Garage, Danceteria and Studio 54, attracting notable followers from the art world, such as Andy Warhol, the fashion industry like Karl Lagerfeld, as well as socialites, musicians and intellectuals. This tradition continued in the 1980s with Area, Danceteria, and Limelight.

In the 1970s, punk rock emerged in New York&#x27;s downtown music scene with seminal bands such as the New York Dolls, Ramones and Patti Smith. Anthrax and KISS were the best known heavy metal and glam rock performers from the city. The downtown scene developed into the &quot;new wave&quot; style of rock music at downtown clubs like CBGB&#x27;s. The 1970s were also when the Salsa and Latin Jazz movements grew and branched out to the world. Labels such as the &quot;Fania All Stars&quot;, musicians like Tito Puente and Celia Cruz and Ralph Mercado, the creator of the RM&amp;M record label, all contributed to stars like Hector LaVoe, Ruben Blades and many others. The New Yorican Sound, differed somewhat from Salsa that came from Puerto Rico, it was being sung by Puerto Rican Americans from New York and had the swagger of the Big Apple.

Hip hop first emerged in the Bronx in the early 1970s at neighborhood block parties when DJs, like DJ Kool Herc, began isolating percussion breaks in funk and R&amp;B songs and rapping while the audience danced. For many years, New York was the only city with a major hip-hop scene, and all of the early recordings came from New York. People like Kurtis Blow and LL Cool J brought hip hop to the mainstream for the first time, while so-called East Coast rap was defined in the 1980s by artists including Eric B. &amp; Rakim, Kurtis Blow and Run-D.M.C. Major New York stars emerged to go on and produce multi-platinum records, including Puff Daddy, Jay-Z and The Notorious B.I.G., along with acts like Wu-Tang Clan, Nas, Big L, and Busta Rhymes.

New York is also one of only five cities in the United States with permanent professional resident companies in all of the major performing arts disciplines: The Metropolitan Opera, New York Philharmonic, New York City Ballet, and the Public Theater. The Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, actually a complex of buildings housing 12 separate companies, is the largest arts institution in the world. It is also home to the internationally renowned Jazz at Lincoln Center. Other notable performance halls include Carnegie Hall, Radio City Music Hall, and the Brooklyn Academy of Music.

With nearly 8 million people riding the city&#x27;s subway system each day, New York&#x27;s transit network is also a major venue for musicians. Each week, more than 100 musicians and ensembles – ranging in genre from classical to Cajun, bluegrass, African, South American and jazz – give over 150 performances sanctioned by New York Transit at 25 locations throughout the subway system.

===Visual art===

The 1913 Armory Show in New York, an exhibition which brought European modernist artists&#x27; work to the U.S., both shocked the public and influenced art making in the United States for the remainder of the twentieth century. The exhibition had a twofold effect of communicating to American artists that artmaking was about expression, not only aesthetics or realism, and at the same time showing that Europe had abandoned its conservative model of ranking artists according to a strict academic hierarchy. This encouraged American artists to find a personal voice, and a modernist movement, responding to American civilization, emerged in New York. Alfred Stieglitz (1864–1946), photographer, Charles Demuth (1883–1935) and Marsden Hartley (1877–1943), both painters, helped establish an American viewpoint in the fine arts. Stieglitz promoted cubists and abstract painters at his 291 Gallery on 5th Avenue. The Museum of Modern Art, founded in 1929, became a showcase for American and international contemporary art. By the end of World War II, Paris had declined as the world&#x27;s art center while New York emerged as the center of contemporary fine art in both the United States and the world.

In the years after World War II, a group of young New York artists known as the New York School formed the first truly original school of painting in America that exerted a major influence on foreign artists: abstract expressionism. Among the movement&#x27;s leaders were Jackson Pollock (1912–1956), Willem de Kooning (1904–1997), and Mark Rothko (1903–1970). The abstract expressionists abandoned formal composition and representation of real objects to concentrate on instinctual arrangements of space and color and to demonstrate the effects of the physical action of painting on the canvas.

New York&#x27;s vibrant visual art scene in the 1950s and 1960s also defined the American pop art movement. Members of this next artistic generation favored a different form of abstraction: works of mixed media. Among them were Jasper Johns (1930– ), who used photos, newsprint, and discarded objects in his compositions. Pop artists, such as Andy Warhol (1930–1987), Larry Rivers (1923–2002), and Roy Lichtenstein (1923–1997), reproduced, with satiric care, everyday objects and images of American popular culture—Coca-Cola bottles, soup cans, comic strips.

Today New York is a global center for the international art market. The Upper East Side has many art galleries, and the downtown neighborhood of Chelsea is known for its more than 200 art galleries that are home to modern art from both upcoming and established artists. The industry is also present in neighborhoods known for their art galleries such as DUMBO, where dealers representing both established and up-and-coming artists compete for sales with bigger exhibition spaces, better locations, and stronger connections to museums and collectors. Wall Street money and funds from philanthropists flow steadily into the art market, often prompting artists to move from gallery to gallery in pursuit of riches and fame.

Enriching and countering this mainstream commercial movement is the constant flux of underground movements, such as hip-hop art and graffiti, which engendered such artists as Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat, and continue to add visual texture and life to the atmosphere of the city.

Long Island City, Queens is a rapidly flourishing art scene in New York, serving as home to the largest concentration of arts institutions outside of Manhattan. Its abundance of industrial warehouses provide ample studio and exhibition space for many renowned artists, museums and galleries.

====Public art====

New York has a law that requires no less than 1% of the first twenty million dollars of a building project, plus no less than one half of 1% of the amount exceeding twenty million dollars be allocated for art work in any public building that is owned by the city. The maximum allocation for any site is $400,000.

Many major artists have created public works in the city, including Jeff Koons, Louise Bourgeois, Nam June Paik, and Jim Power the &quot;Mosaic Man.&quot; Anish Kapoor&#x27;s &quot;Sky Mirror&quot;, a highly reflective stainless steel dish nearly three stories tall, was on view at Rockefeller Center in September and October 2006.

In 2005 Christo and Jeanne-Claude installed &quot;The Gates&quot;, a site-specific art project inspired by traditional Japanese torii gates. The installation consisted of 7,503 metal &quot;gates&quot; along 23 miles (37 km) of pathways in Central Park. From each gate hung a flag-shaped piece of saffron-colored nylon fabric.

The subway system also hosts several public art projects, including intricate tile mosaics and station signage.

Subversive public art trends have also coursed through New York. Toward the end of the 1960s the modern American graffiti subculture began to form in Philadelphia, south of New York. By 1970, the center of graffiti innovation moved from Philadelphia to New York, where the graffiti art subculture inspired an artistic style and social philosophy dubbed &quot;Zoo York.&quot; The name originated from a subway tunnel running underneath the Central Park Zoo that was the haunt of very early &quot;oldschool&quot; graffiti writers like ALI (Marc André Edmonds), founder of The Soul Artists. The subway tunnel became a scene where crews of Manhattan graffiti artists gathered at night. With greater law enforcement and aggressive cleaning of subway trains in the 1980s and 1990s, the graffiti movement in New York eventually faded from the subway.

==Film==

New York&#x27;s film industry is smaller than that of Hollywood, but its billions of dollars in revenue makes it an important part of the city&#x27;s economy and places it as the second largest center for the film industry in the United States.

New York was an epicenter of filmmaking in the earliest days of the American film industry, but the better year-round weather of Hollywood eventually saw California becoming the home of American cinema. The Kaufman-Astoria film studio in Queens, built during the silent film era, was used by the Marx Brothers and W. C. Fields. As cinema moved west, much of the motion picture infrastructure in New York was used for the burgeoning television industry. Kaufman-Astoria eventually became the set for &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; and &quot;Sesame Street&quot;.

New York has undergone a renaissance in film-making with 276 independent and studio films in production in the city in 2006, an increase from 202 in 2004 and 180 in 2003. More than a third of professional actors in the United States are based in New York.

One of the filmmakers most associated with New York is Woody Allen, whose films include &quot;Annie Hall&quot; and &quot;Manhattan&quot;. Other New Yorkers in film include the actor Robert De Niro, who started the Tribeca Film Festival after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, and the directors Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, Spike Lee, Jim Jarmusch, Joel and Ethan Coen, and many others.

While major studio productions are based in Hollywood, New York has become a capital of independent film. The city is home to a number of important film festivals, including the Tribeca Film Festival, the New York Film Festival and the Human Rights Watch Film Festival, as well as major independent film companies like Miramax Films. New York is also home to the Anthology Film Archives, which preserves and exhibits hundreds of avant-garde works from the entire span of film history.

The oldest public-access television in the United States is the Manhattan Neighborhood Network, well known for its eclectic local programming that ranges from a jazz hour to discussion of labor issues to foreign language and religious programming. There are eight other Public, educational, and government access (PEG) cable TV channels in New York, including Brooklyn Cable Access Television.

New York&#x27;s municipally owned broadcast television service, NYC Media, creates original programming that includes Emmy Award-winning shows like &quot;Blue Print New York&quot; and &quot;Cool in Your Code&quot;, as well as coverage of New York City government. Other popular programs on NYC TV include music shows; &quot;New York Noise&quot; showcases music videos of local, underground, and indie rock musicians as well as coverage of major music-related events in the city like the WFMU Record Fair, interviews of New York icons (like The Ramones and Klaus Nomi), and comedian hosts (like Eugene Mirman, Rob Huebel, and Aziz Ansari). &quot;The Bridge&quot;, similarly, chronicles old school hip hop. The channel has won 14 New York Emmys and 14 National Telly awards.

===Dance===

The early 20th century saw the emergence of modern dance in New York, a new, distinctively American art form. Perhaps the best known figure in modern dance, Martha Graham, was a pupil of pioneer Ruth St. Denis. Many of Graham&#x27;s most popular works were produced in collaboration with New York&#x27;s leading composers – &quot;Appalachian Spring&quot; with Aaron Copland, for example. Merce Cunningham, a former ballet student and performer with Martha Graham, presented his first New York solo concert with John Cage in 1944. Influenced by Cage and embracing modernist ideology using postmodern processes, Cunningham introduced &quot;chance procedures&quot; and &quot;pure movement&quot; to choreography and &quot;Cunningham technique&quot; to the cannon of 20th century dance techniques. Cunningham set the seeds for postmodern dance with his non-linear, non-climactic, non-psychological abstract work. In these works each element is in and of itself expressive, and the observer determines what it communicates. George Balanchine, one of the 20th century&#x27;s foremost choreographers and the first pioneer of contemporary ballet, formed a bridge between classical and modern ballet. Balanchine used flexed hands (and occasionally feet), turned-in legs, off-centered positions and non-classical costumes to distance himself from the classical and romantic ballet traditions. Balanchine also brought modern dancers in to dance with his company, the New York City Ballet; one such dancer was Paul Taylor, who in 1959 performed in Balanchine&#x27;s piece &quot;Episodes&quot;. Another significant modern choreographer, Twyla Tharp, choreographed &quot;Push Comes To Shove&quot; for the American Ballet Theatre under Mikhail Baryshnikov&#x27;s artistic directorship in 1976; in 1986 she created &quot;In The Upper Room&quot; for her own company. Both these pieces were considered innovative for their use of distinctly modern movements melded with the characteristics of contemporary ballet such as the use of pointe shoes and classically trained dancers.

New York has also historically been a center for African-American modern dance. Alvin Ailey, a student of Lester Horton (and later Martha Graham), spent several years working in both concert and theatre dance. In 1958 Ailey and a group of young African-American dancers formed the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater performs annually at City Center Theater in New York. Ailey drew upon his memories of Texas, the blues, spirituals and gospel as inspiration. Bill T. Jones, winner of a MacArthur &quot;Genius&quot; Award in 1994, choreographed for the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, among others. Another significant African-American dancer, Pearl Primus, made her debut on February 24, 1943, at the 92nd Street Y as a social-protest dancer. Her concerns and expression fit into the landscape of the ongoing Harlem renaissance and gained much public support, and was immediately graced with attention after her first professional solo debut. Her dances were inspired by revolutionary African-American choreographer Katherine Dunham. Primus became known for her singular ability to jump very high while dancing. She focused on matters such as oppression, racial prejudice, and violence.

New York was the birthplace of other dance forms, as well. Breakdance became an influential street dance style that emerged as part of the Hip Hop Movement in African-American and Puerto Rican communities in the South Bronx in the early 1970s. It is arguably the best known of all hip hop dance styles. Popular speculations of the early 1980s suggest that breakdancing, in its organized fashion seen today, began as a method for rival gangs of the ghetto to mediate and settle territorial disputes. In a turn-based showcase of dance routines, the winning side was determined by the dancers who could outperform the other by displaying a set of more complicated and innovative moves. It later was through the highly energetic performances of the late funk legend James Brown and the rapid growth of dance teams, like the Rock Steady Crew of the Bronx, that the competitive ritual of gang warfare evolved into a pop-culture phenomenon receiving massive media attention. Parties, disco clubs, talent shows, and other public events became typical locations for breakdancers, including gang members for whom dancing served as a positive diversion from the threats of city life.

Tap Dance, and American Born Art Form, first took place in New York in the Five Points District.

===Theatre===

The advent of electric lighting led to elaborate theatre productions, and in the 1880s New York theaters on Broadway and along 42nd Street began to showcase a new stage form that came to be known as the Broadway musical. Strongly influenced by the feelings of immigrants to the city, these productions used song in narratives that often reflected themes of hope and ambition.

Many musicals in New York became seminal national cultural events, like the controversial 1937 staging of Marc Blitzstein&#x27;s labor union opera &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot;, directed by Orson Welles and produced by John Houseman. Originally to open at the Maxine Elliott Theatre with elaborate sets and a full orchestra, the production was shut down on opening night, and Welles, Housman, and Blitzstein scrambled to rent the Venice Theatre twenty blocks north. The crowds gathered to see the production walked up 7th Avenue, and by nine o&#x27;clock the Venice Theatre&#x27;s 1,742 seats were sold out. Blitzstein began performing the musical solo, but after beginning the first number he was joined by cast members, who were forbidden by the Actor&#x27;s Union to perform the piece &quot;onstage&quot;, from their seats in the audience. Blitzstein and the cast performed the entire musical from the house. Many who attended the performance, including poet Laureate Archibald MacLeish, thought it to be one of the most moving theatrical experiences of their lives. Performances of the musical to this day rarely use elaborate sets or an orchestra in homage to this event.
Houseman and Wells went on to found the Mercury Theatre and do radio drama, in which they performed one of the most notable radio broadcasts of all time, &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;.

Many New York playwrights, including Elia Kazan and Arthur Miller, became icons in American theater.

Professional Yiddish theatre in New York, a major cultural influence in the city, began in 1882 with a troupe founded by Boris Thomashefsky, an immigrant from Ukraine. The plays in the late 19th century were realistic, while in the beginning of the 20th century, they became more political and artistic in orientation. Some performers were well-respected enough to move back and forth between the Yiddish theatre and Broadway, including Bertha Kalich and Jacob Adler. Some of the major composers included Abraham Goldfaden, Joseph Rumshinsky and Sholom Secunda, while playwrights included David Pinski, Solomon Libin, Jacob Michailovitch Gordin and Leon Kobrin.

Concurrently with Yiddish theatre was the development of Vaudeville (a term thought to be a corruption of the old French word &quot;vaudevire&quot;, meaning an occasional or topical light popular song), a style of multi-act theatre which flourished from the 1880s through to the 1920s. An evening&#x27;s schedule of performances (or &quot;bill&quot;) could run the gamut from acrobats to mathematicians, from song-and-dance duos and Shakespeare to animal acts and opera. The usual date given for the &quot;birth&quot; of vaudeville is October 24, 1881, the night during which variety performer and theatre owner Tony Pastor, in his effort to lure women into the male-dominated variety hall, famously staged the first bill of self-proclaimed &quot;clean&quot; vaudeville in New York. African American audiences had their own Vaudeville circuits, as did speakers of Italian and Yiddish. The Palace Theatre on Broadway, described by its owner, Martin Beck, as &quot;the Valhalla of vaudeville&quot; opened with vaudeville shows from the Keith Circuit and lured the best and brightest in vaudeville. Its shift to a full bill of movies on November 16, 1932, is generally regarded as the death of vaudeville.

Today the 39 largest theatres (with more than 500 seats) in New York are collectively known as &quot;Broadway&quot; after the major thoroughfare through the Theater District, and are mostly located in the Times Square vicinity. Many Broadway shows are world-famous, such as the musicals &quot;Cats&quot; and &quot;The Phantom of the Opera.&quot; Along with those of London&#x27;s West End, theaters in New York&#x27;s Broadway district are often considered to be the most professional in the English language.

Smaller theatres, termed off Broadway and off-off-Broadway depending on their size, have the flexibility to produce more innovative shows for smaller audiences. An important center of the American theatre avant-garde, New York has been host to such seminal experimental theatre groups as The Wooster Group and Richard Foreman&#x27;s Ontological-Hysteric Theater.

The subways of New York are also occasional venues for beauty pageants and guerrilla theater. The MTA&#x27;s annual Miss Subways contest ran from 1941 to 1976 and again in 2004 (under the revised name &quot;Ms Subways&quot;). Past Miss Subways winners include Eleanor Nash, an FBI clerk described by her poster that hung in subway cars in 1960 as &quot;young, beautiful and expert with a rifle.&quot; The 2004 Ms Subways winner, Caroline Sanchez-Bernat, was an actress who played a role in &quot;Sunday Brunch 4&quot;. The 35-minute piece of performance art was a full enactment of a Sunday brunch — including crisp white tablecloth, spinach salad appetizer and attentive waiter in black tuxedo — performed aboard a southbound A train in 2000. With subway riders looking on, the actors chatted amiably about Christmas, exchanged gifts and signed for a package delivered by a United Parcel Service delivery man who entered the scene at the West 34th Street stop.

===Stand-up comedy===
New York is considered by many to be the heart of stand-up comedy in the United States. The city is home to a number of leading comedy clubs including Caroline&#x27;s.

==Literature==

===Novels===

Several important movements originated in New York. One of the first American writers to gain critical acclaim in Europe, Washington Irving, was a New Yorker whose &quot;History of New York&quot; (1809) became a cultural touchstone for Victorian New York. Diedrich Knickerbocker, an old-fashioned Dutch New Yorker in Irvin&#x27;s satire of chatty and officious logistical history, made &quot;Knickerbocker&quot; a bye-word for quaint Dutch-descended New Yorkers, with their old-fashioned ways and their long-stemmed pipers and knee-breeches long after the fashion had turned to trousers. This served as the inspiration for the New York Knicks&#x27;s moniker, whose corporate name is the &quot;New York Knickerbockers.&quot;

The Harlem Renaissance established the African-American literary canon in the United States. The zenith of this &quot;&quot;flowering of Negro literature&quot;,&quot; as James Weldon Johnson called it, was between 1924, when &quot;Opportunity&quot; magazine hosted a party for black writers where many white publishers were in attendance, and the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the start of the Great Depression. African-Americans of the northward Great Migration and African and Caribbean immigrants converged in Harlem, which became the most famous center of Negro life in the United States at that time. A militant black editor indicated in 1920 that &quot;the intrinsic standard of Beauty and aesthetics does not rest in the white race&quot; and that &quot;a new racial love, respect, and consciousness may be created.&quot; The work of black Harlem writers sought to challenge the pervading racism of the larger white community and often promoted progressive or socialist politics and racial integration. No singular style emerged; instead there was a mix ranging from the celebration of Pan-Africanism, &quot;high-culture&quot; and &quot;street culture,&quot; to new experimental forms in literature like modernism, to Classical music and improvisational jazz that inspired the new form of jazz poetry.

The mid-20th century saw the emergence of The New York Intellectuals, a group of American writers and literary critics who advocated leftist, anti-Stalinist political ideas and who sought to integrate literary theory with Marxism. Many of the group were students at the City College of New York in the 1930s and associated with the left-wing political journal &quot;The Partisan Review&quot;. Writer Nicholas Lemann has described the New York Intellectuals as &quot;the American Bloomsbury&quot;. Writers often considered among the New York Intellectuals include Robert Warshow, Philip Rahv, William Phillips, Mary McCarthy, Dwight Macdonald, Lionel Trilling, Clement Greenberg, Irving Kristol, Sidney Hook, Irving Howe, Alfred Kazin, and Daniel Bell. The 1940s and 1950s also saw the rise in prominence of Ayn Rand, who was based in New York for many years and whose novels The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged were both set in the city.

Parallel and counter to these mainstream groups have been such New York-centered underground movements as the Beat poets and writers, including Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, Gregory Corso and others, continuing into the 1980s and beyond with such writers as Kathy Acker and Eileen Myles. Various movements down through the years have centered on avant-garde publishing enterprises such as Grove Press and Evergreen Review, as well as unnumbered zine-style pamphlets and one-off literary productions still available in independent bookstores today. At present the underground continues to thrive in the form of small press literary publishers, including Soft Skull Press, Fugue State Press, Dennis Cooper&#x27;s Little House on the Bowery/Akashic Press, and many others.

Over the years many literary institutions have developed in the city, including PEN America, the largest of the international literary organization&#x27;s centers. The PEN America plays an important role in New York&#x27;s literary community and is active in defending free speech, the promotion of literature, and the fostering of international literary fellowship. Literary journals, including &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, &quot;n+1&quot;, &quot;The New Criterion&quot;, and &quot;New York Quarterly&quot; are also important in the city&#x27;s literary scene.

Contemporary writers based in the city, many of whom live in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn, include Norman Mailer, Barbara Garson, Don DeLillo, Jhumpa Lahiri, Paul Auster, Siri Hustvedt, Jonathan Safran Foer, Jonathan Lethem, Thomas Pynchon and many others. New York has also been a flourishing scene for Jewish American literature, as well as for Puerto Rican poets and writers, who call themselves &quot;nuyoricans&quot; (a blending of the phrases &quot;New York&quot; and &quot;Puerto Rican&quot;). The landmark Nuyorican Poets Café is a bastion of the Nuyorican Movement, an intellectual movement involving poets, writers, musicians and artists of Puerto Rican descent, mostly notably the late Pedro Pietri and Giannina Braschi.

While the state has an official poet Laureate, New York City does not. Instead, by tradition it hosts an annual &quot;People&#x27;s Poetry Gathering&quot;, curated by the City University of New York and city poetry groups, in which ordinary New Yorkers offer their own lines to an epic poem for the city. This technique was also used in the creation of a spontaneous poetic response by New Yorkers to the September 11, 2001 attacks that became a travelling exhibition called &quot;Missing: Streetscape of a City in Mourning&quot;. The poems, with 110 lines each for the 110 stories of the destroyed World Trade Center towers, were printed on black, billowing cotton banners over in height.

===Comic books===
The American comic book was invented in New York in the early 1930s as a way to cheaply repackage and resell newspaper comic strips, which also experienced their major period of creative growth and development in New York papers in the first decades of the 20th century. Immigrant culture in the city was the central topic and inspiration for comics from the days of Hogan&#x27;s Alley, the Yellow Kid, The Katzenjammer Kids and beyond. Virtually all creators and workers employed in the early comic book industry were based in New York, from publishers to artists, many of them coming from immigrant Jewish families in the Lower East Side and Brooklyn.

It can be argued that superheroes, the uniquely American contribution to comic books, owe their origin to New York, despite the fact that the first superhero, Superman, was created by two artists from Cleveland, Ohio. Even when not based explicitly in New York, superhero stories often make use of recognizable stand-ins for the city, such as Metropolis or Gotham City (Gotham being a common nickname for New York). The form and narrative conventions of superhero stories frequently dictate New York-sized cities as the settings, even generically.

Marvel Comics became famous for breaking with convention and setting their stories explicitly in a &quot;real&quot; New York, giving recognizable addresses for the homes of their major characters. Peter Parker, Spider-Man, lived with his Aunt May in Forest Hills, Queens. The Baxter Building, long-time home of the Fantastic Four, was located at 42nd and Madison Avenue. In 2007, the City of New York declared April 30 May 6 &quot;Spider-Man Week&quot; in honor of the release of Spider-Man 3. Both of the previous Spider-Man movies made heavy use of New York as a backdrop and included crowd scenes filled with &quot;stereotypical New Yorkers.&quot;

New York also served as an inspiration and home for much of America&#x27;s non-superhero comic books, famously starting with cartoonist and Brooklyn native Will Eisner&#x27;s many depictions of everyday life among poor, working-class and immigrant New Yorkers. Today New York&#x27;s alternative comics scene is thriving, including native New Yorkers Art Spiegelman, Ben Katchor and Dean Haspiel, graduates of the School of Visual Arts cartooning program (the first accredited cartooning program in the country) and many others.

Meanwhile, New York&#x27;s comic book history has worked its way into other facets of New York culture, from the Pop Art of Roy Lichtenstein to the recent literary production of Brooklyn-based Jonathan Lethem and Dave Eggers.

==Museums==
The Metropolitan Museum of Art is one of the world&#x27;s largest and most important art museums, and is located on the eastern edge of Central Park. It also comprises a building complex known as &quot;The Cloisters&quot; in Fort Tryon Park at the north end of Manhattan Island overlooking the Hudson River which features medieval art. The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) is often considered a rival to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Brooklyn Museum is the second largest art museum in New York and one of the largest in the United States. One of the premier art institutions in the world, its permanent collection includes more than one-and-a-half million objects, from ancient Egyptian masterpieces to contemporary art, and the art of many other cultures.

There are many smaller important galleries and art museums in the city. Among these is the Frick Collection, one of the preeminent small art museums in the United States, with a very high-quality collection of old master paintings housed in 16 galleries within the former mansion of steel magnate Henry Clay Frick. The collection features some of the best-known paintings by major European artists, as well as numerous works of sculpture and porcelain. It also has furniture, enamel, and carpets.


The Jewish Museum of New York was first established in 1904, when the Jewish Theological Seminary received a gift a 26 Jewish ceremonial art objects by Judge Mayer Sulzberger. The museum now boasts a collection 28,000 objects including paintings, sculpture, archaeological artifacts, and many other pieces important to the preservation of Jewish history and culture.

Founded in 1969 by a group of Puerto Rican artists, educators, community activists and civic leaders, El Museo del Barrio is located at the top of Museum Mile in Spanish Harlem, a neighborhood also called &#x27;El Barrio&#x27;. Originally, the museum was a creation of the Nuyorican Movement and Civil Rights Movement, and primarily functioned as a neighborhood institution serving Puerto Ricans. With the increasing size of New York&#x27;s Latino population, the scope of the museum is expanding.

The American Museum of Natural History and its Hayden Planetarium focus on the sciences. There are also many smaller specialty museums, from the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum to the International Center of Photography and The Museum of Television and Radio. There is even a Museum of the City of New York. A number of the city&#x27;s museums are located along the Museum Mile section of Fifth Avenue.

In recent years New York has seen a major building boom among its cultural institutions. Long Island City in Queens is an increasingly thriving location for the arts, home to P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center and SculptureCenter for example. SculptureCenter, New York&#x27;s only non-profit exhibition space dedicated to contemporary and innovative sculpture, re-located from Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side to a former trolley repair shop in LIC, renovated by artist/designer Maya Lin in 2002. The museum commissions new work and presents challenging exhibits by emerging and established, national and international artists and hosts a diverse range of public programs including lectures, dialogues, and performances. In 2024 The Louis Armstrong House Museum won the prestigious National Medal for Museum and Library Service.

In 2006 more than 60 arts institutions spread across the five boroughs, from smaller community organizations like the Museum of Contemporary African Diasporan Arts in Brooklyn to major institutions like The Morgan Library &amp; Museum, underwent architectural renovation or new construction. In aggregate the projects represented more than $2.8 billion in investment. The New York City Department of Cultural Affairs budget for building projects was the largest in the city&#x27;s history: $865 million from 2006 through 2010, up from a $339.6 million planned budget for the 2001-4 period. The Alliance for the Arts, a nonpartisan, nonprofit arts advocacy and research group, reported in 2003 that the economic impact of cultural construction projects in New York — including factors like jobs created and collateral spending in the city — between 1997 and 2002 was $2.3 billion, with an anticipated impact of $2.7 billion for the period from 2003 through 2006.

==Inventions==
New York City, like any other city across the United States and the world, has changed with its own unique inventions, among which are:

*Air conditioning
*Club sandwiches
*Jell-O
*Oreos

==Cultural diversity==

===Demographics===

To some observers, New York, with its large immigrant population, seems more of an international city than something specifically &quot;American&quot;. But to others, the city&#x27;s very openness to newcomers makes it the archetype of a &quot;nation of immigrants&quot;. The term &quot;melting pot&quot; derives from the play &quot;The Melting Pot&quot;, by Israel Zangwill, who in 1908 adapted Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; to a setting in the Lower East Side, where droves of immigrants from diverse European nations in the early 1900s learned to live together in tenements and row houses for the first time. In 2000, 36% of the city&#x27;s population was foreign-born. Among American cities this proportion was higher only in Los Angeles and Miami. While the immigrant communities in those cities are dominated by a few nationalities, in New York no single country or region of origin dominates. The seven largest countries of origin are the Dominican Republic, China, Jamaica, Russia, Italy, Poland and India.

The cultural diversity of New York can be seen in the range of official city holidays. With the growth of New York&#x27;s South Asian community, Diwali, the Hindu Festival of Lights, was added to the calendar in 2022-2023.
As in many major cities, immigrants to New York often congregate in ethnic enclaves where they can talk and shop and work with people from their country of origin. Throughout the five boroughs the city is home to many distinct communities of Indians, Irish, Italians, Chinese, Koreans, Dominicans, Puerto Ricans,Salvadorians, Caribbeans, Hasidic Jews, Latin Americas, Russians and many others. Many of the largest citywide annual events are parades celebrating the heritage of New York&#x27;s ethnic communities. Attendance at the biggest ones by city and state politicians is politically obligatory. These include the St Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade, probably the top Irish heritage parade in the Americas; the Puerto Rican Day Parade, which often draws up to 3 million spectators; the West Indian Labor Day Parade, among the largest parades in North America and the largest event in New York; and the Chinese New Year Parade. New Yorkers of all stripes gather together for these spectacles. Other significant parades include the Gay Pride Parade, Greenwich Village Halloween Parade and the Coney Island Mermaid Parade, all icons in the city&#x27;s counter-culture pantheon.

New York has a larger Jewish population than any other city in the world, larger than even Jerusalem. Approximately one million New Yorkers, or about 13%, are Jewish. As a result, New York culture has borrowed certain elements of Jewish culture, such as bagels. The city is also home to the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, the headquarters of Orthodox Jewish movements, one of three American campuses of Hebrew Union College of Reform Judaism, Yeshiva University, and the home of the Anti-Defamation League. Temple Emanu-El, the largest Jewish house of worship in the world, became the first Reform congregation in America in 1845. It is also the home of such Jewish comedians as Woody Allen and Jerry Seinfeld.

===Festivals and parades===
New York, with its many ethnic communities and cultural venues, has a large number of major parades and street festivals. SummerStage in Central Park is one of about 1,200 free concerts, dance, theater, and spoken word events citywide sponsored by the City Parks Foundation.

The Village Halloween Parade is an annual holiday parade and street pageant presented the night of every Halloween (October 31) in Greenwich Village. Stretching more than a mile, this cultural event draws two million spectators, fifty thousand costumed participants, dancers, artists and circus performers, dozens of floats bearing live bands and other musical and performing acts, and a worldwide television audience of one hundred million.

The Feast of San Gennaro, originally a one-day religious commemoration, is now an 11-day street fair held in mid-September in Manhattan&#x27;s Little Italy. Centered on Mulberry Street, which is closed to traffic for the occasion, the festival generally features parades, street vendors, sausages and zeppole, games, and a religious candlelit procession which begins immediately after a celebratory mass at the Church of the Most Precious Blood. Another festival is held with the same attractions at New York&#x27;s other Little Italy, in the Fordham/Belmont area in the Bronx. The streets are closed to traffic and the festivities begin early in the morning and proceed late into the night.

Other major parades include the annual Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, presented by Macy&#x27;s Department Store and lasting three hours on Thanksgiving Day, which features enormous inflatable balloons, and Puerto Rican Day Parade which is held along Fifth Avenue (Manhattan) from 44th Street to 86th Street. The parade also extends through other ethnic Puerto Rican neighborhoods throughout the city in Brooklyn and the Bronx.

A major component of New Year&#x27;s Eve celebrations in the United States is the &quot;ball dropping&quot; on top of One Times Square that is broadcast live on national television. A 1,070-pound, 6-foot-diameter Waterford Crystal ball, high above Times Square, is lowered starting at 23:59:00 and reaching the bottom of its tower at the stroke of midnight (00:00:00). New York Harbor From 1982 to 1988, New York dropped a large apple in recognition of its nickname, &quot;The Big Apple.&quot; Dick Clark hosted televised coverage of the event from 1972 to 2011 with his show, &quot;Dick Clark&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve&quot;. For about four decades, until one year before his death in 1977, Canadian violinist and bandleader Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians serenaded the United States from the ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on Park Avenue. Their recording of the traditional song &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; still plays as the first song of the new year in Times Square.

==Sports==
New York is home to the headquarters of the National Football League, Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, and Major League Soccer. The New York metropolitan area hosts the most sports teams in these five professional leagues. Five of the ten most expensive stadiums ever built worldwide (MetLife Stadium, the new Yankee Stadium, Madison Square Garden, Citi Field, and Barclays Center) are located in the New York metropolitan area.

===Baseball===
New York has been described as the &quot;Capital of Baseball&quot;. There have been 35 Major League Baseball World Series and 73 pennants won by New York teams. It is also one of only five metro areas (Los Angeles, Chicago, Baltimore–Washington, and the San Francisco Bay Area being the others) to have two major league teams. Additionally, there have been 14 World Series in which two New York teams played each other, known as the Subway Series and occurring most recently in . No other metropolitan area has had this happen more than once (Chicago in , St. Louis in , and the San Francisco Bay Area in ).

The city&#x27;s two current MLB teams are the New York Mets and the New York Yankees, who compete in four games of interleague play every regular season that has also come to be called the Subway Series. The Yankees have won a record 27 championships, while the Mets have won the World Series twice. The city also was once home to the Brooklyn Dodgers (now the Los Angeles Dodgers), who won the World Series once, and the New York Giants (now the San Francisco Giants), who won the World Series five times. Both teams moved to California in 1958. There are also two Minor League Baseball teams in the city, the Brooklyn Cyclones and Staten Island Ferryhawks.

===Football===
The city is represented in the NFL by the New York Giants and the New York Jets, although both teams play their home games at MetLife Stadium in nearby East Rutherford, New Jersey, which hosted Super Bowl XLVIII in 2014.

The New York Rangers represent the city in the NHL. The New York Islanders, who originally played in Nassau County on Long Island, and moved to the Barclays Center in 2015. Also within the metropolitan area are the New Jersey Devils, who play in nearby Newark, New Jersey.

===Basketball===
The city&#x27;s NBA teams include the Brooklyn Nets and the New York Knicks, while the city&#x27;s Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association team is the New York Liberty. The first national college-level basketball championship, the National Invitation Tournament, was held in New York in 1938 and remains in the city.

The Basketdolls is a recreational basketball league established in June 2024 in New York City. Founded by Devin Myers, the organization operates primarily in Brooklyn&#x27;s Bushwick neighborhood and serves transgender participants. The league conducted its inaugural season from June 1 to September 2024, hosting 15 meetings at various public courts throughout New York City. As of 2024, the organization conducts its activities primarily on public basketball courts throughout New York City&#x27;s five boroughs.

===Soccer===
In soccer, New York is represented by New York City FC of MLS, who play their home games at Yankee Stadium. The New York Red Bulls play their home games at Red Bull Arena in nearby Harrison, New Jersey. Historically, the city is known for the New York Cosmos, the highly successful former professional soccer team which was the American home of Pelé, one of the world&#x27;s most famous soccer players.

===Tennis===
Queens is host of the U.S. Open Tennis Championships, one of the four annual Grand Slam tournaments. 

===Track and field===
The New York Marathon is one of the world&#x27;s largest, and the 2004–2006 events hold the top three places in the marathons with the largest number of finishers, including 37,866 finishers in 2006. The Millrose Games is an annual track and field meet whose featured event is the Wanamaker Mile. 

===Boxing===
Boxing is also a prominent part of the city&#x27;s sporting scene, with events like the Amateur Boxing Golden Gloves being held at Madison Square Garden each year.

===Additional sports===
Many sports are associated with New York&#x27;s immigrant communities. Stickball, a street version of baseball, was popularized by youths in the 1930s. A street in Clason Point in the Bronx has been renamed Stickball Boulevard, as tribute to New York&#x27;s most known street sport.

==In popular culture==
Because of its sheer size and cultural influence, New York has been the subject of many different, and often contradictory, portrayals in mass media. From the sophisticated and worldly metropolis seen in many Woody Allen films, to the hellish and chaotic urban jungle depicted in such movies as Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, New York has served as the backdrop for virtually every conceivable viewpoint on big city life.

In the early years of film, New York was characterized as urbane and sophisticated. By the city&#x27;s crisis period in the 1970s and early 1980s, however, films like &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;, &quot;The French Connection&quot;, &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot;, &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, &quot;Marathon Man&quot;, &quot;Cruising&quot;, &quot;Dressed to Kill&quot;, and &quot;Death Wish&quot; showed New York as full of chaos and violence. With the city&#x27;s renaissance in the 1980s and 1990s came new portrayals on television; &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, and &quot;Sex and the City&quot; showed life in the city to be glamorous and interesting. Nonetheless, a disproportionate number of crime dramas, such as &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, continue to make criminality in the city as their subject even as New York has become the safest large city in the United States in the 2000s and 2010s.

<doc id="1344501" wikidata="Q937156" url="?curid=1344501" title="Culture of the Faroe Islands">
<text>The culture of the Faroe Islands has its roots in the Nordic culture. The Faroe Islands were long isolated from the main cultural phases and movements that swept across parts of Europe. This means that they have maintained a great part of their traditional culture. The language spoken is Faroese. It is one of three insular North Germanic languages descended from the Old Norse language spoken in Scandinavia in the Viking Age, the others being Icelandic and the extinct Norn, which is thought to have been mutually intelligible with Faroese.

Until the 15th century, Faroese had a similar orthography to Icelandic and Norwegian, but after the Reformation in 1538, the ruling Danes outlawed its use in schools, churches and official documents. This maintained a rich spoken tradition, but for 300 years the language was not written down. This means that all poems and stories were handed down orally. These works were split into the following divisions: &quot;sagnir&quot; (historical), &quot;ævintyr&quot; (stories) and &quot;kvæði&quot; (ballads, often set to music and the mediaeval chain dance). These were eventually written down in the 19th century mostly by Danish scholars.

== Music and dance ==

Traditional Faroese music was primarily vocal, and was not accompanied by musical instruments. Only in Tórshavn instruments like fiddles were present in the older days. When trade grew in the 20th century the Faroese started to use imported musical instruments. Much of the imported music and instruments remained popular only in the capital and largest city, Tórshavn. Rural peoples remained true to traditions of the chain dance and ballads. The Faroese chain dance is a dance, which only survived in the Faroe Islands, while in other European countries it was banned by the church, due to its pagan origin. The dance is danced traditionally in a circle, but when a lot of people take part in the dance they usually let it swing around in various wobbles within the circle. There are no musical instruments used along with the dance, the dancers are singing ballads of various lengths, in either Faroese language or Danish, the latter of which is pronounced in Gøtudanskt. One man or woman leads the song by singing the first few words and then the others follow. The leader is called &quot;skipari&quot; (organizer). A ballad can be very long with a couple of hundred verses, which the skipari is expected to know by heart

The following description is by V. U. Hammershaimb, Færøsk Anthologi, 1891:
Such is the importance of the dance as a cultural element that the Faroese refer to it as Faroese dance. However, it shall be stated that the dance hasn&#x27;t the same popularity it once had. This especially applies to younger generations.

== Whaling ==
There are records of drive hunts in the Faroe Islands dating from 1584. Whaling in the Faroe Islands is regulated by Faroese authorities but not by the International Whaling Commission as there are disagreements about the commission&#x27;s legal authority to regulate cetacean hunts. Hundreds of long-finned pilot whales (&quot;Globicephala melaena&quot;) could be killed in a year, mainly during the summer. The hunts, called &quot;grindadráp&quot; in Faroese, are non-commercial and are organized on a community level; anyone can participate. When a whale pod by chance is spotted near land the participating hunters first surround the pilot whales with a wide semicircle of boats and then slowly and quietly begin to drive the whales towards the chosen authorised bay. When a pod of whales has been stranded the killing is begun.

Faroese animal welfare legislation, which also applies to whaling, requires that animals are killed as quickly and with as little suffering as possible. A regulation spinal lance is used to sever the spinal cord, which also severs the major blood supply to the brain, ensuring both loss of consciousness and death within seconds. The spinal lance has been introduced as preferred standard equipment for killing pilot whales and has been shown to reduce killing time to 1–2 seconds.

This &quot;grindadráp&quot; is legal and provides food for many people in the Faroe Islands. However, a study has found whale meat and blubber to currently be contaminated with mercury and not recommended for human consumption, as too much may cause such adverse health effects as birth defects of the nervous system, high blood pressure, damaged immune system, increased risk for developing Parkinson&#x27;s disease, hypertension, arteriosclerosis, and Diabetes mellitus type 2:
Animal rights groups such as the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society criticize it as being cruel and unnecessary, since it is no longer necessary as a food source for the Faroese people.

The sustainability of the Faroese pilot whale hunt has been discussed, but with a long-term average catch of around 800 pilot whales on the Faroe Islands a year the hunt is not considered to have a significant impact on the pilot whale population. There are an estimated 128,000 pilot whales in the Northeast Atlantic, and Faroese whaling is therefore considered a sustainable catch by the Faroese government. Annual records of whale drives and strandings of pilot whales and other small cetaceans provide over 400 years of documentation, including statistics, and represents one of the most comprehensive historical records of wildlife utilization anywhere in the world.

On 12 September 2021, a super-pod of over 1,420 white-sided dolphins were killed, which caused significant controversy in the Faroe Islands and abroad, leading to the government imposing quotas on the amount of white-sided dolphins allowed to be hunted each year. The UK Government declined to suspend its free-trade agreement with the Faroese, having been called upon by conservationists to do so.

== Literature and art ==


Faroese literature in the traditional sense of the word has only really developed in the past 100–200 years. This is mainly because the Faroese language was not written down in a standardised format until 1890 (in 1854 Venceslaus Ulricus Hammershaimb published a written standard for Modern Faroese that exists to this day. He produced orthography consistent with a continuous written tradition extending back to Old Norse). The Danish language was also encouraged at the expense of Faroese. Nevertheless, the Faroes have produced several authors and poets. The most famous of these authors are Jørgen-Frantz Jacobsen (known for his sole novel &quot;Barbara&quot;) and William Heinesen. Both authors wrote in Danish. Other famous authors from the Faroes include Heðin Brú (&quot;The Old Man and His Sons&quot;) and Jóanes Nielsen. Poets include the brothers Janus and Hans Andreas Djurhuus, and Rói Patursson.
Both Heinesen and Patursson have been awarded The Nordic Council&#x27;s Literature Prize.

As with literature, painting only really took off in the 20th century in the Faroes. Famous Faroese painters include Sámuel Joensen-Mikines, Ingálvur av Reyni, Ruth Smith, Tróndur Patursson, Steffan Danielsen and Amariel Norðoy among others.
In 1995 the German painter Ingo Kühl visited the Faroes and painted a serie of pictures &quot;Färöer&quot;.

==Handcrafts==
Lace knitting is a traditional handcraft of peoples of the Faroe Islands. The most distinguishing characteristic of Faroese lace shawls is the center back gusset shaping. Each shawl consists of two triangular side panels, a trapezoid-shaped back gusset, an edge treatment, and usually shoulder shaping.

==Sports==
=== Football ===
As of 1 July 2008, the Faroe Islands&#x27; international record (in UEFA European Championships qualifiers) was played 48, won 3, drawn 5, lost 40.

=== Boat race - Kappróður ===
&quot;Kappróður&quot; is the national sport of the Faroe Islands. There have been rowing competitions a long time back, at least as far back as to the 1930s, and now the competitions are still in a regular routine, held in seven different places during the weekends of June and July. The races are always part of a regional festival, called a stevna, with many other activities as well. The first regatta is always held in Klaksvík on Norðoyastevna in the first Saturday of June, sometimes it can be in the last Saturday of May. The final regatta is always held in Tórshavn on the national day, or actually on the day before the national day, which is called Ólavsøka. The boat race on Ólavsøka is the only race which is not necessarily held on a Saturday, but on the 28 July, whatever the day of the week it is. The regattas in between the Norðoyastevna and Ólavsøka are held in these locations: Jóansøka is every even year held in Vágur and every odd year in Tvøroyri, both villages are in Suðuroy (South Island), and this is the only place which is not possible to drive by car from Tórshavn, people have to take the ferry Smyril to Suðuroy, which is a two-hour journey. Jóansøka is held on a Saturday around the 24 June (St. John&#x27;s Wake). Eystanstevna is always held in Runavík, but the boat race is only held there every second year (even years), odd years the regatta is held in Fuglafjørður at the Varmakelda Festival (Varmakeldustevna).

=== Swimming ===
Swimming is a quite popular sport in the Faroe Islands. The Faroese freestyle swimmer Pál Joensen is the sportsperson of the Faroe Islands with the best international result for the country, a bronze medal at the 2012 FINA World Swimming Championships. In July 2011 he qualified for the finals in the men&#x27;s 800 meters and 1500 meters freestyle at the 2011 World Aquatics Championships in Shanghai. He placed fourth in the 1500 meter freestyle event, 0,67 second behind the bronze medalist. At the same competition, he placed fifth in the men&#x27;s 800 meters freestyle. In 2010, Joensen won silver in the 1500 meter freestyle swimming event at the European Aquatics Championship. As of 2012, he trained in a 25 meter long pool because there was no 50 meter pool in the Faroe Islands. The first 50-meter swimming pool is under construction in Pál Joensens hometown Vágur, it is expected to open in 2015. It is named after Pál Joensen: Pálshøll

Joensen competed at the Olympics in London 2012, but he didn&#x27;t make it to the finals. He competed for Denmark, because the Faroe Islands are not allowed to compete at the Olympics, as they don&#x27;t accept countries which are not independent. He swam for Denmark in the men&#x27;s 400m free, 1500m free and the 4 × 200 meter freestyle relay. He was the first Faroese swimmer to compete at the Olympics. Pál Joensen has moved to live and study in Denmark after finishing high school in the Faroe Islands in August 2012. Only one other Faroese athlete has participated in the Olympics, Katrin Olsen was rowing in a double sculler in 2008, also for Denmark. The Faroe Islands are allowed to compete at the Paralympics under its own flag. Faroese swimmers have represented the Faroe Islands at the Paralympics since 1984. Christina Næss won the first and only (until now 9 September 2012) gold medal for the Faroe Islands at the 1988 Summer Paralympics. Katrin Johansen, Tóra við Keldu and Heidi Andreasen have won silver or bronze medals at the Paralympics. Only one person has competed in another sport than swimming at the Paralympics for the Faroe Islands, which was in table tennis in 1992 when Heini Festirstein competed.

=== Island Games ===
The Faroe Islands compete in the biannual Island Games, which were hosted by the islands in 1989. The Faroe Islands won the games in 2009 Island Games with 34 gold medals, 23 silver and 24 bronze.

<doc id="1344512" wikidata="Q4033037" url="?curid=1344512" title="ANSI T1.413 Issue 2">
<text>ANSI T1.413 is a technical standard that defines the requirements for the single asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) for the interface between the telecommunications network and the customer installation in terms of their interaction and electrical characteristics. ADSL allows the provision of voiceband services including plain old telephone service (POTS) and data services up to 56 kbit/s, and a variety of digital channels. In the direction from the network to the customer premises (downstream), the digital bearer channels may consist of full-duplex low-speed bearer channels and simpler high-speed bearer channels; in the other (upstream) direction, only low-speed bearer channels are provided.

==Description==

The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Telecommunications Committee created the first standardized ADSL specifications. They were published as ANSI T1.413-1995 and ANSI T1.413-1998 (sometimes called &quot;issue 2&quot;) titled &quot;Network and Customer Installation Interfaces — Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) Metallic Interface.&quot;
It defines the minimum requirements for satisfactory performance of ADSL systems using the Discrete Multi-Tone (DMT) line code. DMT divides the useful bandwidth of the standard two wire copper medium used in the public switched telephone network (PSTN), which is 0 to 1104 kHz, into 256 separate 4.3125 kHz wide frequency bands called sub-carriers.

Up to 254 sub-carriers are used downstream; each of these 254 sub-carriers can support the modulation of 0 to 15 bits per baud. The baud is 4,000 symbols per second on each subcarrier. Thus the maximum theoretical downstream data rate of an ADSL system is 15.24 Mbit/s (254×15×4000). However, because the data is split up into packets (actually Reed–Solomon encoded codewords) of 255 bytes, the maximum achievable downstream data rate is 8.128 Mbit/s (including other overheads). It is possible to interleave two Reed-Solomon codewords and obtain one logical codeword of 510 bytes. If this is done, then the maximum theoretical downstream speed goes back up to around 15 Mbit/s.

In the upstream direction, a maximum of 30 sub-carriers can be used, again each frame modulated with up to 15 bits. Taken with the baud rate of 4,000 per second per subcarrier, the maximum throughput is just over 1.5 Mbit/s. 

In order to combine voice telephone service with downstream and upstream ADSL signals the bandwidth is split into discrete parts using frequency-division multiplexing (FDM). In this case: 0–4 kHz is for voice, 26–138 kHz is the upstream band and 138–1104 kHz is the downstream band.</text><links>

<text>Southwold is a township in Elgin County, in Ontario, Canada, located on the north shore of Lake Erie. It is a rich agricultural zone producing predominantly corn and soybeans. It is part of the London census metropolitan area.

==History==

The Southwold Earthworks is located in the township. It is an example of a pre-contact site associated with the indigenous Neutral people. The period of Neutral occupation is dated to approximately 14501550. It was designated as a National Historic Site in 1923.

Southwold was named in 1792 after Southwold in Suffolk, England. The municipality was incorporated in 1852.

Shedden&#x27;s growth occurred when the Canada Southern Railway was built, bypassing Fingal. Later it was joined by the Pere Marquette railway, boosting Shedden&#x27;s importance further still. Both railways are now defunct. Talbotville is situated at the intersection of highways 3 &amp; 4, two of the oldest roads in the region.

==Economy==
The township is home to the Green Lane Landfill, a large garbage dump site purchased by the City of Toronto in 2007. Toronto began shipping waste to the site in 2010. Southwold was also home of the Ford St. Thomas Assembly plant until its closure in 2011.

<doc id="1344521" wikidata="Q2583883" url="?curid=1344521" title="An Unfinished Race">
<text>&quot;An Unfinished Race&quot; is a short story by American Civil War soldier, wit, and writer Ambrose Bierce. The story, dealing with a mysterious disappearance of a man, was first published in &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot; on October 14, 1888, and was included in Bierce&#x27;s collection &quot;Can Such Things Be?&quot; (1893). Bierce himself mysteriously disappeared in October 1914.

&quot;An Unfinished Race&quot; was collected in the third volume of Bierce&#x27;s complete works, which included the ghost stories from his earlier book &quot;Can Such Things Be?&quot; The updated version included three new stories under the heading &quot;Mysterious Disappearances&quot;, including &quot;The Unfinished Race&quot;.

==Summary==
The three-paragraph story is set in 1873. James Worson, a shoemaker who lived in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, England, undertook a bet, while under the influence of liquor. The bet stated that he could run non-stop from Leamington Spa to Coventry, then back again, a distance of over (in reality, the full distance is approximately ). He started to run, accompanied by the unnamed receiver of the bet, a linen draper named Barham Wise and a photographer named Hamerson Burns, who followed him in a wagon. Several miles into the run, Worson stumbled, fell &quot;with a terrible cry&quot;, and vanished before he hit the ground. He was never seen again. The witnesses were suspects for a time, but were freed later that day. No trace of Worson was ever found.

<text>Anglo American plc is a British multinational mining company with headquarters in London, England. It is the world&#x27;s largest producer of platinum, with around 40% of world output, as well as being a major producer of diamonds, copper, nickel, iron ore, polyhalite and steelmaking coal. The company has operations in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America and South America.

Anglo American has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. The company has a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. In the 2020 &quot;Forbes&quot; Global 2000, Anglo American was ranked as the 274th largest public company in the world.

==History==
===1917–1990===
Ernest Oppenheimer, a Jewish German émigré, founded the Anglo American Corporation (AAC) in 1917 in Johannesburg, South Africa, with financial backing from the American bank J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. and £1 million raised from UK and US sources to start the gold mining company; this fact is reflected in the company&#x27;s name. The AAC became the majority stakeholder in the De Beers company in 1926, a company formerly controlled by Alfred Beit, also a Jewish German émigré.

In the late 1940s and 1950s, the AAC focused on the development of the Free State goldfields (seven major mines simultaneously) and the Vaal Reefs mine. During 1945, the AAC moved into the coal industry by acquiring Coal Estates. Twelve years later, Oppenheimer died in Johannesburg and was succeeded as head of the company by his son Harry, who also became chairman of De Beers.

In 1961, the AAC expanded outside of southern Africa for the first time and became a major investor in the Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Company in Canada. In 1967, the company moved into the steel industry by acquiring Scaw Metals. From 1967 to 1975, it continued to grow and established a number of ventures, including the Mondi Group (timber, pulp and paper), Amgold (later AngloGold Ashanti) and then Amcoal (through the consolidation of several of its mining operations in South Africa; later known as Anglo Coal and in 2010 changed to Anglo Thermal). In 1982, Harry Oppenheimer retired as chairman of the AAC and was succeeded by Gavin Relly. Two years later, Oppenheimer retired from De Beers and passed the chairmanship to Julian Ogilvie Thompson, who in 1990 also became chairman and chief executive of the AAC.

===1990–2010===

On 24 May 1999, Anglo American Corporation merged with Minorco to form Anglo American plc, with its primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Its gold mining operations were spun off into the separate AngloGold corporation, which in 2004 merged with the Ashanti Goldfields Corporation to form AngloGold Ashanti. Anglo American reduced its stake in AngloGold Ashanti to 16.6% in 2008.

In 2000, Julian Ogilvie Thompson retired as chief executive of Anglo American and was succeeded by Tony Trahar. Ogilvie Thompson also retired as chairman in 2002 and was replaced by Mark Moody-Stuart. In the same year, Anglo American acquired Tarmac, a supplier of building materials, and Shell Petroleum Company&#x27;s Australian coal assets. In 2001, De Beers was privatised after being a listed company for more than 70 years.

In 2002, South Africa&#x27;s Mining Charter was approved, and Anglo American and other mining companies with operations in the country were mandated to transfer a percentage of their South African production to historically disadvantaged South Africans. From 2002 to July 2008 Anglo American carried out black community economic empowerment transactions (across all businesses with operations in South Africa) totalling R26 billion. Also, in 2002, Anglo Base Metals acquired the Disputada copper operations in Chile from ExxonMobil and opened a representative office in Beijing, China. In 2003, Anglo American acquired a majority stake in iron ore producer Kumba Resources.

In 2007, Cynthia Carroll succeeded Tony Trahar, becoming the first non-South African and first female chief executive of Anglo American. The Mondi Group, a paper and packaging business, was also spun out in 2007. During the next two years, Anglo American opened a representative office in New Delhi, India, acquired control of the Michiquillay copper project in northern Peru and the MMX Minas-Rio and Amapa iron ore projects in Brazil, and later acquired stakes in the Pebble copper project in Alaska.

Anglo American was also accused in 2007 of damaging environmental practices: in order to complete its planned Alaskan Pebble Mine in collaboration with Northern Dynasty Minerals, the company considered building a massive dam at the headwaters of the world&#x27;s largest sockeye salmon fishery, which it would risk obliterating. Opponents also pointed to the use of cyanide, heavy metals, and acid mine drainage which can all have potentially devastating effects on the environment of the Bristol Bay area. Opponents of the Pebble Mine created Ballot Measure 4 to impose additional water quality standards on new large-scale mines in the state. However, in August 2007, Alaskans voted against the initiative. As of September 2008, the Pebble Limited Partnership had not yet put forward a project proposal and was working to prepare a prefeasibility study for the project in the second half of 2009. The mine proposal would still need to undergo environmental studies and the permitting process, including being subject to state and federal water protections. In December 2013, Anglo American withdrew from the Pebble Limited Partnership.

===2010 to present===
In early November 2011, Anglo American entered into talks with the Oppenheimer family to divest the latter&#x27;s remaining shares of De Beers, whereby Anglo American acquired an additional 40% stake for $5.1 billion, increasing their overall stake to 85%. This came at a time of increased labour strikes and international attention to Oppenheimer&#x27;s involvement in conflict diamonds. Anglo American then sold a 24.5% share in its Chilean copper unit, Anglo American Sur, to Japan&#x27;s Mitsubishi Corporation for $5.39 billion, paid with a promissory note due on 10 November 2011. With this deal, the Anglo American Sur complex was valued at $22 billion.

In November 2012, Anglo American completed the sale of steel maker Scaw South Africa and its connected companies for a total of R3.4 billion in cash.

In July 2014, Anglo American said it was disposing of its 50% shareholding in Lafarge Tarmac, a building materials joint venture, to cement maker Lafarge SA for a value of not less than £885 million ($1.5 billion); the sale was subsequently completed in July 2015 for $1.6 billion. In October 2014, Anglo American&#x27;s Minas-Rio iron ore project in Brazil began operating and shipping ore.

In July 2015, Anglo American announced that it would cut 53,000 jobs (35% of their workforce) and that in the first half of 2015, they had a financial loss of US$3 billion. In early December 2015, the company announced that, as part of a restructure, it would be cutting a further 85,000 mining jobs, nearly two-thirds of its work force of 135,000, worldwide. It also announced the consolidation of six of its divisions into three businesses, while dividend payouts to investors were also suspended for a year. The company also had its Dawson, Foxleigh and Callide coal mines in Central Queensland, as well as its Dartbrook coal mine in the Hunter Valley in New South Wales, put up for sale as its shares dropped to a record low on the London Stock Exchange, falling by more than 12 per cent.

In March 2017, British Indian industrialist Anil Agarwal purchased 11% of the company through his family trust Volcan. In September, he took the holding to 20% through another purchase worth about $1.5 billion. In April 2017, the company sold its Eskom-linked thermal coal operations in South Africa for $166 million, marking an important step in the mining giant&#x27;s strategic overhaul to sharpen its focus on three commodities.

In October 2019, Anglo American announced a partnership with French energy company Engie and engineering firm First Mode to develop the world&#x27;s largest hydrogen-powered mine haul truck.

In January 2020, Anglo American made a 5.5p per share offer to buy a polyhalite fertiliser project (in North Yorkshire, England) from Sirius Minerals for £400m. In salvaging the financially troubled project, Anglo American envisages spending around £230m to keep construction going. The sale was approved by shareholders in March 2020.

In April 2021, Anglo American announced the demerger of Thungela Resources, which will own a series of significant South African thermal coal assets, in order to eliminate the risk of clean-up liabilities.

In May 2022, Anglo American and First Mode unveiled the world’s largest hydrogen powered mine haul truck at Mogalakwena PGM Mine in northeast South Africa. The project, which is expected to be fully implemented by 2026, is a first step in making eight of the company’s mines carbon neutral by 2040. The company has set a target of getting all of its operations to that status by 2040. President of the Republic of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa was present at the launch and stated, &quot;Developing the hydrogen economy is a strategic priority for our country.&quot;

BHP made an offer to acquire the company for £31 billion in April 2024; however, the offer was rejected by the company as &quot;highly unattractive&quot;. In May 2024, a revised offer was made by BHP and subsequently rejected by Anglo American.

==Operations==
Anglo American focuses on natural resources with six core businesses: Kumba Iron Ore, Iron Ore Brazil, coal (thermal and metallurgical), base metals (copper, nickel, niobium and phosphates), platinum, and diamonds, through De Beers, in which it owns an 85% share. In 2008, the company had 105,000 permanent employees and 39,000 contract employees in its managed operations across 45 countries.

In 2008, Anglo American (excluding De Beers) spent $212 million on exploring 21 countries for resources including copper, nickel, niobium phosphates and zinc. The two main types of exploration for the company are greenfield and brownfield, with nearly 70% devoted to greenfield projects.

Anglo American, along with De Beers, backed the manufacturing of a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) to help improve the sensitivity of exploration surveys. Anglo American established Boart Products South Africa Limited in 1936 (later named Boart International) to turn the company&#x27;s stockpile of boart, or low-grade natural diamonds, into drilling products. This initiative resulted in the development of the first mechanically set diamond drill bit and later led to additional research into cutting and abrasive tools.

In December 2010, following delays and high costs, Anglo American gained a key licence from the Brazilian government that would allow work to start on the Minas-Rio iron ore project. Production is initially expected to be 26.5 million tonnes per year; iron ore would be sent through a 525 km slurry pipeline to the Port of Açu. As of October 2014, Minas-Rio is operational and shipping ore. 
In July 2018, Anglo American announced that it would spend $5.3 billion on developing the Quellaveco copper mine in Peru, which the company acquired in 1992, with the Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi funding 40% of the total cost. As part of the project, Anglo American also committed 650 million soles ($195 million) towards local community developments projects in Moquegua, where the Quellaveco mine is located.

== Accusations of health impacts ==
In October 2020, Anglo American was accused of being responsible for lead poisoning in possibly over 100,000 people near Kabwe mine, which the company operated from 1925 - 1974. Numerous studies since 1971 have shown that people around Kabwe mine have been poisoned by lead. A 2015 study found that 100% of children tested in the area had lead in their blood exceeding CDC guidelines.

Plaintiffs say that the lead originated from the lead mine and smelter, stating that “generations of children have been poisoned by the operations of the Kabwe mine...which caused widespread contamination of the soil, dust, water and vegetation.” Anglo American denies these allegations and has accused its successor ZCCM, which operated the mine after its nationalization in 1974. The class action certification hearing was held in February 2023 at the High Court of South Africa&#x27;s Johannesburg branch.

In 2013, the companies involved in the Cerrejón coal mine in Colombia, were accused of increasing illness in approximately 13,000 people living close to the mine. Anglo American was also accused of failing to compensate people who had been displaced by its expansion. In September 2020, a UN human rights expert advised that Colombia discontinue the mine citing environmental and human rights concerns. In January 2021, the OECD launched an investigation into Cerrejón over human rights and environmental concerns. In February 2021, Anglo American announced plans to divest the Cerrejon mine by 2024. In June 2021, Anglo sued the Colombian government for preventing the development of the La Puente coal pit.

==Carbon footprint==
For 2023, Anglo American reported Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions of 12.5 Mt CO2e.
The company has committed to carbon neutrality in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2040, and 50% reductions in the Scope 3 emissions relative to a 2020 baseline.

<text>Montlhéry () is a commune in the Essonne department in Île-de-France in northern France. It is located from Paris.

==History==
Montlhéry lay on the strategically important road from Paris to Orléans. Under the Merovingians, it was owned by the church in Reims and in 768 it was given to the abbey of St. Denis in Paris. It was the site of a number of battles between the lords of Montlhéry and the early Capetian monarchy.

The Montlhéry noble house was related to the Montmorency family; Thibaud, the founder of the Montlhéry dynasty, was the brother of Bouchard II, the progenitor of the Montmorency house. Thibaud ruled from 970 to 1031 and was succeeded by his son Guy I, who ruled until 1095. Guy I&#x27;s children married into other local noble families: his daughter Melisende married Hugh, count of Rethel, and another daughter Elizabeth married Joscelin of Courtenay. Through these marriages and subsequent Montlhéry participation on the First Crusade, Guy I was the ancestor of the ruling dynasties of the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem and the County of Edessa. Another daughter, Alice, married into the Le Puiset family, and a son, Guy, became count of Rochefort. Guy I was succeeded by Milo I, followed by Milo&#x27;s sons Guy II and Milo II. In 1118, after many disputes with the rebellious lords, Louis VI of France ordered the castle to be dismantled and turned the town into a royal residence. Louis VI had himself been married to a granddaughter of Guy I, Lucienne of Rochefort, from 1104 to 1107.

After being absorbed into the royal domain, Montlhéry became part of the territory governed by the viscount of Paris. In the early 13th century, the French king Philip II (Augustus) completely rebuilt the castle in the contemporary style, at a new site high above the town.

During the Hundred Years&#x27; War, the town and the castle frequently passed between English and French forces. On 16 July 1465, Charles the Bold defeated Louis XI of France at the Battle of Montlhéry. The town was left in ruins by the Wars of Religion, but it was rebuilt in 1591 under Henry IV.

In the 19th century, the tower was used for scientific experiments. In 1822, François Arago calculated the speed of sound there; a cannonball shot at the tower was observed from the Observatory of Villejuif. In 1823, Claude Chappe installed a relay for the Paris-Bayonne telegraph line. On 5 June 1874, Alfred Cornu tried to calculate the speed of light between the tower and the Observatory in Paris.

During the Franco-Prussian War, the town was occupied and pillaged by the Prussians. It was occupied again by Germany in 1940 during the Second World War.

Today Montlhéry is twinned with Stetten am kalten Markt, Germany.

==Population==
Inhabitants of Montlhéry are known as &quot;Montlhériens&quot; in French.

==Château de Montlhéry==

The Château de Montlhéry, a 13th-century castle with its prominent keep, succeeded a castle built in the 11th century, and an earlier foundation, built from 991 to 1015.

===List of lords of Montlhéry===
*Thibaud of Montmorency (970-1031)
*Guy I of Montlhéry (1031–1095)
*Milo I of Montlhéry (1095–1102)
*Guy II of Montlhéry (1102–1109)
*Milo II of Montlhéry (1109–1118)
*&quot;passes to royal domain of France&quot;

==Economy==
South of Montlhéry (on the communes of Linas and Bruyères-le-Châtel) is the site of an automobile race track, the &quot;Autodrome de Montlhéry&quot;, established by Alexandre Lamblin in 1924. It is sometimes referred to as the &#x27;French Indianapolis&#x27;, because it is laid out as a high speed oval. Many speed records were set there within months of its opening. Today the racetrack has fallen into disuse and is also used for other purposes including a variety of automobile meetups.

Montlhéry was also a market town, which is remembered today in the Tomato Festival. The medieval tower is also a popular tourist attraction, which recently re-opened in 2005 after being closed for repairs.

==Personalities==
* Henri Oreiller, was an alpine ski racer and Olympic gold medallist from France.
* Paul Fort, nicknamed &quot;Le Prince des Poètes&quot;, lived there from 1921 until his death in 1960.

<text>Annibale Padovano (1527 – March 15, 1575) was an Italian composer and organist of the late Renaissance Venetian School. He was one of the earliest developers of the keyboard toccata.

== Life ==

Padovano was born in Padua — hence his name — but little is known about his early life. He first appears at St. Mark&#x27;s in Venice on November 30, 1552, when he was hired as first organist at an annual salary of 40 ducats. He stayed at this post until 1565. St. Mark&#x27;s at this time also began to employ a second organist (it was Claudio Merulo for the last eight years of Padovano&#x27;s tenure), which allowed two simultaneous, spatially separated organs to perform in the huge space of the cathedral: this was a key development in music of the Venetian school, which was already using spatially separated choirs of voices. Merulo took over the job of first organist when Padovano left.

In 1566, Padovano left Venice to go to the Habsburg court in Graz. Many Venetian musicians left their native area to seek their fortunes in Habsburg domains, which generally remained friendly to Venice. Padovano became the director of music at Graz in 1570, and died there five years later.

== Music and influence ==

Although Padovano published a book of motets, a book of masses, and two books of madrigals, he is mainly remembered for his instrumental music. He was a notable early composer of ricercars, a predecessor of the fugue; many of the themes he used derived from plainchant, but he included considerable ornamentation in the melodic lines. In addition he often broke the theme up for motivic development in a surprisingly &quot;modern&quot; way, anticipating the developmental techniques of the common practice period.

Probably his most famous compositions are his toccatas, which were perhaps the earliest examples of the toccata in its more modern sense as an improvisatory, highly ornamented piece. Usually he included imitative interpolations between improvisatory sections, and also meter changes from duple to triple, anticipating later music of the Venetian school.

While in Bavaria he wrote an enormous mass for 24 voices, which makes use of three choirs of eight voices each. This composition was likely performed for the wedding of Duke Wilhelm V of Bavaria to Renata of Lorraine. This piece has been recorded by the Huelgas Ensemble, led by Paul Van Nevel.

<text>The R33S (also known as R33 World&#x27;s Fair or R33WF) was a New York City Subway car that was built by St. Louis Car Company in 1963 for the IRT A Division. They were purchased for service on the IRT Flushing Line (7 and &lt;7&gt; trains), which was the closest line to the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. A total of 40 cars were built, arranged as single cars. While in regular service, each R33S was coupled to five two-car consists of R36 cars to make 11-car trains for the 7 and &lt;7&gt; routes.

The R33S fleet entered service on September 26, 1963, and was originally painted in a light blue turquoise &quot;Bluebird&quot; scheme. The fleet was overhauled in the mid-1980s, during which the cars were painted red, leading to the nickname &quot;Redbirds&quot;. The R33S fleet was replaced in the early 2000s with the delivery of the R142 and R142A cars, with the last train of R33S and R36s running on November 3, 2003. After being retired, some R33S cars were preserved, but most were kept for work service; many of the work cars were scrapped in the 2010s.

==Description==
The R33S cars were numbered 9306–9345. The cars were very similar to the R33 cars, save for differently shaped side windows (three-piece curved windows on the R33S cars as opposed to three-sectioned rectangular windows on the R33 cars), and the fact that the R33S cars were single cars with a cab at both ends. The cars were built as single cars to make 11-car trains with the R36 cars for the 7, which were built as married pairs.

Although the R33S cars were later referred to as Redbirds, the cars were originally painted in a light turquoise blue and white upon delivery. This &quot;Bluebird&quot; paint color scheme was used until the mid-1970s when they were painted in the silver/blue MTA livery. Then, they were painted a full white (roof, bonnets, sides were all painted white) from 1981 to 1982 to combat graffiti; since the white paint was a Teflon-based paint, the graffiti did not stick to it very well. The look was abandoned for the famous Redbird style. The Redbirds were painted between 1984 and 1989 to a deep maroon red body, black front bonnets and anti-climbers, and a silver roof.

==History==
The first R33S cars were placed in service on the train on September 26, 1963. The cars were solely assigned to the (IRT Flushing Line) and were based out of Corona Yard.

The cars were rebuilt in-house in 1985 by the Coney Island Shop, except for one car (9306), which was not rebuilt and instead sent to the New York Transit Museum in 1976. However, they were not retrofitted with air conditioning system and instead retained their original Axiflow ceiling fans. For this reason, they were not used during the summer months due to poor air circulation or air flow and high humidity; the 7 train used 10 car trains when the cars were not used.

===Retirement and after-life service===
In 1996, New York City Transit Authority announced their plan to phase out the Redbirds with the R142 and R142A fleets. While the Redbirds on the IRT Main Line were beginning to be retired starting in early 2001, the service was still provided by R33S and R36 cars. In January 2002, a set of R62As arrived from the IRT mainline. As more R142s and R142As were delivered, R62As were gradually transferred from the and to the , in turn replacing R33S/R36 trains. The last car remaining R33S, 9309, made its final trip on November 3, 2003, on the 7 service with ten R36 cars, marking the end of the Redbirds and non-stainless steel cars in the subway.

Most R33S cars were converted to work motors in the early 2000s, and handle such tasks as providing traction for B-Division rail adhesion cars and refuse trains. The number &quot;1&quot; was placed before the former number (i.e. car 9345 became 19345) of some cars. The work cars are based out of various yards around the system and handle such tasks as providing traction for A-Division rail adhesion cars and refuse trains, and hauling cars during car moves between different subway yards. The cars that were not converted were 9306 and 9327, which were preserved as heritage cars after their retirement from revenue service, and 9321, which was stripped and sunken as an artificial reef in 2001.

Recently, the remaining R33S cars have been decommissioned as they experience structural or mechanical issues. Car 9339 was retired, stripped, and then sunken as an artificial reef in 2010 after it suffered fire damage that year. A handful of cars were replaced by reassigned R32 cars, stripped of parts to keep other IRT SMEE cars running, and then scrapped in 2013. Four cars were sidelined in 2017, after which they were sent into preservation. Currently, another handful of cars are being replaced by reassigned R42 cars.

Six cars have been preserved:
* Cars 9306, 9307, 9308, 9310, and 9343 have been preserved by the New York Transit Museum in Brooklyn. 9306, part of the museum since July 1976, is the only R33S car to not be rebuilt, and thus bears the World&#x27;s Fair paint scheme and original interior configuration. 9307, 9308, 9310, and 9343 were previously used as work motors based out of Corona Yard, before being retired in 2017. Cars 9307 and 9308 are also painted in the World&#x27;s Fair scheme, and car 9310 is painted in the &quot;Redbird&quot; scheme; it is unknown what scheme 9343 will be repainted to. All cars except 9343 are fully operational and run periodically on museum-sponsored &quot;Nostalgia Trains&quot;, specifically on the &quot;Train of Many Colors&quot;.
* Car 9327 is preserved at the Seashore Trolley Museum in Kennebunkport, Maine, painted in the Subway Series livery. The car was temporarily displayed at the New York Transit Museum and was used on a fan trip in May 2005 before being sent to Kennebunkport. It is fully operational, though modified with trolley poles, and makes occasional runs around the museum, often coupled to R22 car 7371.

<text>&quot;The Jeopardy Room&quot; is episode 149 of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, which originally aired on April 17, 1964, on CBS. It is one of the few &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episodes to feature no supernatural or sci-fi elements.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
Major Ivan Kuchenko, an escaped political prisoner who is attempting to defect, is trapped inside a hotel room in an unnamed, politically neutral country. Commissar Vassiloff, a hitman, and Boris, his assistant, are watching Kuchenko from a room across the street. Vassiloff, who considers himself an artist, has an elaborate plan for Kuchenko&#x27;s assassination. After Vassiloff tricks Kuchenko into drinking a sleeping drug, Kuchenko awakes to find a taped recording from Vassiloff in which he explains that he has booby-trapped an object in the room. If Kuchenko finds and disarms the object within three hours, he will be allowed to live; if he tries to leave the room before then or turn out the lights, he will be shot by Boris, an expert sniper.

Vassiloff tells Boris he has hidden a lethal bomb in the telephone, but it will be triggered only by picking up an incoming call. Thus, when Kuchenko picks up the phone without it ringing, nothing happens. Kuchenko grows increasingly nervous and desperate as the ordeal continues, even begging Vassiloff to shoot him at one point. With ten minutes of time left, Vassiloff places a call to Kuchenko&#x27;s room. Kuchenko puts his hand on the receiver, but hesitates. When Vassiloff tries to call him a second time, Kuchenko bolts out of the hotel room, narrowly escaping a spray of bullets from Boris. Later, Vassiloff and Boris enter the room to dispose of evidence. The telephone rings, and Boris and Vassiloff are both killed after Boris unthinkingly answers it. On the other end of the line is Ivan Kuchenko, calling from a phone booth at the airport. The operator tells him she is unable to reach his party, but Kuchenko states, &quot;It’s alright, operator. I... I have reached them.” He then leaves to board a plane flying to New York City, as Vassiloff and Boris are shown lying dead amidst the rubble of Kuchenko&#x27;s room.

<doc id="1344544" wikidata="Q2746563" url="?curid=1344544" title="Get Happy!! (Elvis Costello album)">
<text>Get Happy!! is the fourth studio album by the English singer-songwriter Elvis Costello, and his third with the Attractions — keyboardist Steve Nieve, bassist Bruce Thomas and drummer Pete Thomas (no relation). It was released on 15February 1980 through F-Beat Records in the United Kingdom and Columbia Records in the United States. Produced by Nick Lowe and engineered by Roger Béchirian, the sessions began in London but moved to the Netherlands after Costello found the material derivative of his previous album, &quot;Armed Forces&quot; (1979). The sessions were problematic but resulted in a large number of songs; the final album contains 20 tracks across a single LP.

A departure from Costello&#x27;s prior works, &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; was influenced by R&amp;B, ska and soul music of the 1960s. Two cover songs are included: Sam &amp; Dave&#x27;s &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand Up for Falling Down&quot; and the Merseybeats&#x27; &quot;I Stand Accused&quot;. In contrast to the upbeat music, the mostly downbeat lyrics concern doomed romances and other recurring themes. Initial album sleeves reversed the side listings, which was corrected for later reissues. The cover art reflects the soul influence and was designed to resemble a 1960s Stax record, with the UK release featuring a pre-worn sleeve image.

Initially delayed due to a dispute with Warner Bros. and Costello&#x27;s former label, Radar Records, &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; charted at No. 2 in the UK and No. 11 in the US, but sold less than &quot;Armed Forces&quot;. It was supported by a UK tour and three singles, of which &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand Up for Falling Down&quot; reached the UK top five. The album received positive reviews from music critics. Many focused on the quantity of tracks, which they felt varied in quality, although others gave high praise to the record and to Costello himself. It is retrospectively viewed as one of his best works. Appearing on lists of the best albums of the 1980s, it has been reissued multiple times with bonus tracks.

==Background==

Costello and the Attractions had supported his third studio album, &quot;Armed Forces&quot;, on the Armed Funk tour in America from February to April 1979. The tour was plagued with issues, including drug and alcohol problems, aggressive behaviour from Costello and his manager Jake Riviera toward the press, and uneven performances that led to critical and audience backlash. In March, Costello engaged in a drunken exchange with Stephen Stills, where he insulted various American musical artists, including James Brown and Ray Charles, using racial slurs. Costello quickly acknowledged the incident without apology in a press conference when details became public, and he received further backlash including death threats and &quot;Armed Forces&quot; being pulled from radio stations. By the tour&#x27;s end, Costello&#x27;s reputation in America was nearly destroyed. Bruce Thomas later admitted: &quot;We never really recovered from that tour. Every time Elvis is doing something well, he kind of sabotages it.&quot; His reputation in the United Kingdom remained largely unaffected, mostly due to newspapers failing to pick up the story. The author Mick St. Michael compares it to the worldwide response from John Lennon&#x27;s 1966 more popular than Jesus comment.

Costello referenced the incident in an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1982, feeling that it &quot;outweighs my entire career&quot;, but later reflected in his 2015 memoir &quot;Unfaithful Music &amp; Disappearing Ink&quot;: &quot;So what if my career was rolled back off the launching pad? Life eventually became a lot more interesting due to this failure to get into some undeserved and potentially fatal orbit.&quot; Although he remained with Columbia Records, he did not tour America again until 1981, in support of &quot;Trust&quot;. Following the disastrous tour, he decided to reevaluate himself and his career. He ended his relationship with Bebe Buell and reconciled with his wife Mary. Apart from recording the occasional demo and doing promotional gigs, he and the Attractions took some time off from each other over the summer of 1979; Costello produced the Specials&#x27; debut album in June while his band recorded an album released in September, &quot;Mad About the Wrong Boy&quot;. During his time working with the Specials, Costello taped demos at Archipelago, a small eight-track studio in Pimlico, London, playing all instruments himself. This yielded versions of &quot;Black and White World&quot;, &quot;Riot Act&quot;, &quot;Five Gears in Reverse&quot;, &quot;Love for Tender&quot;, &quot;King Horse&quot;, &quot;New Amsterdam&quot; and &quot;Men Called Uncle&quot;. According to his biographer Graeme Thomson, Costello had grown to hate the sound of &quot;Armed Forces&quot; and aimed to take a different direction for his next album.

==Recording==

Costello and the Attractions regrouped at London&#x27;s Eden Studios in September and October 1979 to rehearse the new tracks but, having written and performed some of the material during the preceding tour in a style similar to &quot;Armed Forces&quot;, Costello was displeased with the results, finding them derivative and too &quot;new wave&quot;. Bruce Thomas recalled: &quot;We sounded like the Jags. Bad Elvis and the Attractions impersonators, basically, who played everything fast and in eights.&quot; Thomson noted that the band&#x27;s classic sound was now outdated and the initial attempt at &quot;B Movie&quot; sounded like &quot;a desperate attempt&quot; at rewriting &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Army&quot; (1979). Wanting a new direction, Costello immersed himself in the soul music he&#x27;d enjoyed as a teenager, and purchased several soul records in London&#x27;s Camden Town, such as &quot;Motown Chartbusters Vol. 3&quot; and Atlantic Records&#x27; &quot;This Is Soul&quot;, which he gave to the band as inspiration. They then went back and re-arranged many of the songs in a more rhythm-and-blues style. The band also grew tired of Eden and relocated to Wisseloord Studios in Hilversum, Netherlands, with producer Nick Lowe and engineer Roger Béchirian.

Recording took place throughout the remainder of October 1979. Despite the change in scenery, the sessions were enveloped with problems. The band drank frequently, while Béchirian recalled it being a &quot;cocaine haze&quot;, adding: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t pleasant at all. You could see the seams coming apart at that point.&quot; Having played the majority of songs live before going into the studio on previous albums, the band now had little time to pause as the new songs were being rearranged frequently. Nieve suffered an emotional meltdown, and Bruce and Pete Thomas were unhappy with their bass and drum sounds. Lowe also found issues with the studio, even having Costello record his vocals in the booth designed for string instruments: &quot;[It] was extremely Euro. It was like trying to make a record as the Eurovision song contest was going on all around you.&quot;

The band recorded a large number of songs during the sessions, and almost all of the 20 tracks fitted onto the resulting album were under two-and-a-half minutes in length. According to Costello, the vinyl cutting and pressing process had to be precise to fit all of them onto the two sides of an LP. Two cover versions made the final tracklist: the Sam &amp; Dave B-side &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand Up for Falling Down&quot; and the Merseybeats&#x27; &quot;I Stand Accused&quot;. Although covers had frequently appeared in Costello&#x27;s live sets and as B-sides, &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; marked the first appearance of non-original material on one of his UK studio albums. The Archipelago recording of &quot;New Amsterdam&quot; was kept for the final album, as Costello felt it could not be improved upon. Outtakes that appeared as UK B-sides included &quot;Girls Talk&quot;, an alternate version of &quot;Clowntime Is Over&quot;, and a cover of Betty Everett&#x27;s &quot;Getting Mighty Crowded&quot;.

==Music and lyrics==

Musically, &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; represents a departure from Costello&#x27;s previous records, taking influences from the R&amp;B and soul sound of the 1960s, as well as ska. Michael Gallucci of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; described it as &quot;a throwback to &#x27;60s R&amp;B music played with new wave bite&quot;. In his book &quot;Let Them All Talk&quot;, the biographer Brian Hinton states that with &quot;Get Happy!!&quot;, the artist invested in &quot;soul sources with an introspection and bitterness previously alien to the genre&quot;. Costello said that not all the tracks took direct influence from R&amp;B and soul: &quot;Human Touch&quot; was influenced by his recent work producing the Specials; &quot;Men Called Uncle&quot; and &quot;Beaten to the Punch&quot; owed a debt to the early-1960s Liverpool sound that also included The Merseybeats&#x27; &quot;I Stand Accused&quot;. Some critics inferred the songs on &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; were a response to the events of the Armed Funk tour, although in his 2003 reissue liner notes, Costello said &quot;Riot Act&quot; was the only track on the album to refer to the incident, further commenting:

The album&#x27;s title is taken from the song of the same name, written by Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler. The biographer Tony Clayton-Lea finds it an ironic comment on the LP&#x27;s &quot;steeped in discontent&quot; lyrical content. The upbeat arrangements are in stark contrast to the lyrics, particularly on &quot;King Horse&quot;. Reviewing the album on release, critic Robert Hilburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; found the song titles hint at the &quot;jarring encounters&quot; described throughout, naming &quot;Beaten to the Punch&quot;, &quot;Temptation&quot;, &quot;Possession&quot;, &quot;Clowntime Is Over&quot; and &quot;High Fidelity&quot;. The biographer David Gouldstone splits the tracks on the album into songs concerned with public issues (&quot;Opportunity&quot;, &quot;Clowntime Is Over&quot;, &quot;5ive Gears in Reverse&quot; and &quot;Temptation&quot;) and songs detailing personal conflicts (all other tracks). He notes that almost all the songs have narrators, with &quot;King Horse&quot; highlighting that they all have human failings. A theme of doomed romance, inspired by the artist&#x27;s former relationship with Buell, appears in &quot;Beaten to the Punch&quot;, &quot;Riot Act&quot;, &quot;Men Called Uncle&quot;, &quot;New Amsterdam&quot; and &quot;B Movie&quot;. Additionally, &quot;The Ringer&quot; Elizabeth Nelson retrospectively found that Costello intended &quot;Temptation&quot;, &quot;Opportunity&quot; and &quot;Possession&quot; to be &quot;a kind of Burroughs-like, cut-up trilogy&quot;, dissecting them as &quot;a tortured romance in three acts&quot; or &quot;a plan for military domination&quot;.

The original album sleeve labels for &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; were reversed; side one began with &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand Up for Falling Down&quot; and ended with &quot;Riot Act&quot;, while side two started with &quot;Love for Tender&quot; and ended with &quot;High Fidelity&quot;, which was corrected for later reissues. The author James E. Perone argues that the swapping is significant, as the album makes &quot;more rhetorical sense&quot; with &quot;Love for Tender&quot; as the opener and &quot;Riot Act&quot; as the closer.

===Side one===
Opening track &quot;Love for Tender&quot; is an upbeat R&amp;B track that demonstrates the soul influence with a James Jamerson-style bass and Motown-era handclaps and percussion. The rushed song uses thematic punning to reference both affection and monetary advances. A reworking of the &quot;Armed Forces&quot; outtake &quot;Clean Money&quot;, Costello stated that he used the same &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hurry Love&quot; riff that the Jam used for &quot;Town Called Malice&quot;, a 1982 UK number one. Nelson found the opening lines (&quot;You won&#x27;t take my love for tender?&quot;) set a precedent for the entire album, in which &quot;one clever but fractious phrase after another unspools as though autogenerated from a demented mail-order catalog&quot;. &quot;Opportunity&quot; is the first of several cryptic songs on the album. The partly autobiographical number contains references to being watched or under surveillance, which the narrator is powerless to do anything about except wait for opportunities to come. Gouldstone gives an interpretation of the song as &quot;a dissident aside on the values and organisation of post-war Britain&quot;.

&quot;The Imposter&quot; is the narrator&#x27;s attack on a man who has won the affection over a woman he is also in love with; to the narrator, he is an &#x27;imposter&#x27; and is surprised no one else sees it. The tracks employs a punk-ska groove. &quot;Secondary Modern&quot; utilises a slower soul groove with downbeat lyrics. Like other tracks, the narrator pleas for a woman to accept him. Interpreting the phrase &quot;secondary modern&quot;–former schools for children that failed grammar school–Gouldstone finds that the phrase might have appealed to Costello due to its &quot;secondary importance&quot; in modern times, which is the final fate of most of his songs&#x27; characters.

Like &quot;The Imposter&quot;, &quot;King Horse&quot; is aimed at tough guys who harass waitresses and stewardesses. Gouldstone comments that &quot;to call someone &#x27;king horse&#x27; is in effect to accuse them of being driven by ruthless selfishness, of trampling over other people to reach their desires&quot;. Musically, the song uses the guitar figure from the Four Tops&#x27; &quot;Reach Out I&#x27;ll Be There&quot; (1966). AllMusic&#x27;s Rick Anderson argued that it anticipated the sound Costello would explore on &quot;Trust&quot; the following year. &quot;Possession&quot; was written in Holland during a five-minute taxi ride heading back to the studio from a local café. Reassuring a recurring theme of finance and business throughout &quot;Get Happy!!&quot;, the song concerns a failed relationship and implies that money be provided rather than love itself. In &quot;Men Called Uncle&quot;, the narrator shows distaste for a woman and her older man. As in other tracks, he displays indifference toward her, but deep down he desires her love and affection. Perone finds the music similar to the pop styles of the 1960s British Invasion.

The lyrics of &quot;Clowntime Is Over&quot; are vague, but Gouldstone argues that it concerns &quot;some kind of lament&quot;; and words and phrases such as &quot;blackmail&quot;, &quot;ransom&quot;, &quot;somebody&#x27;s watching&quot; and &quot;a voice in the shadows&quot; offer sinister undertones. Critic Dave McCullough wrote that the song has a &quot;familiar feeling of aggressive assurity, relayed in a sudden jerk at the end of every verse&quot;. Musically, Nelson compares the song to &quot;circus music from the Weimar Republic&quot; set against a &quot;mechanized march&quot; she likens to Kraftwerk and David Bowie&#x27;s Berlin period.

Unlike the rest of the album, &quot;New Amsterdam&quot; is a folk-like number, and was recorded by Costello alone as a demo. It is a waltz, with nostalgic lyrics about arriving in the New World. Costello has acknowledged his musical inspiration by interpolating the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Hide Your Love Away&quot; into concert performances of &quot;New Amsterdam&quot;. Hinton notes that it is the only song here that comes from a non-persona. &quot;High Fidelity&quot; marks a return to the soul influences, with a sound echoing the Supremes; its opening line also quotes a song title by them. The lyrics are addressed to an ex-partner who now has found a new lover and contain Costello&#x27;s signature wordplay to reference radios and record players.

===Side two===

Opening side two is the cover of &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand Up for Falling Down&quot;, a soul track that describes a hurtful love affair. Gouldstone stated that its presence adds &quot;authentic sixties atmosphere&quot; to the LP. The title of &quot;Black and White World&quot; recalls the early days of cinema and the simpler days of childhood. With a theme of nostalgia similar to &quot;New Amsterdam&quot;, the song reflects on days of innocence gone by, and also combines ideals of time, the media and battles between the sexes set against, in Gouldstone&#x27;s words, &quot;powerful and gripping music&quot;. &quot;5ive Gears in Reverse&quot; implies that society is digressing rather than progressing, with the chorus relating hopelessness and futility. Driven by a guitar riff and bassline, it is sung &quot;lustfully&quot; rather than &quot;lustily&quot;. Hinton finds the track also acts as a &quot;raison d&#x27;etre&quot; for the album, &quot;backwards into the future&quot;.

Both &quot;B Movie&quot; and &quot;Motel Matches&quot; feature wordplay referencing Costello&#x27;s life while on the road for three years, complementing the lyrics on &quot;Armed Forces&quot;. Described by McCullough as &quot;a quivering skeleton of a song&quot;, the former is addressed to a woman, seemingly putting her down and casually hinting at violence. The latter song, while not as brutal, describes an unsatisfactory affair taking place in a motel room, and the story is delivered in such a way that Hinton says &quot;emotion overtakes cleverness&quot;. Returning to ska rhythms in the ambivalent &quot;Human Touch&quot;, the narrator is disgusted by his partner and the world, begins drinking heavily and physically assaulting her, yet he longs for her &quot;human touch&quot;. Gouldstone finds that the music mimics the disintegration of the narrator&#x27;s mind. Hinton likens the track to &quot;Lip Service&quot; from &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; (1978) or, in theory, Costello&#x27;s take on the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da&quot; (1968). Hinton also draws Beatles comparisons for &quot;Beaten to the Punch&quot;, which contains the same bassline as &quot;Taxman&quot; (1966). The energetic song is an attack on a man and his &quot;juvenile macho attitudes&quot;.

Costello based &quot;Temptation&quot; on Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s&#x27; &quot;Time Is Tight&quot; (1969). As a song about alcoholism and defenselessness, it is similar to other &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; tracks, and presumed by Gouldstone to concern the troubles of living in a competitive and bureaucratic society. The author also argues that the cover of &quot;I Stand Accused&quot; could pass as a Costello original due to its performance and use of thematic punning. The final track, &quot;Riot Act&quot;, reflects on a past relationship with &quot;abject desolation&quot; rather than disdain. Costello gives a tender vocal performance that displays emotion and builds into a near-scream by the end. Hinton calls it the &quot;first genuinely relaxed song on the whole LP&quot; and compares the music to the English band Procol Harum, while AllMusic&#x27;s Stewart Mason considers the arrangement &quot;almost bombastic&quot;.

==Packaging and artwork==
According to Hinton, the cover artwork for &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; was designed to resemble a vintage Stax record from the 1960s. Designed by Barney Bubbles, and featuring a clash of changing colours, the geometric sleeve contains three identical images of Costello photographed from above, with his hands in the pockets of a buttoned-up coat and his face appearing &quot;almost deformed&quot;. (This triplicate image is upside-down and taken from a photo of Costello laying down on a cobblestoned alley.) The UK release featured a &quot;pre-worn&quot; look on the sleeve: the center of the front cover showed label ring-wear, while the back featured a larger circle of ring-wear, giving the effect that the vinyl within had worn through the packaging. This effect also appeared on albums manufactured and sold in some European countries and in Japan (including some cassette and CD versions) and omitted from other editions. Original copies also lacked a lyric sheet.

==Release and promotion==
Originally intended for release in early January 1980, &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; was delayed due to legal issues. In December 1979, Radar Records founder Andrew Lauder and Riviera left the label and formed a new independent label, F-Beat Records. Any UK signee to Radar&#x27;s was also signed to the label&#x27;s parent company, Warner Bros, and Warner disliked both Costello and Lowe leaving without recompense. The dispute eventually went to court. Costello attempted to release the first chosen single, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand Up for Falling Down&quot;, on the Specials&#x27; label 2 Tone Records, but Warner blocked its release due to the ongoing legal proceedings. Once resolved, the song, backed by &quot;Girls Talk&quot;, was rush-released as the first single on 8February and reached number four on the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; followed it in the UK a week later on 15February 1980, over a year after its predecessor, released with the catalogue number XXLP 1. In the US, it was issued through Columbia the week of 25February.

Throughout March 1980, Costello and the Attractions toured the UK for the first time in almost a year, playing in smaller venues in lesser-known cities compared to previous live outings. Drawing on material from his four albums up to that point—primarily &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; and &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot;—and covering various soul tunes to reflect Costello&#x27;s renewed appreciation, the shows were greeted positively. Supporting act Clive Langer praised the Attractions: &quot;I was amazed by them live. The power. They would just come out of the dressing room and attack.&quot; Due to his alcohol and drug abuse, Costello himself suffered several moments of instability during the shows, including forgetting lyrics, freezing in place and poor vocals. &quot;High Fidelity&quot; was issued on 12&quot; vinyl as the second single from &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; three days later and reached the UK top 30. The band were back on the road throughout Europe in mid-April, although a car accident resulted in Nieve being temporarily replaced by the Rumour&#x27;s guitarist Martin Belmont. For these shows, the setlists were revised and featured almost no tracks from &quot;Get Happy!!&quot;, save for recent single &quot;High Fidelity&quot;. In June, &quot;New Amsterdam&quot; was released as an EP of the same name with bonus tracks Costello had recorded alone, including &quot;Just a Memory&quot;, &quot;Ghost Train&quot; and &quot;Dr. Luther&#x27;s Assistant&quot;. &quot;New Amsterdam&quot; was also issued a single, backed by &quot;Dr. Luther&#x27;s Assistant&quot;, the same month.

Aided by rising expectations and coverage on soul stations, &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; reached number two on the UK Albums Chart and number 11 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart, although it sold less copies than &quot;Armed Forces&quot; and was viewed as a commercial disappointment. According to Thomson, reasons for its lesser performance possibly included the incident with Stills, Costello&#x27;s decision not to tour in America due to the incident, lack of promotion from Columbia and radio stations disliking the change in musical direction and less pop-friendly tunes compared to &quot;Armed Forces&quot;. The promotional campaign included over 100,000 free posters, over 500 record store window displays, magazine adverts and radio and television ads, which proved fraught for financially struggling F-Beat Records. Lauder later admitted: &quot;We had overpressed on the album based on the sales of &quot;Armed Forces&quot;, which was a platinum album. We had a situation where we were shipping out lots of records and they were all coming back. Having paid for all the advertising and all the publicity, financially it was a tough one to make.&quot;

==Critical reception==

While not receiving the acclaim of its three predecessors, &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics on release. Many commented on the amount of tracks present on the LP, finding they varied in quality. Hilburn said that &quot;by including 20 tunes in the LP, [Costello] demonstrated his disregard for critics and businessmen&quot;. Conversely, Ira Robbins of &quot;Trouser Press&quot; argued that with a condensed track listing, &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; would have been &quot;incredible&quot;, but as it stands, &quot;bad items detract from good ones&quot;. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; acknowledged the presence of &quot;lotsa duds&quot;, but observed some memorable &quot;tropes and hooks&quot;. Several critics also complained of &quot;uneven&quot; material that lacked a consistent theme and criticised the production as generally weaker than &quot;Armed Forces&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Tom Carson felt that &quot;if the new album is hard to get into, it&#x27;s also difficult to ignore&quot;, concluding that Costello has &quot;succeeded in making his obsessions belong to us. For better or worse, we&#x27;ll all ride them out together to the end&quot;.

Other critics offered high praise towards &quot;Get Happy!!&quot;, with &quot;Creem&quot; Jeff Nesin proclaiming: &quot;If you care about rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll you must have this album.&quot; In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Robert Palmer deemed &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; Costello&#x27;s most satisfying work up that point, commenting on the &quot;stylistic range, emotional depth, melodic richness and verbal invention&quot; inside strong songwriting. Joel Selvin of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; also placed it among the artist&#x27;s best work, highlighting the &quot;distinctive&quot; songwriting and Lowe&#x27;s production, which he felt created a &quot;sense of being both precise and off-hand&quot;. &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine&#x27;s Dave McCullough was highly positive, writing that the album &quot;soars to a pinnacle of Costello&#x27;s combined creative force, by the end leaving the listener quite breathless.&quot; Paul Ramble was also positive in &quot;NME&quot;, drawing positive comparisons to &quot;Armed Forces&quot; and announcing: &quot;It&#x27;s a record you didn&#x27;t expect. It looks like fun and it is. Maybe it&#x27;s only a temporary lapse, but Elvis has gotten off the treadmill and gotten happy. Get it.&quot;

Other reviewers praised Costello himself as an artist. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine found the artist &quot;hasn&#x27;t lost any of his stunt or verve on this snappy LP&quot;, which they predicted would be &quot;a sure bet for AOR radio&quot;. &quot;Cash Box&quot; agreed, deducing: &quot;What can you say about the new wave kingpin except that he gets better with age.&quot; The reviewer argued that the amount of tracks on the LP &quot;should make any record buyer happy with the quality and quantity of the material&quot;, a sentiment echoed by Hilburn, who deemed &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; &quot;a vibrant work by someone who both understands rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&#x27;s history and aggressively seeks to shape its future&quot; the &quot;Los Angeles Times.&quot; Hilburn felt it was not as &quot;powerfully framed&quot; as &quot;Armed Forces&quot;, but &quot;still bristle[d] with the independence that has characterized the British rocker&#x27;s brief but provocative career.&quot;

&quot;Get Happy!!&quot; placed at number two on lists of the best albums of 1980 by &quot;NME&quot; (behind Joy Division&#x27;s &quot;Closer&quot;) and &quot;Trouser Press&quot; (behind the Clash&#x27;s &quot;London Calling&quot;), while the album placed seventh on &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s annual Pazz &amp; Jop music critics&#x27; poll, beating out such better selling releases as Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Off the Wall&quot;, Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Hotter than July&quot; and Pete Townshend&#x27;s &quot;Empty Glass&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Get Happy!!&quot; was a turning point in Costello&#x27;s career, being the first step away from the angry persona that he had embodied up to that point. He began adding more of himself into the material, including &quot;a bit more tenderness, a bit more regret, because you make mistakes in your life and you have to sing about those as well as the things you&#x27;re very confident or cocky about.&quot; Throughout mid-1980, Costello began writing new songs and revising older, unused ones that reflected this new form of thinking, debuting a few during live performances during the summer. His next album, &quot;Trust&quot;, was envisioned by the artist as combining the &quot;melodic lushness&quot; of &quot;Armed Forces&quot; and the &quot;rhythmic drive&quot; of &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; Gouldstone comments that the album marked the beginning of Costello&#x27;s &quot;most fruitful period&quot; that yielded the &quot;trilogy of magnificent albums&quot;: &quot;Get Happy!!&quot;, &quot;Trust&quot; and &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; (1982). Gallucci summarised:

===Retrospective appraisal===
Retrospective reviews have been very positive, and &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; has since been considered one of Costello&#x27;s best works. Writing in &quot;(The New) Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, critic Rob Sheffield dubbed it a &quot;tour de force&quot;, a sentiment echoed by senior AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine, who hailed &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; as more than a &quot;genre exercise&quot;. Finding the inconsistent quality of its tracks part of its overall charm, he ended that the album &quot;bursts with energy and invention, standing as a testament to how Costello, the pop encyclopedia, can reinvent the past in his own image&quot;. Chris Jones of BBC Music declared it Costello&#x27;s finest album and &quot;the greatest coherent statement he ever created&quot; in 2008.

In 2015, Gallucci wrote that the album contains some of the artist&#x27;s best songs from the period. He continued that despite being dismissed as a novelty during discussions of Costello&#x27;s works from the 1980s, &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; &quot;may be his most jubilant LP ever&quot;, with all 20 tracks packing &quot;more muscle, hooks, heart and, yes, soul than many of his more acclaimed records that followed.&quot; Discussing the album for its 40th anniversary, Nelson described the LP as &quot;a bracing time capsule of a singer-songwriter at the height of his powers and coming apart under pressure&quot;, drawing comparisons to the Beatles&#x27; &quot;White Album&quot; (1968). She further labelled it &quot;a landmark in maximalist efficiency&quot; that anticipated works by the Minutemen, They Might Be Giants and Aesop Rock, ultimately appraising it as a successful comeback record: &quot;a dizzying display of desperation and talent that remains a fascinating, frantic flare from a sinking ship.&quot;

Some commentators highlighted the performances of the Attractions. Deeming &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; an album of chemistry rather than &quot;individual cameos&quot;, Thomson states that the record showed the backing band at &quot;their rawest and roughest&quot;, with &quot;little sophistication&quot; from &quot;Armed Forces&quot;. Nelson agreed, finding their performances stand out with individual styles that become &quot;almost automated&quot;, thereby &quot;embroidering Costello&#x27;s frenzied impulses into supple, insinuating grooves that can seem at times almost oblivious to the man raving over them&quot;. Perone notes that Pete Thomas&#x27;s bass drum is higher in the mix, giving the tracks a &quot;four-on-the-floor style&quot; that differentiates &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; from other albums Costello made with the Attractions. Writing for &quot;Spin&quot; magazine, Al Shipley referred to it as &quot;an incredible burst of energy&quot; in which &quot;the Attractions&#x27; manic performances and some of Costello&#x27;s most deranged wordplay give the album a frenetic charge even beyond their other early albums.&quot;

&quot;Get Happy!!&quot; has made appearances on several lists of the best albums of the 1980s, including in 1989 by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; at number 11, in 2002 by &quot;Pitchfork&quot; at number 26, and in 2012 by &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; at number 68. Additionally, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed it at number 65 on its list of the best albums of the past 20 years, in 1987. It was also placed at number 298 in the third edition of English writer Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000).

==Reissues==
&quot;Get Happy!!&quot; was first released on CD through Columbia and Demon Records in January 1986. Its first extended reissue through Demon in the UK and Rykodisc in the US on CD came in April 1994. This reissue presented sides one and two in order of the record itself rather than the LP labels and came with a slew of bonus tracks. Rhino Records reissued the album in 2003 as a two-disc set; disc one contained the original 20-track album and disc two contained additional bonus tracks on top of the Rykodisc ones, one of which was a live version of &quot;High Fidelity&quot; that Costello states was his way of performing in the style of Bowie&#x27;s 1976 album &quot;Station to Station&quot;. The album was remastered and reissued by UMe on 6 November 2015, who spread the content across two LPs.

<text>Anberlin is an American alternative rock band formed in Winter Haven, Florida, in 2002. Since the beginning of 2007, the band consists of lead vocalist Stephen Christian, guitarists Joseph Milligan and Christian McAlhaney, bassist Deon Rexroat, and drummer Nathan Young.

Members of Anberlin originally formed a band under the name SaGoh 24/7 in 1998, releasing two studio albums before disbanding, with the members having a change in musical direction and name. Anberlin was formed in 2002; within a year of forming, they had signed with semi-independent record label Tooth &amp; Nail Records and released their debut album, &quot;Blueprints for the Black Market&quot;. In 2005, the band released their second album, &quot;Never Take Friendship Personal&quot;. The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Cities&quot;, was released in 2007, and became their first album to reach the top 20 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 34,000 copies in its debut week.

Anberlin signed with major label Universal Republic in 2007 and in 2008 released &quot;New Surrender&quot;, which peaked at No. 13 on the Billboard 200, with the first single, &quot;Feel Good Drag&quot;, claiming No. 1 on the Alternative Songs chart, after 29 weeks in the chart. Prior to the 2010 release of their fifth studio album, &quot;Dark Is the Way, Light Is a Place&quot;, Anberlin had sold over 1,000,000 albums. Their sixth studio album &quot;Vital&quot; was released October 16, 2012, and rereleased on Big3 Records under the title &quot;Devotion&quot; a year later, October 15, 2013.

On January 16, 2014, it was announced that Anberlin would be disbanding in 2014 after recording their seventh studio album, &quot;Lowborn&quot;, on their original label, Tooth &amp; Nail Records, and touring one last time. After performing concerts in late 2018, the group reunited to tour through 2019. In May 2020, Christian mentioned they were working on new material. Anberlin released their new EP &quot;Silverline&quot; on July 29, 2022.

In October 2023, Christian announced he was taking an indefinite hiatus from touring with the band and was replaced by Memphis May Fire&#x27;s Matty Mullins.

==History==

===SaGoh 24/7 and the origins of Anberlin (1998–2002)===
Lead singer Stephen Christian met bassist Deon Rexroat while they were both in high school, and they formed a punk band called SaGoh 24/7. Drummer Sean Hutson and guitarist Joseph Milligan joined the group as well. The band released two albums, &quot;Servants After God&#x27;s Own Heart&quot; (1999), and &quot;Then I Corrupt Youth&quot; (2001), both under Rescue Records. After the albums sold only 1,300 units, Hutson left the band to start a family, and Nathan Young was brought in as a replacement.

Christian, Milligan and Rexroat began working on a side project, marking the beginning of the end for SaGoh 24/7. The side project&#x27;s sound transformed after a suggestion from Milligan to develop more of a rock sound for Anberlin. They used money left over from shows SaGoh had performed and teamed up with producer Matt Goldman to record five demos. The demos that were then posted on PureVolume (which was mp3.com at the time). On the advice of friends, including Chad Johnson, and Timmy McTague from Underoath, the band signed with Tooth &amp; Nail Records.

===&quot;Blueprints for the Black Market&quot; and &quot;Never Take Friendship Personal&quot; (2002–2005)===

Out of the five demos Anberlin recorded with Matt Goldman, three were eventually chosen to be reworked for the band&#x27;s debut album, the lead single &quot;Readyfuels&quot;, &quot;Driving&quot; (later renamed &quot;Autobahn&quot;) and &quot;Foreign Language&quot;. Another song, &quot;Embrace the Dead&quot;, was also recorded as a demo track and is often mistaken as an Anberlin song, however, the song didn&#x27;t make it onto the band&#x27;s debut album as it didn&#x27;t constitute the stylistic direction the band wanted to head in.

After hearing demos from the band Acceptance, Anberlin chose to record their debut album with the same producer, Aaron Sprinkle, creating a relationship that would last the entire duration of their time with Tooth &amp; Nail Records. Barely a year after their formation, their first album as a new band was entitled &quot;Blueprints for the Black Market&quot; (2003). It failed to chart, but spurred on by their debut single, &quot;Readyfuels&quot;, the album sold over 60,000 units. They toured steadily with other bands in their label.

Rhythm guitarist Joey Bruce was eventually ejected from the band. According to Christian, he was &quot;all about sex, drugs and rock &amp; roll&quot;, and was going in a different direction than the rest of the band. After several failed replacements, Nathan Strayer from The Mosaic took over rhythm guitar duties.

Anberlin released their follow-up to &quot;Blueprints&quot;, &quot;Never Take Friendship Personal&quot;, in early 2005, again produced by Aaron Sprinkle. Charting at No. 144 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the album brought the band closer to the mainstream. &quot;NTFP&quot; was generally more well received by critics than &quot;Blueprints for the Black Market.&quot; Before its release, the band promoted the album by releasing a track per week on their PureVolume and MySpace website accounts, as well as on their own website. Two singles were released from the album: &quot;A Day Late&quot; and &quot;Paperthin Hymn&quot;. Both were reasonably successful on alternative rock radio, with the latter peaking at the No. 38 position on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart.

Anberlin participated in a number of compilations during this time, recording covers of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;, Depeche Mode&#x27;s &quot;Enjoy the Silence,&quot; and the song &quot;Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)&quot;.

===&quot;Cities&quot; and &quot;Lost Songs&quot; (2005–2007)===
Anberlin&#x27;s third album produced by Aaron Sprinkle was released in early 2007 under the title &quot;Cities&quot;. It sold 34,000 copies in its first week of release, debuted at No. 19 on the Billboard 200 chart, and, like their previous album, received fairly positive reviews from critics. Before the release of &quot;Cities&quot;, the band released &quot;Godspeed EP&quot; exclusively through the iTunes Store in late 2006 to give a preview to the new album. In support of the album, Anberlin held their first headlining tour, supported by Bayside, Meg &amp; Dia and Jonezetta.

In an interview about the album, Christian commented that the lyrics throughout the band&#x27;s discography are progressively becoming more mature. &quot;The first CD (&quot;Blueprints for the Black Market&quot;) was childish in the manner that it was Man vs. World in the lyrics. The second (&quot;Never Take Friendship Personal&quot;) was Man Vs. Man. &quot;Cities&quot; is more adult in the manner that it&#x27;s Man Vs. Self. &quot;Cities&quot; was the most anticipated album on Jesus Freak Hideout&#x27;s Most Anticipated Albums of 2007.

Three to four weeks before the release of &quot;Cities&quot;, it was announced that guitarist Nathan Strayer amicably left the band to go back to the Mosaic and that Christian McAlhaney, formerly of the band Acceptance, would take over as the new guitarist.

A compilation album of unreleased material, called &quot;Lost Songs&quot;, was released on November 20, 2007. It features B-sides, demos, covers, and acoustic versions of their previous songs as well as other tracks recorded at Sessions@AOL.

===Universal Republic signing and &quot;New Surrender&quot; (2007–2009)===
The band signed to Universal Republic on August 16, 2007, and soon after began to write material for their major-label debut, entitled &quot;New Surrender&quot;, which was released on September 30, 2008. This was the band&#x27;s first album to not be distributed through Tooth &amp; Nail Records or produced by Aaron Sprinkle. The first song to be heard from the new album was tentatively titled &quot;Bittersweet Memory&quot; during its initial live performances; it was later renamed to &quot;Breaking&quot;, with an acoustic remix of the song included on USB wristbands sold exclusively during the 2008 Warped Tour. On July 11, 2008, the band showcased a second new song called &quot;Disappear&quot; on their MySpace profile. The first actual single from the album was the re-recorded &quot;Feel Good Drag&quot; which was set to go to radio on August 18 - eventually being released on August 26.

The band booked eight weeks of recording sessions with noted producer Neal Avron (New Found Glory, Yellowcard, Fall Out Boy) in early February 2008. Stephen Christian stated in an interview, &quot;We&#x27;re very excited about working with Neal; I think our fans are going to be pleased when they hear the final result.&quot; Christian also discussed the difficulties in writing this record. &quot;When you try to write 29 songs lyrically you find yourself topically working in circles; I only go through so much in one year, but needlessly I have dedicated myself to begin searching books, art, and friends for new directions.&quot; During the recording process, the band set up a live webcam in the studio so fans could watch them record the album via the band&#x27;s MySpace profile. &quot;New Surrender&quot; was placed at the No. 2 spot on Jesus Freak Hideout&#x27;s 25 Most Anticipated Albums of 2008.

In the week of its release, the album sold 36,000 units, entering the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart at No. 13. It also placed at No. 5 on the Top Current Rock chart, according to a Universal Republic press release. In support of the album, the band embarked on a fall headlining U.S. tour alongside Scary Kids Scaring Kids, Straylight Run, and There For Tomorrow. Kyle Flynn, formerly of the band Acceptance, joined the band while on tour doing keys, loops, acoustic guitar, and background vocals. The band then traveled to the United Kingdom where they supported Elliot Minor and played a handful of headlining shows with Furthest Drive Home and Data.Select.Party.

Anberlin went into the studio to record several tracks, including a cover of the New Order song &quot;True Faith&quot;, which was made available online. The band also recorded a cover of the Danzig song &quot;Mother&quot;, which they performed during an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot;. After supporting Taking Back Sunday throughout May and June 2009, the band planned to start writing the follow-up to &quot;New Surrender&quot; in the summer, but the release date was undetermined, as the band needed to give the new material the proper time and effort. They also undertook an Australian tour in August, alongside The Academy Is.... A b-side from &quot;New Surrender&quot;, &quot;A Perfect Tourniquet&quot;, was released on the soundtrack for the TV show &quot;90210&quot;. The cover of New Order&#x27;s &quot;True Faith&quot; was released to radio airplay on November 17, the same day as the Tooth &amp; Nail released &quot;Blueprints for City Friendships: The Anberlin Anthology&quot;, which is a 33-song, three-album set including all the songs from their Tooth &amp; Nail studio albums.

===&quot;Dark Is the Way, Light Is a Place&quot; (2010–2011)===
In an interview with the &quot;South Florida Sun-Sentinel&quot; in December 2009, it was revealed by lead singer Stephen Christian that the band were tentatively due to enter the studio in the beginning of 2010, with a release probable later in the year. He said &quot;it looks like we are going to go to the studio in January, February or March, right around that time&quot;. Drummer Nathan Young stated that the album would be &quot;less poppy&quot; and &quot;darker&quot;. Christian posted on his Twitter account in December 2009, that his choice for an album name was &quot;a go&quot; but did not reveal the name.

The band entered Blackbird Studios, Nashville, to begin recording the album in March 2010. It was announced on March 3 that the band would be working with Grammy Award-winning producer, Brendan O&#x27;Brien. The tracking of the album was completed on April 9, with mixing commencing on April 13, 2010. In an April 2010 interview with MyMag, Christian stated that the album&#x27;s release date is &quot;looking like late July or early August&quot; 2010. However, in a May 2010 interview with Spin Magazine, McAlhaney stated that the album would be released in September 2010.

In early June 2010, the album&#x27;s release date was confirmed to be September 21, 2010. The band also began exposing their new music, with videos of live performances of the album&#x27;s songs appearing online. A press release revealed on June 17 that Anberlin&#x27;s fifth studio album would be titled &quot;Dark Is the Way, Light Is a Place&quot;, taking its title from a line in Dylan Thomas’ &quot;Poem on His Birthday&quot;. Along with the disclosure of a track listing, the press release also announced the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Impossible&quot;, which went to radio play on July 12, 2010.

When asked about the possible impact of the new album, Stephen replied &#x27;I feel like we&#x27;re on the brink of something... either world domination or destruction, but either way we&#x27;re on the brink&#x27;.

Anberlin supported Thirty Seconds to Mars on their Closer to the Edge Tour with CB7 during April and May 2011.

===&quot;Vital&quot; and &quot;Devotion&quot; (2012–2013)===
In an interview with &quot;Common Revolt&quot;, Stephen Christian stated that the band had begun work on their next album. A few songs had been written, including one with the working title &quot;Control&quot; (later renamed Orpheum), and a song influenced by the events in Egypt (later confirmed to be &quot;Someone Anyone&quot;).

The band announced via Facebook and e-mail in February 2012 that they would be returning to Aaron Sprinkle to record their upcoming album. The band recorded their first three albums with Sprinkle; not only is he a good friend of the band but also a fan favorite. The band will begin recording around the start of March, and are not expected to be finished until May. In a recent interview, Stephen Christian announced their new album is finally done. On June 11, during the Nashville show of their acoustic tour, Stephen Christian announced that the title of the new record would be &quot;Vital&quot;, calling the record &quot;their most aggressive to date&quot; and also announced a fall release date. On July 31, the band announced on their official website that &quot;Vital&quot; was to be released on October 16.

The new album&#x27;s opening track, &quot;Self-Starter&quot;,&#x27; was streamed on Billboard.com for free listening on August 17., and the album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Someone Anyone&quot; was released on August 22.

&quot;Infectious&quot; Magazine reported on October 26, 2012, that the band had already &quot;made a lot of headway writing for the next record&quot;.

The band released &quot;City Electric&quot; on September 20, 2013. It is the first of three new and previously unreleased tracks from their rework of &quot;Vital&quot;, &quot;Devotion&quot; which was released on October 15, 2013.

=== Return to Tooth &amp; Nail, &quot;Lowborn&quot; and breakup (2014) ===

On the January 16, 2014, the band posted a video in which the band confirmed that this year would be their last and that they would release their seventh, and seemingly final, studio album in mid-2014 on their original label, Tooth &amp; Nail Records. They also stated that they would do their last set of tours following the release to celebrate what the band had become. On May 6, 2014, Anberlin revealed the title of the album, &quot;Lowborn&quot;, as well as the album artwork. The band played their final show on November 26, 2014, at the House of Blues in Orlando, Florida.

On December 15, 2017, it was announced that the band&#x27;s former rhythm guitarist Nathan Strayer had died. He was 34.

===Reunions, Equal Vision signing and &quot;Vega&quot; (2018–present)===

On October 18, 2018, the band announced that they would reunite for one show on December 14 at the Yuengling Center in Tampa, Florida, as part of Underoath&#x27;s Erase Me Tour. They subsequently announced their first comeback show would be the 13th, a &quot;secret show&quot; at The Orpheum in Tampa. The band implied at these shows that they were coming back full time, as reflected in their social media saying they&#x27;ve been back from 2018 to present. In March 2019, it was announced that the band would perform a series of headlining shows across Australia in May 2019. This expanded to an announcement of a 22-stop U.S. tour the following month. Young stated the band had no plans for a full comeback after the reunion shows. However, Christian revealed in May 2020 that they had reversed course and were in the process of recording new music.

On September 2, 2021, the band released their first new song in over seven years, &quot;Two Graves&quot; on their Youtube channel, and began touring two days later to promote the song.

Anberlin released an EP, &quot;Silverline&quot;, on July 29, 2022, via Equal Vision Records, with whom they signed earlier in the month. Mixed by Jeremy SH Griffith and Mastered by Jonathan Berlin at The Loft Studio LA.

On June 9, 2023, Anberlin released a single entitled “Lacerate” via Equal Vision Records. It was the first single to feature guitarist Christian McAlhaney on lead vocals and the first from the EP &quot;Convinced&quot;, which was released on June 30, 2023. Mixed by Jeremy SH Griffith and Mastered by Jonathan Berlin at The Loft Studio LA. After the EP&#x27;s release, the band appeared at the 3-day Furnace Fest event in September.

On October 10, 2023, lead singer Stephen Christian initially announced an indefinite hiatus from the band for touring. Memphis May Fire singer Matty Mullins was named Anberlin&#x27;s new live lead vocalist. On June 14, 2024, the band announced their album &quot;Vega&quot;, which is the combination of their 2022 and 2023 EPs &quot;Silverline&quot; and &quot;Convinced&quot;, with a release date of August 2, 2024, as well as featuring two songs with Mullins on lead vocals, &quot;Walk Alone&quot; and &quot;Seven&quot;, the former released on June 21 with a music video. One day before the album&#x27;s release, the band released the music video for &quot;Seven&quot;.

==Origin of name==

Anberlin lead vocalist Stephen Christian has stated different origins of the band&#x27;s name in various interviews, prevalent among which was his claim that he had long intended to name his first daughter Anberlin. Struggling to find a name for the band, Stephen suggested it; &quot;We were all sitting around trying to come up with a name. None of us were married or had kids, but one day I was going to name my daughter Anberlin, so I figured we could name the band that until we thought of something better. So we chose Anberlin and no one has thought of anything better.&quot; He stated he was no longer going to use Anberlin to name his first daughter, however he said, &quot;If I ever have a daughter and name her Anberlin, she&#x27;ll think she was named after the band instead of the other way around.&quot; Christian had also stated in another interview that the band&#x27;s name was created when he was thinking about cities in Europe he wanted to visit. In his mind he listed &quot;London, Paris, Rome, and Berlin.&quot; Christian thought that &quot;and Berlin&quot; would be an appropriate name for a band, and so when the band was looking for a name Christian suggested &quot;And Berlin,&quot; which was then modified to &quot;Anberlin.&quot;

Christian has since retracted those comments admitting that when the band first started, in interviews they &quot;would take turn making stories about how it came to be&quot; as a joke, as he believed the actual origin of the band name wasn&#x27;t interesting enough. Christian said there was a story about how his grandfather had &quot;saved a little girl from a World War II bombing... her name was Anberlin&quot; and that they had hit a dog, which had the name Anberlin, with the stories getting more diverse, it was decided they reveal the true origin. He has said the &quot;real&quot; name came from the Radiohead song &quot;Everything in Its Right Place&quot;, stating that &quot;There are several stories that have circulated on the internet, but the actual story is when I was in college my favorite band was Radiohead; on one of their songs off the record &quot;Kid A&quot; there is a background noise on the song &quot;Everything in Its Right Place&quot; (about 2 minutes 31 seconds into the song). While Thom (Yorke) is singing &quot;try to say&quot; I always thought the background noise sounded like &quot;Anberlin&quot;, I always thought that Anberlin would have been a great band name and well...it was/is.&quot;

==Christianity==
Over the years, many fans, critics, and other members of the media have consistently characterized Anberlin as a Christian band. However, Stephen Christian stated in an interview that their faith is more complicated than a simple label: &quot;I think we&#x27;re categorized like that a lot because we&#x27;re on Tooth &amp; Nail Records, which, years ago, was known as a Christian label and never lost that reputation. I don&#x27;t care who listens to our records. If it helps people in whatever circumstances they&#x27;re in, that&#x27;s amazing, but I definitely don&#x27;t classify us as a Christian band.&quot; Elsewhere, Christian has remarked, &quot;[My faith] affects every single aspect of my life, but I&#x27;m not a preacher, I&#x27;m an entertainer.&quot;

Despite these statements and others of the like, multiple sources list the band as part of the Christian rock genre, and some Anberlin song lyrics do contain Christian references. Furthermore, the band appears at Christian music festivals such as Parachute Music Festival and Cornerstone Festival, and their songs have been included on Christian rock compilation CDs and DVDs. They are also played on the Gospel Music Channel.

Anberlin has also been repeatedly featured in Christian rock magazine &quot;HM&quot; (&quot;Hard Music&quot;, which was originally the fanzine &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Metal&quot;). Christian submitted a letter to the magazine, criticizing the more overtly religious Christian punk band the Knights of the New Crusade for a promotional image that represented a &quot;black mark on the face of Christianity&quot;.

Christian has also said in an interview with Lightforce radio how the band tries to &quot;step out of the bubble&quot; and referred to themselves as being part of Christian music. He discussed in detail what Christians should do in their lives: love and embrace others as Jesus would as well as show God&#x27;s grace to others. He mentioned as well how the band Fall Out Boy said in an interview that they did not really know much about Jesus until Anberlin toured with them.

In an interview with Smartpunk, drummer Nathan Young commented, &quot;The thing is, some bands that are trying to get out of the Christian market, they get bummed out by questions about it. I don’t really mind it, because I’m a Christian, and I’m okay talking about it. With the whole term &#x27;Christian Band,&#x27; I don’t understand how a band can be Christian. We get the question, &#x27;Is Anberlin a Christian band?&#x27; and it’s like, yeah, Anberlin is — as humans&quot;.

<text>The Fastest Guitar Alive is a 1967 American musical comedy Western film directed by Michael D. Moore and starring singer Roy Orbison in his only acting role. The film features Orbison performing seven original songs, which appeared on his 1967 MGM album of the same name. His song &quot;There Won&#x27;t Be Many Coming Home&quot; is featured in the 2015 western film &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot;.

==Plot==
Near the end of the American Civil War, a Southern spy (Orbison) with a bullet-shooting guitar is given the task of robbing gold bullion from the United States Mint in San Francisco to help finance the ill-fated Confederacy&#x27;s last-ditch war effort.

==Cast==
* Roy Orbison as Johnny Banner
* Sammy Jackson as Steve Menlo
* Maggie Pierce as Flo Chesnut
* Joan Freeman as Sue Chesnut
* Lyle Bettger as Charlie
* John Doucette as Marshal Max Cooper
* Patricia Donahue as Stella DeWitt
* Ben Cooper as Deputy Rink
* Ben Lessy as Indian Chief
* Douglas Kennedy as Sheriff Joe Stedman
* Iron Eyes Cody as First Indian
* Sam the Sham as First Expressman

==Production and release==
Filming began September 1966. Although Orbison was pleased with the film, it proved to be a critical and box office flop. While MGM had included five films in his contract, no more were made.

==Soundtrack==

A soundtrack album for the film was released in June 1967 on MGM Records. It was the only album to consist entirely of Roy Orbison/Bill Dees originals. Its single &quot;There Won&#x27;t Be Many Coming Home&quot; reached No. 18 in the UK and entered the Australian chart at its highest position of #32 before slipping down the chart.

The album was also included in the 2015 box set &quot;The MGM Years 1965–1973 – Roy Orbison&quot;.

=== Reception ===
Richie Unterberger of AllMusic said the album &quot;includes what may be his best obscure tune, the rarely anthologized &quot;Whirlwind.&quot; With its galloping rhythm, emotive operatic vocals, swirling strings, and ghostly backing vocals, it recalls the best uptempo ballads that he recorded during his early-&#x27;60s heyday at the Monument label.&quot;

Billboard described the album as &quot;a pack powerful emotion.&quot;

Cashbox gave the album a positive reviews, notes &quot;These tunes, in addition to three other Orbison originals, are included&quot;

<doc id="1344555" wikidata="Q1937859" url="?curid=1344555" title="Mohiro Kitoh">
<text>is a Japanese manga artist. He created the manga &quot;Shadow Star&quot; and &quot;Bokurano: Ours&quot;, both of which were adapted into anime series. 

==Biography==
Kitoh&#x27;s first manga &quot;Vendémiaire no Tsubasa&quot; debuted in &quot;Afternoon&quot; magazine in 1995. It consists of several short stories where mechanical puppet humanoids called Vendemaires meet and serve boys of various character and morals. &quot;Vendémiaire no Tsubasa&quot; ran until 1997 and was published by Kodansha in 2 volumes. It was followed in 1999 by &quot;SiNNa 1905,&quot; a single-volume online manga detailing a civil war in an alternate-history Japan.

Kitoh&#x27;s next major manga series was a science-fiction drama called &quot;Shadow Star&quot;, also known in Japan as &quot;Narutaru&quot;, about elementary and middle-schoolers who adopt alien starfish-like creatures. It ran in &quot;Afternoon&quot; from 1998 to 2003, and was adapted into an anime series in 2003. It was among the jury-selected works of Japan Media Arts Festival 2001.

Kitoh released his manga series &quot;&quot;, about a group of children who participate in a real-life robot battle against alien invaders but whose victories cost their lives. It was serialized in &quot;Ikki&quot; magazine from 2003 to 2009 and published in 11 volumes. A one-shot spinoff, &quot;Bokurano Tokubetsu-hen&quot; was announced but not published in &quot;Ikki&quot; magazine, but rather bundled with the 11th tankōbon volume. It was adapted into an anime series, however the director Hiroyuki Morita made changes to the anime story with Kitoh&#x27;s permission. In 2010, &quot;Bokurano&quot; won an Excellence Prize in the Manga Division at the 14th Japan Media Arts Festival Awards.

In 2011, he designed the Septentrion invader characters in the video game &quot;Devil Survivor 2&quot;, which was also made into an anime. Around the same time, Kitoh also served as a character designer for the animated film &quot;,&quot; in which he was responsible for the design of the Third Angel.

From 2009 to 2015, Kitoh worked on the manga &quot;Noririn&quot;, serialized in Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;Evening&quot; magazine, about a salaryman who loses his driver&#x27;s license and takes up cycling along with a road racing high school girl. It ran for 11 volumes.

In 2015, Kitoh released &quot;Futago no Teikoku&quot;, a fantasy manga which takes place in a world resembling Japanese-occupied China during the 1930s and concerns a girl cursed to kill anyone who touches her. So far three volumes have been written.

His most recent manga, &quot;Hayabusa-chan mo Tondemasu&quot; was released in January 2017.

<text>Maryland Route 200 (MD 200), also known as the Intercounty Connector or ICC, is an controlled-access toll road in the U.S. state of Maryland. It connects Gaithersburg in Montgomery County and Laurel in Prince George&#x27;s County, both of which are suburbs of Washington, D.C. The ICC was one of the most controversial Maryland road projects; opposition to the highway stalled the project for decades, and construction did not begin until 60 years after the highway&#x27;s initial approval.

The highway was originally proposed in 1950, was in length, and part of the Washington Outer Beltway. While other parts of the Outer Beltway were canceled, the ICC and the Fairfax County Parkway remained on master plans. The road&#x27;s long history as an unbuilt proposed road stems from the controversy that has surrounded it over the years, including the cost of about $2.38 billion to complete the highway and related environmental mitigation.

Proponents of the highway claimed that it would improve the flow of interregional traffic, relieve traffic congestion on local roads, spur economic development, and enhance access to Baltimore-Washington International Airport. Opponents of the highway claimed that the road would instead harm significant traffic flow characteristics, harm the environment, and disrupt established communities through which it passes. They also argued that &quot;environmental degradation would immediately occur from the construction (loss of forests, wetlands, and animal habitats), [and instill] long-term consequences (air pollution and carbon emissions from additional driving, more sprawl development, less money to fund mass transit projects, etc.).&quot;

Fulfilling a 2002 campaign promise, Maryland Governor Robert Ehrlich pushed to begin construction of the road and conducted a formal groundbreaking in October 2006. With additional support from his successor, Governor Martin O&#x27;Malley, construction began on November 13, 2007. The first segment, from Interstate 370 (I-370) to MD 28, opened on February 23, 2011, while the extension to I-95 opened on November 22, 2011. The final segment to U.S. Route 1 (US 1) opened on November 7, 2014. MD 200 uses all-electronic tolling, with tolls payable through E-ZPass or Video Tolling.

MD 200 begins at a trumpet interchange with MD 200A (Metro Access Road), which heads south to provide access to Shady Grove Road and the Shady Grove station serving Washington Metro&#x27;s Red Line, near Gaithersburg in Montgomery County; west of this interchange the freeway continues as I-370 toward MD 355 and I-270. Several new ramps and collector-distributor roads were built between this interchange and MD 355. MD 200 continues northeast from there as a six-lane freeway through Redland Station, turning east to pass over Shady Grove Road, and then under Redland Road, paralleling Mill Creek. This is the location of the eastbound toll gantry. MD 200 shortly curves to the east on the approach to the six-lane overpass for Olde Mill Run, which was built wide enough for a fourth lane in the eastbound direction. The Olde Mill Run overpass is the only section of MD 200 with full shoulders on each side. After the overpass, MD 200 turns southeast, passing over Rock Creek and the Upper Rock Creek Trail and under Needwood Road, before turning sharply back to the east as it passes under MD 115 (Muncaster Mill Road). The route, now running slightly to the southeast, begins the approach to MD 97 (Georgia Avenue).
MD 200 then turns more eastward, running towards North Branch Stream Valley Park and passing over the North Branch Rock Creek and a second stream over a bridge. This is the location of the westbound toll gantry. The route enters the Norbeck area and passes under Emory Lane. Just east of there is where a hybrid cloverleaf interchange with MD 97 (Georgia Avenue) is located. A park and ride lot serving MTA Maryland commuter buses is located southwest of this interchange along MD 97. When the road opened in February 2011, it temporarily came to an end at a traffic light located just east of MD 97 at MD 28 (Norbeck Road).

The route then curves southeastward, passing under MD 28 and Longmead Crossing Drive, running parallel to Wintergate Drive/Park Vista Drive. MD 200 then curves slightly more eastward toward Aspen Hill, where the freeway intersects MD 182 (Layhill Road), shortly after entering the Northwest Branch Recreational Park. The route travels through the park for a stretch, bridging the Northwest Branch Anacostia River three times (the second bridge also carries MD 200 over Bonifant Road), exits the park, and then turns eastward, passing under Notley Road. MD 200 then turns slightly to the northeast near Colesville and meets MD 650 at a single-point urban interchange.
MD 200 then continues eastward, passes through Upper Paint Branch Park and bridges several creeks, including the namesake Paint Branch, and passes between several neighborhoods upon exiting the park. The route then passes under Old Columbia Pike with no access to this local road. Just beyond, MD 200 reaches a large interchange with US 29, combining cloverleaf and stack elements. This interchange also adds connections to Fairland Road with both MD 200 and US 29. The route continues eastward, featuring a partial interchange with Briggs Chaney Road (westbound exit and eastbound entrance), and then, just after crossing the border into Prince George&#x27;s County, it passes over the Little Paint Branch just south of the Fairland Recreational Park. The route then passes under Old Gunpowder Road.

The route then enters Calverton, where the expansive interchange with I-95 is located. The interchange, marked as Exit 31 on I-95, is mostly a cloverleaf hybrid, and features several collector-distributor roads built along I-95, stretching from Old Gunpowder Road south of the interchange to MD 198 north of it. The community of Konterra is planned for construction near this interchange.

Beyond I-95, MD 200 narrows to four lanes. MD 200 curves sharply, first to the south then to the east, and meets a diamond-interchange providing access to Konterra Drive (MD 206). MD 200 then turns gradually to the southeast and ends at a continuous flow intersection at US 1 (Baltimore Avenue) in Beltsville.

MD 200 is a part of the main National Highway System for its entire length.

==Tolls==

The Intercounty Connector uses all-electronic tolling, with tolls payable through E-ZPass or Video Tolling, which uses automatic license plate recognition. ICC users without E-ZPass are mailed a bill to pay the toll along with a 50% surcharge for non-E-ZPass use (minimum of $1). The tolls along the full length of the road (between I-370 and I-95) vary by time of day, ranging from $1.60 overnight to $3.20 in off-peak daytime, and $4 at rush hour (for E-ZPass users; for others toll rates will be approximately 50% higher). Tolls were waived along the road between February 23 and March 7, 2011, and again between November 22 and December 4, 2011.

==History==
===Washington Outer Beltway===

The Intercounty Connector can be traced to plans developed in the 1950s for the proposed Washington Outer Beltway. The original Outer Beltway had been planned to pass south of the corporate limits of the City of Rockville. The original proposed routing was south and east of the current alignment. The new route was motivated in part by a desire to move the routing of the proposed bridge over the Potomac River upstream from the area of River Bend to Watkins Island. Virginia residents and the United States Department of the Interior objected to the proposed bridge over the Potomac River because they wanted to create state and federal parks along the river in order to protect sugar maple trees, vegetation, and bald eagles. Because of these concerns, the Maryland State Roads Commission moved the proposed Outer Beltway to a route north of Rockville and eliminated a new bridge crossing the Potomac River.

The Montgomery County Planning Board accepted the state&#x27;s newly proposed route in 1970, but the Montgomery County Council rejected it, and Prince George&#x27;s County and Virginia dropped it from their plans. In 1975, the National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments endorsed a request from the State Highway Administration &quot;for federal support of a $1.1 million planning and engineering study of the first segment of the road&quot;, which was to &quot;run from the Baltimore-Washington Parkway near Beltsville westward to a point near Interstate Rte 70S at Gaithersburg.&quot; By 1976, Maryland&#x27;s Secretary of Transportation no longer supported state financial support of the Outer Beltway, although Montgomery County still supported it in concept.

===Initial Intercounty Connector plan===

In 1980, the state of Maryland dropped the Washington Outer Beltway from its plans except for the Intercounty Connector. Meanwhile, the State Highway Administration was studying constructing a Intercounty Connector with a spur called the Rockville Facility.

After six days of public workshops, the Maryland State Highway Administration released its first report about the Intercounty Connector and the Rockville Facility in January 1980. The majority of participants supported the highway, although almost everyone said they would prefer building more east–west public transportation instead.

In 1983, the federal National Capital Planning Commission formally requested that the eastern end of the Intercounty Connector be shortened by so that the eastern terminus of the road would be at I-95 rather than the Baltimore–Washington Parkway. In 1984, Maryland Secretary of Transportation Lowell K. Bridwell designated land in Montgomery and Prince George&#x27;s counties as the future site of the Intercounty Connector so that the right-of-way would be preserved, even though Montgomery County Executive Charles W. Gilchrist had voiced very critical comments about the Intercounty Connector as it was envisioned in 1983—at least in part because he felt that construction of the ICC by the year 2000 was &quot;infeasible&quot;, and advocated construction of a &quot;shorter and less-costly&quot; east–west highway instead.
Prior to Governor Parris N. Glendening declaring the Intercounty Connector &quot;dead&quot; before leaving office in January 2003, two environmental impact studies had been conducted, the first being a draft document in 1983. In 1977, the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center expressed concerns about the impact that the ICC would have on its experiments. An initial environmental study was undertaken in the late 1970s, and extended into the 1980s, with a draft published in 1983. A second study was initiated around 1992, and a draft environmental impact statement was issued in 1997. The final environmental impact statement was drafted by 1989 but did not receive federal approval, leading to the abandonment of the study until a new study began in 1992; the 1992–1997 study pointed to a similar conclusion, though it was never completed. By 1997, millions of dollars had been spent on planning and preliminary engineering, but the only segments of the road that had been built were I-370 between I-270 and the Shady Grove Metrorail station on WMATA&#x27;s Red Line.

===Glendening rejects Transportation Solutions Group recommendations===
After the 1997 Intercounty Connector Draft Environmental Impact Statement process was put on hold by Governor Glendening, much controversy resulted between groups and persons in favor of the ICC and those opposed. The Intercounty Counnector became a political issue in 1998, an election year in Maryland. A blue-ribbon committee entitled the Transportation Solutions Group was formed in 1998 to tell the Governor&#x27;s Smart Growth Sub-Cabinet about intermodal transportation that complied with state and regional goals.
The Transportation Solutions Group, chaired by Thomas B. Deen, former executive director of the Transportation Research Board, met at a series of meetings over about 14 months in 1998 and 1999.
Policy suggestions and recommendations made by the Transportation Solutions Group included that most of the group supports &quot;providing high-speed bus transit, HOV and SOV access through a new east-west, value priced, limited-access parkway&quot;, with some opposition to the parkway and that the group had a divided opinion on a freeway, with most supporting it. The Transportation Solutions Group had initially voted to oppose the Intercounty Connector on its master planned route, but voted 10 in favor and 4 opposed in February 1999 to endorse a highway alternative with the condition that single-occupant vehicles be charged a toll.
At its final meeting in June 1999, the Transportation Solutions Group held a public hearing in College Park and voted 12 to 4 in favor of a &quot;parkway-like highway from I-270 to I-95, following the general path of the ICC.&quot;

The Transportation Solutions Group also made a recommendation that a system of high-occupancy toll lanes (with variable pricing) be implemented on major freeways of the region, including the Intercounty Connector, I-95, the Capital Beltway, I-270 and US 50.

On September 22, 1999, Glendening chose to reject the Transportation Solutions Group recommendation, asserting that the project was &quot;wrong&quot;, &quot;inconsistent with Smart Growth doctrine&quot;, and an &quot;environmental disaster&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; quoted Glendening quoted as saying, &quot;It is a proposal that has fractured our communities. It has pitted neighbor against neighbor. And it has created political gridlock while traffic gridlock has only worsened.&quot;

Even though Glendening chose to ignore the Transportation Solutions Group&#x27;s primary recommendation, its work was not entirely in vain, as its efforts were to be cited prominently some years later in the Intercounty Connector&#x27;s Final Environmental Impact Statement . The concept of a regionwide network of HOT lanes (to be called &quot;variably priced highway lanes&quot;) was further developed by the Transportation Planning Board, and a regional network (including the Intercounty Connector) was described in a report published in February 2008.

After rejecting the Intercounty Connector, Glendening and opponents of the Intercounty Connector then examined the possibility of selling its right-of-way, but proponents of the Intercounty Connector would have been able to stop such a sale at the Board of Public Works, which must approve transactions involving the sale of state-owned real estate.

===Montgomery County steps in===

In 1999, staff to the Montgomery County Planning Board said that the Intercounty Connector could be removed from master plans, but that such an effort would take &quot;six or seven years&quot; to accomplish. In November 1999, the Montgomery County Council discussed removing the Intercounty Connector from master plans, and while five of the nine members were opposed to the Intercounty Connector, the District 4 member, Marilyn Praisner, declined to agree to removal of the master-planned route, for fear that the so-called Northern Alignment (Corridor 2 in the 2005 Draft Environmental Impact Statement) would become a &quot;de facto&quot; Intercounty Connector in the future. The effort by Montgomery County politicians to remove the Intercounty Connector from its plans irritated powerful members of the Maryland General Assembly (notably Senate President Thomas V. &quot;Mike&quot; Miller), who discussed legislative measures that could be taken in the General Assembly to thwart such a move. In February 2000, an agreement between Montgomery County&#x27;s politicians and members of the General Assembly reached an agreement &quot;memorialized in two letters but not cast in stone&quot; that the &quot;... Council agreed not to take any action to kill the ICC during the next three years.&quot;

In 2000, Montgomery County Planning Board established the Transportation Policy Report and then the more-inclusive Transportation Policy Report II Task Force &quot;... in an effort to establish a framework for future Master Plans and to help set priorities for future infrastructure.&quot;
The Transportation Policy Report II Task Force had 33 members, including persons in favor of the Intercounty Connector and those opposed.
The Transportation Policy Report II Task Force listed the Intercounty Connector in its recommended network, following a caveat that &quot;If they are found feasible and ultimately judged desirable to implement, the priority of implementation could be established at that time.
When the Montgomery County Council was briefed on the report, discussions quickly shifted to the Intercounty Connector and the controversy associated with it.
The Intercounty Connector&#x27;s Final Environmental Impact Statement makes specific reference to the work done by the Transportation Policy Report II Task Force.

The Maryland State Senate, in its 2002 session, passed Senate Joint Resolution 8, which asked Glendening to restart the Intercounty Connector Environmental Impact Statement that had been put on hold in 1997. The Maryland House of Delegates passed an accompanying resolution, House Joint Resolution 10 with essentially similar provisions. The Intercounty Connector study was not to be restarted until Glendening left office at the end of 2002.

===Revival===

In 2003, Governor Ehrlich followed through with his campaign promise to resurrect the Intercounty Connector study, and he was allowed a fast-track review process by the United States Secretary of Transportation, Norman Mineta. In addition to the election of Ehrlich, the Montgomery County Council that was seated at the end of 2002 had a 6–3 majority of members in favor of the project. Prior to the 2002 election, a majority had been skeptical, if not outright opposed, to the project. The Montgomery County Council and County Executive Douglas M. Duncan issued a resolution endorsing the Intercounty Connector in December 2002.

On April 21, 2004, the Transportation Planning Board voted to include the Intercounty Connector in future networks of the Washington region&#x27;s transportation system for purposes of forecasting changes in air quality. On November 17, 2004, the Transportation Planning Board endorsed regional transportation plans which included the Intercounty Connector, determining that the proposed plans met air quality goals and that funding for the project was adequate.

On July 11, 2005, Governor Ehrlich announced the state&#x27;s preference to build the Intercounty Connector along Corridor 1. Corridor 1 (approximately 80% of which is the Master Plan Alignment) has been on the books for decades; Corridor 2, also known as the Northern Alignment, was designed to reduce Corridor 1&#x27;s impact on the environment. While the EPA gave Corridor 2 a higher environmental rating, it was eventually rejected by the state due to the increased number of homes and businesses that would have to be removed for its construction, because of negative environmental impacts on the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission&#x27;s Rocky Gorge Reservoir on the Patuxent River (which is a source of drinking water for much of the WSSC service area), and because it was not consistent with several approved and adopted Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission master plans in Montgomery and Prince George&#x27;s Counties.

On August 31, 2005, the Board of Public Works gave its approval to the Corridor 1 alternative, which allowed state funding of the project in accordance with Maryland&#x27;s provisions (established by statute) for funding a &quot;growth-related project&quot; that is not entirely within Priority Funding Areas.

In December 2005, controversy arose over the Intercounty Connector&#x27;s proposed toll rate. At a proposed , an end-to-end driver would have to pay about $6 a day for a round-trip (about $1,500 per year).

On May 30, 2006, the Federal Highway Administration gave approval to the Corridor 1 plan, meaning that Maryland had satisfied &quot;all environmental, economic and community requirements and that it can build the highway&quot;. The &quot;Baltimore Business Journal&quot; wrote, &quot;Federal approval for the $2.4 billion connector came after Ehrlich made a direct request to President George W. Bush, who named the Intercounty Connector as one of his priority projects. The president&#x27;s direct attention prompted federal resource agencies to give the project a more timely environmental review.&quot;

As approved, the Intercounty Connector would be long, running from I-370 in Gaithersburg to I-95 in Beltsville. It would be a controlled access toll-highway with eight interchanges, and two park-and-ride lots would be built as well. The project included $370 million for mitigation and environmental stewardship activities in order to address the impact of communities, wetlands, streams, wildlife, forests, air quality, historic resources, and parklands.

===Construction===

The SHA constructed the ICC using separate design-build contracts for five phases.
* A. I-270/I-370 to east of MD 97
* B. East of MD 97 to west of US 29
* C. West of US 29 to east of I-95 interchange, and I-95 collector/distributor road improvements along I-95 from MD 212 to just north of the ICC
* D. Collector/distributor road improvements along I-95 from just north of the ICC to north of MD 198, including a new exit on the interstate at Konterra Drive
* E. East of I-95 interchange to US 1

The first of the five contracts was awarded on March 27, 2007. The contract, worth $478.7 million, was awarded to Intercounty Constructors, a joint venture of Granite Construction Company, Corman Construction Inc. and G.A. &amp; F.C. Wagman, Inc. Construction on the section between I-370 and MD 97 began in November 2007.
Contracts for three other phases are completed and the fifth phase involving collector-distributor lanes along I-95 has been completed.

Requests for statements of qualification were issued for Phase A in December 2005, for Phase D in August 2006, and for Phase B in August 2007.

The selection of the second of the five contracts was announced on November 20, 2007. The contract, worth $513.9 million, was awarded to IC3, a joint venture of Shirley Contracting Company, LLC; Clark Construction Group, LLC; Guy F. Atkinson Construction, LLC; Facchina Construction Company, Inc. and Trumbull Corporation. This work includes the ICC from a point west of US 29 to I-95, and interchanges with those routes.

On September 4, 2008, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that the Contract B construction contract had been awarded on July 22, 2008, to a joint venture of Kiewit, Corman Construction, and G.A. &amp; F.C. Wagman, at a total cost of about $559.7 million—reportedly 22% higher than previous estimates. The &quot;Post&quot; story went on to say that a protest of this contract award was filed on July 30, 2008, by a joint venture that was not selected, though the bid price from the rejected group was lower. This protest may have delayed the start of construction on Contract B. On October 15, 2008, the &quot;Post&quot; reported that the protest was denied by state procurement officer Robert P. Gay and that the losing proposer would file an appeal with the Maryland State Board of Contract Appeals.

On September 12, 2008, the &quot;Post&quot; reported that Contract D ran into funding issues which had delayed its construction.
Contract D is associated with the proposed new interchange of I-95 and Contee Road (not part of the ICC). SHA Former Administrator Neil J. Pedersen stated that the &quot;service roads can be delayed until the I-95 interchange has been built at Contee Road.&quot;
The first segment opened on February 23, 2011, ahead of its projected spring 2011 opening. No tolls were charged on the date of opening to March 6, 2011. On the opening morning, over 10,000 vehicles used the highway, and it went on to draw in 30,000 vehicles per day. During the first week of May, the tollway drew 11,490 vehicles per day, which is much less than the 21,000 projected (though by 2014, this section of highway was averaging almost 40,000 vehicles per day on average). As a result, the state launched a $1.4 million advertising campaign to promote the new highway. The second segment of the highway, from MD 97 to I-95 opened on November 22, 2011. The highway was opened between I-95 and US 1 on November 7, 2014.

===Funding===
The $2.56-billion project was funded from several sources, including $1.23 billion of Maryland Transportation Authority revenue bonds (50%), $0.75 billion of Grant Anticipation Revenue Vehicle bonds (31%), $0.26 billion from the Maryland General Fund (11%); $0.18 billion from the Maryland Transportation Trust Fund (7%); and $0.18 billion from Special Federal Funds (1%).

===Opposition===

MD 200 has gained opposition from several groups, including the Maryland General Assembly and the Prince George&#x27;s County Council. Proponents of the highway have claimed that it will improve the flow of interregional traffic, relieving traffic congestion on local roads. Opponents of the highway have claimed that the road will (with a few limited exceptions) harm significant traffic flow characteristics (such as increasing drive times, congestion, and costs in the form of tolls), will harm the environment (with air, sea and land impacts), and will disrupt established communities through which it passes.

====Government====
Members of the Maryland General Assembly stated opposition in the Spring 2008 and Spring 2009 sessions, the 1998 session, and back to 1979, when a bill introduced in the General Assembly by Delegate Robin Ficker proposed to eliminate funding for a study of the ICC and the never-built Rockville Facility highway project.
In 1980, a bill proposed by Delegate Idamae Garrott to forbid the Maryland Department of Transportation from even studying the matter of new highways running east and west between Montgomery and Prince George&#x27;s Counties was tabled by the Montgomery County Delegation.

In the 1998 session, House Bill 817 was introduced to prohibit MDOT from spending funds or granting approvals to the ICC project, and House Bill 905 was intended to stop the operation of a toll highway altogether. Both bills failed to pass. In 2004, House Bill 732 proposed a similar statement to House Bill 817, extended to include the MdTA. The 2007 Special Session saw the offering of House Bill 37 to prevent construction of the road. Both of these bills also failed to pass. In the 2008 session, two bills proposing to cancel or delay the project were introduced—House Bill 1416 and House Bill 1471. House Bill 1471 proposed to eliminate funding for the road, and, if it had passed, would trigger &quot;liquidated damage clauses that would require it to pay the contractors an estimated $80.0 million upon cancellation of the contracts,&quot; according to the Fiscal Note prepared by the state&#x27;s Department of Legislative Services. Both bills failed.

In the 2009 session, a bill proposing to cancel funding for the ICC was pre-filed by Delegate Barbara A. Frush—House Bill 27. This bill had not attracted any co-sponsors nor had it been scheduled for a hearing. A similar bill, Senate Bill 753, was filed in the Maryland Senate by Sen. E. J. Pipkin and others. The Maryland Politics Watch blog opined that Pipkin&#x27;s co-sponsorship of SB 753 may be related to his possible desire to run again for the U.S. House of Representatives Maryland District 1 seat. Both bills failed in the 2009 session. House Bill 27 received an unfavorable report from the House of Delegates Appropriations Committee on March 28, 2009; and no action was taken on Senate Bill 753 prior to adjournment on April 13, 2009, though a hearing was scheduled on March 18, 2009, before the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee.

The position of the County Council of Prince George&#x27;s County in opposition to the ICC has been repeatedly cited by opposition groups, and its 2003 resolution on the subject, CR-32-2003, was adopted on June 10, 2003, where it called for alternatives to the road.
In 2007, the Prince George&#x27;s County Council passed resolution CR-59-2007, which repeats much of what was stated in CR-32-2003, including the language endorsing the ICC in Prince George&#x27;s County.

====Environmental groups====

In November 2006, environmental groups announced that they were preparing to file suit in order to delay or stop the project, and
lawsuits aimed at halting construction were filed by environmental groups and affected residents, assisted in part by &quot;pro bono&quot; legal counsel from the Institute for Public Representation of the Georgetown University Law Center. One of those lawsuits was originally filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (possibly as part of a forum shopping effort to avoid having the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals hear the case on appeal – though the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which would have heard any appeals from the D.C. federal court, had ruled against the Sierra Club and allied groups on similar legal issues in reversing a lower court on a case involving the proposal to reconstruct and widen the Woodrow Wilson Bridge in 1999) but Judge Gladys Kessler of the D.C. federal court ordered the matter transferred to federal court in Maryland on May 17, 2007 and the suits were consolidated. After hearings in October 2007, both lawsuits were dismissed in their entirety on November 8, 2007 by Judge Alexander Williams, Jr. of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland in a 105-page memorandum opinion.

&quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; described the decision handed down by the court as a &quot;victory for both Governor Martin O&#x27;Malley, who backs construction of the road, and a measure of vindication for former Governor Robert L. Ehrlich, who made it the top transportation priority of his administration.&quot;
After the opinion was released, environmental groups opposed to the ICC stated that they would &quot;consider their legal options before deciding whether to continue their battle&quot;
and some homeowners near the selected route expressed disagreement with the ruling of the court. On January 7, 2008, it was announced that Environmental Defense and the Sierra Club would appeal Judge Williams&#x27; decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Virginia. In April 2008, persons and groups opposed to the ICC, including the Shady Grove Woods Homeowners Association, held an &quot;Irish wake&quot; to draw attention to the impact of the ICC. The Derwood event was attended by approximately 100 people, all of whom wore green t-shirts to show their support for the trees. The event&#x27;s planners also named the event &quot;O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s March&quot; after Governor Martin O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s former rock band in the hopes that this would encourage him to cancel the project. An op-ed in &quot;The Diamondback&quot; was printed which raised objections to the ICC.

In June 2004, protests against the ICC were held at Dr. Charles R. Drew Elementary School in Silver Spring, where the State Highway Administration was simultaneously holding a public ICC workshop. This event was more heavily attended than the Derwood event and featured multiple speeches by people opposing the highway, which included Phil Andrews, a Montgomery County Council member. The participants claimed that ICC construction should be halted because of air pollution impacts on pupils at the school; however, it was clear that Governor O&#x27;Malley had no plans to do so. In August 2008, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; published a letter to the editor from the executive director of the Coalition for Smarter Growth calling on the Maryland Department of Transportation to &quot;cancel the ICC.&quot; In September 2008, &quot;The Sun&#x27;s&quot; columnist Dan Rodricks wrote an anti-ICC opinion piece asserting that the ICC was the &quot;Intercounty Anachronism&quot;. Rodricks&#x27; column was first rebutted by a letter to the editor by Montgomery County Councilmember Nancy Floreen (D-At Large) and then in a longer op-ed by SHA Administrator Neil Pedersen. Also in September 2008, &quot;The Gazette&quot; published an op-ed by state delegate Heather R. Mizeur (D-District 20) suggesting that the ICC be canceled. The Mizeur op-ed was rebutted in a response (also published by &quot;The Gazette&quot;) by Neil Pedersen in October 2008.

In November 2008, it was announced that Environmental Defense had dropped its appeal with the Fourth Circuit of the decision handed down by Judge Williams of the U.S. District Court for Maryland about a year earlier. In exchange for dropping the suit, the State Highway Administration agreed to fund new emissions-reduction technology used by public school buses in Montgomery County; and the SHA will also &quot;sponsor a three-year study that involves installing air quality monitors along a major highway selected for its similar characteristics to the ICC and I-95.&quot; Press releases were issued by the State Highway Administration and Environmental Defense discussing the details of the legal settlement.

===Environmental mitigation===

A major component of the ICC is environmental mitigation and aesthetics. In addition to work taking place near and in the right-of-way of the ICC, there are over 50 &quot;off-site environmental and community improvement projects&quot; that will be funded as part of the ICC engineering and construction budget.

In a letter to the editor of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, David Marks, a former official with the Maryland Department of Transportation, wrote that the SHA project team &quot;...had the foresight to require substantial environmental improvements as part of the project, and they insisted on broad public input...&quot;
One component of the mitigation is the replacement of parkland taken for the ICC with new land.
Replacement lands intended to compensate for these losses include a large parcel of land in the Boyds area of Montgomery County owned by the Eugene B. Casey Foundation. However, the trustees of the Casey Foundation did not agree to the purchase of this parcel,
so the State Highway Administration acquired the land by condemnation and the matter was reported as resolved in June 2008. In July 2008, controversy was reported on a similar subject. A parcel of land near the intersection of MD 198 and Peach Orchard Road which had been condemned by the SHA in 1997 for possible use as the so-called Northern Alignment (Corridor 2) was conveyed to the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission to compensate for parkland which will be taken by the ICC. The former owner, Winchester Homes, filed a lawsuit contending that the SHA must offer to sell this land back to Winchester, and in May 2008, Judge S. Michael Pincus of the Montgomery County Circuit Court ruled that &quot;the SHA was contractually obligated to offer Winchester Homes the chance to buy back the property.&quot; It was further reported that the state filed an appeal in June 2008.

In the February 2008 edition of the &quot;Successes in Stewardship&quot; newsletter, the Federal Highway Administration stated:

Since environmental impacts were the major barrier to prior ICC planning efforts, the third EIS team redefined the project-development approach to explicitly include environmental stewardship as part of the project&#x27;s stated purpose and need. In order to fulfill the ICC&#x27;s stated purpose &quot;to help restore the natural, human, and cultural environments in the project area from the adverse effects of past development,&quot; lead-agency staff used context-sensitive design approaches to minimize or altogether avoid adverse impacts to wetlands and streams in the development of project alternatives.

At least one section of the ICC was re-routed from the master-planned route to reduce environmental impact, though the re-routing led to additional residences having to be condemned as a result.

Eastern box turtles (&quot;Terrapene carolina carolina&quot;) that were in the path of the ICC were located with the aid of dogs trained to find them by scent and were moved to other locations in Montgomery County near Boyds and Brookeville.

In a letter to the editor of &quot;The Gazette&quot;, SHA Administrator Neil Pedersen enumerated a list of environmental mitigation and community enhancements that SHA is funding as part of constructing the ICC.

The ICC is likely to force changes to the 14th hole of the Cross Creek Golf Club, which straddles the border between Montgomery County and Prince George&#x27;s County. However, it was reported that the 14th hole was surveyed incorrectly, and part of it was mistakenly located on land set aside for the ICC.

In January 2009, it was reported that Eyes of Paint Branch (a group that has opposed the ICC) had recently demanded of the SHA that the contractors working to build the ICC comply with Montgomery County&#x27;s regulations for the Upper Paint Branch Special Protection Area, which the State of Maryland has no legal obligation to follow.

Construction of the ICC has forced the National Capital Trolley Museum to relocate its car barns, shops, visitors center, and part of its track a short distance to the north. In 2006, the museum&#x27;s development director made a public plea for relocation help and coordination in a &quot;Washington Post&quot; op-ed column. The museum suspended operations for relocation in December 2008 and resumed trolley rides in January 2010. In August 2009, the SHA held a public forum at the new and relocated trolley museum to describe the environmental mitigation aspects of the ongoing ICC construction project.

A major environmental concern along the entire ICC project is the impact of stormwater runoff on creeks and streams, during and after construction. Techniques and technologies to treat such water are known as best management practices (BMPs). State-of-the-art BMPs used along the ICC&#x27;s construction project were described in an article in &quot;Land and Water&quot; magazine. Some of the methods being used to control runoff were described in a &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; &quot;On the Outdoors&quot; column, published after the writer toured several work areas along the ICC&#x27;s right-of-way:

The ICC project employs teams of &quot;stormbusters&quot; to put down straw and grass seed and erect plastic silt fences in construction areas before it rains to prevent erosion. Solar-powered stream monitors give Baker and enforcement personnel a real-time reading of water conditions. Paved storm-water ditches in older neighborhoods abutting the highway will be replaced by grass-lined swales that will filter and cool the water before it enters tributaries.

The &quot;Sun&quot; column went on to describe financial incentives that will be paid to construction contractors that meet environmental goals and requirements.

As part of construction work, several archaeological sites have been found in the path of the ICC, including a Native American site near Georgia Avenue and Norbeck Road that contains artifacts dating to the Stone Age. and near US 29, the 19th century homestead of a freed slave, Melinda Jackson, containing numerous artifacts.

===ICC Trail===
The ICC Trail is a combination multi-use trail and on road route along the general path of the ICC. It includes about 7 miles of trail and 11 miles along parallel roads. A bicycle trail had long been identified in County master plans as part of the proposed ICC, both in Montgomery County and Prince George&#x27;s County.

However, in 2004, the SHA announced that it was dropping the ICC bike trail from its own plans due to cost and environmental footprint. This move was unpopular, with comments sent to the state&#x27;s ICC web page overwhelmingly in favor of a bike trail; the Montgomery County Council voted 8–0 in favor of the trail and the state said it would consider five unconnected segments that would run along 40 percent of the ICC. When the State Highway Administration published its final plan for the ICC in May 2006, it recommended seven miles of the 18-mile trail be built as part of the highway and the remaining 11 miles be constructed separate from the highway project. The state later agreed to build 11.4 miles of a trail in separate segments in Prince George&#x27;s and Montgomery counties.

In response, Montgomery County began the process of amending the ICC limited functional Master Plan to include the new design for the bike path in October of 2007. One proposal was to keep a mostly parallel route by utilizing county park lands for the trail, but the County Council voted against that because it would be too harmful to some county parkland. The amendment was approved in April 2009, and it proposed a bikeway near the Intercounty Connector as well as a plan that would divert bike traffic along New Hampshire Avenue, Route 29, East Randolph and Fairland roads. The council approved the options with the idea that one or both would be exercised.

 Construction of the ICC trail began with construction of the road. The westernmost segment, from Needwood Road to MD 28 (Norbeck Road), primarily following the MD 200 right-of-way except for a section which follows Emory Lane to Georgia Avenue, opened first on July 30, 2011 shortly after the first section of the ICC opened; this section was later extended to MD 182 (Layhill Road). The second segment, which runs from Notley Road to MD 650 (New Hampshire Avenue), behind the southern sound wall of the highway, and the third segment, which runs alongside US 29 and Briggs Chaney Road, both opened in late 2011. A fourth section was completed in 2015, running along the easternmost section of MD 200 from Konterra Drive to US 1 (Baltimore Avenue). In 2009 work began on the ICC Connector, a shared use path along Needwood Road connecting the ICC Trail to the Shady Grove Metro. Future segments of the trail have been left to county governments to plan and build.

==Exit list==
Exit numbers and mile markers are a continuation of those along I-370.









==Auxiliary route==
*MD 200A is the unsigned designation for Metro Access Road, a four-lane freeway that runs from the entrance to the Shady Grove station of Washington Metro&#x27;s Red Line and an interchange with Shady Grove Road north to an interchange with the western terminus of MD 200 and the eastern terminus of I-370. The route is long. MD 200A was designated in 2010, replacing the previous I-370 designation that was realigned to connect with MD 200.

<doc id="1344561" wikidata="Q544925" url="?curid=1344561" title="Jean de Meun">
<text>Jean de Meun (or de Meung, ) () was a French author best known for his continuation of the &quot;Roman de la Rose&quot;.

==Life==
He was born Jean Clopinel or Jean Chopinel at Meung-sur-Loire. Tradition asserts that he studied at the University of Paris. He was, like his contemporary, Rutebeuf, a defender of Guillaume de Saint-Amour and a bitter critic of the mendicant orders. Jean de Meung says that in his youth he composed songs that were sung in every public place and school in France.

Most of his life seems to have been spent in Paris, where he possessed, in the Rue Saint-Jacques, a house with a tower, court and garden, which was described in 1305 as the house of the late Jean de Meun, and was then bestowed by a certain Adam d&#x27;Andely on the Dominicans. He was buried in the now-demolished church of Paris&#x27;s Dominican monastery, which was also on Rue Saint-Jacques.

==&quot;Roman de la Rose&quot;==
In the enumeration of his own works he places first his continuation of the &quot;Roman de la Rose&quot; of Guillaume de Lorris. The date of this second part (lines 4,089–21,780) is generally fixed between 1268 and 1285 by a reference in the poem to the death of Manfred and Conradin, executed in 1268 by order of Charles of Anjou (d. 1285) who is described as the present king of Sicily. M. F. Guillon (Jean Clopinel, 1903). However, considering the poem primarily as a political satire, places it in the last five years of the 13th century.

Jean de Meun doubtless edited the work of his predecessor, Guillaume de Lorris, before using it as the starting-point of his own vast poem, running to 19,000 lines. The continuation of Jean de Meun is a satire on the monastic orders, on celibacy, on the nobility, the papal see, the excessive pretensions of royalty, and especially on women and marriage. Guillaume had been the servant of love, and the exponent of the laws of &quot;courtoisie&quot;; Jean de Meun added an &quot;art of love,&quot; describing with brutality the supposed vices of women and the means by which men may outwit them. Jean de Meun embodied the mocking, sceptical spirit of the fabliaux. He did not share in current superstitions, he had no respect for established institutions, and he scorned the conventions of feudalism and romance. His poem shows in the highest degree, in spite of the looseness of its plan, the faculty of keen observation, of lucid reasoning and exposition, and it entitles him to be considered the greatest of French medieval poets. He handled the French language with an ease and precision unknown to his predecessors, and the length of his poem was no bar to its popularity in the 13th and 14th centuries.

Part of its vogue was no doubt because the author, who had mastered practically all the scientific and literary knowledge of his contemporaries in France, had found room in his poem for a great amount of useful information and for numerous citations from classical authors. The book was attacked by Guillaume de Deguileville in his &quot;Pèlerinage de la vie humaine&quot; (), long a favorite work both in England and France, by Jean Gerson, and by Christine de Pisan in her &quot;Épître au dieu d&#x27;amour&quot;. It also found energetic defenders.

Part of Jean&#x27;s poem was translated into Middle English verse by Chaucer as &quot;The Romaunt of the Rose&quot;. The whole poem was translated into Modern English verse by F. S. Ellis and later by Charles Dahlberg.

==Other works==
Jean de Meun translated in 1284 the treatise &quot;De re militari&quot; of Vegetius into French as &quot;Le livre de Végèce de l&#x27;art de chevalerie&quot;. He also produced a spirited version, the first in French, of the letters of Abélard and Héloïse. A 14th-century manuscript of this translation in the Bibliothèque Nationale has annotations by Petrarch. His translation of the &quot;De consolatione philosophiae&quot; of Boethius is preceded by a letter to Philip IV in which he enumerates his earlier works, two of which are lost: &quot;De spirituelle amitié&quot; from the &quot;De spirituali amicitia&quot; of Aelred of Rievaulx (d. 1166), and the &quot;Livre des merveilles d&#x27;Hirlande&quot; from the &quot;Topographia Hibernica&quot;, or &quot;De Mirabilibus Hiberniae&quot; of Giraldus Cambrensis (Gerald de Barri). His last poems are doubtless his &quot;Testament&quot; and &quot;Codicille&quot;. The &quot;Testament&quot; is written in quatrains in monorhyme, and contains advice to the different classes of the community.

<text>Georg Ludwig Rudolf Maercker (21 September 1865 – 31 December 1924) was a German general who served during World War I.

Following the Armistice of 1918 that saw the end of fighting and of the Bolshevik revolution that led to the creation of the Soviet Union, there were many examples of disturbances throughout Germany. Maercker suggested the formation of &quot;Freikorps&quot; (Free Corps) to suppress these and a number of formations formed themselves, usually around individual army officers.
After leaving the &quot;Freikorps&quot;, Maercker became active in &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot; group and was the president of the Saxony chapter. In 1924, Maercker together with Theodor Duesterberg was a leader of the anti-Semitic fraction within the &quot;Stahhelm&quot; who wanted an &quot;Aryan clause&quot; that would ban Jews from joining the &quot;Stahlhelm&quot; and expel the current Jewish members. In March 1924, Maercker and Duesterberg got their way and forced Franz Seldte to adopt the &quot;Aryan clause&quot; and expel all Jews from the &quot;Stahlhelm&quot;.

<text>The Singapore Justice Party (abbreviation: SJP) is a political party in Singapore.

==Background==
The party has been based mostly in Marine Parade district of Singapore since the party has taken part in general elections after 1988 by fielding its candidates at Marine Parade Group Representation Constituency (GRC). In 1997, it did not take part in the General Election. In the run-up to the 2001 general election, responding to Chiam See Tong&#x27;s call for a united front against the ruling People&#x27;s Action Party, the party joined with the National Solidarity Party, the Singapore People&#x27;s Party and the Singapore Malay National Organisation to form the Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA). Although the party itself failed to win any seats since it was formed, the SDA did manage to win one seat at Potong Pasir, with Chiam See Tong of the Singapore People&#x27;s Party as Member of Parliament and have another (Steve Chia of the National Solidarity Party) in parliament through the Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) scheme.

As of March 2006, the party&#x27;s Secretary General is Aminuddin bin Ami.

Meeker was born in Kitchener, Ontario, the son of Kathleen Wharnsby and Charles Howard Meeker, and raised in New Hamburg, Ontario He played his junior hockey with the Kitchener Greenshirts in the Ontario Hockey Association. In 1941–42, Meeker joined the Stratford Kist. In only 13 games, he scored 29 goals and had 45 points, helping the Kist win the OHA Junior-B title. He played one more year of junior hockey before joining the Canadian Army. Meeker was badly injured during the war, but he made a full recovery. In 1945–46, after World War II had ended, Meeker returned to the OHA and played one season with the Stratford Indians.

===Professional career===
Meeker was a right winger. In 1946–47, he joined the Toronto Maple Leafs in the National Hockey League. He scored 27 goals and 45 points during his NHL debut and he was awarded the Calder Memorial Trophy. Meeker also played in the 1947 NHL All-Star Game and he also tied an NHL record for most goals by a rookie in one game with five goals against the Chicago Black Hawks. Meeker also won his first Stanley Cup with the Leafs that season, the first of three consecutive Stanley Cups. The season, however, would prove Meeker&#x27;s best as a pro, and he would never again approach that level of scoring.

In 1947–48, Meeker scored 34 points in 58 games and played in the 1948 NHL All-Star Game. He also helped the Leafs win their second consecutive Stanley Cup. Next season, Meeker sustained a collarbone injury that limited him to only 30 games and he did not play a single game in the playoffs as the Leafs took their third consecutive Stanley Cup. In 1950–51, Meeker won his fourth Stanley Cup with the Leafs as they beat the Montreal Canadiens in five games. Meeker would play three more seasons with the Leafs before retiring from the NHL. He continued to play hockey sporadically for 15 more years with different senior clubs, finally retiring from playing in 1969.

===Coaching and general management===
He also coached the Maple Leafs, replacing King Clancy on April 11, 1956, leading the Leafs to a 21–34–15 record. He was promoted to general manager in 1957 but was fired before the start of the 1957–58 season.

===Political career===

Meeker spent two years as a Progressive Conservative MP while playing for the Leafs. In June 1951, Meeker won the federal by-election in the Ontario riding of Waterloo South. He did not seek re-election in the 1953 election.
===Hockey camps===
Meeker later ran hockey schools as summer camps in Canada and the United States. His book &quot;Howie Meeker&#x27;s Hockey Basics&quot;, published in 1973, and his weekly telecasts based on these camps, &quot;Howie Meeker&#x27;s Hockey School&quot;, which ran from 1973 to 1977 on CBC Television, cemented his reputation in the coaching trade. The TV show was produced in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland. It featured boys learning the basic skills of the game: skating, puck control, and passing. Meeker&#x27;s encouragement and delivery were all based on his premise that the game was suffering from poor instruction at the junior levels. He felt the game was not being taught properly so his message was directed at coaches across Canada. He also made vocal and detailed complaints about poor quality hockey equipment for child players, especially concerning protective gear. The television series had 107 fifteen-minute episodes. It was produced and directed by Ron Harrison and/or John Spaulding and aired weekly during the hockey season.

===Broadcasting career===
In the 1970s and 1980s, Meeker became known to a new generation of hockey fans as an excitable, dynamic studio analyst-colour commentator on &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;. He would replay footage taken from an overhead camera that provided a full view of the ice, then use a telestrator to demonstrate his points. During the telestrator segments, his favourite directive was, &quot;stop it right here&quot;, to freeze the screen in order to analyze specifics in the replay. He also worked on Vancouver Canucks telecasts on BCTV. When TSN gained NHL cable TV broadcast rights in 1987, Meeker joined their team, where he stayed until retiring in 1998. Meeker often used the phrase, &quot;Keep your stick on the ice&quot; (later popularized as a slogan of comedian Red Green) during his educational segments on &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;.

===Philanthropic work===
Meeker was involved with Special Olympics for over 40 years. He helped launch Special Olympics Canada after being invited to participate by former NHL referee Harry &quot;Red&quot; Foster shortly after the Special Olympics movement was created by Eunice Kennedy Shriver in the United States. In 1988, at the age of 64, Meeker was contacted by Campbell River Special Olympics in Campbell River, British Columbia, to help with setting up a fundraising golf tournament for the local Special Olympics organization. He was initially serving as a go-between to get a regional sports star involved but eventually, Meeker himself lent his name and support to the Howie Meeker Charity Golf Classic at Storey Creek Golf Club. Each year for the next 30 years, Meeker participated in the successful fundraiser in person. In his 94th year and at the 30th running of the event in August 2018, it was announced that Meeker would be taking a step back and welcoming a new co-host to carry on with the event. NHL player Clayton Stoner had signed on to be co-host with Meeker to ensure the fundraiser continues in Meeker&#x27;s name into the future.

In 2004, Meeker was invited to headline a golf tournament fundraiser to benefit BC Guide Dog Services. Originally intended as a one-off event, it was such a success that the Howie Meeker Golf for Guide Dogs tournament ran on Vancouver Island for four years and is now held annually in the Metro Vancouver area. From this beginning, Meeker and his wife, Leah, became the patrons for BC Guide Dog Services, and through their involvement had helped raise over $350,000 as of July 2011.

==Personal life==
Meeker moved to St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, later in life, calling it home for several decades. He was married to his first wife Grace for 55 years, raising six children, until she died in 1998. After retiring, Meeker lived with his second wife Leah in Parksville, British Columbia. He died on November 8, 2020, in hospital in Nanaimo, British Columbia.

==Tribute==
Upon hearing of Meeker&#x27;s death, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman issued the following statement on behalf of the league: &quot;Howie Meeker spent his long and remarkable life playing, teaching, and broadcasting the game of hockey and serving his country with incredible enthusiasm.&quot;

<doc id="1344605" wikidata="Q1141016" url="?curid=1344605" title="Crooner">
<text>A crooner is a singer who performs with a smooth, intimate style that originated in the 1920s. The crooning style was made possible by better microphones that picked up quieter sounds and a wider range of frequencies, allowing the singer to access a greater dynamic range and exploit the proximity effect. This suggestion of intimacy was supposedly wildly attractive to women, especially a youth subculture known at the time as &quot;bobby soxers&quot;. The crooning style developed among singers who performed with big bands, and reached its height in the 1940s to late 1960s.

Crooning is epitomized by jazz vocalists of the era such as Bing Crosby, Rudy Vallee and Frank Sinatra, although Sinatra did not consider himself or Crosby to be &quot;crooners&quot;. Other performers, such as Russ Columbo, also rejected the term.

==History==

This dominant popular vocal style coincided with the advent of radio broadcasting and electrical recording. Before the advent of the microphone, singers had to project to the rear seats of a theater, which made for a very loud vocal style. The microphone made a more personal style possible. Al Bowlly, Bing Crosby, Gene Austin, Art Gillham, and by some accounts Vaughn De Leath are often credited as inventors of the crooning style, but Rudy Vallée brought the style widespread popularity. 

His first film, &quot;The Vagabond Lover&quot;, was promoted with the line, &quot;Men Hate Him! Women Love Him!&quot; while his success brought press warnings of the &quot;Vallee Peril&quot;: this &quot;punk from Maine&quot; with the &quot;dripping voice&quot; required mounted police to &quot;beat back crowds of screaming and swooning females&quot; at his vaudeville shows.By the early 1930s, the term &quot;crooner&quot; had taken on a pejorative connotation. Cardinal William O&#x27;Connell of Boston and the New York Singing Teachers Association (NYSTA) both publicly denounced the vocal form, O&#x27;Connell calling it &quot;base&quot;, &quot;degenerate&quot;, &quot;defiling&quot; and un-American, with the NYSTA adding &quot;corrupt&quot;. Even &quot;The New York Times&quot; predicted that crooning would be just a passing fad. The newspaper wrote, &quot;They sing like that because they can&#x27;t help it. Their style is begging to go out of fashion…. Crooners will soon go the way of tandem bicycles, mah jongg and midget golf.&quot; Voice range shifted from tenor (Vallée) to baritone (Russ Columbo, Bing Crosby). Still, a 1931 record by Dick Robertson, &quot;Crosby, Columbo, and Vallee&quot;, called upon men to fight &quot;these public enemies&quot; brought into homes via radio.

==Female crooners==
The term crooner has been applied to some female singers around the world, especially those who have low alto voices. Among the first was white American singer Lee Morse who performed in three Vitaphone short films in 1930. A cartoon published in the &quot;Cleveland Plain Dealer&quot; in 1930 listed four male and seven female singers as the &quot;All-American Crooning Eleven&quot;. Blues singer Ruth Etting was in the group, along with Helen Morgan, Libby Holman, Bernadene Hayes, Annette Hanshaw, and others. Several more American women singers were called crooners in 1950 with chart hits by Teresa Brewer and Patti Page. Anita O&#x27;Day&#x27;s version of &quot;Tennessee Waltz&quot; was a crooner-style hit in 1951. The success of women crooners continued through 1956 but was diminished in 1957 after &quot;Billboard&quot; combined the segregated black and white pop charts, which led to a rise in male hit songs. Black American blues singer Nina Simone has been described as a crooner for her work in the 1960s and 1970s.

==Country crooners==
Due to the country songs popularized by Bing Crosby, the crooning style of singing became an enduring part of country music. Crosby achieved a million seller with his 1940 rendition of the song &quot;San Antonio Rose&quot;, originally recorded by Bob Wills &amp; His Texas Playboys. In 1942, Perry Como had a smash hit with &quot;Deep in the Heart of Texas&quot;; Crosby, who had an enormous influence on Como, covered this song and took it to the number 3 position in the US chart that same year. Eddy Arnold, Jim Reeves and Ray Price are especially well known for their country crooner standards.

Dean Martin is associated with the country music he recorded in the period when he was working for Reprise Records, whilst his fellow Italian-American crooner Como recorded several albums with country producer Chet Atkins in Nashville. Regular, non-country crooners also scored hits with pop versions of country songs: Tony Bennett had a &quot;Billboard&quot; number 1 hit in 1951 with his rendition of Hank Williams&#x27; &quot;Cold, Cold Heart&quot;; Como had a number 1 hit in 1953 with his version of &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Stars Get in Your Eyes&quot;, a chart-topping country hit for its author Slim Willet and a number 4 country hit for Ray Price; Guy Mitchell scored a number 1 in 1959 with &quot;Heartaches by the Number&quot;, a country hit for Ray Price; and Britain&#x27;s Engelbert Humperdinck achieved a 1967 UK number 1 hit with &quot;Release Me&quot;, another song already made famous by Price in 1954. In 1970, Price had a number 1 US country hit and a number 11 Hot 100 hit with the song &quot;For the Good Times&quot;, written by Kris Kristofferson; subsequently, Como&#x27;s rendition reached number 7 in 1973 on the UK Singles Chart.

== Modern-day crooners of the Great American Songbook ==

* Harry Connick Jr. played a pivotal role in bringing the crooner style back into mainstream media during the late 1980s and 1990s, particularly with his work on the soundtrack for &quot;When Harry Met Sally&quot; (1989). His interpretations of jazz standards like &quot;It Had to Be You&quot; helped reintroduce crooning to a new generation of listeners. The album&#x27;s success, earning double-platinum status and critical acclaim, was a key factor in reviving interest in the crooner style during that period.
* Michael Bublé emerged in the early 2000s as a key figure in continuing this revival for a new generation. Bublé brought a modern sensibility to his interpretations, blending traditional swing and jazz with pop influences, which resonated with both older and younger audiences.
* Seth MacFarlane has also made significant contributions to the contemporary crooner movement. Beginning in the early 2010s, MacFarlane released several albums that showcase his strong affinity for traditional pop standards and big band jazz. Albums like &quot;Music Is Better Than Words&quot; (2011) received critical acclaim further solidifying crooning in the modern era.
* Michael Feinstein stands as a prominent figure in the modern revival of the crooner tradition, known for his deep commitment to preserving and interpreting the Great American Songbook.
* Tommy Ward has emerged as a rising figure in the modern crooner scene, distinguished by his headlining career on the Las Vegas strip and a close mentorship with Quincy Jones, who has likened Ward to Frank Sinatra.
*Dennis van Aarssen, a Dutch singer who gained international attention after winning &quot;The Voice of Holland&quot; in 2019, has carved out a niche in the modern crooner scene with his smooth interpretations of jazz standards and pop classics.

<doc id="1344615" wikidata="Q7274645" url="?curid=1344615" title="R36 (New York City Subway car)">
<text>The R36 was a New York City Subway car model built by the St. Louis Car Company from 1963 to 1964. The cars are a &quot;follow-up&quot; or supplemental stock to the A Division&#x27;s R33s, which some of the cars closely resemble. A total of 424 cars were built, arranged in pairs. The order includes World&#x27;s Fair cars comprising 390 cars, and Main Line cars comprising 34 cars.

The R36s entered service on October 24, 1963, and were overhauled in the mid-1980s. They were retired by 2003 with the delivery of the R142 and R142A cars. While most cars were reefed, some have been preserved, and others have been retained for other purposes.

==Description==
The R36s were numbered 9346–9769. They were the last entirely LAHT bodied (non-stainless steel) cars built for the New York City Subway.

Cars 9346–9523 and 9558–9769 were specifically purchased for service on the IRT Flushing Line ( and trains), which was the closest line to the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. The cars were also referred to as &quot;&quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot; cars&quot;, or &quot;R36WFs&quot; (R36 World&#x27;s Fair), and featured three-piece curved &quot;picture&quot; windows, unlike other IRT cars at the time. While in regular service, five two-car consists of these cars were coupled to one single R33S car to make 11-car trains for the and routes.

Cars 9524–9557 were purchased for service on all other IRT routes. The cars were also referred to as &quot;&quot;Main Line&quot; cars&quot;, or &quot;R36MLs&quot; (R36 Main Line) to distinguish them from the &quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot; cars. They were built from unfinished car body shells of the R33 order, and therefore featured sported drop-sash side windows.

Although the R36s were later referred to as Redbirds, the cars were originally painted in different schemes when they were delivered. The &quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot; cars were painted in a light blue turquoise &quot;Bluebird&quot; scheme, while the &quot;Main Line&quot; cars were painted bright red like the R33s. These color schemes were used until 1977, when the cars were painted in the silver/blue MTA livery. Then, they were painted in a full white (roof, bonnets, and sides were all painted white) &quot;anti-graffiti&quot; scheme from 1981 to 1982 to combat graffiti; since the white paint was a Teflon-based paint, the graffiti did not stick to it very well. The look was abandoned for the famous &quot;Redbird&quot; style, which was applied onto the cars when they were rebuilt.

==History==
===Early history===
In 1962, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) ordered 430 cars for the train. This route would run to the World&#x27;s Fair grounds in Flushing Meadows in Queens. The first 40 cars were singles (R33S), with the rest being R36 cars; single cars were needed since the service runs 11-car trains, and R36 cars were built only in pairs.

The first R36 cars (&quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot; cars 9558–9561) arrived in fall 1963, shortly after the R33S cars began arriving in September that year. The first train of R33S and &quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot; R36 cars was placed in service on the route on October 24, 1963. With the fair opening approaching on April 12, 1964, &quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot; R36 cars were built and delivered in larger quantities that fall. More &quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot; cars arrived throughout 1964, enough to displace the R12s, R14s, and R15s from the train by the close of 1964.

The &quot;Main Line&quot; R36s entered service on the almost a year later, on July 24, 1964. The cars were first assigned to the , , and until February 16, 1966, when they were moved to the .

===Late 1960s–Mid 1980s===
The &quot;Main Line&quot; R36s stayed on the until October 1968, when cars 9530–9539 were moved to the and . When the GE R12s were sent to the (Third Avenue elevated line) in August 1969, the remaining cars assigned to the were moved to the and to join the rest of the &quot;Main Line&quot; cars assigned there.

In April 1972, &quot;Main Line&quot; R36 pairs 9524–9525, 9532–9533, 9536–9537, 9540–9541, 9544–9545, and 9548–9549 were moved to the , with Westinghouse &quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot; pairs 9376–9377, 9408–9409, 9418–9419, 9474–9475, 9496–9497, and 9516–9517 being moved to the and . The swap was reversed in May 1973, when the &quot;Main Line&quot; pairs returned to the and , and the Westinghouse &quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot; pairs returned to the .

On October 22, 1976, Westinghouse &quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot; R36s 9504–9523 were moved from the to the and to supplement the &quot;Main Line&quot; cars.

From June 2, 1978, to May 1979, Westinghouse &quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot; R36s 9494–9503 were assigned to the train. Those cars were also used on the and in February 1979.

On April 27, 1981, &quot;Main Line&quot; R36s 9548–9557 were moved from the and to the to relieve a car shortage on the line. The cars returned to their home lines on August 17, 1981.

On January 10, 1983, Westinghouse &quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot; R36s 9504–9523 and the &quot;Main Line&quot; R36s were removed from the , and those were only assigned to the . Those cars stayed on the until June 20, 1984, when Westinghouse &quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot; and &quot;Main Line&quot; cars 9514–9533 were moved to the . The remaining Westinghouse &quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot; R36s assigned to the were then moved to the on July 5, 1984. Then, the last &quot;Main Line&quot; cars assigned to the were also moved to the on February 15, 1985, and the R36s were assigned exclusively to the , except from April 1985 to early May 1985, when &quot;Main Line&quot; cars 9534–9557, and &quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot; GE cars 9558–9593 were all assigned to the .

Though all cars were originally delivered without air conditioning, all cars in this series gradually received air conditioning as part of a retrofitting program to replace the cars&#x27; original Axiflow ceiling fans. The program started in 1976, and by 1982, all cars had received air conditioning as part of the program.

The &quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot; R36s were the first cars to be rebuilt in the NYCTA&#x27;s General Overhaul Program (GOH) in the 1980s. This program improved car life by rebuilding older cars and keeping other cars in a state of good repair. A trial rebuild program was done on selected Westinghouse R36 cars in 1981–83; the selected cars were rebuilt by Morrison–Knudsen in Hornell, New York. Beginning in late 1984, the other R36 cars were rebuilt at a rate of 200 cars per year, with the majority of them done in-house at the Coney Island Shop. Others were rebuilt by General Electric in Buffalo, New York, and by Amtrak at its Beech Grove, Indiana, and Wilmington, Delaware shops. The last remaining cars were sent out for rebuild in late 1985, and by 1986, all cars were back in service.

After rebuilding, the R36 cars were repainted in a scheme involving a deep maroon red body, black front bonnets and anti-climbers, and a silver roof prior to returning to service. At first, the scheme was known as &quot;Silver Fox&quot;, &quot;Broad Street Red&quot;, or &quot;Gunn Red&quot; (after NYCT chief David L. Gunn) and was a graffiti-resistant red. By 1989, the Gunn Red would evolve into the &quot;Redbirds&quot; scheme best known to many New Yorkers, with beige interiors, red exterior paint and interior doors and black, and silver exterior trim along with the car windows, roof, and undersides.

Starting in late 1992, R36 cars 9558–9769 underwent another overhaul to improve their reliability that involved some cosmetic improvements, extensive rewiring, and the installment of donor cam control group and braking systems that were salvaged from the retiring R30 cars. As the R36s were among the first group of subway cars to undergo a trial refurbishment before the General Overhaul (GOH) program began in 1985, there were some oversights and shortcomings that occurred before the GOH program took place which were essentially corrected by this second overhaul.

In 1999, the R36 cars were the most reliable in the NYCT fleet, with a Mean Distance Between Failure (MDBF) rate of 194,150 miles, despite being 35 years old at the time. While in decent shape mechanically, rust holes and car body corrosion were beginning to form in the sides of most of the cars.

From December 1987 until July 2001, &quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot; cars 9478–9523 usually ran on the train based at Westchester Yard in the Bronx. Previously, some Westinghouse-equipped cars had been assigned to the and trains in the late 1960s–early 1980s. The &quot;Main Line&quot; cars usually ran on the from February 1984 to December 1987, and was transferred to the from December 1987 to June 2001, when they were returned to the .

===Retirement===
In 1996, the New York City Transit Authority announced their plans to phase out the Redbirds with the R142 and R142A fleets.

From February 2001 to July 2001, as R142As entered service on the , the &quot;Main Line&quot; R36s were transferred over to the . While the Redbirds on the IRT Main Line were retired starting in early 2001, the service was still provided by R33S cars and R36s. In January 2002, a set of R62As arrived from the IRT mainline. As more R142s and R142As were delivered, R62As were gradually transferred from the and to the , in turn replacing the R33S cars and R36s. The last &quot;Main Line&quot; R36 pair, 9542–9543, made its final trip on the on May 16, 2003. The last train of &quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot; R36s, consisting of pairs 9564–9565, 9616–9617, 9582–9583, 9584–9585, and 9586–9587, finally ran along the on November 3, 2003, with R33S car 9309, marking not only the end of the Redbird cars, but also the end of non-stainless steel cars on the subway.

Most of the Redbirds (1,294) were stripped and then submerged off the coast of Delaware, New Jersey, South Carolina, Georgia, and Virginia as an artificial barrier and diving reefs, by Weeks Marine.

Several R36 cars were saved for various purposes throughout the New York City Subway system. The full list includes:
* &quot;Main Line&quot; pair 9542–9543 – preserved by the New York Transit Museum in Brooklyn since 2004. This pair was restored to operational status and made its first run on the &quot;Train of Many Colors&quot; in November 2023.
* &quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot; pair 9586–9587 – also preserved by the New York Transit Museum in Brooklyn. These cars were stored for many years until being moved to the Concourse Yard in summer 2013. In September 2013, the pair was moved to 207th Street Yard and restored to operating status. The cars were initially displayed at the transit museum and finally participated on their first fan trip on June 8, 2014, on the route, as part of the &quot;Train of Many Colors&quot;.

&quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot; pairs 9582–9583 and 9584–9585 also remain on MTA property. They were transferred to the Unionport Yard along with pair 9586–9587. Pair 9582–9583 was found to have structural issues and was sidelined, while pair 9584–9585 was used on the rail adhesion train until 2019. Plans are unknown for these cars.

In addition to these cars, other cars were also stored around the system. &quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot; pair 9400–9401 was stored at the Corona Yard for preservation; however, the cars were never used and were scrapped on October 7, 2013. &quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot; pair 9564–9565 was set aside and transferred to Coney Island Yard in December 2004; car 9564 was planned to be repurposed into a visitor center at Queens Borough Hall in Kew Gardens, Queens, and the car 9565 was planned to be preserved in a museum in West Babylon, New York. However, R33 9075 was used at Queens Borough Hall instead of 9564, and 9565 never made it to the proposed museum; the cars were subsequently reefed in 2008. &quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot; pair 9588–9589 was stored at the Concourse Yard until 2008, when the pair was reefed.

== In culture ==
Eight WH-powered &quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot; cars (9356–57, 9360–61, 9394–95, 9412–13) and two GE-powered cars (9712–13), in addition to one R33S (9327), were wrapped and painted in New York Mets colors on October 24, 2000, prior to Game 3 of the 2000 World Series between the Yankees and Mets.

In addition, the &quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot; cars have made cameo roles in various TV shows and movies. Nicolas Cage rides a train of &quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot; R36s in &quot;It Could Happen to You&quot; (1994). In the 1988 movie &quot;Cocktail&quot;, Tom Cruise gets off car 9700 at Vernon Boulevard–Jackson Avenue station.

<text>Charles Humphreys (September 19, 1714 – March 11, 1786) was a signatory to the Continental Association while representing the Province of Pennsylvania in the First Continental Congress. A miller and fuller, he benefitted from the system of chattel slavery that existed in the province during that time by using enslaved laborers to operate his businesses.

==Biography==
Humphreys was born in Haverford, Pennsylvania. The son of Daniel and Hannah (née Wynne; daughter of Dr. Thomas Wynne) Humphreys, he and his two sisters, Elizabeth and Rebecca, became the enslavers during their adult years of multiple Black men, women and children, including: Tom, Caesar, Judy, Nany, Nancy, Dolly, Alice, Fanny, and Tommey in 1780. Tom and Caesar were adult men. Judy, Nany, Nancy, and Dolly were adult women; and Alice, Fanny, and Tommey were children.

Charles Humphreys served as a delegate for Pennsylvania to the Continental Congress from 1774 to 1776. He was a signatory to the Continental Association; however, he voted against the Declaration of Independence because he felt the action would place him into conflict with his Quaker beliefs because he believed the Declaration&#x27;s passage could escalate into war. He withdrew from the Congress soon afterwards. Despite not taking part in the Revolutionary War, he sympathized with the Patriot cause and was critical of incidents of oppression by the British government and its representatives.

Humphreys became the owner of a grist and fulling mill in 1782.

==Death==
Humphreys died in Haverford in 1786.

<text>Yenakiieve (, ; ) is a city and the nominal administrative center of Yenakiieve urban hromada in the Horlivka Raion, Donetsk Oblast of Ukraine. The city stands on the Krynka River about from the oblast&#x27;s administrative center, Donetsk. Its population is approximately 

Yenakiieve is an important regional centre of coal mining, metallurgy, chemical production and manufacturing. The city&#x27;s outdated industry has caused accidents like that of a gas explosion which occurred in June 2008 at one of Yenakiieve&#x27;s coal mines. Yenakiieve was founded in 1898 when numerous workers&#x27; settlements around the Peter&#x27;s Iron and Steel Works were united into a single settlement named after . Its first coal mines dated from 1883. The settlement was incorporated as a city in 1925. By 1958, the city and factories had expanded significantly and overtook the outlying villages of Simyukuo, Yevrah, and Tsiminyenny, all of which were resettled in their entirety when local livestock could not survive the expanding steel mills&#x27; runoff and pollution. One of the oldest metallurgical factories of Ukraine — the Yenakiieve Iron and Steel Works operates in Yenakiieve.

The city is known as the birthplace of the former President of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych (in office 2010–2014) and his son, who was the People&#x27;s Deputy of Ukraine from 2006 to 2014.

==History==
Permanent settlements on the territory of present-day Yenakiieve were founded in 1783. In 1858, the Sofiyevsky coal mine opened there. At the same time the Petrovsky cast-iron plant was built, today known as the Yenakiieve Iron and Steel Works. In 1895, engineers F. Yenakiev and B. Yalovetsky and several Belgian businessmen founded a Russian-Belgian metallurgic company which by 1897 constructed the new Petrovsky cast-iron plant around Fyodorovka. Coal mines were opened around the plant. Settlements were formed near them and in 1898 they were united into one called Enakievsky after the founder of the Russian-Belgian metallurgic society. The writer A. I. Kuprin, who worked at the plant in 1896, described workers’ lives in the story “Molokh”. Before World War I several plants were built in Yenakiieve: coke chemical, brick, beer brewing and butter making. The Petrovsky plant became one of the largest metallurgic plants (3rd place) in southern Russia. In 1913 it produced 349,200 tons of cast-iron and 316,400 tons of steel. As a result of ruin after World War I and the Civil War of 1919–1921, Petrovsky plant was the only one producing steel. By 1925 the population in Yenakiieve was 34,000, and it was referred to as a town.

In 1928, the town was renamed into Rykovo, after Soviet party- and statesman Alexei Rykov. After Rykov was arrested in 1937 the town was renamed Ordzhonikidze after another Soviet leader, Sergo Ordzhonikidze. The name Yenakiieve was returned to the town in 1943. By 1939 the population of the town was 88,200.

During World War II Yenakiieve was under siege from Italian army auxiliary units that were seconded to the German Army. They were followed by German units. The city was attacked from 31 October 1941 and not freed until 3 September 1943. Street fighting was fierce between the end of November and beginning of December 1941. “Recruitment” of civilians as Ostarbeiter began in December 1941. In 1950, about twelve Italian POWs (prisoners of war) were put on trial, over atrocities in Yenakiieve including the destruction of a hospital. Apparently no convictions were registered, and by 1954 all Italian POWs were returned to Italy.

In the 1950s, several plants were put into operation: of ferro-concrete items, of construction material, of house building and automobile-repair. On 16 September 1979, on the territory near Yenakiieve in the mine «Yuny Communar» there was one of the Nuclear Explosions for the National Economy—an object «Klivazh». In 2002 the mine was closed as non-perspective and environmentalists worried about the danger of filling the mine with water. It might cause radioactive pollution of the underground water, so pumps continue to pump water out of the abandoned mine.

During the war in Donbas the city was captured by pro-Russian separatists when on 13 April 2014 pro-Russian activists captured its town hall and declared that the city was part of the separatist Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic.

On 7 August 2014, separatists shot down a Ukrainian MiG-29 in the sky over Yenakiieve, presumably from the Buk complex provided by the Russian side; the pilot tried to divert the plane away from residential areas. On 13 August, the metallurgical plant was stopped, according to a statement from the management, &quot;in order to prevent a man-made disaster and save the lives of the townspeople.&quot; The work of the treasury and banking system was completely stopped in the city, and the activities of a number of enterprises were suspended. There is a shortage of products. On 18 November, the first hunger strike took place in the city. On 14 November, Yenakiieve was included in the list of settlements in the East of Ukraine, where the Ukrainian authorities are temporarily not operating.

<text>The Xochimilco Light Rail (locally known as the Tren Ligero and known by the government as Tren ligero de la Ciudad de México) is a light rail line that serves the southern part of Mexico City. It connects to, but is not considered a part of the Mexico City Metro. Rather, it is operated by the &quot;Servicio de Transportes Eléctricos&quot; (STE), the authority that operates Mexico City&#x27;s electric trolleybus system and formerly operated the municipal electric tram system.

==History==
Many of Mexico City&#x27;s original tram lines were abandoned in the 1960s and 1970s. The original Xochimilco tramline had been in operation since 1910, but the Xochimilco tramway&#x27;s section between Avenida Tasqueña and the city centre was replaced by a new metro line in 1970. With the subsequent Mexico City tramway closures that took effect in May 1979, the only tramlines left in operation were routes 53 and 54, running from Tasqueña metro station to Tlalpan and Xochimilco, respectively. These shared a common routing between Tasqueña and Huipulco, with the Tlalpan service branching off of the main line for only about to its terminus at Avenida San Fernando, in the historic centre of Tlalpan borough. On the common section, the tracks were located in the wide median of the Calzada de Tlalpan. The tracks between Huipulco and Xochimilco were also in a separate right-of-way. The separation from street traffic, except at crossings, made routes 53 and 54 more like what later came to be called light rail unlike Mexico City&#x27;s other tramlines which were closed by 1979, but these lines still lacked other light-rail attributes such a full stations. Thus the decision was made in the early 1980s to convert these lines to modern light rail transit.

Both lines ceased operation in September 1984, for rebuilding as light rail. Changes to allow faster operation included replacing the simple tram stops with semi-enclosed &quot;estaciones&quot; (stations), which were spaced farther apart, fitted with high-level boarding platforms and set up as paid areas, so that all payment of fares would take place before boarding. In between the stations the work included installing new tracks set in concrete; putting fencing along the line&#x27;s right-of-way and closing some street crossings; and installing overhead catenary designed for higher speeds. The fleet of 1940s PCC streetcars was also replaced by a fleet of new articulated light rail cars built partially using components from the old cars, including their PCC bogies (trucks) and propulsion systems (see Rolling stock, below, for more details).

The section between Tasqueña and Estadio Azteca (Aztec Stadium), just short of Huipulco junction (for the branch to Tlalpan), opened as light rail on 1 August 1986, but ran for only three days before poor reliability with the heavily rebuilt rail cars led to a decision to suspend service. Service resumed in November 1986. Right-of-way work then shifted to the line&#x27;s outer section, between Estadio Azteca and Xochimilco, with similar upgrading for higher-speed operation. This section opened on 29 November 1988. The old tram line 54 had included a long loop through the historic centre of Xochimilco, along narrow city streets, but this was not included in the upgrading to light rail, and was permanently abandoned when closed in 1984.
The branch from Huipulco junction to Tlalpan was also rebuilt, but in a different manner, changed from private right-of-way to street running (without separation from other traffic) in the middle lanes of Calle Ferrocarril (now known as Renato Leduc) and also shortened by about at its outer end, no longer reaching Avenida San Fernando. Three high-platform stops were built, one being at the new terminus, which was referred to simply as &quot;Tlalpan&quot; on the rail cars&#x27; destination signs. Service to Tlalpan was reintroduced on 13 March 1990, now running only as a one-car shuttle to and from Estadio Azteca, no longer through to Tasqueña. Patronage was low, and service was discontinued only one year later, in March 1991, after an accident damaged the one car (No. 000) normally assigned to the Tlalpan route. Service was reinstated on 13 December 1991, as STE began to place new cars into service on the Xochimilco line, but ceased again on 6 October 1992 and has never resumed.

The overhead line voltage was 600 volts DC until around the end of 1995, when it was raised to 750 V.

==Route==

The line runs between Metro Tasqueña and the town of Xochimilco, south of Mexico City. It serves the Coyoacán, Tlalpan, and Xochimilco boroughs, giving residents a fast link to the urban south of Mexico City. For the northern stretch of its run, it travels along the central reservation of the Calzada de Tlalpan, as does Metro Line 2 south of Metro San Antonio Abad – for this reason, it is sometimes seen as a continuation of that line, albeit on a more modest scale. The light rail line has 18 stations: two terminals and 16 intermediate stations. Three of these stations were built later than the others; Huipulco, Periférico and Huichapan stations opened in November 1993. The travel time from one end of the line to the other is approximately 37 minutes.

Until 1995, the outer terminus was located just beyond Calle Francisco Goitia, at what is now named Francisco Goitia station; it was named &quot;Xochimilco&quot; station originally. In that year, the line was extended east by about to a new terminus at the western edge of &quot;Delegación&quot; Xochimilco&#x27;s centre, along a section of former tram line 54, closed in 1984. This new section was opened on 14 September 1995, and the new terminus was named Embarcadero. However, as the new terminus was now located closer to the centre of Xochimilco than was the actual station bearing that name, STE eventually renamed Embarcadero station as &quot;Xochimilco&quot;, and the original &quot;Xochimilco&quot; station—now the line&#x27;s penultimate station—became Francisco Goitia station. However, the partly single-track segment from Francisco Goitia to Xochimilco limited capacity on the line, and so the Xochimilco station was rebuilt to the west and equipped with two tracks and three loading platforms. The old Xochimilco station closed in November 2007 for the start of construction, and the new station opened on 14 December 2008.

==Rolling stock==

The Xochimilco line&#x27;s rolling stock currently consists of 24 articulated light rail vehicles (LRVs) built by Concarril or Bombardier/Siemens, between 1990 and 2014. Each car is about long and capable of carrying up to 300 passengers. The first 16 of these replaced older cars over the period 1991–95.

The line&#x27;s original fleet consisted of semi-new articulated LRVs built by Moyada (&quot;Motores y Adaptaciones Automotrices, S.A.&quot;), incorporating the bogies (trucks) and some other parts from STE&#x27;s large fleet of withdrawn 1940s-vintage PCC streetcars. STE originally intended to rebuild about 20 PCCs for the lines, a project well underway at STE&#x27;s Tetepilco Depot when the workshop building collapsed during the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, crushing the cars. The prototype LRV was numbered 000, and the remainder 001-016. The Moyada cars had all-new bodies and were equipped with pantographs instead of trolley poles to collect current from the overhead wires. Unlike the old streetcars/trams, they were also bi-directional, having operating cabs at both ends and doors on both sides. Perhaps because of their vintage running gear or electrical components, these cars were found to be unreliable, even after the refurbishment of six in 1989–91.

In 1989, STE placed an order with Concarril for 12 all-new LRVs with similar capacity, to the same design as LRVs Concarril had recently supplied to Guadalajara&#x27;s light rail system. Numbered 017–028, the order&#x27;s first cars arrived in January 1991 entered service on 6 December 1991, replacing all of the Moyada cars except on the Tlalpan shuttle service. When Tlalpan service was withdrawn again in October 1992, the Moyada cars were no longer used. However, in 1992–93 three Moyada cars (005, 010 and 016) were again fitted with all-new bodies, now to a design intended to resemble the Concarril cars, this work being undertaken by local firm Sintra S.A. The three &quot;Sintra&quot; cars, as they were known, the fleet&#x27;s last to use PCC-type control systems, entered service on 1 June 1993. They were withdrawn in late 1995, and shortly afterward the voltage of the line was raised from 600 V DC to 750 V. The newer cars had already been able to operate at the higher voltage.

Four additional LRVs of the same type as the Concarril units were purchased later, in 1995, numbered 029–032. These were built by Bombardier-Concarril S.A. de CV, a subsidiary of Bombardier, which had acquired Concarril in 1992, but were built in the same factory (in Ciudad Sahagún) and were nearly identical to STE&#x27;s 12 Concarril cars. (Several years later, in 2004, Bombardier-Concarril was renamed Bombardier Transportation México.) These four cars were originally ordered by the Guadalajara light rail system, but were resold to STE after Guadalajara decided they were excess to their fleet needs at that time. In the mid-2000s, four more cars were purchased from Bombardier, numbered 033–036, and they entered service on the Xochimilco light rail line in September and October 2008, increasing the fleet size to 20 cars, numbered 017–036.

On 30 August 2011, on its way to Huichapan station, car 031 was hit, while coming to a stop, at full speed by car 027. Twenty-nine people were injured. The two LRVs sustained heavy damage. One half of each two-section LRV was scrapped, and in 2013 STE hired Bombardier to supply two all-new half-car sections and to combine them with the undamaged halves of the two LRVs. Cars 027 and 031 both returned to service in autumn 2014. 

Meanwhile, another four new LRVs were purchased from Bombardier in 2013–14, which would be assigned STE fleet numbers 037–040. They were delivered in summer 2014 and entered service on 16 March 2015, increasing the size of the fleet to 24 cars (numbered 017–040).

In 2022, STE placed an order with CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Company, of China, for six new LRVs, which was later expanded to nine cars. The first car (no. 041) was delivered in November 2023 and entered service in early January 2024. Additional cars in the series, which is numbered 041–049, began to arrive in February 2024.

<text>Daniel Lavoie (; born Daniel Joseph-Hubert-Gérald Lavoie, March 17, 1949) is a Canadian musician, actor, and singer best known for his song &quot;Ils s&#x27;aiment&quot; and the role of Frollo in musical &quot;Notre-Dame de Paris&quot;. He releases albums and performs on stage in Canada and France and tours in Canada and Europe.

==Career==

===Music===

In 1967, Daniel Lavoie won the CBC&#x27;s competition for singer-songwriters, in the television program, &quot;Jeunesse Oblige&quot;. Soon after that he began touring Quebec&#x27;s music clubs with groups (&quot;Spectre&quot;, then &quot;Dieu de l&#x27;amour vous aime&quot;). At that time he changed his name from Gérald to Daniel. In 1973 Daniel Lavoie recorded his first single, &quot;Marie connue&quot;, and in 1974, his second, &quot;S&#x27;endormir pour une rose&quot;. His first album &quot;A court terme&quot; (1975) had moderate success. One of the songs from this albums, &quot;J&#x27;ai quitté mon île&quot; became especially popular in France and also in Portugal and Brazil. In 2009 &quot;J&#x27;ai quitté mon île&quot; was selected by CBC Radio listeners among the top 49 Canadian songs in all genres that best defined the country&#x27;s image for Barack Obama, to be presented to him on an iPod for his inauguration. The second album, &quot;Berceuse pour un Lion&quot; (1977) was well received in Quebec and contained several hits (&quot;Dans le temps des animaux&quot;, &quot;La Vérité sur la vérité&quot;, &quot;Berceuse pour un lion&quot;), but it was the third album, &quot;Nirvana bleu&quot; (1979) that brought Daniel Lavoie true recognition in Quebec. He toured all over Quebec and also performed in France (Théâtre Montparnasse in Paris in 1980). His popularity as a live performer was growing. In 1980 he received his first Félix Award for the best male singer of the year. Many more were to follow. 
In 1981, Daniel Lavoie released his first English-language album &quot;Cravings&quot; as well as his fourth French-language album &quot;Aigre doux&quot;.

The year 1984 was a turning point in Daniel Lavoie&#x27;s career with the release of his album &quot;Tension Attention&quot; (European title &quot;Ils s&#x27;aiment&quot;). One of the songs from this album, &quot;Ils s&#x27;aiment&quot; became especially popular and its single sold 2 million copies. It has been translated into several languages and covered by dozens of performers, among them Ana Belén (&quot;Ellos se aman&quot;, in Spanish), Richard Cocciante (in Italian and Spanish), Diane Dufresne (in French), Paulo Gonzo (&quot;Ridiculous Love&quot;, in English), Ramses Shaffy (&quot;Regenboog&quot;, in Dutch). &quot;Ils s&#x27;aiment&quot; and &quot;Tension Attention&quot; brought Daniel Lavoie multiple awards both in Quebec and in France. The same year Daniel created his solo concert show &quot;Hôtel des rêves&quot; which he presented both in Quebec and in Europe.

Lavoie&#x27;s next album, &quot;Vue sur la mer&quot; (1987) was another success. The release was followed by 5 nights engagement at the Olympia theatre in Paris, and later a 21-date tour throughout Europe. More awards followed, and in the spring of 1988 for three months Lavoie performed his show &quot;Hôtel des rêves&quot; at the Théâtre Outremont in Montreal. The 1990 album &quot;Long Courrier&quot; (European title &quot;Chanson de la Terre&quot;) included &quot;Qui sait&quot;, &quot;Le pape du rap&quot;, and &quot;Jours de plaine&quot;. A study conducted in the early 1990s placed Lavoie among most highly respected by their peers French-Canadian singer-songwriters.

In 1992 Lavoie participated in Catherine Lara&#x27;s symphonic rock-musical &quot;Sand et les Romantiques&quot;, performing the part of Eugène Delacroix. The same year he released another English-language album, &quot;Here in the heart&quot;. He also appeared in an episode of the American soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot; as himself performing his own song &quot;Weak for Love&quot;. Lavoie&#x27;s next and final English-language album &quot;Woman to Man&quot; appeared in 1994.

In 1995 Lavoie released a new album &quot;Ici&quot; (European title &quot;Où la route mène&quot;) which introduced new hits such as &quot;Où la route mène&quot;, &quot;Je pensais pas&quot;, and &quot;Je suis une rivière&quot;. Two albums for children followed: &quot;Le Bébé Dragon&quot; (1996) and &quot;Le Bébé Dragon vol. 2&quot; (1997). Live album of Lavoie&#x27;s best hits along with never-before performed pieces, &quot;Live au Divan Vert&quot; (European title &quot;Le meilleur de Daniel Lavoie&quot;) was recorded in 1997.

In 1998 Lavoie was cast as priest Frollo in Richard Cocciante and Luc Plamondon&#x27;s new musical &quot;Notre-Dame de Paris&quot;, which was based on the eponymous novel by Victor Hugo. The musical became very successful (&quot;Notre-Dame De Paris&quot; won world&#x27;s best-selling artist/group for 1998 at the World Music Awards on May 5, 1999) Albums were sold by the millions (certified triple-platinum by CRIA for sales of more than 300,000 copies), and for seven months Daniel sang the part of Frollo in front of sold-out crowds of the Palais des Congrès in Paris. After that he also participated in the show&#x27;s tour in France, as well as the Quebec production and the English version in London, in 2000. The song &quot;Belle&quot;, which he performed with Garou and Patrick Fiori became enormously popular (in 1998 3 million copies of this song were sold in Europe, where it was no. 1 for 30 weeks.)

In 2002 Lavoie was cast in another musical in Paris, this time &quot;Le Petit Prince&quot; by Richard Cocciante and Elisabeth Anais, based on Antoine de St-Exupéry&#x27;s book. He performed the part of the Pilot until April 2003.

The new album &quot;Comédies humaines&quot; was released in 2004 and included hits like &quot;Violoncelle&quot; and &quot;Bénies Soient Les Femmes&quot;. A tour in France and Quebec followed. The same year Lavoie released a storybook for children illustrated by Oksana Kemarskaya &quot;Roulé Boulé: Je suis une boule qui roule&quot;, accompanied by an album of the same name that consisted of selections from the two &quot;Bébé dragon&quot; albums. In 2011 this work was selected along with several other books for use as elementary school teaching texts in Quebec and republished with a teaching aide within a series &quot;L&#x27;école de La Montagne secrète&quot;.

In February 2005 Lavoie participated in a stage revival of &quot;Nelligan&quot;, an opera by André Gagnon based on the works and biography of Émile Nelligan, Quebec&#x27;s late 19th-century poet. The show, in which Lavoie sang the part of the Old Nelligan was recorded in a live album.

<text>&quot;I Am the Night—Color Me Black&quot; is episode 146 of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. It originally aired on March 27, 1964 on CBS.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
Sheriff Koch cannot sleep the night before the execution of a man, as he feels conflicted about the situation. His wife Ella is no comfort as she snarls, &quot;What time do they string him up; you know what I mean...what time does he get hung?&quot; Her attitude represents the hateful sentiment of the town that looks forward to the fate of Jagger, a man who is to be hanged after being wrongfully convicted of killing a bigot; he claims self defense, and is unrepentant about the killing. On the day of his execution, the sun does not rise in the morning, and it seems that this is the only place in the world where this is true.

There is still some dispute as to whether Jagger is guilty. The sheriff is conflicted, while the deputy is convinced Jagger is guilty; the latter is accused of perjury by the town news reporter. That morning the deputy becomes loud and obnoxious, and the sheriff tells him: &quot;You better unravel it Pierce, or I&#x27;ll spread you all over this yard&quot;. At 9:00 AM, just before the hanging, it is still dark; the radio now reporting the darkness confined to this one small village. The sheriff admits he feels guilty because he didn&#x27;t question the lack of autopsy of the victim, and didn&#x27;t care that there were powder burns on the victim despite the deputy testifying that Jagger shot the victim from across a room. The sheriff wanted to be reelected, and as such went along with the status quo.

However, Jagger is hanged anyway at 9:30, much to the delight of the town. The town clergyman, although a different faith and race than Jagger, steps in and says that he is thankful to him for having stood up for him and his kind. The clergyman asks if Jagger had felt hate and enjoyment when he killed the man. Jagger confirms he did. After this, the clergyman also reluctantly agrees to the execution, proclaiming that Jagger was in fact guilty. Jagger is disheartened, saying “It’s important to get with the majority isn’t it? That’s a big thing nowadays isn’t it, Reverend?” The Reverend replies: &quot;The majority is all there is, the minority must have died on the cross 2,000 years ago&quot;. After the hanging, the deputy says that for having gone along with the execution, that the clergyman has &quot;seen the light&quot;. The clergyman replies that the sky is black because of all the hatred in the world, namely the hatred surrounding Jagger&#x27;s execution. The sky becomes even darker after the execution. The deputy is convinced that the darkness is nothing more than fog, which will eventually lift, but neither the sheriff nor the reporter are convinced.

Later, a radio broadcast reveals that the town is not the only place where this disturbance is happening. The sky has turned dark over North Vietnam; a section of the Berlin Wall; areas of Shanghai and Birmingham, AL; a political prison in Budapest; a section of Dallas (where President Kennedy was fatally shot), and other places around the world where hatred runs rampant.

==Production notes==
Serling wrote this script primarily as his personal reaction to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963. Indeed, mention is made in the story of &quot;a street in Dallas, Texas&quot; (where Kennedy was murdered as his motorcade traveled down Elm Street in Dallas&#x27; Dealey Plaza) as being enveloped by the strange darkness.

The episode is similar to &quot;Many, Many Monkeys&quot;, a script written for &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; by its producer, William Froug, but never shot. In that script an epidemic breaks out in which afflicted persons&#x27; eyes seal shut as folds of flesh grow over them. Though a nuclear explosion is initially blamed, one character proposes that it is a physical manifestation of hate that is blinding them. The network bought the script but then shelved it, finding its subject matter too disturbing, but it was eventually produced in 1989, during the first revival of &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;.

Years earlier, Serling had written a teleplay for &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; called &quot;A Town Has Turned to Dust&quot;, about the 1870 lynching of an innocent Mexican man in a Southwestern town. This story was based on the Emmett Till case, and Serling had to deal with executive interference and network censors before the episode could air.

<text>Peter Wynford Innes Rees, Baron Rees, (9 December 1926 – 30 November 2008) was a British Conservative politician and barrister. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Dover and Deal from 1974 to 1983 and MP for Dover from 1970 to 1974 and 1983 to 1987. He was Chief Secretary to the Treasury from 1983 until 1985. He was created a life peer as Baron Rees, of Goytre, in 1987.

==Early life and education==
Rees was born in Camberley, Surrey, the only son of Major-General Thomas Wynford Rees of the India Army, and Agatha Rosalie (&quot;née&quot; Innes). His maternal grandfather was Sir Charles Alexander Innes, Governor of British Burma from 1927 to 1932. He was educated at Stowe School. He joined the Scots Guards in 1945 and three years later continued his education at Christ Church, Oxford. In 1953, he was called to the bar by the Inner Temple. He became a QC in 1969.

==Political career==
At the 1964 general election Rees stood as the Conservative candidate in the safe Labour seat of Abertillery, where he won only 14% of the votes, against the 86% won by the only other candidate, Labour&#x27;s Reverend Llewellyn Williams. When Williams died in 1965, Rees was the Conservative candidate in the consequent by-election, losing by a similarly large margin.

At the 1966 election, he stood in the more promising Labour-held seat of Liverpool West Derby, but lost again.

He finally entered Parliament at the 1970 general election, when he won in Dover, with a majority of 1,649 over sitting Labour MP David Ennals.

==Parliament==
In Edward Heath&#x27;s government, he served from 1972 to 1973 as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Solicitor General, Michael Havers.

In 1979, when the Conservative Party entered government under Margaret Thatcher, he became Minister of State at the Treasury, working to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Geoffrey Howe, before becoming Minister for Trade in 1981. After the 1983 UK general election he was appointed to the cabinet as Chief Secretary to the Treasury, working to the new Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson. He was made Privy Counsellor the same year.

Unlike most other Chief Secretaries to the Treasury, Peter Rees never went further within the Cabinet, leaving the post in the September 1985 cabinet reshuffle. He retired from Parliament at the 1987 general election, aged 61, and on 16 November 1987 was created a life peer as Baron Rees, of Goytre in the County of Gwent and sat in the House of Lords as a Conservative.

==Personal life==
In 1969, he married Anthea Peronelle Wendell, daughter of Major Hugh John Maxwell-Hyslop, and former wife of Major Jack Wendell. They had no children. Through this marriage, he was the stepfather of Anthea&#x27;s daughters from her first marriage to Jac Wendell: Francesca and Serena Wendell (later the second wife of John Crichton-Stuart, 7th Marquess of Bute).

Rees died of a spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital, London, following a short illness. He was buried at St Peter&#x27;s Church, Goytre.

<text>Gloria Coates (née Kannenberg; October 10, 1933 – August 19, 2023) was an American composer who lived in Munich from 1969 until her death. She trained and worked also as actress, stage director, singer, author and painter. She is known for her many symphonies, and also wrote chamber music, and vocal music for large and small ensembles. Her compositions have been performed internationally and recorded by notable orchestras. She ran a concert series for new music in Munich. Her First Symphony &quot;Music on Open Strings&quot; was played at the 1978 Warsaw Autumn and was the first composition by a woman in the musica viva series of Bayerischer Rundfunk.

== Life and career ==
Gloria Kannenberg was born in Wausau, Wisconsin, on October 10, 1933; her mother was Natalie Kannenberg, an Italian singer, and her father was Robert Kannenberg, an American politician of German descent. She began improvising and composing as a child, guided by her mother. From age seven, she took piano lessons and later also voice lessons from Elizabeth Silverthorn, music director at the local Episcopal Church. She achieved a composition prize from the National Federation of Music Clubs for one of her songs, to a text that she wrote herself, at age 14. She met composer Alexander Tcherepnin in 1952, who encouraged her and gave her private lessons, and whose summer courses at the Salzburg Mozarteum she attended in 1962. She married Francis M. Coates, an attorney, in 1959.

Coates then studied at different universities and the Cooper Union Art School, achieving a bachelor&#x27;s degree in drama and painting in 1963, and in composition and singing the same year. She became a Master of Music in composition in 1965, and took post-graduate studies in composition with Otto Luening at Columbia University in 1967 and 1968. She also studied with Jack Beeson.

Her early works were performed in the 1960s in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and in New York City. She worked in Chicago, New York and Louisiana as a singer, actress, drama director, author and painter.

In 1969, Coates travelled to Germany on a freighter, together with her small daughter, to study singing Lieder in Stuttgart. Stopping in Munich, she had a skiing accident that injured her spine. From 1971 she focused on composition, although knowing that it was harder than painting and acting. She ran a concert series in Munich, entitled German-American Music, from 1971 to 1984. Her works were performed at the 1972 Darmstädter Ferienkurse.
Coates had a breakthrough with her First Symphony, subtitled &quot;Music on Open Strings&quot;, composed in 1973 for a string orchestra tuned differently. It was played at the 1978 Warsaw Autumn festival and was the work discussed most. It was a finalist in the 1986 Koussevitzky competition, and was the first composition by a woman in the musica viva concert series of Bayerischer Rundfunk. Her works were also performed at the Dresdner Musikfestspiele, and the festival New Music America.

Coates died from pancreatic cancer in Munich on August 19, 2023, at the age of 89.

== Music ==
Coates composed symphonies, chamber music for different ensembles, vocal music and multimedia works. She experimented with vocal works for many voices. She set texts to music by Emily Dickinson, and her own daughter, Alexandra. She said that her music is serious, not funny, because she experienced sadness in her childhood, making her cheerful but with a serious unconscious side.&quot; Coates is credited as the most prolific female symphony composer.

Coates commented her symphonies in an interview: &quot;I thought, &#x27;That&#x27;s really gutsy of me to call it a symphony&#x27;. I always had an idea of symphonies being in the 19th century, somehow. I never set out to write a symphony as such. It has to do with the intensity of what I&#x27;m trying to say and the fact that it took 48 different instrumental lines to say it, and that the structures I was using had evolved over many years. I couldn&#x27;t call it a little name.&quot;

As interviewer Trevor Hunter noted:

Mark Swed wrote that &quot;Coates is a master of microtones, of taking a listener to aural places you never knew could exist and finding the mystical spaces between tones.&quot; Kyle Gann described in liner notes to one of her albums:

== Painting ==
Besides composing, Gloria Coates also painted abstract expressionistic paintings that were often used as the covers for her albums. In her paintings, complementary colors such as red and green, yellow and blue, interact, in a manner of swirls of colours reminiscent of the style of Vincent van Gogh. She painted colourful works, applying paint in energetic strokes.

<text>Léopold Simoneau, (May 3, 1916 – August 24, 2006) was a French-Canadian lyric tenor, one of the outstanding Mozarteans of his time. In 1959 he became the first recipient of the Calixa-Lavallée Award.

==Life and career==
Simoneau was born in Saint-Flavien, Quebec, and started his vocal studies in Quebec City at the Collège de Lévis and Université Laval. While studying in Montreal with Salvator Issaurel, he made his professional debut with &quot;Les Variétés Lyriques&quot; in Montréal in 1941.

He then left for New York City for complementary studies with Paul Althouse. In 1946 he appeared at the New York City Center as Lionel in &quot;Martha&quot;. That same year he married French-Canadian soprano Pierrette Alarie. Together they left for France.

Simoneau made his debut in 1949 at the Opéra-Comique of Paris as Vincent in Gounod&#x27;s opera &quot;Mireille&quot; and at the Paris Opera as Tamino in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;. He made his debut at the Aix-en-Provence Festival in 1950 singing Ottavio in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; and Ferrando in &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;. The following year, 1951, he made his debut at the Glyndebourne Festival as Idamante in &quot;Idomeneo&quot;. His performances at these two festivals quickly established him as the outstanding Mozartian tenor of his time. He was invited to sing at the Salzburg Festival and the Edinburgh International Festival, at the Vienna State Opera and at La Scala in Milan, while pursuing his career in France, in roles such as Nadir in Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Les pêcheurs de perles&quot;, Gérald in Delibes&#x27; &quot;Lakmé&quot;. He took part in the revival of opera such as Rameau&#x27;s &quot;Les Indes galantes&quot; and Orphée in the French version for tenor of Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot;. In France he was frequently singing opposite his wife, who was a light lyric coloratura soprano excelling in the same repertoire as her husband.

In the 1950s he made several famous recordings, including one of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; with Bruno Walter conducting, and also in 1956 Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; with The Wiener Staatsopernchor, The Wiener Philarmoniker conducted by Dimitri Mitropoulos. He also participated in two celebrated recordings with Philips Records, &quot;Les pêcheurs de perles&quot; conducted by Jean Fournet, and Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Orphée et Euridyce&quot; conducted by Hans Rosbaud, in which he gave what some critics feel are the definitive performances of the roles of Nadir and Orphée. Simoneau also sang the role of Belmonte in Sir Thomas Beecham&#x27;s recording of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot;, and the role of Ferrando in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; opposite Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Nan Merriman, Rolando Panerai, Lisa Otto, Sesto Bruscantini, conducted by Herbert von Karajan, both considered classics. He also sang in Charles Munch&#x27;s critically acclaimed 1959 recording of the Berlioz Requiem.

Simoneau made his debut at the Lyric Opera of Chicago in 1954, he sang there until 1961, notably in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La traviata&quot; opposite Maria Callas. His only Metropolitan Opera appearances were five performances of Don Ottavio during the 1963-64 season.

Simoneau&#x27;s final appearance was in Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; in Montréal on November 24, 1970. He was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1971, he was promoted to Companion in 1995. Simoneau was also made a Knight of the National Order of Quebec in 1997.

After retiring, Simoneau and his wife became active as teachers, notably at the Banff Centre. They also founded the Canada Piccola Opera in Victoria, British Columbia, in 1982. The couple had two daughters, Isabelle and Chantal.

Léopold Simoneau died at his home on August 24, 2006, in Victoria, British Columbia, at the age of 90.

<doc id="1344716" wikidata="Q331898" url="?curid=1344716" title="Errantry">
<text>&quot;Errantry&quot; is a three-page poem by J.R.R. Tolkien, first published in &quot;The Oxford Magazine&quot; in 1933. It was included in revised and extended form in Tolkien&#x27;s 1962 collection of short poems, &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot;. Donald Swann set the poem to music in his 1967 song cycle, &quot;The Road Goes Ever On&quot;.

The poem has a complex metre, invented by Tolkien. It fits the tune of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s patter song, &quot;I Am the Very Model of a Modern Major-General&quot;. It shares metre and rhyming patterns with the &quot;Song of Eärendil&quot;, a poem entirely different in tone. The scholar Paul H. Kocher calls the pair &quot;obviously designed for contrast&quot;.

The Tolkien scholar Randel Helms calls it &quot;a stunningly skillful piece of versification... with smooth and lovely rhythms&quot;. Tolkien described it as &quot;the most attractive&quot; of his poems.

==Poem==

===Subject=== 

The &quot;J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia&quot; describes &quot;Errantry&quot; as &quot;the nonsensical adventures of a tiny messenger knight who falls in love with a butterfly and battles various insects.&quot; It adds that it is then linked to the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins&#x27;s &quot;serious account of Eärendil&#x27;s quest&quot; as described in Tolkien&#x27;s 1954–55 novel &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. 

The poem mentions creatures called Dumbledors and Hummerhorns. &quot;Dumbledor&quot; is an English dialect word for bumblebee, while according to the Tolkien scholars Christina Scull and Wayne G. Hammond, &quot;Hummerhorn&quot; is apparently a name invented by Tolkien for a large wasp or hornet.

===Metre===

Tolkien invented the metre, which consists of trisyllabic assonances, three in each set of four lines. The second and fourth line in every quatrain rhyme, as do the end of the first line and beginning of the second line in every pair. He found this so difficult that he never wrote another poem in this style, though he did later develop another style from this, and the result, through long evolution from &quot;Errantry&quot;, was &quot;Eärendil the Mariner&quot;, published in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;.

Joe R. Christopher, in the &quot;J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia&quot;, writes that the poem could be seen conventionally as quatrains of iambic tetrameters with ABCB rhyme, but that the recording of Tolkien reading the poem shows the metre to be his own invention. In Christopher&#x27;s analysis, each line is composed of &quot;two second-class paeons&quot;, each consisting of an iamb and a pyrrhus: ˘ − ˘ ˘. There is an additional rhyme or half-rhyme of the ends of the A or C lines with the first paeon of the B lines.

Catherine McIlwaine, director of an exhibition of Tolkien&#x27;s works, called the poem &quot;a new metrical experiment&quot;, noting that Tolkien read it to The Inklings, C. S. Lewis&#x27;s literary group at Oxford.

==Middle-earth framework==

For &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot;, Tolkien needed to find a way to incorporate the poem into the framework of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. The scholar Tom Shippey states that he achieved this &quot;with great &quot;finesse&quot;&quot; with the explanation that &quot;Errantry&quot; was an early work by the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins, composed soon after his return from the journey described in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, so that he knew a little about Elves, but before he had moved to Rivendell where he actually studied Elvish languages properly. Accordingly, the work is sometimes classed as a Hobbit poem.

==Setting==
The composer and entertainer Donald Swann set the poem to music. The sheet music and an audio recording are part of his 1967 song cycle, &quot;The Road Goes Ever On&quot;.

The &quot;J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia&quot; states that the poem was &quot;evidently&quot; inspired by Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s patter song &quot;I Am the Very Model of a Modern Major-General&quot;, whose tune it fits, and further that Swann&#x27;s musical setting is an obvious pastiche of Sullivan&#x27;s style.

==Analysis==

The scholar of English Randel Helms described &quot;Errantry&quot; as &quot;a stunningly skillful piece of versification... with smooth and lovely rhythms&quot;. The Scottish poet Alan Bold, who, Melanie Rawls notes, disliked almost all of Tolkien&#x27;s verse, dismissed Helm&#x27;s praise, writing that the poem &quot;certainly displays all the sentimental silliness of the early Tolkien with its relentlessly contrived internal rhyming&quot;.

Shippey comments that the subject matter of tiny fairies was exactly what, later in his career, Tolkien came to abhor, emphasising instead the energy and strength of Elves and Dwarves. He suggests that Tolkien may have been especially proud of the poem&#x27;s complex metre, and so chose to rework and extend the poem for the 1962 book. Tolkien indeed called it &quot;the most attractive&quot; of his poems in a 1952 letter to his publisher, Rayner Unwin, adding that 

Paul H. Kocher writes that &quot;Errantry&quot; and the &quot;Song of Eärendil&quot; are &quot;obviously designed for contrast&quot;, as if Tolkien had set himself the challenge of using the same theme of endless wandering, the same metrical forms and the same rhyming schemes, it would be possible to create both a tragedy and an &quot;airy jest&quot;: &quot;Looking at the passages picturing the armour of the two heroes we can see both the similarity in structure and the polarity in tone&quot;.

<doc id="1344723" wikidata="Q1198149" url="?curid=1344723" title="2 Become 1">
<text>&quot;2 Become 1&quot; is a song by the British girl group the Spice Girls. Written by the group members, together with Matt Rowe and Richard Stannard during the group&#x27;s first professional songwriting session, it was produced by Rowe and Stannard for the group&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Spice&quot; (1996). &quot;2 Become 1&quot; is an R&amp;B-influenced pop ballad that features instrumentation from a guitar, an electronic keyboard and string instruments. The lyrics focus on the bonding of two lovers, and also address the importance of safe sex. Its Big TV!-directed music video, which features the group performing against time-lapse footage of Times Square in New York City, was completely shot against a blue screen at a studio in London. The backdrop was later superimposed.

Released as the group&#x27;s third single on 16 December 1996 by Virgin, it was generally well received by music critics and was a commercial success. It topped the UK Singles Chart for three weeks, becoming the group&#x27;s third consecutive chart-topper, their second million-selling single, and their first Christmas number-one single in the United Kingdom. In July 1997, the song was released in the United States, peaking at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and receiving a gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It performed similarly internationally, peaking inside the top ten on the majority of the charts that it entered. The song was named &quot;Song of the Year&quot; at the 1998 ASCAP London Music Awards.

In 2019, Emma Bunton covered the song, as a duet, with Robbie Williams on her fourth solo album, &quot;My Happy Place&quot;. In December 2024, an orchestral version by Bunton with the Budapest Scoring Orchestra was released.

==Background==
In December 1994, the Spice Girls persuaded their former managers—father-and-son team Bob and Chris Herbert—to set up a showcase in front of industry writers, producers and A&amp;R men at the Nomis Studios in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, London. Producer Richard Stannard was originally at the studio to meet pop star Jason Donovan, but he ended up in the showcase after hearing Melanie Brown, as she went charging across the corridor. Stannard recalls:
More than anything, they just made me laugh. I couldn&#x27;t believe I&#x27;d walked into this situation. You didn&#x27;t care if they were in time with the dance steps or whether one was overweight or one wasn&#x27;t as good as the others. It was something more. It just made you feel happy. Like great pop records.
Stannard stayed after everyone had left the showcase to talk to the group. He then reported back to his songwriter partner Matt Rowe that he had found the pop group of their dreams. In January 1995, Chris Herbert booked the group&#x27;s first professional songwriting session with the producers at the Strongroom in Curtain Road, East London. Rowe remember feeling similarly to Stannard when he first met the group, &quot;I love them. Immediately. [...] They were like no one I&#x27;d met before, really.&quot; The session was productive as the duo seemed to get along with the group; together they discussed the songwriting process and what they wanted to do with the record. In her autobiography, Brown recalled that the duo instinctively understood their point of view and knew how to incorporate &quot;the spirit of five loud girls into great pop music&quot;.

==Writing and inspiration==

&quot;2 Become 1&quot; was co-written by the Spice Girls along with partners Richard Stannard and Matthew Rowe. Stannard and Rowe also co-produced the track. After writing more uptempo dance-based songs, such as &quot;Wannabe&quot;, the group and the two producers decided to write a slow ballad. But as the group were writing the song, they realised that it was a bit too slushy, so it was decided to address the importance of contraception with the lyrics: &quot;Be a little bit wiser, baby. Put it on, put it on&quot;.

The song was inspired by the &quot;special relationship&quot; that was developing between Geri Halliwell and Rowe. Brown hinted at this development in her autobiography, commenting: &quot;When [Rowe] and Geri started making eyes at each other I knew what was going on, even though they denied it. I knew them both too well for it to be a secret for me.&quot; Stannard commented about the fondness between Halliwell and Rowe: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to get into the side of things. They were very close. They clicked. And I think the lyrics in &#x27;2 Become 1&#x27; came from that, especially the first verse, which they wrote together.&quot;

===Spanish version===
The group recorded a European Spanish version of the song, written by them, Rowe, Stannard, and N. Maño. The title was &quot;2 Become 1&quot; (Spanish Version), although the title is loosely translated in one line of the song, &quot;Seremos Uno Los Dos&quot;. It was released as the eleventh track of their debut album, &quot;Spice&quot;, in Latin America and South Africa, in a special re-edition of the album in Spain, and as one of the tracks of the &quot;2 Become 1&quot; maxi-single in the US. A Spanglish edit that traded verses between the English and Spanish versions was created by DJ Mike Rizzo and production director Bill Schultz for New York-based radio WKTU.

==Composition==

&quot;2 Become 1&quot; is a pop ballad with R&amp;B influences, written in the key of F major; it is set in the time signature of common time and moves at a slow tempo of 72 beats per minute. The song is constructed in a verse–chorus form, and its instrumentation comes from a guitar, an electronic keyboard, and string instruments. The song opens with an instrumental introduction, with a chord progression of Em add9–D/F–G–Am7 sus4, that is also used during the first part of the verses. The last two lines of each verse changes the progression to C–Bm7–Am7–D11, and changes again during each chorus to G–D–C–D. It closes with a string outro that uses the chord progression F–G–B–C, which is arranged by Scottish composer Craig Armstrong.

The lyrics focus on how the bonding of two lovers can become so strong that they practically become one entity, through the act of sexual intercourse. Apart from the sexual connotations, there is an aspirational undercurrent to the lyrics, and like many of their subsequent songs, desire is explicitly linked to ambition: &quot;Free your mind of doubt and danger/Be for real don&#x27;t be a stranger/We can achieve it/We can achieve it&quot;.

Two different versions of the song, each with different lyrics, were recorded: in the album version, the two first verses are sung by Melanie C and Melanie Brown, Emma Bunton sings the pre-choruses, the next second two verses are sung by Melanie C and Geri Halliwell, and the first and third lines of the chorus are sung by Bunton and Halliwell together, the second and fourth lines are sung by Melanie C and Victoria Beckham together and the fifth line is sung by Brown. The second line of the second verse, &quot;Any deal that we endeavour/Boys and girls feel good together&quot;, was changed in the single version to: &quot;Once again if we endeavour/Love will bring us back together&quot;. Halliwell sings on the album version, while Beckham sings on the single version, after Halliwell confessed that she had a hard time singing in that particular key. Bunton later stated that the lyric change was necessary after realising that the group had become LGBT icons. Despite the original lyrics still being used in album pressings of &quot;Spice&quot;, due to the album not being revised since 1997, the single version appeared on the 25th anniversary reissue of the album, in place of the album version. The single version also contains slightly different vocals from the rest of the group.

The single version appears in the music video and is available on the group&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album, and on stage the girls always performed the single version before and after Halliwell&#x27;s departure.

==Release==
&quot;2 Become 1&quot; was released in the United Kingdom on 16 December 1996, in three single versions. The first one, a maxi single that included the single version of the track, an orchestral take, the Junior Vasquez remix of &quot;Wannabe&quot;, and &quot;One of These Girls&quot;, a song written by the group with Paul Wilson and Andy Watkins—the songwriters and production duo known as Absolute. The second version was the special Christmas pack, a standard CD single in a cardboard case that included a signed postcard with a Christmas message from the group. This version contained the single version, the Dave Way remix, and their own version of Leroy Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Sleigh Ride&quot;. The third version was a two-track cassette single, featuring the single version and the orchestral take of the song. The same track listing was also used for the release of the European CD single. In the United States, the single was serviced to contemporary hit radio on 1 July 1997. Four weeks later, on 29 July, two CD singles were issued in the US.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The song was generally well received by music critics. Brian Grosz from Albumism described it as &quot;a smooth R&amp;B jam&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it a &quot;perfect adult contemporary confection&quot;. In a review of the group&#x27;s 2007 compilation album, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, Talia Kraines of BBC Music called it &quot;shimmering&quot;, adding that &quot;only a cold heart could fail to love their first festive #1&quot;. Larry Flick of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine said that &quot;they are surprisingly adept at weaving warm and romantic imagery over a sweet melody&quot;, adding that &quot;[Everyone] will delight in the track&#x27;s arrangement of soft harmonies and delicate acoustic guitar riffs&quot;. Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; said that their first album &quot;is a compendium of slick secondhand urban pop encompassing [...] G-funk synths on &#x27;Say You&#x27;ll Be There&#x27; [...] and Babyface&#x27;s guitar and strings balladry on &#x27;2 Become 1&#x27;&quot;. Digital Spy&#x27;s Nick Levine noted that the group&#x27;s slower songs were &quot;probably their strongest suit&quot;, and thought that the song &quot;manages to combine every element of the perfect Christmas ballad–a touch of elegance, a hint of romance, a soupcon of sexiness and a generous sprinkling of sparkle–and still finds time for a coy safe sex message&quot;. Whitney Pastorek of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said that it is &quot;too slow, and the lyrics appear to have been written by a safe-sex-loving unicorn&quot;, adding that &quot;it&#x27;s almost impossible to identify the individual Spice Girls by their voices here, so airbrushed are the proceedings&quot;. A reviewer from &quot;Music Week&quot; rated the song five out of five, adding, &quot;No turkey this as Spice Girls virtually guarantee a third chart topper and look a strong bet for the Christmas number one with a seasonally lush ballad. Anticipate much smooching &#x27;neath the mistletoe.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Christopher John Farley called it a &quot;slumberous ballad [...] [that] seem[s] designed to amuse, titillate, ingratiate&quot;. In a review of the group&#x27;s debut album &quot;Spice&quot;, Dev Sherlock of Yahoo! Music Radio called it a &quot;glossy ballad that would do Mariah Carey proud&quot;. 
===Chart performance===
&quot;2 Become 1&quot; was originally going to be released in the UK on 9 December 1996, but the release date was delayed to let Dunblane&#x27;s &quot;Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot;—a tribute to the children killed at the Dunblane Primary School in Scotland—stay at the top of the UK Singles Chart. The single was released the next week, debuting at the top, becoming the group&#x27;s third chart-topper and their first Christmas number-one single in the UK. It sold 209,000 copies in the first three days of release and 462,000 in the first week, becoming the fifth best-selling single of the year. &quot;2 Become 1&quot; sold 1.14 million copies in total, giving the Spice Girls their second and final million-selling single in the UK. Despite being released during the final two weeks of 1996, &quot;2 Become 1&quot; was the 5th best seller of the year and that year&#x27;s fastest selling single of the year.

In Ireland, &quot;2 Become 1&quot; was the group&#x27;s second number-one single, and their first to debut at the top of the Irish Singles Chart. It stayed at the top position for six weeks, and became their first Christmas number-one single in the country. &quot;2 Become 1&quot; peaked at No. 3 on the Eurochart Hot 100, and performed similarly across the rest of Europe, topping the singles chart in Spain, peaking inside the top ten in Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland, and inside the top fifteen in Belgium and Germany. It was also commercially successful in Australia and New Zealand, peaking inside the top three on both countries.

In July 1997, &quot;2 Become 1&quot; debuted on the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; singles chart at No. 87, peaked at No. 3 on its fifth week, and ended at No. 25 on the year-end chart. On the Adult Contemporary chart it peaked at No. 4, and ended at No. 27 on the year-end chart. In the United States, the song debuted on 16 August 1997 at No. 6, reaching a peak of No. 4 in its fourth week, becoming the group&#x27;s third consecutive top five in the country. The song peaked at No. 6 on the Hot 100 Airplay chart and at No. 8 on the Hot 100 Singles Sales chart, selling 700,000 copies as of December 1997. It peaked at four on the Mainstream Top 40, and had crossover success, peaking at four on the Rhythmic Top 40 and at eight on the Adult Contemporary chart.

==Music video==
===Background===

The music video for &quot;2 Become 1&quot; was directed on 5–6 November 1996 by Big TV!, in a two-day shoot located at a studio in Old Compton Street, London. Cinematographer Stephen Keith-Roach, who worked in other music videos such as Jamiroquai&#x27;s &quot;Virtual Insanity&quot; and U2&#x27;s &quot;Discothèque&quot;, was in charge of the photography. The shoot involved the group dressed in winter coats, wandering around the studio against a green screen, interspersed with close-up camera angles, so that the backdrop could be superimposed later. To achieve the effect of the wind rippling through their hair, the group was required to lip synch the song in double time while wind machines were blowing on them.

===Synopsis===
The music video features the group wandering around Times Square in New York City, with fast moving cars appearing around multi-coloured lights. They appear in various places around the city, either alone, with one other member, or as a quintet. The video is intercut with scenes of lovers experiencing moments of togetherness and closes with a deer wandering the streets. Such a scene, according to the group&#x27;s first official book &quot;Girl Power!&quot;, gave them a running gag all throughout the shoot—&quot;Whenever anyone made a mistake it was, &#x27;Oh, deer&#x27;.&quot; Sometimes, the closing scene would not be shown on television, due to the song fading out to an instrumental, which lasts for 40 seconds.

In the same book, Victoria Beckham wrote about the shoot: &quot;I think &#x27;2 Become 1&#x27; is my favourite video. [...] It was really different to the other videos–shot entirely in the studio, with high technology and loads of effects. It was really weird having to sing passionately into the camera, I was feeling a right mug in front of all those people singing &#x27;wanna make love to ya baby&#x27;.&quot;

==Live performances==

The song was performed many times on television, including the &quot;Bravo Supershow&quot;, &quot;GMTV&quot;, &quot;Live &amp; Kicking&quot;, &quot;Noel&#x27;s House Party&quot;, and &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. In October 1997, the group performed &quot;2 Become 1&quot; as the eighth song of their first live concert at the Abdi İpekçi Arena in Istanbul, Turkey. The performance was broadcast on Showtime in a pay-per-view event titled &quot;Spice Girls in Concert Wild!&quot;, and was later included in the VHS and DVD release &quot;Girl Power! Live in Istanbul&quot;. The group was scheduled to perform the song on the semi-final of the fifth season of the British television show &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, on 16 December, but it was postponed to the finale, 22 December, as Emma sprained her ankle badly and was not able to perform.

The Spice Girls have performed the song on their four tours, the Spiceworld Tour, the Christmas in Spiceworld Tour, the Return of the Spice Girls Tour and the Spice World - 2019 Tour. After Halliwell&#x27;s departure in 1998, Bunton sang the first and third lines of the chorus alone during the Spiceworld Tour, but in the Christmas in Spiceworld Tour Beckham replaced Halliwell during the first and third lines of the chorus along with Bunton, while Brown replaced Beckham during the second and fourth lines of the chorus along with Melanie C.
 The performance at the Spiceworld Tour&#x27;s final concert can be found on the video: &quot;Spice Girls Live at Wembley Stadium&quot;, filmed in London, on 20 September 1998. For the Return of the Spice Girls Tour, the group performed it during the second segment of the show. After the &quot;Too Much&quot; performance, each of the girls emerged from a cocoon of oversized swan wings and danced around a set of barber&#x27;s poles while singing the song. For the Girls return without Beckham for Spice World - 2019 Tour, Halliwell sang a mixture of her and Beckham&#x27;s original lines – &quot;Any deal that we endeavour/Love will bring us back together...&quot;. This was the first time Halliwell had sung a solo live on the track since the &quot;Spice&quot; debut album.

<text>Gangtok ( , ) is the capital and the most populous city of the Indian state of Sikkim. The seat of eponymous district, Gangtok is in the eastern Himalayan range, at an elevation of . The city&#x27;s population of 100,000 consists of the three Sikkimese ethnicities: the Bhutias, Lepchas, Nepalis as well as plainsmen from other states of India. Within the higher peaks of the Himalayas and with a year-round mild temperate climate, Gangtok is at the centre of Sikkim&#x27;s tourism industry.

Gangtok rose to prominence as a popular Buddhist pilgrimage site after the construction of the Enchey Monastery in 1840. In 1894, the ruling Sikkimese Chogyal, Thutob Namgyal, transferred the capital to Gangtok. In the early 20th century, Gangtok became a major stopover on the trade route between Lhasa in Tibet and cities such as Kolkata (then Calcutta) in British India. After India won its independence from the British Empire in 1947, Sikkim chose to remain an independent monarchy, with Gangtok as its capital. After Sikkim&#x27;s merger with India in 1975, Gangtok continued as the state capital.

==Etymology==
The precise meaning of the name &quot;Gangtok&quot; is unclear, though most agree that the meaning is &quot;hill top&quot;.In &lt;br&gt; Wylie: &quot; Sgang Tog &quot; 

== History ==

Like the rest of Sikkim, not much is known about the early history of Gangtok. The earliest records date from the construction of the hermitic Gangtok monastery in 1716. Gangtok remained a small hamlet until the construction of the Enchey Monastery in 1840 made it a pilgrimage centre. It became the capital of what was left of Sikkim after its English conquest in the mid-19th century in response to a hostage crisis. After the defeat of the Tibetans by the British, Gangtok became a major stopover in the trade between Tibet and British India at the end of the 19th century. Most of the roads and the telegraph in the area were built during this time.

In 1894, Thutob Namgyal, the Sikkimese monarch under British rule, shifted the capital from Tumlong to Gangtok, increasing the city&#x27;s importance. A new grand palace along with other state buildings was built in the new capital. Following India&#x27;s independence in 1947, Sikkim became a nation-state with Gangtok as its capital. Sikkim came under the suzerainty of India, with the condition that it would retain its independence, by the treaty signed between the Chogyal and the then Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. This pact gave the Indians control of external affairs on behalf of Sikkimese. Trade between India and Tibet flourished through the Nathula and Jelepla passes, benefiting Gangtok. Trade declined with the Chinese crackdown in Tibet in 1959 and the passes were sealed after the Sino-Indian War in 1962. The Nathula pass was finally opened to limited trade in 2006, fuelling hopes of economic boom.

In 1975, after years of political uncertainty and struggle, including riots, the monarchy was abrogated and Sikkim became India&#x27;s twenty-second state, with Gangtok as its capital after a referendum. Gangtok has witnessed annual landslides, resulting in loss of life and damage to property. The largest disaster occurred in June 1997, when 38 were killed and hundreds of buildings were destroyed.

== Geography ==
Gangtok is located at (coordinates of Gangtok head post office). It is in the lower Himalayas at an elevation of . The town is on the side of a hill, with &quot;The Ridge&quot;, a promenade with the Raj Bhawan, the governor&#x27;s residence, at one end and the palace, at an altitude of about , at the other. The city is flanked east and west by two streams, Roro Chu and Ranikhola. These two rivers divide the natural drainage into two parts, eastern and western. Both streams meet the Ranipul and flow south as the Ranikhola before joining the Teesta at Singtam. Most roads are steep, with the buildings built on compacted ground alongside them.
Most of Sikkim, including Gangtok, is underlain by Precambrian rocks which contain foliated phyllites and schists; slopes are therefore prone to frequent landslides. Surface runoff of water by natural streams (&quot;jhora&quot;) and man-made drains has contributed to the risk of landslides. According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, the town falls under seismic zone-IV (on a scale of I to V, in order of increasing seismic activity), near the convergent boundary of the Indian and the Eurasian tectonic plates and is subject to frequent earthquakes. The hills are nestled within higher peaks and the snow-clad Himalayan ranges tower over the town in the distance. Mount Kanchenjunga ()—the world&#x27;s third-highest peak—is visible to the west of the city. The existence of steep slopes, vulnerability to landslides, large forest cover and inadequate access to most areas have been a major impediment to the natural and balanced growth of the city.

Densely forested regions surround Gangtok, temperate, deciduous forests of poplar, birch, oak and elm, as well as evergreen, coniferous trees of the wet alpine zone. Orchids are common and rare varieties of orchids are featured in flower shows in the city. Bamboo is also abundant. In the lower reaches of the town, the vegetation gradually changes from alpine to temperate deciduous and subtropical. Flowers such as sunflower, marigold, poinsettia and others bloom, especially in November and December.

=== Climate ===

Gangtok has a monsoon-influenced subtropical highland climate (Köppen: &quot;Cwb&quot;). Because of its elevation and sheltered environment, Gangtok enjoys a mild, temperate climate all year round. Like most Himalayan towns, Gangtok has five seasons: summer, monsoons, autumn, winter and spring. Temperatures range from an average maximum of in summertime to an average minimum of in winter. Summers (lasting from late April to May) are mild, with maximum temperatures rarely crossing . The monsoon season from June to September is characterised by intense torrential rains, often causing landslides that block Gangtok&#x27;s land access to the rest of the country. Rainfall starts to rise from pre-monsoon in May and peaks during the monsoon, with July recording the highest monthly average of . In winter temperature averages between and . Snowfall is rare and in recent times, Gangtok has received snow only in 1990, 2004, 2005 and 2020. Temperatures below freezing are also rare. During this season the weather can be unstable and change abruptly from bright sunshine and clear skies to heavy rain within a couple of hours. During spring and autumn the weather is generally sunny and mild. Owing to its elevation, Gangtok is often enveloped in fog during the monsoon and winter months.
== Economy ==
Gangtok is the main base for Sikkim tourism. Summer and spring seasons are the most popular tourist seasons. Many of Gangtok&#x27;s residents are employed directly and indirectly in the tourism industry, with many residents owning and working in hotels and restaurants.

Mahatma Gandhi Marg and Lal Market are prominent business areas and tourist spots in Gangtok.

Ecotourism has emerged as an important economic activity in the region which includes trekking, mountaineering, river rafting and other nature oriented activities. An estimated 351,000 tourists visited Sikkim in 2007, generating revenue of about .

The Nathula Pass, located about from Gangtok, used to be the primary route of the wool, fur and spice trade with Tibet and spurred economic growth for Gangtok till the mid-20th century. In 1962, after the border was closed during the Sino-Indian War, Gangtok fell into recession. The pass was reopened in 2006 and trade through the pass has helped to boost the economy of Gangtok. Back in 2008 the Sikkim government stated that it was keen to open a Lhasa–Gangtok bus service via the Nathula Pass though 15 years later no such service has materialised. Sikkim&#x27;s mountainous terrain limits the area&#x27;s potential for rapid industrial development. The government is the largest employer in the city, both directly and as conttractors.

Gangtok&#x27;s economy does not have a large manufacturing base, but has a thriving Cottage industry in watch-making, country-made alcohol and handicrafts. Among the handicrafts are the handmade paper industry made from various vegetable fibres or cotton rags. The main market in Gangtok provides many of the state&#x27;s rural residents a place to offer their produce during the harvest seasons. The majority of the private business community is made up of Marwaris and Biharis. As part of Sikkim, Gangtok enjoys the status of being an income-tax free region as per the state&#x27;s 1948 Income tax law. As Sikkim is a frontier state, the Indian army maintains a large presence in the vicinity of Gangtok. This leads to a population of semi-permanent residents who bring money into the local economy. The Sikkim government started India&#x27;s first online lottery &quot;Playwin&quot; to boost government income, but this was later closed by a ruling from the Sikkim High Court.

Agriculture is a large employer in Sikkim and in 2003 the Sikkim state government declared the goal of converting the whole sector to organic production. The goal of 100% organic was achieved in 2016. This achievement offers new export opportunities to grow the agriculture sector, to achieve premium prices and new opportunities for agritourism.

== Civic administration ==

Gangtok is administered by the Gangtok Municipal Corporation (GMC) along with the various departments of the Government of Sikkim, particularly the Urban Development and Housing Department (UDHD) and the Public Health Engineering Department (PHED). These departments provide municipal functions such as garbage disposal, water supply, tax collection, licence allotments, and civic infrastructure. An administrator appointed by the state government heads the UDHD.

As the headquarters of East Sikkim district, Gangtok houses the offices of the district collector, an administrator appointed by the Union Government of India. Gangtok is also the seat of the Sikkim High Court, which is India&#x27;s smallest High Court in terms of area and population of jurisdiction. Gangtok does not have its own police commissionerate like other major cities in India. Instead, it comes under the jurisdiction of the state police, which is headed by a Director General of Police, although an Inspector General of Police oversees the town. Sikkim is known for its very low crime rate. Rongyek jail in Gangtok is Sikkim&#x27;s only central jail.

Gangtok is within the Sikkim Lok Sabha constituency that elects a member to the Lok Sabha (Lower House) of the Indian Parliament. The city elects one member in the Sikkim state legislative assembly, the Vidhan Sabha. The Sikkim Democratic Front (SDF) won both the parliamentary election in 2009 and the state assembly seat in the 2009 state assembly polls.

== Utility services ==
Electricity is supplied by the power department of the Government of Sikkim. Gangtok has a nearly uninterrupted electricity supply due to Sikkim&#x27;s numerous hydroelectric power stations. The rural roads around Gangtok are maintained by the Border Roads Organisation, a division of the Indian army. Several roads in Gangtok are reported to be in a poor condition, whereas building construction activities continue almost unrestrained in this city lacking proper land infrastructure. Most households are supplied by the central water system maintained and operated by the PHED. The main source of PHED water supply is the Rateychu River, located about from the city, at an altitude of . Its water treatment plant is located at Selep. The river Rateychu is snow-fed and has perennial streams. Since there is no habitation in the catchment area except for a small army settlement, there is little environmental degradation and the water is of very good quality. 40 seasonal local springs are used by the Rural Management and Development Department of Sikkim Government to supply water to outlying rural areas.

Around 40% of the population has access to sewers. However, only the toilet waste is connected to the sewer while sullage is discharged into the drains. Without a proper sanitation system, the practice of disposing sewage through septic tanks and directly discharging into &quot;Jhora&quot;s and open drains is prevalent. The entire city drains into the two rivers, Ranikhola and Roro Chu, through numerous small streams and Jhoras. Ranikhola and Roro Chu rivers confluence with Teesta River, the major source of drinking water to the population downstream. The densely populated urban area of Gangtok does not have a combined drainage system to drain out the stormwater and wastewater from the buildings. The estimated solid waste generated in Gangtok city is approximately 45 tonnes. Only around 40% of this is collected by UDHD, while the remainder is indiscriminately thrown into &quot;Jhora&quot;, streets and valleys. The collected waste is disposed in a dump located about from the city. There is no waste collection from inaccessible areas where vehicles cannot reach, nor does any system of collection of waste exist in the adjoining rural areas. The city is under a statewide ban on the use of polythene bags.

== Transport ==
=== Road ===
Taxis are the most widely available public transport within Gangtok. Most of the residents stay within a few kilometres of the town centre and many have their own vehicles such as two-wheelers and cars. The share of personal vehicles and taxis combined is 98% of Gangtok&#x27;s total vehicles, a high percentage when compared to other Indian cities. City buses constitute less than one per cent of vehicles. Those travelling longer distances generally make use of share-jeeps, a kind of public taxis. Four wheel drives are used to easily navigate the steep slopes of the roads. The long cable car with three stops connects lower Gangtok suburbs with Sikkim Legislative assembly in central Gangtok and the upper suburbs.

Gangtok is connected to the rest of India by an all-weather metalled highway, National Highway 10 (NH10), earlier known as National Highway 31A, which links Gangtok to Siliguri, located away in the neighbouring state of West Bengal. The highway also provides a link to the neighbouring hill station towns of Darjeeling and Kalimpong, which are the nearest urban areas. Regular jeep, van and bus services link these towns to Gangtok. Gangtok is a linear city that has developed along the arterial roads, especially National Highway 31A. Most of the road length in Gangtok is of two lane undivided carriageway with footpath on one side of the road and drain on the other. The steep gradient of the different road stretches coupled with a spiral road configuration constrain the smooth flow of vehicular as well as pedestrian traffic.

Another railway station near Gangtok is Siliguri Junction (station code - SGUJ). There are quite many trains that connect Siliguri Junction with Sealdah railway station in Kolkata and others parts of north-east India.

<text>Tagalog Republic (; ) is a term used to refer to two revolutionary governments involved in the Philippine Revolution against the Spanish Empire and the Philippine–American War. Both were connected to the &quot;Katipunan&quot; revolutionary movement.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;Tagalog&quot; commonly refers to both an ethno-linguistic group in the Philippines and their language. &quot;Katagalugan&quot; often refers to the Tagalog-speaking regions of the island of Luzon in the Philippine archipelago.

However, the &quot;Katipunan&quot; secret society extended the meaning of these terms to all of the natives in the Philippine islands. The society&#x27;s primer explains its use of &quot;Tagalog&quot; in a footnote:
The revolutionary Carlos Ronquillo wrote in his memoirs:

In this respect, &quot;Katagalugan&quot; may be translated as the &quot;Tagalog nation.&quot;

Andrés Bonifacio, a founding member of the &quot;Katipunan&quot; and later its supreme head (&quot;Supremo&quot;), promoted the use of &quot;Katagalugan&quot; for the Philippine nation. The term &quot;Filipino&quot; was then reserved for Spaniards born in the islands. By eschewing &quot;Filipino&quot; and &quot;Filipinas&quot; which had colonial roots, Bonifacio and his cohorts &quot;sought to form a national identity.&quot;

In 1896, the Philippine Revolution broke out after the discovery of the &quot;Katipunan&quot; by the authorities. Prior to the outbreak of hostilities, the Katipunan had become an open revolutionary government. The American historian John R. M. Taylor, custodian of the &quot;Philippine Insurgent Records&quot;, wrote:

Several Filipino historians concur. According to Gregorio Zaide:

Likewise, Renato Constantino and others wrote that the &quot;Katipunan&quot; served as a shadow government.

Influenced by Freemasonry, the &quot;Katipunan&quot; had been organized with &quot;its own laws, bureaucratic structure and elective leadership&quot;. For each province it involved, the Supreme Council coordinated provincial councils which were in charge of &quot;public administration and military affairs on the supra-municipal or quasi-provincial level&quot; and local councils, in charge of affairs &quot;on the district or barrio level&quot;.

==Bonifacio==

In the last days of August 1896, &quot;Katipunan&quot; members met in Caloocan and decided to start their revolt (the event was later called the &quot;Cry of Balintawak&quot; or &quot;Cry of Pugad Lawin&quot;; the exact location and date are disputed). A day after the Cry, the Supreme Council of the Katipunan held elections, with the following results:

The above was divulged to the Spanish by the &quot;Katipunan&quot; member Pío Valenzuela while in captivity. Teodoro Agoncillo thus wrote:

Milagros C. Guerrero and others have described Bonifacio as &quot;effectively&quot; the commander-in-chief of the revolutionaries. They assert:

One name for Bonifacio&#x27;s concept of the Philippine nation-state appears in surviving &quot;Katipunan&quot; documents: &quot;Haring Bayang Katagalugan&quot; (&quot;Sovereign Nation of the Tagalog People&quot;, or &quot;Sovereign Tagalog Nation&quot;) - sometimes shortened into &quot;Haring Bayan&quot; (&quot;Sovereign Nation&quot;). &quot;Bayan&quot; may be rendered as &quot;nation&quot; or &quot;people&quot;. The term &quot;haring bayan&quot; (sometimes &quot;haringbayan&quot;) was Bonifacio&#x27;s neologism which sought to express and adapt in native terms the Western concept of &quot;republic&quot;, from Latin &quot;res publica&quot;, meaning public thing or commonwealth. Since &quot;haring bayan&quot; means both &quot;sovereign nation&quot; and &quot;sovereign people&quot;, where sovereign power is held by the nation/people, his concept was essentially democratic and republican in nature.
Thus Bonifacio is named as the president of the &quot;Tagalog Republic&quot; in an issue of the Spanish periodical &quot;La Ilustración Española y Americana&quot; published in February 1897 (&quot;&quot;Andrés Bonifacio - Titulado &quot;Presidente&quot; de la República Tagala&quot;&quot;). Another name for Bonifacio&#x27;s government was &quot;Repúblika ng Katagalugan&quot; (another form of &quot;Tagalog Republic&quot;) as evidenced by a picture of a rebel seal published in the same periodical the next month.

Official letters and one appointment paper of Bonifacio addressed to Emilio Jacinto reveal Bonifacio&#x27;s various titles and designations, as follows:

* President of the Supreme Council
* Supreme President
* President of the Sovereign Nation of Katagalugan / Sovereign Tagalog Nation
* President of the Sovereign Nation, Founder of the Katipunan, Initiator of the Revolution
* Office of the Supreme President, Government of the Revolution

An 1897 power struggle at the Imus Assembly in Cavite led to command of the revolution shifting at the Tejeros Convention, where a new insurgent government was formed with Emilio Aguinaldo as president. Bonifacio refused to recognize the new government after his election as Director of the Interior was questioned by Daniel Tirona. This led to the Acta de Tejeros, the Naic Military Agreement and Bonifacio&#x27;s trial and execution.

==Sakay==
After Emilio Aguinaldo and his men were captured by the US forces in 1901, General Macario Sakay, a veteran &quot;Katipunan&quot; member, re-established in 1902 the Tagalog Republic (, or &quot;Republika ng Kapuluang Katagalugan&quot;, &quot;kapuluan&quot; referring to the entire Philippine archipelago, as in &quot;Philippine Islands&quot; or &quot;Islas Filipinas&quot;) as a continuation of Bonifacio&#x27;s Katipunan government in contrast to Aguinaldo&#x27;s Republic. Sakay was based in the mountains of Morong (today, the province of Rizal), and held the presidency with Francisco Carreón as vice president. In April 1904, Sakay issued a manifesto declaring Filipino right to self-determination at a time when support for independence was considered a crime by the American colonial government.
The republic ended in 1906 when Sakay and his leading followers surrendered on July 14 to the American authorities upon being promised amnesty and being convinced of the need for a Philippine Assembly as a peaceful &quot;gate to liberty&quot;. Instead they were arrested days later at a welcoming reception party in Cavite, imprisoned at the Old Bilibid Prison in Manila, and the following year executed for banditry. Some of its survivors escaped to Japan to be joined with Artemio Ricarte, an exiled Katipunan veteran, who later returned to support the Second Philippine Republic, a client state of Japan, during World War II.

<text>Tottenham Green was an electoral ward within the London Borough of Haringey in Greater London, England from 2002 to 2022.

According to the 2001 Census, the population of Tottenham Green was around 12,000, in around 5,500 homes. Around 2,900 homes did not own a car. Just under 2,000 of the population were Muslims. The population at the 2011 Census increased to 14,580 in 5,925 homes.

Those living in the ward had a life expectancy seven years less than someone living in nearby Highgate; the area has a significant and entrenched problem with guns, drugs, arson, burglaries and anti-social behaviour. The high rate of violent and petty crime in Tottenham Green has remained fairly stable over the past six years. (Source: &quot;Key Findings of the 2004 Crime &amp; Drugs Audit Report&quot;, Haringey Council).

The area has a large new sports and leisure centre, and good transport connections.

The Government&#x27;s &quot;Indices of Deprivation&quot; (2004) reported Tottenham Green to be among the top 20 per cent of deprived areas in England. Despite the high levels of poverty, Council Tax is said to be among the highest in the UK. The area is a Labour Party stronghold.

<text>Vernon Decatur Stephens (October 23, 1920 – November 4, 1968) was an American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a shortstop from through . An eight-time All-Star, Stephens was notable for being the American League home run champion and was a three-time American League RBI champion. He was the cleanup hitter for the only St. Louis Browns team to win an American League pennant in , and was a top power hitter for the Boston Red Sox. Nicknamed &quot;Little Slug&quot;, &quot;Junior&quot;, and &quot;Buster&quot;, Stephens batted and threw right-handed. He was inducted into the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2006.

==Baseball career==

Stephens was born in McAlister, New Mexico while his parents were en route from Oklahoma to California. He attended Long Beach Polytechnic High School in Long Beach, California.

One of the strongest-hitting shortstops in major league history, Stephens compiled a .286 batting average with 247 home runs and 1,174 RBI in 1,720 games. In 1944, Stephens led the American League with 109 runs batted in as he led the Browns to their first and only World Series appearance in St. Louis. He also led the league with 24 home runs in 1945.

Amid a salary dispute with the Browns, Stephens signed a five-year contract with the Azules de Veracruz of the Mexican League in 1946. He played in two games for Veracruz, with one single in eight at bats, before deciding to return to the United States; his father, a minor league umpire, and the Browns scout Jack Fournier drove down and brought him across the border. Stephens&#x27; departure infuriated Mexican League president (and Azules owner) Jorge Pasquel, but it saved him from the five-year suspension that Commissioner of Baseball Happy Chandler levied on the other major leaguers who &quot;jumped&quot; to Mexico.

After the 1947 season, he was traded along with Jack Kramer to the Boston Red Sox, but later, after a brief stint with the Chicago White Sox, returned to the Browns in 1953, their last season in St. Louis. Stephens was the only member of the pennant-winning 1944 St. Louis Browns who played with the Baltimore Orioles when the Browns moved to Baltimore in 1954.

Stephens played five years with the Boston Red Sox from 1948 to 1952. Ted Williams said that he was the most effective of those who followed him in the batting order. In 1949, he batted in 159 runs (tied with Williams for the league lead) and hit 39 home runs, second only to Williams&#x27;s 43. No other player in the American League had more than 24. Second baseman Bobby Doerr, who was lionized in David Halberstam&#x27;s book &quot;Summer of &#x27;49&quot;, hit 18 home runs. 

In August 2008, he was named as one of the ten former players who began their careers before 1943 to be considered by the Veterans Committee for induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in 2009. He was not selected.

==Death==
Vern Stephens died on November 4, 1968 of a heart attack in Long Beach, California at 48 years of age.
