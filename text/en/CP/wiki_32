<text>Princess Amelia Sophia Eleonore of Great Britain (10 June 1711 (New Style) – 31 October 1786) was the second daughter of King George II of Great Britain and Queen Caroline. Born in Hanover, she moved to England when her grandfather George I became king. Amelia lived a solitary existence and died in 1786, the last surviving child of her parents.

==Early life==
Princess Amelia was born at Herrenhausen Palace, Hanover, Germany, on 30 May 1711 (Old Style). At the time of her birth, her father was Hereditary Prince of Brunswick-Lüneburg, son and heir of the Elector of Hanover. Her mother was Caroline of Ansbach, daughter of Johann Friedrich, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach. She was known to her family as Emily.

==Great Britain==
On 1 August 1714, Queen Anne of Great Britain and Ireland died. Princess Amelia&#x27;s grandfather succeeded her to become George I of Great Britain, in accordance with the provisions of the Act of Settlement 1701. Amelia&#x27;s father, now heir apparent to the throne of Great Britain, was made Duke of Cornwall and created Prince of Wales on 27 September 1714. She moved to Great Britain with her family and they took up residence at St James&#x27;s Palace in London.

Though comparatively healthy as an adult, Amelia was a sickly child and her mother employed Johann Georg Steigerthal and Hans Sloane to treat her, as well as secretly asking the physician John Freind for advice. In 1722 her mother, who had progressive ideas, had Amelia and her sister Caroline inoculated against smallpox by an early type of immunisation known as variolation, which had been brought to England from Constantinople by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu and Charles Maitland. On 11 June 1727, George I died and her father succeeded him as George II. She lived with her father until his death in 1760.

Amelia&#x27;s aunt Sophia Dorothea, Queen of Prussia, suggested Amelia as a suitable wife for her son Frederick (later known as Frederick the Great). Correspondence, planning and negotiations dragged on for years from 1723, accompanied by numerous intrigues and diplomatic interventions by Austria, but his father Frederick William I of Prussia finally backed away from the plan in 1732 and forced his son to marry Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Bevern instead. In 1724 Amelia and her sister the Princess Royal were among the final four candidates for marriage to Louis XV of France. However, as this required her to convert to Catholicism, her father prevented the match.

Amelia greatly enjoyed riding and hunting. She was disliked by artistic fops such as Lord Hervey, and Lady Pomfret considered her &quot;one of the oddest princesses that ever was known; she has ears shut to flattery and her heart open to honesty.&quot;

Lady Isabella Finch became her Lady of the Bedchamber in 1738 or thereabouts.

Amelia may have been the mother of the composer Samuel Arnold (1740–1802) through an affair with a commoner of the name Thomas Arnold.

==Later life==
In 1751, Princess Amelia became ranger of Richmond Park after the death of Robert Walpole, 2nd Earl of Orford. Immediately afterwards, the Princess caused major public uproar by closing the park to the public, only allowing few close friends and those with special permits to enter.

This continued until 1758, when a local brewer, John Lewis, took the gatekeeper, who stopped him from entering the park, to court. The court ruled in favour of Lewis, citing the fact that, when Charles I enclosed the park in the 17th century, he allowed the public right of way in the park. Princess Amelia was forced to lift the restrictions.

The Princess was generous in her gifts to charitable organisations. In 1760 she donated £100 to the society for educating poor orphans of clergymen (later the Clergy Orphan Corporation) to help pay for a school for 21 orphan daughters of clergymen of the Church of England. In 1783 she agreed to become an annual subscriber of £25 to the new County Infirmary in Northampton.

In 1761, Princess Amelia became the owner of Gunnersbury Estate, Middlesex, purchased from the estate of Henry Furnese. Princess Amelia used Gunnersbury as her summer residence. She added a chapel and at some time between 1777 and 1784 she commissioned a bath house, extended as a folly by a subsequent owner of the land in the 19th century, which still stands today with a Grade II English Heritage listing and is known as Princess Amelia&#x27;s Bathhouse.

She also owned a property in Cavendish Square, Soho, London, where she died unmarried on 31 October 1786, at which time she was the last surviving child of King George II and Queen Caroline. A miniature of her first cousin, Frederick the Great, was found on her body. The great king originally intended for her had died two months earlier. She was buried in the Henry VII Lady Chapel in Westminster Abbey.

==Legacy==

Amelia Island in Florida, in the United States, is named for her, as is Amelia County in Virginia.

==Arms==
On 31 January 1719, as a grandchild of the sovereign, Amelia was granted use of the arms of the realm, differenced by a &quot;label argent of five points ermine&quot;. On 30 August 1727, as a child of the sovereign, Amelia&#x27;s difference changed to a &quot;label argent of three points ermine&quot;.

<doc id="1326660" wikidata="Q360655" url="?curid=1326660" title="Mohr's circle">
<text>Mohr&#x27;s circle is a two-dimensional graphical representation of the transformation law for the Cauchy stress tensor.

Mohr&#x27;s circle is often used in calculations relating to mechanical engineering for materials&#x27; strength, geotechnical engineering for strength of soils, and structural engineering for strength of built structures. It is also used for calculating stresses in many planes by reducing them to vertical and horizontal components. These are called principal planes in which principal stresses are calculated; Mohr&#x27;s circle can also be used to find the principal planes and the principal stresses in a graphical representation, and is one of the easiest ways to do so.

After performing a stress analysis on a material body assumed as a continuum, the components of the Cauchy stress tensor at a particular material point are known with respect to a coordinate system. The Mohr circle is then used to determine graphically the stress components acting on a rotated coordinate system, i.e., acting on a differently oriented plane passing through that point.

The abscissa and ordinate (formula_1,formula_2) of each point on the circle are the magnitudes of the normal stress and shear stress components, respectively, acting on the rotated coordinate system. In other words, the circle is the locus of points that represent the state of stress on individual planes at all their orientations, where the axes represent the principal axes of the stress element.

19th-century German engineer Karl Culmann was the first to conceive a graphical representation for stresses while considering longitudinal and vertical stresses in horizontal beams during bending. His work inspired fellow German engineer Christian Otto Mohr (the circle&#x27;s namesake), who extended it to both two- and three-dimensional stresses and developed a failure criterion based on the stress circle.

Alternative graphical methods for the representation of the stress state at a point include the Lamé&#x27;s stress ellipsoid and Cauchy&#x27;s stress quadric.

The Mohr circle can be applied to any symmetric 2x2 tensor matrix, including the strain and moment of inertia tensors.

==Motivation==

Internal forces are produced between the particles of a deformable object, assumed as a continuum, as a reaction to applied external forces, i.e., either surface forces or body forces. This reaction follows from Euler&#x27;s laws of motion for a continuum, which are equivalent to Newton&#x27;s laws of motion for a particle. A measure of the intensity of these internal forces is called stress. Because the object is assumed as a continuum, these internal forces are distributed continuously within the volume of the object.

In engineering, e.g., structural, mechanical, or geotechnical, the stress distribution within an object, for instance stresses in a rock mass around a tunnel, airplane wings, or building columns, is determined through a stress analysis. Calculating the stress distribution implies the determination of stresses at every point (material particle) in the object. According to Cauchy, the &quot;stress at any point&quot; in an object (Figure 2), assumed as a continuum, is completely defined by the nine stress components formula_3 of a second order tensor of type (2,0) known as the Cauchy stress tensor, formula_4:

:formula_5

After the stress distribution within the object has been determined with respect to a coordinate system formula_6, it may be necessary to calculate the components of the stress tensor at a particular material point formula_7 with respect to a rotated coordinate system formula_8, i.e., the stresses acting on a plane with a different orientation passing through that point of interest —forming an angle with the coordinate system formula_6 (Figure 3). For example, it is of interest to find the maximum normal stress and maximum shear stress, as well as the orientation of the planes where they act upon. To achieve this, it is necessary to perform a tensor transformation under a rotation of the coordinate system. From the definition of tensor, the Cauchy stress tensor obeys the tensor transformation law. A graphical representation of this transformation law for the Cauchy stress tensor is the Mohr circle for stress.

== Mohr&#x27;s circle for two-dimensional state of stress==
In two dimensions, the stress tensor at a given material point formula_7 with respect to any two perpendicular directions is completely defined by only three stress components. For the particular coordinate system formula_6 these stress components are: the normal stresses formula_12 and formula_13, and the shear stress formula_14. From the balance of angular momentum, the symmetry of the Cauchy stress tensor can be demonstrated. This symmetry implies that formula_15. Thus, the Cauchy stress tensor can be written as:

:formula_16

The objective is to use the Mohr circle to find the stress components formula_1 and formula_2 on a rotated coordinate system formula_8, i.e., on a differently oriented plane passing through formula_7 and perpendicular to the formula_21-formula_22 plane (Figure 4). The rotated coordinate system formula_8 makes an angle formula_24 with the original coordinate system formula_6.

===Equation of the Mohr circle===
To derive the equation of the Mohr circle for the two-dimensional cases of plane stress and plane strain, first consider a two-dimensional infinitesimal material element around a material point formula_7 (Figure 4), with a unit area in the direction parallel to the formula_22-formula_28 plane, i.e., perpendicular to the page or screen.

From equilibrium of forces on the infinitesimal element, the magnitudes of the normal stress formula_1 and the shear stress formula_2 are given by:

:formula_31

:formula_32

Both equations can also be obtained by applying the tensor transformation law on the known Cauchy stress tensor, which is equivalent to performing the static equilibrium of forces in the direction of formula_1 and formula_2.

These two equations are the parametric equations of the Mohr circle. In these equations, formula_35 is the parameter, and formula_1 and formula_2 are the coordinates. This means that by choosing a coordinate system with abscissa formula_1 and ordinate formula_2, giving values to the parameter formula_24 will place the points obtained lying on a circle.

Eliminating the parameter formula_35 from these parametric equations will yield the non-parametric equation of the Mohr circle. This can be achieved by rearranging the equations for formula_1 and formula_2, first transposing the first term in the first equation and squaring both sides of each of the equations then adding them. Thus we have

:formula_44

where
:formula_45

This is the equation of a circle (the Mohr circle) of the form
:formula_46

with radius formula_47 centered at a point with coordinates formula_48 in the formula_49 coordinate system.

=== Sign conventions ===
There are two separate sets of sign conventions that need to be considered when using the Mohr Circle: One sign convention for stress components in the &quot;physical space&quot;, and another for stress components in the &quot;Mohr-Circle-space&quot;. In addition, within each of the two set of sign conventions, the engineering mechanics (structural engineering and mechanical engineering) literature follows a different sign convention from the geomechanics literature. There is no standard sign convention, and the choice of a particular sign convention is influenced by convenience for calculation and interpretation for the particular problem in hand. A more detailed explanation of these sign conventions is presented below.

The previous derivation for the equation of the Mohr Circle using Figure 4 follows the engineering mechanics sign convention. The engineering mechanics sign convention will be used for this article.

==== Physical-space sign convention ====
From the convention of the Cauchy stress tensor (Figure 3 and Figure 4), the first subscript in the stress components denotes the face on which the stress component acts, and the second subscript indicates the direction of the stress component. Thus formula_14 is the shear stress acting on the face with normal vector in the positive direction of the formula_21-axis, and in the positive direction of the formula_22-axis.

In the physical-space sign convention, positive normal stresses are outward to the plane of action (tension), and negative normal stresses are inward to the plane of action (compression) (Figure 5).

In the physical-space sign convention, positive shear stresses act on positive faces of the material element in the positive direction of an axis. Also, positive shear stresses act on negative faces of the material element in the negative direction of an axis. A positive face has its normal vector in the positive direction of an axis, and a negative face has its normal vector in the negative direction of an axis. For example, the shear stresses formula_14 and formula_54 are positive because they act on positive faces, and they act as well in the positive direction of the formula_22-axis and the formula_21-axis, respectively (Figure 3). Similarly, the respective opposite shear stresses formula_14 and formula_54 acting in the negative faces have a negative sign because they act in the negative direction of the formula_21-axis and formula_22-axis, respectively.

==== Mohr-circle-space sign convention ====

In the Mohr-circle-space sign convention, normal stresses have the same sign as normal stresses in the physical-space sign convention: positive normal stresses act outward to the plane of action, and negative normal stresses act inward to the plane of action.

Shear stresses, however, have a different convention in the Mohr-circle space compared to the convention in the physical space. In the Mohr-circle-space sign convention, positive shear stresses rotate the material element in the counterclockwise direction, and negative shear stresses rotate the material in the clockwise direction. This way, the shear stress component formula_14 is positive in the Mohr-circle space, and the shear stress component formula_54 is negative in the Mohr-circle space.

Two options exist for drawing the Mohr-circle space, which produce a mathematically correct Mohr circle:

# Positive shear stresses are plotted upward (Figure 5, sign convention #1)
# Positive shear stresses are plotted downward, i.e., the formula_63-axis is inverted (Figure 5, sign convention #2).

Plotting positive shear stresses upward makes the angle formula_35 on the Mohr circle have a positive rotation clockwise, which is opposite to the physical space convention. That is why some authors prefer plotting positive shear stresses downward, which makes the angle formula_35 on the Mohr circle have a positive rotation counterclockwise, similar to the physical space convention for shear stresses.

To overcome the &quot;issue&quot; of having the shear stress axis downward in the Mohr-circle space, there is an &quot;alternative&quot; sign convention where positive shear stresses are assumed to rotate the material element in the clockwise direction and negative shear stresses are assumed to rotate the material element in the counterclockwise direction (Figure 5, option 3). This way, positive shear stresses are plotted upward in the Mohr-circle space and the angle formula_35 has a positive rotation counterclockwise in the Mohr-circle space. This &quot;alternative&quot; sign convention produces a circle that is identical to the sign convention #2 in Figure 5 because a positive shear stress formula_63 is also a counterclockwise shear stress, and both are plotted downward. Also, a negative shear stress formula_63 is a clockwise shear stress, and both are plotted upward.

This article follows the engineering mechanics sign convention for the physical space and the &quot;alternative&quot; sign convention for the Mohr-circle space (sign convention #3 in Figure 5)

=== Drawing Mohr&#x27;s circle ===
Assuming we know the stress components formula_12, formula_13, and formula_14 at a point formula_7 in the object under study, as shown in Figure 4, the following are the steps to construct the Mohr circle for the state of stresses at formula_7:

# Draw the Cartesian coordinate system formula_49 with a horizontal formula_1-axis and a vertical formula_2-axis.
# Plot two points formula_77 and formula_78 in the formula_49 space corresponding to the known stress components on both perpendicular planes formula_80 and formula_81, respectively (Figure 4 and 6), following the chosen sign convention.
# Draw the diameter of the circle by joining points formula_80 and formula_81 with a straight line formula_84.
# Draw the Mohr Circle. The centre formula_85 of the circle is the midpoint of the diameter line formula_84, which corresponds to the intersection of this line with the formula_1 axis.

=== Finding principal normal stresses ===
The magnitude of the principal stresses are the abscissas of the points formula_88 and formula_89 (Figure 6) where the circle intersects the formula_90-axis. The magnitude of the major principal stress formula_91 is always the greatest absolute value of the abscissa of any of these two points. Likewise, the magnitude of the minor principal stress formula_92 is always the lowest absolute value of the abscissa of these two points. As expected, the ordinates of these two points are zero, corresponding to the magnitude of the shear stress components on the principal planes. Alternatively, the values of the principal stresses can be found by

:formula_93
:formula_94

where the magnitude of the average normal stress formula_95 is the abscissa of the centre formula_85, given by
:formula_97

and the length of the radius formula_98 of the circle (based on the equation of a circle passing through two points), is given by
:formula_99

=== Finding maximum and minimum shear stresses ===
The maximum and minimum shear stresses correspond to the ordinates of the highest and lowest points on the circle, respectively. These points are located at the intersection of the circle with the vertical line passing through the center of the circle, formula_85. Thus, the magnitude of the maximum and minimum shear stresses are equal to the value of the circle&#x27;s radius formula_98
:formula_102

=== Finding stress components on an arbitrary plane ===
As mentioned before, after the two-dimensional stress analysis has been performed we know the stress components formula_12, formula_13, and formula_14 at a material point formula_7. These stress components act in two perpendicular planes formula_107 and formula_81 passing through formula_7 as shown in Figure 5 and 6. The Mohr circle is used to find the stress components formula_1 and formula_2, i.e., coordinates of any point formula_112 on the circle, acting on any other plane formula_112 passing through formula_7 making an angle formula_24 with the plane formula_81. For this, two approaches can be used: the double angle, and the Pole or origin of planes.

==== Double angle ====
As shown in Figure 6, to determine the stress components formula_117 acting on a plane formula_112 at an angle formula_24 counterclockwise to the plane formula_81 on which formula_12 acts, we travel an angle formula_35 in the same counterclockwise direction around the circle from the known stress point formula_78 to point formula_124, i.e., an angle formula_35 between lines formula_126 and formula_127 in the Mohr circle.

The double angle approach relies on the fact that the angle formula_24 between the normal vectors to any two physical planes passing through formula_7 (Figure 4) is half the angle between two lines joining their corresponding stress points formula_117 on the Mohr circle and the centre of the circle.

This double angle relation comes from the fact that the parametric equations for the Mohr circle are a function of formula_35. It can also be seen that the planes formula_80 and formula_81 in the material element around formula_7 of Figure 5 are separated by an angle formula_135, which in the Mohr circle is represented by a formula_136 angle (double the angle).

==== Pole or origin of planes ====

The second approach involves the determination of a point on the Mohr circle called the &quot;pole&quot; or the &quot;origin of planes&quot;. Any straight line drawn from the pole will intersect the Mohr circle at a point that represents the state of stress on a plane inclined at the same orientation (parallel) in space as that line. Therefore, knowing the stress components formula_137 and formula_138 on any particular plane, one can draw a line parallel to that plane through the particular coordinates formula_1 and formula_2 on the Mohr circle and find the pole as the intersection of such line with the Mohr circle. As an example, let&#x27;s assume we have a state of stress with stress components formula_141, formula_142, and formula_143, as shown on Figure 7. First, we can draw a line from point formula_81 parallel to the plane of action of formula_12, or, if we choose otherwise, a line from point formula_80 parallel to the plane of action of formula_13. The intersection of any of these two lines with the Mohr circle is the pole. Once the pole has been determined, to find the state of stress on a plane making an angle formula_148 with the vertical, or in other words a plane having its normal vector forming an angle formula_24 with the horizontal plane, then we can draw a line from the pole parallel to that plane (See Figure 7). The normal and shear stresses on that plane are then the coordinates of the point of intersection between the line and the Mohr circle.

=== Finding the orientation of the principal planes ===
The orientation of the planes where the maximum and minimum principal stresses act, also known as &quot;principal planes&quot;, can be determined by measuring in the Mohr circle the angles ∠BOC and ∠BOE, respectively, and taking half of each of those angles. Thus, the angle ∠BOC between formula_150 and formula_151 is double the angle formula_152 which the major principal plane makes with plane formula_81.

Angles formula_154 and formula_155 can also be found from the following equation

:formula_156

This equation defines two values for formula_157 which are formula_158 apart (Figure). This equation can be derived directly from the geometry of the circle, or by making the parametric equation of the circle for formula_63 equal to zero (the shear stress in the principal planes is always zero).

=== Example ===

Assume a material element under a state of stress as shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9, with the plane of one of its sides oriented 10° with respect to the horizontal plane.
Using the Mohr circle, find:

* The orientation of their planes of action.
* The maximum shear stresses and orientation of their planes of action.
* The stress components on a horizontal plane.

Check the answers using the stress transformation formulas or the stress transformation law.

Solution:
Following the engineering mechanics sign convention for the physical space (Figure 5), the stress components for the material element in this example are:
:formula_160

:formula_161

:formula_162.
Following the steps for drawing the Mohr circle for this particular state of stress, we first draw a Cartesian coordinate system formula_49 with the formula_2-axis upward.

We then plot two points A(50,40) and B(-10,-40), representing the state of stress at plane A and B as show in both Figure 8 and Figure 9. These points follow the engineering mechanics sign convention for the Mohr-circle space (Figure 5), which assumes positive normals stresses outward from the material element, and positive shear stresses on each plane rotating the material element clockwise. This way, the shear stress acting on plane B is negative and the shear stress acting on plane A is positive.
The diameter of the circle is the line joining point A and B. The centre of the circle is the intersection of this line with the formula_1-axis. Knowing both the location of the centre and length of the diameter, we are able to plot the Mohr circle for this particular state of stress.

The abscissas of both points E and C (Figure 8 and Figure 9) intersecting the formula_1-axis are the magnitudes of the minimum and maximum normal stresses, respectively; the ordinates of both points E and C are the magnitudes of the shear stresses acting on both the minor and major principal planes, respectively, which is zero for principal planes.

Even though the idea for using the Mohr circle is to graphically find different stress components by actually measuring the coordinates for different points on the circle, it is more convenient to confirm the results analytically. Thus, the radius and the abscissa of the centre of the circle are

:formula_167

:formula_168

and the principal stresses are

:formula_169

:formula_170

The coordinates for both points H and G (Figure 8 and Figure 9) are the magnitudes of the minimum and maximum shear stresses, respectively; the abscissas for both points H and G are the magnitudes for the normal stresses acting on the same planes where the minimum and maximum shear stresses act, respectively.
The magnitudes of the minimum and maximum shear stresses can be found analytically by

:formula_171

and the normal stresses acting on the same planes where the minimum and maximum shear stresses act are equal to formula_172

We can choose to either use the double angle approach (Figure 8) or the Pole approach (Figure 9) to find the orientation of the principal normal stresses and principal shear stresses.

Using the double angle approach we measure the angles ∠BOC and ∠BOE in the Mohr Circle (Figure 8) to find double the angle the major principal stress and the minor principal stress make with plane B in the physical space. To obtain a more accurate value for these angles, instead of manually measuring the angles, we can use the analytical expression

:formula_173

One solution is: formula_174.
From inspection of Figure 8, this value corresponds to the angle ∠BOE. Thus, the minor principal angle is

:formula_175

Then, the major principal angle is

:formula_176

Remember that in this particular example formula_154 and formula_155 are angles with respect to the plane of action of formula_179 (oriented in the formula_180-axis)and not angles with respect to the plane of action of formula_12 (oriented in the formula_21-axis).

Using the Pole approach, we first localize the Pole or origin of planes. For this, we draw through point A on the Mohr circle a line inclined 10° with the horizontal, or, in other words, a line parallel to plane A where formula_183 acts. The Pole is where this line intersects the Mohr circle (Figure 9). To confirm the location of the Pole, we could draw a line through point B on the Mohr circle parallel to the plane B where formula_179 acts. This line would also intersect the Mohr circle at the Pole (Figure 9).

From the Pole, we draw lines to different points on the Mohr circle. The coordinates of the points where these lines intersect the Mohr circle indicate the stress components acting on a plane in the physical space having the same inclination as the line. For instance, the line from the Pole to point C in the circle has the same inclination as the plane in the physical space where formula_91 acts. This plane makes an angle of 63.435° with plane B, both in the Mohr-circle space and in the physical space. In the same way, lines are traced from the Pole to points E, D, F, G and H to find the stress components on planes with the same orientation.

== Mohr&#x27;s circle for a general three-dimensional state of stresses ==

To construct the Mohr circle for a general three-dimensional case of stresses at a point, the values of the principal stresses formula_186 and their principal directions formula_187 must be first evaluated.

Considering the principal axes as the coordinate system, instead of the general formula_188, formula_189, formula_190 coordinate system, and assuming that formula_191, then the normal and shear components of the stress vector formula_192, for a given plane with unit vector formula_193, satisfy the following equations
:formula_194
:formula_195

Knowing that formula_196, we can solve for formula_197, formula_198, formula_199, using the Gauss elimination method which yields
:formula_200

Since formula_191, and formula_202 is non-negative, the numerators from these equations satisfy
:formula_203 as the denominator formula_204 and formula_205
:formula_206 as the denominator formula_207 and formula_208
:formula_209 as the denominator formula_210 and formula_211

These expressions can be rewritten as
:formula_212

which are the equations of the three Mohr&#x27;s circles for stress formula_213, formula_214, and formula_215, with radii formula_216, formula_217, and formula_218, and their centres with coordinates formula_219, formula_220, formula_221, respectively.

These equations for the Mohr circles show that all admissible stress points formula_117 lie on these circles or within the shaded area enclosed by them (see Figure 10). Stress points formula_117 satisfying the equation for circle formula_213 lie on, or outside circle formula_213. Stress points formula_117 satisfying the equation for circle formula_214 lie on, or inside circle formula_214. And finally, stress points formula_117 satisfying the equation for circle formula_215 lie on, or outside circle formula_215.

<text>James Noble (December 16, 1785 – February 26, 1831) was the first U.S. Senator from the U.S. state of Indiana.

Noble was born in Clarke County, Virginia near Berryville, and moved with his parents to Campbell County, Kentucky, when he was 10. There he studied law and he became an attorney, after which he moved to Indiana and settled in Brookville around 1808.

Once settled in Indiana he became a ferryboat operator, a judge and a member of the state&#x27;s first constitutional convention, in 1816, as a delegate from Franklin County.

He was elected to the first session of the Indiana State House of Representatives in 1816.

He was elected as a Crawford faction Democratic Republican (later an anti-Jacksonian Democrat) to the United States Senate in 1816. He was reelected to two more terms and served from December 11, 1816, until his death in 1831.

While in the Senate he was chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Pensions for the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th and 20th Congresses, and chairman of the U.S. Committee on the Militia for the 16th and 17th Congresses.

He died in Washington, D.C., and is buried in the Congressional Cemetery.

<doc id="1326664" wikidata="Q2361659" url="?curid=1326664" title="Jackie Stallone">
<text>Jacqueline Frances Stallone (&#x27;Labofish; November 29, 1921 – September 21, 2020) was an American astrologer, dancer and wrestling promoter. She is the mother of actor Sylvester Stallone, singer Frank Stallone, and actress Toni D&#x27;Alto, the latter by her former husband Anthony Filiti.

==Early life==

Jacqueline Frances Labofish was born on November 29, 1921, in Washington, D.C., the older of two girls. Her father, John Paul Labofish (1891–1956), was a Washington lawyer. Her mother, Jeanne Victoria Anne &quot;Adrienne&quot; Clerec (1901–1974), was Breton. Her parents had met while her father was serving in the U.S. Navy at Brest (Brittany) after the First World War. Her paternal grandparents, Rose (Lamlec) and Charles Labofisz, were Jewish immigrants from Odesa, Ukraine, then a part of the Russian Empire.

Her family lived with body builder Charles Atlas who trained the family in gymnastics, weight lifting, and jogging, when she was a girl.

==Career==
Stallone was the first woman to have a daily television show on exercise and weight lifting in Washington, D.C., and later opened a women-only gym, named Barbella&#x27;s. During her youth, Stallone was a trapeze artist in a circus and a chorus girl in a nightclub. She was also a hairdresser. She lived relatively quietly for most of her life. Even after Sylvester starred in the film &quot;Rocky&quot; in 1976, she remained unknown to the general public.

In the 1970s, she owned and operated a facial salon in which she used her own concoctions to treat several skin issues. In her salon, which was on 71st Collins Avenue in Miami Beach, she had a huge poster of Sylvester Stallone and &quot;The Lords of Flatbush&quot;. Stallone was just starting to make it big as an actor and she was very proud. She talked often to her clients about her three children. She enjoyed talking for hours to one client in particular, she would read her palm and entertain her with her love for astrology.

==Television appearances==
Stallone appeared on the 1980s wrestling program &quot;GLOW: Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling&quot;. Stallone was shown rapping with Americana, Mt. Fiji, and Susie Spirit behind her. She rapped about Aunt Kittie&#x27;s girls and making them kitty litter. Stallone became famous in her own right during the mid-1990s, by publishing astrology books, making television appearances, and setting up a psychic hotline where she would charge telephone callers for advice from her and other operators. She also invented the term &quot;rumpology&quot;, which, according to her, is an art similar to that of palm reading except that the procedure is done by examining pictures of people&#x27;s rear ends. She also claimed that she could consult dogs to find out about the future. She also became involved in the cosmetics industry, launching facial masks and other products that she claimed cured skin problems.

On May 21, 1992, Stallone appeared on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; and engaged in a heated on-air argument with Sylvester&#x27;s dad, Frank Stallone Sr. She accused him of being horrible in bed and wanting to have Sylvester aborted. She said that she faked the abortion and that Frank did not know about it until she gave birth. Several curse words were said and some were not censored.

In January 2005, she appeared on the UK TV series &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; as a &quot;surprise&quot; contestant. She was brought onto the show to create tension within the &quot;house&quot;, as her former daughter-in-law Brigitte Nielsen, with whom she notoriously did not get along, was also a contestant. Stallone was the first contestant voted out by viewers after spending four days in the house.

Stallone appeared on BBC TV show &quot;Through the Keyhole&quot; in March 2007. On the show, Stefanie Powers explored her LA home and then interviewed her.

==In popular culture==
In 1994, Stallone was parodied in a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; skit in which Janeane Garofalo played Stallone. In the skit, Stallone advertised a psychic hotline telling of her two sons &quot;Sylvester, the famous star, and Frank, a struggling musician&quot;. Stallone encouraged customers to call so she could steer them away from the &quot;Frank&quot; (negativity) in their lives and toward the &quot;Sylvester&quot; (success).

Her appearance on &quot;Celebrity Big Brother 3&quot; in the United Kingdom was parodied on the British TV comedy show &quot;French and Saunders&quot;, with Dawn French playing Stallone and Jennifer Saunders playing Brigitte Nielsen.

In &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;, Season 1, Episode 1, entitled &quot;Fashion&quot; (1992), Saffy mistakes £300 worth of royal jelly for honey and eats it on toast, to which Edina says, &quot;This is the stuff, sweetie... Jackie Stallone would kill for this, darling&quot;.

In a clip on the TV show &quot;Talk Soup&quot;, Stallone ate shrimp and a producer dubbed in belches. This caused host Greg Kinnear to laugh uncontrollably on camera.

==Personal life ==
Stallone had three children and seven grandchildren. Her first marriage was to Frank Stallone Sr. which lasted from 1945 to 1957, and produced her two sons, Sylvester and Frank Jr. They divorced in 1957. Her second marriage was to Anthony Filiti in 1959, with whom she had a daughter, the late, Toni D&#x27;Alto. They later divorced. Her third and final marriage was to Stephen Levine in 1998, and lasted until her death in 2020. Her eldest grandchild Sage Stallone died unexpectedly in 2012. She had another grandson and three granddaughters through eldest son Sylvester, a grandson through Frank, and a grandson through Toni.

==Death==
Jackie Stallone died on September 21, 2020, at the age of 98. Her death was announced by her son Frank.

<text>In archaeology, a perforated baton, bâton de commandement or bâton percé is a type of artefact from prehistoric Europe made from antler, which probably served many functions such as being used as a spear-thrower, in rope-making, and ceremonial and other uses. 

The name &quot;bâtons de commandement&quot; (&quot;batons of command&quot;) was the name first applied to the class of artefacts, but it makes an assumption of function, as a ceremonial object or insignia held by leaders. The name &quot;bâton percé&quot;, meaning &quot;pierced rod&quot;, or &quot;perforated baton&quot; (the term used by the British Museum) is a more recent term, and is descriptive of form rather than any presumed function.

Many are decorated with carved or engraved animals, and recently the most usual explanation of their use is that they were used for straightening spears and arrows, and as spear-throwers. Originally they were thought by many to be a symbolic attribute of authority. 

==Description and function==
Bâtons percés are made from a length of antler, or ivory, with at least one round hole typically made at one end. They often have abstract or animal designs etched into them (such as horses). They have been found at Aurignacian and Magdalenian sites of the Upper Paleolithic in Europe, with examples dating from 35–12,000 years ago. They have a joint at one end, often forming a T or Y shape, but always with a swelling of the antler at that end. There is a circular hole drilled through the antler just below the swelling or joint, and often a smaller second hole nearby on the shaft. Typical examples range from 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) in length. One unusual bone baton from le Souci, Lalinde has a row of eight holes of different sizes.

The purpose of the bâton percé was originally thought to be as a symbol of power or status, hence the early name &quot;bâton de commandement&quot;, or &quot;rod of command&quot;, given by Louis Laurent Gabriel de Mortillet. This interpretation is now thought unlikely; one French archaeologist wrote derisively of the name summoning up the image of &quot;an aged general... directing... an assault on a mammoth&quot;. Other interpretations include:
* An arrow or spear-straightener, with the shaft to be straightened passing through the hole
* A spear thrower
* A symbol of fertility, with the long handle as a male phallic symbol, and the hole as representing the vagina
* A dress fastener
* A calendar used by midwives
*A tool for smoothing and shaping leather thongs.
*A dildo; few archaeologists consider these items as sex toys, but archaeologist Timothy Taylor put it, &quot;Looking at the size, shape, and—some cases—explicit symbolism of the ice age batons, it seems disingenuous to avoid the most obvious and straightforward interpretation. But it has been avoided.&quot;
*In some instances, a rope making tool.

The British Museum &quot;scope note&quot; for &quot;Perforated baton&quot; says in 2011: &quot;They are now understood to [be] implements used in the manufacture and throwing of spears.&quot;

Focusing only on what the objects were used for does not, however, account for why they were decorated.

==The spear thrower hypothesis==
The use of the bâton percé as a spear-thrower has been the subject of experimental archaeology which has yielded evidence in support of the hypothesis that the bâton percé was used as a spear thrower.

The spear thrower hypothesis was first put forward in an article by artist Leon Underwood in 1965. In this, Underwood, who had previously engaged in experimental archeology working with bronze artefacts, rejected the classification of the &quot;bâton percé&quot; as a &quot;magic wand&quot;, and drew comparisons between it and more contemporary Inuit spear throwers. Underwood&#x27;s hypothesis was that the existing samples of the &quot;bâton percé&quot; were in poor shape, and may have been missing a hook, such as that found on the Inuit spear thrower and the atlatl. Underwood built two wooden models, based on different &quot;bâton percé&quot; from museum collections, but with the addition of a &#x27;nipple&#x27; or hook to the end of the shaft opposite the hole. These reproductions were compared against Inuit designs, and were found to offer superior performance when throwing fletched spears; Underwood pointed out that the Inuit throwers, built using driftwood, were necessarily weaker and that the design reflected the available materials.

In another experiment, the &quot;bâton percé&quot; was used in the other orientation, held so that the end with the hole was outwards, and no hook was added. In this series of tests, a , fletched spear was used. To use the &quot;bâton percé&quot; as a spear thrower, a length of cord is attached to the spear, near the middle of the spear. Leather would be suitable for lighter spears, while sinew would be required for heavier spears. The addition of the cord turns the spear into a large Swiss arrow. Using the spear thus equipped as a Swiss arrow resulted in a 43% increase in range, compared to a hand thrown spear.

The &quot;bâton percé&quot; is used by feeding the cord through the hole, and laying the cord along the length of the shaft. The &quot;bâton percé&quot; is held in the hand with the solid end held in the hand near the pinkie and the pierced end emerging from the other end of the fist. The loose end of the cord is grasped between thumb and forefinger, and the spear is laid along the bâton percé. The spear may be twisted up to one and a half turns, which serves to stabilize the spear during the throw. The &quot;bâton percé&quot; is held over the shoulder, and thrown overhand. The length of the &quot;bâton percé&quot; serves to increase the thrower&#x27;s leverage, providing more speed, and the cord acts as it does in a Swiss arrow, extending the leverage further. Use of the &quot;bâton percé&quot; in this way results in a 127% increase in range over the same hand-thrown spear.

===Experimental observations===
Most&quot; bâton percé&quot; examples are curved to some degree, either from the natural curve of the antler from which they are made, or as the result of deliberate alteration. Straight or curved handles both produce similar gains in range, but the experimenters found that curved handles provided better ergonomics than a straight handle, with left-handed throwers preferring one direction of curve, and right-handed throwers preferring the other. Straight handles had the advantage of being usable by both left and right-handed throwers.

While the T or Y shape is not required for use as a spear thrower, an example with a T or Y shape is less sensitive to the direction and amount of twist in the cord, and thus easier to use. Used in the method described, even the &quot;bâton percé&quot;″s hole can be dispensed with, though the resulting spear thrower would be far more difficult to load and use.

The cord used works well when it is long enough that about of cord extends from the hole of the &quot;bâton percé&quot; to the knot on the spear. Longer cords up to may provide higher velocities. Cord attachment points can vary from the middle of the spear to the centre of mass, depending on the length, and a significantly front-heavy spear works best.

The spear should be long enough to project about in front of the &quot;bâton percé&quot; when ready to throw. When using a long spear, a longer &quot;bâton percé&quot; can also be used, though a short version works as well. The longer &quot;bâton percé&quot; may provide additional velocity over the shorter version.

==The spear straightener hypothesis==

The hypothesis that the batons were used to help fashion spears, darts, and arrows does not necessarily conflict with their use as spear-throwers.

The straighteners may have operated in two main ways. Firstly, the holes may have been used as a &quot;shaft wrench&quot; to lever a wooden shaft straight, perhaps after heating the shaft. The shaft would be noticeably smaller than the hole, and placed through it. By applying pressure on the baton bends in the shaft could be straightened. The second method is to put the shaft through the hole, and then spin the baton round and round, with the rough inside of the hole either wearing away the wood to achieve a tapering point, or marking areas to be whittled; it could then be fire-hardened. Smoothing leather thongs placed through the hole in a similar way is another possible use.

==Rope making==
Some batons, especially those with multiple holes and/or spiral grooves around the holes, can function as tools for making rope, and have had been found with chemical evidence suggesting this use. Also see Hohle Fels.

==Collections==
There are examples in museums in many parts of Europe, but there are especially good holdings of decorated batons, mostly from the excavations of Magdalenian sites by Henry Christy and Édouard Lartet, in the Musée d&#x27;Archéologie Nationale, British Museum and Muséum de Toulouse. In 2013 a number of batons were displayed in an exhibition at the British Museum &quot;Ice Age Art: Arrival of the Modern Mind&quot;.

==Unique North American example==
The &quot;Murray Springs shaft wrench&quot; appears to be a unique North American example of a similar tool made of bone and comes from the Clovis culture. It dates to about 9,000 years ago and was found in Arizona, where it is now in the Arizona State Museum. It is 259mm long and undecorated, with a simple shaft with a larger end, which has a single, rather oval, hole 25–30 mm across. Similar but smaller tools from much later Native American cultures are known, which are regarded as arrow-straighteners.

<text>Pinus aristata, the Rocky Mountain bristlecone pine or Colorado bristlecone pine is a long-lived species of bristlecone pine tree native to the United States. It is found in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado and northern New Mexico, with an isolated population in the San Francisco Peaks of Arizona. It is found at very high altitudes, from in cold, dry subalpine climate conditions, often at the tree line, although it also forms extensive closed-canopy stands at somewhat lower elevations.

==Description==
&quot;Pinus aristata&quot; is a medium-size tree, commonly reaching in height and occasionally as much as in their natural habitat. In favorable conditions they are straight and upright trees, but they become increasingly stunted, short, and twisted the closer they grow to timberline. The crown of the tree is flattened, irregular, or round in shape when fully mature. The trunk can be very substantial, commonly and up to in diameter, and tapers very noticeably towards the top. The bark is fairly smooth and white-gray on young trees, but becomes dark and cracked with a scaly texture on old trees. The color of older bark varies from red-brown to gray.

Young trees that are not stunted have evenly spaced whorls of branches. On older trees the branches are crooked and twisting and may be partially dead. Twigs begin as red-brown, but become gray with age. Twigs and very young branches are covered in needles that last for 10 to 17 years, giving them a shaggy bottle brush appearance. The needle like leaves are bundles of five and are 2–4 centimeters long, but usually longer than 3 cm. The fascicle, the base that holds the needles together, breaks down more quickly in &quot;Pinus aristata&quot; than in &quot;Pinus longaeva&quot;, giving a more even appearance to its branches. The resin canals in the needles are closer to the surface and not as sturdy, explaining the noticeable white flecks of resin. The botanist Dana K. Bailey described the needles covered in resin as appearing &quot;dandruffy&quot;. The small dried droplets are easily mistaken for scale insects. Between the white specks the needles are dark green in color. The buds are egg shaped with a long tapering point (), about 1 cm in size. New shoots are light orange and may covered in hairs or hairless.

===Cones===

The pollen cone is approximately 1 cm in length and may be blueish to red colored. Trees mature enough to produce seed cones are generally about 1.5 meters in height and 20 years of age. Seed cones are dark purple when immature and turn brown as they ripen. At full size they are 6–11 centimeters in length. A seed cone takes two years to fully ripen. Each scale of the cone is tipped with a thin, brittle pickle 4–10 millimeters long. They fall from the tree soon after releasing their seeds. &quot;Pinus aristata&quot; has seeds that are gray-brown to nearly black in color with darker spots and 5–6 mm long. The seed has an attached papery wing 10–13 mm long. Their mean weight is 25 milligrams, significantly smaller than those of the whitebark pine at 175 mg, but much larger than the 4 mg of lodgepole pine. Large crops of cones are produced only once per century on average.

===Seedlings===

The seeds of &quot;Pinus aristata&quot; easily germinate, with as much as 80% of the seeds being viable. Seeds that are mechanically damaged are colonized and killed by fungus. Each new sprout will have between seven and twelve needle-like seed leaves. The seedlings are quite vulnerable to cold temperatures with all being killed if exposed to temperatures of less than .

===Longevity===
Though they do not obtain the extreme age of the Great Basin bristlecone pines, Colorado bristlecones still reach quite advanced ages. There are 13 trees that are known to be older than 1600 years by reliable dating, including one on Mount Goliath dated to the year 403. Four of these trees exceed 2100 years of age and one is years old (see Notable trees). Based on size and appearance scientists estimate there are 30 more trees in the same general area older than 1600 years that have not yet had core samples taken. The botanist Aljos Farjon thinks that there may be trees that are older 3000 years of age that have yet to be scientifically scrutinized. At lower elevations in montane habitats where they grow with grasses, ages generally do not exceed 300 years.

The Rocky Mountain bristlecone is known both for having stripes of dead wood on the trunks of older trees and for the extreme lengths of time that dead trees will remain sound. In this it is very much like the Great Basin bristlecone.
==Taxonomy==

&quot;Pinus aristata&quot; was scientifically described in 1862 by George Engelmann with its present scientific name. The botanical samples used to describe and name the species were collected in 1861 by Charles Christopher Parry, however the earliest known scientific collection was by Frederick Creuzefeldt in 1853. In 1878 Englemann worked on a reclassification of the taxon as a variety of &quot;Pinus balfouriana&quot; and in 1880 as a subspecies. This reassessment was initially accepted by botanists such as Charles Sprague Sargent, but was rejected by others such as Edward James Ravenscroft. It is listed as an accepted species with no subspecies by Plants of the World Online, World Flora Online, and World Plants. Prior to work by Dana K. Bailey published in 1971, &quot;Pinus longaeva&quot; trees growing in California, Nevada, and Utah were not identified as a separate species or subspecies. A distance of separates the populations of &quot;P. aristata&quot; from the closest groves of &quot;P. longaeva&quot;.

===Names===
The species name &quot;aristata&quot; means &quot;bristle&quot; in botanical Latin, a reference to the long points on the ends of the scales of its cones. As the first bristlecone identified, &quot;Pinus aristata&quot; is still occasionally referred to simply as &quot;bristlecone pine&quot;, however &quot;Pinus longaeva&quot; is also sometimes called bristlecone pine in English. To distinguish it from its relative the name &quot;Rocky Mountain bristlecone pine&quot; has been used since at least 1971 and the similar &quot;Colorado bristlecone&quot; has been in use since at least 1976. The common name &quot;hickory pine&quot; is used, most often in Colorado, due to the hardness and density of the wood being like that of a hickory. It is additionally known as &quot;foxtail pine&quot; and &quot;wind timber&quot;, but the first of these names is more often applied to &quot;Pinus balfouriana&quot;.

==Range and habitat==
The Colorado bristlecone grows in three western US states, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona. The Rocky Mountain bristle cone reaches its northern limit at approximately 40 degrees north latitude. They are widely distributed in the Southern Rocky Mountains, but are limited to small areas within its range. The elevation range where it grows is widest, from , in the state of Colorado. The Arizona population is only found above 2900 m and only as high as 3700 m. In New Mexico the trees start at a similarly high elevation of 3000 m and have the same maximum as in Arizona.

Rocky Mountain bristlecone will grow in krummholz habitat at the edge of the arctic tundra, where it has the typical dwarfed and gnarled growth of these &quot;crooked woods&quot;. Its habitat extends downward into the subalpine forests and even lower in the driest parts of the middle elevations. The bristlecones and limber pines (&quot;Pinus flexilis&quot;) will grow into full trees at elevations where silver spruces (&quot;Picea engelmannii&quot;) and subalpine firs (&quot;Abies lasiocarpa&quot;) are reduced to stunted, ground hugging shrubs. Their greater tolerance of dry conditions is what enables them to grow more successfully in challenging mountain habitats.
In Arizona this species of bristlecone pine is only found on the San Francisco Peaks, four volcanic cinder cones in north-central Arizona. Their alpine trees and flora resemble those of the Southern Rocky Mountains more than that of Nevada or California, including having Colorado bristlecone pines rather than Great Basin bristlecones. There they grow on south facing slopes together with limber pines. This isolated island of mountain habitat is from the closest alpine habitat in southern Colorado.

In the Southern Rocky Mountains they, like the limber pine, may grow in extensive stands on some sites without other species of tree or may be found intermixed with them. In the southerly parts of the Sangre de Cristo Range they replace the limber pines at higher elevations on very dry sites. It becomes more common in more northerly portions of the range, especially in habitats above . A very large bristlecone pine wood of grows in the Valle Vidal within the Carson National Forest. In both New Mexico and Colorado they mostly grow on steep, south-facing slopes that are quite dry.

In Colorado there are more than 50 areas with notable populations of bristlecone pine found in the southern and central mountain ranges of the state. On the Spanish Peaks in southern Colorado bristlecone pines grow together with ponderosa pines and Rocky Mountain white oaks at relative low elevations, an unusual habitat type. Though they also grow in nearly pure stands higher up in the subalpine zone of the Spanish Peaks. A forest of growing on the southeastern flank of Mount Bross in the Pike National Forest is named the Windy Ridge Bristlecone Pine Scenic Area. Further north, they grow on the mountains of the Front Range south of James Peak. In the southern part of the range around Pikes Peak they occur on the south facing slopes while limber pines grow on the north facing areas. In areas around Mount Blue Sky bristlecone pines more often mix with limber pines, though bristlecones tend to be more common on fine textured soils while rocky ridges have more limber pines. The rocks and soils derived from them along the Front Range are Precambrian granite. The small grove in the Mount Goliath Natural area is notable both for the age of one of its trees (see Notable trees) as well as for the ease of public access from the Mount Blue Sky Scenic Byway.

The typical habitat of high altitude groves is quite cool, even in summer. In the Front Range it was measured to have a mean annual temperature of in the 1970s. The winds are also quite severe with speeds of common.

===Conservation===
The International Union for Conservation of Nature last evaluated &quot;Pinus aristata&quot; in 2012 and listed it as one of their species of &quot;least concern&quot;. The evaluation found its population was stable without a continuing decline of mature individuals, but with a naturally very fragmented habitat. In contrast, when NatureServe evaluated it in 1999 they listed it as &quot;vulnerable&quot; (G3) due to its small distribution. They additionally found it to be &quot;imperiled&quot; (S2) in Arizona. In Arizona the state lists it as a salvage resiricted native plant, one that requires a permit for removal including on private land.

==Ecology==
The seeds of the Rocky Mountain bristlecone are eaten by Clark&#x27;s nutcracker (&quot;Nucifraga columbiana&quot;) and may also be stored by them in years where crops of seeds are particularly large. Unlike the seeds of the Colorado pinyon (&quot;Pinus edulis&quot;) the seeds of show the same speckled patterns for camouflage on soil as other species and are not adapted to be primarily animal dispersed.

The Rocky Mountain bristlecone is quite vulnerable to fire. After forest fires stands show very little regeneration after thirty years and a lower abundance compared with other species tree species that are more able to colonize newly open areas.

==Notable trees==
The oldest tree in Colorado is a Rocky Mountain bristlecone that was dated by F. Craig Brunstein and David Yamaguchi to 442 BCE. Designated in the 1992 paper as CB-90-11, it grows on Black Mountain in the Pike National Forest west of Pike&#x27;s Peak. At the time core samples were taken by researchers the trees showed many signs of old age including dead wood that had been sculpted by wind erosion, crowns that had died back, only strips of living bark, and a radius greater than . Three other trees in the same area were dated to earlier than 100 BCE.

The oldest known tree on Mount Goliath was discovered by Dr. Paula Krebs in 1970 while working on her doctoral dissertation. The tree, which she named Great Grandma, was dated to 403 CE making it years old.

The tallest recorded tree is one tall that grows in the Carson National Forest, New Mexico. When measured in 1996 it also had a diameter of and a crown spread of .

The American National Register of Champion Trees records a tree with a very large diameter of Huerfano County, Colorado. This tree also has a height of and a crown spread of when it was measured in 2018.

==Uses==
Formerly it was used for fuel, electric utility poles, signposts, and as support timbers in mines.

===Cultivation===
Rocky Mountain bristlecone the most common of the bristlecone pines in cultivation. It is a very attractive slow-growing small tree suitable for small gardens in cold climates. It was brought into cultivation by Parry at the Arnold Arboretum soon after he collected the materials for its scientific description in 1861. It has been cultivated since at least 1863 in the United Kingdom, but is a rarely planted tree there. In gardens it will range from high and wide. However, due to its slow growth rare it is rare to see one taller than 10 m in landscaping. It requires a well drained soil, one that is rocky and poor in organic material being particularly suitable. They also tolerate alkaline soils. 

Trees are tolerant of windy conditions, but will show evidence damage from the wind. They have an extreme resistance to cold, being hardy in USDA zones 3–7. They can be encouraged to grow more quickly with supplemental water, but overwatering resulting in deformed growth or death is a frequent problem in landscaping. The Colorado bristlecone is quite flammable and is also susceptible to air pollution. Though symmetrical and bushy when young, as the trees grow they become more open in structure and irregular in shape.

===Cultivars===
====&#x27;Blue Bear&#x27;====
A thick branched cultivar named for its blue-green foliage. It grows at about each year.

====&#x27;Formal Form&#x27;====
A cultivar with a narrower, upright growth habit and blue-green foliage.

====&#x27;Joe&#x27;s Bess&#x27;====
A dwarf selection that has a uniform shape and upright habit. It is used in full sun borders or as a specimen plant.

====&#x27;Sherwood Compact&#x27;====
This is a very dwarfed variety. It grows with a somewhat more treelike form when grafted onto &quot;Pinus strobus&quot; as a rootstock, but remains very small. It was introduced to the horticultural trade in 1983. It also has shorter needles.

<text>The Union Pacific Railroad&#x27;s M-10003, M-10004, M-10005, and M-10006 were four identical streamlined 2-car power car diesel-electric train sets delivered in May, June, and July 1936 from Pullman-Standard, with prime movers from the Winton Engine Corporation of General Motors and General Electric generators, control equipment and traction motors. One was for the &quot;City of San Francisco&quot;, two were for the &quot;City of Denver&quot;, and one was a spare set intended for both routes. In 1939, M-10004 was split and converted into additional boosters for the other sets, now renumbered CD-05, CD-06, and CD-07, all running on the &quot;City of Denver&quot;. The M-10001 power car became the other third booster. In this form, the three power sets ran until they were replaced by E8 locomotives in 1953, at which point they were scrapped.

== Historical significance ==
The M-10003 through M-10006 represented the final development of the custom streamlined trainset on the Union Pacific. They followed the cab/booster unit concept pioneered with the M-10002 trainset. As totally separable and interchangeable cab/booster power sets, they set the path that EMC was to follow with introduction of their E series locomotive sets the following year. Union Pacific was able to maintain daily service on the Chicago-Denver run for seventeen years by dedicating three locomotive sets to that service and re-purposing power units from M-10001 and M-10004 (three total) to provide additional power and keep at least two of the locomotive sets in running condition at any given time.

== Details ==
These power sets had stylistic elements in common with the Illinois Central&#x27;s &quot;Green Diamond&quot; unit, which was completed just previous to them. Abandoning the &quot;turret cab&quot; styling of M-10000 through M-10002, these units adopted a new &quot;automobile design&quot; elevated cab, as with the &quot;Green Diamond&quot;, behind a longer nose than that of the &quot;Diamond.&quot; They shared a divided front air intake grille that dominated the nose, edged in shining stainless steel. Beneath, the pilot was edged and barred in stainless steel, very like the &quot;Diamond&#x27;s&quot;. The &quot;Diamond&quot; kept the headlight at the top of the cab, while with these power sets a large headlight tipped the nose. The IC121 &quot;Diamond&quot; was a single power unit setup with a smaller articulated trainset, and in that regard had more in common with the earlier M-10001.

The copious round porthole-style windows on the power units became a &quot;trademark&quot; feature of Union Pacific locomotives for a number of years. The big shiny noses and portholes were imitated in the styling of UP&#x27;s E2 locomotives from 1937.

Each power car had a 1,200 hp V16 Winton 201-A engine, generator, and a pair of two-axle powered trucks. The rear truck of the first power car and the lead truck of the second power car carried a span bolster to which both power cars were articulated, so they made one unified locomotive of B-B+B-B configuration and a total of 2,400 hp (1,800 kW).

M-10004 was matched with a trainset of tapered cross-section, low profile articulated cars of the type built for the earlier M-1000x trainsets. The first cars had been built in anticipation of another tapered turret cab locomotive, but Union Pacific decided instead to cancel the proposed turret cab, expand the set to nine cars, and match it with a more powerful locomotive set of the newer design. The lounge car of the M-10004 set was also built with a food preparation facility occupying its blind rear, which was revised with a new layout and porthole style rear windows between the train&#x27;s &quot;City of San Francisco&quot; and &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot; service periods. The M-10005 and M-10006 trainsets were built straight-sided to increase interior space, semi-articulated, and shorter by two sleeper cars than the M-10004 set. All of the M-1000x trainsets were lower profile than standard passenger railcars.

== Changes ==
The most significant change to the City of Denver power sets came in 1939, when they were converted from two-car, 2,400 hp sets to three three-car, 3,600 hp (2700 kW) sets using power equipment from M-10001 and M-10004. Other changes included a gyrating signal light installed below the main headlight after the Second World War, the loss of the stainless steel trim on the pilot, the addition of the Chicago and North Western Railway herald to the nose in addition to the Union Pacific one, and changed nose-side badges for the route. The original Armour Yellow and Leaf Brown livery was changed incrementally to the modern livery of Armour Yellow and Harbor Mist Gray roof and base, with red trim striping separating the main colors. That same footage shows two boosters in the power set, indicating service as &quot;City of Denver&quot; with the expanded M-10003 (CD-07) power set, and an eleven car consist, expanded from the original nine car consist with cars from either the M-10001 or M-10002 set. Slate gray was replaced with Harbor Mist Gray at some point after the mid-1940s. A publicity photo of M-10005 from 1949 shows the trainset with a Harbor Mist Gray roof and a single headlight.

== Individual power set histories ==
The demands of long-distance high speed &quot;City&quot; train service taxed the ability of the M-1000x fleet to meet them. The original 2400 hp power sets with Winton 201A Diesel engines were underpowered for their service requirements and had a short lifespan for mechanical parts, with at best 100,000 miles between piston replacements. These shortcomings led to various measures including equipment replacements, 50% redundancy in locomotives assigned to the Denver run, consolidating the motive power of locomotive sets for a 50% boost in power for the remaining sets, and using a locomotive set built for full-size trains instead of the type originally matched with the trainset.

=== M-10003, later CD-07 ===
Despite the earlier number, the M-10003 was actually the last completed of the four. This was because the number M-10003 had been previously assigned to a projected sister trainset to M-10001, which was cancelled when Union Pacific sought a longer trainset with more power in order to meet demand. The number was reassigned to the fourth of the new locomotive sets.

The M-10003 was intended to be a spare power set, able to fill in on either the &quot;City of San Francisco&quot; or &quot;City of Denver&quot; if any of the other three locomotives needed maintenance. As of March 7, 1937, its booster unit was on loan to M-10002 on the Los Angeles run. In June 1937, it was decided to permanently assign it to the &quot;City of Denver&quot; and it was renumbered to CD-07. A third power car was added in 1939, the converted M-10001 power unit.

CD-07 remained in service on the &quot;City of Denver&quot; with the two other sets until March 1953, and was scrapped with them in summer that year.

=== M-10004, later LA-4 ===
First completed was M-10004 in May 1936 for the &quot;City of San Francisco&quot;. The new power cars had vertical sides and higher profiles than the previous streamliners, but the rest of the train was built to the tapered-side profile of the M-10000 through M-10002 sets. It entered revenue service on June 14, 1936 but lasted only 18 months on the route before a train equipped with the new EMC E2 3-unit set SF-1, SF-2 and SF-3 took over that route. The train was then refurbished by the UP, renumbered LA-4 and placed on &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot; service in July 1938, paired with a train powered by the 3-unit E2 set of LA-1, LA-2, and LA-3 to double the service frequency on that route.

After less than a year as the &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot;, the LA-4 was replaced again, this time by a train equipped with the new EMC E3s LA-5 and LA-6 in March 1939. In June of that year, the lead power car of the train was rebuilt as a booster unit, renumbered to CD-06-C, and added to the former M-10006, now renumbered as CD-06. The trailing power car was added to the former M-10005, now CD-05, as CD-05-C. Both cars were scrapped with their respective power sets in 1953.

The car set from M-10004 became backup equipment in the &quot;City&quot; fleet, pressed into service after the wreck of the &quot;City of San Francisco&quot; in August 1939. The set was assigned to the &quot;City of Portland&quot; run, powered by the former LA-5 and LA-6 E3 locomotive set, between July 1941 and February 1947. The cars were assigned to service as a &quot;City of Denver&quot; set while the primary sets were renovated in late 1947, then stored in 1948 and scrapped in 1951.

=== M-10005, later CD-05 ===
Completed in June 1936, M-10005 entered service as the first of two new streamliners, the &quot;Denver twins&quot;, for the &quot;City of Denver&quot; service on June 18. After approximately a year of running that service, during which the train and its sister M-10006 had moved 129,000 passengers and travelled 765,000 miles (1,231,000 km) between the two, the train was renumbered CD-05.

In 1939, the former trailing power car of LA-4 (ex M-10004) was added as a third locomotive unit to the power set, giving it a total of 3,600 hp (2,700 kW), and the consist was lengthened by two cars, to nine.

In this form, CD-05 continued in service until March 1953, when it was replaced by new E8 units and scrapped a few months later.

=== M-10006, later CD-06 ===
M-10006 followed a similar service life to its sister M-10005, being the second of the &quot;Denver twins&quot;. It was renumbered to CD-06 in June 1937, and added the rebuilt first power car of LA-4 (ex M-10004) as its third power car in 1939. It was withdrawn alongside the other units during March 1953 and scrapped.

<text>Papillon Records was a record label started by the Chrysalis Group (who had sold their Chrysalis Records division to EMI) in 1999 with longtime Chrysalis act Jethro Tull. Whilst Echo Records was formed to provide an outlet by new and independent developing acts, Papillon Records was set up as a competitor to such groups as Eagle Rock Entertainment and Sanctuary Records signing &#x27;heritage acts&#x27; – that is already long-term recording artists with large, loyal fanbases – such as The Human League and Deacon Blue. However, after a number of album releases failed to sell, it was decided in 2001 that Papillon would not sign anymore acts. The label quickly became insolvent and was closed by the Chrysalis Group in 2002. A subsidiary &#x27;The Hit Label&#x27; was left to trade just to deal with back catalogue.

==In the media==
The label grabbed headlines in 1999 by releasing &quot;The Millennium Prayer&quot;, a single by Cliff Richard.

<text>Chris Vrenna (born February 23, 1967) is an American musician, producer, engineer, remixer, programmer, and founder of the electronic band Tweaker. Vrenna played drums for the industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails from 1988 until 1997, and was the keyboardist and drummer of the American rock band Marilyn Manson from 2004 until late 2011.

As a member of Nine Inch Nails, Vrenna was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 2020.

== Career ==
Vrenna was born on February 23, 1967, in Erie, Pennsylvania. He graduated from McDowell High School in Erie, Pennsylvania in 1985, having marched in the Erie Thunderbirds Drum and Bugle Corps. At age 19, while attending Kent State University, Vrenna was recruited by acquaintance Trent Reznor, whom he had met during high school in Pennsylvania, to play drums for local Cleveland, Ohio, band the Exotic Birds.

After being let go from Nine Inch Nails in late 1990, Vrenna then moved to Chicago, quickly becoming a part of the Chicago industrial music scene and was briefly a member of Die Warzau and Stabbing Westward. He also toured as a live drummer for KMFDM during the &quot;Money&quot; era tours, in 1992. He then rejoined Nine Inch Nails as the drummer from 1992 to 1997.

He records under the name Tweaker, and has released four albums under that name: &quot;The Attraction to All Things Uncertain&quot; (2001), &quot;2 a.m. Wakeup Call&quot; (2004), &quot;Call The Time Eternity&quot; (2012), and &quot;And Then There&#x27;s Nothing&quot; (2013). Tweaker toured select North American dates with Skinny Puppy in 2004.

As producer, remixer, or engineer Vrenna has worked with The Smashing Pumpkins, U2, Nine Inch Nails, Skinny Puppy, Humanzi, Gary Numan, Scar the Martyr, David Sylvian, Mudvayne, Lords of Acid, God Lives Underwater, Megadeth, Rammstein, Metallica, The Rasmus, Weezer, P.O.D., David Bowie, Slipknot, Cold, underwater, Scarling., Hole, Marilyn Manson, Rob Zombie, Green Day, Bush, Live, Adema, the Wallflowers, Dir En Grey, Psyclon Nine, and others. He has also worked with the industrial group Pigface and produced songs and albums for underground girl groups TCR, Jack Off Jill, and Rasputina.

Vrenna has also worked on music for several video games, including &quot;Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare&quot;, &quot;Doom 3&quot; (as producer with Clint Walsh), &quot;Quake 4&quot;, &quot;American McGee&#x27;s Alice&quot;, its sequel &quot;&quot;, &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot;, &quot;Sonic The Hedgehog&quot;, &quot;Area 51&quot;, and &quot;Need for Speed: Most Wanted&quot;. In 2004, he started soundtrack work on &quot;Tabula Rasa&quot;, a massive multiplayer online game. He also helped compose the theme song to the animated series &quot;Xiaolin Showdown&quot;.

He can be seen performing in the music videos for the songs &quot;Down in It&quot;, &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot;, &quot;Gave Up&quot;, &quot;Wish&quot;, &quot;The Perfect Drug&quot; and &quot;March of the Pigs&quot; on the Nine Inch Nails video compilation &quot;Closure&quot;. Vrenna won a Grammy award as a member of Nine Inch Nails for &quot;Best Metal Performance&quot; for &quot;Happiness in Slavery&quot; in 1995 for the live performance of the song on Woodstock &#x27;94.

Vrenna was Billy Corgan&#x27;s programmer for four months in 1997. While he was on tour with the Smashing Pumpkins, Vrenna got a call from Axl Rose, who invited Vrenna to spend time with Guns N&#x27; Roses to work on what would become &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;. &quot;I did for a couple weeks, but then decided I didn&#x27;t want to join the band&quot;, said Vrenna. Vrenna stated in a later interview that he was in the band for several months before dropping out due to the required time commitment.

Vrenna was chosen to take over the drumming responsibilities for Marilyn Manson after Ginger Fish was injured in 2004 during the &quot;Lest We Forget&quot; tour. He then replaced Madonna Wayne Gacy as the permanent keyboardist for Marilyn Manson. Vrenna co-produced the albums &quot;The High End of Low&quot; (2009) and &quot;Born Villain&quot; (2012). In April 2011, following the departure of Marilyn Manson&#x27;s drummer Ginger Fish, Chris Vrenna was announced to be his official replacement. However, in November 2011, it was announced that Vrenna had parted ways with the band in order to focus on scoring movies and video games.

In 2015, Vrenna composed the music on a series of downloadable content packs called Exo Zombies for &quot;Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare&quot;.

In 2017, it was announced by Vrenna&#x27;s Facebook page that he would be composing music for the upcoming video game, &quot;Quake Champions&quot;, which marks his second collaboration with id Software since &quot;Doom 3&quot;.

Vrenna earned his master&#x27;s degree in music technology in 2020. He&#x27;s been a college instructor of music technology since 2013.

In 2020, Vrenna was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame alongside members of Nine Inch Nails.

In May 2024 it was announced that Vrenna would join the faculty of the University of Michigan&#x27;s School of Music, Theatre, and Dance  as an assistant professor in the fall 2024 semester.

<text>Esquire Records was a UK jazz record company and label founded by Carlo Krahmer and Peter Newbrook in 1947. It issued recordings by British musicians and others, under licence, from the American Prestige label, the Chicago blues label Delmark, and the Swedish Metronome label. The company lasted until the mid-1970s; after Krahmer&#x27;s death it was run by his widow, Greta Krahmer. In the 1980s, Newbrook (died 2009) reissued much of the Esquire jazz catalogue in an &quot;Esquire Treasure Chest&quot; series of LPs.

The company had a subsidiary, Starlite Records, for non-jazz recordings, including skiffle.

<doc id="1326691" wikidata="Q2735688" url="?curid=1326691" title="Edelweiss (song)">
<text>&quot;Edelweiss&quot; is a show tune from the 1959 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. It is named after the edelweiss (&quot;Leontopodium nivale&quot;), a white flower found high in the Alps. The song was created for the 1959 Broadway production of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, as a song for the character Captain Georg von Trapp. In the stage musical and its 1965 film adaptation, Captain von Trapp and his family sing this song during the concert near the end of Act II, as well as a statement of Austrian patriotism in the face of the pressure put upon him to join the navy of Nazi Germany following the &quot;Anschluss&quot; (Nazi annexation of their homeland). It is also Captain von Trapp&#x27;s subliminal goodbye to his beloved homeland, using the flower as a symbol of his loyalty to Austria. In the film version, the song is additionally sung by the Captain earlier in the film when he rediscovers music with his children.

This was the final song of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s musical collaboration as well as the last lyric written by Oscar Hammerstein II, who died in August 1960.

==Writing==
While &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; was in tryouts in Boston, Richard Rodgers felt Captain von Trapp should have a song with which he would bid farewell to the Austria he knew and loved. Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II decided to write an extra song that von Trapp would sing in the festival concert sequence towards the end of the show. As they were writing it, they remembered that Theodore Bikel, who had been cast as Captain von Trapp, was also a guitar-playing folksinger. They felt he could display that talent when performing the song. The Lindsay and Crouse script provides the metaphor of the simple edelweiss wildflower as a symbol of the Austria that Captain von Trapp, Maria, and their children knew would live on, in their hearts, despite the Nazi annexation of their homeland. The metaphor of this song builds on an earlier scene when Gretl presents a bouquet of edelweiss flowers to Baroness Elsa Schräder, during the latter&#x27;s visit to the von Trapp household.

Rodgers provided a simple, yet haunting and affecting, waltz-time melody, to the simple Italian style ritornello lyric that Hammerstein wrote about the appearance of the edelweiss flower. &quot;Edelweiss&quot; turned out to be one of the most beloved songs in the musical, as well as one of the best-loved songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein.

&quot;Edelweiss&quot; is the last song Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote together; Hammerstein was suffering from stomach cancer, which took his life nine months after &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; opened on Broadway.

==Film adaptation==
Although the stage production uses the song only during the concert scene, Ernest Lehman&#x27;s screenplay for the film adaptation uses the song twice. In a new scene created for the film, inspired by a line in the original script by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse, Captain von Trapp sings &quot;Edelweiss&quot; to his children in their family drawing room, with his eldest daughter, Liesl, singing along briefly. Lehman also expanded the scope of the song when it was sung in the Salzburg Festival concert scene, so that Captain von Trapp calls on the audience to join in the song with him and his family, in defiance of the Nazi soldiers posted around the arena.

Christopher Plummer played the part of Captain von Trapp in the film adaptation. However, his singing was overdubbed with the voice of Bill Lee despite Plummer recording the song himself. 

An instrumental version of the song is also heard as the final song played during the party as Maria leaves to return to the abbey at the end of the first half of the film.

==Austrian attitudes==

The edelweiss is a popular flower in Austria and was featured on the old Austrian 1 schilling coin. It can also now be seen on the 2 cent Euro coin. The flower is protected in Austria and illegal to pick. An &quot;edelweiss&quot; is also worn as a cap emblem by certain Austrian Army and since WWI the German Gebirgsjäger (mountain troopers) to include units stationed today in the nearby Bavarian Alps.

In the original run, the musical &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; was treated with disdain by Austrians, and the song &quot;Edelweiss&quot; has been singled out for criticism. When US President Ronald Reagan quoted the song in 1984 to toast Austrian President Rudolf Kirchschläger, Austrian newspapers complained that the song was full of clichés and called it &quot;kitsch.&quot; When the musical premiered on the national stage in Vienna in 2005, one critic called it &quot;boring&quot; and another referred to &quot;Edelweiss&quot; as &quot;an insult to Austrian musical creation.&quot; However, attitudes have improved as film tourism became a bigger attraction than Salzburg&#x27;s attraction for being the birthplace of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. When the musical premiered in Salzburg in 2011, most performances were sold out.

==Misconceptions==

Perceived authenticity of the song has led to a misconception that it is an Austrian folk song or a national anthem rather than a work contrived for the entertainment world. In fact, Austria&#x27;s current official anthem is &quot;Land der Berge, Land am Strome&quot;. Further, the former anthem, from 1929 until the Anschluss was &quot;Sei gesegnet ohne Ende&quot; (associated with the Federal State of Austria, when the story begins).

Alyson McLamore, in her book &quot;Musical Theater: An Appreciation&quot; wrote, &quot;The last song to be written for the show was &#x27;Edelweiss,&#x27; a tender little homage to a native flower of Austria that has the effect of authentic Austrian folksong.&quot; Hugh Fordin, in his biography of Oscar Hammerstein, wrote &quot;&#x27;Edelweiss&#x27; was widely believed to be an old Austrian song, though Oscar … composed it for the Sound of Music.&quot; Theodore Bikel wrote that he was approached by a native Austrian who said, &quot;I love that Edelweiss&quot; and then added, with total confidence, &quot;Of course, I have known it for a long time, but only in German&quot;.

A misconception about the song is that it was a Nazi anthem but it was not written until long after the Nazis were vanquished along with the rest of the Axis Powers. A different song, titled Es war ein Edelweiss, was, however, composed by Herms Niel for the Nazi Army in 1941.

==Legal problems==
The estates of Rodgers and Hammerstein have not authorized the use of alternative lyrics with the melody of the song, making certain commercial uses of those versions potentially infringing if they do not fall under fair use. Rodgers stated that &quot;he would take legal action against any group&quot; using the &quot;Edelweiss&quot; melody with altered words; the current rightsholders comply with his wishes, refusing to grant permission for these commercial requests, which are &quot;inconsistent with the creators&#x27; intentions&quot;.

==Other versions==
*English singer Vince Hill reached #2 in the UK Singles Chart in 1967 with his cover version of the track.
*Josephine Siao (蕭芳芳) performed a Chinese (Cantonese) version in the 1967 movie &quot;Lightning Killer&quot; (閃電煞星).
*In 2013, American country singer Carrie Underwood and English actor Stephen Moyer, along with Ariane Rinehart, Michael Nigro, Ella Watts-Gorman, Joe West, Sophia Caruso, Grace Rundhaug and Peyton Ella, would perform the song in &quot;The Sound of Music Live!&quot; and would do a studio recording of the song for the soundtrack.
* A performance by Jeanette Olsson is used in the opening sequence of the 2015 Amazon series &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot;.
*American singer Leslie Odom Jr. covers the song with his wife Nicolette Robinson on his &quot;Simply Christmas&quot; album.

<doc id="1326714" wikidata="Q5138373" url="?curid=1326714" title="Coaster Step">
<text>A Coaster Step is a term used in swing dancing which originated in Lindy swing. During the last two beats of a rhythm pattern, the follower rotated 90° to be perpendicular to the leader, then stepped back, together, and forward in triple-rhythm (three weight changes in two beats of music), then rotated back to face the leader and to be ready to step forward as the leader led the follower in to begin the next pattern.

Arthur Murray mistakenly codified the Lindy coaster step into its &quot;Western Swing&quot; curriculum as having the follower simply continue to face the leader and step back, together, and forward toward the leader during the last two beats of a pattern. In later years, this form of swing has been termed &quot;Ballroom Swing&quot; to distinguish it from other forms.

When dancing with a Lindy dancer using this form of the Coaster Step, the connection between leader and follower was broken on the last beat of the pattern as the follower stepped forward and the Lindy leader remained in place.

In the 1950s, West Coast Swing was popularized by Skippy Blair, who within time introduced the Anchor Step for use during the last two beats of each rhythm pattern for both leaders and followers.

Technically, Skippy Blair defined the anchor step as keeping the center-point-of-balance (solar plexus) behind the heel of the forward foot throughout the last two beats of each West Coast Swing pattern, providing wide latitude for dancers to express themselves. The most common version of the anchor step uses triple-rhythm. The forward foot remains in place and the rear foot remains in place in 3rd foot position. Weight is transferred from front to back on the first weight change, begins to transfer back to the forward foot but is &quot;checked&quot; on the second weight change, and is transferred back to the rear foot on the third weight change.

Skippy Blair measured movement using &quot;rolling count&quot; (&amp;a1, &amp;a2, etc.), which helps facilitate body flight in dance. Using this measurement technique learned from studying the movement of champion West Coast Swing competitors, the weight changes at the end of a six-count rhythm pattern (&amp;a5&amp;a6) occur on count &#x27;5&#x27;, the &#x27;a&#x27; count before count &#x27;6&#x27;, and on count &#x27;6&#x27;. Most often it is the follower&#x27;s step. As of 1994, the Coaster Step was still used in &quot;Ballroom Swing&quot;, and is an identifying feature of that dance.

== Coaster Step used instead of Anchor Step ==

Note: The Anchor Step had not yet been created when Lindy dancers who used the original Coaster Step were dancing street swing, nor when Laure Haile defined what became a modified version of the Coaster Step for Western Swing at Arthur Murray dance studios.

West Coast Swing dancers, who use the anchor step later developed by Skippy Blair, have never used an Arthur Murray version of the Coaster Step in its place. So, the author of the heading of this section seems to be referring to a later time when West Coast Swing had already become popular and Arthur Murray dancers were still using their version of the Coaster Step instead of adjusting to use of the WCS Anchor Step. The use of the references to Skippy Blair to justify the statements in this section are curious.)
The name &quot;coaster step&quot; denotes original function of the step, which was to gradually diminish a partner&#x27;s momentum through the last two beats of any pattern until the body has slowed enough to change direction or velocity easily without exerting too much force on either the dancer or the partnership.

The Bronze Level syllabus for Western Swing included in the Dance Book written in the 1950s by Arthur Murray Dance Studios National Director, and Los Angeles basin resident, Lauré Haile, defined a &quot;Coaster Step&quot; as cross forward place, or back together side, or back forward back. Her written description of the step(s) does not include any swiveling. However, her written description variations of the second triple of the &quot;Basic Throwout&quot; includes the following, &quot;On the 2nd 1-2-3 the girl can take a sharp turn LEFT... Her styling here is to be on the balls of both feet, with both knees bent and pointing to her LEFT.&quot;

Although Haile used the term &quot;Twinkle&quot; to refer to a &quot;back-together-forward&quot; triple step, the 1971 edition of the &quot;Encyclopedia of Social Dance&quot; defined &quot;Coaster Step&quot; as &quot;back-together-forward&quot; in its description of &quot;Western Swing&quot;.

<doc id="1326729" wikidata="Q7048891" url="?curid=1326729" title="Non-decimal currency">
<text>A non-decimal currency is a currency that has sub-units that are a non-decimal fraction of the main unit, i.e. the number of sub-units in a main unit is not a power of 10. Historically, most currencies were non-decimal, though today virtually all are now decimal.

== Contemporary situation ==
Today, only two countries have non-decimal currencies: Mauritania, where 1 ouguiya = 5 khoums, and Madagascar, where 1 ariary = 5 iraimbilanja. However, these are only theoretically non-decimal, as in both cases the value of each sub-unit is too small to be of any practical use and coins of sub-unit denominations are no longer used.

The official currency of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, which retains its claims of sovereignty under international law and has been granted permanent observer status at the United Nations, is the Maltese scudo, which is subdivided into 12 tarì, each of 20 grani with 6 piccoli to the grano.

All other contemporary currencies are either decimal or have no sub-units at all, either because they have been abolished or because they have lost all practical value and are no longer used.

==Historic non-decimal currencies==
Historically, a variety of non-decimal systems have been used. For example, A vigesimal system (base 20) was in use within ancient Mesoamerica. A sexagesimal system (base 60) was in wide use in ancient Mesopotamia, as this system was used in measurements of time, geometry, currency, and other fields.

Decimal currencies also have disadvantages. The principal advantage of most non-decimal currencies is that they are more easily divided, particularly by numbers such as 3 and 8, than decimal currencies, due to being based upon conversion values that have a large number of factors. A currency with a 100:1 ratio is divisible neither into 3 nor into 8. For example, one-third of an Austrian Gulden (of 60 Kreuzer) was 20 Kreuzer while a third of a dollar is 33. cents. This divisibility is useful when trading and when sharing out sums of money. For these reasons, many states chose in the past to adopt non-decimal currencies based on divisions into sub-units such as 12 or 20, sometimes with more than one tier of sub-units.

There is a second, more fortuitous, way in which non-decimal currencies emerged. Often multiple currencies would circulate concurrently in an economy, with non-decimal exchange rates between them. For example, a group related currencies called Reichsthaler, rixdollar, riksdaler, rijksdaalder, and rigsdaler were widely accepted as a common accounting unit which represented a variety of local coins in Stockholm, Copenhagen, Antwerp, and Cologne. Inflation developed locally, with changing subdivisions. For instance the Riksdaler was equivalent to 2 silver dalers in Sweden in 1700, but after the 1715-19 devaluation of the silver daler coin until 1776 one Riksdaler equated to 3 daler silvermint. Most currencies made no distinction between units of accounting and units represented by coins and thus created such shifts. (A similar example in the UK was the guinea, which was worth slightly more than one pound sterling.)

In general, when the major unit was, say, a gold coin and the minor units were silver or copper coins, then when the relative values of the metals changed, perhaps because of an increase or decrease in the supply of one of the metals, then the number of minor units equivalent to one major unit would also change.

Thus the following list does not give a complete picture: it is a list of examples picked from different periods. Many of the subdivisions given below underwent historical changes.

The Russian ruble is often said to have become the first decimalized currency when Peter the Great established the ratio 1 ruble = 100 kopecks in 1701. The Japanese were in some sense earlier calculating with the silver momme and its decimal subunits - but then the momme was not a coin but a unit of weight equivalent to 3.75 g: accounting was by weight of silver. The British pound sterling was the last major currency to be decimalized, on 15 February 1971. The Maltese waited just one year (1972) before following suit and Nigeria followed in 1973. An early proposal for decimalizing the pound in the 19th century envisaged a system of 1 Pound = 10 florins = 100 dimes = 1000 cents. However the only step taken at that time was the introduction in 1849 of a florin (two shillings) coin (the earliest examples bore the inscription &quot;One Tenth of a Pound&quot;).

===List===
A partial listing of former non-decimal currencies (giving only units of account):

*Ancient Greece — 1 drachma = 6 obols
* Denmark — 1 Krone = 8 Marks = 128 Skillings = 1536 Pfennigs; also 6 Marks = 1 Rigsbank Daler
*France — 1 livre = 20 sols = 240 deniers; also 20 francs = 1 Napoléon (and other less common denominations)
*German Coins
**Frankfurt — 1 Reichstaler = 90 Kreuzer = 360 Pfennige OR 1 Reichsgulden = 60 Kreuzer = 240 Pfennige
**Hanover — 1 Thaler = 36 Mariengroschen = 288 Pfennige
**Hamburg — 1 Thaler = 3 Mark = 48 Schillinge = 96 Pfennige; later 12 Pfennige = 1 Schilling 
**Prussia — 1 Thaler = 30 Silbergroschen 
*India 
** Calcutta and Madras — 1 rupee = 16 annas = 64 paise = 192 pies Also, 1 gold mohur = 15 silver rupees
** Bombay — 1 rupee = 4 quarters = 400 reas 
*Iran — 1 Rial = 20 Shahi
*Kingdom of Ireland, Irish Free State, Republic of Ireland (until 1971) 
**1 Irish pound = 20 shillings = 240 pence
**1 shilling = 12 pence
*Japan — separate gold, silver, and copper currencies, but linked during the Edo period
**Gold: 1 ryō = 4 bu = 16 shu
**Silver: 1 momme = 10 fun = 100 rin (1 ryō = officially 50 momme, market rates fluctuated with supply and demand and the value of the metal minted see Japan&#x27;s Currency at Marteau)
**Copper: 1 kan = 1000 mon (1 ryō = 4000 mon; hence, 1 bu = 1 kan)
*Netherlands — 1 gulden = 20 stuivers = 160 duit = 320 penningen
*Ottoman Empire — 1 kuruş = 40 para = 120 akçe
*Poland — 1 złoty = 30 groszy
*Portugal — 1 real = 840 dinheiros
*Roman Empire — 1 aureus = 25 denarii = 100 sestertii = 400 asses = 1600 quadrantes
*Siam (now Thailand) — 1 tical = 4 salung = 8 fuang = 16 song phai = 32 phai = 64 att = 128 solot
*Spanish Empire — 1 peso = 8 reales (de plata fuerte) = 680 maravedíes (the pesos are the &quot;pieces of eight&quot; often referred to in stories about pirates, such as &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, vellon means the coin minted of an alloy with a low silver content.)
*Switzerland — 1 Gulden Rheinisch = 15 or 16 (later also 17 or 18) Batzen or = 20 Schilling; 1 Batzen = 10 Rappen; 1 Batzen = 4 Kreuzer (in Germany); 1 Schilling = 6 Angster = 12 Heller
*The United Kingdom and many countries formerly part of the British Empire — 1 pound = 4 crowns = 20 shillings = 240 pence = 960 farthings; these were units of account, although many other coins had informal or formal names (see coins of the pound sterling). In medieval England the unit of account was the mark, equivalent to two-thirds of a pound or 160 pence, or 13 shillings and four pence. Half a mark was a noble, equivalent to one-third of a pound or 80 pence, or 6 shillings and eight pence. For some purposes the guinea (21 shillings) was used as a unit of account, and in horse racing (e.g. prize money) guineas are still sometimes used, denoting its decimal equivalent of £1.05.
**Guernsey - 1 Pound = 20 Shillings = 240 Pence = 1920 Doubles

In the Eurozone, in the interval between fixing the conversion factors between national currencies and the euro and the introduction of euro coins, the national currencies were non-decimal subdivisions of the euro.

==Fictional non-decimal currencies==

*Harry Potter: 1 Galleon = 17 Sickles = 493 Knuts
*Pern: Mark, no name for subdivisions, but occurs in denominations of , , , , , 1, 2, 5, and 10 marks (and a few 100 marks for large transactions)
*&quot;Simon the Sorcerer II&quot;: 1 Royal Crest = 5 Silver Sovereigns = 25 Dollars = 50 Queen&#x27;s Shillings = 100 Crowns = 400 Grouts = 6400 Pence, additionally 1 King&#x27;s Shilling = 3 Crowns, and 1 Gold Sovereign = 3 Silver Sovereigns. The currency system is intentionally made inconveniently complex and only ever used at one point of the game.
*&quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;: The Triganic Pu, subdivided into eight Ningis. The Ningi is a &quot;triangular rubber coin six thousand eight hundred miles a side&quot; and hence nobody has ever owned enough Ningis to own one Pu. The Ningi is not negotiable currency, as the banks refuse to deal in small change.
*&quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;: 1 brick of gold-pressed latinum = 20 bars = 400 strips = 40,000 slips.

<doc id="1326731" wikidata="Q5081301" url="?curid=1326731" title="Charles O'Conor (American politician)">
<text>Charles O&#x27;Conor (January 22, 1804 – May 12, 1884) was an American lawyer who was notable for his career as a trial advocate and candidacy in the 1872 presidential election. He was the first Catholic presidential nominee.

Born in New York City, after his father fled Ireland following participation in the Irish Rebellion of 1798, O&#x27;Conor was educated in the city and began to study law at age 16. Admitted to the bar at age 20, O&#x27;Conor developed a reputation as an effective trial attorney, especially in civil cases. A conservative Democrat in politics, he was a longtime friend of Samuel Tilden. He served as a delegate to the 1852 Democratic National Convention, and was United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 1853 to 1854. During the American Civil War, O&#x27;Conor supported the Union. After the war, he served as counsel for Jefferson Davis after Davis was indicted for treason, and helped post Davis&#x27; bail.

In 1871, O&#x27;Conor was among the prominent New Yorkers who played a role in the overthrow of corrupt political boss William M. Tweed. In 1872, he was among the conservative Democrats who refused to support Horace Greeley, the nominee of the Liberal Republicans and the Democrats. He was nominated for president by the Straight-Out Democratic Party, with John Quincy Adams II as his running mate. O&#x27;Conor did not accept the nomination but remained on the ballot and received a scattering of votes, while the election was won easily by incumbent Republican Ulysses S. Grant. O&#x27;Conor was one of Democratic nominee Samuel Tilden&#x27;s lawyers in 1876, when Tilden unsuccessfully contested the results of that year&#x27;s presidential election.

O&#x27;Conor retired in 1881, and settled in Nantucket, Massachusetts. He died there on May 12, 1884, and was buried at St. Patrick&#x27;s Old Cathedral in New York City.

==Early life and family==

O&#x27;Conor was born in New York City, the son of Thomas O&#x27;Conor (1770–1855), a cadet member of the Catholic Gaelic-Irish aristocratic O&#x27;Conor Don family, who after the failed 1798 Rebellion as a sworn in member (sworn in personally by Wolfe Tone of the United Irishmen) in 1801 fled from County Roscommon, Ireland, to New York, where he devoted himself chiefly to journalism. Charles was the great grandson of Charles O&#x27;Conor of Balanagare, was a well known Antiquarian, Writer, and Catholic emancipation during the 18th century.

==Law==
At the age of 16, O&#x27;Conor began to read law, first in the office of Henry W. Stannard, then with Stephen D. Lemoyne, and finally with Joseph D. Fay. O&#x27;Conor attained admission to the bar in 1824, before he had attained the statutory age of 21, and soon won high reputation in his profession.

He brought the Forrest divorce case to a successful issue for his client, Mrs. Forrest. Contending against John Van Buren and other eminent counsel, he secured her a liberal alimony. This case brought him more than ever into national reputation. Two silver vases were presented to him in its commemoration: one was the gift of thirty women of New York, the other was presented by sixty members of the bar. These he bequeathed to the New York Law Institute, and they are now preserved in the library of the institute. In the same library are preserved the bound records of his cases and opinions—a unique collection that was made by himself, and also bequeathed in his will to the institute. These fill over 100 volumes.

Others of his celebrated private cases were the Slave Jack case in 1835, the Lispenard will case in 1843, the Lemmon slave case in 1856, the Parrish will case in 1862, and the Jumel suit in 1871, involving the title to $6,000,000 in real estate. In 1869 he was elected president of the New York Law Institute.

He took a prominent part in the prosecution of Boss Tweed and members of the &quot;Tweed Ring&quot;. This proceeding began in 1871, and eventually destroyed the Tweed Ring that was then at the height of its power in New York City. In the original cases he was associated with William M. Evarts, James Emott, and Wheeler H. Peckham. These suits were brought in the attorney general&#x27;s office, a special branch of which was established for the purpose, and named by him the Bureau of Municipal Correction. In 1875, the court of appeals decided that the cases should have been brought by the city. O&#x27;Conor immediately drafted the Civil Remedies Act, which was enacted at the next session of the legislature, and under which new suits were at once begun. Disheartened with the issue of the first cases, O&#x27;Conor published an account of them, entitled &quot;Peculation Triumphant, being the Record of a Five Years&#x27; Campaign against Official Malversation, A.D. 1871-1875&quot; (New York, 1875). He declined any compensation for his services in the Tweed cases.

==Politics==
In 1848 he became a member of the Directory of the Friends of Ireland, a society that was organized in anticipation of a rising in Ireland, and he presided at some of the meetings in the same year. In this year he was also a candidate on the Democratic ticket for Lieutenant Governor of New York, but was defeated, although he received several thousand more votes than the other candidates of his party.
In 1852, he was a presidential elector on the Democratic ticket, voting for Franklin Pierce. He was United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 1853 to 1854. In politics he supported the States&#x27; rights Democrats and sympathized throughout the American Civil War with the Southern states. After the war he became senior counsel for Jefferson Davis on his indictment for treason. He also appeared upon Davis&#x27;s bond when the latter was admitted to bail. These facts and O&#x27;Conor&#x27;s connection with the Roman Catholic Church affected unfavourably his political fortunes.

In the 1872 U.S. presidential election, O&#x27;Conor was nominated for the presidency by the &quot;Bourbon Democrats&quot; or &quot;Straight-Out Democrats&quot;, who refused to support Horace Greeley, and by the &quot;Labor Reformers&quot;. He declined the nomination, as did his running mate, John Quincy Adams II, but they remained on the ballot anyway and received 21,559 votes. The election was won by incumbent President Ulysses S. Grant of the Republican Party.

In the electoral contest of 1876, he appeared as advocate for the claims of Samuel J. Tilden before the Electoral Commission.

==Retirement==
He built a house at Nantucket, Massachusetts, in 1881, with a fireproof library adjoining it, and lived there until his death in 1884; he is entombed in St. Patrick&#x27;s Old Cathedral, New York City.

==Family==
In 1854, O&#x27;Conor married Mrs. Cornelia (Livingston) McCracken. They had no children, and separated soon after marrying; they lived apart until her death on May 12, 1874.

<text>Point Blank Records is a record label subsidiary of Virgin Records.

Point Blank Records was founded in 1988 by John Wooler. Wooler served as Deputy Head of A&amp;R at Virgin Records UK from 1984 to 1994 and Senior Vice President of Virgin Records US from 1994 to 2002. He had a passion for blues, Americana and soul. His manager, Simon Draper, granted him a small budget to create the label. The first act signed to the record label was Larry McCray followed by Albert Collins and The Kinsey Report. Artists such as John Lee Hooker, Solomon Burke, Pops Staples, John Hammond, Walter &quot;Wolfman&quot; Washington, Van Morrison, and Johnny Winter were later signed to the label as well. Wooler signed all the musicians on the label and produced many of them.

<text>The San Francisco Peaks (Navajo: , , Hopi: &quot;Nuva&#x27;tukya&#x27;ovi&quot;, Western Apache: &quot;Dził Tso&quot;, Keres: &quot;Tsii Bina&quot;, Southern Paiute: &quot;Nuvaxatuh&quot;, Havasupai-Hualapai: &quot;Hvehasahpatch&quot;/&quot;Huassapatch&quot;/&quot;Wik&#x27;hanbaja&quot;, Yavapai: &quot;Wi:mun Kwa&quot;, Zuni: &quot;Sunha K&#x27;hbchu Yalanne&quot;, Mojave: &quot; &#x27;Amat &#x27;Iikwe Nyava&quot;) are a volcanic mountain range in the San Francisco volcanic field in north central Arizona, just north of Flagstaff. The Peaks are the a remnant of the former San Francisco Mountain, a prehistoricaly larger single stratovolcano. The highest summit in the range, Humphreys Peak, is the highest point in the state of Arizona at in elevation. An aquifer within the caldera supplies much of Flagstaff&#x27;s water while the mountain itself is in the Coconino National Forest, a popular recreation site. The Arizona Snowbowl ski area is on the western slopes of Humphreys Peak, and has been the subject of major controversy involving several tribes and environmental groups.

==Geography==


The six highest individual peaks in Arizona are contained in the range:
* Humphreys Peak, 
* Agassiz Peak, 
* Fremont Peak, 
* Aubineau Peak, 
* Rees Peak, 
* Doyle Peak, 

The mountain provides a number of recreational opportunities, including wintertime snow skiing and hiking the rest of the year. Hart Prairie is a popular hiking area and Nature Conservancy preserve located below the mountain&#x27;s ski resort, Arizona Snowbowl.

Humphreys Peak (latitude 35°20&#x27;47&quot; N) and Agassiz Peak (latitude 35°19&#x27;33&quot; N) are the two farthest south-lying mountain peaks in the contiguous United States that rise to a height of more than above sea level.

Around 200,000 years ago, the fully matured San Francisco Mountain is estimated to have been around in altitude. Since then, much of the mountain has been removed to create the &quot;Inner Basin&quot;, a depressed collapse caldera within the outer ring of summits. The missing material may have been removed quickly and explosively by a lateral blast type of eruptive event – similar to the Mount St. Helens to the northeast in a lateral eruption. Alternatively, this may have occurred gradually from landslides, erosion by water and glaciation, or a combination of these with such an eruption.&quot;

==History==
In 1629, 147 years before San Francisco, California, received that name, Spanish friars founded a mission at a Hopi Indian village in honor of St. Francis, 65 miles from the peaks. Seventeenth century Franciscans at Oraibi village gave the name San Francisco to the peaks to honor St. Francis of Assisi, the founder of their order.
The mountain man Antoine Leroux visited the San Francisco Peaks in the mid-1850s, and guided several American expeditions exploring and surveying northern Arizona. Leroux guided them to the only reliable spring, one on the western side of the peaks, which was later named Leroux Springs.

Around 1877, John Willard Young, a son of the Mormon leader Brigham Young, claimed the area around Leroux Springs, and he built Fort Moroni, a log stockade, to house railroad tie-cutters for the Atlantic &amp; Pacific Railroad, which was then being built across northern Arizona.

In 1898, U.S. President William McKinley established the San Francisco Mountain Forest Reserve, at the request of Gifford Pinchot, the head of the U.S. Division of Forestry. The local reaction was hostilecitizens of Williams, Arizona, protested and the &quot;Williams News&quot; editorialized that the reserve &quot;virtually destroys Coconino County.&quot; In 1908, the San Francisco Mountain Forest Reserve became a part of the new Coconino National Forest.

In 2002, Arizona Snowbowl, the ski resort on the peaks, proposed a plan to expand and begin snowmaking using reclaimed water made of treated sewage effluent. A coalition of Indian tribes and environmental groups sued the Coconino National Forest, which leases the land to the ski resort, in an attempt to stop the proposed expansion, citing serious impacts to traditional culture, public health, and the environment. In 2011, construction began on a wastewater pipeline to the peaks. In response, there was an ongoing series of protest actions including demonstrations and lockdowns in which protesters chained themselves to construction equipment. In 2012, a federal appeals court ruled in favor of Arizona Snowbowl, and wastewater to snow conversion began in the 2012–2013 ski season.

==Ecology==
The biologist Clinton Hart Merriam studied these mountains and surrounding areas in 1889, describing a set of six life zones found from the bottom of the Grand Canyon to the summit of the mountains, based on elevation, latitude, and average precipitation. He designated their characteristic flora, as follows:

* Lower Sonoran Zone – Sonoran Desert plants
* Upper Sonoran Zone – pinyon and juniper woodlands
* Transition Zone – ponderosa pine forests
* Canadian Zone – mixed conifer forest
* Hudsonian Zone – spruce-fir or subalpine conifer forest
* Arctic-Alpine Zone – alpine tundra

Merriam considered that these life zones could be extended to cover all the world&#x27;s vegetation types with the addition of only one more zone, the tropical zone.

The San Francisco Peaks themselves contain four of the six life zones. The four life zones that are found along the slopes of the San Francisco Peaks are listed below along with their approximate elevation ranges, dominant tree species found within each of the four life zones, and average annual precipitation of each life zone:
* Ponderosa pine forests – The elevation of the zone ranges from approximately . The dominant tree species is the southwestern ponderosa pine (&quot;Pinus brachyptera&quot; Engel.). Gambel oak (&quot;Quercus gambelii&quot;) is a common associate of the ponderosa pine at lower elevations in the forest along with New Mexico locust (&quot;Robina neomexicana&quot;). At higher elevations, associates include southwestern white pine (&quot;Pinus strobiformis&quot;), Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, (&quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot; var.&quot; glauca&quot;), Rocky Mountain white fir (&quot;Abies concolor&quot; var. &quot;concolor&quot;), and quaking aspen (&quot;Populus tremuloides&quot;). The average annual precipitation in this zone is .
* Mixed conifer forest – The elevation of this zone ranges from approximately . Species such as Douglas-fir (&quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot; var. &quot;glauca&quot;), white fir (&quot;Abies concolor&quot;), limber pine (&quot;Pinus flexilis&quot; var. &quot;reflexa&quot;), blue spruce. (&quot;Picea pungens&quot;), and less commonly Southwestern white pine (&quot;Pinus flexilis&quot;) form mixed stands in this community, with Ponderosa pine (&quot;Pinus brachyptera&quot; Engel.) joining the mix on warmer slopes. The average annual precipitation in the mixed conifer forest is .
* Subalpine conifer forest – The elevation of this zone varies from approximately feet. The dominant tree species of this zone are Engelmann spruce (&quot;Picea engelmannii&quot; subsp. &quot;engelmannii&quot;), corkbark fir (&quot;Abies lasiocarpa&quot; var. &quot;arizonica&quot;), quaking aspen (&quot;Populus tremuloides&quot;) and the Rocky Mountain bristlecone pine. (&quot;Pinus aristata&quot;). The average annual precipitation in the subalpine forest is .
* Alpine tundra – The San Francisco Peaks are the home of the only alpine tundra environment in Arizona, occupying above . Only a few small herbaceous plants have established themselves in the tundra. One of these species, is the endemic and threatened San Francisco Peaks groundsel (&quot;Packera franciscana&quot;), which is found nowhere else in the world. The average annual precipitation in the tundra is .

==In native culture==
The San Francisco Peaks have considerable religious significance to thirteen local American Indian tribes (including the Havasupai, Navajo, Hopi, and Zuni.) In particular, the peaks form the Navajo sacred mountain of the west, called . The peaks are associated with the color yellow, and they are said to contain abalone inside, to be secured to the ground with a sunbeam, and to be covered with yellow clouds and evening twilight. They are gendered female.

For the Hopi people, the San Francisco Peaks are associated with the intercardinal direction southwest. They constitute ritually pure sacred spaces, and are used as sources for ceremonial objects. The alignment of the sunset from the peaks to Hopi villages on Black Mesa is used to calculate the winter solstice, signifying “the beginning of a new year, with a new planting season and new life”. The peaks are seen as the home of the katsinam or kachina spirits, ancestors who have become clouds following their death. &quot;Katsinam&quot; are invited to Hopi villages to serve as ethical and spiritual guides to the Hopi community from midwinter to midsummer. &quot;Aaloosaktukwi&quot; or Humphrey&#x27;s Peak holds particular religious significance and is associated with the deity &quot;Aaloosaka&quot;, a symbol of the Two-Horn Society, a religious group among the Hopi dating to the occupation of the Awat’ovi village on Antelope Mesa. Depiction of the peaks in association with calendar-keeping is attested in a kiva at the Hisatsinom settlement of Homol&#x27;ovi, which was occupied from 1250 to 1425; katsinam imagery dates to the 13th century as well. Other Native American peoples also relate kachina spirits to heavy snowfalls on the peaks.

There are several names for the San Francisco Peaks in local languages:
* –(Navajo) (“Dookʼoʼoosłííd”, which means “the summit that never melts” or “the mountain peak that never thaws”.)
* Nuvaʼtukyaʼovi – (Hopi) (Nuvaʼtukyaʼovi, which means “place-of-snow-on-the-very-top”)
* Dził Tso – Dilzhe’e – (Apache)
* Tsii Bina – Aaʼku – (Acoma)
* Nuvaxatuh – Nuwuvi – (Southern Paiute)
* Hvehasahpatch or &quot;Huassapatch&quot; – Havasu ʼBaaja – (Havasupai)
* Wikʼhanbaja – Hwalʼbay – (Hualapai)
* Wi꞉mun Kwa – Yavapai
* Sunha Kʼhbchu Yalanne – A:shiwi (Zuni)
* ʼAmat ʼIikwe Nyava – Hamakhav – (Mojave)
* Sierra sin Agua – (Spanish)
* The Peaks – (Anglo Arizonans)

<text>Sortes Sanctorum (incipit Post solem surgunt stellae) is a late antique text that was used for divination by means of dice. The oldest version of the text may have been pagan, but the earliest surviving example—a 4th- or 5th-century Greek fragment on papyrus—is Christian. The original version had 216 answers available depending on three ordered throws of a single die. It was later revised down to 56 answers for a single throw of three dice. This version was translated into Latin by the time of the council of Vannes (465), which condemned its use. The Latin version was subsequently revised to render it more acceptable to ecclesiastical authorities. This Latin version survives in numerous manuscripts from the early 9th century through the 16th, as well as in Old Occitan and Old French translations. Beginning in the 13th century, the text was sometimes known as the &quot;Sortes Apostolorum&quot;, a title it shares with at least two other texts.

The term &quot;Sortes Sanctorum&quot; has a long history of being misunderstood and misapplied. It was once believed to be identical with the practice of &quot;sortes biblicae&quot;, whereby one would seek guidance by opening the Bible at random and consulting the verses therein. The mistaken identification seems to have originated with Edward Gibbon in the third volume of his &quot;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, published in 1781.

The title &quot;Sortes Sanctorum&quot; is a reference to &quot;Colossians&quot; 1:12.

<text>Plantation Records was a country music record label of the 1960s and 1970s helmed by Shelby Singleton. The label is best known for Jeannie C. Riley&#x27;s 1968 hit &quot;Harper Valley PTA&quot;, which topped both the country and &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts.

The label established Riley as one of the major country female vocalists of the late 1960s and early 1970s with a string of hits for the label and also topping the Billboard country album chart with the &quot;Harper Valley PTA&quot; album. Grand Ole Opry star Ray Pillow had light success on the label with one top 40 country hit in 1969. David Allan Coe&#x27;s first two albums were on the Plantation label; &quot;Penitentiary Blues&quot; and &quot;Requiem for a Harlequin&quot;, before moving on to a major recording career at Columbia Records. Linda Martell became the first African-American female vocalist to record specifically for the country market, enjoying two top 40 country hits on Plantation in 1969–70 including the second hit version of &quot;Before The Next Teardrop Falls&quot; which peaked at No. 33. Martell later left the label citing her belief that Singleton&#x27;s choosing of the name Plantation Records was racist (although he denied this) and his decision to focus on Riley&#x27;s career at the expense of hers. Additionally, she explained that, when she attempted to sign to other record labels, something that was permitted as she had fulfilled her one year contract with Plantation, Singleton threatened to sue the record companies, causing her to be blackballed from country music and forcing her into complete retirement from the music industry. Other artists on Plantation included Harlow Wilcox and Dee Mullins.

After Riley left in 1972, the label&#x27;s prominence declined, but it survived into the early 1980s. In the late 1970s the label signed a number of veteran country performers to the label including Webb Pierce, Jimmie Davis, Jimmy C. Newman, Hank Locklin, Charlie Walker, Dave Dudley, Leroy Van Dyke, Patti Page, and Roy Drusky though few of these records charted. Broadway star Carol Channing also recorded two albums for the label in duet performances with Pierce, Newman, and Locklin.

Singleton established at least two other labels (SSS International and Amazon), and helped comedian Bill Cosby form a short-lived label, Tetragrammaton Records, in the late 1960s. He purchased Sun Records from Sam Phillips in 1969.

After retiring from rugby, Beattie moved on from civil engineering and retrained as a chartered accountant, before moving into broadcasting in 1995.

He works as a commentator or presenter for rugby on television and radio. He hosts a lunchtime show of news, comment and discussion on BBC Radio Scotland, and is a host of the sports magazine programme &quot;Sport Nation&quot; on both radio and TV.

He writes a rugby blog on the BBC&#x27;s rugby union website, and has written for The Herald, Sunday Herald and Scottish Rugby Magazine.

In 2003 Beattie was chairman of the Scottish government physical activity taskforce to improve the health of the nation through exercise and oversaw a review in 2008, &#x27;Let&#x27;s Make Scotland More Active&#x27;.

In 2010, Radio Scotland announced that he would host the &quot;John Beattie Show&quot;, a 75-minute show four days a week.

Since 2019, Beattie serves as a presenter on BBC Scotland&#x27;s news programme &quot;The Nine&quot;.

In 2024, he joined the news presenting team at BBC News Reporting Scotland as relief presenter. 

==Personal life==

Beattie&#x27;s son, Johnnie, is also a Scottish international rugby player, who has won 38 caps since 2006. One of his daughters, Jen, plays football for Scotland, having won more than 100 caps, and Arsenal and previously for Celtic F.C. Women.

In 2004, Beattie was a candidate for Rector of the University of Glasgow.

In 2015 Abertay University awarded him an honorary doctorate. He received another honorary doctorate from the University of Glasgow one year later.

<text>Wesley Paul Butters (born 4 May 1979) is a radio broadcaster, formerly of BBC Radio 1, and writer.

==Early life==
Butters attended Buile Hill High School in Pendleton, Salford, and studied at the University of Salford between 1995 and 1997, where he gained a National Diploma in Design &amp; Media Communications, followed by a BA (Hons) Radio between 1997 and 1998.

==Radio career==
On joining AA Roadwatch he shortened his name to Wes Butters. After a year presenting traffic and travel bulletins on local North West radio stations and periods on 96.5 Radio Wave (Blackpool), Wish FM (Wigan) and Century 105, he was offered the evening show on Century 106 in Nottingham. He left the station in 2000 to move to Newcastle as head of music and mid-morning presenter for Galaxy North East.

===Radio 1===
In February 2003 Butters took over as host of &quot;The Radio 1 Chart Show&quot; on BBC Radio 1, and the programme was renamed &quot;The Official Chart Show with Wes&quot;. A change in the show&#x27;s format led to greater coverage of top-selling albums and an end to the need for every entry in the Top 40 singles chart to be played.

He regularly stood in for Scott Mills – first on early breakfast, then on drive-time. He also deputised for Chris Moyles on the Radio 1 breakfast show on bank holidays and at Christmas.

Working closely with &quot;Top of the Pops,&quot; he interviewed hundreds of pop stars including Kylie Minogue, Destiny&#x27;s Child, George Michael and The Black Eyed Peas.

In February 2005 Butters left Radio 1 and the chart show underwent further changes to its format.

Butters was regularly heard on the BBC World Service as well. He sat in for Steve Wright on &quot;Wright Round the World&quot; and was used as their voice for Live 8.

===After Radio 1===

Soon after his final chart rundown on 30 January 2005 the press announced the launch of podshows.com, a joint venture by Butters and fellow broadcaster Daryl Denham. It was the world&#x27;s first professional podcasting company, using presenters such as Tony Blackburn, Paul Gambaccini, Gary Davies and Terry Christian to record tailor-made programmes for MP3 players.

===Wes@Breakfast===

In October 2005 Butters agreed a deal with Galaxy and returned to the airwaves at Galaxy Manchester, winning a Silver Sony award for Best Breakfast Show and an Arqiva nomination for Best UK Presenter in 2006.

In May 2007 he was voted North West England Presenter of the Year in the radio industry magazine &quot;X-Trax&quot;.

It was announced in June 2007 that Wes had &quot;had enough of early starts&quot; and that he wanted more time to focus on his other projects. Keen to keep him on the station he agreed with Galaxy to do a short afternoon show but in April 2008 he revealed that he would leave the group completely.

At the end of July 2008 Wes enjoyed another stint on breakfast, this time sitting in for Shaun Keaveny on BBC 6 Music.

===Radio 4 Extra===
Manager Simon Jordan invited Wes to join BBC Radio 7 in May 2009 as one of the station&#x27;s continuity announcers. He remained after its revamp to BBC Radio 4 Extra, where he continues to introduce a range of comedy and drama from the BBC&#x27;s archive.

===BBC Radio Leeds===
In October 2011, Butters was announced as BBC Radio Leeds&#x27; new mid-morning presenter. His programme, which contained phone ins, real-life stories, consumer issues and political interviews, became the highest rated on the station.

A forthright style when interviewing politicians led to national news coverage, as in the case of Labour MP George Mudie who admitted he would vote for an independent Scotland despite his party being part of the Better Together campaign.

Butters left in October 2014, referring in a statement to Kenny Everett who famously abandoned parties as they were just getting going.

===Bauer City Network===
In 2016, Butters signed to host a weekly network show for Bauer City 1 broadcasting on Key 103, CFM, Free Radio, Hallam FM, Metro Radio, Radio Aire, Radio City, Rock FM, TFM and Viking FM.
And in August 2017, he replaced Paddy McGuinness as host of Sunday mornings.

===Hits Radio Network===
As of 2020, Butters hosts the drive-time slot across the Hits Radio Network alongside Gemma Atkinson. He also presents Sunday Breakfast across the Hits Radio Network alongside Sheree Murphy.

As of 2025, Butters hosts the Weekend Breakfast on Hits Radio, Taking over Sunday Breakfast from Mary Mandefield, Expanding his show onto Saturday and Sunday from 6am to 9am.

==Television and writing==
Butters has appeared on many TV programmes including &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;, &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, &quot;Liquid News&quot;, &quot;Celebrity Fame Academy&quot;, &quot;Record of the Year&quot;, Jacques Peretti&#x27;s &quot;50 Years of Bad Sex&quot;, &quot;Carry On Forever&quot; and BBC television news, in addition to a range of children&#x27;s programmes. As a voice-over, he has been heard on &quot;An Audience with Take That&quot;, &quot;An Audience with Lionel Richie&quot; and &quot;The Brit Awards&quot;, as well as the &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; rundown and ads for Asda. He also appeared as himself announcing Billy Mack - the character played by Bill Nighy - as the Christmas number one in Richard Curtis&#x27; 2003 romantic comedy &quot;Love Actually&quot;.

Butters has written for a number of newspapers (including &quot;The Guardian&quot;), while his debut book, a biography of &quot;Carry On&quot; actor Kenneth Williams, came out in October 2008. Published by HarperCollins, &quot;Kenneth Williams Unseen&quot; was selected by Roger Lewis as one of &quot;The Daily Express&quot; Books of the Year. He also wrote the two-part documentary &quot;The Pain of Laughter – The Last Days of Kenneth Williams&quot; for BBC Radio 4, broadcast in April 2008, which is available on his website.

On its release in May 2010, his second book, &quot;Whatshisname, The Life and Death of Charles Hawtrey&quot;, was the number one selling biography on Amazon.

==Personal life==
*He has a daughter, to whom both of his books are dedicated.
*He has a fiancé who he proposed to in New York in 2019.
*He suffers from colitis and often speaks of the condition to help raise awareness and his &quot;fellow sufferers&quot;.

<text>RTL Zwei (stylised as RTLZWEI), formerly spelled RTL 2 and RTL II, is a German-language television channel that is operated by &quot;RTL2 Television GmbH &amp; Co. KG&quot;. RTL2 is a private general entertainment &quot;(Vollprogramm)&quot; tv channel on the basis of the Interstate Broadcasting Agreement &quot;(Rundfunkstaatsvertrag)&quot;. Variants of the channel are produced for Austria and Switzerland, with their own advertising. They can be received via cable networks in Austria and Switzerland, and more widely by digital satellite. RTL Zwei is part-owned by RTL Group in Germany.

==History==
RTL II was originally scheduled to begin broadcasting on 26 September 1992; some TV guides were anticipating the channel&#x27;s launch. However, the channel&#x27;s launch was delayed until 1993 because LPR Hessen (known as the &quot;Hessische Landesanstalt für privaten Rundfunk&quot;) repeatedly raised concerns about the channel&#x27;s shareholder structure to German media authorities. The shares of the channel&#x27;s initial owners (RTL Television, CLT, Bertelsmann, Burda and FAZ) had to be reduced to below 25% before the licence for the channel could be awarded to RTL. The channel eventually started broadcasting on 6 March 1993 at 6:09 a.m., using what used to be Screensport&#x27;s transponder. (Screensport ceased operations five days earlier as a result of its merger with Eurosport) on the Astra satellite service. The first programme on the channel was the movie &quot;Little Miss Marker&quot;.

In 2000, RTL II began broadcasting the shows &quot;Popstars&quot; and &quot;Big Brother&quot;. &quot;Popstars&quot; ran on the channel for two seasons before it moved to ProSieben, while &quot;Big Brother&quot; continued to air until 2011.

The network began offering a video on demand service in February 2012.

As of 7 October 2019, the channel was rebranded as &quot;RTLZWEI&quot;. The number &quot;2&quot; was spelt out for the first time in the station&#x27;s history. The design was developed with the agency &quot;mehappy GmbH&quot;.

===Visual identity (logos)===
==Ownership==
The channel is operated by RTL2 TV GmbH &amp; Co. KG, which was founded in 1992 and employs around 210 people. Andreas Bartl has been managing director since June 2014. The company was originally headquartered in Cologne, but is now run from the municipality of Grünwald, to the south of Munich; only its news department is still based in Cologne, in order to share RTL news production facilities. The company is jointly owned by RTL Group S.A. (35.9%), Bauer Media Group (31.5%), Tele-Munich Television Media Participation LP (31.5%, of which the Leonine Holding and The Walt Disney Company hold 50% each). and Hubert Burda Media (1.1%)

==Programming==
Programming pillars are daily episodes of the local &quot;Big Brother&quot; in access prime-time, and a prime-time lineup consisting mostly of docu soaps, movies and licensed series such as &quot;24&quot; and &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;. Recent efforts to move further towards quality programming with science magazine shows and documentaries have met with an indifferent audience response.

The channel&#x27;s prime-time newscast &quot;RTL II News&quot; is frequently criticized for its selection of news stories, which cater to a younger audience; for example, it has been known to put a CD release or the launch of a new gaming console in the second headline slot directly after the day&#x27;s top event. This unconventional approach has brought RTL II&#x27;s broadcasting licence into jeopardy at least once, as a German commercial broadcaster has to feature minimum amounts of serious information and culture programming to be allowed a full channel licence. In addition to its own news programmes (&quot;RTL II News&quot;, &quot;RTL II Spezial. Das Magazin&quot; and &quot;Das Nachrichtenjournal&quot;), the channel commissions shows from independent producers which air in the afternoons.

=== Afternoon programming ===
In the afternoon, the channel now primarily features its own docu soap and reality show productions.

=== Prime-time ===
Among its prime-time line-up the channel&#x27;s own docu soap productions such as &quot;Die Geissens – Eine schrecklich glamouröse Familie&quot; and &quot;Frauentausch&quot; are particularly successful. Various US shows such as &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; and &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; have been the most successful series of RTL II&#x27;s prime-time slot. Its late-night line-up also featured North American series such as &quot;Autopsie – Mysteriöse Todesfälle&quot; and &quot;Flashpoint&quot;.

=== Anime and children&#x27;s programming ===
RTL II has offered the largest anime content of all free-to-air German-language TV channels. It aired about over 80 Anime series and also broadcast cartoons. On weekdays, RTL II also aired an anime afternoon in their children/youth &quot;Pokito&quot; slot. Following tensions with media authorities, RTL II&#x27;s standards and practices department was believed to be especially sensitive about children&#x27;s programming. As a consequence, the channel has cut scenes from anime series like Detective Conan, InuYasha, One Piece and Naruto, for which it has received criticism from anime fans. Even some episodes where the original version had previously been given a FSK 6 rating, meaning that it was suitable for children ages 6 up and may legally be aired at all hours of the day, have been edited down. In February 2013, RTL II announced that its Sunday morning children&#x27;s programme would be discontinued as of 21 April 2013. A separate and short-lived online channel for anime was launched in April.

=== German premieres ===
RTL II was the first channel to introduce various foreign TV formats on German television such as:

*&quot;The Final Countdown&quot;: a show aired at the start of the new millennium lasting 24 hours and showing celebrations in various locations all over the world.
*&quot;Popstars&quot; in 2000 was the first casting show aired on German television.
*&quot;Jack Point Jack&quot; in 2003 was the first interactive movie on German television.
*Bollywood movies: On 19 November 2004 RTL II aired Sometimes happiness, sometimes sadness (German: In guten wie in schweren Tagen - original title: Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham), the first dubbed Bollywood movie on German television, and achieved an audience share of over 12.3% among the target group of 14- to 49-year-olds. Due to its great success Indian movies have been regularly aired on the channel ever since. Previously, Bollywood movies had been broadcast in Hindi with German subtitles on ARTE and VOX.

==Audience share==
===Germany===

The average age of the viewers is 43.5 years (as of 2016).

<text>Amalgam Comics was a collaborative publishing imprint shared by DC Comics and Marvel Comics, in which the two comic book publishers merged their characters into new ones (e.g., the DC Comics character Batman and the Marvel Comics character Wolverine became the Amalgam Comics character the Dark Claw). These characters first appeared in a series of 12 one-shots which were published in April 1996 between &quot;Marvel Comics versus DC&quot; #3 and &quot;DC versus Marvel Comics&quot; #4, the last two issues of the &quot;DC vs. Marvel&quot; crossover event. A second set of 12 one-shots followed one year later in June 1997, but without the crossover event as a background. All 24 of these one-shots took place between the aforementioned issues of &quot;DC vs. Marvel Comics&quot;.

&quot;Marvel Encyclopedia: Fantastic Four&quot; (2004) originally designated the Amalgam Universe as Earth-962 in the Marvel Multiverse, then &quot;The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Alternate Universes 2005&quot; re-designated it as Earth-9602. Page 436 of the book &quot;The Essential Wonder Woman Encyclopedia&quot; (2015) by Phil Jimenez and John Wells (under the entry &quot;Wallis, Angelica&quot; in the &quot;W&quot; section) designated the Amalgam Universe as Earth-496 in the DC Multiverse. In &quot;Dark Crisis: Big Bang&quot; #1 (February 2023), it was re-designated as Earth 1996.

== Publication history ==
On two separate occasions – April 1996 and June 1997 – DC and Marvel co-published a total of 24 one-shot &quot;first issues&quot; (12 in April 1996 (six by DC and six by Marvel) and 12 in June 1997 (again, six by DC and six by Marvel)) under the imprint &quot;Amalgam Comics&quot;. The issues were all presented as if the &quot;company&quot; had existed for decades, with stories and editorial comments referring to a fictional history stretching back to the Golden Age of Comic Books, including retcons and reboots; for example, they referred to &quot;Secret Crisis of the Infinity Hour&quot; (an amalgamation of Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars&quot;, DC&#x27;s &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, Marvel&#x27;s &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot;, and DC&#x27;s &quot;Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!&quot;, respectively), which featured the well-known cover of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; #7, but with Super-Soldier holding the dead body of his teenage sidekick the American Girl (an amalgamation of DC&#x27;s Supergirl and Marvel&#x27;s Carol Danvers and James Buchanan &quot;Bucky&quot; Barnes) instead of Superman holding the dead body of Supergirl. Nineteen of the 24 issues included phony letter columns to provide the illusion of background to the stories, with the fans&#x27; hometowns formed by amalgamating the names of existing American cities.

The first Amalgam event occurred near the end of the four-issue &quot;DC vs. Marvel&quot; crossover event in April 1996. In &quot;Marvel Comics versus DC&quot; #3, the DC and Marvel Universes were shown being combined into one – the Amalgam Universe – and the Amalgam one-shots were presented as the result of this. The first 12 Amalgam titles were released the following week, delaying both publishers&#x27; regular releases by one week. Six of the issues in the event were published by DC and six by Marvel. In June 1997 the process was repeated, but without the crossover event as a background. Later, both publishers collected their respective 12 issues into four trade paperback collections. All 24 of the Amalgam one-shots took place between &quot;Marvel Comics versus DC&quot; #3 and &quot;DC versus Marvel Comics&quot; #4, the last two issues of the crossover event.

Between the two events of Amalgam Comics, the two publishers released a sequel crossover miniseries to &quot;DC vs. Marvel&quot; #1–4 primarily published by DC, &quot;DC/Marvel: All Access&quot; #1–4 (Dec. 1996–Feb. 1997 (issues #2 and 3 were both cover dated Jan. 1997)). A second sequel crossover miniseries primarily published by Marvel, &quot;Unlimited Access&quot; #1–4 (Dec. 1997–March 1998), followed the second event. Both crossover miniseries featured additional Amalgam characters.

== Fictional origin of the Amalgam Universe ==
The two comic book universes came together when the two cosmic beings who were the physical incarnations of their respective universes (referred to as &quot;the Brothers&quot;) became aware of each other after eons of slumber. To prevent the Brothers from destroying each other, characters from each universe battled to determine which universe would survive (a real world vote by readers of the series was conducted to determine the outcome of five of the in-comic battles, with three of them favoring the Marvel hero). Access, a new character created specifically for the event and co-owned by both DC and Marvel, served as a gatekeeper who became stuck while traveling between the two universes.

When the battles were finished, neither universe was willing to go. To prevent their total destruction, the Spectre and the Living Tribunal created an amalgamated universe, in which only Access and Doctor Strangefate (Charles Xavier) (an amalgamation of Doctor Fate, Doctor Strange and Professor X) knew the truth about the merge. The two characters fought against each other either to reverse the change (in the case of Access) or to preserve it (in the case of Doctor Strangefate).

Access managed to separate the Brothers with the help of the Amalgam Universe&#x27;s superheroes; before the merge had taken place, he had planted shards of the two universes inside Batman and Captain America. Once he discovered the Dark Claw (an amalgamation of Batman and Wolverine) and Super-Soldier (an amalgamation of Superman and Captain America), he used those shards to give the Spectre and the Living Tribunal the power to restore the two universes. Batman, Captain America and Access were thus able to make the Brothers realize that their conflict was pointless and the two universes were separated once again.

== Amalgam Comics characters ==

During the crossover event, pairs of DC and Marvel characters were merged into single characters. The same was done with teams and fictional locations.

== Amalgam Comics comic books ==

<text>Forrest Clare &quot;Phog&quot; Allen (November 18, 1885 – September 16, 1974) was an American basketball coach and physician. Known as the &quot;Father of Basketball Coaching,&quot; he served as the head basketball coach at Baker University (1905–1908), the University of Kansas (1907–1909, 1919–1956), Haskell Institute—now Haskell Indian Nations University (1908–1909), and Warrensburg Teachers College—now the University of Central Missouri (1912–1919), compiling a career college basketball head coaching record of 746–264. In his 39 seasons at the helm of the Kansas Jayhawks men&#x27;s basketball program, his teams won 24 conference championships and three national titles.

The Helms Athletic Foundation retroactively recognized Allen&#x27;s 1921–22 and 1922–23 Kansas teams as national champions. Allen&#x27;s 1951–52 squad won the 1952 NCAA tournament and his Jayhawks were runners-up in the NCAA Tournament in 1940 and 1953. His 590 wins are the second most of any coach in the history of the storied Kansas basketball program.

Allen attended the University of Kansas, having already acquired the nickname &quot;Phog&quot; for the distinctive foghorn voice he had as a baseball umpire. At KU, Allen was a member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. 

He lettered in baseball and basketball, the latter under James Naismith, the inventor of the game. Allen served as the head football coach at Warrensburg Teachers College from 1912 to 1917 and at Kansas for one season in 1920, amassing a career college football head coaching record of 34–19–3. He also coached baseball at Kansas for two seasons, in 1941 and 1942, tallying a mark of 6–17–1, and was the university&#x27;s athletic director from 1919 to 1937.

Allen was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame with the inaugural class of 1959.The home basketball arena at the University of Kansas, Allen Fieldhouse, was named in his honor when it opened in 1955. His final season at Kansas was the first full season the Jayhawks played at Allen Fieldhouse.

==Early life==
Allen was born in the town of Jamesport, Missouri. His father, William Allen, was among the 30 people who originally incorporated Jameson, Missouri in 1879 and the doctor who delivered Allen lived in James. However, he had strong ties to Jamesport where he was town clerk, collector, and constable. His family later moved to Independence, Missouri.

James Naismith, the man who created basketball, coached Allen from 1905 to 1907 at the University of Kansas in Lawrence. Allen spent his last two years on school (1907–09) as the team&#x27;s coach. Naismith inspired Phog Allen to pursue a medical degree as well. After two years of coaching, Allen took a three-year break to complete his degree at Kansas City&#x27;s Central College of Osteopathy (now Kansas City University College of Osteopathic Medicine). After graduating from medical school, Allen integrated numerous concepts of healthy eating, efficient exercise regimens, and proper body alignment into his coaching. A section on sports medicine was included in his book, &quot;My Basket-Ball Bible&quot;. Among the many elite athletes he treated at his downtown office at 13 E. 8th St. was Mickey Mantle.

==Playing career==
Allen began classes at the University of Kansas in 1904, where he lettered three years in basketball under James Naismith&#x27;s coaching, and two years in baseball. Unlike his time as a coach, the Jayhawks struggled on the court. In his three seasons as a player, the team only had one winning season. He was a player for the team for the Jayhawks&#x27; first games in their rivalries against Kansas State and Missouri. In 1905 he also played for the Kansas City Athletic Club. At Kansas, he was a member of Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity. 

==Coaching career==
===Basketball===
Allen coached at William Chrisman High School (then known as Independence High School) in Independence, Missouri, the University of Kansas, Baker University, Haskell Institute, and Warrensburg Teachers College in Warrensburg, Missouri.

Allen launched his coaching career at his alma mater in 1907, but took a hiatus after graduating in 1909 to study osteopathic medicine at Central College of Osteopathy in Kansas City, Missouri. Known as “Doc” to his players and students, he was reputed to be a colorful figure on the University of Kansas campus, coaching all sports and becoming known for his osteopathic manipulation techniques for ailing athletes.

Allen was a legend in the field of treatment of athletic injuries and benefited a long list of high-profile performers. He also had a successful private osteopathic practice, and many he treated, the famous and otherwise, contended he had a &quot;magic touch&quot; for such ailments as bad backs, knees and ankles. He said he applied the same treatments to &quot;civilians&quot; as he did to his athletes.

His forceful, yet reasonable, disposition helped him become the driving force behind the acceptance of basketball as an official Olympic sport at the 1936 Summer Olympic Games. Allen later worked as an assistant coach in the 1952 Summer Olympics, helping to lead the United States to the gold medal in Helsinki, Finland.

He coached college basketball for 50 seasons, and compiled a 746–264 record, retiring with the all-time record for most coaching wins in college basketball history at the time. During his tenure at Kansas, Allen coached Dutch Lonborg, Adolph Rupp, Ralph Miller and Dean Smith, all future Hall of Fame coaches. He also coached John Bunn, who is a member of the Hall of Fame and did go on to coach at Stanford, but he is honored as a contributor to the game of basketball. 

Additional former players that make up Allen&#x27;s coaching tree who coached at the collegiate level but are not enshrined in the Hall of Fame include Frosty Cox, George E. Rody, Andrew McDonald, Charlie T. Black, Howard Engleman and his replacement upon retirement Dick Harp. Among the Hall of Fame players he coached were Paul Endacott, Bill Johnson, and Clyde Lovellette. He also recruited Wilt Chamberlain to Kansas, and even coached former United States Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. Allen Fieldhouse, the basketball arena on the campus of the University of Kansas, is named in his honor. A banner that hangs in the rafters of Allen Fieldhouse reads: &quot;Pay heed all who enter, beware of the Phog.&quot; He was enshrined as part of the inaugural class in the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1959.

Allen also created the National Association of Basketball Coaches, which went on to create the NCAA tournament.

===Football===
====Warrensburg====
Allen coached the football team at Warrensburg Teacher&#x27;s College, now known as University of Central Missouri. At Warrensburg, he coached for six seasons. The team won their conference title each of his first four seasons as coach. He left after the 1917 and focused on his basketball coaching duties. He finished his time at the school with a 29–17–2 record.

====Kansas====
Allen was hired as the coach for the Jayhawks football team in 1920. The Jayhawks began the season 5–0, including a 14–0 victory over rival Kansas State. Kansas would lose 2 of their last 3 games and tie the other game to finish the season 5–2–1. They finished 3rd in the MVIAA. Allen resigned at the conclusion of the season to focus on his duties as the men&#x27;s basketball coach, coaching only one season for the football program.

<doc id="1326784" wikidata="Q5022186" url="?curid=1326784" title="Calling card (crime)">
<text>In criminology, a calling card is a particular object sometimes left behind by a criminal at a scene of a crime, often as a way of taunting police or claiming responsibility. The name is derived from the cards that people used to leave when they went to visit someone&#x27;s house and the resident was absent. A calling card can also be used as an individual&#x27;s way of telling someone they are alive after they have run away or disappeared without revealing themselves or having direct contact with that person. It is often left at a bed side table while the person is asleep, at the living room floor and sometimes even at a grave yard if they know the times someone goes to visit their loved ones. However, some criminals choose not to leave a calling card, as it may be used by authorities or detectives to trace the criminal, and eventually arrest them.

==Historical examples==
* Jack the Ripper is believed to have left two calling cards by Goulston Street, London on September 30, 1888, the night he murdered Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes: a scrap of Eddowes&#x27; apron and some graffiti reading &quot;Juwes are the men That Will not be Blamed for nothing&quot;. Some authors believe the graffiti may have already been there prior to the apron piece being dropped and that the two should not be linked.
* The 1968 Zodiac Killer in San Francisco would mail cryptograms to the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; made up of letters and zodiac signs, signed with a sun cross.
* The Washington, D.C. Beltway sniper attacks in 2002 were linked by a series of Tarot cards left by the snipers, which contained messages for the policemen investigating the crimes.

==Examples in fiction==

* In the 1919–1920 Fritz Lang adventure film series &quot;The Spiders&quot; a spider was the calling card for the criminal organization known as &#x27;The Spiders&#x27;.
*In the 1905 West End play, the Scarlet Pimpernel leaves a calling card (a scarlet pimpernel) at each of his interventions.

After being awakened, Zanetti discovers that his former wife Helen has married his former colleague Mac McClellan. MacClellan falsely claims that Zanetti&#x27;s family was killed in the accident that created him and makes him battle the interdimensional Rifters.

In &quot;&quot;, Breach is killed by Monarch. He returns as a Black Lantern in &quot;Blackest Night&quot; before Superboy-Prime kills him.

Breach&#x27;s son, Tim Zanetti Jr., later joins the military-funded Project 7734 under the command of Sam Lane.

<text>Philips Records is a record label founded by Dutch electronics company Philips and Dutch-American music corporation Universal Music Group. It was founded as Philips Phonographische Industrie in 1950. In 1946, Philips acquired the company which pressed records for British Decca&#x27;s Dutch outlet in Amsterdam.

==History==
The record label originated as &quot;Philips Phonographische Industrie&quot; (PPI) in June 1950 when it began issuing classical music recordings. Recordings were also made of popular artists of multiple nationalities and of classical artists from Germany, France and the Netherlands. Launched under the slogan &quot;Records of the Century&quot; (referring to Philips Industries&#x27; UK Head Office at Century House, W1), the first releases in Britain appeared in January 1953 on 10&quot; 78 rpm discs, with LPs appearing in July 1954.

Philips also distributed recordings made by the United States Columbia Records (which at the time was a unit of CBS) in the UK and on the European continent. After the separation of the English Columbia label (owned by EMI) and American Columbia, Philips also started distributing original Columbia recordings on the Philips label in the UK.

The first batch of eight singles releases in 1953 included British artists such as Gilbert Harding, Flanagan and Allen and Gracie Fields, followed by American Columbia recording artists Jo Stafford, Frankie Laine and Johnnie Ray. The first single on the label to chart was Frankie Laine&#x27;s &quot;I Believe&quot;, which reached the No. 1 chart position in the UK that April. Many of the first British recordings on the label were produced by Norman Newell until John Franz was appointed artists and repertoire (A&amp;R) manager in 1954.

In 1958, Philips created a subsidiary label, Fontana Records, which meant that American-Columbia recordings were being issued on both the Philips and Fontana labels. This arrangement lasted until April 1962, when, under pressure from Columbia in America, Philips then created a third label for them, CBS Records (it could not name the label Columbia as the copyright for that name had long been owned by EMI). In late 1964, under the stewardship of U.S. President of Columbia Records Goddard Lieberson, CBS Records formed its own international operations, adopting the name of its then parent CBS. CBS Records set up their UK operation in Theobalds Road in Holborn. Singles and albums on the Philips and Fontana labels by Columbia-owned product were subsequently deleted from the catalogue.

In 1962, Philips Records and Deutsche Grammophon formed the Grammophon-Philips Group joint venture (GPG), which later became PolyGram in 1972. UK pressings were manufactured at the company&#x27;s large factory based at Walthamstow in N.E. London.

In 1961, after Philips lost its US and Canadian distribution deal with Columbia Records, it entered an exchange agreement with Mercury Records. A year later, Philips&#x27; US affiliate Consolidated Electronics Industries Corp. (a.k.a. Conelco), bought Mercury and its subsidiary labels, such as Smash. Philips classical, jazz and pop records were now marketed by Mercury in the US under the Philips label. The Mercury Living Presence team also made classical recordings for Philips, in July 1961. These records, made in Walthamstow Town Hall near London, included Liszt piano concertos by Sviatoslav Richter and the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Kiril Kondrashin; two albums of symphonic &quot;bon-bons&quot; by the London Symphony Orchestra and Charles Mackerras released as &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot;; &quot;Russian Song Recital&quot; by Galina Vishnevskaya and Mstislav Rostropovich; and Beethoven sonata op. 69 for cello and piano by Richter and Rostropovich. The Richter Liszt album was recorded on 3-track 35mm magnetic film and was reissued on CD from a remaster made from the film by original producer Wilma Cozart Fine, (wife of the recording engineer Bob) as part of the Philips Solo series.

Classical groups that Philips heavily recorded included the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, the Beaux Arts Trio, and the Quartetto Italiano. Violinist Arthur Grumiaux and the pianist Claudio Arrau were under contract to Philips. Symphony orchestras under contract, including the LSO, were under the command of prestigious young conductors such as Colin Davis and Bernard Haitink.

From 1961 until the late 1980s, Philips Records (USA) issued many classical titles in US-specific packaging, initially in the same glossy-laminated covers as Mercury Records. The records were pressed at Mercury&#x27;s plant in Richmond, Indiana, and mastered in New York by George Piros at Fine Recording, using 2-track and mono master tapes provided by Philips. These releases were the PHS 900 xxx series for stereo and the 500 xxx series for mono. Clair Van Ausdal in Mercury&#x27;s New York office oversaw the Philips classical US releases through the mid-1960s.

Philips also launched an eponymous jazz label in the US, releasing both imported European Philips recordings and making new American recordings of Gerry Mulligan, Dizzy Gillespie and Woody Herman, among others. These records were made through Mercury&#x27;s existing jazz operations and produced by Jack Tracy and others.

In addition to jazz and classical music, Philips also became a major label in the world of rock and pop music in the late 1950s until late 1970s. In the UK, Philips developed a strong popular music roster, signing acts like Marty Wilde, Roy Castle, Anne Shelton, the Four Pennies, the Springfields, Dusty Springfield, and the Walker Brothers. The American pop label was launched in 1962 starting with the R&amp;B single &quot;Gee Baby&quot; by Ben &amp; Bea as well as folk-country, like &quot;Makes You Wanna Sigh&quot; by Ross Legacy in 1969. It signed the Four Seasons in 1964. It also played a part in promoting the garage rock genre and the psychedelic rock genre in the mid to late 1960s, their most successful signing being Blue Cheer.

In the UK during the 1960s and 1970s, Philips turned its attention more to the growing MOR market with artists like Lena Zavaroni, Peters and Lee, Nana Mouskouri and Demis Roussos, as well as issuing novelty records by media personalities like Ed Stewart, Bruce Forsyth, Dave Allen and Chris Hill. In 1970, Philips, Fontana, Mercury Records, and the newly formed Vertigo Records were amalgamated into a new company called Phonogram. In Europe, however, Philips was used on a major basis and it became the outlet for Sire Records in America and distributed a number of punk and new wave bands like Talking Heads, the Ramones, and Radio Birdman, who were signed from Australia. It also released some disco records by Donna Summer and the Village People, as their home label Casablanca Records was not cleared for use in all countries around the world. Another important American label signing for the UK was Avco Records, which provided Phonogram with one of their best-selling U.S. acts, the Stylistics. By late 1979 Phonogram signed Dire Straits to the Vertigo label. The band sold huge numbers of records all over Europe and were chosen to promote the initial release of CDs in 1985, with a nationwide road tour in association with Philips/Sony Industries.

By 1980, PolyGram consolidated all of its U.S. operations, Phonogram, Inc. Mercury Records, RSO, Casablanca and Polydor Records and associated labels into PolyGram Records and it was based in New York City. Under the new company, PolyGram decided to discontinue Philips as a pop and rock label in the UK and throughout much of Europe, though it still frequently issued records in France and South East Asia by Chinese and Hong Kong pop artists. The majority of PolyGram&#x27;s rock and pop music signings went to Mercury, and Polydor in the UK and Europe, though the label was used sparingly in America. Philips became part of PolyGram Classics as a classical music label along with Decca Records and Deutsche Grammophon. Most artists were moved to Mercury Records or other local PolyGram-owned labels.

From the early 1970s, Philips classical records were no longer being produced in the US; rather they were made in the Netherlands and sold as imports in the American market. Philips reissued a group of Mercury Living Presence titles as &quot;Mercury Golden Imports&quot;, with manufacture in the Netherlands and masters cut from 2-track production tapes, as opposed to the original-issue method of mixing stereo LPs directly from the edited 3-track master tapes and films.

In the 1980s, Philips Classics Records was formed to distribute its classical artists, although classical recordings have also been issued on the regular Philips label. In the US, Philips eventually handled distribution and sales for Philips, Mercury, British Decca (sold under the London label in the US) and Deutsche Grammophon.

After the sale of PolyGram to Vivendi/Seagram, all PolyGram-labels - including Philips and Decca - became part of the Universal Music Group.

==Compact disc era==
In 1983, Philips became one of the first record labels to issue compact discs using digital recordings that had been made since 1978.

Philips and its subsidiaries eventually re-issued many of its pre-digital stereo and mono recordings on compact disc. Philips and DuPont partnered in four CD manufacturing plants in Hanover, Germany; Blackburn in the UK (formerly the Philips Laservision Disc factory); Kings Mountain in North Carolina, and Louviers in France. By the mid-1990s, PolyGram Classics handled the classical labels (Philips, Mercury, Decca, Deutsche Grammophon) and Verve Music Group handled the jazz back catalogue (from Verve, Mercury, etc.) and new jazz releases. Island Records absorbed Mercury in 2014 and in doing so, Island has continued to manage the Philips pop back catalogue to this day.

Philips Records has been part of Universal Music since 1998, the name continuing to be licensed from the label&#x27;s former parent company. In 1999, Philips Classics was absorbed into the Decca Music Group, and Philips recording and mastering operations in the Netherlands were shut down. Former employees bought the Philips Recording Center in Baarn, Netherlands, and formed Polyhymnia International (a recording and mastering company) and Pentatone Records (which specializes in SACD releases).

Many of the Philips classical recordings have been reissued on the Eloquence label. Universal also released a &quot;Philips 50&quot; series marking the 50th anniversary of Philips Records in the early 2000s; some of those CDs are still in print. Pentatone has released Philips Quadraphonic sound recordings from the early and mid-1970s in 4-channel SACD format, as their RQR Series.

Philips&#x27; classical catalog was issued on CD under the headings &quot;Digital Classics&quot;, &quot;Legendary Classics&quot; and &quot;Silver Line Classics.&quot; Many of these titles have been reissued on the Decca label.

<text>Philips Classics Records, commonly referred to as Philips Classics, was a classical music label founded by PolyGram that existed from 1983 until 2009. A new division called Philips Classics Productions was set up to manage the Philips Classics label.

It was successful with artists including Alfred Brendel, Sir John Eliot Gardiner, Sir Neville Marriner and the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields, Mitsuko Uchida, Julian Lloyd Webber, Sir Colin Davis and André Rieu.

A significant release by the label was the 180-CD &quot;The Complete Mozart Edition&quot;, which featured all works by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, known at the set&#x27;s publication in 1990–1991 for the bicentenary of the composer&#x27;s death. It was re-released as the &quot;Complete Compact Mozart Edition&quot;.

In 1997, Philips Classics Productions was reorganized as Philips Music Group.

Parent Universal Music Group, which was formed in 1999 from the merger of the PolyGram and MCA families of labels, merged the label into Decca Records. Decca continued to use the Philips Classics label for re-editions until 2009 under a licensing agreement with the Philips company.

<text>Heifer International (also known as Heifer Project International) is a global nonprofit working to eradicate poverty and hunger through sustainable, values-based holistic community development. Heifer International distributes animals, along with agricultural and value-based training, to families in need around the world as a means of providing self-sufficiency. Recipients must agree to &quot;pass on the gift&quot; by donating animal offspring, as well as sharing the skills and knowledge of animal husbandry and agricultural training with other impoverished families in the community. The organization receives financial support from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, BlackRock, Cargill, Mastercard Foundation, Walmart and the W. K. Kellogg Foundation.

Based in Little Rock, Arkansas, United States, Heifer International started with a shipment of 17 heifers to Puerto Rico in 1944.

== Origins and history ==
Heifer International started as Heifers for Relief in 1944. Its founder, an Indiana farmer named Dan West, was a Church of the Brethren relief worker during the Spanish Civil War. Working with Quakers and Mennonites, West directed a program where hungry children were given rations of milk. In 1938, West was ladling out milk to hungry refugee children and wrote later that he thought, &quot;These children don&#x27;t need a cup [of milk], they need a cow.&quot;

When back home in Indiana, West took the idea to his neighbors and church. This led to the formation of the Heifers for Relief Committee in 1939. In 1942, West was approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to pursue the idea as a national project. The charity was incorporated in 1944 and sent its first shipment of 17 heifers to Puerto Rico. Several local farmers who knew West donated the animals.

The first cows were named &quot;Faith,&quot; &quot;Hope,&quot; and &quot;Charity,&quot; and recipient families had to promise that they would donate the first female calf to another poor family. West asked farmers and church leaders to donate pregnant dairy cows due to calve soon so that impoverished families could have milk for years to come and not have to worry about breeding the cows. Heifer International would eventually broaden its scope to distribute fish, chickens, pigs, goats, sheep, cattle, oxen, water buffaloes, bees, llamas, alpacas, camels, frogs and rabbits to poor rural communities around the world.

Heifer International&#x27;s first paid employee was Thurl Metzger, a member of the Church of the Brethren who started as an unpaid volunteer and served as executive director/program director and director of international programs of Heifer International for 30 years. Metzger started his tenure as a seagoing cowboy. Seagoing cowboys volunteered to accompany the animals to their overseas destinations. From 1951 to 1981, Metzger served as the executive director and director of international programs of the nonprofit and diversified the program&#x27;s offerings as well as the geographic regions Heifer International was serving. Eventually Metzger guided Heifer to work in developing nations instead of war-torn regions.

In the early 1970s, Heifer consolidated its U.S. distribution network by buying several large farms, including a 1,200-acre ranch in Perryville, Arkansas, as livestock holding facilities. The organization moved its headquarters to Little Rock, near the Perryville ranch, in 1971. Livestock are now sourced from within country or regionally.

In 1992, Heifer International appointed Jo Luck to its helm as CEO. Jo Luck is a former member of Bill Clinton&#x27;s Arkansas gubernatorial cabinet. Before serving as CEO and president, Luck was the director of international programs for Heifer International. Heifer International&#x27;s budget boomed to almost $100 million under Jo Luck&#x27;s leadership.

In 2008, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation awarded Heifer International a $42.5 million grant to help poor rural farmers in East Africa double their incomes by increasing their production of high quality raw milk to sell to dairies. In 2012, the foundation followed up with an additional $8.2 million.

In 2010, Pierre U. Ferrari was named CEO of Heifer International. Ferrari became president and CEO after Jo Luck&#x27;s retirement.

In 2011, Heifer International has committed to help rebuild rural communities and to improve economic opportunities through livestock inputs and management in Haiti as part of the 2011 Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) Annual Meeting.

On May 7, 2022, Mark Middleton, a former special assistant to President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, was found dead at the Heifer Ranch in Perryville, Arkansas, approximately 30 miles from his home. His death was ruled a suicide; authorities reported that he was found hanging from a tree with an extension cord around his neck and a shotgun wound to his chest.

== “Passing on the Gift” ==
&quot;Passing on the Gift&quot; is part of Heifer International&#x27;s charitable model. The nonprofit grounds all of its projects in its 12 Cornerstones of Just and Sustainable Development.

*Passing on the gift allows families and individuals who have received animals to be donors themselves.
*Accountability allows for organization at the grassroots level. Community members decide together what kind of animal and assistance they would like. They also set goals, plan appropriate strategies to achieve those goals, and evaluate their success. Participants take responsibility for making the most of the tools and training they receive.
*Sharing and caring. Participants become donors themselves and contribute to a more unified community.
*Sustainability and self-reliance. Heifer training tries to empower participants to take charge of their own success; each project has an exit strategy to prepare farmers for self-sufficiency.
*Improved animal management. Project participants learn key essential aspects of animal husbandry. 
*Nutrition and income are the rewards Heifer expects recipients to gain from their gift animal through the consumption and/or sale of animal products.
*Gender and family focus encourages women and men to share in decision-making and community development.
*Genuine need and justice. Ensures that those most in need are given priority in receiving animals and training.
*Improving the environment includes such agroecological techniques as improving soil fertility with animal manure, promoting forestation, respecting and encouraging biodiversity, monitoring watershed conditions and minimizing erosion.
*Full participation is expected within the groups that Heifer works with. 
*Training and education include formal sessions as well as informal farm visits and demonstrations. Each project group decides on its own training needs and local people are involved as trainers. 
*Spirituality is expressed in common values, common beliefs about the value and meaning of all life, a sense of connectedness to the earth, and a shared vision of the future.

== External audits ==
=== Charity Navigator ===
As of 2023, Charity Navigator scored Heifer International as a 4-star (out of four) charity with 98 points out of 100. Based on the income statement for financial year 2022, Charity Navigator showed Heifer&#x27;s non-program expenses (for management and fundraising) as accounting for 25.8%, and program expenses for 74.3% of its total expenses.

=== GiveWell ===
GiveWell notes that while Heifer International is &quot;commonly perceived as a way to &#x27;give a cow to a poor family as a gift&#x27; ... this is in fact a donor illusion – donations support Heifer International&#x27;s general &#x27;agricultural assistance&#x27; activities.&quot; GiveWell delineates concerns about the efficacy of agricultural assistance programs in general, and, specifically, those that involve gifts of livestock, stating, in conclusion: &quot;Neither Heifer&#x27;s website nor its grant application have provided the kind of information needed to address these concerns.&quot;

==Awards==

<doc id="1326805" wikidata="Q322145" url="?curid=1326805" title="American marten">
<text>The American marten (Martes americana), also known as the American pine marten, is a species of North American mammal, a member of the family Mustelidae. The species is sometimes referred to as simply the pine marten. The name &quot;pine marten&quot; is derived from the common name of the distinct Eurasian species, &quot;Martes martes&quot;. &quot;Martes americana&quot; is found throughout Canada, Alaska, and parts of the northern United States. It is a long, slender-bodied weasel, with fur ranging from yellowish to brown to near black. It may be confused with the fisher (&quot;Pekania pennanti&quot;), but the marten is lighter in color and smaller. Identification of the marten is further eased by a characteristic bib that is a distinctly different color than the body. Sexual dimorphism is pronounced, with males being much larger.

The diet is omnivorous and varies by season, but relies chiefly on small mammals like voles. They are solitary except during the mid-summer breeding season. Embryonic implantation is delayed until late winter, however, with a litter of 15 kits born the following spring. Young stay with the mother in a constructed den until the fall and reach sexual maturity by one year old.

Their sable-like fur made them a thoroughly trapped species during the height of the North American fur trade. Trapping peaked in 1820, and populations were depleted until after the turn of the century. Populations have rebounded since, with them being considered a species of least-concern by the IUCN; however, they remain extirpated from some areas of the Northeast, and of the seven subspecies, one is threatened.

==Taxonomy==
The Pacific marten (&quot;Martes caurina&quot;) was formerly thought to be conspecific, but genetic studies support it being a distinct species from &quot;M. americana&quot;. The Pacific marten has a more westerly distribution, hence its common name, ranging into the Pacific Northwest and south to Northern California. Additionally, the Pacific marten has a longer snout and broader cranium than the American marten, and slightly different variations in coat color.

Seven regional subspecies have been recognized for &quot;M. americana&quot;, none of which are distinct morphologically; typically, subspecies taxonomy is only emphasized for work involving those regional groups of a species and their unique set of needs or threats (as opposed to the species&#x27; complete range).

* &quot;Martes americana abieticola&quot; 
* &quot;M. a. abietinoides&quot; 
* &quot;M. a. actuosa&quot; 
* &quot;M. a. americana&quot; 
* &quot;M. a. atrata&quot; 
* &quot;M. a. brumalis&quot; 
* &quot;M. a. kenaiensis&quot; 

A fossil species (originating from the Late Pleistocene to Early Holocene) known as &quot;Martes nobilis&quot; is considered synonymous with &quot;M. americana&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
The American marten is broadly distributed in northern North America. From north to south its range extends from the northern limit of the treeline in arctic Alaska and Canada south to New York. From east to west, its distribution extends from Newfoundland to western Alaska, and southwest to the Pacific coast of Canada. The American marten&#x27;s distribution is vast and continuous in Canada and Alaska. In the northeastern and midwestern United States, American marten distribution is limited to mountain ranges that provide preferred habitats. Over time, the distribution of American marten has contracted and expanded regionally, with local extirpations and successful recolonizations occurring in the Great Lakes region and some parts of the Northeast. The American marten has been reintroduced in several areas where extinction occurred, although in some cases it has instead been introduced into the range of the Pacific marten. It is considered extirpated from Pennsylvania, Maryland, Massachusetts, West Virginia, Ohio, New Jersey, and Illinois.

Martens were once thought to live only in old conifer (evergreen) forests but further study shows that martens live in both old and young deciduous (leafy) and conifer forests as well as mixed forests, including in Alaska and Canada, and south into northern New England, and the Adirondacks in New York. Groups of martens also live in the Midwest, in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Wisconsin and much of Minnesota. Trapping and destruction of forest habitat have reduced its numbers, but it is still much more abundant than the larger fisher. The Newfoundland subspecies (&quot;M. a. atrata&quot;) is considered to be threatened.

A broad, natural hybrid zone between the Pacific and American martens is known to exist in the Columbia Mountains, as well as Kupreanof and Kuiu Islands in Alaska. Several translocations of American marten have been made without regard to the Pacific marten, threatening the latter species. On Dall Island, American martens have been introduced and are hybridizing with the native Pacific marten population, which may put them at risk. On many islands throughout the Alexander Archipelago, American martens have been introduced and are present, with no sign of the Pacific martens; it is unknown whether the islands previously had no marten species until American martens were introduced, or whether the Pacific martens existed on those islands previously but were extirpated by the introduced American martens. In addition, genetic evidence of introgression with American martens is present in other parts of the Pacific marten&#x27;s range, which is likely also a consequence of American marten introductions.

===Home range===
Compared to other carnivores, the American marten population density is low for their body size. One review reports population densities ranging from 0.4 to 2.5 individuals/km2. Population density may vary annually or seasonally. Low population densities have been associated with a low abundance of prey species.

Home range size of the American marten is extremely variable, with differences attributable to sex, year, geographic area, prey availability, cover type, quality or availability, habitat fragmentation, reproductive status, resident status, predation, and population density. Home range size does not appear to be related to body size for either sex. Home range size ranged from 0.04 sq mi (0.1 km2) in Maine to 6.1 sq mi (15.7 km2) in Minnesota for males, and 0.04 sq mi (0.1 km2) in Maine to 3.0 sq mi (7.7 km2) in Wisconsin for females.

Males generally exhibit larger home ranges than females, which some authors suggest is due to more specific habitat requirements of females (e.g., denning or prey requirements) that limit their ability to shift home range. However, unusually large home ranges were observed for four females in two studies (Alaska and Quebec).

Home ranges are indicated by scent-marking. American marten male pelts often show signs of scarring on the head and shoulders, suggesting intrasexual aggression that may be related to home range maintenance. Home range overlap is generally minimal or nonexistent between adult males but may occur between males and females, adult males and juveniles, and between females.

Several authors have reported that home range boundaries appear to coincide with topographical or geographical features. In south-central Alaska, home range boundaries included creeks and a major river. In an area burned 8 years previously in interior Alaska, home range boundaries coincided with transition areas between riparian and nonriparian habitats.

==Description==
The American marten is a long, slender-bodied weasel about the size of a mink with relatively large, rounded ears, short limbs, and a bushy tail. American marten have a roughly triangular head and sharp nose. Their long, silky fur ranges in color from pale yellowish buff to tawny brown to almost black. Their head is usually lighter than the rest of their body, while their tail and legs are darker. American marten usually have a characteristic throat and chest bib ranging in color from pale straw to vivid orange. Sexual dimorphism is pronounced, with males averaging about 15% larger than females in length and as much as 65% larger in body weight.

Total length ranges from 1.5 to 2.2 feet (0.5–0.7 m), with tail length of 5.4 to 6.4 inches (135–160 mm), Adult weight ranges from 1.1 to 3.1 pounds (0.5–1.4 kg) and varies by age and location. Other than size, sexes are similar in appearance. American marten have limited body-fat reserves, experience high mass-specific heat loss, and have limited fasting endurance. In winter, individuals may go into shallow torpor daily to reduce heat loss.

==Behavior==

American marten activity patterns vary by region, though in general, activity is greater in summer than in winter. American marten may be active as much as 60% of the day in summer but as little as 16% of the day in winter In north-central Ontario individuals were active about 10 to 16 hours a day in all seasons except late winter when activity was reduced to about 5 hours a day. In south-central Alaska, American marten were more active in autumn (66% active) than in late winter and early spring (43% active).

American marten may be nocturnal or diurnal. Variability in daily activity patterns has been linked to activity of major prey species, foraging efficiency, sex, reducing exposure to extreme temperatures, season, and timber harvest. In south-central Alaska, American marten were nocturnal in autumn, with strong individual variability in diel activity in late winter. Activity occurred throughout the day in late winter and early spring.

Daily distance traveled may vary by age, sex, habitat quality, season, prey availability, traveling conditions, weather, and physiological condition of the individual. One marten in south-central Alaska repeatedly traveled 7 to 9 miles (11–14 km) overnight to move between two areas of home range focal activity. One individual in central Idaho moved as much as 9 miles (14 km) a day in winter, but movements were largely confined to a 1,280-acre (518 ha) area. Juvenile American marten in east-central Alaska traveled significantly farther each day than adults (1.4 miles (2.2 km) vs. 0.9-mile (1.4 km)).

===Weather factors===
The weather may impact American marten activity, resting site use, and prey availability. Individuals may become inactive during storms or extreme cold. In interior Alaska, a decrease in above-the-snow activity occurred when ambient temperatures fell below −4F (−20C).

A snowy habitat in many parts of the range of the American marten provides thermal protection and opportunities for foraging and resting. American marten may travel extensively under the snowpack. Subnivean travel routes of &gt;33 feet (10 m) on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

American marten are well adapted to snow. On the Kenai Peninsula, individuals navigated through deep snow regardless of depth, with tracks rarely sinking &gt;2 inches (5 cm) into the snowpack. Snowfall patterns may affect distribution, with the presence of American marten linked to deep snow areas.

Where deep snow accumulates, American marten prefer cover types that prevent snow from packing hard and have structures near the ground that provide access to subnivean sites. While American marten select habitats with deep snow, they may concentrate activity in patches with relatively shallow snow.

==Reproduction==

===Breeding===
American marten reach sexual maturity by 1 year of age, but effective breeding may not occur before 2 years of age. In captivity, 15-year-old females bred successfully. In the wild, 12-year-old females were reproductive.

Adult American marten are generally solitary except during the breeding season. They are polygamous, and females may have multiple periods of heat. Females enter estrus in July or August, with courtship lasting about 15 days. Embryonic implantation is delayed until late winter, with active gestation lasting approximately two months. Females give birth in late March or April to a litter ranging from 1 to 5 kits. Annual reproductive output is low according to predictions based on body size. Fecundity varies by age and year and may be related to food abundance.

===Denning behavior===

Females use dens to give birth and to shelter kits. Dens are classified as either natal dens, where parturition takes place, or maternal dens, where females move their kits after birth. American marten females use a variety of structures for natal and maternal denning, including the branches, cavities or broken tops of live trees, snags, stumps, logs, woody debris piles, rock piles, and red squirrel (&quot;Tamiasciurus hudsonicus&quot;) nests or middens. Females prepare a natal den by lining a cavity with grass, moss, and leaves. They frequently move kits to new maternal dens once kits are 7–13 weeks old. Most females spend more than 50% of their time attending dens in both pre-weaning and weaning periods, with less time spent at dens as kits aged. Paternal care has not been documented.

===Development of young===
Weaning occurs at 42 days. Young emerge from dens at about 50 days but may be moved by their mother before this. In northwestern Maine, kits were active but poorly coordinated at 7 to 8 weeks, gaining coordination by 12 to 15 weeks. Young reach adult body weight around three months.

Kits generally stay in the company of their mother through the end of their first summer, and most disperse in the fall. The timing of juvenile dispersal is not consistent throughout American marten&#x27;s distribution, ranging from early August to October. In south-central Yukon, young-of-the-year dispersed from mid-July to mid-September, coinciding with the onset of female estrus. Observations from Yukon suggest that juveniles may disperse in early spring.

==Food habits==
American marten are opportunistic predators, influenced by local and seasonal abundance and availability of potential prey. They require about 80 cal/day while at rest, the equivalent of about three voles (&quot;Microtus&quot;, &quot;Myodes&quot;, and &quot;Phenacomys&quot; spp.). Voles dominate diets throughout the American marten&#x27;s geographic range, though larger prey—particularly snowshoe hares and American red squirrels—may be important, particularly in winter. Red-backed voles (&quot;Myodes&quot; spp.) are generally taken in proportion to their availability, while meadow voles (&quot;Microtus&quot; spp.) are taken in excess of their availability in most areas. Deer mice (&quot;Peromyscus maniculatus&quot;), shrews (&quot;Soricidae&quot;), birds, and carrion are generally eaten less than expected, but may be important food items in areas lacking alternative prey species.

American marten diet may shift seasonally or annually. Generally, diet is more diverse in summer than winter, with summer diets containing more fruit, nuts, vegetation, and insects. Diet is generally more diverse with the American marten&#x27;s distribution compared to Pacific marten&#x27;s, though there is high diversity in the Pacific states. American marten exhibit the least diet diversity in the subarctic, though diversity may also be low in areas where the diet is dominated by large prey species (e.g., snowshoe hares or red squirrels).

American marten may be important seed dispersers; seeds generally pass through the animal intact, and seeds are likely germinable. One study from Chichagof Island, southeast Alaska, found that Alaska blueberry (&quot;Vaccinium alaskensis&quot;) and oval leaf huckleberry (&quot;V. ovalifolium&quot;) seeds had higher germination rates after passing through the gut of American marten compared to seeds that dropped from the parent plant. Analyses of American marten movement and seed passage rates suggested that American marten could disperse seeds long distances: 54% of the distances analyzed were &gt;0.3-mile (0.5 km).

==Mortality==
===Life span===
American marten in captivity may live for 15 years. The oldest individual documented in the wild was 14.5 years old. Survival rates vary by geographic region, exposure to trapping, habitat quality, and age. In an unharvested population in northeastern Oregon, the probability of survival of American marten ≥9 months old was 0.55 for 1 year, 0.37 for 2 years, 0.22 for 3 years, and 0.15 for 4 years. The mean annual probability of survival was 0.63 for 4 years. In a harvested population in east-central Alaska, annual adult survival rates ranged from 0.51 to 0.83 over 3 years of study. Juvenile survival rates were lower, ranging from 0.26 to 0.50. In Newfoundland, annual adult survival was 0.83. Survival of juveniles from October to April was 0.76 in a protected population, but 0.51 in areas open to snaring and trapping. In western Quebec, natural mortality rates were higher in clear-cut areas than in unlogged areas.

===Predators===
American marten are vulnerable to predation from raptors and other carnivores. The threat of predation may be an important factor shaping American marten habitat preferences, a hypothesis inferred from their avoidance of open areas and behavioral observations of the European pine marten (&quot;Martes martes&quot;). Specific predators vary by geographic region. On Newfoundland, red foxes (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;) were the most frequent predator, though coyote (&quot;Canis latrans&quot;) and other American marten were also responsible for some deaths. In deciduous forests in northeastern British Columbia, most predation was attributed to raptors. Throughout the distribution of American marten, other predators include the great horned owl (&quot;Bubo virginianus&quot;), bald eagle (&quot;Haliaeetus leucocephalus&quot;), golden eagle (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;), bobcat (&quot;Lynx rufus&quot;) Canada lynx (&quot;L. canadensis&quot;), mountain lion (&quot;Puma concolor&quot;), fisher (&quot;Pekania pennanti&quot;), wolverine (&quot;Gulo gulo&quot;), grizzly bear (&quot;Ursus arctos horribilis&quot;), American black bear (&quot;U. americanus&quot;), and grey wolf (&quot;C. lupus&quot;).

===Hunting===
The fur of the American marten is shiny and luxuriant, resembling that of the closely related sable (&quot;Martes zibellina&quot;). At the turn of the twentieth century, the American marten population was depleted due to the fur trade. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company traded in pelts from this species among others. Numerous protection measures and reintroduction efforts have allowed the population to increase, but deforestation is still a problem for the marten in much of its habitat. American marten are trapped for their fur in all but a few states and provinces where they occur. The highest annual take in North America was 272,000 animals in 1820.

Trapping is a major source of American marten mortality in some populations and may account for up to 90% of all deaths in some areas. Overharvesting has contributed to local extirpations. Trapping may impact population density, sex ratios and age structure. Juveniles are more vulnerable to trapping than adults, and males are more vulnerable than females. American marten are particularly vulnerable to trapping mortality in industrial forests.

===Other===
Other sources of mortality include drowning, starvation, exposure, choking, and infections associated with injury. During live trapping, high mortality may occur if individuals become wet in cold weather.

American marten host several internal and external parasites, including helminths, fleas (Siphonaptera), and ticks (Ixodida). American marten in central Ontario carried both toxoplasmosis and Aleutian disease, but neither affliction was suspected to cause significant mortality. High American marten mortality in Newfoundland was caused by encephalitis.

== Habitat reintroduction ==
The American marten has been put on track to be reintroduced into Pennsylvania by 2032.

<text>Otricoli is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Terni, Umbria, central Italy. It is located on the Via Flaminia, near the east bank of the Tiber, some 70 km north of Rome and 20 km south of Narni.

It was originally the ancient Umbrian city of Ocriculum.

==History ==

The Umbrian city was probably located on the hill under the modern town. After the defeat of the Umbrian tribes at the battle of Mevania in the Samnite Wars, the inhabitants of Ocriculum concluded an alliance with Rome in 308 BC. From this date that the city began to perform a strategic function as a border town between Umbria, the &quot;Ager Faliscus&quot; and the Sabina and especially following the construction in 220 BC of the Via Flaminia.

A new unwalled city was built about 2 km south of and below the present town probably around this time in order to be closer to the curve of the Tiber and the Via Flaminia, which crossed the river here to enter Umbria. Its river port was the &quot;oil port&quot;, signalling the olive culture that supported its economy. A &quot;pensor lignarius&quot; (&quot;weigher of wood&quot;) in an inscription identifies a trade in timber and perhaps firewood.

It became a municipium, governed by &quot;quattuorvirs&quot;, and was ascribed to the &quot;Arnensis&quot; tribe, as documented by several epigraphs found on site.

The beauties of its surroundings made it a desirable place for patricians to holiday: Titus Annius Milo, a friend of Cicero and a leading politician in the mid-1st century BC, had a villa there. He was accused of killing Clodius (in 52 BC) after transporting weapons across the Tiber to his villa in Ocriculum; Pompea Celerina, the very wealthy mother-in-law of Pliny the Younger, also had estates there at the end of the 1st century AD.

In the imperial age it flourished as shown by its great monuments and exceptional works of art, due to an economy based on agriculture, commerce and the pottery industry: famous are the well-known cups in relief called &quot;Popilius Cups&quot; and the tile and brick factories whose stamps are known, found in Rome in the Tiber.

In the Diocletian reform of the regions of Italy, Ocricolum became part of &quot;Tuscia et Umbria&quot;. In the 4th century, Emperor Constantius II stopped here on his way to Rome. According to the historian Hydatius who lived in the 5th century, the most important event that took place in its territory would be the bloody battle (50,000 dead) which took place in Otriculum in winter 412-3 between Heraclianus, the usurper and &quot;comes&quot; of Africa (who came from Carthage on 3700 ships), and the army of emperor Honorius led by the &quot;comes&quot; Marino who was victorious.

The names of four bishops are known, a Erculio who participated in the Roman council of 487, a Costanzo who participated in the Roman council of 499, a Fulgentius mentioned by Pope Gregory I and of whom a corbel from the altar he erected to San Vittore, and a Dominic who took part in the councils of 595 and 601.

The city was destroyed between 569 and 605 during the Lombard invasion after which the lower city was abandoned in favour of the one on the hill.

==The site==

The archaeological area covers about 36 hectares. Excavations on the Roman site in 1775 and following years led to the discovery of the baths, a theatre, a basilica and other buildings.

The massive baths buildings include a great &quot;octagonal room’&quot; in which the spectacular mosaic pavement was found, now in the Sala della Rotonda, Museo Pio-Clementino. Of the many other superb works of art found (many in the Vatican museum) are the celebrated head of Zeus of Otricoli and the head of Claudius both also shown in the Sala della Rotonda. Winter baths to the north also existed as evidenced by inscriptions, referring to their restoration in the 4th century, and statue bases.

The theatre is built using the natural slope of the land for its &quot;cavea&quot;, only the ends having three built-up vaulted structures on both the right and left. Behind the rows of seats are two partially visible ambulatories. Of the upper gallery only a sector covered with a barrel vault remains; the external perimeter is formed by a retaining wall reinforced by pillars. In front of the cavea was the &quot;scaenae frons&quot; adorned with precious coloured marbles and with statues and decorations including the gigantic Muses now preserved in the Vatican museums.

In the city centre next to the theatre is a massive and unique building known as the &quot;Great Substructures&quot; consisting of twelve vaulted rooms on two levels which supported a terrace high above most of the town. It dates from late 1st c. BC to early 1st c. AD. It could have provided a monumental area supporting a &quot;temenos&quot; (enclosed sacred area) for a temple, similar to sanctuaries of the same period such as at Tibur. The rooms of the upper level have &quot;opus reticulatum&quot; walls still covered with plaster in some places. It was also perhaps used as a warehouse, given the nearby river port known as &quot;dell&#x27;Olio&quot;. A smaller version of the substructures nearby expanded the central city area with a terrace.

The monumental nymphaeum, 50 m long, is part of a series of buildings that formed a monumental facade on the slope of the valley. It dates from late 1st c. BC and early 1st c. AD and is faced in &quot;opus reticulatum&quot; and has three fountains in alternating semicircular and rectangular niches. It is connected to the cistern inside the antiquarium Casale San Fulgenz through a system of tunnels and also fed by the river San Vittore.

The forum discovered in the excavations of 1778-81 was north of the river San Vittore and included the so-called &quot;basilica&quot; containing many imperial statues, indicating a public building for the imperial cult, or Augusteum.

Several monumental tombs unusually stand within the city in the valley near the via Flaminia, one of which is of a large drum form next to a public well and seats and belonged to Lucius Cominus Tuscus, son of Caius, of the Arnensis tribe.

The Via Flaminia is well preserved and paved with large basalt stones in front of the tombs.

<text>Jim Aitken (born 22 November 1947) is a British businessman and former Scotland international rugby union player. His regular playing position was Prop.

==Rugby Union career==

===Amateur career===

Aitken played for his hometown club Penicuik, before moving to First Division Gala. He was the Gala Captain for their 3 League Championships in 1979/80, 80/81 and 82/83.

===Provincial career===

Aitken was capped by South of Scotland.

Aitken played for Scotland Probables in the Trial match against Scotland Possibles on 11 January 1975.

===International career===

Aitken was capped twice by Scotland &#x27;B&#x27; - in 1975 and 1976 against France &#x27;B&#x27; - before receiving a full senior cap.

Aitken won 24 international caps and scored one try, playing at loose head prop, between 1977 and 1984, and captained the Scottish Grand Slam side in the 1984 Five Nations Championship.

Aitken won his first cap for Scotland at the age of 29 against England in 1977, but was then replaced by the legendary two-time Lion, Ian McLauchlan, because of concerns about his scrummaging. After working hard on his technique, he returned in 1981 and played 21 of the next 24 tests. He captained Scotland to victory against England at Twickenham in 1983, Scotland&#x27;s first win there since 1971. He played in Scotland&#x27;s 25–25 draw against New Zealand, still the closest that Scotland have ever come to beating the All Blacks.

The next season, Scotland won the Grand Slam under his guidance, and he scored a crucial try against Wales to set up a winner-takes-all match versus France, which Scotland won 21–12. It was Scotland&#x27;s first Grand Slam since 1925. He played one more game for Scotland against Romania before retiring with a Scotland captaincy record of played 7, won 5, drew 1, lost 1. A magnificent achievement to be remembered as one of Scotland&#x27;s most successful ever skippers. In recent years he has been critical of the state of Scottish rugby, describing it as &quot;a mess&quot;, particularly former Scotland coaching duo, Ian McGeechan and Jim Telfer.

==Business career==

Aitken underachieved at High School but graduated from Edinburgh College of Commerce. He is now a successful businessman, owning one of Scotland&#x27;s largest grain merchants and having sold his previous company, Scotmalt, in 2003. In 2009, he donated £100,000 to the Conservative Party, becoming the second-largest donor to the Scottish branch of the party.

<doc id="1326831" wikidata="Q234539" url="?curid=1326831" title="Elisabeth Sladen">
<text>Elisabeth Clara Heath-Sladen (1 February 1946 – 19 April 2011) was an English actress. She became best known as Sarah Jane Smith in the British television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, appearing as a regular cast member from 1973 to 1976, alongside both Jon Pertwee and Tom Baker, and reprising the role many times in subsequent decades, both on &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and its spin-offs, &quot;K-9 and Company&quot; (1981) and &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; (2007–2011).

Sladen was interested in ballet and theatre from childhood, and began to appear on stage in the mid-1960s, although she was more often a stage manager at this time. She moved to London in 1970 and won several television roles, with her acting in the police drama &quot;Z-Cars&quot; leading to her being recommended for the role in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. After leaving the series, she had other roles on both television and radio before semi-retiring to bring up a family in the mid-1980s.

Sladen returned to the public eye in the 2000s with more &quot;Doctor Who&quot; related appearances, which culminated in taking a regular lead role in &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;. In 2010, the show earned the Royal Television Society Award for Best Children&#x27;s Drama. She also made regular guest appearances on the main television series and provided voice-over commentaries and interviews for its releases to DVD. She died of cancer on 19 April 2011.

==Early life==
Elisabeth Clara (or Claira) Heath-Sladen was born 1 February 1946 in Liverpool, England. Sladen was the only child of Tom Sladen (1900–1994), who fought in the First World War and served in the Home Guard during the Second World War, and Gladys (1902–1978) (née Trainer).

She developed an interest in performing at an early age, beginning dance lessons when she was five, and dancing in one production with the Royal Ballet. She was a primary school contemporary of future politician Edwina Currie, appearing in at least one school production with her. She went on to secondary school and attended Aigburth Vale High School for Girls.

==Career==
===Early career===
Sladen attended the Elliott-Clarke Drama School.
In 1965, she made her first film appearance in &quot;Ferry Cross the Mersey&quot; as an uncredited extra. Sladen then joined the Hillbark Players, for their open-air production of &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, playing Hero.

After two years at drama school, Sladen began work at the Liverpool Playhouse repertory company as an assistant stage manager. Her first stage appearance at the Playhouse was as a maid in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. A few months later, she played a corpse in &quot;The Physicists&quot;. However, she was scolded for giggling on stage due to her future husband Brian Miller whispering the words &quot;Respiration nil, Aston Villa two&quot; in her ear while he was playing a doctor. Sladen was such a good assistant stage manager that she did not get many acting roles, a problem that was solved when she accidentally made a mistake on one occasion. An earlier interview indicated that she deliberately made mistakes on several occasions. As a result, she began to get on-stage roles again. She eventually moved into weekly repertory work, travelling to various locations in Britain. Sladen and Miller moved to Manchester, in 1966, spending three years there. They married on 8 June 1968. She appeared in numerous roles, most notably as Desdemona in &quot;Othello&quot;, her first appearance as a leading lady. She also got the occasional part on Radio Leeds and Granada Television, eventually appearing as barmaid Anita Reynolds in 1970 in six episodes of the long-running soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;.

In 1969, she and her husband appeared in the play &quot;How the Other Half Loves&quot;; when in the autumn of 1970 the play moved to London, the couple also moved there. Her first television role in London was in a two-part story of &quot;Z-Cars&quot;. These two episodes of Z-Cars have since been wiped and are listed as missing episodes by the BBC&#x27;s archive library. She then appeared as a terrorist in an episode of &quot;Doomwatch&quot;, followed by guest roles in further episodes of &quot;Z-Cars&quot;, &quot;Public Eye&quot;, &quot;Some Mothers Do &#x27;Ave &#x27;Em&quot; and &quot;Special Branch&quot;.

===Sarah Jane Smith===
In 1973, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; actress Katy Manning, who was playing the Third Doctor&#x27;s assistant Jo Grant opposite Jon Pertwee, was leaving the series; &quot;Z-Cars&quot; producer Ron Craddock gave Sladen an enthusiastic recommendation to &quot;Doctor Who&quot; producer Barry Letts. Sladen arrived at the audition not knowing it was for the new companion role, and was amazed at Letts&#x27;s thoroughness. She was introduced to Pertwee, whom she found intimidating at the time. As she chatted with Letts and Pertwee, each time she turned to look at one of them the other would signal a thumbs-up. The role of Sarah Jane Smith was originally given to comic actress April Walker, but allegedly during rehearsals for debut story &quot;The Time Warrior&quot;, doubts over the pairing of Walker and Pertwee surfaced and the part was recast with Sladen.

She stayed on &quot;Doctor Who&quot; for three-and-a-half seasons, alongside Pertwee as the Third Doctor and Tom Baker as the Fourth. She returned to the character of Sarah Jane Smith on several later occasions. In 1981, new &quot;Doctor Who&quot; producer John Nathan-Turner asked her to return to the series to ease the transition between Tom Baker and new Doctor Peter Davison. She declined but accepted his second offer of a pilot for a spin-off series called &quot;K-9 and Company&quot;, co-starring K-9, the robot dog from &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Although it won viewing figures of 8.4 million and a positive reception from BBC executives, the pilot was not picked up for a series due to &quot;logistics and changes in BBC management&quot;. Sladen&#x27;s next appearance in the role was in the 20th anniversary special &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; (1983).

She reprised the role in the 1993 Children in Need special &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot;, and in the 1995 independently produced video &quot;Downtime&quot; alongside former co-star Nicholas Courtney as Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart and Deborah Watling as Victoria Waterfield. This was her last on-screen appearance as Sarah Jane Smith before 2006.

Sladen played Sarah Jane in several audio plays. Two of them were produced for BBC Radio, &quot;The Paradise of Death&quot; (Radio 5, 1993), and &quot;The Ghosts of N-Space&quot; (Radio 2, 1996), together with Jon Pertwee and Nicholas Courtney. In 1997, Sladen won Hall of Fame Actress in Cult TV Awards. Big Finish Productions produced two series of &quot;Sarah Jane Smith&quot; audio adventures set in the present day, released in 2002 and 2006. Her husband, Brian Miller, appeared in the story &quot;Ghost Town&quot;. Her daughter Sadie appeared in the audios. Sladen also contributed interviews and DVD commentaries to many of the classic &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serials she co-starred in.

Following the successful revival of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 2005, Sladen guest starred as Sarah Jane in &quot;School Reunion&quot;, an episode of the 2006 series, along with David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor. Sladen worked a lot of the characterisation herself—in the lead-up to the broadcast of &quot;School Reunion&quot; she was quoted in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; as saying: &quot;Sarah Jane used to be a bit of a cardboard cut-out. Each week it used to be, &#x27;Yes Doctor, no Doctor&#x27;, and you had to flesh your character out in your mind—because if you didn&#x27;t, no one else would.&quot; She also spoke favourably of the characterisation in the new series. Sladen won best guest appearance in the annual Cult TV Awards.

Following her successful appearance in the series, Sladen later starred in &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;, a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-off focusing on Sarah Jane, produced by BBC Wales for CBBC and created by Russell T Davies. A 60-minute special aired on New Year&#x27;s Day 2007, with a 10-episode series commencing broadcast in September 2007, followed by a second 12-episode series in late 2008, which carried that same format for the show&#x27;s third and fourth series up until November 2010. A fifth series originally comprising 12 episodes was commissioned for a late 2011 broadcast, with 6 of the episodes being filmed alongside the show&#x27;s fourth series, but due to Sladen&#x27;s unexpected death in April 2011, the latter half never reached production, officially ending the series. The first 6 episodes were broadcast as originally intended in tribute to Sladen in October 2011. The programme won a Royal Television Society 2010 award for Best Children&#x27;s Drama. Sladen also read original audio stories on CD for &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;, which were released in November 2007: &quot;The Glittering Storm&quot; and &quot;The Thirteenth Stone&quot;. This was the first time that BBC Audiobooks had commissioned new content for exclusive release on audio. Further pairs of audio stories were released every year until 2010, all read again by Sladen.

Sladen returned to &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in the show&#x27;s fourth series in the concluding episodes &quot;The Stolen Earth&quot; and &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; and was credited in the title sequence of both episodes. Her final appearance in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was a scene in the concluding part of &quot;The End of Time&quot;, Tennant&#x27;s last episode as the Tenth Doctor. Just before her death, Sladen had also been interested in being involved in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Fourth Doctor Big Finish series.

===Other work===
While Sladen was in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, she attended numerous public events to publicise the programme. Following her departure, she largely stopped attending related events as she felt it could be seen as bad manners to the new cast.

After her initial run in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; ended in 1976, she returned to Liverpool with her husband and performed in a series of plays. This included a two-hander with Miller in &quot;Mooney and his Caravans&quot;. Subsequent appearances include a two-year stint as a presenter for the children&#x27;s programme &quot;Stepping Stones&quot;, a lead role with Miller playing her husband in ITV drama &quot;Send in the Girls&quot;, a BBC &quot;Play for Today&quot;, a role as a stand-up comic&#x27;s spouse in &quot;Take My Wife&quot;, and a small part in the film &quot;Silver Dream Racer&quot; as a bank secretary in 1980, only her second film appearance.
In 1981, former &quot;Doctor Who&quot; producer Barry Letts cast her as the female lead in the BBC Classics production of &quot;Gulliver in Lilliput&quot;. The character of Lady Flimnap was written for Sladen, and she said it was her favourite role. She continued to appear in various television adverts and in another Letts production, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (playing the Dormouse).

After the birth of her daughter Sadie in 1985, Sladen went into semi-retirement, placing her family first, but found time for the occasional television appearance.

In 1991, she starred as Alexa opposite Colin Baker in &quot;The Stranger&quot; audio adventure &quot;The Last Mission&quot; for BBV Audio. Sladen also appeared in a &quot;Bernice Summerfield&quot; audio drama, Kate Orman&#x27;s &quot;Walking to Babylon&quot;. Following the audio production of &quot;The Paradise of Death&quot; in 1993, Sladen restarted her regular public appearances in the United Kingdom. In 1995, she played Dr Pat Hewland in four episodes of &quot;Peak Practice&quot;. In 1996, she played Sophie in &quot;Faith in the Future&quot;, and appeared in 15 episodes of the BBC schools programme &quot;Numbertime&quot;, which was repeated annually for around ten years. This was her last television acting appearance until the 2006 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;School Reunion&quot;. In 2008 and 2009, Sladen appeared in a pantomime production of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; at the Theatre Royal Windsor, playing Mrs. Darling and a beautiful mermaid.

Sladen&#x27;s last fan event was at the British Film Institute on 12 October 2010, where there was a special showing of &quot;The Death of the Doctor&quot;, followed by a Q&amp;A session. Her last public appearance was at the EA British Academy Children&#x27;s Awards on 28 November 2010.

==Autobiography==
&quot;Elisabeth Sladen: The Autobiography&quot; was released posthumously on 7 November 2011, by Aurum Press Ltd. The book was launched at &#x27;The Doctor Who Experience&#x27;, Kensington Olympia on 26 November 2011, in the presence of Brian Miller, Sadie Miller, Tom Baker and Terrance Dicks.
The BBC released an audio CD version of the book, read by fellow Doctor Who alumna Caroline John, on 1 December 2011. The foreword for the book was written by fellow &quot;Doctor Who&quot; actor David Tennant, who portrayed the Tenth Doctor.

==Personal life==
Sladen married actor Brian Miller on 8 June 1968 in Liverpool. Their daughter, Sadie Miller, appeared alongside Sladen in the 1993 documentary, &quot;Thirty Years in the TARDIS&quot;, wearing a replica of the Andy Pandy overalls Sladen wore in &quot;The Hand of Fear&quot;.

==Death==
Sladen was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in February 2011 and died on 19 April 2011; she had previously fought the disease in 1999. She was 65. Her death was widely reported in the UK—on the BBC Ten O&#x27;Clock News; as one of the rolling headlines of the BBC News channel for the day; featuring prominently on many commercial television news reports (including Granada which serves her native Liverpool); on the front page of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and the &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot;; and in the obituary features of almost every UK newspaper.

The first episode of the sixth series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;The Impossible Astronaut&quot;, aired on the following Saturday, and opened with a screen dedicating the episode to her memory. A special programme - &quot;My Sarah Jane: A Tribute to Elisabeth Sladen&quot; - was aired on CBBC immediately afterwards. In 2012 the new companion, Jenna Coleman&#x27;s character, was named Clara. This was interpreted by some fans as a tribute to Sladen, as her middle name was Clara.

&quot;The Hand of Fear&quot; was also shown on BBC Four as a tribute. At the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, during the film clips of people who had died in the past year, Sladen was the final person to be shown.
Singer-songwriter Talis Kimberley wrote a tribute song, &quot;Goodnight, Sarah-Jane&quot;.
Tom Baker paid tribute to Sladen on his official website saying &quot;sweet memories of happy days with Lis Sladen, the lovely, witty, kind and so talented Lis Sladen&quot;.

<text>Moiwana is a Maroon village in the Marowijne district in the east of Suriname.

== Massacre ==

The village was the scene of the Moiwana massacre on November 29, 1986, during the Suriname Guerrilla War between the Surinamese military regime, headed by Dési Bouterse, and the Jungle Commando led by Ronnie Brunswijk. The army attacked the village, killing at least 35 of the inhabitants, mostly women and children, and burned Brunswijk&#x27;s house. The survivors fled with thousands of other inland inhabitants over the Marowijne River to neighboring French Guiana.

The human rights organisation Moiwana &#x27;86 has committed itself to justice with regard to this event.

Police chief inspector was murdered in August 1990 while investigating the massacre. Reportedly he was forced out of his car near Fort Zeelandia and shot in the head, with his body left outside Bouterse&#x27;s office. Other police investigators fled the country, stalling the investigation.

The government has stated that it is still continuing its investigation of the massacre, but that prospective witnesses either had moved or died, or were uncooperative. It has also said that an investigation of the murder of Herman Gooding was continuing.

In August 2005, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ordered Suriname to pay US$3 million in compensation to 130 survivors of the massacre, and to establish a US$1.2 million fund for the development of Moiwana.

<text>Andrew Robertson Irvine (born 16 September 1951) is a former president of the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU), and a former Scottish international rugby player. He earned fifty one Scotland caps, captaining the team on fifteen occasions, and scored 250 points for . He went on three British Lions tours.

==Background==
Irvine was born in Edinburgh, on 16 September 1951. He was educated at James Gillespie&#x27;s Primary School and George Heriot&#x27;s School. From there he went on to Edinburgh University where he graduated in Geography.

==Rugby Union career==

===Amateur career===

Irvine originally played for Heriot&#x27;s Rugby Club.

He also played for the Barbarians during their 1976 Easter Tour. In the 1974 tour, he adopted many South African tactics and styles of play, although JPR Williams was preferred as full back for the tests, limiting Irvine to two test appearances on the wing.

Irvine vies with Ken Scotland, Gavin Hastings and Stuart Hogg for the title of Scotland&#x27;s greatest ever fullback, with incisive running at a blistering pace from the back his trademark.

<text>Neptune Records was a record label founded by Philadelphia writer-producers, Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff in 1969.

The label, distributed by Chess Records, lasted for only two years, releasing 20 singles and three albums. It was the precursor to the pair&#x27;s Philadelphia International label, which they started in 1971 with Columbia Records. Neptune featured releases by artists such as Jeanette &quot;Baby&quot; Washington, The O&#x27;Jays, The Three Degrees and Billy Paul, all who later appeared on Philadelphia International. The biggest hit was the label&#x27;s first release, &quot;One Night Affair&quot; by the O&#x27;Jays (#15, R&amp;B).

<doc id="1326839" wikidata="Q628979" url="?curid=1326839" title="Octodon">
<text>Octodon is a genus of octodontid rodents native to South America, in particular in the Chilean Andes. The best-known member is the common degu, &quot;O. degus&quot;, which is kept as a pet in various countries. Two of the four species of degus are nocturnal.

== Classification ==
This genus was first described in 1832 by the British zoologist Edward Turner Bennett.

== Taxonomy ==
The genus name &quot;Octodon&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;octo&quot;, eight, with reference to their teeth, molars and premolars having the shape of the number 8.

The full list of species is:

* &quot;O. bridgesii&quot;, Bridges&#x27;s degu, found in central Chile
* &quot;O. degus&quot;, the common degu or degu, found in central Chile
* &quot;O. lunatus&quot;, the moon-toothed degu, found in central Chile
* &quot;O. pacificus&quot;, the Pacific degu or Mocha Island degu, found exclusively on Mocha Island, Chile
*&quot;O. ricardojeda&quot;, Ricardo Ojeda&#x27;s degu, found in western Argentina and Chile

== Distribution ==
In the wild, all species of degus live in the Andes, mainly in the mountains of Chile, to which most of them are endemic, aside from a few populations of &quot;O. ricardojeda&quot; in the neighboring province of Neuquén, Argentina. They are found between 0 and 1,800 m in altitude.

== Description ==
They are medium-sized octodontids. Their total body length varies between 200 and 390 mm, with a tail which measures between 81 and 170 mm and represents 70 to 80% of the head + body length. The coat color is grayish, or dull with orange highlights, and turns creamy yellow on the belly. The tail is carried slightly curved and is the same color as the body, and ends with a tuft of black hairs, with the extent of black depending on the species. The ears are quite large and protrude widely from the head, except in &quot;O. pacificus&quot; . The lower limbs are suitable for jumping, with pads on the soles of the paws that prevent slipping. The forelegs have four clawed fingers, along with a poorly developed fifth finger with a nail. The glans of the penis is characterized by a variable number of spikes, 5 or more in number, on each side.

== Lifestyle ==
They are both nocturnal and diurnal. Degus are primarily folivorous herbivores. Their diet varies according to annual vegetation cycles. The consumption of their own droppings (coprophagia) is practiced during times of scarcity. This provides them with a nutritional supplement thanks to the microbial fermentation that takes place in the cecum and optimizes the digestion of fibrous foods.

These social animals dig a burrow made of a series of tunnels where they live in small to large groups composed of both males and females.

== Conservation status ==
&quot;O. bridgesii&quot; (assessed as conspecific with &quot;O. ricardojeda&quot;) is considered vulnerable by the IUCN Red List, while &quot;O. pacificus&quot; is considered critically endangered. The other two species are considered of least concern.

<doc id="1326844" wikidata="Q7843531" url="?curid=1326844" title="Triple step">
<text>Triple step (also three-step or 3-step) is a generic term for dance step patterns that describes three steps or rhythms for instance done on two or four main beats of music. Usually they are two quick steps and one slow one, i.e., often they are counted as &quot;quick-quick-slow&quot;, &quot;one-and-two&quot;, &quot;three-and-four&quot;, etc.

In specific cultural contexts, &quot;triple step&quot; could signify a distinct dance move or style linked to a particular music genre. For instance, in line dancing or folk dances, there exists a step sequence referred to as the &quot;three step&quot;.

== Dance ==

Some dances have a pattern known as such: &quot;triple step&quot;. In some other dances it is referred to as the shuffle step. Some triple steps are performed in a chassé-like manner: &quot;side step, together, side step&quot;. The &quot;cha-cha chassé&quot; is an example of this kind of a triple step. In some other cases the steps may be done in place. Some dances such as swing dances have several variants of triple step. The 3rd part i.e., cued as &quot;step&quot; usually uses half the time of the whole pattern, e.g. one quarter note
The &quot;tri-ple&quot; part may be danced evenly, e.g., two eighth notes or unevenly (on swung notes), e.g., the first part taking up 2/3s of a beat and the second part 1/3, or the first part taking up 3/4 of the beat and the 2nd part 1/4. The pattern may also be syncopated so that the first step is shorter than the second.

=== Arará dances ===

Arará dances, characterized by emphasized triple metre and distinctive shoulder movements are deeply rooted in the cultural traditions of the Arará nation (Arará Nación), an ethnic group in Cuba, originating from the Yoruba-speaking regions of West Africa.

<doc id="1326847" wikidata="Q16958960" url="?curid=1326847" title="North–South Rail Link">
<text>The North–South Rail Link (NSRL) is a proposed rail tunnel, or pair of tunnels, that would connect North Station and South Station in downtown Boston, Massachusetts, linking rail networks that serve the city&#x27;s northern suburbs, New Hampshire, and Maine with the rest of the country. The project would build new underground stations near the existing stations, connect them with about of tunnels, and add other tunnels to link up with existing surface tracks.

The NSRL would connect Amtrak and MBTA Commuter Rail lines that terminate either at North or South Station. For MBTA, it would link northern lines to South Station, Back Bay Station, and lines beyond Back Bay, including the Framingham/Worcester Line and the Northeast Corridor; one option under consideration would also link to commuter lines to the south. The project would also link Amtrak&#x27;s various trains into and out of the city; for example, the &quot;Downeaster&quot; line from Maine currently has no direct connection with Northeast Corridor trains to New York City and beyond. 

In 2017, a Harvard Kennedy School study estimated the cost of the NSRL at $4 to $6 billion (in 2025 dollars), based on Federal Transit Administration data and an analysis of comparable tunnel projects around the world. A 2018 MassDOT study looked at four options with estimated costs ranging from $12 billion to $22 billion (in 2028 dollars).

As of , the North-South Rail Link has not been pursued and is not in active development, though advocates call for updated studies.

==Historical connections==

From 1872 to 1969, the freight-only Union Freight Railroad provided a direct, street running connection between most of the south-side and north-side railroads, and served local customers and wharves in between.

From 1901 to 1938, the Atlantic Avenue Elevated provided direct passenger service past North and South Stations. The elevated trackage was not connected to any of the conventional railroad tracks.

The Grand Junction Railroad, specifically its western segment, remains as the only rail connection between the north and south railroads in the Boston area.

==Present connections==

Public transit connects North Station to South Station only indirectly, through two of the MBTA Subway system&#x27;s quartet of hub stations. A trip between the two commuter rail stations requires taking two subway lines, either the Green Line and the Red Line through their shared Park Street station, or the Orange Line and the Red Line via their shared Downtown Crossing station. The underground Winter Street Concourse connects the upper levels of Park Street and Downtown Crossing stations. Amtrak recommends that passengers with young children or much luggage take a taxi between the stations.

It is possible to traverse the gap directly via the Orange Line from Back Bay Station to North Station, but it requires seven stops and not all of the southern lines pass through Back Bay; the Old Colony Lines, and Fairmount Line on the Commuter Rail do not. The Orange Line also provides a connection for Amtrak passengers who want to transfer between the Northeast Corridor and the &quot;Downeaster&quot;. However, North Station passengers add to Orange Line congestion. Similarly, it is possible to connect between South Station and the Fitchburg Line via the Red Line at Porter station. Passengers on the Newburyport/Rockport Line can also take the Silver Line from Chelsea (Bellingham Square). The weekday-only MBTA bus #4 connects the two stations. The North–South Rail Link is proposed to fill all these awkward gaps in service, with direct connections requiring no transfers.

==2018 NSRL feasibility study==
In June 2018, MassDOT released a &quot;North South Rail Link Feasibility Reassessment&quot; presentation that described several tunnel alternatives. The state began soliciting bids for a $2 million feasibility study on March 1, 2017. This study had been pushed for by the North-South Rail Link Working Group. The working group, NSRL supporters, includes Senator Ed Markey, Representatives Niki Tsongas and Katherine Clark, with Representative Seth Moulton leading the effort. It also includes more than half of Massachusetts mayors.

===Options===
The 2018 MassDOT feasibility study analyzed four options. The costs, presented in 2028 dollars, include purchasing additional rolling stock, other required infrastructure improvements, and a 3.5% annual inflation. Presenters noted that a planned expansion of South Station would cost an estimated $4.7 billion, not including the purchase of rolling stock, electrifying the system, and renovating Tower 1.

Two options would run under the Central Artery (I-93), one option with two tracks and the other, more expensive, with four. The other two options, each with two tracks, would tunnel under downtown Boston several blocks west of the Artery. All the proposals connect the northern commuter rail lines with South Station and then to Back Bay and lines to the west. Only the four-track option would connect North Station with the Fairmount Line south of South Station. Under all the proposals, the Old Colony Lines would continue to terminate at the South Station surface platforms. The existing North Station and its surface platforms could be eliminated under all four options, making the area available for redevelopment.

====Central Artery four-track====
The most ambitious option is the only one that includes a new Central station (or Union Station) near its midpoint, and the only one with a rail tunnel connection to the Fairmount Line. North Station would be underground near the present station. The line would be constructed using two TBM tunnels, deep, along with cut-and-cover in Fort Point Channel. Underground South Station would be built in Fort Point Channel, east of the surface station. Central station would connect to the Blue Line at Aquarium station. The Blue Line is currently the only MBTA rapid transit line with no direct connection to the commuter rail network. Estimated cost: $21.491 billion. 

====Central Artery two-track====
Same route as Central Artery four-track but has no Central station. Constructed using one TBM tunnel, deep, with cut-and-cover used in Fort Point Channel. Underground South Station would be built in Fort Point Channel, east of surface station. Estimated cost: $12.317 billion. 

====South/Congress alignment====
North Station would be entirely underground and moved several blocks south, to between State and Haymarket Streets; no Central station.
Stacked tracks and platforms are incorporated within a single TBM bored tunnel, deep. Underground South Station would be north-west of surface station. Estimated cost: $13.181 billion. 

====Pearl/Congress alignment====
North Station would be entirely underground and moved several blocks south, to between State and Haymarket Streets; no Central station.
Tracks would be in two TBM bored tunnels, deep. Underground South Station would be north of surface station. Estimated cost: $14.388 billion. 

===Electrification===
The tunnels would not be able to handle diesel locomotives and therefore would require the use of dual-mode locomotives or the electrification of several MBTA commuter rail lines. Full electrification of additional rail lines, proposed in earlier studies, could help Massachusetts and the MBTA reach their greenhouse-gas reduction goals, make service more reliable, allow trains to accelerate more quickly, and reduce travel times, but it is expensive and only limited electrification is included in the 2018 proposals. Part of the Fairmount Line would be electrified to allow Amtrak and MBTA Northeast Corridor trains currently routed through Back Bay to reach South Station during construction of the Back Bay portal. The electrified service region would also incorporate the proposed South Coast Rail project&#x27;s Phase II, which includes electrification to Fall River and New Bedford.

===Benefits===

The 2018 feasibility study modeled ridership in 2040 based on various scenarios. In regular service, the two-track options would increase all day boardings to 195,000 compared with 150,000 in the no-build scenario. Assuming an upgrade to all-day peak service, the two-track options would increase all day boardings to 225,000 compared with 195,000 with the South Station expansion. Overall, NSRL would increase commuter rail capacity, in terms of seats to downtown, by 25%.

The feasibility study presentation also projected the distribution of destinations for commuters coming from the north in the morning.

===Potential issues===

The 2018 feasibility study identified several potential problems and risks with the NSRL project. During construction of the Back Bay tunnel portal, required under all options, the MBTA Worcester Line and Amtrak Lake Shore Limited service would have to terminate west of Back Bay station or possibly be rerouted via the Grand Junction Line into North Station. Also some or all Amtrak, Providence, Stoughton, and Franklin Line service would be rerouted via the Fairmount Line into South Station.

The proposal makes aggressive assumptions about improved passenger loading and unloading times and on how many trains can operate per hour in the tunnels. The proposed train frequency, 17 per hour per direction in the two-track options, is higher than the current Red Line train frequency, and exceeds what has been achieved to date on other systems that use the new positive train control systems required for heavy rail. To maintain the 17 trains/hour frequency, trains would have to arrive to enter the tunnel precisely as scheduled. However, new systems like Thameslink in London, UK, have shown that up to 24 trains per hour are possible on heavy rail. 

With the NSRL, the MBTA commuter rail system would be highly dependent on the tunnel routes. Any disruption to those routes would affect the entire system.While the NSRL design as proposed exceeds National Fire Protection Association NFPA 130 life safety requirements, evacuation of the deep tunnels and stations in case of fire could still be difficult. The deep stations would also cost passengers additional time entering and leaving. Currently Porter Square station, at 105 ft, is the deepest in the MBTA system.

==Early proposals==
There have been several prior proposals to link South Station and North Station by rail. In 1987, Congress included funding for the link in a highway and transit bill, but it was dropped after Ronald Reagan vetoed the bill.

A North-South Rail Link was included in the original Big Dig design, but was dropped by the Dukakis Administration. An earlier leading proposal, called the &quot;Dorchester Avenue Alignment&quot;, is similar to the four-track Central Artery alignment in the 2018 study. It would dig two deep-bore tunnels beneath Boston, extending beyond the present rail yards north and south of the city. The tunnels would pass about beneath the I-90 extension, and would reach their maximum depth of at a possible Central Station and at North Station. Carrying a total of up to four tracks, the tunnels would have steep inclines. Trains entering or exiting the tunnels would climb or descend 3% grades, each nearly long. 

Because the tunnels would continue well south of downtown, three portals would accommodate separate connections to Back Bay Station to the west, the Old Colony Lines to the south, and the Fairmount Line running southwest. To the north, the tunnels would cross the Charles River about below its surface (bypassing an existing drawbridge), and connect via portals to the Fitchburg Line and the other northbound rail lines. The plan would require two or three new underground stations; stations are proposed roughly beneath the current North and South Stations, and possibly a new Central Station near Aquarium Station. Central Station would have an platform; North Station and South Station would have platforms.

Pilings for a South Station Tower at South Station complicate a proposal to put the tunnels directly beneath the present South Station. Instead, the Dorchester Avenue Alignment proposal would move the tracks just east of South Station, and would build an underground facility about below the surface of the Fort Point Channel at the Summer Street crossing. Tracks at the underground South Station would have a 0.61% incline.

The new Central Station would connect with the Blue Line at its Aquarium station via an underground concourse, as the Blue Line is the only rapid transit line in Boston that does not already connect with either North or South Station. The new station also would eliminate or reduce transfers to the rapid transit system for many commuter rail passengers with destinations in the central part of the business district. This would relieve transit congestion in the downtown core. Like Philadelphia&#x27;s SEPTA system after the similar Center City Commuter Connection tunnel was built and connected two commuter rail systems, some of Boston&#x27;s trains would be through-routed from one side of the system to the other. Many services would still terminate at North and South Stations, on existing tracks that do not lead into the tunnels. This could also allow trains to pass parked train cars.

A 2003 DEIR/MIS assumes that about one-third of Amtrak trains to and from points south would be routed through the tunnel, stopping only at South Station, but with a new stop north of Boston at Anderson Regional Transportation Center in Woburn, Massachusetts. The &quot;Downeaster&quot; service from Maine and New Hampshire was assumed to stop at North Station only, with a direct connection to more southerly service at Anderson RTC rather than Boston. Thus, some operations would continue above ground at North Station and South Station, and all track and facilities would remain in place. The tunnels would not be equipped to handle diesel locomotives, which may not be suited to the planned steep grades and closely spaced stops; several Commuter Rail lines would necessitate electrification to safely and efficiently operate in the tunnels.

==Route map==
The map below depicts one of the most extensive proposals made to date. The 2018 feasibility study options do not include a link to the Old Colony and Greenbush lines. Only the four-track option includes a link to the Fairmont Line and a Central station. The surface North Station would be eliminated in two of the options and might not be kept in the other two.

==Status==

In May 2006, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts withdrew its sponsorship of the project due to its high capital cost (projected at several billion dollars, with wide variations depending on which option is chosen). Without matching local funds, the project was ineligible for federal funding, and was no longer listed as an approved project in state and Boston MPO capital plans. The April 2007 document &quot;Journey to 2030: Transportation Plan of the Boston Region Metropolitan Planning Organization&quot; said &quot;the MPO feels that a study of the right-of-way requirements should be conducted for preservation of that right-of-way so as to not preclude this project&#x27;s going forward in the future.&quot;

In December 2007, the Federal Railroad Administration was interested in funding this project if the Massachusetts Executive Office of Transportation was interested in sponsoring it. In August 2009, the project was brought back into the spotlight as a component of the New England transportation plan, a coordinated effort by the six New England states to improve rail transportation infrastructure by competing for the $8 billion allocated for high-speed rail in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

In December 2011, former Governor Michael Dukakis reiterated his long-term support for rail service, saying he had been trying to convince the current Massachusetts administration &quot;to get serious about building a rail link&quot; rather than expand South Station. In January 2014, Dukakis said he would prefer to have the North–South Rail Link named after him, rather than South Station, as the Massachusetts House of Representatives had voted unanimously to do. In August 2015, former Governors Dukakis and William F. Weld co-wrote an op-ed calling the link &quot;One of the most important and cost-effective investments we can make&quot;. Based on their advocacy, MassDOT agreed to fund a $2 million study in February 2016.

In June 2018, MassDOT released a &quot;North South Rail Link Feasibility Reassessment&quot; presentation that proposed several tunnel alternatives, described above. The state began soliciting bids for the $2 million feasibility study, advocated for by the North-South Rail Link Working Group, in March 2017. The study did not identify a funding source for constructing the NSRL. On September 6, 2018, MassDOT released their draft feasibility reassessment report and asked for public comment by October 19.

==Alternatives==
, the MBTA and Amtrak use the Grand Junction Line for non-revenue vehicle moves between the two sides of their networks. This alternative connection splits from the Framingham/Worcester Line near Boston University and the Mass Turnpike Allston/Brighton exit ramps, and the track then crosses the Charles River into Cambridge. From there, it runs through the East Cambridge neighborhood and into Somerville, where it connects to the commuter rail lines running from North Station, just below the McGrath-O&#x27;Brien Highway.

The line is currently single-tracked east of Massachusetts Avenue and slow, with a large number of at-grade crossings. Several of the crossings (e.g. Massachusetts Avenue, several streets around Kendall Square, Cambridge Street, and Gore Street) require trains to come to a near-complete stop before proceeding at their maximum allowed track speed of . The line would potentially be served by a new West Station which is proposed as part of the Beacon Park Yard redevelopment.

The Grand Junction corridor has also been proposed as part of the Urban Ring light rail or bus rapid transit project, or a possible pedestrian trail. However, only Worcester Line trains would be directly served, while all other trains from South Station lines would have to detour and reverse all the way to the west of Back Bay and Lansdowne stations to reach the Grand Junction connection.

<doc id="1326856" wikidata="Q270886" url="?curid=1326856" title="String Quartet No. 8 (Beethoven)">
<text>The String Quartet No. 8 in E minor, Op. 59, No. 2, was written by Ludwig van Beethoven and published in 1808. This work is the second of three of his &quot;Rasumovsky&quot; cycle of string quartets, and is a product of his &quot;middle&quot; period.

== Music ==
It is in four movements:

# Allegro, , E minor
# Molto adagio (), , E major
# Allegretto (with the second section marked &quot;Maggiore – Thème russe&quot;), , E minor – E major – E minor
# Finale. Presto, , C major – E minor

Apart from the Piano Sonata No. 27 opus 90, this is the only piece by Beethoven in the key of e minor.

According to Carl Czerny, the second movement of the quartet occurred to Beethoven as he contemplated the starry sky and thought of the music of the spheres (Thayer, &quot;Life of Beethoven&quot;); it has a hymnlike quality reminiscent of a much later devotion, the hymn to the Divine in the Quartet Op. 132.

The scherzo movement of the quartet, the third movement (allegretto), uses a Russian theme also used by Modest Mussorgsky in &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;, by Anton Arensky in his String Quartet No. 2 in A minor, by Pyotr Tchaikovsky in &quot;Orchestral Interlude: The Battle of Poltava&quot; from &quot;Mazeppa&quot;, and by Sergei Rachmaninoff in his 6 Morceaux for Piano Duet, Op. 11. The original song, &quot;Glory to the Sun&quot;, was collected by Nikolay Lvov and Jan Prac; sheet music was published in 1790 (2nd ed., 1806), verses in the 1770s. However, Beethoven used it in an ungentle way. According to Joseph Kerman, &quot;It sounds as though Count Razumovsky had been tactless enough to hand Beethoven the tune, and Beethoven is pile-driving it into the ground by way of revenge.&quot; In an extremely unusual example of melodic setting prior to the 20th century, portions of the tune with strong tonic harmonic leanings are harmonized with the dominant, and vice versa; the harmonic clash is harsh, and many listeners have found this portion of the quartet to be quite amusing, especially as contrasted with the prosaic, almost &quot;exercise-book&quot; counterpoint which precedes it (another example of Beethoven parodying a student counterpoint exercise can be found in the scherzo of the Quartet No. 10, opus 74).

Pianist Jonathan Biss, who is Neubauer Family Chair in Piano Studies at Curtis Institute of Music, has suggested that Opus 59 No. 2 is a proper analogue to – a “close cousin of” – Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 23 in F minor, Op. 57 (“Appassionata”), in that both have a start-to-finish darkness. The two pieces were composed around the same time and Biss notes that although Beethoven wrote many pieces that begin in tragic mode, there are surprisingly few that end there as well. Both compositions also have an opening phrase that is repeated a 1/2 step higher.

<doc id="1326862" wikidata="Q1270515" url="?curid=1326862" title="Octroi">
<text>Octroi (; , to grant, authorize; Lat. &quot;auctor&quot;) is a local tax collected on various articles brought into a district for consumption.
==Antiquity==
The word itself is of French origin. Octroi taxes have a respectable antiquity, being known in Roman times as &quot;vectigalia&quot;. These were either the &quot;portorium&quot;, a tax on the entry from or departure to the provinces (those cities which were allowed to levy the &quot;portorium&quot; shared the profits with the public treasury); the or , a duty levied at the entrance to towns; or the &quot;edulia&quot;, sales imposts levied in markets. &quot;Vectigalia&quot; were levied on wine and certain articles of food, but cities were seldom allowed to use the whole of the profits of the taxes. Anglican Bishop Charles Ellicott suggested that the role of Matthew the tax collector in the gospels () was &quot;to collect the &quot;octroi&quot; levied on the fish, fruit, and other produce that made up the exports and imports of Capernaum&quot; on the Sea of Galilee.

&quot;Vectigalia&quot; were introduced into Gaul by the Romans, and remained after the invasion by the Franks, under the name of &quot;tonlieux&quot; and &quot;coutumes&quot;. They were usually levied by the owners of seigniories.

==Middle Ages==
During the 12th and 13th centuries, when the towns succeeded in asserting their independence, they at the same time obtained the recognition of their right to establish local taxation, and to have control of it. The royal power, however, gradually asserted itself, and it became the rule that permission to levy local taxes should be obtained from the king. From the 14th century onwards, there are numerous charters granting (octroyer) to French towns the right to tax themselves. The taxes did not remain strictly municipal, for an ordinance of Cardinal Mazarin (in 1647) ordered the proceeds of the octroi to be paid into the public treasury, and at other times the government claimed a certain percentage of the product, but this practice was finally abandoned in 1852.

==Tax farming==
From an early time, octroi collection was farmed out to associations or private individuals; the tax farmers were organized into the &quot;Ferme générale&quot;, which built a wall around Paris in the late 18th century to enforce the octroi and other taxes. This system led to numerous abuses, which were sufficiently great that the octroi was abolished during the French Revolution. But such a drastic measure meant the stoppage of all municipal activities, and in 1798 Paris was allowed to re-establish its octroi. Other cities were allowed gradually to follow suit, and in 1809 a law was passed laying down the basis on which octrois might be established. Other laws were passed from time to time in France dealing with the octroi, in 1816, 1842, 1867, 1871, 1884, and 1897. By the law of 1809 octroi duties were allowed on beverages and liquids, food, fuel, forage, and building materials. A scale of rates was fixed, graduated according to the population, and farming out was strictly regulated. Under the law of 1816, an octroi could only be established at the wish of a municipal council, and only articles destined for local consumption could be taxed. The law of 1852 ended the payment of 10% of the gross receipts to the national treasury. Certain indispensable commodities were allowed to enter free, such as grain, flour, fruit, vegetables, and fish.

French octroi duties were collected by several procedures.
# The &quot;regie simple&quot;, i.e. by special officers under the direction of the mayor. By the first decade of the 20th century more than half the octrois were collected this way, and this proportion tended to increase.
# The &quot;bail à ferme&quot;, i.e. farming. The &quot;tax farmer&quot; was authorized to collect the octroi, and in return contracted to pay the municipality a yearly amount, based on the estimated revenues. Use of this method steadily decreased.
# The &quot;regie interesse&quot;, a variation of the preceding method. The contractor paid the municipality a fixed annual sum, representing the municipality&#x27;s share of estimated revenue, plus a share of revenues in excess of the estimate. This method had been practically abandoned by the first decade in the 20th century.
# The &quot;abonnement avec la regie des contributions indirectes&quot;, under which a department of the treasury undertook to collect the duties. Use of this method was increasing by the first decade in the 20th century.

Gross octroi receipts in 1901 amounted to 11,132,870 francs. A law of 1897 created new sources of taxation, giving &quot;communes&quot; the option of:
#New duties on alcohol.
#A municipal license duty on retailers of beverages.
#A special tax on wine in bottle.
#Direct taxes on horses and carriages, clubs, billiard tables, and dogs.
#Additional centimes to direct taxes.

From time to time there was agitation in France for the abolition of octroi duties, but it was never pushed very earnestly. In 1869, a commission considered the matter, and reported in favour of their retention. Octrois were finally abolished in 1948.

In Belgium, on the other hand, octrois were abolished in 1860, being replaced by an increase in customs and excise duties; and in 1903 those in Egypt were also abolished.

A similar tax, called the &quot;Alcabala&quot;, was collected in Spain and the Spanish colonies. This tax was in force in Mexico until a few years before the Mexican Revolution of 1910. In 1910, octroi duties still existed in Italy, Spain, Portugal, and some towns in Austria.

==Current==
Octroi was still in use in the 1990s by local authorities in Pakistan for domestic goods movements. Although abolished for general trade in 1997, octroi was still being charged on certain commodities such as electricity as late as 2006. As of 2013, octroi is levied in Ethiopia.

Cities in the Indian state of Maharashtra briefly abolished octroi in 2013 and replaced it with local body tax. However, octroi was reestablished there in 2014, due to decreased revenues from the local body tax. As of 1 July 2017, with the introduction of GST country-wide, the octroi has been abolished.

In the United States, 45 states and the District of Columbia collect sales tax on goods sold within their jurisdictions, with 38 of these states having additional local sales taxes. To prevent tax avoidance, a use tax may be levied on goods used within a state purchased by residents outside the state without payment of sales tax (or payment of lesser sales tax). These taxes are typically self-reported or estimated as there are typically no customs controls or inspection when goods move across state lines. For example, in New York, residents must itemize use tax on untaxed purchases of greater than $1,000 when filing their income tax return, but may opt to pay a flat income-based amount for all purchases of less than $1,000.

<text>The Mayor of Warsaw (officially in ) is the head of the executive of the capital of Poland elected directly during local elections for a term of five years.

== Overview ==

The first city mayor of Warsaw was Jan Andrzej Menich (1695–1696). The municipal self-government existed in Warsaw until World War II and was restored in 1990 (during the communist times, the National City Council – &quot;Miejska Rada Narodowa&quot; – governed in Warsaw). Since 1990, the structure of city government has been modified several times. Between 1975 and 1990 the Warsaw city mayors simultaneously led the Warsaw Voivode. In the years 1990-1994, the city mayor of Warsaw was elected by the city council. Subsequently, a controversial reform was introduced, transforming the city in the years of 1994–1999 into a loose municipal union of several gminas, dominated by one of them, the gmina Centrum encompassing the entire inner city. During this period, the mayor of gmina Centrum who was elected by its council was automatically designated as the city mayor of Warsaw, in spite of representing only a fraction of the population of the city. The city was becoming increasingly unmanageable, especially after the administrative reform of Poland in 1999 which further complicated the local government structure of Warsaw. In 2002, the new &quot;Warsaw Act&quot; of the Polish parliament restored Warsaw as a single urban gmina with the status of a city with powiat rights, led by a unified local government. At the same time, a significant reform was implemented in all Polish municipal governments, introducing direct elections of the wójt/town mayor/city mayor in all Polish gminas. The first city mayor of Warsaw elected according to these rules was Lech Kaczyński, who however resigned ahead of term when he was elected President of Polish Republic in 2005.

Warsaw has thereafter remained an urban gmina with the status of a city with powiat rights. Legislative power in Warsaw is vested in a unicameral Warsaw City Council (&quot;Rada Miasta&quot;), which comprises 60 members. Council members are elected directly every five years (since 2018 election). Like most legislative bodies, the city council divides itself into committees which have the oversight of various functions of the city government. The city mayor exercises the executive power in the city, being the superior of all unelected municipal officials and other employees and supervising all subsidiary entities of the city. 

The incumbent city mayor of Warsaw is Rafał Trzaskowski.

<text>Andytown was a town located in Broward County, Florida, United States at the intersection of U.S. 27 and I-75. It was demolished in 1979 in order to allow for the expansion of the Alligator Alley portion of Interstate 75.

When SR-84 (also known as &quot;Alligator Alley&quot;) and US-27 were each two-lane roads, the intersection was controlled by a traffic light. At the southeast corner of that intersection, there was a gas station with a convenience store, restaurant, bar, motel and a trailer where the Andytown pioneers (the Tsanos family of Kosta &quot;Gus&quot;/ Andy&#x27;s nephew, his wife Litsa and daughter Sophia Tsanos) lived until 1972. Gus and Litsa ( also Greek immigrants) worked at Andytown since 1964. Litsa&#x27;s brother John Theodore ran the gas station.

Andytown was named after Andreas D. Poulos. A Greek immigrant who bought the business (later named Andytown) in 1946 after stopping for a drink and making the owner of the truck stop an on the spot offer for the building and land. After Poulos died in 1972, his nephew Kosta &quot;Gus&quot; and wife Litsa Tsanos proudly inherited Andytown and continued to work there.

Andytown did not have electricity until 1953. As of 1954, it did not have any telephones; the nearest telephone was located away.

The 1960s TV adventure series &quot;The Everglades&quot; was partially filmed in Andytown.

In 1967, the Florida state government took the land for its future use in transportation projects by Eminent Domain. In 1979 the state announced it would demolish the buildings in Andytown in order to build entrance and exit ramps at the intersection of I-75 and US-27. The building was demolished in November 1979.

Other early Penalty artists included Crooked Lettaz, Blackjack, Foesum, and the group Capone-N-Noreaga, whose first release on the label was the single &quot;Stick You&quot; in 1996. The Capone-N-Noreaga album &quot;The War Report&quot; followed in 1997, which reached a peak of #21 on The &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album sales chart.

Between 1997 and 1999, Penalty released albums by artists such as Skull Duggery, Crooked Lettaz (David Banner and Kamikaze), Half a Mill, and 187 Fac. It also released the first two solo albums by Noreaga. The first, N.O.R.E., reached a peak of #3 on The Billboard 200 and featured the Top 40 hit &quot;Superthug&quot;, one of the earliest hits produced by The Neptunes (Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo).

Levine sold the remaining 50% of Penalty to Tommy Boy in 1999, staying on long enough to complete the transition before moving on to eventually become Vice-President of Urban Marketing and Artist Development at TVT Records. The artists on Penalty became Tommy Boy artists following the close of the acquisition.

Penalty was also one of the partners involved in producing and marketing the AND1 Mixtape Tour series of DVDs, featuring gameplay and interviews of streetball players. The label closed in 2006, when Levine became the head of Imperial Records for EMI Music.

<doc id="1326880" wikidata="Q983508" url="?curid=1326880" title="Phil Hogan">
<text>Philip Hogan (born 4 July 1960) is an Irish former Fine Gael politician who served as European Commissioner for Trade between 2019 and 2020, and previously European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development between 2014 and 2019.

He previously served as Irish Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government from 2011 to 2014 and Minister of State at the Department of Finance from 1994 to 1995, as well as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Carlow–Kilkenny constituency from 1989 to 2014.

==Early and private life==
Hogan was born in Kilkenny in 1960, and grew up on a farm near the village of Tullaroan.

He was educated locally in St. Joseph&#x27;s College, Freshford, and St. Kieran&#x27;s College, Kilkenny. Afterwards, he attended University College Cork, where he graduated with a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in Economics and Geography and subsequently a Higher Diploma in Education from the same university.

After completing his university studies, he returned to Tullaroan to manage his family farm. During that time period, he also founded an insurance and real estate business in Urlingford in the 1980s.

==Local politics==
Hogan first held political office at the age of 22, when he was elected to Kilkenny County Council. He retained that seat in the 1985 Local Elections when he topped the poll in his area.

Around the time of his 25th birthday, he was elected Council chair, the youngest council chairperson in the country. He served in this role on two separate occasions, first between 1985 and 1986 and then between 1989 and 1990.

In addition to his local political activities, Hogan was also a member of the South-Eastern Health Board between 1991 and 1999.

==National politics==
===1987–1994===
From his experience on Kilkenny County Council, he decided to contest the 1987 general election in an unsuccessful bid. Soon afterwards, he was subsequently elected to Seanad Éireann as a senator for the Industrial and Commercial Panel, serving between 1987 and 1989.

After serving as a Senator in Seanad Éireann for two years, Hogan was subsequently elected to the lower house (Dáil Éireann) for the Carlow–Kilkenny constituency in the 1989 general election.

During his first few years in the Dáil, he was appointed to a number of key positions in opposition, serving in his first few years as the Opposition Spokesperson for the Food Industry (1989–1991), Consumer Affairs (1991–1993), and subsequently Regional Affairs &amp; European Development (1993–1994).

Hogan also worked closely with the Fine Gael leader at the time, John Bruton. When Fine Gael formed the &#x27;rainbow coalition&#x27; government in 1994, Hogan was offered the opportunity to serve as Minister of State at the Department of Finance with special responsibility for the Office of Public Works.

=== Minister of State and Chair of the Fine Gael parliamentary party ===
Hogan served as Minister of State at the Department of Finance with special responsibility for the Office of Public Works between December 1994 and February 1995. However, he subsequently tendered his resignation when a staff member accidentally sent out budget details to a journalist before it was announced in the Dáil. At the time, opposition parties described Hogan as &#x27;the fall guy&#x27; for the budget leaks. Hogan was quoted as saying that &quot;he [had] no regrets about his decision to resign. My only concern in all of this is to ensure that the integrity of the government is maintained.&quot; Following his resignation, Hogan returned to a backbench position in the government. Despite the controversy surrounding the incident, Hogan was promoted as Chair of the Fine Gael parliamentary party at the age of 35, a position he held until 2001. As chair, Hogan had the opportunity to develop the organisational roots of Fine Gael and strengthened the network between councillors and sub-groups within the Fine Gael party.

===2002 leadership election and subsequent leadership contest===
In the run-up to the 2002 general election, Hogan was appointed Director of Organisation in Fine Gael. Upon the resignation of Michael Noonan as party leader of Fine Gael after the party&#x27;s poor results in that election, Hogan opted to contest the subsequent election for the new Fine Gael leader. While he conceded the contest to Enda Kenny, he was appointed as Opposition Spokesperson for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and became a key member of the Fine Gael parliamentary party as it started the rebuilding process. Hogan was again appointed as Director of Organisation for the 2007 general election. Soon after, he became the Opposition Spokesperson for Fine Gael on Environment, Heritage and Local government for the next 4 years.

===2011 general election and Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government===
In the lead up to the 2011 General Election, Hogan was appointed by Fine Gael Leader Enda Kenny as National Director of Elections for Fine Gael. Following the 2011 general election, the most successful in the history of Fine Gael, in which it and Labour formed the largest coalition government in the state&#x27;s history, Hogan was appointed by the Taoiseach as Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.

====Local government reform ====
Hogan was responsible for several pieces of legislation to reform local government and introduce gender quotas so as to increase the representation of women in Irish political life. Hogan introduced the Local Governments Bill, which aimed to streamline local governance, abolishing 80 town councils with the overall number of councils operating in Ireland going from 114 to 31. The reforms were enacted as the Local Government Reform Act 2014 and were planned to come into effect in 2014, to coincide with the next scheduled local elections.

====Gender quotas====
In addition to local government reform, Hogan also introduced reform within the political party framework. As part of a series of reforms, he introduced measures to support female participation in politics. The Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill 2011 would see parties lose half of their central exchequer funding unless the minority sex among their candidates accounts for 30 per cent of the entire national ticket at the next general election. The reform was brought in successfully alongside additional amendments to party political funding mechanisms.

In advance of the 2016 General Election, Hogan noted that &quot;this legislation has had the unprecedented effect of all major political parties selecting a minimum of 30% women candidates. It is my firm belief that this will benefit Irish political life, and indeed Irish society as a whole. Yes, there will naturally be teething problems, but this necessary acceleration of equality will benefit us all in the coming years&quot;.

====Taxes on property and water charges====
As Minister, Hogan had responsibility for implementing a series of reforms as part of Ireland&#x27;s agreement with the European Troika. In July 2011, he outlined plans for a €100 annual &quot;household charge&quot; that would become operable from January 2012 for two years, ahead of the introduction in 2014 of a full property tax based on site valuations. 250,000 households, some 14%, would be exempt from paying the charge. Hogan accepted that the tax would cause hardship to some families but presented it as the minimum possible charge he could have applied, saying it would cost &quot;a modest €2 per week&quot;. This tax was the precursor to the Local property tax later introduced by Michael Noonan.

Hogan also confirmed that a new State utility company, Irish Water, would be set up in the autumn to oversee the process of installing meters in all domestic dwellings. That would pave the way, he said, for domestic water charges in two years&#x27; time based on household usage. The new charges would be the first form of property tax to be introduced, since the then Fianna Fáil government led by Jack Lynch abolished domestic rates in 1977.

==EU Agriculture and Rural Development Commissioner==

On 10 September 2014, Hogan was nominated by Jean-Claude Juncker to be the European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development taking office on 1 November. As Commissioner, Hogan stipulated that his priorities would be to &quot;ensuring that rural development spending is well integrated into jobs- and growth-generating investment strategies at national and regional level&quot;.

=== Diplomatic Offensive ===
In 2016, Hogan embarked on a &quot;diplomatic offensive&quot; to build trade relations with non-EU states throughout the world and build new markets for European producers. So far, this has involved trade missions abroad to Mexico and Colombia, with trips to Japan, China and Kazakhstan scheduled for later in the year. Trade delegations of EU agri-businesses have accompanied the Commissioner on these trips to build relationships with third country counterparts.

===Mercosur trade deal===
In 2019 a free trade deal with Mercosur caused controversy in Ireland, with the farm lobby fearing competition from low-cost South American meat imports. Some of Hogan&#x27;s Fine Gael colleagues suggested denying his expected reappointment to the incoming commission because of his involvement in the negotiations.

===Conclusion of term===
In mid-September 2019, the Juncker Commission handed the reins of power over to Ursula von der Leyen and her College of Commissioners, ending Hogan&#x27;s term of office as Agriculture and Rural Development Commissioner.

==EU Trade Commissioner==
Von der Leyen&#x27;s proposal of Hogan as EU Trade Commissioner went smoothly through the EU Parliament when he &quot;made clear that tackling China&#x27;s unfair trade practices will be a major challenge during his five-year mandate.&quot; while he said that he would &quot;work to conclude&quot; the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment by the end of 2020. There was alarm in Parliament about the growing number of Chinese takeovers in the high-tech arena. Hogan was to &quot;take over as EU Trade Commissioner in November after the Parliament&#x27;s plenary confirms the full commission in a vote scheduled for 23 October.&quot; On 1 December, one month later than had originally been scheduled, Hogan, who was 59 years old at the time, was officially pronounced Trade Commissioner.

In light of the Oireachtas Golf Society scandal, Hogan resigned as EU Trade Commissioner on 26 August 2020.

===On Huawei===
On 17 January 2020, as Donald Trump was held to be bluffing by Hogan over the incompatibility of Five Eyes and Huawei. &quot;I think that is a bit of sabre-rattling. I don&#x27;t think that will actually happen... We can call [Trump&#x27;s] bluff on that one, the US laying down conditions over Huawei... We can&#x27;t say to Huawei, &#x27;you cannot come into the EU&#x27;, that&#x27;s not what we want.&quot; Hogan&#x27;s comments were echoed by German Chancellor Angela Merkel who said more diversification was needed &quot;so that we never make ourselves dependent on one firm. I think it is wrong to simply exclude someone per se.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Hogan is separated with one adult son. He is also a keen amateur golfer who has been known to compete internationally in competitions in The Netherlands and Ireland.

==Controversies==
On 24 August 2011, during an Oireachtas Golf Society outing, ex-Taoiseach John Bruton&#x27;s former administrator, Anne O&#x27;Connell, alleged that Hogan made a lewd comment in her direction. She immediately complained in writing to the Taoiseach Enda Kenny. Hogan issued a letter of apology a few days later saying: &quot;I unreservedly apologise for those remarks which were totally inappropriate in a personal sense. . . It was intended in a jocose and private basis and certainly not intended as insulting.&quot;

On 19 August 2020, Hogan attended an Oireachtas Golf Society dinner with 80 other attendees, while COVID-19 restrictions on such gatherings were in place. Although Hogan had been living in County Kildare—subject to a local lockdown during this time—he claimed that he was fully compliant with restrictions, despite having entered and exited the county on his way to Galway. In the fallout, known as &#x27;Golfgate&#x27;, a government minister in attendance, Dara Calleary, was forced to resign.
Hogan resigned from his role as European Commissioner for Trade on 26 August 2020.

On 21 September 2021, it was reported that the European Commission was examining reports that Hogan had taken a job at US lobbyist DLA Piper. The Commission has a code of conduct for former Commissioners, which includes a two-year cooling-off period during which they cannot lobby former colleagues on topics related to the area they oversaw. Hogan&#x27;s cooling-off period expired in August 2022.

<text>Olwyn Enright (born 1 July 1974) is an Irish former Fine Gael politician who served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Laois–Offaly constituency from 2002 to 2011.

==Early life and education==
Born in Birr, County Offaly, she is the daughter of Tom Enright, who served as a Fine Gael TD and Senator for over thirty years until his retirement in 2002. She was educated in St. Brendan&#x27;s Community School, Birr, and University College Dublin, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Civil Law degree in 1995. She attended the Law Society of Ireland in Blackhall Place, Dublin, qualifying as a solicitor in 1999.

==Political career==
Enright served on Offaly County Council between 1999 and 2002. She was first elected to Dáil Éireann at the 2002 general election, becoming the first female TD to represent the Laois–Offaly constituency. Within her first few weeks in the Dáil she was appointed Fine Gael Spokesperson for Education and Science.

In July 2005, Enright married Joe McHugh, who was then a Fine Gael Senator. In the 2007 general election, McHugh was elected to the Dáil to represent the Donegal North-East constituency. Enright retained her seat in Laois–Offaly, making them the third married couple to be elected to sit in the same Dáil.

Enright served as party Spokesperson on Social and Family Affairs from 2007 to 2010. In June 2010, she supported Richard Bruton&#x27;s leadership challenge to Enda Kenny. Following Kenny&#x27;s victory in a motion of confidence, Enright was not reappointed to the front bench.

==Retirement from politics==
On 30 August 2010, while pregnant with her second child, Enright announced that she would not seek to retain her seat at the next election, citing pressures of juggling her family life and career. After 9 years of service, she retired with a once off lump sum payment of €129,800 and an annual pension of €22,542.

She is Fine Gael&#x27;s director of elections for the 2024 general election.

<doc id="1326882" wikidata="Q559627" url="?curid=1326882" title="Jimmy Deenihan">
<text>Jimmy Deenihan (born 11 September 1952) is an Irish former Fine Gael politician who served as Minister of State for the Diaspora from 2014 to 2016, Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht from 2011 to 2014 and Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry from 1994 to 1997. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1987 to 2016. He was a Senator from 1983 to 1987, after being nominated by the Taoiseach.

Deenihan played Gaelic football for the Kerry county team in the 1970s and 1980s. He also played rugby with Garryowen.

==Early and private life==
Deenihan was born in Finuge, Lixnaw, County Kerry, in 1952. He was educated at St Michael&#x27;s College, Listowel and later at the Thomond College of Education in Limerick. He also spent time in college in the UK. He is married to Mary, daughter of former Kerry footballer John Dowling, who is a teacher of history and economics in Mercy Secondary School, Mounthawk.

==Football career==
===Club===
Deenihan had much success at club and divisional level with his local teams. At under-age level he won an under-14 North Kerry Championship with Finuge in 1963. Five years later in 1968, he won an under-16 North Kerry Championship with the Listowel Emmet&#x27;s club. He also played with the St Senan&#x27;s club at minor level. With Finuge Deenihan also won a North Kerry Senior League title in 1970, as well as a North Kerry Senior Championship title in 1987. With his local divisional team, Feale Rangers, he won two senior county championship medals in 1978 and 1980. While in college at St Mary&#x27;s University, Twickenham in London he played with the Kingdom club and won a London Senior Football Championship.

===Inter-county===
By the late 1960s, Deenihan was a key part of Kerry&#x27;s inter-county set-up and was playing on the county&#x27;s minor team. In 1970, he won a Munster minor medal, however, he never won an All-Ireland medal. Deenihan later moved on to the county&#x27;s under-21 team, where he won back-to-back Munster titles in 1972 and 1973, as well as an All-Ireland title in 1973.

By this stage, Deenihan was also a member of the Kerry senior football team. He won his first National Football League medal in 1973, however, Cork were the kingpins in the Munster Championship. Two years later in 1975, Deenihan captured his first Munster Championship and All-Ireland medals at senior level, under the new management of the legendary Mick O&#x27;Dwyer. It was the beginning of a glorious era for Kerry football and Deenihan played a key role in orchestrating much of the success.

In 1976, Deenihan won his second Munster title, however, Dublin gained revenge for the previous year by defeating Kerry in the All-Ireland final. 1977 was another frustrating year as Kerry won another set of National league and Munster titles but lost out to Dublin yet again, this time in the All-Ireland semi-final. By 1978, Kerry were ready for success. They easily won another Munster title and breezed into the All-Ireland final to face Dublin. The game itself is remembered for Mikey Sheehy&#x27;s cheeky goal which he scored by lobbing the ball over the head of Paddy Cullen. The final score was 5–11 to 0–9 and Deenihan had finally secured a second All-Ireland medal. In 1979, Deenihan captured a fifth provincial title before later capturing a third All-Ireland medal following another emphatic victory over Dublin.

In 1980, Kerry breezed through the Munster Championship once again and later defeated Roscommon to win a third consecutive All-Ireland title. In 1981, Deenihan was appointed captain of the Kerry senior football team. It was a very special year as he collected his seventh consecutive Munster Championship medal before later leading Kerry out in a fourth All-Ireland final appearance. On the day the men from &#x27;the Kingdom&#x27; easily defeated Offaly to give Deenihan his fifth All-Ireland medal. He rounded off the year by being presented with an All-Star award. At the start of 1982 Deenihan won a third National League medal when he captained Kerry to victory over Cork. Later that summer he broke his leg in training. He remained out of the game for eight months, meaning the injury effectively ended his inter-county career. Deenihan&#x27;s last appearance in a Kerry jersey was in May 1983 when he played a challenge game at the opening of the Tarbert GAA field.

Deenihan also won Railway Cup medals with Munster in 1975, 1976, 1978, 1981 and 1982.

==Political career==
===Seanad and Dáil Éireann===
As Deenihan&#x27;s inter-county football career was drawing to a close, his political career was just beginning. He unsuccessfully contested Kerry North at the November 1982 general election. In 1983, he was appointed to Seanad Éireann as a nominee of Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald. Deenihan later became involved in local politics as a member of Kerry County Council. He was elected to Dáil Éireann for the first time at the 1987 general election, for Kerry North, and was re-elected there at the six subsequent general elections.

Deenihan held a number of front bench portfolios for Fine Gael, including Youth and Sport (1988–1992) and Tourism and Trade (1992–1994) while Fine Gael were in opposition. In 1994 Fine Gael came to office without a general election, and on 20 December 1994 Deenihan was appointed by the Fine Gael–Labour–Democratic Left coalition government as Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry. In 1997, he became party spokesperson for the Office of Public Works. In the 2002 general election, which resulted in a near meltdown for Fine Gael, Deenihan saw his toughest election to date, being re-elected by a margin of almost 500 votes ahead of sitting TD Dick Spring. After the election of Enda Kenny as party leader he again received a Fine Gael front bench position as party spokesperson for Arts, Sport and Tourism. In the aftermath of the 2007 general election, he became party spokesperson on Defence, after being elected atop the poll in the Kerry North constituency with 12,697 votes. In July 2010, he was appointed as party spokesperson on Tourism, Culture and Sport.

===Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht===
At the 2011 general election, he was elected for the new constituency of Kerry North–West Limerick. On 9 March 2011, he was appointed a member of the Fine Gael–Labour government as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.

In May 2011, he set out proposals to acquire from the Bank of Ireland the old Irish Parliament building in College Green for the state, to use as a cultural venue.

In November 2011, he met with the stars of &quot;&quot;, while they were filming on location in Dublin.

He was reported by the &quot;Irish Examiner&quot; as having announced the awarding of the title of City of Culture 2014 to Limerick in June 2012 without indicating the criteria for selection.

===Minister of State for the Diaspora===
On 11 July 2014, he was dropped as a cabinet minister in a reshuffle, and was appointed by the government as Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach and at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with responsibility for the Diaspora.

His constituency was abolished at the 2016 general election; he stood for election in Kerry, but was not elected.

<doc id="1326883" wikidata="Q187622" url="?curid=1326883" title="French aircraft carrier Clemenceau">
<text>Clemenceau () was the French Navy&#x27;s sixth aircraft carrier and the lead ship of her class. The carrier served from 1961 to 1997 and was dismantled and recycled in 2009. The carrier was the second French warship to be named after Georges Clemenceau, the first being a laid down in 1939 but never finished.

&quot;Clemenceau&quot; and her sister ship served as the mainstays of the French fleet. During the carrier&#x27;s career, &quot;Clemenceau&quot; sailed more than during 3,125 days at sea. She was equipped to handle nuclear munitions to be delivered by her air complement and was later modified to fire nuclear-capable missiles. She took part in numerous exercises and cruises, seeing action during the Lebanese Civil War and Gulf War and in air operations over the former Yugoslavia.

==Description==

The development of &quot;Clemenceau&quot; represented France&#x27;s effort to produce its own class of multi-role aircraft carriers to replace the American and British ships provided at the end of World War II. The ship had a small but effective design, using some of the elements of United States carriers, but on a smaller scale. The vessels were given relatively heavy gun armament for their size, and some stability problems were encountered which required bulging the hull.

The &quot;Clemenceau&quot;-class aircraft carriers are of conventional CATOBAR design. The landing area was long by wide; it was angled at 8 degrees off of the ship&#x27;s axis. The flight deck is long. The forward aircraft elevator was to starboard, and the rear elevator was positioned on the deck edge to save hangar space. The forward of two catapults was at the bow to port, the aft catapult was on the angled landing deck. The hangar deck dimensions were by with overhead.

&quot;Clemenceau&quot; went through a major refit from September 1977 to November 1978. She was refitted again with new defensive systems from 1September 1985 to 31August 1987, this included the replacement of four of the 100 mm guns with a pair of Crotale surface-to-air missile launchers. She was modified in 1978 to enable her aircraft to deliver several AN 52 bombs. In 1993 she was modified again to take nuclear capable Air-Sol Moyenne Portée missiles.

==History==
===Career===
Throughout the course of the aircraft carrier&#x27;s lengthy career, it participated in the majority of French naval operations. From 12January to 5February 1962, &quot;Clemenceau&quot; participated in a NATO exercise known as &quot;BigGame&quot; with the United States Sixth Fleet in the western Mediterranean as an anti-submarine aircraft carrier. This was followed from 9March to 2April with another NATO exercise called OTAN Dawn Breeze VII, in the Gibraltar zone.

In January 1968, &quot;Clemenceau&quot; participated in the search for the lost submarine in the Mediterranean when contact was lost from port at Toulon. &quot;Minerve&quot; remained lost until French Defence Minister Florence Parly announced on 22 July 2019 that the wreck had been discovered.

During the same year, the carrier was deployed to the south Pacific for French nuclear bomb testing in Polynesia including Canopus, the first French hydrogen bomb. With the deployment of the fleet, codenamed Alfa Force (), the naval force present around two atolls represented more than 40% of the tonnage of the entire French navy. &quot;Clemenceau&quot; was the flagship of a fleet composed of forty ships.

During 1974–1977 &quot;Clemenceau&quot; was deployed off the African coast in the Indian Ocean in &quot;Operation Saphir I&quot; and &quot;Operation Saphir II&quot; in support of newly independent Djibouti. During the Lebanese Civil War &quot;Clemenceau&quot; was deployed in the East Mediterranean in 1983–84. The carrier rotated with , providing constant on-station air support to French peacekeepers in the Multinational Force in Lebanon FSMB and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon UNIFIL. The carrier&#x27;s main support engagement was in Operation Olifant. In 1987–1988 she participated in Operation Prométhée in the Gulf of Oman during the war between Iraq and Iran. The Promethée battle force (Task Force 623), included &quot;Clemenceau&quot;, the mine counter-measures support ship &quot;Loire&quot;, and s &quot;Meuse&quot;, &quot;Var&quot;, and &quot;Marne&quot;. In 1990, escorted by the cruiser and the tanker &quot;Var&quot;, she transported 40 helicopters (SA-341F/ -342 Gazelles, SA-330 Pumas), three Br-1050 Alizés and trucks to Iraq during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. The carrier was mainly engaged in &quot;Operation Salamandre&quot; in the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea during the conflict between Iraq and Kuwait. During 1993 to 1996 &quot;Clemenceau&quot; completed several tours including combat operations and air patrol over the former Yugoslavia in Operation Balbuzard () in order to support the UN&#x27;s troops, then &quot;Salamandre&quot; in the Adriatic Sea during the Yugoslav Wars.

&quot;Clemenceau&quot; operated around the world with a career total of more than one million nautical miles traveled, the equivalent of circumnavigating the globe 48 times. The carrier has passed 3,125 days at sea, with 80,000 hours of function, and conducted more than 70,000 catapult-launches.

In 1983, the &quot;bâtiment&quot; was the first unit of the French Navy to embark female personnel. Three women were assigned on board: one &quot;maître principal&quot;, one &quot;secrétaire militaire&quot; and one &quot;premier maître&quot;.

Loyal to the tradition of the French Navy, &quot;Clemenceau&quot; welcomed on board numerous fine art painters, some for a week and others for up to two months.

===Disposal===

On 31 December 2005, &quot;Clemenceau&quot; left Toulon to be dismantled in Alang, India despite protests about improper disposal and a lack of facilities for the management of toxic waste.

On 6January 2006, the Supreme Court of India temporarily denied access to Alang. After having been boarded by activists, held by Egyptian authorities, and then transiting the Suez Canal on 15January, a court ruling by the &quot;Conseil d&#x27;État&quot; ordered &quot;Clemenceau&quot; to return to French waters. Able UK, based at the Graythorp yard near Hartlepool received a disassembly contract to use accepted practices in scrapping the ship. The dismantling started on 18November 2009 and the break-up was completed by the end of2010.

==General arrangement==

==In popular culture==
* A 1985 television commercial for the Citroën Visa GTI car was shot aboard &quot;Clemenceau&quot;. A race pits the car against a Dassault Étendard IV; both continue off the end of the carrier, with the small automobile briefly keeping pace with the aircraft before plummeting into the ocean. Seconds later, though, the car triumphantly emerges, perched on the foredeck of a surfacing &quot;Agosta&quot;-class submarine.

<doc id="1326886" wikidata="Q321837" url="?curid=1326886" title="German Bight">
<text>The German Bight (; ; ; ; ; sometimes also the German Bay) is the southeastern bight of the North Sea bounded by the Netherlands and Germany to the south, and Denmark and Germany to the east (the Jutland peninsula). To the north and west it is limited by the Dogger Bank. The Bight contains the Frisian and Danish Islands. The Wadden Sea is approximately ten to twelve kilometres wide at the location of the German Bight. The Frisian islands and the nearby coastal areas are collectively known as Frisia. The southern portion of the bight is also known as the Heligoland Bight. Between 1949 and 1956 the BBC Sea Area Forecast (Shipping Forecast) used &quot;Heligoland&quot; as the designation for the area now referred to as German Bight.

== Use==
The German Bight contains some of Germany&#x27;s largest national parks by area, the aim of which is to protect the Wadden Sea, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the &quot;nature&quot; category. Due to being divided among three different states of Germany those protected areas fall into three different national parks, namely the Lower Saxon Wadden Sea National Park, the Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea National Park and the small Hamburg Wadden Sea National Park mostly around the island of Neuwerk. Despite or maybe because of its unique natural environment, the German Bight is also subject to intense economic and recreational use with the Wadden Sea being one of Germany&#x27;s most popular tourist destinations. Mudflat hiking is a particularly popular tourist activity usually undertaken with licensed guides employed by the national park service. Fishing and mussel banks (particularly oysters) are other important economic activities with &quot;crangon crangon&quot; a particularly well regarded product of local fishing. Energy extraction also plays an important role with Germany&#x27;s only offshore oil rig (Mittelplate) located in the German Bight and an increasing penetration by offshore wind farms such as Alpha Ventus. While offshore wind farms are more expensive to build and require more expensive operations for maintenance and repair than land-based wind turbines the steadier winds out at sea allow for steadier power output and a higher capacity factor. Both these advantages are important enough to justify the higher cost as Germany is in the process of phasing out nuclear energy and plans to phase out all fossil fuels thereafter leaving few dispatchable electricity sources.

== Traffic==
The German Bight has also played an important role as a shipping lane since medieval times with the approach to the Port of Hamburg passing through it and then the Elbe River estuary. Other important ports along the German Bight are Bremerhaven/Bremen, Emden (important for export of motorcars, particularly those made at the local VW plant) and the JadeWeserPort at Wilhelmshaven which is Germany&#x27;s only deepwater port. Shipping in the German Bight often relies on tidal channels (called &quot;Priel&quot; in German) for shipping lanes, but as the sediment is moved around by tides, wind and waves and as ships reach ever greater draughts extensive dredging is necessary to keep shipping lanes open. Some of the East Frisian Islands can be reached on foot at low tide and the sailing schedules of local ferries are tide-dependent. While the mudflats are usually barred to anything but foot traffic and more heavily protected areas of the national parks are off-limits to all but scientists, there is a scheduled horse drawn carriage service from the mainland to Neuwerk locally known as a Wattwagen (mud flats wagon). The island of Sylt can be reached by the railway-only Hindenburgdamm causeway which was built after World War I when the port on the mainland from which ferries to Sylt had left up to that point came under Danish rule following the 1920 Schleswig plebiscites. Some of the Halligen also have railway connections to the mainland but in some cases those are only usable at low tide. Those lines are the Dagebüll–Oland–Langeneß island railway and the Lüttmoorsiel-Nordstrandischmoor island railway. While there is no scheduled traffic, island residents can use their own (usually self-built) rail vehicles. In the past those were sail bogeys, but nowadays most are diesel driven draisines with battery-electric railcars increasingly gaining ground. The rail lines are also used by the government for coastal protection work and to transport goods and personnel.

<text>Olivia Mitchell (born 31 July 1947) is an Irish former Fine Gael politician who served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dublin South constituency from 1997 to 2016.

Mitchell was born in Birr, County Offaly. She was educated at Dominican College on Eccles Street and at Trinity College Dublin, where she qualified with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics and Politics. She was an Economics teacher before entering politics. She first held political office in 1985, when she was elected to Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council. She was Cathaoirleach (Chair) of the council from 1995 to 1996. She served on the council until 2003. She was an unsuccessful candidate for Dublin South at the 1989 and 1992 general elections.

Mitchell was first elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fine Gael TD for the Dublin South constituency at the 1997 general election, and was re-elected at the 2002 general election with 5,568 first preferences. She increased this vote significantly at the 2007 general election, polling 9,037 first preferences.

In 2001, she received her first front bench position as Spokesperson for Housing and Local Government. She has also served as Opposition spokesperson for Health and Children (2002–2004). In Enda Kenny&#x27;s reshuffle in 2004, she took on the Transport portfolio. From 2007 to 2010, she was spokesperson for Arts, Sport and Tourism.

In June 2010, she supported Richard Bruton&#x27;s leadership challenge to Enda Kenny. Following Kenny&#x27;s victory in a motion of confidence, Mitchell was not re-appointed to the front bench. From October 2010 to March 2011, she was party deputy spokesperson on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources with special responsibility for Competition and Consumer Protection.

In its final report, the Mahon Tribunal&#x27;s investigation into planning corruption in the Dublin area found Mitchell to have received an inappropriate payment of £500 from Frank Dunlop at the time of the 1992 general election. The Mahon Report found that Mitchell had held meetings with Dunlop and Owen O&#x27;Callaghan in relation to the Quarryvale project, and was a supporter of the project. &quot;While the evidence would suggest Cllr Mitchell did not solicit the contribution, she nonetheless accepted it in the knowledge of Mr Dunlop&#x27;s close association with the project,&quot; the report found.

She did not contest the 2016 general election.

<doc id="1326889" wikidata="Q532060" url="?curid=1326889" title="Grip (software)">
<text>Grip is a free CD player and CD ripper.

The software is rather similar to Audiograbber on Windows - without sound card capture feature; it is fast, lightweight, and easy to compile.

Grip uses a selection of encoders, including cdparanoia.

==History==
The original author, Mike Oliphant, originally registered Grip as a project at SourceForge.net, the free and open-source software website, on March 17, 2000, and made pre-compiled binaries for RPM Linux distributions available. However, by mid-2005 development had stalled, and while the software was still very much usable, in effect it languished without a maintainer. In late 2016, a new maintainer, Johnny Solbu, stepped up by forking the project into &quot;Grip 2&quot; based on version 3.3.1 of the original. In April 2017, he gained access to the original project page and stated on the forked project page his intention on moving development back to the old project, and released v3.3.5.

== Features ==
* Full-featured CD player with a small screen footprint in &quot;condensed&quot; mode
* Database lookup/submission to share track information over the net
* HTTP proxy support for those behind firewalls
* Loop, shuffle, and playlist modes
* Ripping of single, multiple, or partial tracks
* Encoding of ripped .wav files into Ogg Vorbis, MP3 or FLAC files.
* Simultaneous rip and encode
* Support for multiple encode processes on SMP machines
* Adding ID3v1/v2 tags to MP3 files after encoded
* Cooperating with DigitalDJ, a MySQL-based MP3 jukebox

<text>Denis Naughten (born 23 June 1973) is an Irish former independent politician who served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Roscommon–Galway constituency from 2016 to 2024, and previously from 2007 to 2016 for the Roscommon–South Leitrim constituency and from 1997 to 2007 for the Longford–Roscommon constituency. He was appointed Chair of the Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands in September 2020. He previously served as Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment from 2016 to 2018. He was a Senator for the Agricultural Panel from January 1997 to June 1997.
He was elected as a Fine Gael TD but sat as an independent from July 2011, having lost the Fine Gael parliamentary party whip.

==Family and early life==
Naughten was born in Drum, County Roscommon, in 1973. He was educated at St. Aloysius College, Athlone, University College Dublin and University College Cork, where he studied for a PhD in Food Microbiology, but did not complete it. His father, Liam Naughten, was also a Fine Gael TD and Senator. His brother, John Naughten, was a Fine Gael county councillor.

==Political career==
Naughten was elected at a by-election to Seanad Éireann in 1997, to the seat vacant since the death of his father. Following, the 1997 general election, he was elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fine Gael TD for the Longford–Roscommon constituency and was re-elected at the 2002 general election. He was also a member of Roscommon County Council and the Western Health Board from January 1997 to October 2003.

Within his first few weeks in the Dáil, he became Fine Gael Spokesperson on Youth Affairs, School Transport and Adult Education. Between 2000 and 2001, he served as Spokesperson on Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Naughten declined to stand in the party&#x27;s leadership election in 2002, having at first indicated an interest in standing. He was later appointed Spokesperson on Transport. He was Spokesperson on Agriculture from 2004 to 2007.

He was re-elected at the 2007 general election for the new constituency of Roscommon–South Leitrim. He was Spokesperson on Immigration and Integration from 2007 to 2010. In June 2010, he supported Richard Bruton&#x27;s leadership challenge to Enda Kenny. Following Kenny&#x27;s victory in a motion of confidence, Naughten was not re-appointed to the front bench. In October 2010, he was appointed Deputy Spokesperson on Health, with special responsibility for Primary Care and Disability.

He was re-elected at the 2011 general election. He voted against the government&#x27;s decision to close the Roscommon County Hospital emergency department on 6 July 2011. He lost the Fine Gael party whip the following day. On 13 September 2013, he and six other expellees formed the Reform Alliance, described as a &quot;loose alliance&quot; rather than a political party. He was re-elected for Roscommon–Galway at the 2016 general election.

Naughten was appointed as Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment in Taoiseach Enda Kenny&#x27;s Fine Gael/Independent minority government after two months of negotiation following the 2016 general election. He later resigned from this post on 11 October 2018, following controversy surrounding a series of meetings he attended with the leading bidder for his department&#x27;s National Broadband Plan that occurred during the project&#x27;s procurement process. He was succeeded by Richard Bruton.

He stood for election for Ceann Comhairle at the first sitting of the 33rd Dáil on 20 February 2020, but was defeated by Seán Ó Fearghaíl. Naughten was subsequently named by Leo Varadkar as Leas-Cheann Comhairle on an acting basis due to a deferred election caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

On 13 February 2023, he announced that he would not contest the next general election.

<text>Eugene O&#x27;Curry (, 20 November 179430 July 1862) was an Irish philologist and antiquary.

==Life==
He was born at Doonaha, near Carrigaholt, County Clare, the son of Eoghan Ó Comhraí, a farmer, and his wife Cáit. Eoghan had spent some time as a travelling pedlar and had developed an interest in Irish folklore and traditional music. Unusually for someone of his background, he appears to have been literate and he is known to have possessed a number of Irish manuscripts. It is likely that Eoghan was primarily responsible for his son&#x27;s education.

Having spent some years working on his father&#x27;s farm and as a school teacher, Eugene O&#x27;Curry moved to Limerick around 1824 and spent seven years working there at a mental hospital. He married Anne Broughton, daughter of John Broughton of Killaderry near Broadford, County Limerick on 3 October 1824. O&#x27;Curry was a supporter of Catholic Emancipation and in 1828 wrote a poem congratulating Daniel O&#x27;Connell on his election as an MP.

During this period O&#x27;Curry was establishing a reputation for his knowledge of the Irish language and Irish history, and, by 1834, was in correspondence with the antiquary John O&#x27;Donovan. He was employed, from 1835 to 1842, on O&#x27;Donovan&#x27;s recommendation, in the topographical and historical section of the Irish Ordnance Survey. O&#x27;Donovan went on to marry O&#x27;Curry&#x27;s sister-in-law, Mary Anne Broughton, in 1840. O&#x27;Curry spent much of the remainder of his life in Dublin and earned his living by translating and copying Irish manuscripts; the catalogue of Irish manuscripts in the British Museum (1849) was compiled by him for a fee of £100. O&#x27;Curry was responsible for the transcripts of Irish manuscripts from which O&#x27;Donovan edited &quot;The Annals of the Four Masters&quot; between 1848 and 1851.

In 1851, he was elected a member of the Royal Irish Academy and, on the founding of the Catholic University of Ireland in 1854, he was appointed professor of Irish history and archaeology. He worked with George Petrie on the &quot;Ancient Music of Ireland&quot; (1855). In 1852, he and O&#x27;Donovan proposed the &quot;Dictionary of the Irish Language&quot;, which was eventually begun by the Royal Irish Academy in 1913 and finally completed in 1976.

His lectures were published by the university in 1860, and give a better knowledge of Irish medieval literature than can be obtained from any other source. Three other volumes of lectures were published posthumously, under the title &quot;On the Manners and Customs of the Ancient Irish&quot; (1873). His voluminous transcripts, notably eight huge volumes of ancient Irish law, testify to his unremitting industry. The Celtic Society, of the council of which he was a member, published two of his translations of medieval tales.

He died of a heart attack, at his home in Dublin, on 30 July 1862, and was survived by two sons and two daughters.

He is buried at Glasnevin cemetery, Dublin. O&#x27;Curry Road in the Tenters area of Dublin 8 is named in his honour. O&#x27;Curry GAA club on the Loop Head peninsula and O&#x27;Curry Street in Kilkee are also named after him.

<text>Adolph Frederick Rupp (September 2, 1901 – December 10, 1977) was an American college basketball coach. He is ranked seventh in total victories by a men&#x27;s NCAA Division I college coach, winning 876 games in 41 years of coaching at the University of Kentucky. Rupp is also second among all men&#x27;s college coaches in all-time winning percentage (.822), trailing only Mark Few. Rupp was enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on April 13, 1969. Rupp played college basketball at Kansas under Phog Allen.

== Early life ==
Rupp was born September 2, 1901, in Halstead, Kansas, to Heinrich Rupp, a German immigrant, and Anna Lichi, a Palatinate (Quirnheim, Germany) immigrant. The fourth of six children, Rupp grew up on a 163-acre farm that his parents had homesteaded. He began playing basketball as a young child, with the help of his mother, who made a ball for him by stuffing rags into a gunnysack. &quot;Mother sewed it up and somehow made it round,&quot; he recalled in 1977. &quot;You couldn&#x27;t dribble it. You couldn&#x27;t bounce it either.&quot;

Rupp was a star for the Halstead High School basketball team, one of the first in the area to play with a real basketball. He averaged 19 points a game. Former teammates described Rupp as the team&#x27;s unofficial coach.

After high school, Rupp attended the University of Kansas from 1919 to 1923. He worked part-time at the student Jayhawk Cafe to help pay his college expenses. In 1922, Adolph pledged and was initiated into the Iota chapter of International Fraternity of Delta Sigma Pi. Later in 1966, he was named Deltasig of the Year by the fraternity. He was a reserve on the basketball team under Hall of Fame coach Phog Allen from 1919 to 1923. Assisting Allen during that time was his former coach and inventor of the game of basketball, James Naismith, whom Rupp also got to know well during his time in Lawrence.

In Rupp&#x27;s junior and senior college seasons (1921–22 and 1922–23), Kansas (KU) had outstanding basketball squads. Later, both of these standout Kansas teams would be awarded the Helms National Championship, recognizing the Jayhawks as the top team in the nation during those seasons.

He received an MA from Teachers College, Columbia University.

==Coaching career==
===High school===

Rupp began his career in coaching by accepting a teaching job at Burr Oak High School, Kansas. After a one-year stay, Rupp moved on to Marshalltown, Iowa, where he coached wrestling, a sport he knew nothing about at the time and learned from a book. He led the Marshalltown team to a state wrestling title in 1926.

In 1926–30, Rupp accepted the basketball head coaching position at Freeport High School, (Freeport, Illinois) where he also taught history and economics. During his four years at Freeport, Rupp compiled a record of 66–21 and guided his team to a third-place finish in the 1929 state tournament. While at Freeport High School Rupp started William &quot;Mose&quot; Mosely, the first African-American to play basketball at Freeport and the second to graduate from the school. 

University of Illinois head basketball coach Craig Ruby was invited to speak at the team banquet following the 1929–30 season. Ruby informed Rupp of the Kentucky head coaching job and followed up by recommending him for the job.

During his time in Freeport, Rupp met his future wife, Esther Schmidt.

===Kentucky===
Rupp coached the University of Kentucky men&#x27;s basketball team from 1930 to 1972. There, he gained the nicknames, &quot;Baron of the Bluegrass&quot;, and &quot;The Man in the Brown Suit&quot;. Rupp was inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa at Kentucky in 1937. Rupp&#x27;s Wildcat teams won four NCAA championships (1948, 1949, 1951, 1958), one National Invitation Tournament title in 1946, appeared in 20 NCAA tournaments, had six NCAA Final Four appearances, captured 27 Southeastern Conference regular season titles, and won 13 Southeastern Conference tournaments. Rupp&#x27;s Kentucky teams also finished ranked #1 on six occasions in the final Associated Press college basketball poll and four times in the United Press International (Coaches) poll. In addition, Rupp&#x27;s 1966 Kentucky squad—nicknamed &quot;Rupp&#x27;s Runts&quot;— finished runner-up in the NCAA tournament and Rupp&#x27;s 1947 Wildcats finished runner-up in the National Invitation Tournament. Rupp&#x27;s 1933 and 1954 Kentucky squads were also retroactively named national champions by the Helms Athletic Foundation; his 1934, 1947, and 1948 teams were retroactively named the national champion by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.

In his 41 seasons as UK coach, Rupp coached 32 All-Americans, chosen 50 times, 52 All-SEC players, chosen 91 times, 44 NBA Draft Picks, 2 National Players-of-the-Year, 7 Olympic Gold Medalists, and 4 Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame members. He was a 5-time National Coach-of-the-Year award winner, and a 7-time Conference Coach-of-the-Year award winner. Rupp was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, College Basketball Hall of Fame, Kentucky Athletic Hall of Fame, Kansas Athletic Hall of Fame, University of Kentucky Athletic Hall of Fame, and Helms Athletic Foundation Hall of Fame. Further, since 1972, the Adolph Rupp Trophy, considered one of the nation&#x27;s premier basketball awards, has been given by the Commonwealth Athletic Club to the top men&#x27;s college basketball player. In addition, the University of Kentucky retired a jersey in his honor in the rafters of Rupp Arena, a 23,500-seat arena named after him, dedicated in 1976.

Rupp was forced into retirement in March 1972, at the age of 70. At the time, this was the mandatory retirement age for all University of Kentucky employees.

===1951 point shaving scandal===
Rupp was the head coach at Kentucky during the point shaving scandal of 1951. On October 20, 1951, former Kentucky players Alex Groza, Bill Spivey, Ralph Beard, and Dale Barnstable were arrested for taking bribes from gamblers to shave points during the National Invitation Tournament game against the Loyola Ramblers in the 1948–49 season. This game occurred during the same year that Kentucky won their second straight NCAA title under Rupp. Rupp and the university were criticized by the presiding judge, Saul Streit, for creating an atmosphere for the violations to occur and for &quot;failing in his duty to observe the amateur rules, to build character, and to protect the morals and health of his charges&quot;. Rupp denied any knowledge of the point shaving and no evidence was ever brought against him to show he was connected to the incident in any way.

A subsequent NCAA investigation found that Kentucky had committed several rule violations, including giving illegal spending money to players on several occasions, and also allowing some ineligible athletes to compete. As a result, the Southeastern Conference voted to ban Kentucky from competing for a year and the NCAA requested all other basketball-playing members not to schedule Kentucky, with eventually none doing so. Because of these actions, Kentucky was forced to cancel the entire 1952–53 basketball season. Years later, Walter Byers, the first executive director of the NCAA, unofficially referred to this punishment as the first de facto NCAA death penalty, despite the current rule only coming into effect in 1985. The NCAA&#x27;s website similarly stated &quot;In effect, it was the Association&#x27;s first &quot;death penalty,&quot; though its enforcement was binding only through constitutional language that required members to compete against only those schools that were compliant with NCAA rules. Despite fears that it would resist, Kentucky accepted the penalty ...&quot;

===1966 championship game against Texas Western===
A pivotal game in Rupp&#x27;s career and for college basketball in general was the 1966 NCAA championship game at Cole Field House against Texas Western, coached by Don Haskins. It featured Kentucky&#x27;s all-white team against Texas Western&#x27;s all-black starting five, and took place at the height of the Civil Rights Movement. The game, which Texas Western won 72–65, helped accelerate the ongoing integration movement in college basketball, as well as the overall recruiting approach of the SEC, ACC, and SWC conferences.

===Coaching style and philosophy===
Rupp was an early innovator of the fast break and set offense. His offense consisted of 10–15 set plays (with variations for each), complete with extensive offensive movement and screening. Early basketball innovations such as the &quot;guard around&quot; play and inside screen were first developed by Rupp in the 1930s. Likewise, he was an early proponent of the fast break, which his Kentucky teams used at every opportunity throughout his career. For most of his coaching career he preferred only a tight man-to-man defense, but during the 1963–64 season, he became one of the first coaches to begin experimenting with the trapping 1–3–1 zone defense, and his Kentucky teams used this defense at times for the remainder of his career. Throughout his time at Kentucky, Rupp&#x27;s recruiting focused largely on local and regional talent; over 80% of Rupp&#x27;s Kentucky players came from the state of Kentucky.

Rupp strongly emphasized the fundamentals of basketball, both on offense and defense, and overall discipline. He believed that excellence was achieved only through repetition, and his practices stressed individual instruction, precision, and continuity. Rupp was very demanding of his players, constantly putting extreme pressure on them in practice, and mercilessly berating them for any mistakes.

===Superstitions===
Rupp, a very superstitious man, was known to carry a &quot;lucky&quot; buckeye in his pocket. His favorite sign of good luck was finding a pin, especially a bobby pin, particularly on a game day. The depth of his superstitious nature was revealed while he was coaching at Freeport, when he had bought a new blue suit to replace his old brown one. He wore his new suit to a game, and his team got beaten badly. Rupp never again wore anything but a brown suit to games.

===Civil rights===
Rupp hired assistant coach Neil Reed in 1960 to help recruit African-American players and once asked the UK president to leave the SEC so he could recruit black players. Rupp tried his best to sign in-state black players Wes Unseld (the first black player Rupp made a formal scholarship offer in 1964) and Butch Beard before both picked Louisville. Rupp signed his first black player, troubled 7&#x27;2&quot; center Tom Payne, who played in the 1971 season. After his lone varsity season, Payne, who was on the verge of flunking out of school, joined the NBA&#x27;s first-ever supplemental draft.

==Executive career==
===Memphis Tams===
In April 1972, Rupp was named team president of the Memphis Pros, soon to become the Memphis Tams, of the American Basketball Association. In June 1973 Rupp quit as Tams president, calling the ABA &quot;bush league&quot; and saying it &quot;would never survive&quot;. 

===Kentucky Colonels===
In September 1973, Rupp was hired as Vice President of the Board of the Kentucky Colonels of the American Basketball Association.

== Death ==
Rupp died of spinal cancer at age 76 in Lexington, Kentucky, on December 10, 1977, on a night when Kentucky defeated his alma mater, Kansas, at Allen Fieldhouse in Lawrence, Kansas. The game that night was promoted as &quot;Adolph Rupp Night&quot;. He is buried in Lexington Cemetery. Rupp Arena, the current home of the Kentucky men&#x27;s basketball team, is named in his honor.

<text>Steven Taylor is a fictional character played by Peter Purves in the long-running British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. A space pilot from Earth in the future, he was a companion of the First Doctor and a regular in the programme from 1965 to 1966. Steven appeared in 10 stories (45 episodes).

==Appearances==

===Television===
Steven first appears in the serial &quot;The Chase&quot;, when the Doctor and his companions, Ian, Barbara, and Vicki, find him on the planet Mechanus where he crash-landed two years before. He joins the Doctor and Vicki as a companion in the following serial, &quot;The Time Meddler&quot;, when they discover that he stowed-away in the TARDIS after having escaped the burning Mechanoid City. Steven is a strong-willed individual, who is more capable when there is something physical to do than when there is thinking to be done. He has a finely developed sense of right and wrong, and places a high value on human life.

Steven follows the Doctor through &quot;The Daleks&#x27; Master Plan&quot;, a dark and dangerous adventure that takes the lives of Sara Kingdom and Katarina. He argues with the Doctor when he refuses to prevent the events of &quot;The Massacre of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Eve&quot;. Steven is ready to part company with the Doctor over the deaths that happened, in particular that of a woman named Anne Chaplet. He rejoins the Doctor, however, at the same time that they acquired a new travelling companion, a young woman by the name of Dorothea &quot;Dodo&quot; Chaplet, who is apparently a descendant of Anne&#x27;s.

Steven&#x27;s journey eventually ends during &quot;The Savages&quot;, when he decides to accept the responsibility of leading the combined society of Savages and Elders that is attempting a lasting peace. His life beyond that is not explored in the series.

The exact time period that Steven originally came from is not specified in the television series. However, in &quot;The Daleks&#x27; Master Plan&quot;, set in the year 4000, Steven states that he comes from &quot;hundreds of years&quot; before that period.

An older Steven, still played by Purves, returns in an episode of the 60th anniversary spin-off &quot;Tales of the TARDIS&quot;, alongside Maureen O&#x27;Brien as Vicki. Drawn from their respective timelines, Steven and Vicki recall the events of The Time Meddler and their lives after leaving the First Doctor. Steven became a king and has children and grandchildren. Their episode ends with the off-screen voice of William Hartnell, suggesting the First Doctor has joined them.

===Other media===
Steven appears in three spin-off novels: &quot;The Empire of Glass&quot; (1995) of the Virgin Missing Adventures range, and &quot;Salvation&quot; (1999) and &quot;Bunker Soldiers&quot; (2001) of the Past Doctor Adventures range. In addition, he appears in many stories of the &quot;BBC Short Trips&quot; and the &quot;Virgin Decalog&quot;. Steven, often voiced by Purves, also appears in many Big Finish Productions audio dramas including &quot;The Five Companions&quot; alongside the Fifth Doctor (Peter Davison), &quot;The War to End All Wars&quot;, which looks in depth at his life after he left the Doctor, and &quot;The Secret History&quot; in which he and Vicki meet the Fifth Doctor after a complex plot by the Monk sees the Fifth Doctor replace the First during a crucial adventure.

==Casting==
Peter Purves originally auditioned for the part of a giant insect in &quot;The Web Planet&quot;, but failed. He then appeared in the third episode of &quot;The Chase&quot; as Morton Dill, a &quot;hillbilly&quot;. He then appears as Steven in the final episode. Purves had grown &quot;the beginnings of a beard&quot; to disguise the connection between the two characters of the serial. The production team had been looking for a character to replace Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) and Ian Chesterton (William Russell), who were leaving in the serial, and Purves was suggested by both William Hartnell and Maureen O&#x27;Brien. Early drafts of the story used the names &quot;Bruck&quot; and &quot;Michael&quot; for the character of the captured astronaut, before settling on &quot;Steven&quot;.

<doc id="1326898" wikidata="Q1644016" url="?curid=1326898" title="Tommy Boy Records">
<text>Tommy Boy Records is an American independent record label and multimedia brand founded in 1981 by Tom Silverman. The label is credited with helping and launching the music careers of Queen Latifah, Amber, Afrika Bambaataa, Stetsasonic, Digital Underground, Coolio, De La Soul, House of Pain, Naughty By Nature, and Force MDs.

==History==
===1981–1985: Early Years===
Tom Silverman created Tommy Boy Music in 1981 in his New York City apartment with a $5,000 loan from his parents. The label was an outgrowth of Silverman&#x27;s &quot;Dance Music Report&quot; bi-weekly publication, which spanned 14 years, beginning in September 1978.

===1985–2002: Partnership with Warner Bros. Records===
In 1985, Warner Bros. Records entered into a partnership with Tommy Boy and acquired half of the label, and it allowed the label to use independent distribution as it saw fit, with the option to distribute artists through the major-label channel through Warner Bros. Records or sister label Reprise Records.

Monica Lynch, who was one of the first employees hired by Tom Silverman, became president of the label in 1985. As A&amp;R for the label, she signed and managed Queen Latifah, De La Soul, and host of hip hop musicians. Even though the male–female power struggle in hip hop music has always been present, Lynch and her peers said that the early days of hip hop were magical times for women looking to make it in the record business. Julie Greenwald, Sylvia Robinson, DJ Jazzy Joyce, Mona Scott, and Claudine Joseph also made their mark on different areas of hip-hop. Greenwald and Robinson, like Lynch, became powerful music executives. For more than 25 years, DJ Jazzy Joyce has been one of the most visible and in-demand female turntablists. And Scott and Joseph have managed the careers of some of the biggest names in hip-hop. &quot;Hip-hop provided a tremendous amount of opportunities for women, which might seem antithetical because of the association that many people have with misogyny and hip-hop,&quot; says Lynch. &quot;There has been a lot of attention paid to misogynist lyrics in hip-hop over the years, and I&#x27;m not going to defend or damn it. I think it exists, but some of the people who helped put those records out were women.&quot;According to Jeff &quot;Chairman&quot; Mao, a key DJ in 1990s underground hip-hop and online hip-hop radio host, Monica Lynch managed the careers of Afrika Bambaataa &amp; Soulsonic Force, Stetsasonic, Queen Latifah, De La Soul, Naughty by Nature among others.

The label had several joint ventures in the mid 1990s including Penalty Recordings, Stepsun, Beyond, and Ignition. The label also had deals with labels such as Timber Records and distribution deals with Outcaste Records and 75 Ark, while also giving independent distribution to sister imprints that already had label deals with WEA, including American Recordings&#x27; Ill Labels, Mute Records&#x27; NovaMute, and Cold Chillin Records&#x27; Livin&#x27; Large.

In 1997, Tommy Boy launched an imprint label called Upaya to pursue the growing interest in spirituality and spiritual/world music. The imprint Tommy Boy Gospel was launched in 1998 under the direction of Max Seigel and Marvie Wright. That same year, the imprints Tommy Boy Black Label, which specialized in underground hip hop music, and Tommy Boy Silver Label, which specialized in dance music, were founded.

In 2001, while still affiliated with Warner Music, Tommy Boy Records founder Tom Silverman formed Tommy Boy Films, a TV and film division with Kung Faux creator and Dubtitled Entertainment founder, Michael &quot;Mic&quot; Neumann.

===2002–2021: Independence===
In 2002, Tommy Boy Records became independent again after it ended its joint venture with Warner Bros. Records, which wanted greater unit sales, and the master tapes released until that time became property of Warner Music, while the Tommy Boy trademark remained with Tom Silverman. The then-current Tommy Boy music artists were shopped to various WEA labels, the Tommy Boy television and film divisions were merged with the Tommy Boy music division, and the resulting company was rebranded as Tommy Boy Entertainment. Tommy Boy then began licensing its trademark to Warner Music for use on reissues through Rhino/Atlantic Records.

In 2017, because of Warner Music&#x27;s divestment requirements as a result of its purchase of Parlophone, Tommy Boy was able to reacquire its pre-2002 catalogue and the catalogues of Brand Nubian, Grand Puba, and Club Nouveau. In 2018, Tommy Boy also acquired Amherst Records, Harlem Music, and Halwill Music, which hold masters and publishing rights for a diverse collection of &#x27;70s Soul, Disco, and Jazz artists including The Stylistics, Van McCoy, and Glenn Medeiros.

===2021–present: Acquisition by Reservoir Media===
In June 2021, Tommy Boy was acquired for $100 million by Reservoir Media, a music publishing and media rights company founded in 2007 by Iranian-Canadian businesswoman Golnar Khosrowshahi.

==Brand image==
The Tommy Boy logo was originally designed in 1982 by Steven Miglio and redesigned in 1989 by Eric Haze. The logo was named on &quot;Complex&#x27;s&quot; list of the 50 Greatest Rap Logos of all time, coming in at number nine.

In the late 1980s, with the emergence of streetwear fashion, Tommy Boy produced and distributed Carhartt jackets embroidered with its logo on the front and back for its own merchandise line called Tommy Boy Gear. Tommy Boy is also credited as the first to use lanyards as promotional items, which became a popular streetwear fashion accessory in the 1990s.

==Controversies==
===De La Soul controversy===
Controversy rose in early 2019, after Tommy Boy announced that the catalog of its formerly signed group De La Soul would be available on streaming services later that week. This announcement prompted the group to begin a &quot;Tommy Boycott&quot; campaign, due to the fact that they would receive only 10% of revenue generated by streams, with the other 90% going to Tommy Boy. The campaign was shared by their fellow artists Nas, Questlove and Pete Rock, among others. In response, Tommy Boy postponed the deal and announced their discography would not be available on streaming services as previously scheduled.

On March 3, 2023, De La Soul&#x27;s catalogue made its debut on streaming services, after years of negotiations.

<text>A ship&#x27;s wheel or boat&#x27;s wheel is a device used aboard a ship, boat, submarine, or airship, in which a helmsman steers the vessel and control its course. Together with the rest of the steering mechanism, it forms part of the helm (the term &quot;helm&quot; can mean the wheel alone, or the entire mechanism by which the rudder is controlled). It is connected to a mechanical, electric servo, or hydraulic system which alters the horizontal angle of the vessel&#x27;s rudder relative to its hull. In some modern ships the wheel is replaced with a simple toggle that remotely controls an electro-mechanical or electro-hydraulic drive for the rudder, with a rudder position indicator presenting feedback to the helmsman.

==History==
Until the invention of the ship&#x27;s wheel, the helmsman relied on a tiller—a horizontal bar fitted directly to the top of the rudder post—or a whipstaff—a vertical stick acting on the arm of the ship&#x27;s tiller. Near the start of the 18th century, a large number of vessels appeared using the ship&#x27;s wheel design, but historians are unclear when the approach was first used.

==Design==
A ship&#x27;s wheel is composed of eight cylindrical wooden spokes (though sometimes as few as six or as many as ten or twelve depending on the wheel&#x27;s size and how much force is needed to turn it.) shaped like balusters and all joined at a central wooden hub or &quot;nave&quot; (sometimes covered with a brass &quot;nave plate&quot;) which houses the axle. The square hole at the centre of the hub through which the axle runs is called the &quot;drive square&quot; and was often lined with a brass plate (and therefore called a &quot;brass boss&quot;, though this term was used more often to refer to a brass hub and nave plate) which was frequently etched with the name of the wheel&#x27;s manufacturer. The outer rim is composed of sections each made up of stacks of three &quot;felloes&quot;, the &quot;facing felloe&quot;, the &quot;middle felloe&quot;, and the &quot;after felloe&quot;. Because each group of three felloes at one time made up a quarter of the distance around the rim, the entire outer wooden wheel was sometimes called the &quot;quadrant&quot;. Each spoke runs through the middle felloe, creating a series of handles beyond the wheel&#x27;s rim. One of these handles/spokes was frequently provided with extra grooves at its tip which could be felt by a helmsman steering in the dark and used by him to determine the exact position of the rudder—this is the &quot;king spoke&quot;, and when it pointed straight upward the rudder was believed to be dead straight to the hull. The completed ship&#x27;s wheel and associated axle and pedestals might even be taller than the person using it. The wood used in construction of this type of wheel was most often either teak or mahogany, both of which are very durable tropical hardwoods capable of surviving the effects of salt water spray and regular use without significant decomposition. Modern design—particularly on smaller vessels—can deviate from the template.

==Mechanism==
The steering gear of earlier ships&#x27; wheels sometimes consisted of a double wheel where each wheel was connected to the other with a wooden &quot;spindle&quot; that ran through a &quot;barrel&quot; or &quot;drum&quot;. The spindle was held up by two &quot;pedestals&quot; that rested on a wooden &quot;platform&quot;, often no more than a grate. A &quot;tiller rope&quot; or &quot;tiller chain&quot; (sometimes called a &quot;steering rope&quot; or &quot;steering chain&quot;) ran around the barrel in five or six loops and then down through two &quot;tiller rope/ chain slots&quot; at the top of the platform before connecting to two sheaves just below deck (one on either side of the ship&#x27;s wheel) and thence out to a pair of pulleys before coming back together at the tiller and connecting to the ship&#x27;s rudder. Movement of the wheels (which were connected and moved in unison) caused the tiller rope to wind in one of two directions and angled the tiller left or right. In a typical and intuitive arrangement, a forward-facing helmsman turning the wheel &quot;counter&quot;clockwise would cause the tiller to angle to starboard and therefore the rudder to swing to port causing the vessel to also turn to port (see animation). Having two wheels connected by an axle allowed two people to take the helm in severe weather when one person alone might not have had enough strength to control the ship&#x27;s movements. 

When at the full extent of travel, the wheel and rudder are said to be &quot;hard over&quot;, hence the order &quot;hard port/starboard&quot; given by Captain/Officer of the Watch.

<text>The Muscovy Company (also called the Russia Company or the Muscovy Trading Company; ) was an English trading company chartered in 1555. It was the first major chartered joint-stock company, the precursor of the type of business that would soon flourish in England and finance its exploration of the world. The Muscovy Company had a monopoly on trade between England and Russia until 1698 and it survived as a trading company until the Russian Revolution. Since 1917, the company has operated as a charity, now working within Russia.

==History==

===Company of Merchant Adventurers to New Lands===
The Muscovy Company traces its roots to the &quot;Company of Merchant Adventurers to New Lands&quot; (in full: &quot;Mystery and Company of Merchant Adventurers for the Discovery of Regions, Dominions, Islands, and Places unknown&quot;) founded in 1551 by Richard Chancellor, Sebastian Cabot and Sir Hugh Willoughby, who decided to look for the Northeast Passage to China.

The first expedition of the Company of Merchant Adventurers was led by Willoughby, who was chosen for his military leadership skills after esteemed service against the Scots defending English castles in the north of the country. He had no prior nautical or navigational experience and it was hoped he would transition into naval life with the same aplomb he showed on land. Chancellor would function as the navigator of the small fleet, which consisted of three ships: the &quot;Bona Esperanza&quot; under Willoughby, the &quot;Edward Bonaventure&quot; under Chancellor and the &quot;Bona Confidentia&quot;. The fleet departed from London on 10 May 1553, but near the Lofoten islands a storm hit the ships and separated Chancellor&#x27;s vessel from the other two.

Willoughby eventually crossed the Barents Sea and reached Novaya Zemlya. He spent some time sailing along the coast, then turned south towards Scandinavia. However at the mouth of the Varzina River on the coast to the east of present-day Murmansk the ship became trapped in ice. Willoughby and his crew were found a few years later by Russian fishermen who stumbled across the ship frozen in ice. Forcing entry into the ship, they found the bodies of Willoughby and his men frozen solid. It has been assumed that the men froze after a cold Russian winter aboard the ship, however, Willoughby and his men were well supplied for a winter aboard a ship – they had supplies of food enough for a journey meant for Asia and they had many woollen garments meant for trading in any destination they might have ended up in. It has therefore been posited by historians that Willoughby and his crew died not from exposure to the elements, but from carbon monoxide poisoning. The surrounding bay would have had ample supplies of sea coal and it was likely that men would have been sent out to gather material to keep them warm, and any combustion of sea coal in an enclosed area could easily have led to their deaths in a small ship hold. At any rate, Willoughby sent out scouts in various directions with the instruction to return after three days travelling if they had not found any human contact. All of these journeys failed.

Chancellor was luckier. He penetrated the White Sea, where the local fishermen were amazed by the great size of his Western-built ship. He reached the harbour of Nikolo-Korelsky Monastery on the Northern Dvina river (near the present-day Arkhangelsk, which would be eventually founded in 1584 to service the growing trade). The region had just recently been added to Muscovy, and when Tsar Ivan IV heard of Chancellor&#x27;s arrival, he immediately invited the exotic guest to visit Moscow for an audience at the royal court.

Chancellor made the journey of over to Moscow through snow- and ice-covered country. He found Moscow large (much larger than London) and primitively built, almost all being made out of wood only. However, the palace of the Tsar was very luxurious, as were the dinners he offered Chancellor. The Russian Tsar was pleased to open the sea trade routes with England and other countries, as Russia did not yet have a safe connection with the Baltic Sea at the time and almost all of the area was contested by the neighbouring powers of Lithuania, Poland, and the Sweden. In addition, the Hanseatic League had a monopoly on the trade between Russia and Central and Western Europe. Chancellor was no less optimistic, finding a good market for his English wool, and receiving furs and other Russian continental goods in return. When he returned to England in 1554, he had letters from the Tsar with him, inviting English traders and promising trade privileges.

===Chartering of the Muscovy Company===
The Company of Merchant Adventurers to New Lands was rechartered as the Muscovy Company by Mary I of England in 1555, and in the same year Chancellor left for Russia again. The Muscovy Company became an important diplomatic link between Muscovy and England, and was especially valued by the isolated Muscovy. Upon his arrival to the court of Ivan IV, Chancellor secured a number of privileges within Russia for the company, including free passage, control of English settlement, and freedom from arrest.

When Chancellor set sail for England one year later in 1556, he was joined by the first Russian ambassador to England, Osip Nepeya. However at this juncture Chancellor&#x27;s luck finally ran out. Off the Scottish coast, his ship was caught in a sudden storm and shipwrecked. Chancellor drowned, but Nepeya managed to reach the coast, where he was taken hostage by the Scots for a few months before they allowed him to travel on to London.

===Trade through Russia===
Anthony Jenkinson succeeded Chancellor as the main trader of the Muscovy Company. Jenkinson made two important voyages himself — one trying to reach Cathay overland from Moscow, eventually stopping at Bukhara; the other, between 1562 and 1579 to establish overland trade routes through Russia to Persia. Although Jenkinson verified that the overland route to Persia was a viable one, it was abandoned in 1573 due to difficulties in the region; the route did not reopen until Parliament reinstated the company&#x27;s right to the route in 1741. In 1567, when Muscovy was faring badly in the Livonian War (1558–1583), Tsar Ivan IV asked Jenkinson to sound out Queen Elizabeth I of England as a marriage prospect, providing a possible refuge for him if he was forced to flee the country. The negotiations yielded no results, and Ivan IV was soon forced to sign a ceasefire (1570) with the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

In 1571, the company&#x27;s right to free trade and navigation down the Volga was revoked by Ivan IV, who had been offended by English demands to close Russian trade to other European nations. Jenkinson returned to Moscow in 1572 in an attempt to restore the company&#x27;s privileges, a task at which he was largely successful. However, a cooling of Anglo-Russian relations was evident. This unease between the Muscovy Company and Russia continued to the end of the sixteenth century, under the anti-English dominated courts of Fyodor Ivanovich and Boris Godunov.

At the end of the 16th century, Richard Hakluyt wrote: &quot;... the notable and strange journey of Master Jenkinson to Boghar in Bactria. Whereunto thou maist adde sixe of our voyages eleven hundred verstes up against the streame of Dwina to the towne of Vologhda thence one hundred and fourescore verstes by land to Yeraslaue standing upon the mighty river of Volga: there hence above two thousand and five hundred versts downe the streame to the ancient marte Towne of Astracan, and so to the manifolde mouthes of Volga, and from thence also by ship over the Caspian sea into Media, and further then that also with Camels unto Georgia, Armenia, Hyrcania, Gillan, and the cheefest Cities of the Empire of Persia: wherein the Companie of Moscovie Marchants to the perpetual honor of their Citie, and societie, have performed more than any one, yea than all the nations of Europe besides.&quot;

===Expansion===
Queen Elizabeth I granted the Muscovy Company a monopoly charter on whaling in 1577. The primary and most profitable whaling grounds of this joint-stock company came to be centered around Spitsbergen in the early 17th century, and the company&#x27;s royal charter of 1613 granted a monopoly on whaling in Spitsbergen, based on the (erroneous) claim that Hugh Willoughby had discovered the land in 1553. Initially the English tried to drive away competitors, but after a few years, they claimed rights only to the waters south of these Arctic islands.

Shortly after Chancellor&#x27;s death in 1556, the Muscovy Company sent another voyage to discover the Northeast Passage, this time led by Steven Borough. He managed to sail through the Kara Gates, the strait between the islands of Vaygach and Novaya Zemlya in the Arctic Ocean. In 1607 and 1608, the company sent Henry Hudson in two separate voyages in an attempt to find the Northeast Passage. Both voyages were unsuccessful.

===Decline===
In 1646, Tsar Alexei I rescinded the exemption of the Muscovy Company from Russian customs, in response to the company&#x27;s alleged support of the Parliamentarians in the English Civil War. After the execution of Charles I of England in 1648, Alexei I expelled English merchants from Russia altogether, except from Arkhangelsk. While the restoration of Charles II of England in 1660 resulted in a temporary thaw of relations between England and Russia, a 1664 embassy under Andrew Marvell proved unsuccessful in restoring the Muscovy Company&#x27;s prior benefits. In the meantime, Dutch merchants replaced the English as the dominant traders in Russia. Nevertheless, the company held a monopoly on English-Russian trade until 1698, when it lost its privileges due to political opposition.

===18th century on===
The Company helped provide churches and Anglican ministers at various times in Arkhangelsk, Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Kronstadt, such as St. Andrew&#x27;s Anglican Church, Moscow. The Company continued in existence until the Russian Revolution of 1917 and has since operated mainly as a charity.
St. Andrew&#x27;s and the company headquarters (called the &quot;Old English Yard&quot;), were built during the reign of Ivan IV, and are not far from the Moscow Kremlin. In 1994 they were visited by Queen Elizabeth II.

<text>The Mexican Air Force (FAM; ) is the air service branch of the Mexican Armed Forces. It is a component of the Mexican Army and as such overseen by the National Defense Secretariat (SEDENA). The objective of the FAM is to defend the integrity, independence, and sovereignty of Mexico. Its auxiliary tasks include internal security, assisting with public works, and natural disaster management. As of 2024, its commander is Óscar René Rubio Sánchez.

== History ==
=== Mexican Revolution ===

The foundation of the Mexican airforce was led by five Mexican flight pioneers who were sent to New York by President Francisco Madero to master flying: Juan Pablo and Eduardo Aldasoro, Alberto and Gustavo Salinas and Horacio Ruiz. They returned to Mexico in 1913 not only as pioneers, but also teachers for the next generation of pilots.

The official predecessor of the Air Force was the Army&#x27;s Auxiliary Aerial Militia Squadron (), created during the Mexican Revolution in April 1913 by the Secretary of War and Navy General Manuel Mondragón, who authorized pilots Miguel Lebrija and to test out bomb targets on Campo de Balbuena, the first airport in Mexico, now located in Jardín Balbuena in Mexico City.

The air force exclusively performed reconnaissance missions until 10 May 1913, when Didier Masson and a Joaquín Bauche Alcalde dropped 15 kilograms of dynamite on rebel boats. Although the attack did not cause any damage below, it is the first known instance of air-to-sea bombing. Masson also performed leaflet drops, also considered the first ever done.

On February 5, 1915, the leader of the Constitutionalist Army, Venustiano Carranza, founded the Military Aviation Arm (), which would become the current air force. Its first commander was Lt. Alberto Salinas Carranza.

=== Other rebellions ===

When WWI Ace U.S. Colonel Ralph O&#x27;Neill was hired to head the restructuring of the Mexican Air Force in 1920, he reported to General Plutarco Elías Calles that most of the aircraft available had to be replaced. Until August 1920, the entire fleet consisted of 13 national made prototypes of mixed engine design. These were functional yet ill-equipped for battle, 4 being scout monoplanes. 5 others were in repair and over 20 more at the TNCA were obsolete or wrecked beyond repair. The branch initially consisted of 27 pilots, 17 of which were cadets. In anticipation of the new &quot;Chief&quot;, a purchase was made of 13 French Farman F.50 night bombers. Commander O&#x27;Neill soon acquired 35 British made Avro 504K and Avro 504J airplanes, which later would be made in Mexico under the name . O&#x27;Neill was the first to introduce the term &quot;Fuerza Aérea Mexicana&quot; (FAM) naming the organization as such. The next step was the formation of classified fighter, bombing, observation and reconnaissance squadrons, as well as the decentralization of Air Force units throughout the country at strategic bases. O&#x27;Neill then set to work with his co-instructors German Fritz Bieler and Frenchman Joe Ben Lievre, using the first intercom known as the &quot;Gosport System&quot;, invented by Robert Smith-Barry, in order to give in-air commands. O&#x27;Neill not only implemented new combat strategy, but also flew many decisive missions.

From 1923 to 1929, Mexico was immersed in a wave of violent territorial, religious and military armed rebellions, which required the new Air Force to quickly deploy support wherever the federal army requested them. These conflicts were resolved mostly by the assertive use of air superiority alone.

On December 7, 1923, former President Adolfo de la Huerta launched a military coup (delahuertista rebellion) against the government of President Álvaro Obregón. The situation was extremely critical, because along with de la Huerta, about 60% of the army revolted, including various high-ranking generals across the country. The power tilted back in favor of the federal forces when the United States agreed to furnish the Mexican government with a fleet of new de Havilland DH-4B aircraft equipped with the Liberty motor, armed with Lewis and Vickers machine guns and able to carry bombs. The military coup was suffocated by February 1924.

In 1925, due to the shortage of airplanes caused by World War I, Mexico set up the National Aviation Workshops (TNCA) to design and build its own airplanes and aeroengines.
A territorial war was that of the Sonora Yaqui Indians who demanded by force that previous territorial treaties were implemented. The conflict lasted from 1926 to 1927, and it came to an end when a new treaty was implemented.

When President Plutarco Elías Calles pushed for the creation of the &#x27;Mexican Apostolic Catholic Church&#x27;, independent of Rome, it unleashed a widespread religious war known as the Cristero War. This long civil war lasted from 1926 to 1929.

In May 1927, while General Obregón seemed keen to impose the presidency to General Calles, General Arnulfo R. Gómez launched a military coup against both Obregón and Calles. His command posts were located in the cities of Puebla and Veracruz, where he led approximately 200 federal deserters, ammunition and weapons. The air force played a key role in their defeat.

Then, on March 3, 1929, a serious military coup took place, led by General José Gonzalo Escobar and heeded by various other generals. In these days, the air force&#x27;s remaining airplanes consisted of worn and shot Bristol F.2 Fighter, Bristol Boarhound, de Havilland DH-4B and Douglas O-2C, a force that was not suitable to defeat Escobar&#x27;s power. In this context, the Mexican government convinced the U.S. government to promote the peace south of its border and quickly make available twelve new OU-2M Corsair with the 400 hp Wasp engine, nine Douglas O-2M, four &quot;Stearman C3B&quot; and six Waco Taper Wings. Only two weeks after making the request, the U.S. government agreed, and several Mexican pilots travelled to Brownsville, Texas, and New York to pick up the new aircraft. The key victory was decided in late March 1929 at the Battle of Jiménez, Chihuahua, where after several days of air raids, Escobar was defeated by General Calles, taking about 6000 prisoners. This rebellion was quite serious, since a third of the officials and nearly 30,000 soldiers rebelled; in two months, more than 2000 men had been killed.

In May 1938, the Governor of San Luis Potosí, General Saturnino Cedillo, declared himself in rebellion and President Lázaro Cárdenas travelled there to personally mount the campaign against the revolt. The Air Force organized a mixed fleet of 17 aircraft that included some new V-99M Corsair, engaging the enemy assertively when spotted. Cedillo quickly realized he had no chance in open fields against the air force and ran to the Huasteca Hills, where his men dispersed, abandoning him.

With the imminent collapse of the Spanish Republic in 1939, the Mexican government took delivery of military aircraft destined for the Republic, strengthening its arsenal.

=== World War II ===

The Escuadrón 201, a P-47D fighter squadron of the Fuerza Aérea Expedicionaria Mexicana (Mexican Expeditionary Air Force), served in the Pacific War against the Empire of Japan during World War II. It consisted of 25 aircraft and had 300 airmen and supporting staff. The 201st Squadron, completed 96 combat missions over the Philippines (Battle of Luzon) and Formosa (Taiwan). It is the only unit of the Mexican armed forces ever to see overseas combat.

=== Cold War era ===
The first jet aircraft operated by the Mexican Air Force was the subsonic de Havilland Vampire Mk.I. Mexico received 17 Vampires during late 1960 and early 1961. This jet was nicknamed &quot;The Flying Avocado&quot; by Mexican flight crews due to the ovoid shape of its fuselage and the dark green night camouflage adopted by its first units. The Vampires were not popular with Mexican fighter pilots because of its lack of ejection seats. The FAM finally retired them in 1970.

The Mexican Vampires were initially complemented by 15 Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star subsonic fighter aircraft received also in late 1961. Because of its more modern design, an ejection seat system and several other attributes, the T-33 was well liked by most FAM pilots and became a huge success as a patrol and interceptor aircraft. During the seventies and early eighties an additional 20 or more T-33s were procured by the FAM to replace aircraft lost in accidents and to increase the size of the fleet after the retirement of the Vampires.

In 1982, the FAM received 12 Northrop F-5E/F Tiger II jets (10 F-5Es and 2 F-5Fs). The F-5 gave Mexico its first supersonic platform and saw the formation of Air Squadron 401. Since the 1980s the F-5 became the main Mexican fighter jet while the remaining operational T-33s were used for subsonic support and light attack roles.

In 1983 one F-5E was lost in an accident that occurred during a target practice exercise in the state of Chihuahua.

=== Chiapas conflict ===

On January 1, 1994, the day the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) came into effect, hundreds of guerrillas from the previously unknown Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) occupied several towns and cities in the southern state of Chiapas.

The FAM was mobilized to support Army units, sending almost every available helicopter to the territory of operations. Units involved included the recently formed 214th and 215th Special Operations Squadrons, equipped with a mix of Bell 212 assault- and MD.530F scout helicopters. Up to 40 helicopters were deployed to support an initial deployment of 10,000 ground troops.

Bell 212s were armed in two configurations: for fire support with twin MAG 7.62-mm gun pods and cabin-mounted GPMGs; or as gunship, with LAU-32 70-mm rocket launchers, a twin MAG gun-pod and cabin mounted MAG GPMGs.

Pumas, Bell 205s, 206s and 212s from the 209th were also deployed, however, FAM&#x27;s helicopter assets were scarce and the Mexican Army had to rely on almost every other government agency&#x27;s helicopters for general support tasks. Almost any flyable aircraft from the National Attorney&#x27;s Office (PGR) was also deployed, including Bell 206s and 212s, as well as the Navy&#x27;s recently acquired Mi-8MTV-1s. Eventually the Army deployed some 70,000 ground troops and air support proved to be insufficient; hence the decision was taken to considerably expand the FAM&#x27;s helicopter fleet.

By December 1994, FAM had bought additional 12 armed MD.530MG &#x27;Defender&#x27; and four UH-60L Blackhawk helicopters, which it grouped into the 216th Special Operations Squadron. This unit was the spearhead of operation &quot;Arco Iris&quot; (Rainbow) to re-take several towns that had fallen under rebel control in January 1994. The new militarized Defenders came armed with M2AC machine-guns and LAU-68A 70-mm rocket launchers. Three additional units were ordered in 1996 and delivered as attrition replacements in March 1998. Black
Hawks wore 1191 to 1194 serials and are being used for special operations.

Although the FAM received 18 surplus Bell 206s from the Attorney General&#x27;s office (PGR) in the mid-1990s, the main need identified by the FAM High Command was for a new fleet of transport helicopters that would allow it to support the Army with an adequate airlift capability.

=== Recent times ===
After more than 30 yearly military parade flights without incidents, an F-5E collided in mid-air with three Lockheed T-33s on the Air-military parade accident on September 16, 1995. All aircraft were lost and a total of 10 deaths occurred. Since then, for safety reasons, military parade flyovers in Mexico have been smaller in participation.

In 2004, the Mexican Air Force recorded a UFO sighting over southern Campeche.

In 2007, after more than 45 years in service, the last operational T-33s were retired. In 2012, the supersonic F-5 fighter jets had their 30th anniversary in Mexican Air Force service. Due to high operating costs, lack of parts, and the extreme age of the aircraft, the Mexican Air Force retired all but three F-5s in late 2017. In early 2019, the Mexican Air Force received repaired engines for their F-5 fighters, as part of an effort to return a handful of the aircraft to operational status. In early 2023, restoration work on F-5 airframes has begun with the intention to have a total of at least nine F-5s in active service.

Because of the ongoing Mexican Drug War, increasing importance has been placed on acquiring airborne surveillance platforms, UAVs, light attack aircraft, helicopters and rapid troop transports.

On 21 February 2021, a Learjet 45XR operated by the Mexican Air Force crashed while taking off from El Lencero Airport in Veracruz, killing all six people on board.

== Territorial organization ==

=== Air Force Regions ===
Air Force Regions () are the airspaces over one or more contiguous Zones or federal entities. In each Air Region, the Air Force provides security and defense, and address internal security matters in coordination with other Armed Forces or any federal institution. Each Air Region is composed of Headquarters, Air Force Bases, Air Force Stations, and other organizations. The Air Force divides the country&#x27;s territory into four regions: Northwestern (Mexicali, Baja California), Northeastern (Chihuahua, Chihuahua), Central (Mexico City) and Southeastern (Tuxtla Gutiérrez, Chiapas); each region is commanded by a general. The regional headquarters are in charge of 18 air bases across the country:
=== Air Force Bases ===
Air Force Bases, also called Military Air Bases () (BAM), are operational and administrative entities subordinate to the Air Regions, responsible for the technical and administrative aspects, as well as the coordination of aerial operations within the Air Regions. They comprise flight units and service organizations, overseeing the airspace assigned by the Air Force Command. The primary purpose of Air Bases is to conduct and support military aerial operations, ensuring the security and defense of the designated airspace, and contributing to internal security in accordance with directives from the Zone, Air Region, Air Force Command, and Ministry of Defense. The Mexican Air Force comprises 18 Air Force Bases, each associated with a specific Air Region in the country. Components of Air Bases include Headquarters, Flight Units, Technical Services of the Air Force, and Technical and Administrative Services.

=== Air Force Stations ===
Air Force Stations, also called Military Air Stations () (EAM), are command and control units subordinate to Air Regions, designed to support military air operations. Typically situated within civilian airport facilities, these stations serve to direct, coordinate, and provide logistical support for military air operations occurring within, from, or to their installation. These stations are exclusively integrated with service organizations, catering to the requirements of military air operations and addressing their own living and operational necessities. They may have assigned crews and aircraft in support or transit, over which they exert technical, administrative, and disciplinary control for the duration of their stay.

* Air Force Station No. 1, Guadalajara International Airport
* Air Force Station No. 2, Guerrero Negro Airport
* Air Force Station No. 3, Torreón International Airport

=== Ranks ===
Air Force ranks are the same as in Mexico&#x27;s Army, with the exception of generals. A national commander under the orders of the Secretary of National Defense is in charge of the Mexican Air Force. The second-in-command is the Air Force Chief of Staff, who supervises a Deputy Chief of Operations and a Deputy Chief of Management.

=== Pilot selection and training ===
The FAM offers higher education, middle education, technical training, tactical training and specialized technical training in its various campuses:

==== Air Force Academy ====

Since the National School of Aviation was opened in 1915, it took different names over the years until finally, in 1959 it joined the military school of meteorology, mechanics and aviation specialists, forming the leading campus in military aviation education: &#x27;El Colegio del Aire&#x27; (Air Force Academy), which since September 9, 1959, has guided the formation of Air Force officers. The Air Force Academy is an all academic institution of the Mexican Air Force and comprises four schools: &#x27;Military Aviation School&#x27;, &#x27;Maintenance and Supply Military School&#x27;, &#x27;Air Force Military Specialist School&#x27;, and the &#x27;Military Troops&#x27; Air Force Specialist School&#x27;.

==== Military Aviation School (&quot;EMA&quot;) ====
Admission to the Air Force is through the mechanism of military recruitment that takes place every year at The Ministry of Defense. The FAM currently offers tertiary level studies – highlighting that of Military Pilot, which spans 4 years at the facilities of the Air Force Academy located on the Military Air Base No. 5 in Zapopan, Jalisco.

The subjects taught in pilot training include: tactics of the branches of aviation, general aviation tactics, meteorology, air navigation, air traffic control, radio communications and culture in general, along with approximately 250 hours of flight. During the first year, the training is theoretical. During the second year, Beechcraft Bonanza aircraft are used for flight instruction. During the third the cadets are trained Aermacchi SF260EU for aerobatics, and later on Pilatus PC-7 for advanced flight tactics, including combat. Within each of these stages, the cadets are trained in aerial acrobatics, stage tactical instrument flight, visual flying rules (VFR), radio operations, among others, which increase in complexity as the cadets&#x27; training progresses. The first female aviator to graduate as a pilot in the history of FAM, Andrea Cruz, became a cadet at the Military Aviation School in 2007.

==== Military Air Force Specialist School (&quot;EMEFA&quot;) ====
Military School of Air Force Specialist offers a comprehensive scholarship lasting three years for officer training meteorologists and flight control, obtaining at the graduate level of lieutenant. His duties are to provide meteorological information and control of military or civil aircraft.

==== School of the Air Force Specialists (&quot;EMEFA&quot;) ====
Military School of the Air Forces specialists is an
establishment of military education that has as its mission to train sergeants in seconds
aviation maintenance, supply lines, electronic
aviation and military aviation. The school is located in the St. Lucía military base.

==== Military School of Maintenance and Supply (&quot;EMMA&quot;) ====
In this school, officers are trained as aviation maintenance specialists, aviation electronics specialists, weapons and air supply lines.

<doc id="1326926" wikidata="Q4795883" url="?curid=1326926" title="Array processing">
<text>Array processing is a wide area of research in the field of signal processing that extends from the simplest form of 1 dimensional line arrays to 2 and 3 dimensional array geometries. Array structure can be defined as a set of sensors that are spatially separated, e.g. radio antenna and seismic arrays. The sensors used for a specific problem may vary widely, for example microphones, accelerometers and telescopes. However, many similarities exist, the most fundamental of which may be an assumption of wave propagation. Wave propagation means there is a systemic relationship between the signal received on spatially separated sensors. By creating a physical model of the wave propagation, or in machine learning applications a training data set, the relationships between the signals received on spatially separated sensors can be leveraged for many applications.

Some common problem that are solved with array processing techniques are:
* determine number and locations of energy-radiating sources 
* enhance the signal to noise ratio (SNR) or &quot;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)&quot;
* track moving sources

Array processing metrics are often assessed in noisy environments. The model for noise may be either one of spatially incoherent noise, or one with interfering signals following the same propagation physics. Estimation theory is an important and basic part of signal processing field, which used to deal with estimation problem in which the values of several parameters of the system should be estimated based on measured/empirical data that has a random component. As the number of applications increases, estimating temporal and spatial parameters become more important. Array processing emerged in the last few decades as an active area and was centered on the ability of using and combining data from different sensors (antennas) in order to deal with specific estimation task (spatial and temporal processing). In addition to the information that can be extracted from the collected data the framework uses the advantage prior knowledge about the geometry of the sensor array to perform the estimation task. 
Array processing is used in radar, sonar, seismic exploration, anti-jamming and wireless communications. One of the main advantages of using array processing along with an array of sensors is a smaller foot-print. The problems associated with array processing include the number of sources used, their direction of arrivals, and their signal waveforms. 

There are four assumptions in array processing. The first assumption is that there is uniform propagation in all directions of isotropic and non-dispersive medium. The second assumption is that for far field array processing, the radius of propagation is much greater than size of the array and that there is plane wave propagation. The third assumption is that there is a zero mean white noise and signal, which shows uncorrelation. Finally, the last assumption is that there is no coupling and the calibration is perfect.

==Applications==
The ultimate goal of sensor array signal processing is to estimate the values of parameters by using available temporal and spatial information, collected through sampling a wavefield with a set of antennas that have a precise geometry description. The processing of the captured data and information is done under the assumption that the wavefield is generated by a finite number of signal sources (emitters), and contains information about signal parameters characterizing and describing the sources. There are many applications related to the above problem formulation, where the number of sources, their directions and locations should be specified. To motivate the reader, some of the most important applications related to array processing will be discussed.

* Radar and Sonar Systems:
array processing concept was closely linked to radar and sonar systems which represent the classical applications of array processing. The antenna array is used in these systems to determine location(s) of source(s), cancel interference, suppress ground clutter. Radar systems used basically to detect objects by using radio waves. The range, altitude, speed and direction of objects can be specified. Radar systems started as military equipments then entered the civilian world. In radar applications, different modes can be used, one of these modes is the active mode. In this mode the antenna array based system radiates pulses and listens for the returns. By using the returns, the estimation of parameters such as velocity, range and DOAs (direction of arrival) of target of interest become possible. Using the passive far-field listening arrays, only the DOAs can be estimated. Sonar systems (Sound Navigation and Ranging) use the sound waves that propagate under the water to detect objects on or under the water surface. Two types of sonar systems can be defined the active one and the passive one. In active sonar, the system emits pulses of sound and listens to the returns that will be used to estimate parameters. In the passive sonar, the system is essentially listening for the sounds made by the target objects. There is a difference between the radar system that uses radio waves and the sonar system that uses sound waves, the reason why the sonar uses the sound wave is because sound waves travel farther in the water than do radar and light waves. In passive sonar, the receiving array has the capability of detecting distant objects and their locations. Deformable array are usually used in sonar systems where the antenna is typically drawn under the water. In active sonar, the sonar system emits sound waves (acoustic energy) then listening and monitoring any existing echo (the reflected waves). The reflected sound waves can be used to estimate parameters, such as velocity, position and direction etc. Difficulties and limitations in sonar systems comparing to radar systems emerged from the fact that the propagation speed of sound waves under the water is slower than the radio waves. Another source of limitation is the high propagation losses and scattering. Despite all these limitations and difficulties, sonar system remains a reliable technique for range, distance, position and other parameters estimation for underwater applications. 

NORSAR is an independent geo-scientific research facility that was founded in Norway in 1968. NORSAR has been working with array processing ever since to measure seismic activity around the globe. They are currently working on an International Monitoring System which will comprise 50 primary and 120 auxiliary seismic stations around the world. NORSAR has ongoing work to improve array processing to improve monitoring of seismic activity not only in Norway but around the globe.

* Communications (wireless)
Communication can be defined as the process of exchanging of information between two or more parties. The last two decades witnessed a rapid growth of wireless communication systems. This success is a result of advances in communication theory and low power dissipation design process. In general, communication (telecommunication) can be done by technological means through either electrical signals (wired communication) or electromagnetic waves (wireless communication). Antenna arrays have emerged as a support technology to increase the usage efficiency of spectral and enhance the accuracy of wireless communication systems by utilizing spatial dimension in addition to the classical time and frequency dimensions. Array processing and estimation techniques have been used in wireless communication. During the last decade these techniques were re-explored as ideal candidates to be the solution for numerous problems in wireless communication. In wireless communication, problems that affect quality and performance of the system may come from different sources. The multiuser –medium multiple access- and multipath -signal propagation over multiple scattering paths in wireless channels- communication model is one of the most widespread communication models in wireless communication (mobile communication). 

In the case of multiuser communication environment, the existence of multiuser increases the inter-user interference possibility that can affect quality and performance of the system adversely. In mobile communication systems the multipath problem is one of the basic problems that base stations have to deal with. Base stations have been using spatial diversity for combating fading due to the severe multipath. Base stations use an antenna array of several elements to achieve higher selectivity, so called beamforming. Receiving array can be directed in the direction of one user at a time, while avoiding the interference from other users.

* Medical applications
Array processing techniques got on much attention from medical and industrial applications. In medical applications, the medical image processing field was one of the basic fields that use array processing. Other medical applications that use array processing: diseases treatment, tracking waveforms that have information about the condition of internal organs e.g. the heart, localizing and analyzing brain activity by using bio-magnetic sensor arrays.

* Array Processing for Speech Enhancement
Speech enhancement and processing represents another field that has been affected by the new era of array processing. Most of the acoustic front end systems became fully automatic systems (e.g. telephones). However, the operational environment of these systems contains a mix of other acoustic sources; external noises as well as acoustic couplings of loudspeaker signals overwhelm and attenuate the desired speech signal. In addition to these external sources, the strength of the desired signal is reduced due to the relatively distance between speaker and microphones. Array processing techniques have opened new opportunities in speech processing to attenuate noise and echo without degrading the quality of and affecting adversely the speech signal. In general array processing techniques can be used in speech processing to reduce the computing power (number of computations) and enhance the quality of the system (the performance). Representing the signal as a sum of sub-bands and adapting cancellation filters for the sub-band signals can reduce the demanded computation power and lead to a higher performance system. Relying on multiple input channels allows designing systems of higher quality comparing to systems that use single channel and solving problems such as source localization, tracking and separation, which cannot be achieved in case of using single channel.

* Array Processing in Astronomy Applications
Astronomical environment contains a mix of external signals and noises that affect the quality of the desired signals. Most of the arrays processing applications in astronomy are related to image processing. The array used to achieve a higher quality that is not achievable by using a single channel. The high image quality facilitates quantitative analysis and comparison with images at other wavelengths. In general, astronomy arrays can be divided into two classes: the beamforming class and the correlation class. Beamforming is a signal processing techniques that produce summed array beams from a direction of interest – used basically in directional signal transmission or reception- the basic idea is to combine elements in a phased array such that some signals experience destructive inference and other experience constructive inference. Correlation arrays provide images over the entire single-element primary beam pattern, computed off-line from records of all the possible correlations between the antennas, pairwise. 

* Other applications
In addition to these applications, many applications have been developed based on array processing techniques: Acoustic Beamforming for Hearing Aid Applications, Under-determined Blind Source Separation Using Acoustic Arrays, Digital 3D/4D Ultrasound Imaging Array, Smart Antennas, Synthetic aperture radar, underwater acoustic imaging, and Chemical sensor arrays...etc.

== General model and problem formulation==
Consider a system that consists of array of r arbitrary sensors that have arbitrary locations and arbitrary directions (directional characteristics) which receive signals that generated by q narrow band sources of known center frequency ω and locations θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4 ... θq. since the signals are narrow band the propagation delay across the array is much smaller than the reciprocal of the signal bandwidth and it follows that by using a complex envelop representation the array output can be expressed (by the sense of superposition) as :&lt;br&gt;
formula_1

Where:
* formula_2 is the vector of the signals received by the array sensors,
* formula_3 is the signal emitted by the kth source as received at the frequency sensor 1 of the array,
* formula_4 is the steering vector of the array toward direction (formula_5),
* τi(θk): is the propagation delay between the first and the ith sensor for a waveform coming from direction (θk), 
* formula_6 is the noise vector.

The same equation can be also expressed in the form of vectors:&lt;br&gt;
formula_7

If we assume now that M snapshots are taken at time instants t1, t2 ... tM, the data can be expressed as:&lt;br&gt;
formula_8

Where X and N are the r × M matrices and S is q × M:&lt;br&gt;
formula_9&lt;br&gt;
formula_10&lt;br&gt;
formula_11

Problem definition&lt;br&gt;
“The target is to estimate the DOA’s θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4 …θq of the sources from the M snapshot of the array x(t1)… x(tM). In other words what we are interested in is estimating the DOA’s of emitter signals impinging on receiving array, when given a finite data set {x(t)} observed over t=1, 2 … M. This will be done basically by using the second-order statistics of data”

In order to solve this problem (to guarantee that there is a valid solution) do we have to add conditions or assumptions on the operational environment and\or the used model? Since there are many parameters used to specify the system like the number of sources, the number of array elements ...etc. are there conditions that should be met first? Toward this goal we want to make the following assumptions:
# The number of signals is known and is smaller than the number of sensors, .
# The set of any q steering vectors is linearly independent.
# Isotropic and non-dispersive medium – Uniform propagation in all directions.
# Zero mean white noise and signal, uncorrelated.
# Far-Field.
::a. Radius of propagation » size of array.
::b. Plane wave propagation.

Throughout this survey, it will be assumed that the number of underlying signals, q, in the observed process is considered known. There are, however, good and consistent techniques for estimating this value even if it is not known.

== Estimation techniques==
In general, parameters estimation techniques can be classified into: spectral based and parametric based methods. In the former, one forms some spectrum-like function of the parameter(s) of interest. The locations of the highest (separated) peaks of the function in question are recorded as the DOA estimates. Parametric techniques, on the other hand, require a simultaneous search for all parameters of interest. The basic advantage of using the parametric approach comparing to the spectral based approach is the accuracy, albeit at the expense of an increased computational complexity.

=== Spectral–based solutions ===
Spectral based algorithmic solutions can be further classified into beamforming techniques and subspace-based techniques.

==== Beamforming technique ====
The first method used to specify and automatically localize the signal sources using antenna arrays was the beamforming technique. The idea behind beamforming is very simple: steer the array in one direction at a time and measure the output power. The steering locations where we have the maximum power yield the DOA estimates. The array response is steered by forming a linear combination of the sensor outputs.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Where Rx is the sample covariance matrix. Different beamforming approaches correspond to different choices of the weighting vector F. The advantages of using beamforming technique are the simplicity, easy to use and understand. While the disadvantage of using this technique is the low resolution.

==== Subspace-based technique ====
Many spectral methods in the past have called upon the spectral decomposition of a covariance matrix to carry out the analysis. A breakthrough came about when the eigen-structure of the covariance matrix was explicitly invoked, and its intrinsic properties were directly used to provide a solution to an underlying estimation problem for a given observed process. A class of spatial spectral estimation techniques is based on the eigen-value decomposition of the spatial covariance matrix. The rationale behind this approach is that one wants to emphasize the choices for the steering vector a(θ) which correspond to signal directions. The method exploits the property that the directions of arrival determine the eigen structure of the matrix.&lt;br&gt;
The tremendous interest in the subspace based methods is mainly due to the introduction of the MUSIC (Multiple Signal Classification) algorithm. MUSIC was originally presented as a DOA estimator, then it has been successfully brought back to the spectral analysis/system identification problem with its later development.

MUSIC spectrum approaches use a single realization of the stochastic process that is represent by the snapshots x (t), t=1, 2 ...M. MUSIC estimates are consistent and they converge to true source bearings as the number of snapshots grows to infinity. A basic drawback of MUSIC approach is its sensitivity to model errors. A costly procedure of calibration is required in MUSIC and it is very sensitive to errors in the calibration procedure. The cost of calibration increases as the number of parameters that define the array manifold increases.

=== Parametric–based solutions ===
While the spectral-based methods presented in the previous section are computationally attractive, they do not always yield sufficient accuracy. In particular, for the cases when we have highly correlated signals, the performance of spectral-based methods may be insufficient. An alternative is to more fully exploit the underlying data model, leading to so-called parametric array processing methods. The cost of using such methods to increase the efficiency is that the algorithms typically require a multidimensional search to find the estimates. The most common used model based approach in signal processing is the maximum likelihood (ML) technique. This method requires a statistical framework for the data generation process. When applying the ML technique to the array processing problem, two main methods have been considered depending on the signal data model assumption. According to the Stochastic ML, the signals are modeled as Gaussian random processes. On the other hand, in the Deterministic ML the signals are considered as unknown, deterministic quantities that need to be estimated in conjunction with the direction of arrival.

==== Stochastic ML approach ====
The stochastic maximum likelihood method is obtained by modeling the signal waveforms as a Gaussian random process under the assumption that the process x(t) is a stationary, zero-mean, Gaussian process that is completely described by its second-order covariance matrix. This model is a reasonable one if the measurements are obtained by filtering wide-band signals using a narrow band-pass filter.&lt;br&gt;

formula_36&lt;br&gt;
formula_37

==== Deterministic ML approach ====
While the background and receiver noise in the assumed data model can be thought of as emanating from a large number of independent noise sources, the same is usually not the case for the emitter signals. It therefore appears natural to model the noise as a stationary Gaussian white random process whereas the signal waveforms are deterministic (arbitrary) and unknown. According to the Deterministic ML the signals are considered as unknown, deterministic quantities that need to be estimated in conjunction with the direction of arrival. This is a natural model for digital communication applications where the signals are far from being normal random variables, and where estimation of the signal is of equal interest.

== Correlation spectrometer ==
The problem of computing pairwise correlation as a function of frequency can be solved by two mathematically equivalent but distinct ways. By using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) it is possible to analyze signals in the time domain as well as in the spectral domain. The first approach is &quot;XF&quot; correlation because it first cross-correlates antennas (the &quot;X&quot; operation) using a time-domain &quot;lag&quot; convolution, and then computes the spectrum (the &quot;F&quot; operation) for each resulting baseline. The second approach &quot;FX&quot; takes advantage of the fact that convolution is equivalent to multiplication in Fourier domain. It first computes the spectrum for each individual antenna (the F operation), and then multiplies pairwise all antennas for each spectral channel (the X operation). A FX correlator has an advantage over a XF correlators in that the computational complexity is O(N2). Therefore, FX correlators are more efficient for larger arrays.

Correlation spectrometers like the Michelson interferometer vary the time lag between signals obtain the power spectrum of input signals. The power spectrum formula_38 of a signal is related to its autocorrelation function by a Fourier transform:

(f) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} R_{\text{XX}}(\tau) \cos(2 \pi f \tau),\mathrm{d}\tau&lt;/math&gt;|}}

where the autocorrelation function formula_39 for signal X as a function of time delay formula_40 is

(\tau) = \left( V_X(t) V_X(t + \tau)\right)&lt;/math&gt;|}}

Cross-correlation spectroscopy with spatial interferometry, is possible by simply substituting a signal with voltage formula_41 in equation to produce the cross-correlation formula_42 and the cross-spectrum formula_43.

== Example: spatial filtering ==
In radio astronomy, RF interference must be mitigated to detect and observe any meaningful objects and events in the night sky. 

=== Projecting out the interferer ===
For an array of Radio Telescopes with a spatial signature of the interfering source formula_44 that is not a known function of the direction of interference and its time variance, the signal covariance matrix takes the form:

formula_45

where formula_46 is the visibilities covariance matrix (sources), formula_47 is the power of the interferer, and formula_48 is the noise power, and formula_49 denotes the Hermitian transpose. One can construct a projection matrix formula_50, which, when left and right multiplied by the signal covariance matrix, will reduce the interference term to zero.

formula_51

So the modified signal covariance matrix becomes:

formula_52

Since formula_44 is generally not known, formula_50 can be constructed using the eigen-decomposition of formula_55, in particular the matrix containing an orthonormal basis of the noise subspace, which is the orthogonal complement of formula_44. The disadvantages to this approach include altering the visibilities covariance matrix and coloring the white noise term.

=== Spatial whitening ===
This scheme attempts to make the interference-plus-noise term spectrally white. To do this, left and right multiply formula_55 with inverse square root factors of the interference-plus-noise terms.

formula_58

The calculation requires rigorous matrix manipulations, but results in an expression of the form:

formula_59

This approach requires much more computationally intensive matrix manipulations, and again the visibilities covariance matrix is altered.

=== Subtraction of interference estimate ===
Since formula_44 is unknown, the best estimate is the dominant eigenvector formula_61 of the eigen-decomposition of formula_62, and likewise the best estimate of the interference power is formula_63, where formula_64 is the dominant eigenvalue of formula_55. One can subtract the interference term from the signal covariance matrix:

formula_66

By right and left multiplying formula_55:

formula_68

where formula_69 by selecting the appropriate formula_70. This scheme requires an accurate estimation of the interference term, but does not alter the noise or sources term.

== Summary ==
Array processing technique represents a breakthrough in signal processing. Many applications and problems which are solvable using array processing techniques are introduced. In addition to these applications within the next few years the number of applications that include a form of array signal processing will increase. It is highly expected that the importance of array processing will grow as the automation becomes more common in industrial environment and applications, further advances in digital signal processing and digital signal processing systems will also support the high computation requirements demanded by some of the estimation techniques.

In this article we emphasized the importance of array processing by listing the most important applications that include a form of array processing techniques. We briefly describe the different classifications of array processing, spectral and parametric based approaches. Some of the most important algorithms are covered, the advantage(s) and the disadvantage(s) of these algorithms also explained and discussed.

<text>Beamforming or spatial filtering is a signal processing technique used in sensor arrays for directional signal transmission or reception. This is achieved by combining elements in an antenna array in such a way that signals at particular angles experience constructive interference while others experience destructive interference. Beamforming can be used at both the transmitting and receiving ends in order to achieve spatial selectivity. The improvement compared with omnidirectional reception/transmission is known as the directivity of the array.

Beamforming can be used for radio or sound waves. It has found numerous applications in radar, sonar, seismology, wireless communications, radio astronomy, acoustics and biomedicine. Adaptive beamforming is used to detect and estimate the signal of interest at the output of a sensor array by means of optimal (e.g. least-squares) spatial filtering and interference rejection.

==Techniques==
To change the directionality of the array when transmitting, a beamformer controls the phase and relative amplitude of the signal at each transmitter, in order to create a pattern of constructive and destructive interference in the wavefront. When receiving, information from different sensors is combined in a way where the expected pattern of radiation is preferentially observed.

For example, in sonar, to send a sharp pulse of underwater sound towards a ship in the distance, simply simultaneously transmitting that sharp pulse from every sonar projector in an array fails because the ship will first hear the pulse from the speaker that happens to be nearest the ship, then later pulses from speakers that happen to be further from the ship. The beamforming technique involves sending the pulse from each projector at slightly different times (the projector closest to the ship last), so that every pulse hits the ship at exactly the same time, producing the effect of a single strong pulse from a single powerful projector. The same technique can be carried out in air using loudspeakers, or in radar/radio using antennas.

In passive sonar, and in reception in active sonar, the beamforming technique involves combining delayed signals from each hydrophone at slightly different times (the hydrophone closest to the target will be combined after the longest delay), so that every signal reaches the output at exactly the same time, making one loud signal, as if the signal came from a single, very sensitive hydrophone. Receive beamforming can also be used with microphones or radar antennas.

With narrowband systems the time delay is equivalent to a &quot;phase shift&quot;, so in this case the array of antennas, each one shifted a slightly different amount, is called a phased array. A narrow band system, typical of radars, is one where the bandwidth is only a small fraction of the center frequency. With wideband systems this approximation no longer holds, which is typical in sonars.

In the receive beamformer the signal from each antenna may be amplified by a different &quot;weight.&quot; Different weighting patterns (e.g., Dolph–Chebyshev) can be used to achieve the desired sensitivity patterns. A main lobe is produced together with nulls and sidelobes. As well as controlling the main lobe width (beamwidth) and the sidelobe levels, the position of a null can be controlled. This is useful to ignore noise or jammers in one particular direction, while listening for events in other directions. A similar result can be obtained on transmission.

For the full mathematics on directing beams using amplitude and phase shifts, see the mathematical section in phased array.

Beamforming techniques can be broadly divided into two categories:
* conventional (fixed or switched beam) beamformers
* adaptive beamformers or phased array
** Desired signal maximization mode
** Interference signal minimization or cancellation mode

Conventional beamformers, such as the Butler matrix, use a fixed set of weightings and time-delays (or phasings) to combine the signals from the sensors in the array, primarily using only information about the location of the sensors in space and the wave directions of interest. In contrast, adaptive beamforming techniques (e.g., MUSIC, SAMV) generally combine this information with properties of the signals actually received by the array, typically to improve rejection of unwanted signals from other directions. This process may be carried out in either the time or the frequency domain.

As the name indicates, an adaptive beamformer is able to automatically adapt its response to different situations. Some criterion has to be set up to allow the adaptation to proceed such as minimizing the total noise output. Because of the variation of noise with frequency, in wide band systems it may be desirable to carry out the process in the frequency domain.

Beamforming can be computationally intensive. Sonar phased array has a data rate low enough that it can be processed in real time in software, which is flexible enough to transmit or receive in several directions at once. In contrast, radar phased array has a data rate so high that it usually requires dedicated hardware processing, which is hard-wired to transmit or receive in only one direction at a time. However, newer field programmable gate arrays are fast enough to handle radar data in real time, and can be quickly re-programmed like software, blurring the hardware/software distinction.

==Sonar beamforming requirements==
Sonar beamforming utilizes a similar technique to electromagnetic beamforming, but varies considerably in implementation details. Sonar applications vary from 1 Hz to as high as 2 MHz, and array elements may be few and large, or number in the hundreds yet very small. This will shift sonar beamforming design efforts significantly between demands of such system components as the &quot;front end&quot; (transducers, pre-amplifiers and digitizers) and the actual beamformer computational hardware downstream. High frequency, focused beam, multi-element imaging-search sonars and acoustic cameras often implement fifth-order spatial processing that places strains equivalent to Aegis radar demands on the processors.

Many sonar systems, such as on torpedoes, are made up of arrays of up to 100 elements that must accomplish beam steering over a 100 degree field of view and work in both active and passive modes.

Sonar arrays are used both actively and passively in 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional arrays.

* 1-dimensional &quot;line&quot; arrays are usually in multi-element passive systems towed behind ships and in single- or multi-element side-scan sonar.
* 2-dimensional &quot;planar&quot; arrays are common in active/passive ship hull mounted sonars and some side-scan sonar.
* 3-dimensional spherical and cylindrical arrays are used in &#x27;sonar domes&#x27; in the modern submarine and ships.

Sonar differs from radar in that in some applications such as wide-area-search all directions often need to be listened to, and in some applications broadcast to, simultaneously. Thus a multibeam system is needed. In a narrowband sonar receiver, the phases for each beam can be manipulated entirely by signal processing software, as compared to present radar systems that use hardware to &#x27;listen&#x27; in a single direction at a time.

Sonar also uses beamforming to compensate for the significant problem of the slower propagation speed of sound as compared to that of electromagnetic radiation. In side-look-sonars, the speed of the towing system or vehicle carrying the sonar is moving at sufficient speed to move the sonar out of the field of the returning sound &quot;ping&quot;. In addition to focusing algorithms intended to improve reception, many side scan sonars also employ beam steering to look forward and backward to &quot;catch&quot; incoming pulses that would have been missed by a single sidelooking beam.

==Schemes==
* A conventional beamformer can be a simple beamformer also known as delay-and-sum beamformer. All the weights of the antenna elements can have equal magnitudes. The beamformer is steered to a specified direction only by selecting appropriate phases for each antenna. If the noise is uncorrelated and there are no directional interferences, the signal-to-noise ratio of a beamformer with formula_1 antennas receiving a signal of power formula_2, (where formula_3 is Noise variance or Noise power), is: formula_4
* A null-steering beamformer is optimized to have zero response in the direction of one or more interferers.
* A frequency-domain beamformer treats each frequency bin as a narrowband signal, for which the filters are complex coefficients (that is, gains and phase shifts), separately optimized for each frequency.

== Evolved Beamformer ==
The delay-and-sum beamforming technique uses multiple microphones to localize sound sources. One disadvantage of this technique is that adjustments of the position or of the number of microphones changes the performance of the beamformer nonlinearly. Additionally, due to the number of combinations possible, it is computationally hard to find the best configuration. One of the techniques to solve this problem is the use of genetic algorithms. Such algorithm searches for the microphone array configuration that provides the highest signal-to-noise ratio for each steered orientation. Experiments showed that such algorithm could find the best configuration of a constrained search space comprising ~33 million solutions in a matter of seconds instead of days.

== History in wireless communication standards ==
Beamforming techniques used in cellular phone standards have advanced through the generations to make use of more complex systems to achieve higher density cells, with higher throughput.

* Passive mode: (almost) non-standardized solutions
** Wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) supports direction of arrival (DOA) based beamforming
* Active mode: mandatory standardized solutions
** 2G – Transmit antenna selection as an elementary beamforming
** 3G – WCDMA: transmit antenna array (TxAA) beamforming 
** 3G evolution – LTE/UMB: multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) precoding based beamforming with partial space-division multiple access (SDMA)
** Beyond 3G (4G, 5G...) – More advanced beamforming solutions to support SDMA such as closed-loop beamforming and multi-dimensional beamforming are expected

An increasing number of consumer 802.11ac Wi-Fi devices with MIMO capability can support beamforming to boost data communication rates.

== Digital, analog, and hybrid ==
To receive (but not transmit), there is a distinction between analog and digital beamforming. For example, if there are 100 sensor elements, the &quot;digital beamforming&quot; approach entails that each of the 100 signals passes through an analog-to-digital converter to create 100 digital data streams. Then these data streams are added up digitally, with appropriate scale-factors or phase-shifts, to get the composite signals. By contrast, the &quot;analog beamforming&quot; approach entails taking the 100 analog signals, scaling or phase-shifting them using analog methods, summing them, and then usually digitizing the &quot;single&quot; output data stream.

Digital beamforming has the advantage that the digital data streams (100 in this example) can be manipulated and combined in many possible ways in parallel, to get many different output signals in parallel. The signals from every direction can be measured simultaneously, and the signals can be integrated for a longer time when studying far-off objects and simultaneously integrated for a shorter time to study fast-moving close objects, and so on. This cannot be done as effectively for analog beamforming, not only because each parallel signal combination requires its own circuitry, but more fundamentally because digital data can be copied perfectly but analog data cannot. (There is only so much analog power available, and amplification adds noise.) Therefore, if the received analog signal is split up and sent into a large number of different signal combination circuits, it can reduce the signal-to-noise ratio of each.

In MIMO communication systems with large number of antennas, so called massive MIMO systems, the beamforming algorithms executed at the digital baseband can get very complex.
In addition, if all beamforming is done at baseband, each antenna needs its own RF feed. At high frequencies and with large number of antenna elements, this can be very costly, and increase loss and complexity in the system. To remedy these issues, hybrid beamforming has been suggested where some of the beamforming is done using analog components and not digital.

There are many possible different functions that can be performed using analog components instead of at the digital baseband.

Beamforming, whether done digitally, or by means of analog architecture, has recently been applied in integrated sensing and communication technology. For instance, a beamformer was suggested, in imperfect channel state information situations to perform communication tasks, while at the same time performing target detection to sense targets in the scene.

==For speech audio==
Beamforming can be used to try to extract sound sources in a room, such as multiple speakers in the cocktail party problem. This requires the locations of the speakers to be known in advance, for example by using the time of arrival from the sources to mics in the array, and inferring the locations from the distances.

Compared to carrier-wave telecommunications, natural audio contains a variety of frequencies. It is advantageous to separate frequency bands prior to beamforming because different frequencies have different optimal beamform filters (and hence can be treated as separate problems, in parallel, and then recombined afterward). Properly isolating these bands involves specialized non-standard filter banks. In contrast, for example, the standard fast Fourier transform (FFT) band-filters implicitly assume that the only frequencies present in the signal are exact harmonics; frequencies which lie between these harmonics will typically activate all of the FFT channels (which is not what is wanted in a beamform analysis). Instead, filters can be designed in which only local frequencies are detected by each channel (while retaining the recombination property to be able to reconstruct the original signal), and these are typically non-orthogonal unlike the FFT basis.

<text>The is a member of the cabinet of Japan and is the leader and chief executive of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The minister is responsible for implementing Japan&#x27;s foreign policy and is also a statutory member of the National Security Council. The minister is nominated by the prime minister and is appointed by the emperor of Japan.

Since the end of the allied occupation of Japan, the position has been one of the most powerful in the cabinet, as Japan&#x27;s economic interests have long relied on foreign relations. The recent efforts of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and Shinzo Abe to establish a more interventionist foreign policy have also heightened the importance of the position.

The current minister for foreign affairs is Takeshi Iwaya, who took office on October 1, 2024.

<doc id="1326950" wikidata="Q2080143" url="?curid=1326950" title="French aircraft carrier Foch">
<text>Foch () was the second that served with the French Navy from 1963 to 2000. The carrier was the second warship named in honour of the Marshal of France, British Field Marshal and Marshal of Poland Ferdinand Foch.

After serving with the French Navy, the vessel was sold to Brazil and renamed . The Brazilian Navy scuttled her on 3 February 2023 in the Atlantic Ocean.

==Design==

The &quot;Clemenceau&quot;-class aircraft carriers, of which &quot;Foch&quot; was the last surviving member, were of conventional CATOBAR design. The landing area was long by wide; it was angled at 8 degrees off of the ship&#x27;s axis. The flight deck was long. The forward aircraft elevator was to starboard, and the rear elevator was positioned on the deck edge to save hangar space. The forward of two catapults were at the bow to port, the aft catapult was on the forward area of angled landing deck. The hangar deck dimensions are with overhead.

==History==

The draft statute, prepared by the Naval General Staff in 1949, asked for four aircraft carriers of 20,000 tons to be available in two phases. At its meeting of 22 August 1949, the Supreme Council of the Navy was even more ambitious, where they proposed a six aircraft carrier fleet. On 15 July 1952, the French Navy still wanted two to five for the French Navy (not available to NATO). According to RCM 12, the final document of the Lisbon Conference of 1952, France should make available to NATO an aircraft carrier on D-day, two on day 30, three on day 180.

But from 1953, the Navy had to revise its ambitions downwards, with a target of three aircraft carriers.

The PA 54 &quot;Clemenceau&quot;, budgeted in 1953, was delayed until November 1955, the PA 55 &quot;Foch&quot;, budgeted for 1955, was delayed until February 1957. Between 1980 and 1981, she underwent a study to certify the platform before catapulting aircraft, carrying missiles, bombs, AM-39 Exocet and tactical nuclear bombs. Like her sister ship , &quot;Foch&quot; underwent a modernization and refit, replacing four of her eight guns with two Crotale air-defense systems. Unlike &quot;Clemenceau&quot;, &quot;Foch&quot; also received in 1997 two Sadral launchers (for 6 Mistral missiles each); those launchers were purchased by France in 1994.

The Dassault Rafale was test flown from &quot;Foch&quot; (but not &quot;Clemenceau&quot;) after deck modifications in 1992 and operated from this carrier after further 1995–96 deck modifications.

After a 37-year career in the French Navy, on 15 November 2000, the carrier was sold to the Brazilian Navy, and renamed . In the French Navy, she was succeeded by .

== Principal operations ==
Main naval operations for the époque were conducted by sister ship &quot;Clemenceau&quot;. &quot;Foch&quot; was engaged in the following:

* 1966: &quot;Foch&quot; participated, with Alfa Force (), to the campaign of French nuclear experimentation in the Pacific.
* 1978 : during the Independence of Djibouti, &quot;Foch&quot; deployed in the Red Sea in Operation Saphir II.
* 1983 : &quot;Foch&quot; participated to the support of the French contingent deployed in Lebanon within the cadre of the Operation Olifant missions. The carrier would rotate with &quot;Clemenceau&quot; providing constant on station air support to French peacekeepers in the Multinational Force in Lebanon FSMB and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon UNIFIL.
* 1993–1999 : Foch was regularly engaged in Operations &quot;Balbuzard&quot;, &quot;Salamandre&quot; and &quot;Trident&quot; in the Adriatic Sea during the engagement of France in ex-Yugoslavia within the cadre of FORPRONU and the SFOR and KFOR. The carrier ensured the security of French elements deployed on the ground, and conducted aerial raids under the command of the United Nations and NATO.

===Combat history===
In 1977 F-8 Crusaders from 14.F squadron from &quot;Foch&quot; participated in the Saphir missions over Djibouti. On 7 May 1977, two Crusaders went separately on patrol against what were supposedly French Air Force (4/11 Jura squadron) F-100 Super Sabres stationed at Djibouti. The leader intercepted two fighters and initiated a dogfight as part of the training exercise, but quickly called his wingman for help as he had actually engaged two Yemeni MiG-21 Fishbeds. The two French fighters switched their master armament to &quot;on&quot; but, ultimately, everyone returned to their bases. This was the only combat interception by French Crusaders.

In October 1984, France sent &quot;Foch&quot; for Operation Mirmillon off the coast of Libya, in response to tension in the Gulf of Sidra.

She was involved in the Yugoslav Wars between July and August 1993, in February and March 1994, and in February and from May to July 1994 in support of UN operations. She also was part of NATO&#x27;s Allied force operations with Super Étendards flying strike missions over Serbia in 1999. She was forced to withdraw early four months into her deployment, the longest in her service history, due to problems with her catapult system and other issues.

In 2000, &quot;Foch&quot; made her last deployment by leading Task Force 473 on a four month around-the-world tour.

==In fiction==

&quot;Foch&quot; was featured prominently in the 1995 film &quot;Crimson Tide&quot; as the setting for several televised news reports by American journalist Richard Valeriani (playing himself in the film) about the ongoing conflict in Russia. &quot;Foch&quot; was used in this role after the U.S. Navy refused to assist in the film&#x27;s production, thus removing the possibility of filming on board a U.S. carrier.

<text>IronMind Enterprises, Inc. is an American niche market business based in Nevada City, California, that specializes in &quot;tools of the trade for serious strength athletes.&quot; Though many of its products include strength-training equipment and accessories, IronMind also publishes books, DVDs and the quarterly magazine &quot;MILO: A Journal For Serious Strength Athletes&quot;.

IronMind sponsors competitions in weightlifting, arm wrestling, grip strength and strongman at events such as the Arnold Sports Festival, the GNC Grip Gauntlet, and North American Strongman.

==Psychology and strength sports==
IronMind was founded in 1988 by Randall J. Strossen, a Stanford psychology PhD with a longstanding interest in weightlifting and related strength sports. That year also marked the beginning of Strossen&#x27;s 12-year stint writing a monthly column for &quot;Iron Man&quot; magazine about the psychology of bodybuilding and weightlifting.

IronMind&#x27;s slogan, &quot;Stronger Minds, Stronger Bodies,&quot; reflects the company&#x27;s roots in sports psychology. It is also the subtitle of Strossen&#x27;s second book, a partial collection of his columns for &quot;Iron Man&quot;, published by IronMind in 1994.

==Products==
Some of IronMind&#x27;s notable products include the Captains of Crush Grippers, the Rolling Thunder, the Vulcan Racks system, and the book &quot;Super Squats: How to Gain 30 Pounds of Muscle in 6 Weeks&quot;.

IronMind has been a mail-order company since its inception and publishes an annual product catalog that also provides training tips, a history of strength sports, and information on subjects ranging from hand health to nutrition.

The company counts scores of major collegiate and professional sports teams among its customers. Its Vulcan Racks are in use at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and at the US Olympic Education Center at Northern Michigan University.

The World&#x27;s Strongest Man (WSM) contest has used IronMind&#x27;s Draft Horse Pulling Harness for its competitions since 2002. In 2006, IronMind manufactured a harness for the WSM&#x27;s Car Walk event after consulting with two-time WSM winner Jouko Ahola on the design. It has been used at WSM competitions ever since.

Strength enthusiasts, people training at home and those with hand ailments such a carpal tunnel syndrome and arthritis make up the rest of IronMind&#x27;s patrons.

==Focus on grip strength==
Grip strength has been a major focus for IronMind since the company introduced its specialized line of grip-strength tools in 1990.

The idea that grip strength comprises three basic components – crushing, pinching and supporting elements (deadlifting, etc.) – was first presented to the world in the 1992 IronMind catalog. IronMind promoted and further developed this idea in later catalogs. It first published a chart in 1995 highlighting how grip strength applies to activities and professions ranging from law enforcement to powerlifting and playing music, and expanded on it in subsequent catalogs.

Two books written by grip-strength expert John Brookfield and published by IronMind – &quot;Mastery of Hand Strength, Revised Edition&quot; (2008) and &quot;The Grip Master&#x27;s Manual&quot; (2002) – also expand upon these basic components of grip strength, which are now considered as widely accepted fact.

===Captains of Crush Grippers===
IronMind is known worldwide for its Captains of Crush line of hand grippers. These grippers, considered the &quot;industry standard&quot; in building grip strength, have become somewhat of a cult phenomenon and have amassed a worldwide following – one British strength enthusiast has written into his will that he would like to be buried with his Captains of Crush hand gripper.

In 1991, IronMind began certifying people able to close the company&#x27;s benchmark Captains of Crush No. 3 gripper; certification on the Captains of Crush No. 4 was added in 1998 and certification on the Captains of Crush No. 3.5 was added in 2008.

Only five people (Joe Kinney, Nathan Holle, David Morton, Tommy Heslep and Magnus Samuelsson) have been certified for closing the No. 4.

==Publications==
IronMind has published 18 books by established authors such as John McCallum, Ben Weider and David Webster. It has also developed and published books by such first-time authors as John Brookfield, Steve Jeck, Steve Justa, Brad Johnson and Brian Jones, many of whom have become authorities in their fields.

Randall J. Strossen&#x27;s first book, &quot;Super Squats: How to Gain 30 Pounds of Muscle in 6 Weeks&quot; (1989), was also the first product offered by IronMind. It presents the classic 20-rep squat routine, a routine best known for helping people bulk up in a short period of time. The book is currently in its eighteenth printing (in English) and has been translated into German.

As a photographer and editor-in-chief for IronMind&#x27;s quarterly journal &quot;MILO&quot; (launched in 1993), Strossen flies over 100,000 miles a year to cover strength-sport events around the world. &quot;MILO&quot; is the only American bodybuilding or weightlifting magazine to receive media accreditation to cover weightlifting at the 1996, 2000, 2004 and the 2008 Olympics.

==Arnold Sports Festival==
IronMind has been involved as a sponsor or an organizer of the International Weightlifting Invitational, GNC Grip Gauntlet and Arm Wrestling events at the Arnold Sports Festival (also known as the Arnold Classic or just &quot;the Arnold&quot; and named after Arnold Schwarzenegger) for several years.

In 2005, IronMind worked with the event&#x27;s co-founder, Jim Lorimer, to bring Shi Zhiyong and Zhang Guozheng – the two gold medalists from China&#x27;s 2004 Olympic men&#x27;s weightlifting team – to Columbus, Ohio, for the weightlifting exhibition at that year&#x27;s festival.

The following year, IronMind continued to help internationalize the Arnold by bringing in three more 2004 Olympic medalists in weightlifting: George Asanidze (Republic of Georgia), Le Maosheng (China) and Velichko Cholakov (Bulgaria).

<text>Tel HaShomer (, &quot;lit.&quot; Hill of the Guardsman) or Kiryat Krinitzi is a neighborhood in Ramat Gan, Israel. It borders Kiryat Ono in the north, Yehud in the east, and Or Yehuda in the south. A major Israel Defense Forces base and the Sheba Medical Center are located in Tel HaShomer.

==History==

Tel Litvinsky (later Tel Hashomer) was a moshava established in 1934 by Moshe and Emil Litvinsky in memory of their father Elhanan Litvinsky. The first inhabitants were Jewish immigrants from Germany and Poland. In 1936, it was noted for its high proportion of academics and doctors.

During World War II, most of the village lands were expropriated for the construction of a British military base. The base was of strategic importance because it controlled the Jaffa–Lydda Airport road. It was also used to house Italian prisoners of war.

On November 29, 1947, the Palmach stole explosives and 75 rifles from the camp. Towards of the end of the British Mandate for Palestine, Arabs under the command of Hasan Salama began smuggling in arms and personnel disguised as laborers into the camp. The Haganah command saw this as a threat and on April 15, 1948, two companies for the 32nd and 33rd Battalions of the Alexandroni Brigade entered and captured the base. Arab forces counterattacked from al-Khayriyya, Kafr &#x27;Ana, al-&#x27;Abbasiyya and Saqiya, but the Jewish forces reinforced and pushed them back to a small salient in the south of the camp, which was captured later in Operation Hametz. The Alexandroni Brigade lost three soldiers, while the Arab losses were estimated at 50.

In 1948, the area was renamed Tel HaShomer after HaShomer, an early Ottoman-period Jewish defense organization.

==Landmarks==
Located on the grounds of the Israel Defense Forces base (Camp Yaakov Dori) are: 
* IDF recruitment office (&quot;Lishkat HaGiyus&quot;) – processes new draftees
*&quot;Meitav&quot;, until May 2006 known as &quot;Bsis Klita UMiyun&quot; (&quot;Bakum&quot;) – induction base for drafted soldiers, where they receive uniforms, basic gear, etc. and are sent to their units
* Merkava tank factory (7100th Maintenance Center)
* Ground Forces Technology Division (Unit 99)
* Headquarters of Educational Corps, Logistics Corps, Ordnance Corps, Medical Corps and formerly the headquarters of the Military Police

==Medical facilities==
Adjacent to the base are military and civilian hospitals in adjoining complexes known as the Tel HaShomer Hospital. The civilian hospital is Sheba Medical Center. Magen David Adom has its headquarters and main blood bank on site.

==Notable people==

*Rutu Modan, Israeli illustrator and comic book artist
*Yardena Samuels, Israeli molecular biologist
*Asaf Sagiv, Israeli composer

==Development plans==
In September 2015 it was announced that 11,500 housing units would replace the military complex on the site.

<text>Area code 941 is a telephone area code in the North American Numbering Plan for a west-central coastal portion of the U.S. state of Florida. Introduced on May 28, 1995, the numbering plan area includes the counties of Manatee, Sarasota, and Charlotte, areas along the Sun Coast of southwestern Florida, USA. It is the area code for North Port-Bradenton-Sarasota, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

DeSoto County, Charlotte County, Hardee County, Polk County, Okeechobee County, Glades County, and Hendry County were part of this area code until 1999, when area code 863 was created, and Lee County and Collier County were part of 941 until March 2003 when area code 239 was created. Before the designation of area code 941, the region was originally served by 305, then by area code 813.

Prior to October 2021, area code 941 had telephone numbers assigned for the central office code 988. In 2020, &quot;988&quot; was designated nationwide as a dialing code for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which created a conflict for exchanges that permit seven-digit dialing. This area code was therefore scheduled to transition to ten-digit dialing by October 24, 2021.

<doc id="1326977" wikidata="Q4924861" url="?curid=1326977" title="Doubting Thomas">
<text>A doubting Thomas is a skeptic who refuses to believe without direct personal experience – a reference to the Gospel of John&#x27;s depiction of the Apostle Thomas, who, in John&#x27;s account, refused to believe the resurrected Jesus had appeared to the ten other apostles until he could see and feel Jesus&#x27;s crucifixion wounds.

In art, the episode (formally called the Incredulity of Thomas) has been frequently depicted since at least the 15th century, with its depiction reflecting a range of theological interpretations.

==Gospel account==

The episode is related in chapter 20 of the Gospel of John, but not in the three synoptic Gospels. The text of the King James Version is as follows:
Commentators have noted that John avoids saying whether Thomas actually did &quot;thrust&quot; his hand in. Before the Protestant Reformation the usual belief, reflected in artistic depictions, was that he had done so, which most Catholic writers continued to believe, while Protestant writers often thought that he had not.

Regardless of the question of whether Thomas had felt as well as &quot;seen&quot; the physical evidence of the Resurrection of Jesus, the Catholic interpretation was that, although Jesus asserts the superiority of those who have faith without physical evidence, he was nonetheless willing to show Thomas his wound, and let him feel it. This was used by theologians as biblical encouragement for the use of physical experiences such as pilgrimages, veneration of relics and ritual in reinforcing Christian beliefs.

Protestant theologians emphasized Jesus&#x27;s statement of the superiority of &quot;faith alone&quot; (see &quot;sola fide&quot;), although the evangelical-leaning Anglican Thomas Hartwell Horne, in his widely read &quot;Introduction to the Critical Study and Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures&quot; (first published in 1818) treated Thomas&#x27;s incredulity, which he extended somewhat to the other apostles, approvingly, as evidence both of the veracity of the gospels, as a &quot;forger&quot; would be unlikely to have invented it, and of their proper suspicion of the seemingly impossible, demonstrating their reliability as witnesses. In the early church, Gnostic authors were very insistent that Thomas did not actually examine Jesus, and elaborated on this in apocryphal accounts, perhaps tending to push their non-Gnostic opponents in the other direction.

The theological interpretation of the episode has concentrated on it as a demonstration of the reality of the resurrection, but as early as the writings of the 4th- and 5th-century saints John Chrysostom and Cyril of Alexandria it had been given a eucharistic interpretation, seen as an allegory of the sacrament of the Eucharist, what remained a recurring theme in commentary.

==Art==
In art this subject, formally termed The Incredulity of Saint Thomas, has been common since at least the early 6th century, when it appears in the mosaics at Basilica of Sant&#x27;Apollinare Nuovo in Ravenna, and on the Monza ampullae. In those depictions, as later in the Baroque, the subject, normally depicted at the moment Thomas puts his fingers into Jesus&#x27;s side, was used to emphasize the importance of physical experiences and evidences for the believer, as described above. The Ravenna mosaic introduces the motif of Jesus raising his hand high to reveal the wound in his side; his pose often, but not always, is such that the wounds on his hands can also be seen, and often those on his feet as well. 
The scene was used in a number of contexts in medieval art, including Byzantine icons. Where there was room all the apostles were often shown, and sometimes Thomas&#x27;s acceptance of the Resurrection is shown, with Thomas kneeling and Jesus blessing him. This iconography leaves it unclear whether the moment shown follows an examination or not, but probably suggests that it does not, especially in Protestant art. From the late Middle Ages onwards a number of variations of the poses of the two figures occur (see gallery). The typical &quot;touching&quot; representation formed one of a number of scenes sometimes placed around a central &quot;Crucifixion of Jesus&quot;, and is one of the scenes shown on the Irish Muiredach&#x27;s High Cross, and the subject of a large relief in the famous Romanesque sculpted cloister at the Abbey of Santo Domingo de Silos. In works showing pairs of typologically related scenes from the Old and New Testaments it could be paired with &quot;Jacob Wrestling with the Angel&quot;, but in a 10th-century Ottonian ivory diptych it is paired with &quot;Moses receiving the Law&quot;, comparing both the two Biblical Testaments and the support for the faith from both textual &quot;sacred writ&quot; and physical evidences.

In the later Middle Ages Jesus with one side of his robe pulled back, displaying the wound in his side and his other four wounds (called the &quot;ostentatio vulnerum&quot;), was taken from images with Thomas and turned into a pose adopted by Jesus alone, who often places his own fingers into the wound in his side. This form became a common feature of single iconic figures of Jesus and subjects such as the &quot;Last Judgement&quot; (where Bamberg Cathedral has an early example of about 1235), &quot;Christ in Majesty&quot;, the &quot;Man of Sorrows&quot; and Christ with the &quot;Arma Christi&quot;, and was used to emphasize Christ&#x27;s suffering as well as the fact of his Resurrection.

In the Renaissance the famous sculpted pair of &quot;Christ and St. Thomas&quot; by Andrea del Verrocchio (1467–1483) for the Orsanmichele in Florence is the best known representation; the subject is rare in free-standing sculpture. This guild church also housed commercial tribunals, and the presentation of physical evidence gave the subject a particular relevance to courts and justice, and it appeared on many other buildings in Tuscany with judicial functions. The Medici family, heavily involved in the commission, also had a particular association with St Thomas, though the painting by Salviati seems to reflect anti-Medici feeling in the 1540s.

The subject enjoyed a revival in popularity in Counter-Reformation art as an assertion of Catholic doctrine against Protestant rejection of the Catholic practices which the episode was held to support, and Protestant belief in &quot;faith alone&quot;. In the Catholic interpretation, although Jesus asserts the superiority of those who have faith without physical evidence, he was nonetheless willing to show Thomas his wound, and let him feel it. &quot;The Incredulity of Saint Thomas&quot; by Caravaggio (c. 1601–1602) is now the most famous depiction (unusually showing Thomas to the viewer&#x27;s right of Jesus), but there are many others, especially by the Utrecht Caravaggisti, painting in a Protestant environment, such as the Flemish Caravaggist Matthias Stom, whose two versions of the subject are now in Madrid and Bergamo. Both Rembrandt (Pushkin Museum) and Rubens (centrepiece of the &quot;Rockox Triptych&quot;, Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp) also painted it.

==Gallery==
&lt;br&gt;
==Medieval drama==
The dramatic nature of the episode meant that it often featured in medieval drama telling the story of the life of Jesus. It takes the whole of &quot;Play 41&quot; of the York Mystery Cycle, probably dating from some time between 1463 and 1477, which takes 195 six-line stanzas to tell it. Other shorter cycles omit it, and the Chester Mystery Plays take 70 lines to cover it. Thomas also appears in the Cornish language &quot;Ordinalia&quot;.

==Related legends==
The biblical episode generated two late medieval legends or stories, which also appear in art.

===Girdle of Thomas===

In this story, at the Assumption of Mary, where the other apostles were present, Thomas once again missed the occasion (being on his way back from his mission to India), so the Virgin Mary, aware of Thomas&#x27;s sceptical nature, appeared to him individually and dropped the girdle (cloth belt) she was wearing down onto him, to give him a physical proof of what he had seen. In other versions he is present at the actual Assumption, and the Virgin dropped her girdle down to him as she was taken up to heaven. The supposed girdle itself (&quot;Sacra Cintola&quot;) is a relic of Prato Cathedral, and its veneration was regarded as especially helpful for pregnant women. After Florence took control of Prato in 1350–51, the girdle begins to feature in Florentine art and to be shown worn by figures of Madonna del Parto, iconic figures showing the Virgin Mary when pregnant.

The first version of the story is called the &quot;Madonna of the Girdle&quot; in art. An altarpiece by Palma Vecchio, now in the Brera Gallery in Milan, shows an intermediate version, with Thomas hurrying towards the other apostles, and the Virgin taking off her girdle. In other works Thomas is catching the falling girdle, or has received the girdle and holds it.

===Incredulity of Jerome===
Saint Francis of Assisi (1181/1182 – 1226) had a vision in 1224, after which he acquired stigmata on his own body, repeating the wounds of Jesus, which he kept until his death. According to the many who saw them, the wounds on his hands and feet were as if the nails still remained in place, and the nail-like projections could be moved. An early biographer of Francis, Saint Bonaventure (1221–1274), reported that a soldier called Jerome was sceptical and moved the &quot;nails&quot; about. Jerome is thought to be shown examining Francis&#x27; feet in the frescos of the Bardi Chapel of Santa Croce, Florence by Giotto and his workshop, and appears in some other Franciscan works.

<text>The Java War () or Diponegoro War () was fought in central Java from 1825 to 1830, between the colonial Dutch Empire and native Javanese rebels. The war started as a rebellion led by Prince Diponegoro, a leading member of the Javanese aristocracy who had previously cooperated with the Dutch.

The rebel forces laid siege to Yogyakarta, a move that prevented a quick victory. This gave the Dutch time to reinforce their army with colonial and European troops, allowing them to end the siege in 1825. After this defeat, the rebels continued fighting a guerrilla war for five years.

The war ended in a Dutch victory, and Prince Diponegoro was invited to a peace conference. He was betrayed and captured. Due to the cost of the war, Dutch colonial authorities implemented major reforms throughout the Dutch East Indies to ensure the colonies remained profitable.

== History ==
The direct cause of the Java War was the decision by the Dutch to build a road across a piece of Diponegoro&#x27;s property that contained his parents&#x27; tomb. Longstanding grievances reflected tensions between the Javanese aristocracy and the increasingly powerful Dutch. Javanese aristocratic families were resentful about Dutch laws restricting their rental profits. The Dutch, meanwhile, were unwilling to lose influence over the Yogyakartan court.

Dutch influence also affected the cultural dynamics of Java. A devout Muslim, Diponegoro was alarmed by the increasingly relaxed religious observance at court. This included the rising influence of Christian Dutch colonists and the court&#x27;s pro-Dutch leanings. Among Diponegoro&#x27;s followers, the war was described as a jihad &quot;both against the Dutch and the &quot;murtad&quot; or apostate Javanese.&quot;

Following a common colonial strategy, the Dutch worked to exacerbate a succession crisis for the Yogyakartan throne. Diponegoro was the eldest son of Hamengkubuwono III, but his right to succeed was disputed because his mother was not the queen. Diponegoro&#x27;s rivals were his younger half-brother Hamengkubuwono IV and his then-infant nephew Hamengkubuwono V, who were supported by the Dutch.

== Hostilities ==
The Java War began 21 July 1825 when Prince Diponegoro raised the standard of revolt on his estate at Selarong. The rebel forces were successful in the early stages of the war, taking control of central Java and besieging Yogyakarta. The Javanese population was generally supportive of Prince Diponegoro&#x27;s cause. 

However, as the war persisted, Prince Diponegoro had difficulties retaining his army. By contrast, the Dutch colonial army was able to fill its ranks with indigenous troops from Sulawesi, and eventually received reinforcements of European troops from the Netherlands. Dutch commander General de Kock ended the rebel siege on Yogyakarta on 25 September 1825.

Prince Diponegoro then began an extensive guerrilla war. Until 1827, the Dutch army struggled to protect the Javanese hinterland, so they bolstered their territorial defense by deploying mobile detachments of colonial troops, based in small forts throughout central Java. It is estimated that 200,000 died over the course of the conflict, including 8,000 Dutch.

The rebellion ended in 1830, after Prince Diponegoro was tricked into entering Dutch-controlled territory near Magelang, under the pretense of negotiations for a possible ceasefire. He was captured and exiled to Manado, and then to Makassar, where he died in 1855.

== Aftermath ==
Dutch sources estimated 200,000 Javanese deaths; about one tenth in combat and the remainder from disease, starvation and other causes. Dutch military fatalities were 15,000, of which 8,000 were Europeans. 

Due to the Dutch forces&#x27; heavy losses, the colonial government decided to enlist African recruits in Gold Coast: the so-called &quot;Belanda Hitam&quot; (&quot;Black Dutchmen&quot;), to augment its East Indian and European troops.

The war was detrimental to Dutch finances; thus, the pacification of Java enabled the colonial government of the Dutch East Indies to implement &quot;Cultuurstelsel&quot; (&quot;The Cultivation System&quot;) in Java without any local opposition in 1830. Overseen by the new governor general, Johannes van den Bosch, this cultivation system required that 20% of village land be devoted to growing cash crops for export at government rates.

Alternatively, peasants had to work in government-owned plantations for 60 days of the year. Dutch colonialists and their native allies amassed enormous wealth through this forced-export system. The profits from the colony more than repaid the Netherlands for the war, and made the Dutch East Indies self-sufficient.

The Java War is also well-known for the long-term influence it had on the relationship between the Chinese community in Java and the Javanese people. In addition to the Dutch, the Chinese minority in Java is also being targeted by the Diponegoro forces. For example, the Chinese residents of Ngawi and Bengawan Solo&#x27;s riverbanks. They mutilated children, women, and men of Chinese descent. The Diponegoro troops despised the Dutch and the Chinese as foreign &#x27;infidels&#x27; who had come to pillage Java.

<doc id="1326997" wikidata="Q7892247" url="?curid=1326997" title="United States Trustee Program">
<text>The United States Trustee Program is a component of the United States Department of Justice that is responsible for the administration of bankruptcy cases and private trustees. The applicable federal law is found at and , 

In addition to the 21 United States Trustees, the program is administered by the Executive Office for U.S. Trustees (EOUST), located in Washington, D.C., and 95 field offices. The United States Trustee is the federal official charged with enforcing civil bankruptcy laws in the United States.

==Overview==
The United States Attorney General generally appoints a separate United States Trustee for each of 21 geographical regions for a five-year term. Each United States Trustee is removable from office by and works under the general supervision of the Attorney General (see and ). Each United States Trustee, an officer of the Department of Justice, is responsible for maintaining and supervising a panel of private trustees for Chapter 7 bankruptcy cases (see ). The United States Trustee has other duties including the oversight of administration of most bankruptcy cases and trustees (see generally ).

Each of the 21 regional U.S. Trustees maintains an office in each judicial district within the trustee&#x27;s region, except for Alabama and North Carolina, which are not administered by the U.S. Trustee program, but utilize what is called the bankruptcy administrator, performing a similar function to the U.S. Trustee. 

The U.S. Trustee does not have prosecution powers, but is required by law to refer information regarding potential criminal violations of bankruptcy laws to the United States Attorney.

Interim trustees serve by the U.S. Trustee&#x27;s appointment in Chapter 7 cases. Generally the interim trustee is assigned at random from a &quot;panel&quot; of qualified individuals at the time a bankruptcy case is filed, and is automatically appointed as the &quot;permanent&quot; case trustee after the first meeting of creditors.

Due to the relative infrequency of filing of petitions for Chapter 12 (family farmer debt adjustment) relief, trustees for these cases are typically appointed on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis.

Each judicial district has one or more Standing Chapter 13 Trustees. The Standing Trustees are responsible for the administration of all Chapter 13 cases filed in their judicial district.

If for any reason all panel and/or standing trustees are disqualified or unable to perform, the U.S. Trustee may serve as trustee for a particular case under Chapter 7, 12 or 13. This very rarely happens.

The U.S. Trustee&#x27;s office conducts the first meeting of creditors in a Chapter 11 case. Most Chapter 11&#x27;s do not require the appointment of a trustee: however, in those cases which do, the U.S. Trustee oversees the appointed trustee&#x27;s handling of the case and, for good cause, can seek the removal or replacement of the trustee. The U.S. Trustee may not, however, serve as the case trustee in Chapter 11. Along with the creditors committees, the U.S. Trustee acts as the primary &quot;watchdog&quot; to ensure compliance with the Bankruptcy Code in cases where no trustee has been appointed.

Accounting staffers within the Trustee&#x27;s office review all debtor filings, and monitor trustee and attorney fees in all cases. Attorneys employed by the Trustee represent the office in United States bankruptcy court and pursue civil sanctions for some egregious violations of the law in Chapter 7, 12 and 13 cases.

==Executive Office for United States Trustees==
The Executive Office for United States Trustees (EOUST) is part of The United States Department of Justice (DOJ). The EOUST is the component of the Department of Justice responsible for overseeing the administration of bankruptcy cases and private trustees. The responsibility of the EOUST as the top level office controlling DOJ attorneys who monitor conduct in U.S. Bankruptcy Courts is analogous to that of The Executive Office for United States Attorneys (EOUSA) as responsible for prosecutors of the DOJ. The current Director of the Office is Tara Twomey, who was appointed Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Trustees (EOUST) on February 27, 2023.

In contract with the EOUSA, the EOUST maintains indirect publicity and refers to its offices as the &quot;U.S. Trustee Program&quot;.

===Criminal referral===
When a government attorney working at the EOUST or any of its regional or field offices observes or suspects any criminal activity, it must be referred to the United States Attorney&#x27;s Office in the District in which the suspected crime occurred. The official policy of the EOUST is to include a review of such criminal referrals as part of the employee evaluation for each DOJ attorney employed as a U.S. Trustee.

<text>Karen Sisco is an American crime drama television series starring Carla Gugino in the title role. The series was created by novelist Elmore Leonard, based on a character who had appeared in several of his written works, as well as one film adaptation, 1998&#x27;s &quot;Out of Sight&quot;. The series debuted on October 1, 2003 on ABC, and was canceled after ten episodes, with Gugino later reprising her role from the series in a 2012 third season episode of &quot;Justified&quot;.

As a U.S. Deputy Marshal, based on Miami, Florida&#x27;s Gold Coast, Karen must deal with the underbelly of South Beach nightlife and Palm Beach high life while tracking down fugitives. She also struggles to win the respect of her fellow officers. Karen occasionally gets advice from her father, a retired Miami police officer turned private investigator, who is Karen’s confidant, counselor, and confessor. The show faced stiff competition from NBC&#x27;s &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;.

&quot;TV Guide&quot; included the series in their 2013 list of 60 shows that were &quot;Canceled Too Soon&quot;.

==Character history==
Prior to the events of the series, the character appeared in two stories:
* &quot;Karen Makes Out&quot;, a 1996 short story, available in two collections: &quot;Murder for Love&quot;, and &quot;When the Women Come Out to Dance, and Other Stories&quot;
* &quot;Out of Sight&quot;, a 1996 novel, and 1998 film wherein she was played by Jennifer Lopez, and Marshall Sisco was played by Dennis Farina.

==Cast==
* Carla Gugino as Karen Sisco
* Robert Forster as Marshall Sisco, Karen&#x27;s father
* Bill Duke as Amos Andrews, Karen&#x27;s boss

===Recurring===
* Jeffrey De Serrano as Edwards
* Frank Pesce as Sonny
* Robert Deacon as Mordecai Jones
* Obba Babatundé as Daniel Burden
* Jake Mailey as Jethro

==Production==
Jason Smilovic and Peter Lefcourt were co-executive producers and writers, with Smilovic having developed the series. Scott Frank, nominated for an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay for &quot;Out of Sight&quot;, served as an executive consultant.

==Connections to other media==
Gugino appeared as &quot;Karen Goodall&quot; in the second episode of the third season of &quot;Justified&quot;, which is also based on a work by Leonard. There, the character had been promoted to Assistant Director in the Marshals Service, and had married and divorced, taking and keeping the last name Goodall. This name change was necessary as FX did not own the rights to the Karen Sisco character, or her stories.

<text>Clyde Edward Lovellette ( ; September 7, 1929 – March 9, 2016) was an American professional basketball player. Lovellette was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1988. He was the first basketball player in history to achieve the Triple Crown — playing on an NCAA championship team, Olympics gold medal basketball team, and NBA championship squad.

==Basketball career==
Lovellette fostered the trend of tall, physical and high-scoring centers. A two-time All-State performer at Garfield High School in Terre Haute, Indiana. As a high school junior (1946–47), Lovellette&#x27;s previously undefeated high school team in Terre Haute, Indiana, lost in the Indiana state championship finals to a Shelbyville team led by Bill Garrett. The six-foot-nine Lovellette later attended the University of Kansas where he became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity.

While at Kansas, where he played for Basketball Hall of Fame coach Forrest &quot;Phog&quot; Allen, Lovellette was a two-time first-team All-American and led the Big Seven Conference in scoring in each of his three seasons. Lovellette led the United States in scoring his senior year (1951–52) with 28.4 points per game and was named the Helms College Player of the Year.

Lovellette and basketball legend Dean Smith were teammates at Kansas. He is still the only college player to lead the nation in scoring and win the NCAA title in the same year. Lovellette&#x27;s dominance in the paint landed him a place on the 1952 Summer Olympics gold medal team in Helsinki, Finland and he was the team&#x27;s dominating player and leading scorer.

In the 1952 NBA draft, Lovelette was picked ninth overall as the first-round pick of the Minneapolis Lakers.

Following graduation, Lovelette played in the 1951–1952 and 1952–1953 seasons for the Bartlesville Phillips 66ers.

At the professional level, Lovelette became one of the first big men to move outside and utilize the one-handed set shot that extended his shooting range and offensive repertoire. This tactic enabled him to play either the small forward, power forward or center positions, forcing the opposition&#x27;s big man to play out of position. In 1957, Lovelette led Minneapolis to the NBA Western Division Finals by averaging a playoffs career best 24.2 points along with 9.4 rebounds per game. Despite performing big, including scoring 33 points and grabbing 9 rebounds in Game 2 of the series, Lovelette and the Lakers were eliminated by Bob Pettit and the St. Louis Hawks.

That offseason, Lovelette was traded to Cincinnati for 5 players, including Hot Rod Hundley and Monk Meineke. A year later he was traded again, this time to St. Louis for Wayne Embry, among others.

In 704 NBA games with the Minneapolis Lakers, Cincinnati Royals, St. Louis Hawks and Boston Celtics, Lovellette scored 11,947 points (17.0 ppg) and grabbed 6,663 rebounds (9.3 rpg). Selected to play in four NBA All-Star Games, Lovellette was an integral component of championships in Minneapolis (1954) and Boston (1963, 1964).

In 1972–73, he coached the Decatur Bullets of the Continental Basketball Association for one season before the team folded. He was paid $150 per game.

==Honors==
Lovellette is one of only eight players in history to achieve the basketball Triple Crown — winning an NCAA championship, an NBA championship, and an Olympic gold medal. He also became the first player to win a championship with both the Boston Celtics and Minneapolis/Los Angeles Lakers. Rajon Rondo became the second player ever in 2020.

Lovellette was inducted into the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame in 1982.

Lovelette had his #16 jersey retired by the University of Kansas.

Lovelette was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1988. As of 2018, Lovellette is the only player from the 1952 NBA draft to make the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.

He was featured in the 1950s All-Star roster on NBA Live 2007.

==Personal==

Clyde married Sally Wheeler while attending the University of Kansas. They had three daughters, Cynthia, Linda, and Cherie.

After retiring from his career as a professional basketball player he was elected as Sheriff of Vigo County, Indiana. He owned a small farm, raising and showing cattle. He also engaged in various business activities, eventually getting his master&#x27;s degree.

At Whites Residential Services, a faith-based school in Wabash County, Indiana for at-risk teenagers, he served for 20 years and was successful in providing a positive influence on their lives.

A summer residence in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan ultimately became a full time residence in the small town of Munising where he served as the Varsity Basketball Assistant Coach and on the Munising City Council.

Clyde came back to Indiana as a full-time resident where he eventually died of cancer in North Manchester, at the age of 86, surrounded by his family.

<text>Assorus or Assoros (), or Asserus or Asseros (Ἄσσηρος), also known as Assorium or Assorion (Ἀσσώριον), was a city of the interior of ancient Sicily, situated about halfway between Agyrium and Enna. It was a city of the Siculi, and appears never to have received a Greek colony. In 396 BCE it is mentioned by Diodorus as the only Siculian town which remained faithful to Dionysius of Syracuse, at the time of the great Carthaginian expedition under Himilco. In consequence, we find Dionysius, after the defeat of the Carthaginians, concluding a treaty of alliance with the Assorini, and leaving them in possession of their independence. At this time it would seem to have been a place of some importance; but no subsequent mention of it occurs in ancient writers until the days of Cicero, in whose time it appears to have been but a small town, though retaining its municipal independence, and possessing a territory fertile in corn. It suffered severely, in common with the neighbouring towns, from the exactions of Verres. We learn from Pliny the Elder and Ptolemy, that it continued to exist under the Roman Empire. and the modern town of Assoro undoubtedly occupies the site, as well as retains, with little alteration, the name of Assorus. 

According to Tommaso Fazello, the remains of the ancient walls, and one of the gates, were still visible in his time (16th century). It was situated on a lofty hill, at the foot of which flowed the river Chrysas (now called the Dittaino), the tutelary deity of which was worshipped with peculiar reverence by the Assorini, and inhabitants of the neighbouring cities. His temple was situated, as we learn from Cicero, at a short distance from the town, on the road to Enna; and so sacred was it deemed, that even Verres did not venture openly to violate it, but his emissaries made an unsuccessful attempt to carry off the statue of the deity in the night. Fazello asserts that considerable remains of this temple were still extant in his day; but the description he gives of them would lead us to suppose that they must have belonged to an ancient edifice of a different class.

The coins of Assorus bear on the reverse a standing figure, with the name annexed of Chrysas. They are found only of copper, and are evidently of late date, from the fact that the legends are in Latin.

<doc id="1327014" wikidata="Q736208" url="?curid=1327014" title="Limoncello">
<text>Limoncello () is an Italian lemon liqueur mainly produced in southern Italy, especially in the region around the Gulf of Naples, the Amalfi Coast and Sicily. It is the second-most popular liqueur in Italy and is traditionally served chilled as an after-dinner digestif. It is also a popular homemade liqueur, with various recipes available online and in print.

Limoncello is made from the zest of lemons and usually has a slightly turbid appearance, which originates from suspended small essential oil droplets.

==History==
The exact origin of limoncello is disputed. The industry trade group says that limoncello was created at the beginning of the 1900s by the grandmother of Maria Antonia Farace, who lived in a small guesthouse in Isola Azzurra. US sources say that it was either invented in Sicily about 100 years ago, or that it was first made on the Amalfi Coast, where several villages and islands claim to be its place of origin. Journalist Kristen Tillotson reports that it may either have been invented by a citrus-grove tender from Azzurra around 1900 or by monks or fishermen much earlier.

==Production==

Limoncello is mainly produced in southern Italy, especially in the region around the Gulf of Naples, the Amalfi Coast and Sicily.

Traditionally, limoncello is made from the zest of Femminello St. Teresa lemons, also known as Sorrento or Sfusato lemons. Lemon zest, or peels without the pith, is steeped in rectified spirit until the oil is released. The resulting yellow liquid is then mixed with simple syrup. Varying the sugar-to-water ratio and the temperature affects the clarity, viscosity, and flavor. It has a slightly turbid appearance, which originates from the presence of small (approximately 100 nanometers) essential oil droplets suspended in the drink. Opaque limoncello is the result of spontaneous emulsification (otherwise known as the ouzo effect) of the sugar syrup and extracted lemon oils.

Commercial production was about 15 million liters in 2003.

==Popularity==

Limoncello is the second-most popular liqueur in Italy after Campari.

==Serving==
Limoncello is traditionally served chilled as an after-dinner digestif.

It can also be served as a spritz by mixing it with Prosecco &amp; Lemonade or Soda water. With Limoncello originating from the Amalfi Coast, it is sometimes known as an Amalfi spritz.

==Alcohol content==
Alcohol content can vary widely, especially among homemade variants, but the typical alcohol content is about 30% by volume.

==Variants==
Many variations of limoncello are also available. These include arancello (flavored with oranges), agrumello (flavored with mixed citrus), pistachiocello (flavored with pistachio nuts), meloncello (flavored with cantaloupe), and fragoncello (flavored with strawberry). A version made with milk instead of simple syrup also exists, known as and is often less alcoholic, at around 17% alcohol content by volume.

<text>KTVB (channel 7) is a television station in Boise, Idaho, United States, affiliated with NBC and owned by Tegna Inc. The station&#x27;s studios are located on West Fairview Avenue (off I-184) in Boise, and its transmitter is located on Deer Point in unincorporated Boise County. It is rebroadcast by KTFT-LD (channel 7) in Twin Falls, which airs KTVB programming with local advertising for the Magic Valley area from its transmitter on Flat Top Butte near Jerome, Idaho, and maintains a local sales office in Twin Falls.

Channel 7 was the second television station to be built in Idaho, debuting on July 12, 1953, as KIDO-TV. Though KFXD-TV (channel 6) in Nampa beat KIDO-TV to the air by a month, KIDO-TV was by far the more organized operation with network and local programming, neither of which KFXD-TV featured in its brief two-month tenure on air. It was owned by Georgia Davidson alongside Boise radio station KIDO and a primary affiliate of NBC, though it also held affiliations with other networks in its early history. KIDO radio was separated from the TV station in 1958, and channel 7 changed its call sign to KTVB the next year. Davidson was for years the only female owner at NBC TV affiliate meetings. By the 1970s, KTVB had emerged as the news ratings leader in Boise, a position it has not yielded since.

King Broadcasting acquired KTVB in 1979. The station continued to lead local news ratings in the market with long-tenured personalities. In 1986, KTVB established K38AS (now KTFT-LD), the first low-power NBC affiliate. KTVB has been sold in larger transactions three times since 1990: to the Providence Journal Company, Belo Corporation, and Gannett, whose broadcast division split off as Tegna in 2015.

==History==
===Construction and early years===
Boise radio station KIDO, owned by Georgia Davidson, filed with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in March 1952 seeking to build a television station on the city&#x27;s allotted channel 7. The application arrived in anticipation of the end of the FCC&#x27;s multi-year freeze on TV station applications. The construction permit was granted on December 23, KIDO already had some equipment on hand; the month before, it conducted a closed-circuit demonstration of television at its AM transmitter site. On an elevation behind the city, construction began in February on the transmitter site. The station signed for affiliation with the CBS, NBC, and DuMont networks; KIDO radio had maintained NBC affiliation since 1937.

From studios on 700 Crestline Drive, KIDO-TV began broadcasting on July 12, 1953; Philo Farnsworth, a television pioneer, was one of the guests of honor at the dedication. It was not the first television station to make its bow in Idaho, but under the circumstances, it was effectively the first serious station to set up. On June 18, KFXD-TV (channel 6) in Nampa put out its first test pattern. Reliant exclusively on old movies with no studio facilities, it lasted less than two months before leaving the air. The lone missing national network, ABC, affiliated with KIDO-TV in December. This replaced CBS, which had moved to new station KBOI-TV (channel 2) the previous month.

National live programming became a reality beginning with the 1955 World Series after a microwave transmission link between Boise and Salt Lake City was set up by the two stations. KIDO-TV&#x27;s tower was relocated to Deer Point in 1956, which together with an increased effective radiated power extended the station&#x27;s coverage to a further 80,000 people. Davidson agreed to sell KIDO radio to the Mesabi Western Corp. in November 1958; the radio station retained its call sign, and channel 7 became KTVB on February 1, 1959. The sale alleviated cash issues for the television station, which struggled financially in its early years and particularly after Boise became a two-station market; in a 1978 interview, Davidson noted that she &quot;lived with the spectre of bankruptcy, a very embarrassing bankruptcy, day or night&quot;.

===KTVB in La Grande, Oregon: KTVR===
KTVB received a construction permit on December 18, 1963, to expand its reach with the construction of a satellite station channel 13 in La Grande, Oregon, northwest of Boise. KTVR began broadcasting on December 6, 1964. It initially offered local news and information for Eastern Oregon from studios in La Grande. In 1967, KTVB closed the local operation in La Grande and converted KTVR into a full-time rebroadcaster of the Boise station.

In 1974, KTVB received an offer from the Oregon Educational and Public Broadcasting Service (OEPBS) to acquire KTVR for integration into its statewide public television network and serve large areas of Eastern Oregon. Citing a lack of local viewership and the availability of NBC stations from Spokane and Portland, KTVB took KTVR out of service on March 7, 1975, while the deal was pending; it did not return to the air under OEPBS ownership until February 1977. It was the second time KTVB had provided facilities to public television; in Boise, KTVB aired &quot;Sesame Street&quot; when the show debuted in 1969, as Idaho did not have a public station at the time, and it provided its transmitter site and engineering resources to launch KAID-TV (channel 4) in 1971.

===Growth and new studios===
Ground was broken for new studios at 5400 Fairview Avenue in 1970, and the facility formally opened the next year. The facility boasted the largest TV studio in Idaho. In 1974, KTVB lost ABC programming to a new station—KITC-TV, soon renamed KIVI-TV, on channel 6. 

Davidson—long the only female owner within the NBC television network among 125 men at annual meetings—announced the sale of KTVB to King Broadcasting in 1979. The sale was conceived by Davidson to ensure the continued existence of the station, as she feared a large estate tax burden for her family were she to die, diminishing KTVB&#x27;s profits and ability to invest. King Broadcasting took over in April 1980, retaining senior management; it ceased carrying paid religious programming on Sunday mornings to conform with its new owners&#x27; policies.

===Providence Journal, Belo, and Gannett/Tegna ownership===
King Broadcasting Company put itself up for sale in 1990, citing the age of its majority owners, Patsy Bullitt Collins and Harriet Stimson Bullitt, the daughters of the late Dorothy Bullitt. It accepted an offer from the Providence Journal Company in 1991; the transaction closed in 1992. Under Providence Journal, KTVB became a contributor to the new Northwest Cable News (NWCN) regional service when it launched in 1995, with one reporter dedicated to NWCN based in Boise. The Belo Corporation purchased Providence Journal in 1996.

At the end of October 2003, KTVB launched 24/7 NewsChannel on its second digital subchannel and local cable, one of the first digital secondary subchannels in the nation. The subchannel&#x27;s programming initially consisted of time-shifted newscasts and feature programs, though plans called for original news programs and other local programming. By 2011, the station had rebranded its 24/7 NewsChannel as &quot;Idaho&#x27;s Very Own 24/7&quot;, and it aired a dedicated 6:30 p.m. newscast and 7 a.m. morning news extension. The subchannel more recently has served as an outlet for local sports coverage, including for the 2023-24 season a package of Boise State Broncos men&#x27;s basketball games and Idaho Steelheads minor league hockey.

On June 13, 2013, the Gannett Company announced that it would acquire Belo. The sale was completed on December 23. Gannett&#x27;s TV stations and newspapers split into separate companies in 2015, the former being named Tegna.

==KTVB in Twin Falls: KTFT-LD==
Plans to extend channel 7 to Twin Falls had existed almost as long as the station. In 1955, then-KIDO-TV partnered with Twin Falls radio station KTFI to obtain a construction permit for channel 13 in that city, awarded as KHTV. The station grant was reinstated despite protests by KLIX-TV (channel 11, now KMVT) that it would put the local outlet out of business; it was sold and dropped the proposal.

Renewed interest in bringing KTVB over-the-air to Twin Falls began in 1981, when King Broadcasting filed for a construction permit for a low-power TV station. This was later abandoned in favor of a channel 38 permit acquired from American Community Broadcasting, Inc., which already had another channel. The station debuted on July 1, 1986, as K38AS, the first low-power station to be an NBC affiliate; KMVT ceased offering NBC programs leading up to its launch. Its programming consisted of KTVB with Twin Falls-area commercials, sold from an advertising office in town. In December 1994, the station took a four-letter call sign of KTFT-LP (for &quot;Twin Falls Television&quot;).

==News operation==
News coverage from channel 7 started with its first day on air. Vern Moore, a KIDO announcer, was the first voice heard on the new KIDO-TV and the first TV news anchor in Idaho. However, the station was initially not very competitive against KBOI-TV. When Robert Krueger—Georgia Davidson&#x27;s son-in-law, who would serve in management for 40 years—started at then-KIDO-TV in 1956, he&#x27;d joke that &quot;we ranked fifth in a two-station town&quot;.

Under Krueger, the station cemented itself as the news ratings leader in Boise, with such public affairs programming as &quot;Viewpoint&quot;. As early as 1978, it was the &quot;undisputed ratings king&quot; in the market, well ahead of KBCI and KIVI. KTVB was the first Boise station to present an hour of local early evening news when it debuted the 5 p.m. newscast &quot;Idaho at Five&quot; in 1984, first with weekend morning news in 1992, The dominance in news ratings has continued; for instance, in November 2010, each of KTVB&#x27;s local newscasts had more viewers than their competition combined.

During this time, the station became known for long-tenured and popular local news personalities. Dee Sarton spent nearly 42 years with KTVB, most of that time anchoring &quot;Idaho at Five&quot; and other early evening newscasts; one of her co-anchors, Carolyn Holly, worked at channel 7 for nearly 34 years. Anchor Mark Johnson spent 30 years with the station, retiring in 2021. Larry Gebert was the station&#x27;s meteorologist for 30 years until his death in 2022.

KTVB added a 4 p.m. news hour in 2013. In 2020, the station debuted a local lifestyle program, the midday &quot;Idaho Today&quot;, and reformatted its weeknight 5 p.m. news as the interactive &quot;The 208&quot;. As of 2024, the station aired 30 hours a week of news and public affairs programming.

===Notable former-on air staff===
* Trace Gallagher – reporter and weekend news anchor, 1990–1992
* Michael Jenkins – weekend sports anchor, 1998
* Eric Johnson – weekend sports anchor, 1984–1986
* David Kerley – anchor, early 1980s
* Christi Paul – weekend morning anchor, 1990s
* Wayne Walker – host of outdoors show &quot;Incredible Idaho&quot;, 1994–1999

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The stations&#x27; signals are multiplexed:

=== Analog-to-digital conversion ===
KTVB began broadcasting a digital signal on UHF channel 26 on November 1, 2002. KTVB shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 7, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from channel 26 to channel 7 for post-transition operations. To solve issues some viewers had receiving the station, KTVB was authorized to increase its effective radiated power weeks after the switch.

<doc id="1327032" wikidata="Q5416020" url="?curid=1327032" title="Evansville BlueCats">
<text>The Evansville BlueCats were a professional indoor football team based in Evansville, Indiana. They were a member of the United Indoor Football Association (UIF). They debuted in 2003 as a member of the National Indoor Football League.

==Location==
Evansville is located along the Ohio River in southwest Indiana. The BlueCats played their home games at Roberts Municipal Stadium. The stadium seating capacity when configured for Evansville BlueCats football is 11,310.

==The name BlueCats==
According to the team, the proper and official way to spell the team name, Evansville BlueCats, was with a capital &quot;C&quot; in the word BlueCats. Evansville is a river city and the blue cat, part of the Catfish family, is the largest fish found in the Ohio River, often growing to over 100 pounds. Originally called the &#x27;Rivertown Mudcats&#x27; (before being announced), the team&#x27;s founder, Michael Arnold, changed the name to Evansville BlueCats to reflect that the blue cat is particularly known for its strength and endurance. The BlueCats mascot, T. D. Fiddler, was a giant, walking, kid-friendly catfish that resembled the BlueCats logo.

==History==
In 2001, Michael Arnold received NIFL franchise rights to build a team in Evansville, and after months of site surveys and putting together a business plan, Arnold went to the city for approval. The city wanted to see samples from the league, so Arnold and SMG Director Sandy Aaron went before the Evansville Parks and Rec. with video samples and letters from the NIFL. Local media jumped all over the concept and the word was quickly published making front page news. In early 2002, Arnold and League President Carolyn Shiver spent hours in the league ownership meetings, in Denver, attempting to get a &#x27;Short Field&#x27; variance for Roberts Stadium. They were successful and the Evansville Bluecats were due to kick off in March 2002, but Arnold and city officials felt that it was too quick as the funds had not been developed yet, so the kickoff was postponed until 2003. After months of working long hours and much planning, Arnold was able to secure a group of local investors and went to work on building the team. On March 23, 2003, the Evansville Bluecats kicked off indoor football in Roberts Stadium with a crowd of almost 9000 fans and 92 cheerleaders leading the chant &quot;BlueCats&quot;! In their inaugural season the Bluecats were led by Head Coach and Defensive Coordinator Avery Atadero, Offensive Coordinator John Hart, Offensive line coach Tim Shipp, and Defensive Line Coach Greg Myers. The franchise, after a tough year of growing pains, was sold to new owners in 2004 and was closed after year five in 2007.

==Fans – Booster Club==
The Evansville BlueCats Booster Club, also known as the “FinHeads”, were a unique organization within the ranks of the United Indoor Football family. The “FinHeads” were more than just a fan group, they were the only UIF Booster Club in the league that was registered with the government and was classified as a 501c non-profit organization. The Booster Club had a written Mission Statement and Code of By Laws, as well as a Board of Directors with elected officers. The Club raised their funds through membership dues, Booster Club sponsorships, and half pot drawings at BlueCats home games.

==Cheerleaders==
The Evansville BlueCats had three cheerleader/dance teams organized by age. The Baby Blues and Junior Blues were for children and the Evansville BlueCats professional cheerleading team was made up of adults. The adult cheerleaders won the NIFL &quot;Best Dance Team&quot; award in back-to-back seasons in 2003 and 2004, and were known around the league and around the country as one of the elite cheer/dance programs in minor league sports.

==The 2006 season==
In 2006, the Evansville BlueCats got off to a slow start (1-4) but rebounded in the second half of the season to win four of their last five games of the regular season and clinch a playoff berth for the second consecutive season. Evansville earned the #5 seed in the UIF playoffs. The team continued their late season surge in the playoffs and claimed an impressive 37-15 road win over the Omaha Beef in the first round. Evansville lost by only 6 points, 32-26, to the #1 seed and unbeaten Sioux Falls Storm in the UIF semi-finals. Sioux Falls went on to win the League Championship a week later.

==Team history==
John Hart took over as the head coach of the Evansville BlueCats prior to the 2006 season and led the team to their best season ever. Coach Hart was named as the UIF Coach of the Year &quot;Honorable Mention&quot; by the league following the 2006 season. Coach Hart also served as Head Coach in 2007.

<doc id="1327033" wikidata="Q5106801" url="?curid=1327033" title="Chris Harris (cricketer)">
<text>Chris Zinzan Harris (born 20 November 1969) is a former New Zealand cricketer who became, over the course of the 1990s, a folk-hero in New Zealand cricket. Harris was a member of the New Zealand team that won the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy.

A left-handed middle-order batsman and deliverer of right-arm slow-medium deliveries, Harris rescued the New Zealand team&#x27;s batting on numerous occasions and his deceptive looping bowling often restricted the run rates of opposition batting line-ups.

==Personal life==
Harris&#x27;s father Zin Harris was also a New Zealand international player, and his brother Ben Harris has played at first-class level. All three of these players share the family traditional name of &quot;Zinzan&quot;, also shared by a distant relation, former All Black Zinzan Brooke.

==Domestic career==
In first-class cricket Harris has played 128 matches and scored over 7000 runs at an average of over 45, including 13 centuries with a highest score of 251*. He has taken over 120 wickets at an average of 38, with best figures of 4/22. However, his test career was limited to just 23 Tests, where his average with the bat was only around 20, and he took only 16 wickets at 73 runs apiece.

In 2007 Harris played for Bacup in the Lancashire League and finished the season as the League&#x27;s highest wicket-taker with 82 at 13.08. Harris was the captain of the Indian Cricket League&#x27;s Hyderabad Heroes.

Harris is also a sensation at the indoor version of the game and represented Canterbury and New Zealand at will and is also involved in the coaching of Canterbury youth indoor cricket teams.

During the 2012–13 season, Harris played club cricket as a player/coach for Papatoetoe Cricket Club, Auckland, New Zealand.

Since the 2013–14 season, Harris has joined the Sydenham Cricket Club, Christchurch, New Zealand and was selected as the club&#x27;s Player of the Year. Harris became the Premier teams Player/Coach at the start of the 2014–15 season. In the 2015/16 season, Harris led the Sydenham Premier team to win their first 2 Day Championship title in 30 years, culminating in winning the Canterbury Metropolitan Cricket Association&#x27;s &quot;Men’s Club Cricket Player of the Year&quot; award.

Harris stepped down as Sydenham Player/Coach at the start of the 2019–20 season, being replaced by another former Black Cap Matthew Bell. Harris still played for the Premier team in the 1-Day competition.

==International career==
Harris&#x27;s biggest contribution to the game, however, is in the One Day International arena in 2004, Harris became the first New Zealand player to have played 250 ODIs, in a season in which he was also the first New Zealander to take 200 wickets, at an average of 37 and an economy rate of just 4.28. In these matches, he also scored over 4300 runs at an average of 29 and has over 90 catches in the field. Harris also has a reputation for his abilities as a close fielder, achieving many run-outs with accurate throwing from positions such as the square leg.

Harris had been a genuine pace bowler – albeit a wayward one – as a junior cricketer, but decided, under the watchful eye of a mentor John Bracewell, to sacrifice a few yards of pace for accuracy. His gentle looping swing bowling makes the batsman work hard, as the ball is less likely to speed to the boundary, and the deceptiveness of the ball&#x27;s speed often leaves them attempting to play the ball too early.

===Trivia===
Harris is currently second in the list of the world record for the most caught and bowled dismissals in ODIs with 29 just after Muttiah Muralitharan who has 35 dismissals in his career.

Chris Harris holds the record for scoring the most number of ODI runs when batting at number 7 position( 2130) and also he became the first man to score 2000+ ODI runs at number 7 position.

===Injury===
Unfortunately, Harris&#x27;s performance in his 250th match was curtailed by a serious shoulder injury, and for some time the future of his career was in doubt. In his early post-shoulder injury games, he was forced to remove the medium-slow from his repertoire and was decidedly less effective. Performances for the New Zealand A side in September 2005 were more promising, however, with several very economical performances against Sri Lanka A.

==After cricket==

Harris become one of many high-profile international cricketers to move to Zimbabwe to be involved in the country&#x27;s cricket, and was in charge of the national U-19 side. He also was a cricket commentator for Sky Sport and since 2023 has been part of SENZ cricket commentary team.

<doc id="1327038" wikidata="Q536741" url="?curid=1327038" title="Patrice Bergeron">
<text>Patrice Bergeron-Cleary (born July 24, 1985) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey centre who played 19 seasons in the National Hockey League, all with the Boston Bruins. He served as team captain from 2021 until his retirement in 2023. Bergeron played junior hockey with the Acadie–Bathurst Titan of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) for one full season before being selected 45th overall by the Bruins in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft. He made the immediate jump from junior to the NHL after his draft and joined the Bruins in the 2003–04 season. In international play, Bergeron competed for Canada and won gold medals at the 2004 World Championships, 2005 World Junior Championships, 2010 Winter Olympics, 2012 Spengler Cup, and 2014 Winter Olympics. Bergeron is a member of the Triple Gold Club after winning the Stanley Cup with Boston in 2011. He scored two goals, including the Stanley Cup-winning goal, in Game 7 against the Vancouver Canucks.

Known for his two-way abilities, Bergeron is a six-time winner of the Frank J. Selke Trophy, awarded annually to the NHL forward with the best defensive skills, the most in NHL history. His 12 nominations are also an NHL record. He is regarded as one of the premier two-way forwards in NHL history.

==Playing career==
===Minor hockey===
Bergeron grew up in his hometown of L&#x27;Ancienne-Lorette, Quebec, and was a Quebec Nordiques fan in his youth. Bergeron was mostly an A and AA player throughout his minor hockey days. He played in the 1998 and 1999 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournaments with a minor ice hockey team from Sainte-Foy, Quebec City. He was drafted in the fifth round of the 2001 QMJHL Draft out of AAA Bantam hockey with the Sainte-Foy Gouverneurs. The following year, he played A hockey for the Séminaire St-François Blizzard before reporting to the Acadie-Bathurst Titan of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League.

===Boston Bruins (2003–2023)===

====Beginnings (2003–2007)====
Bergeron was drafted 45th overall in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft by the Boston Bruins. During his rookie season, he was selected for the NHL YoungStars Game in Minnesota as part of the 2004 All-Star weekend. He finished his rookie season with 39 points in 71 games. His first NHL goal came versus the Los Angeles Kings on October 18, 2003, in a 4–3 Boston road victory. He would then score the overtime-winning goal in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Quarter-Finals against the rival Montreal Canadiens on April 9, 2004.

Due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Bergeron played for Boston&#x27;s minor league affiliate, the Providence Bruins of the American Hockey League (AHL), tallying 61 points in 68 games.

As the NHL resumed the following season, Bergeron led the Bruins with a career-high 31 goals and 73 points. He played the majority of the season with linemates Brad Boyes and newcomer Marco Sturm, who had been acquired in a trade that sent captain Joe Thornton to the San Jose Sharks in November 2005. Then Bruins general manager Mike O&#x27;Connell recalled in a June 2011 interview that the organization had decided to build the team around Bergeron instead of Thornton, preferring the former&#x27;s on- and off-ice character.

Playing under a defensive system employed by new head coach Dave Lewis, he recorded his second consecutive 70-point campaign in 2006–07 with 22 goals and 48 assists. He again played alongside Sturm and Boyes until the latter was traded late in the season. Bergeron was hampered the majority of the season by a nagging shoulder injury.

====Establishment, Stanley Cup title, two more Stanley Cup Finals, &quot;Perfection Line&quot; era (2007–2020)====
After recording three goals and four assists in the first ten games of the 2007–08 season, Bergeron suffered a season-ending head injury during a game on October 27, 2007. Checked from behind by Philadelphia Flyers defenceman Randy Jones, Bergeron hit his head on the end-boards, knocking him unconscious. He lay motionless on the ice for several minutes before being wheeled off on a stretcher and taken to Massachusetts General Hospital, where he was diagnosed with a broken nose and a grade-three concussion. Jones received a two-game suspension from the NHL. Bergeron made his first public statements regarding the injury on November 8, saying he would not take any legal action and that Jones had tried to contact him to apologize. On January 19, 2008, the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; reported Bergeron had been sent on vacation by then Bruins general manager Peter Chiarelli and that he would likely sit out for the remainder of the season as his recovery had regressed. In March 2008, Bergeron started preliminary on-ice practice with Bruins goaltender Manny Fernandez, who was himself recovering from knee surgery. He steadily progressed into full-contact practices in early-April, aiming for a playoff return against the Montreal Canadiens in the opening round; however, he was held back by team doctors. In June 2008, Bergeron was reported as being symptom-free during off-season training. He participated in the Bruins&#x27; summer development camp (typically for Bruins prospects) with Fernandez, before joining the Bruins&#x27; main training camp.

He returned to action with the Bruins for the team&#x27;s preseason opening game on September 22, 2008, against the Montreal Canadiens, an 8–3 victory played in Halifax, Nova Scotia. After the 2008–09 season began, on October 23, Bergeron scored his first goal since his concussion, in a 4–2 home loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs. Two months later, in a game against the Carolina Hurricanes on December 20, Bergeron collided with opposing defenceman (and future Bruin) Dennis Seidenberg, suffering another concussion. He lay face down on the ice while being attended to by team trainers and eventually left the ice under his own power. He was released from the hospital the day after the collision and placed on injured reserve. (Seidenberg and Bergeron later became teammates on the Bruins after a trade for Byron Bitz to the Florida Panthers in 2010 to acquire Seidenberg.) Bergeron returned after being sidelined for one month and completed the season with 39 points in 64 games. In the first round of the 2009 playoffs, Bergeron recorded his first career fighting major in an altercation with Montreal&#x27;s Josh Gorges.

In 2009–10, Bergeron scored 52 points (19 goals, 33 assists) and played in 73 games. During the 2010 playoffs, he scored four goals and added seven assists for 11 points in all 14 games as the Bruins upset the Buffalo Sabres in the first round before being defeated in seven games by the Philadelphia Flyers (despite initially having a 3–0 series lead at one point).

Halfway into the 2010–11 season, Bergeron scored his first career NHL hat-trick in a Bruins victory over the Ottawa Senators on January 11, 2011. Bergeron was named the NHL&#x27;s First Star of the Month and was twice named First Star of the Week in January 2011. Bergeron took a hit from Claude Giroux on May 6, in Game 4 of the second round in the 2011 playoffs against the Philadelphia Flyers, causing a mild concussion that kept Bergeron out of the first two games of the third round against the Tampa Bay Lightning before eventually returning to the lineup in game three to help the Bruins eventually defeat the fifth-seeded Lightning in seven games. On June 1, during Game 1 on the Stanley Cup Finals against the Presidents&#x27; Trophy-winning-Vancouver Canucks, Canucks&#x27; forward Alexandre Burrows allegedly bit Bergeron&#x27;s finger during a scrum. No penalty was called and the NHL did not fine or suspend Burrows because the alleged bite was not supported by any evidence except a video of Burrows biting Bergeron&#x27;s glove while his hand was still inside it and bite marks on Bergeron&#x27;s finger. The Bruins lost Games 1, 2, and 5 away by one goal, but won Games 3, 4, and 6 at home in one sided fashions, tying the series at three games apiece. On June 15, Bergeron scored two goals in Game 7 of the series (including the game and series winner) against Canucks goaltender Roberto Luongo in a 4–0 victory over a Canucks in the game and 4–3 victory in the series, as the Bruins captured their sixth Stanley Cup in franchise history and first since 1972 and overcoming a 3–2 series deficit in the process. Bergeron also became the 26th member of the Triple Gold Club. He is engraved on the Stanley Cup using his birth name, Patrice Bergeron-Cleary.

After the close of the 2012 playoffs, even with the defending Stanley Cup champion Bruins eliminated in the first round in seven games by the seventh-seeded Washington Capitals, Bergeron&#x27;s constant defensive efforts on the ice earned him the Frank J. Selke Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s top defensive forward for the 2011–12 season for the first time in his career.

After finishing second in Selke Trophy voting for the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season (only behind Chicago Blackhawks forward and captain Jonathan Toews), Bergeron turned in a heroic playoff performance in the 2013 playoffs which included the tying- and game-winning goals against the fifth-seeded Toronto Maple Leafs in Game 7 of Round 1, and the overtime winner in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the top-seeded Pittsburgh Penguins. Earlier in the third round series against the Penguins in game one on June 1, 2013, he and Evgeni Malkin fought at centre ice, leading to Malkin knocking off Bergeron&#x27;s helmet before they both threw off their gloves to fight. The two continued to throw blows even while referees attempted to separate them. Bergeron also became renowned in the hockey world for displaying his toughness when, in the Stanley Cup Finals against the Presidents&#x27; Trophy-winning Chicago Blackhawks where the Bruins lost in six games, he played through a punctured lung, separated shoulder, a broken rib and a broken nose.

The Bruins re-signed Bergeron to an eight-year, $52 million ($6.5 million per year) contract extension on July 12, 2013. In the following 2013–14 season, Bergeron reached the 30-goal mark for the second time in his career, achieving a total of 30 goals and 32 assists, and was a major factor as the Bruins won the Presidents&#x27; Trophy as the regular season champions. For his performance in the regular season, Bergeron was awarded his second career Frank J. Selke Trophy, as well as the NHL Foundation Player Award. He was named as the cover athlete for the &quot;NHL 15&quot; video game in the same ceremony.

Towards the end of the 2014–15 season, on February 23, 2015, in a game against the Chicago Blackhawks, Bergeron scored his 200th career goal on Hawks&#x27; goaltender Corey Crawford as the Bruins would clinch a 6–2 victory in the game. Bergeron, who has played his entire NHL career as a member of the Bruins since they drafted him in 2003 in the second round, became the 17th player in franchise history to score 200 or more career goals for the club. Despite the Bruins missing the 2015 playoffs by just two points in the league standings, Bergeron was awarded the Selke Trophy for the second straight season and third time altogether after being named a finalist for the fourth consecutive season and time in his career.

Despite the Bruins narrowly missing the playoffs again by having missed by just three points, Bergeron was named a finalist for the Selke Trophy for the fifth consecutive year after recording 32 goals, 36 assists and 68 points although the Selke Trophy would get awarded Los Angeles Kings forward Anže Kopitar.

Bergeron&#x27;s play during the 2016–17 season was hampered by a sports hernia that occurred at some time early in the season, but which was only revealed on April 25, 2017, after the Bruins were defeated in the first round of te 2017 playoffs in six games by the Ottawa Senators. Bergeron&#x27;s sports hernia was operated on May 8, and he was expected to be ready for the Bruins&#x27; training camp before the 2017–18 season began. Bergeron played 79 games with 21 goals, 32 assists and 53 points in the season with first line of him, Brad Marchand and David Pastrňák labeled as &quot;The Perfection Line&quot; by the media. Bergeron was awarded his fourth career Selke Trophy after being named a finalist for the sixth consecutive season and sixth time in his career altogether.

Near the halfway point of the 2017–18 season, on January 6, 2018, in a 7–1 home win for the Bruins over the Carolina Hurricanes, Bergeron scored four goals, including Bergeron&#x27;s first-ever NHL natural hat trick, bringing his scoring-point total (goals/assists combined) to 702 in his NHL career. Five games later, on January 18, Bergeron recorded the third hat-trick of his career (and second of the season) in a 5–2 win over the New York Islanders. After blocking an opposition shot with his right foot on February 24 against the hosting Toronto Maple Leafs, Bergeron discovered two days later he had broken a bone in his foot and would remain out of action for two weeks pending further evaluation of his foot fracture. By March 19, Bergeron had been able to start practicing his skating with the team. Bergeron was cleared to play in the Bruins road game against the Minnesota Wild on March 25, recording assists on each of the goals scored in the Bruins&#x27; 2–1 overtime win. Bergeron ended the season with 30 goals, 33 assists for 63 points in 64 games played and was named a finalist for the Selke Trophy for the seventh consecutive time in his career and seventh time altogether, which eventually went to Anže Kopitar of the Los Angeles Kings.

The 2018–19 season for the Bruins saw Bergeron achieve some impressive milestones in his NHL career: on December 22, 2018, Bergeron scored his 300th goal in a 5–2 win over the Nashville Predators on Predators goaltender Pekka Rinne. On February 5, 2019, Bergeron played in his 1,000th NHL game, all with the Bruins, scoring two goals in a 3–1 home ice win against the visiting New York Islanders By the late-season games of the 2018–19 season, Bergeron was set to break the 800-point milestone in his NHL career, which was achieved on March 16, with a goal that tied the game in the first period, leading to a 2–1 home-ice overtime Bruins win over the visiting Columbus Blue Jackets. On April 17, Bergeron was nominated for the Selke Trophy for an NHL-record eighth straight season which was eventually given to Ryan O&#x27;Reilly of the St. Louis Blues. Bergeron and the Bruins would eventually go on to the 2019 Stanley Cup Finals in which the Bruins lost in seven games to the St. Louis Blues, one win short from winning a second Stanley Cup.

On July 20, 2020, Bergeron was named a Selke finalist for a 9th consecutive season after helping the Bruins clinch the Presidents&#x27; Trophy as the best regular season team but the trophy ultimately went to Sean Couturier of the Philadelphia Flyers.

====Final years and captaincy (2020–2023)====
On January 7, 2021, Bergeron was named the captain of the Boston Bruins. Zdeno Chára, who had been the team&#x27;s captain since 2006–07, signed with the Washington Capitals two weeks earlier in December 2020.
At the end of the pandemic-shortened 2020–21 season, Bergeron ranked fourth on the Boston Bruins all-time scoring list with 917 total points (375 goals and 542 assists). At the time, he trailed only Ray Bourque, Johnny Bucyk and Phil Esposito. Just days before the June 9 elimination of the Bruins from the 2021 playoffs by the New York Islanders in six games in the second round, Bergeron was nominated as a candidate for the Frank J. Selke Trophy for the tenth straight season but the trophy was eventually given to Florida Panthers forward and captain Aleksander Barkov - However, Bergeron would instead win the Mark Messier Leadership Award for the 2020–21 season; for strong team leadership, and contributions to the general society.

It was not until the eighth game of the 2021–22 season on November 4, 2021, that Bergeron would register his first Bruins goal of the season. On that day, in a home game against the visiting Detroit Red Wings, Patrice scored only his second natural hat trick - and seventh hat trick overall - of his NHL career, as the foundation for a four-goal game by the Bruins team captain in a 5–1 defeat of the Red Wings. On April 28, 2022, against the Buffalo Sabres, Bergeron scored a hat trick for his 400th career goal. He became the fourth Bruins player ever to score 400 goals for one team, joining Johnny Bucyk (545), Phil Esposito (459), and Rick Middleton (402). The Bruins were eliminated in the first round of the 2022 playoffs by the Carolina Hurricanes. With the season marking the end of Bergeron&#x27;s contract, and in light of his age and history of injuries, there was considerable uncertainty as to whether he would continue with the team. He ruled out playing for any other team, saying he would either re-sign or retire. Bergeron was once again nominated for the Selke Trophy for the eleventh time, and it was announced on June 5, that he had won the award for the record-setting fifth time.

On August 8, 2022, Bergeron signed a one-year contract to return to the Bruins for his nineteenth season. Bergeron scored his 1,000th point in his NHL career on November 21, with an assist on a goal by longtime linemate Brad Marchand, in a 5–3 win over the Tampa Bay Lightning. In 2023, Bergeron beat his own record with a sixth Selke trophy win after being named a top three finalist for the twelfth time in his career and twelfth consecutive season. Bergeron helped the Bruins win the Presidents&#x27; Trophy as the best regular season team for 2022–23 before being defeated in 7 games in the first round of the 2023 playoffs by the eighth-seeded Florida Panthers after initially leading the series 3–1. This was widely regarded as one of the biggest playoff collapses in NHL history.

Bergeron announced his retirement from hockey on July 25, 2023, a day after his 38th birthday, having played nineteen seasons in the NHL.

==International play==






Following his rookie season in the NHL, Bergeron was selected to play for Canada at the 2004 World Championships in Prague. He scored one goal in his international debut and won his first gold medal with Canada.

The following year, Bergeron was chosen to the Canadian national junior team for the 2005 World Junior Championships in North Dakota. He was lent to the team from the Providence Bruins of the AHL, where he was playing due to the NHL lockout. Bergeron was eligible for the World Juniors the previous year as well but was not lent to the national team because he was playing in the NHL. He finished the tournament with 5 goals and 8 assists totalling 13 points over 6 games while playing on a line with Sidney Crosby and Corey Perry. He scored a goal in Canada&#x27;s 6–1 gold medal victory over Russia. He finished the tournament as the leading scorer to earn MVP and All-Star team honours. By helping Canada win gold at the tournament, he became the first player to win a men&#x27;s gold medal before winning at the junior level.

Bergeron made his second appearance at the World Championships in 2006 and was reunited on a line with World Junior teammate Sidney Crosby, to whom he finished second in tournament scoring with 14 points. Bergeron was once again invited to play for Canada in the 2007 World Championships. He declined, citing he wanted to recover from injuries suffered during the NHL season.

On December 30, 2009, Bergeron was selected to play for Canada for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver; he was the only player selected who did not receive an invitation to the selection camp earlier in the summer. Many commentators predicted Bergeron would play on a line with Crosby due to his previous experience with him at the World Juniors and World Championships, but he ended up as the 13th forward due to a groin injury incurred in Canada&#x27;s first game. He played primarily on the penalty kill and in defensive-zone faceoffs.

During the 2012–13 NHL lockout, Bergeron played for Lugano and competed for Canada at the 2012 Spengler Cup, along with teammate at the time, Tyler Seguin. Canada took gold in the event, and Bergeron scored the first goal in the first minute of a 7–2 Canada rout over Davos, and added three assists.

Bergeron won his second gold medal with Canada at the 2014 Winter Olympics and was a member of Canada&#x27;s championship team at the 2016 World Cup of Hockey, reunited on both occasions on a line with Sidney Crosby.

==Personal life==
Bergeron is the son of Gerard Cleary, a city foreman, and Sylvie Bergeron, a social worker. Bergeron is of both French-Canadian and Irish descent, by way of his father. Although his legal surname is Bergeron-Cleary, it was truncated to Bergeron for simplicity.

Bergeron and his wife Stephanie Bertrand have four children together: Zach, Victoria, Noah, and Felix.

<text>Jeff Maxwell (born Jeffrey Maxwell Knott) is an American film and television actor. He is perhaps best known for playing Pvt. Igor Straminsky, a recurring character in the television series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. He appeared in 83 episodes of the classic CBS comedy from 1973 to 1983, including the series finale &quot;Goodbye, Farewell and Amen&quot;, which aired February 28, 1983, and became the most-watched scripted broadcast in American history (a title it still holds) with over 121.6 million viewers and 50.1 million households tuning in.

Maxwell&#x27;s film debut was in the acclaimed 1974 Mel Brooks comedy film &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot;. He played one of the title character&#x27;s medical students. He was also featured in the 1977 sketch comedy film &quot;Kentucky Fried Movie&quot; in a solo scene titled &quot;Feel-A-Round.&quot; The box-office success was directed by John Landis and written by Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker, who subsequently wrote the classic film comedy, &quot;Airplane!&quot;. His television roles include guest appearances on hit television series such as ABC&#x27;s &quot;Eight is Enough&quot;, CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Waltons&quot; and &quot;House Calls&quot; and NBC&#x27;s &quot;CHiPs&quot;. He also hosted the short-lived game show &quot;Shopper&#x27;s Casino&quot; in the 1987–88 season. In 1997, his cookbook, inspired by years of playing a mess hall cook on &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, titled &quot;Secrets of the M*A*S*H Mess: The Lost Recipes of Private Igor&quot;, was published and he made an appearance on NBC&#x27;s Today Show to promote it.

Maxwell is a regular participant on the alt.tv.mash newsgroup where, along with series writer Larry Gelbart (up until Gelbart&#x27;s death in 2009), answers fan questions about the behind-the-scenes workings of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. Before he began his acting career on &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, Maxwell was one-half of a comedy team called &quot;Garrett &amp; Maxwell.&quot; They performed at clubs throughout the United States for seven years before parting ways. Maxwell (according to journalist Peter Palmiere) has been working on a video documentary about female judges and referees in the sport of boxing. Since September 2018, Maxwell has hosted a podcast called MASH Matters, which celebrates the classic television series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. He is joined on the podcast by co-host Ryan Patrick.
