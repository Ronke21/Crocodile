<text>Joseph Edward Klecko (born October 15, 1953) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive tackle in the National Football League (NFL), primarily with the New York Jets. He played college football for the Temple Owls and was a member of the Jets&#x27; famed &quot;New York Sack Exchange&quot;. Klecko was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2023.

==Early life and college==
Klecko was born on October 15, 1953, in Chester, Pennsylvania. Klecko played high school football at St. James Catholic High School for Boys in Chester under coach Joe Logue. After graduating, he was not offered a scholarship to any college and went to work for a trucking company. Before going to Temple, and playing under Hall of Fame college coach Wayne Hardin (the former Navy coach who coached two Heisman Trophy winners in Joe Bellino &#x27;60 and Roger Staubach &#x27;63), Klecko played semi-pro football for the Aston (Pennsylvania) Knights of the Seaboard Football League and kept his eligibility by playing under the assumed name &quot;Jim Jones&quot; from the fictional &quot;Poland University.&quot; 

Temple&#x27;s equipment manager saw Klecko play, and recommended Klecko to coach Hardin, who after seeing Klecko play one quarter offered him a scholarship. Klecko led the Temple Owls in tackles his last three seasons (1974–1976), twice making the All-East team and receiving All-American mention as a junior and senior. He was the ECAC&#x27;s Rookie of the Week on October 27, 1973, after Temple&#x27;s 31–8 victory over the University of Delaware Blue Hens, in which he had five sacks and 15 tackles. He was inducted into the Temple University Sports Hall of Fame in 1987. 

While there was no NCAA boxing, which the NCAA stopped sanctioning in 1960, there was a national club competition among college clubs. Klecko won two club boxing titles with Temple in the heavyweight division.

==Professional career==
Klecko was selected by the New York Jets in the sixth round (144th overall) of the 1977 NFL draft. Despite eight sacks by Klecko, his team went only 3–11 his first season. However, when he and Abdul Salaam were joined by Mark Gastineau and Marty Lyons on the Jets&#x27; defensive line, they formed one of the top defensive lines in the NFL, known as the &quot;New York Sack Exchange.&quot; The four combined for 66 sacks in 1981, including a league-leading 20.5 by Klecko, to lead the Jets to their first playoff game since 1969. Klecko was honored with his first All-Pro selection. In November 1981, Klecko, Gastineau, Salaam and Lyons were invited to ring the ceremonial opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, which served as the inspiration for their nickname.
Klecko appeared in only two regular season games for the Jets in 1982, rupturing the patella tendon in his right knee in the second game of the season against the New England Patriots. The Jets made the playoffs in 1982, losing the AFC Championship game to the Miami Dolphins. Klecko made 2 more appearances with the Jets during their playoff victories over the Cincinnati Bengals and Oakland Raiders.

Klecko moved from defensive end to defensive tackle in 1983, and was named to the Pro Bowl at his new position in 1983 and 1984. The Jets switched to a 3–4 defensive alignment in 1985, forcing Klecko to learn a new position, nose tackle. He led the Jets with 96 tackles and five forced fumbles, and tied for second with 7.5 sacks to earn his second All-Pro selection, and become the second player, after Frank Gifford, in professional football history to be selected to the Pro Bowl at three different positions. Klecko spent the 1986-87 offseason recovering from knee surgery. The knee hadn&#x27;t fully healed by the start of the 1987 season, and he was limited to only seven games. After the season, the Jets released Klecko. He played one more season with the Indianapolis Colts, who went 9–7 in 1988, including a 34–16 loss to the Jets. Following the season, Klecko retired due to chronic knee problems.

==Hall of Fame credentials==
Hall of Fame center Dwight Stephenson, in describing Klecko as a &quot;great defensive lineman&quot;, considered him one of the two best interior linemen he had ever faced. Hall of Fame tackle Anthony Muñoz said about Klecko, &quot;In my 13 seasons, Joe is right there at the top of the defensive ends I had to block, up there with Fred Dean, Lee Roy Selmon and Bruce Smith. Joe was the strongest guy I ever faced. He had perfect technique — hands in tight, great leverage. My second year, 1981, we went to Shea and beat the Jets, 31–30, but he was such an intense, smart player, I knew I was in a battle. He was the leader, the guy who kept that unit together.&quot;

Hall of Fame guard Joe DeLamielleure added that, &quot;You can&#x27;t think of his ten year period without him. I had to block Joe Greene and Merlin Olsen when I was playing and, believe me, Joe Klecko was equal to those two guys. If Joe Klecko had played one position for ten years, he&#x27;d have been considered one of the top two or three players at that position, whichever one it was. There&#x27;s not another player who went to the Pro Bowl at three different positions. You take a defensive end and put him at nose tackle and he&#x27;s just as good there, that&#x27;s a great player. We need to get Joe Klecko in the Hall of Fame.&quot;

On December 26, 2004, during a halftime ceremony, the Jets honored Klecko by retiring his #73 jersey. Klecko became just the third New York Jet to have his number retired, joining Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Namath and Hall of Fame wide receiver Don Maynard.

On August 16, 2010, during halftime of the New York Giants–Jets preseason game at the New Meadowlands Stadium, Klecko was inducted as a member of the inaugural class into the Jets&#x27; Ring of Honor.

In 2016, the Professional Football Researchers Association named Klecko to the PFRA Hall of Very Good Class of 2016.

On August 17, 2022, Klecko was announced as one of the three finalists nominated by the senior committee for induction in the 2023 Pro Football Hall of Fame class. 
On February 9, 2023, Klecko was announced as a Class of 2023 inductee to the National Football League&#x27;s Pro Football Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
The young Klecko converted a &#x27;55 Chevy into a dragster and had a job driving dump trucks and oversized tractor-trailer rigs. Even during the NFL off-seasons Klecko was wrestling the 18-wheelers. &quot;I once fought my way across the country carrying a propeller for a supertanker,&quot; he says. &quot;The thing weighed 130,000 pounds and was 22 feet across, wide as most roadways.&quot; His trucking job earned him cameo roles as trucker or strongman in four Burt Reynolds films: &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; (1977), &quot;Smokey and the Bandit II&quot; (1980), &quot;Cannonball Run&quot; (1981), &quot;Heat&quot; (1986).

Klecko and his wife, Debbie, currently reside in Colts Neck, New Jersey, and have five children, one of whom, Dan, was an NFL defensive tackle for the New England Patriots, Indianapolis Colts, and Philadelphia Eagles.

In 1993, Klecko was sentenced to three months in prison for perjury in an insurance fraud case.

In 2005, Klecko was involved in a fatal car accident, in which he accidentally struck and killed a pedestrian on the Major Deegan Expressway in Bronx, New York. Klecko was not charged or ticketed and was uninjured in the accident.

Klecko sells metal stairs in the Tri-State Area, and serves as a representative for various construction companies. He also appeared on EWTN &quot;Life On The Rock&quot; show. He is a member of Catholic Athletes for Christ and speaks on the subject of manhood and faith. Klecko was a guest on Blessed2Play hosted by Ron Meyer where he talked about his Catholic faith and career in the NFL.

In September 2010, SportsNet New York announced that Klecko would be the newest analyst on the New York Jets&#x27; post-game show.

<doc id="1323022" wikidata="Q2718408" url="?curid=1323022" title="1986 in video games">
<text>1986 saw many sequels and prequels in video games, such as &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot;, along with new titles such as &quot;Arkanoid&quot;, &quot;Bubble Bobble&quot;, &quot;Castlevania&quot;, &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, &quot;Ikari Warriors&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, &quot;Metroid&quot;, &quot;Out Run&quot; and &quot;R.B.I. Baseball&quot;. The year&#x27;s highest-grossing arcade video games were &quot;Hang-On&quot; in Japan, &quot;Hang-On&quot; and &quot;Gauntlet&quot; in the United States, and &quot;Nemesis&quot; (&quot;Gradius&quot;) in London. The year&#x27;s bestselling home system was the Nintendo Entertainment System (Famicom) for the third year in a row, while the year&#x27;s best-selling home video games in Western markets were &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; in the United States and &quot;Yie Ar Kung-Fu&quot; in the United Kingdom.

Video game developer Masahiro Sakurai considers 1986 the most incredible year for the video game industry. He cited the release of several games that were the beginning of popular and long-lasting franchises such as &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, &quot;Castlevania&quot;, and &quot;Kunio-kun&quot;. He attributed their release to new hardware like the Famicom Disk System and megabit ROMs that afforded developers with greater memory storage, which allowed for more creative possibilities. Sakurai noted that the better games in the competitive market generated more appeal.

==Financial performance==
In the United States, the home video game industry recovered with the arrival of the third generation of video game consoles led by the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).

<text>The Day of Atonement, October 16, was established during the Million Man March in Washington, DC, on October 16, 1995 by the Nation of Islam.

==Premise==
The Day of Atonement is one on which American black men would refrain from crime, drug addiction, and family abuse. During the rally, Louis Farrakhan recited the following pledge and asked all men present to repeat after him and take the pledge.

==The Pledge==

I PLEDGE that from this day forward I will strive to love my brother as I love myself. I, from this day forward, will strive to improve myself spiritually, morally, mentally, socially, politically and economically for the benefit of myself, my family and my people. I pledge that I will strive to build businesses, build houses, build hospitals, build factories and enter into international trade for the good of myself, my family and my people.

I PLEDGE that from this day forward I will never raise my hand with a knife or a gun to beat, cut, or shoot any member of my family or any human being except in self-defense. I pledge from this day forward I will never abuse my wife by striking her, disrespecting her, for she is the mother of my children and the producer of my future. I pledge that from this day forward I will never engage in the abuse of children, little boys or little girls for sexual gratification. For I will let them grow in peace to be strong men and women for the future of our people.

I WILL never again use the ‘B word’ to describe any female. But particularly my own Black sister. I pledge from this day forward that I will not poison my body with drugs or that which is destructive to my health and my well-being. I pledge from this day forward I will support Black newspapers, Black radio, Black television. I will support Black artists who clean up their acts to show respect for themselves and respect for their people and respect for the ears of the human family. I will do all of this so help me God.

<text>Stanisław Michał Ernest Denhoff (; ; 1673 – 2 August 1728) was a Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth aristocrat, Grand Master of the Hunt of Lithuania (from 1697), Grand Chorąży of the Crown (1704–1721), voivode of Połock (1721–1728), politician and a military commander (Field Hetman of Lithuania, 1709–1728).

He was a Starost of numerous territories (nowokorczyński, kałuski, kościerski, lubocheński, mozyrski, latowicki, lucyński, zydekański).

==Biography==

He was born a member of the Denhoff family, a Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth noble family of the Baltic German origin (the German family name was Dönhoff). His place of birth was Kościerzyna (Berent), Poland, in the region of Royal Prussia.

He was Grand Master of the Hunt of Lithuania since 1697. He was one of the organizers and a marshal of the Sandomierz Confederation in 1704, which supported the election of Augustus II the Strong (Augustus II of Poland) to the Polish throne. In recognition of his support he became a Grand Chorąży of the Crown in 1704, and a knight of the Order of the White Eagle, that honor awarded to him in 1705 by Augustus II. He remained an Augustus&#x27; supporter even during his short abdication, and after his return, he received further royal favors. In 1709 he received the office of the Field Hetman of Lithuania. That year, he was also one of the participants of the Battle of Poltava. In 1710 he served as the Sejm Marshal and presided over the General Council of Warsaw that confirmed Augustus II as the king. He also served as the Marshal of the Sejms on 5–19 April 1712 and 31 December 1712 – 21 February 1713 in Warsaw. In 1717 however he joined the opposition against Augustus, dissatisfied with the resolutions of the Sejm Niemy which reduced the power of the hetmans. He was the voivode of the Połock Voivodship since 1721.

He died on 2 August 1728, and was buried in Częstochowa.

==Marriage and issue==
Stanisław Michał married Joanna Denhoffówna h. Denhof in 1709 and Countess Maria Zofia Sieniawska h. Leliwa in 1724 and had one daughter:

* Konstancja Denhoff (died 1791), married Józef Rogaliński h. Łodzia and Prince Janusz Aleksander Sanguszko h. Lis in 1731

<text>Framingham State University (Framingham State or FSU) is a public university in Framingham, Massachusetts. The university, then known as the Normal School in Lexington was founded in 1839 as the first state-supported normal school in the United States before becoming a full-fledged university. It offers undergraduate programs as well as graduate programs, including MBA, MEd, and MS.

==History==

As the first secretary of the newly created Board of Education in Massachusetts, Horace Mann instituted school reforms that included the creation of an experimental normal school, the first one in the United States, in Lexington, in July 1839. The initial name of the school was the Normal School in Lexington. Cyrus Peirce was its first principal or president. A second normal school was opened in September 1839 in West Barre (the school later moved to Westfield) followed by Bridgewater State College the next year. Growth forced the first normal school&#x27;s relocation to West Newton in 1843, where it was firstly named the Normal School in West Newton before changing again to the State Normal School in West Newton two years later in 1845.

The school would last in West Newton for only ten years before moving to its present site on Bare Hill in Framingham in 1853. At this time, the school became the State Normal School in Framingham. Nevertheless, the school would change its name two more times in its first decades in Framingham, becoming Framingham Normal School in 1865 and Framingham State Normal School in 1889. In 1922, the school granted its first Bachelor of Science in Education degrees in conjunction with its adoption of a four-year study program. Ten years later all Massachusetts&#x27; normal schools were renamed state teachers colleges, with degreed teachers predominating its graduating classes; the school thus became the State Teachers College at Framingham. This name, however, would last only until 1945 when it was slightly adjusted to the Framingham State Teachers College.

In 1960, the name changed yet again to the State College at Framingham after Bachelor of Arts degrees were added. This name was slightly adjusted five years later to just Framingham State College, the name it would subsequently take into the twenty first century. In subsequent years, Masters&#x27; of Education, Arts, and Science degrees were added as well, remaining a part of the school&#x27;s curriculum today. In 2007, the college began offering the Master&#x27;s of Business Administration (MBA) degree. In October 2010, seven of the state colleges became state universities, unaffiliated with the University of Massachusetts system; at this time, the school adopted its current name: Framingham State University. The measure was signed into law by Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick on July 28, 2010.

==Campus==
The campus is located in Framingham, Massachusetts. Seven residence halls house over 1,500 students. The Henry Whittemore Library has over 200,000 volumes, Wi-Fi, access to over 70,000 electronic journals, and includes Archives and Special Collections. Framingham State University is located on the high Bare Hill (also known as Normal Hill) and provides views of Boston, Massachusetts away.

===Sustainability===
In 2007, the school signed the American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment. That year, Massachusetts issued Executive Order No. 484, which mandated reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption for all state agencies and institutions. Greenhouse gases must be reduced 80% by 2050. In 2010, the school adopted a plan to convert its heating plant to natural gas and to
convert its central chilled water plant to electric chillers.

Framingham State University was named a &quot;Green College&quot; by the Princeton Review in 2010 and 2011. It was one of 22 schools in Massachusetts to receive the distinction, and one of 311 nationwide. It was named to the list again in 2013.

==Organization==

Framingham State University is led by an eleven-member Board of Trustees. The governor appoints nine trustees to five-year terms, renewable once. The Framingham State University Alumni Association elects one trustee for a single five-year term. Finally, the student body elects one student trustee for a one-year term. In addition to five full board meetings each year, which are open to the public, the board also meets in standing committees.

The university&#x27;s annual budget is $105 million, and the school has 775 full and part-time employees. Framingham State University is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.

==Student life==
Framingham State University has an Office of Student Involvement and Leadership Development and a Center for Inclusive Excellence. It has a relatively small campus which sits on roughly . Framingham State University also owns and operates a radio station WDJM-FM on 91.3 FM.

<doc id="1323035" wikidata="Q444316" url="?curid=1323035" title="Griefer">
<text>A griefer or [[bad-faith]] player is a player in a multiplayer video game who deliberately annoys, disrupts, or trolls others in ways that are not part of the intended gameplay. Griefing is often accomplished by killing players for sheer fun, destroying player-built structures, or stealing items. A griefer derives pleasure from the act of annoying other users, and as such, is a nuisance in online gaming communities.

==History==
The term &quot;griefing&quot; was applied to online multiplayer video games by the year 2000 or earlier, as illustrated by postings to the rec.games.computer.ultima.online USENET group. The player is said to cause &quot;grief&quot; in the sense of &quot;giving someone grief&quot;.

The term &quot;griefing&quot; dates to the late 1990s, when it was used to describe the willfully antisocial behaviors seen in early massively multiplayer online games like &quot;Ultima Online,&quot; and later, in the 2000s, first-person shooters such as &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;. Even before it had a name, griefer-like behavior was familiar in the virtual worlds of text-based Multi-User Domains (MUDs), where joyriding invaders inflicted &quot;virtual rape&quot; and similar offenses on the local populace. Julian Dibbell&#x27;s 1993 article &quot;A Rape in Cyberspace&quot; analyzed the griefing events in a particular MUD, LambdaMOO, and the staff&#x27;s response.

In the culture of massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) in Taiwan, such as &quot;Lineage&quot;, griefers are known as &quot;white-eyed&quot;—a metaphor meaning that their eyes have no pupils and so they look without seeing. Behaviors other than griefing that can cause players to be stigmatized as &quot;white-eyed&quot; include cursing, cheating, stealing, or unreasonable killing.

==Methods==

Methods of griefing differ from game to game. What might be considered griefing in one area of a game, may even be an intended function or mechanic in another area. Common methods may include but are not limited to:

*Intentional friendly fire, or deliberately performing actions detrimental to other team members&#x27; game performance in primarily shooter games.
**Wasting or destroying key game elements
**Colluding with opponents
**Giving false information
**Giving information about your team&#x27;s whereabouts to an enemy team
**Faking extreme incompetence with the intent of hurting teammates, or failing an in-game objective
**Deliberately blocking shots from a player&#x27;s own team, or blocking a player&#x27;s view by standing in front of them, so they cannot damage the enemy
**Trapping teammates in inescapable locations by using physics props, special abilities, or teleportation
**Intentionally killing oneself
*Actions undertaken to waste other players&#x27; time.
**Playing as slowly as possible
**Trapping and imprisoning players for extended periods of time to deny their ability to play on a server.
**Hiding from an enemy when there is no tactical benefit in doing so
**If a game interface element has no time limit, leaving their computer (going &quot;AFK&quot;), potentially forcing the other players to leave the game (which may incur a penalty for leaving), like &quot;Among Us&quot;.
**Constantly pausing the game, or lowering its speed as much as possible, in the hopes that their target quits in frustration
**Standing on top of important NPCS to block other players from interacting with them.
**A powerful player entering an area intended for lower-level or less experienced players and using up or hogging otherwise available limited resources, as can be sometimes seen in MMORPGs or grinding-based games
*Causing a player disproportionate loss or reversing their progress.
**Destroying or vandalizing other players&#x27; creations without permission in sandbox games like &quot;Minecraft&quot; and &quot;Terraria&quot;
**Driving vehicles backward around lapped courses in multiplayer racing games, often done with the intent of crashing head-on into whoever is in first place
*Using exploits (taking advantage of bugs in a game).
**Illegally exiting a map&#x27;s boundaries to prevent the enemy team from winning
**In a co-op or multiplayer game, destroying or otherwise denying access to items, which without, other players cannot finish the game
*Purposeful violation of server rules or guidelines.
**Impersonation of administrators or other players through similar screen names
**Written or verbal insults, including false accusations of cheating or griefing
* Abusing the in game reporting system with mass reports to trigger a bot to automatically ban another player.
*Spamming a voice or text chat channel to inconvenience, harass, or annoy other players.
*Uploading offensive or explicit images to profile pictures, in-game sprays, or game skins.
*Kill stealing, denying another player the satisfaction or gain of killing a target that should have been theirs.
*Camping at a corpse or spawn area to repeatedly kill players as they respawn (when players have no method of recourse to prevent getting killed), preventing them from being able to play. Camping can also refer to continuously waiting in a tactically advantageous position for others to come to them; this is sometimes considered griefing because if all players do it, the game stalls, but this is now more commonly considered a game design issue, and in games where you need to defeat someone, like a juggernaut, it is more likely for that juggernaut to camp.
*Acting out-of-character in a role-play setting to disrupt the serious gameplay of others. 
*Luring many monsters or a single larger monster to chase the griefer, before moving to where other players are. The line of monsters in pursuit looks like a train, and hence this is sometimes called &quot;training&quot; or &quot;&quot;.
*Blocking other players so they cannot move to or from a particular area, or access an in-game resource (such as a non-player character); the game &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s The Division&quot; was found to have a serious problem with this at launch, where griefers could stand in the doorway out of the starting area, trapping players in the spawn room.
*Intentionally attempting to crash a server through lag or other means (such as spawning large amounts of resource-demanding objects), in order to cause interference among players.
*Smurfing, the process of creating extra accounts and deliberately losing games to enter a lower skill rank than is appropriate, before playing at full skill against lower-ranked opponents, thus defeating them easily.
*High-skill players deliberately losing in matches against low-skill players (usually due to shortage of players), causing the low-skill player&#x27;s skill rating to artificially rise so that they will be routinely pitted against opponents they have no chance of winning against in the future.
*Impersonating an enemy to trick someone into attacking the griefer, so that a player is flagged as having attacked the griefer. A notable example of this is early on in &quot;Ultima Online&quot;, where players had a scroll that could change their appearance to that of a monster, with the only way to tell the difference between them and a real monster is to click on them and read their name. Attacking a monster disguised griefer would flag the player as a murderer, causing the town guard to kill the player.
*Starting a vote to kick someone in hopes of others blindly agreeing in doing so, so that the griefer stays in the server with no consequences while tricking others to get rid of the innocent person.

The term is sometimes applied more generally to refer to a person who uses the internet to cause distress to others as a prank, or to intentionally inflict harm, as when it was used to describe an incident in March 2008, when malicious users posted seizure-inducing animations on epilepsy forums.

==Industry response==
Many subscription-based games actively oppose griefers, since their behavior can drive away business. It is common for developers to release server-side upgrades and patches to annul griefing methods. Many online games employ gamemasters that reprimand offenders. Some use a crowdsourcing approach, where players can report griefing. Malicious players are then red-flagged, and are then dealt with at a gamemaster&#x27;s discretion. As many as 25% of customer support calls to companies operating online games deal specifically with griefing.

Blizzard Entertainment has enacted software components to combat griefing. To prevent non-consensual attacks between players, some games such as &quot;Ultima Online&quot; have created separate realms for those who wish to be able to attack anyone at any time, and for those who do not. Others implemented separate servers.

When &quot;EverQuest&quot; was released, Sony included a PvP switch where people could fight each other only if they had enabled that option. This was done in order to prevent the player-killing that was driving people away from &quot;Ultima Online&quot;, which at that time had no protection on any of its servers.

&quot;Second Life&quot; bans players for harassment (defined as being rude or threatening, making unwelcome sexual advances, or performing activities likely to annoy or alarm somebody) and assault (shooting, pushing, or shoving in a safe area, or creating scripted objects that target another user and hinder their enjoyment of the game) in its community standards. Sanctions include warnings, suspension from &quot;Second Life&quot;, or being banned altogether.

&quot;Eve Online&quot; has incorporated activities typically considered griefing into the gameplay mechanisms. Corporate spying, theft, scams, gate-camping, and PvP on non-PvP players are all part of the gaming experience. This does not mean that the developers are indifferent to the negative effect that these activities may have on players, it is simply their choice with regards to the culture and atmosphere that they intended for the game. Players are advised to approach unfamiliar situations in the game with an appropriate level of caution, develop strategies to deal with the presence of these elements, and take personal responsibility for their in-game actions. Certain activities are allowed by the developers, but are still considered illegal in the game itself and result in in-game consequences, such as the unavoidable loss of the attacker&#x27;s ship when engaging in combat with a non-allowed target in high-security space.

Shooters such as &quot;Counter Strike: Global Offensive&quot; have implemented peer review systems, where if a player is reported too many times, multiple higher ranked players are allowed to review the player and determine if the reports are valid, and apply a temporary ban to the player&#x27;s account if necessary. The player&#x27;s name is omitted during the replay, as well as those of the other 9 players in the game. In October 2016, Valve implemented a change that will permanently ban a player if they receive two penalties for griefing.

Many &quot;Minecraft&quot; servers have rules against griefing. In &quot;Minecraft&quot; freebuild servers, griefing is often the destruction of another player&#x27;s build, and in other servers the definition ranges, but almost all servers recognize griefing as harassment. Most servers use temporary bans for minor and/or first-time incidents, and indefinite bans from the server for more serious and/or repeat offences. While many servers try to fight this, other servers, like 2b2t, allow griefing as part of the gameplay.

By the early 2020s, &quot;Grand Theft Auto Online&quot; has experienced a drastic increase in griefing, due in part to the emergence of bugs and better money-making opportunities. Common griefing techniques within the game abuse passive mode and trivially accessible weaponized vehicles. Developer Rockstar has implemented measures such as a longer cool-down on passive mode, patching invincibility glitches, and removing passive mode from weaponized vehicles in recent updates. In addition, the game also features a reputation system that, in effect, after excessive &quot;bad sport point&quot; accumulation, will mark players as &quot;bad sports&quot;, allowing them to only play in lobbies with other &quot;bad sports&quot;. Such points are either accumulated over time or gained within a certain time frame and are acquired by actions such as destroying another player&#x27;s personal vehicle, or quitting jobs early. This is one of the more controversial features of the game, as some point out flaws such as the game not considering if destruction of a vehicle was self-defense.

Bethesda Softworks Games, a division of ZeniMax Media Inc., has a clear code of conduct that does not allow griefing, as indicated in section 3.2. Whether this has any effect is debatable, with numerous forum posts about ongoing griefing behaviour. Because the boilerplate response to generating a ticket about such a player, contains the clause &quot;Please note, to protect individual privacy, we do not disclose the outcome of our investigation.&quot;, there is unfortunately no transparency to indicate whether violations to the code of conduct (by griefing) are taken seriously by Bethesda/ZeniMax.

&quot;Fallout 76&quot; attempted to discourage players from griefing by marking them as wanted criminals, which one can get a reward for killing. Wanted players cannot see any other players on the world map, and must rely on their normal player view. However, this has instead become another mechanism to engage in griefing, by luring other players into PvP, in which they largely have no chance to survive because of the perk loadout and weapons used by the griefer. An example of this is by breaking resource locks in a player camp, which will make the griefer wanted, with the hope that the camp owner will find them to retaliate, and thereby initiate PvP with the griefer.

<doc id="1323044" wikidata="Q841321" url="?curid=1323044" title="Levallois technique">
<text>The Levallois technique () is a name given by archaeologists to a distinctive type of stone knapping developed around 250,000 to 400,000 years ago during the Middle Palaeolithic period. It is part of the Mousterian stone tool industry, and was used by the Neanderthals in Europe and by modern humans in other regions such as the Levant.

It is named after 19th-century finds of flint tools in the Levallois-Perret suburb of Paris, France. The technique was more sophisticated than earlier methods of lithic reduction, involving the striking of lithic flakes from a prepared lithic core. A striking platform is formed at one end and then the core&#x27;s edges are trimmed by flaking off pieces around the outline of the intended lithic flake. This creates a domed shape on the side of the core, known as a tortoise core, as the various scars and rounded form are reminiscent of a tortoise&#x27;s shell. When the striking platform is finally hit, a lithic flake separates from the lithic core with a distinctive plano-convex profile and with all of its edges sharpened by the earlier trimming work.

This method provides much greater control over the size and shape of the final flake which would then be employed as a scraper or knife although the technique could also be adapted to produce projectile points known as Levallois points. Scientists consider the Levallois complex to be a Mode3 technology, as a result of its diachronic variability. This is one level superior to the Acheulean complex of the Lower Paleolithic.

==Origins==
The technique is first found in the Lower Palaeolithic but is most commonly associated with the Neanderthal Mousterian industries of the Middle Palaeolithic. In the Levant, the Levallois technique was also used by anatomically modern humans during the Middle Stone Age. In North Africa, the Levallois technique was used in the Middle Stone Age, most notably in the Aterian industry to produce very small projectile points. While Levallois cores do display some variability in their platforms, their flake production surfaces show remarkable uniformity. As the Levallois technique is counterintuitive, teaching the process is necessary and thus language may be a prerequisite for such technology, although Ohnuma, Aoki and Akazawa (1997) found modern humans could be taught the Levallois technique non-verbally at a similar level of effectiveness to verbal teaching.

==Evolution==
The distinctive forms of the flakes were originally thought to indicate a wide-ranging Levallois culture resulting from the expansion of archaic &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; out of Africa. However, the wide geographical and temporal spread of the technique has rendered this interpretation obsolete. Adler &quot;et al.&quot; further argue that Levallois technology evolved independently in different populations and thus cannot be used as a reliable indicator of Paleolithic human population change and expansion. Aside from technique, the overarching commonality in Levallois complexes is the attention given to maximizing core efficiency. Lycett and von Cramon-Taubedel (2013) measured variability in shape and geometrics relationships between cores over multiple regions, with an outcome that suggests a tendency for knappers to choose planforms with a specific surface morphology. In other words, they conclude that Levallois knappers cared less about the overall outline or shape of their core and more about the striking surface, evidence of complex pre-planning and recognition of an &quot;ideal form&quot; of Levallois core. A recent article by Lycett and Eren (2013) statistically shows the efficiency of the Levallois technique which at times has been called into question. Lycett and Eren created 75 Levallois flakes from 25 Texas Chert nodules. They counted the 3957 flakes and separated them into four stages in order to show efficiency, which grew subsequently in each stage. Based on the comparative study of 567 debitage flakes and 75 preferential Levallois flakes, Lycett and Eren found out the thickness is more evenly distributed and less variable across preferential Levallois flakes, which indicates the thickness is an important factor for efficiency and retouch potential. The experiment also shows that the Levallois core is an economic optimal strategy of raw material (lithic) usage, which means it can generate longest cutting edge per weight unit of raw material. This result also implies that the mobility of prehistoric people was higher when applying Levallois technology; prehistoric people may explore more area with Levallois cores, which can make longer cutting edge than the other flake-making technique under same amount of cores, and no need to worry about the lack of raw material to make tools.

===Defining Levallois===

There is disagreement when it comes to defining Levallois technology. Archeologists question which attributes and dimensions are specifically associated with Levallois, and argue that there are other techniques with similar cosmetic and functional aspects. Due to these disagreements, there is now a more precise set of criteria that outlines Levallois technology from a geometric standpoint. These criteria are:
# Exploitation of the volume of raw material is organized in terms of two intersecting planes, or flaking surfaces; 
# The two surfaces are hierarchically related, one constituting the striking platform and the other the primary reduction surface; 
# The primary reduction surface is shaped such that the morphology of the product is pre-determined, which is fundamentally a function of the lateral and distal convexities of the surface; 
# The fracture plane for removing primary products is sub-parallel to the plane of intersection of the two surfaces; and 
# The striking platform size and shape is adjusted to allow removal of flakes parallel to this plane, usually through retouch or faceting.

==Locations==
===Africa===
* Kenya: Large Levallois flakes struck from boulder cores have been found at the Kapthurin Formation site in western Kenya, near Lake Bogoria and Lake Baringo. The earliest examples come from the Leaky Handaxe Area and the Factory Site. Both examples feature large flakes, approximately 10–20 cm in diameter, and have been reliably dated to 400 thousand years ago.
* Morocco: At Jebel Irhoud, a former barite mine located 100 km west of Marrakesh, Levallois tools have been found. Dated as approximately 315,000 years old in 2017, the finds were highly significant to the understanding of both the development of this technique and early humans. John McNabb, archaeologist at the University of Southampton said of this: &quot;The tools the people at Jebel Irhoud were making were based on a knapping technique called Levallois, a sophisticated way of shaping stone tools. The date of 315,000 years ago adds to a growing realisation that Levallois originates a lot earlier than we thought. Is Jebel Irhoud telling us that this new technology is linked to the emergence of the hominin line that will lead to modern humans? Does the new find imply there was more than one hominin lineage in Africa at this time? It really stirs the pot.&quot;
* Egypt: Within the banks of the Nile River, excavations have located Levalloisean implements within the 30-, 15-, and 10-foot terraces. Within the 30-foot terrace, the implements were originally thought to be early Mousterian, but were later reclassified. The 15- and 10-foot terraces again were classified first as Egyptian Mousterian, but later as developed Levalloisean.

===Asia===
* Syria/Israel: Excavated within a stratigraphic column containing tools from this culture.
* India: the open-air stratified prehistoric site of Attirampakkam, India, has shown that processes signifying the end of the Acheulian culture and the emergence of a Middle Palaeolithic culture occurred at 385 ± 64 thousand years ago. (ka)
* Iran: Levallois products have been discovered in Middle Paleolithic sites of the Zagros region including Bisitun cave, Warwasi, Darai, Kunji, Do-Ashkaft. There are a number of Middle Paleolithic sites in Central Iran that yielded Levallois flakes and blades including Mirak, Niasar, and Parvadeh.
* Afghanistan: Implements located in the Haibak valley.
* North-east Asia: The extension of the Levallois method to this part of the world now seems undoubtable with recent evidence at Shuidonggou (Northern China) in Mongolia and Altai-Siberia, dating from the Late Pleistocene.
* Hong Kong: Wong Tei Tung in Sai Kung located in the east New Territories.
* Pakistan: The Soanian techno-complex from the Soan Valley located in northern Pakistan, has been identified as a Mode-3 Levallois complex.
*China: Evidence of Levallois technology from the lithic assemblage of the Guanyindong Cave site in southwest China, dated to approximately 170,000–80,000 years ago, is presented by Hu &quot;et al.&quot; (2018). The first discovered blade site in China was in Shuidonggou in 1923 by Vincent and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. When they excavated the location, twelve localities were founded and had an age range of roughly 40,000–10,000 BP. Out of the twelve localities, SDG1 proved to be most important with the discovery of numerous unique, elongated blanks and Levallois-like cores found.

===Southern Caucasus===
* Armenia: Nor Geghi: one archaeological site. The artifacts, found preserved in soil under a later lava flow and dated at 325,000–335,000 years old, were a mix of two distinct stone tool technology traditions: bifacial tools and Levallois tools. Daniel Adler suggests that the coexistence of bifacial and Levallois tools at the site provides the first clear evidence that local populations developed Levallois technology out of existing bifacial technology, and that the artifacts found at Nor Geghi reflect the technological flexibility and variability of a single population. He further concludes that this challenges the view that technological change resulted from population change, and suggests instead that Levallois technology developed independently from existing technology within different human populations who shared a common technological ancestry.

<doc id="1323048" wikidata="Q245700" url="?curid=1323048" title="Cylinder chess">
<text>Cylinder chess (or cylindrical chess) is a chess variant. The game is played as if the board were a cylinder, with the left side of the board joined to the right side. Cylinder chess is one of six chess variants described by the Arabic historian Ali al-Masudi in 947.

The cylindrical board is used in some chess problems.
== Rules and gameplay ==

The game is played as if the left and right sides of the board are connected. When a piece goes off one edge of the board, it reappears from the other edge. For example, it is legal to move a rook from a3 to h3, even if there is a piece on b3, since the rook can move left from a3; a bishop on c1 can move to h4 by going from c1 to a3, and then going up and left from a3 to h4; if White has a pawn on a5, Black has a pawn on h7 and Black plays 1...h7–h5, White can capture the black pawn &quot;en passant&quot; with 2.axh6; and so on.

Castling can be handled in one of three ways:
* Castling is allowed, but not with a rook over the board edge. This maintains the options for castling available in standard chess.
* Castling is not allowed. Proponents of this convention argue that cylinder chess nullifies the purpose of castling, as all files are equally dangerous on a cylindrical board.
* In addition to normal castling, castling with a rook over the board edge is also allowed. This is done by moving the king two squares toward the rook and moving the rook to the square that the king passed over (in the same manner as usual).

One possible rule variation in cylinder chess is to allow &quot;null moves&quot;, or moves such that every piece stays in the same place, as long as any piece performing such a move travels a nonzero distance by crossing over the edge of the board; only a rook or queen can perform such a move. This variation is rare in actual play, but it is often seen in cylinder chess problems.
==Strategy== 

In cylinder chess, the traditional hierarchy of piece strengths is changed, with bishops being significantly stronger than knights. The knight and rook do not gain much more power from the cylindrical board, but bishops and especially queens become stronger. The center squares are unimportant to control, and moving a pawn to the center in the opening is very weakening because it opens the player&#x27;s center to attacks by the opponent&#x27;s bishops, which have been allowed faster access to the flank squares.

Cylinder chess also has different endgames than standard chess. For example, unlike in standard chess, a king and rook cannot force checkmate against a lone king on the cylindrical board. Additionally, two rooks cannot deliver a ladder mate against an opposing lone king along the files as the latter would wrap around to the other side (but are still able to do so on the ranks).

Piece values according to H. G. Muller are as follows:

== In chess problems ==
The diagram shows a cylinder chess problem that allows null moves. The move 1.Rg4, threatening 2.Rg5#, fails due to 1...Ka5. The solution is to put Black in zugzwang by playing 1.Rh4, moving the rook on h4 to its own square; then, after either 1...Ka5 or 1...c4, 2.R4h5# is mate.
== Related variants ==
In horizontal cylinder chess, the first and last ranks of the chessboard are connected. In toroidal chess, the board has the form of a torus (donut shape). A toroidal board can be formed by connecting the first and last ranks of the cylindrical board.

Horizontal cylinder chess and toroidal chess, unlike cylinder chess, cannot use the starting position of standard chess; otherwise, both kings will begin the game in checkmate. The adjacent diagram shows the starting position for toroidal chess on a standard board. In the starting setup, the rooks protect each other while being threatened by the opponent&#x27;s rooks. They are supported by the knights on the sides of the board, making their positions more defensible.

On the toroidal board, checkmate is impossible with king and queen versus king, but it is possible with king and two rooks versus king.

Bishops can make null moves in toroidal chess, by moving e.g. c1–d2–e3–f4–g5–h6–a7–b8–c1.

<doc id="1323056" wikidata="Q5422083" url="?curid=1323056" title="Extinction chess">
<text>Extinction chess is a chess variant invented by R. Wayne Schmittberger, editor of &quot;Games&quot; magazine, in 1985. Instead of checkmate as the winning condition, the object of the game is the elimination of all of a particular type of piece of the opponent. In other words, the objective is any of the following:

* capture all the opponent&#x27;s kings;
* capture all the opponent&#x27;s queens;
* capture all the opponent&#x27;s rooks;
* capture all the opponent&#x27;s bishops;
* capture all the opponent&#x27;s knights;
* eliminate all of the opponent&#x27;s pawns, by capturing or by promotion.

A promoted pawn is considered no longer a pawn. By the same token, if a player already has a queen, and promotes a pawn to another queen, then both queens would need to be captured to make them extinct.

The king is not a special piece in this game, and it is legal to promote a pawn to a king. It is also legal to castle when in check, or to castle through check. The other rules of castling are the same: the king and the rook must not have previously moved, and there must be no pieces in between. Similarly, rooks, bishops, and queens may freely cross attacked squares, even if they are the last of their type.

Both sides can suffer an extinction on the same move, if pawn promotion is involved. For example, White might have a last pawn on b7, and Black a last bishop on c8; then if White plays bxc8=Q, it causes the extinction of both the white pawns and the black bishops. In this case White is ruled to have won, as although both sides have fulfilled their winning conditions, it was a move by White that brought this situation about. (This is different from atomic chess, where you cannot explode your own king, even if the enemy king would also perish in the explosion.)

==Sample game==

:N.N.–Fabrice Liardet, Messigny 1998:
:1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qa5 4. a3 e5 5. b4 Bxb4 6. axb4 Qxa1 7. Bc4 Nf6 8. Ba2? 0-0 9. Nge2 Rd8 10. Bc4 Nc6 11. b5 Nd4 12. 0-0 Nxe2 13. Nxe2 Rd4 0–1
White loses both bishops. Although &quot;winning the exchange&quot; is usually bad in Extinction Chess, the pin on the first rank in this case is very potent: White underestimated it and the Black rook&#x27;s swift arrival on the d-file.

<doc id="1323060" wikidata="Q998685" url="?curid=1323060" title="Black-tufted marmoset">
<text>The black-tufted marmoset (Callithrix penicillata) is a species of New World monkey that lives primarily in the Neotropical gallery forests of the Brazilian Central Plateau. It ranges from Bahia to Paraná, and as far inland as Goiás, between 14°S and 25°S, and can commonly be seen in the Rio de Janeiro city where it was introduced. This marmoset typically resides in rainforests, living an arboreal life high in the trees, below the canopy. They are only rarely spotted near the ground.

==Physical description==
The black-tufted marmoset is characterized by black tufts of hair around their ears. It typically has some sparse white hairs on its face. It usually has a brown or black head and its limbs and upper body are gray, as well as its abdomen, while its rump and underside are usually black. Its tail is ringed with black and white and is not prehensive, instead used for balance. It does not have an opposable thumb and its nails tend to have a claw-like appearance. The black-tufted marmoset reaches a size of and weighs up to .

==Behavior==
The black-tufted marmoset has a lifestyle very similar to other marmosets, being diurnal and arboreal. It typically lives in family groups of 2 to 14. The groups usually consist of a reproductive couple and their offspring. The males, as well as juvenile offspring, commonly assist the female in the raising of the young.

Though the black-tufted marmoset lives in small family groups, it is believed that they share their food source, sap trees, with other marmoset groups. Scent marking does occur within these groups, but it is believed that the marking is to deter other species rather than other black-tufted marmoset groups, because other groups typically ignore these markings. They also appear to be migratory, often moving in relation to the wet or dry seasons, however, the extent of their migration is unknown.

Though communication between black-tufted marmosets has not been studied thoroughly, it is believed that it communicates through vocalizations. It has known predator-specific cries and appears to vocalize frequently outside of predator cries.

==Food and predation==
The black-tufted marmoset diet consists primarily of tree sap, which it obtains by nibbling the bark with its long lower incisors. In periods of drought, it will also include fruit and insects in its diet. In periods of serious drought, it has also been known to eat small arthropods, molluscs, bird eggs, baby birds and small vertebrates.

Large birds of prey are the greatest threat to the black-tufted marmoset, however, snakes and wild cats also pose a danger to them. Predator-specific vocalizations and visual scanning are its only anti-predation techniques.

==Reproduction==
The black-tufted marmoset is monogamous and lives in family groups. It reproduces twice a year, producing 1 to 4 offspring, though most often just twins. Its gestation period is 150 days and offspring are weaned after 8 weeks. There is considerable parental investment by this species, with both parents, as well as older juveniles, helping to raise the young. The offspring are extremely dependent on their parents and though they are sexually mature at 18 months, they typically do not mate until much later, staying with their family group until they do.

==Ecosystem roles and conservation status==
The black-tufted marmoset is a mutualist with many species of fruit trees because it distributes the seeds from the fruit it consumes throughout the forests. However, it is a parasite on other species of trees because it creates sores in trees in order to extract sap, while offering no apparent benefit to the trees. Though this marmoset is not a main food source to any specific species, it is a food source to a number of different species, specifically large birds of prey, wild cats, and snakes.

The black-tufted marmoset is listed as having no special status on the IUCN Red List or the United States Endangered Species Act List. It is listed in Appendix II of CITES and is not currently considered an endangered or threatened species. In Rio de Janeiro State, where it was introduced alongside the common marmoset, it is considered as an invasive species posing a danger to the survival of the endangered golden lion tamarin through competition. Management of the species in its invaded habitat has included proposals for sterilization of reproductive-age individuals, relocation, and public awareness campaign for prevention of further releases.

=== Games ===
;Arcade
* April – Sega&#x27;s dot-eating driving game, &quot;Head On&quot;, is released. It becomes a popular concept to clone, especially for home systems.
* August – Atari releases &quot;Lunar Lander&quot;, the first arcade version of a game concept created on minicomputers ten years earlier.
* November – Atari releases the vector graphics-based &quot;Asteroids&quot;, which becomes Atari&#x27;s second best selling game of all time and displaces &quot;Space Invaders&quot; as the most popular game in the US.
* November – Namco releases fixed shooter &quot;Galaxian&quot; in full color.
* November – Vectorbeam releases &quot;Tail Gunner&quot;, a space shooter with a first-person perspective.
* December – Nintendo releases &quot;Radar Scope&quot;, featuring a pseudo-3D, third-person perspective. Later, 2000 out of 3000 manufactured machines are converted to &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;.
* Cinematronics releases &quot;Warrior&quot;, one of the first fighting games without a boxing theme.
* Sega releases the vertically scrolling &quot;Monaco GP&quot;, featuring full color and day/night driving. It is one of Sega&#x27;s last discrete logic (no CPU) hardware designs.

;Computer
* August – Automated Simulations releases &quot;Temple of Apshai&quot;, one of the first graphical role-playing games for home computers. It remains the best-selling computer RPG through to 1982.
* October – subLOGIC releases &quot;Flight Simulator&quot; for the Apple II.
* Richard Garriott creates &quot;&quot;, a computer role-playing game for the Apple II. It launches Garriott&#x27;s career and is a precursor to his highly successful &quot;Ultima&quot; series.
* Richard Bartle and Roy Trubshaw create what is commonly recognized as the first playable MUD.
* Atari, Inc.&#x27;s 8K &quot;Star Raiders&quot; cartridge is released and becomes a system seller for the new Atari 400/800 computer line.

<doc id="1323068" wikidata="Q1051211" url="?curid=1323068" title="Catmull–Clark subdivision surface">
<text>The Catmull–Clark algorithm is a technique used in 3D computer graphics to create curved surfaces by using subdivision surface modeling. It was devised by Edwin Catmull and Jim Clark in 1978 as a generalization of bi-cubic &quot;uniform&quot; B-spline surfaces to arbitrary topology.

In 2005/06, Edwin Catmull, together with Tony DeRose and Jos Stam, received an Academy Award for Technical Achievement for their invention and application of subdivision surfaces. DeRose wrote about &quot;efficient, fair interpolation&quot; and character animation. Stam described a technique for a direct evaluation of the limit surface without recursion.

== Recursive evaluation ==
Catmull–Clark surfaces are defined recursively, using the following &quot;refinement scheme.&quot;

Start with a mesh of an arbitrary polyhedron. All the vertices in this mesh shall be called &quot;original points&quot;.
* For each face, add a &quot;face point&quot;
** Set each face point to be the average of all &quot;original points&quot; for the respective face
* For each edge, add an &quot;edge point&quot;.
** Set each edge point to be the average of the two neighbouring face points &quot;(A,F)&quot; and the two endpoints of the edge &quot;(M,E)&quot; formula_1
* For each &quot;original point&quot; (&quot;P)&quot;, take the average (&quot;F)&quot; of all &quot;n&quot; (recently created) face points for faces touching &quot;P&quot;, and take the average &quot;(R)&quot; of all &quot;n&quot; edge midpoints for original edges touching &quot;P&quot;, where each edge midpoint is the average of its two endpoint vertices (not to be confused with new &quot;edge points&quot; above). (Note that from the perspective of a vertex &quot;P&quot;, the number of edges neighboring &quot;P&quot; is also the number of adjacent faces, hence &quot;n&quot;)
**Move each &quot;original point&quot; to the new &quot;vertex point&quot; formula_2 (This is the barycenter of &quot;P&quot;, &quot;R&quot; and &quot;F&quot; with respective weights (&quot;n&quot; − 3), 2 and 1)
*Form edges and faces in the new mesh
**Connect each new &quot;face point&quot; to the new &quot;edge points&quot; of all original edges defining the original face
** Connect each new &quot;vertex point&quot; to the new &quot;edge points&quot; of all original edges incident on the original vertex 
** Define new faces as enclosed by edges 

=== Properties ===
The new mesh will consist only of quadrilaterals, which in general will &quot;not&quot; be planar. The new mesh will generally look &quot;smoother&quot; (i.e. less &quot;jagged&quot; or &quot;pointy&quot;) than the old mesh. Repeated subdivision results in meshes that are more and more rounded.

The arbitrary-looking barycenter formula was chosen by Catmull and Clark based on the aesthetic appearance of the resulting surfaces rather than on a mathematical derivation, although they do go to great lengths to rigorously show that the method converges to bicubic B-spline surfaces.

It can be shown that the limit surface obtained by this refinement process is at least formula_3 at extraordinary vertices and formula_4 everywhere else (when &quot;n&quot; indicates how many derivatives are continuous, we speak of formula_5 continuity). After one iteration, the number of extraordinary points on the surface remains constant.

== Exact evaluation ==
The limit surface of Catmull–Clark subdivision surfaces can also be evaluated directly, without any recursive refinement. This can be accomplished by means of the technique of Jos Stam (1998). This method reformulates the recursive refinement process into a matrix exponential problem, which can be solved directly by means of matrix diagonalization.

===Highest-grossing arcade games===
====Japan====
In Japan, the following titles were the highest-grossing arcade games of 1977, according to the second annual &quot;Game Machine&quot; chart. Both arcade video games and electro-mechanical games (EM games) are listed on the same arcade chart. Namco&#x27;s EM racing game &quot;F-1&quot; was the highest-grossing overall arcade game for the second year in a row, followed by Taito&#x27;s racing video game &quot;Speed Race DX&quot; (its predecessor &quot;Speed Race&quot; was distributed as &quot;Wheels&quot; by Midway Manufacturing in North America).

Note: Medal games are listed on a separate chart, with Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;EVR Race&quot; being the highest-grossing medal game for the second year in a row.

====United States====
In the United States, &quot;Play Meter&quot; magazine began publishing annual lists of top-grossing arcade games in 1977. The following titles were the top ten highest-earning arcade video games of the year on the annual &quot;Play Meter&quot; and &quot;RePlay&quot; charts. Lifetime arcade cabinet sales are also given in a separate column.

=== Best-selling home systems ===
==Events==
*Agnes Kim opens the first Electronics Boutique, a kiosk at the King of Prussia mall in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania selling transistor radios and calculators.

* October – Commodore releases the Commodore PET.
* Intelligent Systems releases the Compucolor II.

<doc id="1323074" wikidata="Q924912" url="?curid=1323074" title="Lake Sfânta Ana">
<text>Lake Sfânta Ana (; ; ) is the only crater lake in Romania located in the volcanic crater of the Ciomad volcano of the Eastern Carpathians, near Tușnad in the Natural Reserve of Mohoș, Harghita County, Romania.

Palynology studies concluded that the history of Lake Saint Anne began about 9,800-8,800 years ago, at the stage of peat bog and shallow lake.

The depth of Saint Anne Lake is constantly decreasing. In 1867 it was 12 m, but now it is less than 7 m. In 2005, the maximum depth of the lake was 6.4 m and the sediment thickness was about 4 m. The lake is supplied exclusively from precipitation, therefore the degree of mineralization of the water is very low. The water purity approaches that of distilled water, with only 0.0029 ml mineral.

In winter, the lake is covered with a layer of ice of up to 1 m. The lake is part of the Mohos Nature Reserve.

Near the lake there is a Roman Catholic chapel dedicated to Saint Anne.

Swimming in the lake in general has been prohibited since April 2018. It is available only for sporting events under special permits.

<text>1976 was a mixed year for the expansion of the video game industry. While the consumer market in the United States for dedicated home consoles saw significant growth, the coin-operated video game market saw a decline despite individual hits. The year also marked the availability of some of the first computer game software for microcomputers, growing out of the hobbyist market.

In the U.S coin-operated games market, video games were largely stalled due to the reemergence of pinball as a popular category. Licensed tables like Bally’s &quot;Wizard&quot; (1975) and the creation of successful tables utilizing solid-state electronics allowed pinball to outpace video games. Smaller companies – particularly those who relied on the cocktail table market – failed to keep pace and many new games were not successful. Several of the top earning games of the year were the same as those of the year prior with only a few standout releases such as &quot;Sea Wolf&quot;.

Home consoles saw an explosion in interest in the U.S. after the successful 1975 Holiday season. Established companies like Atari and Magnavox created additional models sold throughout the year. New companies to the business adopted pre-made chips to create their own consoles, most prominently the General Instrument AY-3-8500 “&quot;Pong&quot; on a chip”. The most successful and lasting of these competitors was Coleco Industries who managed to outsell all their competition with their Telstar line of consoles. In Japan, the availability and development of dedicated console chips spurred the domestic market. The end of 1976 also saw the release of the first programmable home system with interchangeable ROM cartridges, Fairchild’s Video Entertainment System, the first console of the second generation.

Computer games continued to be shared via timesharing networks on mainframe systems at institutions and universities through this period. The most significant game introduced in 1976 was &quot;Adventure&quot;, the origin of the interactive fiction genre – which in turn led to action adventure games. &quot;Adventure&quot; was distributed via the ARPANET which allowed its influence to reach not only locations across the United States but into Europe through the nascent Internet. The PLATO network also featured advances in interactive experiences, including sophisticated role-playing games both single and multiplayer.

Microcomputers created for electronics enthusiasts proliferated after the introduction of the Altair 8800 in 1975. Several companies sold commercial game software targeted at hobbyists building computer kits. Many of these were adaptations of circulating BASIC games like &quot;Star Trek&quot; (1971) and others were made for specific computer addons – usually graphics boards. The software market for early microcomputers was largely based on trading rather than purchasing programs – which prompted Bill Gates to pen his famous An Open Letter to Hobbyists.

In Japan, video games took on greater importance in the coin-operated market as Sega, Taito, and Namco transitioned to give video games a greater focus. Taito found success importing games from Midway Mfg in the U.S. like &quot;Ball Park&quot; while Sega pushed the boundaries of transistor-transistor logic technology with games like &quot;Road Race&quot;. Namco, through its relationship with Atari, imported what would be the defining game of the first Japanese video game boom, &quot;Breakout&quot;.

==Events==

== Financial performance ==

===United States===

==== Arcade ====
Total unit sales: 54,000 cabinets.
==== Most popular arcade games ====
RePlay magazine&#x27;s Route and Arcade Survey was published in October 1976, including a chart of most popular games on location over the last several months. The lists compiled by RePlay were based on polling operators regarding their opinions of games receiving the most attention in their locations. RePlay&#x27;s charts were based on only a subset of reports by operators and are not on imperial metrics such as earnings reports, but they give a strong indication of games which were of the most value to arcades and street locations.

The Profit Chart section of the survey included a top ten listing of games seen as most profitable by operators. This included two pinball games – &quot;Wizard&quot; by Bally (#3) and &quot;Captain Fantastic&quot; by Bally (#9) – as well as electro-mechanical game &quot;Daytona 500&quot; (#10) by Allied Leisure. Four additional games were left in an unranked section: &quot;Trivia&quot; by Ramtek, &quot;Demolition Derby&quot; by Chicago Coin, &quot;Death Race&quot; by Exidy, and &quot;Bombs Away&quot; by Meadows Games.

Home consoles

Total unit sales: 3.24 million–4 million consoles.

Total revenue (retail): $125–225 million.
===Japan===
&quot;Game Machine&quot; magazine published the results of their first annual survey of arcade operators in the country. This first survey only covered results as of the Japanese New Year&#x27;s holiday. They received data from 49 locations, which were divided by a region. Respondents were asked to rank their most popular games from first to third place, with points allocated depending on their placement. The list was further divided between arcade games, medal games, and kiddie rides. The arcade game list included 27 named games, with 17 of them being video games.

==Notable releases==
===Games===
* February – &quot;Nürburgring 1&quot; is released by the German company Trakus. Created by Dr. Reiner Foerst, the racing game is among the first to feature 3-D graphics and object scaling. The units are created by hand with twenty-eight individual circuit boards powering the logic. Digital Games, Dave Nutting Associates, and Atari all develop games based on &quot;Nürburgring 1&quot;.
** Sega releases &quot;Road Race&quot;, a third-person racing game with object scaling. The game is later rejiggered as motorcycle racing game &quot;Man T.T.&quot; which features soundtrack via an 8-track music player and haptic feedback when the vehicle crashes. It is released in the U.S. under the licensed name of &quot;Fonz&quot; – the first video game with an officially licensed media property.
** &quot;Interceptor&quot; by Taito becomes available. The game features discrete object scaling in the context of a first-person flight shooting game.
** &quot;Sea Wolf&quot; is released by Midway Mfg, a successful gallery target shooting game updating previous electro-mechanical games. The game features and early version of an electronic high score feature.
* April – &quot;Death Race&quot; by Exidy is released. The game causes the first controversy on video game violence when a reporter for the Associated Press writes about its graphic imagery.
* May – Atari Inc. ships &quot;Breakout&quot;. The game is a hit in the United States but becomes even bigger in Japan when it is released by Namco. Block breaker games in the country create the first video game boom.
* October – &quot;Heavyweight Champ&quot; by Sega premieres and features early one-on-one dueling between two human opponents, considered by some to be the first fighting game.
* November – &quot;Sprint 2&quot; is released by Atari Inc. under their Kee Games label. It is the first commercially released game to feature the technology of hardware sprites, patented by Steve Mayer and Ron Milner of Cyan Engineering.
* December – &quot;Blockade&quot; by Gremlin Industries is released. It serves as the origin for the snake game but is not very successful due to rampant cloning of the game by other companies.

=== Computer games ===

* William Crowther finishes work on &quot;Adventure&quot; or &quot;ADVENT&quot;, the pioneering interactive fiction game based on his caving experience and &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. He leaves the program to be discovered by others on the Bolt, Beranek and Newman server of the ARPANET, after which it proliferates to computer labs across the country.
* Gary Wisenhunt and Ray Wood complete the role-playing game dnd on the PLATO IV system. The game features a more structured style than the earlier &quot;The Dungeon&quot;, including an end boss.
* &quot;Moria&quot; by Kevet Duncombe and Jim Battin introduces a first-person, three-dimensional perspective to the multiplayer role-playing experiences of the PLATO IV system. The game features the ability for players to form a party and becomes massively influential in the PLATO ecosystem.
* March – SCELBI offers the book &quot;Scelbi&#x27;s First Book of Computer Games for the &quot;8008&quot;/&quot;8080&quot;&quot; for sale. These are among the first games programmed specifically for microprocessors available for purchase.
* June – The company Cromemco ships the Dazzler, a graphics display board for S-100 compatible computers. Alongside the hardware, Cromemco offers several programs for the system on paper tape including implementations of tic-tac-toe and &quot;Life&quot;.
* September – &quot;&quot; by Chris Crawford is developed for the IBM 1130. Crawford would go on to help define the academic field of video game design.
* December – &quot;Microchess&quot; is completed for the KIM-1 computer kit by Peter R. Jennings. It is among the most prolific early games on microcomputers.

===Console games===

* February – General Instrument announces the availability of their AY-3-8500 integrated circuit made specifically for game-playing machines. The chip features six games, including four &quot;Pong&quot;-style games. The availability of the chip as an OEM part creates a mass proliferation of companies involved in the console business.
* June – Coleco ships the Telstar dedicated console using the AY-3-8500 chip. Due to their early awareness of the chip, Coleco received their full order and the Telstar line became the most popular set of systems in 1976.
* November – The Video Entertainment System – the first console to feature programmable cartridges – from Fairchild Semiconductor becomes available after several delays. Of the three launch titles, only &quot;Videocart-1&quot; is broadly available due to manufacturing set backs. The console introduces the first pause feature to video games.

==Business==

* April 1 – Apple Computer is founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne.
* April 20 – Data East Inc. is founded by Tetsuo Fukuda as an electronics measurement instrument manufacturer. The company becomes involved in coin-operated amusements and later video games.
* October 1 – Atari Inc. is purchased by Warner Communications to make it a wholly-owned subsidiary. The deal amounts to $28 million to buy out the shareholders. Management remains in place, with Manny Gerard of the Warner Office of the President appointed to oversee the business.

<doc id="1323079" wikidata="Q782502" url="?curid=1323079" title="1975 in video games">
<text>1975 saw several critical influences in the history of video games, including the first commercial games utilizing large-scale integrated circuits and microprocessors, as well as the first role-playing video games.

On the back end of the &quot;Pong&quot; boom, the coin-operated video game industry achieved new expressions of gameplay and animation in arcade games. Racing games and competitive shooting games became particularly popular. Local multiplayer games accommodating more than four players were released by Atari, featuring advanced implementations of transistor-transistor logic hardware. Several games utilizing microprocessors debuted in coin-op, including the influential &quot;Gun Fight&quot; from Midway Mfg.

The console industry saw its first competitive environment in the United States with Magnavox, Atari, and smaller competitors introducing systems utilizing advanced circuit designs. Atari’s Pong home console featured a sophisticated custom chip created in-house. European dedicated consoles remained isolated to specific regions, but offered some of the first console lines from companies like Videomaster. Japan’s first native console was developed and released by toy company Epoch.

Computer networks saw a mass proliferation of game variants written in the BASIC programming language which influenced the emerging field of microcomputers. Games introduced in publications like People’s Computer Company and &quot;101 BASIC Computer Games&quot; were frequently played via teletypes on time-sharing connected terminals; some were distributed via the remote connected ARPANET. The PLATO network likewise experienced a massive uptick in titles following the popularity of &quot;Empire&quot; and &quot;Spasim&quot;. Midwestern universities connected to the PLATO system were early recipients of the spread of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, which prompted several student groups to develop the earliest computer role-playing games.

==Events==

* February 16–19 – Atari attends the New York Toy Fair to interest retailers to stock their forthcoming &quot;Pong&quot; home console. They fail to find any interest among toy buyers.
* March 12 – Wallace Kirschner and Lawrence Haskel file US Patent #4,026,555 for Alpex Computer Corporation relating to a bitmapped system for video game graphics.
* March 17 – Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. signs an agreement with Atari Inc. to distribute their Pong home console in their Sears retail stores. Sears creates the Tele-Games brand to market the game while also allowing Atari’s logo to appear on the product. Magnavox later sues Sears over infringement of their Odyssey patents.
* September 16–19 – The first WESCON computer trade show is held in San Francisco, California. Premiering there is the MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor, which powers many future video game systems. Steve Mayer and Ron Milner of Atari&#x27;s Cyan Engineering are convinced to use the 6502 in their prototype home video game system which developes into the Video Computer System.
* October 17–19 – The Music Operators of America show is held in Chicago, Illinois. Several microprocessor video games make their debut including &quot;Gun Fight&quot; from Midway, &quot;Shark&quot; from U.S. Billiards, &quot;PT-109&quot; from Mirco Games, and &quot;Destruction Derby&quot; from Major Manufacturers.
* October 29 – Stephen Bristow of Atari Inc. patents the technology behind the first hardware-enabled sprites for video games, dubbed Player/Missile Graphics by Atari.
* November 26 – A market study evaluating the Alpex Computer home video game system using ROM cartridges is drafted by Gene Landrum for Fairchild Semiconductor, which convinces the company to create the Fairchild Video Entertainment System.

==Financial performance==

=== United States ===

==== Arcade ====
Total unit sales: 50,000–79,000.&quot;&quot;

Total Revenue (machine sales): $68–76 million.&quot;&quot;
==== Most popular arcade games ====
RePlay magazine published its first popularity chart for coin-operated games in the United States in March 1976, covering games of the previous year. The lists were based on polling operators regarding their opinions of games receiving the most attention in their locations. RePlay&#x27;s charts were based only on a subset of operators and are not on imperial metrics such as earnings reports, but they give a strong indication of games which were of the most value to arcades and street locations.

The RePlay rankings included both video and electro-mechanical games which ran in close competition through the 1970s until video games became dominant. Outside of the top twenty ranked in order, forty-eight other games were also listed.
Home consoles

Total unit sales: 250,000-400,000 consoles.

Total revenue (retail): $32-40 million.

<text>1974 saw the expansion of technology and public awareness of video games. A proliferation of companies creating commercial video games in the coin-operated amusement market attracted attention from the mainstream press. Coin-operated games began to diversify in content beyond &quot;Pong&quot; derivatives. The first three-dimensional games were developed for linked graphical terminals which would not be widely commercialized. Some of the first efforts to create video game consoles after the release of Magnavox&#x27;s Odyssey became available in the United States and Europe.

==Events==

* January 31 – A fire destroys the factory of Allied Leisure in Hialeah, Florida. The company is forced to exit the video game industry temporarily.
* April 15 – Magnavox and Sanders Associates file suit against Atari Inc, Bally Mfg, Chicago Dynamic Industries, Allied Leisure, and Empire Distributing for infringement of the patents related to the Odyssey by Ralph Baer and Bill Rusch. Magnavox’s wave of litigation would be highly consequential to the development of the video game industry.
* June 21–23 – The program &quot;Ribbit&quot; from the University of Waterloo earns victory at the First Canadian Computer Chess Championship, running off of a Honeywell 6050. It later wins at the fifth U.S. American Computer Chess Championship, displacing the four time champion &quot;Chess 4.0&quot;.
* July – Nakamura Seisakusho (later Namco) purchases Atari Japan for 296 million yen. The company becomes the exclusive distributor of Atari video games in Japan for several years – solidifying a long-term relationship between Atari and Namco.
* August 5–8 – The first World Computer Chess Championship is held in Stockholm, Sweden. Kaissa&quot;Kaissa&quot;, a program developed in the Soviet Union, earns first prize.
* August 27 – Sega sponsors a national tournament of competitive video games called the All Japan TV Game Championships at three hundred locations throughout Japan.
* September 15 – The New York Times runs an article covering the &quot;Pong&quot; boom titled “The Space Age Pinball Machine.”
* November 1–3 – The Music Operators of America show is held in Chicago, Illinois. Notable video games at the show include &quot;Qwak!&quot; by Atari, &quot;Tank&quot; by Kee Games, and &quot;Baseball&quot; by Ramtek.

=== Arcade games ===

* February – Taito’s &quot;Basketball&quot; by pioneering game designer Tomohiro Nishikado features the first human-shaped characters in a coin-operated video game. Midway licenses the game for release in North America as &quot;TV Basketball&quot;, making it the first Japanese video arcade game to be officially exported to the U.S.
* March – Atari releases &quot;Gran Trak 10&quot;, a video driving game featuring advanced technology including a ROM to store graphics and course data. After initial manufacturing issues, the game becomes a massive success.
** Meadows Games releases the enhanced ball-and-paddle game &quot;Flim Flam&quot;. It&#x27;s among the most successful &quot;Pong&quot; clones, released in both upright and cocktail cabinet format.
* May – &quot;Clean Sweep&quot; is released by Ramtek, a ball-and-paddle game featuring screen-clearing gameplay. It serves as an inspiration for &quot;Breakout&quot;.
* August – Sega ships &quot;Balloon Gun&quot; in Japan, the first coin-operated video game utilizing a light gun. The method used is different from the &quot;Odyssey&quot; light gun, able to identify individual parts of the screen being shot.
* October – &quot;Baseball&quot; by Ramtek is released. In addition to being the first coin-operated sports video game to authentically depict aspects of its play, it is the first video game to represent multiple characters with animation frames on screen at once.
* November – Kee Games releases &quot;Tank&quot;. The game is a reinterpretation of &quot;Computer Space&quot; featuring custom controls and competitive gameplay. It becomes the best selling arcade video game released in 1974 in all and is seen as a defining moment for video arcade games. The game is later adapted to Atari&#x27;s Video Computer System as &quot;Combat&quot;.
** Taito releases &quot;Speed Race&quot;, a racing game featuring an early form of scrolling graphics. It helps pioneer 100 yen as a standard play price in Japan.

* January – The science fiction economic strategy game &quot;Star Trader&quot; is first distributed by the People’s Computer Company via paper tape. It has a long-lasting legacy on computer systems, with subsequent iterations of the game expanding its design.
* March – Jim Bowery develops &quot;Spasim&quot; for the PLATO IV system, a graphical space flight simulator. It is the first computer game to implement true 3D graphics, rather than fixed perspective. &quot;Spasim&quot; inspires a number of PLATO flight simulation games including &quot;Airace&quot; and &quot;Airfight&quot;.
* The first version of the game &quot;Wander&quot; is developed by Peter Langston. It is the earliest example of a parser-based storytelling game; an early example of interactive fiction.

<text>The year 1973 saw a substantial increase in the number of video games created and distributed. In coin-operated games, a craze for &quot;Pong&quot;-style games ignited the first fad for video games both in the United States and other countries such as Japan and the United Kingdom. Time-sharing networks saw greater proliferation of popular programs through type-in listings. The PLATO computer located at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign played host to some of the earliest massively multiplayer games.

==Events==

<doc id="1323085" wikidata="Q1739372" url="?curid=1323085" title="Chapelcross nuclear power station">
<text>Chapelcross nuclear power station is a former Magnox nuclear power station undergoing decommissioning. It is located in Annan in Dumfries and Galloway in southwest Scotland, and was in operation from 1959 to 2004. It was the sister plant to the Calder Hall nuclear power station plant in Cumbria, England; both were commissioned and originally operated by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority. The primary purpose of both plants was to produce weapons-grade plutonium for the UK&#x27;s nuclear weapons programme, but they also generated electrical power for the National Grid. Later in the reactors&#x27; lifecycle, as the UK slowed the development of the nuclear deterrent as the cold war came to a close, power production became the primary goal of reactor operation.

The site is being decommissioned by Nuclear Decommissioning Authority subsidiary Magnox Ltd. The station&#x27;s four cooling towers were demolished in 2007. The reactors are spent-fuel free and are currently undergoing dismantlement of primary loop equipment such as heat exchangers and hot gas ducts. Once complete, the reactors will enter a care and maintenance stage to allow radiation levels to decline before the reactors themselves are demolished.

==Location==
Chapelcross occupies a site on the location of former World War II training airfield, RAF Annan, located north east of the town of Annan in the Annandale and Eskdale district within the Dumfries and Galloway region of south west Scotland. The nearest hamlet is Creca.

==History==
Chapelcross was the sister plant to Calder Hall in Cumbria, England. Construction was carried out by Mitchell Construction and was completed in 1959. The primary purpose was to produce plutonium for the UK&#x27;s nuclear weapons programme, for weapons including the WE.177 series. Electricity was always considered to be a by-product. Both Chapelcross and Calderhall were the only nuclear power stations built as part of the UK&#x27;s gas reactor fleet to use cooling towers as a heat sink as opposed to using a body of water.

The Chapelcross Works was officially opened on 2 May 1959 by the Lord Lieutenant of Dumfriesshire, Sir John Crabbe. It was initially owned and operated by the Production Group of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) until the creation of British Nuclear Fuels Limited (BNFL) in 1971 by an act of Parliament. The site then operated in conjunction with Calder Hall under the banner of BNFL&#x27;s Electricity Generation Business (EGB) until rebranding, relicensing and restructuring of the various nuclear businesses operated by HM Government under the umbrella legal entity of BNFL took place in April 2005.

Chapelcross had four Magnox reactors capable of generating 60MWe of power each. The reactors were supplied by the UKAEA and the turbines by C.A. Parsons &amp; Company.

Ownership of all of the site&#x27;s assets and liabilities was transferred to the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), a new regulatory body created by the Energy Act 2004. The site was then operated under the two-tier Site Management Company/Site License Company (SMC/SLC) model, with British Nuclear Group&#x27;s Reactor Sites business as SMC and Magnox Electric Ltd as the SLC. In June 2007, EnergySolutions bought the Reactor Sites Management Company Ltd (RSML, consisting of two operational divisions, Magnox North and Magnox South) from British Nuclear Group. RSML subsequently became Magnox Ltd and is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the NDA.

Several significant events in 2001 persuaded BNFL to upgrade the fuel routes of both Calder Hall and Chapelcross to near modern standards at a cost of tens of millions of pounds, to guarantee that a License Instrument would be granted by the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) to permit final defuelling: the engineering work was carried out by BNS Nuclear Services (formally Alstec).

Generation ceased in June 2004.

===Decommissioning and the cooling towers===

The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) granted consent to carry out decommissioning projects at Chapelcross under the regulations to Magnox Electric Ltd on 26 September 2005. The first visible sign of decommissioning was controlled demolition at 09:00 BST on 20 May 2007 of the four natural-draught concrete cooling towers, which were of the same hyperboloid design as conventional inland power stations such as Didcot, Drax, Ferrybridge and Fiddlers Ferry. The explosions were designed to remove a section of the towers&#x27; shells. Approximately two-thirds of the circumference and two-thirds of the shell legs were removed by the blasts, causing a controlled collapse of each tower. The charges were fired sequentially, reducing the high towers to an estimated 25,000tons of rubble in less than 10seconds. Those at Calder Hall were demolished on 29 September 2007.

Some local people (including site employees) were opposed to the obliteration of a symbol of the region&#x27;s industrial heritage. The towers were considered a local landmark that could be seen from a distance of up to in good weather conditions. British Nuclear Group and the NDA prioritised conventional demolition over deplanting and post-operational clean-out (POCO) of the nuclear facilities on the site. A large part of the shell of tower 1 managed to resist the explosives despite having a visible bulge that resulted from a construction anomaly.

By December 2012, three of the four reactors had been defuelled. Defuelling was completed in February 2013.

Removal of most buildings is expected to take until 2023–2024, followed by a care and maintenance phase from 2024 to 2089. Demolition of reactor buildings and final site clearance is planned for 2089 to 2095.

==Plant design==
The plant design was essentially the same as Calder Hall, comprising four 180MWth graphite moderated, carbon dioxide cooled nuclear reactors fuelled by natural abundance uranium (0.71% 235U) enclosed in magnesium-alloy cans, the principal difference being in plant layout. Since Chapelcross was commissioned from the outset as a four-reactor site (the option for a further four reactors was not exercised) rather than separate two-reactor sites as at Calder &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;B&#x27; stations, the site layout was more compact. There is a single turbine hall housing all eight turbines, which were originally rated at 23MWe but progressively uprated to 30MWe as the reactor thermal output was uprated to nominally 265MWth.

Reactor 1 had the same core design as Calder Hall (i.e. unsleeved), but the fuel channels of reactors 2, 3 and 4 were fitted with graphite sleeves to allow the bulk moderator to run hotter, to limit the effects of in-service graphite damage due to irradiation. Two of the reactors were used to produce tritium for the UK&#x27;s nuclear weapons and required enriched uranium fuel to offset the neutron absorbing effect of the lithium target material.

==Layout and facilities==

The south part of the site consists of a modular administration building, four reactor buildings, turbine hall, maintenance workshops, stores, fuel element cooling pond building, tritium processing plant (CXPP) and new flask handling facility (FHB). The part of the site referred to as north site consists of legacy buildings including aircraft hangars, a graphite handling laboratory and a large building that originally housed some 10,000drums of yellow depleted uranium trioxide arising from reprocessing at Sellafield. In the mid-2010s, the NDA removed and shipped all of the depleted uranium drums from Chapelcross to Sellafield.

Liquid effluent is disposed of via a long pipeline to the Solway Firth. All environmental discharges are subject to an annual discharge authorisation which is regulated by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA).
Chapelcross produced tritium for the Polaris and Trident strategic nuclear weapon systems from about 1980 until 2005. This was achieved by neutron bombardment of lithium target material, with the tritium gas extracted in the Chapelcross Processing Plant (CXPP). This facility was managed by BNFL on behalf of the Ministry of Defence (MoD). The material was transferred to Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston via secure road convoys. Because of its involvement in the nuclear weapons programme, the site was not subject to international safeguards until 1998.

== Operating experience and incidents ==

=== Single channel fuel clad melt (May 1967) ===
Fuel in a single channel in Reactor 2 that was loaded with fuel elements under evaluation for the commercial reactor programme experienced a partial blockage, attributed to the presence of graphite debris (see fuel element failure). The fuel overheated and the Magnox cladding failed, causing contamination to be deposited in one region of the core. The reactor was restarted in 1969 after successful clean-out operations and was the final reactor to cease operation in February 2004.

=== Fatal accident (ca. 1978) ===
BNFL was fined £200 in 1978 for a fatal accident at Chapelcross.

=== Boiler shell defect (June 1997) ===
Cracks associated with brackets in Heat Exchanger 6 on Reactor 2 were discovered during routine ultrasonic testing. Metallurgical examination of samples of the defect showed that:
* It originated during fabrication in the workshop and prior to an over-pressure test of 2.35 times the design pressure (a loading significantly in excess of a modern pressure vessel code requirement).
* There was no evidence of in-service fatigue crack growth.
* The material in which the crack was located was different from that specified in the design. Similar material was also identified in other heat exchangers, and no additional cracks of structural significance were revealed during comprehensive inspections. The NII considered the material to be adequate and within the bounds of the heat exchanger safety case.

=== Exposure of workers to an irradiated fuel element (first quarter 2001) ===
During refuelling operations on Reactor 2, an irradiated fuel element failed to release from the grab which holds an element while it is withdrawn from a reactor. Routine methods were used to release the grab. However, the irradiated fuel element snagged during the operation and was lifted out of its shielding, resulting in the operators on the pile cap being exposed to the intense radiation being emitted from the irradiated fuel element. Personnel responded quickly, and the radiological dose they received was small.

The event revealed shortfalls in the safety of the refuelling operation and the licensee took the immediate step of halting all refuelling while it investigated the event and reviewed the safety of the equipment. The NII investigated the event and judged that it was due to inadequate design and operation of the equipment.

The incident was classified as Level 1 (anomaly) on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES).

=== Leak of Magnox depleted uranium trioxide (July 2001) ===
A small amount of Magnox depleted uranium (MDU) leaked from some corroded mild steel drums due to rainwater ingress and leaching. MDU is a dense yellow powder that is less radiologically toxic than naturally occurring uranium but chemotoxic in a similar manner to lead. Owing to its high density and low solubility, it does not tend to disperse far and dry spills are easy to clean up. This material was stored at the larger sites, including Capenhurst in mild steel drums. BNFL upgraded the fabric of the building and the original drums were overpacked into stainless steel drums and dispatched to Capenhurst for long-term storage.

=== Dropped basket of irradiated fuel elements (July 2001) ===
During routine defuelling activities on Reactor 3, a basket containing 24 low-rated irradiated Magnox fuel elements fell a few feet within the discharge machine onto the door at the top of the fuel discharge well. Remote TV camera inspections revealed that twelve of the elements had fallen just over down the discharge well into a water-filled transport flask at the bottom. The NII initiated an investigation because dropping irradiated fuel elements is a serious issue even when, as in this event, BNFL had advised NII that there had been no release of radiological activity.

=== Charge pan movement relative to the core (September 2001) ===
Because of known shrinkage of the graphite moderator bricks in the core due to in-service irradiation effects, some of the steel charge pans on top of them had become dislocated from their design position in the interstitial channel and were suspended from the Burst Can Detection (BCD) pipework. This was most prevalent in Reactor 1 because of the different core design to Reactors 2, 3 and 4. BNFL were unable to make an adequate safety case or effect an economic repair and therefore, Reactor 1 did not return to power from its annual outage in August 2001. The core of Reactor 4 was repaired but this reactor did not return to power after the repair.

==Interim storage facility==
An interim storage facility for storing intermediate level radioactive waste from Chapelcross came into operation in 2021. Construction began in 2014 of the facility, which can store 700 waste packages for 120 years.

<text>Paul Anderson (born 1959) is a British journalist, author and academic. He is chiefly known as the editor of several political journals.

==Early life and education==
Anderson was born in Edinburgh, and grew up in Ipswich. He studied philosophy, politics and economics at Balliol College, Oxford (1978–1981) and journalism at the London College of Printing (1982–1983).

==Career==
Anderson was deputy editor of &quot;European Nuclear Disarmament Journal&quot; (1984–1987), reviews editor of &quot;Tribune&quot; (1986–1991), editor of &quot;Tribune&quot; (1991–1993), and deputy editor of the &quot;New Statesman&quot; (1993–1996), news editor of &quot;Red Pepper&quot; (1997–1999) and deputy editor of the &quot;New Times&quot; (1999–2000). Since 1999 Anderson has worked as a contract subeditor on a number of publications, including &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

Anderson is co-author with Nyta Mann of &quot;Safety First: The Making of New Labour&quot; (1997), an analysis of how the changes made by Neil Kinnock to Labour Party policies led to the development of New Labour under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. In a review in The Guardian the Labour MP Roy Hattersley praised &quot;Safety First&quot; for its detailed coverage of such issues as John Prescott&#x27;s transformation of ministerial governing, and the Party&#x27;s &quot;Euro- keynesianism,&quot; calling it the &quot;best&quot; book on New Labour. 
Anderson is also editor of &quot;Orwell in &quot;Tribune&quot;: &quot;As I Please&quot; and Other Writings&quot; (2006).

Anderson taught journalism at City University, London from 2000 to 2011 and subsequently at the University of Essex.

Anderson established book publisher Aaaargh! Press in 2012.

<doc id="1323091" wikidata="Q7715815" url="?curid=1323091" title="The Battery (Charleston)">
<text>The Battery is a landmark defensive seawall and promenade in Charleston, South Carolina. Named for a pre–Civil War coastal defense artillery battery originally built by the British at the site, it stretches along the lower shores of the Charleston peninsula, bordered by the Ashley and Cooper Rivers, which meet here to form Charleston Harbor.

==Location==
Historically, it has been understood to extend from the beginning of the seawall at the site of the former Omar Shrine Temple (40–44 East Bay Street) to the intersection of what is now Murray Boulevard and King Street. The higher part of the promenade, paralleling East Battery, as the street is known south of Water Street, to the intersection of Murray Boulevard, is known as High Battery. Fort Sumter is visible from the Cooper River side (High Battery) and from the point, as are Castle Pinckney, the World War II aircraft carrier USS Yorktown (CV-10), Fort Moultrie, and Sullivan&#x27;s Island.

In popular speech and in a number of unofficial guidebooks and Web sites, the Battery and White Point Garden are sometimes referred to as &quot;Battery Park,&quot; but the park and seawall promenade are not regarded by the City of Charleston as a single entity, and the term &quot;Battery Park&quot; is not an official designation.

==History==
Fort Broughton (ca. 1735) and Fort Wilkins (during the American Revolution and War of 1812) occupied White or Oyster Point, so named because of the piles of bleached oyster shells on the point at the tip of the peninsula. In the 18th century, rocks and heavy materials were used to fortify the shore of the Cooper River on the eastern side of the peninsula. In 1838, this area along the seawall became a promenade. First used as a public park in 1837, the area now known as White Point Garden became a place for artillery during the American Civil War.

Colleton Bastion was located near the intersection of Water and Meeting Streets. During the Siege of Charleston, the British had to contend with Fort Johnson, Broughton&#x27;s Battery, Dorrell&#x27;s Fort, Wilkins&#x27; Fort, and Gibbs&#x27; Fort (at the foot of King Street). During the Quasi-War Fort Mechanic (ca. 1795) stood where the current Edmondston-Alston House is now located. During the Civil War, Battery Ramsay occupied White Point Garden.

==Architecture==
As a tourist destination, the Battery is famous for its stately, mainly antebellum homes. Included among the grand houses are the Louis DeSaussure House (1 East Battery), the Roper House (9 East Battery), the William Ravenel House (13 East Battery), the Edmondston-Alston House (21 East Battery), the Charles Drayton House (25 East Battery), the George Chisolm House (39 East Battery), the Villa Margherita (4 South Battery), the William Washington House (8 South Battery), the Col. John A.S. Ashe House (26 South Battery), the James Spear House (30 South Battery), and the Col. John Ashe House (32 South Battery).
==The Battery today==

In 2004, a structural report by the City of Charleston showed that the Battery was suffering serious problems and could fail to protect the southeastern portion of the city during hurricanes. In 2012, the City announced that a $3.2 million restoration project would soon commence at the juncture of High Battery (along East Battery) and Low Battery (along Murray Blvd.).

In August 2023, Tropical Storm Idalia breached the Battery and flooded portions of the downtown.

<text>White Point Garden is a 5.7 acre public park located in peninsular Charleston, South Carolina, at the tip of the peninsula. It is the southern terminus for the Battery, a defensive seawall and promenade. It is bounded by East Battery (to the east), Murray Blvd. (to the south), King St. (to the west), and South Battery (to the north).

==History==
The southern tip of Charleston&#x27;s peninsula was originally known as the South Bay and later Oyster Point. In the early 19th century it was renamed White Point. Later, landfill projects resulted in the sharp-edged terminus of the peninsula.

From about 1840 to 1881, a public bathing house stood at the end of King Street. The building was constructed by James English, William Patton, and Henry L. Pinckney at a cost of about $25,000. A cake and ice cream parlor was operated on the top floor of the bathing house. The bathing house suffered several injuries by storms but was rebuilt each time. It was removed in 1881 as White Point Garden and the waterfront were filled in.

Throughout the 19th and early 20th century, from the Reconstruction era to the emergence of Jim Crow laws, Black Charlestonians occupied public spaces like White Point Garden on Independence Day to celebrate freedom from slavery. On any other day it was not permitted for blacks to enter the public park, and they were not allowed to sit on public benches.

White Point Gardens was commonly known as a gay cruising spot by Charlestonians well into the 20th century. Because of the prominence of gay cruising in the public park, efforts were made to close down the public restrooms.

==Features==

For more than a century, White Point Garden has been a repository of relics and memorials, with a largely military theme.

In July 1897, two 10-inch columbiads that had been stored at Fort Sumter after the American Civil War, were given by the federal government to a park in Kokomo, Indiana, for use as ornamentation. It was unknown whether the particular guns had actually been in service during the Civil War. On July 30, 1897, an opinion piece appeared in the &quot;Charleston Evening Post&quot; in response to the news of the giveaway to Kokomo that suggested that the remaining guns at Fort Sumter (perhaps twenty) be secured for use in Charleston&#x27;s own parks. Later that year, Charleston&#x27;s City Council voted in favor (with one vote in opposition) to request the balance of the guns from the United States War Department. The War Department eventually loaned ten guns to Charleston. Some were put on display at the then-Thomson Auditorium temporarily, while two of the guns from USS &quot;Keokuk&quot; were installed at White Point Garden in 1900. &quot;Keokuk&quot; was sunk by Charleston&#x27;s forts in April 1863; the Confederates later salvaged and used these guns.

Placed at irregular intervals around three sides of the perimeter of White Point Garden are several military relics. Along East Battery are the 11-inch Dahlgren gun from the USS &quot;Keokuk&quot; that fired shells at Fort Sumter in 1863 and two Confederate columbiads (large cannons) that were used in the defense of Fort Sumter. On Murray Blvd. there are several more artillery pieces: a rare 7-inch Brooke rifle (a large cannon) that was found at Fort Johnson and four 13-inch Union mortars (weighing 17,000 pounds each). On the King St. side are a 1918 World War I howitzer; a French cannon of Revolutionary War vintage that was found in Camden, South Carolina; and a rapid-fire gun from a Spanish ship captured during the Spanish–American War.

Among the many cannon on display is one fake. In the early 1900s, a 4-pound British cannon thought to be of the colonial era was lodged halfway into the middle of Longitude Alley, supposedly to prevent dray carriages from using the narrow passage. In 1933, the City decided to unearth the cannon and relocate it in White Point Garden at the intersection of a projected Church Street extension and Murray Blvd. The residents of Longitude Lane were unhappy at the loss of their relic, and demanded its return, but the City was not moved. Meanwhile, a prankster hired a foundry to create a fake cannon of the same era. He aged the cannon by submerging it in water for six months at his dock and then sold it to an antique store in Beaufort, South Carolina. When it was &quot;discovered&quot; there, it was bought by a visitor from the North and brought to Charleston. The buyer offered it to the residents of Longitude Lane to replace their cannon, but they rejected the offer, instead demanding the original cannon. The City, however, believed the cannon to be genuine and acquired it for display too. The cannon fooled many people, but it suffered a telltale anachronism: because the foundry did not have the tools to fabricate an actual cannon, the foundry instead poured molten metal around a section of cast iron pipe even though cast iron pipe was not used even in large cities until the 19th century. The Longitude Alley cannon stood across the park at the intersection of Church St. and South Battery; it was removed by the City following vandalism (possibly an attempted theft) and then either lost or stolen. It has not been seen since.

Along the center walkway in line with Church St. is &quot;The Defenders of Fort Moultrie&quot;, honoring South Carolinian soldiers during the Battle of Sullivan&#x27;s Island. It is often called the Jasper Monument since it shows a statue of Sergeant William Jasper, a hero of the Revolutionary War battle won by the colonists at Fort Moultrie on Sullivan&#x27;s Island on June 28, 1776. The memorial was added in 1877.

At the northeast corner is a marker, erected in 1943, to the Gentleman Pirate Stede Bonnet. The monument commemorates the hanging near that site of pirate captain Stede Bonnet and his crew in 1718, as well as the 1719 hanging of Richard Worley&#x27;s pirates. The monument states that 29 of Bonnet&#x27;s crew were executed close by. Although 29 of Bonnet&#x27;s crew were sentenced to death, the evidence suggests that only 22 were actually hanged.

Located across from Meeting Street in the center of the park, a bandstand, begun in 1906 and completed in 1907, is a memorial to Mrs. George W. Williams by her daughter, Mrs. Martha W. Carrington. The bandstand, designed by William Martin Aiken and built by Robert McArtney, cost more than $5,000 when it was built and hosted regular concerts. The new bandstand replaced a dilapidated wood structure. The inaugural concert for the new bandstand was held on June 28, 1907 to celebrate Carolina Day with music by Metz&#x27;s Military Band. 
In 1978, in response to neighbors about noise and commercial activity, concerts were outlawed at the bandstand. In 1985, the bandstand received a $30,000 restoration (including $8,000 in private funds), and a request was made to resume musical performances. The request was rejected, and although the bandstand is used for weddings and limited special events, concerts are not allowed. In 1934, the pavilion was raised three feet and restrooms were installed under the structure. Because of law enforcement issues, the bathrooms were locked at some point. In 2008, the City announced a plan to restore the bandstand and lower it to its original height of three instead of six feet. The restoration was completed in April, 2010.

In 1962, Charleston sculptor Willard Hirsch was commissioned by Miss Sally Carrington to create a bronze statue of a dancing girl. The statue was a gift to the City and was installed as a water fountain in White Point Garden on an especially low granite base so that children could make easy use of it.

Among the military relics on display was once the capstan of the USS &quot;Maine&quot;. The capstan was salvaged from the &quot;Maine&quot; when it was raised from the bottom of Havana Harbor, and its parts were meted out to communities all over the country. The capstan was donated to Charleston by Sen. Ben Tillman but sat in the basement of City Hall for several years before being installed in Hampton Park. Later, the capstan was relocated to the U.S. Navy Base and then later to White Point Garden. It was displayed atop a concrete base on the eastern edge of the park. In 2007, the capstan was removed, and a statue of William Moultrie was installed in the same location. The 8-foot statue, atop a 7-foot pedestal, depicts a uniformed Moultrie, sword in sheath, holding his hat at his side as he appears to survey Charleston Harbor. It was sculpted by John Ney Michel. 
 
At the southeastern corner of White Point Garden is a large allegorical statue installed in 1932 by the United Daughters of the Confederacy. The monument titled, &quot;Confederate Defenders of Charleston&quot;, commemorates the soldiers who fought for their city and the southern States during the Civil War. The bronze statue is 12 feet tall and rests on a granite base 13 feet tall. The sculptor was Hermon Atkins MacNeil.

Near the southwest corner of the park is a memorial to the crew of the USS &quot;Amberjack&quot;, a submarine that was sunk during World War II, and 51 other American subs lost during the conflict.

Also located near the southwest corner of the park is the 20-foot tall, granite Hobson Monument. On April 26, 1952, the U.S. destroyer &quot;Hobson&quot; was cut in half and sunk after being in a collision with the American aircraft carrier &quot;Wasp&quot;. The stones used in the platform come from the 38 home states of the 176 sailors who died. The &quot;Hobson&quot; was built at the Charleston Navy Yard.

At the meeting of Meeting St. and South Battery is a memorial to the crew of the &quot;H.L. Hunley&quot;. Added in 1899, the granite monument recognizes the first successful submarine, the &quot;Hunley&quot;, which eventually sank in Charleston Harbor following a successful attack on the USS &quot;Housatonic&quot;.

Along the center walkway in the park, halfway between Church and Meeting, is a bronze bust, atop a granite column, of William Gilmore Simms (1806-1870), a poet, novelist, and historian, whose history of South Carolina served as the definitive textbook on state history for much of the 20th century. Sculpted by John Quincy Adams Ward, the monument was added in 1879. The base for the bust was designed by Edward Brickell White.

<text>Timothy James McIlrath (born November 3, 1978) is an American rock musician. He is the lead singer, rhythm guitarist, songwriter and co-founder of the punk rock band Rise Against. He is vegetarian and straight edge.

==Early and personal life==
McIlrath was born in 1978 to Jim and Michelle McIlrath. He attended Rolling Meadows High School in Rolling Meadows, Illinois. In college (Northeastern Illinois University), McIlrath majored in English and Sociology. In his junior year, he met Joe Principe at a Sick of It All concert. Principe asked McIlrath to sing over a few tracks that he and Dan Wleklinski had recorded. It was at this time that Transistor Revolt was formed. McIlrath left college after Transistor Revolt was signed onto Fat Wreck Chords in 1999. In the fall of 2020, McIlrath returned to college to finish his Sociology degree.

McIlrath has a condition called heterochromia, where his left eye is blue and his right eye is hazel.

==Music career==
===Baxter (1995–1999)===

McIlrath began his musical career in his teens and was active in the Chicago local punk rock scene. His first band was the post-hardcore band Baxter, formed in 1995 along with future Lawrence Arms drummer Neil Hennessy and future Killing Tree and Holy Roman Empire bassist Geoff Reu.
Their first release was a full-length, self-released cassette, &quot;Troy&#x27;s Bucket&quot;, which was released in 1996. &quot;Troy&#x27;s Bucket&quot; was met with a warm reception from the scene, and Baxter became a popular band in the Chicago underground scene.

In 1997, they released a 7-inch EP, &quot;Lost Voices&quot;, on Static Station Records. After some local touring, the band split up.

McIlrath played bass and sang backup in the first incarnation of the Honor System. He sang one song on their demo. He and drummer Neil Hennesy were also in a brief lineup of the grindcore band Yellow Road Priest, whose members went on to form Pelican. The band broke up in 1999.

===Arma Angelus (1998–1999)===

McIlrath joined the band Arma Angelus, a Chicago metalcore band fronted by Pete Wentz, who would later be bassist in the pop punk band Fall Out Boy. McIlrath played bass in the band until 1999 when he quit to form Transistor Revolt, which became Rise Against, and the Killing Tree.

===Rise Against (1999–present)===


In 1999, Tim McIlrath formed the band that would become Rise Against with former 88 Fingers Louie bassist, Joe Principe, guitarist Dan Precision (A.K.A. Mr. Precision), and drummer Toni Tintari under the name Transistor Revolt. Drummer Brandon Barnes did not join until 2001; it was at the same time the band was renamed Rise Against. They officially recorded their debut album, &quot;The Unraveling&quot;, on Fat Wreck Chords in 2001.

In 2002 guitarist Mr. Precision left due to arguments with the band, and Todd Mohney filled his role. Later that year they released their second album, &quot;Revolutions per Minute&quot;, which was greeted with warm success. They toured the U.S. steadily that year, though by the end of it, Mohney left. In order to replace him, former Reach the Sky guitarist Chris Chasse joined in 2004 and they released their Geffen debut &quot;Siren Song of the Counter Culture&quot;.

With the release of the singles &quot;Give It All&quot;, &quot;Swing Life Away&quot;, and &quot;Life Less Frightening&quot;, Rise Against became more popular with mainstream fans, but still kept their underground sensibility. After more touring (including a European tour and spots on the Vans Warped tour), the band went back to the studio and recorded their fourth album, &quot;The Sufferer &amp; the Witness&quot;, which included four singles (&quot;Ready to Fall&quot;, &quot;Prayer of the Refugee&quot;, &quot;The Good Left Undone&quot;, and &quot;Behind Closed Doors&quot;).

As of 2021, McIlrath has recorded nine studio albums with Rise Against (&quot;The Unraveling&quot;, &quot;Revolutions per Minute&quot;, &quot;Siren Song of the Counter Culture&quot;, &quot;The Sufferer &amp; the Witness&quot;, &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot;, &quot;Endgame&quot;, &quot;The Black Market&quot;, &quot;Wolves&quot; and &quot;Nowhere Generation&quot;), as well as a compilation album (&quot;The Ghost Note Symphonies, Vol. 1&quot;) and EP (&quot;Nowhere Generation II&quot;), and has remained as the main lyricist of the band.

===The Killing Tree (1999–2006)===

McIlrath has played in his metalcore side project the Killing Tree along with former Rise Against guitarist Todd Mohney and former Baxter and Holy Roman Empire bassist, Geoff Reu. During the early years of the band, all members used pseudonyms (Tim&#x27;s being James Kaspar) out of concern for it. The Killing Tree has not produced any music or toured since 2004, but contributed their previously unreleased song &quot;Dressed to Fuck&quot; to the 2006 Thick Records compilation album &quot;Hair: Chicago Punk Cuts&quot;, which featured Emily Schambra (of Holy Roman Empire) on guest vocals on the song. Schambra also contributed backing vocals on Rise Against&#x27;s album &quot;The Sufferer &amp; the Witness&quot; for the songs &quot;The Approaching Curve&quot;, &quot;Roadside&quot;, and the b-side &quot;But Tonight We Dance&quot;.

== Activism ==
When the band first began, McIlrath stated how they weren&#x27;t seeking to gather such a large audience in their pursuit for originality, and this defined them as the &quot;black sheep&quot; of punk rock. The original goal of the band was only to create music, never seen as a long-term group until the band came to a realization of similar activist beliefs that led McIlrath to describe music as a vessel for change. These beliefs started to get integrated into the music most prominently after the release of &quot;The Sufferer &amp; The Witness,&quot; when McIlrath said that he sought to make a difference in the world he lives in as opposed to being one of the bands in the punk/hardcore scene today that are[n&#x27;t] saying anything important&quot;.

=== Political lyrics ===
Having not grown up in a political family, McIlrath says that he was never particularly involved until he began playing punk rock. After entering the music scene, though, he began to feel a strong connection towards his convictions, specifically animal and human rights. While not all of Rise Against&#x27;s material is political, songs such as &quot;Swing Life Away&quot; and &quot;Make It Stop&quot; have risen to prominence as McIlrath seeks to speak to a generation that he believes is lacking conviction towards their world, as explained throughout the storytelling narrative of the band&#x27;s albums. The band has begun to seek after more politically and socially challenging lyrics as time progresses, responding to current events such as the song &quot;Help Is On The Way&quot; and its use of support for victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.

=== PETA ===
McIlrath became a vegetarian at the age of eighteen as a result of his own understanding of the meat-industry as opposed to having it &quot;shoved [...] down my throat&quot;. The realization of PETA, an animal rights support group, came through the music scene and McIlrath&#x27;s own realization of the events that occur within meat-processing and inhumane conditions that animals are forced to live in. As time went on, these beliefs got integrated into his lyric writing such as Rise Against video for the single &quot;Ready to Fall&quot; contains footage of factory farming, rodeos, and sport hunting, as well as deforestation, melting ice-caps, and forest fires. The group has called the video the most important video they have ever made. In February 2012 the band released a cover of the Bob Dylan song &quot;Ballad of Hollis Brown&quot; as part of a benefit for Amnesty International. After the release of the film &quot;Black Fish&quot;, McIlrath worked with PETA to create a video in support of releasing animals in captivity, exclaiming how &quot;I make a choice every time I go out on stage, I choose to perform. Animals in captivity don&#x27;t get to make that choice&quot;.

=== Straight edge ideals ===
McIlrath, along with most of the rest of Rise Against, follows the subculture ideology of &quot;straight edge&quot;, a belief that promotes refraining from using alcohol, tobacco and other recreational drugs, in a reaction to the excesses of punk subculture.

<text>Ógra Fianna Fáil(; meaning &quot;Youth of Fianna Fáil&quot;) is the youth wing of Fianna Fáil.

The organisation was founded in 1975 by party leader Jack Lynch under the guidance of party general secretary, Séamus Brennan. It is active on an all-Ireland basis, with branches in major third level institutes (called cumainn) and parliamentary constituencies (called Comhairle Dáil Cheantair) in the Republic of Ireland. In Northern Ireland it is organised on a Council District basis, along with third level branches at the University of Ulster and Queen&#x27;s University Belfast. In October 2014 Ógra became an official full member organisation of European Liberal Youth at their annual congress in Berlin.

==President==
From the inception of the organisation until 2011 Ógra was chaired by the youngest member of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party. Since 2011 Ógra have elected a president of the organisation. The first president of Ógra was Eamon Quinlan, who later became mayor of Waterford City in 2015.

In 2013 Blackrock&#x27;s Kate Feeney was elected as the first female leader of Ógra. She is a daughter of former senator Geraldine Feeney and was elected to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council while president of Ógra in 2014.

Eoin Neylon won the election for president of Ógra two years in a row, in both 2014 and 2015.

James Doyle of Dublin Fingal was elected to the office in November 2016, serving one term. Dún Laoghaire&#x27;s Ian Woods was elected to the role in March 2018.

Lawrencetown native Tom Cahill was elected as President (Uachtarán) in November 2019. He was replaced by Bryan Mallon in March 2021. On 20 December 2021 a motion to remove Mallon as president received 62% of support from members, but failed to reach the required 66.7% for it to pass, and so he was not removed from office.

==Organisation==
Ógra Fianna Fáil is organised across all the 32 counties of Ireland, maintaining a presence in most local communities and Third Level institutes. Within Ógra Fianna Fáil there four different types of units that can be formed: &quot;Ógra Comhairle Dáil Ceantair&quot; (CDC) in the Republic of Ireland, Council District Constituency (CDC) in Northern Ireland, &quot;Ógra Comhairle Ceantair&quot; (CC), Ógra Third Level Cumann, and &quot;Ógra Coiste Áitiúil&quot;. The three governing bodies of Ógra Fianna Fáil are the National Youth Conference, Ógra Central Officer Board and Ógra National Council.
*Ógra Comhairle Dáil Ceantair (Ógra CDC) – The Ógra CDC covers the area of the Dáil constituency as set out by the Constituencies Commission, or in some cases where a constituency crosses a County border; it covers the area of that County.
*Ógra Council District Constituency (CDC) - The Ógra CDC covers the area of the Local government in Northern Ireland. They have the same status as Comhairle Dáil Ceantair within the organisation.
*Ógra Comhairle Ceantair (Ógra CC) – This type of unit is smaller than an Ógra CDC, it only includes the Ógra members who are in a particular part of the constituency, most likely a local electoral area (LEA). Ógra CC members may also be members of a Third Level Cumann and an Ógra CDC.
*Ógra Third Level Cumann – Most higher education institutions have an Ógra Fianna Fáil Cumann. These branches generally have similar status to an Ógra CDC.
*Ógra Coiste Áitiúil – Ógra members in a particular local area are encouraged to form local units to allow the local members to come together to discuss issues and to organise events to promote Fianna Fáil. This form of Ógra unit was instigated to support the organisation in places where may not be practical or possible for Ógra members to travel long distances to Ógra CC or CDC meetings, or not possible to establish an Ógra CC.
*Ógra National Youth Conference (NYC) – The National Youth Conference is the supreme decision-making body of Ógra. The conference takes place every 12–18 months with the venue being decided by interested units presenting their bids to the delegates at National Council. The location for the NYC is rotated between each of the regions: Connacht, Leinster, Dublin, Ulster and Munster. The Conference gives the young members of Fianna Fáil a forum to express their views and opinions and develop national policies. All votes for policy motions and COB positions are carried out via One Member One Vote (OMOV).
*Ógra Central Officer Board (COB) – The Central Officer Board is responsible for the management of Ógra. It consists of a President, Policy Director, Campaigns and Events Director, Membership and Recruitment Director, International Officer, Irish and Cultural Officer, Equality &amp; Educational Officer, five Regional Organisers, Press Officer(s) and the National Youth Officer.
*Ógra National Council (NC) – The National Council provides oversight to the work of the Central Officer Board. Meetings are usually held every 8–12 weeks. All members of the organisation are entitled to attend meetings. Unlike the NYC, National Council functions under a delegate system where every registered Ógra CDC and Third Level Cumann is entitled to send 3 delegates (at least 1 man and 1 woman) to National Council to vote on behalf of their CDC or cumann. These delegates can hold the COB to account, debate policy and submit and vote on motions.

==Third level branches==
===Kevin Barry Cumann – University College Dublin===
The Kevin Barry Cumann is the branch in University College Dublin (UCD). The cumann predates the founding of Ógra Fianna Fáil which was established in 1956. It formally dates to 1957 when led by Gerry Collins, then a student organiser in UCD and later Minister for Foreign Affairs. It is named after UCD student and Irish revolutionary Kevin Barry.

Former members include former European Commissioner Charlie McCreevy, previous ministers Dick Roche and Mary Coughlan, Donegal TD Charlie McConalogue and RTÉ presenter Ryan Tubridy. The author and former political lobbyist Frank Dunlop was also a member.

Malcolm Byrne is a former secretary of the Kevin Barry Cumann. 

The Cumann is the current holders of the Gobnait O&#x27;Connell award after the 2023 Cork National Youth Conference.

===Pádraig Pearse Cumann – Dublin City University===
The Dublin City University branch is the Pádraig Pearse Cumann, commonly known as The PPC. At the Fianna Fáil National Youth Conference in Roscommon in 2018, it was awarded best delegation.

===Donogh O&#x27;Malley Cumann – University College Cork===
The Donogh O&#x27;Malley Cumann is the University College Cork branch of Ógra. Founded in 1967, its first AGM was chaired by Jack Lynch. Former members of the cumann include the current leader of the party Tánaiste Micheál Martin, European Commissioner Michael McGrath (Irish politician), Minister for Education Norma Foley and Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee.

As of 2021, they held the joint record for the most Gobnait O&#x27;Connell Awards (awards given to the best Ógra branch) won with 4 in the years 2001, 2015, 2019 and 2021. They also hold the joint record for most Gobnait O’Connell Awards won consecutively which is 2 in a row.

===Wolfe Tone Cumann – Trinity College Dublin===
The Trinity College Dublin (TCD) branch is named in honor of Irish revolutionary and Trinity graduate, Theobald Wolfe Tone. The Cumann was officially constituted in 1967 and was initially named after Erskine Childers. In 1998 the cumann was renamed the Wolfe Tone Cumann, to mark the bicentenary of the 1798 Rebellion. It has a long history of activism within Ógra on a national basis. Past members include; Thomas Byrne, Seán Haughey, Jack Chambers, James Lawless, Mary Harney, Mary Lou McDonald and Dara Calleary.

===Cumann De Barra – University of Galway===
Cumann De Barra is the branch in the University of Galway (UG). Meetings were held off campus for many years before it was officially recognised by university authorities and allowed to host itself as an official society of the university in 1954. Like its sister Cumann in University College Dublin (UCD), it is also named after Kevin Barry, a medical student at UCD who fought and was executed during the Irish War of Independence. To avoid confusion however, it officially changed its name to the Irish language version to reflect UG&#x27;s reputation as the Irish language university.

Notable former members include former Fianna Fáil TD Michael P. Kitt, the President of Ireland Michael D. Higgins (before he joined the Labour Party), Senator Terry Leyden, Senator Lisa Chambers and former MEP Seán Ó Neachtain.

===Other third level branches===

*Atlantic Technological University Sligo Cumann
*Atlantic Technological University Galway-Mayo – Sean Mulvoy Cumann
*Dundalk Institute of Technology Cumann
*Maynooth University – Seán Lemass Cumann

<text>Joseph Daniel Principe (; born November 14, 1974) is an American musician. He is the bassist, backing vocalist, and co-founder of the punk rock band Rise Against.

He is also straight edge, a vegan, an animal rights advocate, and actively promotes PETA with his band.

== Early life ==
Principe began his musical career at age 15, learning to play by ear and influenced during his formative years by Bad Religion, Minor Threat, Bad Brains, the Descendents, Bill Swerski and other like minded bands. Principe attended Holy Cross High School in River Grove, Illinois.

== Career ==

=== 88 Fingers Louie (1993–1999) ===
In 1993, Principe formed the Chicago punk band 88 Fingers Louie with Dom Vallone, Mr. Precision, and Denis Buckley. The band were together for six years of touring and releasing records (Go Away, Wanted, Totin&#x27; 40&#x27;s &amp; Fuckin&#x27; Shit Up, Behind Bars, 88 Fingers Up Your Ass, The Dom Years, The Teacher Gets It, Back On The Streets, 88 Fingers Louie/Kid Dynamite). In 1999, tensions formed within the band, and the members decided to break up and go their separate ways.

=== Rise Against (1999–present) ===

Shortly after the breakup with 88 Fingers Louie, Principe met future bandmate and friend Tim McIlrath at a Sick of It All concert. Principe asked McIlrath to sing over a few tracks that he and former 88 Fingers Louie guitarist Mr. Precision had recorded. It was then McIlrath agreed to form the band. They later met up with drummer Toni Tintari and formed the band as &quot;Transistor Revolt&quot;, the band&#x27;s original name before changing it to &quot;Rise Against&quot;.

In 2000, they released the self-titled demo, &quot;Transistor Revolt&quot;. Tintari left the band in the fall of that year before the recording of their full-length album. He was later replaced by Brandon Barnes of &quot;Pinhead Circus&quot;. The band then signed with independent record label Fat Wreck Chords in 2001. They then released their debut album &quot;The Unraveling&quot; and spent the rest of the year touring. In 2002, Mr. Precision left and was replaced by Todd Mohney. The band returned to the studio in December 2002 to work on their second full-length album, &quot;Revolutions per Minute&quot; in 2003 and toured for the 2003 Warped Tour, which gained the band some success. Rise Against then signed to Dreamworks Records in late 2003 to begin the recording of their third record, but Dreamworks was shortly absorbed by the Universal Music Group, and Rise Against found itself with Major label Geffen Records. Todd Mohney, the band&#x27;s guitarist at the time, left and was replaced by Chris Chasse and began the recording of their new album &quot;Siren Song of the Counter Culture&quot;. &quot;Siren Song of the Counter Culture&quot; was released on August 10, 2004, peaking at number 136 on the Billboard 200 album charts, gaining the band major critical and commercial success with the singles &quot;Give It All, &quot;Swing Life Away&quot;, and &quot;Life Less Frightening&quot;.

The band re-entered the studio in January 2006, after touring in support of Siren Song of the Counter Culture, and recorded their fourth studio album at the Blasting Room studio in Fort Collins, Colorado with producers Bill Stevenson and Jason Livermore. &quot;The Sufferer &amp; the Witness&quot; was released on July 4, 2006, peaking at number 10 on the Billboard 200 and received generally positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success along with their singles &quot;Ready to Fall&quot;, &quot;Prayer of the Refugee&quot; and &quot;The Good Left Undone&quot;. Rise Against toured in support of The Sufferer &amp; the Witness throughout the second half of 2006 and all of 2007. The band was a headliner in the 2006 Warped Tour as part of The Sufferer &amp; the Witness Tour. In late 2006, the band co-headlined a tour with Thursday that included the bands Circa Survive and Billy Talent. &quot;The Sufferer &amp; the Witness&quot; has less of the hardcore punk feel from the band&#x27;s previous albums. In 2007, Chasse decided to leave the band and was replaced by longtime friend Zach Blair from Only Crime. During this tour, on July 3, 2007, Rise Against released an EP in Canada titled &quot;This Is Noise&quot;, which was subsequently released in the United States on January 15, 2008.

Rise Against&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot;, was released in October through DGC/Interscope. The album sold 64,700 copies in its first week and peaked at number 3 on the Billboard 200, making it Rise Against&#x27;s highest-charting album to date at the time. Appeal to Reason was met with generally positive reviews, with its singles Re-Education (Through Labor), Audience of One, and Savior. Rise Against embarked on a North American tour with bands Rancid, Billy Talent, Killswitch Engage, and Riverboat Gamblers in June and July 2009.

After touring for almost two years, Rise Against had begun recording their sixth studio album for a 2011 release, at the Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado. Rise Against announced two South American shows in Brazil and Argentina and a run of European shows in late February and March 2011, respectively. &quot;Endgame&quot; was released on March 11, 2011, in the United States peaking at number 2 on The Billboard 200, receiving positive reviews from critics and commercial success. Rise Against have since earned several gold and platinum records in the United States and Canada throughout their career.

== Personal life ==

Prior to World War I, &quot;Burrows&quot; was attached to the Torpedo Flotilla, Atlantic Fleet, and operated along the east coast and in Cuban waters, performing tactical maneuvers, war games, torpedo practice, and gunnery. Early in 1916, &quot;Burrows&quot; was assigned to the Neutrality Patrol in the Staten Island–Long Island area of New York. When the United States entered World War I, &quot;Burrows&quot; patrolled the Lower Harbor, New York. On 7 April 1917, she reported to Commander, Squadron 2, Patrol Force, and carried out an unfruitful search for a German raider reported in the vicinity of Nantucket, Massachusetts. On 10 April, she was detached from Squadron 2 and reported to Philadelphia Navy Yard, where she was fitted out for distant service.

In June, she sailed from New York with Group 2, Cruiser and Transport Force, to escort the convoy which carried the first American Expeditionary Force to reach France. She arrived in the Loire River on 27 June 1917, and was assigned to patrol the south coast of Ireland, operating out of Queenstown, Ireland. &quot;Burrows&quot; patrolled; escorted convoys; answered Allied distress calls; landed survivors; and fought enemy submarines that hunted in the English Channel. On one occasion, she was in trouble with a broken oil line, which caused a fire on board. Four other destroyers assisted her in putting it out, but two crew members lost their lives. With the cessation of hostilities, she performed various duties at Brest, France, and was present at the reception of President Woodrow Wilson on 13 December 1918, when and escort arrived.

&quot;Burrows&quot; arrived at Philadelphia on 2 January 1919. She operated along the eastern seaboard for several months, and in June reported to Philadelphia Navy Yard. &quot;Burrows&quot; was decommissioned on 12 December 1919.

==United States Coast Guard==
In June 1924, she was transferred to the Treasury Department for use by the Coast Guard. She was based in New London, Connecticut as part of the Rum Patrol.

&quot;Burrows&quot; was returned to the Navy on 2 May 1931. &quot;Burrows&quot; was later scrapped in accordance with the London Naval Treaty.

<text>Magnús Örn Eyjólfsson Scheving (; born 10 November 1964) is an Icelandic writer, television producer, entrepreneur, actor, and former athlete. He is best known as the creator of the children&#x27;s television show &quot;LazyTown&quot;, on which he served as a producer, director, and portrayed the character Sportacus. A two time European champion in aerobic gymnastics, he was named the Icelandic Sportsperson of the Year in 1994.

==Early life and childhood==
Magnús Scheving was born on 10 of November 1964, to Þórveig Hjartardóttir and Eyjólfur Magnússon Scheving. He grew up in the small Icelandic town of Borgarnes. At 15 years old, he had his first job as a telephone exchange messenger for Borgarnes.

His knowledge in both architecture and carpentry allowed him to build his own house later on, which he described as &quot;physically...[laying] every brick and roof tile.&quot;

In his twenties, he made a bet with a woodworking friend, Fjölnir Þorgeirsson, that either would master a sport of the other&#x27;s choosing (that they knew nothing about) within three years. Magnús chose snooker for Fjölnir, and Fjölnir chose aerobics for Magnús. Eventually, Magnús became a national champion in aerobics, and Fjölnir became a national champion in snooker. He has an older sister and a younger brother.

== Early career and inspiration==
In 1992, Magnús became the Icelandic Men&#x27;s Individual Champion in aerobic gymnastics. In 1993, he became the Scandinavian champion, and was the European champion twice in 1994 and 1995. He competed at the FIG &quot;Suzuki World Cup&quot; three times and won bronze in 1993, silver in 1994 and placed fifth in 1995. He was named the Icelandic Sportsperson of the Year in 1994.

In addition to his sports career, Magnús became a well-known and sought after public and motivational speaker around the world. In 1995, he published a children&#x27;s book called &quot;Áfram Latibær&quot;, the first recorded work in the LazyTown franchise. During this time, he was also running a carpentry business, which gave him the money to travel the world.

==&quot;LazyTown&quot;==

In the 1990s, during his public speaking and aerobics career, Magnús noticed an absence in healthy lifestyle role models for children. In a 2019 talk, he recalled,I realized, thirty years ago actually, there was no role model in health for kids. There was Popeye, who eats spinach, but he smoked and hit people. And you thought, maybe that&#x27;s not a good role model. Maybe we need a different role model for kids. And there was no entertainment brand dedicated to kids&#x27; health in the world.In 1995, he published &quot;Áfram Latibær&quot;, an Icelandic children&#x27;s book which told a narrative story about a sports elf giving townsfolk tips on how to eat healthily and exercise. The book was adapted into a stage play of the same name directed by Baltasar Kormákur. The show toured Iceland from 1996–1997 and made &quot;LazyTown&quot; a household name across Iceland. It was shown to be immensely popular among children and so, a sequel was written, &quot;Glanni Glæpur Í Latabæ,&quot; which was the first time Robbie Rotten was introduced, played by Stefán Karl Stefánsson.

&quot;LazyTown&quot; was commissioned by Nickelodeon in May 2003 and the first episode aired on Nick Jr. on August 16, 2004.

Magnús is the creator and co-founder of LazyTown Entertainment. This company produces books, videos, games, and sporting goods to help promote fitness and a healthy lifestyle to children. He is also creator of the show &quot;LazyTown&quot; (&quot;Latibær&quot; in Iceland), where he played Sportacus (known as Íþróttaálfurinn in Icelandic) from 2004 to 2014.

In 2006, Magnús received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Icelandic Edda Award ceremonies for his work as founder and creator of the &quot;LazyTown&quot; franchise. Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, President of Iceland, presented the award to him.

After LazyTown Entertainment was bought by Turner Broadcasting in the summer of 2011, Magnús continued to play Sportacus. However, in 2014, he announced that he would be departing the role of Sportacus (after the end of the TV series), passing it on to Dýri Kristjánsson, who played Sportacus in all subsequent live shows. He also announced in 2014 that he would depart from his position as CEO of LazyTown Entertainment.

On May 16, 2024, it was announced that Magnús Scheving had agreed to a deal with Warner Bros. Discovery to purchase back the company and the rights to the &quot;LazyTown&quot; brand.

=== Theme park ===
In 2021, Magnús and entrepreneur Helga Halldórsdóttir announced their goal to build a &quot;LazyTown&quot; theme park in Magnús&#x27;s hometown of Borgarnes, which inspired the series. They claimed the project has been ongoing since 2017. Magnús described the plans to create an &quot;experience garden&quot; with indoor and outdoor facilities, both pertaining to the production history and the history of Borgarnes. Borgarnes legislation supported this due to its ability to welcome tourists; 35 thousand visitors are expected in its first year, followed by 50 thousand in the next 4 years. The park is expected to open by 2024.

=== April 1st hoax ===
On April 1, 2022, Magnús appeared in Icelandic Crossfit athlete Björgvin K. Guðmundsson&#x27;s facetious Instagram announcement, wherein a LazyTown &quot;full length motion picture&quot; and &quot;brand new series&quot; was announced. The photographs showed the pair signing contracts and shaking hands before large posters of LazyTown characters and memorabilia. Björgvin announced that he was quitting crossfit in pursuit of professional acting, being specifically trained in song and dance to portray Sportacus. Due to its posting date and Björgvin&#x27;s continued career in crossfit, the announcement was an April Fools&#x27; Day hoax.

==Other projects==
In 2010, Magnús co-starred in the Jackie Chan film &quot;The Spy Next Door,&quot; in which he portrayed a Russian villain attempting to destroy the world&#x27;s oil supplies.

In November 2022, Magnús spoke at the World Business Forum in New York City on the topic of &quot;great ideas&quot; and creativity. Later that week, he spoke at the WBF in Bogotá, Colombia on November 9 or 10, on the topic of high performance teams. While in Colombia, Magnús encountered an enthusiastic Sportacus cosplayer.

=== ROK restaurant ===
Since mid-2016, along with his partner, Hrefna Björk Sverrisdóttir, he has owned and managed ROK restaurant, a &quot;fine casual&quot; Icelandic restaurant in Reykjavík. The restaurant offers Icelandic staples including reindeer steak, local cheeses, and char. The menu has a &quot;Green&quot; section devoted to vegetarian options, and its dishes incorporates Scandinavian, Mediterranean and American elements.

In 2017, food critic Ragnar Egilsson gave the food a mediocre review, claiming the restaurant&#x27;s success was due to its proximity to Hallgrímskirkja, a tourist destination.

In 2018, ROK was included in &quot;Iceland Monitor&quot;&#x27;s list of the best happy hours in Reykjavík. As of 2019, the menu has expanded to include vegan options.

==Filmography==


==Personal life==
In 1989, Magnús married Ragnheiður Melsteð, with whom he lived for 24 years and co-founded the &quot;LazyTown&quot; production company. Magnús and Ragnheiður have a daughter and a son. The couple divorced in 2014. Their daughter, Sylvia Erla, is a singer who reached the semi-finals of the Söngvakeppnin in 2013, but did not make it to the final. Magnús also has a daughter with his former partner, Halldóra Blöndall.

In January 2017, Magnús got engaged to Hrefna Björk Sverrisdóttir in their restaurant ROK. The couple married in 2020. In December 2022, Hrefna announced the birth of their son on her Instagram page.

==Production work==
== Awards and accolades ==

* PROTOS Award: Universidad de Panamericana in Mexico City

* BAFTA International Children&#x27;s Award (2006) for &quot;LazyTown&quot; in collaboration with Raymond P. Le Gué and Jonathan Judge

In 2022, he appeared as a contestant on the fourteenth series of &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; and was partnered with Vanessa Bauer. Cole reached the final and placed second.

===&quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; (NZ)===
Cole has judged New Zealand&#x27;s version of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, 2005–2009. In the years when Craig Revel Horwood was one of the other judges the two men&#x27;s opinions and scores were frequently markedly different.

Cole appeared in the first 15 series BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, until announcing in January 2018 that his contract had not been renewed.

In the 2004 debut series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, Cole&#x27;s celebrity partner was BBC newsreader and presenter Natasha Kaplinsky. They went on to win the show.

In the second series, he was partnered with &quot;Casualty&quot; actress Sarah Manners. However, they became the fifth couple to leave the competition. During the 2004 Christmas Special Cole again partnered Kaplinsky and they came in second place, dancing a Foxtrot.

In Series 3 Cole was then paired with GMTV presenter and newsreader Fiona Phillips. They were eliminated during the fourth week, coming ninth. Cole then appeared in the 2005 Christmas Special with Rachel Hunter, dancing a Rumba.

He returned to compete on the fourth series, where he partnered with actress Claire King. They were the ninth couple to be eliminated.

In the fifth series, Cole partnered Kelly Brook. They withdrew in week 9 due to the death of Brook&#x27;s father.

For the sixth series, Cole&#x27;s dance partner was presenter Lisa Snowdon. They reached the finals but were eliminated in third place. Cole and Snowdon danced again in the 2008 Christmas special, performing a quickstep.

In Series 7 Cole&#x27;s partner was businesswoman and media personality Jo Wood. They were eliminated in week 6.

In the eighth series, Cole&#x27;s partner was American singer Michelle Williams; they were eliminated in the seventh week of competition.

For the ninth series, Cole was paired with singer Lulu. They were eliminated on the sixth week. Cole also stepped in to partner Holly Valance and Anita Dobson during weeks 7 and 9 respectively due to their original partners being injured.

For the tenth series, Cole was partnered with Olympic track cyclist, Victoria Pendleton. They were eliminated in the eighth week of competition.

In series 11, Cole partnered singer-songwriter Sophie Ellis-Bextor, reaching the final and being eliminated in fourth place.

For the twelfth series, his dance partner was &quot;Casualty&quot; actress Sunetra Sarker. They were the ninth couple to be eliminated.

Cole competed with television presenter Kirsty Gallacher in the show&#x27;s thirteenth series and was eliminated in week 6. Following his elimination with Gallacher, Cole entered the &quot;Children in Need&quot; special which he won with actress Laura Main. Cole also took part in the 2015 &quot;Christmas Special&quot;, where he and series 11 winner Abbey Clancy danced a waltz.

For the show&#x27;s fourteenth series, Cole was partnered with American singer Anastacia. They were placed in the bottom two in week 2, but an injury sustained by Anastacia meant they were unable to take part in the dance-off and the decision was referred to the public vote. Anastacia and Cole polled more votes than Melvin Odoom and Janette Manrara, and were allowed to stay in the competition. They were eventually eliminated in week 6.

In 2017 Cole returned for the fifteenth series, paired with &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; presenter Charlotte Hawkins. They were eliminated in week 4. He took part in that year&#x27;s Christmas Special, partnering Katie Derham: the couple won the event.

<text>Wilhelm Jordan (1 March 1842, Ellwangen, Württemberg – 17 April 1899, Hanover) was a German geodesist who conducted surveys in Germany and Africa and founded the German geodesy journal.

==Biography==
Jordan was born in Ellwangen, a small town in southern Germany. He studied at the polytechnic institute in Stuttgart and after working for two years as an engineering assistant on the preliminary stages of railway construction he returned there as an assistant in geodesy. In 1868, when he was 26 years old, he was appointed a full professor at Karlsruhe. In 1874 Jordan took part in the expedition of Friedrich Gerhard Rohlfs to Libya. From 1881 until his death he was professor of geodesy and practical geometry at the Technical University of Hannover. He was a prolific writer and his best known work was his &quot;Handbuch der Vermessungskunde&quot; (&quot;Handbook of Geodesy&quot;).

He is remembered among mathematicians for the Gauss–Jordan elimination algorithm, with Jordan improving the stability of the algorithm so it could be applied to minimizing the squared error in the sum of a series of surveying observations. This algebraic technique appeared in the third edition (1888) of his &quot;Textbook of Geodesy&quot;.

Wilhelm Jordan is not to be confused with the French mathematician Camille Jordan (Jordan curve theorem), nor with the German physicist Pascual Jordan (Jordan algebras).

== Gauss–Jordan elimination ==
Evidence suggests that B.-I. Clasen also developed the Gauss–Jordan elimination method (independently from Jordan), and both published the method in 1888. Carl Friedrich Gauss did not directly contribute to either derivation.

&quot;Mayrant&quot; was laid down on 22 April 1909 by William Cramp &amp; Sons, Philadelphia; launched on 23 April 1910; sponsored by Mrs. I. B. Beard, great-great-granddaughter of Captain Mayrant; and commissioned on 12 July 1911.

==Pre-World War I==
Following her shakedown, &quot;Mayrant&quot; operated briefly off the New England coast before departing Newport, Rhode Island for a southerly cruise in late October. She arrived at Guantanamo Bay on 9 January 1912, participated in winter exercises in the Caribbean and then, as a unit of the Torpedo Flotilla, Atlantic Fleet, remained in the area, calling at various gulf and Caribbean ports, until spring. Returning to Newport on 14 May, she continued to operate off the east coast and in the Caribbean until 1915. Then, after completion of the 1915 winter exercises off Cuba, she steamed to the Brooklyn Navy Yard for overhaul prior to decommissioning on 20 May. On 9 November, she was moved to Philadelphia where she was berthed.

==World War I==
&quot;Mayrant&quot; was recommissioned on 2 January 1918 and joined the wartime fleet in the spring. She was employed as an escort ship, operating along the coast and across the Atlantic. Following the Armistice, she cruised south for winter maneuvers and then cruised off the middle Atlantic coast until entering the Navy Yard at Charleston, South Carolina, for a second pre-inactivation overhaul on 21 June 1919. Departing Charleston on 16 July she sailed back to Philadelphia where she was decommissioned for a final time on 12 December 1919.

==Inter-war period==
Designated DD-31, on 17 July 1920, she remained berthed at Philadelphia as a unit of the Reserve Fleet until 1935. On 8 March, she was struck from the Naval Register; on 28 June, she was sold to M. Block &amp; Company, Norfolk, Virginia for scrapping.

<text>Memory segmentation is an operating system memory management technique of dividing a computer&#x27;s primary memory into segments or sections. In a computer system using segmentation, a reference to a memory location includes a value that identifies a segment and an offset (memory location) within that segment. Segments or sections are also used in object files of compiled programs when they are linked together into a program image and when the image is loaded into memory.

Segments usually correspond to natural divisions of a program such as individual routines or data tables so segmentation is generally more visible to the programmer than paging alone. Segments may be created for program modules, or for classes of memory usage such as code segments and data segments. Certain segments may be shared between programs.

Segmentation was originally invented as a method by which system software could isolate software processes (tasks) and data they are using. It was intended to increase reliability of the systems running multiple processes simultaneously.

==Hardware implementation==
In a system using segmentation, computer memory addresses consist of a segment id and an offset within the segment. A hardware memory management unit (MMU) is responsible for translating the segment and offset into a physical address, and for performing checks to make sure the translation can be done and that the reference to that segment and offset is permitted.

Each segment has a length and set of permissions (for example, &quot;read&quot;, &quot;write&quot;, &quot;execute&quot;) associated with it. A process is only allowed to make a reference into a segment if the type of reference is allowed by the permissions, and if the offset within the segment is within the range specified by the length of the segment. Otherwise, a hardware exception such as a segmentation fault is raised.

Segments may also be used to implement virtual memory. In this case each segment has an associated flag indicating whether it is present in main memory or not. If a segment is accessed that is not present in main memory, an exception is raised, and the operating system will read the segment into memory from secondary storage.

Segmentation is one method of implementing memory protection. Paging is another, and they can be combined. The size of a memory segment is generally not fixed and may be as small as a single byte.

Segmentation has been implemented several ways on various hardware, with or without paging. Intel x86 memory segmentation does not fit either model and is discussed separately below, and also in greater detail in a separate article.

===Segmentation without paging===
Associated with each segment is information that indicates where the segment is located in memory— the &quot;segment base&quot;. When a program references a memory location, the offset is added to the segment base to generate a physical memory address.

An implementation of virtual memory on a system using segmentation without paging requires that entire segments be swapped back and forth between main memory and secondary storage. When a segment is swapped in, the operating system has to allocate enough contiguous free memory to hold the entire segment. Often memory fragmentation results if there is not enough contiguous memory even though there may be enough in total.

===Segmentation with paging===
Instead of a memory location, the segment information includes the address of a page table for the segment.
When a program references a memory location the offset is translated to a memory address using the page table. A segment can be extended by allocating another memory page and adding it to the segment&#x27;s page table.

An implementation of virtual memory on a system using segmentation with paging usually only moves individual pages back and forth between main memory and secondary storage, similar to a paged non-segmented system. Pages of the segment can be located anywhere in main memory and need not be contiguous. This usually results in a reduced amount of input/output between primary and secondary storage and reduced memory fragmentation.

==History==
The Burroughs Corporation B5000 computer was one of the first to implement segmentation, and &quot;perhaps the first commercial computer to provide virtual memory&quot; based on segmentation. The B5000 is equipped with a segment information table called the Program Reference Table (PRT) which is used to indicate whether the corresponding segment resides in the main memory, to maintain the base address and the size of the segment. The later B6500 computer also implemented segmentation; a version of its architecture is still in use today on the Unisys ClearPath Libra servers.

The GE 645 computer, a modification of the GE-635 with segmentation and paging support added, was designed in 1964 to support Multics.

The Intel iAPX 432, begun in 1975, attempted to implement a true segmented architecture with memory protection on a microprocessor.

The 960MX version of the Intel i960 processors supported load and store instructions with the source or destination being an &quot;access descriptor&quot; for an object, and an offset into the object, with the access descriptor being in a 32-bit register and with the offset computed from a base offset in the next register and from an additional offset and, optionally, an index register specified in the instruction. An access descriptor contains permission bits and a 26-bit object index; the object index is an index into a table of object descriptors, giving an object type, an object length, and a physical address for the object&#x27;s data, a page table for the object, or the top-level page table for a two-level page table for the object, depending on the object type.

Prime, Stratus, Apollo, IBM System/38, and IBM AS/400 (including IBM i) computers use memory segmentation.

==Examples==

===Burroughs large system architectures===

====B5000, B5500 and B5700====
Words in the B5000, B5500 and B5700 are 48 bits long. Descriptors have the uppermost bit set in the word. They reside in either the Program Reference Table (PRT) or the stack, and contain a &quot;presence bit&quot; indicating whether the data are present in memory. There are distinct data and program descriptors.

====B6500, B7500 and successors====
Words in the B6500 and its successors have 48 bits of data and 3 tag bits. The tag bits indicate the type of data contained in the word; there are several descriptor types, indicated by different tag bit values.
The line includes the B6500, B6700, B7700, B6800, B6900, B5900, the A-series Burroughs and Unisys machines, and the current Clearpath MCP systems (Libra). While there have been a few enhancements over the years, particularly hardware advances, the architecture has changed little. The segmentation scheme has remained the same, see Segmented memory.

===Multics architectures===
===S/370 architecture===
In the IBM System/370 models with virtual storage (DAT) and 24-bit addresses, control register 0 specifies a segment size of either 64 KiB or 1 MiB and a page size of either 2 KiB or 4 KiB; control register 1 contains a Segment Table Designator (STD), which specifies the length and real address of the segment table. Each segment table entry contains a page table location, a page table length and an invalid bit. IBM later expanded the address size to 31 bits and added two bits to the segment table entries:

;Segment-protection bit
:Segment is read-only
;Common-segment bit
:The segment is shared between address spaces; this bit is set to optimize TLB use

Each of IBM&#x27;s DAT implementations includes a translation cache, which IBM called a Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB). While Principles of Operation discusses the TLB in general terms, the details are not part of the architecture and vary from model to model.

Starting with the 3031, 3032, and 3033 processor complexes, IBM offered a feature called &quot;Dual-address Space&quot; (DAS), which allows a program to switch between the translation tables for two address spaces, referred to as &quot;primary address space&quot; (CR1) and &quot;secondary address space&quot; (CR7), and to move data between the address spaces subject to protection key. DAS supports a translation table to convert a 16-bit address space number (ASN) to an STD, with privileged instructions to load the STD into CR1 (primary) or CR7 (secondary).

===x86 architecture===

Early x86 processors, beginning with the Intel 8086, provide crude memory segmentation and no memory protection. (Every byte of every segment is always available to any program.) The 16-bit segment registers allow for 65,536 segments; each segment begins at a fixed offset equal to 16 times the segment number; the segment starting address granularity is 16 bytes. Each segment grants read-write access to 64 KiB (65,536 bytes) of address space (this limit is set by the 16-bit PC and SP registers; the processor does no bounds checking). Offset+address exceeding 0xFFFFF wraps around to 0x00000. Each 64 KiB segment overlaps the next 4,095 segments; each physical address can be denoted by 4,096 segment–offset pairs. This scheme can address only 1 MiB (1024 KiB) of physical memory (and memory-mapped i/o). (Optional expanded memory hardware can add bank-switched memory under software control.) Intel retroactively named the sole operating mode of these x86 CPU models &quot;real mode&quot;.

The Intel 80286 and later processors add &quot;286 protected mode&quot;, which retains 16-bit addressing, and adds segmentation (without paging) and per-segment memory protection. For backward compatibility, all x86 CPUs start up in &quot;real mode&quot;, with the same fixed overlapping 64 KiB segments, no memory protection, only 1 MiB physical address space, and some subtle differences (high memory area, unreal mode). In order to use its full 24-bit (16 MiB) physical address space and advanced MMU features, an 80286 or later processor must be switched into &quot;protected mode&quot; by software, usually the operating system or a DOS extender. If a program does not use the segment registers, or only puts values into them that it receives from the operating system, then identical code can run in real mode or protected mode, but most real-mode software computes new values for the segment registers, breaking this compatibility.

The Intel i386 and later processors add &quot;386 protected mode&quot;, which uses 32-bit addressing, retains segmentation, and adds memory paging. In these processors, the segment table, rather than pointing to a page table for the segment, contains the segment address in &quot;linear memory&quot;. When paging is enabled, addresses in linear memory are then mapped to physical addresses using a separate page table. Most operating systems did not use the segmentation capability, opting to keep the base address in all segment registers equal to 0 at all times and provide per-page memory protection and swapping using only paging. Some use the CS register to provide executable space protection on processors lacking the NX bit or use the FS or GS registers to access thread-local storage.

The x86-64 architecture does not support segmentation in &quot;long mode&quot; (64-bit mode). Four of the segment registers: CS, SS, DS, and ES are forced to 0, and the limit to 264. The segment registers FS and GS can still have a nonzero base address. This allows operating systems to use these segments for special purposes such as thread-local storage.

<doc id="1323132" wikidata="Q8058117" url="?curid=1323132" title="Young Fine Gael">
<text>Young Fine Gael (YFG) is the autonomous youth wing of Fine Gael, one of Ireland’s major centre-right political parties. It offers its members scope to assist in formulation of political policy, and the day-to-day running of the senior party. It is a founding member of the centre-right pan-European organisation, Youth of the European People&#x27;s Party, also known as YEPP, which is the youth wing of the European People&#x27;s Party.

YFG&#x27;s constitution allows for the organisation to act on its own, independent from its parent party, enabling it to promote its own political objectives and take its own stance on political issues.

== History ==
Young Fine Gael was formed in 1977 as part of the internal reforms to Fine Gael instigated by Garret FitzGerald, who had become leader of the party that same year. They grew rapidly with over 100 local branches of YFG being formed by 1978. During the 1980s the organisation pursued a relatively socially liberal agenda, supporting the repeal of Ireland&#x27;s homosexuality laws; a ban on the state funding on single-sex schools; and greater family planning options.

More recently in 2015, YFG campaigned in favour of legalising same-sex marriage by supporting the Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland. In 2017, YFG members at the organisation&#x27;s Summer School voted to take a neutral stance on any upcoming referendum on Ireland&#x27;s Eighth Amendment governing the country&#x27;s abortion laws. In 2018, YFG members voted in favour of Ireland becoming a member of the European nuclear physics research centre; CERN.

In 2019, YFG established its first branch in Northern Ireland, with a branch launched at Queen&#x27;s University Belfast. This launch of this branch was attended by the Attorney General, and Minister for European Affairs Helen McEntee. In 2020, YFG opposed the Programme for Government agreed by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party in 2020. However, the Fine Gael party voted overwhelmingly in favour of entering coalition.

Young Fine Gael is formed from branches, gathered into regional structures, and with an overall National Executive. Officers at all levels work with the Fine Gael National Youth Officer, who works in Fine Gael headquarters.

== Controversies ==
In October 2015, president Padraig O&#x27;Sullivan resigned from his position “due to work and personal commitments”. It later transpired that his sudden departure was prompted by other members of the National Executive. An informed source, who declined to be named, told &quot;The Journal&quot; website that a petition, signed by the majority of executive council members, was hand-delivered to O’Sullivan’s home. The petition demanded that O’Sullivan either resign or he would be forced out. Interim president Colm Taylor, who was elected YFG vice president in March of that year, insisted it was an internal party matter, stating; &quot;The situation is that Padraig did resign. It is an internal party matter. The executive of YFG are meeting on Tuesday to discuss matters arising from it. I won’t comment any further.&quot; 

In February 2016, a YFG member posted a meme of Sinn Féin&#x27;s Mary Lou McDonald, making fun of the fact she referred to &#x27;Booby Sands&#x27; on a leaflet, online. McDonald described it as an example of &quot;everyday sexism&quot;, &quot;tasteleless&quot; and &quot;bordering on smutty&quot;. Also in 2016, a YFG member replied to a tweet by Sinn Féin councillor Sarah Holland, using the official YFG Twitter account. The reply contained the line &quot;&#x27;where&#x27;s that child I killed?&quot;&#x27;, a reference to the IRA. YFG later apologised for the incident, stating that the tweet had been sent by an individual within the organisation using the YFG account.

In 2018, following the election of YFG president Killian Foley-Walsh, &quot;The Journal&quot; wrote about a tweet sent by Mr Foley-Walsh in 2015 which argued against the use of abortion pills with reference to &quot;coat hangers,&quot; which he later described as &quot;an atrocious comment&quot;. This was followed by a profile piece in Phoenix Magazine describing Mr Foley-Walsh as &quot;The baby-faced Blueshirt.&quot; In August 2019, there were calls for Foley-Walsh to resign when he and another member of the National Executive, Chloe Kennedy attended the Young America Foundation&#x27;s annual conference at which many prominent Republicans including the then VP Mike Pence and Ted Cruz spoke. Foley-Walsh also come under fire for his views expressed before being elected — including his apparent victim-blaming of those murdered by right-wing terrorist Anders Breivik, who killed 77 people in Oslo and Utoya in 2011. Neither individual resigned their post arguing it had been a regular event for members of the National Executive to attend.

In November 2021, the Kilkenny branch of YFG publicly called for the resignation of Tánaiste and party leader, Leo Varadkar, due to an ongoing Garda investigation into his leak of a confidential pay agreement document to his friend, a leader of a rival representative group to that involved in the negotiations; and low poll numbers under his leadership. The branch announced the following day that it had been &quot;terminated&quot; and its committee vacated by central Young Fine Gael. The controversy was described as &quot;the straw that broke the camel’s back&quot; by three of the ten-member National Executive, Gary O’Donovan, Dylan Hutchinson, Audrey O’Leary, who resigned in protest at the treatment of the Kilkenny branch, and because of a &quot;toxic&quot; atmosphere within the Executive.

<text>Flórián György Albert (15 September 1941 – 31 October 2011) was a Hungarian professional football player, manager and sports official, who was named European Footballer of the Year in 1967. Nicknamed &quot;The Emperor&quot;, he played as a forward, and has been described as one of the most elegant footballers of all time.

A club legend of Ferencvárosi TC, Albert joined the team as a schoolboy and spent his whole playing career at &quot;Fradi&quot;. He also starred for Hungary, winning 75 international caps and scoring 31 goals. He was joint top-scorer at the 1962 World Cup with four goals and played a key role in Hungary&#x27;s third-place finish at the European Championship in 1964.

He stayed loyal to Ferencváros after his retirement as well, actively participated in the club&#x27;s life and also held administrative positions. From 2007 the stadium of Ferencváros bore his name, until 2014 when the new stadium of the team was constructed, named “Groupama Arena”.

Albert died in October 2011, aged 70, in a hospital in Budapest after complications following heart surgery carried out a few days earlier.

==Early life==
The son of a blacksmith, Albert was born and brought up in the little town of Hercegszántó near the border with the former Yugoslavia, where he got his first taste of the game playing with his two brothers. His mother was a Serb and his father was a Šokac. She died when he was two. When the family later moved to Budapest, Albert participated on a talent day held by Ferencváros. He impressed the coaches and was selected by the club. Albert was 11 years old at the time.

==Career==
Albert spent his entire club career with Ferencvárosi TC, where he played from 1952 to 1974. He came through the ranks quickly and made his debut in the senior team on 2 November 1958 against Diósgyőr, in a match in which he hit the back of the net two times. The forward was also spotted by Hungarian national team manager Lajos Baróti in a youth match between Hungary and Yugoslavia, and not much later Albert already received his first call-up. His first appearance in the national selection came on 28 June 1959 against Sweden, who finished runners-up in the World Cup a year earlier. Albert contributed with two assist to Hungary&#x27;s 3–2 win over the Scandinavians. He scored 31 goals in 75 caps for the Hungarian team, with them he has collected the bronze medal on both of the Olympic Games in 1960 and the European Championship in 1964. At the 1962 World Cup, despite Hungary being knocked out in the quarter-finals, Albert, tied with five others, managed to win the Golden Boot Award with four goals.

On club level, his biggest success came in 1965, when in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, Ferencváros, that knocked-out among others AS Roma and Manchester United F.C. en route to the final, triumphed over Juventus FC 1–0 in the decisive match and obtained the cup title.

Albert appeared in his next World event in 1966 in England, where he produced an excellent display against Brazil in a duel that is regarded as one of the greatest matches in the history of the World Cup. The Magyars, after losing to Portugal in their first round encounter, entered a must-win match against Brazil. Hungary eventually beat the South Americans 3–1, to keep their hopes alive, and Albert, who received a standing ovation from the supporters, made the fans forget the absence of Pelé with his performance. By winning their final group match, Hungary made it to the quarter-finals, just to fall short against the Soviet Union.

The year 1967 was a special one for Albert, who not only won the Hungarian Championship with Ferencváros and collected the Hungarian Player of the Year title, but in December first celebrated the birth of his son, and later he was awarded the Ballon d&#x27;Or in recognition of his outstanding attributes. Albert topped the voting with 68 points, twenty-eight ahead of Bobby Charlton, who came second.

In 1968 Albert appeared in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final again, this time against Leeds United, but lost by a one-goal margin (0–1). On 15 June 1969, in a World Cup qualifier against Denmark, Albert collided with Knud Engedal, goalkeeper of the Scandinavians, and suffered a serious fractured leg injury. Following that he was sidelined for almost a year and could never win back his form any more. Albert returned into action in the Hungarian Championship on 27 April 1970 against Salgótarján and on 4 April 1971 he played his first international match after the injury, a friendly match against Austria. His final major event was the 1972 European Championship, where he captured fourth place with Hungary, recording two appearances in the tournament. In the same year he captured the Hungarian Cup title for the first time, thus making his collection of domestic silverware complete.

Albert played his final league match on 17 March 1974 against Zalaegerszeg. He came on as a substitute in the second half and contributed to the 3–0 victory with a goal, the last one in his career. Albert, after receiving greetings and gifts from the old boys, the opponents and his son, ran to the stands, bowed for the fans and left the field on the shoulders of his teammates.

Following his retirement, he had two short spells as a manager in Libya with Al-Ahly Benghazi, however, with only limited success. After returning from North Africa, Albert worked for Ferencváros in several positions, such as technical director, department leader and later honorary chairman. In 2007, Ferencváros&#x27; stadium was named after him. In the same year, he received a prize in his village of birth, Hercegszántó, becoming an honorable citizen. In 2010 Budapest, a year later, Ferencváros awarded him honorary citizenship.

==Personal life==
Albert married Irén Bársony, an actress, on 30 November 1963. The couple had two children, a girl, Magdolna, and a son, Flórián Albert Jr., who, like his father, became a football player with Ferencváros, and later had spells in Israel and France and also played for the Hungarian national team. Albert&#x27;s grandchild, Flórián Patrik, aims to become a professional footballer as well.

==Death==
On 27 October 2011, Flórián, after suffering a vasoconstriction, underwent coronary artery bypass surgery. Although a press release the following day by his former club Ferencváros stated that the operation had been successful, he subsequently suffered a heart attack and died in the early hours of 31 October 2011.

His funeral took place on 6 November 2011 in the Cemetery of Óbuda. Hundreds of mourners accompanied Albert to his final rest, including Viktor Orbán, Prime Minister of Hungary; Pál Schmitt, President of Hungary; Sándor Csányi, president of the Hungarian Football Federation; Gábor Kubatov, president of Ferencvárosi TC; and former teammates Kálmán Mészöly, Gyula Rákosi, Lajos Szűcs and Tibor Nyilasi. The event was also live broadcast by Hungarian public television Magyar Televízió.

In the afternoon same day, Ferencváros played a league clash against Paksi SE. Before the match the floodlights were switched off and the stadium turned into dark, with candles lit by the fans are being the only lights in the arena. Ferencváros players wore a special all-black kit in the occasion and fans paid tribute to Albert with a banner saying &quot;God shall be with you Emperor&quot;. Supporters of SK Rapid Wien, who have close ties with Ferencváros, also shown honor to Albert with a transparent in their game against SV Ried.

The friendly match against Liechtenstein played on 11 November was declared a memorial game for Albert by the Hungarian Football Federation. The clash was originally scheduled to take place at the Sóstói Stadion, but later was moved to the Ferenc Puskás Stadium to give more people the opportunity to attend the event. In the four corners of the arena memorial places were erected, where the supporters could pay their tribute to the Golden Ball winner. A five-minute-long compilation of the best moments of Albert was also projected before the kick-off.

Hungary eventually won the match 5–0 in front of a sold-out crowd with two goals by Balázs Dzsudzsák, and further strikes from Tamás Priskin, Vladimir Koman and Róbert Feczesin. Dzsudzsák commented after the match that he is sure that Flórián would have been happy if he could have seen the match, and added that he hopes they rejoiced him in Heaven.

<doc id="1323136" wikidata="Q1796196" url="?curid=1323136" title="Kingdom of the Algarve">
<text>The Kingdom of the Algarve (Portuguese: &quot;Reino do Algarve&quot;, from the Arabic &quot;Gharb al-Andalus&quot; , &quot;Western al-&#x27;Andalus&quot;), after 1471, Kingdom of the Algarves (Portuguese: &quot;Reino dos Algarves&quot;), was a nominal kingdom within the Kingdom of Portugal, located in the southernmost region of continental Portugal, until the end of the monarchy in 1910.

It was a dominion of the Portuguese Crown and supposedly a kingdom apart from Portugal, though in fact the &quot;Algarvian kingdom&quot; had no institutions, special privileges, or autonomy. The Algarve was politically very similar to the rest of the Portuguese provinces, and &quot;King of the Algarve&quot; was just an honorific title, based on the Algarve&#x27;s history as the last area of Portugal to be conquered from the Moors during the Portuguese Reconquista. 

The title &quot;King of Silves&quot; was first used by Sancho I of Portugal after the first conquest of the Algarvian city of Silves in 1189. At the time of his grandson, Afonso III of Portugal (1210–1279), the rest of the Algarve had finally been conquered, so &quot;King of Portugal and the Algarve&quot; then became a part of the titles and honours of the Portuguese Crown.

==History==
===Reconquista===
During the Reconquista, Portuguese and Castilian conquests went south, to retake lands that had been conquered by Muslim armies in the 8th century. Portugal conquered and secured much of its southern borders during the reigns of King Sancho II of Portugal and King Afonso III of Portugal.

===First conquest===
In 1189, King Sancho I of Portugal conquered Silves, one of the most prosperous cities in Al-Andalus, aligned at the time with the Almohad Caliphate. Portuguese control over Silves would be short, with the Almohads conquering the city again in 1191 in a massive counter-attack led by Abū Yūsuf Yaʿqūb al-Manṣūr the Almohad Caliph in person.

===The conquest of the Algarve===
With the decline of the Almohads, the southern taifa city-states united under a single Emir, Mūsā ‘ibn Muhammad ‘ibn Nassir ‘ibn Mahfūz, former governor of Niebla, and known among the Christians as &quot;Aben Mafom&quot;.

Ibn Mafūz, King of Niebla and Emir of the Algarve, trying to counter the achievements of the Portuguese in their territories, declared himself a vassal to Alfonso X of Castile (who thus titled himself the King of the Algarve). Through his vassals, Alfonso X hoped to claim dominion over the Algarve not yet conquered by the Portuguese.

The Emir’s vow of vassalage to Castile, however, did not stop the knights of the Order of Santiago, under the command of the Grand-Master Paio Peres Correia, from conquering most of the region city by city, between 1242 and 1249, including Silves. In March 1249, King Afonso III of Portugal captured Faro, the last Muslim stronghold in Algarve, ending the Portuguese Reconquista.

The entitlement of Afonso III of Portugal as &quot;King of Portugal and the Algarve&quot; would serve as a reaction to Alfonso X of Castile&#x27;s claim to the Algarve, and was meant to demonstrate the Portuguese monarch’s rights over the region.

The issue between the sovereigns of Castile and Portugal was eventually settled by the Treaty of Badajoz (1267), where King Alfonso X gave up his claims of the Algarve, making his grandson Dinis the heir to the throne of the Algarve, which dictated the terms of its absorption into the Portuguese crown. The treaty, though, allowed the use of the title of &quot;King of the Algarve&quot; by King Alfonso X and his descendants, since King Alfonso X had acquired the territories of &quot;Al-Gharb Al-Andalus&quot; on the other side of the Guadiana River. The kings of Castile, and later Spain, would add the title to their repertoire of titles until the ascent of Queen Isabel II of Spain to the throne.

===Age of Discovery===
During the Age of Discovery, many voyages started from the Algarve, mainly those funded by Prince Henry the Navigator (Infante D. Henrique). Prince Henry also set up his school of navigation at Sagres Point, though the idea of a real school building and campus is highly disputed. Most of the voyages set sail from Lagos.

===The Algarves of either side of the sea in Africa===
The name of the Algarvian Kingdom suffered some minor changes due to the Portuguese North African conquests, which were considered an extension of the kingdom of the Algarve. John I of Portugal added to the title of &quot;King of Portugal and the Algarve&quot;, the title &quot;Lord of Ceuta&quot;, and his grandson Afonso V of Portugal, in turn, styled himself &quot;Lord of Ceuta and Alcacer-Ceguer in Africa&quot; (after 1458). The 1471 conquest of Asilah, Tangiers and Larache, together with North African previous holdings, led to the creation of the title &quot;the Algarves from either side of the sea in Africa&quot; (Algarve d’além-mar), leaving the European Algarve to become &quot;the Algarve behind the sea&quot; (Algarve d’aquém-mar).

Thus, it was not until 1471 that &quot;the Kingdom of the Algarve&quot; led to &quot;the Kingdom of the Algarves&quot;, due to the increase of Portuguese possessions in Northern Africa, which were made as possessions of the Kingdom of the Algarve. The Portuguese monarchs therefore adopted the title that they would use until the fall of the monarchy in 1910: &quot;Kings of Portugal and the Algarves of either side of the sea in Africa&quot;. The title would continue to be used even after the abandonment of the last North African holding in Mazagan (Portuguese: &quot;Mazagão&quot;; lost by Portugal in 1769).

===19th-century conflicts===

During the 19th century, a serious clash between pro-constitutionalism liberals and pro-absolutism antiliberals, caused a civil war in Portugal (1828–1834), and in Algarve an exodus of people from the Algarvian inlands to the coastal cities. José Joaquim Sousa Reis, an antiliberal known as Remexido, fought in the inlands and attacked the coastal cities, bringing the urban population into turmoil. The turmoil of the Algarve intensified in the years between 1834 and 1838, when the Algarve saw battles on a level it had never seen before. On November 26, 1836, Miguel I of Portugal, already defeated and living in exile, named Remexido &quot;Governor of the Kingdom of the Algarve&quot; and &quot;Acting Commander in Chief of all the Royalist Troops, Regular and Irregular Armies, and the Operations in the South&quot;. Remexido, however, was captured near São Marcos da Serra and shot in Faro on August 2, 1838, after being subjected to a summary trial.

<doc id="1323148" wikidata="Q4273111" url="?curid=1323148" title="USS Monaghan (DD-32)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Monaghan&quot; (DD-32) was a modified in the United States Navy during World War I and later in the United States Coast Guard, designated (CG-15). She was named for Ensign John R. Monaghan.

&quot;Monaghan&quot; was laid down on 1 June 1910 by Newport News Shipbuilding Company, Newport News, Virginia; launched on 18 February 1911; sponsored by Mrs. F. J. Gavin, sister of Ensign Monaghan; and commissioned on 21 June 1911, Lieutenant Commander W. P. Cronan in command.

==World War I==
Joining the Atlantic Fleet, &quot;Monaghan&quot; took part in fleet readiness training and operations which prepared the US Navy to enter action immediately when its country joined the Allies in World War I. &quot;Monaghan&quot;″s first war service was on patrol along the Atlantic coast; she then escorted troop convoys through the dangerous mid-ocean section of their crossings. From November 1917 until the Armistice a year later, &quot;Monaghan&quot; made antisubmarine patrols against the U-boat menace in European waters. Returning from occupation duty, &quot;Monaghan&quot; decommissioned at Philadelphia on 4 November 1919.

==Inter-war period==
&quot;Monaghan&quot; was transferred to the Coast Guard on 7 June 1924 to serve in the Rum Patrol. She was stationed at New London, Connecticut until she was sent to Boston, Massachusetts in 1930.

She was returned to the Navy on 8 May 1931. Her name was dropped on 1 July 1933 so that it might be assigned to a new destroyer, and she was sold to Michael Flynn of Brooklyn, New York on 22 August 1934 for scrapping in accordance with the London Naval Treaty.

<doc id="1323149" wikidata="Q2491608" url="?curid=1323149" title="Prie-dieu">
<text>A prie-dieu (French: literally, &quot;pray [to] God&quot;) is a type of prayer desk primarily intended for private devotional use, but which may also be found in churches. A similar form of chair in domestic furniture is called &quot;prie-dieu&quot; by analogy. Sometimes, a prie-dieu will consist only of the sloped shelf for books without the kneeler.

== History ==
The prie-dieu appears not to have received its present name until the early 17th century. In that period in France, a small room or oratory was sometimes known by the same name. In the Middle Ages, the faithful attended the parish services standing. From the 16th century onwards, wooden benches or chairs were made available, according to an order fixed by the customary law, and rented from the farmer who was the successful bidder for the &quot;chair farm&quot; or from the churchwarden, the fixed prices (increased during solemn masses) being collected by the chairmaker.

== Description and use ==
The design of this prayer stand varied in time, eventually settling as a small, ornamental wooden desk furnished with a thin, sloping shelf for books or hands, and a kneeler. Sometimes, instead of the sloping shelf, a padded arm rest will be provided. This type is useful for devotions such as the Rosary, which do not require a book, or for private, non-liturgical prayer.

Prie-dieu may be provided in church weddings for the bride and groom to kneel on during the service (either one long double prie-dieu or a pair), or may be used by a cleric when he or she leads the worshippers in prayers such as litanies and other prayers. In the Byzantine Rite, a prie-dieu is provided for the bishop when he kneels in the Holy Doors during the consecration of a church. One may also be used by the priest reciting Kneeling Prayers at Pentecost.

<doc id="1323154" wikidata="Q732980" url="?curid=1323154" title="Hubert Aquin">
<text>Hubert Aquin (24 October 1929 – 15 March 1977) was a Quebec writer, filmmaker and intellectual. He is particularly known for his novel &quot;Next Episode&quot;. He is also an important figure in the history of the Quebec independence movement, to which he contributed both as an activist and as an essayist. Tempted by suicide for a great part of his existence, he ended his life in 1977 in the gardens of Villa Maria College.

== Biography ==
=== Genealogy ===
Hubert Aquin was born on 24 October 1929, at 4037 St-André Street, in Montreal. His family is mainly of French Canadian origin, but also of Irish origin through his great-grandmother, Helen McCardon. He is the son of a Montreal sporting goods merchant. He had three sons: Philippe and Stéphane, with his wife Thérèse Larouche, and Emmanuel with Andrée Yanacopoulo. François Aquin, his cousin, was elected as a Liberal Party of Quebec MLA in 1966, before leaving the party in 1967 and becoming an independent MLA, as he disagreed with the disapproval of his party leader Jean Lesage regarding De Gaulle&#x27;s &quot;Vive le Québec libre!&quot; speech. Hubert Aquin is also the brother of engineer Richard Aquin with whom he tried to organize an auto racing Grand Prix in Montreal in the 1960s.

=== Studies ===
Aquin entered the Collège Sainte-Marie, a Jesuit school, in September 1946 and left in June 1948. He obtained remarkable results there, according to Guylaine Massoutre. It was there that he met Louis-Georges Carrier, who would be a great friend of Aquin all his life. He also did theatre there, which helped him to overcome his great shyness as a child. He enrolled in the philosophy faculty of Université de Montréal in September 1948, and received a degree in 1951, at the age of 21. During his time at Université de Montréal, he directed the student newspaper &quot;Le Quartier latin&quot;. He was then offered a job as a teacher at the university, but he turned it down, preferring to prepare for a career in journalism. He then went to study at the Institut d&#x27;études politiques de Paris from 1951 to 1954. According to Aquin, every trip to Europe is a moment of &quot;emotional shock&quot; for him, a theme that would later recur in his work.

=== Professional life ===

Upon his return to Montreal in 1954, he was hired as a director and scriptwriter for Radio-Canada (from 1954 to 1959). Then, from 1959 to 1963, he was a director, producer and screenwriter at the National Film Board (NFB). For the NFB, he notably worked on the film &quot;À l&#x27;heure de la décolonisation&quot;, directed by Monique Fortier, which led Aquin to interview in 1962 figures of decolonization such as Albert Memmi (with whom he formed a friendship), Messali Hadj, Octave Mannoni and Olympe Bhêly-Quenum. Decolonization would be a major influence on his political writings. Then, during the same stay in Europe, he was received for three days by Georges Simenon, of whom he was a great reader. Aquin then made a film on Simenon, which never saw the light of day.

Aquin worked at the Montreal Stock Exchange from 1960 to 1964. In 1966, based on an already written script, Aquin wrote the script for the film &quot;Faux bond&quot;, in which he eventually played the main role, after some hesitation. The images from the film will be used to illustrate several passages of the NFB documentary &quot;Deux épisodes dans la vie d&#x27;Hubert Aquin&quot; by Jacques Godbout. In 1967, he began teaching literature at Collège Sainte-Marie. In 1969, he was hired by the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM), but he resigned in 1970, saying he disagreed with the policy of Rector Léo A. Dorais. Carleton University, in Ottawa, hired him in 1974 as a visiting professor, but did not renew his contract.

In 1975, Aquin was appointed literary director of Éditions La Presse. He lost his job in August 1976: he was fired following the publication of an open letter denouncing the cultural policies of Éditions La Presse towards Quebec works. He then accused his superior officer, Roger Lemelin, of &quot;colonizing Quebec from the inside&quot;. In 1976, Aquin returned to UQAM for a teaching position, but only taught there for one month due to a strike. After the victory of the Parti Québécois in 1976, Aquin hoped to obtain a position within the government, such as Deputy Minister of Cultural Affairs, which did not come to fruition.

=== Personal life ===
In 1958, Aquin discovered car racing, a passion that led him to work towards holding an auto racing Grand Prix on Île Sainte-Hélène. To do this, he founded his own car racing company in 1960, &quot;Le Grand Prix de Montréal Inc.&quot;. He also included car racing in a film he made in 1961, &quot;Le Sport et les Hommes&quot; (on which Roland Barthes collaborated), and the novel &quot;Next Episode&quot;. He dreamed of becoming a driver, but considered himself too old to think about it seriously. A auto racing Grand Prix in Montreal would come to exist from 1978 onward.

It was at Radio-Canada that he met his future wife, Thérèse Larouche, a script girl for his friend Louis-Georges Carrier. He married her in 1955. In 1963, he met Andrée Yanacopoulo. Born in Tunis to a half-Sicilian, half-Greek father and a French mother, Yanacopoulo graduated in medicine and sociology. She then prepared a thesis on suicide and researched &quot;Depression among French Canadians in Montreal&quot;, supervised by Guy Rocher, a sociologist, and Camille Laurin, a psychiatrist and future pro-independence minister under René Lévesque. Yanacopoulo would be Aquin&#x27;s lover until his death. As for his couple with Thérèse Larouche, they began divorce proceedings in 1966. The seizures on Aquin&#x27;s income that followed contributed to his financial troubles.

=== Political involvement ===
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police visited his office in 1958. They confiscated works by authors such as Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. A secret trial in Ottawa followed, lasting three or four days. He was questioned about his friendships during his university years, presumably because they were trying to track down communist activists. According to Guylaine Massoutre, these events &quot;precipitated his political awareness and gave rise to his adherence to separatist ideology&quot;. Having become an activist for Quebec independence, he was an executive member of the Rassemblement pour l&#x27;indépendance nationale (RIN) from 1960 to 1968. In 1962, in the magazine &quot;Liberté&quot;, he published his most famous political text, &quot;La fatigue culturelle du Canada français&quot;, responding to an article published in &quot;Cité libre&quot; by Pierre Elliott Trudeau on the subject of independence: &quot;La nouvelle trahison des clercs&quot;.

On 19 June 1964, he publicly announced in a letter to the newspapers &quot;Le Devoir&quot; and &quot;Montréal-Matin&quot; that he was going &quot;undercover&quot; and becoming &quot;commander of the Special Organization&quot; with the aim of joining forces with the Front de libération du Québec. He then took refuge at Louis-Georges Carrier&#x27;s dwelling, then at Andrée Yanacopoulo&#x27;s. He meets Dr. Pierre Lefebvre, a psychiatrist and contributor to &quot;Parti pris&quot;, who, on 26 June, concludes that immediate treatment is necessary due to a &quot;nervous breakdown&quot;. On 29 June, a press release announces that the Special Organization will take action on the following 1 July. On 5 July, Aquin is arrested by a plainclothes police officer in a stolen car, in possession of a revolver, in a parking lot behind the Saint Joseph&#x27;s Oratory.

During his incarceration, he declares that his profession is: &quot;revolutionary&quot;. Two charges were brought against him: &quot;theft and posession of stolen goods&quot; and &quot;possession of an offensive weapon for a dangerous purpose&quot;. He was then interned for two months in a psychiatric hospital, the Albert-Prévost Institute, in the maximum security wing. It was during this stay that he began writing his novel &quot;Next Episode&quot;, which tells the story of an imprisoned revolutionary. The verdict of the trial, deferred, only arrived in 1966. Aquin was then acquitted because of contradictory testimonies given about his mental health. His pistol was however confiscated.

Around May 1966, Aquin left Quebec to live in Switzerland. There he became interested in the &quot;Jura question&quot;, and tried to make contact with autonomists in the Bernese Jura. On 29 August, he was questioned by the police of the canton of Vaud about his membership in the RIN, and his imprisonment. He was then suspected of collusion with the Front de libération jurassien. On 19 November, on behalf of the Federal Foreigners Police, the canton of Vaud refused him a residence permit that he needed to live in Nyon. He was told that he had to leave Switzerland before 15 January 1967, under the pretext of &quot;foreign overpopulation&quot;. Aquin then moved to Paris, and remained there until 21 March 1967. He then returned to Montreal. During 1969, he denounced the decision to dissolve the RIN in favor of René Lévesque&#x27;s Mouvement Souveraineté-Association, and left the party.

=== Literary production ===
In 1952, Aquin wrote &quot;Les Rédempteurs,&quot; a work that remained unpublished until 1959. His texts appeared in various magazines, starting in 1959, including in &quot;Parti pris&quot;, &quot;Le Magazine Maclean&quot;, &quot;Voix et images du pays, Écrits du Canada français&quot; and the literary magazine &quot;Liberté&quot;, of which he was director from 1961 to 1962. &quot;Next Episode&quot;, his best-known novel, was published in 1965 in Montreal, then in 1966 in Paris and translated into English in 1967 in Toronto. In Quebec, it was a success in terms of sales and reviews. The first edition sold out in two and a half months, and, in &quot;Le Devoir&quot;, the literary critic Jean Éthier-Blais ended his article about the book by exclaiming: &quot;We do not have to look any further. We have him, our great writer. My God, thank you. » In Paris, the critical reception was however more mixed.

In 1969, he was the first Quebec writer to refuse the Governor General&#x27;s Literary Award which was awarded to him for his novel &quot;Trou de mémoire,&quot; from 1968. Also in 1969, he published &quot;L&#x27;Antiphonaire&quot; which, like his subsequent novels (and unlike the two preceding ones), does not contain any explicit political reference. In 1971, he published &quot;Point de fuite&quot;. That year, he resigned from the editorial board of &quot;Liberté&quot; because, he said, the magazine had ignored the events of the October Crisis of 1970 in order to avoid losing funding from the Canada Council for the Arts. In 1974, Aquin published &quot;Neige noire&quot;, a modern version of Hamlet. At the end of his life, he planned to write &quot;Obombre&quot;, a work that would remain unfinished. His novel &quot;L&#x27;Invention de la mort&quot;, written around 1959 or 1960, was finally published posthumously in 1991.

=== Suicide ===
Suicide is an idea that haunts Aquin for many years, and he often evokes it with his friends in the form of jokes. On 29 March 1971, he failed a suicide attempt in a room of the Queen Elizabeth Hotel by swallowing barbiturates. He is hospitalized at the Sacré-Cœur Hospital until 4 April. At the hotel, he had registered under the name of his character from his novel &quot;The Antiphonary&quot;, J. W. Forrestier. On 15 March 1977, he attempted suicide again, this time with a firearm in the gardens of the Villa Maria College in Montreal, leaving his partner Andrée Yanacopoulo a final note: 

== Reputation in English Canada ==
Regarded in English Canada as a classic of Canadian literature, Aquin&#x27;s novel &quot;Next Episode&quot; (the English translation of &quot;Prochain épisode&quot; by Sheila Fischman), was chosen for the 2003 edition of CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Canada Reads&quot; competition, where it was championed by journalist Denise Bombardier. It was the winning title, because of the deciding vote of future Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau, who was also on the panel and voted against the book he was initially defending, &quot;The Colony of Unrequited Dreams&quot; by Wayne Johnston. Justin Trudeau is the son of former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, who Aquin was responding to with &quot;La fatigue culturelle du Canada français&quot;. An earlier English translation by Penny Williams, keeping the French title, was published in 1967. A notable work in English about Aquin is &quot;HA!: A Self-Murder Mystery&quot; (2003), an experiment in biography by Aquin&#x27;s friend Gordon Sheppard.

== Tributes and conservation ==

The Hubert-Aquin building at the Université du Québec à Montréal (built from 1975 to 1979) is named in his (posthumous) honour.

The Hubert Aquin archives are held at the Montreal archives centre of the Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec.

In 1979, the Quebec writer and filmmaker Jacques Godbout made a documentary entitled &quot;Two episodes in the life of Hubert Aquin&quot;.

Hubert-Aquin Street was named in his honor in 1984 in Quebec City.

<doc id="1323160" wikidata="Q429633" url="?curid=1323160" title="São Paulo Gay Pride Parade">
<text>São Paulo LGBTQ Pride Parade () is an annual gay pride parade that has taken place in Avenida Paulista, in the city of São Paulo, Brazil, since 1997. It is South America&#x27;s largest Pride parade, and is listed by Guinness World Records as the biggest pride parade in the world starting in 2006 with 2.5 million people. They broke the Guinness record in 2009 with four million attendees. They have kept the title from 2006 to at least 2016. They had five million attendants in 2017. As of 2019 it has three to five million attendants each year. In 2019, it was also the second larger event of the city of São Paulo in terms of total revenue (after Carnaval) and the first in terms of daily revenue. In 2010, the city hall of São Paulo invested 1 million reais in the parade. According to the LGBT app Grindr, the gay parade of the city was elected the best in the world.

The São Paulo Gay Pride Parade is heavily supported by the federal government as well as by the Governor of São Paulo and the city mayor. Many politicians show up to open the main event and the government often parades with a float with politicians on top of it. Caixa Econômica Federal, a government bank, and Petrobrás, Brazil&#x27;s oil firm, have already reaffirmed their commitment to back up the event and its diversity, funding once again the event. In the Pride the city usually receives about 400,000 tourists and moves between R$ 180 million and R$ 190 million. Because of this support, the event has many security measures in place. Since the election of Jair Bolsonaro as president of Brazil in 2018, there has been concern that the federal government would withdraw support for the parade, given Bolsonaro&#x27;s previous anti-LGBTQ sentiments.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the parade was celebrated virtually in June 2020. The in-person parade was initially postponed until November 29, 2020, but was ultimately cancelled entirely.

==Participants==
The first parade in 1997 gathered around 2,000 s, according to the military police. The ninth parade gathered over 2.5 million people according to the police and 3 million according to the organizers. 

The military police, which traditionally counts the number of participants at major public events, does not release its estimates for attendance at the parade since then, which caused the omission of the Parade from the 2008 issue of &quot;Guinness&quot; that requires official sources for records regarding attendance at events. According to the police, it would be impossible to count the number of people attending an event with a &quot;floating population.&quot; There has been controversy about the exact number of participants.

<doc id="1323169" wikidata="Q301437" url="?curid=1323169" title="Priego de Córdoba">
<text>Priego de Córdoba is a town and municipality of Spain located in the autonomous community of Andalusia. It lies on the southeasternmost end of the province of Córdoba, near the headwater of the Guadajoz, and on the northern slope of the Sierra de Priego. The population in 2015 was 22,936.

==Geography==
The view from the cliff, known as the &quot;Adarve&quot;, is a favorite subject for paintings. From the &quot;Adarve&quot; one sees an over 180° degree expanse of valley and olive grove speckled mountains known as the &quot;Subetica&quot;.

The oldest section of Priego is its Barrio de la Villa. It is bordered on one side by the town&#x27;s natural fortress, a high cliff. The alleys that wind through this part of the town are Moorish in style, decorated with flower pots and religious icons. Some homes still have the ancient tunnel system that went from their cellars (bodegas) to the castle.

== History ==
Priego (&quot;Bāguh&quot;) may have been founded as a military campsite by Syrian troops of the jund of Damascus after 743.

The earliest verified mention to the place dates to 863, in the context of an Islamic source reporting the contribution of 900 horsemen of &quot;Bāguh&quot; to a emiral campaign waged against the kingdom of Asturias-León. Rebel forces made incursions in the kūra of Priego in 866 during the Ibn-Hafsun revolt against Umayyad rule, reportedly causing the ruine of the madina. The place was pacified in 921, becoming again the head of a kūra, only to be integrated some years later to the kūra of Elvira. Priego was stormed by a Christian army under Ferdinand III in 1225. It is moot whether it was abandoned or lost, but it was re-acquired in a barter by Ferdinand III during the 1245–46 siege of Jaén, and it was ensuingly entrusted to the Order of Calatrava. It was incorporated the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada either in 1327 or 1332, and was conquered by Castile in 1341.

==Economy==
Its economy is based on agricultural products, mainly olive oil and cereals. The olive oil from Priego has been given its own denominational label. The olive oils have recently garnered many of the most prestigious prizes in international competitions.&quot;Venta del Barón&quot; is the best olive oil in the world since 2014 2015 and 2016

==Culture==
=== Holy Week ===
The religious brotherhoods of Priego have a long history, some dating back to before the 16th century. The traditional displays of these brotherhoods in the religious processions of Holy Week (Semana Santa) are renowned for their grandeur and beauty.

The procession on Holy Thursday (Jueves Santo) of the Brotherhood of the Column (Jesus de la Columna), which is the oldest and most prestigious of the town&#x27;s brotherhoods, and on Holy Friday (Viernes Santo) the Brotherhood of the Nazarenos, in which the procession is of a hand carried float with Christ carrying the cross.

The Nazareno is carried from a church in the center of Priego to a mountain top that overlooks Priego known as the Calavario. Once there a priest comes out of the hermitage there and delivers a benediction.

=== Cuisine ===
The population holds up pastries in the form of roosters or pigs, with a hard boiled egg in the center, known as &#x27;hornazos&#x27;. After the benediction it is considered good luck for the coming year to eat the pastry.

==Housing ==
Priego is a village found on the &quot;Ruta del Califato&quot; (trade route of the Caliphate). It is called “City of the water” because of the many springs and &quot;Jewel of the Baroque Native of Córdoba” for the multitude of its Baroque-style constructions. It has been referred to as “the lock and key to the Kingdom of Granada”.

The oldest section of Priego is its &quot;Barrio de la Villa&quot;. It is bordered on one side by the town&#x27;s natural fortress, a high cliff. The alleys that wind through this part of the town are Moorish in style, decorated proudly by the populace with flower pots and religious icons. Some homes retain the ancient tunnel system that went from their cellars (bodegas) to the castle.

Some of the best examples of the Spanish Baroque are found in the numerous churches in Priego. The oldest church was built in the 13th century and subsequently restored; it has a fine chapel. There are ruins (under restoration as of 2006) of a castle having been a fortified city of the Moors (with the Hispano-Arabic name Baguh), eventually captured by the Christians under Ferdinand III in 1225, lost again in 1327, and finally retaken in 1340 by Alfonso XI.

The Barrio de la Villa was given the official title of Historic Centre of Priego in 1972.

==Notable people==
*Niceto Alcalá-Zamora (1877–1949), Prime Minister and President of the Second Spanish Republic, was from Priego.
*Ibn al-Qatta&#x27; al-Yahsubi (10th Century - 1006), Vizier

<text>Kateryna Mykhaylivna Yushchenko (born Catherine Claire Chumachenko, September 1, 1961) is an American-born Ukrainian politician and philanthropist who was the First Lady of Ukraine from 2005 to 2010.

==Family==
Yushchenko&#x27;s father, Mykhailo Chumachenko, was born in the village of , Kharkiv Oblast in 1917 to a large family of farmers. He was one of only a few members of his large family to survive the Soviet Famine of 1932–1933. Chumachenko studied electrical engineering in Lysychansk, Luhansk Oblast. He served in the Soviet Army, and was captured by German forces and taken to Germany in 1942.

Yushchenko&#x27;s mother, Sofia Chumachenko, was born in Litky, Kyiv Oblast, in 1927, and died 30 September 2012 in Kyiv. Along with many other young women of her village, Sofia Chumachenko was taken to Nazi Germany at the age of 14 to serve as a slave laborer, shortly after the invasion of the Soviet Union.

Kateryna Yushchenko’s parents met in Germany, married, and gave birth to her sister, Lydia, in 1945. Mykhailo Chumachenko became seriously ill with tuberculosis in 1945 and spent eight years in a tuberculosis sanatorium.

In 1956, the Chumachenko family immigrated to the United States on an invitation from the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in Chicago. Mykhailo Chumachenko worked as an electrician in Chicago until his retirement in 1984. The Chumachenkos moved to Florida in 1987. Chumachenko visited his native Ukraine three times, in 1991, 1994 and 1995. His dream was to return to his village and start a small farm. He died in 1998 and is buried in Kyiv.

==Biography==

Kateryna Yushchenko was born Catherine Claire Chumachenko in Chicago to immigrants from the Left-bank Ukraine. She is a former U.S. State Department official. She worked as a special assistant to the Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs. She holds a bachelor&#x27;s degree in International Economics from the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University (1982), and an MBA from the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business (1986).

She later worked in the White House in the Office of Public Liaison during the administration of Ronald Reagan. Subsequently, she worked at the U.S. Treasury in the executive secretary&#x27;s office during the administration of George H. W. Bush. After leaving that position, she was on the staff of the Joint Economic Committee of the United States Congress. After Ukraine declared its freedom, she was a co-founder and the vice-president of Ukraine-USA Foundation. She was also the director of Pylyp Orlyk Institute. In 1993, she joined KPMG Peat Marwick/Barents Group as a consultant in its Bank Training Program and Country Manager, where she met Viktor Yushchenko, whom she subsequently married. She left her job in August 2000, when she was expecting her second child.

Yushchenko is now involved in numerous charitable projects with the Ukraine 3000 International Foundation that she chairs. The key priority of the Foundation is better health for Ukraine’s children. On the Supervisory Board of Ukraine 3000 Foundation, established in 2001, are some of Ukraine’s most prominent educational, humanitarian, cultural, literary and sports figures. President Victor Yushchenko served as Chairman of the Supervisory Council until his inauguration in 2005. Since then, its Chairman is Kateryna Yushchenko. All programs and projects of the Foundation are implemented within three major areas: &quot;Ukraine Yesterday&quot;, &quot;Ukraine Today&quot; and &quot;Ukraine Tomorrow&quot;. The biggest projects of the Foundation are the &quot;Hospital to Hospital&quot; program, the construction and support of the &quot;Children&#x27;s Hospital of the Future&quot; and &quot;The Joy of Childhood – Free Movements&quot; program.

==Ukrainian politics==
Opponents of her husband criticized her for remaining a U.S. citizen. During the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election campaign, she was accused of exerting the influence of the U.S. government on her husband&#x27;s decisions, as an employee of the U.S. government or even a Central Intelligence Agency agent. She had earlier been accused by Russian television journalist Mikhail Leontyev of leading a U.S. project to help Yushchenko seize power in Ukraine; in January 2002, she won a libel case against him. Ukraine&#x27;s pro-government Inter television channel repeated Leontyev&#x27;s allegations in 2001, but in January 2003 she won a libel case against the channel as well. 

==Personal life==
She is married to Viktor Yushchenko and has three children: Sofia, Khrystyna, and Taras. She became a Ukrainian citizen in 2005, and in 2007, she renounced her US citizenship.

<doc id="1323178" wikidata="Q2357063" url="?curid=1323178" title="Shikhandi">
<text>Shikhandi () is a character in the Hindu epic Mahabharata. Born as the daughter of Drupada, the King of Panchala, Shikhandi becomes male after agreeing to a sex exchange with a yaksha. He is the brother of Draupadi, the female protagonist of the epic, who is the common wife of the Pandavas.

Shikhandi, whose natal female identity is sometimes rendered Shikhandini, is the reincarnation of Amba, a princess who was abducted by Bhishma at a svayamvara and later spurned by him. The prince fights in the Kurukshetra War on the side of his brothers-in-law, the Pandavas, and is instrumental in causing the death of Bhishma. He also engages in combat with great warriors like Ashwatthama, Kripa, and Kritavarma.

In Javanese wayang tradition, Shikhandi is known as Srikandhi and is born as a male, and changes into a female. She becomes the second wife of the Pandava brother Arjuna, and Sembadra being the first.

== Legend ==

=== Previous birth ===

In the majority of the versions of the Mahabharata, Shikhandi is described as being a princess named Amba in his previous birth. Amba was the eldest daughter of the King of Kashi. Along with her sisters, Ambika and Ambalika, she was won by Bhishma at their svayamvara. After defeating several kings, including King Salva, Bhishma returned to Hastinapura with the princesses, and presented them as brides to his younger half-brother, Vichitravirya, the king.

Before her wedding ceremony could commence, Amba told Bhishma that she had fallen in love with the King of Salva, and was not ready to marry anyone else. Hearing this from her, Bhishma sent Amba with grandeur to her desired husband. However, Salva rejected her, stating that as Bhishma had bested him at the svayamvara, he regarded him to be her rightful husband. Amba returned to Bhishma and demanded that he marry her according to Kshatriya dharma, but Bhishma declined, due to his vow of celibacy. Lamenting her misfortune, the princess decided to retire to the forest and practise austerities for the remainder of her life. As she wandered, she came across an ashrama, and informed the sages within of her plight. One of the sages happened to be maternal grandfather, Hotravahana, who sympathised with her state of mind, and told her that Parashurama, Bhishma&#x27;s martial guru, would come to her aid. Parashurama visited Hastinapura, and commanded his disciple to marry Amba. Bhishma refused to obey him, once again citing his vow. Furious, Parashurama engaged in a terrible duel against Bhishma on the field of Kurukshetra for twenty-three days, employing astras, but was unable to best him. He regretfully informed Amba of his failure to change his mind. The princess spent twelve years engaged in severe austerities, which scorched the heavens themselves. Shiva appeared to grant her a boon of her choice, and she solicited the death of Bhishma. Shiva told Amba that she would be born as a girl who would later become a man in her next life, and become a maharathi who would slay Bhishma in battle. Overjoyed, the princess lit a funeral pyre, prayed for the death of Bhishma, and self-immolated.

According to an iteration by C. Rajagopalachari, she resorted to a penance and received a garland of blue lotuses from the god Kartikeya, and it was foretold that anyone wearing the garland would become the cause of Bhishma&#x27;s death. She went to the Panchala, as it were a mighty empire known for its military prowess. However, no one was willing to champion her cause, fearful of antagonising Bhishma. Amba, in anger, hung the garland on the gates of King Drupada and left in agony.

=== Sex exchange ===
Due to his childlessness, King Drupada propitiated Shiva, who told the king that a girl would be born to him, who in due course, would become a man. When Shikhandi was born to Drupada&#x27;s queen, she was raised and dressed as a boy. When Shikhandi reached the traditional age of maturity, Drupada decided to offer her hand in marriage to the daughter of Hiranyavarman, the King of Dasharna. Shikhandi&#x27;s wife soon realised that her husband was not a man, and Hiranyavarman soon caught wind of this information. Outraged, he sent a messenger to Drupada to determine the truth, and started preparations for war with the latter. Drupada insisted that Shikhandi was indeed a man. Distressed by her parents&#x27; suffering, Shikhandi left the city, deciding to fast to death. She found a forest that humans were terrified to enter, because it was inhabited by a yaksha named Stunakarna. She entered the premises of the yaksha, and started to perform austerities. When Stunakarna enquired regarding her practices, Shikhandi told him her tale. Feeling compassionate, the yaksha offered to exchange his sex with her for a certain period of time, to which Shikhandi agreed. Shikhandi returned to his father as a man, and informed him of this incident. Relieved, Drupada invited Hiranyavarman to send envoys to inspect the manhood of his son. A number of women were dispatched by Hiranyavarman to Drupada, who confirmed Shikhandi&#x27;s manhood. Thus, the two kings were able to renew their peace.

When Kubera visited Stunakarna&#x27;s premises, the yaksha did not greet him due to her female form. Angered, Kubera cursed the yaksha, stating that the sex exchange that had been performed would be permanent. When the yaksha begged Kubera to lift the curse, the latter told her that she would regain her birth sex after the death of Shikhandi.

=== Kurukshetra War ===

Before the Kurukshetra War, Bhima opts for Shikhandi to be the commander-in-chief of the Pandava army, as he was born to kill Bhishma, but Arjuna and Krishna prefer Dhrishtadyumna instead. Shikhandi is made the commander of one of the seven akshauhinis of the Pandava army.

On the first day of the war, Shikhandi confronts Ashwatthama, and both warriors wound each other several times, before withdrawing from the battle. On the seventh day of the war, he confronts Ashwatthama again, and manages to wound him on the forehead. However, an enraged Ashwatthama destroys his chariot, and wounds him badly. Luckily, Satyaki comes to his rescue.

On the night of the ninth day of battle, after a decisive defeat, the Pandavas and Krishna visit Bhishma. Yudhishthira urges the grandsire to tell them how he may be slain, to prevent the devastating loss of Kshatriya lives. Bhishma informs them that it was impossible for him to be vanquished while he wielded arms; However, he would refuse to fight Shikhandi, since he was originally a woman, and Arjuna may vanquish him when he lays down his arms. So, in the next day&#x27;s fight, Shikhandi rides with Arjuna, placed in the forefront of the Pandava forces. Numerous warriors of the Kaurava army attempt to stop the pair from reaching Bhishma. However, with the assault of the warriors of the Pandava army, Arjuna and Shikhandi push through, and reach Bhishma. Riding behind Shikhandi, Arjuna attacks Bhishma with a devastating volley of hundreds of arrows, the latter is unable to counter, with Shikhandi in the way. Bhishma falls from his chariot and his role in the war ends, giving up his life on the auspicious Uttaryana.

On the twelfth day of the war, Shikhandi&#x27;s only son, Kshatradeva, is killed by Duryodhana’s son, Lakshmana Kumara. On the night of fourteenth day, Shikhandi is defeated by Kripacharya and is wounded on the sixteenth day, and faints when Kritavarma&#x27;s arrow pierces his armour. After the death of Shalya, Shikhandi greatly destroys the retreating Kaurava army on the seventeenth day of the war.

Shikhandi, along with the Upapandavas, are killed by Ashwatthama on the 18th day of the war. Dazed, Shikhandi is killed in a sword fight with Ashwatthama when Ashwatthama, Kripacharya, and Kritavarma attacked the Pandava camp at night.

According to Devdutt Pattanaik, Ashwatthama kills Shikhandi&#x27;s lover in front of him; in other versions, it is Shikhandi&#x27;s partner who is butchered.

==Perspective==
*Narrated in first person by unnamed narrator

<text>Syed Ahmed Shah Bokhari (Urdu: ), commonly known as Patras Bokhari (October 25, 1898 – December 5, 1958), was a Pakistani humorist, writer, broadcaster and diplomat who served as a Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the United Nations.

Born in Peshawar, British India to a Kashmiri father, Shah studied at Edwardes Mission School in Peshawar and moved to Lahore where he studied English literature at the Government College. Shah moved to United Kingdom where he received his Tripos from the Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He returned to Lahore where he taught English at Government College in 1927. He became a prominent part of the Muslim intelligentsia in South Asia. Shah moved to eventually become Director General of All India Radio in Delhi and then Principal of Government College. He was appointed as the country&#x27;s envoy to the UN in New York City from 1951 and 1954, followed by the Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations for Information until 1958.

==Life==
Patras was born as Syed Ahmed Shah Bokhari on 1 October 1898 in Peshawar in the North-West Frontier Province of British India to a Kashmiri Muslim father, who had migrated from Baramulla, northern Kashmir in the 19th century and a Hindkowan mother. His Syed ancestors had migrated to Kashmir from Bukhara, Uzbekistan.

Bokhari received his early education in the city of his birth and then studied at Islamia College, before moving in 1916, to attend Government College in Lahore. After completing his Master of Arts degree in English, he was appointed as a lecturer at the same institution. In 1922, he took his MA in English after just one year&#x27;s study and stood first, after which he was appointed lecturer. This was his creative period. His bilingual excellence is owed to his intensive translation of great books and plays from English into Urdu. He was tall and blue-eyed, had a razor-sharp mind, an equally sharp tongue, and a keenness to go forward in life. Patras&#x27; brother Zulfiqar Ali Bukhari was a noted broadcaster in Pakistan.

Bokhari left his position at Government College, Lahore, before moving to England from India in 1925 to complete a Tripos in English at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. Many years later, the Bokhari English Prize was established there in his honor. In 1927, he returned to Government College, Lahore, and as a professor remained there until 1939.

Before the independence of Pakistan in 1947, he was the director general of All India Radio. Being a professor of English Literature, he also served as the principal of Government College, Lahore from 1947 to 1950. The Urdu poets Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Noon Meem Rashid and Kanhaiyalal Kapoor were among his students.

He was a member of Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan&#x27;s delegation during his visit to the United States in 1950. He drafted the prime minister&#x27;s speeches and public pronouncements. These have been published in a volume entitled Heart of Asia. It was his close association with Liaquat Ali Khan, which culminated in his posting as Pakistan&#x27;s permanent representative at the United Nations (1951-1954). From 1954 to 1958 he served as the Undersecretary of the UN, Head of Information.

In New York, Bokhari lived in a small house on a small street along the East River. He used four languages at home: the local dialect, Persian, Urdu and Pashto.

==Background to Pen Name &quot;Patras&quot;==
Ahmed Shah Bokhari first started using a pen name &quot;Peter&quot;, in respect of his teacher &quot;Peter Watkins&quot;, when he wrote in English. In his Urdu writings he used the pen name &quot;Patras&quot;.

According to Khaled Ahmed, &quot;The House of Patras&quot; which appeared in The Friday Times, Lahore, on May 13, 1999, Patras is a Persian adaptation of an Arabic rendering of &#x27;Peter&#x27;.

An extract from Z.A. Bokhari&#x27;s autobiography about the orientation of ASB&#x27;s pen name is:

&quot;My brother&#x27;s full name was Pir Syed Ahmed Shah Bokhari. Our headmaster (in Peshawar) Mr. Watkins addressed him by his first name ‘Pir’ but pronounced it as ‘Pierre’ as if it was a French word. Pierre in French stands for Peter, which is Patras in Greek... As a result of this similarity, my brother took up ‘Patras’ as his pen name&quot;.

==Contributions==
His collection of essays, &quot;Patras Kay Mazameen (پطرس کے مضامین)&quot; published in 1927 is said to be an asset in Urdu humor writings. It is undoubtedly one of the finest works in Urdu humor and despite the fact that it was written in first half of twentieth century, it seems to be truly applicable even today. He lived in times of personalities like Allama Iqbal and had interacted with him on several occasions and engaged him in philosophical debates. One of his debates with Iqbal led to creation of one of his poems in his book &quot;Zarb-e-Kaleem&quot;.

Ahmed Shah Bokhari was well read in Greek philosophy. He wrote an article &quot;Ancient Greek Rulers and Their Thinking&quot; which was published in March 1919 in the &quot;Kehkashan&quot; Lahore. He was only 21 at the time.

His work at the UN was truly amazing during many years of his service to this body, which was in infancy while Patras worked there. One of his major contributions was fighting the case of UNICEF during meetings which were convened to discuss its closure because apparently it had fulfilled its designated task. Patras argued successfully that UNICEF&#x27;s need in developing countries is much greater than its role in European countries after second world war. His arguments persuaded even Eleanor Roosevelt to change the stance of her country, United States.

His contributions to the UN as a leading diplomat were summed up by Ralph J. Bunche (UN Secretary General and Nobel Peace Laureate) in these words:

&quot;Ahmed Bokhari was, in fact, a leader and a philosopher, a savant, indeed, even though not old in years, a sort of elder statesman. His true field of influence was the entire complex of the United Nations family... He was acutely conscious of the aspirations of people throughout the world for peace, for better standards of life, for freedom and dignity, but no one was more soundly aware than he of the difficulties and obstacles to be overcome in bringing about a broad advance of humankind along these avenues.&quot;

Bokhari&#x27;s great work was done at the UN. He said that apart from being as great an internationalist as Dag Hammarskjöld, he was the first advocate of liberation movements in colonized countries across Africa and the Middle East. That credit has been denied him by his countrymen, as they have denied it to Sir Zafralla Khan, though for different reasons.

==Death and legacy==
In 1923, he married Zubaida Wanchoo, a Punjabi-speaking Kashmiri lady, and daughter of a superintendent of police. They had three children – two sons Mansoor and Haroon, and a daughter Roshan Ara. Roshan Ara died as a child. Patras Bokhari died on December 5, 1958, still serving as a diplomat and is buried in Valhalla Cemetery, New York.

A major Pakistani English language newspaper comments about him, &quot;In addition he inspired great devotion and love in his friends, companions and students.&quot;

==Awards and recognition==
*He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) in the 1944 Birthday Honours list.
* In October 1998, to mark his birth centenary, the Pakistan Post Office issued a commemorative postage stamp in his honor under the series, &quot;Pioneers of Pakistan&quot;.
* On 14 August 2003 President of Pakistan, General Pervez Musharraf, announced the conferment of Hilal-e-Imtiaz, the country&#x27;s second highest civilian award, posthumously on Bokhari. This award was formally conferred on 23 March 2004.
*Dr. Anwar Dil, a well known Pakistan writer based in the US published a book on Patras Bokhari in 1998 called &quot;On This Earth Together&quot; in 1998, after 20 years of painstaking research in the US and Pakistan.

===Named after him===
*The Government of Tunisia, named a road after him in Tunis, in recognition for his contribution towards the freedom of Tunisia from French Colonial Rule in 1956. There is also a road named after him in Islamabad, Pakistan.
*Government College, Lahore named their auditorium &quot;Bokhari Auditorium&quot; to honour him.

<text>Mount Gay Rum is produced by Mount Gay Distilleries Ltd. of Barbados, the easternmost island of the West Indies. The oldest surviving deed for the company is from 1703, making Mount Gay Rum the world&#x27;s oldest commercial rum distillery. The current majority shareholder of Mount Gay Distilleries since 1989 is Rémy Cointreau. Mount Gay Rum is sold in 110 countries, and its primary export market is the United States of America.

== History ==

Mount Gay Rum is named for Sir John Gay Alleyne, 1st Baronet of Four Hills. He was a trusted friend of John Sober, who purchased the Mount Gilboa Plantation/Distilleries from William Sandiford in 1747. Sir John Gay Alleyne agreed to become the manager of the company at John Sober&#x27;s request. He was so effective at leading the company that the company was renamed in his honour after his death in 1801 at the proposal of his longtime friend John Sober, whose estate benefited greatly over the years under Sir John Gay Alleyne&#x27;s management. As there was already a Mount Alleyne in existence on the island of Barbados, the company was renamed Mount Gay Distilleries, incorporating the beloved Sir John Gay Alleyne&#x27;s middle name.

In 1757, Sir John Gay Alleyne was elected to the Parliament of Barbados, for the Parish of St. Andrew, a seat he held for the next forty years, with only a break in 1771. He became Speaker of the Barbados House of Assembly in 1767, serving until 1770 and after another two years was reappointed until 1779. Alleyne was named a Baron of Four Hills on 6 April 1769. According to Hilary Beckles, historian and principal of the University of the West Indies – Cave Hill Campus, Sir John Gay Alleyne was a popular leader among the planter elite and a great philanthropist. He was also one of the most influential voices of his time to speak out against the institution of slavery. On 29 April 2010, while speaking at the Founder&#x27;s Day service at Alleyne School, which was founded by Sir John Gay, alumnus and guest speaker Monsignor Vincent Blackett stated that Sir John Gay Alleyne should certainly be named one of Barbados&#x27; National Heroes.

The company throughout the 20th century was in the hands of the Ward family in the parish of St. Peter. The Ward family resides in the northernmost parish of St. Lucy, where they have extensive agricultural holdings. The last Ward family member to manage the distillery was Frank Ward, who also the Executive Chairman of the West Indies Rum and Spirits Producers Association.

== Description ==
Mount Gay Rum is made from molasses and water that has been filtered through natural coral. This mix is fermented using an exclusively selected yeast and then distilled in both copper pot stills and column stills, before being aged in oak barrels.

The little red star on the image of the island on Mount Gay Rum&#x27;s former bottle label represents the capital of Barbados, Bridgetown, not the location of the distilleries, which are actually in the northern part of the island. In the Bridgetown area, Mount Gay maintains the Mount Gay Rum Visitors Centre on the Spring Garden Highway in Brandons, St. Michael. The Mount Gay Visitor&#x27;s Center is a tourist attraction that hosts several tours and events.

The distillery is made of four warehouses where about 4,000 barrels of spirit mature. The distillation engineering includes a retort to re-infuse aromas from the vapor back into the liquid.

== Sailing traditions ==
Mount Gay Distilleries has released several limited edition rums over the course of their history to honor their nautical heritage or commemorate important occasions in the history of Barbados.

Mount Gay Rum has been closely associated with sailing and a popular rum preference among sailors over the many years of its existence. Barbados, the most deeply British of the West Indian cultures, is often the first landfall for ships following the prevailing trade winds from Europe to the Caribbean. Despite Mount Gay being favoured by sailors worldwide, the island of Barbados is not considered to be an ideal cruising area for sailing yachts due to its open exposure to the frequent swells of both the northern and equatorial Atlantic, and the lack of generally calmer seas or the true natural harbors one finds throughout the rest of the Antilles to the west (i.e. Antigua&#x27;s English Harbour, or St. Georges in Grenada).

The distributors of Mount Gay rum are sponsors of the nonprofit United States Sailing Association. They also sponsor over 110 regatta events worldwide, with approximately 50 of those based in the United States. Mount Gay gives away distinctive red hats to top competitors at its sponsored regattas.

== Products ==
*Mount Gay Silver: A clear rum made from a blend of pot still and column distilled rums.
*Mount Gay Eclipse: An aged rum developed in 1911 and named for the total solar eclipse and the passage of Halley&#x27;s comet in 1910.
*Mount Gay Black Barrel: An aged rum that undergoes a second maturation in deeply charred Bourbon oak barrels.
*Mount Gay XO: Formally Mount Gay Extra Old, this rum contains selected casks that have aged for 8 to 15 years.

== Cocktails ==
Mount Gay is one of the key ingredients in Stirling Punch, a drink named for famous yachtsman, America&#x27;s Cup winner and Vanderbilt Sailing Club founder Harold Stirling Vanderbilt. Mount Gay Rum is also commonly used in cocktails that call for Barbadian Rum because of its wide availability.

== Perceptions ==
Mount Gay Eclipse rum has a very distinctive flavour. There are other rums made on the island, but Mount Gay is the oldest and most prominent.

Notable Spirit ratings for Mount Gay rums include scores of 95 (&quot;Exceptional&quot;) for its Extra Old offering at the Beverage Tasting Institute&#x27;s 2008 Competition and a Gold rating for Eclipse Gold at the 2009 San Francisco World Spirits Competition.

The first drink James Bond (Daniel Craig) orders in &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (2006) is not his trademark Vodka martini but a Mount Gay Rum with soda.

<text>Pierre Prieur (c. 1626–1676) was a French enamel painter.

==Life==
He married Marie (1610–1677), sister of Jean Petitot, as her second husband. In 1669 he was in England, painting a miniature of Charles II of England and another of Lady Castlemaine, both after Cooper, for the king of Denmark. In 1670 he was in Poland, painting for the Danish monarch a portrait of King Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki, and in the following year was in Denmark executing a remarkable series of portraits of the children of Frederick III of Denmark. All these, with some beautiful enamel badges for the Order of the Elephant, are held in the Danish royal collection.

By Christian V of Denmark he is said to have been sent to Spain and Russia, where several examples of his work, dated 1676, are to be seen in the Hermitage. In the following year he died in Denmark. He was a Huguenot, and was said to possess secret colors in enamel, especially a blue, which were not known to his Petitot relations. His work in England is of great rarity, Lord Dartrey possessing the finest example, and there are two remarkable works in the Pierpont Morgan collection and one at Windsor Castle. Two in the Propert collection have been lost sight of.

<text>The Kolkata-&quot;class destroyers, also knownProject 15AorProject 15 &quot;Alpha, are a class of stealth guided-missile destroyers constructed for the Indian Navy. The class comprises three ships – &quot;Kolkata&quot;, &quot;Kochi&quot; and &quot;Chennai&quot;, all of which were built by Mazagon Dock Limited (MDL) in India, and are the largest destroyers to be operated by the Indian Navy. Due to delays in construction and sea trials, the initial commissioning date of the first ship of the class was pushed back from 2010 to 2014.

The destroyers are a follow-on of the Project 15 s, but are considerably more capable due to major improvements in the design, the addition of substantial land-attack capabilities, the fitting-out of modern sensors and weapons systems, and the expanded use of net-centric capability such as Cooperative Engagement Capability.

== Design ==
The &quot;Kolkata&quot; class share similar dimensions to the previous &quot;Delhi&quot; class, however they have 2,363 modifications which include major upgrades in weaponry, sensors and helicopter systems. With a standard displacement of and a full-load displacement of , they are the largest destroyers ever operated by the Indian Navy. Some media reports have even given a full-load displacement of . These are the first stealth destroyers built by India and marked a significant development in India&#x27;s shipbuilding technology. The ships incorporate modern weapons and sensors, and have an advanced information warfare suite, an auxiliary control system with a sophisticated power distribution architecture, and modular crew quarters.

The class have a length of , a beam of and a draught of . The ship&#x27;s power and propulsion features a combined gas and gas system utilizing four DT-59 reversible gas turbines. This configuration allows the ship to reach speeds in excess of . Aviation facilities include a large flight deck, which was re-designed to handle larger helicopters than the &quot;Delhi&quot; class, and an enclosed hangar for up to two maritime helicopters.
The primary radar sensor of the class is the EL/M-2248 MF-STAR multi-mission AESA. It is also equipped with Thales LW-08 long range volume search radar.

The ship&#x27;s main air-defence armament is composed of four eight-cell vertical launching systems (VLS) allowing for up to thirty-two Barak 8 / MRSAM air defence missiles.

The class is designed for network-centric warfare such as Cooperative Engagement Capability, where they operate wide-area air defense, distributing assets and control over different platforms and locations, and harnessing multiple sensors &amp; effectors into a single air defense system. In May 2019, 2 ships of the class conducted the maiden cooperative engagement firing of the Barak 8 / MRSAM by using the Joint Taskforce Coordination (JTC) mode to intercept several simultaneous aerial targets involving two complex scenarios at extended ranges. With it, the Indian Navy became the second naval service in the world after the United States, and the first in Asia to have developed and deployed it. The capability is to be rolled out on all future major warships of the Indian Navy.

Four AK-630 CIWSs are fitted for close-in defence.

The supersonic BrahMos anti-ship and land-attack missiles are the primary offensive armament of the &quot;Kolkata&quot; class. The BrahMos missiles are fitted into a 16-cell Universal Vertical Launcher Module (UVLM) allowing one missile per launch silo, and all 16 missiles can be fired in salvo.

The class carries a naval gun located forward of the bridge, which provides limited anti-shipping capability and anti-air capability in addition to its naval gun fire-support role for land-based operations.

A bow-mounted sonar HUMSA-NG (hull-mounted sonar array – new generation) is carried for sub-surface surveillance.

For anti-submarine warfare, the &quot;Kolkata&quot; class are equipped with a torpedo launching system via four torpedo tubes and two RBU-6000 anti-submarine rocket launchers.

BEL&#x27;s Electronic Modular Command &amp; Control Applications (EMCCA) Mk4 provides combat management.

Forty lakh (four million) lines of codes have been written to develop the advanced combat management system onboard INS &quot;Kochi&quot;. The system is designed so that all the data about the surrounding threat comes in one place, along with analysis of the kind of threat. The system also advises the commanding officer about the kind of weaponry he should use to tackle the threat in real time. The ship is equipped with sophisticated digital networks, such as Asynchronous Transfer Mode based Integrated Ship Data Network (AISDN), Combat Management System (CMS), Automatic Power Management System (APMS) and Auxiliary Control System (ACS). The AISDN is the information highway on which data from all the sensors and weapon ride. The CMS is used to integrate information from other platforms using an indigenous data-link system to provide Maritime Domain Awareness. The intricate power supply management is done using APMS, and remote control and monitoring of machinery is achieved through the ACS.

==Development==
In 1986, the Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs (CCPA) approved a follow-on class of the earlier Project 15 &quot;Delhi&quot;-class destroyers. The aim was that the follow-on class would incorporate a higher level of air-defence, land attack, anti-submarine, and anti-ship capabilities than the preceding class. However, the Indian Navy did not initially take up the option. By the year 2000, the Indian Navy had redesigned the follow-on &quot;Kolkata&quot; class to incorporate even higher levels of technology (including modern stealth characteristics) and in May of that year, approval for the construction was given. The concept and function for Project 15A was framed by the navy&#x27;s Directorate of Naval Design, while the detailed design was developed by Mazagon Dock Limited (MDL).

Initially in 2008, the total program cost with long-term spare parts was expected to cost , but the construction costs escalated about 225%, and by 2011, cost of the program became , with each ship costing . The Defense Minister A. K. Antony cited the causes being the delay in supply of warship-grade steel by Russia, increase in costs of Russian specialists due to inflation during the build period, wage revision due from October 2003 and delay in finalisation of cost of weapons and sensors. A Comptroller and Auditor General of India report published in 2010 blamed the Navy for delays, criticising the late decisions for replacement of surface to air missile system with Barak, change of gun mount, inclusion of a sonar dome and modification of helicopter hangar to accommodate HAL Dhruv.

===Construction===
Construction of three &quot;Kolkata&quot;-class ships was sanctioned by the Government of India in May 2000, and steel for the lead ship was cut in March 2003. Construction began in September 2003 at Mazagon Docks, Mumbai, with an initial expectation that the first of the class would be handed over to the navy by 2010. However, since then the &quot;Kolkata&quot; class has suffered consecutive delays, slow construction procedures, and technical problems, which saw the first ship of the class enter service during mid-2014. The delays in the construction programme have been attributed to persistent design changes made by the Indian Navy to incorporate new weapons systems and sensors, failure by a Ukrainian shipyard to deliver the ship&#x27;s propellers and shafts, and the contract later being awarded to a Russian firm, and finally the delay in the delivery of the Barak 8 anti-air missiles.

The &quot;Kolkata&quot; class are the largest destroyers ever to be constructed at Mazagon Docks. Technical problems were found during the sea trials of the lead ship &quot;Kolkata&quot;, which delayed the project by six months to early 2014.

<doc id="1323206" wikidata="Q8058379" url="?curid=1323206" title="Young Progressive Democrats">
<text>The Young Progressive Democrats were the youth wing of the Irish political party, the Progressive Democrats. Weakened after the party&#x27;s poor showing in the 1997 elections, they were completely reformed on a national basis after the 2002 general election. A special conference of the Young Progressive Democrats (YPD) was held in party headquarters on 18 October 2008. This was in response to the announcement of the Parliamentary Party interest in winding up the Progressive Democrats Party. At this special conference the Young Progressive Democrats agreed to formally dissolve the Young Progressive Democrats following the same timetable as the Progressive Democrats for dissolving. A November 2008 special congress of the Progressive Democrats resolved that the party should come to an end; it was officially dissolved on 20 November 2009. By this action the Young Progressive Democrats also ceased to exist.

==Branches==
They had branches in Trinity College, Dublin, Dublin Institute of Technology, University College Dublin, Cork Institute of Technology and University College Cork. They also had a vibrant regional organisation in Dublin, Cork, Galway and the Mid West (Tipperary/Limerick/Clare) composed of young people who were not in college as well as the students from the Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick colleges.

They also had members from NUI Maynooth, NUI Galway, Dublin City University, University of Limerick, Waterford IT, Mary Immaculate College, Griffith College Dublin and National College of Ireland.

==Media coverage==

The Young Progressive Democrats earned coverage in the national media in the past. In 2003 they received media attention after the Minister for Justice, Michael McDowell, was allegedly almost assaulted by protesters while trying to address the UCD branch of the Young Progressive Democrats.

The following September, a satirical leaflet produced by the Young Progressive Democrats that compared all of the political parties to pizzas was covered in the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot;.

In November 2004 a debate organised by the Trinity College, Dublin Young Progressive Democrats between the Minister for Justice, Michael McDowell, and the General Secretary of Sinn Féin, Robbie Smyth, received front page coverage on the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; and was also covered in the Irish Examiner.

In September 2005 the Young Progressive Democrats received huge media coverage for a leaflet which compared politics to Star Wars. They received front page coverage on the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; and the &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot; as well as coverage from the Irish Sun, the Irish Mirror, the Sunday Times, the Observer, 98FM and several other radio stations.

In November 2005, comments made by the Tánaiste Mary Harney at a Trinity College, Dublin Young Progressive Democrat event made the front page of the Sunday Tribune. They quoted her as saying that she had no preference as to whether she was in government with Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael.

In March 2006 a Young Progressive Democrat workshop on the future of the Irish language received broad coverage throughout the Irish-language media.

They have also received mixed coverage from the political satire magazine &quot;The Phoenix&quot;. Two articles were printed highlighting bitter fights between the Dublin and Cork regions of the youth party. A &quot;young blood&quot; profile was published of the then Chairperson Diane Duggan. In April 2006, &quot;The Phoenix&quot; published an article detailing how the Young Progressive Democrats had successfully launched a campaign to prevent Ógra Fianna Fáil becoming members of the European Liberal Youth.

==Electoral Success==
Several members of the Young Progressive Democrats have run for election in both local elections and general elections. These include Jason O&#x27;Mahoney, Noelle Ryan, Bob Quinn, Paul McAuliffe, Ben Howe and Barry Saul.

Barry Saul was the first YPD member to serve as a public representative when he was co-opted to Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council in 2003. Alan McGaughey (YPD Chairperson 2002) was subsequently co-opted onto South Dublin County Council in January 2008.

In the 2009 local elections Barry Saul (now FG) and Paul McAuliffe (now FF) were elected, respectively to Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council and Dublin City Council respectively.

==International links==
The Young Progressive Democrats was a member of two international youth organisations:
*The International Federation of Liberal Youth (IFLRY), which acts as the youth organisation of Liberal International.
*The European Liberal Youth (LYMEC), which acts as the youth organisation of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party.</text><links>

<text>Chloralose (also known as α-chloralose) is an avicide, and a rodenticide used to kill mice in temperatures below 15 °C. It is also widely used in neuroscience and veterinary medicine as an anesthetic and sedative. Either alone or in combination, such as with urethane, it is used for long-lasting, but light anesthesia.

Chemically, it is a chlorinated acetal derivative of glucose.

Chloralose exerts barbiturate-like actions on synaptic transmission in the brain, including potent effects at inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAAR). A structural isomer of chloralose, β-chloralose (also called parachloralose in older literature), is inactive as a GABAAR modulator and also as a general anesthetic.

Chloralose is often abused for its avicide properties. In the United Kingdom, protected birds of prey have been killed using the chemical.
Legal use for bird control also often causes raptor mortalities from secondary poisoning, as well as primary poisoning of non-target species from eating bait, for example, kererū pigeon in New Zealand.

<doc id="1323209" wikidata="Q845189" url="?curid=1323209" title="Spotted turtle">
<text>The spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata), the only species of the genus &quot;Clemmys&quot;, is a small, semi-aquatic turtle that reaches a carapace length of upon adulthood. Their broad, smooth, low dark-colored upper shell, or carapace, ranges in its exact colour from black to a bluish black with a number of tiny yellow round spots. The spotting patterning extends from the head, to the neck and out onto the limbs. Sexually mature males have a concave plastron and a long, thick tail. By contrast, sexually mature females possess a flat plastron and have a tail that is noticeably shorter and thinner than that of mature males. Mature males also have a dark iris and face; females typically have a yellow or orange iris and a similarly coloured face that is distinctly lighter than the males&#x27;. Juveniles appear female-like in this regard, and at maturity males begin to develop darker features.

Spotted turtles are aquatic omnivores that inhabit a variety of semi-aquatic or in other words, shallow, fresh-water areas such as flooded forests, marshes, wet meadows, bogs and woodland streams in southern Canada (Ontario) and the eastern US: the eastern Great Lakes and east of the Appalachian Mountains.

==Taxonomy==
The spotted turtle is the only species in the genus &quot;Clemmys&quot;, which was first named in 1828 by Ferdinand August Maria Franz von Ritgen. Johann Gottlob Schneider originally described the species as &quot;Testudo guttatai&quot; in 1792; however, he is now the authority for the current binomial name, &quot;Clemmys guttata&quot;. Until recently, the genus &quot;Clemmys&quot; consisted of four species (bog turtle, spotted turtle, western pond turtle, and the wood turtle). Recent genetic analyses have revealed that the spotted turtle is distinct from the other three species. The bog turtle and the wood turtle were moved to the genus &quot;Glyptemys&quot;, while the western pond turtle has been renamed &quot;Actinemys&quot;, leaving the spotted turtle the only member of its genus.

==Description==

The spotted turtle is small and has a gray to black base color. Its upper shell (carapace) is smooth, does not have a central ridge running down the middle (called a &quot;keel&quot;), and grows to in length. It is also totally black and contains anywhere from zero to about one hundred yellow spots, which are a defining characteristic of this turtle. Although perhaps inconsequential, it has been found that the left side of the upper shell has more spots than the right. Spots can always be found on the head, neck, and limbs. The bottom shell (plastron) is yellow or orange-yellow and a black spot is present on each section (scute); however, with age, melanism of the plastron increases until the entire surface is black.

The head is black and the upper jaw is notched. On each side of the head is a large orange blotch. Also present are several yellow bands of varying size. Skin on the dorsal side of the turtle is black with sparse yellow spots while skin on the ventral side may be brighter: orange, pink, or red. These lightly pigmented areas do vary geographically and the tail of some individuals has yellow striping. Regarding the geographical variation in spots, southern individuals tend to have smaller and less conspicuous spots than those of individuals from farther north. The spotted turtle&#x27;s karyotype consists of 50 chromosomes.

Visual differences between male and female turtles develop around the time of sexual maturity. The male spotted turtle has a tan chin, brown eyes, and a long, thick tail. The chin of the female is yellow; she also has orange eyes and a shorter tail than the male. In addition, the bottom shell of males is concave while it is either flat or convex in females. On average, females grow to be slightly larger than males. Also, females have more spots than males (on average).

Hatchlings resemble the adults closely. Consistently, each segment of the upper shell has only one yellow spot.

==Distribution==
The spotted turtle ranges from southern Maine, Quebec, and Ontario, south along the eastern US to Florida in the east and central Indiana and Ohio in the west. Disjunct populations exist in the Canadian portion of its range and also in central Illinois, central Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Indiana. In Indiana and Illinois, the species is found only in the northern portion of the state but it is found on most of the lower peninsula of Michigan. The highly fragmented distribution of spotted turtles in Ohio only covers the northern two-thirds of the state.

The spotted turtle occupies a variety of habitats including swamps, bogs, fens, marshes, woodland streams, and wet pastures. Also, brackish streams that are influenced by tides can also serve as a home to this turtle in addition to ditches, vernal pools, and sedge meadows. For a habitat to be sufficient for spotted turtle survival it must have areas of soft substrate and at least some aquatic vegetation. An optimum habitat would include shallow and slow-moving waters with soft muddy soil, sedge tussocks, water lilies, sphagnum moss, and cattails. Because it is so often found in areas that contain duckweed, the yellow spots on these turtles may serve as a form of camouflage. The spotted turtle avoids artificial reservoirs and deep, open-water areas.

The spotted turtle can be decidedly terrestrial, spending a good amount of time on land and sometimes basking on patches of grass near its body of water. The females during times of nesting will travel onto land and lay eggs on sunny soil. Nesting also may take place in other terrestrial locations, for instance near man-made dikes or the nest of a muskrat.

== Reproduction ==
A study in Pennsylvania analyzed the reproductive biology of the spotted turtle. Sexual maturity is not reached until age 8, upon which researchers found that courtship and nesting periods typically ranged from March until June. The courtships involved females being frantically chased by one to several males for approximately 15 to 30 minutes. During the chase, females&#x27; tails and legs were often bit by males. If two males were present, they occasionally stopped the chase to fight with one another and the losing male retreated. When the female was caught, the male mounted her and placed his tail beneath the female while grasping her carapace tightly. Females later constructed their nest in well-drained areas that were exposed to full sunlight. Clutches can range from 1–8 with an average of 3–4. These animals also exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination, meaning that the outside temperature during the incubation period determines the sex of the hatchling with males resulting from the temperature being lower and females when it&#x27;s higher. After the eggs were laid, they were arranged in the nest by alternate movements of the hind feet. The hind feet were also used to scrape soil and grass back into the nest cavity. Incubation periods were estimated to range between 70 and 83 days.

===Population features===
Although the spotted turtle has been observed in Quebec, no permanent population is known to exist there. However, 104 populations have been discovered in Ontario. Most of these concentrated around Georgian Bay, on the north shore of Lake Erie, and southeastern Ontario. Of the original 104 sites noted, 36 are known to no longer have spotted turtles.

Despite the seemingly large number of populations in Canada, many are not self-sustaining because of the following reasons: the majority of the populations are small, they all have less than 200 individuals, and the areas are all isolated from one another. All told it is estimated that anywhere from 1000 to 2000 spotted turtles live in Canada however, with individual populations ceasing to exist, this number is declining.

The spotted turtle&#x27;s range overlaps that of many other turtles. It can often be found in the same wetlands as wood turtles, bog turtles, snapping turtles, painted turtles, Blanding&#x27;s turtles, eastern box turtles, common musk turtles, and eastern mud turtles.
==Ecology and behavior==

The spotted turtle is one species whose sex is determined by temperature during embryonic development. Some researchers have claimed that global warming may deleteriously impact population sex ratios.

During the freezing temperatures of winter and the extreme heat of summer, spotted turtles become inactive during environmentally unfavorable conditions. However, the species appears to be relatively tolerant of drought conditions. Spotted turtles do become active very early in the spring, and are often active at relatively cold water temperatures during that season. Activity appears to peak during April and May in the northern part of the range. In the warmest part of the summer (when water temperatures exceed 30 °C), they may aestivate terrestrially or aquatically for long periods of time. During summer dormancy, the turtles may burrow into leaf litter in woodlands or marsh edges or open fields; others remain in muskrat burrows or other aquatic refuges. Litzgus and Brooks (2000) have questioned the common presumption that summer dormancy is an attempt by the turtles to avoid high temperatures; data from Ontario and elsewhere suggests that avoidance of predation and conservation of energy resources may be viable alternate explanations. No matter the explanation for dormancy, the &quot;winter&quot; dormant period may commence in late summer or fall, but in almost every instance after a return to aquatic habitats.

Spotted turtles home ranges tend to occupy limited areas of about 0.5 to 3.5 hectares (1.2 to 8.6 acres). Note that due to their size, these small turtles are highly vulnerable to predation, particularly during their frequent terrestrial wanderings. Many specimens will show mutilation injuries and scars from past predation attempts. Raccoons (&quot;Procyon lotor&quot;) are particularly adept at consuming and killing this species. Spotted turtles have been observed to dive into the water and bury themselves in the bottom mud when surprised while basking. Muskrats kill many spotted turtles during the winter dormant period.

===Diet===
The spotted turtle is an active hunter: seeking out prey items in the water by pointing its head into aquatic plants. It feeds at temperatures above , which in its range corresponds to roughly the middle of March onward until September. It is omnivorous and eats exclusively in the water, consuming plant material including aquatic vegetation, green algae, and in at least one instance, wild cranberries. Animal food includes aquatic insect larvae, worms, slugs, millipedes, spiders, crustaceans, tadpoles, salamanders, and several genera of small fish. These items are consumed alive or dead but always in the water. Some of the insects commonly found in with the spotted turtle&#x27;s stomach contents are terrestrial, suggesting the turtle moves onto land to hunt. In captivity, these turtles will eat fruits such as cantaloupe and watermelon and fresh and canned fish.

==Notes==

The spots on spotted turtles vary greatly throughout their range. They can have up to a hundred spots, while some have no spots at all. Spotted turtles shed their scutes in small pieces occasionally resulting in completely smooth shelled specimens. These are very intelligent turtles and have been tested like the wood turtles in mazes and have been proven to have the brain capacity of a mouse. These turtles are only active in the cooler spring months. The spotted turtle is declining throughout eastern North America due to habitat loss and poaching. One study focused specifically on the Southeastern population, and recorded that females had greater shell heights, heavier body masses, and longer plastrons than males. In another study, where radio-telemetry was used, spotted turtle behavior was observed in northeastern America, where distinct seasonal movement patterns revealed that spotted turtles exhibited a positive association in wetlands hosting abundant wood frog egg masses in spring and from spring to late summer, a negative association in forested wetlands was detected. Spotted turtles require frequent terrestrial movements for their diverse habitat requirements which exposes them to potential threats including unsustainable sources of adult mortality such as road kill and illegal collection. Recovery action is necessary to prevent decline of spotted turtles since this species has been determined to have a high risk of extinction in several areas ranging from South Carolina up to Maine in the US and even further north into Ontario, Canada, mitigation requires spatial and temporal shifts in habitat use.

==Conservation==
In Canada, the spotted turtle is federally endangered, while in the United States the spotted turtle is currently under review by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service for protection under the Endangered Species Act. It is listed by the IUCN as endangered, and has &quot;listed&quot; status in many of the states where it occurs. For example, in Indiana the spotted turtle is listed as an endangered species. In the Northeast, it has protective status in five of the six New England states and is listed as a species of special concern in New York.

Habitat destruction, alteration, and conversion, collection for the pet trade, and other human impacts such as vehicle mortality (cars and mowers) are leading to declines in populations. Vehicular mortality is particularly impactful because turtles crossing roads are likely pregnant female turtles in search of a nesting site. Additionally, since reproductive rates of these turtles are low, spotted turtles are extremely susceptible to population impacts.

Due to their aquatic habitat, these turtles are particularly sensitive to pollutants and toxic substances. They will disappear rapidly from areas with declining water quality.

===Actions to benefit the species===

New Hampshire has identified some ways to conserve the habitat of spotted turtles.
These include:
# Designing roads and transportation infrastructure to reduce vehicular mortality
# Public education about relevant rules and regulations on spotted turtles and other reptiles and amphibians (&quot;e.g.&quot; sale and possession)
# Minimize disturbance to turtles from recreational activities
# Additional research and monitoring of the species
# Promote habitat restoration and enhancement
# Promote alternatives to habitat conversion and dewatering

<doc id="1323218" wikidata="Q920355" url="?curid=1323218" title="Primrose League">
<text>The Primrose League was an organisation for spreading Conservative principles in Great Britain. It was founded in 1883.

At a late point in its existence, its declared aims (published in the &quot;Primrose League Gazette&quot;, vol. 83, no. 2, March/April 1979) were:

# To Uphold and support God, Queen, and Country, and the Conservative cause;
# To provide an effective voice to represent the interests of our members and to bring the experience of the Leaders to bear on the conduct of public affairs for the common good;
# To encourage and help our members to improve their professional competence as leaders;
# To fight for free enterprise.

==Foundation==
The primrose was known as the &quot;favourite flower&quot; of Benjamin Disraeli, and so became associated with him. Queen Victoria sent a wreath of primroses to his funeral on 26 April 1881 with the handwritten message: &quot;His favourite flowers: from Osborne: a tribute of affectionate regard from Queen Victoria&quot;. On the day of the unveiling of Disraeli&#x27;s statue all Conservative members of the House of Commons were decorated with the primrose.

A small group had for some time discussed the means for obtaining the support of the people for Conservative principles. Sir Henry Drummond Wolff said to Lord Randolph Churchill, &quot;Let us found a primrose league&quot;. A meeting was held at the Carlton Club shortly afterwards, consisting of Churchill, Wolff, Sir John Gorst, Percy Mitford, Colonel Fred Burnaby and some others, to whom were subsequently added Satchell Hopkins, J. B. Stone, Rowlands and some Birmingham supporters of Burnaby, who also wished to return Lord Randolph Churchill as a Conservative member for that city. These founding members assisted in remodelling the original statutes, first drawn up by Wolff. Wolff had for some years perceived the influence exercised in benefit societies by badges and titular appellations, and he endeavoured to devise some quaint phraseology that would be attractive to the working classes. The title of &quot;Knight Harbinger&quot; was taken from an office no longer existing in the Royal Household, and a regular gradation was instituted for the honorific titles and decorations assigned to members. This idea, though at first ridiculed, was greatly developed since the foundation of the order; and new distinctions and decorations were founded, also contributing to the attractions of the league.
The motto was &quot;Imperium et libertas&quot;; the seal, three primroses; and the badge, a monogram containing the letters PL, surrounded by primroses. Many other badges and various articles of jewellery were designed later, with this flower as an emblem.

A small office was first taken on a second floor in Essex Street, The Strand, but this had soon to be abandoned, as the dimensions of the League rapidly increased. The league had two types of members who paid different annual subscriptions: full members (knights and dames) who were usually charged half a crown, and associate members who paid a few pence.

Ladies were generally included in the first organisation of the League, but subsequently a separate Ladies Branch and Grand Council were formed. The founder of the Ladies Grand Council was Lady Borthwick (afterwards Lady Glenesk), and the first meeting of the committee took place at her house in Piccadilly in March 1885. &quot;The Primrose League was the first political organisation to give women the same status and responsibilities as men&quot;. The ladies who formed the first committee were: Lady Borthwick; the Dowager Duchess of Marlborough (first lady president); Lady Wimborne; Lady Randolph Churchill; Lady Charles Beresford; the Dowager Marchioness of Waterford; Julia, Marchioness of Tweeddale; Julia, Countess of Jersey; Mrs (subsequently Lady) Hardman; Lady Dorothy Nevill; the Honorable Lady Campbell (later Lady Blythswood); the Honorable Mrs Armitage; Mrs Bischoffsheim and Meresia Nevill (the first secretary of the Ladies Council).
When the league had become a success, it was joined by Lord Salisbury and Sir Stafford Northcote, who were elected Grand Masters. Between its inauguration and 1910, its numbers gradually increased, as may be seen by the above table.

Sir Winston Churchill, in his book on his father, &quot;Lord Randolph Churchill&quot; published in 1906, stated that the Primrose League had one million paid up members &quot;determined to promote the cause of Toryism&quot;.

Membership of the League was said to be &quot;well over a million by the early 1890s&quot;, and at that time enjoyed more support than the British trade union movement. 6,000 people were members of the League in Bolton in 1900, which was as large as the national membership of the Independent Labour Party during the same time. However, by 1912 the League&#x27;s membership had fallen to just over 650,000 as other leagues emerged, such as the Tariff Reform League and the Budget Protest League.

With the granting of universal suffrage after the First World War, the Conservative Party leadership decided that &quot;A mass membership now seemed a necessary object if the Conservatives were to be on an equal footing with the mass battalions of the trade unions&quot;, and so with the scaling up of party membership, the need for ancillary support from organisations such as the Primrose League diminished, particularly as a conduit of female support who had now gained the vote and could be full members of the Conservative Party.

==Activities==
Members were expected to actively support the league, and to keep up interest, a programme of social events was organised for the membership, &quot;of which the Primrose summer fête, often held in the grounds of stately homes opened for the first time for this purpose, provided the grand annual climax&quot;. There were, however, also day excursions and winter evening entertainments for league members, leading Flora Thompson to conclude that &quot;It was no wonder the pretty little enamelled primrose badge, worn as a brooch or lapel ornament, was so much in evidence&quot;. At the events, the members would often be addressed by, and have the opportunity to meet members of the Parliamentary Conservative Party.

Part of the attraction of the League was due to its cross-class appeal: workers could enjoy the fêtes; the middle-classes could enjoy meeting the local nobs; while for upper-class women, the League offered an opportunity for political mobilisation, with the new bicycles providing means for them to reach a wide range of country villages.

===Twentieth-century decline===

By the early 20th century, the League had lost some of its early impetus, but prior to World War II, the League was still able to pack the Royal Albert Hall for its annual Grand Habitation. It continued its activities after the war, and celebrated its centenary in 1983 with its usual round of social and political events.

The League&#x27;s &quot;Gazette&quot; carried articles by leading politicians of the day, including even then-leader and future Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (in September/October 1977), but following the resignation of its industrious secretary of 45 years, Evelyn Hawley, C.B.E., at the end of 1988, it went into terminal decline.

==Disbandment==
The &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; reported on 16 December 2004: 
&quot;[T]his week saw a significant event for any observers of political history: after 121 years, the Primrose League was finally wound up. The league&#x27;s aim was to promote Toryism across the country. &#x27;In recent years, our meetings have become smaller and smaller,&#x27; says Lord Mowbray, one of the league&#x27;s leading lights. Its remaining funds have been donated to Tory coffers. &#x27;On Monday, I presented Michael Howard and Liam Fox with a cheque for £70,000,&#x27; adds Lord Mowbray proudly.&quot;

== Attempt at resurrection ==
On 3 April 2023, The Primrose League Ltd was registered with Companies House and, on 12 July 2023, it was publicly resurrected in a Press Release. The next day Henry Bolton OBE, President of the Primrose League, appeared on the UK outlet TalkTV to discuss the League with presenter Mike Graham.

Bolton described the League&#x27;s role as being to further the interests of the Nation, [Disraelian] One Nation and cultural conservatism. Bolton described the League as being independent of any political party and intending to exercise political influence through the weight of its members.

The Primrose League website states: &quot;True conservatism advocates the furtherance of the United Kingdom and its interests, respect for our history, culture and customs, preservation of established institutions and traditional principles within a political democracy. We believe in policies designed to benefit the ordinary person as well as the Nation. We believe society should be allowed to evolve in an organic way, rather than being engineered, and that members of society have obligations towards each other.  Our purpose is to pursue the goal of ever greater confidence, optimism, prosperity, security, pride and patriotism in the United Kingdom, preserve our democratic system and constitutional monarchy, the rights of our citizens, and the broad interests of the Nation against socialist attack. For us, now and henceforward, these must be the main purposes of political action and public life.&quot;

<doc id="1323221" wikidata="Q30638" url="?curid=1323221" title="Enderbury Island">
<text>Enderbury Island, also known as Ederbury Island or Guano Island, is a small, uninhabited atoll 63 km ESE of Kanton Island in the Pacific Ocean at . It is about 1 mile (1.6 km) wide and 3 miles (4.8 km) long, with a reef stretching out 60–200 metres. Forming a part of the Canton and Enderbury Islands condominium from 1939 to 1979, the island is now a possession of the Republic of Kiribati.

Kiribati declared the Phoenix Islands Protected Area in 2006, with the park being expanded in 2008. The 164,200-square-mile (425,300-square-kilometer) marine reserve contains eight coral atolls including Kanton.

==Flora and fauna==
===Enderbury&#x27;s flora and fauna===
The island is flat and bare, with elevations between 15 and 22 feet. Vegetation consists of low shrubs, including herbs, bunchgrass, sida and morning-glory vines, together with a few clumps of trees, including coconut palms and kou trees. Unlike other atolls, Enderbury has only a small lagoon; most of the island is land. Bird life is abundant, as is the rat population, according to E.H. Bryan Feral cats used to exist, but recently died out. Enderbury has been identified as the most important green sea turtle nesting area in the Phoenix Islands group.

An expedition to eradicate the Polynesian rat population was conducted in 2011.

===Enderbury&#x27;s reefs===
The 2000 surveys (Obura, et al.) identified that sites on the reef averaged 20–25% Live Coral Cover. The dominance of encrusting/submassive corals at the windward site and the few large coral colonies and many small ones were seen, indicating frequent breakage preventing growth to large size, with continual breakage of branching and plating forms. Damage to branching and plating forms was as the result of wave energy on the southern, eastern and northern reefs of the islands, which create coral rubble at the base of the reef. The most abundant coral species at Enderbury were: &quot;Pavona maldivensis&quot;, &quot;Leptastrea purpurea&quot;, &quot;Goniastrea stelligera&quot;, &quot;Favites pentagona&quot;, &quot;Pocillopora verrucosa&quot;, &quot;Porites lutea&quot;, &quot;Pavona minuta&quot;, &quot;Pavona clavus&quot; and &quot;Pavona varians&quot;.

==History==
Enderbury Island was discovered in 1823 by Capt. James J. Coffin from the British whaleship &quot;Transit&quot; and named after Samuel Enderby (1756–1829), owner of a London whaling company. Enderbury is a misspelling. The island was visited by the US Exploring Expedition on January 9, 1841. The first interest in Enderbury came in 1860, with guano mining. The Guano Islands Act of 1856 allowed Americans to claim islands which had guano deposits; Enderbury was one of them. The start was slow, but guano mining in Enderbury reached its peak in 1870, under the Phoenix Guano Company, when 6,000 tons were mined and shipped in 64 days. The Americans left in 1877, and the Pacific entrepreneur John T. Arundel took over in the 1880s.

Very little else occurred at Enderbury until March 1937, when the British Government claimed the Phoenix Islands, including Enderbury, and included it in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony. In March 1938, the U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt also declared Enderbury, along with the nearby island of Canton, to be under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of the Interior. These islands had been deemed a good strategic point for stopover of PanAm flights to Australia and New Zealand, though Enderbury itself was never used for this. In early 1939, a deal was signed for the U.S. and U.K. to share them as the Canton and Enderbury Islands condominium.

Four colonists from the American Equatorial Islands Colonization Project settled on the island in 1938, to uphold the American claim of ownership, but they were evacuated in 1942 during World War II by USCGC Taney, and all buildings were destroyed to prevent them from being used by the Japanese.

Today, Enderbury is home to many species of seabirds which roost there and is under the sovereignty of the Republic of Kiribati. In 2008, it became, together with the other Phoenix Islands, a part of the Phoenix Islands Protected Area (PIPA), the largest marine protected area in the world. The PIPA&#x27;s official website recently revealed that Enderbury has recently been invaded by non-indigenous coconut palms from the islands of Manra, Orona and Nikumaroro.

<text>Wadworth is a brewery company founded in 1875 in Devizes, Wiltshire, England, best known for their 6X beer brand.

==History==
Wadworth &amp; Co. was founded in 1875 when Henry Wadworth purchased the Northgate Brewery in Devizes. It was not long before they exceeded their capacity at the Northgate Brewery and in 1885 they moved premises to a new facility close to their original site. Since then, the brewer has been a major influence on the economy of Devizes and a major provider of ale in the south of England.
The present Northgate Brewery is a tower brewery opened in 1885.

==Beers==
While 6X is the brewer&#x27;s best known beer, the company also produce other beers, including several seasonal ales.

Beers available throughout the year:

* 6X (4.1% abv on draught, 4.3% abv cans and bottles) 
* Henry&#x27;s Original IPA (3.6%abv)
* Horizon – Golden Ale (4.0% abv)
* Bishop&#x27;s Tipple – Golden ale, full flavoured (5.0% abv on draught, 5.5% abv in bottle)
* Swordfish – A stronger version of 6X with the addition of Pusser&#x27;s Navy Rum (5.0% abv)
* Corvus – A nitro keg stout available in 30L format with a chocolate &amp; coffee taste and creamy head

Seasonal beers:

* St George &amp; The Dragon – (March and April)
* Lily The Pink – a blend of golden beer and Angostura bitters
* Red, White &amp; Brew – a hoppy golden beer brewed initially to commemorate the Jubilee and the Olympics (May–July)
* Farmers Glory – a traditional English ale (July and August, 4.7% abv)
* Malt &amp; Hops – using fresh hops straight from the bine (September and October)
* Blunderbuss – a red autumn ale flavoured with elderberry (5.0% abv)
* Old Timer – winter ale (December and January)

==6X==
The &quot;X&quot; in 6X refers to a traditional grading system for strong beer; it was first brewed in 1923. In 2007, 6X won the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; and Cask Marque Best Of British Beer Award for Wales and the West Country. 6X is available in draught cask, keg, can and bottle formats.

==Operations==
Wadworths still use traditional shire horses to deliver their casked ale to local pubs in Devizes. Their radius of the operation is roughly ; beyond this, motor vehicles are used. The ale can be delivered in metal or wooden barrels.

The brewery owns four horses (Monty, Max and Archie and Sam) which are stabled at the brewery. As well as delivering ale, the horses compete in shows and events throughout the country. They are often featured in the local press and have featured in television programmes such as &quot;Countryfile&quot;.

Wadworth operate a Visitor Centre and gift shop at the brewery. Tours of the brewery can be taken and may include a tutored tasting of the Wadworth range and visits to the shire horses and sign-writing shop.

<text>Electrohydrodynamics (EHD), also known as electro-fluid-dynamics (EFD) or electrokinetics, is the study of the dynamics of electrically charged fluids. Electrohydrodynamics (EHD) is a joint domain of electrodynamics and fluid dynamics mainly focused on the fluid motion induced by electric fields. EHD, in its simplest form, involves the application of an electric field to a fluid medium, resulting in fluid flow, form, or properties manipulation. These mechanisms arise from the interaction between the electric fields and charged particles or polarization effects within the fluid. The generation and movement of charge carriers (ions) in a fluid subjected to an electric field are the underlying physics of all EHD-based technologies.

The electric forces acting on particles consist of electrostatic (Coulomb) and electrophoresis force (first term in the following equation)., dielectrophoretic force (second term in the following equation), and electrostrictive force (third term in the following equation):

formula_1

This electrical force is then inserted in Navier-Stokes equation, as a body (volumetric) force.EHD covers the following types of particle and fluid transport mechanisms: electrophoresis, electrokinesis, dielectrophoresis, electro-osmosis, and electrorotation. In general, the phenomena relate to the direct conversion of electrical energy into kinetic energy, and &quot;vice versa&quot;.

In the first instance, shaped electrostatic fields (ESF&#x27;s) create hydrostatic pressure (HSP, or motion) in dielectric media. When such media are fluids, a flow is produced. If the dielectric is a vacuum or a solid, no flow is produced. Such flow can be directed against the electrodes, generally to move the electrodes. In such case, the moving structure acts as an electric motor. Practical fields of interest of EHD are the common air ioniser, electrohydrodynamic thrusters and EHD cooling systems.

In the second instance, the converse takes place. A powered flow of medium within a shaped electrostatic field adds energy to the system which is picked up as a potential difference by electrodes. In such case, the structure acts as an electrical generator.

== Electrokinesis ==

Electrokinesis is the particle or fluid transport produced by an electric field acting on a fluid having a net mobile charge. (See -kinesis for explanation and further uses of the -kinesis suffix.) &quot;Electrokinesis&quot; was first observed by Ferdinand Frederic Reuss during 1808, in the electrophoresis of clay particles The effect was also noticed and publicized in the 1920s by Thomas Townsend Brown which he called the Biefeld–Brown effect, although he seems to have misidentified it as an electric field acting on gravity. The flow rate in such a mechanism is linear in the electric field. Electrokinesis is of considerable practical importance in microfluidics, because it offers a way to manipulate and convey fluids in microsystems using only electric fields, with no moving parts.

The force acting on the fluid, is given by the equation
formula_2
where, formula_3 is the resulting force, measured in newtons, formula_4 is the current, measured in amperes, formula_5 is the distance between electrodes, measured in metres, and formula_6 is the ion mobility coefficient of the dielectric fluid, measured in m2/(V·s).

If the electrodes are free to move within the fluid, while keeping their distance fixed from each other, then such a force will actually propel the electrodes with respect to the fluid.

&quot;Electrokinesis&quot; has also been observed in biology, where it was found to cause physical damage to neurons by inciting movement in their membranes. It is discussed in R. J. Elul&#x27;s &quot;Fixed charge in the cell membrane&quot; (1967).

== Water electrokinetics ==

In October 2003, Dr. Daniel Kwok, Dr. Larry Kostiuk and two graduate students from the University of Alberta discussed a method to convert hydrodynamic to electrical energy by exploiting the natural electrokinetic properties of a liquid such as ordinary tap water, by pumping fluid through tiny micro-channels with a pressure difference. This technology could lead to a practical and clean energy storage device, replacing batteries for devices such as mobile phones or calculators which would be charged up by simply compressing water to high pressure. Pressure would then be released on demand, for the fluid to flow through micro-channels. When water travels, or streams over a surface, the ions in the water &quot;rub&quot; against the solid, leaving the surface slightly charged. Kinetic energy from the moving ions would thus be converted to electrical energy. Although the power generated from a single channel is extremely small, millions of parallel micro-channels can be used to increase the power output.
This streaming potential, water-flow phenomenon was discovered in 1859 by German physicist Georg Hermann Quincke. 

== Electrokinetic instabilities ==

The fluid flows in microfluidic and nanofluidic devices are often stable and strongly damped by viscous forces (with Reynolds numbers of order unity or smaller). However, heterogeneous ionic conductivity fields in the presence of applied electric fields can, under certain conditions, generate an unstable flow field owing to electrokinetic instabilities (EKI). Conductivity gradients are prevalent in on-chip electrokinetic processes such as preconcentration methods (e.g. field amplified sample stacking and isoelectric focusing), multidimensional assays, and systems with poorly specified sample chemistry. The dynamics and periodic morphology of &quot;electrokinetic instabilities&quot; are similar to other systems with Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities. The particular case of a flat plane geometry with homogeneous ions injection in the bottom side leads to a mathematical frame identical to the Rayleigh–Bénard convection.

EKI&#x27;s can be leveraged for rapid mixing or can cause undesirable dispersion in sample injection, separation and stacking. These instabilities are caused by a coupling of electric fields and ionic conductivity gradients that results in an electric body force. This coupling results in an electric body force in the bulk liquid, outside the electric double layer, that can generate temporal, convective, and absolute flow instabilities. Electrokinetic flows with conductivity gradients become unstable when the electroviscous stretching and folding of conductivity interfaces grows faster than the dissipative effect of molecular diffusion.

Since these flows are characterized by low velocities and small length scales, the Reynolds number is below 0.01 and the flow is &quot;laminar&quot;. The onset of instability in these flows is best described as an electric &quot;Rayleigh number&quot;.

<text>Jarun () is a neighborhood in the southwestern part of Zagreb, Croatia. It was named after Lake Jarun, formed by the Sava River, now located on the southern edge of the neighborhood.

==Lake==
The lake is the location of the Jarun sports and leisure center, where people can row, paddle, sail, surf, swim, jog, bike, roller skate, and skateboard. Around the lake are many nightclubs and cafes such as Aquarius. Jarun Lake is currently a home of INmusic festival. 
Also, around the lake Jarun there is a &quot;Walk of fame&quot; with the pictures and biography information of great athletes of Croatian sport.

==Neighborhood==

The area covered by the local city council Jarun is 398.06 hectares, with 12,149 inhabitants (2011).

The development of Jarun began at the end of the 1970s when it was merely a village, with the building of apartment blocks. Development increased in 1987 due to the building of the sports and leisure center (because of the Universiade in Zagreb the same year). It is currently a middle-class neighborhood with a very low crime rate.

The borders of Jarun are Horvaćanska Street to the north with Staglišće, Hrvatski Sokol Street with Vrbani to the west, Vrapčak Creek with Gredice to the east, and the Sava River to the south. Jarun, in the wider sense, also includes the neighborhoods of Staglišće and Gredice.

<doc id="1323246" wikidata="Q415103" url="?curid=1323246" title="Acenaphthene">
<text>Acenaphthene is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) consisting of naphthalene with an ethylene bridge connecting positions 1 and 8. It is a colourless solid. Coal tar consists of about 0.3% of this compound.

==Production and reactions==
Acenaphthene was prepared for the first time in 1866 by Marcellin Berthelot by reacting hot napthalene vapours with acetylene, and a year later he reproduced a similar reaction with ethylene as well as discovered acenaphthene in coal tar. Later Berthelot and Bardy synthesized the compound by cyclization of α-ethylnaphthalene. Industrially, it is still obtained from coal tar together with its derivative acenaphthylene (and many other compounds).

Like other arenes, acenaphthene forms complexes with low valent metal centers. One example is (η6-acenaphthene)Mn(CO)3]+.

==Uses==
It is used on a large scale to prepare naphthalene dicarboxylic anhydride, which is a precursor to dyes and optical brighteners (such as 1,4-bis(2-benzoxazolyl)naphthalene). Besides that, the anhydride is also the precursor to perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride, precursor to several commercial pigments and dyes.

<doc id="1323247" wikidata="Q442343" url="?curid=1323247" title="IP tunnel">
<text>An IP tunnel is an Internet Protocol (IP) network communications channel between two networks. It is used to transport another network protocol by encapsulation of its packets.

IP tunnels are often used for connecting two disjoint IP networks that don&#x27;t have a native routing path to each other, via an underlying routable protocol across an intermediate transport network. In conjunction with the IPsec protocol they may be used to create a virtual private network between two or more private networks across a public network such as the Internet. Another prominent use is to connect islands of IPv6 installations across the IPv4 Internet.

In IP tunnelling, every IP packet, including addressing information of its source and destination IP networks, is encapsulated within another packet format native to the transit network.

At the borders between the source network and the transit network, as well as the transit network and the destination network, gateways are used that establish the end-points of the IP tunnel across the transit network. Thus, the IP tunnel endpoints become native IP routers that establish a standard IP route between the source and destination networks. Packets traversing these end-points from the transit network are stripped from their transit frame format headers and trailers used in the tunnelling protocol and thus converted into native IP format and injected into the IP stack of the tunnel endpoints. In addition, any other protocol encapsulations used during transit, such as IPsec or Transport Layer Security, are removed.

IP in IP, sometimes called &quot;ipencap&quot;, is an example of IP encapsulation within IP and is described in RFC 2003. Other variants of the IP-in-IP variety are IPv6-in-IPv4 (&quot;6in4&quot;) and IPv4-in-IPv6 (&quot;4in6&quot;).

IP tunneling often bypasses simple firewall rules transparently since the specific nature and addressing of the original datagrams are hidden. Content-control software is usually required to block IP tunnels.

== History ==
The first specification of IP tunneling was in RFC 1075, which described DVMRP, the first IP multicast routing protocol. Because multicast used special IPv4 addresses, testing DVMRP required a way to get IP datagrams across portions of the Internet that did not yet recognize multicast addresses. This was solved by IP tunneling. The first approach to IP tunneling used an IP Loose Source Route and Record (LSRR) Option to hide the multicast address from the non-multicast aware routers. A multicast-aware destination router would remove the LSRR option from the packet and restore the multicast IP address to the packet&#x27;s IP destination field. The other approach in the DVMRP specification was IP in IP, as described above. IP in IP soon became the preferred approach, and was later put to use in the Mbone.

<doc id="1323255" wikidata="Q415128" url="?curid=1323255" title="Acenaphthylene">
<text>Acenaphthylene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon is an ortho- and peri-fused tricyclic hydrocarbon. The molecule resembles naphthalene with positions 1 and 8 connected by a -CH=CH- unit. It is a yellow solid. Unlike many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, it has no fluorescence.

==Occurrence==
Acenaphthylene occurs as about 2% of coal tar. It is produced industrially by gas phase dehydrogenation of acenaphthene.

==Reactions==
Hydrogenation gives the more saturated compound acenaphthene. Chemical reduction affords the radical anion sodium or potassium acenaphthalenide, which is used as a strong reductant (E = -2.26 V vs FC).

It functions as a ligand for some organometallic compounds.

==Uses==
Polymerisation of acenaphthylene with acetylene in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst gives electrically conductive polymers. Acenaphthylene possesses excellent properties as an antioxidant in cross-linked polyethylene and ethylene-propylene rubber. Thermal trimerization of acenaphthylene leads to decacyclene, which can be further processed to sulfur dyes.

== Toxicity ==
The no-observed-adverse-effect-level of acenaphthylene after repeated 28-day oral administration to both male and female rats was found to be 4 mg/kg/day.

<text>Battle Picture Weekly (at various times also known as Battle and Valiant, Battle Action, Battle Action Force, Battle and Battle with Storm Force) was a British weekly boys&#x27; war comic published by IPC Magazines from 8 March 1975 to 23 January 1988, when it merged with the new incarnation of &quot;Eagle&quot; after 644 issues. Most stories were set in World War II, with some based on other conflicts, while factual features also focused on warfare.

Devised by Pat Mills and John Wagner in response to rival DC Thomson&#x27;s similarly themed &quot;Warlord&quot;, the title was an instant success. Many of the stories printed in the comic have since received critical acclaim and been published in collected editions, notably &quot;Charley&#x27;s War&quot;. Since 2016 Rebellion Developments have owned the majority of &quot;Battle Picture Weekly&quot;&#x27;s characters and material, and have published revival publications.

==Creation==

By the 1970s, IPC Magazines were one of the largest comics publishers in Britain, their portfolio centred around a stable of weekly anthologies that sold around a quarter of a million copies each. However, since being appointed Editorial Director, John Sanders became increasingly aware the market as a whole was shrinking, with television the main threat. He found many of his attempts frustrated by the structure of the company; many of the company&#x27;s staff (including board members) had been with the company for decades since their days as Amalgamated Press and Fleetway Publications, and were strict traditionalists. IPC launched a slew of titles from 1969 to 1971, but few survived for long.

There was also an archaic internal structure where the company&#x27;s titles were divided into various departments – boy&#x27;s adventure, humour, girls and so forth – which rarely exchanged staff between each other. Having left staff jobs at IPC&#x27;s largest rival DC Thomson, Pat Mills and John Wagner began working as freelancers and submitting scripts for the London company&#x27;s girls comics. Their work for the likes of &quot;Tammy&quot;, &quot;Jinty&quot; and &quot;Princess Tina&quot; featured a degree of social realism and freshness that stood out to Sanders, who looked for an opportunity to work with the pair further. Mills interviewed for IPC&#x27;s vacant position of Managing Editor, but his forthright criticism of the company&#x27;s failings went down poorly with the board, but reaffirmed Sanders&#x27; belief that fresh blood was needed.

An opportunity to recruit Mills and Wagner came in 1974, when DC Thomson launched &quot;Warlord&quot;. While war comics had been a staple of British boys&#x27; titles since the fifties – both as features in anthologies and as a staple of picture library titles like &quot;Commando&quot; and &quot;War Picture Library&quot; – &quot;Warlord&quot; was the first ongoing weekly to centre on the genre entirely. The variety was instead provided by the stories being spread between different theatres and services; the result was a smash hit. IPC had a firm policy of responding to any new hit by DC Thomson or any other rival by launching a similar title of their own in response, even keeping an inventory of unpublished strips in various genres to speed up the process. However, Sanders wanted a different approach for IPC&#x27;s answer to &quot;Warlord&quot;, turning to Mills and Wagner.

Despite initial reluctance to work in the genre, Mills and Wagner took the offer. One of their key aims was to provide a more working class makeup to the characters, something they felt was sorely lacking in other boys&#x27; comics. With a tight lead-in of between 6 and 8 weeks the pair started assembling the new title. To keep friction with other staff to a minimum the pair were placed in an office in the girls&#x27; department, and told any staffers who asked they were working on a comic for the blind. When word did get out the decision was not popular with the IPC staffers, not least because as freelancers Mills and Wagner were paid better. However, Sanders stuck to his guns.

The plan was the pair would set up an initial round of stories and edit the opening issues before handing over to a staff editor. However, slow progress meant the more experienced Dave Hunt was assigned to help. He was one of the more flexible staffers however and largely tried to curb the pair&#x27;s perfectionism rather than resisting their ideas. Other important figures in the creation of what would become &quot;Battle Picture Weekly&quot; were writer Gerry Finley-Day (who Mills and Wagner had worked with on girls&#x27; comics); sub-editor Steve MacManus; Eric Hebden, a military veteran who served as technical advisor; and art director Doug Church, who used the web offset printing method to give the comic a clean, detailed look. Mills meanwhile insisted on the use of machine lettering for the strips, a trademark of DC Thomson, as he felt it was superior to the hand lettering available from the time. The only thing they were refused revolved around the free gift cover-mounted on the first issue – a set of transfers depicting military emblems, Mills and Wagner had requested it include German insignia. IPC&#x27;s competitions editor Peter Lewis, responsible for sourcing the items and a decorated World War II veteran, threatened to resign if they were included; the pair backed down, and Wagner later admitted they had been insensitive.

==Publishing history==
===&quot;Battle Picture Weekly&quot;===
Despite the meticulous approach of Mills and Wagner, the first issue of &quot;Battle Picture Weekly&quot; met its launch date, appearing on 2 March 1975. It contained eight initial stories. &quot;D-Day Dawson&quot; featured a British soldier with an inoperable bullet lodged near his heart; according to Finley-Day, the strip&#x27;s title was chosen due to prominent coverage of D-Day&#x27;s 30th anniversary in 1974. &quot;Rat Pack&quot; featured a group of four convict soldiers given suicide missions, which Finley-Day acknowledged was heavily influenced by film &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot;; art was provided by Spaniard Carlos Ezquerra, initially on a part-time basis while he worked through commitments to DC Thomson. &quot;The Bootneck Boy&quot; featured the travails of an aspiring Royal Marine; it was again written by Finley-Day, who based the protagonist&#x27;s attitude on that of Alf Tupper from DC Thomson&#x27;s &quot;The Tough of the Track&quot; story in &quot;Victor&quot;. &quot;Lofty&#x27;s One-Man Luftwaffe&quot; featured a bilingual Allied pilot mistaken for a German counterpart and working to sabotage the Luftwaffe from within. &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot;-influenced &quot;Day of the Eagle&quot; introduced Special Operations Executive agent Mike Nelson, whose first mission was to kill Adolf Hitler. &quot;The Flight of the Golden Hinde&quot; concerned an obsessive captain trying to complete a voyage in a replica of the &quot;Golden Hind&quot; during wartime and &quot;The Terror Behind the Bamboo Curtain&quot; was set in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp in occupied Burma, which Hunt recalled was constantly rewritten by Mills and Wagner in an attempt to get it right.. The title was a strong seller from the start, and with the setup done Mills and Wagner moved on, the former to begin work on all-new boys&#x27; comic &quot;Action&quot; and the latter to work as editor on the flagging &quot;Valiant&quot;.

The contents of the comic saw their first shake-up in May 1975, decided by the standard IPC research of requesting readers write in ranking the stories and dropping the least popular. &quot;The Terror Behind the Bamboo Curtain&quot; and &quot;Flight of the Golden Hinde&quot; were the two dropped, making way for &quot;Coward&#x27;s Brand on Bradley&quot; and &quot;The Fortrose Falcon&quot;; the latter was the first &quot;Battle Picture Library&quot; strip to not entirely revolve around World War II. However, the new arrivals were based on Mills and Wagner ideas bumped from the launch issue, and neither lasted long. Another thing thrown up by the research was that while &quot;Battle&quot; attempted to split stories between land, sea and air forces, readers far preferred those about the army to the rest. It wasn&#x27;t until January 1976 that &quot;Battle&quot; found another enduring character in the form of Major Eazy – a laconic cheroot-smoking soldier modelled on Britt, James Coburn&#x27;s character in classic Western film &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;. Drawn by Ezquerra and written by Alan Hebden (son of Eric), the Bentley-driving British officer was instantly popular with readers. Three months later IPC changed printers and Battle was forced to switch from web offset to letterpress. Another popular new arrival was &quot;The Team That Went To War&quot; by writer Tom Tully and artist Mike Western, which featured football team Barchester United enlisting – and getting butchered – &quot;en masse&quot; in 1940.

IPC meanwhile had launched Mills&#x27; brainchild &quot;Action&quot; to strong sales and critical reaction. The comic&#x27;s increased level of violence and nihilism spurred Hunt on; he was particularly envious of the title&#x27;s war strip &quot;Hellman of Hammer Force&quot;, launching &quot;Fighter from the Sky&quot; (with a German paratrooper as the protagonist) in response, as well as the experimental &quot;Hold Hill 109&quot;, featuring a unit of thirteen Desert Rats whittled down over the course of a defensive action. More whimsical was &quot;Rattling Rommel&quot;, which centred on a sentient scout car. August 1976 saw an overhaul of the title caused by the availability of Wagner, who had quit as editor of &quot;Valiant&quot; in frustration over the resistance he found to his radical changes. His contribution was the brutal &quot;Darkie&#x27;s Mob&quot;, featuring a rogue unit behind Japanese lines in Burma led by the fearsome Captain Joe Darkie. The strip was one of four new stories in the 14 August 1976 edition, which featured a cover by Don Lawrence. The other debutants were &quot;Operation Shark&quot; (young boys in the Channel Islands begin resistance efforts against the German occupation forces), &quot;Yellow Jack&quot; (about a greedy British soldier who fought like a demon for the chance to loot) and &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot; (about an amnesiac Tommy unaware he&#x27;s marked for death).

===&quot;Battle and Valiant&quot;===
Despite the public campaign that forced &quot;Action&quot; out of circulation in the autumn, &quot;Battle Picture Weekly&quot; remained relatively untouched despite its violence. Hunt would recall receiving a letter of complaint about an episode of &quot;Darkie&#x27;s Mob&quot;, but replied that the content was based on a real-life incident and received no further censure. Instead the next change to &quot;Battle&quot; would come in October when the flagging &quot;Valiant&quot; was absorbed into the comic. Three strips were continued from the cancelled title from 23 October 1976 – two were war-themed, &quot;Soldier Sharp: The Rat of the Rifles&quot; and &quot;The Black Crow&quot;, while Wagner&#x27;s Clint Eastwood-inspired Judge Dredd-prefiguring maverick cop One-Eyed Jack wasn&#x27;t. Hunt was not in favour of diluting &quot;Battle&quot;&#x27;s all-war content; nevertheless the merger considerably boosted the comic&#x27;s sales. The other new arrival was &quot;Valiant&quot;&#x27;s long-running flagship character Captain Hurricane; however his action-comedy would have fit badly with the rest of the comic, and he was instead assigned as host of the letters page. The unexpected merger saw three stories – &quot;Operation Shark&quot;, &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot; and &quot;Yellow Jack&quot; – cut short to make space. &quot;Battle and Valiant&quot; also received the Airfix Modeller&#x27;s Club page, hosted by club president and comedian Dick Emery. The manufacturer paid a £100 a week for the page, a sum which Hunt recalled paid for around half of the scripts in the issue.

D-Day Dawson finally met his end in the 22 January 1977 edition. The following week three new stories debut in the hundredth issue – &quot;Johnny Red&quot; followed pilot Johnny &quot;Red&quot; Reburn, who seized an opportunity to fly a Hurricane in support of the Red Air Force&#x27;s Falcon squadron on the Eastern Front, by Tully and his frequent &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot; collaborator Joe Colquhoun. The series was a then-rare positive portrayal of Russian characters in a British comic of the time. &quot;Joe Two Beans&quot; followed a taciturn Native American fighting for the US in the Pacific War, while a rare crossover saw Major Eazy take command of the Rat Pack. Mills and Wagner meanwhile were working on new science fiction title &quot;2000 AD&quot;. Hunt was wary of the pair poaching Ezquerra, and had Alan Hebden create the American Civil War-set &quot;El Mestizo&quot; specifically to keep the artist on &quot;Battle&quot;. As it was, Ezquerra was overlooked for &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; in favour of Mike McMahon, a snub he took with considerable umbrage. &quot;Darkie&#x27;s Mob&quot; meanwhile came to a violent end, and was replaced by &quot;The Sarge&quot;, a similarly gritty collaboration between Finley-Day and Western, from the 25 June 1977 issue.

===&quot;Battle Action&quot;===
Meanwhile, &quot;Action&quot; had returned from its six-week 1976 sabbatical heavily sanitised under the direct supervision of Sanders, himself under strict orders from IPC&#x27;s board. The resulting bowdlerised version rapidly lost sales, and in November 1977 &quot;Action&quot; was folded into &quot;Battle&quot;. &quot;Hellman of Hammer Force&quot; was a suitable addition, while secret agent Dredger was reassigned to military intelligence. However, &quot;Spinball&quot; – a watered down version of &quot;Action&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Rollerball&quot;-inspired &quot;Death Game 1999&quot; – was unconvincingly reworked into &quot;Spinball Wars&quot;. The new arrivals meant the long-running &quot;The Bootneck Boy&quot; was among those to make way. Further change came when MacManus left his post of assistant editor to set up Starlord, a new IPC science fiction weekly. Ezquerra, still smarting from being overlooked for Judge Dredd, followed to work on Strontium Dog. He was replaced by Jim Storrie, and a fresh round of new features began in July 1978. &quot;Operation Shark&quot; returned, Hunt having never been pleased with the rushed conclusion ahead of the &quot;Valiant&quot; merger. Following the successful launch of &quot;2000 AD&quot; Mills was free and returned to contribute &quot;Samurai&quot;, which featured a Japanese protagonist; however, the writer quickly drew tired of the strip and ended it swiftly before beginning work on his next project. Storrie&#x27;s tenure on &quot;Battle Action&quot; was short-lived as he was reassigned and replaced by Nick Landau – who lasted little longer, quitting IPC after feeling he was being misled about being granted editorship of &quot;2000 AD&quot;.

January 1979 saw the debut of three new stories, as well as factual feature &quot;True Life Heroes&quot;. &quot;Glory Rider&quot; focused on a reckless American tank commander, while &quot;HMS Nightshade&quot; by Wagner was an attempt to make a successful naval story, something he and Mills had found difficult. With John Cooper taking over &quot;Johnny Red&quot;, Mills meanwhile worked with Colquhoun on a new strip, &quot;Charley&#x27;s War&quot;. Mills wanted to do an anti-war strip and found the trenches of World War I a perfect backdrop. He researched the conflict extensively to avoid repeating mainstream histories, notably consulting huge archives of soldiers&#x27; letters home which left him greatly moved. Hunt was highly impressed, and swore to keep the strip in the comic &quot;whether the readers like it or not&quot;. However, the comic&#x27;s most significant editorial change to date came in September 1979, when Hunt was moved over to work on new title &quot;Tornado&quot; as part of a reshuffle that saw Barrie Tomlinson appointed as group editor. Hunt&#x27;s place was taken by Terry Magee, who responded to falling sales by returning the Rat Pack to service.

===&quot;Battle&quot;===
In July 1980 the comic underwent a significant redesign, with a new logo (with &quot;Action&quot; disappearing from the title, which was now simply &quot;Battle&quot;) and – for the first time – a front cover strip (typically rotated between &quot;Johnny Red&quot; and &quot;Charley&#x27;s War&quot;), as well as switching to hand lettering. Another change was the appearance of creator credits, fruit of Mills and others&#x27; lobbying of Sanders to reverse IPC policy. However, sales continued to dip – not helped by the 1980 NUJ strike – and to keep profitability the title was forced to use reprints, beginning with &quot;Darkie&#x27;s Mob&quot; in March 1981. Tomlinson and Magee also broke away from the all-war approach and commissioned works from other genres – &quot;The Fists of Jimmy Chang&quot; cashed in on the Bruce Lee-instigated martial arts craze, &quot;Truck Turpin&quot; was based to the boom in interest in trucking and CB radio, while &quot;The Hunters S.I.6&quot; was effectively an unlicensed version of ITV hit &quot;The Professionals&quot;.

The editorial team were met with a quandary when war broke out in the Falkland Islands in 1982, causing a groundswell in British patriotism and increased interest in warfare. After some debate, the editorial team decided not to refer to the conflict until it was concluded. After the end of hostilities Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Fight for the Falklands&quot; began. The writer would later admit a degree of embarrassment at the story, confessing he had got caught up in the jingoistic mood of the time and followed the initial government accounts of the fighting too closely. He was similarly unhappy with science fiction-tinged &quot;Invasion 1984!&quot;, which he co-wrote with Alan Grant; the pair were so prolific at the time that Sanders insisted they use a pseudonym.

===&quot;Battle Action Force&quot;===

July 1983 saw a four-week strip based on Palitoy&#x27;s &quot;Action Force&quot; toyline – based on 3 3/4&quot; versions of the company&#x27;s famous &quot;Action Man&quot; action figure. The strip was popular, and after a run of five free cover-mounted mini-comics, &quot;Battle&quot; was renamed &quot;Battle Action Force&quot; in October 1983. Three strips would be given over to the struggle of the multinational Action Force (consisting of infantry arm Z Force, special operations unit SAS Force, naval service Q-Force and space force Space Force)
against terrorist Baron Ironblood and his endless, fanatical Red Shadows. The new arrival was a mixed blessing for the creators; Mills disliked the idea of appealing to younger readers, while others hated the silliness; John Cooper would describe the helmeted Ironblood as &quot;having a bucket on his head – like Ned Kelly gone mad&quot;. Tomlinson meanwhile recalled each page of &quot;Action Force&quot; required approval from the manufacturer, complicating the production process. However it did bring an increase in sales, and as Palitoy underwrote the costs of the Action Force material it both allowed a steady stream of work and effectively halved the production costs of Battle at a time when the British comic industry as a whole was suffering declining sales. Palitoy also provided money for several circulation-boosting Action Force themed free gifts, the most remarkable of which was a bagged figure.

As a result of the Action Force arrival, the rest of the comic was reduced to just four other strips – &quot;Johnny Red&quot;, &quot;Charley&#x27;s War&quot; (which had undergone a 10-week hiatus in 1982 while Colquhoun recovered from a heart attack), &quot;The Hunters S.I.6&quot; and the reprint slot. The latter was running &quot;Major Eazy&quot;; as a result of Sanders declaring a no-smoking policy across all IPC publications, Eazy&#x27;s cheroot had to be whited out of every frame, a process that Tomlinson wryly noted to many instances where the character appeared to be giving the V sign to readers.

One of the pitfalls of a licensed comic were shown in 1985, when Palitoy licensed American giant Hasbro&#x27;s &quot;G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero&quot; line (a similar 3 3/4 downsizing of G.I. Joe) and issued them under the &quot;Action Force&quot; brand. Not only did the strip suddenly have to integrate a score of new Action Force personnel, but in the toyline terrorist organisation Cobra simply replaced the Red Shadows as the villains, leaving the comic with the unenviable task of providing a fictional transition. The same year, &quot;Charley&#x27;s War&quot; also suffered upheaval. Having always envisioned the strip as a multi-generational epic that would follow Charley&#x27;s descendants to the Troubles, Mills requested a research budget that would allow him to interview veterans ahead of the planned World War II arc, wanting to get the same fresh view beyond mainstream history books. He was refused, and quit; to Mills&#x27; chagrin the World War II story was written along traditional lines by Scott Goodall.

Richard Burton took over as editor in 1986, but was unable to halt the slide in sales. The title at least outlived &quot;Warlord&quot;, which was cancelled in September 1986, but October saw the end of &quot;Charley&#x27;s War&quot;, the strip&#x27;s popularity having nosedived after Mills&#x27; departure and encountering further problems as Colquhoun&#x27;s health declined. A hammer blow to &quot;Battle&quot;&#x27;s hopes came in 1987, when Hasbro bought Palitoy. While they planned to continue the toyline, Hasbro had established a highly successful relationship with Marvel UK to promote their &quot;Transformers&quot; figures, and switched their backing as soon as possible. This not only greatly reduced &quot;Battle&quot;&#x27;s profit margins but also left Burton and Tomlinson scrambling to fill half the comic.

===&quot;Battle with Storm Force&quot;===
Their response was to replace Action Force with the similar anti-terrorist organisation called Storm Force. To make up the budget shortfall, &quot;Johnny Red&quot; was switched to reprints; by May 1987 &quot;Battle&quot; contained four reprints – noticeably stretched out of proportion to fit a change in page size – from seven features, new material consisted of just two &quot;Storm Force&quot; strips&quot; – the latter was not popular and was reduced to a single strip, but the replacement for the dropped episode was another reprint. An attempt to find a new source of funding by producing a licensed strip based on Acamas&#x27; &quot;X-Changers&quot; toyline was little help, as neither the toys nor the strip were popular. In Tomlinson&#x27;s words &quot;the end was inevitable&quot;, and in January 1988 the title was merged into &quot;Eagle&quot;, which it bequeathed &quot;Storm Force&quot; and reprints of &quot;Johnny Red&quot; and &quot;Charley&#x27;s War&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Preacher&quot; creator Garth Ennis was a loyal reader of &quot;Battle&quot;, and won a £2 prize in the 20 January 1979 edition after writing in to point out an error in tank identification in &quot;Crazy Keller&quot;. He would later credit Mills, Wagner and &quot;Battle&quot; in general a major influence on his own writing.

===Titan Comics===
The rights to the original material in &quot;Battle&quot; were among the IPC Youth Group properties consolidated into the resurrected Fleetway Publications and sold to Persimmon BPCC Publishing on 6 July 1987, and were later purchased by Egmont Publishing. From 1 April 2009, Egmont UK in conjunction with W H Smith announced 4 special reprint collections from their stable, including a collection of &quot;Battle&quot; strips.
Titan Comics subsequently licensed various titles from Egmont for reprint collections, beginning with &quot;The Best of Battle&quot; in 2009. Collections of &quot;Charley&#x27;s War&quot;, &quot;Rat Pack&quot;, &quot;Johnny Red&quot;, &quot;Darkie&#x27;s Mob&quot; and two volumes of Ennis-curated &quot;Battle Classics&quot; followed. In November 2015, the character of &quot;Johnny Red&quot; was revived by Ennis and illustrator Keith Burns for a new 8-part mini-series &quot;Johnny Red: Hurricane&quot;, published by Titan Comics.

===Rebellion Developments===
In 2016 Rebellion Developments purchased the rights owned by Egmont. Two years later in August 2018, they issued a new 3-part comic series &quot;Sniper Elite: Resistance&quot; by Keith Richardson and Patrick Goddard, a spin-off from the PS-4 game &quot;Sniper Elite&quot;. The story, set in German-occupied France in 1941, included an appearance by the Rat Pack. &quot;Darkie&#x27;s Mob&quot; and &quot;Charley&#x27;s War&quot; were subsequently reprinted in &quot;Judge Dredd Megazine&quot;, while &quot;Lofty&#x27;s One-Man Luftwaffe&quot; was collected in a supplement given away with &quot;Judge Dredd Megazine&quot; #397. Rebellion also reprinted stories under their Treasury of British Comics imprint, including &quot;El Mestizo&quot;, &quot;Invasion 1984!&quot;, &quot;Major Eazy vs. Rat Pack&quot;, &quot;The Sarge&quot; and &quot;Clash of the Guards&quot;.

In September 2020, Rebellion released a 100-page special issue of &quot;Battle&quot;, again on the Treasury of British Comics imprint. Entitled &quot;Battle of Britain Special&quot;, it featured ten new stories by various writers and artists. Several characters from past issues of &quot;Battle&quot; were revived including &quot;El Mestizo&quot;, written by Alan Hebden, and a &quot;Rat Pack&quot; story by Ennis. Other stories featured new characters and settings including &quot;War Child&quot; by Dan Abnett, a story produced in association with the charity War Child. In June 2022, Rebellion published a hardcover &quot;Battle Action Special&quot; with new stories featuring characters from both comics, written by Ennis and with various artists.

Starting in May 2023, Rebellion published a five-issue series of &quot;Battle Action&quot;, with each issue featuring two complete stories. In 2024, ten issues were announced for that year.

<text>Joseph Brackett Jr. (May 6, 1797 – July 4, 1882) was an American songwriter, author, and elder of The United Society of Believers in Christ&#x27;s Second Appearing, better known as the Shakers. The most famous song attributed to Brackett, &quot;Simple Gifts&quot;, is still widely performed and adapted.
==Biography==
Brackett was born in Cumberland, Massachusetts on May 6, 1797, as Elisha Brackett. When he was 10, his first name was changed to Joseph, like his father&#x27;s, as the Bracketts joined the short-lived Shaker community in Gorham, Maine. This new Shaker community was centered on the Bracketts&#x27; property, until the whole group moved to Poland Hill, Maine, in 1819. Brackett&#x27;s father died there on July 27, 1838, but Brackett continued to rise in the Shaker community, eventually becoming the head of the society in Maine.

Brackett died in the Shaker community of Sabbathday Lake at New Gloucester, Maine, on July 4, 1882.

==Legacy==
Brackett is known today primarily as the presumed author of the Shaker dancing song &quot;Simple Gifts&quot;, which has become an internationally loved tune, both through his original version and many of its adaptations. There are two conflicting narratives of Shaker origin as to the composer of the song. One account attributes the song to a &quot;Negro spirit&quot; heard at Canterbury, New Hampshire, which would make the song a &quot;gift song&quot; received by a Shaker from the spirit world. Alternatively, and far more widely accepted, the song&#x27;s composer is said to be Brackett. The song, written in 1848, was largely unknown outside of Shaker communities until Aaron Copland used the melody in his 1944 composition &quot;Appalachian Spring&quot;. The tune is also known widely through the lyrics &quot;Lord of the Dance&quot;, written by Sydney Carter in 1963. The &quot;Tune Lovers Society&quot;, an online organization designed to preserve and protect American tunes from the past, sponsors a birthday commemoration for Brackett on May 6.

<doc id="1323262" wikidata="Q2359550" url="?curid=1323262" title="Murji'ah">
<text>Murji&#x27;ah (, English: &quot;Those Who Postpone&quot;), also known as Murji&#x27;as or Murji&#x27;ites (singular Murji&#x27;), were an early Islamic sect. The Murji&#x27;ah school of theology prioritized the importance of one&#x27;s professed faith over the acts, deeds, or rituals they performed. They held the opinion that God alone has the right to judge whether or not a Muslim has become an apostate. Consequently, Muslims should practice postponement (&quot;ʾirjāʾ&quot;) of judgment on committers of major sins and not make charges of disbelief (&quot;’takfir’&quot;) or punish accordingly anyone who has professed Islam to be their faith. They also believed that good deeds or omission of them do not affect a person&#x27;s faith, and a person who did no other act of obedience would not be punished in the afterlife as long as they held onto pure faith. They used to say that &quot;disobedience does not harm faith as good deeds do not help with disbelief.&quot; This mode of thought emerged from a concern over Muslim unity as opposed to religious laxity and is often associated with Quran 9:106 (&quot;There are others deferred until the command of God, whether He will punish them or whether He will forgive them&quot;).

== Origins and history ==

The emergence of the Murji&#x27;ah is not attributed to a single founding figure, but to the thought of a collection of figures, including Jahm ibn Safwan, Abu Hanifa, and others.

It is broadly agreed among historians that the Murji&#x27;ah group emerged in the aftermath of the Shiite revolt in Kufa by al-Mukhtar. Muslims, for the first time, had to confront intense political and theological disagreements and try to make sense of the fate of other Muslims who stood on other sides in political and sectarian conflict. The solution of the group that emerged as the Murji&#x27;ah was that only God ultimately knows who is correct, and so to God should judgement be deferred. Muslims themselves should not support or dissociate from other Muslim opponents in such conflicts. Early scholars of the Murji&#x27;ah themselves had a positive view of the first two caliphs (Abu Bakr and Umar), but suspended judgement on the third and fourth caliphs (Uthman and Ali). Regarding the latter, since the past was no longer available for evaluation, there was little other option but to suspend judgement (over committing to a negative view of them). At first, the Murji&#x27;ah worked on restoring peace among Muslim factions. Later, their attention shifted to combating the injustices being done to non-Arab converts to Islam. However, the Murji&#x27;ah (like the Sunnis in that era) still came to the belief that a legitimate ruler of the Islamic realm not only had to be Arab, but particularly, a descendant of the Quraysh tribe (from whom Muhammad originated).

The Murji&#x27;ah emerged as a theological school that was opposed to the Kharijites on questions related to early controversies regarding sin and definitions of what is a true Muslim. The Khawarij believed that committing a sin amounted to leaving Islam and the Murji&#x27;ah reacted with the opposite extreme, that deeds not only do not result in leaving Islam, but do not affect one&#x27;s faith at all. An intermediate position was taken between the Murji&#x27;ah and the Kharijites by the Mu&#x27;tazilites, holding that an individual that commits a cardinal sin is not a believer, but is also not a disbeliever. Instead, they belong to an in-between position, which the Mu&#x27;tazilites referred to as the &quot;intermediate position&quot; (&quot;manzilah bayn al-manzilatayn&quot;). The first position attributed to have held this latter position was Wasil ibn Ata (a student of Hasan al-Basri) after being asked a question about the contrast between the Murji&#x27;ah and Kharijite positions.

According to the &quot;Ta&#x27;rikh&quot; of Al-Tabari, the Murji&#x27;ite position came to be associated with &quot;shirk&quot;, the penultimate Islamic sin of associating something with God. In 117/735, Nasr ibn Sayyar, soon to become the governor of Khorasan, accused the rebel leader Al-Harith ibn Surayj of &quot;shirk&quot; on the basis of his support for the doctrine of &quot;irjāʾ&quot;.

At some point, the Murji&#x27;ah sect ceased to exist. They stop appearing in biographical dictionaries after the mid-9th century onwards. According to Christopher Melchert, they may have been absorbed into the Mu&#x27;tazilite sect, as a number of entries on Mu&#x27;tazilite figures in 9th-century dictionaries comment that they were inclined towards &#x27;postponement&#x27; (&quot;irjāʾ&quot;) and traditionalists in later periods would associate the two schools with each other (such as Abu Muhammad ibn abi Hamzah).

== Beliefs ==

=== Postponing judgement ===
As opposed to the Kharijites, Murjites advocated the idea of deferring judgment of other peoples&#x27; belief. The word Murjiah itself means &quot;one who postpones&quot; in Arabic. Murjite doctrine held that only God has the authority to judge who is a true Muslim and who is not, and that Muslims should consider all other Muslims as part of the community. This theology promoted tolerance of Umayyads and converts to Islam who appeared halfhearted in their obedience.

=== Faith versus deeds ===

Murjites considered genuine belief in and submission to God to be more important than acts of piety and good works. They believed Muslims committing major sins would remain Muslim and be eligible for paradise if they remained faithful. Therefore, they adopted moderate stances on issues such as &quot;fard&quot; and &quot;fasiq&quot;. Ibn Hazm described the Murji&#x27;ah position in the following terms:A grave sinner (murtakib al-kabīrah) is a Believer with his belief intact. It is all the same if he has never done a single act of good and has never regrained from doing evil acts.Conversely, those engaging in shirk cannot benefit salvation from performing good acts. Thus, faith is paramount. 

The Murjite opinion on the issue of whether one committing a major sin remains a believer was adopted with modifications by the later theological schools – Maturidi, Ash&#x27;ari and Muʿtazila.

== Relationship to Abu Hanifa ==
Abu Hanifa (d. 767), the founder of the Hanafi school of Sunni jurisprudence, was often associated with the Murji&#x27;ah although he himself was not one. In his &quot;al-Fiqh al-Akbar&quot;, he lay down the oldest surviving work regarding early Muslim creed, advocating respect for all the companions of Muhammad, withholding judgment regarding Uthman and Ali and predeterminism. His works were fundamental to later Sunni theology, Hanbalism being an exception. For the Murji&#x27;ah, Abu Hanifa is a central figure, especially for his advocation of the use of the application of reason in legal decision-making. Therefore, Murji&#x27;ites adopted Hanafi jurisprudence. A number of Abu Hanifa&#x27;s followers have been associated with or called a Murji&#x27;, including Nūḥ ibn Abī Maryam (d. 173/789–790) and Muhammad al-Shaybani.

== Influence ==
The subsequent Maturidi school of Islamic theology is believed by some to have emerged out of the Murji&#x27;ah.

<text>The Chelsea Headhunters are a notorious English football hooligan firm linked to the London football club Chelsea.

==History==
The Chelsea Headhunters formed in the late 1960s, and grew in importance during the 1970s and 1980s when football hooliganism in the United Kingdom was at its height. The group became notorious for its association with racism and white supremacy. Racist abuse was even levelled at Black Chelsea players such as Paul Canoville by fans of the club. Because of this, the gang initially drew followers with far-right views, including those who had no previous interest in Chelsea F.C..

The gang has links to various white supremacist organisations, such as Combat 18, the National Front, the Ku Klux Klan, and the British Movement. The gang also became affiliated with Northern Irish loyalist paramilitary organisations, such as the Ulster Defence Association and Ulster Volunteer Force. As of 2017, they claimed to have an alliance with the far-right Football Lads Alliance.

The firm was involved in numerous incidents of violence through the United Kingdom and Europe during the 1980s. Its activities inspired numerous prominent Russian hooligan firms, and some high-profile members of the Headhunters took part in football hooliganism in Russia.

Kevin Whitton, a high-profile member of the firm, was sentenced to life imprisonment on 8 November 1985 for violent assault after being found guilty of involvement in an attack on a pub on King&#x27;s Road. After Chelsea lost a match, Whitton and other hooligans stormed into the pub, chanting &quot;War! War! War!&quot;. When they left a few minutes later, with one of them shouting, &quot;You bloody Americans! Coming here taking our jobs&quot;, the bar&#x27;s American manager, 29-year-old Neil Hansen, was lying on the floor, close to death. Whitton&#x27;s sentence was cut to three years on appeal on 19 May 1986. The fan responsible for the actual assault, Wandsworth man Terence Matthews (aged 25 at the time), was arrested shortly after Whitton&#x27;s conviction and remanded in custody to await trial. He was found guilty of taking part in the violence on 13 October 1986 and sentenced to four years in prison. Matthews came to the public attention again in June 2002 when he and his 21-year-old son William received two-year prison sentences after they and another man were convicted of assaulting two police officers in Morden, Surrey.

On 13 February 2010, members of the firm clashed with the Cardiff City Soul Crew at the FA Cup fifth-round tie at Stamford Bridge. On 25 March 2011, at Isleworth Crown Court, 24 people were convicted of taking part in the violence, which resulted in several people being injured (including a police officer whose jaw was broken). All of those convicted received banning orders from all football grounds in England and Wales ranging from three years to eight years. Eighteen of them received prison sentences of up to two years.

Headhunters were involved in disturbances in Paris before a UEFA Champions League quarter final between Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea on 2 April 2014. Around 300 hooligans were involved in pre-planned violence around the city, with hardcore hooligans having avoided police detection by entering France via Belgium. Around 50 members of the firm took part in an Islamophobic protest outside of the East London Mosque in 2017. In 2020, three hooligans with ties to the Headhunters were convicted of bodily harm and affray following an attack on journalist Owen Jones, who is gay.

== Allies ==
In 2000, Chelsea Headhunters formed a temporary alliance with other British hooligans supporting Rangers F.C., Cardiff City, Swansea City and Leeds United led by Arsenal&#x27;s firm, The Herd, to attack Galatasaray fans in Copenhagen and Turkish fans in Brussels during Euro 2000 as part of revenge for the 2000 UEFA Cup semi-final stabbing of two Leeds United fans by a Galatasaray fan. Another
ally is the one with Hellas Verona fans since 1976 when Brigate Gialloblu’s banner was exposed in the famous Shed.

== In news and media ==
They were infiltrated by investigative reporter Donal MacIntyre for &quot;MacIntyre Undercover&quot;, a documentary series screened on the BBC. It was released on 9 November 1999, in which MacIntyre posed as a wannabe-member of the Chelsea Headhunters. He had a Chelsea tattoo applied to himself for authenticity, although the hardcore members especially Paul &#x27;Gary Glitter&#x27; Marriner, were surprised he chose the hated &quot;Millwall lion&quot; badge rather than the 1960s Chelsea erect lion. He confirmed the racism in the Headhunters organization and their links to Combat 18, including one top-ranking member who had been imprisoned on one occasion for possession of material related to the Ku Klux Klan. The documentary led to the arrest and conviction of several members of the group for the involvement in football violence. MacIntyre received death threats from the group following these events, and in 2009 two Chelsea fans attacked MacIntyre and his wife in revenge for the documentary and investigation.

==History==

A youth section of the SDLP was first floated in late 1973 which led to the short lived group &quot;the Young Social Democrats&quot; which organised from 1974 to 1976.

The current youth wing started organising in the early 1990s bringing motions, such as the decriminalisation of marijuana, to party conferences but it wasn’t until 10 June 1995 that SDLP Youth became a distinct section of the SDLP when it was added to the party constitution.

==International==

SDLP Youth are full members of the Young European Socialists (YES), formerly the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (ECOSY), having been admitted at the 1994 conference in Munich. At this 1994 conference future SDLP MLA for South Belfast Conall McDevitt was elected as an ECOSY vice-president after being elected the National Secretary of Labour Youth in 1993. At 2021 YES Congress Leah Rea became the first member of SDLP Youth to be nominated and elected to the YES Presidium as Vice-President.

In 2016 SDLP Youth and YES held a joint seminar in Belfast on &quot;far-right extremism and Brexit&quot; which was attended by young socialist activists from across Europe.

SDLP Youth are also observer members of International Union of Socialist Youth (IUSY).

<doc id="1323285" wikidata="Q2915574" url="?curid=1323285" title="Disney's Typhoon Lagoon">
<text>Disney&#x27;s Typhoon Lagoon is a water theme park located at the Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Florida near Orlando, and is one of two operating water parks at the resort. It is the second water park to open at the resort, preceded by Disney&#x27;s River Country which closed in November 2001.

The park, which opened on June 1, 1989, is home to one of the world&#x27;s largest outdoor wave pools where it is even possible to bodysurf. The theme of the park is the &quot;Disney legend&quot; of a typhoon that wreaked havoc upon a formerly pristine tropical paradise. Ships, fishing gear, and surfboards are strewn about where the storm flung them. Its centerpiece is &quot;Miss Tilly&quot;, a shrimp boat impaled upon a mountain named &quot;Mount Mayday&quot; that erupts a geyser of water every half hour, right before the bells of the watch sound on it. Its mascot is &quot;Lagoona Gator&quot;.

Typhoon reclaimed the title of most popular water park in the world in 2022, admitting 1.92 million guests, by beating Chimelong&#x27;s (China) 1.62M, Volcano Bay&#x27;s (Florida) 1.85M, Thermas Dos Laranjas&#x27; (Brazil) 1.7M, and Therme Erding&#x27;s (Germany) 1.7M. Before COVID-19, Chimelong and Typhoon had taken the top 2 spots for years, annually averaging 2.66M and 2.25M, respectively. It operates year-round, with an annual maintenance closure during either the fall or winter. During the closure, its sister park, Blizzard Beach, will remain open. Since COVID-19, Disney has only operated one water park at a time, Typhoon accounting for &lt;30 days (2020), 0 days (2021), 314 days (2022), and 231 days (2023), not counting weather-related closures.

Of the major parks at Disney World, it is the only one that lies within the city limits of Lake Buena Vista. Blizzard Beach and the four theme parks are within the adjacent city of Bay Lake. However, Lake Buena Vista is the mailing address for the entire Walt Disney World Resort.

The water park, along with all the other Walt Disney World parks, closed in March 2020 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The park remained closed whilst the four theme parks reopened July 11–15, 2020. Disney&#x27;s Typhoon Lagoon reopened at the Walt Disney World Resort on January 2, 2022, after being closed almost two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was the last portion of the resort to reopen after COVID-19 related interruptions.

==Mount Mayday==
Mount Mayday, located behind the surf pool, features &quot;Miss Tilly&quot; as well as many of the waterfalls and slides. It is a man-made mountain which not only provides launching areas for the water slides but also conceals the pipework.

The main engineering works performed in 1988 and 1989 featured studies, design, and tests on water wave generation and propagation. As the Typhoon Lagoon was one of the first wave-makers applied to a theme park, one of its prime objectives was to produce surfable waves. Waves are generated by a 12-cell prestressed concrete tank in the background of the lagoon covered with the shipwreck scene. Computer modeling techniques were used at the time to study fluid-structure interaction, stress concentrations, and fatigue to ensure integrity and safety. Prior to its opening, the Typhoon Lagoon was tested to determine wave shape, surf-board ride duration, and the extent to which the waves give a natural feeling as they propagate and break on the artificial beach downstream.

===Attractions===

==Former Shark Reef==
Considered one of the most unique attractions at any Disney park, Typhoon Lagoon&#x27;s Shark Reef provided guests a 5–15 minute snorkel across a manmade lagoon brimming with rays, small sharks, and tropical fish. The artificial reef consisted of a 362,000-gallon dual tank habitat separated by an overturned &quot;sunken tanker&quot;—a disguised underwater viewing tunnel. Without official statements from Disney Parks, analysts point to its uniquely high operating costs (animals and their care takers, water temperature regulation, water filtration, life guards, et al.) as reason for its permanent closure on October 3, 2016.
Since closure, the sunken tanker has been walled off and the tank closest to the pathways has been filled in, covered with sand, and converted into a seating/lounge area. The entrance building to the attraction has been converted into a quick service bar and eatery.

<doc id="1323291" wikidata="Q5269284" url="?curid=1323291" title="Dharmapada (person)">
<text>In Odia folklore, Dharmapada was the son of a great architect named Bishu Maharana, who completed the construction of the Sun Temple at Konark, Odisha on the eastern coastline of India, in a single night to save 1,200 craftsmen from execution from the then King Langula Narasingha Deva I. Legends say he sacrificed his own life by jumping into the ocean after carrying out the final step to complete the temple top to prevent the story from spreading. The Konark temple is still standing tall since 13th-century telling Bisu Maharana and his Son Dharmapada&#x27;s stories.

==Legend==
According to history, the king Langula Narasingha Deva I of the Eastern Ganga Dynasty decided to build a massive temple at Konark. The temple was to be in the shape of the Sun god, Surya riding in his chariot. 1,200 craftsmen were recruited to construct the temple, led by one named Bishu Maharana and the project was to take twelve years.

As the end of the twelve years approached, Dharmapada, the son of Bishu Maharana, now 12 years of age, went to visit his father. Upon arrival, he found his father distressed; the crown on the Sun temple&#x27;s top had yet to be completed and the king had threatened to execute all 1,200 craftsmen if they did not finish it by morning. Although the task seemed impossible, Dharmapada decided to single-handedly complete it.

A debate then took place among the craftsmen. Fearing for their own lives if it became known that a child had completed the work instead of them, they demanded that Dharmapada be killed, a suggestion his father strenuously resisted. At last, to settle this debate, Dharmapada jumped from the crown he had completed, killing himself and ensuring the safety of the craftsmen.

==Historical relevance of the character==
There are few references available to support the existence of such a person named Dharmapada. There is not much mention of this name in any of the ancient Odia texts. However, the legend of Dharmapada is widely popular across the state of Odisha. Extensive writing referring to the legend in the poem Dharmapada penned by Utkalamani Gopabandhu Das has probably given the character much-needed identity in modern Odia literature.

==Temple==
The temple that Dharmapada is said to have completed still stands in Konark today, although in a somewhat dilapidated state. Constructed in the 13th century, it has been pillaged several times since then and has suffered severe damage. It is listed today as a World Heritage Site.

<doc id="1323294" wikidata="Q913949" url="?curid=1323294" title="Sukharev Tower">
<text>The Sukharev Tower (Сухарева башня) was a Moscow landmark until its destruction by Soviet authorities in 1934. Tsar Peter I of Russia had the tower built in the Moscow baroque style at the intersection of the Garden Ring with Sretenka Street in 1692–1695.

== History ==
Peter ordered the construction of the tower to commemorate his triumph over his half-sister Sofia in 1689, after the Streltsy uprising had been crushed. The tower received its name in honor of Lavrentii Pankrat&#x27;evich Sukharev, whose regiment of streltsy had supported Peter.

=== Tower construction ===
The brick tower was built from 1692 through 1701 under the direction of the architect . It was not a fortress but rather a ceremonial gateway into the city.

The first floor formed an arched entrance to the city. The second floor contained guardrooms. Originally these served as barracks for Sukharev&#x27;s regiment of streltsy, but the streltsy were disbanded at the end of the 17th century. The third floor housed the Moscow School of Mathematics and Navigation. The school was part of Peter&#x27;s grand plan to introduce western education to Russia. Choglokov did some remodeling in 1701. Count Yakov Bruce made the upper story his astronomical observatory, the first in Russia. The fourth floor had a clock and a state coat-of-arms. &quot;An attractive typically Muscovite, wide exterior staircase led to a gallery on the first floor and surrounding the building.&quot; 
=== Tower, an integral part of city infrastructure ===
Catherine the Great (reigned 1762-1796) allowed Moscow merchants to use the tower premises for storehouses and shops.

Catherine ordered the construction of a water-supply system from the village of Mytishchi to Moscow. The Mytishchi Water Conduit, built between 1779 and 1804, ended near the Sukharev tower to dispense water. Between 1826 and 1835 engineer major-general Nikolai Ivanovich Yanish () repaired and expanded the Mytishchi Water Supply. At this time two steam-engine powered pumps and a cast-iron tank holding 5000 (buckets) gallons of water were built on the second floor of the tower to improve the water pressure. Pipes from the tower led to fountains. One of these fountains, called Sheremetev, was located in the Sukharev square near the tower.

A large market, the Sukharevka, bustled around the tower in the 19th century. In 1921 the Soviet government turned the tower into the Moscow Municipal Museum, which later became the Moscow City Museum. The Soviet government closed down the famous flea market in 1925. It is said that Lenin felt that the market was a &quot;breeding ground for speculation&quot;.

=== Tower destruction ===
&quot;The bride of the Ivan Velikiy&quot; (as Muscovites used to call the tower) was demolished in 1934 by order of Lazar Kaganovich, Secretary of the Moscow City Committee. It took place during reconstruction of the city ordered by Joseph Stalin, that gave birth to Stalinist architecture. It was said that the tower blocked traffic.

=== Proposed tower replica ===
Over the years Moscow authorities several times considered building a replica of the tower, but no decision has been made.

<text>Tell Me When to Whoa is an EP by Bowling for Soup released in June 1998, and later re-released in 1999, on the local Denton music label FFROE. The album is currently out of print. The band released digitally remastered versions of &quot;Bowling for Soup&quot;, &quot;Cell Mates&quot;, and &quot;Tell Me When to Whoa&quot; through iTunes and Amazon in October 2011. It is the last studio recording by the band to feature Lance Morrill on drums.

==Production and recording==
In a band newsletter on August 24, 1998, it was announced that the band would work again with Jeff Roe recording in Denton, Texas, and record at Reel Time Audio and release a new album titled &quot;Tell Me When To Whoa&quot; through FFROE Records.

This would be the last album to feature drummer Lance Morrill, who in January 1998, got married and by mid 1999, decided to move on with life and would soon quit the band. In July 1999, Morrill&#x27;s replacement was announced to be Gary Wiseman.

The EP was reissued in July 1999 and included one new song on the CD, &quot;The Bitch Song&quot;, which was receiving radio play around the country. It was again reissued in 2011 for a digital release.

<doc id="1323316" wikidata="Q4724136" url="?curid=1323316" title="Algernon Borthwick, 1st Baron Glenesk">
<text>Algernon Borthwick, 1st Baron Glenesk JP (27 December 1830 – 24 November 1908), known as Sir Algernon Borthwick, Bt, between 1887 and 1895, was a British journalist and Conservative politician. He was the owner of the &quot;Morning Post&quot; (which merged with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 1937).

==Background and education==
Borthwick was the son of Peter Borthwick, editor of the &quot;Morning Post&quot;, and Margaret, daughter of John Colville, of Ewart, Northumberland. He was sent to King&#x27;s College School.

==Career==
Borthwick started his career in journalism in 1850 as the &quot;Morning Post&#x27;s&quot; Paris correspondent. After his father&#x27;s death in 1852, he became managing editor and within seven years had paid off the newspaper&#x27;s financial debt to paper manufacturers Thomas Bonsor Crompton. Borthwick gave the paper &quot;a strong political colour, Conservative, Imperialist and Protectionist ... [and the paper became] the principal organ of the fashionable world&quot;. In 1877, Borthwick succeeded in becoming the newspaper&#x27;s sole proprietor and took a series of risky but ultimately highly successful financial decisions including reducing the newspaper&#x27;s price from threepence to a penny which resulted in a ten-fold increase in circulation.

Borthwick was known as a conservative voice in the politics of the time and in the 1880s he switched his attention to the world of politics. In the 1880 general election, Borthwick stood unsuccessfully for Evesham as a Conservative candidate. However, the election was declared void on account of bribery of electors, causing a by-election. In April 1880, Borthwick was given a knighthood by Disraeli in Disraeli&#x27;s resignation honours. In the mid-1880s, Borthwick played a role in popularizing the Primrose League, an organisation dedicated to spreading Conservative principles in the UK. In 1885, Borthwick was elected a Member of Parliament for Kensington South and became an ally of Lord Randolph Churchill. In 1887, he was created a Baronet, of Piccadilly in the Parish of St George, Hanover Square, in the County of Middlesex. On his retirement from the House of Commons in 1895, Borthwick was raised to the peerage as Baron Glenesk, of Glenesk in the County of Midlothian.

Borthwick&#x27;s political career increased the influence on &quot;the Morning Post&quot; and the newspaper soon became &quot;one of the great organs of opinion on the Conservative side.&quot; From 1880 onwards, Borthwick handed over editorship of the newspaper to a series of editors: William Hardman, A.K. Moore, William Algernon Locker, James Nicol Dunn, and Fabian Ware. Under these editors, the literary standard of the newspaper was retained and a series of improvement were made. Borthwick&#x27;s son, The Hon. Oliver Borthwick (1873–1905), held a managing role in &quot;the Morning Post&quot; until his own death, predeceasing his father, in 1905 aged just thirty two. When Algernon Borthwick himself died in 1908, proprietorship of &quot;the Morning Post&quot; passed his only surviving child, the Hon. Lilias Margaret Frances Borthwick (1871–1965), who in 1893 had married Seymour Bathurst, 7th Earl Bathurst.

==Marriage and children==

Lord Glenesk married Alice Beatrice Lister (d. 1898) on 5 April 1870. She was the daughter of the writers Thomas Henry Lister and his wife Lady Maria Theresa Villiers, daughter of George Villiers. They had two children:

*The Hon. Lilias Margaret Frances Borthwick (1871–1965), who married Seymour Bathurst, 7th Earl Bathurst, and had four children, three sons and a daughter. Lady Bathurst eventually inherited &quot;The Morning Post&quot;.
*The Hon. Oliver Borthwick (1873–1905), who predeceased his father, dying aged thirty two unmarried and without children.

Lord Glenesk died in November 1908, aged 77, when the title became extinct. Glenesk was interred in the Glenesk Mausoleum in East Finchley Cemetery. The mausoleum had been designed and built for Glenesk by Arthur Blomfield in 1899, and also held the remains of his wife, and his son, Oliver. The mausoleum was later listed Grade II on the National Heritage List for England.

<text>Brut y Tywysogion () is one of the most important primary sources for Welsh history. It is an annalistic chronicle that serves as a continuation of Geoffrey of Monmouth’s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;. &quot;Brut y Tywysogion&quot; has survived as several Welsh translations of an original Latin version, which has not itself survived. The most important versions are the one in Robert Vaughan&#x27;s Peniarth MS. 20 and the slightly less complete one in the Red Book of Hergest. The version entitled &quot;Brenhinoedd y Saeson&quot; (&quot;Kings of the English&quot;) combines material from the Welsh annals with material from an English source.

The Peniarth MS. 20 version begins in 682 with a record of the death of Cadwaladr and ends in 1332. The entries for the earlier years are brief, usually records of deaths and events such as eclipses, plagues or earthquakes, but later entries are much more detailed. The main focus is on the rulers of the kingdoms of Gwynedd, Powys and Deheubarth, but ecclesiastical events are also mentioned, such as the bringing of the date of celebrating Easter in the Welsh church into line with Rome by &quot;Elbodius&quot; (Elfodd), Bishop of Bangor, in 768. Events in England, Ireland, Scotland, Brittany and sometimes France are also briefly chronicled.

The original monastic annals are thought to have been written at Strata Florida Abbey, but may have been kept at the old abbey at Llanbadarn Fawr in the 11th century. Annals from other abbeys were also used in the composition. At least one of the Welsh translations is also thought to have been written at Strata Florida.

<text>Action was a British weekly boys&#x27; comic published by IPC Magazines from 14 February 1976 to 5 November 1977, when it merged with war comic &quot;Battle&quot; after 86 issues. The comic was created by Pat Mills and Geoff Kemp.

While initially a sales success, the comic quickly received media criticism for its violent content, causing a moral panic that ultimately saw it withdrawn from sale by IPC in October 1976, amid rumours it was to be banned. &quot;Action&quot; returned two months later in a much-sanitised form, quickly losing readers and being cancelled the following year. Despite its short lifespan, &quot;Action&quot; was highly influential on the British comics scene, and was a direct forerunner of the long-running &quot;2000 AD&quot;.

==Creation==

After a successful stint working on various IPC girls&#x27; comics, Pat Mills had interviewed for the vacant position of managing editor at the company. Mills felt the company&#x27;s output had grown stale and outdated and told the board so, and wasn&#x27;t offered the job due to his forthright criticism. However, his fresh ideas had been noted by editorial director John Sanders, who likewise felt the company&#x27;s comics needed an overhaul but found it politically difficult to do so due to the long-serving, well-connected nature of much of the company&#x27;s staff. He was impressed enough to remember Mills when charged with creating an answer to DC Thomson&#x27;s &quot;Warlord&quot; comic, assigning Mills and his fellow freelancer John Wagner to create &quot;Battle Picture Weekly&quot; in 1974. Despite internal friction from the bypassed staff the comic was a major triumph, and Sanders quickly moved to use them elsewhere in IPC&#x27;s boys adventure division. 
Wagner was given editorship of &quot;Valiant&quot;, which had been the company&#x27;s leading title of the sixties but was now increasingly outdated, while Mills was tasked with creating a new weekly. Having learnt about Mills&#x27; perfectionism in the launch of &quot;Battle&quot; – which required the guidance of veteran Dave Hunt to make its launch date – Mills was given a choice of staff editors to work with, picking the experienced Geoff Kemp. Kemp had a long history with the company, including a sizeable stint as assistant editor of &quot;Lion&quot; (which he had helped update in the mid-1960s, being the driving force behind the introduction of the likes of anti-hero The Spider) but was identified by Sanders and Mills as one of the staff most open to new ideas. The pair were given three months to put the comic together from scratch; while Mills felt this was a &quot;ridiculously short time&quot;, the more seasoned Kemp would later note it was the longest run-in he had ever known. The pair quickly settled on a formula of taking extant story ideas, approaching them from a different angle and injecting a large amount of contemporary realism. Mills envisioned making a title that appealed to children that didn&#x27;t read comics rather than simply trying to draw an audience from other titles, and as such aimed to make the title streetwise and more in touch.

Following this template, the pair looked at the blockbuster film &quot;Jaws&quot; and switched the perspective by following the shark, while making many of the human characters unsympathetic, to create &quot;Hook Jaw&quot;. &quot;Hellman of Hammer Force&quot; took the old staple of World War II but followed an Axis protagonist in the form of fiercely principled tank commander Major Kurt Hellman. According to Mills, Sanders was initially reluctant about running the story, but was worn down by repeated requests. &quot;Dredger&quot; applied the hard-edged ethos of Clint Eastwood&#x27;s Dirty Harry to the spy genre. &quot;Blackjack&quot; was a boxing story, but unlike those featured previously in the likes of &quot;Tiger&quot; and &quot;Valiant&quot; not only took a closer look at corruption in the sport but also featured a black protagonist, infused with the brashness of Muhammad Ali; Mills would later recall some of IPC&#x27;s staff felt Barron being black would make the strip unpopular, and urging him to change the character to a white man with a black sidekick. A similarly unsentimental view of athletics and youth was evident in &quot;Sport&#x27;s Not For Losers!&quot;, about a working class lout who smoked but had an unexpected talent for long-distance running. For &quot;The Running Man&quot;, Mafiosi and a face-swap were added to the format of &quot;The Fugitive&quot;. The obligatory football strip, &quot;Play Till You Drop!&quot;, featured a player controlled by a blackmailing journalist, while &quot;The Coffin Sub&quot; featured a captain wracked with survivor&#x27;s guilt wondering if he was leading his new crew to their deaths. Rejected were an ecologically tinged fishing story (dropped when a dummy episode proved too bleak) and a story about a photographer with a knack of getting in the thick of unpleasant situations, as well as World War I aviation strip &quot;The Suicide Club&quot; by Kelvin Gosnell (which was eventually used as a one-off in the 1976 &quot;Action Special&quot;).

They also looked at the editorial content, feeling that this also dated their competitors by generally being too paternal and condescending. Steve MacManus, who was writing &quot;The Running Man&quot; and &quot;Sport&#x27;s Not For Losers!&quot;, found himself corralled into the role of &#x27;ActionMan&#x27;, whereby readers would set the unfortunate writer bizarre stunts; MacManus would be photographed doing the winning entry and the reader who submitted it would be awarded with £10. MacManus also handled running the letters column, taking on the persona of a put-upon dogsbody forever trying to avoid tyrannical editor Peg-Leg and have a cup of tea in peace. Readers were encouraged to submit bizarre and stupid questions to resident &#x27;Knowall&#x27; Milton Finesilver and, most anarchically, to nominate a public figure as &#x27;Twit of the Week&#x27;. Each &#x27;Twit&#x27; would have their portrait printed together with a pithy dismissal of whatever they had done to invoke the readership&#x27;s ire. Bamber Gascoigne, Nicholas Parsons, Russell Harty, The Bay City Rollers, Malcolm Allison and Tony Blackburn were among those honoured. The idea was to let the readers know they considered them as equals – in the words of MacManus, to let readers know &quot;We know what you&#x27;re thinking&quot;. As with &quot;Battle&quot;, the plan was for Mills and Kemp to bed in the new title and then hand it over to an experienced editor for week-to-week running.

Mills purposefully modelled the page layouts on infamous British tabloid newspaper &quot;The Sun&quot;, later explaining: -
Doug Church worked as art director on the comic, as he had done on &quot;Battle&quot;. The plan was originally to name the new comic &#x27;Boots&#x27; or &#x27;Dr. Martens&#x27; (in honour of the tough kid&#x27;s footwear of choice) but instead Mills chose &#x27;Action&#x27;. He initially wanted to call it &quot;Action 76&quot; and change the number incrementally to emphasise the comic&#x27;s up to date nature, but this went down poorly with newsagents and the idea was dropped.

==Publishing history==

Backed by a television advertising campaign the first issue sold 250,000 copies – a sizeable figure at the time. As was standard for the industry figures soon dropped to a respectable range of 160,000 to 170,000. However, instead of dropping further they stabilised and then actually started to increase as word-of-mouth spread, and IPC&#x27;s post room was swamped by reader&#x27;s letters. Having learnt of &quot;Action&quot;, IPC&#x27;s rival DC Thomson brought out &quot;Bullet&quot; in response; however, produced by the same hands as &quot;Victor&quot;, &quot;Hornet&quot; and &quot;Hotspur&quot; it failed to make much of an impression. In the early days of the comic, Mills was very hands-on, rewriting many of the scripts himself.

===Controversy===
Almost immediately &quot;Action&quot;&#x27;s violence began to attract attention from the press. On 23 February 1976, &quot;The London Evening Standard&quot; ran an article on the comic, criticising its bloodletting. More sustained criticism came from &quot;The Sun&quot;, which dissected &quot;Action&quot; on 30 April 1976. As author Martin Baker has noted, the article itself was relatively balanced but the headline – &quot;The Sevenpenny Nightmare&quot;, in reference to the notorious Victorian penny dreadfuls – set the tone for a campaign against the title&#x27;s immorality. However, the excellent sales led to the creative staff being egged on in some cases.

Meanwhile, the comic continued, and the first round of changes to the contents were instigated. &quot;The Coffin Sub&quot; and &quot;Play Till You Drop&quot; proved unpopular with readers and were ejected in favour of World War II commando story &quot;Green&#x27;s Grudge War&quot; and a new football strip, &quot;Look Out for Lefty!&quot;. The latter revolved around the supremely gifted but short-tempered Kenny &#x27;Lefty&#x27; Lampton, a borderline thug whose off-the-pitch life rang more true than the kidnappings and assassination plots faced by Roy of the Rovers. May saw the Northern poverty of &quot;Sport&#x27;s Not For Losers!&quot; swapped out for &quot;Death Game 1999&quot;, a highly violent lift of successful sci-fi film &quot;Rollerball&quot;, and in June trucking drama &quot;Hell&#x27;s Highway&quot; replaced &quot;The Running Man&quot;. John Smith meanwhile took over the editorship from Kemp; his previous experience had largely been with nursery titles. The creative teams on the various strips meanwhile revelled in treading new ground and pushing boundaries.

Meanwhile, the press attention on the title refused to go away. Self-appointed public guardian Mary Whitehouse and her NVLA – influential with the powerful tabloid press and Parliament – took a sojourn from trying to remove violence from television to begin campaigning against Action. Another moralistic pressure group, Delegates Opposing Violent Education, threatened to have its members deface &quot;Action&quot; in newsagents by adding stickers denouncing the publication as being in violation of the Children and Young Persons (Harmful Publications) Act 1955. Denis Gifford, a former cartoonist turned comics historian whose books had made him the doyen of British comics, gave colour quotes negatively comparing &quot;Action&quot; to his beloved nonviolent pre-war comics such as &quot;Happy Days&quot;. Much of the reportage drew comparisons between &quot;Action&quot; and the lurid pre-code American horror titles of the 1950s, which had been banned in Britain by the act of Parliament.

Sanders became the public face of &quot;Action&quot;&#x27;s defence, stoutly maintaining it was still less violent than numerous popular films and television shows. However, behind the scenes he attempted to moderate the comic. Despite his efforts, in September 1976 criticism reached a new level. Two strips brought particular attention. New addition &quot;Kids Rule O.K.&quot; featured a version of present-day Britain where a disease suddenly killed off the world&#x27;s adult population, leaving the country filled with tough gangs of teenagers fighting to survive, while &quot;Look Out for Lefty!&quot; covered the player&#x27;s breakthrough into the first team. In the latter Lefty&#x27;s iconoclasm had created an enemy among his team-mates who went out of his way to disrupt the title character&#x27;s game. Seeing this from the terraces, Lefty&#x27;s spiky girlfriend Angie threw a bottle at the attacker, knocking him out and allowing Lefty&#x27;s talent to shine through. At the time football hooliganism was on a sharp rise and the press accused the comic of endorsing such behaviour, with noted referee Jack Taylor among those to supply condemning statements to the tabloids. The same 18 September edition had also launched &quot;Kids Rule O.K.&quot; with a front cover – rendered by Carlos Ezquerra – featuring a bike chain wielding youth against a background of urban devastation, standing over what appeared to be the body of a policeman. While in typical comic style the cover image was only tangentially related to the strip itself, the image was seized on by the press as an example of the comic&#x27;s attempts to corrupt the nation&#x27;s youth. The artist would later claim this was caused by the colourist, and the helmet and the prone figure were not meant to be related. The controversy was such that a bemused Stan Lee, visiting to do the promotional rounds for Marvel UK&#x27;s launch of &quot;Captain Britain&quot;, found himself being questioned about it.

===Withdrawal===

With the attention not going away, the BBC arranged for Sanders to be interviewed live on their popular prime time magazine show &quot;Nationwide&quot;. At the time the programme&#x27;s main studio anchor was Frank Bough, who was – before his private life was revealed by the press to involve wearing lingerie for cocaine-fuelled orgies with prostitutes – one of the most trusted faces on television. Sanders was given a list of questions he would be asked, which Bough promptly ignored in favour of excoriating his guest for warping children. A blindsided Sanders attempted to rally, but after the broadcast the IPC board intervened and after the 16 October 1976 issue &quot;Action&quot; was pulled from circulation. Sanders reportedly only found out about the withdrawal by reading about it in newspapers when on holiday in Spain.

The decision to withdraw had actually been made some seven weeks before, that being the lead-in for the printing cycle; IPC resisted calls to pull production on comics they had already paid for. However, the 23 October edition only got as far as a small run of 30 copies (an internal policy allowing a comic to be given final checks before a full print run was made). The precise reason for this step, unprecedented for a publisher that valued sales above all else, has been a matter for debate; Baker has speculated several factors combined to lead to the title being withdrawn. It is often stated that newsagents threatened to either refuse to stock &quot;Action&quot; or all IPC comics. However of the two largest distributors in the UK at the time John Menzies only sent a note expressing concern about the criticism of &quot;Action&quot;, while Baker&#x27;s research was only able to conclusively verify that WHSmith only threatened either only honour orders for reserved copies or not provide promotional support for any relaunches, though he found there were many second-hand accounts of the threat from those inside IPC at the time.

Another suggested factor was internal politicking. Many of the IPC staff, particularly the boys&#x27; adventure division, had greatly resented being bypassed for &quot;Battle&quot; and then &quot;Action&quot;, but strong sales had prevented them from protesting. Many had been with the company for decades and had good relations with the board, particularly the influential Jack Le Grand, the driving force behind the creation of &quot;Valiant&quot;. Like the staff, the board was distinctly traditionalist and many held personal views closer to those of Whitehouse than of &quot;Action&quot;&#x27;s creators and readers. Further friction came from freelancers such as Mills being paid better than their equivalent staffers. Mills himself would later feel that after he stepped away &quot;Action&quot; &quot;went too far&quot;.

===Return, decline and cancellation===
Smith was removed, with much of the blame being put on his inexperience with adventure comics meaning he lost control of the creative teams. The traditionalist Sid Bicknell, a former &quot;Valiant&quot; editor, took over and Sanders was tasked by the board with approving every single page. Baker was able to view a copy of the 23 October issue during production of &quot;Action – A Violent Comic&quot;, and compare it to the heavily cannibalised version that would become the 4 December edition, and identified a large number of edits for both violence and political content. Other overt changes were the removal of &quot;Kids Rule OK&quot; and &quot;The Probationer&quot; entirely, replaced by motor racing story &quot;Roaring Wheels&quot; and &quot;Double Dynamite&quot; (a boxing story about a white man with a black sidekick), while &quot;Death Game 1999&quot; was renamed &quot;Spinball&quot;. &quot;Double Dynamite&quot; and fellow post-suspension introductions &quot;Jinx Jackson&quot; and &quot;The Loner&quot; were described by Andrew Screen as &quot;standard boy’s adventure strips that could feature in any other contemporary comic&quot;, and therefore proof that &quot;Action&quot;&#x27;s &quot;edge had gone&quot;.

The new, safer &quot;Action&quot; failed to sell as well as readers swiftly realised it was largely the same as previous boys&#x27; comics and in November 1977 it was merged into &quot;Battle&quot; after sales fell to an unprofitable 70,000. &quot;Hellman of Hammer Force&quot; (which had ironically avoided heavy censure and had actually featured more deaths after the suspension), &quot;Dredger&quot; and &quot;Spinball&quot; would continue, though the latter pair were reconfigured and only &quot;Hellman of Hammer Force&quot; would run for any considerable length of time. In the meantime, Mills and Wagner had been reunited by Sanders, and successfully launched the science fiction boys&#x27; weekly &quot;2000 AD&quot; in 1977.

==Legacy==
Mills has credited his overall experience with &quot;Action&quot; as being crucial to &quot;2000 AD&quot;, both in terms of taking on writing more of the contents himself instead of editing and in terms of learning what was and wasn&#x27;t going to get unwanted attention. As he noted some years later, &quot;We just kept saying it that they&#x27;re robots or androids that are getting their heads blown off!&quot;. Many of the &quot;Action&quot; contributors would play key roles in 2000 AD&#x27;s formative years.

A decade after the cancellation, &quot;Dredger&quot;, &quot;The Coffin Sub&quot; and &quot;Play Till You Drop!&quot; were among the contents of the short-lived 1987 reprint title &quot;All-Action Monthly&quot;. The following year portions of &quot;Dredger&quot; and &quot;Hook Jaw&quot; were included in the 224-page softback &quot;Big Adventure Book&quot; special, alongside reprints of the likes of &quot;The Steel Claw&quot; and &quot;One-Eyed Jack&quot;.

In 1990 Titan Books released &quot;Action – The Story of a Violent Comic&quot; written by Martin Barker. This was a history of the comic, as well as a study of the effects of the ban.
In this book Barker revealed that 30 copies of the pulped 23 October 1976 issue were saved and the book prints many of the strips from that issue, plus following issues thanks to Barker coming into possession of unpublished art. The book reveals just how much &quot;Action&quot; was being censored at an editorial level, and the route the title was heading in before it was cancelled. In 2007, Spitfire Comics released a collection of the pre-ban &quot;Hook Jaw&quot; strips in &quot;Collected Hook Jaw vol.1&quot;.

===Revivals===
Since 2016 the rights to &quot;Action&quot; and its contents have been owned by Rebellion Developments. In 2017, Rebellion leased the rights to &quot;Hook Jaw&quot; to Titan Comics, who produced a five-part mini-series written by Simon Spurrier and drawn by Conor Boyle, and also published a collected edition of the &quot;Action&quot; strips to tie in with the series.

In spring 2020 Rebellion published an &quot;Action Special 2020&quot; under its Treasury of British Comics imprint. The special included new strips for &quot;Kids Rule O.K.&quot; (by Ram V and Henrik Sarlström), &quot;Hellman of Hammer Force&quot; (by Garth Ennis and original artist Mike Dorey), &quot;Hook Jaw&quot; (by Quint Amity and Dan Lish) and &quot;Dredger&quot; (by Zina Hutton and Staz Johnson), as well as Henry Flint&#x27;s &quot;Hell Machine&quot;. The Special also included a cover-to-cover reprint of the previously unpublished 23 October 1976 edition of &quot;Action&quot;. Ennis won the 2021 Irish Comics News Award for Best Irish Writer for his story. but other elements of the special were not as well received. The company also published a collected edition of the &quot;Hellman of Hammer Force&quot; collected edition in 2021.

In June 2022 they followed up with a hardcover &quot;Battle Action Special&quot; with new stories featuring characters from both comics, all written by Ennis and with various artists, with new &quot;Dredger&quot; and &quot;Kids Rule O.K.&quot; stories. This had a more positive reception. Starting in May 2023, Rebellion published a five-issue series of &quot;Battle Action&quot;, with each issue featuring two complete stories, once again written by Ennis. In 2024, ten further issues were announced, beginning in that year.

<text>Hedwig &quot;Vicki&quot; Baum (; ; January 24, 1888 – August 29, 1960) was an Austrian writer. She is known for the novel &quot;Menschen im Hotel&quot; (&quot;People at a Hotel&quot;, 1929 — published in English as &quot;Grand Hotel&quot;), one of her first international successes. It was made into a 1932 film and a 1989 Broadway musical.

==Education and personal life==
Baum was born in Vienna into a Jewish family. Her mother Mathilde (née Donath) suffered from mental illness, and died of breast cancer when Vicki was still a child. Her father, described as &quot;a tyrannical, hypochondriac&quot; man, was a bank clerk who was killed in 1942 in Novi Sad (present-day Serbia) by soldiers of the Hungarian occupation. She began her artistic career as a musician playing the harp. She studied at the Vienna Conservatory and played in the Vienna Concert Society. She went on to perform in Germany – in Kiel, Hannover, and Mannheim – in the years 1916–1923. She later worked as a journalist for the magazine &quot;Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung&quot;, published by Ullstein-Verlag in Berlin.

Baum was married twice. Her first, short-lived marriage, in 1906, was to Max Prels, an Austrian journalist who introduced her to the Viennese cultural scene; some of her first short stories were published under his name. They divorced in 1910, and in 1916, she married Richard Lert, a conductor. They had two sons, Wolfgang (b. 1917) and Peter (b. 1921).

==Boxing==
Baum took up boxing in the late 1920s. She trained with Turkish prizefighter Sabri Mahir at his Studio for Boxing and Physical Culture in Berlin. Although the studio was open to men and women, Baum writes in her memoir, &quot;It Was All Quite Different&quot; (1964), that only a few women (including Marlene Dietrich and Carola Neher) trained there: “I don’t know how the feminine element sneaked into those masculine realms, but in any case, only three or four of us were tough enough to go through with it.” Positioning herself as a “New Woman,” she asserted her independence in the traditionally male domain of boxing and challenged old gender categories. She writes that “Sabri put one limitation on women – no sparring in the ring, no black eyes, no bloody noses. Punching the ball was okay, though, to develop a pretty mean straight left, a quick one-two; a woman never knew when she might have to defend herself, right?” While training with Mahir, Baum mastered a rope-jumping routine that was designed for German heavyweight champion Franz Diener. She later credited her strong work ethic to the skills instilled in Mahir&#x27;s studio.

==Writing career==
Baum began writing in her teens but did not turn to writing professionally until after the birth of her first son. Her first book, &quot;Frühe Schatten: Die Geschichte einer Kindheit&quot; (&quot;Early Shadows: The Story of a Childhood&quot;, 1919), was published when she was 31. Thereafter she published a new novel nearly every year, with a career total of more than 50 books, at least ten of which were adapted as motion pictures in Hollywood. Her ninth novel, &quot;Stud. chem. Helene Willfüer &quot;(&quot;Helene&quot;), was her first major commercial success, selling over 100,000 copies. Baum is considered one of the first modern bestselling authors, and her books are seen as exemplifying New Objectivity within contemporary mainstream literature. Her protagonists were often strong, independent women caught up in turbulent times.

Baum is most famous for her 1929 novel &quot;Menschen im Hotel&quot; (&quot;People at a Hotel&quot;), which introduced the genre of the &#x27;hotel novel&#x27;. It was made into a stage play in Berlin in 1929, directed by Max Reinhardt, and an Academy Award winning film, &quot;Grand Hotel&quot;, in 1932. Baum emigrated to the United States with her family after being invited to write the screenplay for this film. She settled in the Los Angeles area and worked as a screenwriter for ten years, with moderate success. With the rise of National Socialism in Germany, her literary works were denigrated as sensationalist and amoral and banned in the Third Reich as of 1935. She became an American citizen in 1938, and her post-World War II works were written in English rather than in German.

Baum visited Mexico, China, Egypt and Bali in 1935; and became close friends with the painter Walter Spies. With historical and cultural input from Spies, she wrote &quot;Liebe und Tod auf Bali&quot;, which was published in 1937 and translated into English as A Tale From Bali and then later republished under its original German title as &quot;Love and Death in Bali&quot;. The book was about a family that was caught in the massacre in Bali in 1906 at the fall of the last independent kingdom in Bali to the Dutch.

==Last years and death==
Baum&#x27;s reputation went into a decline following World War II. She died of leukemia in Hollywood, California in 1960, aged 72. Her memoir &quot;It Was All Quite Different&quot; was published posthumously in 1964.

==Honors==
In 1999, the corner of Wiedner Hauptstraße and Waaggasse in Vienna was named Vicki-Baum-Platz in her honor. In 2009, a street was named after her in Berlin.

<doc id="1323365" wikidata="Q2992759" url="?curid=1323365" title="Elvis Presley on film and television">
<text>Elvis Presley was an American entertainer and Laurel Award winning actor who achieved great initial success as a singer and stage performer. He publicly expressed an early career goal of following in the footsteps of his role models James Dean and Marlon Brando to become a top dramatic actor. His manager Colonel Tom Parker&#x27;s persistent lobbying of William Morris Agency president Abe Lastfogel for a Presley screen test paid off on March 26, 1956, when the singer auditioned at Paramount for a supporting role in &quot;The Rainmaker&quot;. Although not chosen for the part, he signed a contract with Paramount producer Hal Wallis on April 25 that also allowed him to make films with other studios.

His feature debut was in &quot;Love Me Tender&quot; in 1956 for 20th Century Fox, which was the biggest acting debut of all time, with the commercial success of the soundtrack EP being a bellwether for the next three Presley films, &quot;Loving You&quot;, &quot;Jailhouse Rock,&quot; and &quot;King Creole.&quot; Elvis returned to acting after leaving the army in 1960, with &quot;G.I. Blues&quot; and a dramatic western &quot;Flaming Star&quot;. The popularity of his romantic musicals established a formula for the coming years, with Elvis films being credited as the start of the modern music video.

Elvis experienced incredible success as both a singer and an actor in these years, doing what was and remains unheard of with hit films at the box office, hit singles, and hit albums all at the same time. Elvis holds the unprecedented feat of starring in 17 box office top-ten films between 1956 and 1965, with 17 number one singles and 8 number one albums in the same time period. A feat unmatched then and now. Elvis was also landing hit films, singles, and albums all at the same time, in the same calendar year

Over time, Presley became bitter that his hopes for dramatic roles were not coming to fruition, and after missing roles in &quot;West Side Story&quot;, &quot;Thunder Road&quot;, &quot;The Defiant Ones&quot;, and &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;. But Elvis was able to mix musical films like &quot;Girls! Girls! Girls!&quot; with action films, like &quot;Kid Galahad&quot;. Although Elvis hated Charles Bronson, the tough guy actor who was 5th billed in this modern boxing film and a template for &quot;Rocky&quot;. Bronson was one of the ten most famous actors to ever have the pleasure of working with Elvis.

Unfortunately, many of the big stars of the sixties were jealous of Elvis and this is one of the reasons why he stopped working with other leading actors, such as Steve McQueen. Even The Beatles wanted to appear in an Elvis film, but this wasn&#x27;t considered a good idea. Elvis continued to be incredibly successful and popular as a singer and actor at this time, with the 1964 hit film &quot;Roustabout&quot; becoming a favourite of Quentin Tarantino and proving Elvis was still able to compete with new artists of the day when the soundtrack album from this film went to number one on the Billboard 200 during Beatlemania.

Elvis&#x27; 1965 film &quot;Tickle Me&quot;, which was a favorite of his, saved the film studio Allied Artists from bankruptcy due to how much money it made with Elvis as the star. &quot;Tickle Me&quot; was the third highest-grossing film in the studio&#x27;s history. Allied Artists then went on to win numerous Academy Awards, although Elvis was never credited or thanked. Elvis was also generous enough to reduce his million-dollar salary to just $750,000 to help the studio. There is a belief that Elvis should be awarded a special honorary Oscar for his contribution to cinema.

Another Quentin Tarantino favorite that inspired &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; was Elvis&#x27; 1968 film &quot;Speedway&quot;, which is considered to be among the best NASCAR films ever made. Credited with helping the popularity of NASCAR Speedway was a box office success that featured famous racing stars of the day. Elvis also co-starred with Nancy Sinatra in this box office smash.

Elvis stated that &quot;Clambake&quot; was his worst film and began to complain about the deteriorating quality of the films and his belief that his manager&#x27;s objectives were more monetary than anything else. This resulted in a change to his acting career and a stop to the formula films in 1968, after which Presley starred in the comedy western &quot;Stay Away, Joe&quot;, the modern screwball comedy &quot;Live a Little, Love a Little&quot;, the dramatic western &quot;Charro!,&quot; and the social drama &quot;Change of Habit&quot;.

&quot;Charro!&quot; has been called the most convincing acting role of Elvis&#x27; career and &quot;Change of Habit&quot; was a major success that Elvis&#x27; manager decided against being considered for Academy Awards, famously saying, &quot;don&#x27;t go buying no tuxedos.&quot; &quot;Change of Habit&quot; is also considered the best final film of any singer turner actor.

At the expiration of all studio contracts, he returned to live entertaining and soon became the biggest star in Las Vegas history and on tour in America. The two concert documentaries &quot;&quot; in 1970 and &quot;Elvis on Tour&quot; in 1972 were the final theatrical releases for Presley. Both were among the most successful concert documentaries of their day, with &quot;Elvis on Tour&quot; winning prestige with a Golden Globe award and starting off the career of Martin Scorsese. Whilst Tom Parker opted against &quot;Elvis: That&#x27;s the Way It Is&quot; being submitted for Oscars due to the academy&#x27;s bias against Elvis and because they would try to use his name for ratings and prestige.

Presley was the highest paid actor in Hollywood but said that he didn&#x27;t need money to be successful and that no amount of money was necessary for him to take a good role. His films grossed $284 million and Elvis was paid 50% of those profits, making him the richest actor in Hollywood history. Adjusted for inflation, Elvis films made $2.2 billion. He was also paid $250,000 royalties from each of his 17 soundtrack albums from the movies, giving Elvis $4.2 million. Adjusted for inflation this amounts to $44.3 million from soundtrack album royalties on top of his usual salaries and bonuses. Elvis was in the &quot;Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll&quot; for seven years, making $1 million per film.

Of the many roles Elvis turned down, these included the John Wayne western &quot;True Grit&quot;. Elvis was asked to play the role that Glen Campbell played, but top billing with John Wayne was contested.

Elvis also wanted to do a screentest for &quot;The Godfather&quot; and missed out on the leading role in &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;, which was turned down by his manager without Elvis knowing. Elvis was also considered for the leading role in &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; but was busy performing in Las Vegas.

It was expected for Presley to be paid his usual million-dollar salary to star in &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;. Although interested in the role, Presley was ultimately not hired as Parker believed Presley would not receive top billing, and attempted to negotiate a higher salary and percentage of the film&#x27;s gross profits. Elvis regretted not making the film because he knew how good he would have been. But he also knew that this was a vanity project for Streisand and that she would have wanted to look better than Elvis, even though he was the better actor and bigger star. Elvis&#x27; manager &quot;Colonel Tom Parker&quot; also knew that Elvis wanted to develop himself as an actor. And so, [his manager] Colonel Parker turned down the opportunity, the offer for Elvis to star in ‘A Star is Born’ with Barbra Streisand... He didn’t want to see Elvis being overshadowed by Barbra Streisand. This is considered to be the biggest missed opportunity in cinema history.
 Elvis did decide to produce, write and star a karate film called &quot;The New Gladiators&quot;, which was a true passion project for the actor and 8th degree black belt, although this remained unfinished at the time of his death and lost out on its classic status.

Over the years and with a reassessment of his acting career, roles in films like &quot;Charro!&quot;, &quot;Wild in the Country&quot;, &quot;Change of Habit&quot;, and &quot;Live a Little, Love a Little&quot; have led to Presley receiving high praise as an actor. Many consider him to have been the best and most successful singer-actor in Hollywood history. Elvis also holds the unique distinction of every single one of his films making money at the box office.

In his remarkable career, Elvis activated film and TV spaces like never before, and because of Elvis Presley, there&#x27;s a direct thread from &quot;Love Me Tender&quot; and &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; to the &quot;Beatles&quot; &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; to &quot;Prince&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Purple Rain&quot; and more. Presley&#x27;s onscreen innovation also extends beyond cinema: 1973&#x27;s Aloha from Hawaii via Satellite was revolutionary in that it was the first live satellite broadcast to feature a single performer.

It is well known that the film academy was against Elvis, which is why he was never awarded an Oscar, although this has been reassessed and the success Elvis had in Hollywood remains the benchmark for every singer-turned-actor.
