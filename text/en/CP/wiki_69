<text>The 1920 United States House of Representatives elections were elections for the United States House of Representatives to elect members to serve in the 67th United States Congress. They were held for the most part on November 2, 1920, while Maine held its on September 13. They coincided with the election of President Warren G. Harding, the first time that women in all states were allowed to vote in federal elections after the passage of the 19th Amendment.

The incumbent Democratic administration of Woodrow Wilson lost popularity after the conclusion of World War I in 1918, as American voters hoped to return to isolationism and avoid military conflict in the future. Heedless of the prevailing national mood, Wilson advocated American leadership in a new international order under the League of Nations, alienated voters of German and Irish ancestry, and constantly struggled with a Congress controlled by the opposition Republican Party.

Harding and the Republicans promised a new start for the nation and a disassociation from Europe&#x27;s political troubles that most voters found appealing. As a result, the Republicans picked up 63 seats in the House of Representatives, with most of the gains coming from Democratic-leaning districts in the big industrial cities and the border states. Many of these districts elected Republican representatives for the only time in decades, and House Democratic leader Champ Clark was among those who lost reelection. Clark died 2 days before his term expired.

Although the Southern United States remained solidly Democratic for the most part, the Republicans secured more than 90% of the seats outside the South, which gave them their largest majority of the 20th century and as of 2023, their greatest number of seats ever. The 67th Congress is the most recent in which the Republican Party won greater than a two-thirds majority of seats in either chamber.

<text>The Embassy of the Republic of Croatia is the diplomatic mission of Croatia in Canada. It is located in Toller House at the corner of Chapel and Daly Streets in the Sandy Hill neighbourhood of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

The building was originally constructed in 1875 in Domestic Gothic Revival style by Henry Horsey and J. Sheard, architects. The first occupant was J.H. Plummer, the new Ottawa manager of the Bank of Commerce. Two years later, Télesphore Fournier, a Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, moved in with his family. It was bought by Auditor General of the Dominion’s Currency Frederick Toller in 1882. His family owned it until 1912 when it was bought by cabinet minister Louis-Philippe Brodeur who owned it until 1931. The house was owned by a group of nuns who used it as a residence and school until 1968. It was then rented out to students from the nearby University of Ottawa. 

The heritage building was purchased for the Republic of Croatia by the Croatian-Canadian community after Croatia gained its independence in 1993. Local fundraising also paid for the significant restoration work that completely refurbished the estate. It opened as the Croatian embassy in 1999. The building was included amongst other architecturally interesting and historically significant buildings in Doors Open Ottawa, held June 2 and 3, 2012.

Croatia also maintains a consular office in Mississauga.

<doc id="1342460" wikidata="Q1630386" url="?curid=1342460" title="Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One">
<text>Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One, commonly abbreviated to Lola Versus Powerman, or simply Lola, is the eighth studio album by the English rock band the Kinks, released on 27 November 1970. A concept album, it is a satirical appraisal of the music industry, including song publishers, unions, the press, accountants, business managers, and life on the road. It marked the group&#x27;s expansion to a five-piece with the addition of keyboardist John Gosling.

Although it appeared during a transitional period for the Kinks, &quot;Lola Versus Powerman&quot; was a success both critically and commercially for the group, charting in the Top 40 in America and helping restore them in the public eye, making it a &quot;comeback&quot; album. It contained two hit singles: &quot;Lola&quot;, which reached the top 10 in the US and UK, and &quot;Apeman&quot;, which peaked at number five in the UK.

In October 2020, Sanctuary Records released a 3-disc 50th Anniversary set that includes 36 extra tracks that include B-sides, outtakes, new mixes and alternate versions.

Musically &quot;Lola Versus Powerman&quot; is varied, described by Stephen Thomas Erlewine as &quot;a wildly unfocused but nonetheless dazzling &quot;tour de force&quot;&quot;, containing some of Ray Davies&#x27;s strongest songs.

A second part never followed &quot;Part One&quot;.

== Background and recording ==
The Kinks&#x27; ban by the American Federation of Musicians on performing in America, which had been in force since their 1965 US tour, was lifted in 1969, so the group&#x27;s management arranged a North American tour. However, members of the band fell ill, and the tour was shuffled, resulting in the band playing only a few dates in America and Canada. A follow-up tour in 1970 met with similar results, with the group performing at only a select number of venues, with many dates cancelled. The down time between the tours allowed Ray Davies, lead singer and songwriter of the group, to develop the band&#x27;s next single, &quot;Lola&quot;.

The Kinks returned to England to start work on their new LP in spring 1970. The group used Morgan Studios, an independent studio in Willesden, London, which was a change for them. They would continue recording their albums there until &quot;Preservation&quot;, when they switched to their newly purchased studio, Konk. Recording began in late April/early May. Some of the first songs recorded were &quot;Lola&quot;, the outtake &quot;The Good Life&quot;, &quot;Powerman&quot; and &quot;Got to Be Free&quot;. The sessions for &quot;Lola&quot; were especially long, and the recording continued into late May. Davies would recall later how he achieved the signature clangy sound at the beginning of the track:

 The National Steel would play an integral part in many Kinks projects after that. In the 1972 song &quot;Supersonic Rocket Ship&quot;, Ray Davies would use the guitar to create a Caribbean feel for the record. Davies would play it on numerous &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; appearances, and it would be featured in several music videos the Kinks made in the future, including &quot;Scattered&quot; in 1992.

Keyboardist John Gosling was added to the Kinks&#x27; lineup in May. He auditioned on the final backing master track for &quot;Lola&quot;, and was hired soon after. He was initially taken on solely for their upcoming US tour, but his post evolved into a more permanent position soon after. Gosling would remain with the band until 1978, departing after the release of &quot;Misfits&quot;. Dubbing for &quot;Lola&quot; was finished in June. Recording for the LP was completed by October, and it was mixed throughout the remainder of the month. &quot;Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One&quot; was released on 27 November 1970.

For &quot;Lola&quot;, Ray Davies overdubbed the trademarked word &quot;Coca-Cola&quot; with the generic &quot;cherry cola&quot; for the mono single release, as product placement rules meant the BBC (being a public service broadcaster) would not have played it. The lyrics in the gatefold sleeve of the original LP use the &quot;cherry cola&quot; line, though the album track contains the original stereo &quot;Coca-Cola&quot; version. A similar situation was encountered with the song &quot;Apeman&quot;, concerning the line &quot;the air pollution is a-foggin&#x27; up my eyes&quot;. &quot;Fogging&quot; was mistaken for &quot;fucking&quot;, and consequently Ray Davies had to re-record this line prior to its single release.

== Themes ==

The album is a satirical look at the various facets of the music industry, including song publishers (&quot;Denmark Street&quot;), unions (&quot;Get Back in Line&quot;), the press and the hit-making machine (&quot;Top of the Pops&quot;), accountants and business managers (&quot;The Moneygoround&quot;) and the road (&quot;This Time Tomorrow&quot;). Musically, &quot;Lola Versus Powerman&quot; is varied, contrasting gentle ballads like &quot;Get Back in Line&quot; and &quot;A Long Way from Home&quot; against hard rock songs like &quot;Rats&quot; and &quot;Powerman&quot;, with &quot;Denmark Street&quot; and &quot;The Moneygoround&quot; paying homage to the English music hall tradition.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Lola Versus Powerman&quot; was well-received throughout the British music press. A review in &quot;New Musical Express&quot; called &quot;[Ray] Davies ... one of the finest writers in contemporary rock,&quot; and praised the record&#x27;s British styles and originality. &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s interpretation of &quot;Lola Versus Powerman&quot; was Davies &quot;taking a cheeky nibble&quot; at the pop music business; they continued that &quot;The music&#x27;s pure Kinks simplicity—but it works.&quot;

The album received generally positive reviews in the US. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine commented that it was &quot;the best Kinks album yet&quot;. &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau commented that &quot;Lola&quot; had been an &quot;astounding single,&quot; but gave &quot;Lola Versus Powerman&quot; a lukewarm review, saying that &quot;the melodies are still there, but in this context they sound corny rather than plaintive.&quot; The single &quot;Lola&quot; received positive reviews, and, due to its success, an interview with Ray Davies by Jonathan Cott was featured as a cover story for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in November 1970.

Modern critical opinion towards &quot;Lola Versus Powerman&quot; is generally positive, albeit slightly less so. Initially given a positive review by the magazine in 1971, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; rated it 31/2 out of 5 stars in its 1992 printing—however, the fourth edition (published in 2004) ranked it at only 2 stars. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave the album a positive review, writing that &quot;Davies never really delivers a cohesive story, but the record holds together because it&#x27;s one of his strongest sets of songs.&quot;

== Commercial performance ==
&quot;Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One&quot; went virtually unnoticed by the record-buying public in the UK and failed to chart, despite the success of its lead single, &quot;Lola&quot;, which topped the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; charts in the UK, and reached #2 on &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. &quot;Lola&quot; became the Kinks&#x27; biggest success since &quot;Sunny Afternoon&quot; in 1966; the group would never again have another single reach this position in the UK. &quot;Lola&quot; was also successful in the US market, charting at #9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart, staying on the charts for 14 weeks. It also peaked at #7 on the &quot;Record World&quot; charts. &quot;Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One&quot; reached #35 on &quot;Billboard&quot;, and on the &quot;Record World&quot; charts it peaked at #22, making it their most successful album since the mid-60s.

== Aftermath and legacy ==
The success of the singles and album allowed the Kinks to negotiate a new contract with RCA Records, construct their own London Studio, which they named Konk, and assume more creative and managerial control. The record also proved influential: Tom Petty told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that he &quot;especially liked&quot; it, and cited the album as an influence on &quot;The Last DJ&quot;, another album critical of the music industry.

Tracks from &quot;Lola Versus Powerman&quot; have been featured in multiple films across several languages. One of the most notable uses of songs from the album was when &quot;This Time Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Strangers&quot;, and &quot;Powerman&quot; were featured in the 2007 Wes Anderson film &quot;The Darjeeling Limited&quot;; these tracks were later included on the accompanying soundtrack album. In France, &quot;This Time Tomorrow&quot; appeared in the 2005 Philippe Garrel film &quot;Les amants réguliers&quot;. &quot;Apeman&quot; has been featured in multiple films, including &quot;Mondovino&quot; (2004) and Harold Ramis&#x27; &quot;Club Paradise&quot; (1986).

Ray Davies adapted the album into an autobiographical drama, with the help of co-writer Paul Sirett, including new versions of songs from the album. This was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in December 2021.

== &quot;Part Two&quot; ==
Before the release of &quot;Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One&quot; the band discussed the possibility of it being released as a double album. According to Doug Hinman&#x27;s book, &quot;The Kinks: All Day and All of the Night&quot;, a sequel album was planned for release sometime in 1971, but was ultimately scrapped and the band opted to record &quot;Muswell Hillbillies&quot; instead. Due to the fact that an official title to the follow-up album was never revealed, Hinman refers to the album simply as &quot;Part Two&quot; and suggests that preliminary sessions may have occurred in late 1970/early 1971. It is unclear what songs would have appeared on this album, and it is unknown if any songs were even recorded, with the possible exception of some unreleased backing tracks. Almost certainly no songs were completed or mastered.

Ray Davies addressed the question of the unfinished sequel in a 2014 &quot;Uncut&quot; interview: &quot;Lola Versus Powerman…&quot; was good versus evil, obviously, and in &quot;Volume Two&quot;, I sketched out how you become your worst nightmare, how the good man goes so far he becomes the evil person he always fought against. But we had to do another tour, we had the RCA deal, and we had other recording projects that we had to work towards, and it got lost, unfortunately.

<doc id="1342473" wikidata="Q5470892" url="?curid=1342473" title="Fort Carroll">
<text>Fort Carroll is a artificial island and abandoned hexagonal sea fort in the middle of the Patapsco River, just south of Baltimore, Maryland. It is named for Charles Carroll of Carrollton (1737–1832), a signer of the Declaration of Independence.

==Design and construction==
In 1847, the State of Maryland permitted the United States War Department to construct a fort in the shallow water of Soller&#x27;s Point Flats to protect the city of Baltimore. Fort Carroll was important for the defense of Baltimore—before the fort&#x27;s construction, Fort McHenry just outside the city was the only military defensive structure between Baltimore and the Chesapeake Bay. The fort was part of the &quot;Permanent System&quot; or Third System construction program, which aimed to defend America&#x27;s most important ports.

Then Brevet-Colonel Robert E. Lee designed the hexagonal structure and supervised the construction, which the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers commenced in 1848. The fort received its name on October 8, 1850. In 1852, Lee left Baltimore to become Superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point.

In 1853, a lighthouse, now abandoned, was built on the ramparts to aid navigation into Baltimore Harbor. In 1898, a new lighthouse was built, which is still seen today. It was automated in 1920 and discontinued operations sometime before 1945.

The original design foresaw the fort armed with 225 cannons on three levels. However, in April 1861, at the American Civil War outbreak, Fort Carroll&#x27;s walls were still less than half the planned height of thirty feet. Only five gun platforms were ready, and only two were armed. Still, the Army placed about thirty cannons and occupied the fort throughout the war. In April 1864, torrential rains flooded the fort&#x27;s magazines, which led the Army to move all the powder and ammunition to Fort McHenry.
==Spanish–American War==
When the United States entered the Spanish–American War in 1898, the Army again defended the fort, although the batteries were completely obsolete by then. The Army, therefore, commenced the construction of modern concrete gun emplacements following the Board of Fortifications designs. The Army created three batteries: Battery Towson (two 12&quot; barbette carriage guns), Battery Heart (two 5-inch M1897 guns on balanced pillar mounts) and Battery Augustin (two 3&quot; balanced pedestal-mount guns).
The new batteries were ready by September 1900, well after the war&#x27;s end. They received their names on March 30, 1903.

==World War I and afterwards==

After World War I broke out, in 1917, the Army removed the guns from Battery Heart, and in 1918, those from Battery Towson to use elsewhere. By 1920, all guns had been removed from the fort.

In March 1921, the Army officially abandoned Fort Carroll and moved whatever military equipment was left to nearby Fort Howard. The War Department declared the island excess property in 1923 but took no immediate steps to sell the land. A variety of proposals for the use of the island were advanced, including a prison, as well as a 1923 plan advanced by Baltimore mayor William Broening to place an electric &quot;Welcome to Baltimore&quot; sign on the island, accompanied by a statue of Lord Baltimore.

In World War II, the Army used the fort as a firing range. It also served as a checkpoint for vessels.

In May 1958, Baltimore attorney Benjamin Eisenberg purchased the island for , intending to put a casino there, but development plans never materialized. The fort is now an involuntary park. It is also a site for occasional urban explorations (which constitute trespass). In 2013, Preservation Maryland placed Fort Carroll on its list of threatened historic properties. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015.

On April 19, 2024, the third temporary alternate channel established after the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge was named after the fort, the beginning of which is to its immediate west.

<doc id="1342483" wikidata="Q1363323" url="?curid=1342483" title="Thomas of Brotherton, 1st Earl of Norfolk">
<text>Thomas of Brotherton, 1st Earl of Norfolk (1 June 1300 – 4 August 1338), was the fifth son of King Edward I of England (1239–1307), and the eldest child by his second wife, Margaret of France, the daughter of King Philip III of France. He was, therefore, a younger half-brother of King Edward II (reigned 1307–1327) and a full brother of Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent. He occupied the office of Earl Marshal of England.

==Early life==
Thomas of Brotherton was born 1 June 1300 at the manor house at Brotherton, Yorkshire, son of King Edward I of England and Margaret of France. His mother was on her way to Cawood, where her confinement was scheduled to take place. According to Hilton, Margaret was staying at Pontefract Castle and was following a hunt when she went into labour. The chronicler William Rishanger records that during the difficult delivery his mother prayed, as was the custom at the time, to Thomas Becket, and Thomas of Brotherton was thus named after the saint and his place of birth.

King Edward I hastened to the queen and the newborn baby and had Thomas presented with two cradles. His brother Edmund of Woodstock was born in the year after that. They were overseen by wet nurses until they were six years old. Like their parents, they learned to play chess and ride horses. They were visited by nobles and their half-sister Mary of Woodstock, who was a nun. Their mother often accompanied their father on his campaigns to Scotland, but kept herself well-informed on their well-being.

Thomas&#x27;s father died when he was 7 years old. Thomas&#x27;s half-brother Edward, became king of England (Edward II) and Thomas was heir presumptive until his nephew, the future King Edward III, was born in 1312. The Earldom of Cornwall had been intended for Thomas, but his brother the King instead bestowed it upon his favourite, Piers Gaveston, in 1306. When Thomas was ten years old, King Edward II assigned to him and his brother Edmund, the estates of Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk, who had died without heirs in 1306.

==Career==

In 1312, Thomas was created Earl of Norfolk by Edward II, and on 10 February 1316, he was appointed Earl Marshal. While his brother was away fighting in Scotland, he was left Keeper of England. He was known for his hot and violent temper. He was one of the many victims of the unchecked greed of the king&#x27;s new favourite, Hugh Despenser the Younger and his father Hugh Despenser the Elder, who stole some of the young earl&#x27;s lands.

He allied himself with Queen Isabella and Roger Mortimer when they invaded England in 1326, and stood as one of the judges in the trials against both Despensers. When his nephew Edward III reached his majority and took the government into his own hands Thomas, who had helped with the deposition, became one of his principal advisors. It was in the capacity of Lord Marshal that he commanded the right wing of the English army at the Battle of Halidon Hill on 19 July 1333.

Thomas died on 4 August 1338, and was buried in the choir of the Abbey of Bury St Edmunds. As he had no surviving sons, Thomas was succeeded by his daughter, Margaret, as Countess of Norfolk. She was later created Duchess of Norfolk for life in 1397.

As a son of Edward I of England, Thomas was entitled to bear the coat of arms of the Kingdom of England, differenced by a &quot;label argent of three points&quot;.

==Marriages and issue==
Thomas married, firstly, before 8 January 1326, Alice de Hales (d. bef. 12 October 1330), daughter of Sir Roger de Hales of Hales Hall in Loddon in Roughton, Norfolk, a coroner, by his wife, Alice Skogan, by whom he had a son and two daughters:

*Margaret, Duchess of Norfolk, who married firstly John Segrave, 4th Baron Segrave, and secondly Wauthier de Masny.
*Edward of Norfolk, who married Beatrice Mortimer, daughter of Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March, but died without issue before 9 August 1334.
*Alice of Norfolk, who married Edward Montagu, 1st Baron Montagu.

Thomas&#x27;s wife Alice died by October 1330, when a chantry was founded for her soul in Bosham, Sussex.

Thomas married, secondly, before 4 April 1336, Mary de Brewes (died 11 June 1362), widow of Sir Ralph de Cobham (died 5 February 1326), and daughter of Sir Peter de Brewes (died before 7 February 1312) of Tetbury, Gloucestershire, by Agnes de Clifford (died before 1332), by whom he had no surviving issue.

<text>&quot;The Changing of the Guard&quot; is the 102nd episode of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
Professor Ellis Fowler is an elderly English literature teacher at the Rock Spring School, a boys&#x27; prep school in Vermont, who is forced into retirement after teaching for 51 years at the school. Looking through his old yearbooks and reminiscing about his former students, he becomes convinced that all of his lessons have been in vain and that he has accomplished nothing with his life.

Deeply depressed, he prepares to kill himself on the night of Christmas Eve next to a statue of the famous educator Horace Mann, with its quote &quot;Be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity.&quot; Before he can follow through, however, he is called back to his classroom by a phantom bell, where he is visited by ghosts of several boys who were his students, all dead, several of whom died heroically.

The boys tell him of how he inspired them to become better men, and the difference he made in their lives. One posthumously received the Medal of Honor for actions at Iwo Jima; another died of leukemia after exposure to X-Rays during research into cancer treatments; another died at Pearl Harbor after saving 12 other men. All were inspired by Fowler&#x27;s teachings. Moved to tears, Fowler hears the phantom bell again, and his former pupils disappear. Now accepting of his retirement, content that his life is fuller for having enriched the lives of the boys, he listens to his current students caroling outside his home.

==Closing narration==
==Production notes==
Donald Pleasence was heavily made up to appear much older than his actual age of 42.

The quote Professor Fowler reads on the statue&#x27;s plinth, &quot;Be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity&quot;, is the motto of Rod Serling&#x27;s alma mater Antioch College, and was spoken by its first president Horace Mann at the college&#x27;s first commencement. Serling accepted a teaching post there after completing this script.

<text>&quot;Utah...This Is the Place&quot; is the regional anthem (or state song) of the U.S. state of Utah. It was written in 1996 by Sam and Gary Francis for Utah&#x27;s centennial celebrations. It replaced &quot;Utah, We Love Thee&quot; as the state song in 2003, after 4th grade students at Cook Elementary wanted a song that was fun to sing. The students talked to their local state representative, Dana Love, and she drafted a bill that passed the state legislature on 28 February 2003, and was signed by then Utah Governor Mike Leavitt on 15 March 2003. The previous song, &quot;Utah, We Love Thee&quot;, became the State Hymn.

This song was placed in the public domain by the composers when it was made the state song of Utah. The song is referenced imprecisely in official publications variously by the names &quot;Utah, This is the Place&quot; and &quot;Utah This is the Place&quot;. Though the Utah-themed children&#x27;s album on which the song has been published by its writers is named &quot;Utah, This Is This Place&quot;, the song itself is named &quot;Utah...This Is the Place&quot;.

==Lyrics==
&lt;poem&gt;
Utah! People working together
Utah! What a great place to be.
Blessed from Heaven above.
It&#x27;s the land that we love.
This is the place!

Utah! With its mountains and valleys.
Utah! With its canyons and streams.
You can go anywhere.
But there&#x27;s none that compare.
This is the place!

It was Brigham Young who led the pioneers across the plains.
They suffered with the trials they had to face.
With faith they kept on going till they reached the Great Salt Lake
Here they heard the words, &quot;This is the place!&quot;

Utah! With its focus on family,
Utah! Helps each child to succeed.
People care how they live.
Each has so much to give.
This is the place!

Utah! Getting bigger and better.
Utah! Always leading the way.
New technology&#x27;s here...
Growing faster each year.
This is the place!

There is beauty in the snow-capped mountains, in the lakes and streams.
There are valleys filled with farms and orchards too.
The spirit of its people shows in everything they do.
Utah is the place where dreams come true.

Utah! With its pioneer spirit.
Utah! What a great legacy!
Blessed from Heaven above.
It&#x27;s the land that we love.
This is the place,

Utah! Utah! Utah!
This is the place!
&lt;/poem&gt;

<text>The Quedlinburg &quot;Itala&quot; fragment (Berlin, Staatsbibliothek Preußischer Kulturbesitz, Cod. theol. lat. fol. 485) is a fragment of six folios from a large 5th-century illuminated manuscript of an Old Latin &quot;Itala&quot; translation of parts of 1 Samuel of the Old Testament. It was probably produced in Rome in the 420s or 430s. It is the oldest surviving illustrated biblical manuscript and has been in the Berlin State Library since 1875-76. The pages are approximately 305 x 205 mm large.

The fragments were found from 1865 onwards (two in 1865, two in 1867, one in 1887) re-used in the bindings of different books that had been bound in the 17th century in the town of Quedlinburg, home of Quedlinburg Abbey, a large Imperial monastery, where the manuscript may well have spent much of its life.

The illustrations are grouped in framed miniatures occupying an entire page, with between two and five miniatures per page, with the corresponding text being on the other side of the pages; there are fourteen miniatures in total. One folio contains only text. The illustrations, although much damaged, are done in the illusionistic style of late antiquity.

==Style and context==
Much of the paint surface is lost revealing the underlying writing that gives instructions to the artist who would execute the pictures, such as: &quot;Make the tomb [by which] Saul and his servant stand and two men, jumping over pits, speak to him and [announce that the asses have been found]. Make Saul by a tree and [his] servant [and three men who talk] to him, one carrying three goats, one [three loaves of bread, one] a wine-skin.&quot; This suggests that the programme of images was newly devised for this volume, rather than merely copying an earlier work. This, the usual conclusion, was disputed by Ernst Kitzinger, who argued that they were to aid the artist who was copying images from the different format of a scroll. However Walter Cahn sees the instructions as far more detailed than would be needed for that. Whether original or not, the images are &quot;the fruit of what we must imagine to have been a thoroughly rationalized and quasi-industrial method of production&quot;, in &quot;a stable craft with settled routines&quot;. They are painted in &quot;an illusionistic style with an emphasis on imperial imagery&quot; (Saul and David are dressed as emperors in military costume), and gold is used for highlights and the &quot;tituli&quot; or captions to the images. The text is in a &quot;superior uncial script&quot;, while the instructions to the artist are in &quot;an eccentric Roman cursive&quot;.

The full extent of the original manuscript is not known. Some of the episodes illustrated are very minor, suggesting that the whole manuscript may have been illustrated at this density, which is greater than any later Biblical manuscript; according to Kurt Weitzmann &quot;It staggers the imagination to picture what a fully illustrated manuscript of the two books of Samuel and the two books of Kings must have looked like&quot;. The style suggests it may have been made by the same workshop responsible for the Vergilius Vaticanus, and has links with the mosaics of Santa Maria Maggiore. According to Kitzinger: &quot;Evidently this book was commissioned by a patron who belonged to the same social stratum as the sponsors of &quot;de luxe&quot; editions of the classics and who shared many of the same cultural values&quot;. The other very early illustrated biblical manuscripts that have survived are similar densely illustrated texts of specific books from the Old Testament, mostly the Book of Genesis (Vienna Genesis, Cotton Genesis), which, with some specific details of the illustrations, leads scholars to postulate an earlier tradition of Jewish luxury manuscripts, perhaps in scroll format, in the Hellenized Jewish world. The Books of Kings feature strongly in the uniquely extensive wall-paintings of the Dura-Europos Synagogue from the 3rd century.

The figures have landscape backgrounds, &quot;atmospheric, autumnal settings, with softly shaded skies of pink and light blue&quot;, that are &quot;very close&quot; to those of the Vergilius Vaticanus, whereas the Santa Maria Maggiore mosaics see the beginning of the use of a plain gold background in some scenes, the start of what was to become a very common feature in religious art for the next thousand years. But in many respects, the mosaics look (at the expense of visibility, given their high placement) like enlarged miniatures, just as the miniatures of both manuscripts draw on the styles of larger paintings.

==Saul and Samuel==

The fragment includes a full page with four miniatures illustrating the episode at 1 Samuel 15:13-33:

<doc id="1342526" wikidata="Q1557589" url="?curid=1342526" title="Mr. Do!">
<text>is a 1982 maze video game developed by Universal. It is the first arcade video game to be released as a conversion kit for other cabinets; Taito published the conversion kit in Japan. The game was inspired by Namco&#x27;s &quot;Dig Dug&quot; released earlier in 1982. &quot;Mr. Do!&quot; was a commercial success in Japan and North America, selling 30,000 arcade units in the US, and it was followed by several arcade sequels.

==Gameplay==

The object of &quot;Mr. Do!&quot; is to score as many points as possible by digging tunnels through the ground and collecting cherries. The title character, Mr. Do (a circus clown—except for the original Japanese version of the game, in which he is a snowman), is constantly chased by red dinosaur-like monsters called creeps, and the player loses a life if Mr. Do is caught by one. The game ends when the last life is lost.

Cherries are distributed throughout the level in groups of eight, and collecting all the cherries in one group without a pause awards bonus points. A level is complete either when all cherries are removed, all creeps are destroyed, &quot;EXTRA&quot; is spelled, or a diamond is found.

Mr. Do can defeat creeps by hitting them with his bouncing &quot;power ball&quot; or by dropping large apples on them. While the power ball is bouncing toward a creep, Mr. Do is defenseless. If the ball bounces into an area where there are no creeps to hit (such as behind a fallen apple), Mr. Do cannot use it again until he has retrieved it. When the power ball hits a creep, it then reforms in Mr. Do&#x27;s hands after a delay that increases with each use.

Mr. Do or the creeps can push an apple off the edge of a vertical tunnel and crush one or more creeps. If an apple falls more than its own height, it breaks and disappears. Mr. Do can also be crushed by a falling apple, causing a loss of life.

Occasionally, the creeps transform briefly into more powerful multicolored monsters that can tunnel through the ground. If one of these digs through a cherry, it leaves fewer cherries for Mr. Do to collect. When it digs under an apple, it often crushes itself, other creeps, and/or Mr. Do.

As the game progresses, a display at the top of the screen cycles through the letters in the word EXTRA. Every time the player&#x27;s score reaches a multiple of 5,000 points, the highlighted letter enters the playfield as an Alphamonster, which can be defeated in the same manner as a creep. Defeating the Alphamonster awards its letter; collecting all five letters ends the level, plays a cut scene accompanied by the theme to &quot;Astro Boy&quot;, and awards the player an extra life. Alphamonsters attempt to eat any apples they encounter, which makes them difficult to crush.

The creeps spawn at the center of the screen. After they have all appeared, the generator will turn into a food item; picking this up scores bonus points, freezes all the creeps, and calls out an Alphamonster (if one is not already on the field) and three large blue monsters. The latter can eat apples as well. The creeps stay frozen until the player either defeats all three blue monsters, defeats the Alphamonster (in which case any remaining blue monsters are turned into apples), loses a life, or completes the stage.

Rarely, dropping an apple reveals a diamond which, if collected, completes the level and awards a bonus credit to the player.

==Development==

&quot;Mr. Do!&quot; was created by Kazutoshi Ueda. It was inspired by the gameplay in Namco&#x27;s &quot;Dig Dug&quot; game, similar to how many of Universal&#x27;s other games took license from other companies&#x27; more successful games, e.g. &quot;Lady Bug&quot; (also designed by Ueda) being similar to &quot;Pac-Man&quot;. The idea for the power ball came from Mr. Ueda observing a Super Ball stuck on the roof of a home near the Universal office in Japan.

==Ports==
&quot;Mr. Do!&quot; was ported to the Atari 2600, Atari 8-bit computers, ColecoVision, Apple II, MSX, Neo Geo, Tomy Tutor, and Commodore 64. A handheld LCD version was released by Tomy in 1983.

In the ColecoVision adaptation, the Alphamonster and sidekicks are unable to eat apples, making them easier to crush, but the blue monsters eat the shrubbery and cherries. Also, if an Alphamonster is over a letter that has already been acquired, the dinosaur monsters just freeze for a few seconds.

The Apple II and Atari 8-bit computer versions were released in May 1985.

==Reception==

In Japan, &quot;Mr. Do!&quot; was one of the top ten highest-grossing arcade games of 1982, on the annual &quot;Game Machine&quot; chart. &quot;Game Machine&quot; later listed &quot;Mr. Do!&quot; on their June 15, 1983 issue as being the 21st highest-earning table arcade cabinet of the month.

The arcade game was also a commercial success in North America, where it became the best-selling conversion kit up until 1984, selling approximately 30,000 arcade units in the United States. On the &quot;Play Meter&quot; arcade charts, it topped the street locations chart in May 1983. On the &quot;RePlay&quot; arcade charts, it topped the software conversion kit charts for five months in 1983, in June and then from August through November. It was among the thirteen highest-earning arcade games of 1983 in the United States, according to the Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association (AMOA).

&quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; magazine gave the arcade original a positive review, stating that it &quot;takes the best from&quot; &quot;Dig Dug&quot; and said that improves on it. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; later rated the ColecoVision version 81% and Atari VCS version 77% in 1989. &quot;Computer Games&quot; magazine gave the ColecoVision and Coleco Adam conversions a B+ rating in 1985.

&quot;Famicom Tsūshin&quot; awarded the Super Famicom version of the game 25 out of 40. The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave it 4.875 out of 10. All but Dan Hsu felt that &quot;Mr. Do!&quot; has fun gameplay, but they criticized the lack of enhancements to what was by then over a decade old game, and recommended that players only get it if it were released at significantly less than the normal retail price for an SNES cartridge. Their later feature on 16-bit games reported that, contrary to their hopes, the game was priced at over $50. In 1995, Flux magazine ranked the arcade version 67th on their &quot;Top 100 Video Games&quot; list.

==Legacy==
&quot;Mr. Do!&quot; was followed by three sequels: &quot;Mr. Do&#x27;s Castle&quot; in 1983, &quot;Mr. Do&#x27;s Wild Ride&quot;, and &quot;Do! Run Run&quot; both in 1984. An expanded 99-level version of &quot;Mr. Do!&quot; was released in arcades by Electrocoin in 1988.

&quot;Neo Mr. Do!&quot;, was developed by Visco and licensed by Universal for SNK&#x27;s Neo Geo system in 1997. &quot;Mr. Do!&quot; was adapted to Nintendo&#x27;s Game Boy and Super NES with some new gameplay features. A rebranded adaptation of the game was released for the Game Boy Color in 1999 as &quot;Quest: Fantasy Challenge&quot; (&quot;Holy Magic Century&quot; in Europe). It was developed by Imagineer.

The arcade version was released for the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on April 27, 2010.

===Impact===
&quot;Mr. Do!&quot; is credited as the first arcade game to be released as a conversion kit. Multiple clones of &quot;Mr. Do!&quot; were released for home systems, including &quot;Magic Meanies&quot; (ZX Spectrum), &quot;Henri&quot; (Atari 8-bit), &quot;Fruity Frank&quot; (Amstrad CPC, MSX), &quot;Mr. Dig&quot; (TRS-80 Color Computer, Atari 8-bit). and Mr Ee for the BBC Micro.

The game&#x27;s creator Kazutoshi Ueda went on to work at Tehkan (now Tecmo) and then became a co-founder of Atlus, where he worked on the &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; series. Ueda&#x27;s work at Universal, particularly &quot;Mr. Do!&quot;, inspired the game design style of Tehkan&#x27;s Michitaka Tsuruta, who went on to create &quot;Guzzler&quot; (1983), &quot;Bomb Jack&quot; (1984), &quot;Solomon&#x27;s Key&quot; (1986), and the &quot;Captain Tsubasa&quot; game series.

<doc id="1342537" wikidata="Q7876753" url="?curid=1342537" title="Uchoten">
<text>Uchōten (有頂天 ecstasy) is a Japanese experimental new wave/post punk band, active in the 1980s and early 1990s. They formed in 1982 and disbanded in 1991, after releasing eight studio albums and two live albums. In 2015, after over two decades apart, Uchoten reunited.

==History==

Uchoten formed in Tokyo, Japan from the band Densenbyou. Densenbyou&#x27;s last concert and Uchoten&#x27;s first concert were both on 6 April 1982. They are led by vocalist Kera.

Uchoten released their first album and singles on Kera&#x27;s independent record label, Nagomu. In 1985, they released &quot;Kokoro no tabi&quot; on a bigger indie label, Captain, a cover of a popular Japanese song from 1973 performed by Tulip. Uchoten, The Willard and Laughin&#x27; Nose were referred to as the &quot;Indies Big Three&quot;.

In September 1986 they released their major debut album, &quot;Peace&quot;.
&quot;Peace&quot; has a theme of ending and death, and because of this some fans worried that Uchoten were going to break up, however they lasted five more years with several lineup changes.

Uchoten initially played their last concert on 15 September 1991, a recording of which was later released on a CD titled &quot;Search For 1/3 Fin&quot;, until reforming in 2015 after 24 years disbanded.

Throughout their career, Uchoten has performed a number of covers, of artists including King Crimson, Gilbert O&#x27;Sullivan, Lizard, P-Model and Takuro Yoshida.

<text>Standard-bearer (Polish: &quot;Chorąży&quot; ; Russian and Ukrainian: , &quot;khorunzhiy&quot;; , chorunžis; ) is a military rank in Poland, Ukraine and some neighboring countries. A &quot;chorąży&quot; was once a knight who bore an ensign, the emblem of an armed troops, a voivodship, a land, a duchy, or a kingdom. This function later evolved into a non-hereditary noble title.

From the end of the 14th century in the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and later in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, there were four &quot;central&quot; &quot;chorąży&quot; positions:

* Grand Standard-Bearer of the Crown;
* Grand Standard-Bearer of Lithuania;
* Court Standard-Bearer of the Crown;
* Court Standard-Bearer of Lithuania.

At the same time, &quot;chorąży&quot; was also an honorary office in a land.

From the 16th century, &quot;Chorąży&quot; was the title of the military leader of a Cossack community, and later a rank in the Cossack Hosts. The rank, written &quot;хорунжий&quot; (khorunzhiy) in Russian, was officially recognized in the 1792 Table of Ranks. This Cossack junior officer rank corresponded to the rank of second lieutenant (&quot;подпоручик&quot;, or podporuchik) of infantry or cornet of cavalry.

In the Polish Legions (1914–18), the Second Polish Republic in 1919–22 and from 1963 in the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland (from 1989, in contemporary Poland), it has been a non-commissioned officer&#x27;s rank, above sergeants&#x27; and below second lieutenant. Warrant Officer OR-7, OR-8, OR-9. Between 1944 and 1957, it was the lowest officer&#x27;s rank.

== Poland ==
===History===

Corps warrant officers is the name of the personal body of soldiers in the Polish Army, which existed between 1963 and 2004, higher than the NCO corps, and lower than the officer. The body was introduced in 1963, expanded in terms of the hierarchy in 1967 and 1996 and again in July 2004 it was abolished as a separate rank, while the ranks of soldiers wearing standard-bearers included senior NCOs. At the time of the introduction of this corps, professional soldiers who are its members should hold a secondary education matriculation. Virtually warrant were highly skilled technicians.

The decision of the politicians who are motivated in their conduct by a lack of warrant officers in the armies of both NATO and others, the warrant officers corps was liquidated, dropping them to the NCO corps. Result was a marked change in the ratio between officers and NCOs standard-bearers. This decision is criticized, among others for the fact that according to some stakeholders the possibility of multiple standard-bearer was closed and education skills, because that decision is thought to be supportive of officers&#x27; responsibilities as including the planning and decision-making process(es), whereas that of non-commissioned officers include carrying out officers&#x27; orders.

<doc id="1342550" wikidata="Q203476" url="?curid=1342550" title="Port Blair">
<text>Port Blair (), officially named Sri Vijaya Puram, is the capital city of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a union territory of India in the Bay of Bengal. It is also the local administrative sub-division (&quot;tehsil&quot;) of the islands, the headquarters for the district of South Andaman, and the territory&#x27;s only notified town.

Port Blair is the entry point for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It is connected with mainland India by both air and sea. It is a two to three-hour flight from mainland India to Port Blair&#x27;s Veer Savarkar International Airport and three to four days by sea to reach Kolkata, Chennai, or Visakhapatnam from Haddo Wharf in the city. It is home to several museums and the major naval base INS Jarawa of the Indian Navy, along with sea and air bases of the Indian Coast Guard, Andaman and Nicobar Police, Andaman and Nicobar Command, the first integrated tri-command between the Indian Armed Forces, Indian Air Force and the navy.

The historic Cellular Jail is in the city, and nearby small islands such as Corbyn&#x27;s Cove, Wandoor, Ross Island and Viper Island were once home to British colonists. The city was named after Captain Archibald Blair, a British colonial navy official of the East India Company. On 13 September 2024, the Government of India renamed the city to Sri Vijaya Puram.

==History==
===Pre-history===
The indigenous inhabitants are the Andamanese. Radiocarbon dating studies of the kitchen refuse dumps from the mounds excavated by the Anthropological Survey of India at Choladari near Port Blair indicate human occupation for at least 2,000 years, although they are likely to have diverged from the inhabitants of the mainland significantly earlier.

===Modern history===
In 1789 the Government of Bengal established a penal colony on Chatham Island in the southeast bay of Great Andaman, named Port Blair in the honour of Archibald Blair of the East India Company. After two years, the colony moved to the northeast part of Great Andaman and was named Port Cornwallis after Admiral William Cornwallis. However, there was much disease and death in the penal colony, and the government ceased operating it in May 1796.

In 1824 Port Cornwallis was the rendezvous of the fleet carrying the army to the First Anglo-Burmese War. In the 1830s and 1840s, shipwrecked crews who landed on the Andamans were often attacked and killed by the natives, alarming the British government. In 1855, the government proposed another settlement on the islands, including a convict establishment, but the Indian Rebellion of 1857 forced a delay in its construction.

However, since the rebellion provided the British with a lot of new prisoners, it made the new Andaman settlement and prison an urgent necessity. Construction began in November 1857 at the renovated Port Blair, avoiding the vicinity of a saltwater swamp that seemed to have been the source of many of the old colony&#x27;s problems. The penal colony was originally on Viper Island. The convicts, mostly political prisoners, suffered life imprisonment at hard labour under cruel and degrading conditions. Many were hanged, while others died of disease and starvation. Between 1864 and 1867 a penal establishment was also built with convict labour on the northern side of Ross Island. These structures now lie in ruins.

As the Indian independence movement continued to grow in the late 19th century, the enormous Cellular Jail was constructed between 1896 and 1906 to house Indian convicts, mostly political prisoners, in solitary confinement. The Cellular Jail is also known as &quot;Kala Pani&quot; (translated as &quot;Black Waters&quot;), a name given to it due to the torture and general ill-treatment of its Indian convicts.

In World War II the islands were occupied by the Japanese on 23 March 1942 without opposition from the garrison. From 1943 to 1944, Port Blair served as the headquarters of the Azad Hind government under Subhas Chandra Bose. British forces returned to the islands in October 1945.

Although affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, Port Blair survived sufficiently to act as a base for relief efforts in the islands. In 2017 it was selected as one of the cities to be developed as a smart city under the Smart Cities Mission.

==Climate==
Port Blair has a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Am&quot;), with little variation in average temperature and large amounts of precipitation throughout the year. All months except January, February, and March receive substantial rainfall.

Lowest recorded temperature: on 5 June 1986

<doc id="1342552" wikidata="Q15044792" url="?curid=1342552" title="The Jimmy Swift Band">
<text>The Jimmy Swift Band is a Canadian indie rock band from Halifax, Nova Scotia that combines elements of rock, jam, and electronica. Their band currently consists of 4 members, Craig Mercer on guitar and vocals, Mike MacDougall on bass, Aaron Collier on keyboards and effects, and Nick Wombolt on drums, the band has been most often described as rocktronica.

==Career==
Formed in the late 1990s by members of the now-defunct band PF Station, JSB&#x27;s name comes from the title of a subject in one of PF Station&#x27;s songs, &quot;A Night in the Life of Fly Jimmy Swift.&quot; Before their current name, the band was previously known as Fly Jimmy Swift.
Combining guitar and a distinctly electronica keyboard sound with a rock rhythm section, the band is known for its live show with lengthy progressive instrumental jams.

The band has released five studio albums, two live albums, a live 5.1 concert DVD, a remix album, and a package on 8-track tape. They&#x27;ve won three East Coast Music Awards and numerous Music Industry Association of Nova Scotia (MIANS/Music Nova Scotia) awards over the past 15 years.

In 2004, the band produced their first video for the single &quot;Two Hands on the Wheel&quot; with New Brunswick filmmaker Greg Hemmings. On November 28, 2006, JSB released an animated video produced by Copernicus Studios for the single &quot;Turnaround&quot;, from the album &quot;Weight of the World&quot;.
For close to 15 years, the band played up to 250 shows a year across Canada and the US, with stints in Asia and the Bahamas. They were considered instrumental in the development of Eastern Canada&#x27;s Evolve Festival and Prince Edward Island&#x27;s Shoreline Festival. Other events include Moedown (NY), Haymaker (VA), the World Electronic Music Festival (Toronto), Canada Day celebrations in Bermuda, and more. The group is at the head of the Atlantic Canada jam scene and frequently plays with fellow scenemates Grand Theft Bus and Slowcoaster.

On May 13, 2011, it was announced by Aaron Collier on his website that the band had decided to break up. Three years later, the band announced it would be touring Eastern Canada for one final tour, ending with a performance at the Evolve Music Festival in Antigonish, Nova Scotia.

Aaron Collier has gone on to a career in theatre, founding the Heist theatre company with his husband Richie Wilcox and becoming best known for his play &quot;The Princess Show&quot;.

<doc id="1342563" wikidata="Q5303521" url="?curid=1342563" title="Downtown Newark">
<text>Downtown Newark is the central business district of Newark in Essex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey.

Downtown is the site of the original Puritan settlement of Newark located at a bend in the Passaic River. The first settlers, led by Robert Treat, landed not far from the present site of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center. The intersection of Broad and Market Streets, known as the Four Corners was once considered the busiest intersection in the nation, and is the heart of traditional downtown.

Most of Newark&#x27;s office buildings are located in this area including Prudential Financial&#x27;s Headquarters (also known as Prudential Plaza) and their new office tower that was recently constructed on Broad Street across from Military Park. In the post-World War II era, downtown seemed to be moving north during the &quot;New Newark&quot; architectural period, in the direction of Washington Park. Since the 1967 civil unrest, it has been shifting slightly east in the direction of Newark Penn Station, the Gateway Center and the Passaic River. Panasonic constructed their North American HQ building on Raymond Blvd near McCarter Hwy. There are several more new office buildings including One Newark Center, The Legal And Communications Building, The two Penn Plaza office buildings, which are home to NJ Transit and Horizon Blue Cross, the Claremont building on McCarter Hwy, which is office space for the FBI and several other federal agencies, and a few other office buildings. There is also several projects in the design stages for this area.
Downtown Newark is the home to Newark&#x27;s major cultural venues - the New Jersey Performing Arts Center (NJPAC), the 3,000-seat Newark Symphony Hall, Prudential Center, the critically acclaimed Newark Museum of Art, Military Park, and the New Jersey Historical Society. Downtown is also home to Seton Hall University School of Law and Aljira, an emerging artist&#x27;s gallery. It is also home to historic Grace Church (Episcopal), and the Government Center, an area of municipal and federal government offices, as well as the Newark Convention and Visitors Bureau, where visitors can find out all things happening in the city of Newark. It was once home to a Chinatown neighborhood centered on Mulberry Arcade, which was off of Mulberry Street, near Lafayette and Green Streets. At the intersection of Mulberry St &amp; Green St the Newark Parking Authority is building a five floor parking deck which will also feature office space for the Parking Authority and a cafe with indoor and outdoor seating. Many of downtown&#x27;s cultural and historical sites are linked by the unmarked Lenape Trail, which also leads to Branch Brook Park, the Watchung Mountains and the Passaic Meadows on this yellow-blazed trail.

The $375 million Prudential Center, home to the New Jersey Devils, opened on October 25, 2007, with the first of ten concerts by Bon Jovi. Since then numerous &quot;big name&quot; acts have performed there, the Rolling Stones pay per view 50th anniversary concert in 2013 was broadcast from the Prudential Center. At the time, the arena was the New York metropolitan area&#x27;s first all-new professional sports venue in over two decades. The 2019 MTV Video Music Awards show took place there on August 26.

==Four Corners==
Much of the city&#x27;s retail and commercial developments is centered on Broad Street and Market Street. The intersection of the two streets, known as Four Corners is widely considered to be one of the busiest in the state and at one time was considered the busiest in the country.

Both Broad Street and Market Street are a bustle of activity crowded with numerous shops. Broad Street has many street vendors as well. At night, however, the streets are vacant and shops are closed. The City of Newark is committed to turning downtown into a &quot;24-hour city&quot; and the downtown area is slowly beginning to develop a 24-hour presence. The former Hahne&#x27;s and Lefcourt buildings have been converted into mixed use developments and other retail establishments including restaurants, bookstore, bank, doctors office, and over one hundred residential apartments beginning in 2014. A six-story addition and underground parking was built on the Halsey St side of the complex. Also, two brand new luxury high rise apartment buildings have recently opened. One Theatre Square, which is directly opposite the NJPAC, developed by Dranoff Properties, it is 23 stories and features private balconies/terraces, parking deck, rooftop swimming pool, and other amenities. Nearby, Boraie Development constructed the 21 story luxury apartment building known as 50 Rector Street. It was constructed on the former site of Science High School. It also has many amenities including underground parking, rooftop swimming pool and tiki bar, etc.. Rutgers–Newark has built two dormitories on Central Avenue, and an Honors Living/Learning Center on Halsey St between New and Linden Sts. An old office building on Clinton Street has already successfully been converted to luxury lofts. Additionally, 1180 Raymond, which is across from Military Park and Newark&#x27;s second tallest building, completed a $150 million conversion to luxury apartments in 2006. Recently, the former home of New Jersey Bell at 540 Broad St has been converted into market rate apartments. Verizon will still lease three floors in the building. The structure is named Walker House, after the building&#x27;s original architect Leyland Walker. The former Kislak building at 579 Broad St near Central Ave has recently been converted into market rate apartments.

Aided by the presence of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, new apartments, and its proximity to the Newark&#x27;s colleges and universities, including New Jersey Institute of Technology and Rutgers-Newark, downtown has seen a variety of restaurants and bars open their doors in the past several years. In addition to several high end restaurants catering to the theater crowd, downtown Newark is home to two Irish pubs, a SoHo style bistro, a gourmet soup restaurant, and an increasing number of other establishments.

Most buses pass through Downtown and it is a principal shopping district of most Newark area residents. Washington Street Station, Penn Station, Military Park Station and all the stops on the Newark Light Rail serve the downtown area. Interstate 280 lies just north of Downtown, running parallel to New Jersey Transit rail operations.

The Main Library is on Washington Park and served by the Newark Light Rail.

<doc id="1342564" wikidata="Q2278370" url="?curid=1342564" title="Stolnik">
<text>Stolnik (, , , , ) was a court office in Lithuania, Poland, Ukraine and Russia, responsible for serving the royal table, then an honorary court title and a district office. It approximately corresponds to English term .

== Stolnik in Crown of Poland ==
In the Crown of Poland under the first Piast dukes and kings, this was a court office. 

From the 14th century, it was an honorary court title in the Kingdom of Poland, since the 16th century.
* Grand Stolnik of the Crown ()
* Stolnik of the Crown ()
* Court Stolnik of the Crown ()

According to the 1768 district office hierarchy, the Stolnik&#x27;s position in the Crown of Poland was superior to that of Deputy cup-bearer and inferior to that of district judge. 

== Stolnik in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania ==
In Lithuania, the Stolnik&#x27;s position emerged in the late 15th century, comparatively later than Marshal, Treasurer, and Cup-bearer, with the first Grand Stolnik of Lithuania, , being known from 1475. Initially, the Stolnik took care of the Grand Duke&#x27;s food warehouses, distribution of food, his manor&#x27;s parks, gardens, ponds, and villages assigned to the estates. However, in the late 16th century, the position became purely ceremonial and the individual was charged with serving the Grand Duke at the table only during feasts. It was the sons of Lithuanian nobility that began their service in the ruler&#x27;s court who were assigned the role of the Stolnik . Between the 16th and 18th centuries, the Stolnik came from various families such as Alšėniškiai, Kęsgaila, , Hlebavičiai, Chodkiewicz, Radziwiłł, Sapieha and others. Stanisław August Poniatowski was the Stolnik of Lithuania from 1755 to 1764, while the last one from 1764 to 1795 was Józef Klemens Czartoryski.

There were two types of Stolnik in Lithuania:

* Grand Stolnik of Lithuania (; )
* Stolnik of Lithuania (; )

According to the 1768 district office hierarchy of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Stolnik was superior to &quot;podstoli&quot; and inferior to &quot;wojski&quot;.

==Stolnik in Russia==

&quot;Stolniks&quot; were known as palace servants of the Russian rulers since the 13th century. In the 16th and 17th centuries they were young nobles who brought dishes to the tsar&#x27;s table, looked after his bedroom, and accompanied him in travels. The highest category comprised the &quot;room&quot; or &quot;closer stolniks&quot;. 

&quot;Stolniks&quot; could simultaneously serve in the foreign office or in the army. They were ranked fifth in the hierarchy of Russian bureaucracy, after &quot;boyars&quot;, &quot;okolnichys&quot;, duma nobles, and duma &quot;dyaks&quot;.

&quot;Stolniks&quot; were also attached to episcopal administrations as were other similar offices also found in the grand princely or tsarist administration. For example, &quot;stolniks&quot; are found in documents from the archiepiscopal records in Veliky Novgorod.

<doc id="1342579" wikidata="Q1184899" url="?curid=1342579" title="Pepper Coast">
<text>The Pepper Coast or Grain Coast was a coastal area of western Africa, between Cape Mesurado and Cape Palmas. It encloses the present republic of Liberia. The name was given by European traders.

==Origin of the name==
The Pepper Coast got its name from the availability in the region of the melegueta pepper (&quot;Aframomum melegueta&quot;), also known as the &quot;grain of paradise&quot;, which in turn gave rise to an alternative name, the Grain Coast. The importance of the spice is shown by the designation of the area from the Saint John River (at present-day Buchanan) to Harper in Liberia as the &quot;Grain Coast&quot;, in reference to the availability of grains of paradise. In some cases (as shown on the map pictured above), this term covers a wider area incorporating Sierra Leone and the Ivory Coast.

<doc id="1342585" wikidata="Q4860564" url="?curid=1342585" title="Bargeddie">
<text>Bargeddie (; ) is a village in North Lanarkshire, Scotland, just inside the suburban fringe of Glasgow, east of the city centre, and close to the junction of the M73 and M8 motorways. The nearest major town is Coatbridge, to the east.

==History==
There was no village of Bargeddie before the 1930s when Lanark County Council built a housing estate at Dykehead. Before that the area consisted of a cluster of hamlets and villages such as Bartonshill, Braehead, and Dykehead, populated in the main by coal miners. In the 1950s, another housing estate was built around the site of Bargeddie House which was demolished after World War II. Bargeddie grew further as part of the overall Glasgow area expansion with the addition of the Drumpellier Lawns, Burnside View and The Fairways housing developments.

==Present day==
Bargeddie is now populated by 3,210 people. The village has two primary schools; Bargeddie Primary School and St. Kevins Primary School.

The Safety Zone is a well established and popular community project run by Elutheria Ltd, a group consisting of local volunteers. The centre offers activities for all ages from babies to elderly people and all stages in between. There are three shops in Bargeddie one at the front of the village, middle and back and a Community Centre which is locally known as &quot;The Windsor&quot; that also sits in Bargeddie. Just before coming to Coatbridge, there is a Showcase Complex which includes of Hollywood Bowl and Showcase Cinema.

==Transport==
The town is served by Bargeddie railway station. There are also bus stops which allow villagers to travel to Glasgow and Coatbridge. Bargeddie is served by three bus routes, one of which goes to Glasgow city centre, the 2. There is also a bus that stops at Bargeddie that can take villagers to Edinburgh. As of 2016 there is a bus run by McGill&#x27;s Bus Services, that takes local villagers around the village and up to Coatbridge and Airdrie.

==Sport==
The most successful club within the village is Bargeddie Carpet Bowling Club, which has run on Tuesday evenings since 1981. The club was based in the Windsor Hall(now demolished), an old miners&#x27; welfare hall, now controlled by North Lanarkshire Council. The hall celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2008 with a party organised by Bargeddie Forward.

Former Scottish football player and Arsenal manager George Graham was born in Bargeddie. Football remains an important part of life in the area. Bargeddie United Amateur Football Club was well known in the Glasgow area but no longer has an adult team and has been without a home pitch since their previous one, Bargeddie Pavilion, was destroyed by a fire in 2010. The club hasnt had any success since Baldy Steven McGuinness&#x27; squad won the Lanarkshire League

In 2009 &quot;Bargeddie Colts&quot; youth football team were reformed. By end of 2011 over 90 children between 5–12 years old were playing football in the &quot;Monklands Soccer Sevens&quot; leagues and the club had achieved SFA Quality Mark &quot;Standard Award&quot;.

==Places of worship==
* Bargeddie Parish Church is situated on Barton&#x27;s Hill, a 10-minute walk from the village. 
* United Free Church is located on Langmuir Road. 
* Saint Kevin&#x27;s Catholic Church is located on Mainhill Road.

<doc id="1342594" wikidata="Q3306732" url="?curid=1342594" title="Business alliance">
<text>A business alliance is an agreement between businesses, usually motivated by cost reduction and improved service for the customer. Alliances are often bounded by a single agreement with equitable risk and opportunity share for all parties involved and are typically managed by an integrated project team. An example of this is code sharing in airline alliances.

==Types==
There are five basic categories or types of alliances:

*Sales: A sales alliance occurs when two companies agree to go to market together to sell complementary products and services. 
*Solution-specific: A solution-specific alliance occurs when two companies agree to jointly develop and sell a specific marketplace solution. 
*Geographic-specific: A geographic-specific alliance is developed when two companies agree to jointly market or co-brand their products and services in a specific geographic region.
*Investment: An investment alliance occurs when two companies agree to join their funds for mutual investment. 
*Joint venture: A joint venture is an alliance that occurs when two or more companies agree to undertake economic activity together.

In many cases, alliances between companies can involve two or more categories or types of alliances.

== Horizontal alliances ==

A type of an alliance is a horizontal alliance. For example, a horizontal alliance can occur between logistics service providers, i.e., the cooperation between two or more logistics companies that are potentially competing. In a horizontal alliance, these partners can benefit twofold. On one hand, they can &quot;access tangible resources which are directly exploitable.&quot; In this example extending common transportation networks, their warehouse infrastructure and the ability to provide more complex service packages can be achieved by combining resources. On the other hand, partners can &quot;access intangible resources, which are not directly exploitable.&quot; This typically includes know-how and information and, in turn, innovation.

== Governance ==
Any alliance is susceptible to failures due to not achieving either cooperation or coordination, or both. Such inefficiencies originate from two well-known limitations in human nature, that are opportunism and bounded rationality. To enhance the success rate of alliances calls for proper levels of governance efforts. Contracts and relational norms are the two most commonly used governance mechanisms by business actors. They can also impact how business actors handle conflicts during the course of the focal collaboration as well as extend the current alliance to future collaborative relationships. Contractual and relational governance mechanisms have complex interactions, with one influencing the other&#x27;s use and effectiveness in their different dimensions.

<text>Podskarbi in the Kingdom of Poland and later in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was minister responsible for the treasury. Since 1569 also a senatorial office. The title although meaning treasurer can be deconstructed as &quot;under[King]-treasury&quot; – treasury as an old-fashioned adjective. One other title was formed in the same way: &quot;podkomorzy&quot; – not meaning vice.

Following treasury offices where among 14 most important national ministers:
* Podskarbi wielki [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|koronny]] – Grand Treasurer of the Crown (till 15th century called Podskarbi koronny – Treasurer of the Crown) was the highest ranking treasurer.
* Podskarbi wielki litewski – Grand Treasurer of Lithuania
* Podskarbi nadworny [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|koronny]] – Court Treasurer of the Crown
* Podskarbi nadworny litewski – Court Treasurer of Lithuania

Lesser treasurers:
* Podskarbi nadworny – Court Treasurer
* Podskarbi Prus – Treasurer of Prussia
* Podskarbi ziemski – District Treasurer

During the rule of King Casimir III the Great, the treasury was managed by Podskarbi of the Kingdom, called &quot;Podskarbi koronny&quot; (Treasurer of the Crown).

Since the second half of the 15th century Podskarbi koronny was called &quot;Podskarbi wielki koronny&quot; (Grand Treasurer of the Crown) his substitute became the &quot;Podskarbi nadworny&quot; (Court Treasurer).

After the decentralisation of the treasury in 1590, Podskarbi koronny was responsible for the treasury of the state and Podskarbi nadworny for the treasury of the king.

In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania the office of &quot;Podskarbi ziemski&quot; (District Treasurer) changed in 1569 in a senatorial office and since then called &quot;Podskarbi wielki litewski&quot; (Grand Treasurer of Lithuania). There are also existed the office of &quot;Podskarbi nadworny litewski&quot; (Court Treasurer of Lithuania), since the 18th century his responsibility was taken over by Kustosz koronny. The office of Podskarbi in Royal Prussia was called &quot;Podskarbi Prus&quot; (Treasurer of Prussia).

The office of Podskarbi nadworny changed in 1791 in the office of Minister of the Treasury.

<text>Horatio Gouverneur Wright (March 6, 1820 – July 2, 1899) was an engineer and general in the Union Army during the American Civil War. He took command of the VI Corps in May 1864 following the death of General John Sedgwick. In this capacity, he was responsible for building the fortifications around Washington DC, and in the Overland Campaign he commanded the first troops to break through the Confederate defenses at Petersburg. After the war, he was involved in a number of engineering projects, including the Brooklyn Bridge and the completion of the Washington Monument, and served as Chief of Engineers for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

==Early life==
Wright was born in Clinton, Connecticut, son of Edward and Nancy Wright. When he was 14 he entered Alden Partridge&#x27;s military academy in Vermont (now Norwich University). In 1837 he entered West Point and graduated second in his class of 52 from the United States Military Academy in 1841 with a commission in the engineers. He taught engineering and French at West Point over the next several years. He was sent to Florida in 1846, where he spent ten years working on the harbor of St. Augustine and the defenses of Key West, including Fort Jefferson. In 1855, he was promoted to the rank of captain and served as assistant to Chief of Engineers Colonel Joseph G. Totten the following year. During this time, he was appointed as a member of a military committee to study iron carriages for the construction of naval guns and ordnance specifications of the 15-inch gun. He later co-wrote &quot;Report on Fabrication of Iron for Defenses&quot; (published in 1871–72) based on his time on the board.

==Civil War service==
After the start of the war, Wright took part in the evacuation and destruction of the Gosport Navy Yard (later named the Norfolk Navy Yard) on April 20, 1861, to prevent its exploitation by Confederate forces. He was captured during this action, but was released four days later as Virginia had not yet joined the Confederacy and therefore wasn&#x27;t at war with the United States.

Wright began constructing fortifications around Washington, D.C., before being assigned to the 3rd Division of the Department of Northeast Virginia under Maj. Gen. Samuel P. Heintzelman. Serving as chief engineer of the 3rd Division during the First Battle of Bull Run on July 21, 1861, Wright was promoted to major in August. Promoted to brigadier general of volunteers the following month, Wright was assigned as chief engineer to Maj. Gen. Thomas W. Sherman&#x27;s November 1861 expedition against Port Royal, South Carolina. His successes while commanding Union troops in operations against Jacksonville, St. Augustine, and other military targets on the Florida coast from February to June 1862 led to his appointment as major general of volunteers and commander of the Department of the Ohio in August 1862, and commander of the newly created Army of the Ohio in March 1863. In this command he played a major logistical role in the repulse of Confederate General Braxton Bragg&#x27;s invasion of Kentucky in 1862. His appointment as major general was not confirmed by the Senate and was revoked in March 1863. As a brigadier general, he was not considered eligible to command a department and Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside was sent to relieve him. Reporting to Burnside, Wright remained briefly as the commander of the District of Western Kentucky before returning to the East.
In May 1863, Wright was given command of the 1st Division in the VI Corps of the Army of the Potomac under Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick. His first battle in division command was Gettysburg in July 1863, where his corps was held in reserve. The corps saw action at Mine Run in November 1863, and the Battle of the Wilderness on May 5 to May 6, 1864. After General Sedgwick&#x27;s death at Spotsylvania Court House on May 9, Wright assumed command of the VI Corps, receiving promotion as major general of volunteers (confirmed by the Senate this time) and brevet colonel in the regular army on May 12, 1864.

Wright&#x27;s corps fought at Cold Harbor from June 3 to June 12, 1864. In the Valley Campaigns of 1864, he was dispatched to Washington, D.C., to defend against Confederate Lt. Gen. Jubal Early&#x27;s raid on July 11 and July 12, 1864, commanding the Washington Emergency Defense Force, consisting of the VI, VIII, and XIX Corps. During the defense of Fort Stevens, he gained notoriety by inviting President Abraham Lincoln to join him on a parapet exposed to enemy fire. (A young staff officer, Oliver Wendell Holmes, is often said to be responsible for yelling at the president to get under cover. In George Thomas Stevens&#x27;s post-war (1870) history of the VI Corps, Wright related to Thomas that he himself was the person who shouted at the president to get down.

Wright commanded the VI Corps again during Maj. Gen. Philip H. Sheridan&#x27;s Shenandoah Valley campaign from August 6 to October 16, 1864. Wright directed fighting at Cedar Creek on October 19 before General Sheridan&#x27;s arrival.

In the Siege of Petersburg, the VI Corps was the first unit to break through the Confederate defenses, on April 2, 1865. Subsequently, operating under the command of Sheridan, it defeated Confederate forces at Sayler&#x27;s Creek on April 6, 1865, resulting in the capture of a large number of Confederate soldiers, including Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell and Major General G. W. Custis Lee, son of Robert E. Lee. For Wright&#x27;s actions at Petersburg he was promoted to a brevet major general in the regular army.

==Postbellum==

During Reconstruction, Wright commanded the Army of Texas from July 1865 to August 1866. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel of engineers in November, before leaving volunteer service in September 1866. He was involved in a number of engineering projects including the Brooklyn Bridge and the completion of the Washington Monument. Promoted to colonel in March 1879, Wright was later named Chief of Engineers as a brigadier general in June 1879. He retired at that rank on March 6, 1884, and lived in Washington, D.C., until his death in 1899. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington, Virginia under an obelisk erected by veterans of the VI Corps, facing the Washington Monument he completed.

The city of Fort Wright, Kentucky, is named for an earthwork structure (named for Wright) that was planned during the Confederate invasion of Kentucky in the summer of 1862 while Wright was in command of the Department of the Ohio. Designed to be a five-sided fortification, it was never completed. The earthwork was destroyed in the 1880s by road construction.

Fort H. G. Wright on the western tip of Fishers Island, New York, is also named in his honor.

<doc id="1342609" wikidata="Q1143892" url="?curid=1342609" title="Maruoka Castle">
<text>is a &quot;hirayama&quot;-style Japanese castle located in the Maruoka neighbourhood of the city of Sakai, Fukui Prefecture, in the Hokuriku region of Japan. It also called due to the legend that whenever an enemy approaches the castle, a thick mist appears and hides it. 
Built at the end of the Sengoku period, the castle was occupied by a succession of &quot;daimyō&quot; of Maruoka Domain under the Edo period Tokugawa shogunate. The site is now a public park noted for its sakura. 
The castle&#x27;s relatively small &quot;tenshu&quot; (castle keep) claims to be the oldest in the country, a claim which is challenged by both Inuyama Castle and Matsumoto Castle.

==Background==
Maruoka Castle is located on top of a small hill in the plains north of the city of Fukui. The area around the foot of the hill was levelled, and protected by ramparts and a pentagonal-shaped moat. The castle is located on the Hokurikudō highway connecting Kaga Province with Echizen Province, at the juncture of the Mino Kaidō highway connecting inland Mino Province with the Sea of Japan.

==History==
===Construction===
Maruoka Castle is considered to have been constructed in 1576 by Shibata Katsutoyo, who was the nephew and adopted son of Shibata Katsuie, one of Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s leading generals.

According to the legend of &quot;O-shizu, Hitobashira&quot; the castle was constructed with a human pillar. During construction the stone base of the &quot;tenshu&quot; kept collapsing no matter how many times it was piled up. There was one vassal who suggested that they should make someone a human sacrifice (hitobashira) to appease the gods. O-shizu, a one-eyed woman who had two children and lived a poor life, was selected as the Hitobashira. She resolved to become one on the condition that one of her children was taken in by Katsutoyo and made a samurai. Standing in position the base stones were positioned around her, until they eventually crushed her to death. Her sacrifice allowed the construction to be successfully completed.

Katsutoyo was however unable to fulfil his promise to O-shizu before he moved to another province. Resentful that her son had not been made a samurai her spirit according to legend would make the moat overflow with spring rain when the season of cutting algae came in April every year. People called it, &quot;the rain caused by the tears of O-shizu&#x27;s sorrow&quot; and erected a small tomb to soothe her spirit. There was a poem handed down, &quot;The rain which falls when the season of cutting algae comes Is the rain reminiscent of the tears of the poor O-shizu&#x27;s sorrow&quot;.
Although built in the Momoyama period (1575-1600) the design is more indicative of earlier fortresses of the Warring States period (1477-1575) . As it was being sited on top of a low hill it was decided to mount the &quot;tenshu&quot; on a high stone base in order to gain additional height. However at the time successful techniques of constructing such a steep faced base were still in their infancy, especially when using rough uncut stones (known as &quot;nozurazumi&quot;) in a steeply inclined base as adopted at Maruoka. This random-style piling of stones is suggested as the source of the instability in the walls during the construction period.

===Tokugawa shogunate===
After Shibata Katsutoyo died of illness during the Battle of Shizugatake in 1583, the castle was given to the Aoyama clan. However, the Aoyama sided with the Western Army under Ishida Mitsunari during the Battle of Sekigahara and were thus dispossessed by the victorious Tokugawa Ieyasu. Ieyasu awarded Echizen Province to his son, Yūki Hideyasu, who in turn created a 26,000 &quot;koku&quot; holding centered at Maruoka for his retainer, Imamura Moritsugu. In 1613, due to an &quot;O-Ie Sōdō&quot; within Fukui Domain, the Tokugawa shogunate raised Maruoka Domain to 40,000 &quot;koku&quot; and assigned it to Honda Narishige, the son of Honda Shigetsugu, one of Ieyasu&#x27;s leading generals. Due to Honda Narishige&#x27;s efforts at the Siege of Osaka in 1624, the &quot;kokudaka&quot; of the domain was further raised to 46,300 &quot;koku&quot;. His son and grandson completed the castle and the surrounding &quot;jōkamachi&quot;. However, his great-grandson, Honda Shigemasu was an alcoholic and incompetent, and was dispossessed by the shogunate in 1695. The Honda were replaced by Arima Kiyosumi, a descendant of the &quot;Kirishitan&quot; &quot;daimyō&quot; Arima Harunobu. The Arima clan continued to rule Maruoka for eighth generations until the abolition of the han system in July 1871 during the Meiji Restoration.

===Meiji restoration===
After the Meiji restoration, almost all Japanese castles keeps and many other castle buildings around the country were demolished. In the case of Maruoka while many of the castle buildings were demolished and various gates, stone walls, and trees were sold off, the &quot;tenshu&quot; and castle grounds was purchased in 1901 by the town of Maruoka and became a park. The pentagonal moat surrounding the castle was gradually filled in and partly built between the late Taishō era to the early Shōwa era.

The &quot;tenshu&quot; was registered as a national treasure on 30 January 1934.

The &quot;tenshu&quot; collapsed due to the destruction of its stone base during the 1948 Fukui earthquake. In 1955 the base was rebuilt using 70% of the original pillars and about 60% of the original beams by installing a reinforced concrete frame and piling the original stones around it before re-erecting the &quot;tenshu&quot; on top. At that time, the structure of the windows on the top floor was changed from sliding doors to push-up windows.

The castle was designated an Important Cultural Property in 1950. A number of the castle gates also survive in private hands, including one at the temple of Kōzen-ji in Komatsu, Ishikawa and one at the temple of Renshō-ji in the city of Awara, Fukui.

===Investigations into its construction date===
The Maruoka Castle Research and Research Committee led by (Junichi Yoshida from the Fukui University of Technology) was commissioned by the Board of Education of Sakai City to survey the castle. By dating the timber used in the construction of the &quot;tenshu&quot; from its rings, radiocarbon concentration, and oxygen isotope ratio, they reported after four years of investigations in March 2019 that most of the through pillars, which play a structurally important role, were cut down after 1626. Confusing matters was the observation that the architectural style of Maruoka&#x27;s &quot;tenshu&quot; was considered outdated by the 1620s. This would indicate that if it had been built in 1576 by Shibata Katsutoyo as generally assumed, it would have been heavily reconstructed in the latter half of the 1620s (mostly likely in 1628) by the Honda clan following Honda Narishige being assigned ownership of the castle in 1613.

In October 2019 the northeast exterior wall of the tenshu was damaged by an typhoon and were subsequently repaired by the Tanaka Shrine Co.

==Current status==
Maruoka Castle is one of just twelve castles in Japan which has managed to keep its original &quot;tenshu&quot;.

The former castle grounds are now incorporated in the Kasumigajo Park, which contain some remnants of the ramparts and moats as well as a small museum that displays some arms, armour, and household items related to its former lords. The area is famed for its approximately 400 cherry blossom trees.
An annual cherry blossom festival is held during the first three weeks of April during which the trees are lit up in the evenings by over 300 paper lanterns.

==Description==
Sitting atop a 6.2-metre (20 ft 4 in) high stone platform set among Japanese black pine and cherry trees, access to the &quot;tenshu&quot; is via a long staircase leading directly into its black wooden interior. The &quot;tenshu&quot; has three floors, with uppermost serving as a watchtower.
The &quot;tenshu&quot; has a number of unique design features. While the roof originally had wood shingles at some stage these were replaced with roof tiles made from a local stone called &quot;shakudani&quot;. These stone tiles mean the roof is unusually heavy with a weight of 60 tons which is more than double the weight of a normal tile-roofed or wooden shingle roof. In Japanese. Other sources quote a weight of 120 tons. The reason for using stone tiles believed to have been because they provided superior thermal insulation during the winter. The roof also features stone &quot;shachihako&quot; (fish/tiger) ornaments.
The right-hand side of the &quot;tenshu&quot; has a series of protruding &quot;ishiotoshimado&quot; (stone-dropping windows) that allowed defenders to shoot at enemies via timber slats and also via a trap door to drop stones or pour oil or boiling water on attackers underneath. The &quot;tenshu&quot; also has a hidden floor not apparent from the exterior, but in general both the size of the &quot;tenshu&quot; and its interior are very similar to that of contemporary Inuyama Castle.

<doc id="1342612" wikidata="Q2096912" url="?curid=1342612" title="Suona">
<text>The suona, also called dida, laba or haidi, is a traditional double-reeded Chinese musical instrument. The &quot;suona&#x27;s&quot; basic design originated in ancient Iran, then called &quot;Sorna&quot;. It appeared in China around the 3rd century and it&#x27;s also popular in parts of northern and southern China, including Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Northeast China, Guangdong, Fujian, and other regions. It has a distinctively loud and high-pitched sound, and was used frequently in Chinese traditional music ensembles, particularly in those that perform outdoors. It was an important instrument in the folk music of northern China, particularly in provinces of Shandong and Henan, where it has long been used for festival and military purposes. It is still being used, in combination with sheng mouth organs, gongs, drums, and sometimes other instruments in weddings and funeral processions. Such wind and percussion ensembles are called &quot;chuida&quot; () or &quot;guchui&quot; (; this name refers to the &quot;suona&quot; itself in Taiwanese Hokkien). Stephen Jones has written extensively on its use in ritual music of Shanxi. It was also common in the ritual music of Southeast China. In Chinese culture it was an essential element of ritual music that accompanied Daoist performances of both auspicious and inauspicious rites, i.e., those for both the living and the dead. One of the most famous pieces that uses suona as the leading instrument is called &quot;Bai Niao Chao Feng&quot; (), or &quot;Hundred Birds Worship the Phoenix&quot;. The movie Song of the Phoenix casts the rise and fall of the popularity of suona in modern Chinese musical history. Suona music is filled with tradition and innovation, and is a timeless expression of Chinese folk culture, enriching the daily lives of folk workers. Suona art was approved by the State Council to be included in the first batch of national intangible cultural heritage list on May 20, 2006.

==Construction==
The &quot;suona&quot; as used in China had a conical wooden body, similar to that of the &quot;gyaling&quot; horn used by the Tibetan ethnic group, both of which used a metal, usually a tubular brass or copper bocal to which a small double reed was affixed, and possessed a detachable metal bell at its end. The double-reed gave the instrument a sound similar to that of the modern oboe. The traditional version had seven finger holes. The instrument was made in several sizes. The &quot;suona&quot; has a bright tone, a loud volume, and a wooden tube in a round and cone-shaped shape. The upper end is equipped with a copper tube with a whistle, and the lower end is covered with a copper bell mouth. The &quot;nazi&quot; (), a related instrument that was most commonly used in northern China, consisted of a &quot;suona&quot; reed (with bocal) that was played melodically. The pitches were changed by the mouth and hands.video Sometimes the &quot;nazi&quot; was played into a large metal horn for additional volume. Take apart the tube, whistle, and horn to play, and each can simulate different characters, such as Laosheng, Huadan, and other voices.

=== Modern Construction ===
Since the mid-20th century, &quot;modernized&quot; versions of the &quot;suona&quot; have been developed in China; incorporating mechanical keys similar to those of the European oboe, to allow for the playing of chromatic notes and equal tempered tuning (both of which were difficult to execute on the traditional suona). There is now a family of such instruments, including the &quot;zhongyin suona&quot; (), &quot;cizhongyin suona&quot; (), and &quot;diyin suona&quot; (). These instruments are used in the woodwind sections of modern large Chinese traditional instrument orchestras in China, Taiwan, and Singapore, though most folk ensembles prefer to use the traditional version of the instrument. It is used in modern music arrangements as well, including in the works of Chinese rock musician Cui Jian, featuring a modernized suona-play in his song &quot;Nothing To My Name&quot; (一无所有) played by the saxophonist Liu Yuan. In 1993, the famous wind musician Mr. Guo Yazhi invented the &quot;live core&quot; device for suona, which allowed traditional suona to play a chromatic scale and twelve tone system, enriching the expressive power of suona.

Ranges of the orchestral &quot;suona&quot;:
*Piccolo &quot;suona&quot; in G, F and Eb ()
*Sopranino &quot;suona&quot; in D, C and Bb ()
*Soprano &quot;suona&quot; in A and G ()
*Alto &quot;suona&quot; in F ()
*Tenor &quot;suona&quot; in C ()
*Bass &quot;suona&quot; in various keys (F, Eb etc) ()
*Contrabass &quot;suona&quot;
*Octocontrabass &quot;suona&quot;

The alto, tenor and bass varieties are normally keyed and the soprano varieties are sometimes keyed. The highest varieties are not normally keyed, but there are variants of them – usually in the key of C – that are keyed to assist in the playing of accidentals. The note played when the left hand&#x27;s fingers and right index finger are covering the playing holes is considered the key of the instrument.

=== Use inside China ===
In modern, most of the performances of the &quot;Suona&quot; are performed at funerals, or in national orchestras because the s&quot;uona&quot; has a unique tone, a strong penetrating power, and a strong infectious power. For example, in the classic Suona piece &quot;Bai Niao Chao Feng&quot; (百鸟朝凤), which is performed in orchestra.

=== Influence of &quot;suona&quot; on young people in the 21st century ===
Because of its unique sound, the &quot;suona&quot; has become one of the most popular instruments among young people today, because they can use traditional instruments to perform the modern repertoire. Nowadays, &quot;suona&quot; even appears in band performances, festival performances, music programs, movies, and in any other way, and is widely loved by young people. 
==History==
===Origins===
Although the origin of the &quot;suona&quot; in China is unclear, with some texts dating the use of the &quot;suona&quot; as far back as the Jin dynasty (266–420), there is a consensus that the &quot;suona&quot; originated outside of the domains of ancient Chinese kingdoms, possibly having been developed from Central Asian instruments such as the &quot;sorna&quot; or &quot;zurna&quot;, from which its Chinese name may have been derived. Other sources state the origins of the &quot;suona&quot; were Arabia, or India. A musician playing an instrument very similar to a &quot;suona&quot; was shown on a drawing on a Silk Road religious monument in the western Xinjiang province. It dates to the 3rd or 5th centuries, and depictions dating to this period found in Shandong and other regions of northern China depicted it being played in military processions, sometimes on horseback. It was not mentioned in Chinese literature until the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644), but by this time, the &quot;suona&quot; was already established in northern China. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, it was widely circulated among the people and was mostly used in wind and percussion bands for weddings, funerals, and happy events. It was also used as an accompaniment instrument for folk songs, dances, and operas.

Other instruments related to the &quot;suona&quot; may have also descended from the Asian zurna, such as the European shawm. Other examples include the Korean &quot;taepyeongso&quot;, the Vietnamese &quot;kèn&quot; and the Japanese &quot;charumera&quot; (). The latter&#x27;s name is derived from &quot;charamela&quot;, the Portuguese word for shawm. Its sound was well known throughout Japan, as it is often used today by street vendors selling ramen.

===Use outside China===
The &quot;suona&quot; was used as a traditional instrument by Cubans in Oriente and Havana, having been introduced by Chinese immigrants during the colonial era. Known locally as &quot;corneta china,&quot; it has been one of the lead instruments in the conga carnival music of Santiago de Cuba since 1915. In Havana, the term &quot;trompeta china&quot; () was sometimes used.

In America, the jazz saxophonist Dewey Redman often played the &quot;suona&quot; in his performances, calling it a &quot;musette&quot;. English bassist and saxophonist Mick Karn used the instrument crediting it as a &quot;dida&quot;.

In Central Asia, Egypt, Türkiye, India and other countries, &quot;suona&quot; is very popular. &quot;Suona&quot; from Central Asian countries is also used for red and white celebrations, temple fairs, celebration ceremonies, and so on. 

The same instrument, also called a &quot;musette&quot;, was used in &quot;Oriental Bands&quot; of the Shriner fraternal organization. Dressed in &quot;Arabic&quot; garb with mallet drums, Oriental Bands marched in parades that featured &quot;little cars&quot; driven by members. They wore the Fez (hat). They arrested bystanders, gave them a whisky and let them go. The instrument was not known to be of Chinese origin, just &quot;Oriental&quot;. Dewey Redmond possibly got his soprano &quot;suona&quot; as a former Shriner import. The Shriners even supplied the reeds (which are a constant issue because every reed is different).

== Playing style ==
There are many different ways to play the &quot;suona&quot;, as each region&#x27;s &quot;suona&quot; will be different. Modern improvements have even changed the way it is made, adding keys to enhance the range and stability of the &quot;suona&quot;.

The most important aspect of the &quot;suona&quot; playing style is the breathing method, and there are currently six ways to play it:

* Circular breathing method
* Air trill
* Tooth trill
* Finger trill
* Small-arm trill
* Tongue trill

==Notable performers==
*Liu Qi-Chao ()
*Liu Yuan (), saxophonist with Cui Jian&#x27;s band, who trained on the &quot;suona&quot; at the Beijing Art School (), and who used the instrument on Cui&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Hongqi xia de dan&quot; ()
*Liu Ying (), pioneer of Liu-style &quot;suona&quot; art

== Repertoire of the &quot;suona&quot; ==

* “Quan Jia Fu&quot;（全家福）
* “Tai Hua Jiao”（抬花轎）
* “Liu Zi Kai Men”（六字開門）
* “Yi Zhi Hua”（一枝花）
* “Feng Yang Ge Jiao Ba Ban”（鳳陽歌絞八板 ）

<text>A Bronx Morning is a 1931 American Pre-Code avant-garde film by American filmmaker Jay Leyda (1910–1988).

In 2004, &quot;A Bronx Morning&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

== Synopsis ==
Described as &quot;city symphony&quot;, the eleven-minute European style film recorded a Bronx street in New York City before it is crowded with traffic. As opposed to the other films classified under the “city symphony” tradition, &quot;A Bronx Morning&quot; focuses on one borough in New York City at one specific time of day, rather than the entire city throughout all times of day. Captured only during the morning, the film makes an effort to track specific visual motifs that crop up as these average citizens begin to go about their days. The repetition of these visuals is organized and spliced together—such as the movement of shadows projected against the concrete streets.

== Production ==
In 1931, Leyda purchased an Eyemo camera, on which he shot &quot;A Bronx Morning.&quot; The film was funded with the proceeds of a sale of a wooden figurine of Henry Ward Beecher, which Leyda had originally found in a junk shop, to a representative of Abby Aldrich Rockefeller.

== Historical context ==
Leyda produced &quot;A Bronx Morning&quot; as a silent film despite the advent of &quot;talkies&quot; heralded by &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; four years before. The limited capabilities of sound-recording technology restricted the artistic freedom of the makers of early sound films, often tying them to static, tripod-mounted cameras on soundstages, at the expense of techniques developed during the silent era. Film theorists of the time criticized &quot;talkies&quot; accordingly, as a step backward for visual storytelling. Leyda’s 1931 film, by contrast, uses techniques that sound films could not; &quot;A Bronx Morning&quot; takes place entirely on location and heavily incorporates camera movement into its visual style.

== Impact on Leyda&#x27;s career ==
&quot;A Bronx Morning&quot; was Jay Leyda&#x27;s first film. He had moved to New York City in 1930 in pursuit of a career in photography. He first worked as a darkroom assistant, as well as an assistant on Ralph Steiner’s experimental films. As his career progressed, he began publishing photographic portraits in New York’s &quot;Arts Weekly&quot; magazine and exhibiting portraits at the Julien Levy Gallery. Largely unnoticed in the United States, &quot;A Bronx Morning&quot; led to Leyda&#x27;s acceptance into the Moscow State Film School where he studied under Soviet filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein. Leyda was the only American ever to receive such an invitation. In Moscow, Leyda also worked alongside Dziga Vertov and Joris Ivens. Leyda went on to work as editor and advisor on &quot;People of the Cumberland&quot; and &quot;China Strikes Back&quot;. In 1974 Leyda worked as the Gottesman Professor of Cinema Studies at the New York University School of the Arts. He died in New York City on February 15, 1988.

<text>The Battle of Olszynka Grochowska, or the battle of Grochów, was fought on 25 February 1831 in the woods near Grochów, on the eastern outskirts of Warsaw. The Polish army, commanded by Józef Chłopicki, succeeded in preventing its Russian counterpart, under Hans Karl von Diebitsch, from crushing the uprising. However, the battle has also been described as an inconclusive bloodbath.

== Prelude ==
The first months after the outbreak of the November Uprising saw no hostilities between Poland and Russia. Both the Polish commander Józef Chłopicki and Russian Tsar Nicholas I were hoping for a peaceful solution to the conflict. However, neither side could propose a satisfactory compromise, and on 25 January 1831 Nicholas was deposed from the Polish throne.

This was seen as a de facto declaration of war and the Russian Army under Hans Karl von Diebitsch was ordered to enter Poland and crush the rebellion. The Russian army entered Poland on 4 February and started a fast advance towards Warsaw. Despite several minor battles and skirmishes, in which the Russian army suffered significant losses, the advance could not be stopped by the Polish forces, which were both numerically and technically inferior.

On 24 February the Russian Army reached the outskirts of Warsaw in two columns. Initially Diebitsch was planning an all-out assault on Warsaw on 26 February. However, the successful Polish counter-attack in the Battle of Białołęka, in which the 13,500 men strong Corps of General Ivan Shakhovskoy was defeated and forced to retreat, made Diebitsch change his plans and attack earlier than planned.

== Armies ==
The Polish forces deployed to the east of Warsaw constituted the majority of the Polish Army. Apart from the II Infantry Brigade under General Kazimierz Małachowski, dispatched to the north to take part in the Battle of Białołęka, the forces of General Józef Chłopicki included some 36,000 soldiers and 115 cannon of various calibres. The majority of the Polish forces was composed of fresh, poorly trained and ill-equipped volunteers. However, the core of the Polish Army was composed of Napoleonic Wars veterans.

The Russian forces had some 59,000 men under arms and 178 cannon. In addition, at 15:00 the weakened corps of General Shakhovskiy arrived at the battlefield and took part in the assault. The forces of Field Marshal Diebitsch were organised into five Infantry Corps, with some cavalry units attached to them. However, the main part of the Russian cavalry was defeated in the Battle of Stoczek and did not enter the combat.

== Battle ==
The Polish counter-attack in the area of Białołęka on 24 February surprised the Russians. In the early morning of 25 February, after both units taking part in the Battle of Białołęka were on the verge of breaking after a night-long city fight, the Poles threw in the reserve 1st Infantry Division under General Jan Krukowiecki. The Russians started a retreat and the Poles started a pursuit, but the Polish advance was halted after an hour.

The sound of the nearby battle made Field Marshal Diebitsch (Dibich-Zabalkansky) change his plans and order an assault on Polish positions 24 hours earlier than planned. At noon the I Corps and the Corps of General Grigoriy Vladimirovich Rosen were ordered to assault the Polish 2nd and 3rd Infantry Divisions (Generals Skrzynecki and Żymirski, respectively) in the woods east of Grochów. At the same time the Corps of General Pahlen was ordered to outflank the Poles from the south and strike through the lines of the Polish 4th Infantry Division of General Szembek.

Although the Russians had numerical superiority and better equipment on their side, the Polish lines were well-hidden in the woods and the Russian artillery had difficulties supporting the advancing infantry. Rockets designed by Józef Bem also helped disrupt Russian cavalry charges. Despite numerous assaults, both the woods and the Grochów-Gocławek road were still in Polish hands at dusk. After suffering heavy casualties, the Russians withdrew from the battlefield. However, the Poles had also lost a large part of their forces and were unable to organise a successful pursuit.

== Aftermath ==
In the course of a day-long struggle the Russians lost at least 9,500 killed and wounded, and were forced to abandon their plans of capturing Warsaw and ending the Polish uprising with one blow. Polish losses were slightly fewer, but also significant: between 6,900 and 7,300 dead and wounded. However, Chłopicki did not start a pursuit after the fleeing Russians and did not take advantage of the success.

Because of this, the battle is described as a marginal Polish victory in most handbooks and monographs, both modern and contemporary. Some authors argue that, although the Russian forces were badly beaten and forced to retreat and abandon their plans of capturing Warsaw, the lack of Polish pursuit resulted in the battle being either a Pyrrhic victory, a marginal victory, or simply an inconclusive bloodbath. Finally, several Russian sources claim that the result of the battle was a Russian victory.

<text>Ethan Allen Hitchcock (September 19, 1835 – April 9, 1909) served under Presidents William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt as U.S. Secretary of the Interior.

==Business career==
Hitchcock was born on September 19, 1835, in Mobile, Alabama, the son of Henry Hitchcock (1791–1839), a justice on the Alabama Supreme Court, and Anne Erwin Hitchcock. He was the brother of Henry Hitchcock, nephew of Major General Ethan Allen Hitchcock, grandson of Judge Samuel Hitchcock, and great-grandson of Ethan Allen.

He was in mercantile business at Saint Louis, Missouri, 1855–60, then went to China to enter a commission house, of which firm he became a partner in 1866. He was married to Margaret Dwight Collier on March 20, 1869. Ethan and Margaret Hitchcock had three daughters, Sarah, Anne and Margaret Hitchcock.

In 1872 he retired from business, in 1874 returned to the United States, and in 1874-97 was president of several manufacturing, mining and railway companies.

He was a member of the Missouri Society of the Sons of the Revolution.

==Government career==
Hitchcock was in his sixties when President McKinley appointed him Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Russia in 1897 and in February 1898 Ambassador Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, the first Ambassador accredited from the United States to the court of Russia. He was recalled in 1898 to serve in first McKinley&#x27;s and then his successor, Roosevelt&#x27;s, Cabinet. As Secretary of the Interior, Hitchcock pursued a vigorous program for the conservation of natural resources and reorganized the administration of Native American affairs.

Hitchcock died April 9, 1909, in Washington, D.C., at the age of 73. Hitchcock was buried at the Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri.

<text>Snap, Crackle and Pop are the cartoon mascots of Rice Krispies, a brand of breakfast cereal marketed by Kellogg&#x27;s and its successor companies.

==History==
The characters were originally designed by illustrator Vernon Grant in the early 1930s. The names are onomatopoeia and were derived from a Rice Krispies radio ad:
The first character appeared on the product&#x27;s packaging in 1933. Grant added two more and named the trio Snap, Crackle and Pop. Snap is usually portrayed wearing a chef&#x27;s toque. Crackle often is shown wearing a red (or striped) tomte&#x27;s tuque or &quot;sleeping cap&quot;, and Pop often wears a drum major&#x27;s shako, but is sometimes also seen with a chef&#x27;s toque, or an odd combination of both a shako and a toque. Corporate promotional material describes their relationship as resembling that of brothers. Snap is the oldest and is known as a problem solver, Crackle is an unsure &quot;middle child&quot; and known as a jokester, and Pop is a mischievous yet also clumsy youngster and the center of attention. There was briefly a fourth gnome in the 1950s named Pow who represented the claimed explosive nutritional value of Rice Krispies.
From their original design as elderly gnomes with large noses, ears and hats, Snap, Crackle and Pop were reimagined with younger and more proportional features in 1949. Some time after 1955, their elf-like oversized ears became more proportional yet pointed, as seen in common portrayals of elves. They first appeared as animated characters in 1955, targeted toward such children&#x27;s shows as &quot;The Howdy Doody Show&quot;. The voices of the original gnomes were provided by Daws Butler, Paul Winchell and Don Messick. More recent voices have included Keith Chegwin, Chad Doreck, Eddie Deezen, Thom Adcox-Hernandez, Mona Marshall, Phil Vischer, Mike Nawrocki, and Dino Andrade. As of 2009, the three gnomes are voiced by Andy Hirsch (Snap), Danny Cooksey (Crackle) and Mark Ballou (Pop). As of 2017, the three gnomes are now voiced by Josh Brener (Snap), Ben Schwartz (Crackle) and Tom Kenny (Pop).

The trio were used in conservation messages during World War II and briefly re-imagined as superheroes in the early 1990s, but later returned to their original gnome/elf-like form. In the 1950s – 1970&#x27;s the characters were drawn by illustrator, Pete Eaton of Eaton and Iwen Art for Advertising. 
Leo Burnett Worldwide assigned Chicago-based cartoonist Don Margolis to do Snap, Crackle and Pop for the Rice Krispies boxes as well as other applications. Davidson Marketing also used him for their Rice Krispies assignments. Don did the three gnomes until the end of 1998.

On 17 June 2020, former UK Labour politician Fiona Onasanya questioned why popular breakfast cereal Coco Pops was promoted with a monkey, while Rice Krispies used the white-skinned Snap, Crackle and Pop.

The original advertising jingle, &quot;Snap, Crackle, Pop&quot;, was written by Nick Winkless under the banner of Leo Burnett Worldwide. The lead sheet sent by Kellogg&#x27;s lists the singers&#x27; names as Len, Hazel, and Joe. Nick&#x27;s daughter said Nick&#x27;s influence for the 3-part round was Fugue for Tinhorns from Guys and Dolls.

==Physics==

In physics, the terms &quot;snap&quot;, &quot;crackle&quot; and &quot;pop&quot; are sometimes used to describe the fourth, fifth and sixth time derivatives of position respectively. The first derivative of position with respect to time is velocity, the second is acceleration, and the third is jerk.

<text>Starosta or starost (Cyrillic: &quot;старост/а&quot;, Latin: &quot;capitaneus&quot;, ) is a community elder in some Slavic lands. 

The Slavic root of &quot;starost&quot; translates as &quot;senior&quot;. Since the Middle Ages, it has designated an official in a leadership position in a range of civic and social contexts throughout Central and Eastern Europe. In reference to a municipality, a &quot;starosta&quot; was historically a senior royal administrative official, equivalent to a county sheriff or seneschal, and analogous to a &quot;gubernator&quot;. In Poland, a &quot;starosta&quot; administered crown territory or a district called a &quot;starostwo&quot;.

In the early Middle Ages, a &quot;starosta&quot; could head a settled urban or rural community or other community, as in the case of a church starosta or an &quot;artel&quot; starosta. A starosta also functioned as a master of ceremonies.

==Czech Republic and Slovakia==
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia &quot;starosta&quot; is the title of a mayor of a town or village. Mayors of major cities use the title &quot;primátor&quot;. The term corresponds to the Austrian or German Bürgermeister.

==Holy Roman Empire==
Historically, the title &quot;Starost&quot; was also used in parts of the Holy Roman Empire. The German word &quot;Starostei&quot; referred to the office or crown land district of a Starost. In German, the title starost/starosta is also translated as &quot;Hauptmann&quot; and analogous to a gubernator.

==Poland==
===Kingdom of Poland===

In the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Starosta was from the 15th century the office of a territorial administrator, usually conferred on a local landowner and member of the nobility, &quot;Szlachta&quot;. Until the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, there were two types of Starosta:
*Castle Starosta, (formerly Castellan or &quot;capitaneus cum iurisdictione&quot;), &quot;Starosta grodowy&quot; as local representative of the king, would supervise fiscal, judicial administration and matters of crime in a district, termed &quot;starostwo&quot;, and
*Land-Starosta, &quot;Starosta niegrodowy&quot;, &quot;capitaneus sine iurisdictione&quot;, whose role (they were invariably male) was as overseer of crown land tenants and of the land tenure (see tenant-in-chief) without any real obligations. The absence of an Interdict against the accumulation of thus administered districts resulted in some nobles becoming immensely rich and earning the sobriquet, &quot;magnates&quot;.

There were also &quot;general starosts&quot; who were provincial governors. All starosts disappeared after the Kosciuszko Insurrection in 1794 and were not reinstated until after World War I when their role was altered.

===Contemporary===
In contemporary Poland, &quot;starosta&quot; designates a district administrator, who heads the district administration &quot;starostwo&quot; and manages a &quot;powiat&quot; district, akin to the leader of a town or rural council.

== Ukraine ==

=== Revolutionary period ===
In the Ukrainian State during 1918, gubernatorial and povitian starostas controlled who represented the central government in regions.

=== Contemporary ===
In 2014–2015, administrative and territorial reform began in Ukraine, during which adjacent territorial communities began to unite into larger amalgamated territorial hromadas. In order for the interests of residents of all villages, towns and cities in united territorial communities to be properly represented, the law &quot;On Voluntary Unification of Territorial Communities&quot; adopted on February 5, 2015, introduced the institute of starosta, who were to be elected by residents of the respective settlements and represent their interests in the executive bodies of the council of the amalgamated territorial hromada.

The mayor, in particular, is a member of the executive committee of the amalgamated territorial hromada council ex officio, he must help the residents of his settlements with the preparation of submitting documents to local self-government bodies, participate in the preparation of the amalgamated territorial hromada budget in the part that concerns his settlements, and also perform other duties specified in Regulations on the starosta, which were approved by the council of the amalgamated territorial hromada. In particular, the council of the amalgamated territorial hromada could authorize the starosta to perform notarial acts on his own, or to transfer relevant documents from residents to the executive body of the council and back.

By the decree of the Cabinet of Ministers dated July 22, 2016, the starosta was assigned to the fifth category of positions in local self-government bodies, and later by the law dated February 9, 2017 to the sixth category. This made it possible to streamline the structure and terms of payment for the newly elected starostas.

On February 9, 2017, a law was adopted that more clearly defined the status and powers of the starosta. Also, this law introduced the concept of starosta okruhs (elderships)―the territory on which the starost is elected and over which his powers extend. The starosta okruhs were to be formed by the amalgamated territorial hromada council and could consist of several settlements, in addition to the administrative center of the amalgamated territorial hromada. It was also fixed for the starostas the right to a guaranteed speech at the meetings of the amalgamated territorial hromada council and its standing commissions on issues related to their starosta okruh, as well as added control functions over the use of communal property objects and the state of improvement in their okruh.

According to the monitoring of the Ministry of Communities and Territories Development regarding the implementation of the reform of local self-government and territorial organization of power in Ukraine, as of October 1, 2023, only 7,567 starostas were approved by the local council, while 7,567 starosta okruhs were allocated as part of territorial communities throughout Ukraine.

==Other countries==

*In Ruthenia (Kievan Rus) it was a lower government official.
*In Galicia and Bukovina under Austrian rule a starosta supervised the county administration.
*In Russia the word was used until the early 20th century to denote the elected leader of an &quot;obshchina&quot;.
*In Romania, in the Middle Ages, the word was used until the early 19th century to denote the elected leader of the merchants or craftsmen guilds.

== Contemporary religious uses ==
&quot;Starosta&quot; is an official elected position in many Orthodox Christian churches, especially in Russia, Ukraine, and other Slavic-speaking countries. Though the position varies depending on the diocese and jurisdiction, the &quot;Starosta&quot; is generally responsible for housekeeping matters within the parish, facilitating logistics for services and cross processions, maintaining the physical church building and grounds, and ordering candles and other supplies for worship.

<text>Tianmian sauce (), also known as sweet bean sauce, sweet flour sauce or sweet wheat paste, is a thick, smooth, dark brown or black paste with either a mild, savory or sweet flavor. It is commonly used in Northern Chinese cuisine, Northeastern Chinese cuisine, as well as Korean-Chinese cuisine. Peking duck and &quot;jajangmyeon&quot; are two popular dishes that feature the sauce.

== Etymology ==
The Chinese word &quot;tiánmiànjiàng&quot; () consists of characters meaning &quot;sweet&quot; (), &quot;flour&quot; (), and &quot;sauce&quot; (). It is also called &quot;tiánjiàng&quot; (), which means &quot;sweet sauce&quot;. The origin of the Korean word &quot;chunjang&quot; () is unknown. One theory is that it derived from the word &quot;cheomjang&quot; (), which is the Korean reading of the Chinese characters .

== Preparation ==
Although terms such as &quot;sweet bean sauce&quot; and &quot;sweet bean paste&quot; are used to describe the sauce, it is primarily made from fermented wheat flour. A mixture of approximately 19 portions of wheat flour to one portion of soybean is used. The fermentation starter is made from dried or stale &quot;mantou&quot; (a steamed bread), wrapped in a variety of true melon known as &quot;miangua&quot; and then bound and hung in a cool, dark place until completely dried. During the fermentation process, the glucose and maltose give the paste its distinctive sweet taste.

== Variations and uses ==

=== Chinese varieties ===
Similar to hoisin sauce, sweet bean sauce may be used in dishes such as Peking duck. It is also used as a sweeter substitute for saltier yellow soybean paste. In Northern China, the sauce is also eaten with raw scallions.

There are many different types of sweet bean sauces. Recipes and methods of production vary depending on the geographical region and on manufacturer preferences. In northern China, more sugar is added to the sauce. In southern China, &quot;mantou&quot; flour instead of sugar is commonly used as the main ingredient. Traditionally, high-quality sweet bean sauces owe their sweet flavor to the fermentation of starches rather than to the addition of refined sugar.

Sweet bean sauce can be found in standard Asian supermarkets under various English names. In Chinese, it is written 甜麵醬.

=== Korean chunjang ===

In Korea, &quot;chunjang&quot; () is most commonly used to make &quot;jajang&quot; (), a black gravy served with a popular noodle dish called &quot;jajangmyeon&quot;. Other common dishes with &quot;jajang&quot; sauce include &quot;jajang-bap&quot; (&quot;rice with &quot;jajang&quot; sauce&quot;) and &quot;jajang-tteok-bokki&quot; (stir-fried rice cakes with &quot;jajang&quot; sauce). Although stir-frying &quot;chunjang&quot; to make &quot;jajang&quot; is the most common use for the sauce, &quot;chunjang&quot; may also be served as an accompaniment to sliced raw onions. In most Korean-Chinese restaurants, raw onions, &quot;chunjang&quot;, and &quot;danmuji&quot; (yellow pickled radish) are the basic side dishes.

Korean &quot;chunjang&quot; is similar to the Shandong-style &quot;tiánmiànjiàng&quot;, as it was first used in Incheon Chinatown, where the majority of restaurants were run by Chinese immigrants from Shandong. However, now most Korean-Chinese restaurants are run by Koreans, and &quot;chunjang&quot; has adapted to Korean tastes, as have other Korean-Chinese dishes and ingredients.

<text>Korkeasaari () is an island in Helsinki. The literal meaning of Korkeasaari is &quot;Tall Island/Islet&quot;. It is part of the Mustikkamaa–Korkeasaari district. Korkeasaari Zoo is located on the island and named after it. 

The island of Korkeasaari is a rocky island. Two smaller islands are located next to it: &quot;Hylkysaari&quot; and &quot;Palosaari&quot;. 

==History==
A sacrificial stone from the Bronze Age has been found on the island. It is the first one found in the Helsinki area.

Korkeasaari has been in recreational use for people living in Helsinki for a long time. Locals used it for fishing and for herding. After the Crimean War a steam boat started operating to the island, and the island became a popular place to spend time. 

Korkeasaari was rented to &quot;Helsingin Anniskeluyhtiö&quot; in 1883, and the company started renovating the island. Roads were built and city gardener L. A. Jernström planned planting areas to the island. A restaurant designed by Theodor Höijer was built in 1884, and it is still located on the island and used as a restaurant. In 1889 Korkeasaari Zoo was established and located to the island.

==Transportation==
In 1972, a bridge was built to connect Korkeasaari to the mainland via Mustikkamaa. Before that, a ferry was the only option to arrive to the island. A ferry still operates to Korkeasaari from the Market Square during the summer. In 2021, construction of the Crown Bridges started, which will connect Korkeasaari to Hakaniemi and Kruunuvuorenranta, and also bring a tram connection to the island.

<doc id="1342660" wikidata="Q16242754" url="?curid=1342660" title="Allodial title">
<text>Allodial title constitutes ownership of real property (land, buildings, and fixtures) that is independent of any superior landlord. Allodial title is related to the concept of land held &quot;in allodium&quot;, or land ownership by occupancy and defence of the land.

Most property ownership in common law jurisdictions is fee simple. In the United States, the land is subject to eminent domain by federal, state and local government, and subject to the imposition of taxes by state and/or local governments, and there is thus no true allodial land. Land is &quot;held of the Crown&quot; in England and Wales and other jurisdictions in the Commonwealth realms. Some land in the Orkney and Shetland Islands, known as udal land, is held in a manner akin to allodial land in that these titles are not subject to the ultimate ownership of the Crown.

In France, while allodial title existed before the French Revolution, it was rare and limited to ecclesiastical properties and property that had fallen out of feudal ownership. After the French Revolution allodial title became the norm in France and other civil law countries that were under Napoleonic legal influences. In October 1854, the seigneurial system of Lower Canada, which had been ceded from France to Britain in 1763 at the conclusion of the Seven Years&#x27; War, was extinguished by the Seigneurial Tenures Abolition Act of October 1854, and a form similar to socage replaced it.

Property owned under allodial title is referred to as allodial land, allodium, or an allod. In the Domesday Book of 1086 it is called alod. Historically, allodial title was sometimes used to distinguish ownership of land without feudal duties from ownership by feudal tenure which restricted alienation and burdened land with the tenurial rights of a landholder&#x27;s overlord or sovereign.

==Legal concept==
Allodial lands are the absolute property of their owner and not subject to any rent, service, or acknowledgment to a superior. Allodial title is therefore an alternative to feudal land tenure. However, historian James Holt states that &quot;In Normandy the word &quot;alodium&quot;, whatever its sense in other parts of the Continent, meant, not land held free of seigneurial services, but land held by hereditary right&quot;, and that &quot;&quot;alodium&quot; and &quot;feodum&quot; should be given the same meaning in England&quot;.

&quot;Allodium&quot;, meaning &quot;land exempt from feudal duties&quot;, is first attested in English-language texts in the 11th-century Domesday Book, but was borrowed from Old Low Franconian *&quot;allōd&quot;, meaning &quot;full property&quot;, and attested in Latin as e.g., , , in the Salic law (c. A.D. 507–596) and other Germanic laws. The word is a compound of *&quot;all&quot; &quot;whole, full&quot; and *&quot;ōd&quot; &quot;estate, property&quot; (cf. Old Saxon &quot;ōd&quot;, Old English &quot;ead&quot;, Old Norse &quot;auðr&quot;). Allodial tenure seems to have been common throughout northern Europe, but is now unknown in common law jurisdictions apart from Scotland and the Isle of Man. An allod could be converted into a fief by the owner surrendering it to a lord and receiving it back as a fief.

Allodial land title is common in the Isle of Man which has laws with Nordic origins. A version called udal tenure exists in the Orkney and Shetland Islands, also of Nordic origin. These are the only parts of the United Kingdom where allodial title exists, with the few exceptions.

One such exception is the Scottish Barony of the Bachuil, which is not of feudal origin like other baronies but is allodial in that it predates (A.D. 562) Scotland itself and the feudal system, dating from the Gaelic Kingdom of Dál Riata. In recognition as allodial &quot;Barons par le Grâce de Dieu&quot; not barons by a feudal crown grant, the Baron of the Bachuil has the only coat of arms in Scotland granted a cap of maintenance with a &quot;vair&quot; (squirrel fur) lining (as opposed to ermine) by the Lord Lyon Court.

Another exception is Somerset House which was vested in His Majesty explicitly not in fee simple, and is held to be allodial.

<text>Green Hills of Africa is a 1935 work of nonfiction by American writer Ernest Hemingway. Hemingway&#x27;s second work of nonfiction, &quot;Green Hills of Africa&quot; is an account of a month on safari he and his wife, Pauline Marie Pfeiffer, took in East Africa during December 1933. &quot;Green Hills of Africa&quot; is divided into four parts: &quot;Pursuit and Conversation&quot;, &quot;Pursuit Remembered&quot;, &quot;Pursuit and Failure&quot;, and &quot;Pursuit as Happiness&quot;, each of which plays a different role in the story.

==Synopsis==
Much of the narrative describes Hemingway&#x27;s adventures hunting in East Africa, interspersed with ruminations about literature and authors. Generally the East African landscape Hemingway describes is in the region of Lake Manyara in Tanzania.

The book starts with Part 1 (&quot;Pursuit and Conversation&quot;), with Hemingway and an Austrian expatriate in conversation about American writers. Relations between the white hunters and native trackers are described, as well as Hemingway&#x27;s jealousy of the other hunters. Part 2 (&quot;Pursuit Remembered&quot;) presents a flashback of hunting in northern Tanzania with a description of the Rift Valley and descriptions of how to field dress prey. Hemingway kills a rhino, but his friend Karl kills a bigger one. The literary discussion moves to European writers such as Tolstoy, Flaubert, Stendhal, and Dostoevsky. In Part 3 (&quot;Pursuit and Failure&quot;) the action returns to the present with Hemingway unlucky in hunting, unable to find a kudu he tracks. He moves to an untouched piece of country with the native trackers. In Part 4 (&quot;Pursuit and Happiness&quot;) Hemingway and some of his trackers arrive at seemingly virgin country. There he kills a kudu bull with huge horns (52 inches). Back in the camp, he discovers that Karl killed a kudu with bigger horns. He is initially jealous of Karl’s luck, but overcomes this. The actions of his guides suggest that they respect him.

==Background and publication history==
&quot;Green Hills of Africa&quot; (1935) initially appeared in serialization in &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, and was published in 1935. An autobiographical account of his 1933 trip to Africa, Hemingway presents the subject of big game hunting in a non-fiction form in &quot;Green Hills of Africa&quot;. The serialization occurred from May to November 1935. The book was published on 25 October 1935 to a first edition print-run of 10,500 copies.

==Reception==

&quot;Green Hills of Africa&quot; initially got a cool reception. Writing for&quot; The New York Times&quot;, critic John Chamberlain claimed: &quot;&quot;Green Hills of Africa&quot; is not one of the major Hemingway works. Mr. Hemingway has so simplified his method that all his characters talk the lingo perfected in &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;, whether these characters are British, Austrian, Arabian, Ethiopian or Kikuyu.&quot; However, two days later, writing for the same newspaper, critic C. G. Poore hailed &quot;The Green Hills of Africa&quot; as &quot;the best-written story of big-game hunting anywhere I have read. And more than that. It&#x27;s a book about people in unacknowledged conflict and about the pleasures of travel and the pleasures of drinking and war and peace and writing.&quot; Despite the better review, Hemingway said the book critics &quot;killed&quot; the book. He went into a deep depression, and said he was &quot;ready to blow my lousy head off&quot;. Within a few months he was ready to blame the corrupting influence of the wealthy women in his life—his wife Pauline and his mistress Jane Mason. The result of his bitterness were two stories about Africa, which count among his most celebrated: &quot;The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber&quot; and &quot;The Snows of Kilimanjaro&quot;, that featured husbands married to domineering women.

==Literary analysis==
The foreword of &quot;Green Hills of Africa&quot; immediately identifies this as a work of nonfiction that should be compared with similar works of fiction: 

Unlike many novels, none of the characters or incidents in this book is imaginary. Any one not finding sufficient love interest is at liberty, while reading it, to insert whatever love interest he or she may have at the time. The writer has attempted to write an absolutely true book to see whether the shape of a country and the pattern of a month&#x27;s action can, if truly presented, compete with a work of the imagination.
The book is well known today for a line that has nearly nothing to do with its subject. This quote is frequently used as evidence that &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; is The Great American Novel:

The good writers are Henry James, Stephen Crane, and Mark Twain. That&#x27;s not the order they&#x27;re good in. There is no order for good writers... All modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;. If you read it you must stop where the Nigger Jim is stolen from the boys. That is the real end. The rest is just cheating. But it&#x27;s the best book we&#x27;ve had. All American writing comes from that. There was nothing before. There has been nothing as good since.

One episode in &quot;Green Hills of Africa&quot; is Hemingway&#x27;s conversation with the Austrian farmer Kandisky, whom Hemingway stops to help when Kandisky&#x27;s truck breaks down. After trading opinions on writers Ringelnatz, Rilke and Heinrich Mann and disagreeing about hunting, Hemingway and the Austrian discuss American literature over dinner, and it turns out that one of the few American writers Hemingway approves of is Henry James, whom he mentions twice.

Specifically, Hemingway says: &quot;The good American writers are Henry James, Stephen Crane, and Mark Twain” and adds later that “Henry James wanted to make money. He never did, of course”. Intermixed with these comments on James, Crane, and Twain are Hemingway’s views of American writers in general, most of whom, he says, came to a bad end. When Kandisky asks about himself Hemingway tells him, &quot;I am interested in other things. I have a good life but I must write because if I do not write a certain amount I do not enjoy the rest of my life.” When asked what he wants, Hemingway replies, “To write as well as I can and learn as I go along. At the same time, I have my life which I enjoy and which is a damned good life.&quot;

<doc id="1342676" wikidata="Q1360692" url="?curid=1342676" title="Slave Coast of West Africa">
<text>The Slave Coast is a historical region along the Atlantic coast of West Africa, encompassing parts of modern-day Togo, Benin, and Nigeria. It is located along the Bight of Biafra and the Bight of Benin that is located between the Volta River and the Lagos Lagoon. 

The name is derived from the region&#x27;s history as a major source of African people sold into slavery during the Atlantic slave trade from the early 16th century to the late 19th century. During this time, this coastal area became a major hub for the export of enslaved Africans to the Americas. European powers, including the Portuguese, British, Dutch, and French, established forts and trading posts in the region to facilitate the slave trade. The area was so named due to the high volume of enslaved people transported from its shores, profoundly impacting both the local societies and the broader Atlantic world. 

The Slave Coast is estimated to have been the point of departure for approximately two million enslaved Africans, representing about 16% of the estimated 12.5 million individuals transported to the Americas during the transatlantic slave trade. This equates to an average of around 20 individuals leaving the Slave Coast each day for over two centuries. A significant number of these individuals, likely more than half, were embarked from the beach south of Ouidah, which lacked formal port facilities. The other primary port from which slaves embarked was Lagos. These figures represent only those who survived the conditions prior to departure, including the harsh waiting and loading periods.

Other nearby coastal regions were historically known by their prime colonial export are the Gold Coast, the Ivory Coast (or Windward Coast), and the Pepper Coast (or Grain Coast).
==Historical background==
=== European contact and initial trade ===
European sources began documenting the development of trade in the &quot;Slave Coast&quot; region and its integration into the transatlantic slave trade around 1670.

In the 18th century, intermarriage between European residents and African women was primarily linked to the European forts established in Ouidah. While most European personnel either died or returned home after short tenures, those who stayed longer often formed relationships with local women and had children.

=== Transatlantic slave trade ===
The transatlantic slave trade led to the formation of an &quot;Atlantic community&quot; of Africans and Europeans in the 17th, 18th, and 19th century. Roughly twelve million enslaved Africans were purchased by European slave traders from African slave merchants during the period of the transatlantic slave trade. Enslaved Africans were transported to the Americas to work on cash crop plantations in European colonies. Ports that exported these enslaved people from Africa include Ouidah, Lagos, Aného (Little Popo), Grand-Popo, Agoué, Jakin, Porto-Novo, and Badagry. These ports traded slaves who were supplied from African communities, tribes and kingdoms, including the Allada and Ouidah, which were later taken over by the Dahomey kingdom.

The extensive slave trade along the Slave Coast contributed to the development of a diverse population engaged in transatlantic commercial and social networks. This population played an influential role in shaping both Atlantic commerce and culture.

=== Abolition ===
The transatlantic slave trade in West Africa began to decline earlier than in other regions. While the flow of captives from Atlantic Africa is generally considered to have first been restricted by legislation and diplomatic and naval pressure over several decades in the early 19th century, the decline in West Africa started even before abolition laws were enacted. Most powerful slave-trading countries had begun abolitionist campaigns in 1807, while the volume of slave shipments began to decline in West Africa from 1787. This was due to colonial legislation creating favorable circumstances for abolition and greater economic opportunities, such as the cash crop revolution, empowering former slaves. This process influenced the enforcing of abolition through legislation in the remaining countries which were involved in the trade.

==Human toll==
The coast was also called &quot;the White man&#x27;s grave&quot; because of the mass amount of death from illnesses such as yellow fever, malaria, heat exhaustion, and many gastro-entero sicknesses. In 1841, 80% of British sailors serving in military expeditions on the Niger River were infected with fevers. Between 1844 and 1854, 20 of the 74 French missionaries in Senegal died from local illnesses, and 19 more died shortly after arriving back to France. Intermarriage has been documented in ports like Ouidah where Europeans were permanently stationed. Communication was quite extensive among all three areas of trade, to the point where even individual enslaved people could be tracked.

The trans-Atlantic slave trade resulted in a vast and unknown loss of life for African captives both in and outside the Americas. Over a million people are thought to have died during their transport to the New World. More died soon after their arrival. The number of lives lost in the procurement of slaves remains a mystery but may equal or exceed the number of people who survived to be enslaved.

Modern historians estimate that between two and three million people were transported out of this region and traded for goods like alcohol and tobacco from the Americas and textiles from Europe as part of the triangular trade. Historians have noted that though official records state that twelve million enslaved Africans were transported to the Americas from Africa, the actual number of slaves purchased by European slave traders was considerably higher. Alongside other forms of trade, this complex exchange also fostered cultural exchanges between these three regions, involving religions, architectural styles, languages, and knowledge. In addition to the enslaved people, free men used the exchange routes to travel to new destinations, and both slaves and free travelers helped blend European and African cultures. After the institution of slavery was abolished by successive European governments, the transatlantic slave trade continued for a time, with independent traders operating in violation of their countries&#x27; laws.

The savage nature of the trade led to the destruction of individuals and cultures. Historian Ana Lucia Araujo has noted that the process of enslavement did not end with arrival on Western Hemisphere shores; the different paths taken by the individuals and groups who were victims of the trans-Atlantic slave trade were influenced by different factors—including the disembarking region, the ability to be sold on the market, the kind of work performed, gender, age, religion, and language.

University of Pittsburgh Professor of World History, Patrick Manning, estimates that about 12 million enslaved people were victims of the Atlantic trade between the 16th and 19th century, but that about 1.5 million people died on board ships. About 10.5 million slaves arrived in the Americas. Besides the enslaved people who died on the Middle Passage, more African people likely died during the slave raids in Africa and forced marches to ports. Manning estimates that 4 million people died inside Africa after capture, and many more died young. Manning&#x27;s estimate covers the 12 million people who were originally destined for the Atlantic, as well as the 6 million people destined for Asian slave markets and the 8 million people destined for African markets. Of the slaves shipped to the Americas, the largest share went to Brazil and the Caribbean.

<text>Daniel Carver is an American white supremacist and former Grand Dragon of the &quot;Invisible Empire, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan&quot; based in Georgia. Carver was suspended from wearing Klan robes and from attending Klan rallies after a 1986 conviction for &quot;terroristic threats&quot;.

In October 1987 he was sued for violating the civil rights of others in Forsyth County, Georgia, after interfering in the &quot;Brotherhood March&quot; celebrating Martin Luther King Jr. Day. He and several other members of two Ku Klux Klan groups threw bottles and rocks at the marchers, and encouraged other crowd members to follow suit. Fines of around $940,000 were issued; the Invisible Empire of the Ku Klux Klan were fined $400,000 and he personally was ordered to pay $30,000 in punitive damages to the marchers.

Carver claims to have served in the 82nd Airborne Division of the U.S. Army from 1967 to 1970 and claims to have fought in Vietnam in 1968.

Daniel Carver was a frequent guest on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; and a former member of the show&#x27;s Wack Pack. He was featured for the outrageous statements he would always make to defend his extremely prejudiced views, mostly towards African-Americans.

<text>Héctor Luis Bustamante (born March 12, 1972) is a Colombian-American actor. He is best known for his emotionally-charged performance as Pedro Vera in the 2008 original LMN movie &quot;Little Girl Lost: The Delimar Vera Story&quot;. He currently stars in the American short virtual reality project &quot;Carne y Arena&quot; (&quot;Flesh and Sand&quot;) written and directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu. &quot;Carne y Arena&quot; was awarded the first Special Achievement Academy Award in over 20 years by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

==Early life==
He was born Héctor Luis Bustamante Durango in Medellín, Colombia to Dagoberto Bustamante and Aracelly Durango. Bustamante and his family moved to the United States when he was 12. Bustamante is an alumnus of the 1989 Governor&#x27;s School of New Jersey as an art scholar. His first theatrical role was in a Hackensack High School production of &quot;West Side Story&quot;, which was well received and led him to roles in several other productions, though his drama teacher told him that he would never be a professional actor because his accent was too thick for American TV.

Bustamante focused on art and started working as a graphic designer. By age 19, he was the art director for &quot;New Jersey Golf&quot; magazine.

==Career==
In 1995, Bustamante enrolled in the Parsons School of Design in New York City, paying for school by working in retail as a security guard and eventually became the security manager in one of a retail store on Fifth Avenue.

In the fall of 1999, he used his work in the security field to transfer to San Francisco. While in the Bay Area, Bustamante attended the &quot;Shelton Studios&quot;, also known as the Jean Shelton Actors Lab, where he studied under acting coach and mentor Jean Shelton.

In March 2000, Bustamante met acting coach Nancy Berwid, who invited him to an acting workshop. A year later, at a workshop Berwid hosted Hector met Donna Eckholdt, VP of talent development and casting for Paramount&#x27;s Big Ticket Television. After seeing Bustamante&#x27;s work, Eckholdt considered him for a series regular role on a project based on the life of a New York City private investigator.

A year later while still in San Francisco, Bustamante made his first major TV appearance on CBS&#x27; &quot;The Agency&quot;, playing the head of the Colombian police. Within weeks he landed his second role in &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; opposite Dennis Franz and Mark-Paul Gosselaar. In the spring of 2003 Bustamante resigned from his security job and moved to Los Angeles. Since then he has performed in guest star roles on such shows as &quot;24&quot;, &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot;, &quot;Without A Trace&quot;, &quot;Monk&quot;, and films such as, &quot;Hostage&quot; opposite Bruce Willis and &quot;Sueño&quot; opposite John Leguizamo.

<doc id="1342696" wikidata="Q275792" url="?curid=1342696" title="Saline (medicine)">
<text>Saline (also known as saline solution) is a mixture of sodium chloride (salt) and water. It has a number of uses in medicine including cleaning wounds, removal and storage of contact lenses, and help with dry eyes. By injection into a vein, it is used to treat hypovolemia such as that from gastroenteritis and diabetic ketoacidosis. Large amounts may result in fluid overload, swelling, acidosis, and high blood sodium. In those with long-standing low blood sodium, excessive use may result in osmotic demyelination syndrome. 

Saline is in the crystalloid family of medications. It is most commonly used as a sterile 9 g of salt per litre (0.9%) solution, known as &quot;normal saline&quot;. Higher and lower concentrations may also occasionally be used. Saline is acidic, with a pH of 5.5 (due mainly to dissolved carbon dioxide).
The medical use of saline began around 1831. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, sodium salts was the 216th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1million prescriptions.
== Normal concentration ==
&quot;Normal saline&quot; (&quot;NSS,&quot; &quot;NS&quot; or &quot;N/S&quot;) is the commonly used phrase for a solution of 0.90% w/v of NaCl, 308 mOsm/L or 9.0 g per liter. Less commonly, this solution is referred to as &quot;physiological saline&quot; or &quot;isotonic saline&quot; (because it is approximately isotonic to blood serum, which makes it a physiologically normal solution). Although neither of those names is technically accurate because normal saline is not exactly like blood serum, they convey the practical effect usually seen: good fluid balance with minimal hypotonicity or hypertonicity. NS is used frequently in intravenous drips (IVs) for people who cannot take fluids orally and have developed or are in danger of developing dehydration or hypovolemia. NS is also used for aseptic purpose. NS is typically the first fluid used when hypovolemia is severe enough to threaten the adequacy of blood circulation, and has long been believed to be the safest fluid to give quickly in large volumes. However, it is now known that rapid infusion of NS can cause metabolic acidosis.

The solution is 9 grams of sodium chloride (NaCl) dissolved in water, to a total volume of 1000 ml (weight per unit volume). The mass of 1 millilitre of normal saline is 1.0046 grams at 22 °C. The molecular weight of sodium chloride is approximately 58.4 grams per mole, so 58.4 grams of sodium chloride equals 1 mole. Since normal saline contains 9 grams of NaCl, the concentration is 9 grams per litre divided by 58.4 grams per mole, or 0.154 mole per litre. Since NaCl dissociates into two ions – sodium and chloride – 1 molar NaCl is 2 osmolar. Thus, NS contains 154 mEq/L of Na+ and the same amount of Cl−. This points to an osmolarity of 154 + 154 = 308, which is higher (i.e. more solute per litre) than that of blood (approximately 285). However, if the osmotic coefficient (a correction for non-ideal solutions) is taken into account, then the saline solution is much closer to isotonic. The osmotic coefficient of NaCl is about 0.93, which yields an osmolarity of 0.154 × 1000 × 2 × 0.93 = 286.44. Therefore, the osmolarity of normal saline is a close approximation to the osmolarity of blood.

=== Usage ===

For medical purposes, saline is often used to flush wounds and skin abrasions. However, research indicates that it is no more effective than potable tap water. Normal saline will not burn or sting when applied.

Saline is also used in I.V. therapy, intravenously supplying extra water to rehydrate people or supplying the daily water and salt needs (&quot;maintenance&quot; needs) of a person who is unable to take them by mouth. Because infusing a solution of low osmolality can cause problems such as hemolysis, intravenous solutions with reduced saline concentrations (less than 0.9%) typically have dextrose (glucose) added to maintain a safe osmolality while providing less sodium chloride. The amount of normal saline infused depends largely on the needs of the person (e.g. ongoing diarrhea or heart failure).

Saline is also often used for nasal washes to relieve some of the symptoms of rhinitis and the common cold. The solution exerts a softening and loosening influence on the mucus to make it easier to wash out and clear the nasal passages for both babies and adults. In very rare instances, fatal infection by the amoeba &quot;Naegleria fowleri&quot; can occur if it enters the body through the nose; therefore tap water must not be used for nasal irrigation. Water is only appropriate for this purpose if it is sterile, distilled, boiled, filtered, or disinfected.

Sterile isotonic saline is also used to fill breast implants for use in breast augmentation surgery, to correct congenital abnormalities such as tuberous breast deformity, and to correct breast asymmetry. Saline breast implants are also used in reconstructive surgery post-mastectomy.

==== Eyes ====

Eye drops are saline-containing drops used on the eye. Depending on the condition being treated, they may contain steroids, antihistamines, sympathomimetics, beta receptor blockers, parasympathomimetics, parasympatholytics, prostaglandins, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antibiotics or topical anesthetics. Eye drops sometimes do not have medications in them and are only lubricating and tear-replacing solutions.

==== Nose ====

There is tentative evidence that saline nasal irrigation may help with long term cases of rhinosinusitis. Evidence for use in cases of rhinosinusitis of short duration is unclear.

==== Scleral tattooing ====
Saline is used in scleral tattooing, coloring the white part of the human eye.

==== Tattoo lightening ====

Saline is used to lighten tattoos (including microblading tattoos) through the process of osmosis.

==Other concentrations==
Concentrations lower and higher than normal also exist. High concentrations are used rarely in medicine but frequently in molecular biology.

=== Hypertonic saline ===

Hypertonic saline—7% NaCl solutions are considered mucoactive agents and thus are used to hydrate thick secretions (mucus) in order to make it easier to cough up and out (expectorate). 3% hypertonic saline solutions are also used in critical care settings, acutely increased intracranial pressure, or severe hyponatremia. Inhalation of hypertonic saline has also been shown to help in other respiratory problems, specifically bronchiolitis. Hypertonic saline is currently recommended by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation as a primary part of a cystic fibrosis treatment regimen.

An 11% solution of xylitol with 0.65% saline stimulates the washing of the nasopharynx and has an effect on the nasal pathogenic bacteria. This has been used in complementary and alternative medicine.

Hypertonic saline may be used in perioperative fluid management protocols to reduce excessive intravenous fluid infusions and lessen pulmonary complications. Hypertonic saline is used in treating hyponatremia and cerebral edema. Rapid correction of hyponatremia via hypertonic saline, or via any saline infusion &gt; 40 mmol/L (Na+ having a valence of 1, 40 mmol/L = 40 mEq/L) greatly increases risk of central pontine myelinolysis (CPM), and so requires constant monitoring of the person&#x27;s response. Water privation combined with diuretic block does not produce as much risk of CPM as saline administration does; however, it does not correct hyponatremia as rapidly as administration of hypertonic saline does. Due to hypertonicity, administration may result in phlebitis and tissue necrosis. As such, concentrations greater than 3% NaCl should normally be administered via a central venous catheter, also known as a &#x27;central line&#x27;. Such hypertonic saline is normally available in two strengths, the former of which is more commonly administered:
* 3% NaCl has 513 mEq/L of Na and Cl.
* 5% NaCl has 856 mEq/L of Na and Cl.

Hypertonic NaCl solutions that are less commonly used are 7% (1200 mEq/L) and 23.4% (approx 4000 mEq/L), both of which are used (also via central line), often in conjunction with supplementary diuretics, in the treatment of traumatic brain injury.

=== Less concentrated solutions ===

Other concentrations commonly used include:
* Half-normal saline (0.45% NaCl), often with &quot;D5&quot; (5% dextrose), contains 77 mEq/L of Na and Cl and 50 g/L dextrose.
* Quarter-normal saline (0.22% NaCl) has 39 mEq/L of Na and Cl and almost always contains 5% dextrose for osmolality reasons. It can be used alone in neonatal intensive care units.
* Dextrose (glucose) 4% in 0.18% saline is used sometimes for maintenance replacement.

== Solutions with added ingredients ==

In medicine, common types of salines include:

* Ringer&#x27;s lactate solution
* Acetated Ringer&#x27;s solution
*Oral rehydration solution
* Intravenous sugar solutions
** 5% dextrose in normal saline (D5NS)
** 10% dextrose in normal saline (D10NS)
** 5% dextrose in half-normal saline (D5HNS)
** 10% dextrose in half-normal saline (D10HNS)

And in cell biology, in addition to the above the following are used:

* Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (recipes from Dulbecco = D-PBS, Galfre, Kuchler, Ausubel etc.)
* TRIS-buffered saline (TBS) (recipes from Goldsmith, Ausubel etc.)
* Hank&#x27;s balanced salt solution (HBSS)
* Earle&#x27;s balanced salt solution (EBSS)
* Standard saline citrate (SSC)
* HEPES-buffered saline (HBS) (recipes from Dittmar, Liu, Ausubel etc.)
* Gey&#x27;s balanced salt solution (GBSS)

== History ==

Saline was believed to have originated during the Indian Blue cholera pandemic that swept across Europe in 1831. William Brooke O&#x27;Shaughnessy, a recent graduate of Edinburgh Medical School, proposed in an article to medical journal &quot;The Lancet&quot; to inject people infected with cholera with highly oxygenated salts to treat the &quot;universal stagnation of the venous system and rapid cessation of arterialisation of the blood&quot; seen in people with severely dehydrated cholera. He found his treatment harmless in dogs, and his proposal was soon adopted by the physician Thomas Latta in treating people with cholera to beneficial effect. In the following decades, variations and alternatives to Latta&#x27;s solution were tested and used in treating people with cholera. These solutions contained a range of concentrations of sodium, chloride, potassium, carbonate, phosphate, and hydroxide.

The breakthrough in achieving physiological concentrations was accomplished by Sydney Ringer in the early 1880s, when he determined the optimal salt concentrations to maintain the contractility of frog heart muscle tissue. Normal saline is considered a descendant of the pre-Ringer solutions, as Ringer&#x27;s findings were not adopted and widely used until decades later. The term &quot;normal saline&quot; itself appears to have little historical basis, except for studies done in 1882–83 by Dutch physiologist Hartog Jacob Hamburger; these in vitro studies of red cell lysis suggested incorrectly that 0.9% was the concentration of salt in human blood (rather than 0.6%, the true concentration).

Normal saline has become widely used in modern medicine, but due to the mismatch with real blood, other solutions have proved better. The 2018 publication of a randomized, controlled trial with 15,000 people in intensive care units showed that compared to normal saline, lactated Ringer&#x27;s solution reduced the combined risk of mortality, need for additional dialysis, or persistent kidney problems from 15% to 14%, which given the large number of patients is a significant reduction.

== Society and culture ==

Coconut water has been used in place of normal saline in areas without access to normal saline. Its use, however, has not been well studied.

<text>The Winter Coast (&quot;Zimniy Bereg&quot;, ) is a coastal area in Arkhangelsk Oblast in northwest Russia. It is located on the eastern side of the Dvina Bay in the White Sea, between the Northern Dvina delta and Cape Voronov, opposite to the Summer Coast. The names reflect the fact that the pomors of the Dvina Bay were fishing at Summer Coast and Winter Coast in the summer and in the winter, respectively. The major rivers flowing to the sea at the coast are the Lodma and the Zolotitsa.

Administratively, the Winter coast is shared between Primorsky and Mezensky Districts of Arkhangelsk Oblast.

The villages of Lapominka, Patrakeyevka, Kad, Kuya, Kozly, Veprevsky, Nizhnyaya Zolotitsa, Tova, Intsy, Ruchyi, Megra, Mayda, and Voronovsky are all located on the Winter Coast. The coast was populated not later than 13th century by the Pomors, and fishery was their traditional occupation until the 1990s, when it went into decline. There are no all-season land routes to most of the villages, and the connections are either by sea (irregular), or by air from Arkhangelsk.

The northern part of the district, with the villages of Ruchyi and Koyda, is included into border security zone, intended to protect the borders of Russian Federation from unwanted activity. In order to visit the zone, a permit issued by the local FSB department is required.

<doc id="1342698" wikidata="Q4673330" url="?curid=1342698" title="Acey-deucey">
<text>Acey-deucey is a table game, a family of board games that includes backgammon. Since World War I, it has been a favorite game of the United States Navy, Marine Corps, and Merchant Marine. Some evidence shows that it was played in the early 1900s aboard U.S. Navy ships. The game is believed to be rooted in the Middle East, Greece, or Turkey, where there were variants in which the game started with pieces off of the board. 

Compared to standard backgammon, acey-deucey is more like a race than a strategy game. It features a differing starting position, opening play, and rules for the endgame. There is no doubling cube. Because pieces may be retained in one&#x27;s opponent&#x27;s home board, the game offers substantial opportunities for backgame play.

==Other meanings==
=== Gambling ===
Acey-deucey is a gambling game using playing cards in the same family as poker.

=== Horse racing ===
Acey-deucey is deliberately riding a horse with one stirrup shorter than the other. It is most often seen in racing in the United States, where a jockey will slightly lengthen the inside stirrup to gain better balance on turns, all of which are left-handed in America. Some riders believe this helps them.

==Initial setup==

The equipment needed for acey-deucey comprises a tables board, 15 pieces per player, called men or stones, and two dice. All of both players&#x27; men are off the board when the game begins.

==Opening play==
Men are entered onto the opponent&#x27;s inner board – the &#x27;entering table&#x27; or &#x27;starting quarter&#x27; as if they were on the bar (known as the &#x27;fence&#x27;). Once a man has been entered, it can be moved even though other men have not yet been entered. One strategy in the game is to keep one man, called &quot;Oscar&quot;, off the board until it is needed for defensive purposes.

==Play==
Play passes back and forth, with each player rolling both dice. Players use each die roll to move one man the corresponding number of points in the direction of the march. A player may use both rolls for one man, as long as both the intermediate point and destination point are not occupied by two or more enemy men. A man may move to a vacant point or one with men of the same colour. They may also move to a point occupied by one enemy man and &#x27;kick&#x27; the man off the board. The kicked man must be re-entered.

A player who rolls doublets may move a total of four times, each move traversing as many spaces as the rolled amount (two fives rolled result in four moves of five points each). After rolling these doublets, the player takes another turn.

If a player rolls an acey-deucey (= a 1 and a 2, also called an Ace and a Deuce), he plays the 1-and-2; then they choose any number from 1 to 6 and act as if they had just thrown a doublet of it; then that player takes another turn. 

After the opening, the rules of play are as follows:
#After rolling and playing doubles or acey-deucey, the player must roll and move again.
#A roll of acey-deucey counts as a 1-2, and as doubles of the player&#x27;s choice.
#Upon reaching one&#x27;s own home board, also called the &#x27;finishing quarter&#x27;, a man may not be moved again until all the rest have arrived.
#An exact roll is required to bear off.
#A player can move men even if he has men on the fence.

==Terminology==

The initial rolling of one die is called the &quot;peewee&quot; or &quot;piddle&quot;. The bar is the &quot;fence&quot;, and a single man is &quot;kicked&quot; rather than hit. The opponent&#x27;s inner table is called the &quot;entering table&quot; or &quot;starting quarter,&quot; and one&#x27;s own inner table is the &quot;finishing quarter&quot;.

==Variants==
Variants of the above rules exist that make the game more restrictive:
#Upon rolling acey-deucey, the player does not choose doublets for their next move. Instead, they roll one die and use that number for the doublet choice.
#If a player rolls acey-deucey but is unable to utilize both the 1 and 2 (most likely because he is blocked), their turn ends. They do not get a doublet, and they do not get another roll.
#If a player rolls doublets but is unable to utilize all 4 moves (most likely because they are blocked), their turn ends. They do not get another roll. This rule also holds for doublets following an acey-deucey.
#Men may be freely moved inside one&#x27;s home (bear-off) area until all other men have arrived. This is the opposite from the description above.
#Once all men have arrived in the player&#x27;s home area, they may not move any more.
#Players may only bear off men that exactly match the die roll. For instance, if the 6 and 5 points are open and the player rolls a 6-5, they may not use that roll to bear off a man from the 4-point.
#Men may be only moved from the fence upon rolling doublets.
#The ability to take extra rolls for doublets and acey-deucey during bearing off have the same rules stated above. If a player rolls an acey-deucey but cannot bear a man off from both the 1-point and the 2-point, that player is not entitled to a roll for doublets or another turn. 
#If a player rolls a 6-6 and only has three men on the 6-point to bear off, that player may not take another turn (although he or she can bear off the three men from that point).
#At the beginning of the game, no man may be put into play unless a doublet is rolled. In other words, a player may not enter a man without first rolling a doublet. After the initial doublet, any man may be entered as desired.

==In popular culture==

Acey-deucey is often mentioned in the book series &quot;The Corps&quot; by W.E.B. Griffin which is set in the Pacific Theater of World War II, and follows the lives of a group of marines in special service. Griffin never explains the game in the slightest, but his characters are often playing it when they are interrupted by the war, i.e. required to stop playing to perform some duty.

<text>North Andaman Island is the northern island of Great Andaman of the Andaman Islands. 
It belongs to the North and Middle Andaman administrative district, part of the Indian union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
the island is lying north from Port Blair.

==Geography==

The island belongs to the Great Andaman group and lies north of Middle Andaman Island. many small island groups surround its beaches. The island&#x27;s main town is Diglipur.

The island previously had an indigenous population of the Great Andamanese, for example, the Bo, but they are no longer present: the island is populated by immigrants from the Indian mainland and their descendants.

The island is home to the highest point in the archipelago, Saddle Peak at 731 metres.

North Andaman has fairly frequent large earthquakes, and suffered inundation from the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake tsunami.

==Administration==
The entire island is part of Diglipur Taluk.

==Transportation==
There is a small port at Durgapur, north of Diglipur, with regular services from Port Blair.

==Economy==
North Andaman is known for its marine life: the island&#x27;s main industries are rice- and orange-growing.

<text>Álvaro de Bazán is the lead ship of the of air defence frigates entering service with the Spanish Navy. She is named after Admiral Álvaro de Bazán.

==Operational history==
In late 2005, &quot;Álvaro de Bazán&quot; was deployed as part of the aircraft carrier battle group in the Persian Gulf. This was the first deployment of a Spanish warship as part of an American naval battle group.

In early March 2007, &quot;Álvaro de Bazán&quot; became the first Spanish warship to visit Australia in 150 years. The deployment included several port visits, and was performed to support Navantia&#x27;s bid to design the for the Royal Australian Navy. The ship was also visiting Australia as part of the first circumnavigation of the globe by a Spanish warship in 142 years.

<text>The Summer Coast (&quot;Letniy Bereg&quot;, ) is a coastal area in Arkhangelsk Oblast in northwest Russia. It is located on the western side of the Dvina Bay in the White Sea, on the Onega Peninsula, between the Northern Dvina delta and Cape Ukhtnavolok, opposite to the Winter Coast. The names reflect the fact that the pomors of the Dvina Bay were fishing at Summer Coast and Winter Coast in the summer and in the winter, respectively.

Administratively, the Summer coast is shared between Primorsky District and the city of Severodvinsk of Arkhangelsk Oblast. Between 1940 and 1958, the coast was part of Belomorsky District, with the center in the selo of Pertominsk.

The villages of Nyonoksa, Syuzma, Krasnaya Gora, Pertominsk, Unsky, Yarenga, and Lopshenga are all located at the Summer Coast. The coast is crossed by the Una Bay, a gulf in the Dvina Bay, which is about long. The villages of Una and Luda are located at the inner coast of the Una Bay. The coast was populated not later than 13th century by the Pomors, and fishery was their traditional occupation until the 1990s, when it went into decline. There are no all-season land routes to the villages of Krasnaya Gora, Pertominsk, Unsky, Yarenga, and Lopshenga, and the connections are either by sea (irregular), or by air from Arkhangelsk.

<text>The Hyphomicrobiales (synonom Rhizobiales) are an order of Gram-negative Alphaproteobacteria.

The rhizobia, which fix nitrogen and are symbiotic with plant roots, appear in several different families. The four families &quot;Nitrobacteraceae&quot;, &quot;Hyphomicrobiaceae&quot;, &quot;Phyllobacteriaceae&quot;, and &quot;Rhizobiaceae&quot; contain at least several genera of nitrogen-fixing, legume-nodulating, microsymbiotic bacteria. Examples are the genera &quot;Bradyrhizobium&quot; and &quot;Rhizobium&quot;. Species of the &quot;Methylocystaceae&quot; are methanotrophs; they use methanol (CH3OH) or methane (CH4) as their sole energy and carbon sources. Other important genera are the human pathogens &quot;Bartonella&quot; and &quot;Brucella&quot;, as well as &quot;Agrobacterium,&quot; an important tool in genetic engineering.

==Phylogeny==
The currently accepted taxonomy is based on the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature and the phylogeny is based on whole-genome sequences.

==Natural genetic transformation==

Natural genetic transformation has been reported in at least four &quot;Hyphomicrobiales&quot; species: &quot;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&quot;, &quot;Methylobacterium organophilum&quot;, &quot;Ensifer adhaerens&quot;, and &quot;Bradyrhizobium japonicum&quot;. Natural genetic transformation is a sexual process involving DNA transfer from one bacterial cell to another through the intervening medium, and the integration of the donor sequence into the recipient genome by homologous recombination.

<text>Mei (from ) is a genus of duck-sized troodontid dinosaur first unearthed by paleontologists from the Yixian Formation in Liaoning, China in 2004. &quot;Mei&quot; lived during the Early Cretaceous period. The binomial name of its only species, Mei long (Chinese 寐 mèi and 龍 lóng), means &quot;sleeping dragon&quot;.

==Description==

&quot;Mei&quot; is a troodontid, a group of small, bird-like, maniraptorans. All troodontids have many unique features of the skull, such as closely spaced teeth in the lower jaw, and large numbers of teeth. Troodontids have sickle-claws and raptorial hands, and some of the highest non-avian encephalization quotients, meaning they were behaviourally advanced and had keen senses. The type fossil is a young juvenile about long, complete and exceptionally well preserved in three-dimensional detail, with the snout nestled beneath one of the forelimbs and the legs neatly folded beneath the body, similar to the roosting position of modern birds. This posture provides another behavioral link between birds and dinosaurs. The chemistry of the matrix stone and the resting pose indicate the living animal was probably buried instantly in volcanic ash. A second specimen, DNHM D2154, was also preserved in a sleeping posture. Although DNHM D2154 exhibits several juvenile-like features including free cervical ribs, unfused frontals and nasals, and a short snouted skull, other attributes, full fusion of all neurocentral synostoses and the sacrum, and dense exteriors to cortical bone, suggest a small, mature individual. Microscopic examination of tibia and fibula histology confirms maturity and suggests an individual greater than two years old with slowed growth. &quot;Mei&quot; is notable as a distinct species of troodontid based on several unique features, including extremely large nares. It is most closely related to the troodontid &quot;Sinovenator&quot;, which places it near the base of the troodontid (bird like) family. 

As a basal troodontid, unlike advanced troodontids, it has a bird like hip structure shared with many advanced maniraptorans.

==Palaeoecology==
&quot;Mei&quot; lived in the Early Aptian stage of the Cretaceous period, about 125.8 million years ago. At this time, the Liaoning area was dominated by numerous volcanoes in a landscape that was covered in coniferous forest, with an understory of ferns and other plants like large horsetails. Several other trees were present, such as ginkgos and araucarias. Some of the earliest flowering plants were also found here. Rivers and streams coming down from the flanks of the volcanoes fed into lakes in the valleys.

There were many species of small birdlike theropod dinosaurs living in the area, although most of them were slightly larger than &quot;Mei&quot;. This probably led to a lot of niche partitioning. There were only five or six species of herbivorous non-theropod dinosaurs, however, and a large and varied fauna of early mammals and pterosaurs. The apex predator was the 9-meter-long tyrannosauroid &quot;Yutyrannus&quot;, which would have preyed on the two or more species of sauropod. Often, volcanoes erupted, entombing animals in ash and suffocating others with carbon monoxide, which accounts for the high level of preservation of fossils.

&quot;Mei&quot; probably fed on small lizards and insects on the forest floor. It probably climbed trees as well to shelter from larger predators, and was probably not omnivorous. Judging by the length of the legs, it was a fast runner. Nothing is known about its nesting habits.

When the first fossil of &quot;Mei&quot; was discovered, scientists were charmed to see the fossil in a birdlike sleeping posture. &quot;Mei long&quot; means &#x27;sleeping dragon&#x27; in Chinese. The animal had probably died from carbon monoxide poisoning, then became entombed in ash.

<doc id="1342735" wikidata="Q652490" url="?curid=1342735" title="Argyle (pattern)">
<text>An argyle (, occasionally spelled argyll) pattern is made of diamonds or lozenges. The word is sometimes used to refer to an individual diamond in the design, but more commonly refers to the overall pattern. Most argyle contains layers of overlapping motifs, adding a sense of three-dimensionality, movement, and texture. Typically, there is an overlay of intercrossing diagonal lines on solid diamonds.

== History ==

The argyle pattern derives loosely from the tartan of Clan Campbell of Argyll in western Scotland, used for kilts and plaids, and from the patterned socks worn by Scottish Highlanders since at least the 17th century (these were generally known as &quot;tartan hose&quot;). Modern argyle patterns, however, are usually not true tartans, as they have two solid colours side-by-side, which is not possible in a tartan weave (solid colours in tartan are next to blended colours and only touch other solid colours at their corners).

=== 20th century ===
Argyle knitwear became fashionable in Great Britain and then in the United States after the First World War of 1914–1918. Pringle of Scotland popularised the design, helped by its identification with the Duke of Windsor. Pringle&#x27;s website says that &quot;the iconic Pringle argyle design was developed&quot; in the 1920s. The Duke, like others, used this pattern for golf clothing: both for jerseys and for the long socks needed for the plus-fours trouser fashion of the day. Bay-Area socialite Ethan Caflisch is widely believed to have popularized the sock design in the United States during the 1930s.

=== Contemporary use ===
Payne Stewart (1957–1999), who won the U.S. Open in 1991 and 1999 and the PGA championship in 1989, was known for his flashy tams, knickerbockers, and argyle socks.

Some sports teams use bright, contemporary interpretations of the argyle pattern. For example, the Norwegian men&#x27;s curling team at the 2010 Winter Olympics and the Garmin–Slipstream professional cycling team, nicknamed the &quot;Argyle Armada&quot;. On 27 April 2013 the professional soccer team Sporting Kansas City of Major League Soccer (MLS) in the United States announced their third kit of the 2013 season, featuring an argyle pattern. The University of North Carolina has used the argyle pattern for its basketball uniforms since 1991, and introduced it as alternate for all sports uniforms in 2015. The Belgian football team used such design in 1984, and has an updated version of it in 2018.

In popular culture, the argyle pattern is also used by the japanese mangaka Hirohiko Araki as a visual identity for its long-running Jojo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure series. 

== Knitting ==
As a knitting pattern, argyle is generally accomplished using the &quot;intarsia&quot; technique. Argyle patterns are occasionally woven.

<doc id="1342740" wikidata="Q1034942" url="?curid=1342740" title="Illinois Route 390">
<text>Illinois Route 390 (IL 390), previously known as the Elgin–O&#x27;Hare Expressway, now known as the Elgin–O&#x27;Hare Tollway, is a controlled-access toll road in northeastern Illinois. IL 390 currently connects U.S. Route 20 (US 20, Lake Street) in Hanover Park to the interchange with Illinois Route 83 (IL 83) and Thorndale Avenue in Wood Dale. The only other towns it borders are Schaumburg and Roselle. Construction is underway to extend the road from IL 83 to the western edge of O&#x27;Hare International Airport.

== Route description ==

IL 390 begins at an interchange with US 20 in Hanover Park and branches off northeastward as a six-lane toll road, traveling over a half-mile-long (0.8 km) bridge over the Metra Milwaukee District West Line tracks, and some wetlands. The highway then enters Cook County from DuPage County and has an interchange with IL 19 (Irving Park Road). At Meacham Road, the highway crosses back south into DuPage County. Continuing east for , IL 390 traverses portions of the suburbs of Schaumburg, Roselle, Medinah, Elk Grove Village, and then has an interchange with IL 53 before a major interchange with I-290 in Itasca. IL 390 continues east for through Wood Dale, Elk Grove Village (again), and Bensenville, and finally ends at an interchange with IL 83 in Bensenville just short of the west side of O&#x27;Hare International Airport. IL 390 was the first route in the state to have all-electronic toll collection, predating the 2021 conversion to all-electronic tolling on all Illinois State Toll Highway Authority roads; cash is not accepted, and an I-Pass/E-ZPass is required. The mileposts are measured from the planned western terminus in Elgin.

== History ==

Although the concept of an Elgin–O&#x27;Hare Expressway dates back to the 1960s, the highway was not seriously considered until the late 1980s. Around that time, congestion was rapidly increasing on local roads, especially US 20 (Lake Street). Although Lake Street was extensively widened prior to the completion of the highway, initially to Glen Ellyn Road and then to the Roselle-Bloomingdale border nearly ten years later, its capacity was still considered insufficient for the rapidly growing western suburbs. Construction on the highway began around 1991 and was completed two years later. Governor Jim Edgar opened the highway at an afternoon ceremony on November 2, 1993.

When the highway first opened, both of its termini had traffic signals with major arterial roads in the area. This arrangement caused large backups during weekday rush hours. According to the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT), average daily traffic counts (in 2003) for IL 390 are 39,600 vehicles for the western and around 82,000 to 87,000 cars per day for the remainder.

On October 29, 2013, IDOT announced that the highway was re-designated IL 390 at groundbreaking ceremonies for the Elgin–O’Hare Western Access Project. Shortly after, maintenance of the road was transferred to the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority (ISTHA), and toll collection on the existing segment from US 20 in Hanover Park to I-290 in Itasca began in 2016. ISTHA began constructing an eastward extension of IL 390 to a new interchange on the western border of O&#x27;Hare International Airport with the planned I-490 connecting I-90 to the north and I-294 to the south. This interchange may also incorporate ramps into a planned western terminal at O&#x27;Hare. The official groundbreaking for the expansion took place on October 29, 2013. The first segment of this extension, opened at a ribbon-cutting ceremony on November 1, 2017, stretching from the interchange with I-290 in Itasca to IL 83 in Bensenville. East of I-290, IL 390 was formerly a four-lane arterial at-grade road known as Thorndale Avenue until its conversion into an extension of IL 390, along with the interchange with I-290. Thorndale Avenue ran from I-290 to York Road near the western border of O&#x27;Hare International Airport. After its conversion, the Thorndale Avenue designation was assigned to the new frontage roads along both sides of the eastern extension of IL 390.

== Future ==
The remaining section of IL 390 from IL 83 in Bensenville to the western edge of O&#x27;Hare International Airport is currently under construction and is expected to open in 2026. , a feasibility study is underway on the western extension of IL 390 from US 20 to North Avenue in Bartlett, as well as changes to US 20 between North Avenue in Bartlett and Shales Parkway in Elgin. However, unlike the original plans, the entire extension is proposed to be an arterial road rather than a limited–access freeway or tollway.

<doc id="1342745" wikidata="Q2288966" url="?curid=1342745" title="Battle of Stoczek">
<text>The Battle of Stoczek was the first significant engagement between Russian and Polish forces during the Polish November Uprising. It took place on 14 February 1831 near the town of Stoczek Łukowski, near the Brest–Warsaw road. The Polish forces drove off two regiments of Russian mounted Jaegers, inflicting heavy casualties on them in the process.

==Background==
The Russian Army, commanded by Field Marshal Hans Karl von Diebitsch, entered Poland on 4 February and started an advance towards Warsaw. He also sent a mounted Jaeger division—2 brigades of 2 regiments, each consisting of 3 troops of 2 squadrons—into Poland on 13 February, with some 20 10-pounder guns of field artillery attached. Baron Teodor Geismar had assumed command of this detachment just 9 days earlier-a seasoned commander who had defended Russia during its invasion in 1812 at the hands of Napoleon Bonaparte, as well as fighting for Prussia during the earlier War of the Third Coalition, wherein his unit was destroyed during the Battle of Austerlitz, inspiring him to join the Russian Imperial Army.

Field Marshal Diebitsch&#x27;s strategy involved sending Geismar&#x27;s Corps to outflank any numerically inferior Polish forces while he advanced towards Warsaw with great speed from the direction of Lublin. This left a large gap between him and Geismar, however, who was approaching Warsaw with his troops along the Brest Road.
The Polish forces in the area managed to amass a division of 14 Uhlan squadrons-light cavalry armed with lances, sabres and pistols-, 3 infantry battalions and 6 3-pounder guns. Their commander was Brigadier General Józef Dwernicki-a veteran of the Polish-Austrian War who, incidentally, had fought for Napoleon during the French invasion of Russia and the Battle of Leipzig, during which time Napoleon himself had personally awarded Dwernicki the Golden Cross of the Legion of Honour for his service (it&#x27;s unknown whether or not Baron Geismar knew of this.) With approximately 4,700 men at arms including 2,200 cavalrymen, Dwernicki crossed the Vistula River on 10 February.

On the noon of February the 14th, Geismar received some information regarding the presence of the Polish troops near the town of Stoczek, deciding to launch an immediate attack and taking direct command of his 1st Brigade. Geismar left his 2nd Brigade, made up primarily of mounted Jaeger Regiments from Arzamas and Tiraspol, including the Riga Dragoon Regiment of Duke Alexander of Württemberg, behind as support troops with half of his division&#x27;s artillery (10 guns).

The then-CO major of Geismar&#x27;s 1st Brigade was General Pashkov, whom Geismar put in supreme command of another mounted Jaeger regiment from Pereyaslavl, organised into 3 Troops, and gave 4 guns. Pashkov was to approach Stoczek from north-east, while Geismar took his own cavalry and the remaining 6 guns on an eastern road to the town. The forested terrain forced their troops to march down narrow woodland roads, and further separated the Russian forces.

Dwernicki kept a strong watch despite already having settled his forces for the night, and was informed by fellow Poles of the approaching Russians well in advance. Dwernicki took his troops out to the field north of Stoczek, putting his guns in-line from east to west and his infantry in square formations on the flanks, one leaning on the thick forest to the west of his position. He then divided his Uhlans and sent them out to the south and north of his line, covering all and any directions the enemy might approach from. The large gap between Field Marshal Diebitsch and Geismar&#x27;s troops had resulted in a loss of contact between the two, meaning the Field Marshal would be unable to cover Geismar&#x27;s cavalry or artillery should it come under attack. Dwernicki, already a seasoned commander, utilised this, as well as the darkness and cover of the forest, to set an ambush.

==&quot;Battle&quot;==
Pashkov&#x27;s Pereyaslavl Regiment was the first to reach the field, arriving from the north-east in the early twilight hours, and immediately came under fire from Dwernicki&#x27;s artillery. Pashkov put his guns in-line under the shelling and dismounted the 1st Troop of Jaegers to protect them from the Polish cavalry, then ordered the 2nd Troop to engage the northern detachment of Dwernicki&#x27;s Uhlans. When the Russian and Polish cavalry met, the 2nd Troop retreated toward Geismar&#x27;s position almost immediately. The 3rd Troop, still mounted, followed, leaving Pashkov and his 1st Troop at the mercy of the Polish Uhlans. This initial clash was over so quickly that General Pashkov&#x27;s artillery hadn&#x27;t yet returned fire.

By the time Geismar arrived from the east, Dwernicki&#x27;s cavalry was approaching his position. Unaware of the fate of Pashkov&#x27;s troops, Geismar put his guns in-line facing north and prepared to send his Regiment&#x27;s own Mounted Jaegers into battle, but was then met with Pashkov&#x27;s retreating 2nd and 3rd Troops, who were caught between Geismar&#x27;s forces and the advancing Polish Uhlans, slowing Geismar&#x27;s counterattack.

Morale was already waning amongst Geismar&#x27;s cavalry when he finally sent them into battle, and they too were routed by the Polish cavalry. Having been taken completely by surprise, and deeply shocked by the cowardice of his soldiers, Geismar attempted to take personal command of the retreating cavalry, but the battle was already lost. The retreating Russians left Baron Geismar and some of his officers at the field, who were pursued by the invigorated Polish cavalry.

==Aftermath==
===Poles===

General Pashkov had managed to return fire despite his initial losses, and Geismar&#x27;s forces had put up somewhat of a fight, resulting in 46 Polish soldiers killed and 59 wounded-nowhere near the Russian losses. The Polish celebrated the victory, alongside which they had achieved the honour of being the first in history to rout Russian regular cavalry regiments, with some Russians 280 killed, 230 taken prisoner and 8 Russian cannons lost.

The battle of Stoczek was the first Polish victory during the November Uprising, and had a tremendous effect on Polish morale. A week-long celebration complete with firework displays was held in Warsaw, the ecstatic Poles particularly parroting the fact that Dwernicki had defeated Geismar, celebrated by the Russians as their then-greatest vanguard commander and a veteran and war hero of the Russo-Turkish War (1828–29).

Despite all of this, and despite Field Marshal Diebitsch&#x27;s later defeat by Polish General Jan Skrzynecki at the Battle of Wawer, the Polish victory at Stoczek did little to slow the Russian advance towards Warsaw.

===Russians===

Geismar and General Pashkov survived the attack, perhaps purely by chance, and Geismar himself officially wrote to Field Marshal Diebitsch that his soldiers were &quot;just struck with a sudden panic-attack&quot;, but expressed great concern in a private letter to his friend Colonel Anrep regarding the general moral and military capability of the Regiment. Geismar bitterly described a waning faith in the virtues of the Russian Soldier and army, which Geismar had admired until that day, and reported that he had vastly overestimated the moral of his troops-&quot;If I would only have been aware of the moral state of my men at the time I launched the operation—surely, I wouldn&#x27;t dare to attack Dwernicki&#x27;s troops at all, not to discuss &#x27;in such a position.&quot;.

The battle of Stoczek would become known as Geismar&#x27;s greatest military mistake, and Anrep himself soon after took charge of Geismar&#x27;s mounted Jaeger Regiment. Tzar Nicholas I of Russia disbanded mounted Jaegers as the primary form of cavalry in the Russian Imperial Army in 1883, and soldiers fitting said description were sent to other cavalry regiments in accordance with the hue of their horses.

<text>SS &quot;Atlantic&quot; was a transatlantic ocean liner of the White Star Line, and second ship of the Oceanic-class. The ship operated between Liverpool, United Kingdom, and New York City, United States. During the ship&#x27;s 19th voyage, on 1 April 1873, she struck rocks and sank off the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada, killing at least 535 people. It remained the deadliest civilian maritime disaster in the North Atlantic Ocean until the sinking of on 2 July 1898 and the greatest disaster for the White Star Line prior to the sinking of the in April 1912.

==History==

&quot;Atlantic&quot; was built by Harland and Wolff in Belfast in 1870, as one of the four liners. The other vessels were , and . She was the second ship of the class. The four liners were built for the newly created Oceanic Steam Navigation Company, commonly referred to as the White Star Line. Her primary propulsion was a four cylinder compound condensing steam engine producing driving a single propeller giving her a speed of . The engines were made by George Forrester and Company at the Vauxhall foundry, Liverpool. To communicate from the bridge to the engine room she was fitted with a telegraph. Steering was by Forrester&#x27;s steam steering apparatus, as fitted to .

For auxiliary propulsion she was rigged as a four-masted barque. With a length of between perpendiculars ( overall) and a beam of , she was slim with an aspect ratio of 1:10. &quot;Atlantic&quot; had a depth of hold of and was 3,707 tons register. She had three decks and five bulkheads extending from keelson to maindeck.

The four sister ships were luxurious with a standard unseen on any previous vessel. Two classes of accommodation were available. Cabin class was amidships with a saloon measuring long and the full of the ship&#x27;s beam. The staterooms were forward of the saloon with provision for four berth en suite accommodation as well as double cabins. The lavatories were provided with running water and the bathrooms had water heated by steam when required. Cabin class passengers were free to come on deck. There was also provision for 1,000 steerage passengers. Single males were housed forward of the cabin class area, aft of cabin class was reserved for single females and married couples. Steerage class passengers did not have access to the decks.

She sailed for New York City on her maiden voyage on 8 June 1871. For her return trip (starting on 1 July 1871) she was advertised for all classes as being &quot;unrivalled in safety, speed and comfort&quot;. She carried &quot;surgeons and stewardesses&quot;. &quot;Atlantic&quot; completed 18 crossings with no problems other than a minor incident on November 23, 1871, when she was hit by SS &quot;Alexandria&quot;.

==Disaster==
===Concern over coal===
On 20 March 1873, &quot;Atlantic&quot; departed on her 19th voyage from Liverpool with 952 people on board, of whom 835 were passengers, and 14 stowaways. En route, the ship encountered heavy seas and gale force headwinds, which slowed her progress to a crawl. The ship&#x27;s engines had to work harder than normal to maintain forward progress, and this resulted in increased coal consumption. The captain, James Williams, became increasingly concerned that they would run out of coal for the boilers before reaching New York. They in fact had more than enough remaining fuel, but unbeknown to the captain, the ship&#x27;s engineer John Foxley had been deliberately under-reporting coal reserves in order to err on the side of caution and encourage economical use of the remaining reserves, which was a common practice on ships at the time. On the 11th day of the voyage, Foxley gave an estimate to the captain that there were 129 tons of coal remaining, when at least 140 tons would have been needed for the two days sailing to New York, some away, consuming 70 tons per day. Foxley was aware that this figure was an underestimate, but did not wish to admit that his previous estimations had been inaccurate. Thus convinced they were short of coal—and unable to hoist sail as a backup because of the strong headwind—the captain decided to divert to Halifax, Nova Scotia, to refuel, as this was much closer ( distant) and it was a common practice for ships low on coal reserves to call there, although this was the first time that a White Star ship had attempted to do so, and none of the ship&#x27;s mates had any firsthand knowledge of the approaches to Halifax harbour.

===Diversion to Halifax===

During the approach to Halifax on the evening of 31 March, the captain and third officer were on the bridge until midnight while &quot;Atlantic&quot; made her way through a storm, proceeding at for the entrance of Halifax Harbour, experiencing intermittent visibility and heavy seas. Unbeknownst to the crew or passengers, winds and currents had put &quot;Atlantic&quot; off-course to the west of the harbour. On the approach to harbour, Captain Williams decided to sleep, and put the ship in command of the Second Mate Henry Ismay Metcalfe, with instruction that he be awoken at 3 am. It had been the captain&#x27;s intention for the ship to heave to until daylight after 3 am; however, his instruction to be woken was not carried out. Because almost none of the crew had ever been to Halifax before, they were unaware of the dangers of the approach; no one took soundings, posted a masthead lookout, or reduced speed, as they approached the unfamiliar coast. Because they were so far off-course, they did not spot the Sambro Lighthouse, the large landfall lighthouse which warns sailors of the rocky shoals to the west of the harbour entrance. As the night wore on without any sight of the lighthouse, the ship&#x27;s quartermaster Robert Thomas—the only crew member familiar with Halifax—became convinced that something was wrong, especially when the lighthouse did not come into view. He relayed his concerns to both Metcalfe, and the Fourth Mate John Brown, and advised that the ship should heave to. However, the officers dismissed his concerns.

===Striking the rocks===
At 3:15 a.m. local time on 1 April 1873, the lookout spotted the white foam of breaking waves and shouted &quot;Breakers ahead! Breakers ahead!&quot;. The crew immediately attempted to take evasive action and place the engines into reverse. However, these measures were too little, too late, and &quot;Atlantic&quot; struck an underwater rock off Marr&#x27;s Head, Meagher&#x27;s Island (now Mars Head, Mars Island), Nova Scotia. &quot;Atlantic&quot; rode up onto the rocky ledge at near full speed, coming to a complete stop, and was pounded on the rocks several times, shattering some iron hull plates, before slipping backward and heeling to starboard. The ship rapidly filled with water and partially capsized, gradually settling on the shallow seabed, and heeling over to an ever-increasing angle. All 10 lifeboats were lowered by the crew but were all washed away or smashed against rocks. Distress rockets were fired into the air every minute, but this did not bring any results. Many of the disaster victims were trapped inside the ship as it filled with water. Part of the ship remained above the water, where it was pounded by waves, and many of those who made their way out onto the deck clung to the ship for as long as they could, but were eventually swept away by the waves washing over it; one passenger reported seeing a mass of heads in the water so dense that he thought it was cargo floating in the sea. Others climbed up onto the rigging and clung on as long as they could; however, most of these were overcome by exposure and eventually died there or fell into the sea.
Many people survived due to the bravery of the Third Mate, Cornelius Brady, and the quartermasters John Speakman and Edward Owens, who swam to shore with a rope and rigged up lines, via a rock to the shore. By dawn, five such lines had been rigged, and this was responsible for saving many lives. Many of those who survived swam or climbed the ropes, first to a wave-swept rock and then to a barren shore. By 6 am, Brady had made contact with the local residents of the tiny fishing villages of Lower Prospect and Terence Bay, and they sent out three boats to rescue people from the rock and those who remained clinging to the ship itself. The rescue operation continued until midday when all still alive had been rescued.

However, at least 535 people died, leaving only 429 survivors. The ship&#x27;s manifest indicates that of the 952 aboard, 156 were women and 189 were children (including two who had been born during the voyage). All women and children perished except for one twelve-year-old boy, John Hindley. Ten crew members were lost, while 131 survived. This was the worst civilian loss of life in the North Atlantic until the wreck of on 2 July 1898.

===Aftermath===
====Recovery of the dead====

Recovery and burial of the large numbers of victims took weeks. Divers were paid rewards for recovering the many bodies trapped within the hull. A diving company from New York sent equipment to the wreckage to salvage as much as possible of ship and cargo, and to recover the bodies of the drowned. On 11 May 1873, the Norwegian newspaper Morgenbladet reported that they had blown open the wreck, and had recovered lots of goods, and 349 bodies.

Several newspapers reported that a body of one of the crew members known as Bill was discovered to have been assigned female at birth. &quot;She was about twenty or twenty-five years old and had served as a common sailor for three voyages, and her sex was never known until the body was washed ashore and prepared for burial. She is described as having been a great favorite with all her shipmates, and one of the crew, speaking of her, remarked: &quot;I didn&#x27;t know Bill was a woman. He used to take his grog as regular as any of us, and was always begging or stealing tobacco. He was a good fellow, though, and I am sorry he was a woman.&quot; 
277 of the victims were buried in a mass grave at St. Paul&#x27;s Anglican Cemetery in Terence Bay, whilst another 150 were interred at the nearby Star of the Sea Roman Catholic Cemetery in Lower Prospect.

====Enquiries====
There were two enquiries into the disaster. The first, by the Canadian government, was highly critical of Captain Williams, mainly on the grounds that he had failed to take frequent soundings on the approach to Halifax, and concluded with the statement, &quot;the conduct of Captain Williams in the management of his ship during the twelve or fourteen hours preceding the disaster, was so gravely at variance with what ought to have been the conduct of a man placed in his responsible position.&quot; However, he did not have his Masters certificate withdrawn, due to his efforts at saving lives during the disaster. Instead, it was suspended for two years. The White Star Line was also criticised, due to allegedly not providing sufficient coal, something which the company denied. The enquiry stated: &quot;The inference seems inevitable that she had not sufficient coals on board when sailing for a ship of her class.&quot;

The second enquiry was held by the British Board of Trade, which at first concluded that a shortage of coal had contributed to the disaster. However, after an appeal by the White Star Line, this was revisited, and a careful analysis showed that &quot;Atlantic&quot; did indeed have sufficient coal for the journey to New York. The report concluded with: &quot;We are satisfied that the steamship &quot;Atlantic&quot; on her last voyage was supplied with sufficient coal for a voyage to New York at that season of the year. And, that at the time the vessel&#x27;s course was altered for Halifax, there still remained sufficient coal to have taken her to New York and to leave 70 tons in the bunkers, even if the weather did not improve.&quot;

Mr. Foxley had in fact estimated that at least 150 to 160 tons remained; however, his professional pride and desire not to admit to giving incorrect estimates to the captain led him to submit the lower figure, which set off the chain of events which led to the disaster.

==Legacy==

&quot;Atlantic&quot; was the second liner commissioned by White Star Line ( being first) but carried the notoriety of being the first White Star steamer to sink (the company had previously lost the clipper in Dublin Bay in 1854). Other White Star ships lost in the North Atlantic include in 1893, in 1909, and in 1912. The financial losses caused by the loss of &quot;Atlantic&quot; forced the White Star Line to sell two of their ships to raise capital, the &quot;Tropic&quot; and &quot;Asiatic&quot;.

Most of the ship lies heavily fragmented under of water. Artifacts recovered from several salvage operations are on display at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax, Nova Scotia and also at the SS Atlantic Heritage Park and Interpretation Centre, in Terence Bay, Nova Scotia. A monument to the wreck, donated by ship owner Thomas Henry Ismay&#x27;s family, is located at the mass grave near the interpretation centre in the Terence Bay Anglican Cemetery, while a smaller monument marks a second mass grave at the Catholic cemetery.

The 1929 film &quot;Atlantic&quot; was originally named &quot;Titanic&quot;, made only seventeen years after the sinking of that ship. After lawsuits from the White Star Line, the movie was released under the title &quot;Atlantic&quot;, although the film is unrelated to the earlier White Star Line disaster.

P. G. Wodehouse wrote a story in 1921 called &quot;The Girl on the Boat&quot; in which six chapters of the romance take place on a White Star liner named &quot;Atlantic&quot;, crossing from New York to Southampton.

The dead biologically-female sailor was inspiration for the 2022 graphic novel &quot;Call Me Bill&quot; by a member of the family of one of the rescuers.

<text>The Chelyadnin family (Челяднины) were an old and influential Russian boyar family who served the Grand Princes of Moscow in high and influential positions. They were descended from Ratsha, court servant (tiun) to Prince Vsevolod II of Kiev.

==History==
===Ancestry===
The Chelyadnins were descended from Ratsha, court servant (tiun) to Prince Vsevolod II of Kiev and the oppressive manager of serfs in Kiev. Several other Russian noble families are also descended from Ratsha, including the Pushkin, Aminoff, Buturlin, Kuritsyn, Kamensky families.

Ratsha&#x27;s great-grandson Gavrila Aleksich was a boyar under the famed Alexander Nevsky and played an important role in the Battle of Neva. Gavrila Aleksich&#x27;s son Akinf Gavrilovich the Great was a boyar under two Grand Princes of Vladimir, Andrey of Gorodets and Mikhail of Tver. The founder of the Chelyadnin family was Mikhail Andreevich Chelyadnya, son of Akinf and seventh-generation descendant of Ratsha.

===Rise to power===
Mikhail Andreevich Chelyadnya&#x27;s son, Ivan Mikhailovich Chelyadnin, married Princess Elena Yuryevna Patrikeeva, grand daughter of Grand Prince Vasily I. In the 14th, 15th and early 16th centuries, the Chelyadnins often occupied one of the highest positions at court. They often became boyars , bypassing the stage of Okolnichiy . The family went extinct in the 16th century when Tsar Ivan the Terrible executed Ivan Petrovich Fedorov-Chelyadnin, an influential boyar belonging to the Daydov-Khromy branch of the Chelyadnin family. Subsequently, the Oprichniks under the Tsar looted and thoroughly destroyed all the vast Chelyadnin estates, and all close relatives and servants of Ivan Petrovich were brutally killed.

== Notable Chelyadnins ==
Boyar Andrey Fyodorovich Chelyadnin (?-1503), the first of Chelyadnins who gained the title of konyushy, governor (наместник, namestnik) of Novgorod. He was Commander-in-Chief during the Russo-Swedish War (1495–1497). In 1500 he defeated the Lithuanians at the Lovat River and captured the city of Toropets.

Boyar Ivan Andreyevich Chelyadnin (?-1514), konyushy at the court of Vasili III of Russia, voyevoda (1508–1509). He took part in a number of battles with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, after the defeat of Russia at the Battle of Orsha he was taken into captivity and died in a prison in Vilnius.

Boyar Ivan Petrovich Fedorov-Chelyadnin (1500s- September 11, 1568), became boyar in 1550, &quot;de facto&quot; head of the Zemshchina Boyar Duma and held the rank of Equerry (head of the chancellery of the Tsar&#x27;s stables). He was an influential and wealthy boyar known for his honesty. Tsar Ivan the Terrible was informed that the elderly boyar supposedly intended to overthrow him from the throne and become tsar himself. Alexander Guagnini reported that Ivan ordered him to put on royal clothes, put him on the throne, bowed, and then stabbed him in the heart, after which the rest of the guardsmen attacked and stabbed the body of Fedorov-Chelyadnin. After his death, all the vast Chelyadnin estates were looted and thoroughly destroyed, and all close relatives and servants of Ivan Petrovich were brutally killed.

<doc id="1342776" wikidata="Q892343" url="?curid=1342776" title="Lidsville">
<text>Lidsville is an American television show created by brothers Sid and Marty Krofft. It was their third series, following &quot;H.R. Pufnstuf&quot; (1969) and &quot;The Bugaloos&quot; (1970). As did its predecessors, &quot;Lidsville&quot; combined two types of characters: conventional actors in makeup taped alongside performers in full mascot costumes, whose voices were dubbed in post-production. Seventeen episodes aired on Saturday mornings on ABC during 1971–1973. The show was rebroadcast on NBC Saturday mornings the following season.

The opening was shot at Six Flags Over Texas. Otherwise, the show was shot at Paramount Pictures film studio in Los Angeles.

==Production==
Like predecessors &quot;H.R. Pufnstuf&quot; and &quot;The Bugaloos&quot;, &quot;Lidsville&quot; ran for only one season (1971–1972), with reruns airing the following year (1972–1973).

Like most children&#x27;s television shows of its era, &quot;Lidsville&quot; contained a laugh track.

==Plot==
The show involved a teenage boy named Mark (portrayed by Butch Patrick) who fell into the top hat of Merlo the Magician (portrayed by Charles Nelson Reilly) (HooDoo&#x27;s alter ego), following Merlo&#x27;s show at Six Flags Over Texas. Inside the hat, he arrived in Lidsville, a land of living hats that are depicted as having the same characteristics as the humans who would normally wear them. For example, a cowboy hat would act and speak like a cowboy. The characters&#x27; houses were also hat-shaped.
The villain of the show was magician Horatio J. HooDoo (also portrayed by Reilly). The vain, short-tempered, but somewhat naive HooDoo flew around in his Hatamaran, blasting the good citizens of Lidsville with bolts of magic (referred to as &quot;zapping&quot;) and keeping them in fear, demanding that they pay him their Hat Tax. Mark was seen as a suspected spy against HooDoo on behalf of the good hat people and was captured at Derby Dunes by HooDoo&#x27;s minions the Bad Hats the moment he had fallen into the world of Lidsville. He escapes from his clutches alongside a genie named Weenie (Billie Hayes). Mark helped the good hats resist as he attempted to find a way back home. HooDoo, trying to reclaim control of Weenie the Genie from Mark, often enlisted the services of four Bad Hats.

In his high hat home, HooDoo was constantly besieged by the taunting music of his Hat Band, as well as all of his talking knickknacks (Parrot, Mr. Skull, mounted alligator head, the sawed-in-half lady, etc.). HooDoo also experienced further aggravation at the hands of his aides, the dimwitted Raunchy Rabbit and his two-faced card guard Jack of Clubs. HooDoo watched the action going on in downtown Lidsville from his hat home by using his Evil Eye, a device similar to a TV set that resembled an eyeball. He also had a hot chatline phone. The show relied on an endless array of puns based on hats. One such pun was &quot;Derby Dunes&quot;, an area in Lidsville which sand dunes were shaped like derby hats.

Many of the episodes were about Mark trying to get back home, but the evil HooDoo prevented him from leaving. Weenie, being a nervous bumbler, was in fact a genie, but many of the tricks and spells did not work correctly after having been HooDoo&#x27;s captive for so long.

In the show&#x27;s final episode, scenes from some of the past episodes were featured as HooDoo&#x27;s mother (portrayed by an uncredited Muriel Landers) had paid a visit to find out what has been going on in Lidsville while making sure that her son is still bad.

As the show only ran one season of original episodes, Mark never returned home—his fate remained unresolved.

Music was also a part of the show, with songs being performed by the characters in several episodes.

* At the beginning of &quot;Jose Chung&#x27;s &#x27;Doomsday Defense&#x27;&quot;, an episode of &quot;Millennium&quot;, the writer Chung (played by Charles Nelson Reilly), mentions that he had a part in a &quot;brilliant, award-winning film&quot; as a small clip of HooDoo is played on-screen.

===Film===
On January 31, 2011, it was announced that DreamWorks Animation was adapting &quot;Lidsville&quot; to make a 3-D animated musical. The feature would be directed by Conrad Vernon, and the music would be composed by Alan Menken, known for composing multiple musical scores for Walt Disney Animation Studios films. Menken stated that, &quot;The songs will be an homage to &#x27;60s psychedelic concept-album rock.&quot; In January 2013, he posted on Twitter that &quot;&quot;Lidsville&quot; is underway... Finally.&quot; The lyrics would be written by Glenn Slater, a frequent Menken collaborator. In June 2016, Sid Krofft said in an interview about the project: &quot;It was going to be like &quot;Hair&quot; or &quot;Tommy&quot;, a full-blown musical. But they went in a strange direction and it just didn&#x27;t work.&quot;

<doc id="1342783" wikidata="Q7794661" url="?curid=1342783" title="Thomas Vander Wal">
<text>Thomas Vander Wal is an information architect best known for coining the term &quot;folksonomy&quot;. He is also known for initiating the term &quot;infocloud&quot;. His work has primarily dealt with the Web and with information design and structure especially in the context of social technology.

== Personal ==
Vander Wal attended high school at Lincoln High School in Stockton (California, USA), then went on to get his BA in communication at Saint Mary&#x27;s College of California in Moraga. He has also attended the Center for Medieval Renaissance Studies at Oxford and holds a MPP from Georgetown University’s Public Policy Institute.

He currently lives in Bethesda, Maryland.

== Concepts ==
=== Folksonomy ===
Vander Wal is credited with coining the term “folksonomy’ in 2004. Folksonomy is sometimes called collaborative tagging, social classification, social indexing, or social tagging. It refers to taxonomies created by users applying their own tags to pieces of information (including articles, pictures, and websites). The tags aid users in categorizing information for both personal management and sharing with others. These user generated taxonomies stand in contrast to professionally created ontologies and taxonomies used for resource discovery and retrieval in more traditional knowledge organization systems.

=== Personal InfoCloud ===
The Personal InfoCloud is the information that a user collects, organizes, and carries with them, a bit like your personal slice of the web. Instead of focusing on very large and relatively public social spaces on the internet, the Personal InfoCloud represents a desire to use the internet to connect to a small group of people on a more personal level, and keep specific information accessible to that group. The point here is that the information needs to be accessible to the user in a very short amount of time. Thus, aggregation, personal organization and portability all flow from the need for accessibility. Vander Wal links the Personal InfoCloud to concepts like personal archiving, information overload, and what he calls the “Come to Me Web”.

=== Model of Attraction ===
Much of his work, including the Personal InfoCloud and folksonomies, is undergirded by what he calls the Model of Attraction. MoA is a metaphor, much like navigation or sense of smell, that helps information architects and web developers think about the way that users interact with information. To think about MoA in relation to folksonomies, certain terms are associated with different pieces of information. The strength of the association can be visualized as a magnetic field, bringing certain kinds of information around a term. When a user searches on that term, they enter into the magnetic field. To think about MoA in relation to the Personal InfoCloud, a user’s associated information and interests create a similar magnetic field, which draws pertinent information to them, and keeps it around them.

==Professional experience==
Vander Wal works at InfoCloud Solutions as the Principal and Senior Consultant. InfoClouds Solutions is Vander Wal’s consulting company that advises on the range of digital content/media, folksonomy/tagging, social web, and personal to social information use and reuse.

He is a columnist at KM World, writes on his own blog “Off the Top” and he has worked for the INDUS Corporation in Bethesda, Maryland, is a member of the Founding Leadership Council for The Information Architecture Institute, and the Steering Committee for the Web Standards Project (WaSP). He is also the Alumni Tech Lead for &quot;Boxes and Arrows&quot; magazine.

He spoke at the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies Web convention in January 2008.

<text>is a financial holding company and a principal member of the Nomura Group, which is Japan&#x27;s largest investment bank and brokerage group. It, along with its broker-dealer, banking and other financial services subsidiaries, provides investment, financing and related services to individual, institutional, and government customers on a global basis with an emphasis on securities businesses.

==History==
===Origins===
The history of Nomura began on December 25, 1925, when Nomura Securities Co., Ltd. (NSC) was established in Osaka, as a spin-off from Securities Dept. of Osaka Nomura Bank Co., Ltd (the present day Resona Bank). NSC initially focused on the bond market. It was named after its founder Tokushichi Nomura II, a wealthy Japanese businessman and investor. He had earlier established Osaka Nomura bank in 1918, based on the Mitsui zaibatsu model with a capital of ¥10 million. Like the majority of Japanese conglomerates, or zaibatsu, its origins were in Osaka, but today operates out of Tokyo. NSC gained the authority to trade stock in 1938, and went public in 1961.

===Lehman Brothers acquisition===
In October 2008, Nomura acquired most of Lehman Brothers&#x27; Asian operations together with its European equities and investment banking units to make one of the world&#x27;s largest independent investment banks with ¥20,300bn (£138bn) assets under management. In April 2009, the global headquarters for investment banking was moved out of Tokyo to London as part of a strategy to move the company&#x27;s focus from Japan to global markets, with Josh Tokley appointed Head of UK Investments. Following his subsequent suspension, Tokley was replaced by Michael Coombs.

Nomura paid $225 million for the purchase of Lehman&#x27;s Asia-Pacific unit. Due to large losses with shares dropping to their lowest level in nearly 37 years, Nomura cut around 5 percent of its staff in Europe (as many as 500 people) in mid-September 2011.

===Greentech acquisition===

In December 2019, Nomura announced that it would acquire Greentech Capital Advisors, a boutique investment bank with stated aims of assisting clients across sustainable technology and infrastructure. The transaction is expected to close on March 31, 2020.

Greentech will be rebranded to &quot;Nomura Greentech&quot; and will form part of their Investment Banking franchise in the U.S.

== Nomura Securities ==

Nomura Securities Co., Ltd. is a Japanese financial services company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Nomura Holdings, Inc. (NHI), which forms part of the Nomura Group. It plays a central role in the securities business, the group&#x27;s core business. Nomura is a financial services group and global investment bank. Based in Tokyo, Japan, with regional headquarters in Hong Kong, London, and New York, Nomura employs about 26,000 staff worldwide; it is known as Nomura Securities International in the US, and Nomura International plc. in EMEA. It operates through five business divisions: retail (in Japan), global markets, investment banking, merchant banking, and asset management.

Established December 25, 1925 in Osaka, it is the oldest brokerage firm in Japan. It is named after its founder Tokushichi Nomura II, a wealthy Japanese businessman and investor.

===History===
====Background (before 1925)====
Nomura was founded by Tokushichi Nomura, father of Nomura Securities founder Tokushichi Nomura II as a money changing business. This was just before the Meiji Restoration, the move to setting up a bank was a logical extension and progression of this business as times changed. Changes included the founding of stock exchanges in Tokyo and Osaka as the country became industrialised. Key amongst these changes was the Japanese government&#x27;s decision to issue foreign currency denominated public bonds to fund the Russo-Japanese War; Nomura employed English speaking staff so that they could take on this international business.

By 1906 Nomura had founded an in-house research department headed up by former Osaka newspaper journalist Kisaku Hashimoto. This was responsible for publishing the Osaka Nomura Business News with trading news, stock analysis and current economic trends. Research combined with a substantial newspaper advertising campaign helped raise the profile of Nomura. By 1917, Nomura had gone public and soon after Osaka Nomura Bank (the present day Resona Bank) was set up, within this business there was a securities section to handle bond sales and underwriting.

<doc id="1342795" wikidata="Q3234952" url="?curid=1342795" title="Lion's Head (food)">
<text>Lion&#x27;s Head () or stewed meatball is a dish from the Huaiyang cuisine of eastern China, consisting of large pork meatballs or beef meatballs stewed with vegetables. There are two varieties: white (or plain), and red (紅燒, cooked with soy sauce). The plain variety is usually stewed or steamed with napa cabbage. The red variety can be stewed with cabbage or cooked with bamboo shoots and tofu derivatives. The minced meat rich in fat is more likely to bring better texture, addition of chopped water chestnut also works.

The name &quot;lion&#x27;s head&quot;, derives from the shape of the meatball which is supposed to resemble the head of the Chinese guardian lion, specifically.

The dish originated in Yangzhou and Zhenjiang, to a lesser degree, Huai&#x27;an, while the plain variety is more common in Yangzhou and the red variety more common in Zhenjiang. The dish became a part of Shanghai cuisine with the influx of migrants in the 19th and 20th centuries.

The dish can also be prepared with beef or be made as a vegetarian dish.

== History ==
The dish has been well known since the Qing dynasty, as the recipe extracted from Xu Ke&#x27;s &quot;Qing bai lei chao&quot; () attests:獅子頭者，以形似而得名，豬肉圓也。豬肉肥瘦各半，細切粗斬，乃和以蛋白，使易凝固，或加蝦仁、蟹粉。以黃沙罐一，底置黃芽菜或竹筍，略和以水及鹽，以肉作極大之圓，置其上，上覆菜葉，以罐蓋蓋之，乃入鐵鍋，撒鹽少許，以防鍋裂，然後以文火乾燒之。每燒數柴把一停，約越五分時更燒之，候熟取出。 (Lion&#x27;s head, is a pork meatball, its shape just as its name implies. The proportion of fat to lean pork is fifty-fifty, chop up them, then mix them with egg whites so that the mixture can coagulate easily. The shrimp meat or crab powder is an optional ingredient to mix. Put napa cabbage or bamboo shoots on the bottom of a clay pot, pour a little water and dissolve the salt in it. Make the meatballs as big as possible, put them in, then put leaves above the meatballs and put the lid on the pot. Place the pot in a wok filled with salt water, to avoid cracking in this way, cook over a gentle heat. stoke enough firewood at intervals, when the meat is medium, burn the wok fiercely until the meat is well done.)Earlier, a salt merchant from Yangzhou called Tong Yuejian () who lived in the mid-Qing recorded a dish, &quot;dadian rouyuan&quot; (), in his concise cookbook &quot;Tiaoding ji&quot; ():取肋條肉去皮切細長條粗㓠，加豆粉少許作料，用手松捺不可搓，或油炸，或蒸，襯用嫩青。The significant resemblance between the both dished indicates that the latter may be the prototype of the former, which is acceptable. It is said to date back to Sui dynasty in myth and folklore, but there is no evidence to support such a theory so far.

== Types ==

=== Stewed meatballs with crab powder ===
This type is deemed to be the traditional one, its ingredients and procedure changed a little from the dish mentioned above. 
* Pork Ribs (proportion of fat and lean pork: 7:3)
* Crab Roe
* Crab Meat
* Napa Cabbage
* Shrimp
* Shaohsing Wine
* Salt
* Infusion of garlic and scallions
* Starch
* Pork Stock

== In literature ==
* Liang Shih-chiu&#x27;s essay, &quot;Lion&#x27;s Head&quot;. Liang thought the dish is from Yangzhou cuisine, while its northern counterpart is &quot;Sixi wanzi&quot;, Braised Pork Balls in Gravy.
* Wang Zengqi&#x27;s essay &quot;Roushizhe bubi&quot; (). Wang classified the dish as Huai&#x27;an cuisine. He wrote that Lion&#x27;s head is &quot;fluffy but not loose&quot;, and &quot;that is the difference from &quot;Sixi wanzi&quot;&quot;. Besides, Wang mentioned that Zhou Enlai could cook this dish since he hailed from Huai&#x27;an.

<doc id="1342802" wikidata="Q1192278" url="?curid=1342802" title="Wedding invitation">
<text>A wedding invitation is a letter asking the recipient to attend a wedding. It is typically written in the formal, third-person language and mailed five to eight weeks before the wedding date.

Like any other invitation, it is the privilege and duty of the host—historically, for younger brides in Western culture, the mother of the bride, on behalf of the bride&#x27;s family—to issue invitations, either by sending them herself or causing them to be sent, either by enlisting the help of relatives, friends, or her social secretary to select the guest list and address envelopes, or by hiring a service. With computer technology, some are able to print directly on envelopes from a guest list using a mail merge with word processing and spreadsheet software.

== History ==

=== The Middle Ages and before ===
Prior to the invention of the moveable-type printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in 1447, weddings in England were typically announced by means of a Town crier: a man who would walk through the streets announcing in a loud voice the news of the day. Traditionally, anyone within earshot became part of the celebration.

In the Middle Ages, illiteracy was widespread among common people, so the practice of sending written wedding invitations emerged among the nobility. Families of means would commission monks, skilled in the art of calligraphy, to hand-craft their notices.

Such documents often carried the coat of arms, or personal crest, of the individual and were sealed with wax.

=== From 1600 onward ===
Despite the emergence of the printing press, the ordinary printing techniques of the time, in which ink was simply stamped onto the paper using lead type, produced too poor a result for stylish invitations. However, the tradition of announcing weddings in the newspaper did become established at this time.

In 1642, the invention of metal-plate engraving (or mezzotint) by Ludwig von Siegen brought higher-quality wedding invitations within the reach of the emerging middle class. Engraving, as the name implies, requires an artisan to &quot;hand write&quot; the text in reverse onto a metal plate using a carving tool, and the plate was then used to print the invitation. The resulting engraved invitations were protected from smudging by a sheet of tissue paper placed on top, which is a tradition that remains to this day.

At the time, the wording of wedding invitations was more elaborate than today; typically, the name of each guest was individually printed on the invitation.

=== The Industrial Revolution ===
Following the invention of lithography by Alois Senefelder in 1798, it became possible to produce very sharp and distinctive inking without the need for engraving. This paved the way for the emergence of a genuine mass-market in wedding invitations.

Wedding invitations were still delivered by hand and on horseback, however, due to the unreliability of the nascent postal system. A ‘double envelope’ was used to protect the invitation from damage en route to its recipient. This tradition remains today, despite advances in postal reliability.

=== Modern times ===

The origins of commercially printed &quot;fine wedding stationery&quot; can be traced to just after World War II, when a combination of democracy and rapid industrial growth allowed ordinary people to mimic the lifestyles and materialism of society&#x27;s elite. About that time, prominent society figures, such as Amy Vanderbilt and Emily Post, emerged to advise the ordinary man and woman on appropriate etiquette.

Growth in the use of wedding stationery was also underpinned by the development of thermography. Although it lacks the fineness and distinctiveness of engraving, thermography is a less expensive method of achieving raised type. This technique, often called poor man&#x27;s engraving, produces shiny, raised lettering without impressing the surface of the paper (in the way traditional engraving does). As such, wedding invitations – either printed or engraved – finally became affordable for all.

More recently letterpress printing has become popular for wedding invitations. It has a certain boutique and craft appeal due to the deep impression or bite that can be achieved. It was not the original intent of letterpress to bite into the paper in this way, but rather to kiss it, creating a flat print. The bite or deep impression is a recent aesthetic that adds the sensory experience of touch to letterpress printed wedding invitations. Many letterpress printers that specialize in wedding invitations are small start-ups or artisan printers, rather than large printing companies.

Laser engraving has also been making headway in the wedding invitation market over the last few years. Primarily used for engraving wood veneer invitations, it is also used to engrave acrylic or to mark certain types of metal invitations.

The latest trend in wedding invitations is to order them online. Using the internet has made viewing, organizing and ordering wedding invitations an easy task. There are hundreds of websites that offer wedding invitations and stationery, and being online allows the customer to order from anywhere in the world.

== Text ==
Etiquette regarding the text on a formal wedding invitation varies according to country, culture and language. In Western countries, a formal invitation is typically written in the formal, third-person language, saying that the hosts wish for the recipient to attend the wedding and giving its date, time, and place. In some non-Western countries, such as India, where the concept of wedding invitations was acquired through the British, the language continues to follow Western traditions.

As the bride&#x27;s parents are traditionally the hosts of the wedding, the text commonly begins with the names of the bride&#x27;s parents as they use them in formal social contexts, e.g., &quot;Mr. and Mrs. John A Smith&quot; or &quot;Dr. Mary Jones and Mr. John Smith&quot;. The exact wording varies, but a typical phrasing runs as follows:


Wedding invitations sometimes include the spelling &#x27;honour,&#x27; even in the United States, where the &#x27;u&#x27; is not correct in any other context regardless of formality. This practice derives from a ruling laid down by Emily Post in the 1920s.

In the United Kingdom, the line &quot;request...presence&quot; is used when the ceremony is held in a house of worship; &quot;pleasure of your company&quot; is used when it is held elsewhere.

If the groom&#x27;s parents are also hosts of the wedding, then their names may be added as well. If the parents are not the hosts of the wedding, then the host&#x27;s name is substituted in the first line, or, especially if the bride and groom are themselves the hosts, it may be written in the passive voice: &quot;The honour of your presence is requested at the wedding of...&quot;

Formal announcements, sent after the wedding ceremony, omit the time and sometimes the place, but usually retain the same general form.

Informal invitations, appropriate to less formal weddings, are issued by word of mouth or by hand-written letter. So long as they convey the necessary practical information about the time and place, there is no set form for these invitations.

== Printing and design ==
Commercial wedding invitations are typically printed using one of the following methods: engraving, lithography, thermography, letterpress printing, sometimes blind embossing, compression plate process, or offset printing. More recently, many brides are printing on their home computers using a laser printer or inkjet printer. For the artistically inclined, they can be handmade or written in calligraphy.

Historically, wedding invitations were hand-written unless the length of the guest list made this impractical. When mass-production was necessary, engraving was preferred over the only other widely available then option, which was a relatively poor quality of letterpress printing. Hand-written invitations, in the hosts&#x27; own handwriting, are still considered most correct whenever feasible; these invitations follow the same formal third-person form as printed ones for formal weddings and take the form of a personal letter for less formal weddings.
Tissues are often provided by manufacturers to place over the printed text. Originally, the purpose of the tissue was to reduce smudging or blotting, especially on invitations poorly printed or hastily mailed before the ink was fully dried, but improved printing techniques mean they are now simply decorative. Those who know that their original purpose has been made irrelevant by dramatic improvements in printing technology usually discard them.

Modern invitation design follows fashion trends. Invitations are generally chosen to match the couple&#x27;s personal preferences, the level of formality of the event, and any color scheme or planned theme. For example, a casual beach wedding may have light, fresh colors and beach-related graphics. A formal church wedding may have more scripty typefaces and lots of ornamentation that matches the formal nature of the event. The design of the invitation is becoming less and less traditional and more reflective of the couple&#x27;s personality. Some web-based print-on-demand companies now allow couples to design or customize their own wedding invitations.

More recently in 2019, foil stamping and foil sleeking invitations have come back into trend. Foil sleeking is applied by applying a thick layer of toner to a paper using all four CMYK colours and a fifth white colour, next the card is fed through a foil heat transfer machine where the foil sticks to the toner and design. 

The invitation is typically a note card, folded in half, or perhaps French folded (folded twice, into quarters). Other options include a sheet of paper, a tri-fold, or a trendy pocket-fold design. The appropriate paper density depends on the design but typically ranges from heavy paper to very stiff card stock. There are also acrylic invitations.

== Mailing ==
Traditionally, wedding invitations are mailed in double envelopes. The inner envelope may be lined, is not gummed, and fits into the outer envelope. The outer envelope is gummed for sealing and addressing. More recently, the inner envelope is often left out in the interest of saving money, paper, and postage. In some cases, a pocketfold takes the place of an inner envelope.

In countries that issue them, the envelope may be franked with love stamps. The United States postal service issues a love stamp each year specifically denominated to cover the double weight of the invitation and reply (a rate slightly less than the cost of two regular stamps).

== Response ==
As with any invitation, the sole obligation of the recipient person is to respond, as promptly as reasonably possible, to let the hosts know whether or not he will be able to attend. Receiving a wedding invitation does not obligate the recipient either to attend the wedding or to send a gift.

A proper response is written on the recipient&#x27;s normal stationery, following the form of the invitation. For example, if the invitation uses formal, third-person language, then the recipient replies in formal, third-person language, saying either &quot;Mr. Robert Jones accepts with pleasure the kind invitation to the wedding on the first of November&quot;, or &quot;Ms. Susan Brown regrets that she is unable to attend the wedding on the first of November.&quot;

Pre-printed, pre-addressed, pre-stamped response cards are frequently sent in the hope of encouraging a greater proportion of invited people to respond to the invitation. Some American etiquette experts consider the practice incorrect and ineffective at increasing response rates.

== Other items ==
In addition to the invitation itself, sellers promote a wide range of optional printed materials. These may include an RSVP response card, a separate invitation to a wedding reception, and information such as maps, directions, childcare options, and hotel accommodations.

Wedding invitations should be sent out 6–8 weeks prior to a wedding, with slightly more time being given for out of town or destination weddings. Guests should be asked to reply at least 2 to 3 weeks before the wedding date; although many couples request RSVPs to be returned up to a month prior to the wedding day.

These printers also sell matching pieces intended for the day of the wedding, such as programs, menus, table cards, and place cards, as well as wedding favors and party favors such as napkins, coasters, cocktail stirrers and matchboxes.

== In pop culture ==
In &quot;The Invitations&quot; episode of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, George Costanza&#x27;s fiancée Susan is killed by licking toxic wedding invitations that George picked out because they were inexpensive.

<doc id="1342804" wikidata="Q155000" url="?curid=1342804" title="Bulgarian Communist Party">
<text>The Bulgarian Communist Party (Bulgarian: Българска комунистическа партия (БΚП), Romanised: &quot;Bŭlgarska komunisticheska partiya&quot;; BKP) was the founding and ruling party of the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria from 1946 until 1990, when the country ceased to be a socialist satellite state of the Soviet Union. The party had dominated the Fatherland Front, a coalition that took power in 1944, late in World War II, after it led a coup against Bulgaria&#x27;s tsarist regime in conjunction with the Red Army&#x27;s crossing of the border. It controlled its armed forces, the Bulgarian People&#x27;s Army.

The BCP was organized on the basis of democratic centralism, a principle introduced by the Russian Marxist scholar and leader Vladimir Lenin, which entails democratic and open discussion on policy on the condition of unity in upholding the agreed-upon policies. The highest body of the BCP was the Party Congress, convened every fifth year. When the Party Congress was not in session, the Central Committee was the highest body, but since the body normally met only once a year, most duties and responsibilities were vested in the Politburo and its Standing Committee. The party&#x27;s leader held the offices of General Secretary.

The BCP was committed to Marxism-Leninism, an ideology based on the writings of the German philosopher Karl Marx and of Lenin (from 1922 to 1953 as formulated by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin). In the 1960s, the BCP announced some economic reforms, which allowed the free sale of production that exceeded planned amounts. The BCP gradually developed an openly nationalistic policy against its Muslim and Turkish minorities and went much further in this direction than any other Eastern European communist regime. After Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev took power in 1985, the BCP underwent political and economic liberalization, which promptly liquidated the party and dissolved the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria completely. After the end of the BCP, the party was renamed to the Bulgarian Socialist Party in 1990, although Bulgaria retained its socialist-era constitution until 1991 along with its Warsaw Pact membership until its dissolution that same year.

==History==

=== Origins ===
The party&#x27;s origins lay in the Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party (Narrow Socialists) (&quot;Tesni Sotsialisti&quot;, &quot;Narrow Socialists&quot;), which was founded in 1903 after a split in the 10th Congress of the Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party.

The party&#x27;s founding leader was Dimitar Blagoev, who was the driving force behind the formation of the BSDWP in 1894. It comprised most of the hardline Marxists in the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party. The party opposed World War I and was sympathetic to the October Revolution in Russia. Under Blagoev&#x27;s leadership, the party applied to join the Communist International upon its founding in 1919. Upon joining the Comintern the party was reorganised as the Communist Party of Bulgaria.

Georgi Dimitrov was a member of the party&#x27;s Central Committee from its inception in 1919 until his death in 1949, also serving as Bulgaria&#x27;s leader from 1946. In 1938 the party merged with the Bulgarian Workers&#x27; Party and took the former party&#x27;s name.

=== Ruling party ===

Following Dimitrov&#x27;s sudden death, the party was led by Valko Chervenkov, a Stalinist who oversaw a number of party purges that met with Moscow&#x27;s approval. The party joined the Cominform at its inception in 1948 and conducted purges against suspected Titoists following the expulsion of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia from the alliance. Suspected counter-revolutionaries were imprisoned. In 1948 the Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers Party (Broad Socialists) was forced to merge into the BKP, thus liquidating any left-wing alternative to the communists.

In March 1954, one year after Joseph Stalin&#x27;s death, Chervenkov was deposed.

From 1954 until 1989 the party was led by Todor Zhivkov, who was very supportive of the Soviet Union and remained close to its leadership after Nikita Khrushchev was deposed by Leonid Brezhnev. His rule led to relative political stability and an increase in living standards. The demands for democratic reform which swept Eastern Europe in 1989 led Zhivkov to resign. He was succeeded by a considerably more liberal Communist, Petar Mladenov. On 11 December Mladenov announced the party was giving up its guaranteed right to rule. For all intents and purposes, this was the end of Communist rule in Bulgaria, though it would be another month before the provision in the constitution enshrining the party&#x27;s &quot;leading role&quot; was deleted.

=== Post-1990 ===
The party moved in a more moderate direction, and by the spring of 1990 was no longer a Marxist-Leninist party. That April, the party changed its name to the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP). A number of hardline Communists established several splinter parties with a small number of members. One of these parties, named Communist Party of Bulgaria (&quot;Komunisticeska Partija na Balgarija&quot;), is led by Aleksandar Paunov.

== Headquarters ==
The Party House (Партийния дом, &quot;Partiyniya dom&quot;) served as the headquarters of the Bulgarian Communist Party, located at the Largo. The Party House building was designed by a team under architect Petso Zlatev and was completed in 1955.

==Leaders==

=== Chairman of the Communist Party of Bulgaria ===
===General Secretaries of the Bulgarian Communist Party (1948–1990)===
===Chairmen of the Bulgarian Communist Party (1990)===
== Organizational structure ==
=== Party congresses ===
Congresses and national conferences adopt the program and statutes of the party, approve the accounts of the past periods, develop directives and decisions for further activity. They elect the central governing bodies of the party.

=== Central Committee ===
The Central Committee of the BKP is the highest governing body that operates between congresses.

<doc id="1342808" wikidata="Q720443" url="?curid=1342808" title="Carroll Quigley">
<text>Carroll Quigley (; November 9, 1910 – January 3, 1977) was an American historian and theorist of the evolution of civilizations. He is remembered for his teaching work as a professor at Georgetown University, and his seminal works, &quot;The Evolution of Civilizations: An Introduction to Historical Analysis,&quot; and &quot;Tragedy And Hope; A History Of The World In Our Time,&quot; in which he states that an Anglo-American banking elite have worked together for centuries to spread certain values globally.

== Life and career ==
Born in Boston, Quigley attended Harvard University, where he studied history and earned B.A, M.A., and Ph.D. degrees. He taught at Princeton University, and then at Harvard, and then from 1941 to 1976 at the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University.

From 1941 until 1972, he taught a two-semester course at Georgetown on the development of civilizations. According to his obituary in &quot;The Washington Star&quot;, many alumni of Georgetown&#x27;s School of Foreign Service asserted that this was &quot;the most influential course in their undergraduate careers&quot;.

In addition to his academic work, Quigley served as a consultant to the U.S. Department of Defense, the United States Navy, the Smithsonian Institution, and the House Select Committee on Astronautics and Space Exploration in the 1950s. He was also a book reviewer for &quot;The Washington Star&quot;, and a contributor and editorial board member of &quot;Current History&quot;.

Quigley retired from Georgetown in June 1976 after being honored by the student body with its Faculty Award for the fourth consecutive year. He died the following year at Georgetown University Hospital following a heart attack.

===Major conclusions===
====Inclusive diversity====
Quigley&#x27;s work emphasized &quot;inclusive diversity&quot; as a core value of Western civilization,&lt;ref name=&quot;Quigley1966-1227/34&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; contrasting it with the dualism of Plato. He concluded the book &quot;Tragedy and Hope&quot; with the hope that the West could &quot;resume its development along its old patterns of Inclusive Diversity&quot;. From his study of history, &quot;it is clear that the West believes in diversity rather than in uniformity, in pluralism rather than in monism or dualism, in inclusion rather than exclusion, in liberty rather than in authority, in truth rather than in power, in conversion rather than in annihilation, in the individual rather than in the organization, in reconciliation rather than in triumph, in heterogeneity rather than in homogeneity, in relativisms rather than in absolutes, and in approximations rather than in final answers.&quot;

Quigley asserts that any intolerance or rigidity in the religious practices of the West are aberrations from its nature of inclusivity and diversity. Quigley points to the tolerance and flexibility in Aquinas&#x27;s belief that theological truth is revealed over time through dialogue within the Christian community, which allows the community to adapt to a changing world.

====Institutionalization and the fall of civilizations====
Having studied the rise and fall of civilizations, &quot;Quigley found the explanation of disintegration in the gradual transformation of social &#x27;instruments&#x27; into &#x27;institutions,&#x27; that is, transformation of social arrangements functioning to meet real social needs into social institutions serving their own purposes regardless of real social needs&quot;.

====Weapons and democracy====
From a historical study of weapons and political dynamics, Quigley concludes that the characteristics of weapons are the main predictor of democracy. Democracy tends to emerge only when the best weapons available are easy for individuals to buy and use. This explains why democracy occurs so rarely in human history.

In the 1800s (peaking in the 1880s), guns were the best weapon available. In America, almost everyone could afford to buy a gun, and could learn how to use it fairly easily. Governments couldn&#x27;t do any better: it became the age of mass armies of citizen soldiers with guns. (Similarly, Periclean Greece was an age of the citizen soldier and of democracy).

In the 1900s, expensive, specialist weapons (such as tanks and bombers) became available, and citizen soldiers became dominated by specialist soldiers. Quigley notes that the slaughter of World War I (1914-1918) was due to the mismatch between the traditional armies (citizen soldiers) and the available weapons (machine guns used defensively).

===Style===
Quigley&#x27;s writing style is dense, influenced by a former history professor of his:
&quot;As we raced along, Goethe was covered in fifteen minutes, Schiller in ten, Fichte in five...he covered any topic simply by slicing it up into a small number of parts and giving a name to each part. The complex character and achievement of Goethe, for example, were divided into six portions, each was given a title, and, ever after, the whole of Goethe could be evoked merely by reciting six words...I should like to outdare even my former professor by dividing this greater complexity [Classical culture] into only five parts.&quot;
Quigley&#x27;s analytical style is scientific, stemming from his earlier training in physics.
In this book we are concerned with the social sciences...and particularly with the effort to apply a scientific method of observation, formulation of hypotheses, and testing to such phenomena. The enormous size of this field has made it advisable to curtail our attention to the process of social change, especially in civilizations.
==Influence on Bill Clinton==
In his first year (1965) in the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown, Bill Clinton took Quigley&#x27;s course, receiving a &#x27;B&#x27; as his final grade in both semesters (an excellent grade in a course where nearly half the students received D or lower). In 1991, Clinton named Quigley as an important influence on his aspirations and political philosophy, when Clinton launched his presidential campaign in a speech at Georgetown. He said he learned from Quigley that “The future can be better than the past, and that each of us has a personal, moral responsibility to make it so.” Bill Clinton told his audiences, “that is what the new choice is all about...We are not here to save the Democratic party. We are here to save the United States of America.” It was Clinton&#x27;s most effective speech, and he repeated variations time and time again as the blueprint for his campaign message in winning the Democratic nomination and the general election for President of the United States in 1992.

The same remark on American greatness was recalled by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who met her husband in Quigley&#x27;s class on African history.

== Quigley and the Round Table group ==
One distinctive feature of Quigley&#x27;s historical writings is his assertion that the Round Table movement played a significant role in recent world history. His writing on this topic has made Quigley famous among many who investigate &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;.

=== Quigley and the Milner Group ===

In the &quot;Anglo American Establishment he focuses on the Round Table group founded in 1891 by Cecil Rhodes and Alfred Milner. Quigley argues that &quot;The organization was so modified and so expanded by Milner after the eclipse of Stead in 1899, and especially after the death of Rhodes in 1902, that it took on quite a different organization and character, although it continued to pursue the same goals.&quot; Quigley greatly admired the British Empire and lamented that the secret society was not very successful. Historian Robert Rotberg states:
:&quot;But Quigley was not opposed to what Rhodes and Milner had purportedly tried to accomplish. Indeed, Quigley wrote more in remorse at what had failed than in antagonism to what he believed were their mutual efforts at extending the British Empire,&quot;

The society consisted of an inner circle (&quot;The Society of the Elect&quot;) and an outer circle (&quot;The Association of Helpers&quot;, also known as The Milner Kindergarten and the Round Table Group). The society as a whole does not have a fixed name:

 This society has been known at various times as Milner&#x27;s Kindergarten, as the Round Table Group, as the Rhodes crowd, as &quot;The Times&quot; crowd, as the All Souls group, and as the Cliveden set. ... I have chosen to call it the Milner group. Those persons who have used the other terms, or heard them used, have not generally been aware that all these various terms referred to the same Group...this Group is, as I shall show, one of the most important historical facts of the twentieth century.

Quigley assigns this group primary or exclusive credit for several historical events: the Jameson Raid, the Second Boer War, the founding of the Union of South Africa, the replacement of the British Empire with the Commonwealth of Nations, and a number of Britain&#x27;s foreign policy decisions in the twentieth century.

In 1966, Quigley published a one-volume history of the twentieth century, titled &quot;Tragedy and Hope&quot;. At several points in this book, the history of the Milner group is discussed. Moreover, Quigley states that he has recently been in direct contact with this organization, whose nature he contrasts to right-wing claims of a communist conspiracy:

This radical Right fairy tale, which is now an accepted folk myth in many groups in America, pictured the recent history of the United States, in regard to domestic reform and in foreign affairs, as a well-organized plot by extreme Left-wing elements ... This myth, like all fables, does in fact have a modicum of truth. There does exist, and has existed for a generation, an international Anglophile network which operates, to some extent, in the way the Radical right believes the Communists act. In fact, this network, which we may identify as the Round Table Groups, has no aversion to cooperating with the Communists, or any other group, and frequently does so. I know of the operation of this network because I have studied it for twenty years and was permitted for two years, in the early 1960s, to examine its papers and secret records. I have no aversion to it or to most of its aims and have, for much of my life, been close to it and to many of its instruments. I have objected, both in the past and recently, to a few of its policies... but in general my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown, and I believe its role in history is significant enough to be known.

According to Quigley, the leaders of this group were Cecil Rhodes and Alfred Milner from 1891 until Rhodes&#x27; death in 1902, Milner alone until his own death in 1925, Lionel Curtis from 1925 to 1955, Robert H. (Baron) Brand from 1955 to 1963, and Adam D. Marris from 1963 until the time Quigley wrote his book. This organization also functioned through certain loosely affiliated &quot;front groups&quot;, including the Royal Institute of International Affairs, the Institute of Pacific Relations, and the Council on Foreign Relations.

In addition, other secret societies are briefly discussed in &quot;Tragedy and Hope&quot;, including a consortium of the leaders of the central banks of several countries, who formed the Bank for International Settlements. Historian Robert Rotberg reports that, &quot;Unfortunately, &quot;Tragedy and Hope&quot; lacks the usual scholarly apparatus. It cites nothing.&quot;

=== Citations of Quigley in exposés of purported conspiracies ===
Soon after its publication, &quot;Tragedy and Hope&quot; caught the attention of authors interested in conspiracies. They proceeded to publicize Quigley&#x27;s claims, disseminating them to a much larger audience than his original readership.

This began in 1970, when W. Cleon Skousen published &quot;The Naked Capitalist: A Review and Commentary on Dr. Carroll Quigley&#x27;s Book &quot;Tragedy and Hope&quot;&quot;. The first third of this book consists of extensive excerpts from &quot;Tragedy and Hope&quot;, interspersed with commentary by Skousen. Skousen quotes Quigley&#x27;s description of the activities of several groups — the Milner Group, a cartel of international bankers, the Communist Party, the Institute of Pacific Relations, and the Council on Foreign Relations. According to Skousen&#x27;s interpretation of Quigley&#x27;s book, each of these is a facet of one large conspiracy. The following year, G. Edward Griffin released the documentary &quot;The Capitalist Conspiracy: An Inside View of International Banking&quot;, crediting the Skousen book: &quot;We wish to acknowledge that this film was inspired by Cleon Skousen&#x27;s book, &quot;The Naked Capitalist&quot;, which we believe is one of the most important documents of the decade.&quot; Quigley responded directly to Skousen in a review stating that Skousen &quot;has echoes of the original Nazi 25 point program.&quot;

In 1971, Gary Allen, a spokesman for the John Birch Society, published &quot;None Dare Call It Conspiracy&quot;, which became a bestseller. Allen cited Quigley&#x27;s &quot;Tragedy and Hope&quot; as an authoritative source on conspiracies throughout his book. Like Skousen, Allen understood the various conspiracies in Quigley&#x27;s book to be branches of one large conspiracy, and also connected them to the Bilderbergers and to Richard Nixon. The John Birch Society continues to cite Quigley as a primary source for their view of history.

Quigley is also cited by several other authors who assert the existence of powerful conspiracies. Jim Marrs, whose work was used as a source by Oliver Stone in his film &quot;JFK&quot;, cites Quigley in his book &quot;Rule By Secrecy&quot;, which describes a conspiracy linking the Milner Group, Skull and Bones, the Trilateral Commission, the Bavarian Illuminati, the Knights Templar, and aliens who posed as the Sumerian gods thousands of years ago. Pat Robertson&#x27;s book &quot;The New World Order&quot; cites Quigley as an authority on a powerful conspiracy. Conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly has asserted that Bill Clinton&#x27;s political success was due to his pursuit of the &quot;world government&quot; agenda he learned from Quigley.
G. Edward Griffin relies heavily on Quigley for information about the role Milner&#x27;s secret society plays in the Federal Reserve in his book &quot;The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve&quot;.

Quigley was dismissive of the authors who used his writings to support theories of a world domination conspiracy. Of W. Cleon Skousen&#x27;s &quot;The Naked Capitalist&quot; he stated:

Skousen&#x27;s book is full of misrepresentations and factual errors. He claims that I have written of a conspiracy of the super-rich who are pro-Communist and wish to take over the world and that I&#x27;m a member of this group. But I never called it a conspiracy and don&#x27;t regard it as such. I&#x27;m not an &quot;insider&quot; of these rich persons, although Skousen thinks so. I happen to know some of them and liked them, although I disagreed with some of the things they did before 1940.

On Gary Allen&#x27;s &quot;None Dare Call It Conspiracy&quot; he said:

They thought Dr. Carroll Quigley proved everything. For example, they constantly misquote me to this effect: that Lord Milner (the dominant trustee of the Cecil Rhodes Trust and a heavy in the Round Table Group) helped finance the Bolsheviks. I have been through the greater part of Milner&#x27;s private papers and have found no evidence to support that.

Further, &quot;None Dare Call It Conspiracy&quot; insists that international bankers were a single bloc, were all powerful and remain so today. I, on the contrary, stated in my book that they were much divided, often fought among themselves, had great influence but not control of political life and were sharply reduced in power about 1931-1940, when they became less influential than monopolized industry.

=== Criticism ===
F. William Engdahl, in an overview of financial imperialism entitled &quot;The Gods of Money&quot;, criticized Quigley for stating that the power of international bankers declined in the 1930s, and insofar as the influence of international bankers in America was concerned, suggested that Quigley was confusing &quot;international finance&quot; with Morgan interests. He suggested, like Sutton, that Quigley&#x27;s papers had been vetted. Engdahl argued that it was not the case that the power of &quot;international finance&quot; declined, but rather, Morgan interests fell and were replaced by Rockefeller interests.

Quigley stated that the intentions and objectives of the group he profiled, associated with Wall Street and the City of London and Cecil Rhodes&#x27; super-imperialism, were &quot;largely commendable&quot;. Members of the group, in statements recorded by the &quot;New York Times&quot; in 1902, proclaimed that they formed their society for the purpose of &quot;gradually absorbing the wealth of the world&quot;.

Quigley argued that the Round Table groups were not World Government advocates but super-imperialists. He stated that they emphatically did not want the League of Nations to become a World Government. Yet Lionel Curtis, who, according to Quigley, was one of the leaders of the Round Table movement, wished for it to be a World government with teeth, writing articles with H. G. Wells urging this.

<text>A benign tumor is a mass of cells (tumor) that does not invade neighboring tissue or metastasize (spread throughout the body). Compared to malignant (cancerous) tumors, benign tumors generally have a slower growth rate. Benign tumors have relatively well differentiated cells. They are often surrounded by an outer surface (fibrous sheath of connective tissue) or stay contained within the epithelium. Common examples of benign tumors include moles and uterine fibroids.

Some forms of benign tumors may be harmful to health. Benign tumor growth causes a mass effect that can compress neighboring tissues. This can lead to nerve damage, blood flow reduction (ischemia), tissue death (necrosis), or organ damage. The health effects of benign tumor growth may be more prominent if the tumor is contained within an enclosed space such as the cranium, respiratory tract, sinus, or bones. For example, unlike most benign tumors elsewhere in the body, benign brain tumors can be life-threatening. Tumors may exhibit behaviors characteristic of their cell type of origin; as an example, endocrine tumors such as thyroid adenomas and adrenocortical adenomas may overproduce certain hormones.

The word &quot;benign&quot; means . However, a benign tumor is not &quot;benign&quot; in the usual sense; the name merely specifies that it is not &quot;malignant&quot;, i.e. cancerous. While benign tumors usually do not pose a serious health risk, they can be harmful or fatal. Many types of benign tumors have the potential to become cancerous (malignant) through a process known as tumor progression. For this reason and other possible harms, some benign tumors are removed by surgery. When removed, benign tumors usually do not return. Exceptions to this rule may indicate malignant transformation.

==Signs and symptoms==
Benign tumors are very diverse; they may be asymptomatic or may cause specific symptoms, depending on their anatomic location and tissue type. They grow outward, producing large, rounded masses which can cause what is known as a &quot;mass effect&quot;. This growth can cause compression of local tissues or organs, leading to many effects, such as blockage of ducts, reduced blood flow (ischaemia), tissue death (necrosis) and nerve pain or damage. Some tumors also produce hormones that can lead to life-threatening situations. Insulinomas can produce large amounts of insulin, causing hypoglycemia. Pituitary adenomas can cause elevated levels of hormones such as growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1, which cause acromegaly; prolactin; ACTH and cortisol, which cause Cushing&#x27;s disease; TSH, which causes hyperthyroidism; and FSH and LH. Bowel intussusception can occur with various benign colonic tumors. Cosmetic effects can be caused by tumors, especially those of the skin, possibly causing psychological or social discomfort for the person with the tumor. Vascular tissue tumors can bleed, in some cases leading to anemia.

==Causes==

=== PTEN hamartoma syndrome ===
PTEN hamartoma syndrome encompasses hamartomatous disorders characterized by genetic mutations in the PTEN tumor suppressor gene, including Cowden syndrome, Bannayan–Riley–Ruvalcaba syndrome, Proteus syndrome and Proteus-like syndrome. Absent or dysfunctional PTEN protein allows cells to over-proliferate, causing hamartomas. Cowden syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by multiple benign hamartomas (trichilemmomas and mucocutaneous papillomatous papules) as well as a predisposition for cancers of multiple organs including the breast and thyroid. Bannayan–Riley–Ruvalcaba syndrome is a congenital disorder characterized by hamartomatous intestinal polyposis, macrocephaly, lipomatosis, hemangiomatosis and glans penis macules. Proteus syndrome is characterized by nevi, asymmetric overgrowth of various body parts, adipose tissue dysregulation, cystadenomas, adenomas, vascular malformation.

===Familial adenomatous polyposis===

Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a familial cancer syndrome caused by mutations in the APC gene. In FAP, adenomatous polyps are present in the colon. The polyps progress into colon cancer unless removed. The APC gene is a tumor suppressor. Its protein product is involved in many cellular processes. Inactivation of the APC gene leads to the buildup of a protein called β-catenin. This protein activates two transcription factors: T-cell factor (TCF) and lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF). These factors cause the upregulation of many genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis (programmed cell death), causing the growth of benign tumors.

===Tuberous sclerosis complex===
Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by mutations in the genes TSC1 and TSC2. TSC1 produces the protein hamartin. TSC2 produces the protein tuberin. This disorder presents with many benign hamartomatous tumors including angiofibromas, renal angiomyolipomas, and pulmonary lymphangiomyomatosis. Tuberin and hamartin inhibit the mTOR protein in normal cellular physiology. Inactivation of the TSC tumor suppressors causes an increase in mTOR activity. This leads to the activation of genes and the production of proteins that increase cell growth.

===Von Hippel–Lindau disease===
Von Hippel–Lindau disease is a dominantly inherited cancer syndrome that significantly increases the risk of various tumors. This includes benign hemangioblastomas and malignant pheochromocytomas, renal cell carcinomas, pancreatic endocrine tumors, and endolymphatic sac tumors. It is caused by genetic mutations in the Von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor gene. The VHL protein (pVHL) is involved in cellular signaling in oxygen starved (hypoxic) cells. One role of pVHL is to cause the cellular degradation of another protein, HIF1α. Dysfunctional pVHL leads to accumulation of HIF1α. This activates several genes responsible for the production of substances involved in cell growth and blood vessel production: VEGF, PDGFβ, TGFα and erythropoietin.

=== Bone tumors ===
Benign tumors of bone can be similar macroscopically and require a combination of a clinical history with cytogenetic, molecular, and radiologic tests for diagnosis. Three common forms of benign bone tumors with are giant cell tumor of bone, osteochondroma, and enchondroma; other forms of benign bone tumors exist but may be less prevalent.

==== Giant cell tumors ====
Giant cell tumors of bone frequently occur in long bone epiphyses of the appendicular skeleton or the sacrum of the axial skeleton. Local growth can cause destruction of neighboring cortical bone and soft tissue, leading to pain and limiting range of motion. The characteristic radiologic finding of giant cell tumors of bone is a lytic lesion that does not have marginal sclerosis of bone. On histology, giant cells of fused osteoclasts are seen as a response to neoplastic mononucleated cells. Notably, giant cells are not unique among benign bone tumors to giant cell tumors of bone. Molecular characteristics of the neoplastic cells causing giant cell tumors of bone indicate an origin of pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells that adopt preosteoblastic markers. Cytogenetic causes of giant cell tumors of bone involve telomeres. Treatment involves surgical curettage with adjuvant bisphosphonates.

==== Osteochondroma ====
Osteochondromas form cartilage-capped projections of bone. Structures such as the marrow cavity and cortical bone of the osteochondroma are contiguous to those of the originating bone. Sites of origin often involve metaphyses of long bones. While many osteochondromas occur spontaneously, there are cases in which several osteochondromas can occur in the same individual; these may be linked to a genetic condition known as hereditary multiple osteochondromas. Osteochondroma appears on X-ray as a projecting mass that often points away from joints. These tumors stop growing with the closure of the parental bone&#x27;s growth plates. Failure to stop growth can be indicative of transformation to malignant chondrosarcoma. Treatment is not indicated unless symptomatic. In that case, surgical excision is often curative.

==== Enchondroma ====
Enchondromas are benign tumors of hyaline cartilage. Within a bone, enchondromas are often found in metaphyses. They can be found in many types of bone, including small bones, long bones, and the axial skeleton. X-ray of enchondromas shows well-defined borders and a stippled appearance. Presentation of multiple enchondromas is consistent with multiple enchondromatosis (Ollier Disease). Treatment of enchondromas involves surgical curettage and grafting.

=== Benign soft tissue tumors ===

==== Lipomas ====
Lipomas are benign, subcutaneous tumors of fat cells (adipocytes). They are usually painless, slow-growing, and mobile masses that can occur anywhere in the body where there are fat cells, but are typically found on the trunk and upper extremities.

 Although lipomas can develop at any age, they more commonly appear between the ages of 40 and 60. Lipomas affect about 1% of the population, with no documented sex bias, and about 1 in every 1000 people will have a lipoma within their lifetime. The cause of lipomas is not well defined. Genetic or inherited causes of lipomas play a role in around 2-3% of patients. In individuals with inherited familial syndromes such as Proteus syndrome or Familial multiple lipomatosis, it is common to see multiple lipomas across the body. These syndromes are also associated with specific symptoms and sub-populations. Mutations in chromosome 12 have been identified in around 65% of lipoma cases. Lipomas have also been shown to be increased in those with obesity, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus.

Lipomas are usually diagnosed clinically, although imaging (ultrasound, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging) may be utilized to assist with the diagnosis of lipomas in atypical locations. The main treatment for lipomas is surgical excision, after which the tumor is examined with histopathology to confirm the diagnosis. The prognosis for benign lipomas is excellent and recurrence after excision is rare, but may occur if the removal was incomplete.

==Mechanism==
===Benign vs malignant===

One of the most important factors in classifying a tumor as benign or malignant is its invasive potential. If a tumor lacks the ability to invade adjacent tissues or spread to distant sites by metastasizing then it is benign, whereas invasive or metastatic tumors are malignant. For this reason, benign tumors are not classed as cancer. Benign tumors will grow in a contained area usually encapsulated in a fibrous connective tissue capsule. The growth rates of benign and malignant tumors also differ; benign tumors generally grow more slowly than malignant tumors. Although benign tumors pose a lower health risk than malignant tumors, they both can be life-threatening in certain situations. There are many general characteristics which apply to either benign or malignant tumors, but sometimes one type may show characteristics of the other. For example, benign tumors are mostly well differentiated and malignant tumors are often undifferentiated. However, undifferentiated benign tumors and differentiated malignant tumors can occur. Although benign tumors generally grow slowly, cases of fast-growing benign tumors have also been documented. Some malignant tumors are mostly non-metastatic such as in the case of basal-cell carcinoma. CT and chest radiography can be a useful diagnostic exam in visualizing a benign tumor and differentiating it from a malignant tumor. The smaller the tumor on a radiograph, the more likely it is to be benign as 80% of lung nodules less than 2 cm in diameter are benign. Most benign nodules are smoothed radiopaque densities with clear margins but these are not exclusive signs of benign tumors.

===Multistage carcinogenesis===
Tumors are formed by carcinogenesis, a process in which cellular alterations lead to the formation of cancer. Multistage carcinogenesis involves the sequential genetic or epigenetic changes to a cell&#x27;s DNA, where each step produces a more advanced tumor. It is often broken down into three stages; initiation, promotion and progression, and several mutations may occur at each stage. Initiation is where the first genetic mutation occurs in a cell. Promotion is the clonal expansion (repeated division) of this transformed cell into a visible tumor that is usually benign. Following promotion, progression may take place where more genetic mutations are acquired in a sub-population of tumor cells. Progression changes the benign tumor into a malignant tumor. A prominent and well studied example of this phenomenon is the tubular adenoma, a common type of colon polyp which is an important precursor to colon cancer. The cells in tubular adenomas, like most tumors that frequently progress to cancer, show certain abnormalities of cell maturation and appearance collectively known as dysplasia. These cellular abnormalities are not seen in benign tumors that rarely or never turn cancerous, but are seen in other pre-cancerous tissue abnormalities which do not form discrete masses, such as pre-cancerous lesions of the uterine cervix.

==Diagnosis==
===Classification===
Benign neoplasms are typically, but not always, composed of cells which bear a strong resemblance to a normal cell type in their organ of origin. These tumors are named for the cell or tissue type from which they originate. The suffix &quot;-oma&quot; (but not -carcinoma, -sarcoma, or -blastoma, which are generally cancers) is applied to indicate a benign tumor. For example, a lipoma is a common benign tumor of fat cells (lipocytes), and a chondroma is a benign tumor of cartilage-forming cells (chondrocytes). Adenomas are benign tumors of gland-forming cells, and are usually specified further by their cell or organ of origin, as in hepatic adenoma (a benign tumor of hepatocytes, or liver cells). Teratomas contain many cell types such as skin, nerve, brain and thyroid, among others, because they are derived from germ cells. Hamartomas are a group of benign tumors that have relatively normal cellular differentiation but exhibit disorganized tissue organization.

Exceptions to the nomenclature rules exist for historical reasons; malignant examples include melanoma (a cancer of pigmented skin cells, or melanocytes) and seminoma (a cancer of male reproductive cells).

Benign tumors do not encompass all benign growths. Skin tags, vocal chord polyps, and hyperplastic polyps of the colon are often referred to as benign, but they are overgrowths of normal tissue rather than neoplasms.

==Treatment==
Benign tumors typically need no treatment unless if they cause problems such as seizures, discomfort or cosmetic concerns. Surgery is usually the most effective approach and is used to treat most benign tumors. In some cases, other treatments may be used. Adenomas of the rectum may be treated with sclerotherapy, in which chemicals are used to shrink blood vessels in order to cut off the blood supply. Most benign tumors do not respond to chemotherapy or radiation therapy, although there are exceptions; benign intercranial tumors are sometimes treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy under certain circumstances. Radiation can also be used to treat hemangiomas in the rectum. Benign skin tumors are usually surgically resected but other treatments such as cryotherapy, curettage, electrodesiccation, laser therapy, dermabrasion, chemical peels and topical medication are used.

<doc id="1342814" wikidata="Q1969916" url="?curid=1342814" title="Vergilius Romanus">
<text>The Vergilius Romanus (Vatican City, Biblioteca Apostolica, Cod. Vat. lat. 3867), also known as the Roman Vergil, is a 5th-century illustrated manuscript of the works of Virgil. It contains the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, the &quot;Georgics&quot;, and some of the &quot;Eclogues&quot;. It is one of the oldest and most important Vergilian manuscripts. It is 332 by 323 mm with 309 vellum folios. It was written in rustic capitals with 18 lines per page.

== Decoration ==

The Vergilius Romanus is one of the few surviving illustrated classical manuscripts. As such, its importance to art history is hard to overstate. The manuscript has 19 surviving illustrations, painted by at least two artists, both of whom are anonymous. The style of both artists represents the beginning of a break with classical style. The human form becomes abstracted and flattened and the naturalistic depiction of space is abandoned.

The first artist painted a single miniature on folio 1 recto, an illustration for the First Eclogue. In it a cowherd, Tityrus, plays a flute while sitting under a tree. The heads of three cows look out from behind the tree. Meanwhile a standing goatherd, Meliboeus, leads a goat by its horns under a tree. More goats look out from behind that tree. This miniature shows some remnants of classical style. The cows and goats looking out from behind the trees are an attempt, albeit an unsuccessful one, at creating the appearance of space. The garments of the two men are draped naturally and the heads are shown in three quarter view. The miniature, unlike any miniature in this manuscript, is unframed which shows a connection to the tradition of papyrus roll illustration.

The second artist demonstrates a more radical break from the classical tradition in the remaining miniatures. All of these miniatures are framed in red and gold. The artist seems to have no real understanding of the portrayal of the human body, and is incapable of handling a contorted pose, such as is seen on folio 100 verso, where a reclining figure is portrayed in an utterly unconvincing manner. Faces are no longer portrayed in three quarter position but are either frontal or full profile. The clothing no longer drapes naturally but is instead reduced to rhythmic curving lines. The page is often divided into separate compartments (See, for example, Folio 108r). When a landscape is depicted there is no attempt to depict a three-dimensional space. There is no ground line and items are spread evenly over the field. Care is taken so that items do not overlap each other. The effect is remarkably similar to some Roman floor mosaics, which may have served as inspiration (see folios 44 verso and 45 recto. 

The manuscript contains three author portraits (Folios 3v, 9r, and 14 r). These portraits show a reliance on the early papyrus scroll tradition of manuscript portraits. They are inserted into the text column within a frame. The portraits show Vergil sitting on a chair between a lectern and a locked chest. The portrait on folio 3v has the lectern on Vergil&#x27;s right on the chest on his left, which is reversed in the other two portraits.

== Provenance ==

The Vergilius Romanus was produced in an undetermined province. Based on the style of some aspects of the illumination Martin Henig has suggested that it was produced in Britain. If this is true it would make it the oldest surviving British codex. It was at the Abbey of St Denis until the 15th century but it is not known how it came to be at St Denis or in the Vatican.

The Vergilius Romanus is not to be confused with the Vergilius Vaticanus (Vatican City, Biblioteca Apostolica, Cod. Vat. lat. 3225) or the Vergilius Augusteus, other ancient Vergilian manuscripts in the Biblioteca Apostolica.

<text>The Communist Party of Bulgaria (CPB) is a communist party in Bulgaria, currently led by Aleksandar Paunov.

The party was founded in 1996 as the Communist Party. 

Since 2001, it is part of the Coalition for Bulgaria, an alliance led by the Bulgarian Socialist Party. The party publishes the newspaper &quot;Rabotnicheski Vestnik&quot;. In the 2014 parliamentary election, the Coalition for Bulgaria received 15.4% of the popular vote and 39 out of 240 seats. The party remains represented in Parliament within the coalition after the 2017 election.

The party came under fire during the 2020 protests, when it was alleged that first secretary, Aleksandar Paunov, had had a phone call with convicted businessman Vasil Bozhkov. Alexander Paunov went on to admit that the conversation took place, however denied any wrongdoing. This led to Alexander Paunov being asked to leave the BSP for Bulgaria parliamentary group, of which he was a part, becoming an independent MP.

<text>Bunker Hill is a neighborhood in Los Angeles, California. It is part of Downtown Los Angeles.

Historically, Bunker Hill was a large hill that separated the Victorian-era Downtown from the western end of the city. The hill was tunneled through at Second Street in 1924, and at Third and Fourth Streets. In the late 20th century, the hill was lowered in elevation, and the entire area was redeveloped to supplant old frame and concrete buildings with modern high-rises and other structures for residences, commerce, entertainment, and education.

==History==
===Early development===

In 1867, two wealthy developers, Prudent Beaudry, a French-Canadian immigrant, and Stephen Mott purchased a majority of the hill&#x27;s land. Beaudry&#x27;s land purchase ranged from present-day Hill Street to Olive Street and 4th Street and 2nd Street. Mott&#x27;s land purchase ranged between 4th Street to Temple and Figueroa and Grand. Because of the hill&#x27;s excellent views of the Los Angeles Basin and the Los Angeles River, he knew that it would make for an opulent subdivision. Beaudry employed surveyor George Hansen to help divide up the land into 80 plots to sell to individual buyers.

Beaudry started to build his house on the top of the hill, a modest two-story structure. He needed the infrastructure set up to reach the top of the hill, such as the water pipes. He asked the Los Angeles Water Company to help build the water pipe up the hill. Due to the nature of the hill and their initial concerns about the plan they denied his plea. As result, he built his own pipes and also formed the Canal and Reservoir Company Several new streets were created, one of which—Bunker Hill Avenue, named in commemoration of the Battle of Bunker Hill—eventually gave its name to the new neighborhood.

Beaudry developed the peak of Bunker Hill with lavish two-story Victorian houses that became famous as homes for the upper-class residents of Los Angeles. The dominant architecture of the community of the houses of Bunker Hill was Queen Anne and Eastlake style. The geography of the Hill allowed these residents to escape the hustle and bustle of the city as it slowly grew around at the flatland at the bottom of the hill. Some notable residents during these times are: 
*Prudent Beaudry – 13th Mayor of Los Angeles, developer of Bunker Hill
*L. J. Rose: Arrived from Iowa, due to the death of his son to serious bronchial trouble during a harsh winter. Wine maker and entrepreneur
*Dr. Edmund Hildreth: Retired Clergyman from Chicago
*D. F. Donigan: Self-made man. Owned his own contracting business, which later was the contractor for the construction of the first railroad which led from Los Angeles to Pasadena. He became an indispensable adviser to Beaudry when it came to beginning the development of Bunker Hill in its early stages. 
*Lewis L. Bradbury, Sr. and his wife – Made their fortune from silver mines in Mexico. Original owner of the Bradbury Building in Downtown LA.
*Judge Robert M. Widney – Founder of University of Southern California. Helped create the first transportation for the residents up the Hill, a horse-drawn carriage.

After the introduction of the horse carriage to the Bunker Hill neighborhood, the iconic Angel&#x27;s Flight was proposed. Angel&#x27;s Flight, now dubbed &quot;The World&#x27;s Shortest Railway&quot;, took residents homeward from the bottom of the 33% grade and down again. Colonel J. W. Eddy petitioned the Los Angeles City Council to establish an electric cable railway, which was approved ten days later signed by the mayor, Meredith P. Snyder. The first railways which was established and operational was on Third Street, from Hill Street to Olive Street.

==== &quot;Blighted Community&quot; ====
Initially a residential suburb, Bunker Hill retained its exclusive character through the end of World War I. Around the 1920s and the 1930s, with the advent of the Pacific Electric Railway and the construction of the freeway, and the increased urban growth fed by an extensive streetcar system, its wealthy residents began leaving for enclaves such as Beverly Hills and Pasadena. Bunker Hill&#x27;s houses were increasingly subdivided to accommodate renters. Bunker Hill was at this time &quot;Los Angeles&#x27;s most crowded and urban neighborhood&quot;. By World War II, the Pasadena Freeway, built to bring shoppers downtown, was taking more residents out. Additional postwar freeway construction left downtown comparatively empty of both people and services. The once-grand Victorian mansions of Bunker Hill became the home of impoverished pensioners. Over time, these tenements became more prominent, and apartment buildings started being built alongside these houses. As more and more people crowded into these cheap housing units, the population of the hill increased 19%, most of whom were low income.

===Bunker Hill Redevelopment Project===
In 1955, Los Angeles city planners decided that Bunker Hill required a massive slum clearance project. There were a couple of major political events which led to the &quot;removal of the blight&quot; and redevelopment of Bunker Hill. The California Community Redevelopment Law of 1945, the Federal Housing Act of 1946 and 1949, the creation of the Community Redevelopment Agency in 1948, and also the Bunker Hill Urban Renewal Project in 1959.

The California Community Redevelopment law of 1945 allowed counties and cities to create and implement these agencies to help deal with the redevelopment of local cities. Until 2011, these Agencies held much power and were still around, until Governor Jerry Brown signed into law two bills to dissolve them.

Along with those political factors, other things which led to the conclusion of the blighted neighborhood came from some of the government offices. The Los Angeles Police Department called the area a &quot;high frequency crime area&quot;, due to the fact that the area&#x27;s apartments catered to known offenders. The health department of Los Angeles also called the area a health hazard for its city. It wasn&#x27;t until the CRA had won an ongoing court case against the residents of Bunker Hill. This loss for the residents of Bunker Hill led to the displacement of many families and removal of many of the low income residents of the area. This victory for the CRA led to them being able to buy land to redevelop as they saw fit. Within the plans for the redevelopment, there was a section for the rehabilitation of the buildings of Bunker Hill. The section was slated to preserve the historical buildings of Bunker Hill, but instead were demolished since there was no actual rehabilitation planned.

The development of Bunker Hill caused much controversy. The creation of the Public Works Administration and the 1949 U.S. Federal Housing Act helped quickly to clear and acquire the land on which &quot;slum and blighted&quot; areas of Downtown&#x27;s Bunker Hill were situated. The city cleared the land and sold this land to private and public development according to the plan made by the CRA.
The project is the longest redevelopment project in Los Angeles history. The majority of the skyscrapers on Bunker Hill were built in the 1980s, with a new skyscraper or two being finished nearly every year. However, the momentum died down in the 1990s, shortly after the 52-story Two California Plaza was finished. In 1999, the vacancy rate for downtown commercial skyscrapers was 26%, one of the highest in the nation for that time. Planned office towers were canceled, including California Plaza Three.

===21st century adaptive re-use===
A sign of the success of the downtown renaissance was the lower office vacancy rate for the fourth quarter of 2004 at 16%, compared to 19% for 2003, and 26% for 1999.

==== Affordable housing ====
While developers are primarily building market-rate housing on Bunker Hill today, Los Angeles has very strict laws, rules, and ordinances established that promote the inclusion of all income levels into the residential mix. Some examples include incentives for the creation of affordable housing (rather than market-rate housing), the preservation of existing affordable housing, the development of affordable housing by the city itself (rather than waiting for private developers), and others. The city has written documentation regarding the development of affordable housing.

On the topic of building affordable housing for very low-income to moderate-income, Principal City Planner Jane Blumenfeld said, &quot;We are trying to make it attractive to build [downtown] and get this added affordable housing that we normally wouldn&#x27;t have. We need an adequate amount of lower income housing so that in 20 years Downtown doesn&#x27;t become an exclusive neighborhood.&quot;

The Emerson apartment building, owned by the Related Companies, has 271 units, of which 216 are leased at market rates. The other 55 units are at subsidized rates to tenants whose annual incomes are less than 50% of the local median, which was $42,700 for a family of four in 2014.

== Notable features ==

=== &quot;Library Steps&quot; ===
The double stairway public art installation &quot; Library Steps&quot; was designed by Lawrence Halprin in 1989. It physically and symbolically connects the main entrance of the Los Angeles Public Library at Fifth Street with Hope Place and the Kechum-Downtown YMCA to the north. The double stairs flank a cascading river rock &quot;stream&quot; that flows from the pool surrounding Robert Graham&#x27;s 1992 public art sculpture &quot;Source Figure,&quot; and terminate at Fifth Street with a fountain element and seating.

=== Angels Flight Railway ===
The 1901 Angels Flight funicular railway, originally connecting Hill Street and Olive Street immediately south of the east end of the 3rd Street Tunnel, was dismantled in 1969, relocated approximately further south and rebuilt in 1996 to connect Hill Street with California Plaza.

=== Public venues ===
Contributing to the resurgence of Bunker Hill has been the construction of public venues, such as Walt Disney Concert Hall and the Museum of Contemporary Art.

The Broad modern art museum opened next to Disney Concert Hall on September 20, 2015.

==In popular culture==
===Video games===
&quot;L.A. Noire&quot;, the 2011 Video Game set in 1947 Los Angeles, features a close recreation of the area in that period.

===Film===
In the 1940s and 1950s, Bunker Hill was a popular film setting, especially in the film noir genre, because of its Victorian homes, its rambling hillside apartments and flophouses, its Angels Flight funicular, and its mean (or at least mean-looking) streets. It was used extensively in such crime films as &quot;Cry Danger&quot; (1951), &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot; (1956), &quot;Criss Cross&quot; (1949), Joseph Losey&#x27;s &quot;M&quot; (1951), and &quot;Angel&#x27;s Flight&quot; (1965).

Director Curtis Hanson re-created Bunker Hill in another hilly neighborhood altogether in his Oscar Award–winning &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; (1997). Kent Mackenzie made a film in 1956 called &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; about the displacement of the residents who had to make way for construction. Another film by Mackenzie that was set in the area —his neo-realist and semi-documentary feature &quot;The Exiles&quot; (1961) — depicts the lives of a tribe of urban Indians on Bunker Hill in the late 1950s.

===Books===
Bunker Hill is the setting for much of Robin Robertson&#x27;s 2018 verse narrative &quot;The Long Take&quot; which won the 2018 Goldsmiths Prize. The book includes a map of the old Bunker Hill neighbourhood. Robertson discussed his fascination with the district on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;The Film Programme&quot; in March 2019.

&quot;Dreams from Bunker Hill&quot; (1982) is the last novel written by John Fante before his death. On April 8, 2010, the day of the 101st anniversary of the writer&#x27;s birth, &quot;John Fante Square&quot; was inaugurated at the intersection of Fifth Street and Grand Avenue.

==Services==
=== Emergency services ===
The Los Angeles Police Department&#x27;s Central Community Police Station serves Downtown Los Angeles, including Bunker Hill.

The Los Angeles Fire Department&#x27;s Central Bureau serves Downtown Los Angeles, including Bunker Hill. The LAFD operates Fire Station 3 (Civic Center/Bunker Hill) in the area.

===Education===
The area is served by the Los Angeles Unified School District.

<doc id="1342819" wikidata="Q2142347" url="?curid=1342819" title="Environmental factor">
<text>An environmental factor, ecological factor or eco factor is any factor, abiotic or biotic, that influences living organisms. Abiotic factors include ambient temperature, amount of sunlight, air, soil, water and pH of the water soil in which an organism lives. Biotic factors would include the availability of food organisms and the presence of biological specificity, competitors, predators, and parasites.

== Overall ==

An organism&#x27;s genotype (e.g., in the zygote) translated into the adult phenotype through development during an organism&#x27;s ontogeny, and subject to influences by many environmental effects. In this context, a phenotype (or phenotypic trait) can be viewed as any definable and measurable characteristic of an organism, such as its body mass or skin color.

Apart from the true monogenic genetic disorders, environmental factors may determine the development of disease in those genetically predisposed to a particular condition. Pollution, stress, physical and mental abuse, diet, exposure to toxins, pathogens, radiation and chemicals found in almost all personal-care products and household cleaners are common environmental factors that determine a large segment of non-hereditary disease.

If a disease process is concluded to be the result of a combination of genetic and &quot;environmental factor&quot; influences, its etiological origin can be referred to as having a multifactorial pattern.

Cancer is often related to environmental factors. Maintaining a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet, minimizing alcohol and eliminating smoking reduces the risk of developing the disease, according to researchers.

Environmental triggers for asthma and autism have been studied too.

==Exposome==
The exposome encompasses the set of human environmental (i.e. non-genetic) exposures from conception onwards, complementing the genome. The exposome was first proposed in 2005 by cancer epidemiologist Christopher Paul Wild in an article entitled &quot;Complementing the genome with an &quot;exposome&quot;: the outstanding challenge of environmental exposure measurement in molecular epidemiology&quot;. The concept of the exposome and how to assess it has led to lively discussions with varied views in 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2021.

In his 2005 article, Wild stated, &quot;At its most complete, the exposome encompasses life-course environmental exposures (including lifestyle factors), from the prenatal period onwards.&quot; The concept was first proposed to draw attention to the need for better and more complete environmental exposure data for causal research, in order to balance the investment in genetics. According to Wild, even incomplete versions of the exposome could be useful to epidemiology. In 2012, Wild outlined methods, including personal sensors, biomarkers, and &#x27;omics&#x27; technologies, to better define the exposome. He described three overlapping domains within the exposome:
# a general external environment including the urban environment, education, climate factors, social capital, stress,
# a specific external environment with specific contaminants, radiation, infections, lifestyle factors (e.g. tobacco, alcohol), diet, physical activity, etc.
# an internal environment to include internal biological factors such as metabolic factors, hormones, gut microflora, inflammation, oxidative stress.

In late 2013, this definition was explained in greater depth in the first book on the exposome.
In 2014, the same author revised the definition to include the body&#x27;s response with its endogenous metabolic processes which alter the processing of chemicals. More recently, evidenced by metabolic exposures in and around the time of pregnancy, the maternal metabolic exposome includes exposures such as maternal obesity/overweight and diabetes, and malnutrition, including high fat/high calorie diets, which are associated with poor fetal, infant and child growth, and increased incidence of obesity and other metabolic disorders in later life.

==Measurement==
For complex disorders, specific genetic causes appear to account for only 10-30% of the disease incidence, but there has been no standard or systematic way to measure the influence of environmental exposures. Some studies into the interaction of genetic and environmental factors in the incidence of diabetes have demonstrated that &quot;environment-wide association studies&quot; (EWAS, or exposome-wide association studies) may be feasible. However, it is not clear what data sets are most appropriate to represent the value of &quot;E&quot;.

==Research initiatives==
As of 2016, it may not be possible to measure or model the full exposome, but several European projects have started to make first attempts.
In 2012, the European Commission awarded two large grants to pursue exposome-related research. The HELIX project at the Barcelona-based Centre for Research in Environmental Epidemiology was launched around 2014, and aimed to develop an early-life exposome. A second project, Exposomics, based at Imperial College London, launched in 2012, aimed to use smartphones utilising GPS and environmental sensors to assess exposures.

In late 2013, a major initiative called the &quot;Health and Environment-Wide Associations based on Large Scale population Surveys&quot; or HEALS, began. Touted as the largest environmental health-related study in Europe, HEALS proposes to adopt a paradigm defined by interactions between DNA sequence, epigenetic DNA modifications, gene expression, and environmental factors.

In December 2011, the US National Academy of Sciences hosted a meeting entitled &quot;Emerging Technologies for Measuring Individual Exposomes.&quot; A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention overview, &quot;Exposome and Exposomics&quot;, outlines the three priority areas for researching the occupational exposome as identified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has invested in technologies supporting exposome-related research including biosensors, and supports research on gene–environment interactions.

==Proposed Human Exposome Project (HEP)==

The idea of a Human Exposome Project, analogous to the Human Genome Project, has been proposed and discussed in numerous scientific meetings, but as of 2017, no such project exists. Given the lack of clarity on how science would go about pursuing such a project, support has been lacking. Reports on the issue include:
* a 2011 review on the exposome and exposure science by Paul Lioy and Stephen Rappaport, &quot;Exposure science and the exposome: an opportunity for coherence in the environmental health sciences&quot; in the journal &quot;Environmental Health Perspectives&quot;.
* a 2012 report from the United States National Research Council &quot;Exposure Science in the 21st Century: A Vision and A Strategy&quot;, outlining the challenges in systematic evaluations of the exposome.

==Related fields==
The concept of the exposome has contributed to the 2010 proposal of a new paradigm in disease phenotype, &quot;the unique disease principle&quot;: Every individual has a unique disease process different from any other individual, considering uniqueness of the exposome and its unique influence on molecular pathologic processes including alterations in the interactome. This principle was first described in neoplastic diseases as &quot;the unique tumor principle&quot;. Based on this unique disease principle, the interdisciplinary field of molecular pathological epidemiology (MPE) integrates molecular pathology and epidemiology.

== Socioeconomic drivers ==
Global change is driven by many factors; however the five main drivers of global change are: population growth, economic growth, technological advances, attitudes, and institutions. These five main drivers of global change can stem from socioeconomic factors which in turn, these can be seen as drivers in their own regard.  Socioeconomic drivers of climate change can be triggered by a social or economic demand for resources such as a demand for timber or a demand for agricultural crops.  In tropical deforestation for instance, the main driver is economic opportunities that come the extraction of these resources and the conversion of this land to crop or rangelands. These drivers can be manifested at any level, from the global level demand for timber all the way to the household level.

An example of how socioeconomic drivers affect climate change can be seen in the soy bean trading between Brazil and China. The trading of soy beans from to Brazil and China has grown immensely in the past few decades. This growth in trade between these two countries is stimulated by socioeconomic drivers. Some of the socioeconomic drivers in play here are the rising demand for Brazilian soy beans in China, the increase in land use change for soy bean production in Brazil, and the importance of strengthening foreign trade between the two countries. All of these socioeconomic drivers have implications in climate change. For instance, an increase in the development for soy bean croplands in Brazil means there needs to be more and more land made available for this resource. This causes the general land cover of forest to be converted into croplands which in its own regard has an impact on the environment. This example of land use change driven by a demand of a resource, isn&#x27;t only happening in Brazil with soy bean production.
Another example came from The Renewable Energy Directive 2009 Union when they mandated biofuel development for countries within their membership. With an international socioeconomic driver of increasing the production biofuels comes affects in land use in these countries. When agricultural cropland shift to bioenergy cropland the original crop supply decreases while the global market for this crop increases. This causes a cascading socioeconomic driver for the need for more agricultural croplands to support the growing demand. However, with the lack of available land from the crop substitution to biofuels, countries must look into areas further away to develop these original croplands. This causes spillover systems in countries where this new development takes place. For instance, African countries are converting savanna&#x27;s into cropland and this all stems from the socioeconomic driver of wanting to develop biofuels. Furthermore, socioeconomic driver that cause land use change don&#x27;t all occur at an international level. These drivers can be experienced all the way down to the household level. Crop substitution doesn&#x27;t only come from biofuel shifts in agriculture, a big substitution came from Thailand when they switched the production of opium poppy plants to non-narcotic crops. This caused Thailand&#x27;s agricultural sector to grow, but it caused global rippling effects (opium replacement).

For instance, in Wolong China, locals use forests as fuelwood to cook and heat their homes. So, the socioeconomic driver in play here is the local demand for timber to support subsistence in this area. With this driver, locals are depleting their supply for fuelwood so they have to keep moving further away to extract this resource. This movement and demand for timber is in turn contributing to the loss of pandas in this area because their ecosystem is getting destroyed.

However, when researching local trends the focus tends to be on outcomes instead of on how changes in the global drivers affect outcomes. With this being said, community level planning needs to be implemented when analyzing socioeconomic drivers of change.

In conclusion, one can see how socioeconomic drivers at any level play a role in the consequences of human actions on the environment. These drivers all have cascading effects on land, humans, resources, and the environment as a whole. With this being said, humans need to fully understand how their socioeconomic drivers can change the way we live. For instance, going back to the soy bean example, when the supply can&#x27;t meet the demand for soy beans the global market for this crop increases which then in turn affects countries that rely on this crop for a food source. These affects can cause a higher price for soy beans at their stores and markets or it can cause an overall lack of availability for this crop in importing countries. With both of these outcomes, the household level is being affected by a national level socioeconomic driver of an increased demand for Brazilian soy beans in China. From just this one example alone, one can see how socioeconomic drivers influence changes at a national level that then lead to more global, regional, communal, and household level changes. The main concept to take away from this is the idea that everything is connected and that our roles and choices as humans have major driving forces that impact our world in numerous ways.

<doc id="1342821" wikidata="Q3178811" url="?curid=1342821" title="Tumult of Aranjuez">
<text>The Tumult of Aranjuez (), also known as the Mutiny of Aranjuez, was an uprising led against King Charles IV that took place in the town of Aranjuez, Spain, on 17–19 March 1808. The event, which is celebrated annually in the first week of September, commemorates the fall of the monarch and the subsequent accession of his son Ferdinand VII. It is celebrated in September rather than in March as the revived celebrations in Aranjuez that began in 1988 were added on top of pre-existing September festivals.

The revolt was instigated by disgruntled citizens and by Ferdinand&#x27;s supporters.

== Causes of the Tumult ==
Before the mutiny, Charles IV&#x27;s &quot;valido&quot;, or prime minister, Manuel de Godoy, a former member of the Royal Guard, had become unpopular among both the nobles and the Spanish people.

The nobility resented how Godoy had attained power even though he was born in poverty and obscurity. Most notable among them was the King&#x27;s own son Ferdinand, who had led the El Escorial Conspiracy a few months earlier. The people were upset about Godoy&#x27;s ambitious nature, his flirting with many women of the court and his willingness to have Catholic Spain make treaties with atheist Revolutionary France against Christian (though Anglican) Great Britain.

Another important factor was the economic crisis affecting the country, which was heightened after Spain lost its navy in the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. This had impaired trade with the United States, causing food shortages and affecting industrial production.

In addition, under the terms of the Treaty of Fontainebleau, the King and Godoy had allowed French Emperor Napoleon&#x27;s troops to cross Spain to attack Portugal. This move was extremely unpopular with the Spanish people, who saw the entry as a humiliating invasion, which it soon became. French troops rapidly occupied the important cities of San Sebastián, Pamplona, and Barcelona, fuelling Spanish resentment towards Godoy.

== Mutiny ==
The uprising took place on 17 March 1808 in Aranjuez, about south of Madrid, where the royal family and the government were staying while on their way south, anticipating a French invasion from the north. Soldiers, peasants, and members of the general public assaulted Godoy&#x27;s quarters and captured him. The mutineers made King Charles dismiss Godoy, and, two days later, the court forced the King himself to abdicate in favor of his son and rival, who became King Ferdinand VII.

== Aftermath ==
In 1808 Napoleon, under the false pretense of resolving the conflict, invited both Charles IV and Ferdinand VII to Bayonne, France. Both were afraid of the French ruler&#x27;s power and thought it appropriate to accept the invitation. However, once in Bayonne, Napoleon forced them both to renounce the throne and grant it to himself. The Emperor then named his brother Joseph Bonaparte king of Spain. This episode is known as the Abdications of Bayonne, or &quot;Abdicaciones de Bayona&quot; in Spanish.

<text>Butch Patrick (born Patrick Alan Lilley; August 2, 1953) is an American actor and musician. Beginning his professional acting career at the age of seven, Patrick is perhaps best known for his role as child werewolf Eddie Munster on the CBS comedy television series &quot;The Munsters&quot; from 1964 to 1966 and in the 1966 feature film &quot;Munster, Go Home!&quot;, and as Mark on the ABC Saturday morning series &quot;Lidsville&quot; from 1971 to 1973.

==Life and career==
Patrick Alan Lilley was born on August 2, 1953, in Inglewood, California. He was spotted by a talent agent at the age of seven, which led to a series of appearances in television commercials and guest appearances on TV shows. In 1961 he made his feature-film debut in the 20th Century Fox comedy–fantasy &quot;The Two Little Bears&quot;, in which he co-starred with Eddie Albert and Jane Wyatt.

Over the next two years, Patrick went on to appear in guest-starring roles on numerous television series, including &quot;Ben Casey&quot;, &quot;Alcoa Premiere&quot;, &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;Mister Ed&quot;, and &quot;Rawhide&quot; and recurring roles on &quot;The Real McCoys&quot; and &quot;General Hospital&quot;. These roles would have him appear opposite headliners including Judy Garland, Burt Lancaster, and Sidney Poitier.

When recounting how he began his acting career, Patrick explained &quot;I owe my career to my sister. She was the one who got me started and gave me all the encouragement. She always wanted to be an actress and was on the casting call sheet one day. She was asked if there were any other children at home. She told them about me, and I got some small roles, then some bigger ones...&quot;

In 1964 while living in Geneseo, Illinois, just east of the Quad Cities, Patrick landed the role of child werewolf Eddie Munster, starring alongside Fred Gwynne as Herman Munster, Yvonne De Carlo as Lily Munster and Al Lewis as Grandpa, on the CBS television series &quot;The Munsters&quot;, a fantasy situation comedy loosely based on Universal&#x27;s movie monsters. The role of Eddie was originally portrayed by child actor Happy Derman in the pilot episode before Patrick was ultimately selected out of hundreds of boys for the role.

When asked how he landed the role of Eddie, Patrick recalled &quot;I had a lot of experience. But maybe it was because my fangs were my own teeth. My teeth were so bad, that even when I closed my mouth they stuck out. I was about a head smaller than the other kids, and they liked that because it played off Herman&#x27;s height.&quot; Living on the East Coast at the time, Patrick commuted to Los Angeles every week during filming of the series, appearing in 70 episodes during &quot;The Munsters&quot;″ two-season run from 1964 to 1966.

In an April 2017 interview, when asked if he recalled his TV mother (Yvonne De Carlo) hiding tiny portions of dialogue around the set, attaching them to props to help jog her memory, so the dialogue could be added to her performance: &quot;No, not in &quot;The Munsters&quot; she wasn&#x27;t doing that. Maybe later in life. Because sometimes your memory starts slipping on you. But that&#x27;s a great idea, actually! I&#x27;ll have to remember that!&quot;.

He also was asked if he had kept in touch with his on-screen family after &quot;The Munsters&quot; was canceled, especially De Carlo, who died on January 8, 2007. He replied, &quot;No, after the show ended, everyone went their own ways. But in the early &#x27;80s, I contacted Al Lewis and we became friends and I started attaching myself to the Munster name and brand. And then 10 years after that I started talking to Yvonne. I was actually a guest on &quot;The Vicki Lawrence Show&quot; where I was this surprise guest brought out for Yvonne and after that we became friends. I started visiting her and she was somewhat of a recluse, living in North Los Angeles and I introduced her to this guy in Hollywood who would send her care packages, movies to watch and sort of get her back in the loop of Hollywood.&quot;

After &quot;The Munsters&quot; ended, Patrick continued to appear in guest-starring roles on various popular television series of the 1960s, including &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;, &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; , &quot;The Monkees&quot;, &quot;Daniel Boone&quot;, and &quot;Adam-12&quot;, as well as a recurring role as Gordon Dearing on the CBS family comedy series &quot;My Three Sons&quot;. During this time, Patrick also appeared in several Disney films, including &quot;The Young Loner&quot;, &quot;The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band&quot;, and &quot;Way Down Cellar&quot; on TV&#x27;s &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot;. He also portrayed the role of Milo in the MGM live-action/animated film &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot;, which had been filmed in 1967 and completed in 1968, but was held up from release until late 1970 due to internal studio problems.

In 1971, Patrick landed the starring role on Sid and Marty Krofft&#x27;s Saturday morning children&#x27;s program &quot;Lidsville&quot;, broadcast on ABC. In the psychedelic fantasy series, Patrick portrayed Mark, a boy lost in a strange land of walking, talking, singing hats, opposite veteran character actors Charles Nelson Reilly and Billie Hayes. The show was in production from 1971 to 1973.

In 1975, Patrick left acting to work for his father and began to learn to play the bass guitar. In 1983, he recorded the song, &quot;Whatever Happened to Eddie?&quot; (b/w &quot;Little Monsters&quot;), with several instrumentalists and backup singers under the group name &quot;Eddie and the Monsters.&quot; Set to the tune of the &quot;Munsters&quot; theme, the song details his life as a Munster. (&quot;You might wonder why I have a dragon for a pet—well, he&#x27;s just there to keep me company on the set.&quot;) The single was released by Rocshire Records. In 2007 Patrick recorded a song &quot;It&#x27;s Only Halloween&quot; that was released on Park Lane Drive Records.

In addition to his music, Patrick returned to occasional film and television work, including making cameo appearances as &quot;Himself&quot; on episodes of the Fox animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and the 2003 comedy film &quot;Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star&quot;, as well as appearing as a grown-up Eddie Munster in a Little Caesars Pizza commercial.

In 2002, Patrick co-hosted &quot;Macabre Theatre&quot; with Natalie Popovich, aka &quot;Ivonna Cadaver&quot;. That same year he also appeared in the first episode of the E! Network celebrity dating reality television show &quot;Star Dates&quot;.

Patrick made a cameo appearance in the 2005 retro-horror film &quot;Frankenstein vs. the Creature from Blood Cove&quot;, directed by William Winckler, playing a man who had become a werewolf, speaking a line of dialogue in comical reference to &quot;The Munsters&quot;.

==Personal life==
On September 11, 2016, Patrick married his long-term girlfriend Leila Murray.

<text>Gustave Anjou (December 1, 1863 – March 2, 1942) was a self-professed genealogist who prepared hundreds of fraudulent pedigrees. His first name is sometimes spelled &quot;Gustav&quot;.

==Biography==
Born in Katarina Parish in Stockholm, Sweden, Anjou was the natural son of Carl Gustaf Jungberg and his housekeeper Maria Lovisa Hagberg. After serving a prison term in 1886 for forgery, Anjou changed his name to &quot;Gustaf Ludvig Ljungberg&quot; and then began using the alias &quot;Gustave Anjou&quot; (based on the maiden name of his fiancé, Anna Maria Anjou). Usually he used the alias &quot;Gustave Anjou,&quot; but occasionally he also used the aliases &quot;H. Anjou&quot; and &quot;M. Anjou.&quot; Gustave and Anna Maria married in 1889. Later in life, Gustaf claimed to have been born in Paris, France, including this birthplace on his application to become a naturalised American citizen in 1918.

After emigrating to the U.S. in 1890, Anjou took up residence on Staten Island (Richmond County, New York) and became a naturalized citizen in 1918. 

Anjou died on March 2, 1942, at Tottenville, Staten Island, and was buried in Fairview Cemetery (at West New Brighton, Castleton Corners, New York City). He was predeceased by both his Swedish-born wife Anna Maria Anjou (Oct. 21, 1860 – July 6, 1922) and by his only child.

==Genealogical fraud==

Few if any names in genealogical circles draw the outrage that Anjou enjoys. He presented himself as a professional genealogist, and his services were employed by many East Coast (USA) families in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1910, the New York City Directory reported: &quot;British-Am Record Soc, 116 Nassau R [Residence] 1116--C. Percy Hurditch, Pres ; Gustave Anjou. Sec.&quot;, and in 1912, it reported, &quot;Am Genealogical Soc., 116 Nassau R 1117 - Gustave Anjou, Sec.&quot; Anjou initially earned a reputation for providing copious amounts of research to back up his findings, much to the delight of his clients. For his &quot;findings,&quot; Anjou&#x27;s services were expensive for the day and he became quite well off.

Subsequent scholarly investigation of Anjou&#x27;s findings revealed flawed research with the intent to defraud. In 1991, genealogists Robert Charles Anderson and Gordon L. Remington wrote companion articles in the &quot;Genealogical Journal&quot;, a publication of the Utah Genealogical Association, elaborating on the nature and extent of the fraud committed by Anjou.

Anderson&#x27;s article &quot;We Wuz Robbed, The &#x27;Modus Operandi&#x27; of Gustave Anjou&quot; described the manner in which Anjou fabricated the genealogies he prepared. Anderson wrote:
&quot; A typical Anjou pedigree displays four recognizable features:
# A dazzling range of connections between dozens of immigrants to New England; for example, connections far beyond what may be seen in pedigrees produced by anyone else.
# Many wild geographical leaps, outside the normal range of migration patterns.
# An overwhelming number of citations to documents that actually exist, and actually include what Anjou says they include; and
# Here and there an invented document, without citation, which appears to support the many connections noted under item 1 above.&quot;
Remington&#x27;s article, &quot;Gustave We Hardly Knew Ye: A Portrait of Herr Anjou as a Jungberg&quot;, revealed Anjou&#x27;s true identity through exposing the identity of his real biological father.

Anjou&#x27;s fakery has also been well documented by the late Donald Lines Jacobus, founder of &quot;The American Genealogist&quot;. The totality of research shows that Anjou&#x27;s works are unreliable and they are not respected in professional genealogical circles.

<text>Great Nicobar is the southernmost and largest of the Nicobar Islands of India, north of Sumatra. It is part of India, in the Nicobar district within the union territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

==History==

The Nicobar Island has been well known to Indian mariners since the time of the seafaring Cholas.

In the 15th century, Great Nicobar Island was recorded as &quot;Cui Lan island&quot; (翠蘭嶼) during the voyages of Zheng He in the Mao Kun map of the Wu Bei Zhi.

The Nicobar islands were claimed by Denmark in 1755; Great Nicobar Island was called &quot;New Denmark&quot;, and the whole of the Nicobars &quot;Frederikøerne&quot;. The islands were administered from the Tranquebar the headquarters of the Danish East Indian company, but were often abandoned due to Malaria outbreaks. The rights to the islands were sold to the British in 1868 along with the rest of the Danish holdings in India.

Great Nicobar Island was severely affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake tsunami with many deaths, and was cut off from all outside contact for over a day.

==Geography==
Great Nicobar is located to the north of the island of Sumatra. The island covers 
but is sparsely inhabited, with a population of 8067. It is largely covered by rainforest and known for its diverse wildlife.

== Topography ==
The island has several rivers, including the Alexandra, Amrit Kaur, Dogmar and Galathea. Virtually all rivers flow in a southern or southwesterly direction, which is indicative of the general slope of the terrain across the island. There are undulating hills throughout the island, with the main range running in a north–south orientation. Mount Thullier, which is part of this range, has the highest elevation of any point in the Nicobars, at 642 m above sea level.

Indira Point (6°45’10″N and 93°49’36″E) is the southernmost point of the Great Nicobar Island and India itself. Indira Point subsided 4.25 m in the 26 December 2004 tsunami and the lighthouse there was damaged. The lighthouse was subsequently made functional.

== Ecology ==
The island is part of the Nicobar Islands rain forests ecoregion. Plant communities include mangroves and coastal forests near the seashore, and evergreen and deciduous forests in the interior.

The majority of the island is designated as the Great Nicobar Biosphere Reserve— home to many unique and endemic species of plants and animals including the Nicobar scrubfowl (&quot;Megapodius nicobariensis&quot;, a megapode bird), the edible-nest swiftlet (&quot;Aerodramus fuciphagus&quot;), the Nicobar long-tailed macaque (&quot;Macaca fascicularis umbrosa&quot;), saltwater crocodile (&quot;Crocodylus porosus&quot;), giant leatherback sea turtle (&quot;Dermochelys coriacea&quot;), Malayan box turtle, Nicobar tree shrew, reticulated python (&quot;Python reticulatus&quot;) and the giant robber crab (or coconut crab, &quot;Birgus latro&quot;).

==Demography==
The island is home to the Shompen people.

== Transportation ==
There is a 915m airstrip at Campbell Bay/Tenlaa on the East coast.
* Seaport: At least one small shipping dock is located in Campbell Bay.
* The International Container Transshipment Terminal, Great Nicobar Island is a proposed mega transshipment deep water port.

==Naval air station==

The INS Baaz naval air station, near Campbell Bay, is under the joint-services Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC) of the Indian Armed Forces. It is the southernmost air station of the Indian Armed Forces.

== Great Nicobar Development Plan ==
The Great Nicobar Development Plan is a massive infrastructure plan (including a major transshipment port, airport, and future strategic defense) for the southern tip of Great Nicobar Island, India. The plan has generated criticism over the consequences of deforestation and giant leatherback sea turtle nesting sites. The plan was proposed on 18 January 2021 by an Indian policy think tank (NITI Aayog) and informed by a feasibility report written by AECOM India Private Limited. Environmental Justice groups have pushed back claiming that the development plan would make it unlikely that the leatherback sea turtles would continue to nest in the Galathea Bay and negatively impact the nomadic livelihoods of the indigenous Shompen people. Survival International, a global NGO campaigning for indigenous rights, has said that the mega-development will put the Shompen at risk of being wiped out. In February 2024, 39 genocide experts from 13 countries warned that the development  “will be a death sentence for the Shompen, tantamount to the international crime of genocide”. They said that the proposed population increase and exposure to outside populations would lead to mass deaths because the Shompen have little to no immunity to infectious outside diseases. The NITI Aayog plan envisages 650,000 people inhabiting the island by 2050. Its current population is only around 8,500. In fact, the total population of the archipelago, composed of over 500 islands of which only around 40 are inhabited, is around 380,000. The population increase is expected to impose a significant ecological pressure on the island and its surroundings.

==Indira Point==

Indira Point is the name of the southernmost point of Republic of India. It is situated on Great Nicobar Island in the Nicobar Islands, which are located in the eastern Indian Ocean at 6°45’10″N and 93°49’36″E. This is not on the Indian mainland, but within the Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The name of the point was changed from Pygmalion Point on 18 October 1985 in commemoration of Indira Gandhi. It was formerly known by various names that include Pygmalion Point, Parsons Point, and for a brief period India Point.

It is located 540 km and more than a day&#x27;s sea voyage from Port Blair, the capital city and main port of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It is approximately 163 km by sea from Sumatra, Indonesia. Rondo Island, Indonesia&#x27;s northernmost island in Sabang district of Aceh province of Sumatra, lies south of Indira point. India and Indonesia are planning to collaborate to construct a port at Sabang to protect the channel between Great Nicobar Island and Rondo Island (c. May 2019).

===Indira Point lighthouse===
Indira Point has a 35 m high cast iron (with red and white bands) lighthouse with 16 nautical miles range. The lighthouse has (RACON (Code &#x27;G&#x27;) ii DGPS station) with a 300 mm 4 panel revolving light inside a 2.5 m diameter lantern house (BBT). It is an important landmark on the international shipping lane Colombo-Singapore route via Malacca Strait that passes south of Indira Point. It also has a helipad.

===2004 tsunami===
The tsunami which resulted from the Indian Ocean earthquake of 2004 inundated much of the area. This partly damaged the lighthouse, which subsided 4.25 m. As a result of this subsidence, the coast retreated and the sea moved permanently inland. The lighthouse has since been repaired.

The base of the lighthouse was 5 m above sea level when constructed in 1972. After the tsunami, the sea floor fell and the base was less than 1 m above sea level. Since then, the subsidence has decreased somewhat as the ocean floor slowly rebounds, and the lighthouse base become more elevated. Indira point was mostly submerged.

The city or &quot;comune&quot; of Florence was both the capital of the province of Florence, and of the Region of Tuscany. It had an area of and a population of 1,012,180 as of 31 December 2014. The territory of the province was the birthplace of the Italian Renaissance.

In 2015 the province was replaced by the Metropolitan City of Florence.

==Geography==
The Province of Florence was bordered by the Province of Bologna in the north, the Province of Ravenna and Forlì-Cesena in the north-east, the provinces of Prato, Pistoia, Pisa and Lucca in the west; the Province of Siena in the south and the Province of Arezzo in the east and southeast.

<doc id="1342844" wikidata="Q582439" url="?curid=1342844" title="2005 World Men's Curling Championship">
<text>The 2005 [[World Men&#x27;s Curling Championship]] (branded as 2005 [[Ford of Canada|Ford]] World Men&#x27;s Curling Championship for sponsorship reasons) was held from April 2–10, 2005 at the new Save-on-Foods Memorial Centre in Victoria, British Columbia. The tournament was the first since the 1988 event that was held separately from the 2005 World Women&#x27;s Curling Championship (held in Paisley, Scotland in March 2005). The winner was Randy Ferbey and his team from Canada. Ferbey won his fourth world championship, the rest of his team won their third. As a country, it was Canada&#x27;s 29th World Championship. Scotland won silver, and Germany bronze.

For the first time ever, the World championships used the page playoff system where the top four teams with the best records at the end of round-robin play meet in the playoff rounds.

==Teams==
One reason for the separation of the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tournaments was to allow for an expansion from 10 to 12 teams. This expansion was deemed appropriate because more countries are now producing competitive rinks, particularly in Europe but also including Japan and even New Zealand. Teams included 3 time World Champion Randy Ferbey of Canada, 2002 Silver medallist Pål Trulsen of Norway, 2001 Silver medallist Andreas Schwaller of Switzerland, 1997 Silver medallist Andy Kapp of Germany, 2 time World bronze medallist Markku Uusipaavalniemi of Finland, 1993 bronze medallist Pete Fenson of the United States, 7 time World Championship participant Hugh Millikin of Australia, 3 time participant Sean Becker of New Zealand, 2 time participant Johnny Frederiksen of Denmark and making their first appearances were Stefano Ferronato&#x27;s team from Italy, David Murdoch&#x27;s team from Scotland and Eric Carlsén&#x27;s team from Sweden.

==Round-robin standings==
&quot;Final round-robin standings&quot;


To first break the massive 6-way tie at 8-3, the two teams with the best record against the other teams involved (Scotland and Germany) were given automatic playoff spots. The other teams were ranked based on their record against each other, or if that didn&#x27;t break the tie, a draw to the button which occurred before the tournament began. These other four teams then played tie-breakers to determine the other 2 playoff spots. The winning teams of the tiebreakers should match up in a 3vs4 game to determine the other semi finalist

<doc id="1342852" wikidata="Q4722601" url="?curid=1342852" title="Alfred E. Woodward">
<text>Alfred Eno Woodward II (December 15, 1913 – February 20, 2007) was an American attorney and jurist who served as the Chief Judge of the 18th Judicial Circuit Court, DuPage County, Illinois, from 1973 to 1975. He was the father of reporter and author Bob Woodward.

==Early life and education==
Woodward was born on December 15, 1913, in Sandwich, Illinois, to Alfred E. Woodward I (1870–1936) and Mabel Coleman (1873–1952). Mabel and Alfred had three children, including John Woodward.

Woodward attended Oberlin College in Ohio on a football scholarship in 1931, where he majored in political science. In 1934, he was captain of the college football team and he graduated in 1935. After graduation, he attended the Northwestern University School of Law, where he graduated in 1938.

==Career==
After getting his law degree, Alfred moved to Wheaton, Illinois, where he joined his brother, John, who operated a law partnership. Alfred married Jane Barnes around 1940, then joined the United States Navy with the rank of ensign and served in the Pacific Theater, as a communications officer. He married Jane Upshur and had two sons and a daughter, Robert Upshur Woodward, in 1943, David Woodward, and Anne Woodward. Alfred was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant in 1945. He was discharged from the Navy in January 1946 and he went home to Wheaton and joined his brother&#x27;s law firm. Later after a divorce, Alfred would marry Alice Elizabeth Ensko (1924–1999) who had three children of her own, Lynn, Michael, and Susan, and they had one daughter together, Wendy Woodward.

In 1950, Alfred became a full partner in his brother&#x27;s law firm of Rathje and Woodward along with Louis Rathje, cousin of Frank C. Rathje. He later served as President of the DuPage County Bar Association, starting in 1956. In 1967, he was elected to the American College of Trial Lawyers. He became a judge on the Eighteenth Judicial Circuit Court of Illinois in 1970 and was Chief judge from 1973 to 1975. He left the Eighteenth in 1977 and was appointed to the Second District Appellate Court.

Alfred Woodward retired from the bench at age 81 in 1994. The Second District Appellate Court then appointed him to serve as that Court&#x27;s representative on the Agency&#x27;s Board of Commissioners in June 1996. He was also a fellow of the Illinois Bar Foundation.

==Death==
Woodward died of congestive heart failure on February 20, 2007. He had been hospitalized with Alzheimer&#x27;s for several years. Alfred was buried in Wheaton Cemetery.

<text>Robert Alexy (born 9 September 1945 in Oldenburg, Germany) is a jurist and a legal philosopher.

Alexy studied law and philosophy at the University of Göttingen. He received his J.D. in 1976 with the dissertation &quot;A Theory of Legal Argumentation&quot;, and he achieved his Habilitation in 1984 with a &quot;Theory of Constitutional Rights&quot;.

He is a professor at the University of Kiel and in 2002 he was appointed to the Academy of Sciences and Humanities at the University of Göttingen. In 2010 he was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany.

Since 2008 the Universities of Alicante, Buenos Aires, Tucumán, Antwerp, National University of San Marcos in Lima, Prague, Coimbra, Porto Alegre, Belo Horizonte, Chapecó, Rio de Janeiro and Bogotá awarded him the honorary doctorate degree.

== Natural law theory ==

Alexy&#x27;s definition of law looks like a mix of Kelsen&#x27;s normativism (which was an influential version of legal positivism) and Radbruch&#x27;s legal naturalism (Alexy, 2002), but Alexy&#x27;s theory of argumentation (Alexy, 1983) puts him very close to legal interpretivism.

In &quot;The Argument From Injustice&quot;, Alexy defends Radbruch&#x27;s formula that injust or evil laws only lose their legal validity when they deliberately disavow justice and equality. He formulated law&#x27;s relationship to morality on three theses:

* The thesis of incorporation; each legal system contains principles.
* The moral thesis; law must be related to a common moral.
* The correctness thesis; law must be related to a just moral.

At the heart of his theory is the claim to correctness: Law must necessarily claim to be correct, no matter how corrupt, lest it be self-contradictory and fundamentally illogical. As law coerces behaviour and gives individuals decisive reasons for acting, the correctness it claims must also be moral.

==Life==
Willigus was born in the Duchy of Saxony, possibly at Schöningen, the son of a free peasant. The able and intelligent young man received a good education, and was recommended by Bishop Volkold of Meissen to the service of Emperor Otto the Great. About 971, Willigis was appointed chancellor, an office formerly held by the emperor&#x27;s brother Archbishop Bruno of Cologne. Until 973 he served Otto throughout the last years of his reign and at the height of his power.

In 975 Emperor Otto II made him Archbishop of Mainz and Archchancellor for Germany. Of humble origin, Willigis had to cope with many objections; he immediately had Pope Benedict VII confirm his supremacy as metropolitan bishop. Soon he started to build the great Cathedral of Mainz. Willigis demanded solid learning in his clergy too. He was known as a good and fluent speaker. In March 975 he received the pallium from Pope Benedict VII. In January 976 Willigis probably consecrated the first Bishop of Prague, Thietmar (Dětmar) at Brumath in Alsace, whose diocese was put under his jurisdiction.

At the 983 &quot;Reichstag&quot; of Verona, Otto II vested him with large territories in the Rheingau region, thereby laying the foundations for the Prince-Bishopric of Mainz. Upon the emperor&#x27;s death, Willigis as &quot;Primas Germaniae&quot;, on Christmas 983 crowned his three-year-old son Otto III &quot;Rex Romanorum&quot; at Aachen. After the Dowager Empress Theophanu died in 991, Willigis became guardian of the minor, thus making him, together with Otto&#x27;s grandmother, Adelaide of Italy, &quot;de facto&quot; regent of the Empire until Otto III came of age in 994.

In 996 he was in the retinue of the King on his journey to Italy. Together with Otto III he pushed the election of Pope Gregory V against the resistance of the Roman nobility led by Crescentius the Younger and was present at the consecration and at the synod convened a few days later. In this council Willigis strongly urged the return of Bishop Adalbert of Prague, who, unable to bear the conflicts with the Vršovci noble family and the ruling Přemyslid dynasty, had left his diocese for a second time, to which, after much correspondence between the Holy See and Willigis, he had once already been forced to return in 993. In 997 Pope Gregory V sent the decrees of a synod at Pavia to Willigis, &quot;his vicar&quot;, for publication.

He was on friendly terms with Rome, though the papacy stood at its nadir. These relations were somewhat disturbed by the dispute of Willigis with Bishop Bernward of Hildesheim about jurisdiction in the house of secular canonesses at Gandersheim Abbey. The immediate monastery established in 852 was originally situated at Brunshausen in the Diocese of Hildesheim, but was transferred to nearby Gandersheim within the territorial limits of the Archdiocese of Mainz. Both bishops claimed jurisdiction, until Pope Sylvester II finally declared in favour of Hildesheim, against Willigis&#x27; initial resistance.

His protégé was the scholarly and just Burchard, who was appointed Bishop of Worms by Emperor Otto III in 1000. Upon the Emperor&#x27;s early death, Archbishop Willigis on 7 June 1002 crowned the Duke of Bavaria Henry IV as King of the Romans at Mainz, after the assassination of his rival Margrave Eckard I of Meissen. Willigis presided at the 1007 synod at Frankfurt am Main, where thirty-five bishops signed the bull of Pope John XVIII for the erection of the Diocese of Bamberg.

Though Willigis has never been canonized, Roman Catholics celebrate his feast on 23 February, the day of his death in 1011. It has also been alternatively given as 18 April.

==Builder==

In his diocese he laboured by building bridges, constructing roads, and fostering commerce. In Mainz he initiated the construction of the cathedral and consecrated it on 29 August 1009, dedicating it in honor of St. Martin of Tours, but on the same day, disastrously, it was destroyed by fire. Willigis immediately gave orders for reconstruction.

Willigis greatly helped the restoration of the old collegiate church of St. Victor and built that of St. Stephan. He also built churches at Brunnen in Nassau and Seesbach. He showed great solicitude for the religious, and substantially aided the monasteries of St. Ferrutius at Bleidenstadt, of Disibodenberg, and of Jechaburg in Thuringia. Because the cathedral had not yet been rebuilt, he was buried in the Church of St Stephan.

<text>Multi-memory controllers or memory management controllers (MMC) are different kinds of special chips designed by various video game developers for use in Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) cartridges. These chips extend the capabilities of the original console and make it possible to create NES games with features the original console cannot offer alone. The basic NES hardware supports only 40KB of ROM total, up to 32KB PRG and 8KB CHR, thus only a single tile and sprite table are possible. This limit was rapidly reached within the Famicom&#x27;s first two years on the market and game developers began requesting a way to expand the console&#x27;s capabilities.

In the emulation and Homebrew community, these chips are also known as &quot;mappers&quot;.

==List of MMC chips==
===CNROM===
* Manufacturer: Nintendo
* Games: &quot;Gradius&quot;, &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, &quot;Gyruss&quot;, &quot;Arkanoid&quot;

CNROM is the earliest banking hardware introduced on the Famicom, appearing in early 1986. It consists of a single 7400 series discrete logic chip. CNROM supports a single fixed PRG bank and up to eight CHR banks for 96KB total ROM. Some third party variations supported additional capabilities. Many CNROM games store the game level data in the CHR ROM and blank the screen while reading it.

===UNROM===
* Manufacturer: Nintendo
* Games: &quot;Pro Wrestling&quot;, &quot;Ikari Warriors&quot;, &quot;Mega Man&quot;, &quot;Contra&quot;, &quot;Castlevania&quot;

Early NES mappers are composed of 7400 series discrete logic chips. UNROM appeared in late 1986. It supports a single fixed 16KB PRG bank, the rest of the PRG being switchable. Instead of a dedicated ROM chip to hold graphics data (called CHR by Nintendo), games using UNROM store graphics data on the program ROM and copy it to a RAM on the cartridge at run time.

===MMC1===

* Manufacturer: Nintendo
* Games: &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, &quot;Mega Man 2&quot;, &quot;Metroid&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, and more.
The MMC1 is Nintendo&#x27;s first custom MMC integrated circuit to incorporate support for saved games and multi-directional scrolling configurations.
The chip comes in at least five different versions: &quot;MMC1A&quot;, &quot;MMC1B1&quot;, &quot;MMC1B2&quot;, &quot;MMC1B3&quot; and &quot;MMC1C&quot;. The differences between the different versions are slight, mostly owing to savegame memory protection behavior. The MMC1 chip allows for switching of different memory banks. Program ROM can be selected in 16KB or 32KB chunks, and character ROM can be selected in 4KB or 8KB chunks. An unusual feature of this memory controller is that its input is serial, rather than parallel, so 5 sequential writes (with bit shifting) are needed to send a command to the circuit.

===MMC2===
* Manufacturer: Nintendo
* Games: &quot;Mike Tyson&#x27;s Punch-Out!!&quot;
The MMC2 is only used in &quot;Mike Tyson&#x27;s Punch-Out!!&quot; and the later rerelease which replaced Mike Tyson. A single 8KB bank of program ROM can be selected (with the remaining 24KB locked) and character ROM can be selected in &quot;two pairs&quot; of 4KB banks, which would be automatically switched when the video hardware attempts to load particular graphic tiles from memory, thus allowing a larger amount of graphics to be used on the screen without the need for the game itself to manually switch them.

===MMC3===

* Manufacturer: Nintendo
* Games: &quot;Mega Man 3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot;NA/EU, &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;, &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Adventure&quot;, and more.
The MMC3 was introduced in 1988. It adds an IRQ timer to allow split screen scrolling without the sacrifice of sprite 0, along with two selectable 8KB program ROM banks and two 2KB+four 1KB selectable character ROM banks, which allows easy instant swapping of sprite and tile data. 8KB of save game RAM is supported.

===MMC4===
* Manufacturer: Nintendo
* Games: &quot;Fire Emblem&quot;, &quot;Fire Emblem Gaiden&quot;, and &quot;Famicom Wars&quot;
This chip is only used in three games, all of which were released only for the Famicom in Japan, and were developed by Intelligent Systems. Functionally, it is nearly identical to the MMC2, with the only difference being that the MMC4 switches program ROM in 16KB banks instead of 8KB banks and has support for a battery-backed SRAM to save game data.

===MMC5===
* Manufacturer: Nintendo
* Games: &quot;Castlevania III: Dracula&#x27;s Curse&quot;NA/EU, &quot;Just Breed&quot;, &quot;Metal Slader Glory&quot;, &quot;Laser Invasion&quot;, &quot;Uchuu Keibitai SDF&quot;, &quot;Nobunaga&#x27;s Ambition II&quot;, &quot;Nobunaga no Yabou - Sengoku Gunyuu Den&quot;, &quot;Bandit Kings of Ancient China&quot;, &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms II&quot;, &quot;Uncharted Waters&quot;, &quot;Genghis Khan II: Clan of the Gray Wolf&quot;, &quot;Gemfire&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Empereur&quot;, &quot;Ishin no Arashi&quot;, &quot;Shin 4 Nin Uchi Mahjong - Yakuman Tengoku&quot;, &quot;Rockman 4 Minus Infinity&quot; (ROM hack)

The MMC5 is Nintendo&#x27;s most advanced MMC. It was originally also the most expensive. Only Koei used this chip regularly. It is similar to Konami&#x27;s VRC6, but interrupt handling works differently. The chip has 1KB of extra RAM, two extra square wave sound channels, one extra PCM sound channel, support for vertical split screen scrolling, improved graphics capabilities (making 16,384 different tiles available per screen rather than only 256, and allowing each individual 8x8-pixel background tile to have its own color assignment instead of being restricted to one color set per 2x2 tile group), highly configurable program ROM and character ROM bank switching, and a scanline-based IRQ counter. The MMC5 supports up to 2MB total ROM, however no commercially released game exceeded 1MB.

===MMC6===
* Manufacturer: Nintendo
* Games: &quot;StarTropics&quot;, &quot;Zoda&#x27;s Revenge: StarTropics II&quot;
The MMC6 is similar to the MMC3, with an additional 1 KB of RAM which can be saved with battery backup.

===Famicom Disk System===
* Manufacturer: Nintendo
* Games: &quot;Akumajo Dracula&quot;, &quot;Arumana no Kiseki&quot;, &quot;Ai Senshi Nicol&quot;, &quot;Big Challenge! Dogfight Spirit&quot;, &quot;Bio Miracle Bokutte Upa&quot;, &quot;Crackout&quot;JP, &quot;Double Dribble&quot;JP, &quot;Dracula II&quot;, &quot;Falsion&quot;, &quot;Famicom Tantei Club Part II: Ushiro ni Tatsu Shōjo&quot;, &quot;Kid Icarus&quot;JP, &quot;KiKi KaiKai&quot;, &quot;Meikyuu Jiin Dababa&quot;, &quot;Metroid&quot;JP, &quot;Pro Wrestling&quot;JP, &quot;Relics - Ankoku Yousai&quot;, &quot;Risa no Yōsei Densetsu&quot;, &quot;Shin Onigashima&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot;JP, &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; (FDS release), &quot;The Mysterious Murasame Castle&quot;, &quot;Vs. Excitebike&quot;, &quot;Yūyūki&quot;, &quot;Zelda II: The Adventure of Link&quot;JP, and more.

The Famicom Disk System&#x27;s ASIC is an extended audio chip, which supports one channel of single-cycle (6-bit × 64 step) wavetable-lookup synthesis with a built in phase modulator (PM) for sound generation similar to that of frequency modulation synthesis. Some cartridge conversions of Disk System games have MMCs to replace the audio channel.

===AOROM===
* Manufacturer: Nintendo
* Games: &quot;Battletoads&quot;, &quot;Wizards &amp; Warriors&quot;, &quot;Cobra Triangle&quot;, &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;
The A*ROM MMC, named after the AMROM, ANROM, and AOROM cartridge boards that use it, was developed by Chris Stamper of Rare, and manufactured by Nintendo. It is found in games developed by Rare for Nintendo, Tradewest, GameTek, Acclaim, and Milton Bradley. It allows the PRG ROM to be switched in a single 32KB piece and uses CHR RAM for up to 256KB total ROM. Unlike other chips, it uses one screen mirroring.

==Third-party chips==
Nintendo maintained tight control over internationally-released cartridge hardware and did not allow third parties to use their own PCBs and mappers. This remained the case until late in the NES&#x27;s commercial lifespan when Nintendo eased up the restrictions. As a result, most third party mappers will only be found in Famicom or unlicensed cartridges.

===VRC1===
* Manufacturer: Konami, Jaleco (SS8805)
* Games: &quot;Exciting Boxing&quot;, &quot;Ganbare Goemon! Karakuri Douchuu&quot;, &quot;Jajamaru Ninpouchou&quot;, &quot;King Kong 2: Ikari no Megaton Punch, Moero!!&quot;, &quot;Junior Basket: Two on Two&quot;, &quot;Tetsuwan Atom&quot;

===VRC2===
* Manufacturer: Konami
* Games: &quot;Contra&quot;JP, &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;JP, &quot;Akumajō Special: Boku Dracula-kun&quot;
The VRC2 is a chip from Konami that allows program ROM to be switched in 8KB banks, and character ROM to be switched in 1KB banks. This MMC has two known revisions: VRC2a and VRC2b.

===VRC3===
* Manufacturer: Konami
* Games: &quot;Salamander&quot;JP
Exclusively used in the Japanese version of &quot;Salamander&quot;.

===VRC4===

* Manufacturer: Konami
* Games: &quot;Gradius II&quot;JP, &quot;Crisis Force&quot;, &quot;Bio Miracle:Boku tte Upa&quot;, &quot;Ganbare Goemon Gaiden 2&quot;, &quot;WaiWai World&quot;, &quot;WaiWai World 2&quot;, &quot;Twinbee 3&quot;
The VRC4 Chip is similar to the VRC2 chip, other than the VRC4 allowing for 512KB CHR capacity, 2 8KB PRG ROM banking modes and 1 screen mirroring.

===VRC5===
* Manufacturer: Konami
* Games: &quot;Space School&quot;JP
Exclusively used in the QTa adapter in Konami&#x27;s &quot;Space School&quot; series of educational games.

===VRC6===

* Manufacturer: Konami
* Games: &quot;Akumajō Densetsu&quot;, &quot;Mōryō Senki MADARA&quot;, &quot;Esper Dream II&quot;
The VRC6 (Virtual Rom Controller) is an advanced MMC chip from Konami, supporting bank switching for both program code and graphics as well as a CPU cycle–based IRQ counter, which can also act as a scanline counter. The chip also contains support for three extra sound channels (two square waves of eight duty cycles each, which can be configured to play PCM samples using 100% duty cycle, and one sawtooth wave). It is used in &quot;Akumajō Densetsu&quot;, the Japanese version of &quot;Castlevania III: Dracula&#x27;s Curse&quot;, while the Western version uses the MMC5 from Nintendo. Since the Nintendo Entertainment System by design does not allow cartridges to add additional sound channels, the Famicom version&#x27;s soundtrack was reworked to follow those specifications; the soundtrack for the Western version utilizes the five stock sound channels built into the NES.

===VRC7===

* Manufacturer: Konami, Yamaha
* Games: &quot;Lagrange Point&quot;, &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures 2: Trouble in Wackyland&quot;JP
The VRC7 is an advanced MMC chip from Konami, supporting bank switching and IRQ counting equivalent to the VRC6, as well as containing a YM2413 derivative providing 6 channels of 2-op FM synthesis. The advanced audio hardware is used only in the Famicom game &quot;Lagrange Point&quot;. The Japanese version of &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures 2&quot; also uses the VRC7 but does not take advantage of the extended audio. A disadvantage of the extended audio portion is that it produces some quantization noise, noticeable at lower notes. This was a carryover from the YM2413, which the VRC7&#x27;s FM chip is based on.

===Namco 163===
* Manufacturer: Namco
* Games: &quot;Erika to Satoru no Yume Bōken&quot;, &quot;Final Lap&quot;, &quot;King of Kings&quot;, &quot;Mappy Kids&quot;, &quot;Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei II&quot;, &quot;Namco Classic II&quot;, &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms II&quot;, &quot;Yokai Dochuki&quot;, &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot;JP, &quot;Top Striker&quot;
The 163 has been only used in games exclusive to Japan. Its capabilities were a little better than Nintendo&#x27;s MMC3. A variant contained extra sound hardware that plays 4-bit wave samples. It supports 1 to 8 extra sound channels, but audible aliasing appears when a sufficiently large number of channels are enabled due to the increasingly audible time-division multiplexing.

===FME-7===
* Manufacturer: Sunsoft
* Games: &quot;&quot;, &quot;Hebereke&quot;, and more.
The FME-7 is a memory mapping circuit developed by Sunsoft for use in NES and Famicom cartridges. It switches program ROM in 8KB banks and switches the character ROM 1KB banks. It also contains hardware to generate IRQ signals after a specified number of CPU clock cycles, thus achieving split-screen effects with minimal use of processing power.

===SUNSOFT-4===

* Manufacturer: Sunsoft

===SUNSOFT 5B===
* Manufacturer: Sunsoft
* Games: &quot;Gimmick!&quot;
This version of the FME-7 contains a variant of the widely used Yamaha YM2149 (SSG), a derivative of the popular AY-3-8910 chip.

==Unlicensed MMCs==
Some individual (homebrew) and unlicensed developers have made custom MMCs for the NES, most of which simply expand the available memory.

===228===
* Manufacturer: Active Enterprises
* Games: &quot;Action 52&quot;, &quot;Cheetahmen II&quot;
228 is a simple bank switching MMC developed for use in the games &quot;Action 52&quot; and &quot;Cheetahmen II&quot;. It does not have a nametable control bit. In the &quot;Action 52&quot; multicart, it also contains a small 16-bit register area that contains the old menu selection when exiting a game.

===GTROM===
* Manufacturer: Membler Industries
GTROM or Cheapocadabra is a self-flashable MMC developed in 2015 for the homebrew market. The board contains 512K of PRG ROM, 16K of CHR ROM, and two LEDs. While the GTROM does not contain PRG RAM, saved games are possible due to PRG ROM being flashable by NES software.

===MXM-1===
* Manufacturer: Something Nerdy Studios
* Games: &quot;Former Dawn&quot;
MXM-1 is a custom MMC developed in 2022 for use in the homebrew game &quot;Former Dawn&quot;. Unlike most unlicensed MMCs, it greatly expands upon the feature set of the stock NES, allowing it to use 8x1 attributes for using more colors while also featuring FMV playback, expanded audio (8 channels of PCM audio with an echo buffer, wavetable support, and smooth sinc function based interpolation) and direct access to 768M of ROM (indirectly 2.8G) and 1M of RAM.

<doc id="1342884" wikidata="Q1428947" url="?curid=1342884" title="Flipper (1996 film)">
<text>Flipper is a 1996 American adventure film and a remake of the 1963 film of the same name (which in turn began a TV series that ran from 1964 to 1967). Written and directed by Alan Shapiro, the film stars Elijah Wood as a boy who has to spend the summer with his uncle (Paul Hogan), who lives on the Florida Gold Coast. Although he expects to have a boring summer, he encounters a dolphin whom he names Flipper and with whom he forms a friendship.

The film is unrelated to the 1995–2000 TV series of the same name that was itself also a remake of the 1963 film and 1964 TV series. Instead of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, a production company for the &quot;Flipper&quot; franchise, this film is distributed by Universal Pictures.

== Plot ==
Sandy Ricks is sent off for the summer to stay with his Uncle Porter in the seaside town of Coral Key. Initially, Sandy is unenthusiastic and disappointed that he is not going to a Red Hot Chili Peppers concert. His mood remains unchanged even after meeting Cathy, a local shopkeeper with whom his uncle carries on a flirtatious relationship, and Kim, a girl his own age.

While out on Porter&#x27;s fishing trawler, they meet Porter&#x27;s enemy, Dirk Moran. Nearby, a pod of bottlenose dolphins is frolicking near Dirk&#x27;s boat. As a big game fisherman, Dirk Moran makes it plain that he hates just about every other fish-eating animal on earth and shoots at the pod, which ends with a dolphin being fatally shot. Sandy meets a dolphin that escaped Dirk&#x27;s shooting and eventually names it Flipper.

The next morning, Porter and Sandy are paid a visit by Sheriff Buck Cowan, who explains that they cannot keep the dolphin unless he is in captivity. That night, Sandy and Kim set out on a dinghy to look for Flipper. They fail to locate the dolphin but see the dumping of barrels off of Dirk Moran&#x27;s boat. The next morning, as Kim arrives looking for Sandy, Pete, Porter&#x27;s pet brown pelican, comes running as if asking her to follow him. Pete leads Kim to Flipper, who is beached on the shore and sick. They manage to cure Flipper anyhow.

Cathy determines that Flipper has been poisoned by toxic waste, which is also shown to have been ruining the local fishing. The group uses Flipper&#x27;s ability of echolocation and a special camera attached to his head to help them locate the barrels of toxic waste. Flipper also manages to locate and reunite with the rest of his pod, dropping the camera in the process. Porter rushes back to alert the sheriff about the barrels. Sandy, however, becomes concerned that something has happened to Flipper, and without informing anyone except Cathy&#x27;s young son, Marvin, he sets off in the dinghy to find him.

Sandy barely survives an encounter with Dirk Moran&#x27;s boat, which dismantles the dinghy. He sees an approaching dorsal fin and thinks it is Flipper, but it is actually Scar, a large great hammerhead shark that has been lurking in the island&#x27;s waters and is said to have taken out a tourist boat. Sandy swims for his life towards Dirk&#x27;s boat. As Scar is about to attack Sandy, Flipper appears and starts nose-butting him in the gills. There is a harrowing moment when Scar proves stronger than Flipper, but Flipper&#x27;s dolphin pod comes to his aid in the nick of time and drives Scar away. Dirk Moran is then arrested by the sheriff for illegally dumping toxic waste and attempting to kill Sandy since he knew that he saw them that night.

The next morning, when Sandy&#x27;s mother Martha and younger sister Bua arrive to pick him up, there is a commotion. It is Flipper, who has come to see Sandy off.

== Production ==
Alan Shapiro had initially been working on a &quot;Archie&quot; adaptation for Universal Pictures until management changed their minds and asked Shapiro to write and direct an adaptation of &quot;Flipper&quot; instead. Shapiro had no interest in &quot;Flipper&quot; and initially rejected the idea but took on the project due to the difficulty in getting a film off the ground and was interested in the film making required for such a film which he referred to as &quot;Jaws&quot;-lite.

The film was shot in the Bahamas. Animatronic dolphins, designed by Walt Conti and his team, had to be used extensively, such as in scenes where Flipper interacts with the human characters or is shown swimming along. Conti stated that using real dolphins does not work as well as many might think. Nevertheless, a trio of real dolphins did interact with star Elijah Wood during production, with Wood saying that he enjoyed the opportunity to swim with them.

== Reception ==

=== Box office ===
The film debuted at number 2 at the US box office behind &quot;Twister&quot; with $4.5 million. &quot;Flipper&quot; ultimately grossed $20.1 million in the United States and Canada and $35.5 million worldwide on a $25 million budget.

=== Critical response ===
Joe Leydon of &quot;Variety&quot; criticized the plot, but appreciated the performances of Hogan, Wood, Wesson, Hayes and Field, as well as the animatronic work on the film. Dwayne E. Leslie of Boxoffice noted the scene where a hammerhead shark attacks a seabird, which brings to mind similar footage from National Geographic, may be shocking for very young children.

Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 30% approval rating based on reviews from 20 critics. 
On Metacritic it has a score of 43% based on reviews from 19 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.
Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of &quot;A−&quot; on a scale of A+ to F.

=== Accolades ===

The film&#x27;s tagline, &quot;This summer it&#x27;s finally safe to go back in the water,&quot; references the tagline of the 1978 feature film &quot;Jaws 2&quot;, &quot;Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water...&quot;

== Home media ==
&quot;Flipper&quot; was first released on VHS on October 8, 1996. The film was then released on DVD in 2003 by Universal Studios Home Entertainment, available in both 16x9 anamorphic widescreen and 4x3 fullscreen editions. In 2007, a widescreen-only print of &quot;Flipper&quot; was released in a four-film package alongside &quot;The Little Rascals&quot;, &quot;Casper&quot;, and &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot;. Dubbed &quot;Family Favorites 4 Movie Collection: Franchise Collection&quot;, all four films are based on popular TV shows. &quot;Flipper&quot; was later released on Blu-ray on February 8, 2011.

== Early life and education ==
Idrissa Akuna Elba was born on 6 September 1972 in the London Borough of Hackney, to Winston Elba, a Sierra Leonean man who worked at the Ford Dagenham plant, and Eve, a Ghanaian woman. His parents were married in Sierra Leone and later moved to London. Elba was raised in Hackney and East Ham and shortened his first name to &quot;Idris&quot; while at school in Canning Town, where he first became involved in acting.

Elba credits &quot;The Stage&quot; with giving him his first big break. After seeing an advertisement for a play, he auditioned and subsequently met his first agent while performing in the role. In 1986, he began helping an uncle with his wedding DJ business; within a year, he had started his own DJ company with some of his friends.

Elba briefly attended Barking and Dagenham College, leaving school in 1988 and winning a place in the National Youth Music Theatre after a £1,500 Prince&#x27;s Trust grant. To support himself between roles in his early career, he worked in odd jobs including tyre-fitting, cold-calling and night shifts at Ford Dagenham. He worked in nightclubs under the DJ nickname &quot;Big Driis&quot; during his adolescence, but began auditioning for television roles in his early twenties.

== Career ==
=== 1994–2004: Early roles and &quot;The Wire&quot; ===
Elba&#x27;s first acting role was in &quot;Crimewatch&quot; murder reconstructions, and in 1994, he appeared in a BBC children&#x27;s drama called &quot;The Boot Street Band&quot;. In 1995, he landed his first significant role on a series called &quot;Bramwell&quot;, a medical drama set in 1890s England. In an episode of series 1, he played a central character, an African petty thief named Charlie Carter, who lost his wife to childbirth and had to figure out how to support his newborn daughter. His first named role arrived earlier in 1995 when he was cast as a gigolo on the &quot;Sex&quot; episode of &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;. Many supporting roles on British television followed, including series such as &quot;The Bill&quot; and &quot;The Ruth Rendell Mysteries&quot;. He joined the cast of the soap opera &quot;Family Affairs&quot; and went on to appear on the television serial &quot;Ultraviolet&quot; and later on &quot;Dangerfield&quot;. He decided to move to New York City soon afterward. He returned to England occasionally for a television role, such as a part in one of the &quot;Inspector Lynley Mysteries&quot;. In 2001, Elba played Achilles in a stage production of &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; in New York City. In 1997, he starred in the first two episodes of the second series &quot;Blood, Sweat and Tears&quot; in &quot;Silent Witness&quot;. After a supporting turn on a 2001 episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, Elba landed a starring role on the HBO drama series &quot;The Wire&quot;. From 2002 to 2004, Elba portrayed Stringer Bell in the series, perhaps his best-known role in the United States.

=== 2005–2019: &quot;Luther&quot; and stardom ===

In 2005, he portrayed Captain Augustin Muganza in &quot;Sometimes in April&quot;, an HBO film about the Rwandan genocide. Elba appeared on the 2007 BET special &quot;Black Men: The Truth&quot;. He appeared as Charlie Gotso on &quot;The No. 1 Ladies&#x27; Detective Agency&quot;, filmed in Botswana. The series premiered on 23 March 2008, Easter Sunday, on BBC One, receiving a high 6.3  million viewers and 27% of the audience share. In January 2009, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Elba would portray Charles Miner, a new rival to Dunder Mifflin regional manager Michael Scott (Steve Carell) for NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Office&quot;. Elba appeared in a six-episode story arc later in the 2009 season, as well as the season finale. In September 2009, he signed a deal to star as the lead role on the six-part BBC television series &quot;Luther&quot;, which aired in May 2010. He appeared on Showtime&#x27;s &quot;The Big C&quot; in 2010. At the 69th Golden Globe Awards telecast on 15 January 2012, Elba won Best Actor in a Miniseries or Television Film for his role on the BBC crime thriller series &quot;Luther&quot;.

In 2007, Elba signed on to play the lead role of the film &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Little Girls&quot;, playing Monty, a blue-collar mechanic who falls in love with an attorney helping him gain custody of his kids, and finds the relationship and his custody hopes threatened by the return of his former wife. He appeared in &quot;28 Weeks Later&quot; (2007) and &quot;This Christmas&quot; (2007), which brought in nearly $50 million (~$ in ) at the box office in 2007. In 2008, he starred in the horror film &quot;Prom Night&quot; and the Guy Ritchie London gangster film &quot;RocknRolla&quot;. In 2009, he starred in the horror film &quot;The Unborn&quot; and in &quot;Obsessed&quot;, a thriller that had him cast opposite Beyoncé. The latter was a box office success, taking $29  million in its opening weekend. Elba&#x27;s next film was &quot;Legacy&quot; (2010), in which he portrayed a black ops soldier who returns to Brooklyn after a failed mission in Eastern Europe, where he has undertaken a journey looking for retribution. He starred in Dark Castle&#x27;s adaptation of DC/Vertigo&#x27;s &quot;The Losers&quot;, under the direction of Sylvain White, in the role of Roque, the second-in-command of a black-ops team out for revenge against a government that did them wrong. Filming took place in Puerto Rico, and the movie was released in April 2010. Elba appeared in the thriller &quot;Takers&quot; (2010).

In the August 2009 issue of &quot;Essence&quot;, he announced the title of his six-song EP as &quot;Kings Among Kings&quot;. He released his EP &quot;High Class Problems Vol. 1&quot; in the United Kingdom in February 2010, for which he has won many prizes, including a &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards nomination.

Michelle&#x27;s &quot;The Rebellious Soul Musical&quot; which debuted on VH1 on 19 August 2014. In May, Elba featured on Mr Hudson&#x27;s single &quot;Step Into the Shadows&quot;.

Elba is also featured on the Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis album &quot;This Unruly Mess I&#x27;ve Made&quot; (2016). He had the idea to develop the music from his album &quot;Idris Elba Presents Mi Mandela&quot; into a show, which eventually resulted in a play called &quot;Tree&quot; that premiered at the Manchester International Festival in 2019. However, authorship of the piece was disputed. On 2 July 2019, &quot;The Guardian&quot; published a story describing how writers Tori Allen-Martin and Sarah Henley said they had been removed from the production under what they described as questionable circumstances. The two writers had worked on the project for four years, following an approach from Elba asking them to develop his idea for a musical based on the album, on which Allen-Martin had also collaborated. Kwame Kwei-Armah joined the project in May 2018, and rewrote part of their material. At the time of its premiere, &quot;Tree&quot; was billed as &quot;created by Idris Elba and Kwame Kwei-Armah&quot;. Allen-Martin and Henley described their creative input as having included research and script-writing, as well as coming up with the play&#x27;s title, and that after being removed, they were threatened with legal action if they went public with the story.

In 2020, after hearing Canadian R&amp;B singer Emanuel&#x27;s debut single &quot;Need You&quot;, Elba reached out with an idea for a music video compiled from clips of people sharing the things that were helping them cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="1342893" wikidata="Q2278415" url="?curid=1342893" title="Sherman's Lagoon">
<text>Sherman&#x27;s Lagoon is a daily comic strip by Jim Toomey that is widely syndicated in newspapers worldwide after its first appearance in the &quot;Escondido Times-Advocate&quot; of Escondido, California, on May 13, 1991.

The story of Sherman&#x27;s Lagoon takes place in the fictional Kapupu Lagoon by the island of Kapupu in the South Pacific Ocean, west of the similarly fictional Elabaob Islands in the Palauan archipelago of Micronesia. It is centered on the misadventures of a lazy, overweight great white shark named Sherman, along with his controlling, hot-tempered wife Megan and the friends and foes who share their tropical home.

== Style ==
The strip&#x27;s artwork is detailed and appears in color. Although the characters live underwater, they are equipped with items like computers, laptops, iPods and other gadgets.

The strip is serialized, with the story running for a week or more on some occasions. The daily strip usually runs to four panels. The Sunday strip is in a two-tiered format with a large logo panel appearing on the left of the strip.

The strip&#x27;s humor is aimed at late teens and adults, with frequent lampoons of famous pop culture icons, and occasional jabs at political figures.

For the most part, the strip&#x27;s characters respond to killing prey to eat with indifference or coldness, as much of the plot revolves around what Sherman and Megan are going to eat for dinner. For instance, one comic had Megan declaring she was in the mood for Italian and the two sharks immediately sought to find an Italian swimming in the water. Also, a large group of tourists swimming in the lagoon is referred to as &#x27;the buffet&#x27;. Poodles are regarded as a delicacy, and Sherman regularly eats smaller fish that swim by. One strip saw a fish committing suicide by swimming into Sherman&#x27;s mouth while he yawned. Characters have also been seen going to shark-themed restaurants. (&#x27;Leg of Pam&#x27;, &#x27;Bloody Mary&#x27;s, and &#x27;Beans and Frank&#x27; have been named from the menu.) However, on one occasion Megan pulled a tourist under, then let him go unscathed, thus practicing her method of catch and release.

The strip occasionally breaks the fourth wall, with characters acknowledging that they are living in a comic strip. One such strip had Sherman asking Hawthorne when their new video series (called &#x27;Barnacle the Purple Arthropod&#x27;, a parody of Barney the Dinosaur) would be produced, and Hawthorne replying &#x27;It&#x27;s only been one panel.&#x27; &#x27;Felt like two.&#x27;
Another strip parodied Peanuts, with Hawthorne holding a football and Fillmore running to kick it. The ball rebounded off the side of the panel and hit Filmore in the head (this incident followed a conversation they had in which Hawthorne told Fillmore that he wouldn&#x27;t pull the ball away like Lucy Van Pelt because &#x27;We aren&#x27;t living in a comic strip&#x27;).

==Characters==

=== The Sharks ===

====Sherman====
The main character of the strip. Sherman is overweight, lazy and an eating machine. His immaturity and childlike personality frustrates his wife, Megan, to no end, and provides ample opportunities for some of his friends to blindly rip him off. Although not the most intelligent of all the characters, Sherman is a good-hearted great white shark and often tries to please his friends and family, but most of the time falls short because of his low IQ. On rare occasions, he has been shown bringing Megan gifts for no special reason and acting romantic; however, these instances are few and far between and most of the time he&#x27;s obnoxious, lazy and hopelessly out of touch with his wife. Some strips imply he cross-dresses. He often baits &quot;hairless beach apes&quot; with a variety of items attached to the end of a fishing rod, including beer bottles, wallets, and other props. In addition, Sherman likes to fight giant squid, sometimes for dinner, sometimes just for fun, and at least once over a loan. Dolphins and giant squids are his two seaborne enemies. One recurring storyline is the &#x27;roadtrips&#x27; he takes with his best friend Ernest to places like the Ganges River, the Nile, the Amazon, and various other places. In a serial published in 2004, he and his wife Megan had a baby shark whom they named Herman. Since then, some of the strip&#x27;s serials have focused on Sherman and Megan&#x27;s amusing attempts to care for their newborn child. A series of strips brought in the concept of shark finning and Sherman was actually &#x27;finned&#x27; and died. In &#x27;Shark Heaven&#x27; the angel said there were already too many sharks there, so he would give him a second chance.

====Megan====
Sherman&#x27;s controlling wife. She always wears a string of pearls around her neck (this also distinguishes her from Sherman in the black-and-white strips during the week). She quite possibly possesses the most fiery temper and personality of the comic strip, and easily intimidates other characters to get her own way. Hawthorne considers her a bossy control freak. Fillmore is downright terrified of her and also considers her a control freak. She is a perfectionist and a control freak; however, she can be just as lazy as her husband. She seldom if ever listens to her husband (which is implied in a strip to be part of the reason Sherman married her since he says a lot of stupid things). Her activities include cooking, shopping, caring for Herman, fishing for humans with Sherman, and often threatening Hawthorne for a number of practical jokes played on her. She almost always ends up coming to her husband&#x27;s rescue, whether saving him from a swarm of tiger prawns or preventing Hawthorne from stealing all his money. Although she often expresses her frustration with Sherman (and has threatened him more than once) she does love him deep down. She is an avid follower of Martha Stewart and has thrown parties in her honor in several strips. A semi-recurring storyline is Megan&#x27;s attempts to be accepted into rich clubs, one of them being SnobCrest. However she is always turned away, either because of Sherman or her own rough personality. On occasion, Megan has also fought giant squids. She can also be a bit mean spirited. Megan decides to run for school president because she wants to have unlimited power and immediate approval for her every whim.

====Herman====
Son of Megan and Sherman. His birth appeared in the April 26, 2004 daily strip after a serialization on Megan&#x27;s pregnancy that first appeared in the January 25, 2004 Sunday strip. He was named after one of Sherman&#x27;s brothers. Shortly after his birth, he suffered from an eye disease that placed both eyeballs on the side of his head. Sherman confessed to Megan that it was the result of a recessive flounder gene in his side of the family (incidentally, Sherman also used this opportunity to tell Megan that he never thought Seinfeld was funny). He appears to be a good, well-behaved child, only going out of control when Fillmore volunteered to babysit him (although when he was given a bucket in which to put his toys, the only thing he managed to do was pee in it). He appears to take after his father, once coming in first place in a baby drooling contest. Now, though, he talks and grows up like a normal kid.

====Herman #2====
Sherman&#x27;s annoying and obnoxious twin brother who takes up residence in Lake Erie. He is hated by Megan and not regarded fondly by his brother (who was given &#x27;good-morning&#x27; swirlies by him as a child). He&#x27;s also shown ignorance, as when introduced to Thornton he thought the bear was Polish because he was from the North Pole. Herman met his death twice in the series: once when Megan &#x27;accidentally&#x27; harpooned him at the breakfast table, and again when he willingly donated his brain in lieu of Sherman&#x27;s, who went brain dead from watching too much of the O.J. trial. When the other characters found Sherman&#x27;s brain (which had been taken by a fish during surgery) they decided to freeze Herman&#x27;s in tin foil rather than try to return it. He has not been seen in the strip since.

==== Rupert ====
Sherman&#x27;s nephew. He was a minor character in earlier strips, showing up now and then to be educated by Sherman, as Herman hadn&#x27;t been born yet. His character wasn&#x27;t developed much and his appearances were few and far between. He soaked up everything Sherman told him, even adopting his now retired catchphrase, &quot;Can I eat this?&quot;

===The Turtles===
====Fillmore====
The lonely bachelor sea turtle of the comic strip. Fillmore&#x27;s hobbies include reading, caring for his adopted son, and having as many conversations with the other sea creatures as possible. Most of the time he is seen simply leaning against a rock reading a novel, and acts as sort of a straight man for the other more outgoing characters. Once a year, Fillmore makes the long trip to Ascension Island in hopes of finding a permanent mate. However, he strikes out every year, due to his hopeless nerdiness, his complete lack of ability to even engage in a simple conversation with a girl, his overpowering cologne, and his pompous, arrogant attitude. However, he once won the Ascension Island challenge and had an entire island of she-turtles to himself. He promptly fainted from shock and missed out again. He has come close on a few occasions, but the only female to ever fall completely in love with him was an enormous sea elephant, thanks to Ernest&#x27;s &#x27;pheromone cologne&#x27;. One serial even saw the turtle transform into a woman for nearly two months of the comic&#x27;s duration because he hadn&#x27;t had a mate for so long. During one trip to Ascension Island, he found a baby sea turtle and adopted him, naming him Clayton. He wishes his lagoon neighbors would act more sophisticated and has been shown watching Masterpiece Theater and operas. He possesses a kind heart, and most of the time simply wants someone to talk to. He is also somewhat controlling as he is often quick to criticize. He has stated in one strip that he is a Virgo. He is also completely unaware of his own faults despite his friends pointing them out. This suggests he has a narcissistic personality.

====Clayton====
Fillmore&#x27;s adopted son. He was found hatching on the beach after Fillmore arrived on Ascension Island for nesting season (only to find that the entire event had been canceled). The moment he was born, Clayton was nearly devoured by a seagull, but was saved by Fillmore. Clayton&#x27;s first words are thought to be &quot;300 megahertz microprocessor,&quot; but he is seen speaking earlier in the strip&#x27;s history. Clayton attends boarding school, though he occasionally comes home to visit his father and figurative &quot;Uncle Sherman&quot;. His computer skills possibly match those of Ernest, as he once stated that he could make eBay crash. Clayton is usually seen wearing a baseball cap.

=== The Fish ===

==== Ernest ====
The brainy fish of the strip. He is Sherman&#x27;s best friend, as they share the same maturity level (due to Ernest&#x27;s young age). He wears thick, oversized glasses on his nose. Ernest can gain access to virtually any computer in the world and has hacked into almost every file on the internet (he once ordered Vermont to declare war on Canada). He is also known for his crazy inventions, such as a chip that takes control of peoples&#x27; brains. He also built a probe and sent it to Mars. Unfortunately, it was destroyed by Sherman. He has gone on many adventures with Sherman to exotic places in the world, such as the sunken RMS Titanic, the Amazon River, the Ganges, and a Russian lake in Abkhazia. On one of their adventures they found themselves in a fountain in Las Vegas and ended up gambling away all their money in a casino (as well as several of Sherman&#x27;s teeth). Like Hawthorne, he hates Bill Gates. He is seldom the central character in the strip&#x27;s serials; his role is usually solving the lagoon&#x27;s problems. He once used his computer skills to crash a tanker filled with Prozac in the lagoon to stop a pod of suicidal whales from beaching themselves. On occasion, he is the cause of the lagoon&#x27;s problems (in one strip he tapped into an undersea cable and caused a worldwide telecommunications failure). He was also almost arrested once for illegally downloading every movie on the planet, but wired them all into Fillmore&#x27;s computer, causing him to be sent to prison instead. Little is known about his family, though earlier strips showed him being one of several dozen brothers and sisters.

====Bob====
Bob the Bottom Dweller is a bottom-feeding sea creature whose species is unspecified, though he might be a type of flounder. He&#x27;s most often referred to as &quot;One of those really ugly fish.&quot; He doesn&#x27;t speak too often, aside from belching, and has a habit of eating stuff found on the bottom of the sea. Before Fillmore and Sherman discovered this, they thought he was singing opera, but they later discovered that he had swallowed a radio. In earlier strips he was less ugly and could talk, once being shown doing a Groucho Marx impression. In another strip he pulled a gun on the other characters for making fun of him. One of his few speaking lines was a shrill, &quot;AAGH! I&#x27;m hideous!&quot; after he wore a cursed necklace that made him look like Ted Koppel. Bob has returned to the strip in his original largely mute form: a spotted, big-lipped fish with bulging, misshapen eyes and a belching habit. Filmore once called him &#x27;an angry and sociapathic belcher&#x27;.

=== Other ===

====Hawthorne====
The scheming hermit crab of the strip. He is rude, abrasive, insulting, stingy, and a criminal. Hawthorne, unlike other hermit crabs, prefers a beer can rather than a seashell. His interests include scamming the other members of the strip out of money or resources, cracking jokes and insults, and pinching hairless beach apes (and Sherman). A recurring storyline is Hawthorne&#x27;s many get-rich-quick schemes and business ventures, usually tailored to rip his friends off. Some of his businesses have included a general store, a photo lab, an airline, a bank, a nuclear power plant, and a casino. His businesses usually flop, either due to bankruptcy, his own incompetence, or his losing interest in his own scheme. His ownership of the local newspaper, the Lagoon Tribune, appears to be the only business he has been able to manage through the course of the strip. He is also the Lagoon&#x27;s mayor from time to time. Later strips imply that he&#x27;s been in jail. Other ventures of his included using steroids on an oyster to get him to produce a pearl a day (eventually, Megan, not knowing that the oyster was Hawthorne&#x27;s, took it to make a Martha Stewart-style oyster provencalê for dinner). In earlier strips, Hawthorne would shed his shell once a year and simply strut around naked (nothing but his rear-end is seen). He also enjoyed mooning scuba divers and his friends and running around singing &quot;I feel pretty! Oh, so pretty!&quot; However, it later seems that he has removed his can for good and walks around in the buff, and his friends don&#x27;t show the disgust they did in earlier comics. His crab hole has been portrayed several different ways. Early on in the strip it was shown as a posh cave mansion with chandeliers, rugs, china cabinets, and luxurious furniture. It has been portrayed as the typical bachelor pad, housing a beat-up couch and socks and pizza crusts that move on their own. Although little is known about his past, he once revealed to Thornton that he was born in Las Vegas. He hates Windows computers, and therefore Bill Gates as well, once taking great pleasure in pinching his toes.

====Thornton====
The sleepy, hibernating polar bear of the strip. His first appearance was early on in the strip, when he apparently fell asleep on an iceberg and drifted into the lagoon. He has made it a point to show up every year to hibernate on the beach, sometimes not returning to the North Pole at all. He was much more active in early strips, as he was depicted waterskiing and attending windsurfing classes. He struggled with homesickness when first introduced, saying that piña coladas reminded him of the snowdrifts of home. When asked why he kept returning to the lagoon, he replied that the snowdrifts reminded him of piña coladas. He was shown once at the North Pole, accompanied by Hawthorne. There, his polar bear friends simultaneously guzzle Coca-Colas and the &#x27;pole&#x27; has been replaced by a Starbucks. Among other things, he sometimes serves as a guinea pig for Ernest&#x27;s experiments, once testing a mousse that made his hair fall out (he apparently has a tattoo on his butt that he got in the army). His relationship with Sherman has been portrayed as both a friendship and a rivalry. He loves to eat frozen tundra-lemmings, and has bragged of devouring an entire team of Russian scientists and their sled dogs. He grew more inactive as the strip progressed, being too lazy to even attend the birthday party Fillmore threw for him. He is mostly shown napping on the beach and drinking a smoothie out of a martini glass.

====Captain Quigley====
The ever-persistent fisherman trying to hunt down Sherman. Their rivalry apparently goes back years. Sherman once stated, &quot;My mother ate his mother.&quot; Quigley has used a number of different tools in his quest to catch Sherman, ranging from an ordinary fishing pole to a killer robot dolphin. One of his more elaborate traps was an exquisite chicken dinner laid on good china on a table with linen cloth (Sherman didn&#x27;t buy it because he didn&#x27;t believe red wine should be served with that dish). He caught Sherman once; however, Hawthorne rescued him &#x27;commando style&#x27; by rigging the fishing trawler to blow up; unfortunately, he forgot to get Sherman off first and almost killed him in the process. He also may have captured Fillmore. He seems to be constantly outwitted by the shark and his friends.

====Kahuna====
An undersea statue. He is possibly a deity, as stated in one strip, and is reminiscent of the moai on Easter Island. The other characters come to Kahuna for wisdom, though Kahuna&#x27;s logic cannot always be trusted as he was unable to help Ernest solve a simple word problem. He&#x27;s also known to have magic tiki powers. A recurring story element involves him transforming various characters (usually Sherman, Fillmore, and Hawthorn) into humans so they can attend activities such as a Rolling Stones concert, a Super Bowl, and others. On one occasion, it was said that he transformed Sherman into a Q-Tip for his own personal use. His arch-rival, a Polynesian fish deity, is Apo-Ko-Hai. A war was nearly started between the two because of Sherman&#x27;s gluttony, but Fillmore ended the conflict peacefully (except for Sherman, whom he made dress up like Dolly Parton). Kahuna has little tolerance for beer, and has stated that he is 800 years old. Revealed in a series of 2020 strips, Kahuna will lose his powers and turn into a normal statue unless he stands under a magic waterfall on a certain island in the lagoon every 500 years.

====Broderick====
A past character who is not remembered. He is a seahorse who wears thick glasses similar to Ernest&#x27;s and a striped tie. His character wasn&#x27;t developed much, as he often appeared in crowd scenes or strips where another straight man was needed. His character was retired in the early 1990s.

=== Enemies ===

====The Giant Squid====
Sherman&#x27;s arch-rival. He is fat and has short tentacles and two bulging eyes. He has only spoken once in the strip. Otherwise, he makes noises that sound a lot like flatulence. His role is to fight Sherman and he is usually the victor (he was shown getting eaten in one strip, but this could have been another giant squid). In one strip, Sherman found that he could not beat the squid at his own game of (Twister), and challenged him to a Monopoly match. They have also been seen playing chess, but once again resorted to violence to solve their differences. He had not been seen in the strip for several years, leading many fans to speculate that his character had been retired. However, he showed up in a later strip at a fancy restaurant where he fought Sherman, leaving him in the end twisted into a pretzel.

====The Dolphin====
Another of Sherman&#x27;s enemies. Like the giant squid, the dolphin usually gets the best of Sherman, though he does so by outsmarting the shark rather than fighting him (a reference to the high intelligence of real dolphins). The dolphin regularly takes advantage of Sherman&#x27;s stupidity, such as asking to borrow his credit card or asking him for two ten-dollar bills as change for a five-dollar bill. Sherman once attempted to have him and the dolphin sign a peace treaty, only to have the dolphin trick Sherman into signing a contract leaving all of his possessions to him in the event of his demise, followed by a contract donating all of Sherman&#x27;s organs for immediate research.

====Gary====
Gary is a large blue fish who is the most prominent member of Northside Lagoon, the rival to Kapupu Lagoon. He frequently appears when causing mischief in Kapupu Lagoon or when both Lagoons are competing in the Annual Lagoon Challenge, with Northside Lagoon always winning due to in part the incompetence of the Kapupu Lagoon challengers. In June 2021, Kapupu Lagoon finally did win the annual challenge, partly due to unsportsmanlike conduct on their part.

<doc id="1342896" wikidata="Q519534" url="?curid=1342896" title="Paul Cadmus">
<text>Paul Cadmus (December 17, 1904 – December 12, 1999) was an American artist widely known for his egg tempera paintings of gritty social interactions in urban settings. He also produced many highly finished drawings of single nude male figures. His paintings combine elements of eroticism and social critique in a style often called magic realism.

==Early life and education==
Cadmus was born on December 17, 1904, in a tenement on 103rd Street near Amsterdam Avenue, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, the son of artists, Maria Latasa, of Basque and Cuban ancestry, and Egbert Cadmus (1868–1939), of Dutch ancestry. His father, who studied with Robert Henri, worked as a commercial artist, and his mother illustrated children&#x27;s books. His sister, Fidelma Cadmus, married Lincoln Kirstein, a philanthropist, arts patron, and co-founder of the New York City Ballet, in 1941.

At age 15, Cadmus left school to attend the National Academy of Design for 6 years. In 1925, at age 20, Cadmus became a member of The Brooklyn Society of Etchers (now known as the Society of American Graphic Artists or SAGA). In their 10th Annual Exhibition held at the Brooklyn Museum he showed three etchings, &quot;Fidelma&quot;, &quot;Calogero Scibetta&quot; and &quot;Kramer&quot;. He enrolled at the Art Students League of New York in 1928 taking life-drawing lessons while working as a commercial illustrator at a New York advertising agency. He furthered his education while traveling through Europe from 1931 to 1933 with fellow artist Jared French, who became his lover for a time.

==Career==
After traveling through France and Spain, Cadmus and French settled in a fishing village on the island Majorca. In 1933, they headed back to the United States after running out of money, where Cadmus was one of the first artists to be employed by The New Deal art programs, painting murals at post offices. He maintained a studio at 54 Morton Street.

Cadmus worked in commercial illustration as well, but French, also a tempera artist, convinced him to devote himself completely to fine art. In 1979, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an associate member and became a full member in 1980.

Cadmus is ranked by Artists Trade Union of Russia amongst the world&#x27;s best artists of the last four centuries.

===Controversies===

In 1934, at the age of 29, he painted &quot;The Fleet&#x27;s In!&quot; while working for the Public Works of Art Project. This painting, which featured carousing sailors and women, included a stereotypical homosexual solicitation and erotic exaggeration of clinging pants seats and bulging crotches. It was the subject of a public outcry led by Admiral Hugh Rodman, who protested to Secretary of the Navy Claude A. Swanson, saying, &quot;It represents a most disgraceful, sordid, disreputable, drunken brawl.&quot; Secretary Swanson stated that the painting was &quot;right artistic&quot; but &quot;not true to the Navy.&quot; The painting was removed from exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery by Henry L. Roosevelt, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy at the time, and kept in his home until Roosevelt&#x27;s death in 1936. The publicity helped to launch Cadmus&#x27;s career, and he stated at the time, &quot;I had no intention of offending the Navy. Sailors are no worse than anybody else. In my picture I merely commented on them – I didn&#x27;t criticize.&quot; The painting, which after Roosevelt&#x27;s death hung over a mantel at the Alibi Club in Washington for more than half a century, was kept from public view until 1981, temporarily displayed at the Wolfsonian Museum in Miami, and eventually found a home at the Naval Historical Center.

In 1938, his painting &quot;Pocahantas Saving the Life of John Smith&quot;, a mural painted for the Parcel Post Building in Richmond, Virginia, had to be retouched when some observers noticed a fox pelt suggestively hanging between the legs of an Indian depicted in the painting. Cadmus used his then lover, Jared French, as the model for John Smith in the mural.

In 1940, two paintings, &quot;Sailors and Floozies&quot; (1938) and &quot;Seeing the New Year In&quot;, were removed from public view because the Navy &quot;didn&#x27;t like it&quot; and there was &quot;too much smell about it.&quot; The paintings were being exhibited at the Golden Gate International Exposition and were removed, while a third, &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot;, remained. The office of Commissioner George Creel was told by the Navy that the painting, &quot;Sailors and Floozies&quot;, was &quot;unnecessarily dirty.&quot;

===Artistic style===
Cadmus, considered to be a master draftsman, was interested in the Italian Renaissance artists, particularly Signorelli and Mantegna, the so-called &quot;masters of muscle.&quot; He was also influenced by Reginald Marsh, an American scene painter. Cadmus combined the elements of Signorelli and Mantegna along with Marsh to depict the street life of New York City.

He was transfixed by the human body, both the ideal and the repulsive. His ideal was a stylized erotic version of the male body. He found the grotesque everywhere from Greenwich Village cafes, subway stations, the beach at Coney Island to American tourists in an Italian piazza. His art is a form of satire and caricature of his subjects that has been compared to fellow artists George Grosz and Otto Dix. Art critics have been divided on Cadmus&#x27; art, with Dore Ashton stating that &quot;he&#x27;s not a historical figure at all, he&#x27;s an also-ran.&quot; Ashton described his paintings as &quot;skewed &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;.&quot; In 1990, Michael Kimmelman wrote that Cadmus&#x27; art served &quot;as a reminder that, contrary to the standard view, realism was still a vital tradition in American art during the middle of this century, one that drew from many of the same sources that inspired the Abstract Expressionists who were widely thought to have rendered realism obsolete.&quot;

==Personal life==
From 1937 until the early 1950s, Cadmus, his lover, Jared French, and French&#x27;s wife, Margaret French, formed a photographic collective called PaJaMa (&quot;Paul, Jared, and Margaret&quot;). During vacations in Saltaire, New York, Fire Island and later Provincetown, Massachusetts and Nantucket, the trio photographed each other on the beach and indoors, donning makeshift costumes and using found objects as props to create scenes of Magic Realism. They passed around Margaret&#x27;s Leica camera, becoming subjects and makers in turn.

Many of their friends were featured in the photographs — they were among New York&#x27;s young artists, dancers, and writers, and most were handsome and gay. Among those photographed were Tennessee Williams, Glenway Wescott, Monroe Wheeler, Donald Windham, Todd Bolender, Bernard Perlin, Chuck Howard, Ted Starkowski, Christopher Isherwood, and Paul Cadmus&#x27;s sister Fidelma and her husband Lincoln Kirstein.
Cadmus and French also posed for photographs with the noted photographer George Platt Lynes (1907–1955). These photographs were not published or exhibited while Lynes was living and show the intimacy and relationship of the two.

From 1944-1949, Cadmus was involved with artist George Tooker, forming a complicated relationship with French and his wife. When the Frenches bought a home in Hartland, Vermont, they gave Cadmus a house of his own on the property, which French later took back and gave to his Italian lover.

In 1965, Cadmus met and began a relationship with Jon (Farquhar) Anderson (July 30, 1937, New Haven, Connecticut - October 21, 2018, Weston, Connecticut). The relationship with Anderson, a former Nantucket cabaret singer 32 years younger than Cadmus, lasted until Cadmus&#x27; death in 1999. During their 35-year relationship, Anderson was Cadmus&#x27; model and muse in many of his works. Cadmus was also close friends with many illustrious artists, authors, and dancers including Christopher Isherwood, W. H. Auden, George Balanchine, George Platt Lynes, Lincoln Kirstein (his brother-in-law), and E. M. Forster, who was said to have read his novel &quot;Maurice&quot; aloud while Cadmus painted his portrait, which was printed in 1200 copies of a pamphlet &quot;The New Disorder&quot; in 1949.

In 1999, he died at his home in Weston, Connecticut, due to advanced age, five days before his 95th birthday.
