<text>Necmettin Erbakan (29 October 1926 – 27 February 2011) was a Turkish politician, engineer, and academic who was the Prime Minister of Turkey from 1996 to 1997. He was pressured by the military to step down as prime minister and was later banned from politics by the Constitutional Court of Turkey for allegedly violating the separation of religion and state as mandated by the constitution.

The political ideology and movement founded by Erbakan, Millî Görüş, argues that Turkey can develop with its own power by protecting its religious values and moving forward with faster steps by rivaling the Western countries in favor of closer relations to Muslim countries. With the Millî Görüş ideology, Erbakan was the founder and leader of several prominent Islamic political parties in Turkey from the 1970s to the 2010s, namely the National Order Party (MNP), the National Salvation Party (MSP), the Welfare Party (RP), the Virtue Party (FP), and the Felicity Party (SP).

== Early life and education ==
Erbakan was born in Sinop, at the coast of Black Sea in northern Turkey. His father was Mehmet Sabri, a judge from the prominent Kozanoğlu family of Cilicia and his mother Kamer was a Circassian from a known family in Sinop and the second wife of Mehmet Sabri.

After high school education in Istanbul High School, he graduated from the Mechanical Engineering Faculty at the Istanbul Technical University in 1948, and received a PhD degree in mechanical/engine engineering from the RWTH Aachen University. After returning to Turkey, Erbakan became lecturer at the İTÜ and was appointed professor in 1965 at the same university. After working some time in leading positions in the industry, he switched over to politics, and was elected deputy of Konya in 1969. He was a member of the Community of İskenderpaşa, a Turkish sufistic community of the Naqshbandi tariqah.

== Political activities ==
One of the leading names in Turkish politics for decades, Erbakan was the leader of a series of Islamic political parties that he founded or inspired. These parties rose to prominence only to be banned by Turkey&#x27;s secular authorities. In the 1970s, Erbakan was chairman of the National Salvation Party which, at its peak, served in coalition government with the Republican People&#x27;s Party of Prime Minister Bülent Ecevit during the Cyprus crisis of 1974.

In the wake of the 1980 military coup, Erbakan and his party were banned from politics. He reemerged following a referendum to lift the ban in 1987 and became the leader of the Welfare Party. His party benefited in the 1990s from the acrimony between the leaders of Turkey&#x27;s two most prominent conservative parties, Mesut Yılmaz and Tansu Çiller, leading his party to a surprise success in the general elections of 1995.

Since the tensions between the military and the Islamists led to a civil war in Algeria, Erbakan said &quot;Turkey will not turn into Algeria&quot; in 1992 and 1997. But on 10 May 1997 Welfare Party Şanlıurfa MP İbrahim Halil Çelik threatened that &quot;If you try to close the İmam Hatip schools, blood will be spilled. It would be worse than Algeria.&quot; Erbakan and his associates developed ties with the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in Algeria and when Erbakan visited the American Muslim Council in October 1994, he engaged with FIS representatives.

=== Premiership ===
After the short premiership of Mesut Yılmaz after the 1995 elections collapsed in 1996 due to a censure motion by the Welfare Party, Erbakan became the prime minister in coalition with Çiller&#x27;s True Path Party (DYP). As prime minister, he attempted to further Turkey&#x27;s relations with the Arab nations. In addition to trying to follow an economic welfare program, which was supposedly intended to increase welfare among Turkish citizens, the government tried to implement a multi-dimensional political approach to relations with the neighboring countries. The coalition government received criticism for Erbakan&#x27;s foreign policy. When Erbakan went on an African tour, visiting Egypt, Nigeria, and Libya, his passiveness toward the Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi, angered even his own constituents back home. Erbakan appeared passive in the face of Gaddafi&#x27;s reprimands that Turkey&#x27;s Israel-friendly foreign policy was proof that the imperialists powers had placed it &quot;under occupation&quot; and that Turks had lost their &quot;national will&quot;. Gaddafi also lambasted Turkey for its Kurdish policy during this joint press conference with Erbakan, greatly embarrassing the Turkish prime minister. This public browbeating did not play well at home. Despite these reactions, Erbakan maintained his pro-Islamist foreign-policy focus, hewing to his National Outlook origins. He suggested an Islamic security organization to rival NATO, as well as an Islamic currency called the dinar. Deeply alarmed, the military established an initiative called the &quot;Western Working Group&quot;, tasked with monitoring the party&#x27;s activities.

Erbakan&#x27;s image was damaged by his famous speech making fun of the nightly demonstrations against the Susurluk scandal. He was widely blamed at the time for his indifference. The Turkish military gradually increased the urgency and frequency of its public warnings to Erbakan&#x27;s government, eventually prompting Erbakan to step down in 1997. At the time there was a formal rotation deal between Erbakan and Tansu Çiller, the leaders of the coalition — Erbakan was to act as the prime minister for a certain period (a fixed amount of time, which was not publicized), then he would step down in favour of Çiller. However, Çiller&#x27;s party was the third-largest in the parliament, and when Erbakan stepped down, President Süleyman Demirel asked Mesut Yılmaz, leader of the second-largest party, to form a new government instead.

=== Post-premiership ===
In an unprecedented move, Erbakan&#x27;s ruling Welfare Party was subsequently banned by the courts, which held that the party had an agenda to promote Islamic fundamentalism in the state, and Erbakan was barred once again from active politics. He had argued that a truly democratic country should not shut down a political party for its beliefs. He was tried and sentenced to two years and four months imprisonment in the so-called Lost Trillion Case, which involved the use of forged documents to prevent the return of Treasury grants in the amount of around one trillion old Turkish lira, $3.3MM in today&#x27;s currency, following the ban of the party in 1997.

Despite often being under political ban, Erbakan nonetheless acted as a mentor and informal advisor to former Welfare Party members who founded the Virtue Party in 1997, among them being the future Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. The Virtue Party was found unconstitutional in 2001 and forcibly banned; by that time, Erbakan&#x27;s ban on political activities had ended, and he founded the Felicity Party, of which he was the leader in 2003–2004 and again from 2010 until his death.

==Death==

Erbakan died on 27 February 2011 at 11:40 local time of heart failure at Güven Hospital in Çankaya, Ankara. His body was transferred to Istanbul, and following the religious funeral service at the Fatih Mosque, the attending crowd accompanied his coffin the about way to the Merkezefendi Cemetery, where he was laid to rest beside his wife Nermin. He did not wish a state funeral, however his funeral was attended by highest state and government officials.

==Views==

Erbakan&#x27;s ideology is set forth in a manifesto, entitled &quot;Millî Görüş&quot; (National View), which he published in 1969. The organisation of the same name, which he founded and of which he was the leader, upholds nowadays that the word &quot;national&quot; is to be understood in the sense of monotheistic ecumenism. According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, at his death Erbakan was acknowledged as a moderating force on Turkey&#x27;s Islamists, and made Turkey as a possible model for the Arab world as well.

His foreign policy had two main pillars: Pan-Islamism, and struggle against Zionism. He created &quot;D-8&quot; or The Developing Eight, to achieve an economic and political unity among Muslim countries. It has eight members, including Turkey, Iran, Malaysia, Indonesia, Egypt, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nigeria.

Although a rigorous Islamist and avid opposer of secularism, Erbakan developed a friendship with Jean-Marie Le Pen, due to their shared belief that European and Islamic civilization were incompatible and their similar right-wing ideologies.

<doc id="1328700" wikidata="Q1968288" url="?curid=1328700" title="Tzigane">
<text>Tzigane is a rhapsodic composition by the French composer Maurice Ravel. The original instrumentation was for violin and piano (with optional luthéal attachment). The first performance took place in London on 26 April 1924 with the dedicatee, Hungarian violinist Jelly d&#x27;Arányi, on the violin and Henri Gil-Marchex at the piano (with luthéal). In his biographical sketch of 1928 Ravel spoke of it as &quot;a virtuoso piece in the style of a Hungarian rhapsody&quot;. It consists of &quot;a string of successive variations juxtaposed without development&quot;.

==Background==
In the early 1920s, Ravel had been planning a piece for violin and piano for his closest female friend, Hélène Jourdan-Morhange. Around the same time Ravel got to know d&#x27;Arányi when she played his Sonata for Violin and Cello with Hans Kindler in London, and afterwards regaled the composer with a selection of folk-tunes from her country. In the ensuing two years Ravel put aside the sonata he had intended for Jourdan-Morhange, who by then had retired from playing due to a chronic illness, and wrote the Tzigane.

The luthéal was a new piano attachment (first patented in 1919) with several tone-colour registrations which could be engaged by pulling stops above the keyboard. One of these registrations had a cimbalom-like sound, which fitted well with the gypsy tone of the composition. The original score of &quot;Tzigane&quot; included instructions for these register-changes during execution. The luthéal, however, did not achieve permanence. By the end of the 20th century the first print of the accompaniment with luthéal was still available at the publishers, but by that time the attachment had long since disappeared from use.

Ravel soon orchestrated the piano part, and the version for violin and orchestra was first performed in Amsterdam on 19 October 1924, with Pierre Monteux conducting the Concertgebouw and Samuel Dushkin as soloist. On 30 November 1924 the Paris premiere featured Jelly d&#x27;Arányi with the Concerts Colonne under the direction of Gabriel Pierné. The first performance of the version with piano without luthéal was by Robert Soetens in 1925.

The name of the piece is derived from the generic European term for &quot;gypsy&quot; (in French: gitan, tsigane or tzigane rather than the Hungarian &quot;cigány&quot;) although it does not use any authentic Gypsy melodies. 

==Music==
The composition is in one movement, with an approximate duration of ten minutes, scored for strings and harp, double woodwind, two horns in F, one trumpet in C, celeste, triangle, timbre, and cymbal. The opening is marked &#x27;Lento, quasi cadenza&#x27; and is for solo violin, playing on the G string for the first 28 bars; Jankélévitch describes the preamble (Lassan) as &quot;superior exercises – runs, staccato notes, trills and mordents&quot;. Then follow a succession of &quot;gipsy improvisations – the Friska, then the Czardas&quot;, at the end of which &quot;the rhapsody becomes impatient and runs feverishly through all kinds of successive tonalities without retaining any of them&quot;.

<doc id="1328711" wikidata="Q2925750" url="?curid=1328711" title="British Racing Drivers' Club">
<text>The British Racing Drivers&#x27; Club (BRDC) is an exclusive invitation-only members club for racecar drivers who are judged to have achieved success in the upper levels of motor sport for a number of seasons. Except under exceptional circumstances, members must have been born in the United Kingdom or Commonwealth. The BRDC owns and operates Silverstone Circuit in the United Kingdom.

==Early days==

The club was founded in April 1928 by Dr. J. Dudley Benjafield, one of an informal group of British racing drivers known as the &quot;Bentley Boys&quot;. The BRDC began primarily as a socialising club for Benjafield and his fellow drivers, but by the time of its inauguration, its 25 members had devised a set of objectives for the club:

*To promote the interests of motor sport generally.
*To celebrate any specific achievement in motor sport.
*To extend hospitality to racing drivers from overseas.
*To further the interests of British drivers competing abroad.

In 1929, the BRDC became involved in the promotion and organisation of racing events. Its first event was the BRDC 500-Mile Race at Brooklands on 12 October of that year, a race won by a Bentley 4½ Litre, unsupercharged, owned and driven by Bentley-dealer Jack Barclay and Le Mans-winner F.C. Clement. The event was such a success that the 1930 event, scheduled for 4 October, was accorded International status. The Earl of March and S.C.H. Davis won the event outright in an Austin Seven.

From June 1935 the BRDC published the monthly magazine &quot;Speed&quot;. The final issue was April 1939, after which it was incorporated into its rival &quot;Motor Sport&quot;.

==World War II and aftermath==
Members who died or were killed during the Second World War included: Cecil Kimber (a vice-president), The Earl of Cottenham, A.V. Ebblewhite, Hugh P. McConnell, T.E. Rose Richards, J.P. Wakefield, E.K. Rayson, G.L. Baker, John Carr, Percy Maclure, A.F.P. Fane, B.P.W. Twist, R.O. Shuttleworth, C.S. Staniland, N.G. Wilson, H.E. Symons, R.P. Hichens, J.A. Driskell, and Lionel Martin.

After the war the club opened a &quot;Le Mans Fund,&quot; for the benefit of the Automobile Club de l&#x27;Ouest, raising a grand total of £358 and 11 shillings, to assist with the rehabilitation of the facilities at the Le Mans circuit. &quot;It will be remembered that these installations were almost completely destroyed during the war, mainly by Allied bombing.&quot;

==Membership status==
In the modern era full membership status is offered only to those who are judged to have been successful at an international level for a number of seasons. Full membership has been awarded to every British or Commonwealth Formula One World Champion. Associate status is awarded to those who have made a significant contribution to motor sport. Honorary membership may be awarded in special cases, such as a notable World Champion who may not otherwise qualify. Membership is only open to British or Commonwealth drivers however Irish drivers who were born in the Irish Free State or the Republic of Ireland before 1950 would be considered British by the club and eligible for membership. This rule allowed for Eddie Jordan to join the club. Once invited to join, prospective members must be proposed and seconded by existing members, then in turn, approved by the existing membership, board of directors and BRDC President.

The BRDC&#x27;s membership was initially restricted to experienced and successful male drivers, and was by invitation only. When Le Mans-winner John Duff joined the club in 1935 he was proposed and seconded by existing members. However James Robertson Justice was a member of the club, with a limited track record.

In 1946 eligibility was described thus: &quot;It is pointed out that, normally, membership is confined to gentlemen who have competed in an open motor road-racing event or taken a first, second or third place award in a Brooklands Automobile Racing Club&#x27;s Meeting. Every candidate must be proposed by one and seconded by another member of the club, to both of whom he is personally known.&quot;

Women have been elected Honorary Member of the Club since 1928 (when Jill Scott was inducted), however it was not until 1994 that they were able to become Full Members. As a consequence, the British Women Racing Drivers Club was founded in 1962 by Mary Wheeler.

==Race promotion and circuit ownership==
In the post-war era, the BRDC expanded its activities, taking over the lease of Silverstone from the RAC in 1952. In 1966, the club formed a subsidiary company, &quot;Silverstone Circuits Limited&quot;, responsible for the development of the British Grand Prix and – after its purchase in 1971 – the circuit itself. Aside from the GP, other notable BRDC-organised events at Silverstone included the BRDC International Trophy.

In recent years, Silverstone and the British GP have become an ongoing contentious issue between the BRDC board and Bernie Ecclestone&#x27;s Formula One Management, with differences of opinion over the costs involved and the state of the circuit&#x27;s infrastructure.

Also within the remit of the club are:
*The BRDC Marshals&#x27; Club.
*BRDC Club Races.
*BRDC 500 Summer Races.
*The BRDC Walter Hayes Trophy.

==Young driver support==
The support and development of young British drivers has become an important part of the BRDC&#x27;s existence, not least with its involvement in the annual Aston Martin Autosport BRDC Award to honour and promote a young driver from a British championship who, in the eyes of the judges, shows the most talent and potential. Among the BRDC&#x27;s promotional and developmental schemes is the &quot;Stars of Tomorrow&quot; karting championship. The BRDC also provides financial backing to selected young British drivers competing in junior formulae.

In 2008, the BRDC announced the creation of its SuperStars program, designed to advise and financially support Britain&#x27;s most promising young drivers. 1992 BTCC champion Tim Harvey was appointed Director of the program. The current director is Andy Meyrick.

===2022 BRDC Superstars===
==Significant people==
In the recent past the Club Presidency has been held by former Formula One World Champions Sir Jackie Stewart and Damon Hill. , Former F1 Driver David Coulthard is the President of the BRDC, having replaced Paddy Hopkirk.

The club&#x27;s current Chairman is Peter Digby, since 2022. The position has recently been held by former touring car driver Stuart Rolt, (from 2005 – 2008 and from 2010 – 2012) and Robert Brooks, Chairman of Bonhams auctioneers, from 2008 – 2010.

<doc id="1328719" wikidata="Q2838877" url="?curid=1328719" title="Bhabar">
<text>Bhabar or Bhabhar is a region south of the Lower Himalayas and the Sivalik Hills in Garhwal and Kumaon, India. The Bhabhar region contains some of the largest cities of Kumaon and Garhwal: Dehradun, Haridwar, Haldwani, Rishikesh, Ramnagar, Tanakpur and Kotdwar. It is the alluvial apron of sediments washed down from the Sivaliks along the northern edge of the Indo-Gangetic Plain.

The Indo-Gangetic Plains are generally thought of as a flat region with no variations, although this isn&#x27;t true. The plains can be classified into four regions on the basis of relief features. The Bhabar is a belt of 8–16 km lying parallel to the slopes of the Sivaliks, where the river descending from the mountains deposit pebbles. The streams flow through the pebbles the region, hence disappearing from sight. They re-emerge only after some distance south, in the relief feature Terai. 

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Bhabar&quot; refers to a local tall-growing grass, &quot;Eulaliopsis binata&quot;, used for the manufacture of paper and rope.

==Overview==
Bhabar plains are located in Kumaon and Garhwal. Bhabar is the gently-sloping coarse alluvial zone below the Sivalik Hills (outermost foothills of the Himalayas) where streams disappear into permeable sediments. The underground water level is deep in this region, then rises to the surface in the Terai below where coarse alluvium gives way to less permeable silt and clay. The Ganges River lies to the west and Sharda to the east.

Being at the junction of Himalayas and the Indo-Gangetic Plain, Bhabar contains almost all the important trade and commerce hubs of Kumaon, including its largest city Haldwani. Due to the top-soil replenishment every monsoon, It is also a fertile area with large yields per unit area.

==History==
In 1901 Bhabar was also one of four division of Nainital district. It included 4 towns and 511 villages with a combined population of 93,445 (1901), spread over . It corresponded to the current subdivision of Haldwani. Bhabar lands were used by Gujjar cattle herders of Kumaon and Garhwal. They spend their winters in bhabars.

<text>Etgar Keret (, born August 20, 1967) is an Israeli writer known for his short stories, graphic novels, and scriptwriting for film and television.

==Early life==

Keret was born in Ramat Gan, Israel in 1967. He is a third child to parents who survived the Holocaust. Both of his parents are from Poland. He studied at Ohel Shem high school, and at the Adi Lautman Interdisciplinary Programme for Outstanding Students of Tel Aviv University.

==Literary career==
Keret&#x27;s first published work was &quot;Pipelines&quot; (, &quot;Tzinorot&quot;, 1992), a collection of short stories which was largely ignored when it came out. His second book, &quot;Missing Kissinger&quot; (, &quot;Ga&#x27;agu&#x27;ai le-Kissinger&quot;, 1994), a collection of fifty very short stories, caught the attention of the general public. The short story &quot;Siren&quot;, which deals with the paradoxes of modern Israeli society, is included in the curriculum for the Israeli matriculation exam in literature.

Keret has co-authored several comic books, among them &quot;Nobody Said It Was Going to Be Fun&quot; (, &quot;Lo banu leihanot&quot;, 1996) with Rutu Modan and &quot;Streets of Fury&quot; (סמטאות הזעם, &quot;Simtaot Haza&#x27;am&quot;, 1997) with Asaf Hanuka. In 1999, five of his stories were translated into English, and adapted into &quot;graphic novellas&quot; under the joint title &quot;Jetlag&quot;. The illustrators were the five members of the Actus Tragicus collective.

In 1998, Keret published &quot;Kneller&#x27;s Happy Campers&quot; (, &quot;Hakaytana Shel Kneller&quot;), a collection of short stories. The title story, the longest in the collection, follows a young man who commits suicide and goes on a quest for love in the afterlife. It appears in the English language collection of Keret&#x27;s stories &quot;The Bus Driver Who Wanted To Be God &amp; Other Stories&quot; (2004) and was adapted into the graphic novel &quot;Pizzeria Kamikaze&quot; (2006), with illustrations by Asaf Hanuka. Keret&#x27;s latest short story collections are &quot;Anihu&quot; (, literally &quot;I-am-him&quot;, 2002; translated into English as &quot;Cheap Moon&quot;, after one of the other stories in the collection) and &quot;Pitom Defikah Ba-delet&quot; (, translated into English as &quot;Suddenly a Knock at the Door&quot;).

Keret also wrote a children&#x27;s book &quot;Dad Runs Away with the Circus&quot; (2004), illustrated by Rutu Modan.

Keret publishes some of his works on the Hebrew-language web site &quot;Bimah Hadashah&quot; (New Stage).

His 2019 book published in English as &quot;Fly Already&quot; (, literally &quot;Glitch at the Edge of the Galaxy&quot;) won Israel’s prestigious Sapir Prize in Literature. The prize includes a paid translation of the winning book into any language of the author’s choosing, and Keret gained some attention for selecting Yiddish. This was the first time an author had chosen that language in the prize’s 20-year history.

==Other media==
Keret has worked in Israeli television and film, including three seasons as a writer for the popular sketch show &quot;The Cameri Quintet.&quot; He also wrote the story for the 2001 TV movie &quot;Aball&#x27;e&quot; starring Shmil Ben Ari.

In 2006, &quot;&quot;, a dark comedy/love story based on Keret&#x27;s novella &quot;Kneller&#x27;s Happy Campers&quot;, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. The story was adapted by director Goran Dukić into a film starring Patrick Fugit, Shannyn Sossamon, Tom Waits and Will Arnett.

Etgar and his wife Shira directed the 2007 film &quot;Jellyfish&quot;, based on a story written by Shira.

&quot;$9.99&quot;, a stop motion animated feature film, was released in 2009. Written by Keret and directed by Tatia Rosenthal, it is an Israeli/Australian co-production featuring the voices of Geoffrey Rush, Anthony LaPaglia and other leading Australian actors.

In 2010 a short feature film based on Keret&#x27;s story was released. &quot;An Exclusive&quot; novella was adapted and directed by the young Polish director Krzysztof Szot. The film, also known as &quot;Wyłączność&quot; (An Exclusive), was presented at the Cannes Film Festival 2010 in the Short Film Corner section.

Keret&#x27;s work is frequently featured on the National Public Radio program &quot;This American Life&quot;, which has presented readings of eight of his stories.

In October 2011 the public radio show &quot;Selected Shorts&quot; devoted an entire show to live readings of Keret&#x27;s stories, including “Suddenly a Knock at the Door,” “Halibut,&quot; “Lieland”, and “Fatso.” Keret himself introduced several of the stories.

In August 2012, the short film &quot;Glue&quot; based on Etgar Keret&#x27;s short story &quot;Crazy Glue&quot;, participated in the Rhode Island International Film Festival.

In May 2013, the short film &quot;LieLand&quot;, adapted and directed by Silvia Grossmann, a Brazilian/American filmmaker, premiered at the Cannes Film Festival.

In 2017, Keret&#x27;s short story &quot;Parallel Universes&quot; was adapted into a short film by British-Israeli actor Liran Nathan. The film was screened at various international film festivals including the Newport Beach Film Festival and the British Urban Film Festival.

==Writing style==

Keret&#x27;s writing style is lean, using everyday language, slang, and dialect. His work has influenced many writers of his generation, as well as bringing a renewed surge in popularity for the short story form in Israel in the second half of the 1990s.

According to linguist Ghil&#x27;ad Zuckermann, Etgar Keret was criticized by linguist Menahem Zevi Kaddari &quot;for using a &#x27;thin language&#x27; – as opposed to Shmuel Yosef Agnon&quot;. Zuckermann defends Keret and argues that &quot;Kaddari compares Keret to Agnon as if they wrote in two different registers of the same language&quot; whereas &quot;Keret is, in fact, writing in a different language. Whilst Agnon attempts to write in (Mishnaic) Hebrew, which is obviously not his mother tongue (Yiddish), Keret writes authentically in his native Israeli.&quot; Zuckermann provides an example: when Agnon wrote, in 1944, אשתו מתה עליו &quot;ishtó méta alàv&quot;, literally &quot;his wife died/dies on him&quot;, he meant &quot;he became a widower&quot;. When Keret says so, he means &quot;his wife loves him very much&quot;.

==Awards==
Keret has received the Prime Minister&#x27;s award for literature, as well as the Ministry of Culture&#x27;s Cinema Prize. In 2006 he was chosen as an outstanding artist of the prestigious Israel Cultural Excellence Foundation.

In 1993 he won the first prize in the Alternative Theater Festival in Akko for &quot;Entebbe: A Musical&quot;, which he wrote with Jonathan Bar Giora.

The short film &quot;Malka Lev Adom&quot; (&quot;Skin Deep&quot;, 1996), which Keret wrote and directed with Ran Tal, won an Israel Film Academy award and first place in the Munich International Festival of Film Schools. The film &quot;Jellyfish&quot;, a joint venture for Keret and his wife received the Camera d&#x27;Or prize at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. &quot;Missing Kissinger&quot; won the 2008 JQ Wingate Prize.

Keret was on the jury for the 2010 Neustadt International Prize for Literature.

In 2010, Keret received the Chevalier (Knight) Medallion of France&#x27;s Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.
He has received the Charles Bronfman Prize for 2016.

Keret received the 2018 Sapir Prize for Literature for his short-story collection &quot;Takalah be-Katzeh ha-Galaksiya&quot; (Hebrew title: תקלה בקצה הגלקסיה, &quot;A Glitch at the Edge of the Galaxy&quot;) whose English translation, &quot;Fly Already&quot;, won the 2019 National Jewish Book Award for Fiction. This book also appeared in a Bulgarian translation in 2020.

*&quot;The Metamorphosis&quot; by Franz Kafka
*&quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; by William Faulkner
*&quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot; by the Coen brothers
*&quot;Twelve Monkeys&quot; by Terry Gilliam

==Criticism==
A review of &quot;Missing Kissinger&quot; by Todd McEwen describes Etgar Keret&#x27;s locale as that of &quot;male confusion, loneliness, blundering, bellowing and, above all, stasis. His narrator is trapped in an angry masculine wistfulness which is awful to behold in its masturbatory disconnection from the world&#x27;s real possibilities and pleasures.&quot; Keret is &quot;not much of a stylist - you get the impression that he throws three or four of these stories off on the bus to work every morning,&quot; and his &quot;wild, blackly inventive pieces...might have been dreamed up by a mad scientist rather than a writer.&quot;

==Personal life==
He lives in Tel Aviv with his wife, Shira Geffen, and their son, Lev, born in 2006. Etgar Keret is a lecturer at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Beer Sheva, and at Tel Aviv University. He holds dual Israeli and Polish citizenship.

<text>Jean Charles Athanase Peltier ( ; ; 22 February 1785 – 27 October 1845) was a French physicist. He was originally a watch dealer, but at the age of 30 began experiments and observations in physics.

Peltier was the author of numerous papers in different departments of physics. His name is specially associated with the thermal effects at junctions in a voltaic circuit, the Peltier effect. Peltier introduced the concept of electrostatic induction (1840), based on the modification of the distribution of electric charge in a material under the influence of a second object closest to it and its own electrical charge.

==Biography==
Peltier trained as a watchmaker; until his 30s he was a watch dealer. He worked with Abraham Louis Breguet in Paris. Later, he conducted various experiments on electrodynamics and noticed that in an electronic element when current flows through, a temperature gradient or temperature difference is generated at a current flow. In 1836 he published his work and in 1838 his findings were confirmed by Emil Lenz. Peltier dealt with topics from the atmospheric electricity and meteorology. In 1840, he published a work on the causes of hurricanes.

Peltier&#x27;s numerous papers are devoted in great part to atmospheric electricity, waterspouts, cyanometry and polarization of sky-light, the temperature of water in the spheroidal state, and the boiling-point at high elevations. There are also a few devoted to curious points of natural history. His name will always be associated with the thermal effects at junctions in a voltaic circuit, a discovery of importance comparable with those of Seebeck and Cumming.

Peltier discovered the calorific effect of electric current passing through the junction of two different metals. This is now called the Peltier effect (or Peltier–Seebeck effect). By switching the direction of current, either heating or cooling may be achieved. Junctions always come in pairs, as the two different metals are joined at two points. Thus heat will be moved from one junction to the other.

=== Peltier effect ===

The &quot;Peltier effect&quot; is the presence of heating or cooling at an electrified junction of two different conductors (1834). His great experimental discovery was the heating or cooling of the junctions in a heterogeneous circuit of metals according to the direction in which an electric current is made to pass round the circuit. This reversible effect is proportional directly to the strength of the current, not to its square, as is the irreversible generation of heat due to resistance in all parts of the circuit. It is found that, if a current pass from an external source through a circuit of two metals, it cools one junction and heats the other. It cools the junction if it be in the same direction as the thermoelectric current which would be caused by directly heating that junction. In other words, the passage of a current from an external source produces in the junctions of the circuit a distribution of temperature which leads to the weakening of the current by the superposition of a thermo-electric current running in the opposite direction.

When electromotive current is made to flow through an electronic junction between two conductors (A and B), heat is removed at the junction. To make a typical pump, multiple junctions are created between two plates. One side heats and the other side cools. A dissipation device is attached to the hot side to maintain cooling effect on the cold side. Typically, the use of the Peltier effect as a heat pump device involves multiple junctions in series, through which a current is driven. Some of the junctions lose heat due to the Peltier effect, while others gain heat. Thermoelectric pumps exploit this phenomenon, as do thermoelectric cooling Peltier modules found in refrigerators.

The &quot;Peltier effect&quot; generated at the junction per unit time, formula_1, is equal to

where, 
: formula_2 (formula_3) is the Peltier coefficient of conductor A (conductor B), and
: formula_4 is the electric current (from A to B).

&quot;Note:&quot; Total heat generated at the junction is &quot;not&quot; determined by the Peltier effect alone, being influenced by Joule heating and thermal gradient effects.

The Peltier coefficients represent how much heat is carried per unit charge. With charge current continuous across a junction, the associated heat flow will develop a discontinuity if formula_2 and formula_3 are different.

The Peltier effect can be considered as the back-action counterpart to the Seebeck effect (analogous to the back-emf in magnetic induction): if a simple thermoelectric circuit is closed then the Seebeck effect will drive a current, which in turn (via the Peltier effect) will always transfer heat from the hot to the cold junction.

The true importance of this &quot;Peltier effect&quot; in the explanation of thermoelectric currents was first clearly pointed out by James Prescott Joule; and Sir William Thomson further extended the subject by showing, both theoretically and experimentally, that there is something closely analogous to the Peltier effect when the heterogeneity is due, not to difference of quality of matter, but to difference of temperature in contiguous portions of the same material. Shortly after Peltier&#x27;s discovery was published, Lenz used the effect to freeze small quantities of water by the cold developed in a bismuth-antimony junction when a voltaic current was passed through the metals in the order named.

<text>Hugo Borchardt (June 6, 1844 – May 8, 1924) was a German firearms inventor and engineer, born in Magdeburg, Kingdom of Prussia. He is known for his inventions of the Borchardt C-93 pistol and the Sharps-Borchardt Model 1878 rifle.

In 1860 he emigrated to the United States, and by 1872 he was Superintendent of Works for Pioneer Breech-Loading Arms Co. of Trenton, Mass. In 1874 he became a foreman for Singer Sewing Machine Co., then was employed by Colt&#x27;s Patent Firearms Manufacturing Co., later went to Winchester Repeating Arms Co., and then was Superintendent and Treasurer for the Sharps Rifle Co. on June 1, 1876.

After the dissolution of the Sharps Rifle Co. in 1881, Borchardt returned to Budapest, where he was employed by Fegyver és Gépgyár Részvénytársaság and by 1890 gained the position of works director. While here, he married Aranka Herczog. His return in Europe was interrupted by a short stay (1890–92) in the United States as a consultant to Remington Arms in relation to the development of the Lee rifle for the U.S. Army trials.

By 1893 Borchardt had an association with Ludwig Löwe &amp; Company of Berlin, Germany, a manufacturer of machine tools, to produce the C-93, a semi-automatic pistol that he had invented based upon the Maxim toggle-lock principle. He also developed the 7.65x25mm Borchardt cartridge around which the C-93 was built. Hugo Borchardt had many non-firearms patents: a rock drill, a shirt-neck shaper, gas burners, ball-bearings, a wire-straightener, and various electrical apparatus.

Borchardt died of pneumonia in Berlin-Charlottenburg in 1924.

<text>Kuopio Lyceum High School is an upper secondary school (&quot;lukio&quot;) for students aged 15–19. Kuopion Lyseon lukio is located in Kuopio, Finland. Originally established as a boys&#x27; school in 1872, Kuopion Lyseo opened its doors to both sexes in 1977. The origins of Kuopion Lyseo can be traced further back to Viipurin Triviaalikoulu that was established in 1534 and relocated to Kuopio in 1777.

Kuopion Lyseon lukio is one of the most academically prestigious upper secondary schools in Finland. It is the fifth highest scoring school in the Finnish Matriculation Examination and its International Baccalaureate class has consistently had one of the highest average final examination scores in Europe. Around 450 students are currently enrolled in the school.

Kuopion Lyseon lukio has been an IB World School since 1994 and as such administers the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme.

The school building from 1826 is designed by Carl Ludvig Engel.

== History ==
* Viipurin triviaalikoulu (trivium school of Vyborg), established in 1534, was relocated to Kuopio in 1777. 
* In 1788, as the relocation seemed to become permanent, the school was replaced by Kuopion triviaalikoulu (trivium school of Kuopio).
* In 1843 the Finnish education system was restructured and the Kuopio&#x27;s trivium school became initially Kuopion Yläalkeiskoulu (equivalent to junior high school) and a year later in 1844 it was established as Kuopion Lukio (equivalent to senior high school). The first principal of Kuopion Yläalkeiskoulu was Johan Vilhelm Snellman, one of the most influential 19th-century Finnish statesmen and philosophers.
* Kuopion Lyseo was established in 1872 by merging these two schools, Kuopion Yläalkeiskoulu and Kuopion Lukio. Finnish was established as the teaching language.
* In 1975 Kuopion Lyseo was again divited to two different schools: Kauppatorin yläaste, later Vuorilammen yläaste, which is equivalent to junior high school (age group 13–15 years) and Kuopion Lyseon Lukio which is equivalent to senior high school (age group 16–19 years).
* In 1994 Kuopion Lyseon Lukio started also International Baccalaureate school in addition to the regular Finnish lukio senior high school. The teaching language in the IB school is English.

<doc id="1328767" wikidata="Q714304" url="?curid=1328767" title="Joseph D. Pistone">
<text>Joseph Dominick Pistone (born September 17, 1939) is an American former FBI agent who worked undercover as Donnie Brasco between September 1976 and July 1981, as part of an infiltration primarily into the Bonanno crime family under the tutelage of Anthony Mirra and later Dominick Napolitano, and to a lesser extent the Colombo crime family, two of the Five Families of the Mafia in New York City. Pistone was an FBI agent for 17 years, from 1969 until he resigned in 1986. The evidence collected by Pistone led to over 200 indictments and over 100 convictions of Mafia members, and some responsible for his infiltration were also killed by other mobsters.

Pistone was a pioneer in long-term undercover work. The FBI&#x27;s former director, J. Edgar Hoover, who died in 1972, did not want FBI agents to work undercover because of the danger of agents becoming corrupted. Nonetheless, Pistone&#x27;s work later helped convince the FBI that using undercover agents in lieu of relying exclusively on informants was a crucial tool in law enforcement. Pistone detailed his undercover experience in his 1988 book &quot;Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia&quot;, the basis of the 1997 film about his life.

==Early life and career==
Pistone was born in 1939 in Erie, Pennsylvania. He is of Italian heritage: his father was from Calabria while his mother from Sicily, and grew up in Paterson, New Jersey, where he attended Eastside High School. He attended Paterson State College (now William Paterson University), obtaining a degree in anthropology in 1965.

He worked for a year as a teacher at Paterson School No. 10 and at the Office of Naval Intelligence for three years before being sworn into the FBI on July 7, 1969, and assigned to Jacksonville, Florida. In 1974, he was transferred to New York to work in the truck and hijack unit. Because of his ability to drive 18-wheeler trucks and bulldozers, he was eventually given undercover work infiltrating a vehicle theft ring, an assignment that resulted in over 30 arrests and a greater profile for Pistone within law enforcement.

==FBI career as Donnie Brasco==
In the spring of 1976, Pistone volunteered to infiltrate the Bonanno crime family, a job for which his fluency in Italian, Sicilian heritage, and the knowledge of mafia idiosyncrasies gleaned from his Paterson background were well suited. For the undercover operation, the false identity of Donald &quot;Donnie&quot; Brasco was created, with a backstory that involved work as a low-level jewel thief. After extensive preparation including FBI gemology courses, he went undercover as a jewel thief.

The operation was given the code name &quot;Sun-Apple&quot; after the locations of its two simultaneous operations: Miami (&quot;Sunny Miami&quot;) and New York City (&quot;The Big Apple&quot;). After months of planning, in September 1976, Pistone started his undercover operation—an operation that was initially intended to last for around six months turned into several years. The FBI erased Pistone&#x27;s name on office rolls and his personnel file; anyone who called asking for him would be told that no one by that name was employed there. His co-workers, friends, and informants had no idea what had happened to him. The original focus of the operation was to infiltrate big-time fences and truck hijackings that would in turn lead to the Mafia. While Pistone was undercover, he informed on the activities of the Mafia during some of the most volatile power struggles in organized crime.

Pistone worked his way into becoming an associate in Jilly Greca&#x27;s crew from the Colombo family that was primarily involved in hijackings and robberies. After about six months, Pistone shifted to the Bonanno family by developing a relationship with Anthony Mirra. When Mirra was sent to prison, Pistone was tutored in the ways of the Mafia by Bonanno soldier Benjamin &quot;Lefty&quot; Ruggiero, whose captain was Mike &quot;Mimi&quot; Sabella. Pistone also had vending machine dealings with Frank Balistrieri of the Milwaukee crime family. After the 1979 murder of Carmine Galante, Pistone reported to captain Dominick &quot;Sonny Black&quot; Napolitano.

Pistone was responsible for a lucrative business venture in Holiday, Florida, when he opened and operated the King&#x27;s Court Bottle Club. In Florida, Pistone worked with another FBI agent working undercover as Tony Rossi. Napolitano later contracted Pistone, whom he hoped to make a made man, to murder Alphonse &quot;Sonny Red&quot; Indelicato&#x27;s son, Anthony &quot;Bruno&quot; Indelicato, who had previously evaded death after missing a May 1981 meeting which left Indelicato, Phillip Giaccone, and Dominick Trinchera dead.

The FBI then ordered the end of Pistone&#x27;s operation. He wanted to continue until he was set to become a made man that December; Napolitano would lie about his &quot;making his bones&quot; (participating in a Mafia-ordered hit) to prove his loyalty. However, Pistone&#x27;s superiors decided that the operation was becoming too dangerous and set an end date of July 26, 1981. Only after Pistone departed did FBI agents Doug Fencl, Jim Kinne, and Jerry Loar inform Napolitano that his longtime associate was an FBI agent. Pistone received a $500 bonus at the end of the operation.

===Aftermath===
Shortly thereafter, on August 17, 1981, Napolitano was murdered for having allowed an FBI agent to infiltrate the family; he was shot dead and his hands were cut off. Ruggiero was arrested by the FBI on August 29, 1981. Mirra was also later killed on February 18, 1982. About Napolitano&#x27;s fate, Pistone had stated, &quot;My intention in all of this was to put people in jail, not get them killed&quot;. In November 1982, Ruggiero, along with Nicholas Santora, Antonio Tomasulo, and Anthony &quot;Fat Tony&quot; Rabito, would be convicted in a six-week jury trial for racketeering conspiracy, receiving a 15-year prison sentence.

The Mafia put out a $500,000 contract on Pistone and kicked the Bonanno family off the Commission. FBI agents visited Mafia bosses in New York and advised them not to murder Pistone. The contract was dropped by Paul Castellano, who headed the Commission, as he thought killing a federal agent would &quot;attract too much attention&quot;. Pistone publicly testified for the first time on August 2, 1982. The evidence collected by Pistone led to over 200 indictments and over 100 convictions of Mafia members. Although Pistone resigned from the FBI in 1986, he continued to testify when called upon, including at the Pizza Connection Trial.

While Pistone&#x27;s infiltration decimated the Bonanno family, it also resulted in their expulsion from the Mafia Commission. Consequently, the Bonannos were not a target of the investigation leading to the Mafia Commission Trial that saw the top leadership of the &quot;Five Families&quot; sent to prison. By avoiding this, the family kept its leadership intact and was able to consolidate its power once again. The boss who led that resurgence, Joseph Massino, was convicted in 2004 of ordering Napolitano to be killed for allowing Pistone into the family.

Pistone lives in an undisclosed location with his wife Maggie and their three daughters, under assumed names. Pistone has been active as an author and consultant to worldwide law enforcement agencies, including Scotland Yard, and has been called to testify before the United States Senate as an expert on organized crime.

In September 2012, Pistone testified in Montreal, Quebec, at the Charbonneau Commission public inquiry into corruption, as an expert witness.

==Media==
Pistone detailed his undercover experience in his 1988 book &quot;Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia&quot;. The book was the basis for the 1997 film &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot;, for which Pistone worked as a technical adviser, starring Johnny Depp as Pistone and Al Pacino as &quot;Lefty&quot; Ruggiero. It was also the basis for the short-lived 2000 television series &quot;Falcone&quot;, starring Jason Gedrick as Pistone (whose mob alias was changed from &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot; to &quot;Joe Falcone&quot; for legal reasons). Pistone was a consultant on &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot; to add authenticity to the fictionalized portrayals and settings. His life was used in an episode of &quot;&quot;.

Pistone revisited his experiences as Donnie Brasco in his books &quot;The Way of the Wiseguy&quot; (2004) and &quot;Donnie Brasco: Unfinished Business&quot; (2007, co-authored with Charles Brandt). Pistone wrote a novel titled &quot;The Good Guys&quot; (2005) with Joseph Bonanno&#x27;s son, Salvatore &quot;Bill&quot; Bonanno. He has also written several works of fiction such as &quot;Deep Cover&quot;, &quot;Mobbed Up&quot; and &quot;Snake Eyes&quot;. He has served as an executive producer on movies relating to the Mafia, including the 2006 film &quot;10th &amp; Wolf&quot;. In 2008, Italian artist Rossella Biscotti interviewed Pistone in her video &quot;The Undercover Man&quot;. A play based on Donnie Brasco opened at the Pennsylvania Playhouse.

Pistone is featured in the eighth episode of UK history TV channel Yesterday&#x27;s documentary series &quot;Mafia&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;. A &quot;Secrets of the Dead&quot; episode, &quot;Gangland Graveyard&quot;, features Pistone and his infiltration of the Mafia as part of the long-running investigation into the murder of three Mafia captains by Massino.

Pistone featured prominently in the 2013 mini-series &quot;Inside the American Mob&quot;. He features prominently in episode 1 &quot;Stayin&#x27; Alive in the &#x27;70s&quot; and is the main focus of episode 2, &quot;Operation Donnie Brasco&quot;.

In May 2020, Pistone started a podcast called &quot;Deep Cover: The Real Donnie Brasco&quot;.

<text>Joshua Lawrence &quot;Josh&quot; Meador (March 12, 1911 - August 24, 1965) was an American animator, effects animator, special effects artist, and animation director for the Walt Disney studios.

== Biography ==
Meador was born in Greenwood, Mississippi. His family later moved to Columbus, Mississippi in 1918. He later studied at the Chicago Art Institute. There, a fellow alumnus told Meador he was traveling to California to be interviewed at Walt Disney Productions, and suggested for him to come along. At first, Meador refused as he wanted to do commercial art, but he was coerced into interviewing at Disney. There, he was hired to work in their animation effects department, where he worked on numerous films such as &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot;, for which the studio won an Academy Award. Meador also created the animation effects for the 1956 MGM science-fiction film &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;, most notably the &quot;Monster from the Id&quot; that attacks the spaceship. Privately, Meador described himself as &quot;first and foremost a painter&quot;, in which he painted more than 2,000 canvases and impressionistic landscape and seascape paintings.

In August 1965, Meador suffered a heart attack and died at his residence in Casper, California. He is buried at Friendship Cemetery in Columbus, Mississippi, which was also his hometown. There is a historical marker at his childhood home.

<text>Ruy González de Clavijo (died 2 April 1412) was a Castilian traveler and writer. In 1403–05 Clavijo was the ambassador of Henry III of Castile to the court of Timur, founder and ruler of the Timurid Empire. A diary of the journey, perhaps based on detailed notes kept while traveling, was later published in Spanish in 1582 (&quot;&quot;) and in English in 1859 (&quot;Narrative of the Embassy of Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo to the Court of Timour at Samarcand AD 1403–6&quot;).

==The embassy to Samarkand==
Clavijo, a nobleman of Madrid and chamberlain to the king, set sail from Cadiz on 21 May 1403 in the company of Timur&#x27;s ambassador, Muhammed al-Kazi, a Dominican friar, Alfonso Páez de Santa María, one of the king&#x27;s guards, Gómez de Salazar, and other unnamed Castilians. Clavijo sailed through the Mediterranean, passing Majorca, Sicily and Rhodes to Constantinople. To use the modern names for the countries through which Clavijo passed, he sailed along the Black Sea coast of Anatolia to Trebizond and then overland through Armenia and Iran to Turkestan. He visited Tehran in 1404. The original intention was to meet with Timur at his winter pasturage in the Kingdom of Georgia, but due to foul weather conditions and a shipwreck, the embassy was forced to return to Constantinople and spend the winter of 1403–1404 there.

After setting sail from Constantinople across the Black Sea, the entourage spent the following months following in the wake of Timur&#x27;s army, but were unable to catch up to the rapidly moving, mounted horde. It is for this reason that the Castilian delegation continued all the way to Timur&#x27;s capital at Samarkand, in modern Uzbekistan, arriving there on 8 September 1404, occasioning the most detailed contemporary description of Timur&#x27;s court by a westerner. Clavijo found the city in a constant cycle of construction and rebuilding, in search of perfection:
The Mosque which Timur had caused to be built to the memory of the mother of his wife... seemed to us to be the noblest of all we visited in the city of Samarkand, but no sooner had it been completed than he began to find fault with its entrance gateway, which he now said was much too low and must be pulled down.

Clavijo&#x27;s long-sought first audience with Timur was in &quot;a great orchard with a palace therein&quot;, the paradise garden of Iranian tradition, where Clavijo gave detailed descriptions of the trained and painted elephants he saw, and the tent-pavilions of jewel- and pearl-encrusted silks with tassels and banners that fluttered in the wind. The embassy spent several months in Samarkand, during which time the Castilians attended celebrations for Timur&#x27;s recent victory at Ankara in July 1402 over the Turkish sultan, Bayezid I, whom he captured, relieving Western fears of Ottoman expansion in Hungary and spurring the desire for diplomatic connections on the part of Charles VI of France as well as Henry of Castile. Unable to procure a letter from Timur for their king, Henry, due to Timur&#x27;s ill health (Timur&#x27;s final illness), the Castilians were forced to depart Samarkand on 21 November 1404, due to Timur&#x27;s impending death.

<text>A knickerbocker glory is a layered ice cream sundae that is served in a large tall conical glass, and to be eaten with a distinctive long spoon, particularly in Great Britain and Ireland.

The &quot;knickerbocker glory&quot;, first described in the 1920s, may contain ice cream, cream, fruit, and meringue. Layers of these different sweet tastes are alternated in a tall glass and topped with different kinds of syrup, nuts, whipped cream and often a cherry. The existence of these layers, which create red and white stripes, distinguishes the dish from a tall sundae and lends the knickerbocker glory its name.

==History and etymology==
An early form of the knickerbocker glory is believed to have originated in New York City in the early 1900s. The name &quot;&quot; (as it pertains to the dish) is thought to be named after the Knickerbocker Hotel in Manhattan. During the early 1900s, the hotel was pink-and-cream-colored, and well-known to the denizens of New York. After it closed in 1920, a tall pink-and-cream colored dish was created in honor of the hotel and the word &quot;glory&quot; was appended to the name of the dish. At some point in the 1920s, the dish was introduced into the United Kingdom, where it attained wide popularity.

<doc id="1328783" wikidata="Q3552995" url="?curid=1328783" title="VR.5">
<text>VR.5 is an American science-fiction television series first broadcast on the Fox network from March 10 to May 12, 1995. Ten of its thirteen episodes were aired during its original run. The title of the show refers to the degree of immersion the protagonist experiences in virtual reality.

==Plot==
Prior to the events of the series, Sydney Bloom was the daughter of Dr. Joseph Bloom, a computer scientist who was working on developing virtual reality. His wife Nora Bloom, a neurochemist, was also involved in the project. Sydney&#x27;s father, and her sister Samantha, died in a car accident in 1978.

Now in 1995, Sydney is a telephone lineworker and computer hobbyist. One day, she accidentally discovers that she can enter an advanced type of virtual reality, where she can interact with other people. Her actions in the virtual world have an effect on the real world. She subsequently agrees to use her abilities to help a mysterious secret organization called the Committee. She receives her covert assignments from Frank Morgan, and later from Oliver Sampson. Sydney&#x27;s friend Duncan advises her and helps her when he can.

The show frequently uses inconsistencies in continuity and a distinctive color scheme as clues to suggest what is actually happening at various points throughout the series.

==Cast==
*Lori Singer as Sydney Bloom
*Michael Easton as Duncan
*Will Patton as Frank Morgan (episodes 1-4)
*Anthony Head as Oliver Sampson (episodes 5-13)
*David McCallum as Joseph Bloom
*Louise Fletcher as Nora Bloom
*Tracey Needham as Samantha Bloom

==Production==

===Development===
&quot;VR.5&quot;, a mid-season replacement, debuted shortly after the rise to popularity of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, and executive producer Thania St. John stated that &quot;&quot;VR&quot; will try to capture that same, creepy feeling.&quot;

===Filming===
The show&#x27;s visual effects for when characters were inside virtual reality were created by shooting on black-and-white film and then manually adding color to each image. This effect took four weeks to create for each episode and added to the cost of the show, which was about U.S. $1.5 million per episode. While distributor Rysher Entertainment never confirmed it, the high cost of the production, coupled with a difficult time slot, contributed to the show&#x27;s commercial failure.

===Music===
The music for &quot;VR.5&quot; was created by composer John Frizzell. The opening theme music came to Frizzell in a dream. Dee Carstensen and Eileen Frizzell provided the vocals in the opening theme. The music supervisor of the series was Abby Treloggen. A soundtrack CD was released in 1995 on the Zoo Entertainment/BMG Music label.

== Episodes ==
&quot;Sisters,&quot; &quot;Send Me An Angel,&quot; and &quot;Parallel Lives&quot; were not broadcast on Fox. However, they were broadcast in countries such as Canada, Norway, France and the United Kingdom. The series was eventually shown in its entirety on the Sci Fi Channel. The episode &quot;Sisters&quot; was not aired in the UK to make room for an &quot;X-Files&quot; documentary.

==Legacy==
The series was broadcast on CBS Drama in Europe in early 2014.

&quot;Virtual Storm,&quot; an online community, lobbied Fox to develop a movie featuring the cast and crew of &quot;VR.5&quot;, but the project was dropped after the scripting stage.

==Home media==
Episodes of &quot;VR.5&quot; were released on VHS in 2000 by Rhino Home Video.

<doc id="1328789" wikidata="Q2272704" url="?curid=1328789" title="I've Got a Feeling">
<text>&quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Feeling&quot; is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1970 album &quot;Let It Be&quot;. It was recorded on 30 January 1969 during the Beatles&#x27; rooftop concert. It is a combination of two unfinished songs: Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Feeling&quot; and John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Everybody Had a Hard Year&quot;. The song features Billy Preston on electric piano.

A studio take of the song, recorded about a week earlier, was released on the &quot;Anthology 3&quot; compilation in 1996. The 2003 remix album &quot;Let It Be... Naked&quot; includes a version of the song that is a composite edit of the rooftop concert take used on &quot;Let It Be&quot; and a second attempt at the song from the same concert.

With Lennon&#x27;s vocals isolated out during the production of Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Get Back&quot; documentary, McCartney performed the song live as a virtual duet on his 2022 Got Back tour.

==Composition==
Lennon&#x27;s song was a litany where every line started with the word &quot;everybody&quot;. The song had been recorded twice before by Lennon, prior to the &quot;Let It Be&quot; sessions. The first occurred in early December 1968 at Lennon&#x27;s Kenwood estate on a portable cassette tape. For this, the lyric was &quot;Every&quot;one&quot; had a hard year&quot; instead of the later &quot;Everybody&quot;. Later in December 1968, with the lyric changed to &quot;everybody,&quot; Lennon was filmed performing the song in the back garden of Kenwood. This footage was used in the Yoko Ono art film &quot;Rape: Film No. 6&quot;, which was broadcast on Austrian television on 31 March 1969.

<text>Robert C. Gilman, born 1945, is a thinker on sustainability who, along with his late wife Diane Gilman, has researched and written about ecovillages. The Gilmans’ work was important in giving definition to the ecovillage movement and shaping the direction of the Global Ecovillage Network. In 1991, the Gilmans co-authored &quot;Eco-Villages and Sustainable Communities&quot;, a seminal study of ecovillages for Gaia Trust.

Also in 1991, Gilman, who was publisher of the magazine &quot;In Context&quot;, wrote an article entitled “The Eco-village Challenge” that set out a definition of an ecovillage as a:
*human-scale
*full-featured settlement
*in which human activities are harmlessly integrated into the natural world
*in a way that is supportive of healthy human development and can be successfully continued into the indefinite future. 

This definition was to become the standard definition on which the ecovillage movement was founded and is still considered by many to be the most authoritative.

==From astrophysics to global sustainability==
Gilman&#x27;s academic training is in astrophysics. He graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 1967 with a bachelor&#x27;s in astronomy. He received a Ph.D. in astrophysics from Princeton University in 1969. Gilman has taught and conducted research at the University of Minnesota, the Harvard Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and was a research associate at NASA&#x27;s Institute for Space Studies.

Another phase of Gilman&#x27;s life began in the mid 1970s when he decided that &quot;the stars could wait, but the planet couldn&#x27;t.&quot; He turned his attention to the study of global sustainability, futures research and strategies for positive cultural change. He and Diane designed and built their own solar home in 1975. In 1979 they founded the Context Institute, one of the earliest NGOs to focus on sustainability.

In 1983 the Context Institute began publishing &quot;In Context&quot;, A Quarterly of Humane Sustainable Culture, with Gilman as editor. &quot;In Context&quot; won Utne Reader&#x27;s Alternative Press Award for &quot;Best Coverage of Emerging Issues&quot; in 1991 and 1994.

Gilman was a member of the Langley, Washington City Council until 2011. He has now focused his time on the Bright Future program, including the Bright Future Now course and the Bright Future Network.

<doc id="1328813" wikidata="Q1853402" url="?curid=1328813" title="NIFTY 50">
<text>The NIFTY 50 is an Indian stock market index that represents the float-weighted average of 50 of the largest Indian companies listed on the National Stock Exchange. Nifty 50 is owned and managed by NSE Indices, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the National Stock Exchange of India. The Nifty 50 index was launched on 22 April 1996 with a base date of 3 November 1995 and with 1000 as its base value.

The NIFTY 50 index ecosystem consists of index funds (both onshore and offshore mutual funds and ETFs), and futures and options at NSE and NSE International Exchange (through GIFT Nifty). In 2016, NIFTY 50 was reported by the WFE and FIA as the world&#x27;s most actively traded index options contract, but it was later overtaken by Nifty Bank. In 2024, NIFTY 50 overtook Nifty Bank after the latter&#x27;s weekly expiry contracts were discontinued.

The NIFTY 50 index covers 13 sectors of the Indian economy and offers investment managers exposure to the Indian market in one portfolio. As of July 2024, NIFTY 50 gives a weightage of 32.76% to financial services including banking, 13.76% to information technology, 12.12% to oil and gas, 8.46% to consumer goods, and 8.22% to automotive.

==Methodology==
The NIFTY 50 index is a free float market capitalisation-weighted index.

Stocks are added to the index based on the following criteria:

# Must have traded at an average impact cost of 0.50% or less during the last six months for 90% of the observations, for the basket size of Rs. 100 million.
# The company should have a listing history of 6 months.
# Companies that are allowed to trade in F&amp;O segment are only eligible to be constituent of the index.
# The company should have a minimum listing history of 1 month as on the cutoff date

The index was initially calculated on a full market capitalization methodology. On 26 June 2009, the computation was changed to a free-float methodology. The base period for the NIFTY 50 index is 3 November 1995, which marked the completion of one year of operations of the equity market segment on NSE. The base value of the index has been set at 1000 and a base capital of ₹ 2.06 trillion.

The index is re-balanced on semi-annual basis. The cut-off date is January 31 and July 31 every year and average data for the previous six months from the cut-off date is considered to filter stocks. A notice of 4 weeks from the date of change is given to market participants so that they can prepare for any changes.

==Constituents==
The Nifty 50 has the following constituents, as of 30 September 2024.
==Index changes==
Changes in index constituents since Nifty 50 adopted free float criteria in 2009:

=== Annual returns ===
The following table shows the annual development of the NIFTY 50 since 2000. The historical daily returns data can be accessed from the NSE website.
==Derivatives==
Trading in futures and options on the NIFTY 50 is offered by the NSE and NSE International Exchange (NSEIX). NSE offers weekly as well as monthly expiry options..

NSE allows international traders to trade on the NIFTY 50 by GIFT NIFTY. The same index had previously operated under the name SGX Nifty, and was traded on the Singapore Exchange. It was rebranded to GIFT Nifty on 3 July 2023 and trading was moved to the NSE International Exchange (NSEIX) situated in GIFT City, Gandhinagar. The CEO of NSEIX called it a watershed moment since it was the first time India got back an international contract which had previously been exported.

==NIFTY Next 50==

NIFTY Next 50, also called NIFTY Junior, is an index of 50 companies whose free float market capitalisation comes after that of the companies in NIFTY 50. NIFTY Next 50 constituents are thus potential candidates for future inclusion in NIFTY 50.

<text>The NIFTY Next 50 is a stock market index provided and maintained by NSE Indices. It represents the next rung of liquid securities after the NIFTY 50. It consists of 50 companies representing approximately 10% of the traded value of all stocks on the National Stock Exchange of India. It is quoted using the symbol NIFTYJR.

The NIFTY Next 50 and the NIFTY 50 together comprise the NIFTY 100, which represents the top 100 companies trading on the National Stock Exchange of India based on full market capitalisation. The Nifty Next 50 Index represents 50 companies from Nifty 100 after excluding the Nifty 50 companies.

The Nifty Next 50 Index represents about 10% of the free float market capitalization of the stocks listed on NSE as on September 29, 2023. The total traded value for the last six months September 2023 of all index constituents is approximately 11.2% of the traded value of all stocks on NSE.

== Methodology ==
The level of the index reflects total free float market value of all the stocks in the index relative to a particular base market capitalization value. This methodology is similar to the one employed to add stocks to NIFTY 50.

Stocks are added to the index based on the following criteria:

# Represents 50 companies from Nifty 100 after excluding the constituents of Nifty 50.
# Cumulative weight of index constituents that are not available for trading in F&amp;O segment (Non F&amp;O stocks) is capped at 10% on a quarterly rebalance dates.
# Weightage of non F&amp;O stocks in the index are individually capped at 4.5% on quarterly rebalance dates.

The index is re-balanced on semi-annual basis. The cut-off date is January 31 and July 31 every year and average data for the previous six months from the cut-off date is considered to filter stocks. A notice of 4 weeks from the date of change is given to market participants so that they can prepare for any changes.

==Comparison with Nifty 50==
Nifty Next 50 was launched on December 24, 1996, considering November 03, 1995 as base date and 1000 as base value while Nifty 50 was launched on April 22, 1996, considering November 03, 1995 as base date and 1000 as base value. Nifty Next 50 has outperformed the Nifty 50 considering returns from its start date to April 2024.

<doc id="1328824" wikidata="Q6286933" url="?curid=1328824" title="Joseph Segel">
<text>Joseph Myron Segel (January 9, 1931 – December 21, 2019) was an American entrepreneur. He was the founder of over 20 American companies, most notably QVC, an American television network, and the Franklin Mint, a producer of mail-order collectibles. Segel was named to the Direct Marketing Association&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1993. He was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Electronic Retailing Association and an honorary doctorate from Drexel University.

He was awarded the Philip H. Ward, Jr. Medal from The Franklin Institute in 1977. In 2005, the Harvard Business School published their selection of &quot;The Greatest Business Leaders of the Twentieth Century&quot;. Then, in 2007, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania published their selection of &quot;The Most Influential Wharton Alumni and Faculty in the Wharton School&#x27;s 125-year history&quot;. Segel was one of only 10 people who was on both of these lists.

== Early life ==
Born to a Jewish family, Segel, at the age of 13, started a successful printing business. At 16, he entered the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. In 1951 he received a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics. As a graduate student, he taught introductory marketing classes while running the &quot;Advertising Specialty Institute&quot;, his first significant business. A first in the industry, it published a centralized directory of promotional materials and their suppliers, the Advertising Specialty Register.

In 1964, Segel took note of two concurrent events – the passing of General Douglas MacArthur and people lining up at banks to buy up the last U.S. silver dollars. In response, he founded the National Commemorative Society, which introduced a monthly series of limited edition, sterling silver commemorative coin-like medals honoring events and heroes in American history, starting with a medal commemorating General Douglas MacArthur. Later that year, dissatisfied with the quality of the coin-medals produced by a subcontractor, he recruited Gilroy Roberts, then Chief Engraver of the U.S. Mint, to join him in starting the General Numismatics Corporation. GNC became the Franklin Mint in 1965, shortly after going public. The Franklin Mint quickly expanded to produce not only coin-like medals and casino tokens, but other collectibles, including car models, luxury board-game editions, and porcelain dolls.

Segel retired as chairman of Franklin Mint Corporation in 1973.

==National Software Testing Laboratories==
Segel founded the National Software Testing Laboratories aka NSTL in 1983. The company published several monthly newsletters including &quot;Software Digest&quot;. The publications were often subscribed by IT departments of major corporations, as a basis to evaluate and consider products for their company. PC Hardware and software publishers often contracted the company to perform compatibility and performance tests. NSTL passed through a series of owners, including publisher McGraw-Hill, before being acquired by Intertek in 2007.

==Public service==
In 1971, Segel was elected chairman of the Board of Governors of the United Nations Association of the USA. Two years later, President Gerald Ford appointed him as a member of the U.S. Delegation to that year&#x27;s United Nations General Assembly, where he served under Henry Kissinger. He also organized a national campaign of the Advertising Council to improve public understanding of the United Nations, chaired a national conference on the United Nations for the American Society of Newspapers Editors and testified in support of the United Nations before the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In 1986 he wrote an article in The New York Times in defense of Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim&#x27;s recently discovered service as a Wehrmacht intelligence officer during WWII.

== QVC ==
In 1986, Segel decided to start QVC (&quot;Quality Value Convenience&quot;) after watching a videotape of the Home Shopping Network. Immediately, he identified many potential improvements, from the items offered for sale to their presentation. To lend credibility to the new company, QVC made a two-year deal to sell Sears products. He raised over $20 million in capital, including support from Ralph Roberts, the founder and chairperson of Comcast. Roberts was able to arrange deals in which cable companies received investment stakes in QVC in exchange for carrying the channel. Fifty-eight cable systems in twenty states signed on for the 7:30 pm to 12:00 midnight broadcast, giving it an audience of 7.6 million TV homes for its November 24 launch. Publicly offered at $10 on September 5, 1986, QVC stock closed its first trading day at $20 per share, even though its first broadcast was months away.

Segel demanded that the presenters sell by informing, not pressuring the viewers about the product. This meant that presenters would have to study each product, explain the many benefits of the product, and know the product&#x27;s sales history in order to make the sell more informative and entertaining. He forbid the hard sell and, unlike the Home Shopping Network, established that customers could purchase at any time, with no last minute price cuts, and no high pressure tactics. From 1986 to 1989 the Plymouth-based Cable Value Network was the dominant player in the industry with HSN second and QVC a distant third. Through the backing of cable operators, QVC launched a hostile takeover of CVN and wound up buying it out, only to take CVN off the air and replace it with QVC programming. QVC emerged as HSN&#x27;s only serious competitor, out of hundreds of copycats, even though it was on the verge of collapse in the early 1990s until Barry Diller came on board. Today QVC employs a total of over 10,000 people, and did around $8.6 billion in business in fiscal year 2013, making it the second highest-grossing American television network, surpassed in revenue only by CBS.

Joseph Segel retired from QVC in 1993 upon Diller&#x27;s hire, but remained involved in the network until 2013 in an advisory role.

==Death==
Segel died on December 21, 2019, at the age of 88 in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, from congestive heart failure.

<doc id="1328827" wikidata="Q448316" url="?curid=1328827" title="Alvars">
<text>The Alvars () were the Tamil poet-saints of South India who espoused &quot;bhakti&quot; (devotion) to the Hindu preserver deity Vishnu, in their songs of longing, ecstasy, and service. They are venerated in Vaishnavism, which regards Vishnu as the Ultimate Reality.

Many modern academics place the lifetime of the Alvars between the 5th century and 9th century CE. Traditionally, the Alvars are considered to have lived between and . Orthodoxy posits the number of Alvars as ten, though there are other references that include Andal and Madhurakavi Alvar, making the number 12. Andal is the only female Alvar among the 12. Together with the contemporary 63 Shaivite Nayanars, they are among the most important saints from Tamil Nadu.

The devotional outpourings of the Alvars, composed during the early medieval period of Tamil history, were the catalysts behind the Bhakti Movement through their hymns of worship to Vishnu and his avatars. They praised the Divya Desams, the 108 divine realms of deities affiliated to Vaishnavism. The poetry of the Alvars echoes &quot;bhakti&quot; to God through love, and in the ecstasy of such devotions they sang hundreds of songs which embodied both depth of feeling and the felicity of expressions. The collection of their hymns is known as the &quot;Naalayira Divya Prabandham&quot;. The &quot;bhakti&quot; literature that sprang from Alvars has contributed to the establishment and sustenance of a culture that deviated from the Vedic religion and rooted itself in devotion as the only path for salvation. In addition, they contributed to Tamil devotional verses independent of a knowledge of Sanskrit. As a part of the legacy of the Alvars, five Vaishnavite philosophical traditions (&quot;sampradayas&quot;) developed over a period of time.
==Etymology==

The word &quot;Alvar&quot; has traditionally been etymologized as from Tamil &quot;Al&quot; (ஆழ்), &#x27;to immerse oneself&#x27; as &#x27;one who dives deep into the ocean of the countless attributes of god&#x27;.

The Indologist Sudalaimuthu Palaniappan has established from epigraphy and textual evidence that the traditional term Āḻvār (ஆழ்வார்) for Vaiṣṇavaite Tamil poet saints has historically been a corruption of the original Āḷvār (ஆள்வார்). 

=== Correction of the original Āḷvār (ஆள்வார்) to Āḻvār (ஆழ்வார்) ===
Palaniappan shows that what was originally Āḷvār (ஆள்வார்) meaning &#x27;One who rules&#x27;, or &#x27;(Spiritual) Master&#x27; got changed through hypercorrection and folk etymology to Āḻvār (ஆழ்வார்) meaning &#x27;One who is immersed&#x27;. Palaniappan cites inscriptional evidence and even literary evidence from Vaishnavaite tradition itself for a gradual sound change from Āḷvār (ஆள்வார்) to Āḻvār (ஆழ்வார்) over a period of two centuries from the 9th to the 11th century involving references to religious leaders in Vaiṣṇavism, Śaivism and even Jainism and to political personalities. He states: &quot;āḻvār is but a corrupt form of āḷvār which has been used interchangeably with nāyanār in secular and religious contexts in the Tamil land&quot; and &quot;... Notwithstanding the Vaiṣṇava claim of unbroken teacher-student tradition, the fact that Nāthamuni has used the form āļvār but Piļļān, a disciple and younger cousin of Rāmānuja, ended up using the form āḻvār suggests that there has been an error in transmission somewhere along the teacher-student chain between the two teachers. This error was obviously due to the influence of the sound variation that has occurred in the Srirangam area and elsewhere&quot;.

The original word ஆள்வார் compares with the epithet &#x27;Āṇḍãḷ&#x27; (ஆண்டாள்) for the female canonized Vaishnava saint Gōdai (கோதை) and they share the same verb Tamil. āḷ (ஆள், to rule), the former being the honorific non-past (or present-future) form and the latter the feminine past form of that same verb.

=== Reception by scholars ===
Palaniappan&#x27;s findings on &#x27;Āḻvār&#x27; have been accepted by scholars like Prof. Alexander Dubyanskiy. In his article on Āṇṭāḷ, Dubyanskiy says, &quot;Āṇṭāḷ was among the twelve Āḻvārs, the poet-saints, adepts of Viṣṇu, canonized by the tradition, which accepted the interpretation of meaning of the word āḻvār as &quot;submerged, plunged [in love for god]&quot;, from the verbal root āḻ, &quot;to plunge, to be in the deep&quot;. But recently it was convincingly shown by S. Palaniappan (2004) that initially the term in question was represented by the word āḷvār (from the verbal root āḷ &quot;to rule&quot;), which reads as &quot;those who rule, lords&quot;, and was applied in the texts, both Śaiva and Vaiṣṇava, to Śiva and Viṣṇu accordingly (pp. 66–70). In the course of time the term underwent the process of sound variation, took the form āḻvār and acquired the folk etymology which was accepted and fixed by the tradition. This interpretation agrees well with the meaning of the poetess&#x27; nickname Āṇṭāḷ, which means &quot;she who rules&quot;.

== Legend ==
The Alvars are considered the twelve supreme devotees of Vishnu in Sri Vaishnavism, who were instrumental in popularising Vaishnavism in the Tamil-speaking regions. The Alvars were influential in promoting the Bhagavata cult and the two Hindu epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. The religious works of these saints in Tamil, and their hymns, are compiled as the &quot;Naalayira Divya Prabandham,&quot; containing 4000 verses, and the 108 temples revered in their hymns are classified as &quot;Divya Desams&quot;. The verses of the various &quot;Alvars&quot; were compiled by Nathamuni (824–924 CE), a 9th-century Vaishnavite theologian, who called it the &quot;Dravida Veda or Tamil Veda&quot;. The songs of the &quot;Prabandam&quot; are regularly sung in various Vishnu temples of South India, daily, and also during festivals.

The legendary birth of the Alvars is traced to an event in the mid-Dvapara Yuga, due to a heated debate between Vishvakarma (the divine architect of the gods) and Agastya (a sage) about the superiority of the Sanskrit or the Tamil language. In the midst of this debate, Agastya gets furious, which makes him curse the former that at some point of time, one of his pieces of architecture would be destroyed (a contemporary to Gandhari&#x27;s curse to Dvaraka) and would never be recovered. (Some sources say Agastya curses Vishvakarma for Sanskrit to lose its fame, as the curse became true in the present Kali Yuga). Enraged, Vishvakarma curses Agastya in turn that his most favourite language (Tamil) would be tarnished in the future. Agastya, feeling guilty regarding his actions, is offered a divine vision of Vishnu, who promises him that Tamil would regain its prestige, and that a Tamil Veda would emerge.

After the Kurukshetra war, the decline of Dvaraka, and Krishna&#x27;s death at the hands of the hunter Jara, Krishna, as Vishnu resumes his residence at his abode in Vaikuntha, sowing the seeds of the Kali Yuga. He becomes worried about the people of the Kali Yuga. His attributes, such as the Sudarshana Chakra and the Panchajanya, enquire the reason for his anxiety, and he confides his fears to them. The Sudarshana Chakra suggests that he slice the head of all the people who refuse dharma, to which Vishnu smiles and refuses. Vishnu decides that his &quot;amshas&quot; (parts of his identity) would be incarnated as humans on earth, and teach them the path of righteousness and devotion to him. These amshas happily accepted their birth as the twelve Alvars, aligning with the boon given to Agastya, and also became a role model for the human beings who came later in the Kali Yuga.

Fulfilling the promise that Vishnu made to Agastya, Nammalvar (Regarded to be an incarnation of Vishvaksena) is credited for converting the Rigveda to 100 poems called the &quot;Tiruviruttam,&quot; the Yajurveda as &quot;Thiruvarshiyam,&quot; and the Sama Veda as &quot;Tiruvaymoli&quot; in 1000 verses (poems).

== Varnas ==
The saints had different origins and belonged to different varnas. As per tradition, the first three Alvars, Poigai Alvar, Bhuthath Alvar, Peyalvar and Andal were born miraculously i.e., they were not given birth. Thirumalisai Alvar was the son of a sage Bhargava; Thondaradipodi Alvar, Mathurakavi Alvar, Perialvar were Brahmin; Kulasekhara was a Kshatriya; Nammalvar was from a Shudra (cultivator) vellalar family; Thirupanalvar was from the Avarna &quot;Tamil Panar&quot; community; and Thirumangai Alvar was a Kshatriya Kallar family. Some Vaishnavities consider only the main 10 Alvars (except Andal and Madhurakavi Alvar) while others include these two in the list too. Srirangam is the only Divya Desam that was glorified commonly by the 12 Alvars.

== Works ==
Temple records and inscriptions give a detailed account of the Alvars and their works. According to these texts, the saints were considered incarnations of some form of Vishnu. Few of them are:

# &quot;Divya Suri Charitam&quot; by Garuda-Vahana Pandita (11th century)
# &quot;Guruparamparaprabavam&quot; by Pinbazhagiya Perumal Jiyar 
# &quot;Periya tiru mudi adaivu&quot; by Anbillai Kandadiappan 
# &quot;Yatindra Pranava Prabavam&quot; by Pillai Lokam Jiyar
# commentaries on &quot;Divya Prabandam&quot; 
# Guru Parampara (lineage of Gurus) texts

== Dating ==
According to traditional account by Manavala Mamunigal, the first three &quot;Alvars&quot; namely Poigai Alvar, Bhoothath Alvar and Pey Alvar belong to &quot;Dvapara Yuga&quot; (even before the birth of Krishna, i.e., before 4200 BCE). It is widely accepted by tradition and historians that the trio are the earliest among the twelve Alvars. Along with the three Saiva Nayanmars, they influenced the ruling Pallava kings, creating a Bhakti movement that resulted in changing the religious geography from Buddhism and Jainism to these two sects of Hinduism in the region (even though Buddhism did not exist until 5th century BCE). 

After the era of the Alvars, a few of the poems from the Divya Prabandham were said to be lost. Nathmuni in the 10th century is said to have gone on search for these lost works. He is said to have been blessed with the revelation of three short works by Nammalvar and around 20 poems composed by other poets.

==Summary==

Some modern scholars suggest that they lived during 5th – 9th century CE, &quot;on the basis of a few historical evidences&quot;, although no &quot;clear&quot; evidence exists to place them between the 5th to the 9th century CE. The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; says that Alvars lived between 7th and 10th centuries CE. Professor of Religion and Asian Studies, James G. Lochtefeld of Carthage College, notes in his &quot;The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism&quot;, the first three Alvars Poigai, Bhoothath and Pey belonged to the 7th century; while Nammalvar and Madhurakavi belonged to the 10th century; while the rest of them lived in the 9th century.

Traditionally the Alvars are considered to have lived between 4200 BCE and 2700 BCE, while some texts account for range between 4200 BCE and early 10th century. Traditional dates take them to the age of Shuka from the period of the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, the first four (Poigai Alvar, Bhoothathalvar, Peyalvar and Thirumalisai Alvar) are from &quot;Dvapara Yuga&quot;, while Nammalwar, Madhurakavi Alvar and others belong to &quot;Kali Yuga&quot;.

The following table shows the place, century and star of birth of each Alvar. Scholarly dating, except that of Kulasekhara Alvar, is based on summary of views of modern scholars by Dr. N Subba Reddiar, although even these dates lack historical evidence. Much effort has gone into dating Kulasekhara Alvar recently. The Alvar is now tentatively identified as Sthanu Ravi Kulasekhara (reigned c. 844/45–870/71 CE), the first known ruler of the medieval Cheras kings of Kerala.

==Career==

=== 1991–2000: Beginnings and breakthrough ===
Lee&#x27;s career began in 1991 after a KBS talent audition and making his debut in the television drama &quot;Asphalt My Hometown&quot;. Lee drew attention with the action drama &quot;Asphalt Man&quot; and romantic film &quot;The Harmonium in My Memory&quot;, but it was only in 2000 that he made his big breakthrough with Park Chan-wook&#x27;s &quot;Joint Security Area&quot;. The film broke the box office record and became the highest grossing Korean film at the time. Lee&#x27;s role as a border-guard soldier won him the Best Actor award at the Busan Film Critics Awards.

=== 2001–2009: Global stardom ===
In 2001, Lee&#x27;s popularity continued to climb when he starred in melodramas &quot;Beautiful Days&quot; and &quot;Bungee Jumping of Their Own&quot;. In 2003, he received the Grand Prize at the SBS Drama Awards and Best Actor at the Baeksang Arts Awards for his role in the poker drama &quot;All In&quot;. Due to his film and television roles, Lee experienced a rise in popularity across Asia, particularly Japan.

From 2005, Lee focused on film, earning praise for his performance in &quot;A Bittersweet Life&quot; directed by Kim Jee-woon, which was screened out of competition at the Cannes Film Festival. Lee was nominated for Best Actor at the Blue Dragon Film Awards and Grand Bell Awards, and won at the Chunsa Film Art Awards, Baeksang Arts Awards and the Korean Association of Film Critics Awards.

Lee reunited with director Kim Jee-woon in the &quot;kimchi western&quot; &quot;The Good, the Bad, the Weird&quot;, taking on his first villain role. The film was screened out of competition at the Cannes Film Festival. Lee&#x27;s eye-catching performance in the film led to increased global recognition for him. This led to Lee&#x27;s debut in Hollywood, where he played Storm Shadow in &quot;G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra&quot;, also starring Channing Tatum and Sienna Miller.

Back in Korea, Lee appeared in &quot;I Come with the Rain&quot; opposite American actor Josh Hartnett and Japanese actor Takuya Kimura.

Lee returned to television in late 2009 in the espionage action thriller &quot;Iris&quot; as a secret agent who finds himself at the center of an international conspiracy. He reportedly received over 100 million won per episode for his role, the third highest in the country&#x27;s drama history. &quot;Iris&quot; was one of the most expensive shows ever produced, and was a smash hit across Asia. Lee&#x27;s performance earned him the Grand Prize at the KBS Drama Awards and Best Actor at the Baeksang Arts Awards.

=== 2010–2017: Acclaim and Hollywood roles ===
In 2010, Lee starred in &quot;I Saw the Devil&quot; with Choi Min-sik, his third collaboration with Kim Jee-woon, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. His portrayal of the intelligence agent won him the Grand Prize at the Baeksang Arts Awards.

Lee was praised for his portrayal of dual roles in the lavish period drama &quot;Masquerade&quot;. The film was a box office hit, becoming the 7th film in Korean history to surpass 10 million admissions. Lee won Best Actor at the Grand Bell Awards for his performance. On June 23, 2012, Lee, along with Ahn Sung-ki, became the first Korean actors to leave their hand and foot prints on the forecourt of Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles. He was recognized as an emerging star in Hollywood for his role of Storm Shadow in &quot;G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra&quot;, and its sequel, &quot;G.I. Joe: Retaliation&quot;.

In 2013, Lee reprised his role as Storm Shadow in &quot;G.I. Joe: Retaliation&quot;. He then co-starred in the American film &quot;RED 2&quot;, the sequel to the 2010 action-comedy hit &quot;RED&quot;, alongside Bruce Willis, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Helen Mirren and John Malkovich.

Following his sex-chat scandal, Lee returned with the martial arts film &quot;Memories of the Sword&quot; in 2015. The film was shot in late 2013 and scheduled for release in 2014, but was postponed due to Lee&#x27;s scandal. He received praise for his &quot;scene-stealing&quot; role as a young and ambitious warrior with a lowly status, but the film failed to do well and was criticized for its plot. The same year, Lee played a T-1000 in &quot;Terminator Genisys&quot; opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger. He then starred in Woo Min-ho&#x27;s political crime thriller &quot;Inside Men&quot;, which became the top grossing R-rated movie of all-time at the Korean Box Office. Touted as the &quot;star&quot; of the film, Lee won Best Actor awards at various film awards ceremonies.

In 2016, Lee featured in the American crime thriller &quot;Misconduct&quot;.

In March 2017, Lee signed with major Hollywood agency United Talent Agency. He was cast in the Hollywood action film &quot;Radiance&quot;. The film is directed by Patrick Lussier, who worked with Lee in &quot;Terminator Genisys&quot;. Lee then starred in historical epic &quot;The Fortress&quot;, and comedy-drama film &quot;Keys to the Heart&quot;.

=== 2018–present: Return to television and continued success ===
In 2018, Lee made his television comeback in &quot;Mr. Sunshine&quot;, a historical war drama written by Kim Eun-sook. The series was a commercial and critical success, and Lee won the Grand Prize at the 6th APAN Star Awards.

In 2019, Lee starred in the action film &quot;Ashfall&quot;. In 2020, Lee starred in the political drama &quot;The Man Standing Next&quot;. Both films were box office successes, and proved Lee&#x27;s brand power as a lead actor.
Lee also starred in the political thriller aviation disaster film &quot;Emergency Declaration&quot;, which premiered out of competition at the 74th Cannes Film Festival in July 2021 before its theatrical release in South Korea on August 3, 2022.

==Personal life==
Lee was born in Seoul, South Korea. He has a younger sister, Lee Eun-hee, who won the Miss Congeniality portion of Miss Korea in 1996. He graduated from Hanyang University with a major in French Literature and the Graduate School of Chung-Ang University with a major in Theater and Cinematography. In his spare time, Lee practices taekwondo.

===Relationships===
Lee was previously romantically linked with fellow &quot;All In&quot; lead Song Hye-kyo beginning in the early-2000s. The relationship, though kept completely low-key and rarely publicized, lasted fifteen months before they split in mid-June 2004. Lee married actor Lee Min-jung on August 10, 2013, at the Grand Hyatt Seoul. The couple had briefly dated in 2006, then resumed their relationship in 2012. Lee&#x27;s wife gave birth to their child, a son, Lee Joon-hoo, on March 31, 2015. On August 4, 2023, Lee&#x27;s wife confirmed that she was expecting their second child. They welcomed the birth of their second child, a daughter, born on December 21, 2023.

After he had to clear some debts following his father&#x27;s death, Lee fell into a depression. He then started to suffer panic disorders, and found it difficult to attend award ceremonies. Lee credits his wife with helping him overcome his mental health challenges.

===Civil lawsuit and habitual gambling allegations===
On December 9, 2009, Lee&#x27;s ex-girlfriend Kwon Mi-yeon filed a civil lawsuit alleging she was tricked into having a sexual relationship with the star based on the promise of marriage. She claimed Lee caused her mental anguish and physical damage along with claims that Lee is a chronic gambler and sued for 100 million won. Lee&#x27;s agency, BH Entertainment, countered that her claims were all false and that the lawsuit was retaliatory in nature due to the breakup. Lee countersued Kwon for defamation and extortion.

Shortly after the lawsuit was filed, TV show host Kang Byung-kyu appeared on the set of the TV drama &quot;Iris&quot; that Lee was working on at the time. He was accused of bringing in gangsters and causing a disturbance due to a conflict with a producer that he claimed spread rumors that Kang was behind the feud between Lee and Kwon. Due to this incident, Kang was arrested on assault charges. Kang was also later indicted on charges of blackmail and defamation, with prosecutors alleging that Kang and Kwon colluded to blackmail Lee for large sums of money in November 2009, before Kwon went on to file her civil lawsuit in December, after Lee refused to pay.

Lee was cleared of the illegal gambling charges on March 19, 2010, with prosecutors citing no evidence. Kwon&#x27;s claim for damages was eventually dropped in August 2010 due to her lack of participation in proceedings. Kang was eventually sentenced to one year in prison and three years probation in 2013 on his fraud and assault charges.

===Blackmail scandal===
On August 28, 2014, Lee was blackmailed by singer Dahee from K-pop girl group Glam and model Lee Ji-yeon for 5 billion won (about ) in exchange for not releasing, on the internet, a compromising video of him making sexual jokes while drinking with them on July 3. Dahee and Lee Ji-yeon were arrested on September 1, after Lee reported the crime to police when they handed him two suitcases to transport the money. It was later revealed that the crime was fully intentional and pre-planned, as both Dahee and Lee Ji-yeon looked for plane tickets to escape to Europe and purchased two suitcases to be used for transporting the money. Moreover, the two women attempted to film an additional video of Lee hugging Lee Ji-yeon by secretly placing a smartphone in a kitchen sink, but they failed to do so. However, Lee Ji-yeon claimed that the blackmailing was an impulsive act after Lee broke up with her, for which Lee&#x27;s agency released an official statement, stating that Lee had not once met her alone and that he mentioned to the two women that he wanted to stop meeting them when he sensed ulterior motives from them, after talking about their financial difficulties, demanding he buy them a house. The final trial was held at the Seoul District Court on January 15, 2015, where Dahee was sentenced to a year in jail and Lee Ji-yeon to a year and two months. In February, following the sentencing, Lee requested a pardon for the women, while the prosecution in charge felt that the sentence was too lenient. In March, both women, who were in jail for six months, received a suspended sentence for two years, following Lee&#x27;s pardon request. Glam was disbanded following the sentencing of Dahee.

<text>Diane Gilman (1945–1998), was a painter, potter, writer and co-founder of the Context Institute. She played a key role in the initial development and coordination of the Global Ecovillage Network, a support network for model communities to show how to live more sustainably on the planet, in urban, rural, developed and less developed situations. In 1991, she and her husband, Robert Gilman co-wrote &quot;Eco-Villages and Sustainable Communities&quot;, a seminal study of ecovillages for Gaia Trust.

==Biography==
Gilman attended the University of California at Santa Barbara, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in Art. A professional watercolor painter and potter, she founded the Context Institute with her husband, Robert in 1979. She was Associate Publisher of &quot;In Context&quot; magazine from 1983–1995 and coordinated citizen diplomacy work with the USSR for the Institute. She and Robert Gilman co-founded the Foundation for Russian/American Economic Cooperation, in Seattle, Washington.

Gilman directed the Context Institute&#x27;s Sustainable Community Program and coauthored a 1991 report on Ecovillages and Sustainable Communities around the world. The report included guidelines for the development of sustainable communities, along with case studies. Gilman co-facilitated a major Sustainable Community and Ecovillage Conference held at Findhorn, Scotland, in October 1995. This conference was instrumental in giving shape to the ecovillage movement.

She was on the advisory board of the Ecovillage Training Center in Summertown, Tennessee as well as other organizations working to provide positive solutions for living in our times.

<doc id="1328846" wikidata="Q4977209" url="?curid=1328846" title="Bruce C. Harris">
<text>Bruce Campbell Harris also known as Bruce Campbell Harris Lloyd OBE (1955, Scotland – May 30, 2010, Florida) was the Executive Director of Casa Alianza, a charity whose aims are the rehabilitation and the defence of children.

He served in this post from 1989 to September 2004, when he was fired from his post as director of Casa Alianza. According to Casa Alianza, Harris had admitted acting improperly by paying for sex with a 19-year-old Honduran who had been a resident in one of its shelters. &quot;I assume, as I always have done, responsibility for my acts, correct or incorrect... While we all try to do our best, we are also human&quot; said Harris.

==Personal life and career==
Harris grew up in Dorset, and after high school he joined the conservative musical group Up with People serving as an emcee from 1975 until 1980. After returning to school with a major in International Studies, he joined Save the Children as a volunteer, and in 1989 he became the head of Covenant House&#x27;s Latin American operations as executive director of Casa Alianza.

In 1993 he had to flee with his family from Guatemala when bullets were fired at the office where he worked after his investigations led to criminal proceedings being brought against police officers for the torture of street children.

In 1998, he was tried and acquitted after charges of defamation, libel and slander were brought against him by an attorney for the Defenders Association of Adoption, María Susana Luarca Saracho because of his claims about irregular adoptions in Guatemala. In 2000, Costa Rican president Miguel Angel Rodríguez accused him of plotting to damage that nation&#x27;s reputation regarding its alleged child sex trade. He spoke in support of a class action lawsuit against the government of Guatemala seeking damages for alleged state sponsored genocide.

Harris&#x27; profile at speaktruth.org states that his work led to 392 criminal prosecutions of alleged crimes involving children. Most of these prosecutions occurred subsequent to Harris having filed denunciations (complaints) of child &quot;sexual abuse.&quot;

==Allegations of misconduct==
In 2004, Harris was dismissed from his post after he was accused of paying for sex with a 19-year-old man. This young man had, as a child, been a resident of Casa Alianza until 2002. Harris stated he resigned from Casa Alianza in order to spend more time with his family. Casa Alianza&#x27;s parent organization Covenant House stated he was actually dismissed. In 2004, Harris said that he would cooperate with the Honduran prosecutors investigating Harris for allegations of sexual misconduct with children. In 2005 the case was dropped because the prosecutors could not determine if any crimes had been committed, and found no evidence that Harris had abused children while they were at Casa Alianza in Honduras.

==Awards and recognition==

In 1991 Harris was named a &quot;Hero of Human Rights&quot; by Amnesty International. 
As director of Casa Alianza, he accepted the Olof Palme Prize in 1996. 
In 2000, he received the Conrad N. Hilton Humanitarian Award of one million dollars, as well as the Order of the British Empire medal. He was also listed as one of &quot;51 heroic activists&quot; profiled in Kerry Kennedy Cuomo&#x27;s &quot;Speak Truth to Power: Human Rights Defenders Who Are Changing Our World&quot;. 
In 2001, he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, and he received the Archbishop Oscar Romero Award of the University of Dayton, USA, for his work in defending the human rights of street children in Mexico and Central America.

<text>Quincy Jamie Owusu-Abeyie (born 15 April 1986), often known simply as Quincy, is a former professional footballer who played as a forward or left winger. Quincy is also a rapper, who goes by the name BLOW.

He began his career with Ajax before moving to Arsenal as a 16-year-old. He went on to play for clubs in a variety of countries: Spartak Moscow of the Russian Premier League, Spanish clubs Celta Vigo and Málaga, Birmingham City, Cardiff City and Portsmouth in the English leagues, Al-Sadd of Qatar, Superleague Greece club Panathinaikos, Boavista of Portugal, and most recently in his native Netherlands with NEC.

Quincy played international football for his country of birth at youth level, but in 2007 requested to become eligible to represent his parents&#x27; country, Ghana, instead. FIFA approved his request just ahead of the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations, and he represented Ghana in that tournament and at the 2010 World Cup.

==Club career==

===Early career and AFC Ajax===
Quincy was born in Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Ghanaian parents. Quincy had been a member of the youth system at hometown club Ajax for nine years when he was released at the age of 16 for alleged attitude problems.

===Arsenal===
Liam Brady, head of youth development at Premier League club Arsenal, offered him a trial which proved successful, and the player joined Arsenal as a scholar in September 2002. In the 2002–03 season he scored 17 goals in 20 games for the under-17 side, including six in a 7–1 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers U17. Handed his first professional contract on his 18th birthdaya move which led to Arsenal being fined £10,000 and given a suspended two-year transfer ban for inadvertently dealing with an unlicensed agentQuincy signed a new long-term contract in July 2005.

His first-team debut came as an 85th-minute substitute in the League Cup match against Rotherham United on 28 October 2003. During extra time he attempted to chip Rotherham goalkeeper Mike Pollitt, who handled the ball outside his penalty area and was sent off. With the score 1–1 after 120 minutes the game was decided in a penalty shootoutthe first ever shootout featuring Arsenal at Highburywhich Arsenal won, although Quincy missed his kick. He scored his first goal for the first team in the same competition on 9 November 2004 against Everton, a match in which he also made two assists, and contributed two appearances to Arsenal&#x27;s victorious 2004–05 FA Cup campaign. He produced an impressive performance against Reading during the Gunners&#x27; 2005–06 League Cup run.

However, he failed to break through to regular first-team selection. Although he accepted the need for patience, and appreciated training alongside and learning from players such as Thierry Henry and Dennis Bergkamp, once Arsenal boosted their forward line in the January 2006 transfer window by signing Togo international Emmanuel Adebayor and rising star Theo Walcott, Quincy recognised that he needed to leave.

===Spartak Moscow===

Quincy signed for Russian club Spartak Moscow for an undisclosed fee on 31 January 2006.

====Celta de Vigo (loan)====
In June 2007, it was reported that Premier League club Birmingham City had expressed interest in Quincy and wanted to bring him back to play in England, but on the final day of the summer 2007 transfer window he joined Spanish side Celta de Vigo on loan for the 2007–08 season with an option to purchase. He made 20 appearances in the Segunda División, of which half were as a substitute, and scored five goals, though he missed several weeks of the season on international duty at the 2008 African Cup of Nations.

====Birmingham City (loan)====
On 6 August 2008, Quincy joined Birmingham City on loan, initially until January 2009, but with the intention of extending the loan for the rest of the season. An option was included to purchase the player outright at that point. He made his debut as a second-half substitute in the first-round League Cup match against Wycombe Wanderers, scoring the fourth goal in a 4–0 win with a fine finish from . He then went on to score crucial league goals against Cardiff City and Derby County. The initial loan was not extended past January 2009, manager Alex McLeish suggesting that financial considerations might have come into play.

====Cardiff City (loan)====
Quincy trialled with Premier League Tottenham Hotspur, but went on to sign for Cardiff City of the Football League Championship on loan until the end of the 2008–09 season, again with the option of making the switch permanent at that point. He made his debut for the club on 25 February as a late substitute for Chris Burke in a 0–0 draw with Queens Park Rangers, but made only three more substitute appearances for the club during the remainder of the season before returning to Moscow.

Reportedly &quot;available for a small fee&quot;, he trained with Championship side Bristol City for ten days in August 2009, but no deal was forthcoming.

====Portsmouth (loan)====
On 27 January 2010, Quincy signed for Premier League side Portsmouth on loan for the rest of the 2009–10 season, and made his debut in the defeat at Manchester City four days later, coming on as a late substitute for Hayden Mullins. As a second-half substitute in Portsmouth&#x27;s fifth-round FA Cup-tie against local rivals Southampton, Quincy made a decisive impact, scoring the opening goal with a &quot;low and precise finish&quot; before setting up two further goals as Portsmouth won 4–1.

===Al-Sadd===
In late March, Spartak were reported to have repaid Portsmouth half the loan fee of £500,000 to terminate the loan agreement early, and on 31 March, Quincy signed a three-year contract with Qatari club Al-Sadd.

====Málaga CF (loan)====
By the summer of 2010, Quincy was playing for La Liga club Málaga during their pre-season tour of Germany, and on 20 August, signed for the club on loan for the 2010–11 season. He scored his first goal for the club, and had an assist, as Málaga beat Real Zaragoza 5–3 in the second week of the season.

===Panathinaikos===
Quincy joined Superleague Greece club Panathinaikos in July 2011 on a one-year loan.
After of some actions of Panathinaikos management in 2012 transfer period, Quincy finally came to sign a three-year contract with the team. The player was happy to his return and work under the instructions of Jesualdo Ferreira.

In July 2016, a third Eredivisie club, NEC Nijmegen, signed him on a one-year contract. He made 12 league appearances before being demoted to the reserve team for disciplinary reasons, and in January 2017, he was released by mutual consent.

===Netherlands youth teams===
Quincy appeared at the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship for the Netherlands national under-21 football team, the &quot;Jong Oranje&quot; in the summer of 2005.

Though the Netherlands crashed out of the tournament in the quarter-finals after a penalty shoot-out against Nigeria, Described by FIFA.com as &quot;a bit special... full of power, pace and bags of sumptuous skill&quot;, Quincy was profiled as one of the Best Players of that FIFA U20 Championship.

===Switch to Ghana===

In January 2007, Quincy went to Ghana to meet with Ghana Football Association (GFA) officials and discuss his role in Ghanaian football with specific reference to switching allegiance to that country&#x27;s national team. Ghana had hoped to persuade him to represent them at the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, but his previous appearances for his native country at youth level precluded that. As a result of the talks, Quincy pledged his senior international future to Ghana, and coach Claude Le Roy named him in the squad for the February friendly against Nigeria in February. However, FIFA was yet to approve Quincy&#x27;s request for a switch of nationality, and he was not released by Spartak Moscow, prompting a complaint to FIFA by Ghana&#x27;s national coach. Although called up for Ghana&#x27;s match against Austria in March 2007, Quincy did not play, but did confirm that he intended to play for Ghana in the future.

On 18 December 2007, Quincy was called up by Ghana as part of the 40-man squad for their two-week training camp in Dubai ahead of the 2008 African Cup of Nations.

<text>Dweebs is an American sitcom that ran on CBS from September 22 to November 3, 1995. It failed to find an audience and was cancelled after 7 episodes, leaving 3 unaired.

==Synopsis==
The show stars Farrah Forke as Carey, a technophobic woman hired to be the office manager of a highly successful software company named Cyberbyte, owned by Warren Mosbey (Peter Scolari). Warren and the other employees (played by actors Stephen Tobolowsky, David Kaufman, Corey Feldman and Adam Biesk), were stereotypical nerds or &quot;dweebs&quot;, highly intelligent yet socially inept, contrasting with the character of Carey. Holly Fulger also co-starred as Carey&#x27;s friend, Noreen.

== Air dates and cancellation ==
Ten episodes were produced but only seven aired in the US between 22 September and 3 November 1995. All 10 episodes aired the following year on Channel 4 in the UK from 29 June to 31 August 1996.

Farrah Forke was fresh off her role as Alex Lambert on &quot;Wings&quot;. She and Stephen Tobolowksy would both appear together again the following year as part of the main cast of the sitcom, &quot;Mr. Rhodes&quot;, which was co-created by &quot;Dweebs&quot; creator Peter Noah. It ran for almost twice as many episodes but would also be canceled after only one season.

== Reception and similarities to later shows ==
The show gained a mixed reception from critics at the time. &quot;Variety&quot; felt the show had a future if the kinks were worked out.

Back in 1995, a sitcom about social outcasts in the tech industry was an original idea, and would later be successfully used in shows like &quot;The IT Crowd, The Big Bang Theory&quot;, and &quot;Silicon Valley&quot;. An article in &quot;Vulture&quot; also compared the show to &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; and &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; and called it a trailblazer, saying that the show was &quot;quite possibly the first American sitcom to focus its attention on the tech world and the integration of computers into daily life&quot; and was &quot;practically avant garde for its time&quot;, due to the fact that it &quot;existed at a time when a substantial portion of America, but by no means a majority (or even close), was computer-savvy&quot;.

<doc id="1328854" wikidata="Q147089" url="?curid=1328854" title="Manisa">
<text>Manisa () is a city in Turkey&#x27;s Aegean Region and the administrative seat of Manisa Province, lying approximately 40 km northeast of the major city of İzmir. The city forms the urban part of the districts Şehzadeler and Yunusemre, with a population of 385,452 in 2022.

Modern Manisa is a booming center of industry and services, advantaged by its closeness to the international port city and the regional metropolitan center of İzmir and by its fertile hinterland rich in quantity and variety of agricultural production. In fact, İzmir&#x27;s proximity also adds a particular dimension to all aspects of life&#x27;s pace in Manisa in the form of a dense traffic of daily commuters between the two cities, separated as they are by a half-hour drive served by a fine six-lane highway nevertheless requiring attention at all times due to its curves and the rapid ascent (sea-level to more than 500 meters at Sabuncubeli Pass) across Mount Sipylus&#x27;s mythic scenery.

The historic part of Manisa spreads out from a forested valley in the immediate slopes of Sipylus mountainside, along Çaybaşı Stream which flows next to Niobe&#x27;s &quot;Weeping Rock&quot; (&quot;Ağlayan Kaya&quot;), an ancient bridge called the &quot;Red Bridge&quot; (&quot;Kırmızı Köprü&quot;) as well as to several tombs-shrines in the Turkish style dating back to the Saruhan period (14th century). Under Ottoman rule in the centuries that followed, the city had already extended into the undulated terrain at the start of the plain. In the last couple of decades, Manisa&#x27;s width more than tripled in size across its vast plain formed by the alluvial deposits of the River Gediz, a development in which the construction of new block apartments, industrial zones and of Celal Bayar University campus played a key role.

The city of Manisa is also widely visited, especially during March and September festivals, the former festival being the continuation of a five-hundred-year-old &quot;Mesir Paste Distribution&quot; tradition, and also for the nearby Mount Spil national park. It is also a departure point for other visitor attractions of international acclaim which are located nearby within Manisa&#x27;s depending region, such as Sardes and Alaşehir (ancient Philadelphia) inland. The city also had a Jewish community.

==Name and etymology==
Historically, the city was also called &quot;Magnesia&quot;, and more precisely as Magnesia ad Sipylum, to distinguish it from Magnesia on the Maeander at a relatively short distance to the south. Traditional view held that the name &quot;Magnesia&quot; is derived from the tribe of Magnetes who would have immigrated here from Thessaly at the dawn of the region&#x27;s recorded history. A connection with native Anatolian languages has also been suggested, particularly on the basis of discoveries made in the Hittite archives. The name is rendered as Μαγνησία in ancient and modern Greek language.

The name &quot;Magnesia ad Sipylus&quot; refers to Mount Sipylus (Mount Spil) that towers over the city and Magnesia became a city of importance starting with the Roman dominion, particularly after the 190 BC Battle of Magnesia. The names &quot;Sipylus&quot; or &quot;Sipylum&quot; in reference to a settlement here are also encountered in some sources, again in reference to the mountain and as abbreviated forms. Pliny the Elder, supported by other sources, mentions that formerly in the same place was a very celebrated city which was called &quot;Tantalis&quot; or &quot;the city of Tantalus&quot; whose ruins were still visible around his time.

Under Turkish rule, the name attached to the Beys of &quot;Saruhan&quot;, who founded the Beylik which preceded the Ottomans in the region, has been officially used, along with the name Manisa, for the city and the region alternatively and this until the present period of the Republic of Turkey. The Ottoman Turkish form of the name &quot;Manisa&quot; (ماغنيسا) was usually as it is still used presently, but a spelling with a longer first syllable, transcribed to modern Turkish as &quot;Mağnisa&quot;, was also occasionally encountered. During the first centuries of the Ottoman Empire, many of the sons of sultans received their education in Manisa and the city is still commonly known in Turkey as &quot;the city of shahzades&quot; (&quot;Şehzadeler şehri&quot;), a distinctive title it shares only with Amasya and Trabzon.

The English language root word &quot;magnesia&quot;, from which the words &quot;magnet&quot; and &quot;magnetism&quot; and numerous other derivations were coined, as well as their equivalents in many other languages, may derive from the city&#x27;s name.

== History ==
=== Prehistory ===
Traces of prehistory in the Manisa region, although few in number, nevertheless include two very interesting finds that shed much light on western Anatolia&#x27;s past. The first are the fossilized footprints, numbering more than fifty and dated to around 20.000-25.000 BC, discovered in 1969 by MTA, Turkey&#x27;s state body for mineral exploration, in Sindel village near Manisa&#x27;s depending district of Salihli and referred to under that village&#x27;s name. Some of these footprints are on display today in Manisa Museum while their site of origin of Sindel, where there are also prehistoric paintings, will reportedly become Turkey&#x27;s first geopark through a joint project with the European Commission.

===Early Bronze===
The second finds are tombs contemporaneous with Troy II (3000-2500 BC) and found in the village of Yortan near Kırkağaç district center, north of Manisa. Original burial practices observed in these sepulchres led scholars to the definition of a &quot;Yortan culture&quot; in Anatolia&#x27;s prehistory, many of whose aspects remain yet to be explored.

=== Luwians, Hittites, Phrygians and Lydians ===
Central and southern parts of western Anatolia entered history with the still obscure Luwian kingdom of Arzawa, probably offshoots, as well as neighbors and, after around 1320 BCE, vassals of the Hittite Empire. Cybele monument located at Akpınar on the northern flank of Mount Sipylus, at a distance of from Manisa on the road to Turgutlu is, along with the King of Mira rock relief at Mount Nif near Kemalpaşa and a number of cuneiform tablet records are among the principal evidence of extension of Hittite control and influence in western Anatolia based on local principalities. Cybele monument by itself represents a step of innovation in Hittite art where full-faced figures in high relief are rare. 
The first millennium BC saw the emergence in the region of &quot;Phrygians&quot; and &quot;Maeonians&quot;, the accounts concerning which are still blended with myths, and finally of Lydians. Such semi-legendary figures like the local ruler Tantalus, his son Pelops, his daughter Niobe, the departure of a sizable part of the region&#x27;s population from their shores to found, according to one account, the future Etruscan civilization in present-day Italy, are all centered around Mount Sipylus, where the first urban settlement was probably located, and date from the period prior to the emergence of the Lydian Mermnad dynasty. It has also been suggested that the mountain could be the geographical setting for Baucis and Philemon tale as well, while most sources still usually associate it with Tyana (Hittite &quot;Tuwanuwa&quot;) in modern-day Kemerhisar near Niğde.

In the early 7th century BC, the Lydians under the newly established Mermnad dynasty, with the present-day Manisa region as their heartland expanded their control over a large part of Anatolia, ruling from their capital &quot;Sfard&quot; (&quot;Sard, Sardes, Sardis&quot;) situated more inland at a distance of from Manisa. The vestiges from their capital which reached our day bring together remains from several successive civilizations.

=== Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine periods ===

In classical antiquity, Romans knew the city as Magnesia ad Sipylum. There, in 190 BC, forces of the Roman Republic defeated the Seleucid king Antiochus the Great in the Battle of Magnesia. Magnesia ad Sipylum became a city of importance under Roman rule, and though nearly destroyed by an earthquake in the reign of Tiberius (Roman Emperor from 14 AD to 37 AD), was restored by that emperor and flourished through the period of the Roman empire.

In 1076 the Byzantine Empire lost the city to the Seljuks in the aftermath of the 1071 Battle of Manzikert.The subsequent Crusader victory at the Battle of Dorylaeum (1097) allowed the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I to recover Magnesia. It was an important regional centre under Byzantine rule, and during the 13th-century interlude of the Empire of Nicea of 1204 to 1261. Magnesia housed the Imperial mint, the Imperial treasury, and served as the functional capital of the Empire of Nicea until the recovery of Constantinople in 1261. Ruins of the Nicean-era fortifications attest to the city&#x27;s importance in the Late Byzantine period, a fact also noted by the Byzantine historian George Akropolites, writing in the 13th century.
=== Turkish era (Seljuk, Saruhan and early Ottoman periods) ===
In the early 14th century the region of Magnesia was subject to repeated raids by invading Turkish bands. The local population was unable to repulse the Turkish raids. Thus, after an unsuccessful defence led by the Byzantine Emperor most inhabitants fled to the Aegean coast and the European part of the Byzantine Empire. As a result of the Turkish invasion in the region and the destruction of the city the area was largely abandoned. In 1313, Manisa became a permanent Turkish possession when taken by the Beylik of Saruhan, led by the Bey of the same name who had started out as a tributary of the Seljuks and who reigned until 1346. His sons held the region until 1390, when the first incorporation of their lands into the expanding Ottoman state took place. After a brief interval caused by the Ottoman interregnum after the Battle of Ankara, Manisa and its surroundings definitely became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1410.

Even during the 15th century Manisa was recorded as being in complete ruins due to the previous Turkish raids. As the central town of the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s Saruhan sanjak, the city became the training ground for shahzades (&quot;crown princes&quot;), and it stood out as one of the wealthiest parts of the Empire with many examples of Ottoman architecture built. In a practice started by Murad II in 1437, fifteen members of the Ottoman dynasty, including two among the most notable, namely Mehmed II and Süleyman I, held the administration of the city and of its dependencies in seventeen near-continuous periods until 1595. Although the sanjak of Saruhan officially depended on the eyalet of Anadolu with its seat in Kütahya, a large degree of autonomy was left to the princes for them to acquire the experience of government. This practice was discontinued in 1595, largely due to the growing insecurity in the countryside, precursor of Jelali Revolts, and a violent earthquake dealt a severe blow to the Manisa region&#x27;s prosperity the same year. 

Around 1700, Manisa counted about 2,000 taxpayers and 300 pious foundations (&quot;vakıf&quot;) shops, was renowned for its cotton markets and a type of leather named after the city. Large parts of the population had begun settling and becoming sedentary and the city was a point of terminus for caravans from the east, with İzmir&#x27;s growth still in its early stages. But already during the preceding century, influent western merchants such as Orlando, often in pact with local warlords such as Cennetoğlu, a brigand (sometimes cited as one of the first in line in western Anatolia&#x27;s long tradition of efes to come) who in the 1620s had assembled a vast company of disbanded Ottoman soldiers and renegades and established control over much of the fertile land around Manisa, had triggered a movement of more commercially sensitive Greek and Jewish populations towards the port city.

=== Late-Ottoman Manisa ===

Between 1595 and 1836, the sanjak of Saruhan (Manisa) remained attached to the Eyalet of Anadolu, as in the time of the Ottoman crown princes. Between 1836 and 1867 the city and its depending region was made part of the short-lived Eyalet of Aydın, which became a vilayet with the administrative reforms of 1867. During this phase, Saruhan (Manisa) even had an eyalet of its own under its name as the &quot;Eyalet of Saruhan&quot; between the even shorter period 1845–1847. The seat of the province to which Saruhan sanjak depended was the city of Aydın (1827–1841 and 1843–1846) at first, and was later moved to Smyrna (1841–1843, 1846–1864).

Manisa was one of the first cities in the Ottoman Empire to benefit from the arrival of a railway line, with the Smyrna Cassaba Railway, whose construction was started from Smyrna in 1863 and which reached its first terminus at Manisa&#x27;s depending Kasaba in 1866. This railway was the third started within the territory of the Ottoman Empire at the time and the first finished within the present-day territory of Turkey. Instead of being laid along the direct route eastwards from Smyrna to Kasaba, about fifty kilometers in length, the line built drew a wide arc advancing first to the north-west from İzmir, through its Karşıyaka suburb to whose foundation it contributed greatly, and curves eastwards only from Menemen on, crossing the former sanjak and the present-day province center of Manisa to join Kasaba (now Turgutlu) from the north. The first concession under the name was granted to a locally based English entrepreneur named Edward Price, who founded the company and built the line. This railway was extended further east by the same company between 1872 and 1875 to reach Alaşehir at a distance of from Kasaba and a connection northwards starting from Manisa itself was built between 1888 and 1890 to reach the lignite-rich Soma, another dependency of Manisa, through a line. Price sold the whole network in 1893 to the Franco-Belgian group Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits, which extended it further east to Afyonkarahisar in 1896 and further north to Bandırma in 1912. The line was nationalized in 1934 by the young Republic of Turkey in the frame of a general move started in the 1920s regarding Turkey&#x27;s railways.

=== 20th century ===

After the Young Turk revolution (1908) the local Greek community was subject to wide scale boycott, as noted by the local British ambassador. Manisa was temporarily occupied by the Greek Army on May 26, 1919, during the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922), before finally being recaptured by the Turkish Army on September 8, 1922. The retreating Greek Army burned the city. Over ninety percent of Manisa was destroyed by the retreating Greek Army as part of the scorched-earth policy. James Loder Park, the U.S. Vice-Consul in Constantinople at the time, who toured much of the devastated area immediately after the Greek evacuation, described the situation in the surrounding cities and towns of Smyrna he has seen, as follows:
&quot;Magnesia...almost completely wiped out by fire...10,300 houses, 15 mosques, 2 baths, 2,278 shops, 19 hotels, 26 villas...[destroyed].&quot; Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross wrote: &quot;Out of the eighteen thousand buildings in the historic holy city of Manisa, only five hundred remained.&quot;

Manisa was rebuilt and became the centre of Saruhan Province in 1923 under the new Turkish Republic. The province&#x27;s name was changed to Manisa, as was the city itself, in 1927.

== Climate ==
Manisa has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csa&quot;, Trewartha climate classification: &quot;Cs&quot;) with hot, dry summers and short, cool but wet winters. Summers in Manisa are hotter than its western neighbour İzmir, while winters are colder due to its inland location. Snowfall, while fairly uncommon, does accumulate most winters, with a record snow depth of 44 cm in January 1945.

Records began in 1930. The record high temperature was on 25 July 2007, while the record low temperature was on 4 January 1942.

==Cuisine==
The cuisine of Manisa is known for several types of kebabs. Manisa Kebab is a type of shish kebab prepared with a combination of minced beef and lamb. It is served on chopped up pita and with grilled tomato and peppers, and onion salad. Lastly, melted butter and sumac is added on top. It may also be served with yogurt.
==Health==
Air pollution is a chronic problem here.

== Architectural landmarks ==
The 16th century Sultan Mosque was built for Ayşe Hafsa Sultan, Süleyman the Magnificent&#x27;s mother. In her honor, Mesir Festival (featuring the &quot;Mesir Paste&quot; (), a spiced paste in the form of candy, and claimed to restore health, youth and potency, is held every year in March, in the grounds of this mosque, and is an occasion for public gathering as well as attendance by personalities of fame and prominence at national scale.

The mosque is part of a large külliye - a religious complex - among whose buildings the hospital &quot;darüşşifa&quot; is particularly notable. Specialized in mental diseases, the medical center was in activity until the beginning of the 20th century when new buildings were built within the same compound. That Turkey&#x27;s only two institutions specialized on mental health were until recently located in İstanbul district of Bakırköy and in Manisa gave way in Turkey&#x27;s public lore to gentle innuendos on the challenging spirit of the natives - &quot;Manisalı&quot;.

One such likeable eccentric of the 20th century was Ahmet Bedevi, the Tarzan of Manisa or &quot;Manisa Tarzanı&quot;, a figure who became a symbol for the city by contributing to raising consciousness for protection of the environment across Turkey and a reference especially since the 1960s when an important reforestation effort covering thousands of hectares was made in and around Manisa.

The Muradiye Mosque of the 16th century was built by the great architect Mimar Sinan (and completed by Sedefkar Mehmed Agha), and the &#x27;Murad Bey Medresse now houses the Archaeological Museum of Manisa.

Manisa celebrates the Vintage Festival every September, when the fruits of the vineyards are celebrated. The vineyards surround the city and provide dry fruit for export from İzmir, and grapes for wine making.

== Modern Manisa ==
Manisa and some of its depending district centers have succeeded in solidly clinching an industrial production base in recent decades, in this supported both initially and continuously by the century-old wide-scale agricultural processing and related activities (production of flour and olive oil, basic textiles, leather goods, agricultural tools and instruments, cotton ginning). Olive, walnut and almond cultivation are among the important agricultural activities of Manisa.

According to the figures published by the Governorship, 694 companies in Manisa Province out of the province&#x27;s total number of companies of 5,502 for 2007 are certified industrial enterprises and these employ a total of 44,449 people. Within the 694, Manisa center is in the lead with 238 enterprises engaged in industrial production, with the depending centers of Turgutlu (125 industrial enterprises), Akhisar (100), Salihli (78) closely contending, and Saruhanlı (33), Alaşehir (30), Kula (28), Demirci (20) and Soma (17) following.

Among leading industrial activities Manisa companies are engaged in are production of foodstuffs (&quot;196 companies&quot;), building materials (&quot;114&quot;), metal goods (&quot;85&quot;), as well as textile industry and clothing industry (&quot;46&quot;) and cotton ginning (&quot;43&quot;). The highest numbers of workforce are concentrated in electronics/electrical appliances, foodstuffs and construction industries.

The choice of Manisa as production base in the 1980s by the Turkish consumer electronics and white goods giant Vestel was an important boost for the present-day level of sophistication. Today Manisa&#x27;s economic activities are far from being confined to a sole company. Manisa registered roughly 200m US dollars in FDI in 2004 and well-known businesses such as Italian white goods company Indesit, German electrical goods company Bosch, UK packaging company Rexam and Imperial Tobacco of the UK have invested in Manisa.

In 2004/2005 Manisa was chosen among 200 contestants as the Most Cost-Effective European city by the FDi magazine&#x27;s yearly round of votes to determine European Cities and Regions of the Future, its extremely low office and industrial rents and competitive labor costs having been particularly noted. Again for 2006/2007, Manisa was named among 89 European cities as the winner of the category of the Best Economic Potential in Europe, as runner-up for the categories Southern-Europe&#x27;s City of the Future (winner for Turkey) and the Most Cost-Effective European city.

The city also has a football team, Manisaspor, which plays in the Süper Lig under the home colors of red and white and away colors of black and white. Manisaspor&#x27;s home ground is the Manisa 19 Mayis Stadi.

Mount Sipylus National Park (&quot;Spil Dağı Milli Parkı&quot;) near the city of Manisa embraces a richly forested area, hot springs, the famous &quot;crying rock&quot; of Niobe, and a Hittite carving of the mother-goddess Cybele. The park boasts about 120 varieties of native plants within its boundaries, especially wild tulips. The park provides opportunities for mountaineering and camping.

Sardis, in the present-day municipality of Salihli, was the ancient capital of Lydia, once ruled by King Croesus, who was renowned for his wealth. Due to numerous earthquakes, most of the visible remains date back only to Roman times. There are the remains of the temple of Artemis and a restored gymnasium, exhibiting of the past splendor of this ancient city. The splendid synagogue from the 3rd century is worth visiting, with its elaborate mosaics and artfully carved colored-stone panels.

Akhisar, the ancient city of Thyatira, was one of the Seven Churches of the Book of Revelation and the remains of the ancient city is found in part of the city called &quot;Tepe Mezarlığı&quot; (hill cemetery). More recently, it has become an important commercial center in the province and is its second largest after Manisa.

The city of Alaşehir is where the remains of the ancient city of Philadelphia, another of the Seven Churches, is found. There is little left of the ancient city, except some ruins of a Byzantine church.

St. Jean Rum Ortodoks Kilisesi, a now destroyed church in Şehzadeler.

The villages of Mount Yunt (Yunt Dağı) and the towns of Gördes, Kula and Demirci are known for their carpets and kilims. The houses in Kula are also local examples of Ottoman architecture.

In addition, there are many thermal springs throughout the area.

The province is highly developed in terms of industrial activities, which are concentrated in the largest four centers of Manisa, Turgutlu, Akhisar and Salihli.

<text>Casa Alianza is an international non-profit organization and the Latin American branch of Covenant House. It is a non-governmental organization (NGO) providing shelter, food, immediate crisis care, and an array of other services to homeless and runaway youth.

== History ==
Casa Alianza was founded in Latin America in 1981 in response to the rampant human rights abuses taking place throughout the region. Casa Alianza was founded by the U.S.-based organization Covenant House, with the first site being founded in Guatemala. Covenant House proceeded to found Casa Alianza Honduras in 1987, Casa Alianza Mexico in 1988, and Casa Alianza Nicaragua in 1998 In addition to Casa Alianza&#x27;s operations in direct support of children, the organization also has founded three separate fundraising and advocacy branches in Germany and the U.K. In Switzerland, Casa Alianza Switzerland, an independent association under Swiss law, was founded in 1997 to support Casa Alianza programs in Latin America. The organization&#x27;s international headquarters remains in New York City and is led by Kevin M. Ryan, the former commissioner of New Jersey&#x27;s Department of Children and Families (see Kevin Ryan (charity executive)). Including the work of Casa Alianza, Covenant House now serves 71,000 children throughout the Americas each year. &quot;Casa Alianza&quot; is the Spanish translation of &quot;Covenant House&quot;.

== Awards ==
In 1996, Casa Alianza in Latin America received the Swedish Olof Palme Prize for an &quot;outstanding achievement in the spirit of Olof Palme&quot;. The prize was conferred for the organization&#x27;s &quot;dedicated work to help street children in Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico&quot; and &quot;for the courageous defence of the rights of these children&quot; and was awarded by &quot;Andrée Ruffo and Pierre Dionne, the President and Director General respectively&quot;.

In 1999, Casa Alianza in Latin America received the International Award for Children&#x27;s Rights from the International Bureau for Children&#x27;s Rights in Montreal, Canada.

In 2000, Casa Alianza received the Conrad N. Hilton Humanitarian Prize, which is claimed to be the &quot;largest humanitarian award in the world&quot;. Though the award now comes with a US$1.5 million prize, Casa Alianza received $US 1.0 million in 2000, which apparently was designated for the building of the Hilton Home (&quot;Hogar Conrad N. Hilton&quot;) with a capacity of 94 beds. The award was presented by Queen Noor of Jordan.

In 2002, Casa Alianza in Guatemala received the Jorge Angel Livraga Award for its work with street children.

In 2006, Casa Alianza in Guatemala received the Order of the Quetzal award, which is the highest award that the Guatemalan government bestows upon those doing humanitarian work in Guatemala.

In 2007, on 19 September, Casa Alianza in Guatemala received the Reina Sofia Award for its drug addiction program serving street children.

== Honduras ==

Casa Alianza Honduras was co-founded by Jose Manuel Capellin, and works with children from 12–18 years old. The Honduras branch of Casa Alianza, much like the others through Latin America, focuses on services ranging from street outreach to residential care to family reintegration and preparation for independent life. Casa Alianza Honduras is perhaps best known for its continual push to bring to light the extrajudicial killings of children and young people. In addition, the 2008 Human Rights Report published by the U.S. Department of State cites Casa Alianza as providing nearly half of all beds available for displaced and homeless youth in the country.

== Guatemala ==
On 16 January 2009, Casa Alianza Guatemala declared a financial crisis, ceased operations, and shut down. Prior to closing, Casa Alianza Guatemala was the largest service provider to homeless youth in Guatemala, serving nearly 150 children each night in its residential program and having one of the region&#x27;s strongest legal support programs for disenfranchised youth. It appears, however, that Covenant House has sponsored a new organization in Guatemala, Asociacion La Alianza, which is in the process of relaunching activities based out of Casa Alianza Guatemala&#x27;s former facilities. The primary activities of the new organization seem to be focused on fighting the crime of human trafficking via victim protection (residential program).

== Mexico ==
Casa Alianza Mexico was founded in 1988 by Covenant House. The organization serves children from 12 to 18 years of age and comprises six separate homes. The Cenzontle Home phase 1 and 2 home is for newly arrived boys, while the Cenzontle Home phase 3 home is for young men with a longer time in the program. The Quetzal Homes follow a similar structure, with 3 separate homes (phases 1, 2 and 3) that serve a range from newly arrived to long-term stay girls and young women. The SEDAC/Hogar Palomas serves young mothers with their babies up to the age of 24.

== Nicaragua ==

Founded in January 1998, Casa Alianza Nicaragua proceeded from a long history of support from Nicaragua&#x27;s first two freely elected presidents. Both Violeta Chamorro and Arnoldo Aleman publicly expressed support for bringing Casa Alianza to Nicaragua, and ultimately Covenant House moved for its foundation. Following its foundation in January 1998, August of the same year saw the opening of a residential program for 26 boys and 8 girls coming off the streets. Although Casa Alianza Nicaragua&#x27;s age range was 14–18 in its early existence, it quickly moved to a range of approximately 10–20 in response to the nation&#x27;s need. In 2001, Casa Alianza Nicaragua opened a young mothers program for 15 mothers and their babies as well as a separate residence for 25 formerly homeless young girls. In 2003, the Conrad N. Hilton Home in Managua was completed and formally dedicated with the help of a US$1.0 million prize stemming from the Conrad N. Hilton Humanitarian Award. The home would house 94 beds for formerly homeless young boys and girls.

Casa Alianza Nicaragua participated in the 2010 Street Child World Cup in Durban, South Africa, placing in a tie for 3rd with the United Kingdom.

== José Manuel Capellín ==
Having served at one time or another as National Director of Casa Alianza in each of its four countries, as well as 20 years as the National Director of Casa Alianza Honduras, José Manuel (&quot;Menin&quot;) Capellín is perhaps the most consistent, well-known and well-respected figure of Casa Alianza&#x27;s 29-year history in Latin America. The Spaniard was recently recognized as one of 13 Modern Heroes in the Fight Against Human Trafficking, an honor bestowed by the U.S. Department of State in its annual Trafficking in Persons Report. Menin retired from the post as National Director of Casa Alianza Honduras in 2012.

<text>Amir-Abbas Hoveyda (; 18 February 1919 – 7 April 1979) was an Iranian economist and politician who served as Prime Minister of Iran from 27 January 1965 to 7 August 1977. He was the longest serving prime minister in Iran&#x27;s history. He also served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance in Mansur&#x27;s cabinet. After the Iranian Revolution, he was tried by the newly established Revolutionary Court for &quot;waging war against God&quot; and spreading corruption on earth (&quot;Mofsed-e-filarz&quot;) and executed.

==Early life and education==

Born in Tehran in 1919 to Habibollah Hoveyda (Ayn ol-Molk), a seasoned diplomat, who was mostly active during the latter years of the Qajar dynasty, and Afsar ol-Moluk, a descendant of the royal family that Hoveyda would serve for much of his adult life. Hoveyda&#x27;s father was a lapsed adherent of the Baháʼí Faith and Hoveyda himself was not religious. He was the nephew of Abdol Hossein Sardari, also known as &quot;Schindler of Iran&quot;. Because of the responsibilities borne by diplomats such as Ayn ol-Molk, the Hoveyda family was never fixed in one residence for any prolonged length of time. Studying in various countries gave Hoveyda a unique cosmopolitan flair that would remain his most enduring characteristic. During the family&#x27;s stay in Beirut, Lebanon, Hoveyda attended Lycée Français, an institution affiliated with the French government. His love for France and its culture were rooted in his tutelage at the lycée. French literary works by the likes of André Gide, André Malraux, Molière, and Baudelaire, captivated the young Hoveyda and gave way for his intellectual growth. Some pundits suggest that it was Hoveyda&#x27;s intellectual prowess which initially attracted him into the Shah&#x27;s folds.

Hoveyda&#x27;s desire to attend a French university in 1938 made the young student jump the gun by entering the country of his dreams without completing specific high school prerequisites required for entry. Cited as being the main reason behind Hoveyda&#x27;s organizational miscalculation was the possibility of military action by an ostensibly belligerent Nazi Germany. Any future occupation of the country would have hindered his chances of attending a French university. Stranded in France, Hoveyda decided to complete the required high school credits in London, England, a city that would come to depress the young man. Aside from completing his educational requisites, Hoveyda was able to sharpen his command of the English language. His ability to communicate in several languages, including Persian, French, English, Italian, German, and Arabic, helped him climb the political ladder later on in life. Hoveyda&#x27;s return to France in 1939 would be short lived, nevertheless, due to a brewing diplomatic scuffle between the French government and Reza Shah Pahlavi. Having no choice but to leave France again, Hoveyda enrolled at the Free University of Brussels in Brussels, Belgium, during the same year. His stay at the university would be markedly ephemeral because of the effects of the German Blitzkrieg which used Belgian territory as an entry route into France. After being displaced for a short time, Hoveyda was able to return to the Belgian university, obtaining a bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science in 1941, under the ever-watchful eye of the occupying German administration.

==Military and public service==
Upon his return to Iran in 1942, Hoveyda rested for a few months before enlisting as a soldier in Iran&#x27;s national army. His plan at the time was to use his experience as a conscript to supplement his seniority at the foreign ministry where he applied for employment prior to being drafted. Because of his higher education, Hoveyda was able to bypass boot camp and directly enter the Officer&#x27;s Academy. Iran&#x27;s modern Prime Ministers, until that point, were able to avoid military service, but Hoveida voluntarily chose to enlist. Although rooted in aristocracy himself, Hoveyda&#x27;s decision is portentous in the sense that resources that were readily available for his predecessors were often scarce for the young government official.
The Foreign Ministry dispatched a message eight months later confirming Hoveyda&#x27;s appointment. To some, the quick application process is evidence enough to suggest that there were influential forces that helped expedite Hoveyda&#x27;s subsequent employment. These claims, however, are often based on hearsay rather than substantiated facts. During his time in the Ministry, Hoveyda befriended many elements of Iranian high society, including the likes of Sadeq Hedayat and Sadeq Chubak. His affinity for the country&#x27;s intelligentsia is clearly observed in his earlier strategy as PM. By trying to consolidate the partnership between the monarchial regime and the intellectual opposition, Hoveyda believed that the incremental reforms he desired would bear fruit. Others like Jalal al-e Ahmad, writer and social and political critic, saw Hoveyda&#x27;s &#x27;infiltration&#x27; of Iran&#x27;s intellectual ranks as a form of sycophancy. On the other hand, Hedayat and other eccentric characters were quick to identify and repel opportunists who were attempting to leech off their social status. Hedayat and others never distanced themselves from Hoveyda, symbolizing the latter&#x27;s authenticity.

As Hoveyda garnered more experience, opportunities within Iran&#x27;s governmental apparatus were becoming available to him. In August 1944, for instance, he accepted a position to accompany Zein ol-Abedin Rahnema, Iran&#x27;s minister plenipotentiary, to France. Being an avid Francophile, Hoveyda would enjoy his time as an embassy official, but he would soon be entangled in an international scandal that would taint him for the rest of his life. The &quot;Paris Story&quot; recounts the illegal importation of financial assets, stored in Swiss banks during the war for security purposes, from Switzerland into the coffers of wealthy French businessmen in 1945. To avoid border taxes, diplomatic personnel were persuaded to act as the intermediary, simply because embassy vehicles were, by law, unable to be searched. Although Hoveida never had anything to do with the illegal transfers, his mere association with some of those indicted was enough for him to be used as a scapegoat in the affair.

Aside from experience, patronage from the likes of Abdullah Entezam, an independent minded diplomat of &quot;sterling reputation&quot;, served to aid Hoveida&#x27;s ascendance to the upper echelons of public office. With the government of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, the Shah (king) of Iran, the only way to obtain high ranking positions in any societal position was through crucial internal patronage, reinforcement Hoveyda sufficiently lacked prior to working with Entezam. The two first got to work together when Hoveyda was stationed in Stuttgart, West Germany. While there in 1947, Hoveyda was assigned with the task of negotiating over deals made between Iran and Germany. The most notable case involved Iran&#x27;s purchase of factory equipment required for the construction of a steel mill, in which the transaction of the material components were never successfully completed.

In 1950, Hoveyda returned to an ever-changing Iran once again. This time, he would be caught in one of the most tumultuous periods of Iran&#x27;s modern period. As Hoveyda toiled away at a notably boring job as assistant director of the public relations office at the Foreign Ministry, Mohammad Mossadegh was mobilizing nationalist sentiment as he rose to power. During this period, Entezam was appointed as minister of foreign affairs, allowing Hoveyda to assume a more intellectually stimulating role as Entezam&#x27;s executive secretary. His tenure did not last long before Mossadegh was appointed Prime Minister, dissolving the former cabinet along with Hoveyda&#x27;s job.

Leaving Iran once again in 1952, Hoveyda was able to secure a position with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees through the help of his European contacts. As a liaison officer, he was given the task of visiting various continents, including Asia, Africa, and the Americas, promulgating the plight of refugees and in effect receiving several commendations from high ranking UN officials.

The Iranian embassy in Turkey would serve to be Hoveyda&#x27;s final official position outside Iran&#x27;s frontiers. Assistant to the ambassador, who so happened to be the father of his good friend, Hassan-Ali Mansour, Hoveyda would make a quick exit after Mansour&#x27;s father was replaced by an authoritarian army general in 1957.

==Rise to power==

Hoveyda&#x27;s rise to power involved many years of service within the ministry of foreign affairs, but this path took on a whole new approach once he joined the board of directors of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) in 1958 at the behest of his patron Abdullah Entezam, who had by then assumed a high ranking position at the company. As managing director and special assistant to Entezam, Hoveyda used his experiences in the West to transform management-worker relations. As an example, he introduced innovative methods by which workers filed grievances in regard to any aspect of the working environment they deemed unsatisfactory, and helped to figuratively enmesh the roles of management and the labourers into a collective entity. One way he went about doing this was by eating many of his meals alongside wage labourers in the cafeteria. Although he advocated the emulation of Western models to improve overall productivity and worker relations, Hoveyda was very outspoken in favour of expelling foreign technicians and attracting indigenous sources of labour. It was during his tenure in which the NIOC&#x27;s periodical, &quot;Kavosh&quot; (Persian: &quot;Exploration&quot;), was first published. What is unique about this magazine is that it was, initially, virtually void of any semblance of the growing cult of personality which surrounded the Shah.

Continuing his duties as managing director at the NIOC, Hoveyda also helped Hassan Ali Mansour in establishing a semi-independent group of highly trained, Western educated, and young technocrats. The organization&#x27;s main goal was to devise methods of rectifying the nation&#x27;s ailing economy. Known as the Progressive Circle, this government sponsored dowreh (&quot;Persian for a gathering held at regular intervals&quot;) was a deliberate attempt by the shah to thin out the older generation of politicians with a new &#x27;progressive&#x27; crop. With its inception in 1959, the Circle acted in conjunction with a similar government commission called the Plan Organization. Hoveyda would play a major leadership role in the Circle and would be the catalyst behind much of its recruitment efforts.

Besides experience and patronage, Freemasonry was seen by many politicians at the time as a supplemental credit towards obtaining high ranking government positions. It is no doubt that many members of the Foroughi Lodge, the chapter Hoveyda would eventually join, harboured and produced many influential politicians of Iran&#x27;s modern era. Hoveyda became a freemason in 1960 believing that his mere association with the organization would help propel him into the national spotlight. Hoveida would succeed in this regard, but the attention he received was all but positive. Freemasonry in Iran has always been seen as an extension of British imperialism, and with rumours surrounding Hoveyda&#x27;s religious persuasion, opportunities to attack Hoveyda&#x27;s character were not taken for granted by his political adversaries during his years as head of foreign policy and Prime Minister. It is well documented that Court Minister Asadollah Alam and General Nasiri of SAVAK, Iran&#x27;s domestic security and intelligence service, helped expedite the publication of key controversial books against Freemasonry, referencing Hoveyda in each piece. Rumours were also spread by his detractors that he was a Baháʼí, a persecuted religion in Iran, but both he and the Shah denied that he was a Baháʼí.

==Term as Prime Minister==
When the Progressive Circle soon became a political entity in the form of the Iran Novin (New Iran) Party in 1963, Hoveyda would be thrust into the national scene. Flanking Prime Minister Hassan Ali Mansour as his Minister of Finance in 1964, the now well seasoned Hoveyda would make his mark by acting as the cabinet&#x27;s intellectual centre. Many observers, both within and outside Iran, would take note of Hoveyda&#x27;s prudent behaviour and shrewdness. To many, he embodied the archetypical statesman. Hoveyda&#x27;s positive attributes would again be shrouded by scandal and gossip. During the early months of Mansour&#x27;s premiership, the government was attacked for ratifying a bill which allowed foreigners extraterritorial rights. More specifically, those who benefited from the law were U.S. military personnel and their dependents. These &quot;capitulation rights&quot; would have a negative impact on the way government at the time was seen by the populace. Because the actions of the government were, by law, reflective of the sitting cabinet at the time, disregarding individual ministerial involvement, Hoveida was also blamed for the bill&#x27;s implementation even though he was not directly involved in its drafting.

An attempt on Mansour&#x27;s life on 21 January 1965, by a seventeen-year-old devotee of the Fada&#x27;yan-e Islam, and Mansour&#x27;s death in hospital five days later, would completely alter Hoveyda&#x27;s future. As he personally reported the news to an obviously distraught shah, he was ordered to formulate a cabinet. Hoveyda would replace the deceased Mansour as the longest running premier in Iran&#x27;s modern history. The sense of autonomy seen among past prime ministers such as Ali Amini, Haj Ali Razmara, and Mohammad Mosaddegh, had been systematically marginalized by the autocratic Mohammad Reza Shah. In his rather successful campaign at consolidating power, the king maintained his international image as a constitutional monarch, but Hoveida&#x27;s tenure as PM attests to how this portrayal was not an objective reflection of circumstances. Hoveyda&#x27;s premiership would be the pivot behind his resistance to such powerlessness. Hoveyda became a household name in Iran through the constant character assassination he received by &quot;Towfigh Magazine&quot;, Iran&#x27;s most popular political satire magazine. Hoveyda was largely unknown among the population of Iran before &quot;Towfigh&quot; publicized him. He was caricatured in &quot;Towfigh&quot;″s weekly magazine carrying a cane (caused by a traffic accident in which he was involved), wearing one carnation in his suit jacket pocket, and smoking a pipe. &quot;Towfigh Magazine&quot; referred to him as &quot;The Caned One&quot; and even devoted an entire book dedicated to exposing his flaws as a premier entitled &quot;Assa-Nameh&quot;. The magazine (and Iranian media in general) frequently criticized and lampooned Hoveyda, primarily because they intended to criticize the Shah himself, but were unable to directly do so due to censorship. Eventually Hoveyda, by order of the Shah, forever shut down &quot;Towfigh Magazine&quot; in 1971 due to Towfigh Magazine&#x27;s heavy criticism of the Shah&#x27;s corruption and policies. This was despite the fact that Hoveyda publicly claimed that criticism of the government was to be encouraged, and whereby any restriction of press freedoms had to be by court order through the judiciary and not by unilateral orders of the government.

The first half of Hoveyda&#x27;s premiership is marked by a sense of optimism. As already mentioned, in 1966, Hoveyda attempted to allure many elements of the intellectual community, as well as the opposition, into an informal agreement with the regime. Although talks between the two sides eventually broke down, Hoveyda never lost sight of what a partnership between the two could have accomplished. His pragmatic approach to politics allowed him to envision an incremental reform process that can be carried out through action. This is contrary to the path assumed by many Iranian intellectuals at the time, which involved quixotic solutions to problems such as electoral corruption and media censorship. Hoveyda resumed many of the reform initiatives set out by the Mansour administration. In particular, reform plans that were laid out by the Shah in the White Revolution. Although a secularist, he would even allocate government revenue to the clerical establishment. The clerical establishment was seen as a bulwark against Communism by the Shah, and was constantly reinforced (a policy that the Shah would later regret).
Hoveyda&#x27;s plan to crack down on corruption became an example of the entrenched ineptitude of many in power. Many important members of the government were corrupt, and the Shah was consistently flattered and schmoozed by them and turned a blind eye to the problem. The Shah began receiving an increasingly distorted picture of Iranian society, while becoming completely blind to increasing frustration to this rule by regular Iranians, as well as the shortcomings of his own government. Hoveyda&#x27;s inability to move forward with his personal mandate eventually turned the overtly optimistic prime minister into a cynic. After years of political maneuvering, most of his proposed initiatives were stonewalled by bureaucratic obstacles. During the 1970s, the now veteran Prime Minister became nonchalant when it came to following through with his own convictions. His earlier aggression towards the dysfunctions of an obtrusive system slowly turned into feigned support. Publicly, Hoveyda assumed the notion that the regime in its current state would eventually reform on its own, and that political liberalization was only a small issue in the grand scheme of modernization. In private, Hoveyda often lamented over Iran&#x27;s conditions, admitting to insufficiencies of the state and his own political impotence. The powerlessness of the premier&#x27;s office was coupled with intricate internal rivalries. Hoveyda had an intensely rough relationship with the likes of Asadollah Alam and Ardeshir Zahedi, son of the famed participant in the 1953 coup against Mossadegh, General Fazlollah Zahedi.

==Minister of Court and final years==

On 2 March 1975, the shah dissolved the Iran Novin Party and its opposition elements in creating a single party system headed by the Rastakhiz (Resurgence/Resurrection) Party. In relation to Hoveyda, it is believed that the shah was being threatened by the growing influence wielded by party officials, Hoveyda being the most notable. The growth of an independent apparatus was contrary to the Shah&#x27;s contrivance involving the consolidation of all power. Hoveyda&#x27;s inability to garner any type of power base in government allowed him to concentrate much of his energy on developing the Iran Novin Party. The networks he had slowly developed over the years came to trouble the monarch. Although Hoveyda would be coerced into relinquishing his position as prime minister, he accepted a temporary intermediary role as secretary general of Rastakhiz before a new Prime Minister can be appointed. Nevertheless, the Shah still saw Hovedya as a trusted (if not pliable) figure, and he was appointed to be minister of court. In her memoirs, Queen Farah wrote that asking Hoveyda to leave the post of prime minister was as painful as &quot;giving birth to a baby&quot;.

Hoveida would serve as minister of court within Jamshid Amouzegar&#x27;s government in 1977. With this role, he would come to discover the pervasiveness of internal corruption, once concealed by Asadollah Alam and the team he had surrounded himself with. Nevertheless, he continued to tolerate the practice as well, while simultaneously remaining a trusted advisor to the Shah.

Hoveyda was alleged to have been the author of an article which attacked the opposition figure the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini as being a British agent and a liar, which was anyonymously published in &quot;Kayhan&quot; newspaper in January 1978 on the Shah&#x27;s orders. Whether or not the allegations were true, the article generated a major backlash among Khomeini&#x27;s supporters, which eventually spiralled into the Iranian Revolution.

At this point, the growing tide of revolution was becoming discernible, giving Hoveyda ample opportunity to leave the country before revolutionary forces could have had a chance to overthrow the monarchy. Aside from persistent efforts by family and friends to leave the country as quickly as possible, the Shah himself proposed Hoveida with an ambassadorial position to Belgium. His refusal to leave the country can be judged as being a result of naïveté or blind optimism, but Hoveida&#x27;s decision can also be assessed from alternate angles. For one, he did not want to abandon his mother who was incapable of traveling at the time. On a more personal level, Hoveyda came to the conclusion that after years of self-exile, he would do all he could to remain in Iran. With all these points of rationale being considered, Hoveida actually came to believe that revolutionary fervour was capable of being contained and that everything would eventually straighten out, allowing the country to resume its present course.

In an effort to slow down the momentum of the revolution, the Shah was advised by many of his surrounding advisors to arrest Hoveida, using him as a scapegoat for the past-ills of the crumbling regime. Since Hoveyda was widely seen as a major cause of the revolution due to much of the bad press he had generated throughout the years by newspapers that wanted to indirectly attack the Shah&#x27;s policies, they reasoned that the public would be appeased. In September, Hoveyda was forced to resign his position of Minister of Court. On 7 November 1978, Hoveyda was arrested together with other 60 former officials. He would be held under house arrest in an upper-Tehran residence often affiliated with SAVAK activity, and the Shah assumed that he would be put on trial, and freed after publicly vindicating himself.

However, once the Shah fled the country, the SAVAK (Iranian state security) agents assigned with the task of guarding Hoveyda, absconded from their posts, leaving Hoveida open to arrest by revolutionary forces. Hoveyda refused requests by friends and relatives to flee Iran before it was too late, and instead turned himself over to the new authorities. Hoveyda believed that as the trial would be before an Islamic court, and that he personally had done nothing wrong, he would be acquitted.

==Trial and execution==

Hoveyda was taken to the Refah School, a temporary headquarters for the revolution&#x27;s vanguard. Because of the departure of the Shah and much of the now former ruling class, Hoveyda had become the most prized prisoner of the old government. On 15 March 1979, he would face the newly established Revolutionary Court for the first time. During this time he attempted to create his legal arguments for the court. He was interviewed by Belgian journalist Christine Ockrent, a now infamous interview in which Hoveyda was subject to near accusatory questions by the interviewer.

The clerical judge appointed by Khomeini, Sadegh Khalkhali, would come to be known as the &#x27;Hanging Judge&#x27; for his violent approach to revolutionary justice. He was the head of the tribunal that had assembled to try the former prime minister. Prior to Hoveyda&#x27;s trial, Khalkhali had already ordered the execution of dozens, possibly hundreds of political prisoners, and would eventually be responsible for thousands of executions. Traditional conventions of the judiciary had all but been abandoned during the trials of Hoveyda and countless others. Among many of the anomalous traits personified by the trial, the court ignored notions of due process, impartiality of the judge, or allowing the defendant to consult legal options. Many pundits have come to conclude that the verdict was already made by the Ayatollah Khomeini before the trial ever commenced. Khalkhali&#x27;s indictment of Hoveyda was as follows:

:Amir Abbas Hoveyda, son of Habibollah, birth certificate number 3542, issued in Tehran, born in 1298 (1919), previously minister of the deposed royal court, and the Shah&#x27;s ex-Prime Minister, a citizen of Iran, is accused of:

:#Spreading corruption on earth.
:#Fighting God, God&#x27;s creatures and the Viceroy of Imam Zaman.
:#Acts of sedition detrimental to national security and independence, through forming cabinets that were puppets of the United States and England and defending the interests of colonialists.
:#Plotting against national sovereignty by interference in elections to Majlis, appointing and dismissing ministers at the behest of foreign embassies.
:#Turning over underground resources: oil, copper and uranium, to foreigners.
:#Expansion of the influence of American imperialism, and its European allies, in Iran by destroying internal resources and turning Iran into a market for foreign commodities.
:#Paying national revenues from oil to the Shah and Farah and to countries dependent on the West and then borrowing money at high interest, and enslaving conditions from America and Western countries.
:#Ruining agriculture and destroying forests.
:#Direct participation in acts of espionage for the West and Zionism.
:#Complicity with conspirators from CENTO and NATO for the oppression of the peoples of Palestine, Vietnam and Iran.
:#Active member of Freemasonry in the Foroughi Lodge according to existing documents and the confessions of the accused.
:#Participation in terrorizing and frightening the justice seeking people including their death and injury and limiting their freedom by closing down newspapers and exercising censorship on the print media and books.
:#Founder and first secretary of the despotic &quot;Rastakhiz of the Iranian People&quot; party.
:#Spreading cultural and ethical corruption and direct participation in consolidating the pillars of colonialism and granting capitulatory rights to Americans.
:#Direct participation in smuggling heroin in France along with Hassan Ali Mansour.
:#False reporting through the publication of puppet papers and appointing puppet editors to head the media.
:#According to minutes of cabinet meetings and of the Supreme Economic Council, and the claims of private plaintiffs, including Ali Sayyed Javadi, and taking into account documents found in SAVAK and the office of the prime minister, and the confessions of Manouchehr Azmoun, Mahmoud Jafarian, Parviz Nick-khah, and the confessions of the accused, since the commission of the crimes is certain, the prosecutor of the Islamic Revolutionary Court asks the court to issue the judgment of the death penalty and the confiscation of all your [Hoveyda&#x27;s] property.

The composition of the trial&#x27;s proceedings reflected the style in which the indictment was designed and promulgated. Many of the charges were never substantiated and often reflected uninvestigated rumours of the day. Abbas Milani agrees with this notion when he described the essence of the court&#x27;s ambience: 

On 7 April 1979, Hoveyda was transported to Qasr Prison, once a getaway palace for monarchs of the Qajar dynasty, but converted into a prison during the 1920s. By this time, he was now aware that there would be no mercy for him, and the whole charade would end in his own murder. Quickly shuffled back in front of Khalkhali&#x27;s tribunal, he once again heard the court&#x27;s indictment at three in the afternoon. There is some speculation as to who ordered the resumption of the trial. Bani Sadr, one among many leaders of the Provisional Revolutionary Government who advocated a public trial, states that only Khomeini himself had the authority to make such an order. Behind locked doors, Hoveyda&#x27;s fate, which had already been decided by Khomeini days earlier, was sealed.

Khalkhali repeatedly yelled at and insulted Hoveyda during much of the trial, calling him &quot;a corrupter of the earth&quot; and a &quot;Western criminal puppet&quot;, refusing to allow him to make a testimony in his defense. In defiance, Hoveyda denounced Khalkhali and informed him that he had no intention of defending himself any longer in front of a sham court. Immediately, Khalkhali announced his sentence, death by firing squad and confiscation of all material possessions.

Minutes later, the former Prime Minister was taken into the prison&#x27;s yard. Before reaching the area designated for firing squad executions, Hojatoleslam Hadi Ghaffari pulled out a pistol and shot Hoveyda twice in the neck. He was left on the ground in agony, begging for the executioners to &quot;finish him off&quot;. Seconds before the coup de grace was at last given, Hoveyda is said to have gasped to the guard standing over him: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t supposed to end like this&quot;. According to the autopsy report, he apparently also was beaten shortly before his execution.

Hoveyda&#x27;s corpse was held in Tehran&#x27;s morgue for several months after his execution, before it was secretly released to his immediate family and buried in Behesht-e Zahra cemetery in Tehran as an unknown deceased.

Following his execution, his residence in A.S.P. Towers was looted by revolutionaries. According to some witnesses he rarely had any items of luxury nature. His prized possessions were a rocking chair and a library of a few hundred books.

==Personal life==

On 19 July 1966, Hoveyda married Laila Emami (1932–2018) in a small ceremony. Only a small number of guests were invited to attend, including the Shah, Queen Farah, Laila&#x27;s parents, Hoveyda&#x27;s mother, and his friend Manouchehr Shahgholi, and his wife. The marriage ended five years later in 1971, but the two would remain friends, often traveling together. Hoveyda had no children.

==Legacy==
In 2000, Hoveyda&#x27;s biography, &quot;The Persian Sphinx&quot; P, was published by Abbas Milani in English, and followed by Persian editions in 2001 and 2002. Hoveyda was awarded the French title of Commander of the Legion of Honour after his death.

<doc id="1328882" wikidata="Q682194" url="?curid=1328882" title="Manuel III of Trebizond">
<text>Manuel III Megas Komnenos (; 16 December 13645 March 1417) was Emperor of Trebizond from 20 March, 1390 to his death in 1417.

The major event of Manuel&#x27;s reign was the arrival of the Central Asian conqueror Tamerlane to Anatolia. This led to the virtual destruction of the Ottoman Empire, which had threatened the existence of Manuel&#x27;s domain, in the Battle of Ankara. Although the Ottomans reconstituted their state after 10 years of civil war, this defeat extended the life and security of the Empire of Trebizond for several more decades.

==Life==
Manuel was the son of Emperor Alexios III of Trebizond by Theodora Kantakouzene. He was made heir apparent in 1377, after the death of his elder brother Basil.

Manuel&#x27;s domain had come under the growing threat of the ruler of the Ottoman Empire, Sultan Bayezid I, who in 1398 had led his army along the Black Sea coast as far as the border of the Empire of Trebizond. Tamerlane, who had campaigned in eastern Anatolia in 1394, returned and captured Sivas (27 August 1400), slaughtering all of its defenders. Tamerlane demanded that Manuel and his army join him in the coming war with the Ottoman Turks, but somehow the Emperor avoided this demand, although he did contribute twenty galleys to Tamerlane&#x27;s general effort. Bayezid and Tamerlane finally met in the Battle of Ankara, where Tamerlane crushed the Ottoman forces and made the Sultan his prisoner. For the next eight months Tamerlane moved about Anatolia, restoring the old Turkish beyliks and plundering Ottoman territories, thus dismantling the Ottoman Empire. It would not be until 1413, when Mehmet I defeated his last surviving brother, that the Ottoman Empire would once more be a threat to any of its neighbors.

When Tamerlane left Asia Minor in 1403, part of his army detached from the whole to visit the city of Kerasous and it was presumably by their ravages that the rule of Melissenos at Oinaion was destroyed. Only the mountains around Kerasous prevented them from venturing any further, much to the relief of the people of Trebizond. Tamerlane also put his nephew Mirza Halil in charge of the affairs of Armenia, Trebizond, and Georgia, but with his father&#x27;s death in 1405 Halil rushed off to assume the throne at Samarkand.

The ambassador to Tamerlane Ruy Gonzáles de Clavijo was received by Manuel while passing through Trebizond in April 1404 and wrote the following of Manuel:

Relations with Venice were better than with Genoa. In 1391 a pact was concluded, on the lines of the treaty of 1319, which reduced the dues Venice paid and confirmed the old privileges. In 1396 Manuel signed a golden bull at the insistence of the Venetian bailli, Gussoni, which allowed the Venetians to trade throughout his realm, granted them their own church, bank, and law court. Manuel sent a bell and clock to Venice to be repaired, and in 1416 a Trapezuntine embassy is recorded visiting that city. However, with Genoa was frequent strife. Manuel was accused of bribing the Genoese officials at Galata. In 1416 Genoa resolved to take steps against him for interference with their castle at Trebizond, which became so serious that the Venetians ordered their galleys to not land at Trebizond due to the &quot;divisions existing between the Emperor and the Genoese&quot;.

The last years of Manuel&#x27;s reign were clouded by discord with his own son Alexios IV, although the latter had been associated in authority as &quot;despotes&quot;. Manuel had for a time taken into his service a young man as his page. The favor shown to him, however, aroused the anger of the native aristocracy because of his humble birth so they poisoned the minds of the people against the page. At the same time, Alexios, covetous of the throne, raised the flag of revolt and demanded that the favorite be banished. The nobles joined him and besieged Manuel in the upper citadel, finally forcing him to concede and banish the favorite from the palace. The people then dispersed, but Alexios, who was still seeking the crown, was forced to reconcile with his father. The price of reconciliation was that Alexios take the young page into his service. Manuel III died in March 1417, and was succeeded by Alexios IV. George Finlay records the rumor that Alexios &quot;was suspected of having hastened his father&#x27;s death.&quot;

Manuel, &quot;like his father, took an active interest in buildings of a religious nature. In the year of his succession he presented an ornate cross believed to contain a holy relic (&quot;stavrotheke&quot;), in this case a piece of the cross on which Jesus Christ was crucified, to the Soumela Monastery.&quot;

==Family==
Manuel married Gulkhan-Eudokia of Georgia, the widow of his elder half-brother Andronikos and a daughter of King David IX of Georgia, in 1377. His second wife, whom he married in 1395, was Anna Philanthropene of the Byzantine Doukas family.

By Gulkhan-Eudokia, he had at least one son:
* Alexios, who succeeded him as Emperor

According to Thierry Ganchou, Manuel had one son by his second wife Anna. Ganchou identifies him as the otherwise nameless Komnenos whom George Sphrantzes mentions in his history. This Komnenos had been the previous owner of the stallion Sphrantzes rode while campaigning in the Morea in 1429, and who married Eudokia the daughter of Manuel Palaiologos Kantakouzenos, but died before the couple could have children.

She gained prominence after appearing on the radio program &quot;Cita Con Eydie&quot; and changing her name for easier pronunciation. Gormé&#x27;s career took off in the early 1950s, starting with her two-month stint with the Tommy Tucker band, followed by a year with Tex Beneke&#x27;s band. She signed with Coral Records in 1952, releasing her first single and later joining &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, where she met Lawrence. The duo&#x27;s success included the hits &quot;Too Close for Comfort&quot; and &quot;Blame It on the Bossa Nova&quot;, with Gormé also achieving solo success and earning Grammy Awards and nominations.

Her marriage to Lawrence in 1957 marked the beginning of a lifelong personal and professional partnership, celebrated with their Emmy-winning television specials and performances alongside stars such as Frank Sinatra. Gormé was renowned for her recordings in Spanish, particularly with Trio Los Panchos, which solidified her international fame. Her versatility was evident in her wide-ranging discography, which includes albums such as &quot;Amor&quot; and &quot;Eydie Swings the Blues&quot;. Gormé&#x27;s contributions to music were recognized with awards, including a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and a Society of Singers Lifetime Achievement Award.

==Early years==
Gormé was born in the Bronx to Sephardic Jewish parents Nessim Hasdai Gormezano and Fortuna &quot;Fortunee&quot; Gormezano. Her father was from Sicily and changed his name to Gormé when he arrived in the US. Both her parents were born in Turkey of Spanish descent, and Gormé grew up speaking English and Spanish.

After graduating from William Howard Taft High School, she attended night classes at City College.

==Career==
After high school, Gormé worked as a Spanish interpreter, but on weekends she sang in a band led by Ken Greengrass.

She appeared on the Spanish-language radio program &quot;Cita Con Eydie&quot; (&quot;A Date with Eydie&quot;), changing her name from &quot;Edith&quot; to &quot;Edie&quot; and then &quot;Eydie&quot; because people mispronounced &quot;Edie&quot;. She considered changing her last name, but her mother told her, &quot;It&#x27;s bad enough that you&#x27;re in show business. How will the neighbors know if you&#x27;re ever a success?&quot;

Gormé sang with the Tommy Tucker band for two months in 1950, followed by a year with Tex Beneke&#x27;s band. She signed as a solo act with Coral Records in 1952 and released her first single, &quot;That Night of Heaven&quot;. She was hired by &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; in its early days with Steve Allen and formed a duo with another one of its staff singers, Steve Lawrence. As &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; was beginning to broadcast across the country in 1954, the duo released their first single, &quot;Make Yourself Comfortable/I&#x27;ve Gotta Crow&quot;.

Gormé had her first chart hit, &quot;Too Close for Comfort&quot;, in 1956 after moving from Coral to ABC-Paramount Records. Two more hits followed. &quot;Mama, Teach Me to Dance&quot; and &quot;Love Me Forever&quot; reached the top-40 singles chart, while her albums &quot;Eydie Gorme&quot; and &quot;Eydie Swings the Blues&quot; reached the top-20 albums chart.

In 1957, Gormé and Lawrence were married, and several months later they hosted &quot;Steve Allen Presents the Steve Lawrence-Eydie Gormé Show&quot; after Allen retired from &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. Three more singles by Gormé and two more albums became chart hits. In 1960, they sang in clubs and released &quot;We Got Us&quot;, their first album as a duo. They received a Grammy Award for Best Performance by a Vocal Group for the title track from the album. Gormé recorded &quot;Yes My Darling Daughter&quot; for Columbia Records, and it reached the top 10 in the UK.

In 1963, she reached the top 10 in the U.S. with &quot;Blame It on the Bossa Nova&quot;. The song earned her a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female Vocal Performance and was certified gold after selling one million copies. The album &quot;Blame It on the Bossa Nova&quot; entered the top 40 with four more hit singles during the same year. Two were recorded as the duo Steve and Eydie. She recorded the Spanish albums &quot;Amor&quot; and &quot;More Amor&quot; with the Trio Los Panchos, then she turned to show tunes. &quot;If He Walked into My Life&quot; was an easy-listening hit in 1966 and earned her a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.

Steve and Eydie moved on to Broadway, starring in the musical &quot;Golden Rainbow&quot; based on the play &quot;A Hole in the Head&quot;. &quot;How Could I Be So Wrong&quot; by Gormé, which was performed in the musical, was a hit on the easy-listening chart. The musical had a successful one-year run. Steve and Eydie signed to RCA Victor and released two albums, while Gormé had another hit with the title track and album &quot;Tonight I&#x27;ll Say a Prayer&quot; in 1970. Their last hit on the pop chart was the song &quot;We Can Make It Together&quot; with the Osmonds in 1973.

Gormé was successful in the Latin music market and internationally through albums she recorded in Spanish with the Trio Los Panchos. Her first recording with Los Panchos came about after the popular group with members from Mexico and Puerto Rico, composed of Alfredo Gil, Chucho Navarro, and Johnny Albino, saw her perform at Manhattan&#x27;s Club Copacabana late in 1963. Gormé had achieved international fame from the song &quot;Blame it on the Bossa Nova&quot;, which sold 250,000 copies in Spanish in addition to sales in English. Los Panchos were the top &quot;bolero &quot;singers in Latin America, so when they suggested a recording, Columbia agreed.

In 1964, Columbia released the album &quot;Amor&quot;, which spent 22 weeks on the charts. The song &quot;Sabor a Mí&quot; became one of Gormé&#x27;s signature tunes. In 1965, a sequel appeared called &quot;More Amor&quot;, later reissued as &quot;Cuatro Vidas&quot;. Her last album with Los Panchos was &quot;Navidad Means Christmas&quot; (1966), later reissued as &quot;Blanca Navidad&quot;. She recorded other Spanish albums in her career, including the Grammy-nominated &quot;La Gormé&quot; (1976). &quot;Muy Amigos/Close Friends&quot; (1977), a duet collection with Puerto Rican singer Danny Rivera, also received a Grammy nomination.

Steve and Eydie performed a tribute to George Gershwin on their television special &quot;Our Love Is Here to Stay&quot;, which won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Music or Comedy Special. Two years later they sang on &quot;Steve and Eydie Celebrate Irving Berlin&quot; and again won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Music or Comedy Special. In 1989, they started the record label GL Music. They sang with Frank Sinatra on his 70th-birthday tour and on his album &quot;Duets II&quot; (1994). They recorded a cover version of the song &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; by the rock band Soundgarden for the album &quot;Lounge-A-Palooza&quot; (1997).

As the 21st century arrived, the couple announced plans to reduce their touring, starting a One More for the Road Tour in 2002. In 2006, Gormé became a blogger. In November 2009, after his wife retired, Lawrence embarked on a solo music tour.

==Personal life==
Gormé and Lawrence had two sons. David Nessim Lawrence (b. 1960) is an ASCAP Award-winning composer who composed the score for &quot;High School Musical&quot;. Michael Robert Lawrence (1962–1986) died at the age of 23 of ventricular fibrillation from an undiagnosed heart condition.

Gormé and Lawrence were in Atlanta, Georgia, at the time of their son&#x27;s death, having performed at the Fox Theater the night before. Frank Sinatra, a family friend, sent his private plane to fly the couple to New York, where David had been attending school. After their son&#x27;s death, Gormé and Lawrence suspended touring for a year.

==Death==
Gormé died on August 10, 2013, at age 84, at Sunrise Hospital &amp; Medical Center in Las Vegas following an undisclosed illness. She was interred at Hillside Memorial Park in Los Angeles, California.

Lawrence issued a statement: &quot;Eydie has been my partner on stage and in my life for more than 55 years. I fell in love with her the moment I saw her and even more the first time I heard her sing. While my personal loss is unimaginable, the world has lost one of the greatest pop vocalists of all time.&quot; Lawrence died on March 7, 2024, at the age of 88 from complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

==In popular culture==
Gormé was portrayed by Victoria Jackson in the popular &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; skit &quot;The Sinatra Group&quot; in tandem with Mike Myers portraying her husband Steve Lawrence.

<doc id="1328903" wikidata="Q2302018" url="?curid=1328903" title="Sunda Arc">
<text>The Sunda Arc is a volcanic arc that produced the volcanoes that form the topographic spine of the islands of Sumatra, Nusa Tenggara, Java, the Sunda Strait, and the Lesser Sunda Islands. The Sunda Arc begins at Sumatra and ends at Flores, and is adjacent to the Banda Arc. The Sunda Arc is formed via the subduction of the Indo-Australian Plate beneath the Sunda and Burma plates at a velocity of 63–70 mm/year.

== Formation and geologic setting ==
Mid-oceanic ridge basalts (MORB) form most of the oceanic basin south of Sunda, according to geodynamic studies. These plates began to converge in the Early Miocene. The Indo-Australian Plate is subducting beneath the Eurasian Plate with a dip angle of 49–56 degrees. The slab subducting under Java is continuous down to the lower mantle. However, the slab appears to beak apart under Sumatra Island&quot;.&quot; Earthquake depth records indicate that there is no deep seismic activity in Sumatra, likely due to the age of the subducting complex&quot;.&quot; Two types of subductions have been identified along the Sunda Arc: 1) orthogonal subduction along Java and 2) oblique subduction on the Sumatra side. These subductions are separated by the Sunda Strait.

== Notable seismic events ==
With the ongoing magmatic activities and the nature of the subduction zone, Sunda Arc has experienced major seismic events throughout history. These events cost the loss of lives and vast destruction along the coast. These are some major seismic events that have been recorded.
=== Tsunami in December 2004, Indian Ocean ===
In 2004, a tsunami in the Indian Ocean was triggered by an earthquake of 9.15 magnitude near Sumatra Island. In the Banda Aceh area, the tsunami height reached up to 35 meters, which surpassed the value recorded before this event.

=== Tsunami in July 2006, West Java and Central Java, Indonesia ===
An earthquake and tsunami occurred on July 17, 2006, causing major destruction in West Java and Central Java. The Mw-7.7 earthquake-induced tsunami struck over 250 km of the coastline and caused more than 600 deaths. The approximate run-up height was about 4–6 meters.

== Historic eruptions and arc volcanism ==
The Sunda Arc is home to some of the world&#x27;s most dangerous and explosive volcanoes. The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora on Sumbawa and the 1257 eruption of Mount Samalas on Lombok were among the largest in the last two millennia, ranking 7 on the VEI scale. The Sunda Arc subduction zone was also the site of one of the largest known eruptions of the Cenozoic, the VEI 8 Toba supereruption on Sumatra, which expelled 2,800 km3 of magma c. 74,000 BP. The resulting caldera has become Lake Toba. The loudest noise in recorded history occurred during the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa and was heard away. Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed by these eruptions and by episodes of activity at other volcanoes, including Papandayan, Galunggung, Merapi, Kelud, Sinabung, and Agung.

=== Main-arc volcanism ===

The main-arc volcanism along Sunda is mainly derived from the interaction between the Indo-Australian Plate and the Eurasia Plate. Magma originates from the partial melting of the mantle wedge driven by the fluids from the subducting slab. In addition, volcanic rocks from the Quaternary generally show more enrichment in alkaline contents than those from the Tertiary age. The majority of basalts of the arc have calc-alkaline contents, except for some potassic lava production in East Java.

=== Back-arc volcanism ===
The magmatic activities along the back-arc may or may not relate to the main arc materials. Magma and lava appear to have originated from molten materials at a deeper part of the mantle as supported by a higher K2O/Na2O ratio in comparison to other parts of Sunda Arc. The most salient volcanoes in the back-arc region are Lasem, Muria, and Bawean in which their volcanic rocks show complex patterns in terms of chemical signature.

== Major islands ==

=== Java ===
Java Island is located on the east side of the Sunda Arc, located between Sumatra and Bali. Its oceanic crust&#x27;s thickness is approximately 20–25 kilometers. With the geological activities and the tectonic nature of Sunda Arc, megathrust earthquakes and volcanic activities are ubiquitous on Java island. Modern volcanoes at Java are formed during the Tertiary with typical products of andesitic composition and progressively get more alkali content during the Quaternary. Along the Java island, there are approximately 62 geothermal fields that can be utilized for further usages including producing electricity. Java is also a germinal center for supplying gold and copper in which the occurrences of these low-sulfidation (LS) epithermal deposits may associate with magmatic arc activities with the spatial relationship between the akaditic magma and porphyry Cu-Au deposits.

==== East Java ====
Most volcanic activity in East Java is Plinian-type, which is very explosive and emits columns of hot volcanic debris. The adiakitic magma, which deviates from usual island-arc magma, is associated with porphyry deposits. There is evidence that the Ringgit-Beser volcanic complex also produces potassic and magnesian lava, which could be a result of the decreasing influence of subduction-related material. A major volcano in East Java is Mount Bromo.
==== Central Java ====
There exist two main arcs at Central Java which are Southern Mountain Arc (SMA) and Modern Volcanic Arc (MVA) which give rise to frequent volcanic activities. Prior studies suggested that SMA was formed during the Middle Eocene, followed by the subduction that resulted in the formation of MVA in the Late Eocene. Central Java is home to one of the most notorious volcanoes, Merapi, as well as other major volcanoes such as Merbabu, Muria, and Slamet.

Mount Merapi is the most active volcano in Indonesia which erupts periodically every 2–6 years and has shown perennial volcanic activities dating back roughly 2000 years ago based on carbon isotopic signatures. The earliest eruption has been approximated to be roughly 40,000 years ago. The most recent significant eruptions occurred in 1994, 2006, and 2010. Mount Merapi is a steep stratovolcano situated on Central Java Island with seismic and volcanic activities that could pose major threats to countless lives and infrastructures in its vicinity. Most recent volcanic activities are induced by the collapse of the lava dome, contributing to the highly explosive eruption of andesitic materials.

==== West Java ====
The volcanic activities in this region have begun roughly since the Late Cretaceous or Pleistocene epoch. There are two major volcanic zones called the volcanic front (VF) and the rear arc (RA) with different chemical imprints. The volcanic development of the northern area of West Java started earlier during the Late Cretaceous period, while the southern area&#x27;s volcanic development developed later during the Miocene. The geochemical study of major and trace elements and isotopic signatures of lava have confirmed the steady-state subduction and ongoing replenishment of magma for about 10 Ma. The volcanic rocks found on West Java are dated back to the Eocene. The basement of West Java is a continental lithosphere which can be inferred from crustal assimilation and contamination in volcanic rocks. The latest large eruption recorded in the province was the 1982 eruption of Mount Galunggung, with a recorded VEI of 4.

===Krakatoa===
The island of Anak Krakatau has grown at an average rate of five inches (13 cm) per week since the 1950s. Quiet periods of a few days have alternated with almost continuous Strombolian eruptions since 1994. In 1883 CE, tsunamis were triggered by the eruption of Krakatoa with a run-up of 41 meters. The magnitude of damage reached Panama, which was located almost 19,300 km away from the focus.

=== Sumatra ===
Sumatra Island is located on the southwest side of the Sunda Arc. The main seismic zone of Sumatra is the Sumatra Fault System (SFS), which trends NW-SE. The subducting oceanic crust is dated to be approximately 50 to 90 Ma. A K/Ar study reveals that subducted-related magmatism in Sumatra started roughly in the early Mesozoic according to the evidence derived from the plutonic body on Barisan Mountain. The key mineralization found in Sumatra is epithermal veins of Au, Ag, Zn, Pb, and other metals in which these ore bodies are correlated to arc volcanism and subvolcanism intrusive bodies.

Mount Sinabung is a stratovolcano of andesite and dacite in the Karo plateau of North Sumatra, 40 kilometres (25 mi) from the Lake Toba supervolcano. It has been continuously active since 2013.

=== Nusa Tenggara ===
Nusa Tenggara lies on the east side of the Sunda Arc. The information and study on this island are scarce compared to Java due to the difficulty of access. Generally, the island is composed of Quaternary volcanic deposits. Major volcanoes in Nusa Tenggara are Kelimutu and Mount Rinjani. Another active major volcano in the region is Mount Tambora, whose eruption in 1815 led to global climate abnormalities in the subsequent year, known as the Year Without a Summer. Seismic studies have shown clusters of seismic events beneath active island-arc volcanoes, which may be a result of the collision zone.

<doc id="1328907" wikidata="Q1707568" url="?curid=1328907" title="Tinsel">
<text>Tinsel is a type of decorative material that mimics the effect of ice, consisting of thin strips of sparkling material attached to a thread. When in long narrow strips not attached to thread, it is called &quot;lametta&quot;, and emulates icicles. It was originally a metallic garland for Christmas decoration. The modern production of tinsel typically involves plastic, and is used particularly to decorate Christmas trees. It may be hung from ceilings or wrapped around statues, lampposts, and so on. Modern tinsel was invented in Nuremberg, Germany, in 1610, and was originally made of shredded silver.
According to the &quot;Concise Oxford Dictionary&quot;, the word is from the Old French word &quot;estincele&quot;, meaning &quot;&quot;.

==History==
In the 16th-century the word &quot;tinsel&quot; was used for a variety of lightweight fabrics with a metallic effect made with silk and gold and silver thread, including &quot;tinselled satin&quot;. These tinsel fabrics were used in elite clothes (regulated by sumptuary law), masque costume, and for heraldic banners and flags. Elizabeth of York bought &quot;tynsell satin&quot; in 1502 and the wardrobe of Margaret Tudor included &quot;tynsen&quot; in 1515. Tinsel and &quot;tilsent&quot; were less costly than cloth of gold. Tinsel was used for a veil or caul worn by Mary I of England at her coronation in 1553. Silver tinsel fabric, described in Italian as &quot;tocca d&#x27;argento&quot;, was used for the sails of mechanical ships at a masque at the wedding of Mary, Queen of Scots, and Francis, Dauphin of France in April 1558.

Modern tinsel was invented in Nuremberg around 1610. Tinsel was originally made from extruded strands of silver. Because silver tarnishes quickly, other shiny metals were substituted. Before the 19th century, tinsel was used for adorning sculptures rather than Christmas trees. It was added to Christmas trees to enhance the flickering of the candles on the tree. Tinsel was used to represent the starry sky over a Nativity scene.
By the early 20th century, manufacturing advances allowed cheap aluminium-based tinsel, and until World War I, France was the world leader in its manufacture. Production was curtailed during the First World War as a result of wartime demand for copper.

During the 1950s, tinsel and tinsel garlands were so popular that they frequently were used more than Christmas lights, as tinsel was much less of a fire hazard than lights were for the then-popular aluminum Christmas trees, which were made from flammable aluminized paper.

Lead foil was a popular material for tinsel manufacture for several decades of the 20th century. Unlike silver, lead tinsel did not tarnish, so it retained its shine. However, use of lead tinsel was phased out after the 1960s due to concern that it exposed children to a risk of lead poisoning. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded in August 1971 that lead tinsel caused an unnecessary risk to children, and convinced manufacturers and importers to voluntarily stop producing or importing lead tinsel after January 1, 1972. The FDA did not actually ban the product because the agency did not have the evidence needed to declare lead tinsel a &quot;health hazard.&quot;

Modern tinsel is typically made from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) film coated with a metallic finish. Coated mylar film also has been used. These plastic forms of tinsel do not hang as well as tinsel made from heavy metals such as silver and lead.

== Figurative use ==
Germans refer to a row of military Awards and decorations as &quot;Lametta&quot; (German for tinsel), similar to dressing in full regalia or with a high level of formality. The expression was coined earlier to describe the appearance of Hermann Göring, e.g. in a &quot;Chanson&quot; by Claire Waldoff, &quot;Rechts Lametta, links Lametta, Und der Bauch wird imma fetta&quot; (Tinsel on the right, tinsel on the left, and the belly gets fatter and fatter).

Humorist Loriot&#x27;s 1977 film &quot;Weihnachten bei Hoppenstedts&quot; about a family Christmas involved a Prussian-educated grandfather humming the &quot;&quot; with &quot;ra-da-buff&quot; and deploring the lack of tinsel („&quot;Früher war mehr Lametta!&quot;“ &quot;There used to be more tinsel!&quot;), thus lamenting the changes in life due to the course of time, has become proverbial.

==Other uses==
Tinsel prints are two different types of print, where tinsel is added after printing, for decorative effect. The older type is a rare style of German religious woodcut from the early 15th century. The later type is English and 19th-century, especially used for prints of actors in their roles.

Tinsel has many traditional uses in India, including decorations on images, garlands for weddings and other ceremonies, and ornamental trappings for horses and elephants. Tinsels of various types are popular materials used in fly tying.

<text>getent is a Unix command that helps a user get entries in a number of important text files called databases. This includes the passwd and group databases which store user information – hence is a common way to look up user details on Unix. Since uses the same name service as the system, will show all information, including that gained from network information sources such as LDAP.

The databases it searches in are: ahosts, ahostsv4, ahostsv6, aliases, ethers (Ethernet addresses), group, gshadow, hosts, netgroup, networks, passwd, protocols, rpc, services, and shadow.

The general syntax is:

getent database [key ...]
Thorsten Kukuk wrote the &quot;getent&quot; utility for the GNU C Library.

== Examples ==

Fetch list of user accounts on a Unix system (stored in a database called &#x27;passwd&#x27;). This will show all user accounts, regardless of the type of name service used. For example, if both local and LDAP name service are used for user accounts, the results will include all local and LDAP users:

$ getent passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/bin/sh
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/bin/sh
sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/bin/sh

man:x:6:12:man:/var/cache/man:/bin/sh
lp:x:7:7:lp:/var/spool/lpd:/bin/sh
mail:x:8:8:mail:/var/mail:/bin/sh

Fetch details for a particular user called joe:

$ getent passwd joe
joe:x:1000:1000:Joe,,:/home/joe:/bin/bash

Fetch list of group accounts on a Unix system (stored in a database called &#x27;group&#x27;):

$ getent group

<text>Ernest Judson Wilson (February 28, 1894 – June 24, 1963), nicknamed &quot;Boojum&quot;, was an American third baseman, first baseman, and manager in Negro league baseball. He played for the Baltimore Black Sox, the Homestead Grays, and the Philadelphia Stars between 1922 and 1945. Wilson was known for possessing a unique physique, a quick temper, and outstanding hitting skills. One of the Negro leagues&#x27; most powerful hitters, his career batting average of .351 ranks him among the top five players.

Wilson was posthumously elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006, one of 17 black Negro league or pre-Negro league players inducted that year.

==Early life==
Wilson was born in Remington, Virginia.

As a teenager, he moved to Foggy Bottom in Washington, D.C.

The first mention of Wilson&#x27;s early life was his induction into the United States Army on June 29, 1918, where he served in World War I as a corporal in Company D, 417th Service Battalion.

==Career==
Wilson debuted for the Baltimore Black Sox in 1922. Though Wilson was referred to as &quot;Babe Ruth Wilson&quot; by the media, his teammates nicknamed him &quot;Boojum&quot; after the noise his line drives made after striking the outfield fences. The team went on a 12-game winning streak after Wilson joined the club. He finished his first season with a .390 batting average and a team high in home runs. The Black Sox joined the Eastern Colored League in 1923. Wilson hit .373 that season, leading the league. However, the team finished in last place, prompting the hiring of Pete Hill as the team&#x27;s manager.

During the 1920s, Wilson was also enjoying remarkable success playing winter baseball in the Cuban League. His career batting average there was the highest in league history.

Wilson moved to the Homestead Grays for 1931 and part of 1932, finishing that season with the Pittsburgh Crawfords. He joined the Philadelphia Stars in 1933. In the 1934 Negro National League playoffs, Wilson struck an umpire but was not removed from the game. The incident raised questions about the league&#x27;s ability to enforce rules against the top players and the most influential teams. In 1940, Wilson returned to the Homestead Grays. He played with the team through 1945, when he was 49 years old.

Struggling with his fielding skills, Wilson often blocked or knocked down batted balls rather than catching them with his glove. Because of his strong arm, he was still able to throw runners out on such plays. He had an unusual physique, standing 5&#x27;8&quot; and weighing 195 pounds with a large torso, a small waist, bowed legs and pigeon toe. Pitcher Satchel Paige claimed that Wilson and Chino Smith were the two toughest outs he ever faced (Wilson hit .375 against Paige). Catcher Josh Gibson said that Wilson was the best hitter in baseball.

Wilson was known for a bad temper and a willingness to get into physical altercations. His friend Jake Stephens said, &quot;The minute he saw an umpire, he became a maniac.&quot; A well-circulated story involved Wilson holding Stephens out of a 16th story window by one leg after Stephens came in late and woke him. Others, including Judy Johnson and Ted Page, described him as different off the field. &quot;He&#x27;d do anything in the world for you,&quot; Johnson said. Late in his career, Wilson developed epilepsy. During a Negro World Series game, Wilson began to draw circles in the dirt and was said to be unaware of his surroundings.

==Later life==
After retiring, he worked on a road construction crew in Washington, D.C. He had to be institutionalized late in life. Wilson died at age 69 in Washington, D.C., and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Wilson was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Negro Leagues Committee in 2006. Wilson was elected in a class of 17 Negro league and black pre-Negro league inductees, the largest such group inducted in Hall of Fame history. Hall of Fame officials did not think that Wilson had any living relatives, but a great-niece heard about his scheduled induction and was able to attend the ceremony on his behalf. In 2010, the Washington Nationals honored Wilson and five other Homestead Grays in the Hall of Fame by including them in a Hall of Fame Ring of Honor at Nationals Park.

<doc id="1328919" wikidata="Q2746753" url="?curid=1328919" title="Ophiophagy">
<text>Ophiophagy (Greek: , ) is a specialized form of feeding or alimentary behavior of animals which hunt and eat snakes. There are ophiophagous mammals (such as the skunks and the mongooses), birds (such as snake eagles, the secretarybird, and some hawks), lizards (such as the common collared lizard), and even other snakes, such as the Central and South American mussuranas and the North American common kingsnake. The venomous king cobra (&quot;Ophiophagus hannah&quot;) is also named for this habit.

==Ophiophagy in myth and legend==
:&quot;The mythic associations of snakes are discussed at Serpent (symbolism).&quot;
A snake-eating raptor appears in a legend of the ancient Mexican people, who gave rise to the Aztec empire; this is represented in the Mexican flag. The Mexica people, guided by their god Huitzilopochtli, sought the place where a bird lands on the prickly pear and devours a snake. They found their sign on an island in Lake Texcoco, where they erected the city of Tenochtitlan (&quot;Place of the Prickly Pear Cactus&quot;; present-day México City) in 1325. On the coat of arms of México, this bird is said to be depicted as a golden eagle, though it is also often said to be a crested caracara. It is also possible that the bird was inspired by a laughing falcon or red-tailed hawk, both raptors which feed on a large number of reptiles, including snakes.

The golden eagle will actually eat snakes, but does not specialize in them, preferring larger mammalian prey, from medium-sized rodents and lagomorphs to mustelids even small mammalian carnivores, all the way to deer fawns and lambs. However, snakes are the most common type of reptile to appear in the golden eagle&#x27;s overall diet, making up about 2.9% of the remains from all studied golden eagle nests.
The Mayans also had the legend of ophiophagy in their folklore and mythology.

Guatemala may derive its name from the Nahuatl word &quot;coactlmoctl-lan&quot;, meaning &quot;land of the snake-eating bird.&quot;

Christian scripture associates snakes with “evil” (see serpent), and considers anything that destroys them “good” (i.e., Saint Patrick allegedly having “driven” all of the snakes from Ireland, through the power of God). An example for this tradition is further seen, metaphorically, in Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s short story &quot;Rikki-Tikki-Tavi&quot; (part of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;), in which a mongoose named Rikki-Tikki defends a human family against a pair of evil cobras. On a basic, natural level, most species of mongoose (and meerkats) are known to hunt and eat snakes much larger than themselves, including some of the most venomous cobras, vipers, boomslangs and mambas, instinctively avoiding the venom glands.

In Hindu and Buddhist folklore, Garuda (the eagle-deity mount of Vishnu) is the enemy of the Nāgas, a race of intelligent serpent- or dragon-like beings, whom he hunts.

==Practical use==
In some regions, farmers keep ophiophagous animals as pets in order to keep their living environment clear of such snakes as cobras and pit vipers (including rattlesnakes and lanceheads) which annually claim a large number of deaths of domestic animals, such as cattle, and bites on humans. An example is tamed mongooses in India. In the 1930s a Brazilian plan to breed and release large numbers of mussuranas for the control of pit vipers was tried but did not work. The Butantan Institute, in São Paulo, which specializes in the production of antivenoms, erected a statue of the mussurana &quot;Clelia clelia&quot; as its symbol and a tribute to its usefulness in combating venomous snake bites. Peafowl have been kept for millennia due to their ophiophagous habit.

==Immunity==
Many ophiophagous animals seem to be immune to the venom of the usual snakes they prey and feed upon. The phenomenon was studied in the mussurana by the Brazilian scientist Vital Brazil. They have antihemorrhagic and antineurotoxic antibodies in their blood. The Virginia opossum (&quot;Didelphis virginiana&quot;) has been found to have the most resistance towards snake venom. This immunity is not acquired and has probably evolved as an adaptation to predation by venomous snakes in their habitat.

In Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, the author correctly dismisses the idea of mongooses ingesting herbs to combat poison as old folklore. He attributes no special abilities to the animal other than superb agility and skill at avoiding being bitten. However, recent studies have shown that the mongoose&#x27;s ability to resist snake venom is at least in part due to its modified nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AcChoR) that does not bind with alpha-BTX, and alpha-neurotoxin.

<text>Miguel Ángel Osorio Benítez (July 29, 1883 – January 14, 1942), better known by his pseudonym, Porfirio Barba-Jacob, was a Colombian poet and writer.

Born in Santa Rosa de Osos, Antioquia, to parents Antonio María Osorio and Pastora Benítez, he was raised by his grandparents in Angostura. In 1895 he started his travels, first through Colombia, and from 1907 to Central America and the United States, before finally settling down in 1930 in Mexico City.

Around 1902 in Bogotá, he founded the literary magazine &quot;El cancionero antioqueño&quot; (&quot;The Antioquian songbook&quot;), which he managed under the pseudonym Marín Jiménez. Short after, he wrote the novel &quot;Virginia&quot;, which was never published because the original manuscript was confiscated by the mayor of Angostura for alleged immorality.

In 1906 he moved to Barranquilla where he adopted the pseudonym Ricardo Arenales. He continued to use this pseudonym until 1922 when in Guatemala he adopted a new pseudonym which he would use for the rest of his life: Porfirio Barba-Jacob. Around 1907, still in Barranquilla, he wrote his first poems, such as &quot;Árbol viejo&quot;, &quot;Campiña florida&quot;, and his most famous work, &quot;Canción de la vida profunda&quot; (&quot;Song of the deep life&quot;).

During his journey through Central America, Mexico and the US, he contributed to many magazines and journals. He befriended Porfirio Díaz, which led to his fleeing to Guatemala, then to Cuba, for disagreeing with Manuel Estrada.

In 1918 he returned to Mexico, where it is said that he wrote a biography of Pancho Villa. In 1922 he was expelled by Álvaro Obregón and fled again to Guatemala, from where he was again expelled in 1924 by Jorge Ubico. Barba-Jacob then went to El Salvador, and after being deported by Alfonso Quiñones, travelled to Honduras, New Orleans and Cuba. In 1927 he returned to Colombia and, after some recitals and contributions to the Colombian journal &quot;El Espectador&quot;, he left Colombia on what would be his last trip.

He died in 1942 of tuberculosis in Mexico City. Four years after his death, on 11 January 1946, his ashes were claimed by the Colombian government and were returned to the Rotonda de los Hombres Ilustres. During the course of his life, Barba-Jacob was openly gay.

<text>The Síyáh-Chál ( literally &quot;black pit&quot;) was a subterrenean dungeon southeast of the palace of the Sháh in Tehran. It carries a significant role in the history of the Baháʼí Faith, because its founder, Baháʼu&#x27;lláh was held there for four months in 1852, and it is where he claimed to have received a revelation. The Síyáh-Chál is regarded as the second holiest place in Iran to Baháʼís, after the house of the Báb, in Shiraz.

The pit was a discarded cistern converted into a dungeon. It had three flights of steep stairs descending into an area that received no light. There was no functioning latrine, and the small area was filled with up to 150 men.

On 15 August 1852, a radical group of Bábís attempted the assassination of the Shah and failed. The group of Bábís linked with the plan were rounded up and executed, but notwithstanding the assassins&#x27; claim that they were working alone, the entire Bábí community was blamed, precipitating a pogrom against the Bábí community that was encouraged and orchestrated by the government. During this time many Bábís were killed, and about 30, including Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, were imprisoned in the Síyáh-Chál along with many criminals.

According to Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, it was during this four-month imprisonment in appalling conditions that he had several mystical experiences, and received a vision of a maiden, through whom he received his mission as a messenger of God and as the one whose coming the Báb had prophesied. It was also the place where he composed his first known tablet, the Rashḥ-i-ʻAmá.

The ambassador of Russia requested that Baháʼu&#x27;lláh and others apparently unconnected with the conspiracy be spared. After he had been in the Síyáh-Chál for four months Baháʼu&#x27;lláh was in fact finally released, on condition he left Iran.

In 1868 the dungeon was filled-in and the Tikyíh Dowlat, an opera house, was built over the site. The site was Baháʼí property from 1954 until the Islamic Revolution of 1979.

==Maid of Heaven==

In October 1852, after two months had passed in the gloom and stench of the dungeon, Baháʼu&#x27;lláh described his vision in the Síyáh-Chál as a &#x27;Maid of Heaven&#x27; (). He described his experiences in the &quot;Epistle to the Son of the Wolf&quot; and &quot;Súriy-i-Haykal&quot;. For example, in the &quot;Súriy-i-Haykal&quot; he wrote:
The Maid of Heaven also appears in several tablets of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh&#x27;s, including &quot;Tablet of the Maiden&quot; (&quot;Lawh-i-Húrí&quot;), &quot;Tablet of the Deathless Youth&quot; (&quot;Lawh-i-Ghulámu&#x27;l-Khuld&quot;), &quot;Tablet of the Wondrous Maiden&quot; (&quot;Húr-i-&#x27;Ujáb&quot;), &quot;Tablet of the Holy Mariner&quot; (&quot;Lawh-i-Malláhu&#x27;l-Quds&quot;) (all written in the Baghdad period 1856–63), the &quot;Súrih of the Pen&quot; (&quot;Súriy-i-Qalam&quot;; c. 1865) and the &quot;Tablet of the Vision&quot; (&quot;Lawh-i-Ruʼyá&quot;; 1873).

Hatcher and Hemmat interpret the different occurrences of the Maid of Heaven throughout the writings of Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh as the gradual unveiling of the station of Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh. Sours describes parallels with Sophia, the personification of Wisdom in the Wisdom literature in the Bible. John Walbridge categorized her appearance under four themes: &#x27;the maiden revealed&#x27; as the personification of the spirit of God, &#x27;the maiden in love&#x27; as a bride personifying his coming revelation, &#x27;the maiden heartbroken&#x27; in sorrow and grief over impending exile and of internal and external enemies, and &#x27;the maiden afterwards&#x27; representing healing of spiritual wounds and the increasing tranquility of Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh&#x27;s later years.

The Guardian of the Baháʼí Faith, Shoghi Effendi, compares the Maid of Heaven with the Holy Spirit as manifested in the burning bush of Moses, the Dove to Jesus, and the angel Gabriel to Muhammad. Further, Farshid Kazemi discusses links with the Zoroastrian divine personification Daena. Effendi wrote about the Maiden in &quot;God Passes By&quot;: &quot;He lauded the names and attributes of His Creator, extolled the glories and mysteries of His own Revelation, sang the praises of that Maiden that personified the Spirit of God within Him&quot;.

<doc id="1328932" wikidata="Q424342" url="?curid=1328932" title="Paraldehyde">
<text>Paraldehyde is the cyclic trimer of acetaldehyde molecules. Formally, it is a derivative of 1,3,5-trioxane, with a methyl group substituted for a hydrogen atom at each carbon. The corresponding tetramer is metaldehyde. A colourless liquid, it is sparingly soluble in water and highly soluble in ethanol. Paraldehyde slowly oxidizes in air, turning brown and producing an odour of acetic acid. It attacks most plastics and rubbers and should be kept in glass bottles.

Paraldehyde was first observed in 1835 by the German chemist Justus Liebig; its empirical formula was determined in 1838 by Liebig&#x27;s student Hermann Fehling. The German chemist Valentin Hermann Weidenbusch (1821–1893), another of Liebig&#x27;s students, synthesized paraldehyde in 1848 by treating acetaldehyde with acid (either sulfuric or nitric acid) and cooling to 0°C. He found it quite remarkable that when paraldehyde was &quot;heated&quot; with a trace of the same acid, the reaction went the other way, recreating acetaldehyde.

Paraldehyde has uses in industry and medicine.

== Preparation ==
Paraldehyde can be produced by the direct reaction of acetaldehyde and sulfuric acid. The product of the reaction is dependent on the temperature. At room temperature and higher, the formation of trimer is preferred, but at lower temperatures, around  −10 °C, the tetramer metaldehyde is more likely to be produced.

The reaction of sulfuric acid and acetaldehyde is exothermic, with the heat of reaction being −113 kJ·mol−1.

== Stereochemistry ==
Paraldehyde is produced and used as a mixture of two diastereomers, known as &quot;cis&quot;- and &quot;trans-&quot;paraldehyde. For each diastereomer, two chair conformers are possible. The structures (1), (4) and (2), (3) are conformers of &quot;cis&quot;- and &quot;trans&quot;-paraldehyde, respectively. The structures (3) (a conformer of (2)) and (4) (a conformer of (1)) are high energy conformers on steric grounds (1,3-diaxial interactions are present) and do not exist to any appreciable extent in a sample of paraldehyde.

==Reactions==
Heated with catalytic amounts of acid, it depolymerizes back to acetaldehyde:

:C6H12O3 → 3CH3CHO

Since paraldehyde has better handling characteristics, it may be used indirectly or directly as a synthetic equivalent of anhydrous acetaldehyde (b.p. 20 °C). For example, it is used as-is in the synthesis of bromal (tribromoacetaldehyde):

: C6H12O3 + 9 Br2 → 3 CBr3CHO + 9 HBr

==Medical applications==
Paraldehyde was introduced into clinical practice in the UK by the Italian physician Vincenzo Cervello (1854–1918) in 1882.

It is a central nervous system depressant and was soon found to be an effective anticonvulsant, hypnotic and sedative. It was included in some cough medicines as an expectorant (though there is no known mechanism for this function beyond the placebo effect).

Paraldehyde was the last injection given to Edith Alice Morrell in 1950 by the suspected serial killer John Bodkin Adams. He was tried for her murder but acquitted.

===As a hypnotic/sedative===
It was commonly used to induce sleep in sufferers from delirium tremens but has been replaced by other drugs in this regard. It was considered to have been one of the safest hypnotics and was regularly given at bedtime in psychiatric hospitals and geriatric wards until the 1970s , but after it was confirmed that acetaldehyde is a confirmed category-1 human carcinogen, it could no longer be considered appropriately safe to use. Up to 30% of the dose is excreted via the lungs (the rest via the liver). This contributes to a strong unpleasant odour on the breath.

===As anti-seizure drug===
Today, paraldehyde is sometimes used to treat status epilepticus. Unlike diazepam and other benzodiazepines, it does not suppress breathing at therapeutic doses and so is safer when no resuscitation facilities exist or when the patient&#x27;s breathing is already compromised. This makes it a useful emergency medication for parents and other caretakers of children with epilepsy. Since the dose margin between the anticonvulsant and hypnotic effect is small, paraldehyde treatment usually results in sleep.

===Administration===
Generic paraldehyde is available in 5 mL sealed glass ampoules. Production in the US has been discontinued, but it was previously marketed as Paral.

Paraldehyde has been given orally, rectally, intravenously and by intramuscular injection. It reacts with rubber and plastic which limits the time it may safely be kept in contact with some syringes or tubing before administration.

* Injection. Intramuscular injection can be very painful and lead to sterile abscesses, nerve damage, and tissue necrosis. Intravenous administration can lead to pulmonary edema, circulatory collapse and other complications.
* Oral. Paraldehyde has a hot burning taste and can upset the stomach. It is often mixed with milk or fruit juice in a glass cup and stirred with a metal spoon.
* Rectal. It may be mixed 1 part paraldehyde with 9 parts saline or, alternatively, with an equal mixture of peanut or olive oil.
==Industrial applications==
Paraldehyde is used in resin manufacture as an alternative to formaldehyde when making phenol formaldehyde resins. It has also found use as antimicrobial preservative, and rarely as a solvent. It has been used in the generation of aldehyde fuchsin.

<doc id="1328938" wikidata="Q2160835" url="?curid=1328938" title="Eleanor de Clare">
<text>Eleanor de Clare, &quot;suo jure&quot; 6th Lady of Glamorgan (October 1292 – 30 June 1337) was a powerful Anglo-Welsh noblewoman who married Hugh Despenser the Younger, the future favourite of Edward II of England, and was a granddaughter of Edward I of England. With her sisters, Elizabeth de Clare and Margaret de Clare, she inherited her father&#x27;s estates after the death of her brother, Gilbert de Clare, 8th Earl of Gloucester, 7th Earl of Hereford at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. She was born in 1292 at Caerphilly Castle in Glamorgan, Wales and was the eldest daughter of Gilbert de Clare, 6th Earl of Hertford, 7th Earl of Gloucester, 5th Lord of Glamorgan and Princess Joan of Acre.

==De Clare inheritance==
As a co-heiress with her sisters Elizabeth de Clare (wife of Roger d&#x27;Amory), and Margaret de Clare (wife of Hugh Audley), in 1314 she inherited the de Clare estates including the huge feudal barony of Gloucester, following the death of her brother, Gilbert de Clare, 4th Earl of Gloucester at the Battle of Bannockburn. The partition was not fully settled until 1317. During this period the family seat of Caerphilly Castle was held by the king under the stewardship of Payn de Turberville of Coity Castle. In protest against Turberville&#x27;s mistreatment, the Welsh nobleman Llywelyn Bren and his supporters launched a surprise attack on 28 January 1316, and besieged Caerphilly Castle, which successfully held out under the command of &quot;The lady of Clare&quot; (almost certainly Eleanor) and a small garrison until relieved by Sir William Montacute on 12 March 1316.

==Marriage to Hugh Despenser the younger==
In May 1306 at Westminster, Eleanor married Hugh le Despenser the Younger, the son of Hugh le Despenser, Earl of Winchester by his wife Isabella de Beauchamp, daughter of William de Beauchamp, 9th Earl of Warwick. Despenser thereby became Lord of Glamorgan. Her grandfather, King Edward I, granted Eleanor a dowry of 2,000 pounds sterling. Eleanor&#x27;s husband rose to prominence as the new favourite of her uncle, King Edward II of England. The king strongly favoured Hugh and Eleanor, visiting them often and granting them many gifts.

Eleanor&#x27;s fortunes changed drastically after the invasion in September 1326 of Edward&#x27;s estranged wife, Queen Isabella, and her lover, Roger Mortimer, who overthrew the King; two months later, her husband Hugh was convicted of high treason and subsequently hanged, drawn, and quartered.

===Issue===
By Despenser Eleanor had nine children:
#Hugh le Despenser (/9 – 8 February 1349), Baron le Despenser, who was summoned to Parliament in 1338. At his death without issue, his nephew Edward, son of his brother Edward, was created Baron le Despenser in 1357.
#Edward le Despenser ( – 30 September 1342), soldier, killed at the siege of Vannes. By his wife Anne Ferrers he was the father of Edward Despenser, Knight of the Garter, who became Baron le Despenser in a new creation of 1357.
#Isabel le Despenser, Countess of Arundel ( – aft. 1356), married, as his 1st wife, Richard Fitzalan, 10th Earl of Arundel. The marriage was annulled and their child, Edmund, was disinherited.
#Joan le Despenser ( – 15 November 1384), nun at Shaftesbury Abbey
#Gilbert le Despenser ( – April 1382).
#John le Despenser ( – June 1366).
#Eleanor le Despenser ( – February 1351), nun at Sempringham Priory
#Margaret le Despenser ( – 1337), nun at Whatton Priory
#Elizabeth le Despenser ( – 13 July 1389), married Maurice de Berkeley, 4th Baron Berkeley.

==Imprisonment==
In November 1326, Eleanor was confined to the Tower of London. The Despenser family&#x27;s fortunes also suffered with the executions of Eleanor&#x27;s husband and father-in-law. Eleanor and Hugh&#x27;s eldest son Hugh (1308–1349), who held Caerphilly Castle against the queen&#x27;s forces until the spring of 1327, was spared his life when he surrendered the castle, but he remained a prisoner until July 1331, after which he was eventually restored to royal favour. Three of Eleanor&#x27;s daughters were forcibly veiled as nuns. Only the eldest daughter, Isabel, and the youngest daughter, Elizabeth, escaped the nunnery, Isabel because she was already married and Elizabeth on account of her infancy. In February 1328 Eleanor was freed from imprisonment. In April 1328, she was restored to possession of her own lands, for which she did homage.

==Marriage to William de la Zouche==
In January 1329 Eleanor was abducted from Hanley Castle by William la Zouche, 1st Baron Zouche of Mortimer, who had been one of her first husband&#x27;s captors and who had led the siege of Caerphilly Castle. The abduction may in fact have been an elopement; in any case, Eleanor&#x27;s lands were seized by King Edward III, and the couple&#x27;s arrest was ordered. At the same time, Eleanor was accused of stealing jewels from the Tower of London. Sometime after February 1329, she was imprisoned a second time in the Tower, and was later moved to Devizes Castle. In January 1330 she was released and pardoned after agreeing to sign away the most valuable part of her share of the lucrative Clare inheritance to the crown. She could recover her lands only on payment of the enormous sum of 50,000 pounds in a single day.

Within the year, however, the young future King Edward III (Eleanor&#x27;s first cousin) overthrew Queen Isabella&#x27;s paramour, Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March, and had him executed. Eleanor was among those who benefited from the fall of Mortimer and Isabella. She petitioned Edward III for the restoration of her lands, claiming that she had signed them away after being threatened by Roger Mortimer that she would never be freed if she did not. In 1331 Edward III granted her petition &quot;to ease the king&#x27;s conscience&quot; and allowed her to recover the lands on the condition that she should pay a fine of 10,000 pounds, later reduced to 5,000 pounds, in instalments. Eleanor made part-payments of the fine, but the bulk of it was outstanding at her death.

Eleanor&#x27;s troubles were by no means over, however. After Eleanor&#x27;s marriage to Zouche, John de Grey, 1st Baron Grey de Rotherfield claimed that he had married her first. In 1333 Grey was still attempting to claim marriage to Eleanor; the case was appealed to the Pope several times. Ultimately, Zouche won the dispute and Eleanor remained with him until his death in February 1337, only a few months before Eleanor&#x27;s own death. By Zouche Eleanor had one child:
#William de la Zouche, born 1330, died after 1360, a monk at Glastonbury Abbey.

==Tewkesbury Abbey Renovations==
Hugh le Despenser the younger and Eleanor are generally credited with having begun the renovations to Tewkesbury Abbey, a foundation of her ancestors, which transformed it into one of the finest examples of the decorated style of architecture surviving today. The famous fourteenth-century stained-glass windows in the choir, which include the armour-clad figures of Eleanor&#x27;s ancestors, brother and two husbands, were most likely Eleanor&#x27;s own contribution, although she probably did not live to see them put in place. The naked kneeling woman watching the Last Judgment in the choir&#x27;s east window may represent Eleanor.

==Ancestry==
==Fictional portrayals==
Eleanor is a supporting character in &quot;Les Rois maudits&quot; (&quot;The Accursed Kings&quot;), a series of French historical novels by Maurice Druon. She was portrayed by Florence Dunoyer in the 1972 French miniseries adaptation of the series, and by Angèle Humeau in the 2005 adaptation.

Eleanor features in the 1975/1976 two-part novel, &quot;Feudal Family: The De Clares of Gloucester&quot;, by Edith Beadle Brouwer. She is the heroine of Susan Higginbotham&#x27;s 2005 historical novel &quot;The Traitor&#x27;s Wife: A Novel of the Reign of Edward II&quot;.

<text>Marquis de Vallado is a Spanish title bestowed upon Humphrey Walrond on 5 August 1653, by King Philip IV of Spain.

Walrond, from Sea, Somerset, was a distinguished Royalist commander, and subsequent Deputy Governor of Barbados. He defeated the Roundheads in the island in 1650, maintained a Royalist regime there throughout the Commonwealth and Protectorate, was appointed Deputy Governor in 1660, but continued to act as Governor until 1662.

Along with the Marquisate he was also created the Conde de Parama y Valderonda (&quot;Count of Parama and Valderonda&quot;) and a Grandee of the 1st Class. It was general practice for the eldest son of the incumbent of the title to bear the lesser and courtesy title of Conde de Parama.

The Walrond family was closely associated with the Lyons family, who monopolised the Government of Antigua during the 18th century. The 5th Marquis de Vallado married Sarah Lyons (1731-1764), and the daughter of the 5th Marquis and Sarah Lyons, Catherine Walrond, married Captain John Lyons, by whom she had had 15 children, including Edmund Lyons, 1st Baron Lyons. Therefore, Richard Lyons, 1st Viscount Lyons, the diplomat who solved the Trent Affair; Sir Algernon McLennan Lyons, Admiral of the Fleet; and Richard Lyons Pearson, Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, were all descendants of the 5th Marquis de Vallado, by Catherine Walrond, who was herself the daughter of Sarah Lyons (1731-1764).

The following is a list of those members of the Walrond family who inherited these Spanish honours:

<text>The Way of the Wiseguy, by Joseph D. Pistone (Running Press, ), is a non-fiction description of Mafia personalities and culture, published in 2004. The author, Joseph D. Pistone, spent six years undercover for the FBI infiltrating New York organized crime.

==Synopsis==
The book records psychological portraits of the personalities Pistone associated with during his years undercover. Among the many recurring themes in the book: wiseguys are not nice people, they don&#x27;t have friends (not even people they have known and worked with their whole life), and they will beat or kill you without hesitation.

Pistone relays experiences with international organized crime, as a consultant and undercover agent for Scotland Yard, and infiltrating a drug lord&#x27;s operation in a foreign country.

An audio CD is included with the book, containing actual FBI surveillance recordings of Pistone, working undercover as Donnie Brasco, and the mobster who taught him about the Mafia.

<text>Ritter Sport is a brand of chocolate bar from the family-owned Alfred Ritter GmbH &amp; Co. KG, which has its headquarters in Waldenbuch, Germany. The company was founded in 1912 by Clara and Alfred Eugen Ritter and has been family-owned ever since. Andreas Ronken has been the CEO since 2015.

Each square bar is divided into 16 smaller squares, creating a four-by-four pattern. In 2013 the company introduced a new version divided into 9 bigger squares using a three-by-three pattern. Large bars weighing and mini bars are also available, although in fewer varieties.

==History==
In 1912, Alfred (1885–1952) and Clara Ritter (1877–1959) founded a chocolate and confectionery factory in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt. Later, in 1919, it introduced its own brand of chocolate, named &quot;Alrika (Alfred Ritter Cannstatt)&quot;.

By 1926, the company had 80 employees and had bought their first company truck to transport the chocolate.
When production needs required a factory expansion in 1930, the company moved to Waldenbuch, a site a couple of miles outside Stuttgart. The chocolate brand known today, , was launched in 1932 after Clara suggested creating a chocolate bar that would fit into any sport jacket pocket without breaking but weighed the same as a normal bar. Ritter Sport replaced the Alrika brand.

The Second World War halted production and Ritter chocolates disappeared until the 1950s, when chocolate rationing was ended in West Germany. The end of chocolate rationing did not mark the end of troubles for the firm since in 1952 the company&#x27;s founder, Albert Ritter, died. His son, Alfred Otto Ritter, took over and focused the company on the chocolate square. From 1960 to 1970, sales tripled.

In 1966, Clara Ritter also died and the company was left solely in the hands of Alfred Otto. In 1964, he dispensed with many other product lines in order to focus on the square Ritter Sport bar.

The 1970s saw Ritter packaging become more colourful with a brighter unique colour assigned to each flavour. The brighter labels were seen in parallel with colour television, on which Ritter advertised. Another advance in packaging came with the snap-open pack (called the &#x27;Knick-Pack&#x27;), which Ritter marketed as &quot;practical and modern&quot;. In 1972 the company achieved sales of over 100 million DM for the first time.

After Alfred Otto Ritter&#x27;s death in 1974, the company was managed by his wife, Marta, and in 1978 the company passed into the hands of the third generation, brother and sister Alfred T. Ritter and Marli Hoppe-Ritter. Alfred Theodor Ritter and his sister Marli Hoppe-Ritter joined the advisory board, and increasingly brought social, environmental and sustainability issues into the company management. Alfred Theodor Ritter took over the chairmanship of the advisory board in 1983. In 2005, he also took over the operational chairmanship of Alfred Ritter GmbH. In 2008 the company was making a profit again. In 2015, Ritter handed over the chairmanship to the previous managing director of production and technology, Andreas Ronken, and moved to the chairmanship of the advisory board, which his sister previously held.

In 1990, they launched project(s) &quot;Cacaonica&quot;, which supports organic cocoa agriculture and reafforestation in Nicaragua, and &quot;Ritter Solar&quot;, now the European market leader of solar thermal products and large solar thermal systems. The Ritter company owns a CHP power plant, which supplies 70% of the factory&#x27;s energy needs, and since 2002 the company has been run entirely on renewable energy. The monomaterial chocolate packaging is designed to minimize its ecological footprint and is recyclable. The company has been certified to ZNU standard.

The Ritter Museum, opened in 2005, contains the collection of Marli Hoppe-Ritter, which consists of nearly 600 paintings, objects, sculptures and graphic works, a breadth of painterly and sculptural confrontation with the square form used as the design for the Ritter chocolate. The museum is an extension of the factory&#x27;s &#x27;ChocoShop&#x27;, which was opened in 2001. The museum, on Alfred-Ritter-Straße 27, is a cubical building with limestone wall covering; a 12-metre-high central open passage is meant to draw in the landscape, and the large window allows a view through the building. It was designed by Max Dudler and Susanne Raupach.

On the whole, their products are neither certified organic nor certified fair trade. However, in April 2008 they launched an organic product line called &quot;Ritter Sport Bio&quot;.

The firm celebrated its centenary in 2012 by touring 19 German cities between March and September on &#x27;the Colourful ChocoTour&#x27;. A limited-edition anniversary bar was released: Edel-Nuss Mix – Plain milk chocolate with macadamias, cashews, and almonds. Also in 2012 Ritter expanded its initiative in Nicaragua by setting up a new cocoa plantation. The first harvest was in 2017.

In 2013, Ritter opened another shop at Ravensburger Spieleland, a German theme park, and the next year Ritter&#x27;s first pop-up shop appeared in Hamburg for four months.

In 2017, Ritter released its first certified vegan bars, Dunkle Voll-Nuss Amaranth (hazelnut cream chocolate with amaranth and nuts) and Dunkle Mandel Quinoa (hazelnut cream chocolate with quinoa and almonds). As of February 2017 they were on sale only in Germany. The new releases, costing €2 each, target the growing vegan population in Germany. A third bar, Sesam (almond cream chocolate with sesame), was released in February 2020.

In July 2018, Ritter announced its intention to attempt to release the Schoko &amp; Gras variety, a milk chocolate with roasted hemp seed filling, in the United States for World Cannabis Day 2019, retitled &#x27;Choco &amp; Weed&#x27;. As of January 2019 it had yet to be approved for sale.

In 2018, Ritter released a limited edition bar made from the first viable harvest of their Nicaraguan cocoa plantation. It was limited to 30,000 bars and was available in the SchokoShop in Waldenbuch, SchokoWelt Berlin and online. 

Alongside Alfred and Marli, shareholders include their children Tobias and Tim Hoppe, as well as Moritz, Lukas and Dora Ritter. Ritter und Hoppe KG was founded in 2016, which, after changing its name to R² Holding, was gradually converted into a holding company that holds all of the company&#x27;s investments. Since 2021, it has been headed by Moritz Ritter, who withdrew from the operational business of Ritter Energie in 2020. Marli Hoppe-Ritter had left the advisory board in 2021 and was succeeded by her son Tim Hoppe.

In 2019, Ritter took over the production site in Breitenbrunn in Burgenland, Austria, from Mars Austria, establishing its first factory outside of Germany. With the acquisition, Ritter also acquired the trademark rights to the Amicelli wafer rolls as well as the discontinued products Fanfare and Banjo. In 2021, Ritter produced 2,000 tons of Amicelli. For the first time since the 1960s, Ritter had another brand in its product portfolio. In 2019, Ritter founded the subsidiary &quot;Hang zur Sonne GmbH&quot;. In the same year, Ritter founded two in-house start-ups within their subsidiary. The first was &quot;PURmacherei&quot;, which produces snacks from natural ingredients, with the two product lines CocoaWUMMS and HaferHAPS having been brought to the market. The second start-up, CacaoVida, is making drinks from cocoa fruit as well as offereing an iced tea, a lemonade and a Prosecco.

After the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the company came under criticism for continuing to hold on to its business in Russia. The Russian market accounts for about 7% of the company&#x27;s turnover. CEO Andreas Ronken pointed out that 200 jobs in Germany depended on the Russian business, and that the sale was also important for cocoa farmers in West Africa and Central and South America, who would otherwise lose their livelihoods. However, investments and marketing activities in Russia were stopped. Ritter Sport claims it is donating the profits from its Russian business to Ukraine.

== Corporate figures ==
In 2020, Ritter was represented in more than 100 countries and around 70,000 tons of chocolate were produced. Around 5,000 tons of this came from the Breitenbrunn production site. Ritter increased the share of international business: while 35 percent of sales were realized outside Germany in 2011 and 40% in 2012, the share was 58% in 2022. In 2023, the company was represented through foreign companies in the USA, Italy, Netherlands, Austria, Russia, Singapore, UK and China, had a minority stake in Denmark, a subsidiary in Nicaragua for cocoa cultivation and in France and Chile for hazelnut cultivation. In the 100-gram bar segment, it had a market share of 22.4% on the German market in 2020, just behind Mondelēz International and its Milka brand.

==Slogans==
===Motto 1===
*German packaging: &quot;Quadratisch. Praktisch. Gut.&quot; (&quot;Square. Practical. Good.&quot;)
*French packaging: &quot;Carré. Pratique. Gourmand.&quot;
*English packaging (North America &amp; Australasia): &quot;Quality. Chocolate. Squared.&quot;
*English packaging (UK-Ireland): &quot;Quality in a Square.&quot;
*Italian packaging: &quot;Quadrato. Pratico. Buono.&quot;
*Danish packaging: &quot;Kvadratisk. Praktisk. God.&quot;
*Dutch packaging: &quot;Vierkant. Makkelijk. Lekker.&quot;
*Russian packaging: &quot;Квадратный. Практичный. Хороший.&quot; (Translation of German) or &quot;Квадратиш. Практиш. Гут.&quot; (Transliteration of German)
In 2022, this motto was mocked following Ritter&#x27;s decision to continue sales to Russia. The Ukrainian ambassador to Germany used the Twitter platform to criticise Ritter, using the motto &quot;Square. Practical. Blood&quot;.

===Motto 2===
&quot;Qualität im Quadrat.&quot;

Literal translation used on English language packaging: &quot;Quality in a square.&quot; English packaging now features &quot;Quality. Chocolate. Squared.&quot; to provide a similar description. The company has defended a monopoly on square-packaged chocolate bars.

===Motto 3===
&quot;Knick Knack auf Zack.&quot;

Literal translation in English language would be: &quot;fold and snap to be prepared.&quot; The first two terms are the clicking noises that one is supposed to hear when breaking the chocolate bar twice in the middle – knick is from the German verb (to bend something), Knack means snap/click and &quot;auf Zack sein&quot; means on one&#x27;s toes / ready and waiting / prepared / set / arranged. This motto aired on German TV in the early 1990s.

===Mascot===
Ritter Sport is sometimes represented by &quot;Quadrago&quot;, a banner-carrying baby dragon. This may be partly attributed to the German word &quot;Ritter&quot; meaning &quot;Knight&quot;.

==Sustainability==
At the instigation of Marli Hoppe-Ritter, the company has been supporting organic cooperatives of cocoa-producing farmers in Nicaragua since 1990, but the majority of organic cultivation was stopped in 2013 because the varieties produced with it were unsuccessful. The chocolate manufacturer has instead set up its own cocoa plantation in Nicaragua, which claims to be the &quot;largest contiguous cocoa plantation in the world&quot;. In 2018 it was planned that a third of the required cocoa would be obtained from this plantation in Nicaragua. During his time as operational chairman from 2005 to the end of 2014, Alfred Theodore Ritter had nature-identical flavourings replaced by natural flavourings. In 2017, Ritter received the German Sustainability Award as Germany&#x27;s most sustainable medium-sized company.

In a 2022 research overview carried out by The Chocolate Collective, Ritter Sport scored 23rd out of 35 reviewed chocolate companies with respect to environmental sustainability for chocolate resourcing. The survey&#x27;s main concerns with Ritter were on deforestation to clear land for cocoa plantations and paying living wages to cocoa farmers. The survey found that the company was not leading the industry in any of the six criteria used in the comparison, but was starting to implement good policies in four of the six categories. In the 2023 report, Ritter Sport scored 2nd out of 38 reviewed chocolate companies with respect to environmental sustainability for chocolate resourcing. The survey found that the company was an industry leader in the categories of &#x27;Traceability &amp; Transparency&#x27; and &#x27;Deforestation &amp; Climate&#x27;.

== Controversies ==
In 2008, on the initiative of Alfred T. Ritter, the company&#x27;s employees working in the lowest wage groups were regrouped into slightly higher ones. At the same time, however, the company outsourced the packaging to a subcontractor that paid lower wages than the collective agreement in the confectionery industry. In January 2008, the Federal Cartel Office investigated eleven German confectionery manufacturers, triggered by a leniency application from Mars GmbH. By the beginning of 2013, fines of over 60 million euros had been imposed in four cases, including a total of 7.5 million euros against the Ritter KG.

The &quot;Voll-Nuss&quot;(Whole Nuts) variety was rated &quot;poor&quot; by Stiftung Warentest at the end of November 2013. The assessment was based on the assumption that the proven flavouring substance piperonal could not be obtained in the required quantities in a &quot;natural&quot; way. Ritter Sport referred to an affidavit of guarantee from the flavour supplier Symrise, according to which it was a natural flavour that was &quot;exclusively of natural origin&quot; and &quot;fully marketable and edible.&quot; In November 2013, Ritter Sport obtained an injunction prohibiting the foundation from claiming that Ritter Sport used chemically produced flavours in its nut chocolate. In January 2014, the Landgericht München I (Regional Court of Munich I) confirmed the decision. On 9 September 2014, the Oberlandesgericht München (Munich Higher Regional Court) also decided against Stiftung Warentest in an appeal before the court because the overall test verdict was based only on an indirect conclusion about the extraction of one of the ingredients and did not represent objectively justified criticism of the tested product. At the end of September 2014, Stiftung Warentest announced that it would recognize the judgment and not wish to continue the legal dispute.

In February 2021, Ritter Sport released a new product: Cacao Y Nada (&quot;Cocoa and Nothing&quot;). Ritter Sport advertised that the product was 100% cocoa and claimed that they could not call this product chocolate because (as the German chocolate regulations state) there is no added sugar. This claim was a marketing gimmick. The then Federal Minister for Food and Agriculture, Julia Klöckner, made it clear that Ritter Sport could call their new creation chocolate: &quot;The cocoa regulation does not limit the use of sugary ingredients to certain types of sugar. Therefore, according to our ministry, a product that uses natural cocoa juice should also be allowed to be sold under the name chocolate.&quot;

After the Russian attack on Ukraine in 2022, the company came under criticism because it continued to hold on to business in Russia. Boss Andreas Ronken pointed out that continued sales are important for cocoa farmers in West Africa and Central and South America, who would otherwise lose their livelihoods. However, investments and marketing activities in Russia have been stopped. In January 2023 it was announced that an amount of 1.51 million euros from the proceeds of the Russian business had been donated to various organizations. According to press reports, Ritter Sport is donating profits from its Russian business to Ukraine.

== Assortment ==

=== Ritter Sports ===
The company has been selling square chocolates under the Ritter Sport brand since 1932. It was responsible for over 90% of sales in 2020. Ritter did not offer products outside the brand from 1964 until 2020.

Almost all of the brand&#x27;s products are chocolate bars. The few exceptions include the chocolate rum bars introduced in 1967 as &quot;Ritter Bissen&quot;, which were first renamed &quot;Ritter Drei&quot; and then &quot;Ritter Rum&quot; in 1974. At times there were also the varieties &quot;Ritter Fresh&quot; and &quot;Ritter Nuss&quot;, and since 2021 &quot;Ritter Sport Gin&quot;. In 1988, Ritter brought the Ritter Sport Balloon bar onto the market in four different varieties, but stopped production in 1993 due to lack of success.

=== Brand presence ===
The Ritter Sport package was originally transparent with white lettering. From 1947 it was packaged in brown cellophane until Ritter introduced coloured packaging in 1974, allowing each variety to be differentiated by colour. In addition, in 1976, tubular bag packaging and the folded opening were introduced. The package allows the chocolate to be opened with a kink. The pack can be closed again using the resulting tab. Recyclable polypropylene has been used for the outer packaging since 1991.

<doc id="1328961" wikidata="Q619788" url="?curid=1328961" title="David Lascelles, 8th Earl of Harewood">
<text>David Henry George Lascelles, 8th Earl of Harewood (born 21 October 1950), styled as Viscount Lascelles until July 2011, is a British hereditary peer and film and television producer.

==Early life and earldom==
David Henry George Lascelles was born at his parents&#x27; London house, 2 Orme Square, Bayswater, London, on 21 October 1950. He is the eldest son of the 7th Earl of Harewood and his first wife, Marion Stein. He was baptised at All Saints&#x27; Church, Harewood. His father was a first cousin of Queen Elizabeth II. His godparents were The Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh (later Queen Elizabeth II), his great-grandmother Queen Mary, his great-aunt Viscountess Boyne (Margaret Hamilton-Russell), his uncle Gerald Lascelles and Benjamin Britten. At birth, he was 13th in line to the throne. As of 2025, he is 65th in line.

He is a second cousin of King Charles III and a great-grandson of King George V.

He succeeded to the Earldom of Harewood on the death of his father in July 2011.

==Career and other activities==
Lascelles is a film and television producer. He produced nine episodes of the 1990s TV detective series, &quot;Inspector Morse&quot;.

In 2007, as part of the commemoration of the bi-centenary of the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act, Lascelles was executive producer of the theatrical project by Geraldine Connor entitled &quot;Carnival Messiah&quot; that was staged in the grounds of Harewood House, which was built in the 18th century with funds from slave trading. Following Connor&#x27;s death in 2011, Lascelles organised a concert in her memory at West Yorkshire Playhouse, and he is a founder and patron of the Geraldine Connor Foundation, established in 2012 to continue her work and vision by bringing people together through arts and culture.

As Earl of Harewood, he continues the tradition begun by his father in 1961 by serving as the honorary lifetime president of Leeds United Football Club.

In April 2023 he co-founded, with former BBC journalist Laura Trevelyan and others, Heirs of Slavery, a group of descendants of people who had profited from British transatlantic slavery and wanted to make amends in the form of reparations. Other members include Charles Gladstone, who is descended from prime minister William Gladstone, and journalist Alex Renton. The group has called on the British prime minister and King Charles III to make a formal apology on behalf of the United Kingdom.

==Awards==

&quot;Inspector Morse&quot; won a BAFTA in 1992.

==Personal life==
On 12 February 1979, at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Paddington, London, Lascelles married Margaret Rosalind Messenger, Viscountess Lascelles, The Countess of Harewood daughter of Edgar Frank Messenger. The marriage was dissolved in 1989.

Their children are:
*Emily Tsering Shard (born 23 November 1975). She is unable to bear the courtesy title of &quot;Lady&quot; as her parents were not married at the time of her birth. She obtained Royal Consent from the Privy Council to marry Matthew Shard on 12 February 2008.
*Benjamin George Lascelles (born 19 September 1978), a conservationist. Although he is Lord Harewood&#x27;s eldest son, he is unable to inherit his father&#x27;s titles as his parents were not married at the time of his birth. He obtained Royal Consent from the Privy Council to marry Colombian Carolina Vélez Robledo on 18 April 2009 at Harewood House.
*Alexander Edgar Lascelles, Viscount Lascelles (born 13 May 1980). He is a chef and heir-apparent to the earldom.
*Hon. Edward David Lascelles (born 19 November 1982). He obtained Royal Consent to marry Sophie Cartlidge on 2 August 2014 in Harewood House. Edward and Sophie had a son in August 2020.

<doc id="1328965" wikidata="Q1187552" url="?curid=1328965" title="Utapau">
<text>Utapau is a planet featured in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; fictional universe. Located in the Outer Rim, it orbits a star of the same name. It is most famous for being the scene of the Battle of Utapau, marked by the duel where Obi-Wan Kenobi kills General Grievous. It is also known as the homeworld of the Grand Inquisitor of the Galactic Empire, an agent under the orders of Darth Vader.

Despite its mostly desert surface, Utapau is the home world of the Utais, Pau&#x27;ans and Amanins. Historically neutral during the major galactic conflicts, the final moments of the Clone Wars saw Utapau occupied by the Confederation of Independent Systems and then by the Galactic Empire.

The planet was created for the film &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;. It was created using a number of cinematographic disciplines, largely using computer-generated images (CGI), but also models, live-action shots and inset actors.

Utapau is also featured in the TV series &quot;The Clone Wars&quot;, in the novelisation of the film, and in a number of novels, video games and comic strips.

==Context==
The &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe is set in a galaxy that is the scene of clashes between the Jedi Knights and the Dark Lords of the Sith, people who are sensitive to the Force, a mysterious energy field that gives them parapsychic powers. The Jedi master the light side of the Force, a beneficial and defensive power, to maintain peace in the galaxy. The Sith use the dark side, a harmful and destructive power, for their own purposes and to dominate the galaxy.

Although the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order seem to have succeeded in securing peace across the galaxy, the discovery of a Sith apprentice on Naboo in 32 BBY leads Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi to take young Anakin Skywalker, who possesses a previously unseen affinity for the Force, under his wing. A war then begins between the Galactic Republic, led by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, and the secessionists of the Confederacy of Independent Systems and their droid army. As the war comes to an end, the separatist leaders are forced to retreat to the remote planet Utapau.

== Geography ==

=== Spatial location ===

Utapau is located in the Tarabba sector of the Outer Rim. The planet, in the system of the same name, orbits the star of the same name. Of the seven planets in this system, Utapau is the fourth from the star. Nine satellites orbit the planet, making it the second planet in the sector with the most natural satellites.

More specifically, it is part of the greater Sarin sector, a group of sectors including Qeimet and the surrounding areas, including Tarabba. This spatial region is the result of a military division of the galaxy made by the Galactic Republic, with each sector associated with a clone sector army. The sector army to which Utapau belongs is the 15th clone army of the Republic, also known as the &quot;Nebular Hook &quot;.

=== Topography ===
Utapau is particularly arid. Its surface is covered with desert plains. However, it is also covered by numerous chasms, faults, fossilised dunes and sinkholes. While violent winds batter the surface, the bottoms of the sinkholes shelter bodies of water, as well as a large subterranean ocean. Utapau&#x27;s nine moons exert a strong gravitational pull on the planet, giving rise to strong tides that erode the planet&#x27;s rock and cause major earthquakes.
=== Forms of life ===

==== Intelligent species ====
This planet is home to two intelligent species: the utai and the pau&#x27;ans. Collectively known as &quot;utapauns&quot;, most of them live in cities within the chasms.

The Utai make up the majority of the Utapau population. Humble by nature, they form the working class of the planet. They generally live in underground caves, thanks to their night vision. They have pedunculated eyes and are small.

The Pau&#x27;ans are nicknamed &quot;Ancients&quot; because of their long life expectancy, which is counted in centuries. Carnivores, they have sharp teeth and are large in stature. They have long limbs and no ears. Their eyes are ringed with red, while their skin is grey and cracked. They are closely related to the Utapau fauna, which they have mostly domesticated, and which they use to move around Utapau&#x27;s rugged surface, or to defend themselves. Although they are a minority on the planet, they are its ruling elite, acting as administrators, diplomats and bureaucrats. They prefer darkness to light, and raw meat to cooked meat. Despite their gruff appearance, they are peaceful and conciliatory. Cooperation between Utais and Pau&#x27;ans is essential in Utapau societies, and each species respects and appreciates members of the other.

Utapau is also home to another intelligent species, the amanins. Although they originated on Maridun, many tribes settled on the plains of Utapau, with a more primitive lifestyle, close to that of hunter-gatherers. They rarely ventured into the towns. Tall, lanky bipeds, their skin secretes a poisonous mucus, and their small mouths are filled with sharp teeth. They possess several strange abilities, such as the ability to roll into a perfect ball, enabling them to pursue their prey over long distances, or the ability to give birth to two identical individuals if cut in half.

Some of the most famous people in the Galaxy are from Utapau. One of the best-known representatives of the amanin species is the bounty hunter Amanaman, who frequented the court of the crime lord Jabba the Hutt. As for the pau&#x27;an species, one of its best-known representatives is the Grand Inquisitor of the Galactic Empire, formerly a guard at the Jedi Temple.

==== Animal species ====

In addition to the intelligent species that inhabit Utapau, several animal species are endemic to the planet.

Giant spiders, known as ginnthos, can be seen all over the rocky planet, even in the cities of the Utais. They are large, black and purple in colour, and capture their prey.

Other, more peaceful, species of animal were domesticated by the Utais, such as the varactyls, giant lizards with clawed feet that served as mounts for the peoples of the planet. Cold-blooded herbivores, they sport numerous multicoloured feathers.

Winged mounts are also used by the Pau&#x27;ans: dactillions. Similar to pterosaurs, they soar through the planet&#x27;s air using the winds that sweep across it and cling to the walls of wells using their powerful claws.

=== Living and technology ===
Despite the inhospitable surface, the inhabitants of Utapau created cities built on the walls of the underground Utapau caves. These cities grew rich mainly through mining. Precious minerals are found beneath the surface of the planet, in the large underground ocean. The Pau&#x27;ans are also experts at harnessing the wind, which they use to power their vertical cities

The planet&#x27;s main astroport is that of its capital: Pau City. During the Battle of Utapau, the administrator of this port was the pau&#x27;an Tion Medon, descendant of the man who unified the different populations of Utapau. Due to the lack of vegetation on the planet&#x27;s surface, bone is the main building material. This architectural style, known as &quot;ossic&quot;, uses the skeletons of various gigantic creatures inhabiting the subterranean ocean to construct the planet&#x27;s buildings. The bones are used in their raw state, dried or fossilised as required. Utapau&#x27;s cities, located on the surface of the large chasms covering the planet, often extend several levels below the surface. Several underground passages link the various cities together.

To make it easier for the inhabitants to get around between the planet&#x27;s crevasses, the large vertical shafts and the rocky mountainsides, Utais and Pau&#x27;ans use &quot;motor-wheels &quot;, made up of two cylindrical discs covered with toothed teeth. Generally for civilian use, a motorbike was hijacked by General Grievous for use as a combat vehicle during the Battle of Utapau. The planet also has a space defence force, managed by the administrator of Pau City.

== Official universe ==

=== Clone Wars and the Battle of Utapau ===
During the Clone Wars, the Jedi learn that a Jedi Master has been found dead in Pau City. Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker go there and discover that the Confederation of Independent Systems (CSI), an enemy of the Galactic Republic, is linked to the incident. The separatists, led by the cyborg general of the droid armies Grievous, wanted to buy a gigantic kyber crystal from Utapau, the main component of many weapons, including lightsabers. However, the two Jedi decide to destroy the crystal rather than let General Grievous escape with it. This allowed them to deprive the enemy camp of such an advantage.

In 19 BBY, in the final moments of the war, after the Battle of Coruscant and the rout of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the survivors of the Separatist Council, such as Nute Gunray and Shu Mai, temporarily fled to Utapau. The Confederation&#x27;s secret leader, Darth Sidious, then orders General Grievous to relocate the Council to Mustafar. Grievous was unable to get there, but the rest of the Council left Utapau for Mustafar.

Chancellor Palpatine, still hiding his secret identity as Darth Sidious, reveals to the Republic the location of the Separatist general and the other leaders of the organisation: the remote world of Utapau. The Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi was therefore sent there on a mission to stop Grievous. Landing in Pau City, Obi-Wan is informed of the presence of the man he is tracking by Administrator Tion Medon. Medon wants to repel the Separatist presence with the help of the Republic. The Separatists has been occupying Utapau since its recent arrival, although the planet prefers to remain neutral.

The Battle of Utapau, which takes place in the final moments of the Clone Wars, should mark the end of the war. When the Jedi arrive at Utapau to defeat Grievous, the two generals engage in a lightsaber duel that leads to a chase. While Grievous travels by wheel bike, he is chased by Obi-Wan, who has the varactyl Boga as his mount. Having lost his weapon, the Jedi grabs that of his enemy and forces his adversary to leave his vehicle. He ends the confrontation by firing a blaster at the cyborg general, destroying his armor.

Although Grievous&#x27; death seemed to mark the end of the war, the leader of the Republic army at Utapau, Commander Cody, was nevertheless ordered by Darth Sidious to betray the Jedi, who were now considered enemies of the Republic. However, Obi-Wan Kenobi, who had fallen into a crater on the planet, managed to escape the soldiers&#x27; betrayal. He then left Utapau aboard Grievous&#x27; ship, the &quot;Soulless One&quot;, to go to Coruscant.

=== After the Clone Wars ===
In 13 BBY, Pau&#x27;an Fyzen Gor, a medical student, was kidnapped by Utai pirates in Utapau. Desperate for revenge, he decides to build himself a team of droids equipped with organic limbs. Attacked and captured again by pirates, this time amanin, Fyzen Gor resigned himself to working for the pirates for three years. He then left Utapau and designed a weapon, the Phylanx, with which he attempted to take control of the galaxy.

== &quot;Legends&quot; universe ==

Following the takeover of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company, all elements told in derivative products dating prior to 26 April 2014 were declared to be outside of canon and were then grouped together as &quot;Star Wars Legends &quot;.

=== Before the imperial era ===
As major storms swept across the surface of Utapau, the Utais built underground dwellings. As the storms intensified, the Pau&#x27;ans also eventually settled in the chasms. A military defence fleet was set up, but Utapau remained as neutral as possible during the Clone Wars.

=== After the Clone Wars ===
The army of the Galactic Republic eventually occupied Utapau as the Galactic Empire emerged. The Emperor then set up one of his secret warehouses there. Initially, the planet was ruled by an Imperial leader. Later, the human Fey family took control of Utapau. Once liberated, the planet decided to join the New Republic.

== Concept and creation ==

=== Origin of the concept ===
The name of the planet Utapau appears as early as George Lucas&#x27;s first drafts, when he wrote the first draft of the narrative for &quot;Star Wars&quot;, in May 1974. The main character in this draft, Annikin, was living in hiding on a desert planet called Utapau, with his brother and father. Although the name of the desert planet was later changed to Tatooine, the original name was retained for the planet riddled with wells that served as the setting for the duel between Obi-Wan Kenobi and the separatist general Grievous.

The first sketches of the planet Utapau were made in June 2002 by Erik Tiemens, a concept artist working on &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;. The concept for the planet Utapau came from ideas that had not been used for the planet Geonosis, featured in &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;. Indeed, Erik Tiemens wanted to incorporate mud puddles or springs into this desert planet, ideas rejected by George Lucas, who wanted &quot;something dry &quot;. These ideas were nevertheless retained, and were used in the design of the Utapau planet. To complete his initial idea, Tiemens then added a surface riddled with wells and sinkholes, in which rotting water stagnated. For the architecture of the pau&#x27;ans, Tiemens drew inspiration from some of Ralph McQuarrie&#x27;s unused drawings. Like several planets in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe, Utapau&#x27;s architecture was inspired by the American architect Frank Lloyd Wright, creating a modern, technological atmosphere that is fully integrated into its natural environment.

=== Creation of the inhabitants ===
The first concepts of utapauns were those of a hairy, lemur-like species. George Lucas came up with the idea, wanting very fragile creatures in a very fragile world. Several preparatory drawings of these people were made, before the idea was abandoned. Lee Sang-jun, artist on the film &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;, then recycled a concept representing the inhabitants of the planet Mustafar, large humanoids dressed in purple robes, organised around a religious society, for the design of the Pau&#x27;ans , at the request of George Lucas, who greatly appreciated the concept. These creatures were transposed to Utapau and given a more important role in the film&#x27;s story.

The Pau&#x27;ans are created with a mixture of make-up, prosthetics and digital effects, and were always intended to be physical characters. Bruce Spence, who plays Tion Medon, reports that the make-up took over four hours to apply and over an hour to remove. Coupled with modern prosthetics, this make-up allows the actor to show more facial expressions. Although only a male version of the make-up can be seen in the film, several tests were also carried out on female versions. The utais, a smaller species than the pau&#x27;ans, are generated entirely in computer-generated images.

Boga, Obi-Wan Kenobi&#x27;s tame varactyl, was imagined and designed entirely in computer-generated images by Industrial Light &amp; Magic&#x27;s special effects department. Knowing that the animal was going to be seen up close, Kevin Reuter, supervisor of the company&#x27;s art department, decided to give it large, expressive eyes, and worked with Rob Coleman from the digital animation department to bring the creature to life. Several poses were created for the creature, to give it a powerful yet dynamic look during the chase against General Grievous. The preparatory sketches that inspired Boga are drawings by Al Williamson, who worked on the original trilogy, depicting several stormtroopers on giant lizards. Saga sound designer Ben Burtt created the varactyl sounds by combining bird chirps and a steam locomotive whistle.

=== Models and inlay ===

As with many of the planets in Revenge of the Sith, Utapau&#x27;s background is made up of a mixture of real images and computer-generated images, or &quot;digital paintings&quot;, in reference to cache painting. Most of the discussions between the administrators of Pau City and Obi-Wan Kenobi are filmed in the Fox studios in Sydney, on a blue screen, before a background is added.

The landscapes of Utapau were also created from scale models, to which digital effects were later added, under the supervision of Brian Gernand, ILM&#x27;s head of models. To give the models a three-dimensional look, this work was carried out in close collaboration with the film&#x27;s art department61. Two large scale models, at different scales, were built: one representing one of the planet&#x27;s wells, created at the two-hundredth scale and measuring 5.50 m by 1.80 m, and another reconfigurable model representing Pau City, created at the ninetieth scale and measuring 4.80 m by 7.30 m. Thousands of architectural structures were moulded before being hand-painted, then inserted around the crevices, cut out using copper engraving or a laser. The bone structures representing the architecture of Utapau are built in such a way that they can be dismantled and then reassembled in different ways to create other buildings. The entire model is covered in miniature spotlights, which highlight certain details of the buildings. Some of the bulbs measure less than a millimetre, but are needed to illuminate the model. It was filmed in two stages, first intact for the shots of Obi-Wan Kenobi&#x27;s arrival on the planet, and then after several parts of the model had been twisted, burnt and broken, for the shots of the battle.

To allow a high level of detail, the model representing Utapau&#x27;s main shaft is made entirely of foam. In order to simulate the flaked rock appearance of the shaft, wax mixed with clay was then brushed over the entire model, before a few bushes were added. Foam board models were used to obtain scale references. Several digital models are then added to complete the landscape. Inhabitants were also modelled on the basis of actors who had already been made up.

For scenes requiring interaction with CGI-generated local wildlife, actor Ewan McGregor was filmed sitting on a mechanical saddle attached to a hydraulic dial, both of which were replaced by CGI in post-production. A Komodo monitor served as the model for the animation of Boga, Obi-Wan Kenobi&#x27;s mount.

=== Incomplete adaptation in animation ===
The planet Utapau should have made an appearance in the animated series &quot;The Clone Wars&quot;. In the story arc, Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker investigate the death of another Jedi on Utapau, which leads to the discovery of a new Separatist weapon designed by General Grievous. Despite the premature end of the series, numerous concept images detailing the architecture, wildlife and inhabitants of the planet were created.

As some of the animation and dubbing of the episodes had already been done when the series was discontinued, it is possible to access the preparatory work for these episodes, which has been posted online, in order to discover the narrative framework.

== Adaptations ==

=== Video games ===
As a planet in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe, Utapau appears in several video games.

Utapau is featured in the 2005 video game adaptation of &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;, in a level where the player takes on the role of Obi-Wan Kenobi, first battling General Grievous before fleeing the planet after Order 66. Utapau is one of the terrains in which the player can fight in the 2005 game &quot;Star Wars: Battlefront II&quot;. As in the film, battle droids face off against clone troopers.

Also in 2005, Utapau is one of the planets that can be visited in &quot;Lego Star Wars: The Video Game&quot;, with a level featuring the Battle of Utapau. It also features in the game&#x27;s re-adaptations, &quot;Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga&quot; in 2007 and &quot;Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga&quot; in 2022 69,70.

=== Figurines ===
Lego produces action figures depicting scenes set in Utapau. In 2005, the box number 7255 General Grievous Chase was released. It includes a motorbike figure and one of the varactyl Boga, along with two character figures: one of Grievous and one of Obi-Wan Kenobi. The number 7656 General Grievous Starfighter, released two years later, includes as the name suggests an interceptor figure and one of Grievous. In 2014, issue 75036 Utapau Troopers was released, including a Separatist droid figure as well as four clone figures. The same year also saw the release of number 75040 General Grievous Wheel Bike. It includes a motorbike figure and two of the characters: Grievous and Obi-Wan Kenobi again note γ. Finally, in 2020, number 75286 General Grievous&#x27;s Starfighter went on sale. It includes a figure of Grievous&#x27;s ship, as well as three character figures: one of Grievous, one of Obi-Wan Kenobi and one of a clone trooper.

Several figurines featuring the inhabitants of Utapau were also marketed by Hasbro to coincide with the release of the film &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; in 2005.

In 2005, several models of Utapau were presented at a &quot;Star Wars&quot; exhibition at the Cité des sciences et de l&#x27;industrie at the Porte de la Villette in Paris.

== Reception and posterity ==
The scenes that take place in Utapau, and in particular the lines associated with them, are the source of many Internet memes. One of the most notable scenes in this situation is the one that precedes the duel between the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and the separatist Grievous. Obi-Wan&#x27;s &quot;Hello there!&quot; followed by General Grievous &quot;General Kenobi, you are a bold one&quot; is ranked as the character&#x27;s best line by the Screen Rant website. Similarly, the specialist website Comic Book Resources ranked the duel between Obi-Wan and General Grievous as the ninth best lightsaber duel in the saga.

The Allociné website describes it as &quot;a strange planet, lost in the outer rim of the galaxy&quot;. In particular, it highlights the fact that Obi-Wan decides to pursue Grievous to such an unusual world, far from the centre of the Galaxy.

The lemur-like appearance originally intended for the Utapauns was adopted for the lurmens eventually present in &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; television series.

The chase scene in which Obi-Wan rides a varactyl was also the inspiration for a similar scene in the ninth episode of the saga: &quot;Star Wars, Episode IX: The Skywalker Ascension&quot;. In the latter, Finn rides horse-like orbaks to attack the ships of the Last Order.

<doc id="1328966" wikidata="Q411447" url="?curid=1328966" title="Ofloxacin">
<text>Ofloxacin is a quinolone antibiotic useful for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections. When taken by mouth or injection into a vein, these include pneumonia, cellulitis, urinary tract infections, prostatitis, plague, and certain types of infectious diarrhea. Other uses, along with other medications, include treating multidrug resistant tuberculosis. An eye drop may be used for a superficial bacterial infection of the eye and an ear drop may be used for otitis media when a hole in the ear drum is present.
When taken by mouth, common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and rash. Other serious side effect include tendon rupture, numbness due to nerve damage, seizures, and psychosis. Use in pregnancy is typically not recommended. Ofloxacin is in the fluoroquinolone family of medications. It works by interfering with the bacterium&#x27;s DNA.
Ofloxacin was patented in 1980 and approved for medical use in 1985. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Ofloxacin is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 206th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
Ofloxacin is used in the treatment of bacterial infections such as:

*Acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
*Community-acquired pneumonia
*Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections
*Nongonococcal urethritis and cervicitis
*Epididymitis
*Mixed Infections of the urethra and cervix
*Acute pelvic inflammatory disease
*Uncomplicated cystitis
*Complicated urinary tract infections
*Prostatitis
*Acute, uncomplicated urethral and cervical gonorrhea

Ofloxacin has not been shown to be effective in the treatment of syphilis.

Fluoroquinolones, the class of drug ofloxacin belongs to, were the drug of choice for treating gonorrhea in the 1980s; However, due to the development of fluoroquinolone-resistant &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot;, fluoroquinolones were no longer used to treat gonorrhea by the late 1990s. As of 2004, the failure of single dose ofloxacin to treat gonorrhea has been reported in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. 

===Susceptible bacteria===
According to the product package insert, ofloxacin is effective against these microorganisms:

Aerobic Gram-positive microorganisms:

*&quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (methicillin-susceptible strains)
*&quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; (penicillin-susceptible strains)
*&quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;

Aerobic Gram-negative microorganisms
*&quot;Citrobacter koseri&quot; (&quot;Citrobacter diversus&quot;)
*&quot;Enterobacter aerogenes&quot;
*&quot;Escherichia coli&quot;
*&quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;
*&quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;
*&quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot;
*&quot;Proteus mirabilis&quot;
*&quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;

Other microorganisms:
*&quot;Chlamydia trachomatis&quot;

==Adverse effects==
In general, fluoroquinolones are well tolerated, with most side effects being mild to moderate. On occasion, serious adverse effects occur. Common side effects include gastrointestinal effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, as well as headache and insomnia.

The overall rate of adverse events in patients treated with fluoroquinolones is roughly similar to that seen in patients treated with other antibiotic classes. A U.S. Centers for Disease Control study found patients treated with fluoroquinolones experienced adverse events severe enough to lead to an emergency department visit more frequently than those treated with cephalosporins or macrolides, but less frequently than those treated with penicillins, clindamycin, sulfonamides, or vancomycin.

Postmarketing surveillance has revealed a variety of relatively rare but serious adverse effects associated with all members of the fluoroquinolone antibacterial class. Among these, tendon problems and exacerbation of the symptoms of the neurological disorder myasthenia gravis are the subject of &quot;black box&quot; warnings in the United States. The most severe form of tendonopathy associated with fluoroquinolone administration is tendon rupture, which in the great majority of cases involves the Achilles tendon. Younger people typically experience good recovery, but permanent disability is possible, and is more likely in older patients. The overall frequency of fluoroquinolone-associated Achilles tendon rupture in patients treated with ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin has been estimated at 17 per 100,000 treatments. Risk is substantially elevated in the elderly and in those with recent exposure to topical or systemic corticosteroid therapy. Simultaneous use of corticosteroids is present in almost one-third of quinolone-associated tendon rupture. Tendon damage may manifest during and up to a year after fluoroquinolone therapy has been completed.

Fluoroquinolones prolong the QT interval by blocking voltage-gated potassium channels. Prolongation of the QT interval can lead to &quot;torsades de pointes&quot;, a life-threatening arrhythmia, but in practice, this appears relatively uncommon in part because the most widely prescribed fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) only minimally prolong the QT interval.

&quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot;-associated diarrhea may occur in connection with the use of any antibacterial drug, especially those with a broad spectrum of activity such as clindamycin, cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones. Fluoroquinoline treatment is associated with risk similar to or less than that associated with broad spectrum cephalosporins. Fluoroquinolone administration may be associated with the acquisition and outgrowth of a particularly virulent &quot;Clostridium&quot; strain.

The US prescribing information contains a warning regarding uncommon cases of peripheral neuropathy, which can be permanent. Other nervous system effects include insomnia, restlessness, and rarely, seizure, convulsions, and psychosis Other rare and serious adverse events have been observed with varying degrees of evidence for causation.

Events that may occur in acute overdose are rare, and include kidney failure and seizure. Susceptible groups of patients, such as children and the elderly, are at greater risk of adverse reactions during therapeutic use.

Ofloxacin, like some other fluoroquinolones, may inhibit drug-metabolizing enzymes, and thereby increase blood levels of other drugs such as cyclosporine, theophylline, and warfarin, among others. These increased blood levels may result in a greater risk of side effects.

Careful monitoring of serum glucose is advised when ofloxacin or other fluorquinolones are used by people who are taking sulfonylurea antidiabetes drugs.

The concomitant administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug with a quinolone, including ofloxacin, may increase the risk of central nervous system stimulation and convulsive seizures.

The fluoroquinolones have been shown to increase the anticoagulant effect of acenocoumarol, anisindione, and dicumarol. Additionally, the risk of cardiotoxicity and arrhythmias is increased when co-administered with drugs such as dihydroquinidine barbiturate, quinidine, and quinidine barbiturate.

Current or past treatment with oral corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of Achilles tendon rupture, especially in elderly patients who are also taking the fluoroquinolones.

==Contraindications==
As noted above, under licensed use, ofloxacin is now considered to be contraindicated for the treatment of certain sexually transmitted diseases by some experts due to bacterial resistance. Caution should be used in people with liver disease. The excretion of ofloxacin may be reduced in patients with severe liver function disorders (e.g., cirrhosis with or without ascites). Ofloxacin is also considered to be contraindicated within the pediatric population, pregnancy, nursing mothers, patients with psychiatric illnesses and in patients with epilepsy or other seizure disorders.

===Pregnancy===
Ofloxacin has not been shown to have any teratogenic effects at oral doses as high as 810 mg/kg/day (11 times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m2 or 50 times based on mg/kg) and 160 mg/kg/day (four times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m2 or 10 times based on mg/kg) when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits, respectively. Additional studies in rats with oral doses up to 360 mg/kg/day (five times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m2 or 23 times based on mg/kg) demonstrated no adverse effect on late fetal development, labor, delivery, lactation, neonatal viability, or growth of the newborn. Doses equivalent to 50 and 10 times the recommended maximum human dose of ofloxacin (based on mg/kg) were fetotoxic (i.e., decreased fetal body weight and increased fetal mortality) in rats and rabbits, respectively. Minor skeletal variations were reported in rats receiving doses of 810 mg/kg/day, which is more than 10 times higher than the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m2.

There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ofloxacin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

===Children===
Oral and intravenous ofloxacin are not licensed for use in children, except as noted above, due to the risk of musculoskeletal injury. In one study, 1534 juvenile patients (age 6 months to 16 years) treated with levofloxacin as part of three efficacy trials were followed up to assess all musculoskeletal events occurring up to 12 months after treatment. At 12 months&#x27; follow-up, the cumulative incidence of musculoskeletal adverse events was 3.4%, compared to 1.8% among 893 patients treated with other antibiotics. In the levafloxacin-treated group, about two-thirds of these musculoskeletal adverse events occurred in the first 60 days, 86% were mild, 17% were moderate, and all resolved without long-term sequelae.

In a study comparing the safety and efficacy of levofloxacin to that of azithromycin or ceftriaxone in 712 children with community-acquired pneumonia, adverse events were experienced by 6% of those treated with levofloxacin and 4% of those treated with comparator antibiotics. Most of these adverse events were thought to be unrelated or doubtfully related to the levofloxacin. Two deaths were observed in the levofloxacin group, neither of which was thought to be treatment-related. Spontaneous reports to the FDA Adverse Effects Reporting System at the time of the 20 September 2011 FDA Pediatric Drugs Advisory Committee include musculoskeletal events (39, including five cases of tendon rupture) and central nervous system events (19, including five cases of seizures) as the most common spontaneous reports between April 2005 and March 2008. An estimated 130,000 pediatric prescriptions for levofloxacin were filled on behalf of 112,000 pediatric patients during that period.

==Overdose==
Limited information is available on overdose with ofloxacin. Advice for the management of an acute overdose of ofloxacin is emptying of the stomach, along with close observation, and making sure that the patient is appropriately hydrated. Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is of only limited effectiveness. Overdose may result in central nervous system toxicity, cardiovascular toxicity, tendon/articular toxicity, and hepatic toxicity as well as kidney failure and seizure. Both seizures and severe psychiatric reactions have, however, been reported to occur at therapeutic dosage.

== Pharmacokinetics ==

The bioavailability of ofloxacin in the tablet form is roughly 98% following oral administration, reaching maximum serum concentrations within one to two hours. Between 65% and 80% of an administered oral dose of ofloxacin is excreted unchanged via the kidneys within 48 hours of dosing. Therefore, elimination is mainly by renal excretion. However, 4-8% of an ofloxacin dose is excreted in the feces. This would indicate a small degree of biliary excretion, as well. Plasma elimination half-life is around 4 to 5 hours in patients and 6.4 to 7.4 hours in elderly patients.

Ofloxacin is a racemic mixture, which consists of 50% levofloxacin (the biologically active component) and 50% of its “mirror image” or enantiomer dextrofloxacin.

&quot;After multiple-dose administration of 200 mg and 300 mg doses, peak serum levels of 2.2 and 3.6 μg/ml, respectively, are predicted at steady-state. &quot;In vitro&quot;, approximately 32% of the drug in plasma is protein bound. Floxin is widely distributed to body tissues. Ofloxacin has been detected in blister fluid, cervix, lung tissue, ovary, prostatic fluid, prostatic tissue, skin, and sputum. Pyridobenzoxazine ring appears to decrease the extent of parent compound metabolism. Less than 5% is eliminated by the kidneys as desmethyl or N-oxide metabolites; 4% to 8% by feces.&quot;

A number of the endogenous compounds have been reported to be affected by ofloxacin as inhibitors, alteraters, and depletors. See the latest package insert for ofloxacin for additional details.

==Mode of action==
Ofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It functions by inhibiting two bacterial type II topoisomerases, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Topoisomerase IV is an enzyme necessary to separate (mostly in prokaryotes, in bacteria in particular) replicated DNA, thereby inhibiting bacterial cell division.

==History==
Ofloxacin is a second-generation fluoroquinolone, being a broader-spectrum analog of norfloxacin, and was synthesized and developed by scientists at Daiichi Seiyaku.

It was first approved for marketing in Japan in 1985, for oral administration, and Daiichi marketed it there under the brand name Tarvid. Daiichi, working with Johnson &amp; Johnson, obtained FDA approval in December 1990, under the brand name Floxin, labelled for use in adults with lower respiratory tract infections, skin and skin structure infections, urinary tract infections, prostatitis, and sexually transmitted diseases. By 1991, it was also marketed as Tarvid by Hoechst in the UK, Germany, Belgium, and Portugal; as Oflocet in France, Portugal, Tunisia, and several African countries by Roussel-Uclaf, as Oflocin by Glaxo in Italy, and as Flobacin by Sigma-Tau in Italy.

The market for ofloxacin was seen as difficult from its launch; it was approved as a &quot;1C&quot; drug, a new molecular entity with little or no therapeutic gain over existing therapies, and ciprofloxacin, which had a broader spectrum, was already on the market.

By 1992, an intravenous solution was approved for marketing,

In 1997, an indication for pelvic inflammatory disease was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the oral formulation, and in the same year, a solution for ear infections was approved under the brand 

Daiichi and J&amp;J also cannibalized its own market by introducing levofloxacin, the levo-enantiomer of ofloxacin, in 1996; Johnson and Johnson&#x27;s annual sales of Floxin in 2003 was about $30 million, whereas their combined sales of Levaquin/Floxin exceeded $1.15 billion in the same year. Johnson &amp; Johnson withdrew the marketing application in 2009.

==Society and culture==

===Available forms===
Ofloxacin for systemic use is available in multiple strengths as a tablet, an oral suspension, and an injectable solution. It is also used as eye drops and ear drops and is available in combination with ornidazole.

===Antibiotic use and bacterial resistance===

Resistance to ofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones may evolve rapidly, even during a course of treatment. Numerous pathogens, including &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, enterococci, and &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot; now exhibit resistance worldwide.

Floxacin and other fluoroquinolones had become the most commonly prescribed class of antibiotics to adults in 2002. Nearly half (42%) of these prescriptions were for conditions not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), such as acute bronchitis, otitis media, and acute upper respiratory tract infection.

<text>Sprowston ( or ) is a town and civil parish in the Broadland district of Norfolk, England. It is bounded by Heartsease to the east, Mousehold Heath and the suburb of New Sprowston to the south, Old Catton to the west, and by the open farmland of Beeston St Andrew to the north. It is close to Norwich. The 2021 census recorded a population of 17,126, making Sprowston the most populous civil parish in the Broadland district.

==History==

Sprowston was recorded as &quot;Sprowestuna&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086. The name is Anglo-Saxon and means &quot;the settlement belonging to Sprow&quot;; it is derived from the OE &quot;Sprow&quot; and &quot;tun&quot; (enclosure, settlement or farm).

By 1186, one Manor was held by the Mounteney family, on behalf of Sir Richard de Luci, who kept it for some 250 years; the other, held by the de Sproustons and then the Aslakes, was owned by the Bishop of Norwich.

In 1545, the Jermy family granted Mounteney Manor to John Corbet. During Kett&#x27;s rebellion in 1549, the house was broken into and looted. The army of Robert Kett encamped on nearby Mousehold Heath.

The first Sprowston Hall was built in 1560.

The Aslakes Manor passed to an eminent family of Norfolk gentry, the Calthorpes; it was related subsequently by marriage to family of Anne Boleyn). It was later sold to Sir Thomas Corbet (owner of Mounteney Manor) and, in 1592, the two Manors were united.

Monuments to the Corbet family can be found at the parish church of St Mary and St Margaret in Church Lane. The Sprowston Corbets were Royalists in the English Civil War; Thomas Corbet was knighted by Charles I at Royston. However, Sir Thomas&#x27; uncle, Miles Corbet, who was Member of Parliament for Great Yarmouth, was the last signatory to the death warrant of Charles I and was himself executed at the restoration of Charles II.

Sir Thomas Corbet became High Sheriff of Norfolk in 1612. He died without an heir and the manor of Sprowston was sold to Sir Thomas Adams, who had been Lord Mayor of London in 1645. He had given Charles II £10,000 whilst he was in exile and, in 1660, he accompanied General Monck to escort the King back to England.

Adams endowed a Professorship of Arabic at Cambridge and had the Gospels printed in Persian, which he described as &quot;throwing a stone at the head of Mahomet&quot;. Although he died in London in 1667, his body was brought to Sprowston for burial in a barrel vault excavated under the altar at St Mary and St Margaret; a large marble monument was erected above it.

In the 18th century, the manor was sold to Sir Lambert Blackwell, a governor of the South Sea Company and he was created a baronet in 1718. In the 19th century, the manor went through a number of families until it came into the hands of the Gurneys. In 1876, John Gurney, who was mayor of Norwich and blind, rebuilt Sprowston Hall. In 1885, he gave money for the building of St Cuthbert&#x27;s Church and a new vicarage to serve the development known as New Sprowston which was being built.
In 1973, Sprowston Hall was converted into a hotel and is the location of Sprowston Manor Golf Club.

During the 18th century, it is recorded that the population was less than 200, but by 1901 it had increased to 2,359.

Sprowston Mill was built in 1780 and made famous by John Crome, of the Norwich School of painting. It burnt down in 1933, a few days before it was to be handed over to the Norfolk Archaeological Trust, but is still used as a symbol by Sprowston Community High School and is depicted on the village sign. 

The artist Thomas Lound was born in Sprowston in 1801.

==Governance==
In 2011, Sprowston chose to move from a parish council to a town council, but not to have a mayor. 

==Education==

Sprowston Community High School, &quot;a mixed community comprehensive school of 1750 students&quot;, serves ages 11–18. It has an independent sixth form, having previously been part of the KETT sixth form trio.

Sprowston Community High School transitioned into an academy in 2018, becoming Sprowston Community Academy. As of 2024 it belongs to the Broad Horizons Education Trust

There are three junior schools: Falcon, Sprowston and White Woman Lane; and three infant schools: Cecil Gowing, Sparhawk and Sprowston. 

==Religion==

The town has three churches: St Mary and St Margaret&#x27;s (the Anglican parish church); St Cuthbert&#x27;s (Anglican); and the Sprowston Methodist Church.

<text>Brigadier-General Charles Mills &quot;Bud&quot; Drury (17 May 1912 – 12 January 1991) was a Canadian military officer, lawyer, civil servant, businessman and politician.

==Early life and education==
Born in Westmount, Quebec, he was the elder son of Victor Montague Drury (1884–1962), a prominent businessman who was the son of Major-General Charles William Drury (1856–1913) and the brother-in-law of Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook. He was educated at Selwyn House School and Bishop&#x27;s College School, and he later attended the Royal Military College of Canada, McGill University (B.C.L., 1936) and the University of Paris.

==Career==
Drury served in the Canadian Armed Forces from 1933 to 1936, then he practiced law from 1936 to 1939. During World War II, he was a Canadian Army officer and from March−July 1944 commanded the 4th Field Regiment of the Royal Canadian Artillery, part of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, which took part in Operation Overlord, before being made the 2nd Division&#x27;s General Staff Officer Grade 1 (GSO1) and later becoming the Commander, Royal Artillery (CRA) of the 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division. He was promoted to the rank of Brigadier-General in 1945. After the war, he headed the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration mission in Poland from 1945 to 1947.

He then entered the Canadian civil service and was appointed as deputy minister of the Department of National Defence from 1949 to 1955. He spent 1955 to 1962 working on private family business before running for election to the House of Commons of Canada.

<doc id="1329000" wikidata="Q4420058" url="?curid=1329000" title="Pompano Beach station">
<text>Pompano Beach is a Tri-Rail commuter rail station in Pompano Beach, Florida, United States. With 109,000 passengers in the first six months of 2011, it is the 10th-busiest Tri-Rail station. In 2015, the station had about 800 weekday riders.

The Pompano Beach station is located at Northwest Eighth Avenue and 35th Street, just southeast of the intersection of West Sample Road (SR 834) and Military Trail (SR 809). The station, officially opened to service January 9, 1989, offers parking. Pompano Beach was the last station not to be renovated to include better platform roofs, elevators and a pedestrian bridge over the tracks like most stations underwent during double tracking of the line, but was being rebuilt from 2015 to 2016.

==Reconstruction==
In 2011, Tri-Rail received a $5.7 million grant to renovate Pompano Beach as an environmentally sustainable station, collecting more than 100% of its energy demand through solar power, with the excess to be put on the grid. Construction was to have started in spring 2012 and finished by May 2013, but the project fell through. In December 2014, Tri-Rail&#x27;s governing board awarded a $40 million contract to Gulf Building to build a new headquarters, parking garage and station on the site of the Pompano Beach stop and on April 17, 2015, the &quot;South Florida Sun-Sentinel&quot; reported that groundbreaking was to take place later in the month. The upgrades were scheduled for completion in summer 2016. The renovation and construction of the 450-space garage caused a parking crunch at the station where only 39 spots remained.

==Station layout==
The station has two side platforms. A surface parking lot is located west of the southbound platform, while a parking garage and the SFRTA headquarters are east of the northbound platform.

<text>was an admiral in the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II.

==Biography==
Hosogaya was born to a farming family in Nozawa, Nagano prefecture in 1888. He graduated from the 36th class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in 1908. He was ranked 16th in a class of 191 cadets. As a midshipman, he was assigned to the cruiser and the battleship . On receiving his commission as ensign, he attended torpedo school and naval artillery school, and as a sub-lieutenant served on the destroyer and battleship .

He was promoted to lieutenant in 1919, and served on the destroyer , and various staff positions. After graduating from the 18th class of Naval War College in 1918 and his promotion to lieutenant commander in 1920, he served as a staff officer on the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff, and also on the martial law headquarters for the Kantō region after the Great Kanto earthquake of 1923. In 1924, Hosogaya was promoted to commander and became executive officer on the cruiser . In 1927–1928, he visited the United States and Europe, and in 1928 became executive officer on the battleship .

After his promotion to captain in 1929, he served as executive officer, and then as captain of the heavy cruiser . In 1934, he assumed command of the battleship . He was promoted to rear admiral on 15 November 1935. He was Commandant of both the Communications and Torpedo Schools during 1935–1936. After his promotion to vice admiral on 15 November 1939, he was assigned as Commander in Chief of the Ryojun Guard District. On 15 November 1940, Hosogaya was given command of the 1st China Expeditionary Fleet and on 25 July 1941, he became CINC of the 5th Fleet, a largely administrative command based at Ōminato in command of the North Pacific forces, covering the Hokkaidō-Karafuto-Kurile Islands defense area. The fleet had only light naval forces attached to it, including a couple of light cruisers and a seaplane tender.

As part of the Battle of Midway, Hosogaya directed the Battle of the Aleutian Islands and in the invasion of Attu and Kiska and the bombardment of Dutch Harbor.

On 26 March 1943, escorting two transports to reinforce Japanese-occupied Kiska in the Aleutian Islands, Hosogaya&#x27;s force, consisting of two heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and four destroyers, was intercepted near the Komandorski Islands by a U.S. Navy force, led by Rear Admiral Charles McMorris, comprising one heavy cruiser, one light cruiser and four destroyers. In the ensuing Battle of the Komandorski Islands, Hosogaya mistook shell splashes from colored dye shells for bomb splashes, and wrongly concluded he was under aerial attack. Seeking to protect his ships, he abruptly broke off the action and retreated from battle even though he had severely damaged McMorris&#x27;s flagship, the heavy cruiser .

Hosogaya&#x27;s retreat from an inferior American force was viewed as evidence of cowardice and cost him his command; he was relieved by Shiro Kawase. Later in 1943, he was assigned to the reserves. For the rest of the war, Hosogaya was based in Truk, serving as the Governor of the South Seas Mandate.

<doc id="1329017" wikidata="Q2452026" url="?curid=1329017" title="Anthony Coburn">
<text>James Anthony Coburn (10 December 1927 – 28 April 1977) was an Australian television writer and producer, who spent much of his professional career living and working in the United Kingdom. He is best remembered for writing the first &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story, &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot;.

He also wrote the stage play &quot;The Bastard Country&quot;.

==&quot;Doctor Who&quot;==
He moved to the UK around 1950, where he joined the staff of BBC Television. While working as a staff writer for the BBC in 1963 and living in Herne Bay, Kent, he became involved in the early development of the science-fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

He liaised closely with the series&#x27; first story editor, David Whitaker, on establishing the format and characters of the show, which had been initiated by various BBC drama executives before being handed on to the new production team. It is believed to have been Coburn&#x27;s idea for the Doctor&#x27;s travelling companion, Susan, to be his granddaughter, as he was disturbed by the possible sexual connotations of an old man travelling with an unrelated teenager.

Coburn wrote four full serials for the programme, &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot;, &quot;The Robots&quot; (also known as &quot;The Masters of Luxor&quot;) and two other unnamed scripts. Only &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot; was produced and it was the first ever &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial to be made, despite both Coburn and the production team&#x27;s misgivings about its prehistoric settings. &quot;The Robots&quot; was continually delayed and put back in production order, and then finally rejected – following this, Coburn severed his links with the show.

=== &quot;The Masters of Luxor&quot; ===
On 18 June 1963, Coburn was commissioned to write &quot;The Robots&quot;, which was recommissioned on 3 July. The story would see the travellers land on thirteenth-century Earth, then by the end of the month, it changed to a planet. The production team were unhappy with &quot;The Robots&quot;. So, on 23 September, they decided to switch productions with the intended fifth serial, &quot;The Daleks&quot;.

Coburn, however, turned the project and changed the story to &quot;The Masters of Luxor&quot;.

The story would see the Doctor, Ian, Barbara, and Susan landed the TARDIS on the moons of Luxor, after they find a strange light signal. They discover that the moon is dominated by robots led by &quot;The Perfect One&quot;. &quot;The Perfect One&quot; was experimenting on people to discover the secret of life – which his servants kidnap Barbara and Susan as test subjects. Meanwhile, the Doctor and Ian escape into the wilderness and awaken Tabon, the creator of &quot;The Perfect One&quot;. Tabon then confronts &quot;The Perfect One&quot; about making experimentations, causing the robots to get out of control. The robots kill Tabon, and destroy &quot;The Perfect One&quot;. Barbara and Susan are then freed and rescued by the Doctor and Ian, and then head back to the time machine.

However, the story was dropped due to schedule difficulties.

In August 1992, Titan Books released &quot;The Masters of Luxor&quot; as a Doctor Who Script Book, edited by John McElroy. In August 2012, Big Finish Productions released an audio adaptation of &quot;The Masters of Luxor&quot; by Nigel Robinson.

==Later work==
He was the co-creator of &quot;Warship&quot; with Ian Mackintosh, a popular British television drama series that centred on the Royal Navy. The programme was aired by the BBC between 1973 and 1977. A book was also published in 1973 to coincide with the series. Another of his assignments was the 1965, six-part series &quot;Heiress of Garth&quot;, based on the novel &quot;Ovington&#x27;s Bank&quot; by Stanley J. Weyman.

Coburn produced the original pilot episode of &quot;The Onedin Line&quot;; his tasks included searching many inlets and harbours before finally finding, in Dartmouth, Devon, the schooner that would be the &quot;Charlotte Rhodes&quot;.

==Death==
He died in 1977 of a heart attack while producing the second series of the BBC period drama &quot;Poldark&quot;. Prior to his death, he finished writing a science fiction disaster novel called &quot;Gargantua&quot;, the first of a planned trilogy based on a rejected BBC pitch. It was published posthumously in 1977.

In 2023 there was a proposal to install a memorial about him in his home town of Herne Bay.

<doc id="1329023" wikidata="Q751139" url="?curid=1329023" title="1977 Vrancea earthquake">
<text>The 1977 Vrancea earthquake occurred on 4 March 1977, at 21:22 local time, and was felt throughout the Balkans. It had a magnitude of 7.5, making it the second most powerful earthquake recorded in Romania in the 20th century, after the 10 November 1940 seismic event. The hypocenter was situated in the Vrancea Mountains, the most seismically active part of Romania, at a depth of 85.3 km.

The earthquake killed about 1,578 people (1,424 in Bucharest) in Romania, and wounded more than 11,300. Among the victims were actor Toma Caragiu and writers A. E. Bakonsky, Alexandru Ivasiuc and Corneliu M. Popescu. Communist ruler Nicolae Ceaușescu suspended his official visit to Nigeria and declared a state of emergency.

About 32,900 buildings were damaged or destroyed. Immediately after the earthquake, 35,000 families were without shelter. The economic losses are believed to have been as high as two billion US dollars though the sum was not confirmed by the authorities at that time. A detailed report on the destruction the earthquake caused was never published. Most of the damage was concentrated in Romania&#x27;s capital, Bucharest, where about 33 large buildings collapsed. Most of those buildings were built before World War II, and were not reinforced. After the earthquake, the Romanian government imposed tougher construction standards, and would use the earthquake as a pretext to start the major demolitions campaign in Bucharest in 1982, a campaign that lasted up to 1991.

In Bulgaria the earthquake is known as the Vrancea earthquake or Svishtov earthquake. Three blocks of flats in the Bulgarian town of Svishtov (near Zimnicea) collapsed, killing more than 100 people. Many other buildings were damaged, including the Church of the Holy Trinity. In Soviet Moldavia the earthquake destroyed and damaged many buildings; in the capital Chișinău a panic broke out.

== Damage and casualties ==
The earthquake of 4 March 1977 incurred one of the heaviest earthquake-related death tolls of the 1970s around the world. It caused the loss of 1,578 lives and injured an additional 11,221, with 90% of the fatalities being in the capital city Bucharest. The reported damage included 32,897 collapsed or demolished dwellings, 34,582 homeless families, 763 industrial units affected and many other damage in all sectors of the economy. A 1978 World Bank report estimated a total loss of US$2.048 billion, with Bucharest accounting for 70% of the total, i.e. US$1.4 billion. According to this report, out of Romania&#x27;s 40 counties, 23 were strongly affected.


=== Bucharest ===

The city center saw the greatest destruction and loss of life, since the earthquake particularly affected multi-storey buildings, mostly apartment buildings. Iconic interwar structures along the Bulevardul Nicolae Bălcescu – Bulevardul Magheru axis, such as the Algiu (popularly known as Scala), Dunărea, and Casata buildings, and the nearby Continental-Colonadelor and Nestor buildings, completely or largely collapsed, while portions of others gave way. Out of the 33 multi-story buildings that collapsed, 28 were built between 1920 and 1940, a period when earthquake-resistant design was unknown. Two buildings which collapsed were built in the communist era: a building from the Lizeanu housing complex (built in 1962) had a small section of it collapse during the earthquake because a support column was cut at one of the end sections of the building (ground floor, at a store), leading to that section eventually being demolished and mostly never rebuilt, and an apartment block in Militari named OD16 and built around 1972–1975 fully collapsed due to construction defects (at the time sub-standard concrete had been found used in the said building, and air pockets were formed in the concrete during construction, and even a boot was found in the concrete). Three public buildings, the Ministry of Metallurgy, the Faculty of Chemistry, and the Computer Center also collapsed, but were not heavily staffed at the time of the earthquake. On 5 March, the first toll of the disaster indicated 508 fatalities and 2,600 injuries. A final toll showed that 90% of the victims were from Bucharest: 1,424 deaths and 7,598 injuries.

No catastrophic fires occurred, but electrical power was lost in large areas of the city for about a day. Nine of 35 hospitals were evacuated.

=== Other Romanian cities ===
In the cities of Focșani and Buzău, unreinforced masonry walls in low-rise construction collapsed partially or totally, and there were signs of movement between structural elements and adjacent masonry in-fill walls in recently constructed buildings.

The city of Zimnicea was reported to be in ruins: 175 houses collapsed, while 523 sustained serious damage, 4,000 people were displaced, and there were hundreds of victims. In as much as 80% of the city was destroyed, Zimnicea was rebuilt from the ground. In Craiova, more than 550 buildings were severely damaged, among them the Museum of Art, the Oltenia Museum, the university and the County Library. Initial estimates indicate a total of 30 dead and 300 wounded. Vaslui also suffered heavy losses, both human – seven people dead, and material.

In Ploiești around 200 homes were destroyed, and a further 2,000 were seriously damaged; the situation was also serious in Buzău County, where about 1,900 buildings were affected. In Plopeni, a Worker&#x27;s Dormitory made of masonry totally collapsed, killing 30 to 60 workers and injuring many. Counties in Transylvania and Dobruja showed no serious damage.

The earthquake induced geomorphological phenomena in southern, eastern and northern Wallachia, as well as southern Moldavia. These consisted in landslides, liquefaction, settlements, water spurting; in the Vrancea Mountains, the course of the Zăbala River was partially blocked, forming a small natural dam lake.

=== Bulgaria ===

The earthquake of 4 March heavily impacted Bulgaria. The city of Svishtov was the most affected. Here, three blocks of flats collapsed, killing up to 120 people, among them 27 children. Many other buildings were damaged, including the Church of the Holy Trinity. In Ruse, the tremors were strong but there was little damage; only one person perished, hit by a huge architectural ornament that fell down from a nearby building.

===Soviet Moldova===
According to official data, 2,765 buildings were destroyed in the Moldavian SSR, while 20,763 buildings suffered significant damage.

=== Spatial distribution of human casualties ===


== Aftershocks ==
The earthquake epicenter was located in the south-west part of Vrancea County, the most active seismic area in Romania, at a depth of about . The shock wave was felt in almost all countries in the Balkan Peninsula, as well as the Soviet republics of Ukraine and Moldavia, albeit with a lower intensity. Seismic movement was followed by aftershocks of smaller magnitude. The strongest aftershock occurred on the morning of 5 March 1977, at 02:00 AM, at a depth of , with a magnitude was 4.9 on the Richter scale. Other aftershocks&#x27; magnitudes did not exceed 4.3 or 4.5 .

== Reactions of authorities ==
At the time of the earthquake, Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu were on an official visit to Nigeria. Ceaușescu heard about the disaster in the country from a Romanian official.

Initially, news about the earthquake were confusing, and people talked about a much larger catastrophe. Due to a power failure in Bucharest, communication services were down for several hours. The population took to the streets, scared of possible aftershocks. At that moment, authorities had not taken any concrete steps.

Residents of many damaged buildings took part in ad hoc rescue efforts. Doctors, soldiers, and many civilians helped in these rescue efforts. Nine hospitals were shut down. Floreasca Emergency Hospital in Bucharest, having been seriously damaged, was overwhelmed, and subsequently evacuated. The Dinamo Stadium was turned into a triage point for the wounded. By the morning of March 5 work was underway on reestablishing basic utilities – the water, gas, and electrical grids, as well as the phone lines.

The presidential couple and the Romanian delegation in Nigeria returned to Romania during the night of 4–5 March 1977, arriving at Otopeni Airport at 8:15am. Afterwards Nicolae Ceaușescu imposed a state of emergency throughout the country. In the following days, the Head of State conducted visits to Bucharest to assess damage.

Teams of soldiers and firefighters responsible for the rescue of possible survivors received aid from the Red Cross. They were joined by the Buftea film studio stuntmen and many volunteers. Many people were rescued from the ruins, some after several days of being trapped.

<text>Sayf al-Din Ghazi I (, died 1149) was the Emir of Mosul from 1146 to 1149, who fought in the Second Crusade. He was the eldest son of Imad al-Din Zengi of Mosul, and the elder brother of Nur ad-Din.

== Regaining control ==

In 1146 Imad al-Din Zengi was besieging the fortress of Qal&#x27;at Ja&#x27;bar when he was assassinated on September 15 by one of his servants who wanted to escape punishment. His forces were scattered, but Imad ad-Din Zengi&#x27;s two sons were able to regain control and to divide informally the empire: Sayf al-Din succeeded him in Mosul and the Jazirah (northern Iraq) while Nur al-Din succeeded in Aleppo. Saif ad-Din had first to fight to secure his position in Mosul.

Two years before, the Seljuk sultan Mahmud II had named his cadet son Alp-Arslan as overlord of Zengi, but the latter had neutralized him and carried with him at the siege. At Zengi&#x27;s death, Alp-Arslan tried to exploit the ensuing disorder to gain the power in Mosul. Two of Zengi&#x27;s advisors, the head of the diwan al-Din Muhammad Jamal and &quot;hajib &quot; Amir Salah al-Din Muhammad al-Yaghsiyani took the side of Saif ad-Din: taking advantage of the inexperience of the young Seljuk, giving Saif ad-Din the time necessary to take control of Mosul. When Alp Arslan appeared in Mosul, he was arrested and imprisoned in the citadel.

== Damascus ==
In 1148, together with his brother Nur al-Din Zengi, he marched south to help defend Damascus during the Second Crusade (see Siege of Damascus) from the Crusaders. The atabeg of the city, Mu&#x27;in ad-Din Unur, however refused them entrance, using the presence of Zangi&#x27;s sons to convince the Crusaders to release the siege.

==Death==
He died in November 1149 and was succeeded by another brother, Qutb al-Din Mawdud.

<text>Union Sportive Arlequins Perpignanais, also referred to as USA Perpignan or Perpignan, is a French professional rugby union club founded in 1933 and based in Perpignan, in the Pyrénées-Orientales department. They compete in the Top 14, France&#x27;s elite division of rugby.

The club is a result of a merger between US Perpignan and Arlequins Perpignanais in 1933. US Perpignan was also born from a union of merging clubs AS Perpignan (founded in 1902) and Stade Olympien Perpignanais, which took place in 1919.

Its home ground is the 14,593-capacity Stade Aimé Giral but important fixtures may occasionally be taken to Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys, in Barcelona. The club&#x27;s colours are sky blue, scarlet and golden yellow, which derived from the Catalan Senyera and gives Perpignan its nickname &quot;Les Sang et Or&quot; (French for &quot;The Blood and Golds&quot;).

==History==
===Early years===
One of the two merging clubs was established in 1902 as AS Perpignan. It would be in 1914 that the club would go on to make its first ever final appearance. On 3 May, Perpignan defeated Stadoceste Tarbais 8–7 at Stade des Ponts Jumeaux in Toulouse in front of 15,000 people. 19-year-old fly-half Aimé Giral converted a late try and went on to become captain. 14 months after their victory, Aimé Giral died alongside seven other members of the team at the outbreak of WW1 and, to honour their sacrifice, it was decided to colour USAP jersey like a Poilu uniform and to name the stadium after Giral.

Four years after the championship in 1914, the club was renamed as US Perpignan after a merging with Stade Olympien Perpignanais. Under the new club name, US Perpignan made it to the final of the French championship three seasons after the change. On 17 April 1921, Perpignan defeated Stade Toulousain 5–0 at Parc des Sports de Sauclières in Béziers and thus claiming their second championship. Three seasons later, the finalists of 1921 would meet again in the final of 1924, though this time Toulouse won the game 3–0 in Bordeaux.

The success continued throughout the 1920s, and following the final defeat of the 1924 season, US Perpignan were able to make it to the final of the 1925 season. They faced US Carcassonne in Narbonne, and defeated them 5–0 to win the 1925 Championship. For the third season in a row, US Perpignan made it to the final. The opponents were Stade Toulousain once again, the two sides had each defeated each other once in a final in recent years. Toulouse won 11–0 in Bordeaux. After their prominence in the mid-1920s, Perpignan&#x27;s final appearance in 1926 was their last for nearly a decade.
Perpignan&#x27;s next final appearance came in 1935 against Biarritz at Stade des Ponts Jumeaux in Toulouse on 12 May, with Biarritz winning 3–0. That season they also won the Challenge Yves du Manoir. Three seasons later Perpignan were again involved in the Championship final against Biarritz. The final was played on 8 May, and this time, Perpignan defeated Biarritz, winning 11–6 to claim their first Championship since 1921. They were also runners-up of the Challenge Yves-du-Manoir that same season as well.

The success continued throughout the late 1930s, with Perpignan again being runners-up of the Challenge Yves du Manoir in 1936. It was also the 1936 season that Biarritz and Perpignan would face off in the Championship. Both of Perpignan&#x27;s last two final appearances were against Biarritz, and both Perpignan and Biarritz had won one each against each other. The final took place on 30 April, and Biarritz turned out to be victorious, defeating Perpignan 6–0. Two years later, Perpignan were in the final of the Challenge Yves du Manoir, but became runners-up.

Their next final appearance would not be until the season of 1944. Perpignan played Aviron Bayonnais at Parc des Princes in Paris on 26 March to decide who would be the champions of France. Perpignan won, defeating Aviron Bayonnais 20–5, claiming their first Championship since 1938.

Perpignan would have to wait another eight years until they would make it to the final again. In the 1952 season, Perpignan met FC Lourdes in the final at Stadium Municipal in Toulouse, where they went down to FC Lourdes 20–11. However, both sides would meet in another final three years later to decide the 1955 Championship. This time Perpignan emerged victorious, defeating FC Lourdes 11–6 in Bordeaux. Perpignan also won the Challenge Yves du Manoir during the 1955 season, and were runners-us the following year as well.
Perpignan won the Challenge Yves du Manoir in 1965, but made their first final appearance 20 years after 1955, to decide the 1977 season Championship. They met AS Béziers in the final, who defeated Perpignan 12–4 at Parc des Princes. Perpignan won the Challenge Yves du Manoir in 1994,

===Professional era===
They would next appear in the final in 1998, where they went down to Stade Français 34–7 in Paris in front of 78,000 people.

In 2002, the club entered into a partnership with the University of Barcelona Rugby Union Club, hence renaming them USAP Barcelona, which compete in the División de Honor, the national Championship in Spain. Perpignan made it to the 2004 final, where they met Stade Français, who defeated them in the 1998 final. Stade Français won again, 38–20 at Stade de France in front of 79,722 people.

In European competition, Perpignan reached the final stage in 2003 (losing 21–17 to Toulouse in Dublin Lansdowne Road) after losing a 1999 semi-final in Toulouse Stadium against Colomiers. They were beaten in the quarter-finals in Lansdowne Road again in 2006 by eventual winners Munster.

They signed All Blacks fly-half Dan Carter, widely regarded as one of the world&#x27;s best players, on a six-month deal starting from December 2008. Carter&#x27;s stint at Perpignan, however, ended prematurely when he tore an Achilles tendon.

Their season ended by progressing into the Top 14 semi-final with a 25–21 win over Stade Français and eventually winning it with a fantastic 22–13 win over ASM Clermont Auvergne in the final. In 2010, they advanced to the final again against Clermont, but they saw &quot;Les Jaunards&quot; end decades of frustration by winning their first championship final in 11 tries.

In 2011 they signed a twinning agreement with FC Barcelona of Spain, which proposes USAP to be promoted through FC Barcelona.

<text>Michael Scott Lieberthal (born January 18, 1972) is an American former Major League Baseball catcher. He batted and threw right-handed.

In a 14-year career, Lieberthal played for the Philadelphia Phillies (–) and the Los Angeles Dodgers (). He compiled a career batting average of .274, with 150 home runs and 610 runs batted in. During his career he won the Gold Glove Award, and was twice an All Star.

His 1999 season (.300, 31 home runs, 96 RBIs, Gold Glove Award) was arguably the best ever of any Phillies catcher, and Lieberthal caught more games in his career than any other Phillies catcher (1,139). His career 149 home runs at catcher were the most in team history. Lieberthal had a .310 batting average, a .381 on-base percentage, and .510 slugging percentage lifetime against left-handed pitching.

Lieberthal was inducted into the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame on August 10, 2012.

==Early life==
Lieberthal was born in Glendale, California, and is Jewish. His father is Dennis Lieberthal, who was a Major League Baseball scout for the Detroit Tigers and San Francisco Giants (among others, he signed Gabe Kapler).

==High school and draft ==

He was an All-American catcher at Westlake High School, and graduated in 1990. Lieberthal hit four home runs in a single game for his high school: (1) a solo home run, (2) a 2-run home run, (3) a 3-run home run, and (4) a grand slam, though not in that order. Immediately after that game, Lieberthal&#x27;s team was ranked among the top 3 high school teams in the United States by &quot;USA Today&quot;, and advanced on that list to #1 a few days later. While at the high school, Lieberthal set career records for at runs (79), hits (105), and home runs (30).

Lieberthal was drafted at 17 years of age by the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1st round (3rd overall) of the 1990 Major League Baseball Draft, despite weighing only 155 pounds at the time.

==Career==

===Minor leagues===
Lieberthal played in the minor leagues from 1990–. He played for Martinsville in 1990 (Rookie League), Spartanburg (&quot;A&quot;; for which he batted .305) and Clearwater (&quot;A+&quot;) in , Reading in (&quot;AA&quot;), and Scranton/Wilkes-Barre from 1992 to 1995 (&quot;AAA&quot;).

===Philadelphia Phillies (1994–2006)===
He made his major league debut on June 30, 1994, at the age of 22 as the starting catcher against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Lieberthal recorded his first career base hit in the 4th inning against Pedro Astacio. On July 16, 1994 he hit his first home run off of Ramon Martinez in the 3rd inning of a 10–6 Phillies victory against the Dodgers.

In , he had surgery for torn cartilage in his left knee. In June , Lieberthal won Player of the Month award after batting .400, but his season was shortened by a pelvic stress fracture injury. In 1996, Lieberthal threw out 36% of runners attempting to steal. In 1997 he allowed only .64 steals per 9 innings, 3rd-best in the league. In 1999, Lieberthal led National League receivers with a .997 fielding percentage. Lieberthal caught Kevin Millwood&#x27;s no-hitter on April 27, 2003.

In , Lieberthal hit 31 home runs and 96 RBIs for the Phillies, while hitting .300 with a career-best .551 slugging percentage. He was an All Star for the first time, only the third Phillie catcher ever to receive the honor (joining Darren Daulton and Bob Boone). He also won a Gold Glove Award, after posting a .997 fielding percentage—a new Phillie record at catcher. He joined Johnny Bench, Lance Parrish, and Iván Rodríguez as the only catchers to have hit 30 home runs in the same season that they won the Gold Glove Award. He also became the eighth major league catcher to bat .300 and hit 30 homers in the same season. He also became the first Phillie to bat .300 and hit 30 home runs since Greg Luzinski, in 1977. 

In , Lieberthal was again an All-Star. A play at the plate involving a collision with Bernie Williams however, resulted in an ankle injury that knocked him out for the rest of the season. In September 2000, he had surgery to remove a bone spur in his right elbow.

In May , Lieberthal was picked off at first base and tore his ACL and MCL and cartilage in his knee while attempting to dive back to the bag. He had surgery in June, and missed the rest of the season. In October , he injured the same knee as he stepped out of a golf cart near his home. He tore the meniscus, and had surgery.

In 2002, he was selected the &quot;Sporting News&quot; NL Comeback Player of the Year, the first catcher to win it, and also was a co-winner of the Player&#x27;s Choice NL Comeback Player award.

Lieberthal never reached the playoffs while with the Phillies, being promoted to the majors the year after their World Series loss to Toronto, and leaving via free agency before their return to the postseason in 2007.

===Los Angeles Dodgers (2007)===
Lieberthal signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Dodgers on December 6, 2006. He received a $1.15 million contract, with a club option for 2008. He made more money than the Dodgers&#x27; starting catcher, All-Star Russell Martin.

After playing in only 38 games in 2007 and hitting .234, Lieberthal&#x27;s $1.4 million option was not picked up by the Dodgers, who instead bought out the contract for $100,000, and he became a free agent on October 30, 2007.

In January , Lieberthal announced his retirement. &quot;I&#x27;m done,&quot; Lieberthal said. &quot;If [the Dodgers] had picked up my option, I probably would have played 1 more year. But I didn&#x27;t want to go anywhere else. There were a lot of reasons. The money was great as a backup, but I have made [enough] money in baseball. I just didn&#x27;t want to go through what I have to go through with my body to play 20–25 games a year. It&#x27;s not worth it.&quot;

It was suggested that while it was unlikely that Lieberthal would choose to coach, enjoying golf and married life for the immediate future, he had expressed an interest in being a television analyst.

===Retirement===
On April 28, 2008, Lieberthal announced that he would sign a one-day contract with the Phillies on June 1, throw out the ceremonial first pitch and then officially retire. He would be the first Phillies player to retire in the same manner since Doug Glanville in 2005.

==Personal life==
Through 2010, Lieberthal had hit the 5th-most career home runs of any Jewish major league baseball player, behind Hank Greenberg, Shawn Green, Sid Gordon, and Al Rosen, and was 7th on the all-time list in hits (behind Gordon) and RBIs (behind Rosen). Lieberthal&#x27;s father is Jewish, and he is considered Jewish by Reform Judaism, and is also listed as such by the American Jewish Historical Society and others. The next Jewish player for the Phillies was Michael Schwimer, who debuted in 2011.

When it was pointed out to Lieberthal that he, Brad Ausmus, and Jesse Levis, were all catchers, and that Jewish kids were thought to be smarter than to subject themselves to the rigors of that position, he responded with a smile: &quot;We are smart. You don&#x27;t have to hit to catch. We don&#x27;t have to hit 40 homers. We don&#x27;t have to run. We don&#x27;t have to steal bases. All you have to do is catch, and you&#x27;ll be in this league forever. We get beat up a little bit, but it&#x27;s the quickest way to the major leagues.&quot;

Lieberthal was inducted into the So Cal Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 2015, and into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 2016.

===Film and television appearances===
Lieberthal appeared in the motion picture &quot;Summer Catch&quot; in 2001 alongside teammates Doug Glanville and Pat Burrell, as well as fellow major league baseball stars Hank Aaron, Ken Griffey Jr., and Dave Collins, among others.

A bobblehead of Lieberthal is a regularly shown, but never explained, background prop in &quot;The Office&quot;. Its inclusion may be a joke based on the name of the character Michael Scott, which is the same as Lieberthal’s first and middle names. Another reason for its inclusion may be Lieberthal&#x27;s time spent playing for the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons, since the show takes place in Scranton.

===Charitable fundraising===
In 1998, he sponsored &quot;Lieby&#x27;s VIPs&quot;, in which he purchased $30,000 worth of tickets for children with cancer, and their families. He also treated the children to a Halloween party. He served as the 2000 chairman of the Corporate Alliance for Drug Education fundraising drive.

With Doug Glanville and Randy Wolf, Lieberthal co-hosts a celebrity billiards tournament on behalf of the Philadelphia Futures mentor program.

<doc id="1329031" wikidata="Q7337287" url="?curid=1329031" title="River Cole, Wiltshire">
<text>The River Cole is a tributary of the River Thames in England which flows through Wiltshire and Oxfordshire, forming part of the border between the two counties.

== Course ==
The river rises in Swindon, east of the town centre in the Walcot area. Much of its upper course has been culverted and built over; it can be seen east of the Greenbridge retail park, which it flows through in a northeasterly direction. From there it is culverted, across to Slade Drive where it turns southeast for about three quarters of a mile. At the Piccadilly roundabout it turns abruptly east and skirts the Coleview Estate. It flows east past Covingham and under Merlin Way, through a flood marsh and out under the A419 road. It runs to the east of the town through Stratton St Margaret, South Marston and Coleshill, Oxfordshire. It joins the Thames near Lechlade from the southern bank near the A417 bridge on the reach above Buscot Lock. The river flows in part through National Trust land, with many mills adjacent to the river that have altered it by straightening and pollution.

==Restoration==

The river had become polluted and was restored in the 1990s near Coleshill, by allowing it to flow on its natural course and by redeveloping the river bed. This was intended to help increase the biodiversity of the area and of the river itself. The actions taken include raising the river bed to create natural flood meadows and floodplains, and putting in meanders to recreate a natural environment. This should also help the local population as the flood risk will decrease as a result of allowing flooding further upstream and in fields adjacent to the river. The restoration works were carried out in 1995 by the River Restoration Project as one of three EU-LIFE demonstration projects. The River Restoration Centre (previously known as the River Restoration Project) hold reports and documents detailing the restoration of the Cole.

== Flooding ==
In the heavy rains of late July 2007 the Cole burst its banks and flooded the Covingham area of Swindon, and Covingham Drive immediately to the south of the river. Extensive remedial works were carried out to reduce the risk of future flooding.

<text>Clifford O. &quot;Cliff&quot; Arnebeck, Jr. (born 15 January 1945 in Washington, D.C., USA; died 28 December 2022 in Northport, Michigan) was a national co-chair and attorney for the Alliance for Democracy.

== Early life and education ==
The son of an officer in the Bureau of Finance, Post Office Department, he graduated B.A. Wesleyan University in 1967 and received a J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1970.

== Career ==
Arnebeck first worked for Ohio Bell in Cleveland, Ohio and later in the legal department for the American Electric Power Company before joining the Jones, Day law firm in Columbus, Ohio.

He opened a private practice in Columbus. In 1990, he unsuccessfully contested the Republican Party primary election in Ohio&#x27;s 15th congressional district against 12-term congressman Chalmers Wylie.

Arnebeck was a leader in the Ohio campaign for Ross Perot&#x27;s failed 1992 presidential campaign. Questioning the micromanagement of the campaign by Perot&#x27;s staff in Houston, Arnebeck eventually challenged its legitimacy in a Washington press conference before the election. In 1996 Arnebeck ran for Congress as a Democrat against Wylie&#x27;s successor, Republican Congresswoman Deborah Pryce. and once again lost by a large margin. Disturbed at what he perceived as the behind the scenes manipulation of the political system, he filed a suit and successfully challenged the Ohio Chamber of Commerce&#x27;s financing of the campaign in 2000 to defeat Justice Alice Robie Resnick, a Democrat.

Arnebeck then sought to act as a legal watchdog during elections. The handling of the 2004 presidential election by the state administration prompted him to represent groups challenging the legitimacy of the state&#x27;s vote count in a lawsuit, known as &quot;Moss v. Bush&quot;, which was eventually dismissed by the court at the plaintiffs&#x27; request following the acceptance of Ohio&#x27;s electoral votes by the U.S. House and Senate on 6 January 2005. However, some believe that scrutiny brought by the lawsuit led to the abandonment of what they claimed was ongoing voting machine fraud. The Ohio Secretary of State filed a motion for sanction against the plaintiffs, alleging that the claim in &quot;Moss v. Bush&quot; was meritless, did not meet the standards of evidence required by law, and was brought only for partisan political purposes. The court held that Arnebeck&#x27;s allegations in the contest of the presidential election were &quot;at best, highly improbable and potentially defamatory, inflammatory, and devoid of logic,&quot; but declined to impose sanctions on Arnebeck.

Since then, Arnebeck has focused on what he claims is the fraudulent use of electronic voting machines in elections, a main issue in the 2004 suit, as the major threat to American elections. When the former George W. Bush campaign operative Michael Connell died in a 2008 light aircraft crash in Ohio after being deposed by Arnebeck in his on-going suits on the 2004 election, Arnebeck felt that Karl Rove and others in the Bush 2004 campaign might be linked to the crash. On 26 July 2016, Arnebeck posted an open letter to President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden claiming that Rove helped Hillary Clinton win the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries through voting machine hacks, assassinations, and other election fraud tactics. As of 4 August 2016, Arnebeck believes his current witnesses are at risk since he believes that at least two of his past witnesses, former state legislative candidate Beverly Campbell and Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones, were assassinated. In an interview, Arnebeck stated:

<doc id="1329051" wikidata="Q1161126" url="?curid=1329051" title="Daniel Hoan">
<text>Daniel Webster Hoan (March 12, 1881 – June 11, 1961) was an American politician who served as the 32nd Mayor of Milwaukee, Wisconsin from 1916 to 1940. A lawyer who had served as Milwaukee City Attorney from 1910 to 1916, Hoan was a prominent figure in Socialist politics and Milwaukee&#x27;s second Socialist mayor. His 24-year administration remains the longest continuous Socialist administration in United States history. A panel of 69 scholars in 1993 ranked him among the ten best mayors in American history.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Hoan was born in Waukesha, Wisconsin, on March 12, 1881, to Daniel Sr. and Margaret Augusta (née Hood) Hoan. Hoan entered the University of Wisconsin in Madison in the fall of 1901. He helped organize the University of Wisconsin Socialist Club in November 1901, a group which consisted of just four members during its first year. Hoan served as secretary of that organization for the 1902/03 academic year.

In 1908 Hoan passed the Wisconsin state bar exam and became a lawyer. A member of the Socialist Party, Hoan moved to Milwaukee where he worked closely with Victor Berger, the editor of &quot;The Milwaukee Leader&quot;, a socialist newspaper, in trying to persuade the city to adopt radical reforms. These included municipal ownership of utilities, urban renewal programs, and free legal, medical and educational services.

===Family===
On October 9, 1909, the non-religious Hoan, a member of the Knights of Pythias, married Agnes Bernice Magner (1883–1941), a devout Catholic. She was active in her husband&#x27;s political campaigns and in women&#x27;s organizations including the Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom. They had two children:
* Daniel Webster Hoan III (1910–1988)
* Agnes, later Mrs. Agnes B. Steininger (1915–1993)

Daniel Hoan, a widower since December 28, 1941, married Gladys Arthur Townsend (1901–1952), a divorced Indiana schoolteacher two decades his junior, on April 7, 1944, in Delaware, Indiana. His second wife Gladys died in 1952, leaving him a widower once again. He did not remarry.

===Political career===
Hoan began his political career with his election to city attorney for Milwaukee in 1910. He won the election by a plurality of more than 7,300 votes out of about 59,000 votes cast over Democratic and Republican opponents. This was the same year Emil Seidel was elected mayor of Milwaukee as the first socialist leader of a major city in the United States. Over the next six years, Hoan clamped down on the corruption of public officials.

In 1916 Hoan was elected as mayor of Milwaukee. He remained mayor for 24 years, the longest continuous Socialist administration in United States history. Part of the reason for Hoan&#x27;s electoral success was his break with the rest of the Socialist Party on the issue of United States entry into the First World War. The Socialist Party opposed entry; Hoan did not. Instead, as mayor, he organized the Milwaukee County Council of Defense on April 30, 1917.

As mayor, Hoan developed a reputation for honest and efficient government. He implemented progressive reforms, including the country&#x27;s first public housing project, Garden Homes, started in 1923. He also led the successful drive towards municipal ownership of the stone quarry, street lighting, sewage disposal, and water purification.

During Hoan&#x27;s administration, Milwaukee implemented the first public bus system in the United States. This was prompted by dangerous accidents: pedestrians were run over by street trolleys that ran down the middle of the road. Among the victims of such streetcar accidents was Hoan&#x27;s fellow Socialist, Victor L. Berger, who was killed in 1929.

At the May 1932 convention of the Socialist Party, Hoan ran for national chairman of the party against incumbent Morris Hillquit. In addition to the &quot;constructive Socialists&quot; from Wisconsin, Hoan garnered the support of the young Marxist &quot;militant&quot; faction and the radicals around Norman Thomas, but this bloc was insufficient to unseat Hillquit, who won reelection by a vote of 105–86.

Hoan was president of the United States Conference of Mayors in 1934 and 1935.

After ten years on the governing National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party, Hoan pointedly had his name removed from consideration at the special party convention of 1937. Although Hoan provided no formal reason, convention participants speculated in an Associated Press story which made the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot; that Hoan did not wish to be placed in the position of supporting the national organizing drive of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) in opposition to the American Federation of Labor.

Hoan was defeated in the Milwaukee mayoral campaign of 1940 and the next year left the Socialist Party and joined the Democratic Party. He ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1944 and 1946. In 1948 he was unsuccessful in his attempt to once again become mayor of Milwaukee when he was defeated by the Socialist Party&#x27;s candidate, Frank P. Zeidler. Hoan remains the last sitting mayor of Milwaukee to be defeated in a reelection bid.

A highway system was started under his administration, but federal funding was scarce. The system was later expanded to include the Hoan Bridge, which was completed in 1972 but not opened to the public until 1977.

Today, Hoan is remembered as one of the best mayors in Milwaukee&#x27;s history. A 1993 survey of historians, political scientists and urban experts conducted by Melvin G. Holli of the University of Illinois at Chicago saw Hoan ranked as the eighth-best American big-city mayor to serve between the years 1820 and 1993. In 1999, Holli wrote, 
===Death===
Hoan died on June 11, 1961, at 80 years old, from a heart ailment, in Milwaukee.

===Legacy===
Hoan&#x27;s mayoral papers reside with the Milwaukee Public Library, Milwaukee. Additional Hoan papers are located at the Milwaukee County Historical Society. The Hoan Bridge on Milwaukee&#x27;s lakefront is the most visible monument that bears his name.

<text>William Henry Green (January 27, 1824February 10, 1900), was an American scholar of the Hebrew language. He was born in Groveville, near Bordentown, New Jersey.

Green was descended in the sixth generation from Jonathan Dickinson, first president of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). His ancestors had been closely connected with the Presbyterian church. He graduated in 1840 from Lafayette College, where he was tutor in mathematics (1840–1842) and adjunct professor (1843–1844). In 1846 he graduated from Princeton Theological Seminary, and was instructor in Hebrew there from 1846 to 1849.

He was ordained in 1848 and was pastor of the Central Presbyterian church of Philadelphia from 1849 to 1851. From August 1851 until his death, in Princeton, New Jersey, aged 75, he was professor of Biblical and Oriental Literature in Princeton Theological Seminary. From 1859 the title of his chair was Oriental and Old Testament Literature.

Green was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1863.

In 1868 Green refused the presidency of Princeton College; as senior professor he was long acting head of the Theological Seminary. His &quot;Grammar of the Hebrew Language&quot; (1861, revised 1888) was a distinct improvement in method on Gesenius, Rödiger, Ewald and Nordheimer. All his knowledge of Semitic languages he used in a conservative Higher Criticism, which is maintained in the following works:

*&quot;The Pentateuch Vindicated from the Aspersions of Bishop Colenso&quot; (1863)
*&quot;Moses and the Prophets&quot; (1883)
*&quot;The Hebrew Feasts in their Relation to Recent Critical Hypotheses Concerning the Pentateuch&quot; (1885)
*&quot;The Unity of the Book of Genesis&quot; (1895)
*&quot;The Higher Criticism of the Pentateuch&quot; (1895)

Additionally, in 1890 he published a highly influential article in &quot;Bibliotheca Sacra&quot; entitled &quot;Primeval Chronology&quot; in which he strongly criticized Irish Archbishop James Ussher&#x27;s popular chronology of the world back to Creation and its association with the King James Bible:

He was the scholarly leader of the orthodox wing of American Presbyterianism, and was the moderator of the General Assembly of 1891. Green was chairman of the Old Testament committee of the Anglo-American Bible revision committee.

<text>Deerfield Beach station is a train station in Deerfield Beach, Florida. It is served by Amtrak intercity rail and Tri-Rail commuter rail trains. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Old Deerfield Beach Seaboard Air Line Railway Station.

== Station layout ==
The station has two side platforms, with parking lots on either side. Buses stop along a bus loop to the west of the southbound platform, while the station house sits adjacent to the northbound platform. A sidewalk grade crossing at the north end of the station provides access between platforms.

==History==

Located at 1300 West Hillsboro Boulevard (SR 810), just east of North Military Trail (SR 809), the station was built in 1926 by the Seaboard Air Line Railway. It shares the same Mediterranean Revival design as the Delray Beach Seaboard station and the Homestead Seaboard station. Those design features include arched entryways, arcades, stucco walls and a barrel-tiled roof. The station was placed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on April 5, 1990. It serves the nearby Boca Raton community .

The historic Seaboard Air Line Railway Station also houses the South Florida Railway Museum.

In 2010, the Florida Department of Transportation finished a restoration of the historic station. The $380,000 project included a new roof, interior improvements to the lobby and restrooms, repairs to the exterior walls and installation of new air conditioning units. On November 10, 2024, the &quot;Silver Star&quot; was merged with the as the &quot;Floridian&quot;.

<doc id="1329079" wikidata="Q782745" url="?curid=1329079" title="HorrorPops">
<text>HorrorPops are a Danish punk band that formed in 1996. The band&#x27;s sound is rooted in psychobilly, rockabilly, and punk rock.

==History==

=== 1996–1999: Formation ===
Band founders Patricia Day and Kim Nekroman first met when Day&#x27;s now-defunct band, the punk rock group Peanut Pump Gun, opened for Nekroman&#x27;s psychobilly band, Nekromantix, at the POPKOM festival in Cologne, Germany in 1996. Despite both belonging to the subculture scene of Copenhagen, Denmark, the two had never met before, but they became friends over their mutual interest in alternative music.

=== 2000–2003: Demo tape and signing ===
In 2000, Day recruited two friends, Mille and Kamilla Vanilla, co-workers at the body piercing shop she worked at to act as go-go dancers for the band&#x27;s live show. The group also recorded a 7-song demo for use in a press kit, but it was somehow leaked to the public, and resulted in two of the group&#x27;s singles, &quot;Ghouls&quot; and &quot;Psychobitches outta Hell&quot; becoming club hits in Denmark. The group spent the next few years touring Europe until 2003. During this time, Caz the Clash became a father and left the band to focus on parenting. He was replaced by another Strawberry Slaughterhouse member, Karsten. Hellcat Records, Tim Armstrong&#x27;s record label, signed HorrorPops. The band released a vinyl single in September 2003, and began a U.S. headlining tour.

HorrorPops ventured out on their first US tour as headliner for the &quot;Aloha from hell tour&quot; with nine shows across California and Arizona. They were interviewed by &quot;Vogue&quot;, and reviewed by &quot;LA Weekly&quot;.

=== 2004: Hell Yeah ===
Hell Yeah! was released February 10, 2004; the interest in the band grew and when they did their release show at Amoeba Records, it was packed, to the surprise of everyone in HorrorPops. HorrorPops was then supposed to follow up with a grand U.S. tour, but got stuck in immigration paperwork and had to cancel the whole tour. The Offspring was just about to head out on their month-long European tour and with a three-day warning HorrorPops got offered the chance to join them as main support. Horrorpops played every night for audiences numbering between 5000 and 16000 people, and then continued with their own -month headline tour in Europe. Shortly after the European tour ended, Horrorpops returned to the states to play Jimmy Kimmel Live and a few California shows, but realizing the work that lay ahead and how time-consuming the band had become, Mille had to leave the band to go back to school. Mille got replaced by another good friend of the band, Naomi, who was quickly renamed NoNo. HorrorPops started touring the states, first on Punks VS Psychos, then as main support for Lars Frederiksen and the Bastards and then back to Europe for another tour. The band toured continuously in 2004 and the band enjoyed it. The Horrorpops also played in a movie called &quot;The Punk Rock Halocust&quot; and therefore made them more popular. Later, Karsten had to leave the band; he met the love of his life and wanted to spend time with her which was hard to do with the band&#x27;s tour schedule. HorrorPops played around 110 shows in 2004 and went back to Los Angeles to start work on their second album. They played one last show for the year in West Hollywood to announce their new guitar player.

=== 2005–2008: Bring it On and Kiss Kiss Kill Kill ===
The band soon relocated from Denmark to Los Angeles, California. The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Bring It On!&quot;, was released on September 13, 2005, and featured their new rhythm guitarist, Geoff Kresge. The HorrorPops spent most of 2006 touring Canada, Asia, Europe, and the States, including a Warped Tour stint. Kresge left the group before the band&#x27;s next album, bringing the group back to three members.

Their third album, released on February 5, 2008, is called &quot;Kiss Kiss Kill Kill&quot;. The band began a North American tour around the time the album was released. They began the tour with an electric show in San Luis Obispo, CA, USA where they have a fairly loyal following, and are currently touring with two bands from Los Angeles, CA. Their opening bands include Rocket, which is an all-female band, and The Pink Spiders, a pop punk band. They are on Vans Warped Tour all summer. After the release of &quot;Kiss Kiss Kill Kill&quot; they began to have a much larger fan base.
==&#x27;Barbie doll&#x27; controversy==
On 23 December 2010, Patricia Day filed a lawsuit in an Indianapolis federal court against the Hard Rock casino, charging infringement of the right of publicity and false endorsement. In her lawsuit, the HorrorPops singer claimed Hard Rock and Mattel had been selling a Barbie doll in her image without her authorization.

Mattel and Hard Rock have released a series of rock ‘n’ roll-themed Barbies, featuring pioneering female musicians such as Debbie Harry of Blondie, Joan Jett or Cyndi Lauper. In the lawsuit it is alleged that another doll, called the “Hard Rock Café Barbie Doll&quot; or the “Rockabilly Barbie,” is made in the image of the HorrorPops lead singer but without direct acknowledgement of nor permission by Patricia Day.

==Patricia Day&#x27;s cancer battle==
On 14 March 2022, it was announced on the band&#x27;s Facebook page that Day was battling cancer and that a GoFundMe page was set up for people to donate money to help Day pay for her medical bills. &quot;If we decide to do a comeback tour after a 9-year hiatus, a pandemic will shut all shows down and remove all means of income. And of course, as the pandemic dwindles and touring starts to be possible, cancer decides to pay me a visit. Well, F Murphy and his god damn law and F cancer. I’m planning US shows for late summer &amp; fall and Europe tours for ‘23 &amp; ‘24 … and I can’t wait!!!&quot; Day said.

<doc id="1329082" wikidata="Q375106" url="?curid=1329082" title="Joseph Grimaldi">
<text>Joseph Grimaldi (18 December 1778 – 31 May 1837) was an English actor, comedian and dancer, who became the most popular English entertainer of the Regency era. In the early 19th century, he expanded the role of Clown in the harlequinade that formed part of British pantomimes, notably at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and the Sadler&#x27;s Wells and Covent Garden theatres. He became so dominant on the London comic stage that the harlequinade role of Clown became known as &quot;Joey&quot;, and both the nickname and Grimaldi&#x27;s whiteface make-up design were, and still are, used by other types of clowns. Grimaldi originated catchphrases such as &quot;Here we are again!&quot;, which continue to feature in modern pantomimes.

Born in London to an entertainer father, Grimaldi began to perform as a child, making his stage debut at Drury Lane in 1780. He became successful at the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre the following year; his first major role was as Little Clown in the pantomime &quot;The Triumph of Mirth; or, Harlequin&#x27;s Wedding&quot; in 1781, in which he starred alongside his father. After a brief schooling, he appeared in various low-budget productions and became a sought-after child performer. He took leading parts in &quot;Valentine and Orson&quot; (1794) and &quot;The Talisman; or, Harlequin Made Happy&quot; (1796), the latter of which brought him wider recognition.

Towards the end of the 1790s, Grimaldi starred in a pantomime version of &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, which confirmed his credentials as a key pantomime performer. Many productions followed, but his career at Drury Lane was becoming turbulent, and he left the theatre in 1806. In his new association with the Covent Garden theatre, he appeared at the end of the same year in Thomas John Dibdin&#x27;s &quot;Harlequin and Mother Goose; or, The Golden Egg&quot;, which included perhaps his best known portrayal of Clown. Grimaldi&#x27;s residencies at Covent Garden and Sadler&#x27;s Wells ran simultaneously, and he became known as London&#x27;s leading Clown and comic entertainer, enjoying many successes at both theatres. His popularity in London led to a demand for him to appear in provincial theatres throughout England, where he commanded large fees.

Grimaldi&#x27;s association with Sadler&#x27;s Wells came to an end in 1820, chiefly as a result of his deteriorating relationship with the theatre&#x27;s management. After numerous injuries over the years from his energetic clowning, his health was also declining rapidly, and he retired in 1823. He appeared occasionally on stage for a few years thereafter, but his performances were restricted by his worsening physical disabilities. In his last years, Grimaldi lived in relative obscurity and became a depressed, impoverished alcoholic. He outlived both his wife and his actor son, Joseph Samuel, dying at home in Islington in 1837, aged 58.

Grimaldi was born in Clare Market, in Westminster, London, into a family of dancers and comic performers. His great-grandfather, John Baptist Grimaldi, was a dentist by trade and an amateur performer, who in the 1730s moved from Italy to England. There he performed the role of Pantaloon opposite John Rich&#x27;s Harlequin. John Baptist&#x27;s son, Grimaldi&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Giovanni Battista Grimaldi, began performing at an early age and spent much of his career in Italy and France. According to Grimaldi&#x27;s biographer Andrew McConnell Stott, Giovanni was held in the Paris Bastille as the result of a scandalous performance. After his release, Giovanni moved to London in 1742, where John Baptist introduced him to John Rich; Giovanni then defrauded Rich and fled to the continent, where he later died.

Grimaldi&#x27;s father, Joseph Giuseppe Grimaldi (c. 1713–1788), an actor and dancer (known professionally as Giuseppe or &quot;the Signor&quot;), also made his way to London in around 1760. His first London appearance was at the King&#x27;s Theatre. He was later engaged by David Garrick to play Pantaloon in pantomimes at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, earning high praise, and eventually became the ballet master there. Grimaldi&#x27;s mother, Rebecca Brooker, was born in Holborn in 1764. She was apprenticed to Giuseppe Grimaldi in 1773 as a dancer and public speaker, and she became his mistress shortly afterwards, even though she was under 14 and he was about 60.

Grimaldi&#x27;s father was a serial philanderer who had at least ten children with three different women. In 1778, he divided his time between two London addresses occupied by his mistresses, Brooker and Anne Perry. Both women gave birth that year, Perry to a daughter named Henrietta and Brooker to Joseph. Although jubilant at the birth of his first son, Giuseppe Grimaldi spent little time with Brooker, living mostly with Perry, and probably maintaining other mistresses as well. Brooker raised her son alone for the first few years in Clare Market, a slum area of west London. In about 1780, Brooker gave birth to a second son, John Baptiste. Keen to set up an acting dynasty, Giuseppe left Perry and his daughter and moved with Brooker and his two sons to Little Russell Street, High Holborn. Giuseppe, who often displayed eccentric and obsessive behaviour, was a strict disciplinarian and often beat his children for disobeying his orders. A fascination with death consumed his later life; he would feign death in front of his children, so as to gauge their reactions, and he insisted on his eldest daughter, Mary, decapitating him after his death because of his fear of being buried alive, a task which earned her £5 extra in her inheritance.

===Early years at Sadler&#x27;s Wells and Drury Lane===

From the age of two, Grimaldi was taught to act the characters in the harlequinade by his father. Although he and his younger brother John Baptiste both displayed acting talent, Joseph was groomed for the London stage. He made his stage debut at the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre in late 1780, when Giuseppe took him on stage for his &quot;first bow and first tumble&quot;. On 16 April 1781, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, the manager of Drury Lane, cast both Giuseppe and Grimaldi in the pantomime &quot;The Wizard of the Silver Rocks; or, Harlequin&#x27;s Release&quot;. Sheridan employed dozens of children, including Grimaldi, as extras at Drury Lane.

On Boxing Day 1781, Grimaldi took the part of Little Clown in the pantomime &quot;The Triumph of Mirth; or, Harlequin&#x27;s Wedding&quot; at Drury Lane. It was a success for him personally, and the pantomime enjoyed an extended run until March 1782. As a result of his performance, he received further work offers from the management and became an established juvenile performer at Drury Lane. At the same time, he was a prolific performer at Sadler&#x27;s Wells where he played a host of minor roles, including monkeys, imps, fairies and demons. The Drury Lane season ran every year from September to late spring, with Sadler&#x27;s Wells playing from 15 April to the second week in October. Though the two theatres staged similar productions, they appealed to different audiences: Drury Lane to the wealthy classes of society and Sadler&#x27;s Wells to the boisterous working class. Although Grimaldi&#x27;s stage career was flourishing, Giuseppe enrolled him at Mr Ford&#x27;s Academy, a boarding school in Putney, which educated the children of theatrical performers. Although Grimaldi struggled with reading and writing, he showed a talent for art, as evidenced by some of his drawings that survive in the Harvard Theatre Collection.
Their success on the London stage allowed the Grimaldis to enjoy an affluent lifestyle in contrast to other working-class families living in Clare Market and Holborn. By the age of six, Grimaldi was considered a prominent stage performer by the press, with one critic from the &quot;Gazetteer&quot; commenting that &quot;the infant son of Grimaldi performs in an astonishing manner&quot;. One evening, Grimaldi was playing the part of a monkey and was led onto the stage by his father, who had attached a chain to Grimaldi&#x27;s waist. Giuseppe swung his young son around his head &quot;with the utmost velocity&quot;, when the chain snapped, causing young Grimaldi to land in the orchestra pit. From 1789 Grimaldi would appear alongside his siblings in an act entitled &quot;The Three Young Grimaldis&quot;.

Grimaldi&#x27;s father suffered ill health for many years and died of dropsy in 1788. As a result, at age 9, Grimaldi became the family&#x27;s principal breadwinner. Sheridan paid him an above-average wage of £1 a week at Drury Lane, and allowed his mother to work at Drury Lane as a dancer. However, the proprietors of Sadler&#x27;s Wells were less supportive, cutting Grimaldi&#x27;s pay from 15 shillings to 3 shillings a week, at which level it remained for the next three years. The loss of Giuseppe&#x27;s income and Joseph&#x27;s reduced summertime earnings meant the Grimaldis could no longer afford to keep the house in Holborn. They moved to the slum district of St. Giles, where they took lodgings with a furrier in Great Wild Street. Grimaldi&#x27;s brother, John Baptiste, illegally signed on as a cabin boy aboard a frigate in 1788, when he was nine, using a false identity. Grimaldi saw him only once more in his life.
John Philip Kemble took over the producer&#x27;s (director&#x27;s) duties at Drury Lane later in 1788 when Sheridan was promoted to chief treasurer. Sheridan often employed Grimaldi in minor roles in Kemble&#x27;s productions and continued to allow him to work concurrently at Sadler&#x27;s Wells. Grimaldi took an interest in the design and construction of stage scenery and would often help to design sets. His stage performances over the next two years did not garner him the kind of success he had experienced under the management of his father, and the role of pre-eminent Clown in London productions soon fell to Jean-Baptiste Dubois, a versatile French acrobat, horseman, singer and strongman, with a formidable repertoire of comic tricks. Grimaldi worked as Dubois&#x27; assistant, although in later life he denied that he had been the Frenchman&#x27;s student.

In 1791 the Drury Lane Theatre was demolished, and Grimaldi was loaned to the Haymarket Theatre, where he appeared, briefly, in the opera &quot;Cymon&quot;, which starred the tenor Michael Kelly. On 21 April 1794, the new Drury Lane theatre opened, and Grimaldi, now 15 years old, resumed his place as one of the principal juvenile performers. The same year, he played his first major part since his father&#x27;s death; as the dwarf in &quot;Valentine and Orson&quot;. Two years later, at Sadler&#x27;s Wells, he played the role of Hag Morad in the Thomas John Dibdin Christmas pantomime &quot;The Talisman; or, Harlequin Made Happy&quot;. The pantomime was a success, and Grimaldi received rave reviews. The Drury Lane management were eager to capitalise on his success, and later that year he was cast in &quot;Lodoiska&quot;, a Parisian hit adapted for the London stage by Kemble. Grimaldi played Camasin, a role that required the acrobatic and sword-fighting skills that he had learned as a child. He won wider admiration as Pierrot in the 1796 Christmas pantomime of &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; at Drury Lane.

Grimaldi met his future wife, Maria Hughes in 1796. The eldest daughter of the proprietor of the Sadler&#x27;s Wells theatre, Richard Hughes, Maria was introduced to Grimaldi by his mother, Rebecca Brooker, and a romance soon blossomed. They married on 11 May 1799 and moved to 37 Penton Street, Pentonville. Later that year, Grimaldi appeared in a succession of shows including &quot;A Trip to Scarborough&quot; (as a countryman) and &quot;Rule a Wife and Have a Wife&quot; (as a maid). The roles he took in these productions were eccentric and usually reserved for low comedians. Despite this, he was praised for his characterisations and was deemed a player of legitimate adult roles at Drury Lane, which qualified him to become a member of the prestigious Drury Lane Theatrical Fund.

===Last years at Drury Lane===

In 1798, Drury Lane suspended its tradition of staging an annual Christmas pantomime, which meant that Grimaldi had to seek work elsewhere during the festive period. The following year, with the help of his father-in-law, he joined the company at Sadler&#x27;s Wells, where he played roles in several Charles Dibdin plays. Grimaldi made a big impression, especially in Dibdin&#x27;s Easter 1800 pantomime, &quot;Peter Wilkins: or Harlequin in the Flying World&quot;, based on Robert Paltock&#x27;s 1751 novel. For this elaborate production, which featured two Clowns (Dubois and Grimaldi), Dibdin introduced new costume designs. Clown&#x27;s costume was &quot;garishly colourful ... patterned with large diamonds and circles, and fringed with tassels and ruffs,&quot; instead of the tatty servant&#x27;s outfit that had been used for a century. The production was a hit, and the new costume design was copied by others in London. Despite Dubois&#x27; &quot;endless bag of tricks [and] vast array of skills&quot;, his performance appeared artificial, in contrast to Grimaldi, who was better able to &quot;draw the audience into believing the essential comedic qualities&quot; of Clown.

At Drury Lane later in 1800, he starred as an officer in &quot;The Wheel of Fortune&quot; by Richard Cumberland, a Jewish pedlar in &quot;The Indian&quot;, as Clown in &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, and as the Second Gravedigger in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, alongside John Philip Kemble. Grimaldi&#x27;s wife Maria and their unborn child died during childbirth on 18 October 1800. To cope with his grief, Grimaldi would often perform two shows a night; one at Sadler&#x27;s Wells and the other at Drury Lane. One of Grimaldi&#x27;s hobbies was butterfly collecting. He accumulated as many as 4000 specimens in cabinets. In 1800 thieves broke into his home while he was away rehearsing and destroyed most of his cabinets, leading him to give up butterfly collecting and shift to pigeon rearing. Dickens described the crime as &quot;the most heartless cruelty, and ... absence of all taste for scientific pursuits.&quot;
With the Christmas season approaching, and the success of &quot;Peter Wilkins&quot; still a topic of conversation within theatrical circles, Kemble decided to stage the first Drury Lane pantomime in three years, &quot;Harlequin Amulet; or, The Magick of Mona&quot;, with Grimaldi as Punch and then as Clown, instead of Dubois. In this production, Harlequin became &quot;romantic and mercurial, instead of mischievous&quot;, leaving Grimaldi&#x27;s Clown as the &quot;undisputed agent&quot; of chaos. The pantomime was a great success, running for thirty-three performances and having a second Drury Lane season at Easter 1801; as a result, Grimaldi became recognised as one of London&#x27;s leading Clowns. Grimaldi originated the catchphrase &quot;Here we are again!&quot;, which is still used in pantomime. He also was known for the mischievous catchphrase &quot;Shall I?&quot;, which prompted audience members to respond &quot;Yes!&quot;

Grimaldi and Dubois appeared together again later that spring at Sadler&#x27;s Wells in Dibdin&#x27;s &quot;Harlequin Alchemist&quot;, which set up a mock duel between the two Clowns, with the audience deciding who could pull the most hideous face. Grimaldi consistently won. In the next piece, &quot;Harlequin Benedick; or, The Ghost of Mother Shipton&quot;. Dubois was relegated to the role of Pierrot, while Grimaldi played Clown. Grimaldi&#x27;s mother was in the cast, appearing as the Butcher&#x27;s Wife. He then appeared in another Dibdin play, &quot;The Great Devil&quot;. During the run, he accidentally injured himself on stage by shooting himself in the foot and was confined to bed for five weeks. His mother became so concerned at her son&#x27;s fragile and still grief-stricken state that she employed a dancer at Drury Lane, Mary Bristow, to care for him full-time during those weeks. They formed a close friendship, which resulted in a loving relationship, and they married on 24 December 1801.
After a falling-out with Kemble at Drury Lane, Grimaldi was dismissed and began appearing at the nearby Theatre Royal, Covent Garden. He also took up an engagement at his father-in-law&#x27;s theatre in Exeter. There was no Christmas 1801 or Easter 1802 pantomime at Drury Lane, and Kemble noticed a reduction in his theatre&#x27;s audiences. Grimaldi began to appear in provincial theatres, with the first appearance being in Rochester, Kent, in 1801. In March 1802, he returned to Kent where he performed in pantomime, earning £300 for two days work. His dismissal from Drury Lane was short-lived, and he was reinstated within a few months in a revival of &quot;Harlequin Amulet&quot;.

Sadler&#x27;s Wells closed for refurbishment at the end of its 1801 season and re-opened on 19 April 1802; Grimaldi returned to take a major role in the Easter pantomime, for which he designed the look of his recurring Clown character &quot;Joey&quot;. He began by painting a white base over his face, neck and chest before adding red triangles on the cheeks, thick eyebrows and large red lips set in a mischievous grin. Grimaldi&#x27;s design is used by many modern clowns. According to Grimaldi&#x27;s biographer Andrew McConnell Stott, it was one of the most important theatrical designs of the 1800s. Later in 1802, Dubois left the Sadler&#x27;s Wells company, making Grimaldi the sole resident Clown. Grimaldi starred in &quot;St. George, Champion of England&quot; opposite his friend Jack Bologna. This was followed by &quot;Ko and Zoa; or, the Belle Savage&quot;. A critic from &quot;The Times&quot; remarked that the pair&#x27;s death scene together was &quot;truely affecting&quot;. Bologna and Grimaldi&#x27;s on-stage partnership had by now become the most popular on the British stage; the &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot; thought they &quot;stood unrivalled&quot; compared to other acts within the harlequinade.

On 21 November 1802, his wife Mary bore Grimaldi his only child, a son, Joseph Samuel, whom they called &quot;JS&quot;. Grimaldi introduced his young son to the eccentric atmosphere at both Drury Lane and Sadler&#x27;s Wells from the age of 18 months. Although eager to have his son follow him onto the stage, Grimaldi felt that it was more important for the boy to have an education and eventually enrolled him at Mr Ford&#x27;s Academy.
Grimaldi returned to Drury Lane late in 1802 and starred in a production of &quot;Bluebeard&quot;, followed by the Christmas pantomime &quot;Love and Magic&quot;. In 1803 Grimaldi&#x27;s contract at Sadler&#x27;s Wells was extended for another three years. He starred as Rufo the Robber in &quot;Red Riding Hood&quot;, as Sir John Bull in &quot;New Broom&quot; and Aminadab in Susanna Centlivre&#x27;s &quot;A Bold Stroke for a Wife&quot;. The Napoleonic Wars had started, and the new proprietors of Sadler&#x27;s Wells and Drury Lane looked to Grimaldi to satisfy audiences eager for comic relief. &quot;Cinderella; or, the Little Glass Slipper&quot; was presented at Drury Lane on 3 January 1804. Grimaldi played the part of Pedro, a servant to Cinderella&#x27;s sisters. The production was a major success for the theatre, enhanced by Michael Kelly&#x27;s musical score; however Grimaldi and the critics grew concerned that the theatre was underusing his talents and that he was miscast in the role.

The Sadler&#x27;s Wells season commenced at Easter 1805, and Grimaldi and Jack Bologna enjoyed a successful period. Drury Lane staged the opera &quot;Lodoiska&quot;, in which Grimaldi, his mother and his wife all had starring roles. After this he was asked to choreograph John Tobin&#x27;s play, &quot;The Honey Moon&quot;, at Drury Lane on short notice. He accepted on the proviso that his wages be increased for the show&#x27;s entire run and not just until a new dancing instructor was found. The Drury Lane management agreed to pay Grimaldi £2 more per week. A few weeks into his new assignment, management appointed James D&#x27;Egville as the new ballet master. D&#x27;Egville&#x27;s debut production was &quot;Terpsichore&#x27;s Return&quot;, in which Grimaldi played Pan, a role which he considered to be one of his best assignments to date. That October, however, the theatre reduced his wages. The extra £2 that he had been promised had been deducted from his salary when &quot;Terpsichore&quot; closed, and he approached Thomas Dibdin for advice. Dibdin advised him to leave Drury Lane and to take up a residency at the nearby Covent Garden Theatre. Grimaldi wrote to Thomas Harris, the manager of the Covent Garden Theatre, hoping to persuade him to stage Christmas pantomimes. Harris was already a supporter of the shows and had employed the writing talents of both Charles Dibdin and his co-writer Charles Farley. Grimaldi met with Harris and obtained a contract. Before joining that theatre, however, he had to satisfy prior commitments at Drury Lane, appearing in the poorly received &quot;Harlequin&#x27;s Fireside&quot;.

===Covent Garden years===

In 1806, Grimaldi bought a second home, a cottage in Finchley, to which he retired between seasons. He was engaged to appear at Astley&#x27;s Amphitheatre in Dublin, in a play by Thomas Dibdin and his brother Charles. The Dibdins leased the theatre, but it was badly in need of repair. As a result audiences were small, and the show&#x27;s box-office takings suffered. Grimaldi donated his salary to help pay for the renovation of the theatre. The Dibdin company, with Grimaldi, transferred to the nearby Crow Street Theatre where they performed a benefit concert in aid of Astley&#x27;s. After two more plays, the company moved back to London.

&quot;Harlequin and the Forty Virgins&quot; opened the Easter season at Sadler&#x27;s Wells and lasted the entire season. Grimaldi sang &quot;Me and my Neddy&quot;, which proved very successful for both him and the theatre. Amid great expectations, he appeared at the Covent Garden Theatre on 9 October 1806 playing Orson opposite Charles Farley&#x27;s Valentine in Thomas Dibdin&#x27;s &quot;Valentine and Orson&quot;. Grimaldi, who considered the role of Orson to be the most physically and mentally demanding of his career, nevertheless performed the part with enthusiasm on tour in the provinces.

Perhaps the best-known of Grimaldi&#x27;s pantomimes was Thomas Dibdin&#x27;s &quot;Harlequin and Mother Goose; or, The Golden Egg&quot;, which opened on 29 December 1806 at the Covent Garden Theatre. As in most pantomimes, he played a dual role, in this case first as &quot;Bugle&quot;, a wealthy but abrasive eccentric womaniser, and after the transformation to the harlequinade, as Clown. &quot;Mother Goose&quot; was a runaway success with its London audiences and earned an extraordinary profit of £20,000. It completed a run of 111 performances over a two-year residency, a record for any London theatre production at the time. Grimaldi, however, considered the performance to be one of the worst of his career and became depressed. Critics thought differently, attributing the pantomime&#x27;s success to Grimaldi&#x27;s performance. It prompted one critic from &quot;European Magazine&quot; to write: &quot;We have not for several years witnessed a Pantomime more attractive than this: whether we consider the variety and ingenuity of the mechanical devices [or] the whim, humour, and agility of the Harlequin, Clown and Pantaloon&quot;. Kemble stated that Grimaldi had &quot;proved himself [as] the great master of his art&quot;, while the actress Mrs Jordan called him &quot;a genius ... yet unapproached&quot;. The production regularly played to packed audiences.
In September 1808, a fire at the Covent Garden theatre destroyed much of the &quot;Mother Goose&quot; scenery; the production transferred to the Haymarket Theatre where it completed its run. While Kemble and Harris raised funds and renovated Covent Garden, Grimaldi made provincial appearances in Manchester and Liverpool. The Covent Garden theatre re-opened in December 1809 with a revival of &quot;Mother Goose&quot;. In an attempt to recover the costs incurred by the rebuilding, Kemble raised the theatre&#x27;s seat prices, causing audiences to protest violently for more than two months, and the management was forced to reinstate the old prices. Grimaldi&#x27;s 1809–10 productions included &quot;Don Juan&quot;, in which he appeared as Scaramouche, and &quot;Castles in the Air&quot;, as Clown. Later in 1810, he appeared in Birmingham in a benefit performance in aid of his sister-in-law. The following year, Grimaldi sang &quot;Tippitywitchet&quot; for the first time at Sadler&#x27;s Wells in Charles Dibdin&#x27;s pantomime &quot;Bang up, or, Harlequin Prime&quot;; it became one of his most popular songs.

By 1812, despite Grimaldi&#x27;s success as a performer, he was close to bankruptcy as a result of his wife&#x27;s extravagant spending, a number of thefts by his accountant and the cost of maintaining both an idyllic country lifestyle and his son JS&#x27;s private education. The strain on Grimaldi&#x27;s finances caused him to accept as many provincial engagements as he could. That year, he travelled to Cheltenham and appeared again as Scaramouche in a revival of &quot;Don Juan&quot;. In nearby Gloucester he met the poet Lord Byron, on whose poem the play was based, at a dinner party. Byron was in awe at meeting the famous Clown, stating that he felt &quot;great and unbounded satisfaction in becoming acquainted with a man of such rare and profound talents&quot;. Grimaldi returned to London to star as Queen Ronabellyana with much success in the Covent Garden Christmas pantomime, &quot;Harlequin and the Red Dwarf; or, The Adamant Rock&quot;. After this, he increasingly played &quot;dame&quot; roles.
Sadler&#x27;s Wells opened its season in April 1814 with Grimaldi appearing in, amongst others, &quot;Kaloc; or, The Pirate Slave&quot;. That year he played the title role in &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; at Sadler&#x27;s Wells, with his young son, JS, making his stage debut as Man Friday. Other pantomimes followed at Sadler&#x27;s Wells that year, including &quot;The Talking Bird&quot;, in which he played Clown, and he also played Clown in productions at the Surrey Theatre and Covent Garden – a challenging schedule. Later in 1814, he played the title role in a revival of &quot;Don Juan&quot; at Sadler&#x27;s Wells, with JS in his second role as Scaramouche. The receipts at the box-office were unusually large and confirmed, in Grimaldi&#x27;s mind, that his son was capable of sustaining his own career. Grimaldi suffered two setbacks towards the end of the year, becoming housebound for a few months due to illness and learning of the death of his friend, mentor and former father-in-law, Richard Hughes, in December. In early 1815, Grimaldi and his son played father and son Clowns in &quot;Harlequin and Fortunio; or, Shing-Moo and Thun-Ton&quot;.

During 1815, the relationship between Grimaldi and Thomas Dibdin became strained. Dibdin, as manager at Sadler&#x27;s Wells, denied Grimaldi&#x27;s request for a month&#x27;s leave to tour the provincial theatres. Dibdin was annoyed at the tolerant attitude Grimaldi displayed in his position as the Chief Judge and Treasurer of the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Court of Rectitude, a body set up to regulate the behaviour of performers. Grimaldi briefly left Sadler&#x27;s Wells in 1815 to conduct a tour of the northern provincial theatres. Alongside Jack Bologna, he staged fifty-six shows during the summer months and earned £1,743, a much higher amount than he earned at Sadler&#x27;s Wells. Dibdin was struggling, and after the tour Grimaldi used the problems at Sadler&#x27;s Wells to negotiate a lucrative contract. Dibdin agreed to a salary increase but bristled at Grimaldi&#x27;s other demands and eventually gave the position of resident Clown to the little-known Signor Paulo.

===Later career===
In 1815, Grimaldi played Clown in &quot;Harlequin and the Sylph of the Oak; or, The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green&quot; at Covent Garden, followed by the Christmas pantomime &quot;Robinson Crusoe; or, The Bold Buccaneer&quot;, in which he played Friday to Charles Farley&#x27;s title character. Grimaldi conducted a remunerative but gruelling tour to Scotland, Manchester and Liverpool in 1818. He sustained bruising and strains from two falls, the second of which left him briefly unable to walk. He and Mary moved to 56 Exmouth Market, Islington, where he recovered from his injuries before going on tour with his son.
At Easter 1819, in &quot;The Talking Bird, or, Perizade Columbine&quot;, he introduced perhaps his best known song &quot;Hot Codlins&quot;, an audience participation song about a seller of roasted apples who gets drunk on gin while working the streets of London. Songs about trades were popular on the stage in the 1800s. Grimaldi sought inspiration for the character of the apple seller by walking around the streets of London and observing real-life tradespeople.

Despite Signor Paulo&#x27;s success at Sadler&#x27;s Wells, Richard Hughes&#x27;s widow Lucy, who was a majority shareholder at the theatre, pleaded with Grimaldi to return. He agreed on the conditions that he was sold an eighth share in the theatre, remained the resident Clown and received a salary of 12 guineas a week. She agreed to his terms, and he took the part of Grimaldicat in the 1818 Easter pantomime &quot;The Marquis De Carabas; or, Puss in Boots&quot;. The show was a disaster and closed after one night. Grimaldi was booed off the stage after an impromptu joke (eating a prop mouse) upset the audience and caused two female audience members to fight in the auditorium. The audience was also angry at Grimaldi&#x27;s weak performance; later he felt that this marked the beginning of his career&#x27;s decline. Dibdin left Sadler&#x27;s Wells that year; his fortunes changed rapidly for the worse, and he spent time in a debtors&#x27; prison. Grimaldi&#x27;s debut as a theatre proprietor was also a failure. Although Jack Bologna, Mary, JS and Bologna&#x27;s wife Louisa were all cast in Grimaldi&#x27;s only commissioned pantomime, &quot;The Fates; or, Harlequin&#x27;s Holy Day&quot;, he had underestimated the amount of work required to run a theatre, and the strain of management hastened the already rapid deterioration in his health.

The shares in Sadler&#x27;s Wells were sold, with Grimaldi&#x27;s going to Daniel Egerton. Egerton wanted to keep Grimaldi on the payroll but proposed loaning him to other theatres. Grimaldi refused a contract on these terms and instead appeared alongside JS in a few engagements in Ireland. During the Easter season of 1820, Grimaldi appeared at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, in &quot;Harlequin and Cinderella; or, the Little Glass Slipper&quot;. Grimaldi played the wife of the lead character Baron Pomposini; the role was probably an early example of a pantomime dame. In the latter months of 1820, Grimaldi&#x27;s health worsened, and he suffered frequent emotional breakdowns, gastric spasms, breathlessness and severe rheumatoid pain. These ailments did not affect his desire to perform. That September he appeared at Covent Garden, as Kasrac in &quot;Aladdin&quot; followed by the Christmas pantomime &quot;Harlequin and Friar Bacon&quot;; the pantomime was particularly successful.

In May 1821, Grimaldi collapsed after a performance of &quot;Undine; or, the Spirit of the Waters&quot;. Doctors diagnosed him as suffering from &quot;premature old age&quot;. JS took over his father&#x27;s role and completed the remainder of the show&#x27;s run. Now acting as an official understudy, JS filled many of his father&#x27;s other theatrical engagements, including a rerun of &quot;Harlequin and Mother Bunch; or, the Yellow Dwarf&quot;, in which he caused a scandal by threatening and verbally abusing a heckler in the audience. In the early 1820s, Grimaldi made a brief recovery and held a six-week engagement at the Coburg Theatre where he appeared as Clown in &quot;Salmagundi; or, the Clown&#x27;s Dish of All Sorts&quot;; a pantomime which ran for a week before being replaced by &quot;Disputes in China; or, Harlequin and the Hong Merchants&quot;. Both productions were successful, but Grimaldi was taken ill half way through the latter&#x27;s run.

In 1822, Grimaldi travelled to Cheltenham, in poor health, to fulfil an engagement as Clown by another actor in &quot;Harlequin and the Ogress; or, the Sleeping Beauty in the Wood&quot;. Despite the rehearsals being cut short due to Grimaldi&#x27;s rapidly deteriorating health, critics praised his performances.

===Last years and death===

Grimaldi retired from the stage in 1823 as a result of ill health. The years of extreme physical exertion his clowning had involved had taken a toll on his joints, and he suffered from a respiratory condition that often left him breathless. &quot;The Times&quot; noted in 1813:

Although officially retired, Grimaldi still received half of his former small salary from Drury Lane until 1824. Soon after the fee stopped, Grimaldi fell into poverty after a number of ill-conceived business ventures and because he had entrusted management of his provincial earnings to people who cheated him. Despite his disabilities, he offered his services as a cameo performer in Christmas pantomimes. Along with Bologna, in 1827 he reappeared briefly at Sadler&#x27;s Wells where he gave some acting instruction to the mime artist William Payne, the future father of the Payne Brothers. He also started working for Richard Brinsley Peake, namesake of Richard Brinsley Sheridan, who was the dramaturge at the English Opera House. Peake hired Grimaldi to star in &quot;Monkey Island&quot; alongside his son JS. However, Grimaldi&#x27;s health deteriorated further and he was forced to quit before the show opened; his scene was cut. The early end to his career, worries about money, and the uncertainty over his son&#x27;s future made him increasingly depressed. To make light of it, he would often joke about his condition: &quot;I make you laugh at night but am Grim-all-day&quot;. In 1828, two &quot;farewell&quot; benefit performances were held for him. In the first, he appeared as Hock the German soldier and a drunken sailor in Thomas Dibdin&#x27;s melodrama &quot;The Sixes; or, The Fiends&quot; at Sadler&#x27;s Wells to an audience of 2,000 people. Unable to stand for long periods of time, he sang a duet with JS and finished the evening with a scene from &quot;Mother Goose&quot;. His last farewell benefit performance on 27 June 1828 was at Drury Lane. Between 1828 and 1836, Grimaldi relied on charity benefits to replace his lost income.
The relationship between Grimaldi and his son first became strained during the early 1820s. JS, who had made a career of emulating his father&#x27;s act, received favourable notices as Clown, but his success was constantly overshadowed by that of his father. He became resentful of his father and publicly shunned any association with him. JS became an alcoholic and was increasingly unreliable. In 1823, he became estranged from his parents, who saw their son only occasionally over the next four years, as JS went out of his way to avoid them. They communicated only through letters, with Grimaldi often sending his son notes begging for money. JS once replied: &quot;At present I am in difficulties; but as long as I have a shilling you shall have half&quot;. However, there is no record of him ever sending money to his father. JS finally returned home in 1827, when the Grimaldis were awakened one night to discover their son standing in the street, feverish, emaciated and dishevelled.

After appearing in a few Christmas pantomimes and benefits for his father, JS fell into unemployment and was incarcerated in a debtors&#x27; prison for a time; his alcoholism also further worsened. In 1832, Grimaldi, Mary and their son moved to Woolwich, but JS often abused his parents&#x27; hospitality by bringing home prostitutes and fighting in the house with his alcoholic friends. He moved out later that year and died at his lodgings on 11 December 1832, aged 30. With Grimaldi almost crippled, and Mary having suffered a stroke days before JS&#x27;s death, they made a suicide pact. They took some poison, but the only result was a long bout of stomach cramps. Dismayed at their failure, they abandoned the idea of suicide.

Mary died in 1834, and Grimaldi moved to 33 Southampton Street, Islington, where he spent the last few years of his life alone as a depressed alcoholic. On 31 May 1837 he complained of a tightening of the chest but recuperated enough to attend his local public house, The Marquis of Cornwallis, where he spent a convivial evening entertaining fellow patrons and drinking to excess. He returned home that evening and was found dead in bed by his housekeeper the following morning. The coroner recorded that he had &quot;died by the visitation of God&quot;. Grimaldi was buried in St. James&#x27;s Churchyard, Pentonville, on 5 June 1837. The burial site and the area around it was later named Joseph Grimaldi Park.

==Legacy and reputation==

After Grimaldi&#x27;s death, Charles Dickens was invited by Richard Bentley to edit and improve Thomas Egerton Wilks&#x27;s clumsily written life of Grimaldi, which had been based on the clown&#x27;s own notes, which Dickens did under his regular , &quot;Boz&quot;. As a child, Dickens saw Grimaldi perform at the Star Theatre, Rochester, in 1820. The &quot;Memoirs of Joseph Grimaldi&quot;, illustrated by George Cruikshank, sold well, to Dickens&#x27;s surprise.

Grimaldi&#x27;s fame was established primarily by his numerous successes as Clown in pantomimes. His Clown satirised many aspects of contemporary British life, and made comic mockery of absurdities in fashion. Grimaldi quickly became the most famous Clown in London, gradually transforming the Clown character from a pratfalling country bumpkin into the most important character in the harlequinade, more important even than Harlequin. He expanded the role of Clown to include a range of comic impersonations, from the rival suitor, to household cook or nurse. Grimaldi&#x27;s popularity changed the balance of the evening&#x27;s entertainment, so that the first, relatively serious, section of the pantomime soon dwindled to &quot;little more than a pretext for determining the characters who were to be transformed into those of the harlequinade.&quot; He became so dominant in the harlequinade that later Clowns were known as &quot;Joey&quot;, and the term, as well as his make-up design, were later generalised to other types of clowns. Literary critic John Carey wrote: &quot;He invented clown make-up as we know it today (the wide grin was designed to be visible from the back of Drury Lane&#x27;s auditorium, the biggest in Europe). He also created the stereotype of the &quot;sad clown&quot;, taken up by later funsters including Charlie Chaplin and Peter Sellers.&quot;

A contributor to &quot;Bentley&#x27;s Miscellany&quot; wrote in 1846: &quot;To those who never saw him, description is fruitless; to those who have, no praise comes up to their appreciation of him. We therefore shake our heads and say &#x27;Ah! You should have seen Grimaldi!&#x27;&quot; Another writer commented that his performances elevated his role by &quot;acute observation upon the foibles and absurdities of society. ... He is the finest practical satyrist that ever existed. ... He was so extravagantly natural, that [no one was] ashamed to laugh till tears coursed down their cheeks at Joe and his comicalities.&quot; The British dramatist James Planché worried, in a rhymed couplet, that Grimaldi&#x27;s death meant the end of a genre: &quot;Pantomime&#x27;s best days are fled; Grimaldi, Barnes, Bologna dead!&quot;

Grimaldi became &quot;easily the most popular English entertainer of his day&quot;. The Victoria and Albert Museum and the actor Simon Callow have both concluded that no other Clown achieved Grimaldi&#x27;s level of fame. Richard Findlater, author of a 1955 Grimaldi biography, commented: &quot;Here is Joey the Clown, the first of 10,000 Joeys who took their name from him; here is the genius of English fun, in the holiday splendour of his reign at Sadler&#x27;s Wells and Covent Garden ... during his lifetime [Grimaldi] was generally acclaimed as the funniest and best-loved man in the British theatre.&quot; A later biographer, Andrew McConnell Stott, wrote that &quot;Joey had been the first great experiment in comic persona, and by shifting the emphasis of clowning from tricks and pratfalls to characterisation, satire and a full sense of personhood, he had established himself as the spiritual father of all those later comedians whose humour stems first and foremost from a strong sense of identity.&quot;

Grimaldi is remembered today in an annual memorial service on the first Sunday in February at Holy Trinity Church in Hackney. The service, which has been held since the 1940s, attracts hundreds of clown performers from all over the world who attend the service in full clown costume. In 2010 a coffin-shaped musical memorial dedicated to Grimaldi, made of musical floor tiles, was installed in Joseph Grimaldi Park. The bronze tiles are tuned so that when danced upon it is possible to play &quot;Hot Codlins&quot;. A 2017 film, &quot;Grimaldi: The Funniest Man in the World&quot;, revolves around Grimaldi&#x27;s life and starred the Chuckle Brothers, Vicki Michelle and David Essex.

<text>1941 is a 1979 American war comedy film directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale. The film stars an ensemble cast including Dan Aykroyd, Ned Beatty, John Belushi, John Candy, Christopher Lee, Tim Matheson, Toshiro Mifune, Robert Stack, Nancy Allen, and Mickey Rourke in his film debut. The story involves a panic in the Los Angeles area after the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor.

Co-writer Gale stated the plot is loosely based on what has come to be known as the Great Los Angeles Air Raid of 1942, as well as the bombardment of the Ellwood oil refinery, near Santa Barbara, by a Japanese submarine. Many other events in the film were based on real incidents, including the Zoot Suit Riots and an incident in which the U.S. Army placed an anti-aircraft gun in a homeowner&#x27;s yard on the Maine coast.

&quot;1941&quot; received mixed reviews and was not as financially successful as many of Spielberg&#x27;s other films, but was still a moderate box office success. It received belated popularity after an expanded version aired on ABC in the 1980s, with subsequent television broadcasts and home video reissues, raising it to cult status.
==Plot==
On Saturday, December 13, 1941, at 7:01 a.m. (six days after the attack on Pearl Harbor), an Imperial Japanese Navy submarine, commanded by Akiro Mitamura and carrying Kriegsmarine officer Wolfgang von Kleinschmidt, surfaces off the Californian coast. Wanting to destroy something &quot;honorable&quot;, Mitamura decides to target Hollywood. Later that morning, a 10th Armored Division M3 Lee tank crew, consisting of Sergeant Frank Tree, Corporal Chuck Sitarski, and Privates Foley, Reese, and Henshaw, are having breakfast at Malcolmb’s Café, where dishwasher Wally Stephens and his friend, fry cook Dennis DeSoto, work. Wally plans to enter a dance contest at the Crystal Ballroom that evening with his girlfriend, Betty Douglas. The extremely short-tempered Sitarski humiliatingly trips him, instigating a scuffle. Once the soldiers depart, the owner, Mr. Malcolmb, fires Wally and Dennis.

As United States Army Air Forces Captain Wild Bill Kelso chaotically searches for Japanese forces in his Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, Major General Joseph W. Stilwell holds a press conference at Daugherty Field in Long Beach, where his aide, Captain Loomis Birkhead, meets his old flame Donna Stratton, Stilwell&#x27;s new secretary. Aware that she is sexually aroused by airplanes, Birkhead lures her into the cockpit of a B-17 bomber and unsuccessfully attempts to seduce her; he accidentally releases a bomb, which collides with the grandstand and explodes, though Stilwell and the crowd escape unhurt.

At the Santa Monica oceanside home of her parents Ward and Joan, Betty and her friend Maxine Dexheimer, who have just become USO hostesses, tell Wally that servicemen are now the only male patrons allowed in the Ballroom. As Wally hides in the garage from Ward, Tree arrives with his team and orders an anti-aircraft battery to be installed in the front yard. Sitarski romances Betty, and Wally falls from the loft where he was hiding. Tree’s crew, including Sitarski, eject Wally from the premises into a passing garbage truck.

Meanwhile, as the Japanese submarine has suffered from a malfunctioning compass, a landing party goes ashore and captures lumberjack and Christmas tree salesman Hollis &quot;Holly&quot; Wood. Aboard, the crew discovers a small toy compass in his box of candy-popcorn, which he devours. After he unsuccessfully attempts to excrete the compass upon forced ingestion of prune juice, he causes panic but successfully escapes.

Ward&#x27;s neighbor, Angelo Scioli of the Ground Observer Corps, installs his friends Claude Crumm and Herb Kaziminsky in the Ferris wheel at the Ocean Front Amusement Park to scout for enemy aircraft. Birkhead determinedly drives Donna to the 501st Bomb Disbursement Unit in Barstow, where the mentally unstable Colonel &quot;Mad Man&quot; Maddox lends them a plane. Finally aroused, she begins to ravish him during the flight.

At the Crystal Ballroom, Sitarski drags Betty into the USO dance, but a disguised Wally sneaks in and reunites with her. An enraged Sitarski punches him out, igniting a brawl between uniformed personnel and zoot suiters. Tree and his team disband the melee, just before anti-aircraft batteries open fire on the plane carrying Birkhead and Donna. Kelso pursues and downs it, causing it to land into the La Brea Tar Pits. Claude and Herb mistake Kelso&#x27;s passing P-40 for a Japanese Zero and shoot it down; crashlanding downtown, he informs the military authorities about the Japanese submarine he spotted at the pier. Wally assumes command of the tank once Tree is accidentally incapacitated, and rescues Betty from Sitarski before heading for the pier with Dennis and the tankers, followed by Kelso on a motorcycle.

In Santa Monica, Ward locates and begins firing at the surfaced submarine, consequently wrecking his whole house. The submarine retaliatorily strikes the Ferris wheel, which rolls into the ocean. When von Kleinschmidt attempts a forced early retreat, Mitamura throws him overboard. The tank arrives and then sinks when the submarine torpedoes the pier. Kelso jumps off and swims to the submarine, where the Japanese capture him. Deeming the mission an honorable success, Mitamura departs. The next morning, Stilwell arrives with soldiers at the damaged Douglas residence, where the other protagonists have gathered. Ward symbolically nails a wreath to his front door, causing his unstable house to collapse down the hillside. Stilwell, observing the disheveled crowd arguing, informs Tree, &quot;It&#x27;s going to be a long war.&quot;

==Cast==
==Production==
According to Steven Spielberg&#x27;s appearance in the documentary &quot;Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures&quot;, Kubrick suggested that &quot;1941&quot; should have been marketed as a drama rather than a comedy. The chaos of the events following the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941 is summarized by Dan Aykroyd&#x27;s character, Sgt. Tree, who repeatedly states, &#x27;If there&#x27;s one thing I can&#x27;t stand seeing, it&#x27;s Americans fighting Americans.&quot;

Robert Zemeckis originally pitched the concept to John Milius as a serious depiction of the real-life 1942 Japanese bombardment of Ellwood, California; the subsequent false alarm of a Japanese air raid on Los Angeles; and the 1943 Zoot Suit Riots, titled &quot;The Night the Japs Attacked&quot;. After development of the film transferred from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) to Universal Pictures, executives insisted that the title be changed to &quot;Rising Sun&quot; to avoid the use of the derogatory term &quot;Jap.&quot; The story became a comedy after Steven Spielberg became involved as director, and the script was rewritten during the production of &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; in 1977. The characters of Claude Crumm and Herb Kaziminsky were originally written with &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; co-stars Jackie Gleason and Art Carney in mind. Hollis P. &quot;Holly&quot; Wood and &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Kelso were originally minor characters before Belushi and Pickens were cast.

&quot;1941&quot; is also notable as one of the few American films featuring popular Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune. It is also the only American film in which Mifune used his own voice in speaking Japanese and English. In his previous movies, Mifune&#x27;s lines were dubbed in English by Paul Frees.

John Wayne, Charlton Heston, and James Stewart were originally offered the role of Major General Joseph Stilwell, with Wayne still considered for a cameo in the film. After reading the script, Wayne decided not to participate due to ill health, but also urged Spielberg not to pursue the project, as both he and Heston felt the film was unpatriotic. Spielberg recalled, &quot;[Wayne] was really curious and so I sent him the script. He called me the next day and said he felt it was a very un-American movie, and I shouldn&#x27;t waste my time making it. He said, &#x27;You know, that was an important war, and you&#x27;re making fun of a war that cost thousands of lives at Pearl Harbor. Don&#x27;t joke about World War II&#x27;.&quot; Initially Spielberg wanted Hollywood agent Meyer Mishkin to portray himself, but had to cast Iggie Wolfington because of Screen Actors Guild regulations barring film agents from working as actors.

Susan Backlinie, the first victim in Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Jaws&quot;, appeared as the woman seen swimming nude at the beginning of the film. The gas station that Wild Bill Kelso accidentally blows up early in the film is the same one seen in Spielberg&#x27;s 1971 TV film, &quot;Duel&quot;, with Lucille Benson appearing as the proprietor in both films. Inadvertent comedic effects ensued when John Belushi, in character as Captain Wild Bill Kelso, unintentionally fell off the wing of his airplane and landed on his head in the scene where Kelso encounters Col. Maddox 
and his men. It was a real accident and Belushi was hospitalized for several days, but Spielberg left the shot in the movie as it fit Kelso&#x27;s eccentric character.

During the USO riot scene, when a military police officer is tossed into the window of a restaurant from the ladder of a fire engine, Belushi is seen eating spaghetti, in makeup to resemble Marlon Brando in &quot;The Godfather&quot;, whom he famously parodied in a sketch on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Belushi told Spielberg he wanted to appear as a second character and the idea struck Spielberg as humorous. At the beginning of the USO riot, one of the uncredited &quot;extras&quot; dressed as a sailor is actor James Caan. Mickey Rourke makes his first screen appearance in the film as Private First Class Reese of Sgt. Tree&#x27;s tank group.

The M3 tank &quot;Lulu Belle&quot; (named after a race horse) and fashioned from a mocked-up tractor, paid homage to its forebear in Humphrey Bogart&#x27;s 1943 movie &quot;Sahara&quot; where an authentic M3 named &quot;Lulubelle&quot; was prominently featured.

Renowned modelmaker Greg Jein (best known for his work in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise) received his second Academy Award for Best Visual Effects nomination for his work on the film; he would later use the hull number &quot;NCC-1941&quot; for the starship USS &quot;Bozeman&quot; in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Cause and Effect&quot;. Paul De Rolf choreographed the film.

&quot;1941&quot; is dedicated to the memory of Charlsie Bryant, a longtime script supervisor at Universal Studios. She had worked on both &quot;Jaws&quot; and &quot;Close Encounters&quot;, and would have reprised those duties with this film had she not unexpectedly died.

===Special effects===
The Oscar-winning team of L. B. Abbott and A. D. Flowers were in charge of the special effects on &quot;1941&quot;. The film is widely recognized for its Academy Award-nominated special-effects laden progressive action and camera sequences.

===Trailer===
The advance teaser trailer for &quot;1941&quot;, directed by the film&#x27;s executive producer/co-story writer John Milius, featured narration by Aykroyd as Belushi&#x27;s character Kelso (here erroneously named &quot;Wild Wayne&quot; and not &quot;Wild Bill&quot;), after landing his plane, gives the viewers a pep-talk encouraging them to join the United States Armed Forces, lest they find one morning that the country has been taken over (for instance, &quot;the street signs will be written in Japanese!&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdUCu-A7tgg&quot;&gt;. Retrieved: October 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
The musical score for &quot;1941&quot; was composed and conducted by John Williams. The titular march is used throughout the film and is perhaps the most memorable piece written for it. (Spielberg has said it is his favorite Williams march.) The score also includes a swing composition titled &quot;Swing, Swing, Swing&quot; composed by Williams. In addition, the score includes a sound-alike version of Glenn Miller&#x27;s &quot;In the Mood&quot;, and two original 1940s recordings by The Andrews Sisters, &quot;Daddy&quot; and &quot;Down by the Ohio&quot;. The Irish tune &quot;The Rakes of Mallow&quot;, is heard during the riot at the USO.

The LaserDisc and DVD versions of the film have isolated music channels with additional cues not heard on the first soundtrack album.

The &quot;1941&quot; soundtrack album was originally released in 1979 by Arista Records.
In 2011, La-La Land Records, in conjunction with Sony Music and NBCUniversal, issued an expanded 2-CD soundtrack of the complete John Williams score as recorded for the film, plus never-before-heard alternative cues, source music, and a remastered version of the original album. Disc One, containing the film score, presents the music as Williams originally conceived based on early cuts of the movie.

==Release==
The film was previewed at approximately two and a half hours, but Columbia Pictures and Universal Pictures, which both had a major financial investment, felt it was too long to be a blockbuster. The initial theatrical release was edited down to just under two hours, against Spielberg&#x27;s wishes. Additionally, after a preview screening to investors in Dallas received negative reviews, the release of the film was delayed by a month to allow Spielberg to reedit the first 45 minutes of the film.

The film premiered at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood on December 13, 1979, before opening to the public the following day.

===Home media===
After the success of his 1980 &quot;Special Edition&quot; of &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;, Spielberg was given permission to create his own &quot;extended cut&quot; of &quot;1941&quot; to represent his original director&#x27;s cut. This was done for network television (it was only shown on ABC once, but it was seen years later on The Disney Channel). It was first released on VHS and Betamax in 1980 from MCA Videocassette Inc. and from MCA Home Video in 1986 and 1990. A similar extended version (with additional footage and a few subtle changes) was released on LaserDisc in 1995. It included a 101-minute documentary featuring interviews with Spielberg, executive producer John Milius, writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale, editor Michael Kahn, composer John Williams and others involved. This set also included an isolated music score, three theatrical trailers, deleted scenes, photo galleries, and reviews of the movie.

This cut was later released on VHS in 1998, and later on DVD in 1999 and was rereleased on DVD again in May 2002. The DVD includes all features from the 1995 Laserdisc Set. It was released again on DVD in 2000 in a John Belushi box set along with the collector&#x27;s editions of &quot;Animal House&quot; and &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;.

On October 14, 2014, Universal Studios Home Entertainment released &quot;1941&quot; on Blu-ray as part of their Steven Spielberg&#x27;s Director&#x27;s Collection box set. The disc features both the theatrical (118 minutes) and extended version (146 minutes) of the film, a documentary of the making of the film, production photographs (carried over from the LaserDisc collector&#x27;s edition), and theatrical trailers, although the isolated score that was included on the Laserdisc and DVD releases is not present on the Blu-ray. The standalone Blu-ray version was released on May 5, 2015.

&quot;Heavy Metal&quot; and Arrow Books produced a magazine-sized comics tie-in to the film, by Allen Asherman, Stephen R. Bissette, and Rick Veitch, which rather than being a straight adaptation, varies wildly and humorously from the film. Spielberg wrote the book&#x27;s introduction.

==Reception==
===Box office===
During its theatrical run, &quot;1941&quot; earned $23.4 million in theatrical rentals from the United States and Canada. Because &quot;1941&quot; grossed significantly less than &quot;Jaws&quot; and &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;, the film has been erroneously thought to be a box office disaster, but in actuality, &quot;1941&quot; grossed $90 million worldwide and returned a profit, making it a success.

===Critical reaction===
Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film two and a half out of four stars and applauded the film&#x27;s visual effects, but stated &quot;[T]here is so much flab here, including endless fistfights and huge dance production numbers that become meaningless after a few minutes.&quot; In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby wrote &quot;There are too many characters who aren&#x27;t immediately comic. There are too many simultaneous actions that necessitate a lot of cross-cutting, and cross-cutting between unrelated anecdotes can kill a laugh faster than a yawn. Everything is too big...The slapstick gags, obviously choreographed with extreme care, do not build to boffs; they simply go on too long. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the fault of the director or of the editor, but I&#x27;ve seldom seen a comedy more ineptly timed.&quot; Similarly, &quot;Variety&quot; labeled the movie as &quot;long on spectacle, but short on comedy,&quot; further stating that &quot;&quot;1941&quot; suffers from Spielberg&#x27;s infatuation with physical comedy, even when the gags involve tanks, planes and submarines, rather than the usual stuff of screen hijinks. Pic is so overstuffed with visual humor of a rather monstrous nature that feeling emerges, once you&#x27;ve seen 10 explosions, you&#x27;ve seen them all.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film one and a half stars out of four, writing that the film &quot;feels forced together chaotically, as if the editors wanted to keep the material moving at any cost. The movie finally reduces itself to an assault on our eyes and ears, a nonstop series of climaxes, screams, explosions, double-takes, sight gags, and ethnic jokes that&#x27;s finally just not very funny.&quot; He labeled the film&#x27;s central problem as having been &quot;never thought through on a basic level of character and story.&quot; Charles Champlin, reviewing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, commented &quot;If &quot;1941&quot; is angering (and you may well suspect that it is), it is because the film seems merely an expensive indulgence, begat by those who know how to say it, if only they had something to say.&quot; Dave Kehr of &quot;The Chicago Reader&quot; called it &quot;a chattering wind-up toy of a movie [that] blows its spring early on. The characters are so crudely drawn that the film seems to have no human base whatsoever...the people in it are unremittingly foolish, and the physical comedy quickly degenerates into childish destructiveness.&quot;

Years later, the film would be re-appraised by critics like Richard Brody of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, who claimed it was &quot;the movie in which [Spielberg] came nearest to cutting loose&quot; and &quot;the only movie where he tried to go past where he knew he could...its failure, combined with his need for success, inhibited him maybe definitively.&quot; Jonathan Rosenbaum of &quot;The Chicago Reader&quot; would hail &quot;1941&quot; as Spielberg&#x27;s best film until 2001&#x27;s &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot;, writing that he was impressed by the virtuosity of &quot;1941&quot; and argued that its &quot;honest mean-spiritedness and teenage irreverence&quot; struck him as &quot;closer to Spielberg&#x27;s soul&quot; than more popular and celebrated works like &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; and &quot;The Color Purple&quot;.
According to Jack Nicholson, director Stanley Kubrick allegedly told Spielberg that &quot;1941&quot; was &quot;great, but not funny.&quot; Spielberg joked at one point that he considered converting &quot;1941&quot; into a musical halfway into production and mused that &quot;in retrospect, that might have helped.&quot; In a 1990 interview with British film pundit Barry Norman, Spielberg admitted that the mixed reception to &quot;1941&quot; was one of the biggest lessons of his career, citing personal arrogance that had gotten in the way after the runaway success of &quot;Jaws&quot; and &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;. He also regretted not ceding control of &quot;1941&quot;″s action and miniature sequences (such as the Ferris wheel collapse in the film&#x27;s finale) to second unit directors and model units, something which he would do in his next film, &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. He also said &quot;Some people think that was an out-of-control production, but it wasn&#x27;t. What happened on the screen was pretty out of control, but the production was pretty much in control. I don&#x27;t dislike the movie at all. I&#x27;m not embarrassed by it — I just think that it wasn&#x27;t funny enough.&quot;

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of 39%, based on 28 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10. The critical consensus reads, &quot;Steven Spielberg&#x27;s attempt at screwball comedy collapses under a glut of ideas, confusing an unwieldy scope for a commensurate amount of guffaws.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 34 out of 100, based on 7 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

===Accolades===
The film received three nominations at the 1980 Academy Awards.
American Film Institute nominated the film in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...Laughs.
