<text>Joseph Costello (born 13 July 1945) is an Irish former Labour Party politician who was a member of Dublin City Council from 2019 to 2023. He served as a Minister of State from 2011 to 2014. He was a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dublin Central constituency from 1992 to 1997 and 2000 to 2016.

He also served as a member of the Dublin City Council from 1999 to 2002. He was a Senator for the Administrative Panel from 1989 to 1992 and from 1997 to 2002. In July 2023, he announced his retirement from politics.

==Early life==
Costello was born in Geevagh, County Sligo and was educated at Summerhill College, Sligo, St Patrick&#x27;s College, Maynooth and University College Dublin. He worked as a secondary school teacher before becoming a full-time public representative.

==Political career==
In 1985, along with Tony Gregory and Christy Burke, Costello was arrested for protesting alongside market traders against casual trading legislation that had been introduced; he spent a week in prison.

He joined the Labour Party in 1985, and first stood for the party in the 1987 general election; contesting the Dublin Central constituency, he received 3.2% of the vote (1,305 votes) and was the final candidate eliminated in the constituency. In 1989 he was elected to the 19th Seanad as a Senator for the Administrative Panel. He remained there until the 1992 general election when he was elected to Dáil Éireann. Costello lost his seat at the 1997 general election but was subsequently elected to the Seanad again. Costello was re-elected to the Dáil at the 2002 and 2007 general elections.

He was a member of Dublin City Council from 1999 until the end of the dual mandate led to him passing the seat to his wife Emer Costello. He was re-elected to the council in 2019.

He was director of elections for the Labour party candidate Michael D. Higgins in his presidential campaign of 2011. Higgins would win 56% of the vote in the final count and be elected president. 

On 20 December 2011, he was appointed by the Fine Gael–Labour government as Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with responsibility for Trade and Development, a position he served in until 15 July 2014. He was dropped as a Minister of State in a reshuffle in July 2014. He was then appointed to the Dáil Public Accounts Committee.

At a Sinn Féin organised boxing charity fundraiser on 15 February 2014, Costello and his wife took a photo with gangland criminal Gerry Hutch. On 14 February 2016, 16 days before the 2016 general election (in which Costello was a candidate), the &quot;Irish Daily Mail&quot; published an article titled &quot;Hypocrisy&quot;, calling Costello a hypocrite for condemning gang violence after the death of Edward Hutch (Gerry Hutch&#x27;s brother) but being seen in a photograph with gang leaders. Costello responded: &quot;...there were dozens of photographs taken. People were constantly coming in behind us into the photographs. I had no idea who was in that particular photo except myself, my wife and the lady in the front&quot;. Joan Burton, the then Tánaiste defended him and said &quot;politicians do not know everyone they take photos with&quot;. Costello then sued the &quot;Irish Daily Mail&quot; for defamation. In May 2019, the case was settled and the &quot;Irish Daily Mail&quot; read out an apology to Costello and his wife in court.

In October 2015 on the &quot;Saturday with Claire Byrne&quot; RTÉ radio show, Costello mistakenly referred to Nicky Kehoe (a one-time Provisional IRA member and the Sinn Féin director of elections) as the &quot;IRA&#x27;s former chief of staff in Dublin&quot; but made sure not to name him. The producer of the radio show pressed the &quot;talk back button&quot; which is a button that alerts the presenter (Claire Byrne) to intervene. Byrne did not intervene and Sinn Féin member, Eoin Ó Broin began defending Kehoe, accidentally naming him. Costello then backed down on his claim about Kehoe&#x27;s high-profile involvement in the IRA. Kehoe responded to the incident by suing RTÉ for defamation. In February 2018, the court proceedings began. The jury found RTÉ was 35% at fault and Costello was 65%. Kehoe was awarded €3,500. In 2020, Costello sued the state and RTÉ because he wasn&#x27;t invited to the court proceedings effectively denying him the right to defend himself, breaching the European Convention on Human Rights.

He lost his seat at the 2016 general election. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the Dublin Central constituency at the 2020 general election.

He was deputy Lord Mayor of Dublin from 2021 to 2022. In July 2023, he announced his retirement from politics, Deborah Byrne was selected by the Labour party to replace him.

== Retirement ==
In August 2023, after he had announced his retirement, he was invited by some locals to go to a meeting in Aughrim Street, Dublin about Ukrainian refugees being given help in the local sports hall. Around 300 people, some wearing masks marched up Prussia Street, blocking traffic. Costello continued talking despite the crowd being &quot;intimidatory&quot;, until 20 of the masked group rushed him and one of them grabbed the microphone out of his hand, prompting the rest of the masked group to begin verbally abusing him. The gardaí at the event did not intervene and Costello had to leave. The following day another meeting was held but only 20 people showed up. Costello told &quot;The Irish Times&quot; that he worried about the right wing and anti-immigrant sentiment being allowed to build in certain communities.

==Personal life==
His wife Emer Costello is a former MEP for Dublin.

<text>&#x27; (), abbreviated as PzG (WWII) or PzGren&quot;&quot;&#x27; (modern), meaning &quot;&quot;Armour&quot;-ed fighting vehicle &quot;Grenadier&quot;&quot;, is the German term for the military doctrine of mechanized infantry units in armoured forces who specialize in fighting from and in conjunction with infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) – that is, armoured troop carriers designed to carry a mechanized squad of six to eight soldiers into, during and out of combat while providing direct fire support for those troops.

The doctrine originated primarily in Nazi Germany during World War II and is today used by name in the countries of Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Sweden.

== Doctrine ==

 combat is conducted in close cooperation with IFVs. Each squad has its own designated IFV during battle. Combat can be conducted either from within the vehicle via portholes in the walls or hatches on the roof etc., so-called &quot;mounted combat&quot;, or from outside the vehicle in its vicinity using dismount-hatches at the back of the vehicle, so-called &quot;dismounted combat&quot;.

Combat missions consist of ambushing, fire support, reconnaissance, spearhead attacks, etc. Depending on the armament, the IFV can have a varying degree of active participation in the battle. Early examples simply featured a pair of rifle-calibre machine guns. Modern day examples traditionally use medium-caliber () autocannons and integrated missile-systems in a revolving turret. Unlike traditional mechanized infantry, do not use armoured personnel carriers (APC) in their doctrine, as APCs are intended as &quot;armoured taxis&quot; and by design lack the ability for mounted combat.

=== Use ===
The doctrine and name is primarily used in the armies of Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Sweden, in the latter under the native forms &quot;pansarskytte&quot; ( = ) and &quot;pansarinfanteri&quot; (&quot;armour infantry&quot;). In the modern German Army, (&quot;Pzg&quot;) is the lowest rank of enlisted men (&quot;Mannschaften&quot;) in the &quot;Panzergrenadiertruppe&quot;, comparable to NATO Other Rank-1 level.

=== History ===
The doctrine was introduced by the German Army during the second half of the 1930s, initially being simple infantry () belonging to the armoured force (so-called &quot;armour infantry&quot;), serving either as mechanized or motorized infantry depending on their mode of transportation (infantry fighting vehicle vs unarmoured vehicle). IFVs () were the preferred vehicle of transportation for the armour infantry, but due to shortages, most units had to be transported in trucks as motorised infantry. The role of the armour infantry was to escort and protect the armoured force from enemy infantry, allowing allied armour to deal with heavier threats. Mounted combat in IFVs could also be used in advancing assaults on to the enemy flanks. The success of this tactic during the first years of World War II led to the introduction of a new troop type specialising in IFV combat, called . All mechanized and motorised infantry in the armoured force were reclassified as such in 1942, changing their classification from infantry to armoured unit.

Sweden also adopted the doctrine in 1942, to some extent independently, although lacking dedicated infantry fighting vehicles until 1943.

== German Wehrmacht ==
=== Forerunners (&quot;Schützen&quot;) ===

The term was not adopted until 1942. Infantry in panzer divisions from 1937 onwards were known as &quot;Schützen&quot; (literally in German: Gunners) Regiments; they wore the same rose pink piping on their uniforms as the tank crews (with an &quot;S&quot; cypher that distinguished the &quot;Schützen&quot; from the tank and anti-tank units that also wore that colour). Soldiers in special Motorized Infantry units wore the standard white piping of the Infantry. In 1942, when Infantry Regiments were renamed as Grenadier Regiments by Hitler as a historical homage to Frederick the Great&#x27;s Army, the Schützen regiments (and the soldiers in them) began to be redesignated as regiments, as did Motorized Infantry units and soldiers. Their &quot;Waffenfarbe&quot; was also changed from either white (in the case of Motorized Infantry) or rose pink to a meadow-green shade previously worn by motorcycle troops. Some units did not change over their designations and/or &quot;Waffenfarbe&quot; accoutrements until 1943, and many veteran &quot;Schützen&quot; ignored regulations and kept their rose-pink until the end of the war.

=== Wehrmacht &quot;Panzergrenadiers&quot; during World War II ===

The term had been introduced in 1942, and was applied equally to the infantry component of Panzer divisions as well as the new divisions known as &quot;Panzergrenadier Divisions&quot;. Most of the Heer&#x27;s PzGren. divisions evolved via upgrades from ordinary infantry divisions, first to Motorized Infantry divisions and then to PzGren. divisions, retaining their numerical designation within the series for infantry divisions throughout the process. This included the 3rd, 10th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 18th, 20th, 25th, and 29th divisions. Others, such as the &quot;Großdeutschland Division&quot;, were built up over the course of the war by repeatedly augmenting the size of an elite regiment or battalion. The Waffen-SS also created several PzGren. divisions by the same methods, or by creating new divisions from scratch later in the war. A number of PzGren. divisions in both the Heer and Waffen-SS were upgraded to Panzerwaffe divisions as the war progressed.

The divisions were organized as combined arms formations, usually with six battalions of truck-mounted infantry organized into either two or three regiments, a battalion of tanks, and an ordinary division&#x27;s complement of artillery, reconnaissance units, combat engineers, anti-tank and anti-aircraft artillery, and so forth. All these support elements would also be mechanized in a PzGren. division, though most of the artillery, anti-tank, and anti-aircraft elements were equipped with weapons towed by trucks rather than the relatively rare armored and self-propelled models. In practice the PzGren. divisions were often equipped with heavy assault guns rather than tanks, one armoured regiment with three battalions of 14 assault guns each, due to a chronic shortage of tanks throughout the German armed forces. A few elite units, on the other hand, might have the tanks &quot;plus&quot; a battalion of heavy assault guns for their anti-tank element, and armored carriers for some of their infantry battalions as well.

On paper a division had one tank battalion less than a Panzer division, but two more infantry battalions, and thus was almost as strong as a Panzer division, especially on the defensive. Of 226 battalions in the whole of the German Army, Luftwaffe and Waffen SS in September 1943, only 26 were equipped with armoured half tracks, or just over 11 percent. The rest were equipped with trucks.

=== Wehrmacht &quot;Panzergrenadier&quot; equipment ===
The use of armoured half-tracks was rare in the German Army, and even the elite &quot;Großdeutschland Division&quot;, with two regiments, only mustered a few companies&#x27; worth of the vehicles, generally Sd.Kfz. 251 troop carriers. The vast majority of Schützen/ soldiers were mounted in trucks. Additionally, vehicles in the early war period suffered from poor off-road performance.

In 1944 a couple of Panzer Divisions based in France had more than the standard one battalion mounted in Sd.Kfz. 251 troop carriers. The Panzer Lehr Division&#x27;s infantry and engineers were entirely mounted in Sd.Kfz. 251 troop carriers, while the 1st Battalion in both regiments in 2. Panzer Division and 21. Panzer Division were half-equipped with armoured halftracks (Sd.Kfz. 251 troop carriers for &quot;2. Panzer&quot;, U304(f) light armoured personnel carriers for &quot;21. Panzer&quot;).

== German Bundeswehr ==

When the armed forces of West Germany was formed as the in late 1955, it was decided to readopt the doctrine instead of adopting the American doctrine of mechanized infantry using armoured personnel carriers as simple &quot;battlefield taxis&quot; and not as assault vehicles. This led to the development of the Schützenpanzer, lang, Typ 12-3 infantry fighting vehicle, introduced in 1960, followed by the Schützenpanzer Marder 1 in 1971, the cancelled Marder 2 in 1991, and the Schützenpanzer Puma in 2010.
=== Bundeswehr doctrine ===
In the German army, act as mechanized infantry and escort for tanks and other armoured fighting vehicles.

According to the German central army regulation &quot;HDv 100/100&quot; (2000 edition), the &quot;Panzergrenadiertruppe&quot; and their co-operation with other armoured troops is characterized as following:

According to the &quot;HDv 231/100&quot;, the fighting of a Battalion is characterized by the following aspects:
&quot;The fighting of the battalion is characterized by:
*the combination of fire and movement,
*attacking in conjunction with main battle tanks,
*swift changes between mounted and dismounted combat,
*close cooperation between mounted and dismounted forces,
*the particularly mobile combat, [...]&quot;
=== Bundeswehr &quot;Panzergrenadier&quot; units ===
After the newest phase of the transformation process the German Army will be fielding the following active Panzergrenadier battalions:

* &quot;Panzergrenadierbataillon 33&quot;, Neustadt am Rübenberge
* &quot;Panzergrenadierlehrbataillon 92&quot; (Demonstration battalion), Munster
* &quot;Panzergrenadierbataillon 112&quot;, Regen
* &quot;Panzergrenadierbataillon 122&quot;, Oberviechtach
* &quot;Panzergrenadierbataillon 212&quot;, Augustdorf
* &quot;Panzergrenadierbataillon 371&quot;, Marienberg
* &quot;Panzergrenadierbataillon 391&quot;, Bad Salzungen
* &quot;Panzergrenadierbataillon 401&quot;, Hagenow
* &quot;Panzergrenadierbataillon 411&quot;, Viereck

Additionally, in 2008 two inactive Panzergrenadier Battalions were formed:
*&quot;Panzergrenadierbataillon 908&quot;, Viereck (with Panzergrenadierbataillon 411 as supplying and maintaining unit)
*&quot;Panzergrenadierbataillon 909&quot;, Marienberg (with Panzergrenadierbataillon 371 as supplying and maintaining unit)

Training and development of the Panzergrenadiertruppe is usually performed by the Armoured Corps Training Centre (&quot;Ausbildungszentrum Panzertruppen&quot;) in Munster, its commander holding the title of General der Panzertruppen. Some essential training courses, especially for urban warfare and fighting in forested terrain, are held at the &quot;Ausbildungszentrum Infanterie&quot; (&quot;Infantry Training Centre&quot;) at Hammelburg.

=== Bundeswehr &quot;Panzergrenadier&quot; equipment ===

The main weapon system of the German is the Schützenpanzer Puma infantry fighting vehicles. It was introduced beginning in 2010, intended to replace the Schützenpanzer Marder 1 IFV, with equipping to be completed by 2025. Due to the design of the Puma, cannot exceed a height of 1.84 meters.

The G36 assault rifle is the standard weapon of German infantrymen and also used by units. Each dismounted fireteam usually also deploys a MG3 machine gun. To fight armored vehicles or other hard targets the Panzerfaust 3 rocket-propelled grenade and the MILAN Anti-tank guided missile are in use. The &quot;MILAN&quot;-ATGM is used by dismounted fireteams (which consist of six soldiers due to the number of soldiers carried by the &quot;Marder&quot; and &quot;Puma&quot; IFVs), as well as attached to the &quot;Marder&quot; turret to provide the IFV with enhanced anti-armour capabilities. In tandem with the replacement of the &quot;Marder&quot; by the &quot;Puma&quot;, the &quot;MILAN&quot; is similarly being replaced by the Spike-ATGM for mounted and dismounted use.

As part of the Future Soldier-program, the German Infanterist der Zukunft program is also intended to be introduced into units and is already deployed with German soldiers in Afghanistan.

== Swedish Army ==

The Swedish Army has used infantry in its armored force since 1942, so-called &quot;armour infantry&quot; (). In 1943 the first Swedish dedicated infantry fighting vehicle was introduced, namely the tgb m/42 KP. Infantry serving with it were called &quot;armour schütze soldiers&quot; (). The tgb m/42 KP was generally a good design for its time but it lacked an armored roof for the troop compartment. Its wheeled design also limited its use alongside tanks when in terrain. By the late 1950s a replacement design was needed. This led to the development of the pbv 301 and 302 IFVs, featuring tracked chassis and enclosed troop compartments. By the 1980s the next generation of Swedish IFV was in development, ultimately resulting in the strf 90 IFV, internationally known as the CV90. For a brief period, Sweden also operated ex East German BMP-1 IFVs from the Soviet Union, under the Swedish designation pbv 501, while waiting for more strf 90s to be produced.

== Swiss Army ==

Switzerland adopted the M113 armored personnel carrier as an IFV in 1963, designated &quot;Schützenpanzer 63&quot;. Similar to most World War II IFVs it only carried machine gun armament and relied on the panzergrenadier squad and their armament for effect. The Schützenpanzer 63 was subsequently updated with a 20 mm gun turret from Swedish firm Hägglund &amp; Söner in the 1970s, mounting a modified Hispano-Suiza HS.804 autocannon. The same turret had previously been developed for the similar Swedish IFV pbv 302.

The Schützenpanzer 63 was eventually replaced with the Hägglunds CV9030CH from Sweden in the early 2000s, designated the &quot;Schützenpanzer 2000&quot;. The Swiss Army purchasing 186 vehicles from Hägglunds. They are in use with Panzergrenadier troops.

== Austrian Bundesheer ==
The two existing battalions of the Austrian use the Austrian version of the ASCOD (Austrian Spanish Cooperation Development) armoured fighting vehicle, known as the &quot;Schützenpanzer &quot;Ulan&quot;&quot;. The Waffenfarbe of the Austrian is black.

<text>Liz McManus (born 23 March 1947) is an Irish former Labour Party politician who served as Deputy leader of the Labour Party from 2002 to 2007 and Minister of State at the Department of the Environment from 1994 to 1997. She served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Wicklow constituency from 1992 to 2011.

==Early life and writing career==
McManus was born in 1947 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. She studied Architecture at University College Dublin, where she shared a drawing desk with Ruairi Quinn. McManus is an accomplished writer. She has won the Hennessy, Listowel and Irish PEN awards in fiction. Her first novel &quot;Acts of Subversion&quot; was nominated for the Aer Lingus/&quot;Irish Times&quot; Literature Prize. McManus was also a weekly columnist with the &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot; from 1986 until 1992.

==Political career==
She first ran for political office in 1979, when she was elected to Bray Urban District Council for Sinn Féin the Workers&#x27; Party. In 1985 she was elected to Wicklow County Council. She helped establish a women&#x27;s refuge in Bray in 1978 and was its convenor until 1991.

McManus was first elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1992 general election, as a member of Democratic Left. She retained her seat in every subsequent election until her retirement in 2011. In 1994, Democratic Left formed a government with Fine Gael and the Labour Party, and McManus was appointed as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, with responsibility for Housing and Urban Renewal, serving until the coalition lost office in 1997. During this period she was also a member of the Northern Ireland Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.

In 1999, Democratic Left merged with the Labour Party, and in 2002 McManus was elected deputy leader of the Labour Party. Another former Democratic Left TD, Pat Rabbitte, became leader of the party. She also became the Labour Party Spokesperson on Health, serving in both positions until 2007. 

Following the resignation of Pat Rabbitte on 23 August 2007, she was acting leader of the Labour Party until September 2007, but chose not to stand for re-election as deputy leader, when a deputy leadership election was held. Joan Burton replaced her as deputy leader. She was party Spokesperson on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources from 2007 to 2011.
She retired from politics at the 2011 general election, which she did not contest.

==Private life==
She was formerly married to John McManus; the couple had four children. They publicly separated in 2006. John McManus, a physician in general practice, was a Labour member of Bray Town Council from 1999 to 2009.

By February 2015 McManus had been with her new partner, Sean, also active in the Labour Party, for ten years. McManus stated the pair met three weeks after her split from her first husband.

<text>James Duffield Harding (1798 – 4 December 1863) was a British landscape painter, lithographer and author of drawing manuals. His use of tinted papers and opaque paints in watercolour proved influential.

==Life==
Harding was born at Deptford in 1798, the son of a drawing-master who had been a pupil of Paul Sandby. He was taught perspective by his father and had lessons from Samuel Prout. At the age of thirteen he exhibited two drawings of buildings in the style of Prout at the Royal Academy.

He was apprenticed to the engraver Charles Pye, but left him after only a year to concentrate on painting watercolours, and when he was 18 he was awarded a silver medal by the Society of Arts. In 1818 he showed with the Society of Painters in Watercolours, (known as the &quot;Old Watercolour Society or OWCS from 1831) for first time. He was to contribute to its exhibitions for the rest of his life. He was elected an associate of the society in 1820 and a full member in 1821. In 1843 he took up oil painting, and exhibited many landscapes in that medium at the Royal Academy. In 1847 he resigned his membership of the OWCS , hoping to be elected a member of the academy; but, after nine years without success, he withdrew his candidature, and was re-elected to the OWCS.
From an early on in his career Harding was a successful and popular teacher. When lithography became popular in Britain, he quickly adopted it as a means of reproducing good examples for the use of pupils and students. His first productions were drawing-books, consisting of pencil sketches and studies of trees; they were printed in tints with two stones, allowing the reproduction of more elaborate drawings. His &quot;Sketches at Home and Abroad&quot;, a series of fifty plates using this method, was published in 1836. In 1841 he published &quot;The Park and the Forest&quot;, a set of sketches drawn on the stone with a brush instead of the crayon, a technique of his own invention which he called &quot;lithotint&quot;. His other lithographic works included &quot;A Series of Subjects from the Works of R. P. Bonington&quot; (1829–30); &quot;Recollections of India&quot; (1847, from drawings by C. S. Hardinge) and &quot;Picturesque Selections&quot; (1861).

In 1830, Harding exhibited a series of Italian views sketched on papers of various colours and textures, the style of which was widely imitated. His use of opaque body colourin watercolour, following the example set by J. M. W. Turner, also proved influential. His drawings were praised by John Ruskin in &quot;Modern Painters&quot;. From the 1830s a range of papers was produced under the name of &quot;JDH pure drawing paper&quot;, initially for Winsor and Newton. The papers, which proved popular amongst both amateur and professional artists, and which Harding used himself, were produced in white, and in shades of cream, buff and grey. They were marketed until around 1910. Winsor and Newton also produced pencils under Harding&#x27;s name.
Harding was a prolific author of educational manuals, and his &quot;Lessons on Art&quot;, &quot;Guide and Companion to Lessons on Art&quot;, &quot;Elementary Art, or the Use of the Chalk and Lead Pencil advocated and explained&quot;, and &quot;The Principles and Practice of Art&quot;, were widely used both in Britain and abroad. His &quot;Drawing Models and Their Uses&quot; (1854) describes the use of a range of solid forms which he prepared and marketed.

He was described by Gilbert Redgrave in &quot;A History of Water Colour Painting in England&quot; as &quot;a skilful and rapid draughtsman, though somewhat mannered, and rarely rising above the commonplace.&quot;

He died at Barnes, on 4 December 1863, and was buried in Brompton Cemetery.

<text>Portuguese hip hop (&quot;Hip hop português&quot;), more commonly called hip hop tuga (&quot;tuga&quot; here being a slang for &quot;Portuguese&quot;), is the Portuguese variety of hip hop music. It differs from mainstream hip hop because it has strong influences from African music, from Lusophone Africa, reggae, zouk and fado.

Artists such as Valete, Lancelot and Sam the Kid are among the most popular. Old school Portuguese hip hop artists include General D, Chullage, Boss AC, Mind Da Gap, Dealema, Fuse, Mundo Segundo, Regula, Da Weasel, Allen Halloween and Sir Scratch.

The founder of hip hop tuga was rapper General D. Born in Maputo, Mozambique, General D moved to Lisbon at a young age and, even though he held a Portuguese passport and was heavily influenced by American rap, he always merged his music with his own Mozambican roots. He was the first rap-oriented artist of any kind to have a legitimate recording contract in Portugal. In 1994, he signed with Valentim de Carvalho, a Portuguese division of EMI Records, with whom he recorded two albums: &quot;Pé Na Tchôn, Karapinha Na Céu&quot; (1995) and &quot;Kanimabo&quot; (1997). Intelligent and charismatic, the general public and media liked General D., even though his lyrics were often very anti-establishment.

Californian hip hop artist and poet Ithaka (also known as: Ithaka Darin Pappas) is often included in the hip hop tuga community because he lived and recorded in Lisbon during 1992-1998 and was among the first wave of artists working with hip hop in Portugal. There he completed his first two (of eight) albums; &quot;Flowers and the Color of Paint&quot; (1995) and &quot;Stellafly&quot; (1997). His 1995 song &quot;Escape from the City of Angels&quot; (featuring Lisbon&#x27;s Marta Dias) was included in the soundtrack of Antoine Fuqua&#x27;s U.S. feature film directorial debut &quot;The Replacement Killers&quot; (Columbia Pictures) starring Chow Yun Fat, Mira Sorvino, Clifton Collins Jr. and Michael Rooker.
The song also appeared on the show &quot;Good Girl&#x27;s Don&#x27;t&quot; on Oprah Winfrey&#x27;s Oxygen Channel.

In a 2017 article in &quot;Rimas e Batidas&quot; titled &quot;Os Álbuns Mais caros Do Hip Hop Português&quot; (&quot;The Most Expensive Portuguese Hip Hop Albums&quot;), the journalist Hugo Jorge explains that the most sought after and used hip hop tuga records were made by Da Weasel, Fuse, Orelha Negra, Mind Da Gap, Micro, XEG, Mundo Segundo, Dealema and DJ Bomberjack.

The new school rapper Piruka has the most watched hip hop tuga song on YouTube, which is &quot;Se Eu Não Acordar Amanhã&quot;.

==History Of Hip Hop Tuga Concert 2019==
On March 8, 2019, a large concert took place called &quot;A História Do Hip-Hop Tuga&quot; (The History of Portuguese Hip Hop) at the Altice Arena, part of the Parque das Nações complex, in Lisbon. The show, produced by Música no Coração, featured many of the founding fathers of hip hop in Portugal, many with their roots directly from Africa. Performers included General D, Boss AC, Black Company, Chullage, NBC e Sir Scratch.

<text>Rippowam High School was once a public high school in Stamford, Connecticut, United States. The school opened in the fall of 1961 as the second high school in the city. The school derived its name from the Native American tribe that inhabited Stamford and the surrounding area before European settlement. The school mascot name was the &quot;Warriors,&quot; and the school colors were green and white. The name of its annual yearbook was &quot;Riptide&quot;.

Rippowam High School closed after the 1982-1983 school year and reopened as the Rippowam Cluster High School. After the closing of the Cluster High School, the building was used for adult education, temporary locations for both the Hart Elementary School and the Magnet Middle School, which became Scofield Magnet Middle School upon its move in 2001 to its permanent site on Scofieldtown Road (the former campus of the University of Connecticut, Stamford Campus) in North Stamford. Since 2001 its campus has been the permanent site of Rippowam Middle School.

The Academy of Information Technology and Engineering (AITE), a regional magnet high school that formerly shared the building with Rippowam Middle School, has occupied its own building behind Rippowam since August 2007.

Rippowam Middle School has a large auditorium, which it still shares with the AITE, and is home to its own drama group. It is also the host school for the city of Stamford&#x27;s All School Musical that involves every school in the city. The school&#x27;s current mascot, the Raptor, was decided by popular vote in its first year as a middle school by the first class of sixth graders.

<doc id="1337053" wikidata="Q2778442" url="?curid=1337053" title="Music of Final Fantasy X">
<text>The music of the video game &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; was composed by regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu, along with Masashi Hamauzu and Junya Nakano. It was the first title in the main &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series in which Uematsu was not the sole composer. The &quot;Final Fantasy X Original Soundtrack&quot; was released on four Compact Discs in 2001 by DigiCube, and was re-released in 2004 by Square Enix. Prior to the album&#x27;s North American release, a reduced version entitled &quot;Final Fantasy X Official Soundtrack&quot; was released on a single disk by Tokyopop in 2002. An EP entitled &quot;feel/Go dream: Yuna &amp; Tidus&quot; containing additional singles not present in the game was released by DigiCube in 2001. &quot;Piano Collections Final Fantasy X&quot;, a collection of piano arrangements of the original soundtracks by Masashi Hamauzu and performed by Aki Kuroda, was released by DigiCube in 2002 and re-released by Square EA in 2004. A collection of vocal arrangements of pieces from the game arranged by Katsumi Suyama along with radio drama tracks was released as &quot;Final Fantasy X Vocal Collection&quot; in 2002 by DigiCube.

The theme song for the game is titled &quot;Suteki da ne&quot;, which was performed by Japanese folk singer Ritsuki Nakano, known as &quot;RIKKI&quot;. The song was released as a single by DigiCube in 2001 and was re-released by Square Enix in 2004. The game&#x27;s music was well received overall; reviewers praised the additions to the soundtrack by the two new composers for the series. They especially praised Hamauzu, both for his work in the original soundtrack and in arranging the themes for &quot;Piano Collections Final Fantasy X&quot;. Several tracks, especially &quot;Suteki da ne&quot; and &quot;To Zanarkand&quot;, remain popular today and have been performed numerous times in orchestral concert series, as well as published in arranged and compilation albums by Square and outside groups.

==Creation and influence==
&quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; marks the first time Nobuo Uematsu has had any assistance in composing the score for a &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game. His fellow composers for &quot;X&quot; were Masashi Hamauzu and Junya Nakano. Uematsu contributed 51 tracks, Hamauzu contributed 20 and Nakano contributed 18 tracks to the game. The two new composers were chosen for the soundtrack based on their ability to create music that was different than Uematsu&#x27;s while still working together. Uematsu states that his music has been inspired by the music of popstar idols such as Elton John and Paul McCartney, and that his favorite part about the soundtrack is the good reviews from listeners. Nakano set out to create music with a &quot;vibrant and dynamic feel&quot; that tied together his years of experience with game music, while Hamauzu tried to use the soundtrack to bring video game music to &quot;greater heights&quot;.

&quot;To Zanarkand&quot; was originally written by Uematsu before the development of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, for the recital of a flutist friend named Seo. Uematsu eventually decided the track was too gloomy and kept it for a later use. When development of &quot;X&quot; started, he decided to use the track for the game.

==Albums==
===&quot;Final Fantasy X Original Soundtrack&quot;===

 is a soundtrack album of music from &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; composed, arranged and produced by Nobuo Uematsu, Masashi Hamauzu and Junya Nakano. Vocals are performed by RIKKI for &quot;Suteki da ne&quot;, Bill Muir for &quot;Otherworld&quot;, and choruses for &quot;Hymn of the Fayth&quot;. It spans four discs and 91 tracks, covering a duration of 4:32:26. It was first released in Japan on August 1, 2001 by DigiCube with catalog number &quot;SSCX-10054&quot;, and was re-released on May 10, 2004 by Square Enix with catalog number &quot;SQEX-10013&quot;.

In 2002, Tokyopop released a version of &quot;Final Fantasy X Original Soundtrack&quot; in North America entitled &quot;Final Fantasy X Official Soundtrack&quot;, which contained 17 tracks from the original album on a single disk. This release had the catalog number &quot;TPCD-0211-2&quot;. Additionally, in 2001, prior to the game&#x27;s release, Square released a promotional disk titled &quot;Final Fantasy X Promo CD&quot;, which contained edited versions of &quot;Other World&quot;, &quot;To Zanarkand&quot;, and &quot;Battle 1&quot;. The disk covers a length of 7:08, and was only released in Japan.

&quot;Final Fantasy X Original Soundtrack&quot; reached #4 on the Oricon charts, and sold 140,000 copies as of January 2010. The album was moderately well received; while some reviewers felt it to be an &quot;absolutely amazing&quot; soundtrack, others only found it to be a &quot;satisfying&quot; work. Some reviewers felt that of the three composers, Uematsu&#x27;s pieces were the weakest, citing them as having a tendency to be &quot;buried&quot; under the compositions of the others. The same reviewers, however, noted that some of the best pieces on the soundtrack, such as &quot;To Zanarkand&quot;, were the work of Uematsu. Hamauzu&#x27;s contributions were seen as some of his best work, and reviewers felt that both he and Nakano brought a &quot;myriad of new flavors&quot; to the soundtrack which were very well received. &quot;Final Fantasy X Official Soundtrack&quot;, although not re-released after the &quot;Original Soundtrack&quot; was brought to North America, was seen as a good sampler of the music from the full soundtrack.

Track listing


===&quot;feel/Go dream: Yuna &amp; Tidus&quot;===

&quot;feel/Go dream: Yuna &amp; Tidus&quot; is an EP containing tracks composed by Nobuo Uematsu and inspired by pieces from the game. &quot;feel&quot; was based on the &quot;Hymn of the Fayth&quot;, while &quot;Go dream&quot; was based on &quot;Tidus&#x27; Theme&quot;. Music arrangements were done by Masashi Hamauzu, Tsuyoshi Sekito, Junya Nakano, and Masayoshi Kikuchi. Vocals are performed by Mayuko Aoki for the track &quot;feel&quot; and Masakazu Morita for the track &quot;Go dream&quot;. A remix of &quot;feel&quot; was included as a bonus track in the &quot;Vocal Collection of Final Fantasy X&quot;. It was released in Japan by DigiCube on October 11, 2001, bearing the catalog number &quot;SSCX-10058&quot;. The EP reached #13 on the Oricon charts.

===&quot;Piano Collections Final Fantasy X&quot;===

&quot;Piano Collections Final Fantasy X&quot; is a collection of music from the original soundtrack arranged for the piano by Masashi Hamauzu, and performed by Aki Kuroda. Hamauzu intended the process of arranging the pieces to &quot;consider the groundwork of individual compositions in order to transform these pieces into piano arrangements&quot; rather than simply playing the themes on a piano as they originally sounded. It spans 15 tracks and covers a duration of 56:43. It was first released in Japan on February 20, 2002 by DigiCube with catalog number &quot;SSCX-10064&quot;, and was re-released on July 22, 2004 by Square Enix with catalog number &quot;SQEX-10028&quot;.

&quot;Piano Collections Final Fantasy X&quot; reached #89 on the Oricon charts and sold 2,900 copies. It was very well received, with reviewers finding it to be a &quot;great&quot; album, and stating that it was superior to most video game soundtracks, both piano or otherwise. They especially praised Hamauzu, terming him a &quot;very skilled arranger and performer&quot;.

===&quot;Final Fantasy X Vocal Collection&quot;===
 is a collection of vocal arrangements of pieces from the game arranged by Katsumi Suyama along with radio drama tracks, performed by the game&#x27;s characters&#x27; voice actors in Japanese. It spans 14 tracks and covers a duration of 42:21. It was released in Japan on December 18, 2002 by DigiCube with catalog number &quot;SSCX-10073&quot;. The album was poorly received by critics. They found the album, while it had &quot;pretty good&quot; vocals, to have overall poor sound quality and a clichéd musical style. While &quot;not a horrible album&quot;, they found that the collection was overpriced and under-produced. It reached #69 on the Oricon charts, and sold over 11,700 copies.

==Songs==
===Suteki da ne===
&quot;Suteki da ne&quot; is one of the main theme songs of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; and the vocal version of Yuna&#x27;s character theme. It was written by Nobuo Uematsu and Kazushige Nojima and was sung by Japanese folk singer Ritsuki Nakano, known as &quot;Rikki&quot;, whom the music team contacted while searching for a singer whose music reflected an Okinawan atmosphere. &quot;Suteki da ne&quot; is sung in its original Japanese form in both the Japanese and English versions of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;. The song&#x27;s title translates to &quot;Isn&#x27;t It Wonderful?&quot; in English, and its lyrics were written by scenario writer Kazushige Nojima, while Uematsu composed the instrumentals and Shirō Hamaguchi arranged the instrumentals. Similar to the ballad from &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;, &quot;Suteki da ne&quot; has an in-game version used in cutscenes, along with an orchestrated version used as part of the ending theme.

The song was released as a single by DigiCube on July 18, 2001, and re-released by Square Enix on July 22, 2004. The disk also contains an instrumental version, an unrelated song entitled &quot;Gotsuki-sama ~UTIKISAMA~&quot; (&quot;The Moon&quot;), and a vocal version of Aerith&#x27;s theme song from &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; titled &quot;Pure Heart&quot;. The single covers a duration of 20:35. The original release has a catalog number of &quot;SSCX-10053&quot;, and the re-release has a catalog number of &quot;SQEX-10029&quot;. The original release of &quot;Suteki da ne&quot; reached #10 on the Oricon charts, and sold 130,000 copies.

There is also an &quot;autumn version&quot; of the song, also performed by Ritsuki Nakano, released by Universal on October 3, 2001 on the &quot;KANARIA&quot; minialbum together with six unrelated tracks. The release has a catalog number of &quot;UMCK-1056&quot;. This version of the song, as well as all versions on the single, is also found on the Final Fantasy Single Collection bootleg CD, released by EverAnime with catalog number &quot;GM-496&quot;, by Archer Records with catalog number &quot;SA-007&quot; and by Miya Records with catalog number &quot;MICA-0068&quot;. An official English translation of the song was created for the &quot;Distant Worlds: Music from Final Fantasy&quot; concert series and was first performed in Chicago by vocalist Susan Calloway on December 12, 2009.

===Otherworld===
&quot;Otherworld&quot;, the opening theme of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, was composed by Nobuo Uematsu with lyrics by Alexander O. Smith. It was sung by Bill Muir, the frontman of xtillidiex (pronounced &quot;Till I die&quot;), a death metal band active in Tokyo at the time. The song was already fully formed when Smith was tasked with writing lyrics for it based on a guide track. Smith&#x27;s lyrics were loosely based on &quot;The Song of Wandering Aengus&quot;, a poem by W. B. Yeats. Smith mistook a guitar solo section of the song as another part that he had to fill with lyrics, and so he wrote in a spoken words part in &quot;one of those Limp Bizkit-style breakdowns&quot;. Uematsu liked the result and included it in the final song.

==Legacy==
The Black Mages, a band led by Nobuo Uematsu that arranges music from &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; video games into a rock music style, have arranged three pieces from &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;. These are &quot;Fight With Seymour&quot; from their self-titled album, published in 2003, and &quot;Otherworld&quot; and &quot;The Skies Above&quot;, both of which can be found on the album &quot;The Skies Above&quot;, published in 2004. Uematsu continues to perform certain pieces in his &quot;Dear Friends: Music from Final Fantasy&quot; concert series. The music of &quot;FFX&quot; has also appeared in various official concerts and live albums, such as &quot;20020220 Music from Final Fantasy&quot;, a live recording of an orchestra performing music from the series including several pieces from the game. Additionally, &quot;Swing de Chocobo&quot; was performed by the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra for the &quot;Distant Worlds - Music from Final Fantasy&quot; concert tour, while &quot;Zanarkand&quot; was performed by the New Japan Philharmonic Orchestra in the &quot;Tour de Japon: Music from Final Fantasy&quot; concert series. An arrangement of &quot;A Fleeting Dream&quot; was performed on July 9, 2011 at the &quot;Symphonic Odysseys&quot; concert, which commemorated the music of Uematsu. Independent but officially licensed releases of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; music have been composed by such groups as Project Majestic Mix, which focuses on arranging video game music. Selections also appear on Japanese remix albums, called dojin music, and on English remixing websites.

<doc id="1337057" wikidata="Q1003664" url="?curid=1337057" title="François Hanriot">
<text>François Hanriot (; 2 December 1759 – 28 July 1794) was a French Sans-culotte leader, street orator, and commander of the National Guard during the French Revolution. He played a vital role in the Insurrection of 31 May – 2 June 1793 and subsequently the fall of the Girondins. On 27 July 1794 he tried to release Maximilien Robespierre, who was arrested by the Convention. He was executed on the next daytogether with Robespierre, Saint-Just and Couthonby the rules of the law of 22 Prairial, only verifying his identity at the trial.

==Life==

===Early years===
François Hanriot was born in Nanterre, now a western suburb of Paris. His parents were servants (gardeners) to a former Treasurer of France, and came from Sormery in the Bourgogne. Between 1779 and 1783 he supposedly was a soldier in America serving under Lafayette, but there are no documents to prove that.

Not a man of any specific profession, Hanriot held a variety of different jobs. He took his first employment with a &quot;procureur&quot; doing mostly secretarial work but lost his position due to dishonesty. Next, he obtained a clerkship in the Paris &quot;octroi&quot; in 1789, doing tax work. His position there was also ill-fated; he was dismissed after leaving his station on the night of 12 July 1789, when the popular Jacques Necker was fired, and angry Parisians attempted to burn down the building belonging to the Wall of the Ferme générale. Hanriot was arrested and imprisoned in Bicêtre and released the next year with the help of Jean-Paul Marat. After his string of unfortunate professions, Hanriot remained unemployed and subsequently very poor. His next string of occupations is rather hazy in history; many people of the time connect him to a variety of professions including shopkeeper, liquor-seller, and peddler. He lived near the Jardin des Plantes at 21, Rue de la Clef.

===Role in the first years of the Revolution===
After generating a more substantial fortune he moved around the corner to Rue du Battoir, now Rue de Quatrefages. In January 1792, Hanriot became well known for his anti-aristocratic outlook and for attacking Lafayette. He became an orator for the local section &quot;sans-culottes&quot;, one of the most populous and poorest districts of the capital. On 9 August 1792, when the Assembly refused to impeach Lafayette, the called the sections into arms. In the evening the &quot;commissionaires&quot; of several sections (Billaud-Varenne, Chaumette, Hébert, Hanriot, Fleuriot-Lescot, Pache, Bourdon) gathered in the town hall. The next day the Tuileries was stormed by the National Guard, the Fédérés and the people from the revolutionary sections of Paris.

As a member of the Cordeliers club he was strongly in favor of imposing taxes on the aristocracy, presenting them &quot;with a bill in one hand and a pistol in the other.&quot; With this attitude he gained a loyal following of local &quot;sans-culottes&quot; and they would appoint him on 2 September as captain of the National Guard battalion of his section. It is unlikely he participated in the September Massacre as the Sainte-Pélagie Prison in his section was not visited at all. The next evening he was present at Bicêtre with his battalion. According to Cassignac his men were involved in the massacre.

===The Fall of the Girondists===

The Spring of 1793 was a period of great political tension in Paris as the radical voices in the Commune and the Montagnards in the Convention became more overtly hostile to the ruling Girondist faction. The authorities&#x27; decision to arrest Jean-Paul Marat in April brought matters to a head and precipitated the fall of the Girondins in which Hanriot played a major part. In the evening of 30 May 1793 the Commune appointed Hanriot provisionally to the position of &quot;Commandant-General&quot; of the Parisian National Guard, because Santerre was fighting in the Vendée. He was ordered to march his troops to the Palais National. The purpose of this move was to force the Convention to dissolve the Commission of Twelve and the arrest of 22 selected Girondists. Some people on the galleries called &quot;A la Vendée&quot;.

During the night of 30–31 May, the city gates were closed and at 3 the tocsin (in the Notre-Dame) was rung. Hanriot ordered the firing of a cannon on the Pont-Neuf as a sign of alarm, without the permission of the Convention. Vergniaud suggested the arrest of Hanriot. (Robespierre attacked Vergniaud and denounced the commission of Twelve.) In the evening of 1 June the Comité Insurrectionnel ordered the arrest of 27 Girondins, including Jean-Marie Roland, Lebrun-Tondu and Clavière, the banning of the Girondist newspapers and the arrest of their editors. It also ordered François Hanriot, to surround the Convention ‘with a respectable armed force’.

The Convention (about 100 deputies) decided to allow men to carry arms on days of crisis and pay them for each day. It also promised to indemnify the workers for the interruptions over the past four days. It postponed any other decisions regarding the accused deputies for three days. On Saturday 1 June the Commune gathered almost all day and was devoted to the preparation of a &quot;great movement&quot;. In the evening 40,000 men surrounded the building to force the arrests. Hanriot&#x27;s first care was to seize the key positions—the Arsenal, the &quot;Place Royale&quot;, and the &quot;Pont Neuf&quot;. Next, the barriers were closed and prominent suspects arrested. At midnight the commune decided the men should take a rest and go home. The next morning the Convention invited Hanriot, who told them all his men were prepared and posts occupied.

Hanriot ordered the National Guard to march from the town hall to the National Palace. In the early evening of 2 June, a large force of armed citizens; estimated by some sources as 80,000, but spoken of by Danton as 30,000 souls, surrounded the Convention with 63 pieces of artillery. &quot;The armed force&quot;, Hanriot said, &quot;will retire only when the Convention has delivered to the people the deputies denounced by the Commune.&quot; Attempting to exit, the accused Girondins walked around the palace in a theatrical procession. Confronted on all sides by bayonets and pikes, they returned to the meeting hall and submitted to the inevitable. Twenty-two Girondins were seized one by one after some juggling with names. They finally decided that 31 deputies were not to be imprisoned, but only subject to house arrest.

On 2 June 1793 at 11 in the morning, women gathered in front of the Convention. Then Hanriot&#x27;s troops surrounded the Convention with thousands of armed volunteers, cannons, and pikes while it was in session, and throngs of &quot;sans-culotte&quot; soldiers entered the building and disrupted the sessions. The President of the Convention, Herault de Sechelles, came out to appeal to Hanriot to remove his troops, but he refused. Under that pressure, the Convention voted the arrest of 22 Girondist deputies, removing that faction from power. Marat and Couthon regarded Hanriot as the &quot;Savior of the Fatherland&quot;. (Gérard Walter insists on the contrary on the perfect discipline of the men commanded by Hanriot. The historian thus attributes to the sans-culotte commander the merit of having avoided bloodshed during the exclusion and the arrest of the Girondins deputies.) On 11 June Hanriot resigned his command, declaring that order had been restored. On 29 June he was reelected in his section. On 1 July he was elected by the Commune and two days later appointed by Jean Bouchotte as permanent commander of the armed forces of Paris.

On 4 September, the &quot;sans-culottes&quot; again invaded the Convention. Supported by Hanriot they demanded tougher measures against rising prices and the setting up of a system of terror to root out the counter-revolution. On 11 September the power of the Committee of Public Safety was extended for one month; Robespierre supported Hanriot in the Jacobin club as having led the insurrection on 2 June. On 19 September the Convention supported his appointment as General commanding the Parisian National Guard (at that time numbering 130,000 men). Hanriot moved into an apartment on the third floor of the Hôtel de Ville, Paris, with busts of Brutus, Marat and Rousseau displayed. He hired seats in Théâtre de la République and Opera-Comique. On 8 December he declared that he would not use arms against the people; instead he would use reason.

===End of the Reign of Terror===
During the spring of 1794, there were increasing tensions between Robespierre and the Committees on the one hand, and the Paris Commune and the &quot;sans-culottes&quot; on the other. On 6 March Hanriot appeared in front of the Convention with 1,200 men. This culminated in the arrest of Hebert, Momoro, Vincent, Ronsin and their associates on 13 March. Hanriot, a Hébertist, was protected by Robespierre. On 27 March the sans-culotte Revolutionary Army was disbanded and its artillery units brought under Hanriot&#x27;s control. Although he was broadly supportive of the radical ideas of Hébert and his associates, Hanriot remained loyal to Robespierre. On 2 April 1794 – the first day of the interrogation of Danton – he was informed not to arrest the president and the public prosecutor of Revolutionary Tribunal.

Hanriot opposed Lazare Carnot who stripped Paris of its gunners. Hanriot managed to prevent the queues in front of the butchers and bakeries from turning into a riot. On 5 June François Hanriot ordered the detaining of every baker in Paris who either sold his bread to people without (distribution) cards or who came from other sections.

On 27 July 1794 a group of Convention members organised the overthrow of Robespierre and his allies in what became known as the Thermidorean Reaction. Laurent Lecointre was the instigator of the coup, assisted by Barère, Fréron, Barras, Tallien, Thuriot, Courtois, Rovère, Garnier de l’Aube and Guffroy. Each one of these prepared his individual role in the coup. They decided that Hanriot, his aides-de-camp, Lavalette and Boulanger, the public prosecutor Dumas, the family Duplay and the printer Charles-Léopold Nicolas had to be arrested first, so Robespierre would be without military or other effective support. 
At around 3 p.m. Hanriot was ordered to appear in the Convention. Hanriot, or someone else, suggested that he would only show up if accompanied by a crowd. Dumas had already been arrested at noon and at 4p.m. taken to Sainte-Pélagie Prison; as well as members of the family Duplay. On horseback, Hanriot warned the sections that there would be an attempt to murder Robespierre and mobilized 2,400 National Guards in front of the town hall. What had happened was not very clear to their officers; either the Convention was closed down or the Paris Commune. Nobody explained anything.

When the Paris Commune heard of the arrests it began mobilising forces to free Robespierre and his allies and to take control of the Convention. The mayor Fleuriot-Lescot instructed the prisons of Paris to refuse admission to any prisoners sent to them by the Convention and Hanriot took charge of military preparations for closing the Convention. 

When Hanriot appeared at the Place du Carrousel in front of the Convention, he was taken prisoner by the oldest deputy present Philippe Rühl. (He seems to have been taken prisoner earlier that day by :fr:Louis Antoine Joseph Robin near the Palais-Royal.) To avoid communication with Hanriot the five deputies were given a meal and it was decided they had to leave the Tuileries. According to Eric Hazan: &quot;Now came the turning-point of this journée: instead of taking advantage of its superiority, in both guns and men, to invade the nearby hall where the Convention was sitting, the column, lacking orders or leaders, returned to the Maison-Commune.&quot; According to Bertrand Barère Hanriot fled to the town hall after being threatened by some deputies that he could be regarded as an outlaw. The Convention did not gather before nine. 
The Convention declared the five deputies (plus the supporting members) to be outlaws. On hearing this, the insurgents and their commander were seized with fright and fled helter-skelter to the Commune. When the Paris&#x27; militants heard this news, order began to break down, they became divided. 

In the evening Robespierre, Hanriot, and the other liberated prisoners had gathered at the Hotel de Ville which was now their headquarters. The Convention responded by declaring them outlaws to be taken dead or alive, and ordering troops of its own under Barras to suppress them. Henriot ordered his men to light the entire square with torches. Within an hour, the forces of the Commune quietly deserted the square. Around two in the morning, troops of the Convention under the command of Barras arrived. Robespierre and a number of others were arrested. Hanriot fell from a side window, and was found later in the day, unconscious, in a neighbouring courtyard. Hanriot was taken to the guillotine in the same cart as Robespierre and his brother and was executed just before Robespierre on 28 July 1794, only semi-conscious when led to the platform.
According to Merda Hanriot tried to escape by a concealed staircase to the third floor. He lodged in an apartment there. Most sources say that Hanriot was thrown out of a window by Coffinhal after being accused of the disaster. (According to Ernest Hamel it is one of the many legends spread by Barère.) At any rate, Hanriot landed in a small courtyard on a heap of glass. He had strength enough to crawl into a drain where he was found twelve hours later and taken to the Conciergerie.

In the afternoon of 10 Thermidor (28 July, a décadi, a day of rest and festivity) the Revolutionary Tribunal condemned Robespierre and 21 &quot;Robespierrists&quot; (c.q. 13 members of the insurrectionary Commune) to death by the rules of the law of 22 Prairial, only verifying their identity at the trial. In the late afternoon, the convicts were taken in three carts to the Place de la Révolution to be executed.

Hanriot owned 47 prints of different events during the revolution, a &quot;magnifique&quot; wooden secretary desk, and the complete works by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, published by Pierre-Alexandre DuPeyrou and René Louis de Girardin (1780–1782).

<doc id="1337061" wikidata="Q786474" url="?curid=1337061" title="Stanley Jackson (cricketer)">
<text>Sir Francis Stanley Jackson (21 November 1870 – 9 March 1947), known as the Honourable Stanley Jackson during his playing career, was an English cricketer, soldier and Conservative Party politician. He played in 20 Test matches for the England cricket team between 1893 and 1905.

==Early life==
Jackson was born in Leeds. His father was William Jackson, 1st Baron Allerton. He was educated at Lockers Park School in Hertfordshire and Harrow School. During Stanley&#x27;s time at Harrow his fag was fellow parliamentarian and future Prime Minister Winston Churchill. He went up to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1889.

== Cricket career ==

Jackson played for Cambridge University, Yorkshire and England. He spotted the talent of Ranjitsinhji when the latter, owing to his unorthodox batting and his race, was struggling to find a place for himself in the university side, and as captain was responsible for Ranji&#x27;s inclusion in the Cambridge First XI and the awarding of his Blue. According to Alan Gibson this was &quot;a much more controversial thing to do than would seem possible to us now&quot;. He was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1894.

He captained England in five Test matches in 1905, winning two and drawing three to retain The Ashes. Captaining England for the first time, he won all five tosses and topped the batting and bowling averages for both sides, with 492 runs at 70.28 and 13 wickets at 15.46. These were the last of his 20 Test matches, all played at home as he could not spare the time to tour. Jackson still holds the Test record for the most matches in a career without playing away from home.

An orthodox batsman with a penchant for forcing strokes in front of square on both sides of the wicket he was regarded as a very sound player of fast bowling. His own bowling was a brisk fast medium, with a good off cutter his main weapon. While his commitments outside of cricket limited the number of games he played he was a key member of the very strong Yorkshire sides who won 6 county championships during his career (although this did include 1901 when Jackson did not appear in the county championship). His performances in 1896 and 1898 in particular showed what his statistics could have been if he had been able to dedicate more time, scoring over 1,000 championship runs at better than 40.00 in each season and taking over 100 wickets across the two seasons at an average of under 20.

He was also the first batsman to be dismissed in the so-called &quot;nervous nineties&quot; on Test debut.

Gibson wrote of him as a cricketer that he had &quot;a toughness of character, a certain ruthlessness behind the genial exterior... He does not seem to have been a particularly popular man, though he was always a deeply respected one.&quot;

He was President of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1921.

Jackson succeeded Lord Hawke as President of Yorkshire County Cricket Club in 1938 after Hawke&#x27;s death and held the post until his own death in 1947.

== Military and political career ==
As a former lieutenant in the Harrow School Volunteers, on 16 January 1900 Jackson was gazetted to a captaincy direct rather than being promoted in the normal way. He was appointed captain in 3rd (1st Royal Lancashire Militia) Battalion, King&#x27;s Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster). He left with his battalion in February 1900 to serve in the Second Boer War, and arrived in South Africa the following month. He transferred to the West Yorkshire Regiment as a Lieutenant-Colonel in 1914.

He was elected as a Member of Parliament at a by-election in February 1915, representing Howdenshire (Yorkshire) until resigning his seat on 3 November 1926. He served as Financial Secretary to the War Office 1922–23. In 1927 he was appointed Governor of Bengal and in that year was knighted with the GCIE and was made a member of the Privy Council. In 1928 while he was Governor of Bengal, he inaugurated The Malda District Central Co-operative Bank Ltd in Malda District of Bengal to promote co-operative movements. He was awarded the KStJ in 1932.

On 6 February 1932, Jackson sidestepped and ducked five pistol shots fired at close range by a girl student named Bina Das in the Convocation Hall of the University of Calcutta. Escaping unharmed and smiling, &quot;[e]ven before the smoke had blown away, the Governor resumed his speech amid cheers.&quot; The attacker was tackled and disarmed by Lieutenant-Colonel Hassan Suhrawardy (the first Muslim vice chancellor of the University of Calcutta), who was knighted by the King for his heroism. Later that year, Jackson was appointed GCSI.

==Family==
Jackson married Julia Harrison-Broadley, daughter of Henry Harrison-Broadley, of Welton House, Brough, Yorkshire, at St. Helen&#x27;s Church, Welton, East Yorkshire, on 5 November 1902.

They had one son, Major Henry Jackson (1903-1962), who married Grace Beddard, his cousin (a granddaughter of Lord Allerton).

== Funeral ==

Jackson died in London of complications following a road accident. Recalling his funeral, the Bishop of Knaresborough remarked &quot;As I gazed down on the rapt faces of that vast congregation, I could see how they revered him as though he were the Almighty, though, of course, infinitely stronger on the leg side.&quot;

<text>Suharto resigned as President of Indonesia on 21 May 1998 following the collapse of support for his 32-year long presidency. Vice President B. J. Habibie took over the presidency.

Suharto&#x27;s grip on power weakened following severe economic and political crises stemming from the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The economy suffered a flight of foreign capital, leading to a drastic drop in the value of the Indonesian rupiah, which severely impacted the economy and people&#x27;s livelihoods.

Suharto was re-elected to his seventh term by the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly in March 1998. Increasing political unrest and violence undermined his previously firm political and military support, leading to his May 1998 resignation. Initially under newly installed President Habibie, a period of political reform (&quot;Reformasi&quot;) followed.

== Historical background ==

=== Dissent during the New Order ===

Having consolidated power in 1967 in the aftermath of the attempted coup in 1965 which was launched by middle-ranking officers in the Indonesian army and air force but officially blamed on the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) resulting in purges, the government of Suharto adopted policies that severely restricted civil liberties and instituted a system of rule that effectively split power between the Golkar organisation and the military.

In 1970, price rises and corruption prompted student protests and an investigation by a government commission. Suharto responded by banning student protest, forcing the activists underground. Only token prosecution of cases recommended by the commission was pursued. The pattern of co-opting a few of his more powerful opponents while criminalising the rest became a hallmark of Suharto&#x27;s rule.

Suharto stood for election by the People’s Consultative Assembly every five years, beginning in 1973. According to his electoral rules, three entities were allowed to participate in the election: two political parties and Golkar. All other political parties were amalgamated into either the Islam-based United Development Party (PPP) or the nationalist Democratic Party of Indonesia (PDI). Golkar, Suharto&#x27;s primary political vehicle, was officially not a political party. All senior civil servants were obliged to join employee associations linked to Golkar, while senior bureaucrats were banned from joining political parties. In a political compromise with the powerful military, Suharto banned its members from voting in elections but set aside seats in the legislature for their representatives. Suharto was unopposed in every election in which he stood (being 1973, 1978, 1983, 1988, 1993, and 1998).

In May 1980, a group called the Petition of Fifty (&quot;Petisi 50&quot;) demanded greater political freedoms and accused Suharto of misinterpreting the Pancasila state ideology. It was signed by former military men, politicians, academics and students. The Indonesian media suppressed the news, and the government placed restrictions on the signatories, some of whom were later jailed.

Following the end to the Cold War, Western concern over communism waned, and Suharto&#x27;s human rights record came under greater international scrutiny. In 1991, the murder of East Timorese civilians in a Dili cemetery, also known as the &quot;Santa Cruz Massacre&quot;, caused US attention to focus on its military relations with the Suharto regime and the question of Indonesia&#x27;s occupation of East Timor. In 1992, this attention resulted in the Congress of the United States passing limitations on IMET assistance to the Indonesian military, over the objections of US President George H. W. Bush. In 1993, under President Bill Clinton, the US delegation to the United Nations Human Rights Commission helped pass a resolution expressing deep concern over Indonesian human rights violations in East Timor.

=== The first cracks emerge ===

In 1996, the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), a legal party that had been used by the New Order as a benign prop for the New Order&#x27;s electoral system, began to assert its independence under Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter of Indonesia&#x27;s founding father, Sukarno. In response, Suharto attempted to foster a split over the leadership of the PDI, backing a co-opted faction loyal to deputy speaker of Parliament Suryadi against supporters of Megawati. After the Suryadi faction announced a party congress to sack Megawati would be held in Medan on 20–22 June, Megawati proclaimed that her supporters would hold demonstrations in protest. The Suryadi faction went through with the sacking, and the demonstrations manifested themselves throughout Indonesia.

Megawati&#x27;s supporters then took over the PDI headquarters in Jakarta. On Saturday 27 July, a mob including soldiers in civilian clothing and thugs from the army-associated Pemuda Pancasila organization forcibly entered the building. According to the National Human Rights Commission, five people were killed, 149 injured and 74 missing – mostly from those arrested by the military. The attack was followed by two days of rioting, in which youths burned at least six buildings, including that of the Ministry of Agriculture. The political tensions in Jakarta were accompanied by anti-Chinese riots in Situbondo (1996), Tasikmalaya (1996), Banjarmasin (1997), and Makassar (1997); while violent ethnic clashes broke out between the Dayak and Madurese settlers in Central Kalimantan in 1997.

== Fall of Suharto ==
=== Monetary and financial crisis ===

In the second half of 1997, Indonesia became the country hardest hit by the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The economy suffered a flight of foreign capital leading to the Indonesian rupiah falling from Rp 2,600 per dollar in August 1997 to over Rp 14,800 per dollar by January 1998. Indonesian companies with US dollar-denominated borrowings struggled to service these debts with their rupiah earnings, and many went bankrupt. Efforts by Bank Indonesia to defend its managed float regime by selling US dollars not only had little effect on the currency&#x27;s decline, but also drained Indonesia&#x27;s foreign exchange reserves. Weaknesses in the Indonesian economy, including high levels of debt, inadequate financial management systems and crony capitalism, were identified as underlying causes. Volatility in the global financial system and over-liberalization of international capital markets were also cited. The government responded by floating the currency, requesting International Monetary Fund assistance, closing some banks and postponing major capital projects.

In December 1997, Suharto for the first time did not attend an ASEAN presidents&#x27; summit, which was later revealed to be due to a minor stroke, creating speculation about his health and the immediate future of his presidency. In mid-December, as the crisis swept through Indonesia and an estimated $150 billion of capital was being withdrawn from the country, he appeared at a press conference to assure he was in charge and to urge people to trust the government and the collapsing rupiah.

Suharto&#x27;s attempts to re-instil confidence, such as ordering generals to personally reassure shoppers at markets and an &quot;I Love the Rupiah&quot; campaign, had little effect. Another plan was the setting up of a currency board, proposed by the then special counselor Steve Hanke from Johns Hopkins University. The next day, the rupiah went up by 28% against the US dollar on both the spot and one year forward market, hearing the proposed plan. However, these developments infuriated the US government and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Suharto was told – by both the president of the United States, Bill Clinton, and the managing director of the IMF, Michel Camdessus – that he would have to drop the currency board idea or forego $43 billion in foreign assistance.

Evidence suggested that Suharto&#x27;s family and associates were being spared the most stringent requirements of the IMF reform process, and there was open conflict between economic technocrats implementing IMF plans and Suharto-related vested interests, further undermining confidence in the economy. The government&#x27;s unrealistic 1998 budget and Suharto&#x27;s announcement of Habibie as the next vice president both caused further currency instability. Suharto reluctantly agreed to a wider-reaching IMF package of structural reforms in January 1998 in exchange for $43 billion in liquidity (with a third letter of intent with the IMF being signed in April of that year). However, the rupiah dropped to a sixth of its pre-crisis value, and rumours and panic led to a run on stores and pushed up prices. In January 1998, the government was forced to provide emergency liquidity assistance (BLBI), issue blanket guarantees for bank deposits, and set up the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency to take over management of troubled banks in order to prevent the collapse of the financial system. Based on the IMF recommendations, the government increased interest rates to 70% pa in February 1998 to control high inflation caused by the higher prices of imports. However, this action restricted the availability of credit to the corporate sector.

=== Unrest, violence, and riots ===
Despite the worsening economic situation, during the 1998 General Session of the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly, Suharto was unanimously re-elected president, with vice president Try Sutrisno being replaced by minister and longtime confidant B. J. Habibie. Suharto&#x27;s choice of Habibie was poorly received, causing the rupiah to continue its fall. All the while, he stacked the new Seventh Development Cabinet with several of his own family and business associates. The government&#x27;s increase of fuel prices by 70% in May triggered rioting in Medan, North Sumatra. With Suharto increasingly seen as the source of the country&#x27;s mounting economic and political crises, prominent political figures, including Muslim politician Amien Rais, spoke out against his presidency, and in January 1998, university students began organizing nationwide demonstrations.

A demonstration at the Bandung Institute of Technology saw 500 demonstrators, and by March, larger demonstrations had occurred at other universities. Including the University of Indonesia and Gadjah Mada University. On 9 May 1998, a police officer, Dadang Rusmana, was reported to have been killed at a demonstration at Djuanda University. These demonstrators were protesting against massive price rises for fuel and energy, and were demanding that President Suharto step down.
On 9 May, Suharto left Indonesia for a Group of 15 summit in Cairo, Egypt. Meanwhile, at Jakarta&#x27;s Trisakti University, university students planned to march towards the Parliamentary Complex, but security forces refused to allow them to leave the campus of the university. Students then conducted a sit-in outside the gates of the campus, there men in Mobile Brigade Corps uniforms appeared on the flyover overlooking Trisakti. They fired at the students, killing four (Elang Mulia Lesmana, Heri Hertanto, Hafidin Royan, and Hendriawan Sie), and injuring dozens more.

The student&#x27;s deaths sparked mass violence and riots throughout Jakarta the following day, forcing Suharto to return on 14 May. Despite Suharto&#x27;s return, riots occurred throughout the city. In Jatinegara, East Jakarta, a Matahari department store was barricaded and torched, killing around a thousand people. In Glodok, West Jakarta, mobs attacked Jakarta&#x27;s Chinatown, with store owners being forced to pay local thugs to protect them from violence. Riots also occurred near the port of Tanjung Priok in Northern Jakarta, the city of Tangerang, Banten, and Kebayoran Baru in Southern Jakarta, with Chinese-owned property being the main targets. Over a thousand and as many as five thousand people died during these riots in Jakarta and other cities such as Surakarta. Many victims died in burning malls and supermarkets, but some were shot or beaten to death. The riots destroyed thirteen markets, 2,479 shop-houses, 40 malls, 1,604 shops, 45 garages, 383 private offices, nine petrol stations, eight public buses and minivans, 1,119 cars, 821 motorcycles, and 1,026 houses.

Indonesian Muslims who physically looked Chinese were attacked by rioters, despite not identifying as Chinese at all and only having one distant Chinese great grandfather. An Indonesian Muslim woman who had 5 sons, Ruminah, mentioned she had just one Chinese grandfather who married a local Muslim woman and she did not identify as Chinese at all or speak Chinese but she and her family were constantly harassed and hated by their neighbours just for their Chinese physical looks and her hair salon was ransacked and one of her sons died in a fire at the mall during the riots.

=== Military involvement in the riots ===
At the time, the Indonesian military had been split into two differing factions. The &quot;red and white&quot; nationalist faction led by Armed Forces commander General Wiranto, and the &quot;green&quot; Islamist faction headed by Prabowo Subianto. Prabowo, who was the commander of Kostrad (the strategic reserve, the division in which Suharto himself took power during the 1960&#x27;s), was friends with Muchdi Purwopranjono, who ran the &quot;Kopassus&quot; (special forces), and another, Syafrie Samsuddin, headed the Jakarta Regional Command. During the riots, both Muchdi and Syafrie failed to order their troops to quell the riots, and a report subsequently emerged that Syafrie had actually been in radio contact with the gangs terrorizing the city. It is possible that Prabowo hoped the riots would discredit his rival Wiranto and result in Suharto appointing Prabowo to head the armed forces.

Meanwhile, other allegations surfaced of the military being actively involved with the riots. A security officer alleged that during the riots, &quot;Kopassus&quot; (special forces) officers had ordered the burning down of a bank. A taxi driver reported hearing a man in a military helicopter encouraging people on the ground to carry out looting. Shop owners at a plaza claimed that before the riots, military officers tried to extract protection money. A teenager claimed he and thousands of others had been trained as protesters. A street child alleged that &quot;Kopassus&quot; officers ordered him and his friends to become rioters. There was a report of soldiers being dressed up as students and taking part in the rioting. Eyewitnesses spoke of the destruction being organized, with bands of men with short haircuts directing looters into shops, malls and banks, and of rioters being transported in military trucks. Rape victims testified that ethnic Chinese women were targeted, with assaults planned in advance.

=== Government response ===
The violence and riots, which occurred throughout the country, drew the government&#x27;s attention. On 6 May, Wiranto, Prabowo&#x27;s aforementioned rival, toured the affected areas, and helped restore calm to the streets. On 8 May, two days later, Prabowo himself, deployed one of his units &quot;to support local troops and assured the public that others were ready to go into troubled areas should the need arise&quot;. However, neither efforts were able to fully contain the violence, as riots continued in Medan, fueling speculation from the public that very few orders were carried out by the deployed units.

Order was finally restored when regional military commander Yuzaini requested the help of community leaders and youth organizations to arrange for local patrols (&quot;&quot;), to patrol with security forces. However, inaction on the government&#x27;s part continued, with responses to the violence being inconsistent. In the northern area of Mangga Besar, Jakarta, soldiers, allegedly stood by and allowed looters to walk away with stolen goods. While in Slipi, West Jakarta, soldiers reportedly risked their lives to protect civilians. In Surakarta (Solo), Armed Forces representative Colonel Sriyanto denied allegations of neglect, claiming that ground forces were limited and few due to units being transferred to Jakarta with only a few soldiers left to assist the police in controlling protesters at the Muhammadiyah University. For the most part, the military portrayed the violence &quot;in terms of mobs gone mad, acting in an uncontrollable and spontaneous manner, outnumbering security forces&quot;.

=== Resignation of Suharto ===
Following the riots, on 18 May, Suharto loyalists and speaker of the People&#x27;s Representative Council Harmoko called for Suharto to step down from the presidency within five days, at a press conference. This was a great surprise to many, including to Suharto himself, and other loyalists of Suharto. Suharto himself saw Harmoko&#x27;s request as a betrayal and loyalists referred to Harmoko as &quot;Brutus&quot;, a reference to the Roman Senator Marcus Junius Brutus, who killed his great-uncle Julius Caesar. Meanwhile, Amien Rais, leader of the Islamic organisation Muhammadiyah, declared he would organize a demonstration of a million supporters to call for Suharto&#x27;s resignation. This was planned for 20 May, celebrated as Indonesia&#x27;s National Awakening. On the evening of 18 May, influential Muslim intellectual Nurcholish Madjid, who had held various meetings with generals and civilians, met with Suharto. The meeting ended with Suharto telling Nurcholish of his intention to resign &quot;as soon as possible&quot; following a meeting with Muslim leaders. This two-hour meeting took place on the morning of 19 May. Afterwards, Suharto announced to the nation that he would reshuffle the cabinet and set up a reform committee to plan new elections.

Following a warning from a Prabowo ally of possible bloodshed, Amien Rais called off the demonstration. On 20 May, there was a &quot;massive show of force&quot; from the military, with soldiers and armored vehicles on the streets of Jakarta. Prabowo wanted a robust response to the demonstrators, but Wiranto realized that the Suharto era was coming to an end and was more receptive to the students&#x27; demands. According to sources of &quot;The Jakarta Post&quot;, Wiranto visited Suharto at home and asked the president to resign. On the same day, some of Suharto&#x27;s allies refused to serve in a new cabinet. Facing a threat of impeachment from Harmoko, and having received a letter from 14 cabinet members rejecting the formation of a new cabinet, Suharto decided to resign. At 9 a.m. on 21 May, Suharto made a short speech of resignation. He was immediately replaced by Vice President B. J. Habibie. Allegedly, late on the evening of 21 May, Prabowo arrived at the presidential palace and demanded that he be made head of the army, and that Wiranto be replaced as chief of the armed forces. Reportedly, Habibie escaped from the palace. The following day, Prabowo was sacked as head of Kostrad. Wiranto remained as chief of the armed forces, and his troops began removing the students from the parliament building.

==== Transcript ====








==Post-Suharto era==

Not so often reported was the silent departure of families and wealth from the country. The emigrants were not exclusively of Chinese descent, but also included wealthy natives (pribumi) and Suharto&#x27;s cronies. The immediate destination was Singapore, where some stayed permanently while others moved on to Australia, the US and Canada. Many of these families returned when the political situation stabilised a few years later.

Since the fall of the New Order, there has been a variety of state-sponsored initiatives to address the widespread abuses of human rights since the fall of Suharto. A report issued by the International Center for Transitional Justice and the Indonesian Commission for Disappeared Persons and Victims of Violence (KontraS) concluded that, that &quot;senior government officials consistently failed to achieve truth, accountability, institutional reform and reparations for the most severe crimes.

<text>Cassegrain is a lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon, beyond the southeastern limb. It lies to the southeast of the larger crater Lebedev, and to the northeast of the comparably-sized Priestley. It is named after the inventor of the Cassegrain reflector, who was later identified as most likely Laurent Cassegrain.

The interior of this crater has a relatively dark-hued floor, a feature it has in common with other craters to the west and northwest that form part of the Mare Australe. The floor is level and mostly featureless, except for some deposits in the northwest corner. The rim is more heavily worn in the northwest corner than elsewhere, and the remaining inner wall displays a slumped shelf below the rim.

The crater features prominently in the science fiction novel &quot;The Cassandra Project,&quot; by Jack McDevitt and Mike Resnick, Ace Books, New York, 2012.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Cassegrain.

<text>Guilly d&#x27;Herbemont (25 June 1888 – 28 February 1980) was the inventor of the white cane for blind people. Guilly was the daughter of a Belgian and a Frenchman. She was born in Brussels as a child, she lived alternately in Brussels and Paris. She later moved to Paris as a musician and writer. It occurred to her that blind people on the streets of Paris were increasingly endangered by the motorization of transport. The police in France used white signal sticks to regulate traffic and stop cars. Ms d&#x27;Herbemont had the idea of putting the color white on sticks for visually impaired and blind transporters in order to draw attention to themselves.

In 1930, d&#x27;Herbemont wrote a letter to the director of the national daily newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Écho de Paris&quot;. This letter was published causing much consternation. After the letter was published, the World Blind Union recommended this innovation to be used globally to governments, and the white cane officially became the symbol of the blind.

On 7 February 1931 d&#x27;Herbemont symbolically presented, in the presence of several ministers, the first two white canes. These were given to a blind soldier and a blind civilian. These were followed by the distribution of 5000 white canes to blind French veterans from World War I and blind civilians.

==Works and legacy==
Before she invented the white cane, Guilly d’Herbemont was active in helping the blind community. She frequently accompanied the blind through Paris crossroads (1). In one instance, while she was helping a group of blind people to cross a Parisian boulevard, a car appeared that nearly knocked everyone down (2).This was what gave her the inspiration to come up with a tool that the blind could use in traffic. Her idea wasn’t unanimously approved at first. Some of the representatives from many associations thought that this distinctive sign would be badly perceived by some individuals that were concerned not “to post” their handicap (3). As valid of a concern as it may be, even a monumental innovation such as the white stick for the blind community was met with a lot of resistance by many. In addition, Guilly d’Herbemont’s name often doesn’t come up when we think about important innovators, or even women inventors.

==Evolution of the White Cane==
After World War 1, there was a significant number of blind veterans in France. Motor Vehicles in Paris did not have headlights, and blind individuals in the streets did not have access to the white stick of police officers (4). Guilly recognized this problem and was instrumental in starting the movement that was responsible for making the use of white canes for civilians more widespread. Due to her efforts, drivers had an easier time stopping their vehicles for visually impaired individuals.

After Guilly’s involvement in the development of the white cane, another important innovation was the development of the “Hoover Method” (5). Towards the end of World War II, Richard Hoover, an army sergeant and a former teacher at a school for the blind in Baltimore in the United States, was assigned to a centre for the treatment of blinded soldiers in the Valley Forge Army Hospital. There he spent a week walking around blindfolded with a white cane, swinging it back and forth in front of his feet to avoid obstacles. This technique, known as the Hoover method, is now taught to visually impaired people all over the world to help them travel independently (4).

Even though there have been many technological developments that were designed to improve the white cane, Guilly’s innovation has fundamentally been unchanged.

<doc id="1337083" wikidata="Q595266" url="?curid=1337083" title="Catalán (crater)">
<text>Catalán is a small lunar impact crater that lies almost along the southwest limb of the Moon. At this position the crater is ill-suited for observation from the Earth as it is viewed almost from the side, and visibility is subject to libration effects. It lies to the west of the somewhat larger crater Baade, and south-southeast of Graff. This region is located in the outer southeastern part of the skirt of ejecta that surrounds the Mare Orientale impact basin, and the nearby surface is rugged and streaky. This crater is named after the Spanish scientist Miguel Antonio Catalán Sañudo (1894–1957) for his contributions to spectroscopy, an important exploratory tool in astronomy.

This is a somewhat irregular crater, although in general form it is circular. The rim is sharp-edged and displays little appearance of erosion. Sections of the inner wall appear to have slumped along the north and southeast, forming notches in the rim. The interior floor is rough and irregular, with no central peak of note.

Due west of Catalán, the satellite craters Catalán A and the smaller Catalán B form a joined pair, with each having a sharp rim and a bowl-shaped interior. To the northwest of Catalán A is the nearly symmetrical, bowl-shaped Catalán U.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Catalán.

<text>Chaffee is a lunar impact crater that is located in the southern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. It lies within the huge walled plain Apollo, and is one of several craters in that formation named for astronauts and people associated with the Apollo program. This basin is a double-ringed formation, and the crater Chaffee is situated across the southwest part of the inner ring. The ridge from this ring extends northward from the northern rim of Chaffee.

This is a circular crater with an outer rim that has an uneven form due to multiple small outward bulges. The perimeter is only slightly worn, and retains a sharp rim that projects above the surroundings. Two notable craters are attached to the outer rim: Chaffee F to the west and Chaffee W along the northwest. Chaffee actually intrudes somewhat into the former crater, and the two share a common rim.

The inner walls of Chaffee do not have a well-formed system, and they slope downward to debris piles that extend part way across the floor. Parts of the interior floor are relatively level and featureless. However, there are several small craters lying in the northern half, particularly to the northwest of the midpoint.

The crater was named in 1970 by the IAU after astronaut Roger Chaffee, killed in the Apollo 1 fire. The nearby craters White and Grissom were named after the other two astronauts killed in the disaster, Ed White and Gus Grissom.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Chaffee.

<text>Ulrich Boner, or Bonerius, (fl. early 14th century), was a German-speaking Swiss writer of fable.

He was born in Bern, descended of an old Bernese family and, as far as can be ascertained, took clerical orders and became a monk; yet as it appears that he subsequently married, it is certain that he received the tonsure only, and was thus entitled to the benefit of the &quot;clerici uxoriati&quot;, who, on divesting themselves of the clerical garb, could return to secular life. He is mentioned in records between 1324 and 1349, but neither before nor after these dates.

He wrote, in Middle High German, a collection of fables entitled &quot;Der Edelstein&quot; (&#x27;The Jewel&#x27;) (c. 1349), one hundred in number, which were based principally on those of Avianus (4th century) and the Anonymus Neveleti (edited by Isaac Nicolas Nevelet, 1610). He dedicated this work to the Bernese patrician and poet, , advocatus (&quot;Vogt&quot;) of Brienz (d. c. 1350). It was printed in 1461 at Bamberg by Albrecht Pfister and was one of the first books printed in the German language.

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition&quot;,
&quot;Der Edelstein&quot; was edited by GF Benecke (Berlin, 1816) and Franz Pfeiffer (Leipzig, 1844);
a translation into modern German by Karl Pannier will be found in &quot;&quot; (Leipzig, 1895). See also GE Lessing in &quot;Zur Geschichte und Literatur&quot; (Werke, ix.); and Christian Waas, &quot;Die Quellen der Beispiele Boners&quot; (Giessen, 1897).

<text>Rockville Cemetery is a cemetery in Rockville, Maryland, United States. It is the oldest burial ground in the Rockville community. It sometimes is referred to as Rockville Union Cemetery, although that has never been its name.

==Physical features==
Rockville Cemetery is located on the eastern edge of Rockville at 1350 Baltimore Road, adjacent to the Rockville Civic Center. It occupies in two sections, an older, western or upper section of and a newer, eastern or lower section of almost . The western or upper section is an example of the &quot;rural cemetery&quot; movement with a picturesque landscape, curving roads, monuments, and plantings, while the eastern or lower section is a lawn cemetery. The two sections are divided by both a stream and a dramatic change in elevation between the higher western and lower eastern sections.

==History==
The Anglican Prince George&#x27;s Parish established a chapel in what is now the western or upper section of Rockville Cemetery in 1738, and by around 1740 a graveyard had been established as burials began on the chapel&#x27;s grounds; the oldest surviving stone grave marker dates to 1752. Almost a century later, Christ Episcopal Church moved from the old chapel into the City of Rockville, but burials continued at the graveyard.

Ownership of the cemetery changed in 1880, when five Protestant denominations incorporated the Rockville Cemetery Association of Montgomery County and made the cemetery a community burial space open to all. By that time, the neglected cemetery had fallen into disrepair and become a veritable wilderness, but the new ownership revitalized interest in its care and maintenance during the 1880s. A women&#x27;s group, the Rockville Union Cemetery Association, took responsibility for the management and maintenance of the cemetery and beautified the property. In 1889, a caretaker&#x27;s cottage and outbuilding were constructed at the cemetery.

Demand for space led to the expansion of Rockville Cemetery to include its lower, eastern section, which was laid out in 1936. The City of Rockville annexed the cemetery in 1984. 

Interest in maintenance of the cemetery waned again, and by the late 20th century it again had fallen into disrepair. Public outcry over its physical condition led to the incorporation in 2001 of the nonprofit Rockville Cemetery Association, Inc. The association reinvigorated efforts to maintain the property and improve its appearance, overseeing repairs to the 1889 caretaker&#x27;s cottage and outbuilding, renovation of the cemetery&#x27;s internal roads, drainage improvements, the repair of hundreds of damaged and fallen tombstones, and the installation of road signs to direct visitors to the graves of their loved ones and to those of notable people buried at the cemetery.

The Rockville Cemetery Association&#x27;s financial position improved significantly between 2014 and 2020 thanks to substantial growth in grave sales and burials. During these years, the Association continued to convert all of the cemetery&#x27;s records to a digital format, standardized grave site codification, created high-quality section maps, expanded and enhanced the cemetery&#x27;s website, refurbished and upgraded the caretaker&#x27;s cottage and gave it a public water connection, completed the planting of more than 30 trees, and expanded the cemetery&#x27;s program of community events.

==Notable burials==
More than 4,600 people are buried at Rockville Cemetery. Notable burials include:

* Upton Beall (1770–1827), second clerk of the court of Montgomery County
* Richard Johns Bowie (1807–1881), U.S Congressman (1849–1853), chief judge of the Maryland Court of Appeals (1861–1867)
* Stephen Clusky Cromwell, Jr. (1925–2015), first president of the Rockville Cemetery Association (2001–2014) and descendant of Rebecca Viers
* John G. England (1845–1913), mayor of Rockville (1894–1896)
* John Trumbull Garvin (1892-1943), American diplomat
* John Harding (1685–1752), whose tombstone is the oldest remaining stone marker in the cemetery
* Walter Johnson (1887–1946), Hall-of-Fame pitcher for the Washington Senators, manager of the Senators and the Cleveland Indians, and Montgomery County commissioner
* William Pinckney Mason (1843–1922), Confederate States Navy officer
* Paul Peck (1889–1912), aviation pioneer
* E. Barrett Prettyman (1891–1971), senior judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (1962–1971)
* E. Barrett Prettyman Jr. (1925–2016), prominent Washington, D.C., lawyer, son of E. Barrett Prettyman
* Members of the Pumphrey family of carpenters and undertakers
* Edward Elisha Stonestreet (1830–1903), Rockville physician and town councilman
* Rebecca Thomas Viers &quot;née&quot; Bialys (1833–1918), leader of the Rockville Union Cemetery Association

The author F. Scott Fitzgerald was buried in Rockville Cemetery upon his death in 1940, as was his wife Zelda Fitzgerald, who died in 1948. Their remains were moved to Saint Mary&#x27;s Cemetery, also in Rockville, in 1975.

<doc id="1337107" wikidata="Q17104788" url="?curid=1337107" title="Zero copula">
<text>Zero copula, also known as null copula, is a linguistic phenomenon whereby the subject is joined to the predicate without overt marking of this relationship (like the copula &quot;to be&quot; in English). One can distinguish languages that simply do not have a copula and languages that have a copula that is optional in certain contexts.

Many languages exhibit this in some contexts, including Assamese, Bengali, Kannada, Malay/Indonesian, Filipino/Tagalog, Turkish, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Hindi, Guarani, Kazakh, Turkmen, Chinese, Japanese, Ukrainian, Russian, Belarusian, Tatar, Azerbaijani, Swahili, Hungarian, Hebrew, Arabic, Berber, Ganda, Hawaiian, Sinhala, Irish, Welsh, Nahuatl, Māori, Mongolian, Greenlandic, Lithuanian, Latvian, Polish, Slovak, Quechua, and American Sign Language.

Dropping the copula is also found, to a lesser extent, in English and many other languages, used most frequently in rhetoric, casual speech, non-standard varieties, and headlinese, the writing style used in newspaper headlines. Sometimes, these omissions cause unintended syntactic ambiguity.

==In English==

Standard English exhibits a few limited forms of the zero copula. One is found in comparative correlatives like &quot;the bigger, the better&quot; and &quot;&quot;. However, no known natural language lacks this structure, and it is not clear how a comparative is joined with its correlate in this kind of copula. Zero copula also appears in casual questions and statements like &quot;you from out of town?&quot; and &quot;enough already!&quot; where the verb (and more) may be omitted due to syncope. It can also be found, in a slightly different and more regular form, in the headlines of English newspapers, where short words and articles are generally omitted to conserve space. For example, a headline would more likely say &quot;Parliament at a standstill&quot; than &quot;Parliament &quot;is&quot; at a standstill&quot;. Because headlines are generally simple, in &quot;A is B&quot; statements, an explicit copula is rarely necessary.

Zero copulae are very common in sports announcing. For example: &quot;Johnson already with two hits today.&quot; &quot;Unitas with a lot of time.&quot;

The zero copula is far more common in some varieties of Caribbean creoles and African American Vernacular English, where phrases like &quot;Where you at?&quot; and &quot;Who she?&quot; can occur. As in Russian and Arabic, where the copula can only be omitted in the present tense, the copula can only be omitted in African American Vernacular English when it can be contracted in Standard American English.

==In other languages==
Omission frequently depends on the tense and use of the copula.

===Bengali===
In Bengali zero copula is usually used in the present tense with a prepositional phrase or the adverb &#x27;here&#x27; or &#x27;there&#x27;. For example, in the sentence, আমরা এখানে (Aamra ekhane, &quot;We are here&quot;), the copula আছি (Aachhi) is omitted.

===Russian===
In Russian the copula () is normally omitted in the present tense, but not in the past and future tenses:

Present (omitted):
* (, literally &quot;She at home&quot;), i.e., &quot;She is now at home, in the house&quot;
Past (used):
* (, &quot;She was at home&quot;)

The third person plural (, &quot;are&quot;) is still used in some standard phrases, but since it is a homonym of the noun &quot;essence&quot;, most native speakers do not notice it to be a verb:
* (, &quot;they are one and the same&quot;).

The verb () is the infinitive of &quot;to be&quot;. The third person singular, (), means &quot;is&quot;. As a copula, it can be inflected into the past (, ), &quot;future&quot; (, ), and conditional (, ) forms. A present tense (, ) exists; however, it is almost never used as a copula, but rather omitted altogether or replaced by the verb (, &quot;to be in essence&quot;). Thus one can say:
* (, &quot;she was a beautiful woman&quot;)—predicate noun in instrumental case.
* (, &quot;she is a beautiful woman&quot;)—predicate noun in the nominative case.
* (, &quot;she is a beautiful woman&quot;)—predicate noun also in instrumental.

But not usually:
* (, &quot;she is a beautiful woman&quot;), which would be very formal and would suggest something more than a copula, something more existential than the normal English use of &quot;is&quot;. As a result, this construction is quite rare.

But in some cases the verb in the present tense (form ) is employed: (Be who you are).

The present tense of the copula in Russian was in common use well into the 19th century (as attested in the works of Fyodor Dostoyevsky) but is now used only for archaic effect (analogous to &quot;thou art&quot; in English).

===Turkic languages===

There is a contrast between the regular verb &quot;to be&quot; () and the copulative/auxiliary verb &quot;to be&quot; () in Turkish.

The auxiliary verb shows its existence only through suffixes to predicates that can be nouns, adjectives or arguably conjugated verb stems, arguably being the only irregular verb in Turkish. In the third person, zero copula is the rule, as in Hungarian or Russian. For example:

The &quot;essential&quot; copula is possible in the third person singular:

In Tatar, expresses doubt rather than a characteristic. The origin of is the verb , with a similar meaning to the Latin .

In the modern Tatar language copula is a disappearing grammatical phenomenon and is only rarely used with the first and second person (while the third person copula has fallen completely out of use). In the past there was a full paradigm for all persons:

For example: (, &quot;I&#x27;m a teacher&quot;), (, &quot;You&#x27;re a teacher&quot;), (, &quot;He/She&#x27;s a teacher&quot;). While the copulas for the first and second person are historically derived from personal pronouns, the third person copula comes from the verb (, &quot;stand, live, exist&quot;). For negation the copula affix is attached to the negative particle (): (, &quot;I&#x27;m not a writer&quot;). The copula is only used with nouns. Sometimes the noun can be in the locative case: (, &quot;You are at home&quot;).

===Japanese===
In Japanese, the copula is not used with predicative adjectives, such as . It is sometimes omitted with predicative nouns and adjectival nouns in non-past tense, such as , but is necessary for marking past tense or negation, as in . It is also sometimes omitted in wh-questions, such as .

===Māori===
In Māori, the zero copula can be used in predicative expressions and with continuous verbs (many of which take a copulative verb in many Indo-European languages) — , literally &quot;a big the house&quot;, &quot;the house (is) big&quot;; , literally &quot;at (past locative particle) the table the book&quot;, &quot;the book (was) on the table&quot;; , literally &quot;from England (s)he&quot;, &quot;(s)he (is) from England&quot;; , literally &quot;at the (act of) eating I&quot;, &quot;I (am) eating&quot;

===Arabic===
In Arabic, a Semitic language, the use of the zero copula again depends on the context. In the present tense affirmative, when the subject is definite and the predicate is indefinite, the subject is simply juxtaposed with its predicate. When both the subject and the predicate are definite, a pronoun (agreeing with the subject) may be inserted between the two. For example:
* (), &quot;Muhammad is an engineer&quot; (lit. &quot;Muhammad an-engineer&quot;)
* (), &quot;Muhammad is the engineer&#x27; (lit. &quot;Muhammad he the-engineer&quot;)

The extra pronoun is highly recommended in order for one not to confuse the predicate for a qualifying adjective:
* (), &quot;Muhammad the engineer&#x27;
(This is just a noun phrase with no copula. See &quot;al-&quot; for more on the use of definite and indefinite nouns in Arabic and how it affects the copula.)

In the past tense, however, or in the present tense negative, the verbs and are used, which take the accusative case:
* (), &quot;Muhammad was an engineer&#x27; ( = &quot;(he) was&quot;) (literally &quot;be it Muhammad an-engineer&quot;)
* (), &quot;Muhammad is not an engineer&#x27; (lit. &quot;Muhammad is not an-engineer&quot;)

When the copula is expressed with a verb, no pronoun need be inserted, regardless of the definiteness of the predicate:
* (), &quot;Muhammad is not the engineer&#x27; (lit. &quot;Muhammad is not of the-engineer&quot;)

Hebrew, another Semitic language, uses zero copula in a very similar way.

===Ganda===
The Ganda verb &quot;to be&quot;, , is used in only two cases: when the predicate is a prepositional phrase and when the subject is a pronoun and the predicate is an adjective:
*, &quot;She is beautiful&#x27; (, &quot;(he/she) is&quot;)
*, &quot;Kintu is in the car&quot; (literally &quot;Kintu he-is in-car&quot;)

Otherwise, the zero copula is used:
*, &quot;The girl is beautiful&quot; (literally &quot;the-girl beautiful&quot;)
Here the word , &quot;beautiful&quot; is missing its initial vowel pre-prefix . If included, it would make the adjective qualify the noun attributively:
*, &quot;The beautiful girl&#x27; or &quot;a beautiful girl&quot;.

===American Sign Language===
American Sign Language does not have a copula. For example, &quot;my hair is wet&quot; is signed &quot;my hair wet&quot;, and &quot;my name is Pete&quot; may be signed &quot;[MY NAME]topic P-E-T-E&quot;.

===Irish===
The copula is used in Irish but may be omitted in the present tense. For example, (&quot;He is a big man&quot;) can be expressed as simply . The common phrase (meaning &quot;anyhow&quot;, lit. &quot;Whatever story it [is]&quot;) also omits the copula.

===Welsh===

The fact that Welsh often requires the use of a predicative particle to denote non-definite predicates means that the copula can be omitted in certain phrases. For example, the phrase (&quot;Since he is/was/etc. a short man...&quot;) literally translates as &quot;And he [particle] a short man...&quot;. The zero copula is especially common in Welsh poetry of the style.

===Amerindian languages===
Nahuatl, as well as some other Amerindian languages, has no copula. Instead of using a copula, it is possible to conjugate nouns or adjectives like verbs.

Grammarians and other comparative linguists, however, &quot;do not&quot; consider this to constitute a zero copula but rather an affixal copula. Affixal copulae are not unique to Amerindian languages but can be found, for instance, in Korean and in the Eskimo languages.

Many indigenous languages of South America do, however, have true zero copulae in which no overt free &quot;or&quot; bound morpheme is present when one noun is equated with another. In fact, zero-copula is likely to occur in third-person contexts in Southern Quechua (notice &quot;wasiqa hatunmi&quot; &#x27;the house is big&#x27; vs. &quot;wasiqa hatunmi kan&quot; &#x27;the house is big&#x27;, where &quot;kan&quot;, the Quechua copula, is not really needed, as suggested by the first sentence).

Yaghan, from Tierra del Fuego, used, in its heyday back in the mid-19th century, zero copula as one option, when introducing new participants in discourse, but had a slew of posture-based copular verbs for all other contexts. So I could say, kvnji-u:a Jon (lit. &#x27;this man IS John&#x27;(zero copula). kvnji &#x27;this&#x27;, u:a &#x27;man&#x27; (v here is schwa, and colon marks tenseness of the vowel preceding it), but once John has been introduced I might say, Jon lvpatvx-wvshta:gu:a mu:ta &#x27;John is a woodworker&#x27;, lvpatvx &#x27;wood&#x27; (x voiceless velar fricative), wvshta:gu: &#x27;work&#x27; u:a &#x27;man&#x27;, mu:ta irregular present tense form of mu:tu: &#x27;to be (sitting) (or occupied doing)&#x27;

=== Chinese ===
Modern Standard Chinese, as well as many other Chinese dialects, uses a copula, such as the Mandarin word &quot;shì&quot; (是), before nouns in predications, like in &quot;Wŏ shì Zhōngguó rén&quot; (我是中国人 / I am Chinese), but not usually before verbs or adjectives. For example, saying &quot;Wǒ shì kāixīn&quot; (我是开心 / I am happy) is a grammatically incorrect sentence, but saying &quot;Wǒ kāixīn&quot; (我开心 / I happy), is correct. Adverbs can be added to the adjective, like in &quot;Wǒ hĕn kāixīn&quot; (我很开心 / I very happy). A copula may be used for adjectives, however, if the particle &quot;de&quot; (的) is added after the adjective, like in &quot;Wǒ shì kāixīn de&quot; (我是开心的).

===Vietnamese===
Somewhat similar to Chinese, the Vietnamese language requires the copula before nouns in predications but does not use a copula before verbs or adjectives, thus (I am a student) but (I [am] smart). The topic marker may appear before an adjective to emphasize the subject, for example (As for me, I am smart). Many prepositions in Vietnamese originated as verbs and continue to function as verbs in sentences that would use a copula in English. For example, in (I am at home), the word may be analyzed as either &quot;to be at&quot; or simply &quot;at&quot;. Sometimes, attributive adjectives may follow the verb &quot;có&quot; (to have), thus &quot;Tôi (có) cao&quot; is a feasible sentence.

<text>Chant is a lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon, behind the southwest limb as seen from the Earth. It lies within the southwestern part of the blanket of ejecta surrounding the Mare Orientale, beyond the Montes Cordillera mountain ring. To the west-northwest is the large walled plain Blackett. Southward is the crater Mendel.

This is a nearly circular crater with a slight outward bulge in the northeast wall. The outer rim is sharp-edged, and the inner sides slope directly downward with only some minor s along the east wall. The interior floor is somewhat irregular, particularly in the southern half. There is a small central peak at the midpoint of the floor.

The name Chant was officially adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1970 and named for Clarence Chant.

This crater lies to the northwest of the Mendel-Rydberg Basin, a 630 km wide impact basin of Nectarian age.

<text>Apulon (or &quot;Apoulon&quot;) was a Dacian fortress city close to modern Alba Iulia, Romania. The Latin name of Apulum is derived. The exact location is believed by many archaeologists to be the Dacian fortifications on top of &quot;Piatra Craivii&quot;, Craiva, Cricău, about 20 km north of Alba-Iulia.

Apulon was an important Dacian political, economic and social center, the capital of the Apuli tribe. It was first mentioned by the Ancient Greek geographer Ptolemy in his Geographia, under the name Apulon. It is also depicted in the &quot;Tabula Peutingeriana&quot; as an important city named Apula, at the cross road of two main routes: one coming from Blandiana, the other from Acidava. The two roads merge at Apula, with the next stop on the route being Brucla.

After the southern part of Dacia became a province of the Roman Empire, the capital of the Dacia Apulensis district was established here, and the city was known as [[Alba Iulia#History|Apulum]]. Apulum was one of the largest centers in Roman Dacia and the seat of the XIII Gemina Legion. The castra at Apulum is the largest in Romania, occupying 37,5 ha (750 x 500 m2).

<doc id="1337121" wikidata="Q619659" url="?curid=1337121" title="Bert Mooney Airport">
<text>Bert Mooney Airport is a public airport three miles southeast of Butte, in Silver Bow County, Montana, United States. It is owned by the Bert Mooney Airport Authority.

The airport name was changed in 1972 to honor Bert Mooney, an aviator from Butte who was the first to fly mail into Yellowstone National Park in 1935. Prior to this the airport was Butte Municipal Airport (from its opening in 1926) and Silver Bow County Airport from 1960 to 1972.

The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized it as a &quot;primary commercial service&quot; facility (more than 10,000 enplanements per year). Montana Department of Transportation records say the airport had 32,501 passenger boardings (enplanements) in 2023.

==Facilities==
Bert Mooney Airport covers 890 acres (360 ha) at an elevation of 5,551 feet (1,692 m). It has two asphalt runways: 15/33 is 9,000 by 150 feet (2,743 x 46 m) and 11/29 is 5,100 by 75 feet.

In 2022 the airport had 23,861 aircraft operations, average 65 per day: 87% general aviation, 8% air taxi, 3% commercial service and 3% military. 42 aircraft were then based at this airport: 30 single-engine, 9 multi-engine, and 3 helicopter.

==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger Service===


Bert Mooney gained a second destination airport, Denver International Airport, in 2022. The service to Denver was suspended shortly afterwards due to a pilot shortage. Service to Denver will resume in 2025.

==Accidents==
On November 7, 1950, a Northwest Orient Airlines plane carrying 21 people crashed into the East Ridge of Butte during a blizzard. All on board were killed.

On March 22, 2009, a Pilatus PC-12 flying in from Oroville, California, crashed in Holy Cross Cemetery 500 feet from the airport, killing all 14 passengers and crew on board.

<doc id="1337122" wikidata="Q2517077" url="?curid=1337122" title="Chebyshev (crater)">
<text>Chebyshev is a large lunar impact crater that lies in the southern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. The somewhat smaller crater Langmuir is intruding into the east-southeastern rim of Chebyshev, forming a chain of large craters with Brouwer on Langmuir&#x27;s eastern rim.

The outer rim of this walled plain is eroded and somewhat irregular, although much of the perimeter can still be discerned. The outer of Langmuir spills into the interior, forming a rough patch in the southeastern floor. Several craters lie along the western rim, most notably Chebyshev U. The rim of this last crater is sharp-edged but somewhat irregular due to some slight outward bulges. The northern rim of Chebyshev has a wide notch extending outward about 30–40 kilometres in a V-shape. There are some other minor craters along the northeast rim, and the southern rim is a disorganized jumble.

The interior floor of Chebyshev is a mixture of relatively level plains and irregular stretches. A short chain of small craters has formed a gouge from the western inner wall reaching almost to the midpoint. There are several streaky clefts in the floor in the northeastern part of the crater. In the south is the bowl-shaped satellite crater Chebyshev N, a nearly symmetrical formation except for a slight outward bulge to the southwest. There is also an irregular crater along the inner wall to the west-southwest.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Chebyshev.

<text>Ethel Lilian Voynich ( Boole; 11 May 1864 – 27 July 1960) was an Irish-born novelist and musician, and a supporter of several revolutionary causes. She was born in Cork, but grew up in Lancashire, England.

Voynich was a significant figure, not only on the late Victorian literary scene, but also in Russian émigré circles. She is best known for her novel &quot;The Gadfly&quot;, which became hugely popular in her lifetime, especially in the Soviet Union.

==Life==
Ethel Lilian Boole was born on 11 May 1864, at Lichfield Cottage, Blackrock, Ballintemple, Cork, the youngest daughter of English parents, mathematician George Boole (inventor of Boolean logic), and mathematician and educationalist Mary Everest, who was the niece of George Everest and a writer for &quot;Crank&quot;, an early-20th-century periodical. Her father died six months after she was born. Her mother returned to her native England with her daughters, and was able to live off a small government pension until she was appointed librarian at Queen&#x27;s College, London. When she was eight, Ethel contracted erysipelas, a disease associated with poor sanitation. Her mother decided to send her to live in Lancashire with her brother, who was manager of a coal mine, believing that it would be good for her health. Described as &quot;a religious fanatic and sadist&quot;, who regularly beat his children, he apparently forced Ethel to play the piano for hours on end. Ethel returned to London at the age of ten. She became withdrawn, dressing in black and calling herself &quot;Lily&quot;.

At the age of eighteen, she gained access to a legacy. This allowed her to study piano and musical composition at the Hochschule für Musik in Berlin, which she attended between 1882 and 1885. During this period, she became increasingly attracted to revolutionary politics. Back in London she learned Russian from Sergei Kravchinski, known as Stepniak, who encouraged her to go to Russia. From 1887 to 1889, she worked as a governess in St. Petersburg, where she stayed with Kravchinski&#x27;s sister-in-law, Preskovia Karauloff. Through her, she became associated with the revolutionary Narodniks. After her return to the UK, she settled in London, where she became involved in pro-Revolutionary activity. With Kravchinski she founded the Society of Friends of Russian Freedom, and helped to edit &quot;Free Russia&quot;, the Narodniks&#x27;s English-language journal.

In 1890, she met Michał Habdank-Wojnicz, a Polish revolutionary who had escaped from Siberia. Soon he also became Ethel Boole&#x27;s life-partner. By 1895, they were living together and she was calling herself Mrs. Voynich. They married in 1902. In 1904, he anglicised his name to Wilfrid Michael Voynich and became an antiquarian book dealer. In that capacity he eventually gave his name to the Voynich manuscript.

In 1897, Ethel Voynich published &quot;The Gadfly&quot;, which was an immediate international success. She published three more novels, &quot;Jack Raymond&quot; (1901), &quot;Olive Latham&quot; (1904) and &quot;An Interrupted Friendship&quot; (1910), but none attained the popularity of her first book.

The Voyniches emigrated to the United States in 1920, after Wilfred had moved the bulk of his book business to New York. Ethel concentrated more on music from this point on, working in a music school, but she continued her literary career as a translator from Russian, Polish and French. A final novel, &quot;Put Off Thy Shoes&quot;, was published in 1945.

Voynich was unaware of the vast sales of &quot;The Gadfly&quot; in the Soviet Union until she was visited in New York by a Russian diplomat in 1955, who told her how highly regarded she was in the country. The following year, Adlai Stevenson secured an agreement for the payment of in royalties to her.

Ethel Lilian Voynich died on 27 July 1960 at the age of 96. In accordance with her will, her body was cremated and the ashes scattered over Central Park in New York City.

===Alleged affair with Reilly===
According to the British journalist Robin Bruce Lockhart, Sidney Reilly – a Russian-born operative employed by the émigré intelligence network of Scotland Yard&#x27;s Special Branch – met Ethel Voynich in London in 1895. Lockhart, whose father, R. H. Bruce Lockhart, knew Reilly, claims that Reilly and Voynich had a sexual liaison and voyaged to Italy together. During their romance Reilly is said to have bared his soul and revealed to her the story of his espionage activities. After their brief affair, Voynich published &quot;The Gadfly&quot;, whose central character Arthur Burton was based on Reilly. In 2004, writer Andrew Cook suggested that Reilly may have been reporting on Voynich and her political activities to William Melville of the Metropolitan Police Special Branch. In 2016, new evidence surfaced from archived communication between Anne Fremantle, who attempted a biography of Ethel Voynich, and a relative of Ethel&#x27;s on the Hinton side. The evidence indicates that a liaison of some sort took place between Reilly and her in Florence in 1895.

==Work==

===&quot;The Gadfly&quot;===
She is most famous for her first novel &quot;The Gadfly&quot;, first published in 1897 in the United States (June) and Britain (September), about the struggles of an international revolutionary in Italy who was loosely based on the figure of Giuseppe Mazzini. This novel was very popular in the Soviet Union and was the top bestseller and compulsory reading there, where it was seen as ideologically useful; for similar reasons, the novel has been popular in the People&#x27;s Republic of China as well. By the time of Voynich&#x27;s death &quot;The Gadfly&quot; had sold an estimated 2,500,000 copies in the Soviet Union and had been made into two Russian movies, first in 1928 in Soviet Georgia (&quot;Krazana&quot;) and then again in 1955.

Historian Mark Mazower describes &quot;The Gadfly&quot; as ‘a radical fin de siècle English novel’ translated into Yiddish by his grandfather, Max Mazower, being published in 1907 in Vilna, then part of the Russian Empire, now Vilnius, Lithuania. Its dramatic story serves as an allegory for the struggle for liberty in Russia. Not only did it circulate widely among socialists in Russia, it appealed enormously to people of progressive ideas elsewhere with soaring popularity in Britain towards the end of the First World War. Sidney Reilly, the famous British “Ace of Spies” is said to have either modelled himself on or served as a model for Voynich&#x27;s hero. Reilly, in turn, was used by Ian Fleming as a model for James Bond, the most famous fictional spy of the Cold War.

The 1955 film of the novel, by the Soviet director Aleksandr Fajntsimmer is noted for the fact that composer Dmitri Shostakovich wrote the score (see &quot;The Gadfly Suite&quot;). Along with some other excerpts, the &quot;Romance&quot; movement has since become very popular. Shostakovich&#x27;s &quot;Gadfly&quot; theme was also used in the 1980s, in the ITV TV series &quot;Reilly, Ace of Spies&quot;. In 1980 the novel was adapted again as a TV miniseries &quot;The Gadfly&quot;, featuring Sergei Bondarchuk as Father Montanelli. Various other adaptations exist, including at least three operas and two ballets.

===Other novels===
Voynich&#x27;s other four novels never achieved the same success as &quot;The Gadfly&quot;, but two of them extended its narrative. &quot;An Interrupted Friendship&quot; (1910) elaborates on &quot;The Gadfly&quot;&#x27;s protagonist&#x27;s backstory, and &quot;Put Off Thy Shoes&quot; (1945), Voynich&#x27;s last novel, further focuses on the life of the protagonist&#x27;s family and ancestors; a &quot;lengthy, multi-generational chronicle&quot; set in the 18th century.

Her second novel, &quot;Jack Raymond&quot; (1901), was quickly followed by her third, &quot;Olive Latham&quot; (1904)&quot;.&quot; Nearly a decade later, Voynich took a hiatus from writing and focused on music.

===Music===
Voynich began composing music around 1910. She joined the Society of Women Musicians during World War I. After she and her husband moved to New York, she devoted herself much more to music, creating many adaptations and transcriptions of existing works. In 1931 she published an edited volume of Chopin&#x27;s letters. 

From 1933 to 1943 she worked at the Pius X School of Liturgical Music in Manhattan. While there she composed a number of cantatas and other works that were performed at the college, including &quot;Babylon&quot;, &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, &quot;Epitaph in Ballad Form&quot; and &quot;The Submerged City&quot;. She also researched the history of music, compiling detailed commentaries on music of various eras. 

Most of her music remains unpublished and is held at the Library of Congress. Recent evaluation in 2005 of the cantata &quot;Babylon&quot; by an eminent English composer was not very favourable. &#x27;The general impression is of amateurism and gaucheness&#x27;.

==Legacy==
A minor planet called 2032 Ethel that was discovered in 1970 by Soviet astronomer Tamara Mikhailovna Smirnova is named after her.

<doc id="1337135" wikidata="Q1118604" url="?curid=1337135" title="Cori (lunar crater)">
<text>Cori is a lunar impact crater that is located in the southern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. It lies less than one crater diameter to the north of the crater Baldet. To the northeast is the crater Grissom. 

The crater was named in 1979 by the IAU after Gerty Cori, the first American woman to win the Nobel Prize and the first woman to win the prize in the category Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

This is a circular crater formation with a somewhat eroded outer rim. The inner wall has a shelf running around the western perimeter where the material has slumped somewhat from the edge. There is a small outward break in the northern wall, and a small crater lies against the eastern inner wall. The interior floor is marked by a few tiny craterlets, but no ridges or irregularities of note.

To the west of Cori are two unnamed craters with fractured floors.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Cori.

<doc id="1337147" wikidata="Q892302" url="?curid=1337147" title="Bone bed">
<text>A bone bed is any geological stratum or deposit that contains bones of whatever kind. Inevitably, such deposits are sedimentary in nature. Not a formal term, it tends to be used more to describe especially dense collections such as Lagerstätte. It is also applied to brecciated and stalagmitic deposits on the floor of caves, which frequently contain osseous remains.

In a more restricted sense, the term is used to describe certain thin layers of bony fragments, which occur in well-defined geological strata. One of the best-known of these is the Ludlow Bone Bed, which is found at the base of the Downton Sandstone in the Upper Ludlow series. At Ludlow (England) itself, two such beds are actually known, separated by about . of strata. Although quite thin, the Ludlow Bone Bed can be followed from that town into Gloucestershire, for a distance of . It is almost completely made up of fragments of spines, teeth and scales of ganoid fish. Another well-known bed, formerly known as the Bristol or Lias Bone Bed, exists in the form of several thin layers of micaceous sandstone, with the remains of fish and saurians, which occur in the Rhaetic Black Paper Shales that lie above the Keuper marls, in the south-west of England. A similar bone bed has been traced on the same geological horizon in Brunswick, Hanover (Germany), in Franconia and in Tübingen (Germany). A bone bed has also been observed at the base of the Carboniferous limestone series, in certain parts of the south-west of England.

Bone beds are also recorded in North America, South America, Mongolia and China. Terrestrial bonebed examples are: the Triassic &quot;Metoposaurus&quot; bone bed from Portugal, the &quot;Mapusaurus&quot; bone bed at Cañadón del Gato, in Argentina, the &quot;Allosaurus&quot;-dominated Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry of Utah, the Dinosaur National Monument on the boundary of Utah and Colorado, an &quot;Albertosaurus&quot; bonebed from Alberta, a &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot; bone bed from Montana, the Cenozoic John Day Fossil Beds of Oregon, a &quot;Triceratops&quot; bonebed from Montana, a &quot;Centrosaurus&quot; bonebed in Alberta, a &quot;Styracosaurus&quot; bone bed in Alberta, an &quot;Edmontosaurus annectens&quot; bone bed in Wyoming, an &quot;Edmontosaurus regalis&quot; bone bed in Alberta, a &quot;Gryposaurus&quot; bone bed in the Oldman Formation, a &quot;Pachyrhinosaurus&quot; bone bed in the Wapiti Formation, and the Nemegt Basin in the Gobi Desert region of Mongolia, specifically the &quot;Saurolophus&quot; bone bed known as the Dragon&#x27;s Tomb. Bentiaba, Angola, is an example of a marine bonebed with numerous mosasaurs and plesiosaurs. Another example of a marine bonebed is the Sharktooth Hill Bonebed located in the Temblor Formation in California.

Fossil bonebeds don&#x27;t always consist of one single species, but rather many species of organisms. There are several of the bonebeds known throughout North America. Two of the best examples include the Mixson&#x27;s Bone Bed of Florida, whose geological settings preserved the remains of &quot;Ambelodon&quot;, &quot;Aepycamelus&quot;, and &quot;Cormohipparion&quot;, and the Agate Fossil Beds in Nebraska which has the fossils of abundant creatures such as &quot;Menoceras&quot;, &quot;Stenomylus&quot;, and &quot;Daphoenodon&quot;.

<doc id="1337152" wikidata="Q1157015" url="?curid=1337152" title="Zoo hypothesis">
<text>The zoo hypothesis speculates on the assumed behavior and existence of technologically advanced extraterrestrial life and the reasons they refrain from contacting Earth. It is one of many theoretical explanations for the Fermi paradox. The hypothesis states that extraterrestrial life intentionally avoids communication with Earth to allow for natural evolution and sociocultural development, and avoiding interplanetary contamination, similar to people observing animals at a zoo. The hypothesis seeks to explain the apparent absence of extraterrestrial life despite its generally accepted plausibility and hence the reasonable expectation of its existence.

Extraterrestrial life forms might, for example, choose to allow contact once the human species has passed certain technological, political, and/or ethical standards. Alternatively, they may withhold contact until humans force contact upon them, possibly by sending a spacecraft to an extraterrestrial-inhabited planet. In this regard, reluctance to initiate contact could reflect a sensible desire to minimize risk. An extraterrestrial society with advanced remote-sensing technologies may conclude that direct contact with neighbors confers added risks to itself without an added benefit. A variant on the zoo hypothesis suggested by former MIT Haystack Observatory scientist John Allen Ball is the &quot;laboratory&quot; hypothesis, in which humanity is being subjected to experiments, with Earth serving as a giant laboratory. Ball describes this hypothesis as &quot;morbid&quot; and &quot;grotesque&quot;, simultaneously overlooking the possibility that such experiments may be altruistic, i.e., designed to accelerate the pace of civilization to overcome a tendency for intelligent life to destroy itself, until a species is sufficiently developed to establish contact.

==Assumptions==
The zoo hypothesis assumes, first, that whenever the conditions are such that life can exist and evolve, it will, and secondly, there are many places where life can exist and a large number of extraterrestrial cultures in existence. It also assumes that these extraterrestrials have great reverence for independent, natural evolution and development. In particular, assuming that intelligence is a physical process that acts to maximize the diversity of a system&#x27;s accessible futures, a fundamental motivation for the zoo hypothesis would be that premature contact would &quot;unintelligently&quot; reduce the overall diversity of paths the universe itself could take.

These ideas are perhaps most plausible if there is a relatively universal cultural or legal policy among a plurality of extraterrestrial civilizations necessitating isolation with respect to civilizations at Earth-like stages of development. In a universe without a hegemonic power, random single civilizations with independent principles would make contact. This makes a crowded universe with clearly defined rules seem more plausible.

If there is a plurality of extraterrestrial cultures, however, this theory may break down under the uniformity of motive concept because it would take just a single extraterrestrial civilization, or simply a small group within any given civilisation, to decide to act contrary to the imperative within human range of detection for it to be undone, and the probability of such a violation of hegemony increases with the number of civilizations. This idea, however, becomes more plausible if all civilizations tend to evolve similar cultural standards and values with regard to contact much like convergent evolution on Earth has independently evolved eyes on numerous occasions, or all civilizations follow the lead of some particularly distinguished civilization, such as the first civilization among them.

In this hypothesis, the problem of universal ethical homogeneity is solved because the acquisition of a persistent advanced level of civilization requires overcoming many problems, such as self-destruction, war, overpopulation, pollution, and scarcity. Managing to solve these problems could guide a civilization to adopt a responsible and wise behavior, otherwise they would disappear (involving other solutions to the Fermi paradox). In the zoo hypothesis, no contact would be possible until humanity had acquired a certain level of civilization and maturity (responsibility and wisdom), otherwise it would become a potential threat.

One estimate for when humanity might be able to test the zoo hypothesis, essentially by eliminating ways technological extraterrestrials within the Galaxy may be able to hide, is some time within the next half century.

==Fermi paradox==
A modified zoo hypothesis is a possible solution to the Fermi paradox. The time between the emergence of the first civilization within the Milky Way and all subsequent civilizations could be enormous. Monte Carlo simulation shows the first few inter-arrival times between emergent civilizations would be similar in length to geologic epochs on Earth. The zoo hypothesis assumes a civilization may have a ten-million, one-hundred-million, or half-billion-year head start on humanity, i.e., it may have the capability to completely negate our best attempts to detect it.

The zoo hypothesis relies in part on applying the concept of hegemonic power to the Fermi paradox. Even if a first hegemonic non-interventionist grand civilization (first civilization) is long gone, their initial legacy could persist in the form of a passed-down tradition, or perhaps in an artificial lifeform (artificial superintelligence) dedicated to a non-interventionist hegemonic goal without the risk of death. Thus, the hegemonic power does not even have to be the first civilization, but simply the first to spread its non-interventionist doctrine and control over a large volume of the galaxy. If just one civilization acquired hegemony in the distant past, it could form an unbroken chain of taboo against rapacious colonization in favour of non-interference in any civilizations that follow. The uniformity of motive concept previously mentioned would become moot in such a situation. The main problem would be how a galaxy-wide civilization would block Earth from receiving all intentional or unintentional communications.

Nonetheless, if the oldest civilization still present in the Milky Way has, for example, a 100-million-year time advantage over the next oldest civilization, then it is conceivable that they could be in the singular position of being able to control, monitor, influence or isolate the emergence of every civilization that follows within their sphere of influence. This is analogous to what happens on Earth within our own civilization on a daily basis, in that everyone born on this planet is born into a pre-existing system of familial associations, customs, traditions and laws that were already long established before our birth and which we have little or no control over.

== METI (Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence) ==
Overcoming the zoo hypothesis is one of the goals of METI, an organization created in 2015 to communicate with extraterrestrials, an active form of the search for extraterrestrials (SETI). METI, however, has been criticized for not representing humanity&#x27;s collective will and for potentially endangering humanity.

==Criticism==
Some critics of the hypothesis say that only a single dissident group in an extraterrestrial civilization, or alternatively the existence of galactic cliques instead of a unified galactic club, would be enough to break the pact of no contact. To Stephen Webb and others, it seems unlikely, taking humans and human intercivilizational politics as reference, that such prohibition would be in effect for millions of years or at least human existence without a single breach thereof. Others say that the zoo hypothesis, along with its planetarium variation, is highly speculative and more aligned with theological theories. One possible counterargument to the dissident (rogue) group argument is that extraterrestrial artificial superintelligences dominate space, including space occupied by biological intelligences; moreoever, separate artificial superintelligences are assumed to tend towards a network of merged superintelligencies, thereby dissuading rogue behaviour.

==Appearance in fiction==
The zoo hypothesis is a common theme in science fiction.

===1930s===
* 1937: In Olaf Stapledon&#x27;s 1937 novel &quot;Star Maker&quot;, great care is taken by the Symbiont race to keep its existence hidden from &quot;pre-utopian&quot; primitives, &quot;lest they should lose their independence of mind.” It is only when such worlds become utopian-level space travellers that the Symbionts make contact and bring the young utopia to an equal footing.

===1950s===
* 1951: Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s &quot;The Sentinel&quot; (first published in 1951) and its later novel adaptation &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968) feature a beacon which is activated when the human race discovers it on the moon.
* 1953: In &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot;, a novel by Arthur C. Clarke published in 1953, the alien cultures had been observing and registering Earth&#x27;s evolution and human history for thousands (perhaps millions) of years. At the beginning of the book, when mankind is about to achieve spaceflight, the aliens reveal their existence and quickly end the arms race, colonialism, racial segregation and the Cold War.

===1960s===
* In &quot;Star Trek&quot;, the Federation (including humans) has a strict Prime Directive policy of nonintervention with less technologically advanced cultures which the Federation encounters. The threshold of inclusion is the independent technological development of faster-than-light propulsion. In the show&#x27;s canon, the Vulcan race limited their encounters to observation until Humans made their first warp flight, after which they initiated first contact, indicating the practice predated the Human race&#x27;s advance of this threshold. Additionally, in the episode &quot;The Chase (TNG)&quot;, a message from a first (or early) civilization is discovered, hidden in the DNA of sentient species spread across many worlds, something that could only have been fully discovered after a race had become sufficiently advanced.
* In &quot;Hard to Be a God&quot; by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, the (unnamed) medieval-esque planet where the novel takes action is protected by the advanced civilization of Earth, and the observers from Earth present on the planet are forbidden to intervene and make overt contact. One of the major themes of the novel is the ethical dilemma presented by such a stance to the observers.

===1980s===
* 1986: In &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; by Orson Scott Card, the human xenobiologists and xenologers, biologists and anthropologists observing alien life are forbidden from giving the native species, the Pequeninos, any technology or information. When one of the xenobiologists is killed in an alien ceremony, they are forbidden to mention it. This happens again until Ender Wiggin, the main character of &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;, explains to the Pequeninos that humans cannot partake in the ceremony because it kills them. While this is not exactly an example of the zoo hypothesis, since humanity makes contact, it is very similar and the humans seek to keep the Pequeninos ignorant of technology.
* 1987: In Julian May&#x27;s 1987 novel &quot;Intervention&quot;, the five alien races of the Galactic Milieu keep Earth under surveillance, but do not intervene until humans demonstrate mental and ethical maturity through a paranormal prayer of peace.
* 1989: Iain M. Banks&#x27; &quot;The State of the Art&quot; depicts the Culture secretly visiting Earth and then deciding to leave it uncontacted, watching its development as a control group, to confirm whether their manipulations of other civilizations are ultimately for the best (the laboratory hypothesis). Other works by Banks depict the Culture (or a Culture equivalent) routinely manipulating less advanced civilizations, including pre-industrial ones (e.g., &quot;Inversions&quot;), both covertly and overtly, for philosophical or foreign policy purposes.
* 1989: Bill Watterson&#x27;s &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; comic strip for 8 November 1989 alludes to the possibility of an ethical threshold for first contact (or at least for the prudence of first contact) in Calvin&#x27;s remark &quot;Sometimes I think the surest sign that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe is that none of it has tried to contact us.&quot;

===2000s===
* 2000: In Robert J. Sawyer&#x27;s SF novel &quot;Calculating God&quot; (2000), Hollus, a scientist from an advanced alien civilization, denies that her government is operating under the prime directive.
* 2003: In &quot;South Park&quot; inaugural episode of season seven, &quot;Cancelled&quot;, aliens refrain from contacting Earth because the planet is the subject and setting of a reality television show. Unlike most variations of the zoo hypothesis where contact is not initiated in order to allow organic socioeconomic, cultural, and technological development, the aliens in this episode refrain from contact for the sole purpose of entertainment. In essence, the aliens treat all of Earth like the titular character in &quot;The Truman Show&quot; in order to maintain the show&#x27;s integrity.
* 2008: In the video game &quot;Spore&quot;, which simulates the evolution and life of species on a fictional galaxy, intelligent species in the &quot;Space Stage&quot; cannot contact those in previous stages, which did not unify their planets, nor develop spaceflight yet. However, they are allowed to abduct their citizens/members, to create crop circles in their terrain and to place in their planets a tool called &quot;monolith&quot;, which accelerates their technological evolution.

=== 2010s ===

* 2012: In the sci-fi video game &quot;Star Citizen&quot;, the zoo hypothesis is vaguely referenced in a lore point and is referred to as the Fair Chance Act. In the document, humans are generally forbidden from terraforming, mining, and inhabiting planets if the world is found to harbor lifeforms capable of developing intelligence. Multiple planetary systems are planned to be implemented as the game&#x27;s active development continues that will feature planets protected under the Fair Chance Act.
* 2016: In the video game &quot;Stellaris&quot;, players control an interstellar empire that can encounter less technologically advanced, non-space faring civilizations. Depending on player choices and their empire&#x27;s organization, they can observe such &quot;pre faster-than-light&quot; planets in a manner similar to the zoo hypothesis, using science stations with missions that can include passive observation, technological enlightenment, covert infiltration and indoctrination. Players can also discover &quot;pre-sapient&quot; species, which can be uplifted to sentience using scientific research projects.

<text>Henry (Hendrik), Lord of Bréderode (December 1531 – 15 February 1568), also styled Count of Brederode, was a member of the Dutch noble family Van Brederode. He was the leader of the allied Dutch nobles, the so-called Compromise of Nobles of 1566 and the Geuzen at the beginning of the Eighty Years&#x27; War. Van Brederode was named the &quot;Grote Geus&quot; or the &quot;Big Beggar&quot;.

== Biography ==


Hendrik van Brederode was born at Brussels as son of Reinoud III van Brederode and Philippote von der Marck. He became a convert to the Reformed faith and placed himself at the side of the Prince of Orange and Count of Egmont in resisting the introduction of the Spanish Inquisition and Spanish despotism into the Netherlands. In 1566, he was one of the founders of the confederacy of nobles who bound themselves to maintain the rights and liberties of the country by signing a document known as the Compromise of Nobles.

On 5 April that year, Brederode accompanied to the palace a body of 300 knights, for whom he acted as the spokesman, to present to the regent, Margaret of Parma, a petition setting forth their grievances. It was at a banquet at the Hotel Culemburg on 8 April, presided over by Bréderode, that the sobriquet of les Gueux, or &quot;the Beggars,&quot; was first given to the opponents of Spanish rule. Bréderode, the &quot;Grote Geus&quot; or &quot;Big Beggar&quot;, was banished from the Netherlands by Alva, and died in exile shortly afterwards at the early age of thirty-six.

In March of the year 1567, backed by his friend Lenaert Jansz de Graeff, his brother Dirck Jansz Graeff and a large part of the bourgeoisie, Brederode became the &quot;Generalcaptain&quot; of the city of Amsterdam. But in the next month, Brederode and Lenaert Jansz de Graeff departed and the Spanish General Philippe de Noircarmes became the military commander of Amsterdam.

Hendrik was the descendant of an ancient family active in the affairs of war and peace, which had for some centuries been settled at Castle Brederode in Holland north-west of the village of Santpoort and after 1418 at Batestein Castle in Vianen. 
In 1557, he married Amalia of Neuenahr, daughter of Gumprecht of Neuenahr.

== In popular culture ==
Hendrick van Brederode is the main character in the 1949 novel &quot;De grote geus&quot; (&quot;The Great Geuz&quot;) written by Johan Fabricius.

The life and work of Brederode and also his friend Lenaert Jansz de Graeff served Jaap van de Wal as template and content of the historical novel &quot;De Grote Geus&quot;.

<text>Resaca is the name given to a type of oxbow lake in the southern half of Cameron County, Texas. The resacas constitute former channels of the Rio Grande and are naturally cut off from the river, having no inlet or outlet.

== History ==
The Rio Grande&#x27;s water moves from Colorado to the Gulf of Mexico. Every year during spring, melted snow would flow into the Rio Grande, bringing seasonal flood waters to the most southern tip of Texas. Given the overflow of the river&#x27;s main and distributary channel banks, the Rio Grande would carve new river channels, known as &quot;resacas.&quot; When the seasonal flooding ended and the river retreated, the newly formed oxbow lakes remained, creating &quot;resacas&quot; all throughout the Rio Grande Valley.

=== Etymology ===
There are two explanations for the origin of the word &quot;resaca.&quot; The first explanation holds that it is a contraction of the Spanish phrase &quot;rio seco&quot; (dry river). The second explanation is that the word stems from the Spanish word &quot;resacar&quot; (to retake). The latter is the most plausible explanation given that the primary geological function of a &quot;resaca&quot; is to divert and dissipate floodwater from the river.

The word resaca is a regionalism. Elsewhere, these are referred to as oxbow lakes.

<text>Because scholars have tended to use the term in different ways, Biblical theology has been notoriously difficult to define. The academic field of biblical theology is sub-divided into Old Testament theology and New Testament theology. 

==Academic field==
Mark Bowald, writing for Grace Theological Seminary, stated that &quot;four areas of focus&quot; of theology &quot;include biblical theology, historical theology, systematic (or dogmatic) theology, and practical theology&quot;.

Biblical theology is the study of the Bible&#x27;s teachings as organic developments through biblical history, as an unfolding and gradual revelation, with increasing clarity and definition in the latter books, and embryonic and inchoate in form in the earlier books of the Bible. Although most speak of biblical theology as a particular method or emphasis within biblical studies, some scholars have also used the term in reference to its distinctive content. In this understanding, biblical theology is limited to a collation and restatement of biblical data, without the logical analysis and dialectical correlation between texts that systematic theology emphasizes.

Some scholars focus on the Old Testament (OT) or Hebrew Bible and falls in the field of Old Testament theology. The field started out as a Christian endeavor and aimed to provide an objective knowledge of early revelation, working as much as possible only with these biblical texts and their historical contexts, in the twentieth century it became informed by other voices and views, including those of feminist and Jewish scholars, which provided new insights and showed ways that the early work was bound by the perspectives of their authors. Key scholars have included Walther Eichrodt, Gerhard von Rad, Phyllis Trible, Geerhardus Vos, and Jon Levenson.

Others focus on the New Testament (NT); the field of New Testament theology likewise seeks understanding from within the bounds of these documents and their historical contexts. Key scholars have included Rudolf Bultmann, Hendrikus Boers, and N. T. Wright.

===Evangelicalism===
In Evangelicalism, biblical theology is a discipline of theology which emphasises the progressive nature of biblical revelation. Graeme Goldsworthy explains the relationship between biblical theology and systematic theology as follows:

The work of Gregory Beale, Kevin Vanhoozer, Geerhardus Vos (&quot;Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments&quot;), Herman Nicolaas Ridderbos (&quot;The Coming of the Kingdom&quot;), Meredith Kline (&quot;Kingdom Prologue&quot;), Graeme Goldsworthy (&quot;According to Plan&quot;, &quot;Gospel and Kingdom&quot;), Vaughan Roberts (&quot;God&#x27;s Big Picture&quot;), James Hamilton (&quot;God&#x27;s Glory in Salvation through Judgment&quot;), and Peter Gentry and Stephen Wellum (&quot;Kingdom through Covenant: A Biblical-Theological Understanding of the Covenants&quot;) have helped popularize this approach to the Bible. Especially important for bringing this field of study into the confessional tradition was Old Princeton theologian, Geerhardus Vos (&quot;Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments&quot;). They summarize the message of the Bible as being about &quot;God&#x27;s people in God&#x27;s place under God&#x27;s rule and blessing&quot; (in Graeme Goldsworthy, &quot;Gospel and Kingdom&quot;, Paternoster, 1981).

== History ==
In the 17th century, attempts to prove that Protestant dogmatic theology was based in the Bible were described as &quot;biblical theology&quot;. These early works explained biblical texts according to standard outlines used in systematic theology. In the 1770s, Johann Salomo Semler argued that biblical theology needed to be separated from dogmatic theology.

Johann Philipp Gabler&#x27;s 1787 lecture &quot;On the Proper Distinction Between Biblical and Dogmatic Theology&quot; is considered the beginning of modern biblical theology. Gabler believed the Bible was &quot;the one clear source from which all true knowledge of the Christian religion is drawn&quot;. For Gabler, dogmatic theology must be based on a biblical theology that is &quot;pure and unmixed with foreign elements&quot;. Gabler identified two tasks for biblical theology. The first task was to provide an accurate historical description of the ideas found in the Bible. He argued that the interpretation of biblical texts needed to be informed by the language and customs of the relevant historical period. Significantly, Gabler did not assume that the Old Testament and New Testament possessed a uniformity in beliefs. Gabler&#x27;s second task was to compare biblical ideas with each other to discover universal scriptural truths on which dogmatic theology could be based. 

Taking up Gabler&#x27;s first task, George Lorenz Bauer wrote separate biblical theologies for the OT (1796) and the NT (1800–1802). This marked the beginning of OT theology and NT theology as independent disciplines. However, Gabler&#x27;s second task was forgotten. According to biblical scholar Frank Matera, &quot;Instead of becoming a servant of dogmatic theology, biblical theology soon became its rival.&quot;

=== Biblical theology movement (1940s–1960s)===
The biblical theology movement was an approach to Protestant biblical studies that was popular in the United States, particularly among Presbyterians, between the 1940s and early 1960s. Heavily influenced by Neo-orthodoxy, the movement sought to escape the polarization of liberal theology and Christian fundamentalism. Important themes included: &quot;1) The Bible as a theological resource; 2) The unity of the Bible; 3) The revelation of God in history; 4) The Bible’s distinctly Hebraic mentality; and 5) The uniqueness of biblical revelation.&quot; Scholars included G. Ernest Wright, Floyd V. Filson, Otto Piper and James D. Smart.

<doc id="1337173" wikidata="Q1187799" url="?curid=1337173" title="Olca">
<text>Olca is a stratovolcano on the border of Chile and Bolivia. It lies in the middle of a 15 km long ridge composed of several stratovolcanos. Cerro Minchincha lies to the west and Paruma to the east. It is also close to the pre-Holocene Cerro Paruma. It is andesitic and dacitic in composition, with lava flows extending several kilometres north of the peak. The only activity from the ridge during historical times was a flank eruption from 1865 to 1867. The exact source of this eruption is unclear.

== Gas emissions and composition ==
The gasses emission is comprised by a single warm spring at the base and a persistent fumarole field over at the crater&#x27;s dome for at least 60 years. The fumarolic field is about 0.1 km2 and the emissions measured in situ at the crater show a highly mixed magmatic system between high temperature gasses and hydrothermal fluids.

The gas composition indicates low concentration of H2, CO and acidic gasses, and high concentration of H2S and hydrocarbons. The carbon/sulfur ratios are high and the isotopic values suggest the mixture between magmatic, hydrothermal, and atmospheric fluids. Other techniques used to measure the amount of SO2 includes remote sensing techniques called Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy(DOAS) giving maximum concentration of 35 ppm.m of SO2; and the most recent taken with a UV camera suggesting an average of 18.4 t d−1.

== Eruptive history and latest activity ==
Different information exists regarding the activity and activity migration of Olca. There is a study dating two flows, which suggest a formation during the Pleistocene, while others suggest to be much older with the appearance of the edifices volcanic activity migrated east over time. There is also evidence that glaciers were on the volcano in the late Pleistocene. The

Unconfirmed historical eruptions are suspected to have occurred in 1865–1867. The last activity has been reported of low-intensity seismicity accompanied with fumarolic activity in November 1989 and March 1990 intense degassing. In 2010, there a campaign conducted seismic activity showing 3 potencial swarms without a clear interpretation.

<text>Dryden is a lunar impact crater located in the southern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. It lies within the huge walled plain called Apollo and is one of several features within that basin named after people associated with the Apollo program. Apollo itself has an inner ring, and Dryden is attached to the west-northwest part of that circular mountain formation. To the south of Dryden along the same range is the crater Chaffee.

The perimeter of Dryden forms a crude circle with an irregular shape due to several small outward bulges. The most notable of these is along the eastern side where the rim has slumped inwards. The rim is not significantly worn, and displays a sharp edge. Attached to the southeastern exterior is the ridge forming part of the inner ring of Apollo. The northeastward extension of this ring is less well defined, but appears to begin at the eastern rim.

Much of the inner wall of the crater consists of a gently sloping inner surface with a pile of debris along the bottom, forming a ring around the interior floor. Offset slightly northeast of the midpoint is a central peak formation. The remainder of the interior is marked only by a few tiny craterlets.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on Lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Dryden.

<text>Bundu (also Bondu, Bondou and Boundou) was a state in West Africa existing from the late 17th century until it became a French protectorate dependent on the colony of Senegal. It lay between the Falémé River and the upper course of the Gambia River, that is between 13 and 15 N., and 12 and 13 W.

==Description==
The country is an elevated plateau, with hills in the southern and central parts. These are generally unproductive, and covered with stunted wood; but the lower country is fertile, and finely clothed with the baobab, the tamarind and various valuable fruit-trees. Bondu is traversed by torrents, which flow rapidly during the rains but are empty in the dry season. The name &#x27;Bundu&#x27; means &#x27;well&#x27; in Pulaar.

==History==
===Early History===
Bundu in the 17th century was a sparsely-populated part of the kingdom of Gajaaga inhabited mostly by Pulaar communities but with minorities of Jakhanke, Soninke and other peoples.

===Malick Sy===
In 1690, Fula Torodbe cleric Malick Sy came to the region from his home near Podor in the Futa Toro. He and his followers may have been fleeing persection in the aftermath of the Char Bouba war or simply seeking a place where Sy could enforce his interpretation of sharia law. The &quot;tunka&quot; of Gajaaga gave Sy control first over one village and then a larger territory, the border of which Sy advantageously manipulated by cheating on a pact with the king. Bundu&#x27;s growth that would set a precedent for later Fula jihads in West Africa. Sy settled the lands with relatives from his native Futa Toro and Muslim immigrants from as far west as the Kingdom of Jolof and as far east as Nioro du Sahel.

Under Sy, Bundu became a refuge for Muslims and Islamic scholars persecuted by traditional rulers in other kingdoms. It eventually expanded east, taking territory from Bambuk. Sy was killed in 1699 caught in an ambush by the army of Gajaaga.

===After Malick Sy===
Sy was succeeded by his son Bubu Malick Sy, who expanded the realm southwards at the expense of local Mandinka kingdoms. By 1716 Bundu was the most powerful state on the upper Senegal. When he in turn died between 1718 and 1727, an interregnum ensued that threatened both &quot;Sisibe&quot; (the descendants of Malick Sy) control over the state and the integrity of its central authority. This was, however, restored by Bubu&#x27;s son Maka Jiba between 1731 and 1735.

From the 1720s to the 1760s Bundu suffered Moroccan and Moorish slave raids, as did the neighboring states of Gajaaga, Bambuk, and Futa Toro. Maka Jiba died in 1764 and was succeeded by his son Amadi Gai, who adopted the title of &quot;almamy&quot; and introduced a legal system based on sharia. The division between the Bulibani and Koussan branches of the family, which would be the source of many succession disputes. originated at this time.

Mungo Park, the first European traveller to visit the country, passed through Bondu in 1795, and had to submit to many exactions from the reigning monarch. The royal residence was then at Fatteconda; but when Major William Gray, a British officer who attempted to solve the Niger problem, visited Bondu in 1818 it had been moved to Bulibani (Boolibany), a village with a population of 1500–1800, surrounded by a strong clay wall.

===19th Century===
The French established a fort at Bakel in Gajaaga in 1820, followed by a brief presence at Sansanding in Bundu itself. Almamy Saada Amadi Aissata Sy, trying to promote trade, agreed to allow a permanent fort built at Senudebou in 1845, though this became a source of contention within the Sisibe ruling class. He also hoped to gain French support for the alliance he was building with the Imamate of Futa Toro and Bambuk against Kaarta, the only state on the upper Senegal that could rival Bundu at this time. But the Europeans, while happy to see Kaarta humbled, did not want Bundunke hegemony either.

In 1851 Saada Amadi died and a civil war broke out. El Hadj Umar Tall took advantage, taking over the area initially with the support of both the people and the Bundu aristocracy. Many Fulbe migrated east to Nioro du Sahel, heart of Tall&#x27;s Toucouleur Empire. In 1855 Bokar Saada Sy, son of Saada Amadi, claimed the title of &quot;almamy&quot; with French support, but only managed to exert real control over Bundu after Tall&#x27;s 1857 defeat at the Siege of Medina Fort with French military support. During this period warfare and famine devastated the economy, and Tall&#x27;s call for Muslims to emigrate eastwards to his domain dramatically reduced the population, particularly among the Fulbe.

In the 1860s and 70s the Sisibe under Bokar Saada rebuilt their wealth through extensive raiding and trading for slaves and cattle as well as taxing the people. By the late 19th century two thirds of the population was enslaved. After the closing of the Senoudebou fort in 1862, Saada was the most powerful representative of French interests east of Bakel. He used this position to continually raid neighboring states for captives and booty, particularly the Kingdom of Wuli.

Nevertheless, in the face of popular discontent, a series of famines and plague outbreaks, and renewed succession disputes, the state was fragile. Mahmadu Lamine&#x27;s popular 1885-7 jihad briefly drove the Sisibe out of power until French military power defeated the jihadist forces and restored them to the throne. With this, French control was effectively complete. The last almamy, chosen by the French, died in 1902.

===Colonialism===
Early years of French control saw a rising population as many former migrants returned. Starting in 1904, however, conditions deteriorated significantly, and large-scale famines forced much of the population to move within or leave Bundu. Slaves in particular took the opportunity to flee or renegotiate their situations, and many joined the French army during World War 1. With the growth of the peanut basin and the reorientation of trade towards the Dakar-Niger Railway, Bundu was increasingly ignored by the colonial administration. The area was economically marginalized, but also saw a flourishing of religious communities deliberately separating themselves from the pagan French.

==Government and Society==
Although nominally a theocracy, Bundu was founded peacefully rather than through religious revolts such as occurred later in Futa Toro and Futa Djallon. This, as well as the presence of large numbers of non-Fulbe and/or non-Muslim inhabitants, meant that Bundu was more secular than other Fula states of the period, though Islam was a source of prestige and legitimacy as well as &quot;causus belli&quot; for slaving raids and conquest. Over time increased Fulbe immigration from these more Islamized areas increased the Muslim population. Still, Bundu never attempted to spread Islam beyond its borders.

Bundu purchased weapons from both the French on the Senegal river and the British on the Gambia, helping them become a regional power and rival to non-Muslim Kaarta. These weapons also, however, sparked internal conflict over rulership between rival branches of the &quot;Sisibe&quot; family based in Koussan and Bulibani.

==Economy==
Bundu benefited from a position athwart major trade routes in gold, ivory, kola nuts, salt, cloth, cotton, gum arabic, and cattle. Large numbers of slaves taken in raids against neighboring communities worked the &quot;almamy&quot;&#x27;s plantations or were sold on to Moorish or Wolof buyers. Visitors in the late 18th century described a flourishing local agricultural industry, with particularly fine horses, and domestic production of incense, cotton, and indigo.

<text>Paruma is a stratovolcano that lies on the border of Bolivia and Chile. It is part of a ridge that contains several stratovolcanos. Paruma lies at the eastern end of the ridge, with Olca to its west. The older volcano Paruma lies to east of Paruma. Paruma has clearly been active during the Holocene, with many morphologically young lava flows on its flanks. It also has persistent fumaroles. One lava flow in particular extends for 7 kilometres to the south-east of the peak. Historical activity along the ridge has been confined to one eruption from 1865 to 1867, the character of which is not precisely known.

<doc id="1337192" wikidata="Q5442998" url="?curid=1337192" title="Fences (play)">
<text>Fences is a 1985 play by the American playwright August Wilson. Set in the 1950s, it is the sixth in Wilson&#x27;s ten-part &quot;Pittsburgh Cycle&quot;. Like all of the &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; plays, &quot;Fences&quot; explores the evolving African-American experience and examines race relations, among other themes. The play won the 1987 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and the 1987 Tony Award for Best Play. &quot;Fences&quot; was first developed at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theater Center&#x27;s 1983 National Playwrights Conference and premiered at the Yale Repertory Theatre in 1985.

==Plot==
The focus of Wilson&#x27;s attention in &quot;Fences&quot; is Troy, a 53 year-old, African American working-class head of household who struggles with providing for his family. The play takes place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; although never officially named, it makes mention of several key locations in Pittsburgh. In his younger days, Troy was an excellent player in Negro league baseball and continued practicing baseball while serving time in prison for a murder he had committed during a robbery. Because the color barrier had not yet been broken in Major League Baseball, Troy was unable to get into the MLB to make good money or to save for the future. He now lives a menial, though respectable, blue-collar life of trash collecting; later in the play, he remarkably crosses the race barrier and becomes the first black truck driver in Pittsburgh instead of just a barrel lifter.

Troy lives with his wife, Rose, and their teenage son, Cory. He has a younger brother, Gabe, a World War II veteran whose war injury to his head has caused him noticeable psychological damage. Gabe had received $5,000 from the government, and Troy took control of this money to purchase a home for his family, including a room for Gabe. A short time before the play&#x27;s opening, Gabriel has rented a room elsewhere, but still in the neighborhood. Lyons is Troy&#x27;s older son from a previous marriage, and lives outside the home. Bono is Troy&#x27;s best friend and co-worker.

The play begins on payday, with Troy and Bono drinking and talking. Troy&#x27;s character is revealed through his speech about how he went up to their boss, Mr. Rand, and asked why African-American men are not allowed to drive garbage trucks; Rose and Lyons join in the conversation. Lyons, a musician, has come to borrow money from Troy, confident that he will receive it, and promises to pay him back because his girlfriend Bonnie just got a job. Troy, who is a rigid believer in hard work and responsibility, belittles his son because he refuses to find a real job, as Troy did, rather than pursuing his dream of becoming a musician.

Cory tells Troy and Rose about an opportunity for a college football scholarship. Troy tells Cory he will not let his son play football for fear of racial discrimination, as Troy believes he experienced when he wanted a career in the major leagues. However, it is suggested later on that Troy told Cory&#x27;s coach that his son is no longer able to play football. When Cory discovers this, he and Troy get into a fight, resulting in Troy sending Cory to his room. Later, it is revealed that Troy&#x27;s age after serving a prison sentence, not his race, may have been the primary factor. Father and son argue about Troy&#x27;s actions, but Troy stubbornly does not back down from his argument and kicks Cory out of the house. Later it is revealed that Cory enlisted in the military after this event.

Troy admits to Rose that he has been having an affair and that his mistress, Alberta, is pregnant. Later, Alberta dies in childbirth. Troy brings his baby daughter Raynell home, and Rose agrees to raise the girl as her own, saying: &quot;From right now . . . this child got a mother. But you a womanless man.&quot; She remains in the family home but the couple are estranged; she refuses to accept Troy back into her life.

Seven years later, Troy has died. Cory comes home for a visit from the military where he is a corporal in the Marines. He initially refuses to go to his father&#x27;s funeral due to long-standing resentment, but he is convinced by his mother to pay his respects to his father — the man who, though hard-headed and often poor at demonstrating affection, nevertheless loved his son. The family say their farewells to Troy and offer forgiveness that may not be fully deserved.

===Allegories===
The brother Gabriel is potentially an allegory to salvation. Other than being actually named Gabriel, like the angel, Gabe wears a trumpet, constantly chases away unseen &quot;hellhounds&quot;, and regularly believes himself to be speaking with Saint Peter. At the end, just before Troy&#x27;s funeral, the family gathers around Gabe in the yard. He blows three times into his trumpet, but no sound comes out. In a moment of trance, Gabe begins to dance and sing. The sun breaks through the clouds while the family looks on. Troy is at last delivered and the rest of the family is too; each seeming to find peace in their relationship with Troy. 

The fence referred to by the play&#x27;s title is built over many years and is revealed to be finished only in the final act of the play. It is not obvious as to why Troy wants to build it, but a dramatic monologue in the second act shows how he conceptualizes it as an allegory — to keep the Grim Reaper away. The fence is also symbolic of the emotional barrier that Troy erected between himself and his sons, one from each of his adult relationships. Rose also wanted Troy to build the fence as a symbolic means of securing what was her own, keeping what belonged inside in (her family), and making what should stay outside, stay out. It also refers to hitting a home run in baseball, ie &quot;swinging for the fences,&quot; attempting the supreme achievement in baseball.

==Productions==
&quot;Fences&quot; was first developed at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theater Center&#x27;s 1983 National Playwrights Conference.

It premiered at the Yale Repertory Theatre in 1985, under the direction of Lloyd Richards (who was then Artistic Director of the Yale Rep), with a cast of James Earl Jones (Troy Maxson), Mary Alice (Rose), Ray Aranha (Jim Bono), Russell Costen (Gabriel), and Courtney B. Vance (Cory).

The play&#x27;s first Broadway production was staged at the 46th Street Theatre on March 26, 1987, and closed on June 26, 1988, after 525 performances and 11 previews. Directed by Lloyd Richards, the first Broadway cast remained largely the same as that of the Yale Rep premiere: James Earl Jones (Troy Maxson), Mary Alice (Rose), Ray Aranha (Jim Bono), Frankie Faison (Gabriel), and Courtney B. Vance (Cory). The production won the Tony Awards for Best Play, Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play (James Earl Jones), Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play (Mary Alice), and Best Direction of a Play (Lloyd Richards), as well as the Drama Desk Awards for Outstanding New Play, Outstanding Actor in a Play (Jones), and Outstanding Featured Actress in a Play (Alice). It also received Tony Award nominations for Best Featured Actor in a Play (Faison and Vance).

The first Broadway revival of the play opened at the Cort Theatre on April 26, 2010, with a limited 13-week engagement. Directed by Kenny Leon, the production starred Denzel Washington (Troy Maxson) and Viola Davis (Rose) as the married couple struggling with changing U.S. race relations. The revival was nominated for 10 Tony Awards, winning three for Best Revival of a Play, Best Actor in a Play (Denzel Washington), and Best Actress in a Play (Viola Davis).

In August, 1990, the play received its premiere production in the UK by Liverpool Playhouse in association with West End producer, Bill Kenwright, in a production by Temba Theatre Company&#x27;s artistic director, Alby James, starring Hollywood movie star Yaphet Kotto as the protagonist Troy Maxson, and coming star, Adrian Lester, as his son, Cory. &quot;Financial Times&quot; critic Alastair Macaulay wrote: &quot;Congratulations to the Liverpool Playhouse for presenting this, its British premiere, and for doing it proud...&#x27; and &#x27;The director Alby James has done wonders in making his largely English cast absolutely persuasive as these Americans.&quot;

In 2013, the play was revived again in the UK by Theatre Royal Bath, starring Lenny Henry as Troy Maxson and directed by Paulette Randall. This production transferred to the Duchess Theatre in London&#x27;s West End for a run that lasted between June and September 2013. Henry&#x27;s performance attracted wide acclaim. Giles Broadbent from the &quot;Wharf&quot; said, “Lenny Henry is immense.” Charles Spencer from &quot;The Telegraph&quot; said of Henry: &quot;He is, and I don’t use the word lightly, magnificent.&quot; Jane Shilling, also from the &quot;Telegraph&quot; said: &quot;What you don’t expect is to find Henry entirely unrecognisable in the physically and morally immense character he embodies.&quot; &quot;Best of Theatre&quot; said: &quot;You may love or loathe his comedy but it is impossible to deny Lenny Henry&#x27;s determination to become a serious actor of some note.&quot; Paul Taylor from &quot;The Independent&quot; said, “the performance cements Henry&#x27;s status as a serious actor.” Henry Hitchings from the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot; said, &quot;He&#x27;s on superb form&quot;. Simon Edge from the &quot;Express&quot; said, &quot;Henry gives a perfectly controlled performance, combining physical poise with an armoury of carefully judged vocal ticks and facial mannerisms.&quot; Of the production as a whole, Hitchings commented that &quot;&quot;Fences&quot; is dense and unsettling. It&#x27;s brave to programme such a meaty, daunting piece during the summer months&quot;. Camilla Gurlter from &quot;A Younger Theatre&quot; described it as “very heavy and with its nearly three hours of lost hope and broken dreams it can feel long and depressing&quot;.

<doc id="1337210" wikidata="Q745753" url="?curid=1337210" title="Mandingo (film)">
<text>Mandingo is a 1975 American historical melodrama film that focuses on the Atlantic slave trade in the Antebellum South. The film&#x27;s title refers to the Mandinka people, who are referred to as &quot;Mandingos&quot;, and described as being good slaves for fighting matches. The word is also used as a pejorative to describe a hypersexual Negro. Produced by Dino De Laurentiis for Paramount Pictures, the film was directed by Richard Fleischer. The screenplay, by Norman Wexler, was adapted from the 1957 novel &quot;Mandingo&quot; by Kyle Onstott, and the 1961 play &quot;Mandingo&quot; by Jack Kirkland (which is derived from the novel).

The film stars Perry King as Hammond, the son of cruel slave owner Warren Maxwell (James Mason). Hammond is known to rape the female slaves on his father&#x27;s plantation, and his father orders him to marry a white woman to produce grandchildren with no black ancestry. Hammond marries Blanche (Susan George), his cousin, who becomes jealous that he pays more attention to his black lover Ellen (Brenda Sykes) than to his wife, leading Blanche to force the Mandingo fighting slave Mede (Ken Norton) into a sexual relationship with her.

&quot;Mandingo&quot; received negative reviews upon release. However, retrospectively, the film&#x27;s reception became much more favorable. It has been variously seen as a big-budget exploitation film made by a major studio, a serious film about American slavery, examining historical horrors committed against African Americans, or as a work of camp. It was a box office hit, and was followed by a sequel, &quot;Drum&quot; (1976), which starred Norton as a different character and Warren Oates as Hammond.

==Plot==
In the Deep South of the United States prior to the American Civil War, Falconhurst is a run-down plantation owned by widower Warren Maxwell and largely run by his son, Hammond. Hammond and his cousin, Charles, visit a plantation where both men are given black women out of hospitality. Hammond chooses Ellen, who is a virgin. Both she and Hammond watch as Charles abuses and rapes the other woman, with Charles claiming that she likes it. Hammond asks Ellen if this is true, and she says no. Hammond then sleeps with Ellen.

Warren Maxwell pressures him to marry, so Hammond chooses his cousin, Blanche, who is desperate to get out of her house to escape her brother Charles. It is implied that she had an incestuous relationship with Charles. After their wedding night, Hammond is sure that she is not a virgin—a claim Blanche denies. On their way back from their honeymoon, Hammond returns to the plantation where Ellen is kept and purchases her as his sex slave. Eventually, he comes to genuinely care for her.

Meanwhile, Hammond purchases a Mandingo slave named Ganymede. Nicknamed &quot;Mede&quot;, the slave works for Hammond as a prize-fighter. He is forced to soak in a large cauldron of very hot salt water to ostensibly toughen his skin. Hammond also breeds Mede with Pearl, even though Pearl is a blood relation of Mede&#x27;s. Hammond makes a great deal of money betting on Mede&#x27;s fights.

Rejected by Hammond, Blanche becomes a slovenly alcoholic who does nothing all day long. While Hammond is on a business trip alone, Blanche discovers Ellen is pregnant. Correctly assuming the baby is Hammond&#x27;s, Blanche beats Ellen. Ellen flees, but falls down some stairs, and miscarries. Hammond (who had promised Ellen that her baby would be freed), returns to Falconhurst and discovers Ellen lost the baby. Threatened with bodily harm by Warren, Ellen does not tell him how she miscarried. Hammond gives Ellen a pair of ruby earrings, which she wears while serving an evening meal. Hammond gave the matching necklace to Blanche, who becomes enraged to find Ellen being publicly favored by Hammond.

Hammond leaves on another business trip, taking Ellen with him. A drunken Blanche demands that Mede come to her bedroom. Although the other slaves attempt to stop him, Mede does as he is ordered. Blanche says she will accuse Mede of rape if he does not have sex with her, so he is forced to spend the night with her, which he does on several occasions.

Hammond returns to the plantation. A great deal of time has passed since Hammond and Blanche&#x27;s marriage, and Warren Maxwell is eager for a grandchild. Sensing that the marriage is troubled, Warren locks Hammond and Blanche in a room together and refuses to let them out until they reconcile. They appear to do so. A short time later, Blanche announces she is pregnant, but when the baby is born, it is clear the child is mixed race. To avoid a scandal, the child, on doctor&#x27;s orders, is allowed to bleed to death from its umbilical cord. Sickened at Blanche&#x27;s sexual indiscretion, Hammond asks the doctor if he has the poison he uses on old slaves and horses. He pours the poison into a toddy for Blanche. An outraged Hammond seeks out Mede, intending to kill him. As Hammond attempts to force Mede into a boiling cauldron of water, Mede tries to tell him that Blanche blackmailed him into having sex with her. Hammond shoots Mede twice with a rifle and the second shot throws Mede into the boiling water. Hammond uses a pitchfork to drown Mede. In a fit of fury, the slave Agamemnon picks up the rifle and aims it at Hammond. When Warren calls him a &quot;crazy nigger&quot; and demands that he put the gun down, the slave shoots and kills Warren. As he runs away, Hammond kneels helpless next to Warren&#x27;s lifeless body.

==Cast==
* James Mason as Warren Maxwell
* Susan George as Blanche Maxwell
* Perry King as Hammond Maxwell
* Richard Ward as Agamemnon
* Brenda Sykes as Ellen
* Ken Norton as Mede
* Sylvester Stallone as Lynching Witness (uncredited)
==Production==

The original novel sold over 4.5 million copies. Film rights were eventually bought by Dino de Laurentiis.

Producer Ralphe Serpe said during filming that the movie was:

A human, sociological story that&#x27;s going to bring about a better understanding between the races ... We&#x27;re faithful to the story of the book but not the spirit. I mean, the book&#x27;s hackwork, isn&#x27;t it? It&#x27;s almost repulsive. A lot of people have read it, but they read it for the wrong reasons. It&#x27;s really a story of love. We had the script rewritten three times. ... I hated that ending in the book where the guy boils the slave down and pours the soup over his wife&#x27;s grave. I mean, we have the slave boiled but we cut out the part where he pours the soup on his grave. He just ... pulls away. And we know that tomorrow there&#x27;s going to be a lot of trouble. It&#x27;s really a very beautiful ending.

Charlton Heston turned down the role of the father and the role of his son was rejected by Timothy Bottoms, Jan Michael Vincent, Jeff Bridges and Beau Bridges. Boxer Ken Norton turned down a $250,000 gate to fight Jerry Quarry to make the film.

== Reception ==

=== Contemporary reviews ===
The critical reception of &quot;Mandingo&quot; was predominantly negative upon release, with the film being seen as being campy by reviewers in 1975. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a score of 29% based on 21 reviews, with an average rating of 5.6/10. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; criticized the film, calling it &quot;racist trash, obscene in its manipulation of human beings and feelings, and excruciating to sit through in an audience made up largely of children, as I did last Saturday afternoon&quot;, giving it a &quot;zero star&quot; rating. Richard Schickel of &quot;Time&quot; magazine found the film boring and cliché-ridden. Leonard Maltin ranked the film as a &quot;BOMB&quot; and dismissed with the word &quot;Stinko!&quot;

===Critical re-evaluation===
In the years following the film&#x27;s initial release, the reception of the film became more favorable. &quot;The Chicago Reader&quot; writer Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote in 1985 that &quot;Mandingo&quot; is &quot;One of the most neglected and underrated Hollywood films of its era [...] it’s doubtful whether many more insightful and penetrating movies about American slavery exist.&quot; Movie critic Robin Wood was enthusiastic about the film, calling it &quot;the greatest film about race ever made in Hollywood.&quot; The &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist Dave Kehr called it &quot;a thinly veiled Holocaust film that spares none of its protagonists&quot;, further describing it as &quot;Fleischer&#x27;s last great crime film, in which the role of the faceless killer is played by an entire social system.&quot; The film has also been the subject of scholarly praise for its handling of race.

In 1996, director Quentin Tarantino has cited &quot;Mandingo&quot; and &quot;Showgirls&quot; as the only two instances &quot;in the last twenty years [that] a major studio made a full-on, gigantic, big-budget exploitation movie&quot;. In Tarantino&#x27;s film &quot;Django Unchained&quot; (2012), the terminology of &quot;Mandingo fighting&quot; was inspired by the 1975 film.

==Sequel==

&quot;Drum&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Mandingo&quot;, was released the following year. Released by United Artists, it was once again produced by Dino De Laurentiis. Ken Norton, Brenda Sykes, and Lillian Hayman were the only actors from the first film to return for the sequel. Norton and Sykes played different characters, and Hayman returned in the role of Lucretia Borgia. Warren Oates took over for Perry King in the role of Hammond Maxwell. The story is set 15 years after the events of the first film.

<text>The Autism Awareness Campaign – United Kingdom was launched in 2000 by British parents and carers Ivan Corea and his wife Charika Corea in response to the autism diagnosis of their son, Charin.

==Objectives==
According to their website, Autism Awareness Campaign – United Kingdom was started in 2000 &quot;to campaign on behalf of parents, carers, children and adults with autism and Asperger syndrome, for better public services in health, education, specialist speech therapy and respite care; for independent research into the causes of autism; for greater public awareness on Autism and Asperger&#x27;s Syndrome&quot;, as well as other areas where they believe there is a shortfall in public-service provision. They have lobbied for greater &quot;awareness&quot; of the condition and for independent research on the causes of autism.

==Events==
;2002 United Kingdom Autism Awareness Year

The Autism Awareness Campaign of 2002 initiated debates in the Parliament of the UK and the Scottish Parliament for Autism Awareness Year, supported by 800 UK organisations including the British Institute of Brain Injured Children, The Disabilities Trust, Autism London and the National Autistic Society. A major conference on autism was held at the King&#x27;s Fund in London and the first ever service for autism was launched in 2002 by the couple who initiated Autism Sunday – it was held at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Autism Sunday is now a massive worldwide event, celebrated in many countries.

;2007 House of Commons autism debate and meeting with Prime Minister
The Autism Awareness Campaign helped raise &quot;awareness&quot; about the condition in 2007 in the House of Commons when Lee Scott, MP for Ilford North, brought a debate on autistic children.

Ivan Corea met with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Tony Blair and Lee Scott MP in April 2007. He presented the Prime Minister with a report calling for a national strategy on autism and a 10-year plan of action in the UK. The call for an urgent review on autism services was supported by leading British charities and community organisations including faith communities. Parliamentarians signed an early day motion on autism (EDM 1359) backing the call for a national strategy on autism and change in policy for people with autism and Asperger syndrome. Ivan Corea met with the British Prime Minister-in-Waiting, Gordon Brown in June 2007 to urge him to launch the national strategy and 10-year plan on autism, particularly in building state-of-the-art &quot;autism schools&quot;.

World Autism Awareness Day

The Autism Awareness Campaign UK were involved in the first United Nations World Autism Awareness Day, declared by the UN General Assembly on Wednesday 2 April 2008 on the recommendation of the State of Qatar.

The campaign called on the United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon to launch a world autism strategy. A CNN interview with presenter Max Foster was televised to mark World Autism Awareness Day on 2 April 2008. International coverage about the Autism Awareness Campaign UK was also given on Associated Press and the campaigners received national coverage in the United Kingdom.

The campaigners released a film to mark the United Nations World Autism Awareness Day with British peer the Baroness Uddin in the House of Lords. Open Every Door, written by the award-winning Sri Lanka-born singer and songwriter, Nimal Mendis, was aired on the UN World Autism Awareness Day by CNN.

London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic bid
Lord Coe appointed Ivan Corea as a London 2012 Olympic bid Ambassador; the Autism Awareness Campaign UK were fully involved with the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic bid.

<doc id="1337218" wikidata="Q1517470" url="?curid=1337218" title="Lords Appellant">
<text>The Lords Appellant were a group of nobles in the reign of King Richard II, who, in 1388, sought to impeach five of the King&#x27;s favourites in order to restrain what was seen as tyrannical and capricious rule. The word &quot;appellant&quot; — still used in modern English by attorneys — simply means &#x27;[one who is] appealing&#x27;. It is the older (Norman) French form of the present participle of the verb &quot;appeler&quot;, the equivalent of the English &#x27;to appeal&#x27;. The group was called the &quot;Lords Appellant&quot; because its members invoked a legal procedure called an &quot;appeal&quot; to begin prosecution: the favourites were charged under an &quot;appeal of treason&quot;, a device borrowed from English civil law, which led to some procedural complications. 

==Members==
There were originally three Lords Appellant:
* Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester, son of Edward III and thus the king&#x27;s uncle; 
* Richard FitzAlan, Earl of Arundel and of Surrey; and 
* Thomas de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick. 

These were later joined by:
* Henry Bolingbroke, Earl of Derby (the future king Henry IV) and 
* Thomas de Mowbray, Earl of Nottingham (later Duke of Norfolk).

== Success ==

Upon the successful conviction of the King&#x27;s favourites at trial, the Lords Appellant formed themselves into an extralegal &quot;Commission&quot; starting on 19 November 1386 to check Richard II&#x27;s power. The following year, 1387, an attempt by Robert de Vere, Earl of Oxford to overthrow the Commission and reestablish Richard as sole ruler ended in a royal defeat at the skirmish of Radcot Bridge, outside Oxford. Richard was thus reduced to a figurehead; he had no real power and was forced to acknowledge the supremacy of the Commission.

The Lords Appellant proceeded to punish the King&#x27;s disgraced favourites by calling the &quot;Merciless Parliament&quot; of 1388 to pass judgement. The nominal governor of Ireland, de Vere, and Richard&#x27;s Lord Chancellor, Michael de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk, who had fled abroad, were sentenced to death &quot;in absentia&quot;. Alexander Neville, Archbishop of York, had his estate confiscated. The Lord Chief Justice, Sir Robert Tresilian, was executed, as were Sir Nicholas Brembre, the Lord Mayor of London, courtiers John Beauchamp of Holt, Sir James Berners, and Sir John Salisbury. Sir Simon Burley was found guilty of exercising undue influence over the king and was sentenced to death. Derby and Nottingham, together with the Duke of York, tried to win a reprieve for him, but he was executed on 5 May.

==Aftermath==
In 1389, Richard&#x27;s uncle, John of Gaunt, returned from campaigning in Spain. His influence enabled Richard to slowly rebuild his power until 1397, when he reasserted his authority and destroyed the principal three among the Lords Appellant. However, in 1399 Richard was deposed by Gaunt&#x27;s son, Henry of Bolingbroke, partly as a result of the royal confiscation of Gaunt&#x27;s estate on his death. Bolingbroke succeeded him as Henry IV.

Richard never forgave the Lords Appellant. His uncle Gloucester was murdered in captivity in Calais; it was (and remains) widely believed that he was killed on Richard&#x27;s orders. The Earl of Arundel was beheaded. Warwick lost his title and his lands and was imprisoned on the Isle of Man until Richard was overthrown by Henry Bolingbroke. The behaviour of the two junior Lords Appellant, Bolingbroke and Mowbray, probably influenced Richard&#x27;s decision in 1398 to exile them both, and to revoke the permission he had given them to sue for any inheritance which fell due, as it did in relation to Mowbray&#x27;s grandmother and, more significantly, of Bolingbroke&#x27;s father, John of Gaunt.

<doc id="1337219" wikidata="Q422737" url="?curid=1337219" title="Pomerape">
<text>Pomerape is a stratovolcano lying on the border of northern Chile and Bolivia (Oruro Department, Sajama Province, Curahuara de Carangas Municipality). It is part of the Payachata complex of volcanoes, together with Parinacota Volcano to the south. The name &quot;Payachata&quot; means &quot;twins&quot; and refers to their appearance. It hosts glaciers down to elevations of , lower on the northern slope.

Pomerape is a complex of lava domes, accompanied by lava flows which were emplaced atop of the domes. It was active about 200,000 years ago. The lava domes formed first and were later buried by the actual volcanic cone, which unlike the rhyolitic-dacitic domes is formed by hornblende andesite. The &quot;Chungará Andesites&quot; and lava dome complex of Parinacota were laid down at this time. Pomerape is associated with an adventive vent that has erupted mafic magmas. The main cone was last active 106,000 +- 7,000 years ago, the adventive vent is dated to 205,000 ± 24,000 years ago.

Climbing the volcano is alpine grade PD by the east ridge. Harder routes exist on the south face, sometimes on 50+ degree snow/rubble slope. For these routes a camp can be established at at the saddle between Parinacota and Pomerape. Depending on the season, the main difficulty can be penitentes (tall ice-blade needles), which make the ascent physically difficult or impossible.

<text>Craig Pass (el.), is a mountain pass located on the Continental Divide in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, United States. The Grand Loop Road crosses the pass approximately east of Old Faithful Geyser.

The pass was named by Hiram Chittenden for Ida M. Craig (Wilcox), the daughter of a close friend, General James Craig. Ida Craig was purportedly the first tourist to cross the pass after it was completed in September, 1891. Roads are usually open throughout the year, but they may be closed for a short time during winter when the weather is bad.

The small Isa Lake is located just west of the pass on the Grand Loop Road and is noted for striding the Continental Divide and draining into two different watersheds—the Atlantic via the Missouri River and the Pacific via the Snake River.

<text>By Jeeves, originally Jeeves, is a musical with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber, and lyrics and book by Alan Ayckbourn. It is based on the series of novels and short stories by P. G. Wodehouse that centre around the character of Bertie Wooster and his loyal valet, Jeeves. 

Premiering on April 22, 1975, at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in London, the show flopped initially, running for only a month. After an extensive rewrite, the show was produced in 1996 in both London and America, and premiered on Broadway in 2001. 

==1975: &quot;Jeeves&quot;==

===Background and production===
Tim Rice conceived the idea of turning P. G. Wodehouse&#x27;s Jeeves stories into a musical. Originally, he was to work with his then-partner, Andrew Lloyd Webber, but Rice backed out of the project. Eventually Lloyd Webber teamed up with famed British playwright Alan Ayckbourn, and the two of them began work with the personal blessing of Wodehouse. Ayckbourn utilised characters and plot lines from several Jeeves and Wooster stories, notably &quot;The Code of the Woosters&quot;. The action takes place at the East London Club for Unmanageable Boys, where Bertie Wooster is playing a banjo concert; his banjo keeps breaking down, so he is forced to tell stories to pass the time while Jeeves is sent off to fetch new strings. Bertie recounts how he managed to become engaged to three ladies simultaneously and how his valet Jeeves (through ingenious intervention) unravelled the complications.

Tryout performances were held at the Bristol Hippodrome between 20 March and 5 April 1975. According to the programme, the Bristol show was presented by David Land and Guy Bolton. Unfortunately, the loyalty to the Wodehouse material made for an epic length (four and three-quarter hours at the Bristol tryouts), and reducing the duration made for creative tensions. Rows broke out about the presence of an all-male singing sextet accompanying Bertie Wooster and the realization that the first woman did not appear on stage until thirty-five minutes had passed. Additional problems were caused by Ayckbourn&#x27;s lack of interest in musical theater as a genre: he was quoted at one point as saying, &quot;I think musicals are pretty damn boring, but I hope this one is a bit different&quot;, and he ended up writing a book that could hypothetically stand on its own without songs.

Lloyd Webber wrote a period score that eschewed all traces of the pop inflections of his work on &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; and &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;. The sound of trumpets, banjos and saxophones for this score were written by a group of arrangers: Keith Amos, Don Walker, Lloyd Webber himself and his future orchestrator, David Cullen.

The show opened in London on 22 April 1975 at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, starring David Hemmings as Bertie Wooster and Michael Aldridge as Jeeves. The role of Madeleine Bassett was performed by T.V. actress Gabrielle Drake. Other cast members included Debbie Bowen, Gordon Clyde, Angela Easterling, John Turner, Bill Wallis and David Wood. Actress Betty Marsden was cast as Aunt Dahlia, but the role and the accomplished actress were released before opening night.

The director Eric Thompson (father of actress Emma Thompson) was fired just before the opening, so Ayckbourn himself stepped in, aided by choreographer Christopher Bruce. The production received poor reviews and closed after little over a month and 38 performances, on 24 May. Several critics noted that the authors failed to develop the title character, Jeeves not even having a solo song.

The original cast album (MCA Cat. No. MCF 2726) was recorded and released, but it is extremely hard to find. Lloyd Webber, reportedly acting on the advice of American theatre director Harold Prince, withdrew the recording in order to be able to reuse some of the musical material in subsequent shows.

===Roles and original cast===
The following is a list of the roles in the 1975 musical, with the original cast.
The list includes Betty Marsden, who was cast as Aunt Dahlia. The role was included in some of the Bristol performances, and Marsden&#x27;s name was featured prominently in promotional materials, but the role was cut before the London production.

===Musical numbers===

The following songs were performed in the 1975 musical in London. The performers stated for the songs are taken from the Bristol Hippodrome programme.

;Act 1
* &quot;Banjo Boy&quot; – Bertie, The Drones
* &quot;The Code Of The Woosters&quot; – Bertie, The Drones
* &quot;Literary Men&quot; – Bertie, Gussie, Jeeves
* &quot;Travel Hopefully&quot; – Bertie, Jeeves, The Drones
* &quot;The Code Of The Woosters&quot; (reprise) – Bertie
* &quot;Female Of The Species&quot; – Stiffy
* &quot;Today&quot; – Bertie, Bingo, Company
* &quot;When Love Arrives&quot; – Bertie, Madeline
* &quot;Today&quot; (reprise) – Stiffy, Madeline, Honoria

;Act 2
* &quot;Entr&#x27;acte&quot; – The Drones
* &quot;Jeeves Is Past His Peak&quot; – Bertie, The Drones
* &quot;Half A Moment&quot; – Stiffy, Harold
* &quot;S.P.O.D.E.&quot; – Spode, Company
* &quot;Summer Day&quot; – Bertie, Company
* &quot;My Sort Of Man&quot; – Honoria
* &quot;Eulalie&quot; – Bertie, Jeeves
* &quot;&#x27;Tis &#x27;Nature&#x27;s Plan&quot; – Company
* &quot;Literary Men&quot; (reprise) – Bertie, Bassett, Honoria, Spode
* &quot;Banjo Boy&quot; (reprise) – Bertie, The Drones
Madeline Bassett&#x27;s name is written as &quot;Madeleine&quot; in the programme. &quot;My Sort Of Man&quot; was added sometime after the opening at Bristol to replace dialogue between Honoria and Bertie. Fourteen songs were recorded as part of the original cast recording, including an &quot;Overture&quot; (without vocals) and an &quot;Entr&#x27;acte&quot; (with vocals). The songs &quot;Food of Love&quot;, sung by Aunt Dahlia, and &quot;Song of Spode&quot;, sung first by Spode and again in a reprise by Aunt Dahlia, were cut before the London production and not recorded. Another song that was not recorded was &quot;Literary Men&quot; sung by Bertie, Jeeves &amp; Gussie, the melody of which was later reused in &quot;Song and Dance&quot; – first as the finale &quot;When You Want to Fall in Love&quot; and later as a new song in the first act &quot;Unexpected Song&quot;.

In the song &quot;Eulalie&quot;, Jeeves advises Bertie to use the word Eulalie to subdue the villainous Spode. Unlike in the novels, the reason that this word affects Spode is not explained in the musical, which ends with the curtain closing as Jeeves is apparently about to explain all. A song similar to &quot;Female Of The Species&quot;, sung by Stiffy, was originally planned to be incorporated in the 1996 revival, but was eventually replaced with &quot;Love&#x27;s Maze&quot;. 

Some of the songs from the score managed to find a life after the original production: &quot;Half a Moment&quot; was later recorded by Lloyd Webber&#x27;s second wife, Sarah Brightman, on the album &quot;The Songs That Got Away&quot; and the track &quot;Summer Day&quot; was re-written and appeared in new chordal disguise as &quot;Another Suitcase in Another Hall&quot; in Evita. A small section of &quot;Half a Moment&quot; was cut from the song and reused in &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; as part of the song &quot;As if We Never Said Goodbye&quot;.

The melody of &quot;Female of the Species&quot; appeared earlier than its Jeeves incarnation, with lyrics written and sung by Tim Rice as &quot;The Ballad of Robert and Peter&quot; in 1973 (for private recording purposes). &quot;Travel Hopefully&quot; is a melody originally written as &quot;Love Is Here&quot; for the first ever Lloyd Webber/Rice project, &quot;The Likes of Us&quot;.

==1996: &quot;By Jeeves&quot;==

===Background===
In 1996, Lloyd Webber and Ayckbourn decided to revisit the show, jettisoning most of the score and the entire original book. Retitled &quot;By Jeeves&quot; (so as to dispel all previous associations with the original production), the character of Roderick Spode and his fascistic intentions were eliminated from the plot. The character list was whittled down from 22 to 10, and the original orchestrations also underwent a reduction to a small band. Only three songs from the original show remained lyrically intact: &quot;Banjo Boy&quot;, &quot;Half a Moment&quot; and &quot;Travel Hopefully&quot;, as well as the chorus for &quot;Code of the Woosters&quot;. The other songs and musical interludes were mostly new or reworked compositions by Lloyd Webber.

===Productions===
&quot;By Jeeves&quot; re-opened on 1 May 1996 at the Stephen Joseph Theatre-in-the-round in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, an English seaside resort. Audience reaction was generally enthusiastic so the show moved on 2 July 1996 to London for a 12-week season at the fairly intimate Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre. The show turned out to be more popular than first thought, and the run was extended to February 1997 with the show moved to The Lyric Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue.

Steven Pacey played Bertie Wooster and Malcolm Sinclair played his valet Jeeves. The Musical Director was Kate Young. The 1996 cast recording has an unusual format, taking a track between every song where Bertie and Jeeves humorously summarize the plot. Pacey was nominated for an Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical, and &quot;By Jeeves&quot; also received nominations for Outstanding New Production and Best Costume Designer. A radio version, performed by the original London cast, was broadcast on 14 December 1996 on BBC Radio 2.

The show had its United States premiere on 12 November 1996, at the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam Connecticut. U.S. actor John Scherer took the part of Bertie, and Richard Kline played Jeeves. Edward Keith Baker played Jeeves with Scherer as Bertie Wooster in the 1997 Geffen Playhouse production.

A pre-Broadway staging of the musical was presented at Pittsburgh Public Theater&#x27;s O&#x27;Reilly Theater in February 2001. It ran through 4 March 2001. John Scherer portrayed Bertie Wooster and British actor Martin Jarvis portrayed Jeeves.

&quot;By Jeeves&quot; had a brief run on Broadway at the Helen Hayes Theater, from 28 October 2001 (in previews October 16) to 30 December 2001, for 73 performances. Directed by Ayckbourn, the cast featured Scherer (Bertie), James Kall (Gussie) and Martin Jarvis (Jeeves) (who received the Theatre World Award).

In the 2011 production of the musical at the Landor Theatre in Clapham, London, Kevin Trainor played Bertie Wooster, with Paul M. Meston as Jeeves. 

The musical was produced in 2017 at the Old Laundry Theatre, Bowness-on-Windermere (UK), with Alan Ayckbourn as the director. Nadim Naaman portrayed Bertie Wooster and Bill Champion portrayed Jeeves.

===Plot synopsis===
====Act One====
A charity banjo concert is to be performed in a church by Bertie Wooster, an amiable gentleman who often finds himself involved in various misadventures from which he is saved by his intelligent valet Jeeves. A friendly vicar, the Rev. Harold &quot;Stinker&quot; Pinker, introduces his friend Bertie to the church audience (the actual audience). Stinker also introduces the volunteers who are helping with the charity concert, and the show&#x27;s stage manager, Jeeves. Bertie is handed an instrument and starts playing, but stops when he realizes he is holding a frying pan (&quot;A False Start&quot;). Jeeves reports that the banjo was stolen (though it is implied that this was arranged by Jeeves, who does not want Bertie to play the banjo). Jeeves suggests that Bertie recount one of his adventures while they wait for a replacement banjo. The volunteers perform the roles of the other characters in the story.

Jeeves directs the impromptu story to start. In the story, Bertie faces the magistrate Sir Watkyn Bassett in court after taking a constable&#x27;s helmet as a boyish prank. Bertie uses an assumed name, Gussie Fink-Nottle. (Bertie has doubts about telling an improvised story, but decides to continue so the audience will not be disappointed (&quot;Wooster Will Entertain You&quot;). Jeeves continues to manage the production, and reminds Bertie about the story&#x27;s events.) The real Gussie Fink-Nottle, one of Bertie&#x27;s pals, comes to Bertie&#x27;s flat. Gussie declares that he loves his friend Madeline Bassett, Sir Watkyn Bassett&#x27;s daughter. Bertie has apologized for using Gussie&#x27;s name, but now Gussie cannot use his own name with Sir Watkyn, so he has assumed Bertie&#x27;s name. Madeline helped come up with this plan and invited Gussie to Sir Watkyn&#x27;s country house, Totleigh Towers. Sir Watkyn and Gussie (calling himself Bertie) go to Totleigh. Bertie is shocked by an announcement in &quot;The Times&quot; saying that he is engaged to Stephanie &quot;Stiffy&quot; Byng, Sir Watkyn&#x27;s ward. Bertie is friends with Stiffy but has no intention of marrying her. Following Jeeves&#x27;s advice, Bertie plans to go to Totleigh using Gussie&#x27;s name again, to confront Stiffy.

While driving to Totleigh, Bertie remains optimistic and also sees his friend Bingo Little, who loves the formidable Honoria Glossop (&quot;Travel Hopefully&quot;). Honoria also appears. She and Bertie were once engaged, and she still has feelings for Bertie, though Bertie is too polite to tell her he is glad the engagement ended (&quot;That Was Nearly Us&quot;). Bingo overhears this and is annoyed with Bertie. Bertie introduces himself, accidentally using his real name, to forthright American businessman Cyrus Budge III Jr., a guest at Totleigh who wants to court Madeline. Stiffy loves Stinker Pinker (played by himself), but they need Sir Watkyn&#x27;s approval to marry. Stiffy had an engagement announced between her and Bertie so Bertie would have to come. She wants Bertie to help her and Stinker (&quot;Love&#x27;s Maze&quot;). To make Bertie stay and help, she points out that Gussie will be in trouble when Sir Watkyn reads the engagement announcement in &quot;The Times&quot;. Since Cyrus knows Bertie&#x27;s name, Bertie makes sure Gussie uses his own name when greeting Cyrus, and they all reintroduce themselves (&quot;The Hallo Song&quot;). Cyrus realizes he is Gussie&#x27;s rival for Madeline&#x27;s affections and intimidates Gussie. Madeline inadvertently reveals to her father that Bertie is not Gussie, so Bertie pretends he is Bingo Little instead. Honoria and Bingo arrive at the house, and Bertie introduces Bingo as Gussie Fink-Nottle. Sir Watkyn and Cyrus are left confused about who is who.

====Act Two====
At the start of the second act, Sir Watkyn is confused about the identities of his guests, Bertie is concerned about Stiffy&#x27;s scheming, and Bingo and Gussie want to be united with Honoria and Madeline respectively. Bertie, Bingo, and Gussie are not sure what to do next and ask for help from the brainy Jeeves (&quot;By Jeeves&quot;). Jeeves tells them he has not yet thought of a way to help. Gussie is afraid of Cyrus, who threatens to fight Gussie, and is too shy anyway to confess his feelings to Madeline. Jeeves suggests that Bertie tell Madeline that Gussie loves her. Bertie tries to do so by telling Madeline that someone loves her, but she misunderstands and thinks Bertie is confessing his love for her (&quot;When Love Arrives&quot;). Gussie and Cyrus are now upset with Bertie. Bertie is annoyed that Jeeves&#x27;s advice has not kept him out of trouble, though Jeeves says he has tried his best to help (&quot;What Have You Got To Say, Jeeves?&quot;). Bertie tells Jeeves not to help anymore (except as stage manager).

Stiffy comes up with a plan for Bertie to pretend to be a burglar, so that Stinker can impress Sir Watkyn by stopping him. Stiffy and Stinker sing about their love for each other (&quot;Half A Moment&quot;). Bertie, somewhat moved by their song, reluctantly agrees to help them by taking part in Stiffy&#x27;s scheme. Bertie wears a pig mask (since no better mask was available among the props on hand) and uses a ladder to break into Totleigh Towers. He ends up climbing into the wrong room, and is chased by multiple characters through the house, since they think he is really a masked burglar (&quot;It&#x27;s A Pig!&quot;). Before Stinker can make an appearance of apprehending Bertie, Cyrus tries to catch Bertie, and Stinker accidentally hits Cyrus, who is briefly knocked out. While chasing Bertie through Totleigh Towers, Gussie reunites with Madeline by coming to help her, and Bingo bonds with Honoria. Just as Bertie is about to be unmasked by Sir Watkyn, Bertie apologizes to Jeeves for doubting him and asks for his help. Jeeves switches Cyrus and Bertie&#x27;s places. Bertie is saved and Cyrus is caught as the thief. Since Stinker apparently helped catch the thief, he gets Sir Watkyn&#x27;s approval. Bertie, Bingo, and Gussie try to reintroduce themselves to Sir Watkyn, though he is still confused. Stinker escorts Cyrus away, and the happy couples depart. Jeeves has also prevented further trouble by acquiring Sir Watkyn&#x27;s copy of &quot;The Times&quot; before Sir Watkyn could see the engagement announcement.

The Totleigh Towers story ends. A new banjo arrives for Bertie to play, though it has been muted (apparently on purpose, since Jeeves does not want Bertie to play the banjo). Jeeves convinces Bertie that the banjo is still audible to the audience, so Bertie believes he can finally play the banjo for the audience as intended. He sings a song while playing the muted banjo, and the other actors perform as a supporting chorus while wearing costumes from &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; which they had on hand (&quot;Banjo Boy&quot;). Lastly, the group performs a reprise of multiple songs (&quot;Wizard Rainbow Banjo Mix&quot;).

===Roles and original cast===
===Musical numbers===

There are thirteen songs. In the 1996 American premiere, the second song &quot;The Code Of The Woosters&quot; was replaced with &quot;Wooster Will Entertain You&quot;, and the first performance of &quot;Banjo Boy&quot; (which Bertie does not finish) was retitled &quot;A False Start&quot;. These changes were kept for the 1996 BBC radio production of the musical with the original London cast. The second version of the original London cast recording, released in March 1997, has &quot;Wooster Will Entertain You&quot; in place of &quot;The Code Of The Woosters&quot;, which had been included in the first version released in July 1996.

;Act 1
* &quot;A False Start&quot; – Bertie
* &quot;Wooster Will Entertain You&quot; – Bertie
* &quot;Travel Hopefully&quot; – Bertie, Jeeves, Bingo
* &quot;That Was Nearly Us&quot; – Honoria, Bertie
* &quot;Love&#x27;s Maze&quot; – Stiffy, Bertie, Company
* &quot;The Hallo Song&quot; – Bertie, Budge, Gussie
;Act 2
* &quot;By Jeeves&quot; – Bertie, Bingo, Gussie
* &quot;When Love Arrives&quot; – Bertie, Madeline
* &quot;What Have You Got To Say, Jeeves?&quot; – Bertie, Jeeves
* &quot;Half A Moment&quot; – Harold, Stiffy
* &quot;It&#x27;s A Pig!&quot; – Honoria, Madeline, Bertie, Bassett, Gussie
* &quot;Banjo Boy&quot; – Bertie, Company
* &quot;Wizard Rainbow Banjo Mix&quot; – Company
The thirteenth song &quot;Wizard Rainbow Banjo Mix&quot; is a reprise of multiple songs in the musical. &quot;The Hallo Song&quot; is a reworked tune, released in 1972 as &quot;What a Line to Go Out On&quot; sung by Yvonne Elliman. The tune of &quot;It&#x27;s a Pig!&quot; appeared with different lyrics as &quot;Magdalena&quot;, an unsuccessful pop song for Tony Christie in 1977.

In the Broadway 2001 production, the song &quot;Wooster Will Entertain You&quot; appears to have been replaced with a song titled &quot;Never Fear&quot; according to the Broadway show&#x27;s programme, (the tune of which comes from the song &quot;You Won&#x27;t Care About Him Anymore&quot; heard in another Lloyd Webber project that was only staged in limited form at his Sydmonton Festival called &quot;The Likes of Us&quot;).

==Awards and nominations==

<text>Dick and Dee Dee (or Dick and Deedee) are an American singer-songwriter duo who reached popularity in the early to mid-1960s. The group was founded by California classmates Richard Gosting and Mary Sperling. They eventually changed their names to Dick St. John and Dee Dee Sperling (currently Dee Dee Phelps). They had their first hit in 1961 when &quot;The Mountain&#x27;s High&quot; reached No. 2 on the Billboard 100. They toured with the Beach Boys and opened for the Rolling Stones during the Stones&#x27;s 1964 tour of California. Regulars on the show &quot;Shindig!&quot;, the duo had multiple hit songs before St. John and Sperling disbanded in 1969. In the 1980s, St. John toured with his wife, Sandy. Dick St. John died on December 27, 2003, after a fall at his home. Dee Dee Phelps began performing with actor/singer Michael Dunn as Dick and Dee Dee in 2008, appearing in large doo wop and rock and roll shows throughout the United States.

==History==

===Founding===
Dick St. John and Dee Dee Sperling met while students at Paul Revere Junior High School in Los Angeles, California. They attended different high schools, only to re-encounter one another after graduation. At the time Sperling was attending college and working at a See&#x27;s Candy store, and St. John was looking for a job. They realized they were singer-songwriters, and together they began writing songs and singing the vocal parts. The duo were not romantically linked.

===The Mountain&#x27;s High===
The first Dick and Dee Dee 45 rpm release (&quot;I Want Someone&quot; backed by &quot;The Mountain&#x27;s High&quot;) was on Lama Records, a small company started by their record producers, the Wilder brothers and Don Ralke. Their recordings were created with four voice tracks. Each of them sang two separate harmony lines. St. John sang the highest and lowest parts including the falsetto, and Dee Dee sang the middle notes. Without telling the duo, the record producers changed Mary&#x27;s name to Dee Dee, something the duo did not discover until after the record was released.

The rock and roll song &quot;The Mountain&#x27;s High&quot; became a smash hit in San Francisco. The single was leased to Liberty Records for national distribution and spent two weeks at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The track reached No. 37 in the UK Singles Chart, and eventually sold over a million copies. Sperling left college to perform with St. John on rock and roll tours in America, Europe, and Japan.

===Touring with the Beach Boys, Rolling Stones===
In the United States early on in their career, Dick and Dee Dee performed at California high school assemblies with the upcoming surf band the Beach Boys. They eventually sang in 49 of the 50 states, with acts like Roy Orbison, the Righteous Brothers, Ike and Tina Turner, Dionne Warwick, the Shirelles, The Dick Clark Caravan of Stars, Murray the K’s Brooklyn Paramount Theatre review, Paul Revere and the Raiders, the Kingsmen, Patti La Belle, the Crystals, the Drifters, Ben E. King, Jan and Dean, the Miracles, the Dovells, Johnny Tillotson, Jackie Wilson, and Sonny and Cher.

Dick and Dee Dee were the opening act for the Rolling Stones when the band came to California for their first tour in 1964. The duo recorded their voices on three Rolling Stones tracks while visiting London in 1964, including &quot;Blue Turns to Grey&quot;, and &quot;Some Things Just Stick in Your Mind&quot;, penned by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. In an interview with BBC Radio recorded in 2006, Dee Dee Phelps revealed that their singing was overdubbed onto backing tracks recorded by the Rolling Stones with Mick Jagger&#x27;s vocals removed. The songs were officially sanctioned, largely at the behest of Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham, and released on Warner Bros. Records.

===Later singles===
The duo had eight other singles chart with a total of five reaching the Top 30. Their other hits included &quot;Tell Me&quot; (1962), &quot;Young and in Love&quot; (1963), &quot;Turn Around&quot; in 1964 (written by Malvina Reynolds and recorded by Harry Belafonte), and &quot;Thou Shalt Not Steal&quot; (their second-biggest hit, reaching No. 13 in 1965, which included a special picture sleeve issue promoting Triumph Motorcycles). They also performed the song &quot;Bupkiss&quot; (which was also the title of the episode) on &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;. After their last hit &quot;Thou Shalt Not Steal&quot;, they remained regulars on Jack Good&#x27;s television show &quot;Shindig!&quot;.

===Disbanding, revivals===
In 1965, Dee Dee married the duo&#x27;s manager (later executive television producer for Dick Clark Productions), Bill Lee, and had one son. In 1969, St. John and Sperling parted ways. Dick St. John continued as a songwriter, co-writing &quot;Yellow Balloon&quot; for the group of the same name. After her divorce in the early seventies, Dee Dee married Kane Phelps and moved to Big Sur for the remainder of that decade. They raised two other children, moving back to the Los Angeles area in the 1980s, and are still married .

In the 1980s, St. John revived the Dick and Dee Dee act with his wife, Sandy. The two of them also authored a cookbook in 1993, &quot;The Rock and Roll Cookbook&quot;, which featured recipes of various rock and roll artists. St. John died on December 27, 2003, after a fall from the roof of his house, at the age of 63.

Dick &amp; Dee Dee are name-checked several times (as rumored to be re-uniting) in the 1980 movie &quot;One-Trick Pony&quot;, written by, and starring, Paul Simon.

===Dick and Dee Dee today===
In 2006, Dee Dee Phelps published &quot;Vinyl Highway, Singing as Dick and Dee Dee in the Sixties&quot;, and in 2008 she teamed with actor and singer Michael Dunn to again revive the classic Dick and Dee Dee songs on stage.

Dunn was trained at the Juilliard School and had a lengthy theatrical career in his native Chicago. He is also a lyricist, partnering with producer/composer Jim Price for several years in Nashville. He sang the John Lennon lead vocals on Dan Castellaneta’s Beatles tribute, &quot;Two Lips: The Lost Album&quot;, in 1998. For over a decade he has performed a one-man show as Charles Dickens for Los Angeles audiences.

<text>Yakovkin is a lunar impact crater that lies very near the southwest limb of the Moon. It is located to the northwest of the crater Pingré, and was designated 
Pingré H before it was named by the IAU. The proximity of this crater to the limb hinders observation from the Earth, and gives it a foreshortened appearance.

The uneven rim of this crater has a polygonal shape, rather than forming a simple circle. The interior floor has been flooded by lava, leaving a relatively small inner wall. The interior floor is nearly featureless, with only a few tiny craterlets marking the surface. The surrounding terrain appears to have been resurfaced, and is marked only by small or shallow craters. The terrain farther to the northeast is considerably more rough and uneven.

This crater lies within the Mendel-Rydberg Basin, a 630 km wide impact basin of Nectarian age.

<text>John Pyke Hullah (27 June 1812 – 21 February 1884) was an English composer and teacher of music, whose promotion of vocal training is associated with the singing-class movement. He worked with Charles Dickens and Felix Mendelssohn.

== Life and career ==

Hullah was born at Worcester. He was a pupil of William Horsley from 1829, and entered the Royal Academy of Music in 1833. He wrote an opera to words by Dickens, &quot;The Village Coquettes&quot;, produced in 1836; &quot;The Barbers of Bassora&quot; in 1837; and &quot;The Outpost&quot; in 1838, the last two at Covent Garden. From 1839, when he went to Paris to investigate various systems of teaching music to large masses of people, he identified himself with Wilhem&#x27;s system of the fixed &quot;do,&quot; in contrast to the moveable &quot;do&quot; of the Tonic sol-fa. His adaptation of Wilhem&#x27;s system was taught with enormous success from 1840 to 1860. His first-ever lesson was given at the Battersea College for training teachers (now University St Mark and St John Plymouth), in 1840, at the instigation of educationalist and college Principal James Kay Shuttleworth. His pupils included William Carter and Edmund Hart Turpin.
In 1847 a large building in Long Acre, called St Martin&#x27;s Hall, was built by subscription and presented to Hullah. It was inaugurated in 1850 and burnt to the ground in 1860, a blow from which Hullah was long in recovering. In 1849 William Sterndale Bennett, founder and chairman of the Bach Society, invited Hullah to join his committee, with a view to producing the first English performance of Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot;, which took place on 6 April 1854. As a sight-singing pioneer, Hullah produced his popular series &quot;Vocal Scores&quot; (1846) and &quot;Part-Music&quot; (1867). A series of lectures was given at the Royal Institution in 1861, and in 1864 he lectured in Edinburgh, but in the following year he was unsuccessful in his application for the Reid professorship.

He conducted concerts in Edinburgh in 1866 and 1867, and the concerts of the Royal Academy of Music from 1870 to 1873; he had been elected to the committee of management in 1869. In 1872 he was appointed by the Council of Education as Musical Inspector of Training Schools for the United Kingdom. In 1878 he went abroad to report on the condition of musical education in schools, and wrote a very valuable report, quoted in the memoir of him published by his wife in 1886. He was attacked by paralysis in 1880, and again in 1883.

Dr. Hullah was Honorary Fellow of King&#x27;s College, London, and Professor of Vocal Music at Queen&#x27;s College, London, and Bedford College, London. He succeeded Dr. Horsley as organist of the Charterhouse (in its original London location) in 1858, and held the post until his death. He received the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from the University of Edinburgh in 1876.

His compositions, which remained popular for some years after his death in 1884, consisted mainly of ballads (such as his musical adaptation of Charles Kingsley&#x27;s poem &quot;Three Fishers&quot;), but his importance in the history of music is due to his exertion in popularizing musical education, and his persistent opposition to the Tonic sol-fa system, which had a success he could not foresee. His objections to it were partly grounded on the character of the music which was in common use among the early teachers of the system.

The novelist Elizabeth Sara Sheppard portrayed Hullah as the character Lenhart Davy in her 1853 novel &quot;Charles Auchester&quot;. His widow, Frances Rosser Hullah, published a biography of her late husband.

<text>Manhattan Regional Airport in Riley County, Kansas, United States, is the second-busiest commercial airport in Kansas. Owned by the city of Manhattan, Kansas, the airport is located about five miles southwest of downtown Manhattan. American Airlines via its American Eagle (airline brand) affiliate serves the airport with five daily regional jet flights, with two nonstops to Chicago O&#x27;Hare International Airport (ORD) and three nonstops to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW). The airport also accommodates general aviation and charter flights for the military and college sports teams, being conveniently located four miles east of Fort Riley and eight miles southwest of Kansas State University&#x27;s athletic complex).

The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2013–2017 categorized it as a &quot;primary commercial service&quot; airport (more than 10,000 enplanements per year).

Traffic at the airport multiplied after American Eagle began its service in August 2009. Between 2008 and 2012, Federal Aviation Administration records show that annual passenger boardings (enplanements) at the airport grew from 16,489 to more than 69,000. The most recent statistics show 70,705 enplanements in 2018.

==History==
Manhattan Regional Airport, located in Riley County, Kansas, began construction on June 13, 1939, with the establishment of temporary grass runways. The airport was officially dedicated in November 1940. The first terminal, named &quot;Manhattan Municipal Airport,&quot; opened on April 19, 1953, with a speech by U.S. Senator Frank Carlson, coinciding with the start of Continental Airlines DC-3 flights.

Since the 1950s, Manhattan Regional Airport has been served by several airlines. In 1979, the southwest end of runway 3-21 was extended by 1,500 feet, and the entire runway was widened by 50 feet to accommodate new Boeing 737 service operated by Frontier Airlines. The original runway, constructed in 1963, features 13 inches of concrete, with additional concrete added in 1979 at the southwest end and widened areas. However, due to the location of a localizer antenna, only a 660-foot area for runway safety is built at the departure end of runway 21, compared to the compliant 1000-foot area at the end of runway 3. As a result, runway 21 has a landing length of 7,000 feet, whereas takeoffs and landings from runway 3 are limited to 6660 feet.

Manhattan Regional Airport continues to be a key transportation hub, serving the local community and supporting economic development in the region.

The current airline terminal opened in two phases between 2015 and 2016, replacing the 1997 terminal. The $18 million project has three jet bridge parking positions from two gates, and can accommodate aircraft as large as the Boeing 737 or Airbus A320. The new terminal has more space for ticketing, baggage claim, car rental, and security screening. There is space for a restaurant, but as of August 2017 a tenant has not been found.

===Historical airline service===
;Continental Airlines
The first scheduled airline at Manhattan was Continental Airlines, which began Douglas DC-3 flights in April 1953. Manhattan was added as a stop on a route between Denver and Kansas City, a route that made a total of ten stops at smaller cities throughout Colorado and Kansas. Continental pulled out in 1961, replaced by Central Airlines.

;Central Airlines
Central Airlines provided service from 1961 through 1967 by picking up the former Continental Airlines route between Denver and Kansas City with stops at Manhattan and several other points. Central also used DC-3 aircraft.

;Capitol Air Service
Capitol Air Service (ICAO airline designator CPX), was headquartered in Manhattan from the 1960s until the company ceased flights in 1989, after having twice been grounded by the FAA for multiple safety and records keeping violations. Capitol Air provided point-to-point air service to cities throughout northeastern Kansas.

In the 1970s Capital Air, an air taxi service, suffered two crashes, one with fatalities. In the 1980s one of its aircraft was tipped over by a gust of wind while waiting for take off clearance, and another aircraft, a Twin Otter, clipped the side of a terminal building, both incidents occurring at Kansas City International Airport.

At its height Capitol Air served Manhattan; Salina, KS (SLN); Topeka, KS (FOE); Lawrence, KS (LWC); and Kansas City, MO (MCI) using two 20-passenger de Havilland Canada Twin Otters and smaller Cessna 402 aircraft. From mid-1987 until early 1989 Capitol Air operated as Braniff Express on behalf of Braniff Airways.

;Frontier Airlines
Starting when it merged with Central Airlines in 1967, the original Frontier Airlines flew from Manhattan to Salina, Wichita (ICT), and Denver (DEN) westbound and to Topeka (FOE) and Kansas City eastbound on 44-seat Convair CV580s. Beginning in late 1979 Frontier replaced their Convair turboprop aircraft with Boeing 737-200 jets on the same routings. Direct service to Chicago O&#x27;Hare International Airport with a stop at Lincoln was also added with the 737s. All Frontier service ended in 1983 being replaced by Air Midwest.

;Trans Central Airlines
Trans Central briefly operated from Manhattan to Oklahoma City and Dallas/Ft. Worth in 1982 using Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner commuter aircraft.

;Air Midwest
Beginning in 1982, Wichita-based Air Midwest flew from Manhattan to Kansas City and Salina on 17-passenger Swearingen Metroliner IIs. From 1986 through 1988 Air Midwest was an Eastern Air Lines affiliate, operating as Eastern Express and flew 30-passenger Saab 340As in the Eastern paint scheme to Kansas City. When Eastern closed its hub at Kansas City in late 1988, Air Midwest signed a new codeshare agreement with the second incarnation of Braniff Airlines, which had started a small hub at MCI, and began flights as Braniff Express&#x27;to Kansas City on Swearingen Metroliner IIs. This was in addition to Capitol Air&#x27;s service to Kansas City also operating as Braniff Express. Braniff filed bankruptcy and shut down in late 1989 and Air Midwest reverted to operating under their own branding to Kansas City. Air Midwest was also operating a codeshare agreement with TWA as Trans World Express at the major carriers&#x27; St. Louis hub. For a short time in 1990 nonstop TWExpress flights were operated from Manhattan to St. Louis using Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia aircraft.

;Mesa Air Group

In 1991 Air Midwest was sold to the Mesa Air Group of Arizona. Subsequently, Air Midwest (a Mesa Air Group subsidiary), acting under a codeshare agreement with US Airways and operating as US Airways Express, served Kansas City, Missouri from Manhattan, Kansas with three daily flights using 19-passenger Beechcraft 1900D turboprop aircraft. The service ended in 2008 when Mesa Air Group shut down the Air Midwest division and all Essential Air Service contracts and flights operated by Mesa were closed.

;Great Lakes Airlines
Great Lakes Airlines flew to Manhattan between March 30, 2008, and April 7, 2010, taking over after Mesa left and ending service after American Eagle announced additional expansion. There were three daily flights, most days to Kansas City, and initially two daily flights (with one stop) to Denver. The flights to Denver were later cut back to once daily. Great Lakes used Beech 1900Ds.

;Allegiant Air
Allegiant Air operated a short-lived jet service with twice-weekly nonstop flights between Manhattan and Phoenix–Mesa Gateway Airport from November 7, 2013, to February 23, 2014.

;American Eagle
American Eagle began service on August 26, 2009, with two daily nonstop flights to the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW). In 2010 new service to Chicago O&#x27;Hare International Airport (ORD) was added as well as a third flight to DFW. Flights to DFW are currently operated by Envoy Air with Embraer ERJ-175 regional jets. Flights to ORD are currently flown by Air Wisconsin with Canadair CRJ200 regional jets. Flights to ORD were discontinued in April 2020 but returned in May 2021.

==Facilities==
Manhattan Regional Airport covers 680 acres (275 ha) at an elevation of 1,066 feet (325 m).

In 2017 the airport had 24,260 aircraft operations: 81% general aviation, 4% airline, 9% air taxi and 6% military. 42 aircraft were then based at this airport: 33 single-engine, 7 multi-engine and 2 jet.

The airport has two concrete runways: 3/21 is 7,000 by 150 feet (2,134 x 46 m) and 13/31 is 5,000 by 75 feet (1,524 x 23 m). There are five taxiways and two parking aprons; they can support aircraft as large as the Boeing 767 or C-17 but city ordinance requires aircraft with a landing weight of greater than 110,000 contact the airport director prior to landing or they will be in violation of the city ordinance.

Three navigation systems and multiple lighting systems guide aircraft; an FAA control tower and two Aircraft Rescue and Fire-Fighting (ARFF) vehicles round out the airside support. Any aircraft with 30 passenger seats or more, or over landing weight requires prior permission from the Airport Director to land. Aircraft as large as the Boeing 767 land occasionally as charters for the military or sports teams.

===Services===
The first phase of the airport&#x27;s new terminal facility opened in March 2015, housing American Airlines, Hertz Rent-a-Car, Enterprise Car Rental, and other services. The expanded facility includes two gates, an expanded TSA security checkpoint, and additional passenger circulation space. There are also accommodations for a future airport restaurant. The terminal replaces a terminal opened in 1997, which was demolished and replaced due to increased commercial airline traffic. The terminal is located at 5500 Skyway Drive, adjacent to the FAA control tower and FBO.
The FBO facility, next to the passenger terminal, is occupied by Kansas Air Center, which has been operating at the Manhattan airport since May 1989. It is a full service FBO, providing fuel, charter service, flight instruction, aircraft rental and management services.

An older terminal building built in 1958 is now home to the airport administrative offices. This facility is at 1725 South Airport Road, east of the passenger terminal.

Heartland Aviation uses an stone maintenance hangar, constructed in 1940, next to the old terminal building for servicing and repairing aircraft. The Kansas State University Flying Club, an airport tenant for over 50 years, has office space in this facility for instruction and flight planning.

Other facilities include a fire station, 48 hangars, storage areas, a fuel farm, and an air traffic control tower.

The airport has three parking lots adjacent to the passenger terminal. Paid parking began in February 2021, replacing free parking.

** Order 2004-2-14 (February 17, 2004): selects Air Midwest, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Mesa Air Group, Inc., d/b/a US Airways Express, to provide subsidized essential air service (EAS) for a two-year period at Manhattan and Salina, Kansas, at a combined annual subsidy rate of $721,605.
** Order 2006-3-15 (March 15, 2006): re-selecting Air Midwest, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Mesa Air Group, Inc., d/b/a US Airways Express, to provide subsidized essential air service (EAS) for the two-year period beginning March 1, 2006, at Manhattan and Salina, Kansas, at a combined annual subsidy rate of $974,008.
** Order 2007-12-25 (December 21, 2007): re-selecting Air Midwest, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Mesa Air Group, Inc., d/b/a US Airways Express to provide subsidized essential air service (EAS) at Manhattan and Salina, Kansas, for a total annual subsidy of $1,619,566 for the two-year period beginning March 1, 2008.
** Order 2008-2-5 (February 1, 2008): prohibiting Air Midwest, Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of Mesa Air Group, Inc., d/b/a US Airways Express from suspending its subsidized essential air services at Manhattan and Salina, Kansas, until Great Lakes Aviation, Ltd. begins full replacement service, and selecting Great Lakes to provide those services for a new two-year period at an annual subsidy rate of $1,997,237.
** Order 2009-11-25 (November 30, 2009): requesting proposals from carriers interested in providing essential air service (EAS) at Salina, Kansas, for the two-year period beginning April 1, 2010, with or without subsidy. With respect to this order, we are soliciting proposals for service to Salina only. In the past, the communities of Salina and Manhattan were handled under the same contract because the flights were historically routed Salina-Manhattan-Kansas City. However, on or about August 26, 2009, American Eagle inaugurated subsidy-free regional jet service from Dallas-Fort Worth to Manhattan. American Eagle provides two daily nonstop round trips in the Manhattan-Dallas-Fort Worth market with 50-seat Embraer ERJ-145 regional jets on a subsidy-free basis. That level of service fully meets Manhattan&#x27;s EAS requirements, so, consistent with longstanding program practice, we will simply rely on American Eagle&#x27;s subsidy-free service and not request proposals. Despite not receiving an EAS subsidy, Manhattan will remain in the EAS program, and, should American Eagle subsequently decide to file a notice to leave, the department would initiate a carrier-replacement proceeding by issuing an order holding in American Eagle and requesting proposals for replacement service from all interested carriers.

<text>Robert Alfred Hardcastle Collier, 3rd Baron of Monkswell (13 December 1875 – 14 January 1964), known as Robert Collier before 1909, was a British aristocrat and writer on railways.

He joined the Diplomatic Service, and in April 1902 was appointed Third Secretary.

Collier succeeded to the barony in 1909 on the death of the 2nd Baron Monkswell, his father. He was one of 112 peers (known as the &quot;diehards&quot;) to vote against the Parliament Act 1911 in the House of Lords.

Ezra Pound accused Lord Monkswell of displaying arrogance in his faith in capitalism, in an article he penned for &quot;The Globe&quot; in its last issue of 1919. Monkswell is quoted as writing there, &quot;A man without any tools can produce nothing&quot; to which Pound replied, in &quot;The New Age&quot; Vol. 26 #12, January 22, 1920, &quot;Loophole being that one can make poems out of mere words, and that many have done so; but lacking speech one can say nothing&quot;.

During the General Strike of 1926, Lord Monkswell worked as a signalman at Marylebone Railway Station.

&quot;Jouett&quot; was laid down on 7 March 1911 by Bath Iron Works, Ltd., Bath, Maine; launched on 15 April 1912; sponsored by Miss Marylee Nally; and commissioned at Boston, Massachusetts on 24 May 1912, Lieutenant Commander W. P. Cronan in command.

==Pre-World War I==
&quot;Jouett&quot; joined the Atlantic Fleet Torpedo Flotilla and operated off the East Coast until early 1914, when events in Mexico threatened American interests and officials at Tampico arrested American sailors without cause. &quot;Jouett&quot; supported the landing of Marines at Veracruz on 21 April 1914. Returning to the East Coast after this operation, the destroyer continued to carry out training maneuvers until the United States entered World War I in April 1917.

==World War I==
The ship was assigned patrol in Delaware Bay in April 1917 and remained on that duty until sailing from New York on 8 August as an escort for five troopships bound for France. After returning from Europe, &quot;Jouett&quot; resumed patrolling until she arrived at New London, Connecticut, on 15 January 1918 for experimentation with antisubmarine detection devices. Completing this duty on 4 June, the ship operated until the armistice with a special anti-submarine group along the East Coast of the United States.

==Inter-war period==
Following the war, &quot;Jouett&quot; conducted training exercises and fleet maneuvers until entering Philadelphia Navy Yard on 20 July 1919. She decommissioned on 24 November and remained inactive until being loaned to the Coast Guard on 23 April 1924 for use as a cutter. Returned to the Navy on 22 May 1931, she was sold for scrap to Michael Flynn Inc, Brooklyn, New York.

<doc id="1337260" wikidata="Q2082184" url="?curid=1337260" title="Exessive case">
<text>The exessive case (abbreviated ) is a grammatical case that denotes a transition away from a state. It is a rare case found in certain dialects of Baltic-Finnic languages. It completes the series of &quot;to/in/from a state&quot; series consisting of the translative case, the essive case and the exessive case.

The exessive case has been described in Estonian, South Estonian, Livonian, Votic, Ingrian, Ludic, Karelian, and Finnish.

==Estonian==
In the general pattern of the loss of a final vowel when compared to Finnish, the Estonian exessive ending is &quot;-nt&quot;.

Exessive case is unproductive in contemporary Estonian. It appears in words such as &quot;kodunt&quot; &#x27;away from home&#x27; and &quot;tagant&quot; &#x27;from behind&#x27;, or South Estonian &quot;mant&quot; &#x27;away from the vicinity of something&#x27;. The exessive is more common in the language of Estonian folk songs.

==Finnish==
The exessive is found only in Savo and southeastern dialects. Its ending is &quot;-nta/ntä&quot;. For example, &quot;tärähtäneentä terveeksi&quot; = &quot;from loony to healthy&quot;, or a state change from mental illness to mental health.

There are some word forms in Finnish dialects in which the exessive appears in a locative sense. These are somewhat common, though nonstandard, for example &quot;takaanta&quot;/&quot;takanta&quot; (from behind, standard Finnish &quot;takaa&quot;), &quot;siintä&quot; (from that/it or thence, standard Finnish &quot;siitä&quot;).

<doc id="1337267" wikidata="Q6986619" url="?curid=1337267" title="Needle time">
<text>Needle time was created in the United Kingdom by the Musicians&#x27; Union and Phonographic Performance Limited to restrict the amount of recorded music that could be transmitted by the BBC during any 24-hour period. The number of hours per week allowed gradually increased over the years from below 30 hours in the 1950s. Until 1967 the BBC was allowed to play only five hours per day of commercial gramophone records on the air. It continued to affect BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 2 and the Independent Local Radio stations until 1988.

The result was that the BBC had to use &quot;cover&quot; versions of popular songs by groups such as Shane Fenton and the Fentones recorded at the BBC studios, or orchestral versions by one of the in-house orchestras, to fill in the hours.

The term &quot;needle time&quot; comes from the use (at the time) of gramophone records as the main source of recorded music, which were played on gramophone record players using a gramophone needle.

==Needle time notice==
British records at the time carried a warning message around the edge of the record label in the centre of the record itself to the effect that: &quot;Unauthorised public performance or broadcasting of this record is strictly prohibited.&quot; 

===Radio Luxembourg===
Although the record industry in Britain wanted the public to buy its records, it had to give them some airtime so that the public could find out about their existence. To that end the record industry used the commercial nighttime signals from Radio Luxembourg whose powerful AM signal could be heard in the UK. The &quot;208&quot; shows on Luxembourg were mainly fifteen minutes to thirty minutes in length and presented under names such as the &quot;Decca Records Show&quot; or the &quot;Capitol Records Show&quot;. These prerecorded programmes resembled what later became known as infomercials, because they normally only featured a little over half of the record, with heavy plugging for title, artist and label.

Because all the hours of transmission were booked up by the major record companies (EMI, Decca, Pye, Philips etc.) groups and artists had to sign to them to get any exposure. This was one of the driving forces for Ronan O&#x27;Rahilly and others to start the first pirate radio station to get exposure for artists he represented.

===The &quot;pirate stations&quot;===
Unlike the BBC or Radio Luxembourg, the offshore pirate radio stations of the 1960s operated not only outside the three-mile limit of territorial waters, but also in a grey area of the law. Because the studios and transmitters were located on board the ships or offshore structures, the personnel on board were only under the authority of the captain of that ship or structure. In the case of ship stations such as Wonderful Radio London which introduced top 40 radio to Britain, the ship was registered in a foreign country and therefore subject to the laws of that country, which did not recognise &quot;needle time&quot;. Payola operated on several of these stations.

<text>FinTS (Financial Transaction Services), formerly known as HBCI (Home Banking Computer Interface), is a bank-independent protocol for online banking, developed and used by German banks.

HBCI was originally designed by Germany&#x27;s three banking &quot;pillar&quot; networks, namely the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe, German Cooperative Financial Group, and Association of German Banks. The result of this effort was an open protocol specification, which is publicly available. The standardisation effort was necessary to replace the huge number of deprecated homemade software clients and servers (some of them still using BTX emulation).
While IFX (Interactive Financial Exchange), OFX (Open Financial Exchange) and SET (Secure Electronic Transaction) are tailored for the North American market, HBCI is designed to meet the requirements of the European market.

The FinTS-specification is publicly available on a website run by the ZKA (Central Credit Committee).

==Features==
* Support for online-banking using PIN/TAN one time passwords.
* Support for online-banking with SWIFT.
* DES and RSA encryption and signatures.
* Making use of XML and SOAP for data-exchange, encryption and signatures.
* Implemented on top of HTTP, HTTPS and SMTP as communication layer.
* Multibanking: The software clients are designed to support accounts on multiple banking companies.
* Platform Independence: The specification allows software development for various types of clients.
* Storage of the encryption keys on an external physical device (smart card) for improved security.
* Possibility to use so called &quot;Secoder&quot; smart card readers to allow the user to cross check the transaction data on a secure device before signing it to uncover manipulations caused by malware. To use Secoder, the bank as well as the home banking software have to support the Secoder protocol extension of FinTS.

HBCI has been superseded by its successor FinTS, and as of 2011, 2000 financial institutions in Germany are supporting FinTS.

==Versions==
=== HBCI 2.2 PIN/TAN ===
HBCI 2.2 PIN/TAN (or HBCI+) is an extension to HBCI that added a security method based on PINs and TANs, which had already been in use with BTX and web banking.

=== FinTS 3.0 ===
For version 3.0, which formally introduced the PIN/TAN method, the specification was renamed to FinTS, whereas the original DSA- and RSA-based security method retained the name HBCI.

=== FinTS 4.0 ===
In version 4.0, the basic message syntax was switched over to XML. Further, the number of roundtrips necessary was reduced, allowing asynchronous communication (e.g. via SMTP) for simple transaction dialogues.

<text>Sir Edward Augustus Bond (31 December 18152 January 1898) was an English librarian.

==Biography==
Bond was born at Hanwell, London, England, the son of a schoolmaster. He was educated at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School, Northwood, and in 1832 obtained a post in the Public Record Office. In 1838, he became an assistant in the manuscript department of the British Museum, where he attracted the notice of his chief, Sir Frederic Madden, a leading paleographer of his day, and in 1852 he was made Egerton librarian. In 1856, he became assistant keeper of manuscripts, and in 1867 was promoted to the post of keeper.

His work in reorganising the manuscript department was of lasting value, and to him is due the classified catalogue of manuscripts, and the improved efficiency and punctuality of publication of the department. In 1873, he was appointed principal librarian of the British Museum. Under his supervision, the new buildings of the White Wing were erected, to accommodate prints, drawings, manuscripts and newspapers. The purchase of the Stowe manuscripts was concluded while he was in office. He founded, in conjunction with Sir Edward Maunde Thompson, the Palaeographical Society, and made scientific improvements to classical palaeography.

He was made LL.D. of Cambridge in 1879, created CB in 1885, and KCB the day before his death in January 1898.

Bond published little, but he was the editor of four volumes of facsimiles of Anglo-Saxon charters from 679 to the Conquest, &quot;The Speeches in the Trial of Warren Hastings&quot; (1859–1861), and a number of other historic documents. These included &quot;Chronica Monasterii de Melsa...&quot; (3 vols, 1866–8), the 14th-century chronicles of Meaux Abbey.

He married Caroline Frances Barham (22 July 18231 August 1912), second daughter of the Reverend Richard Harris Dalton Barham.

<doc id="1337282" wikidata="Q625948" url="?curid=1337282" title="Topological property">
<text>In topology and related areas of mathematics, a topological property or topological invariant is a property of a topological space that is invariant under homeomorphisms. Alternatively, a topological property is a proper class of topological spaces which is closed under homeomorphisms. That is, a property of spaces is a topological property if whenever a space &quot;X&quot; possesses that property every space homeomorphic to &quot;X&quot; possesses that property. Informally, a topological property is a property of the space that can be expressed using open sets. 

A common problem in topology is to decide whether two topological spaces are homeomorphic or not. To prove that two spaces are &quot;not&quot; homeomorphic, it is sufficient to find a topological property which is not shared by them.

==Properties of topological properties==

A property formula_1 is:
* Hereditary, if for every topological space formula_2 and subset formula_3 the subspace formula_4 has property formula_5
* Weakly hereditary, if for every topological space formula_2 and closed subset formula_3 the subspace formula_4 has property formula_5

== Common topological properties ==

=== Cardinal functions ===

* The cardinality formula_10 of the space formula_11.
* The cardinality formula_12 of the topology (the set of open subsets) of the space formula_11.
* &quot;Weight&quot; formula_14, the least cardinality of a basis of the topology of the space formula_11.
* &quot;Density&quot; formula_16, the least cardinality of a subset of formula_11 whose closure is formula_11.

=== Separation ===

Some of these terms are defined differently in older mathematical literature; see history of the separation axioms.

* T0 or Kolmogorov. A space is Kolmogorov if for every pair of distinct points &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in the space, there is at least either an open set containing &quot;x&quot; but not &quot;y&quot;, or an open set containing &quot;y&quot; but not &quot;x&quot;.
* T1 or Fréchet. A space is Fréchet if for every pair of distinct points &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in the space, there is an open set containing &quot;x&quot; but not &quot;y&quot;. (Compare with T0; here, we are allowed to specify which point will be contained in the open set.) Equivalently, a space is T1 if all its singletons are closed. T1 spaces are always T0.
* Sober. A space is sober if every irreducible closed set &quot;C&quot; has a unique generic point &quot;p&quot;. In other words, if &quot;C&quot; is not the (possibly nondisjoint) union of two smaller closed non-empty subsets, then there is a &quot;p&quot; such that the closure of {&quot;p&quot;} equals &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;p&quot; is the only point with this property.
* T2 or Hausdorff. A space is Hausdorff if every two distinct points have disjoint neighbourhoods. T2 spaces are always T1.
* T2½ or Urysohn. A space is Urysohn if every two distinct points have disjoint &quot;closed&quot; neighbourhoods. T2½ spaces are always T2.
* Completely T2 or completely Hausdorff. A space is completely T2 if every two distinct points are separated by a function. Every completely Hausdorff space is Urysohn.
* Regular. A space is regular if whenever &quot;C&quot; is a closed set and &quot;p&quot; is a point not in &quot;C&quot;, then &quot;C&quot; and &quot;p&quot; have disjoint neighbourhoods.
* T3 or Regular Hausdorff. A space is regular Hausdorff if it is a regular T0 space. (A regular space is Hausdorff if and only if it is T0, so the terminology is consistent.)
* Completely regular. A space is completely regular if whenever &quot;C&quot; is a closed set and &quot;p&quot; is a point not in &quot;C&quot;, then &quot;C&quot; and {&quot;p&quot;} are separated by a function.
* T3½, Tychonoff, Completely regular Hausdorff or Completely T3. A Tychonoff space is a completely regular T0 space. (A completely regular space is Hausdorff if and only if it is T0, so the terminology is consistent.) Tychonoff spaces are always regular Hausdorff.
* Normal. A space is normal if any two disjoint closed sets have disjoint neighbourhoods. Normal spaces admit partitions of unity.
* T4 or Normal Hausdorff. A normal space is Hausdorff if and only if it is T1. Normal Hausdorff spaces are always Tychonoff.
* Completely normal. A space is completely normal if any two separated sets have disjoint neighbourhoods.
* T5 or Completely normal Hausdorff. A completely normal space is Hausdorff if and only if it is T1. Completely normal Hausdorff spaces are always normal Hausdorff.
* Perfectly normal. A space is perfectly normal if any two disjoint closed sets are precisely separated by a function. A perfectly normal space must also be completely normal.
* T6 or Perfectly normal Hausdorff, or perfectly T4. A space is perfectly normal Hausdorff, if it is both perfectly normal and T1. A perfectly normal Hausdorff space must also be completely normal Hausdorff.
* Discrete space. A space is discrete if all of its points are completely isolated, i.e. if any subset is open.
* Number of isolated points. The number of isolated points of a topological space.

=== Countability conditions ===

* Separable. A space is separable if it has a countable dense subset.
* First-countable. A space is first-countable if every point has a countable local base.
* Second-countable. A space is second-countable if it has a countable base for its topology. Second-countable spaces are always separable, first-countable and Lindelöf.
* Lindelöf. A space is Lindelöf if every open cover has a countable subcover.
* &quot;σ&quot;-compact. A space is σ-compact if it is the union of countably many compact subspaces.

=== Connectedness ===
* Connected. A space is connected if it is not the union of a pair of disjoint non-empty open sets. Equivalently, a space is connected if the only clopen sets are the empty set and itself.
* Locally connected. A space is locally connected if every point has a local base consisting of connected sets.
* Totally disconnected. A space is totally disconnected if it has no connected subset with more than one point.
* Path-connected. A space &quot;X&quot; is path-connected if for every two points &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; in &quot;X&quot;, there is a path &quot;p&quot; from &quot;x&quot; to &quot;y&quot;, i.e., a continuous map &quot;p&quot;: [0,1] → &quot;X&quot; with &quot;p&quot;(0) = &quot;x&quot; and &quot;p&quot;(1) = &quot;y&quot;. Path-connected spaces are always connected.
* Locally path-connected. A space is locally path-connected if every point has a local base consisting of path-connected sets. A locally path-connected space is connected if and only if it is path-connected.
* Arc-connected. A space &quot;X&quot; is arc-connected if for every two points &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; in &quot;X&quot;, there is an arc &quot;f&quot; from &quot;x&quot; to &quot;y&quot;, i.e., an injective continuous map formula_19 with formula_20 and formula_21. Arc-connected spaces are path-connected.
* Simply connected. A space &quot;X&quot; is simply connected if it is path-connected and every continuous map formula_22 is homotopic to a constant map.
*Locally simply connected. A space &quot;X&quot; is locally simply connected if every point &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; has a local base of neighborhoods &quot;U&quot; that is simply connected.
*Semi-locally simply connected. A space &quot;X&quot; is semi-locally simply connected if every point has a local base of neighborhoods &quot;U&quot; such that &quot;every&quot; loop in &quot;U&quot; is contractible in &quot;X&quot;. Semi-local simple connectivity, a strictly weaker condition than local simple connectivity, is a necessary condition for the existence of a universal cover.
* Contractible. A space &quot;X&quot; is contractible if the identity map on &quot;X&quot; is homotopic to a constant map. Contractible spaces are always simply connected.
* Hyperconnected. A space is hyperconnected if no two non-empty open sets are disjoint. Every hyperconnected space is connected.
* Ultraconnected. A space is ultraconnected if no two non-empty closed sets are disjoint. Every ultraconnected space is path-connected.
* Indiscrete or trivial. A space is indiscrete if the only open sets are the empty set and itself. Such a space is said to have the trivial topology.

=== Compactness ===
* Compact. A space is compact if every open cover has a finite &quot;subcover&quot;. Some authors call these spaces quasicompact and reserve compact for Hausdorff spaces where every open cover has finite subcover. Compact spaces are always Lindelöf and paracompact. Compact Hausdorff spaces are therefore normal.
* Sequentially compact. A space is sequentially compact if every sequence has a convergent subsequence.
* Countably compact. A space is countably compact if every countable open cover has a finite subcover.
* Pseudocompact. A space is pseudocompact if every continuous real-valued function on the space is bounded.
* σ-compact. A space is σ-compact if it is the union of countably many compact subsets.
* Lindelöf. A space is Lindelöf if every open cover has a countable subcover.
* Paracompact. A space is paracompact if every open cover has an open locally finite refinement. Paracompact Hausdorff spaces are normal.
* Locally compact. A space is locally compact if every point has a local base consisting of compact neighbourhoods. Slightly different definitions are also used. Locally compact Hausdorff spaces are always Tychonoff.
* Ultraconnected compact. In an ultra-connected compact space &quot;X&quot; every open cover must contain &quot;X&quot; itself. Non-empty ultra-connected compact spaces have a largest proper open subset called a monolith.

=== Metrizability ===
* Metrizable. A space is metrizable if it is homeomorphic to a metric space. Metrizable spaces are always Hausdorff and paracompact (and hence normal and Tychonoff), and first-countable. Moreover, a topological space formula_23 is said to be metrizable if there exists a metric for formula_11 such that the metric topology formula_25 is identical with the topology formula_26
* Polish. A space is called Polish if it is metrizable with a separable and complete metric.
* Locally metrizable. A space is locally metrizable if every point has a metrizable neighbourhood.

=== Miscellaneous ===
* Baire space. A space &quot;X&quot; is a Baire space if it is not meagre in itself. Equivalently, &quot;X&quot; is a Baire space if the intersection of countably many dense open sets is dense.
* Door space. A topological space is a door space if every subset is open or closed (or both). 
* Topological Homogeneity. A space &quot;X&quot; is (topologically) homogeneous if for every &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in &quot;X&quot; there is a homeomorphism formula_27 such that formula_28 Intuitively speaking, this means that the space looks the same at every point. All topological groups are homogeneous.
* Finitely generated or Alexandrov. A space &quot;X&quot; is Alexandrov if arbitrary intersections of open sets in &quot;X&quot; are open, or equivalently if arbitrary unions of closed sets are closed. These are precisely the finitely generated members of the category of topological spaces and continuous maps.
* Zero-dimensional. A space is zero-dimensional if it has a base of clopen sets. These are precisely the spaces with a small inductive dimension of &quot;0&quot;.
* Almost discrete. A space is almost discrete if every open set is closed (hence clopen). The almost discrete spaces are precisely the finitely generated zero-dimensional spaces.
* Boolean. A space is Boolean if it is zero-dimensional, compact and Hausdorff (equivalently, totally disconnected, compact and Hausdorff). These are precisely the spaces that are homeomorphic to the Stone spaces of Boolean algebras.
* Reidemeister torsion
* formula_29-resolvable. A space is said to be κ-resolvable (respectively: almost κ-resolvable) if it contains κ dense sets that are pairwise disjoint (respectively: almost disjoint over the ideal of nowhere dense subsets). If the space is not formula_29-resolvable then it is called formula_29-irresolvable.
* Maximally resolvable. Space formula_11 is maximally resolvable if it is formula_33-resolvable, where formula_34 Number formula_33 is called dispersion character of formula_36
* Strongly discrete. Set formula_37 is strongly discrete subset of the space formula_11 if the points in formula_37 may be separated by pairwise disjoint neighborhoods. Space formula_11 is said to be strongly discrete if every non-isolated point of formula_11 is the accumulation point of some strongly discrete set.

== Non-topological properties ==
There are many examples of properties of metric spaces, etc, which are not topological properties. To show a property formula_1 is not topological, it is sufficient to find two homeomorphic topological spaces formula_43 such that formula_11 has formula_1, but formula_46 does not have formula_1.

For example, the metric space properties of boundedness and completeness are not topological properties. Let formula_48 and formula_49 be metric spaces with the standard metric. Then, formula_43 via the homeomorphism formula_51. However, formula_11 is complete but not bounded, while formula_46 is bounded but not complete.

<text>Field Marshal Sir Patrick Grant, (11 September 1804 – 28 March 1895) was a senior Indian Army officer. He fought at the Battle of Maharajpore during the Gwalior campaign, at the Battle of Mudki, the Battle of Ferozeshah and the Battle of Sobraon during the First Anglo-Sikh War and at the Battle of Chillianwala and the Battle of Gujrat during the Second Anglo-Sikh War. During the Indian Mutiny, as acting Commander-in-Chief, India, he directed the operations against the mutineers, sending forces under Henry Havelock and James Outram for the relief of Cawnpore and Lucknow. He later became Governor of Malta.

==Military career==
Born at Auchterblair, near Carrbridge, Inverness-shire, Grant was the second son of Major John Grant of the 97th Regiment of Foot and Anna Trapaud Grant. He joined the Bengal Native Infantry as an ensign on 16 July 1820 and was promoted to lieutenant on 11 July 1823 and to captain on 14 May 1832. He became a brigade major in Oudh in 1834 and, having raised the Hariana Light Infantry in 1836, he became second assistant in the adjutant-general&#x27;s department of the Bengal Presidency in 1838.

Grant served under Sir Hugh Gough as deputy assistant adjutant-general at the Battle of Maharajpore in December 1843 during the Gwalior campaign. Promoted to brevet major on 30 April 1844, he served as acting adjutant-general of the army at the Battle of Mudki in December 1845 (where he was twice wounded), at the Battle of Ferozeshah also in December 1845 and at the Battle of Sobraon in February 1846 during the First Anglo-Sikh War. He became deputy adjutant-general of the Bengal Army in March 1846 and was promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel on 3 April 1846.

Grant also took part in the Battle of Chillianwala in January 1849 and the Battle of Gujrat in February 1849 during the Second Anglo-Sikh War. He later served under Sir Charles Napier in operations against the Pathan tribes in Kohat in 1850. Appointed aide-de-camp to the Queen and promoted to brevet colonel on 2 August 1850, he was further promoted to brevet major-general on 28 November 1854 before becoming commander-in-chief of the Madras Army with the local rank of lieutenant-general on 25 January 1856.

When General George Anson died of cholera on his march against the mutineers in May 1857, Grant, as senior commander in India, was summoned to Calcutta to become acting Commander-in-Chief, India. From Calcutta he directed the operations against the mutineers, sending forces under Henry Havelock and James Outram for the relief of Cawnpore and Lucknow. Although the Viceroy of India, Lord Canning, had recommended that Grant be confirmed in the role of commander-in-chief, Sir Colin Campbell had already been nominated as Anson&#x27;s successor. So on the arrival of Campbell from England in August 1857, Grant returned to command the Madras Army again.

Grant returned to England in January 1861 and was promoted to the substantive rank of colonel on 14 November 1861 and to lieutenant-general on 24 October 1862. In February 1864 he was appointed to a Royal Commission formed to inquire into the best mode of realizing the value of booty of war. He became Governor of Malta in 1867 and was promoted to full general on 19 November 1870.

Grant was also colonel of the 104th Regiment of Foot, of the 78th (Highlanders) Regiment of Foot and then of the Royal Horse Guards. He was placed on the retired list on 1 October 1877 and promoted to field marshal on 24 June 1883.

Grant also served as governor of the Royal Hospital Chelsea from February 1874 until his death there on 28 March 1895. He is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London. A memorial plaque to Grant can be found in Duthil Old Parish Church and Churchyard, just outside the village of Duthil, Inverness-shire, which now also serves as a Clan Grant Centre.

==Honours==
Grant&#x27;s honours included:
*Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) – 1 March 1861 (KCB – 2 January 1857; CB – 3 April 1846)
*Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) – January 1868

==Family==
In 1832, Grant married Jane Anne Fraser-Tytler, daughter of William Fraser-Tytler; they had two sons. Following the death of his first wife, he married secondly the Hon. Frances Maria Gough, daughter of Field Marshal Hugh Gough, 1st Viscount Gough, in 1844; they had five children (four sons, including Sir Henry, and a daughter Frances). 

His granddaughter Isabel Frances Grant was a notable historian and collector.

<doc id="1337292" wikidata="Q4290774" url="?curid=1337292" title="USS Jenkins (DD-42)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Jenkins&quot; (DD-42) was a modified in the United States Navy during World War I. She was named for Rear Admiral Thornton A. Jenkins.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Jenkins&quot; was laid down on 24 March 1911 by Bath Iron Works at Bath, Maine. She was launched on 29 April 1912, sponsored by Miss Alice Jenkins, daughter of Rear Admiral Thornton A. Jenkins, and commissioned on 15 June 1912.

==Pre-World War I==
In the years that preceded World War I, &quot;Jenkins&quot;, based at Newport, Rhode Island, trained with the United States Atlantic Fleet, steaming to the Caribbean for winter maneuvers and operating along the United States East Coast in summer. In addition, she steamed to Tampico, Mexico, in mid-April 1914 to support the American occupation of Veracruz. On 1 October 1916 she collided with the lighter &quot;Trilby&quot; at Sandwich, Massachusetts, that resulted in damage to &quot;Trilby&quot;.

==World War I==
As the war raged in Europe, &quot;Jenkins&quot; continued patrol operations along the North American coast in search of possible German U-boats. The patrols and maneuvers sharpened her war-readiness, so that she was ready for any eventuality when she sailed for Europe on 26 May 1917.

Based at Queenstown, Ireland, &quot;Jenkins&quot; and her sister destroyers patrolled the eastern Atlantic, escorting convoys and rescuing survivors of sunken merchant ships. She continued escort and patrol duty for the duration of the war. Though she made several submarine contacts, no results were determined.

On 16 January 1918, &quot;Jenkins&quot; and the destroyer were escorting the American armed passenger ship SS &quot;New York&quot; in the Irish Sea during a voyage to Liverpool, England. As darkness fell at around 18:00, &quot;Jenkins&quot; took station astern of &quot;New York&quot; while &quot;Shaw&quot; continued to patrol ahead. At about 19:30, the U.S. Navy gun crews manning &quot;New York&quot;′s forward guns sighted a suspicious object on her port beam, and they fired seven rounds at it. &quot;New York&quot; swung slightly to starboard, and the guns received orders to cease firing. Meanwhile, &quot;New York&quot;′s after gun crew sighted &quot;Jenkins&quot; on &quot;New York&quot;′s starboard quarter. Believing &quot;Jenkins&quot; still to be astern of &quot;New York&quot; and not realizing that &quot;New York&quot;′s swing to starboard had placed &quot;Jenkins&quot; on her starboard quarter, the after gun fired one shot. It hit &quot;Jenkins&quot;, killing one man and wounding four. &quot;Jenkins&quot; immediately turned on her running lights, and &quot;New York&quot; ceased fire.

Following the signing of the Armistice with Germany on 11 November 1918, &quot;Jenkins&quot; sailed for the United States, arriving at Boston, Massachusetts, on 3 January 1919.

==Inter-war period==
&quot;Jenkins&quot; operated along the U.S. East Coast until arriving at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 20 July 1919. She remained there until decommissioning on 31 October 1919. While in reserve, she received hull classification symbol DD-42 when the U.S. Navy adopted its modern hull classification system on 17 July 1920.

&quot;Jenkins&quot; never returned to active service. She was scrapped in 1935 in accordance with the London Naval Treaty.

==Notable commander officers==
*Lieutenant Commander Frederick V. McNair Jr., recipient of Medal of Honor, commanded &quot;Jenkins&quot; in 1914.
*Commander Henry D. Cooke, who received the Navy Cross as commanding officer of the destroyer , commanded &quot;Jenkins&quot; from August 1917 to January 1918.
*Lieutenant Commander James L. Kauffman received the Navy Cross for service as commanding officer of &quot;Jenkins&quot; during World War I.

<text>Bruce Graham Trigger (June 18, 1937 – December 1, 2006) was a Canadian archaeologist, anthropologist, and ethnohistorian. He was appointed the James McGill Professor at McGill University in 2001.

==Life==
Born in Preston, Ontario (now part of Cambridge), Trigger obtained his undergraduate education at the University of Toronto earning a B.A. in anthropology in 1959.
Trigger received a doctorate in archaeology from Yale University in 1964. He was taught by George Peter Murdock and Benjamin Irving Rouse. He was co-supervised by William Kelly Simpson and Michael D. Coe. He became friends with K. C. Chang, a Chinese archaeologist, who joined the department during his final year of his PhD at Yale. His doctoral work was funded by a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship Award. His PhD thesis, entitled &quot;History and Settlement of Lower Nubia,&quot; argued that four principle parameters determined the density of Nubia over 4,000 years: the height of floods, agricultural techniques, foreign trade and wars. He spent the following year teaching at Northwestern University and subsequently took a position as assistant professor, with the Department of Anthropology at McGill University in Montreal, and remained there for the rest of his career. He was married to Dr Barbara Welch, a British geographer trained in Physical Geography, who, despite being less-known than her husband, was considered an equally sophisticated thinker.

Pamela Jane Smith writes in her obituary of Bruce Trigger that &quot;It is little known outside Canada that Bruce had a deep and profound influence on the development of archaeology in his homeland and is seen as one of the great Canadian intellectuals along with Harold Innis, Northrop Frye and Marshall McLuhan.&quot;

==Contributions==
Bruce Trigger contributed to a wide range of fields and wrote on many aspects of archaeology. He published over 20 books including the book &quot;A History of Archaeological Thought&quot; which became required reading in the discipline. Leo Klejn (2008:4, (Lev Samuilovich Klejn, known as Leo Klejn, who was an internationally acclaimed Russian archaeologist) who corresponded with him for a considerable period of time wrote of him &quot;Since then I always felt (and said) that if there were another archaeologist in the world whose positions were the most similar to mine, it would be Bruce Trigger.&quot; Klejn described (2008:4) Bruce and his contributions after his death as: &quot;Today no other scholar is able to skillfully embrace the whole multifaceted range of activities of this modest and calm man. There must have been something unique about his spirit or personality that inspired and equipped him to deal creatively with American Indians, Ancient Egypt, world civilizations and the theory and history of archaeology, and it is interesting to try to understand some of the principles underlying his explorations of these very different themes.&quot; The topics of his thirteen PhD students (in order R. F. Williamson (1979); Alexander D. Von Gernet (1982); Robert J. Pearce (1984); Peter A Timmons (1984); Brian D. Deller (1988); Gary Warrick (1990); William R. Fitzgerald (1990); Frances L. Stewart (1997); Eldon Yellowhorn (2002); Robert I. McDonald (2002); Stephen Chrisomalis (2003); Jerimy Cunningham (2005) and Alicia Colson (2006) reflect his wide ranging interests. He co-supervised two PhD candidates with Fumiko Ikawa-Smith and Robin D. S. Yates (Katrinka Reinhardt 1997) and with Colin Scott (Audra Simpson 2003) . 

===Archaeological fieldwork===
While Trigger studied for his doctoral degree at Yale he was also the Chief Archaeologist for the 1962 Yale/Pennsylvania excavations at Armina
West in Egyptian Nubia. These excavations were directed by William Kelly Simpson. Bruce was also the Staff Archaeologist with the 1963-1964 Oriental Institute Sudan Expedition for the UNESCO campaign. 

===Ethnohistory===
In Canada, he was arguably best known for &quot;The Children of Aataentsic&quot;, his two-volume study of the Huron peoples, a work which remains the definitive study on the history and ethnography of that people. &quot;The Children of Aataentsic&quot; earned Trigger numerous accolades, including adoption by the Huron-Wendat Nation as an honorary member. Trigger would later reiterate some of the key arguments of the book in &quot;Natives and Newcomers&quot;, a polemical work aimed at educating laypeople. In &quot;Natives and Newcomers&quot; Trigger, writing in the tradition of Franz Boas, argued that the colonial and Aboriginal societies of early Canada all possessed rich and complex social and cultural systems, and that there are no grounds to argue that any society of early Canada was superior to the others.

===History of archaeology===
Trigger&#x27;s book &quot;A History of Archaeological Thought&quot; investigates the history of the development of theory and archaeology as a discipline. The first version was published by Cambridge University Press in 1989. This book was described as &quot;the first ever to examine the history of archaeological thought from medieval times to the present in world-wide perspective&quot; A second and expanded edition of this book was published in 2006. The second book &quot;introduces new archaeological perspectives and concerns. At once stimulating and even-handed, it places the development of archaeological thought and theory throughout within a broad social and intellectual framework.&quot;

He published a number of articles on this topic:

* Trigger, Bruce Graham 1981 Anglo-American Archaeology &quot;World Archaeology&quot; 13(2: Regional traditions of archaeological research 1): 138–155.
* Trigger, Bruce Graham 1983 American Archaeology as Native History: A Review Essay. &quot;The William and Mary Quarterly&quot; 40(3): 413–452.
* Trigger, Bruce Graham 1984 Archaeology at the Crossroads: What&#x27;s New? &quot;Annual Review of Anthropology&quot; 13: 275–300.

* Trigger, Bruce Graham 1986 Prospects for a World Archaeology. &quot;World Archaeology&quot; 18(1) Perspectives in World Archaeology: 1–20.
* Trigger, Bruce Graham 1994 Ethnicity: An Appropriate Concept for Archaeology. &quot;Fennoscandia Archaeologica&quot; XI: 100–103.
* Trigger, Bruce Graham 1995 Expanding Middle Range Theory. &quot;Antiquity&quot; 69: 449–458.
* Trigger, Bruce Graham 1998 ‘The Loss of Innocence’ in Historical Perspective. &quot;Antiquity&quot; 72(277): 694–698.

===Archaeological theory===
In &quot;Understanding Early Civilizations: A Comparative Study&quot; Trigger uses an integrated theoretical approach to look at the meaning of similarities and differences in the formation of complex societies in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, Shang of China, Aztecs and Classic Maya of Mesoamerica, Inka of the Andes, and Yoruba of Africa. In 2004 a session at the Society for American Archaeology (SAA) conference was dedicated to the research of Bruce Trigger.

Trigger also made significant contributions to theory and debates on epistemological issues within archaeology. The 2003 book &quot;Artifacts and Ideas&quot; is a collection of previously published papers that trace the history and development of these contributions.

In particular were his arguments about how the social and political contexts of research affect archaeological interpretation. One essay entitled &quot;Archaeology and the Image of the American Indian&quot; documents how archaeological interpretation reflected and legitimated stereotypes of Native American peoples and expressed the dominant political ideas and interests of Euro-American culture. For example, prior to 1914 Euro-American stereotypes resulted in a prehistory that saw native cultures as being primitive and inherently static. It was commonly believed that Native Americans had not undergone any significant developmental changes and that they were incapable of change. It was believed that natives had arrived in the Americas only recently, and this &quot;fact&quot; explained their alleged lack of cultural development. Some early Euro-American archaeologists explained away the contrary evidence of earthwork mounds as the creations of &quot;more enlightened&quot; non-native peoples who had been exterminated by Native American savages. These popular beliefs, supported by the claims of early archaeologists, served to legitimate the displacement of native peoples from their homelands. John Wesley Powell, who led the debunking of the mound builder myths, not coincidentally also recognized that great injustices had been perpetuated against Native American peoples. Although Trigger recognized that Euro-American political interests tended to influence and distort interpretations of the archaeological record, he also argued that the accumulation of evidence served to correct these distortions.

==Honours and awards==
He received a number of academic awards and numerous other honours such as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada from 1976, he became a recipient of their Innis-Gérin Medal in 1985. In 1979 he was awarded the Cornplanter Medal. In 1991, he was recipient of the Québec Government&#x27;s Prix Léon-Gérin. The Québec Government in 2001 made him an Officer of the National Order of Quebec while five years later, in 2005, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

His most cherished honour was his adoption in 1989 into the Great Turtle Clan of the Wendat (Huron) Confederacy, with the name Nyemea.

Trigger died of cancer on December 1, 2006. His archive is kept at the McGill University Archives.

<text>Hilda is one of several feminine given names derived from the name &quot;Hild&quot;, formed from Old Norse , meaning &#x27;battle&#x27;. Hild, a Nordic-German Bellona, was a Valkyrie who conveyed fallen warriors to Valhalla. Warfare was often called Hild&#x27;s Game. Hilda of Whitby was an early Christian saint.

Hylda is a spelling variant. Hilde is a variant of Hilda. Another variation on &quot;Hild&quot; is Hildur. Hildy is an English nickname. Ildikó is a Hungarian form of the name. Related names include Brunhilde, Brynhild, Hildebrand, Hildegard, Gunhild, Krimhild, and Mathilde.
==Cultural influences==
The name became rare in England during the later Middle Ages, but was revived in the 19th century. Several English-language popular 19th century novelists used the name Hilda for their heroines. Hilda Scarve was the romantic heroine of the 1842 novel &quot;The Miser&#x27;s Daughter&quot; by William Harrison Ainsworth. Nathaniel Hawthorne used the name Hilda for the innocent art student heroine of his 1860 novel &quot;The Marble Faun&quot;. Hilda Van Gleck is a wealthy girl in Mary Mapes Dodge’s 1865 children’s novel &quot;Hans Brinker or the Silver Skates&quot;. The hero wants to impress Hilda by winning a race. &quot;Hilda Wade&quot; by author Grant Allen was published in 1900. In the crime fiction novel, heroine Hilda refuses to marry a man unless he helps solve the murder of her father. 

More recent cultural influences include the Netflix animated series &quot;Hilda&quot;, which aired from 2018 to 2023, and characters in the 2013 video game &quot;The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds&quot; and the 2022 video game &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="1337315" wikidata="Q2141352" url="?curid=1337315" title="Dirt track racing">
<text>Dirt track racing is a form of motorsport held on clay or dirt surfaced banked oval racetracks. Dirt track racing started in the United States before World War I and became widespread during the 1920s and 1930s using both automobiles and motorcycles, spreading throughout Japan and often running on horse racing tracks. There are a myriad of types of race cars used, from open wheel Sprint cars and Modifieds to stock cars. While open wheel race cars are purpose-built racing vehicles, stock cars (also known as fendered cars) can be either purpose-built race cars or street vehicles that have been modified to varying degrees. There are hundreds of local and regional racetracks throughout the United States and also throughout Japan. The sport is also popular in Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the United Kingdom.

==Racetrack==
A dirt track&#x27;s racing surface may be composed of any soil, although most seasoned dirt racers probably consider a moist, properly prepared clay oval their favorite dirt racing surface. Preparing a dirt track correctly for racing is both a traditional learned craft as well as a long and complex job requiring hours of work. Typical machines used in track preparation include a grader, a cultivator or rototiller, 2 types of rollers and a watering truck, although the process varies at different dirt tracks around the world.
After an event, a track&#x27;s rutted surface is first graded and smoothed back into the contours of the track&#x27;s layout. then further smooth and tamp loose soil shoveled into any soft spots. The freshly smoothed track surface is then aerated with a cultivator or rototiller to loosen the now-compacted upper layer and assist with greater water penetration for a moister track on race day. Watering is repeated as necessary according to climate, location and soil composition. Using offset boom nozzles to on water trucks will avoid mashing aerated soil. A dirt track should be rolled and watered as required on race morning with a final light watering, just prior to wheel-packing. Outdoor dirt tracks are typically aerated 12&quot; deep.

===North America===

Nearly all tracks are oval and less than in length with most being or less. The most common increments in the U.S. are , , , , and . With the longer tracks, the race cars achieve higher speeds up to and the intervals between cars increase. This decreases the chance of crashes but increases the damage and chance of injury when cars do crash.

===United Kingdom===
In Great Britain the oval tracks are normally on grass with lengths of 400 meters (¼ mile) to 800 meters (½ mile). The races consist of several four lap qualifying heats that eliminate slower drivers. Then there is a final race featuring the fastest competitors.

===Europe===
In mainland Europe, long tracks can be grass, sand or cinder, and can be up to long.

===Australia===
Dirt track racing in Australia has a history dating back to the 1920s and 1930s. Most oval track speedways are similar to those in the US for car racing such as sprint cars, speedcars (midgets) and sedans, with most tracks generally around in length. Most tracks have a clay surface, though some use dolomite, dolomite and clay mix or even sand and clay mix. During the 1970s and early 1980s, a small number of tracks were paved with asphalt, though this phase only lasted about a decade and all tracks paved over eventually reverted to their former surfaces.

==Race vehicles==

Each racetrack or sponsoring organization maintains a rule book outlining each class of race car which includes dimensions, engine size, equipment requirements and prohibitions. The requirements for each class are usually coordinated with multiple tracks to allow for the widest available venue for each type of car. This coordination allows the drivers to compete at many different racetracks, increase competitors&#x27; chances of winning, and lets racing associations develop a series of race events that promote fan interest.

Many tracks support two types of racing in their programs, open wheel cars and stock cars. Both types range from large and powerful V8 engines to small yet still powerful, four-cylinder engines. Some of the smaller open wheel race cars have classes for single-cylinder engines. Depending on the class, the cars may have wings to aid in handling at higher speeds.

===Open wheel cars===
Open wheel cars are generally manufactured with tubular frames and a body purchased for that particular class. The wheels of these vehicles are not protected by fenders; they are exposed or &quot;open&quot;.

Classes include:
*Dwarf (5/8 replicas of 1928 to 1948 coupes and sedans)
*Mod lite - 1000-1250cc motorcycle engines (5/8 replicas of full size modified but equally as fast)
*Kart (go kart)
*Mini sprint- 600-1200cc motorcycle engines. Usually utilize a top wing.
*Winged sprint- 410ci, 360ci engine, or 305ci engines. The top wing helps these fast and powerful racecars with downforce.
*Non-wing sprint car
*Silver crown
*Midget (speedcar)
*Three quarter midget (TQ)
*Quarter midget
*600 and 270 micro sprints

Open wheel sanctioning bodies include:
*USAC - The United States Automobile Club
*World of Outlaws Sprint Cars (410ci engine national touring series)
*All Star Circuit of Champions (410ci engine upper Midwest, mid-Atlantic and Atlantic touring series)
*High Limit Sprint Car Series (410ci sprint car series)
*American Sprint Car Series (ASCS) (360ci engine national touring series)
*United Sprint Car Series (USCS) (360ci engine mid south and south touring series)
*MOWA (410ci engine Midwest touring series)
*POWRi (midgets and mini sprints)

Popular chassis manufacturers around the country for winged sprint cars are Eagle, Maxim, J&amp;J, Triple X, and GF1. There are also several engine builders that build both 410ci and 360ci engines for traveling sprint car teams. Speedway, Kistler, Gaerte, Wesmar, Shaver, Don Ott Racing Engines, and Fisher Racing Engines are the more popular engine builders.

===Modified cars===
Modified cars are a hybrid of open wheel cars and stock cars. This class of car has the racing characteristics of a stock car. The rear wheels are covered by fenders, but the front wheels are left exposed. There are sanctioning bodies that control the rules for this class at most tracks. Each sanctioning body has their own set of guidelines provided in an annual rule book and their own registration fees. Sanctioning bodies include:
*Super DIRTcar Series
*IMCA (International Motor Contest Association)
*UMP (United Midwestern Promoters)
*USRA (United States Racing Association)
*USMTS (United States Modified Touring Series)
*WISSOTA (WISSOTA Promoters&#x27; Association)
*TSMA (Tri-State Modified Association)

===Full-bodied cars===
Full-bodied cars, sometimes referred to as stock cars, are vehicles that, unlike open-wheel cars, have fenders covering all wheels. Full-bodied cars can vary from full tube frame chassis and aluminum bodied late models to automobiles manufactured by the major automakers with certain modifications as allowed for each class. There are several general types:

==== Modified production cars ====

These cars are modified manufactured automobiles. There is a high degree of variability between classes of modified cars. The lowest divisions of modified production cars may be completely stock except for having their interior or windshields removed. The highest divisions of modified production cars may have only a few original stock parts and may be nearly as fast as late model race cars. Most cars have their glass windshields removed and their interiors stripped out. The original seat may be allowed to be used in the lowest classes, but a racing seat and roll cage is required to be installed in higher divisions. Other safety and performance features are added to higher division cars. The engines in lower divisions are completely stock, and higher divisions are highly modified and enhanced. Most modified production cars use full exhaust systems. Engines vary from unmodified 4 cylinders to highly modified V8. Cars in lower divisions use stock tires, and higher division cars use purpose-built specified racing tires.

Common names of modified production car divisions:

*Limited late model (604 crate LM)
*602/sportsman (A-hobby/cadet/super street)
*Pony/mini stocks (4-cyl.)
*FWD front wheel drives (stingers/hot shots/hornets) BJP Racing or B&amp;J Performance is among the highest ranking 4cyl race cars in the country 
*Bombers (hobby/thunder/outlaw stock/pure stock)
*Cruisers (Road warriors/renegades) 
*Legends/mod lites (dwarfs) 
===== &quot;Pure Stock&quot; =====
These are Full-bodied cars with very few changes allowed from the factory models sold for general use on the streets. Changes can be limited to a certain type of tire, making some parts of the car stronger to withstand the punishment of racing and so forth. All cars used on the race track are required to have a full set of Roll Cages and safety harnesses to protect the drivers. Some tracks have what they call Hornets which are smaller unibody cars with 4-cylinder engines, that must be pretty much as they left the factory except for the roll cage. These would also be considered Pure Stock, but not full sized.

===== &quot;Street Stock&quot; =====
These are also Full-bodied cars but can have changes to the frame, engines, tires and some changes to the suspension. They have to have bodies shaped like the actual cars that are used on the street direct from the factory. As with the Pure Stocks cars, all are required to have a full set of Roll Cages and safety harnesses to protect the drivers.

===== &quot;Super Stock&quot; =====
Super Stock cars are very similar to Late Models and can be built from the ground up by the racers. They have limited engines and other restricted items that keep them from being full blown Late Models, but they are much more powerful than the Street Stocks and are an intermediate class between Street Stock, Modifieds and Late Models. The bodies are aftermarket or made by the racers in the general shape of the brand being represented (Chevrolet, Ford, Dodge, etc.).

==== &quot;Unmodified production cars&quot; ====
These cars are automobiles just as driven on the street; including the original interiors. The engines may be modified as allowed under different rules: Saloon

===== Non-production cars =====
These are stock cars custom built for racing, usually with welded tubular frames and custom built or purchased bodies.

The most popular type of dirt full-bodied stock cars are late models. They are categorized depending on what track and series that is being run. The racetrack dictates what type of late model is raced, but most fall into one of these categories:

====== &quot;Late model&quot; ======
Current dirt super late models feature steel constructed tube frame chassis with aluminum bodies that give them the sleek aerodynamic appearance of a stock race car but there is nothing stock about these 2300 pound machines. The cars are powered by an motor than can turn in excess of 9,000 rpm. The engines are based on V-8 Chevrolet, Chrysler, and Ford power plants. These cars are considered to be the most sophisticated cars in dirt racing. They hit speeds well over and slide around the dirt corners. They are raced on dirt tracks throughout the country anywhere from 1/5 to one mile.

The expense for these cars is significant. The cost for one complete race-ready late model is around $70,000. There is also cheaper equipment and parts that can be purchased, but staying competitive is much more expensive. To get the frame (chassis) and parts all new without the transmission and motor is around 20,000 to 30,000 dollars depending on the quality and from which manufacturer the chassis comes. The top manufacturers around the country include Rocket, Sweet-Bloomquist, Club 29, Longhorn, MB Customs, Black Diamond Racecars, GRT, Warrior, Barry Wright Racecars, Rayburn, MasterSbilt, Kryptonite, Domination chassis, and Schwartz Race Cars. The engines for these cars are around 850 horsepower and can cost up to 40,000 dollars. Motor builders include Hatfield Racing, Jay Dickens Racing Engines, Durham Racing Engines, Cornett Racing Engines, Sheered Engine Development, Gaerte Racing Engines, Clements Racing Engines, Custom Racing Engines, Vic Hill Racing Engines and Pro Power Engines.

Most racing series and special events offer different motor options with the use of different total vehicle weights to create an even playing field:
* Open motor - there is no displacement limit with this type of motor. Most open motors exceed 400 cubic inches but the 380 small block is also a common open motor. These motors utilize aluminium blocks and heads and often have specially welded cams. The cars which run this motor option must weigh at least . Cars utilizing a steel block must weigh 2300 lb. 
* Spec motor- spec motors are built to the series&#x27; specifications. The motor can be either steel, aluminium or a combination. Spec motors typically cannot exceed . Cars using this motor option weigh in at and run a spoiler. 
* All steel motor - steel block and heads, a maximum of , and weigh in at either 2200 or 2150 pounds depending on the series. Cars with an all-steel motor must run a spoiler.

====== &quot;Limited late model&quot; ======
Limited late models and late model stocks have the same body rules as super late models. The main difference in the two classes is the motor rules. Engine limitations typically include maximum engine displacement size, certain required cylinder head angles, maximum compression ratios, and maximum carburetor size. Suspension rules typically forbid the use of expensive canister shocks. Tire choice is also typically limited to a certain tire such as the Hoosier D55 spec tire.

====== &quot;Late model stock&quot; ======
Late model stocks have the same body rules as super late models and limited late models. This class typically has even more limited engine rules.

Typical late model stock engine requirements:
* Chevrolet 350, Chrysler 360, Ford 351 engines. Must be all-steel except intake manifold.
* Engine maximum displacement of .
* Engines typically cannot be modified except for aftermarket carburetor, intake manifold and exhaust manifold.

Many different tracks and sanctioning bodies have variations on these rules of what constitutes an open late model, limited late model and a late model stock.

====== &quot;Crate late models&quot; ======

Crate late models use Chevrolet small-block engine engines that have been sealed with a special tag. Typical motors include the GM 602 and GM 604 engines. Recently the GM CT525 crate has been a popular choice of racers and some after-market Ford motors have surfaced in competition. Crate engines are sealed at the intake manifold, cylinder head, front cover, and oil pan with special twist off bolts. Crate engines must not be altered, modified, or changed in any way from factory specifications.

Crate late models have three primarily Southern region touring series: the Durrence Layne Dirt Late Model Series, the United Crate Racing Alliance and the Fastrak Crate Late Model Series.

====== &quot;Popular late model racing series&quot; ======
* World of Outlaws Late Model Series
*Lucas Oil Late Model Dirt Series
*Southern All Star Racing Series (SAS)
*Southern Nationals/Spring Nationals
*International Motor Contest Association (IMCA)
*United Crate Racing Alliance (UCRA)
*United Midwestern Promoters (UMP)
*Mid America Racing Series (MARS)
*Midwest Late Model Racing Association (MLRA)
*United Late Model Association (ULMA)

There are hundreds of additional unsanctioned regional and national special events run throughout the year.

===Motorcycles===

Dirt and grass track bikes have capacities of 250, 350, 500 and in the solo classes and can reach speeds of up to on the straights and with no brakes fitted to the machine. The American Grand National dirt track championship uses motorcycles of up to 750 cc capacities and can reach speeds of up to .

There are three sidecar classes. The continental class has a 500 cc single-cylinder engine, also in Great Britain there are left- and right-handed sidecar machines with the engines up to 1000 cc. Sidecar races are some of the most exciting in Grass Track sport, with the driver and passenger working together to obtain the best grip and speed around the corners.

===Vintage racing===
Many obsolete race vehicles that were left in barns to rust are being restored to their former glory. The restored race vehicles are being displayed at car shows and sometimes raced. Cars that compete in vintage racing events are from the late 19th century to historic cars from a few years ago. There are more than 170 racing events in North America, and thousands of other vintage events sanctioned by hundreds of clubs.

==Race program==

The typical race program usually involves a number of classes, and many tracks offer both open wheel and stock car racing. There are a wide variety of event formats.

=== Hot laps (warm up or practice) ===
These races are 2-5 laps for drivers to get an understanding of the track conditions and the set up of their race cars. They are at the very start of the night before qualifying and the heat races.

===Qualifying===
A qualifying session happens before the start of the event. The Lucas Oil Dirt Late Model Series and the World of Outlaw Late Models use the qualifying system to line up their heat races. They give each driver 2 timed laps to get their times. This system is also used to line up the big crown jewel events. For most of the regional series they use the method called the &quot;pill draw.&quot; Before the races each driver draws a number and that determines where they start in their heat race. Recently the innovation of Transponder Scoring has brought dirt track racing into the internet immediate post &quot;live&quot; scoring and timing of events (Race Monitor).

===Heat races===
Preliminary races for each class, called heat races, frequently open the schedule. The heat races may determine the starting race position in the main events and usually earn season championship points. The heat races are shorter than the feature races, and not as many cars race in each heat, from 8 to 12 laps for a heat race. There are numerous formats for qualifying for the feature event.

In a race where they qualify to determine their starting position for the heat race they use a &quot;heads up&quot; system. This system is where there is a predetermined set of cars that go to the A feature from the heat race, usually either the top 3 or 4.

In a race where they use the pill draw to line up the heat races they use a method called passing points. In this system a driver receives a set number of points for where they finish, 1st-59 2nd-57 and so forth the lower they finish. To add to the points the driver gets for finishing, the driver also gets 1.5 points for each car they pass. They will then usually take the top 16 drivers with the highest total number of points and line up the A feature.

===Semi-feature/B main/last chance showdown===
There may be a semi-feature where unqualified racers may race their way into the remaining open starting positions in the A feature event. This race is called the last chance qualifier or B feature. The cars who did not make the A feature through the heat race or qualifying session get one more chance to qualify for the A feature through the B feature. The B length is anywhere up to circa 20 laps. Depending on how many B&#x27;s there are determines how many transfer to the A, anywhere up to circa 6 will transfer. If a driver transfers through the B, they will start behind the drivers who made it through the heats / qualifying position.

At selected other races with a larger car count, there may be more &quot;alphabet soup&quot; features (C, D, E, F, etc.). In those cases the drivers in the lower feature race will race with a certain number who advances to the next higher feature (e.g. top two in the F advance to the E, etc.).

===Feature/A main===
The A feature or main feature race is held for each division. The top cars from the event compete in the race. The starting positions may be determined by the season&#x27;s point standings, or by a combination of the heat/qualifying speed/trophy dash/semi-feature finishing positions. It is usually the longest race in the program and depending upon the division it may range from 10 laps to 50 laps. Points, a trophy, and frequently a purse are generally awarded, with the amount of each is determined by finishing position. The winner of the feature event is considered the winner of the event.

===Special events===
Many tracks have special events which tends to draw a larger crowd. Occasionally, a track will sponsor a &quot;powder-puff&quot; race to allow women the opportunity to drive racecars for a few laps of racing. Otherwise, woman racers may compete in the same events as the men.

Many tracks contract with a National and/or Regional touring racing association to schedule a sanctioned event. The racers in these events earn points for ranking within the series and sometimes the tracks points. The associations also usually require a guaranteed purse from the tracks of sanctioned events.

Some tracks also have a &quot;run-what-you-brung&quot; contest usually toward the beginning of the season. Spectator racing pits two drivers from the stands who, after signing waivers, can run their personal automobiles against each other in a one-on-one 1 or 2 lap shootout.

Dirt tracks tend to be somewhat more makeshift and more versatile than asphalt pavements, and can be converted for use in other motorsports. For instance, Little Valley Speedway in Little Valley, New York is a half-mile dirt track that can be converted into a figure 8 track, a demolition derby pit, or a tractor pull straightaway.

==Championships==
Both the racetracks and the racing associations award championships as determined by the guidelines of the associated rulebooks. Awards, usually for the top ten racers in each class, may include a trophy, a jacket, and a monetary amount.

Track championships are awarded according to the points earned during the season. A certain number of points may be awarded for participation in an event and additional points added depending on the finish position in each race. The points earned at one track do not generally count toward another track&#x27;s championship.

At dirt tracks sanctioned by NASCAR, drivers can compete against drivers from other NASCAR-sanctioned tracks, both paved and dirt, for the statewide and provincial Whelen All-American Series championship, where the best performer of the state and provincial champions will win the national championship. All Dirt late model drivers won NASCAR&#x27;s first such championship in 1982, and these drivers have frequently won regional and national championships in the 30-year history of NASCAR&#x27;s short track championship, which only applies for local racing divisions (non-touring).

The racing associations count points earned at the tracks for certain sponsored races similarly. Additionally they may promote the appearances of their drivers and winners at various other events.

<doc id="1337327" wikidata="Q1103796" url="?curid=1337327" title="Vernal pool">
<text>Vernal pools, also called vernal ponds or ephemeral pools, are seasonal pools of water that provide habitat for distinctive plants and animals. They are considered to be a distinctive type of wetland usually devoid of fish, and thus allow the safe development of natal amphibian and insect species unable to withstand competition or predation by fish. Certain tropical fish lineages (such as killifishes) have however adapted to this habitat specifically.

Vernal pools are a type of wetland. They can be surrounded by many communities/species including deciduous forest, grassland, lodgepole pine forest, blue oak woodland, sagebrush steppe, succulent coastal scrub and prairie. These pools are characteristic of Mediterranean climates, but occur in many other ecosystems.

==Generation and annual development==

During most years, a vernal pool basin will experience inundation from rain/precipitation, followed by desiccation from evapotranspiration. These conditions are commonly associated with Mediterranean climate such as the Central Valley of California. Vernal pool basins are often characteristics of Mediterranean climates, but occur in many other ecosystems, such as forested areas of the Canadian Shield, where they are difficult to identify because of the forest canopy. Most pools are dry for at least part of the year, and fill with the winter rains, spring snowmelts and rising water tables. Some pools may remain at least partially filled with water over the course of a year or more, but all vernal pools dry up periodically. Typically, though, a vernal pool has three phases each year: it is inundated in the winter (inundated phase) with the vernal pool holding onto the water from 10–65 days, it dries slowly during the spring (flowering phase), and it dries completely during the summer (dry phase). Vernal pools favor native species because many non-native species cannot tolerate the extreme seasonal changes in environmental conditions.

Some vernal pools have an underlying impermeable clay layer (also known as a hardpan) that reduces water percolation. The impermeable layer is hydrophobic and it prevents water from draining into lower soil layers, allowing vernal pools to become inundated for a very long period of time. This feature of vernal pools means that the water is allowed to slowly evaporate instead of draining. This is a key factor in the development of vernal pool plant communities as it keeps the soil at the water&#x27;s edge just wet enough for vernal plant communities to flourish while those closer to the center of the pool are more inundated, leading to zonation of plant communities as the water level recedes. This clay layer also allows pools to exist long enough to prevent upland species from developing, while existing for just enough time to prevent aquatic plant species from taking over.

Some authorities restrict the definition of vernal pools to exclude seasonal wetlands that have defined inlet and outlet channels. The justification is that such seasonal wetlands tend to be qualitatively different from isolated vernal pools; this is because they are fed by larger drainage basins so that firstly, inflow contributes higher concentrations of dissolved minerals. Secondly, flow patterns increase the periodic scouring and silting effect of flows through or simply into the wetland. Thirdly, longer distance inflow and outflow make for less strictly endemic populations and plants. Low dissolved mineral concentrations of smaller vernal pool basins may be characterized as oligotrophic, and poorly buffered with rapid pH shifts due to carbon dioxide uptake during photosynthesis.

Vernal pools are so called because they are often, though not necessarily, at their maximum depth in the spring (&quot;vernal&quot; meaning of, relating to, or occurring in the spring). There are many local names for such pools, depending upon the part of the world in which they occur. Vernal pools may form in forest, but they are more typically associated with grassland and rocky plains or basins. While many vernal pools are only a few meters in width, playas and prairie potholes are usually much larger, but still are otherwise similar in many respects, with high water in wet periods, followed by dry conditions. Some exclude desert playas from the definition of vernal pools because their larger closed drainage basins in areas with high evaporation rates produce higher concentrations of dissolved minerals, with salinity and alkalinity favoring different species. Playas may be inundated less frequently than vernal pools, and inundation typically coincides with colder weather unfavorable for plant growth.

==Ecology==
Despite being dry at times, vernal pools teem with life when filled, serving as critical breeding grounds for many amphibian and invertebrate species. The most obvious inhabitants are various species of breeding frogs and toads. Some salamanders also utilize vernal pools for reproduction, but the adults may visit the pool only briefly. Other notable inhabitants are &quot;Daphnia&quot; and fairy shrimp, the latter often used as an indicator species to decisively define a vernal pool. Other indicator species, at least in New England, are the wood frog, the spadefoot toad, and some species of mole salamanders. 

While vernal pools can be devoid of fish, in some habitats such as African Savannah vernal pools, killifish may, due to their ability of their eggs to survive desiccation, co-exist with their branchiopod crustacean prey which utilize the same strategy to survive dry periods. Some killifish mature in only three to six weeks in order to make the most use of temporary pools before they disappear.

Some of the species within vernal pools are endangered. Fairy shrimp are crustaceans in the family Branchinectidae. It takes about 30 hours for them to start to hatch in water and it takes 50 days for them to mature. In springtime, the eggs hatch and they can go dormant. There are different types of fairy shrimp in different vernal pools because the pools can act like islands because they are so isolated.

Certain plant species are also associated with vernal pools, although the particular species depend upon the ecological region. The flora of South African vernal pools, for example, are different from those of Californian vernal pools, and they have characteristic Anostraca, such as various &quot;Branchipodopsis&quot; species. In some northern areas, tadpole shrimp are more common. Some vernal pool inhabitants are becoming threatened due to habitat loss. One of these inhabitants is the California Tiger Salamander.

== Habitat loss ==

Vernal pools harbor a distinct assemblage of flora and fauna that, in some cases, aren&#x27;t found anywhere else on the planet. Despite this fact, about 90% of vernal pool ecosystems in California have been destroyed. Disturbingly, much of this destruction has occurred in recent years, with about 13% of remaining vernal pools being lost in the short interval from 1995–2005. The major threats to vernal pool habitats in the Central Valley are agriculture, urbanization, changes in hydrology, climate change, and improperly managed grazing by livestock. They are sensitive to climate and land-use change.

=== Restoration ===
Vernal pools are prime habitats to be targeted for restoration work due to their value as hotspots of biodiversity as well as recent history of extensive destruction and degradation. However, there have been varying rates of success attributed to various restoration efforts. Several hypotheses have attempted to explain this:
: Hypothesis 1: Constructed pools are too deep.
: Hypothesis 2: Edges of constructed pools narrower than natural ones.
: Hypothesis 3: Constructed pools have steeper slopes than natural ones.

Results: Research suggest that the last two details (Hypothesis 2 &amp; 3) are crucial in determining the habitat value of man-made vernal pools. In general, most constructed pools were too steep and did not have wide enough edges.

=== Mitigation ===
There has been a fair amount of controversy surrounding the practice of mitigation, which is the destruction of protected or endangered species and habitats, such as vernal pools, on the condition that whatever entity (business, land manager, etc.) is destroying the habitat will undertake the construction of a replacement habitat to &quot;mitigate&quot; their impacts. This concept is difficult to apply to vernal pools, which represent a tremendous habitat value—but are difficult to successfully replicate using construction methods (as mentioned above). Thus, it has been very controversial to apply mitigation strategies to vernal pool systems due to the obvious risks inherent in trying to reconstruct this kind of habitat. Some agencies, however, are now requiring two replacements for every vernal pool that is destroyed to compensate for the lower quality of human-made habitat.

==Soils==
Vernal pools can form anywhere that a depression fills with rainwater, leading to low nutrients and low levels of dissolved salts. They are underlain with an impermeable layer of claypan, hardpan, or volcanic rock allowing for water retention. In many instances they contain grasslands that form over a variety of soil types containing silts and clays often covered by a layer of interwoven fibrous roots and dead leaves. The soil types present tend to relate to the local soil types and hydrology of the pool. Finer soils such as clay, silt, and muck are more common in perched situations, whereas pools which are more connected to the water table have more coarse soils like sand or gravel. Soils in vernal pools often reflect their inundated conditions, leading to low chroma horizons, mottling, and anoxic decay. They can develop hydric soils which are typical of flooded areas, including accumulations of organic matter, but this may not happen in drier areas. In some cases there is a hard pan layer which causes the retention of water in the pools. The hardpan clay basin accumulates water due to the small particle size and therefore reduced porosity. This permits flooding and development of vernal pools.

==Flora==

In vernal pools, flowering occurs simultaneously because of the seasonality of favorable conditions. Vernal pool ecosystems may include both cosmopolitan species and endemic species adapted to unique environmental conditions. These conditions include moisture gradients, salinity gradients, and reduced levels of competition. Microtopographical gradients also contribute to species distribution in vernal pool communities, where plants that flower sooner in the season are more likely to be found at slightly higher elevations than later flowering species. Many vernal pool plants have buried seeds which accumulate in the soil. Different species are suited to different moisture levels, and as water evaporates from the edges of a pool, distinctive zonation of species can be seen. Most pools receive annual deposition of tree leaves, which are critical to maintaining local life due to leaf detritus.

Many upland perennial plants are unable to withstand the period of flooding. Many wetland plants are unable to withstand the period of desiccation. Therefore, vernal pools are a distinctive habitat that provides a refuge from both terrestrial and fully aquatic plants. When dissolved carbon dioxide is depleted by daytime photosynthesis, vernal pool species like Howell&#x27;s quillwort (&quot;Isoetes howellii&quot;) and pygmyweed (&quot;Crassula aquatica&quot;) collect carbon dioxide nocturnally using Crassulacean acid metabolism. Vernal pool basin habitats favor annual plants with some uniquely adapted perennials which suffer extensive mortality resembling annual reproduction. Annuals comprise approximately 80 percent of vernal pool flora. Listed below are some genera of the approximately one hundred vascular plant species associated with California vernal pool habitats. A typical pool will include only 15 to 25 species.

Upland plants commonly found at vernal pools in California include yellow pansies, several sweet-scented clovers, yellow and bright lavender monkeyflowers, star lilies, and yarrow.

Vernal pools are often threatened by development in the same way that other wetlands are. As a result, most pools have been converted into residential zones, roads, and industrial parks. That is why most extant pools occur on protected or private land such as national parks, and ranches.

A large number of rare, endangered species, and endemic species occur in vernal pool areas. For example, the San Diego mesa mint, a highly endangered plant, is found exclusively in vernal pools in the San Diego area. Another example is the wildflower &quot;Lasthenia conjugens&quot;, which is found in limited parts of the San Francisco Bay Area. A third example is the herb &quot;Limnanthes vinculans&quot; endemic to Sonoma County, California.

==Fauna==

Many amphibians that breed only in vernal pools spend most of their lives in the uplands within hundreds of feet of the vernal pool. Eggs are laid in the vernal pool, then the juveniles leave the pool two or three months later, not to return until the following spring to breed. Therefore, the upland areas surrounding a vernal pool are critical for the survival of these species. In California and New York state, the endangered tiger salamander (&quot;Ambystoma tigrinum&quot;) is dependent on vernal pools to breed as described above. A few other obligate vernal pool species are the marbled salamander (&quot;Ambystoma opacum&quot;), Jefferson&#x27;s salamander (&quot;Ambystoma jeffersonianum&quot;), the blue-spotted salamander (&quot;Ambystoma laterale&quot;) and the spotted salamander (&quot;Ambystoma maculatum&quot;).

Some other species, notably Anostraca, fairy shrimp, and their relatives, lay eggs capable of entering a state of cryptobiosis. They hatch when rains replenish the water of the pool, and no stage of the animals&#x27; life cycle leaves the pool, except when eggs are accidentally transported by animal phoresis, wind, or rarely, by flood. Such animal populations can be ancient when the conditions for seasonal vernal waters are stable enough. As an extreme example, &quot;Branchipodopsis relictus&quot; on the main island of the Socotra archipelago, which is exceedingly remote for what it is, a continental fragment of Gondwana, is believed to have been isolated since the Miocene. &quot;Branchipodopsis relictus&quot; is correspondingly isolated genetically as well as geographically.

Vernal pools can serve as a temporary habitat for migrating birds, especially in California. The rich invertebrate population in these pools provides food for ducks, herons, egrets, plovers, and many other species.

<text>Taite (called &quot;Ta&#x27;idu&quot; in Assyrian sources) was one of the capitals of the Mitanni Empire. Its exact location is still unknown, although it is speculated to be in the Khabur region. The site of Tall Al-Hamidiya has recently been proposed as the location of ancient Taite. Tell Farfara and the Anatolian site of Üçtepe Höyük has also been suggested, among others. It has also been proposed that there two settlements name Ta&#x27;idu in the region.

During the Fall of the Mitanni Empire, the conquering Assyrian ruler Adad-Nirari (1307–1275 BC or 1295–1263 BC) slaughtered the inhabitants. He sowed the grounds with salt. He later reports restoring the capital city Taidu.

<doc id="1337332" wikidata="Q4817678" url="?curid=1337332" title="History of the Jews in Latin America and the Caribbean">
<text>The history of the Jews in Latin America began with conversos who joined the Spanish and Portuguese expeditions to the continents. The Alhambra Decree of 1492 led to the mass conversion of Spain&#x27;s Jews to Catholicism and the expulsion of those who refused to do so. However, the vast majority of conversos never made it to the New World and remained in Spain slowly assimilating to the dominant Catholic culture. This was due to the requirement by Spain&#x27;s Blood Statutes to provide written documentation of Old Christian lineage to travel to the New World.
However, the first Jews came with the first expedition of Christopher Columbus, including Rodrigo de Triana and Luis De Torres.

However, throughout the 15th and 16th centuries a number of converso families migrated to the Netherlands, France and eventually Italy, from where they joined other expeditions to the Americas. Others migrated to England or France and accompanied their colonists as traders and merchants. By the late 16th century, fully functioning Jewish communities were founded in the Portuguese colony of Brazil, the Dutch Suriname and Curaçao; Spanish Santo Domingo, and the English colonies of Jamaica and Barbados. In addition, there were unorganized communities of Jews in Spanish and Portuguese territories where the Inquisition was active, including Colombia, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Mexico and Peru. Many in such communities were crypto-Jews, who had generally concealed their identity from the authorities.

By the mid-17th century, the largest Jewish communities in the Western Hemisphere were located in Suriname and Brazil. Several Jewish communities in the Caribbean, Central and South America flourished, particularly in those areas under Dutch and English control, which were more tolerant. More immigrants went to this region as part of the massive emigration of Jews from eastern Europe in the late 19th century. During and after World War II, many Ashkenazi Jews emigrated to South America for refuge. In the 21st century, fewer than 300,000 Jews live in Latin America. They are concentrated in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Mexico and Uruguay.

== Argentina==

Jews fleeing the Inquisition settled in Argentina, where they intermarried with native women. Portuguese traders and smugglers in the Virreinato del Río de la Plata were considered by many to be crypto-Jewish, but no community emerged after Argentina achieved independence. After 1810 (and about mid-nineteenth century), more Jews, especially from France, began to settle in Argentina. By the end of the century in Argentina, as in America, many Jewish immigrants were coming from Eastern Europe (mainly Russia and Poland) fleeing Tsarist persecution. Upon arrival they were generally called &quot;Russians&quot; in reference to their region of origin.

Jewish individuals and families emigrated from Europe to Argentina before and after World War II, in an attempt to escape the Holocaust and later postwar antisemitism. Between 250,000 and 300,000 Jews now live in Argentina, the vast majority of whom reside in the cities of Buenos Aires, Rosario, Córdoba, Mendoza, La Plata and San Miguel de Tucumán. Argentina has the third-largest Jewish community in the Americas after the United States and Canada, and the sixth largest in the world. According to recent surveys, more than a million Argentines have at least one grandparent of Jewish ethnicity. The Jewish Argentine community legally receives seven holidays per year, with both days of Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, and the first and last two days of Passover, according to the law 26,089.

== Bolivia==

Jewish presence in Bolivia started at the beginning of the Spanish colonial period. Santa Cruz de la Sierra, was founded in 1557 by Ñuflo de Chávez who was accompanied by a small group of pioneers, including several crypto-Jews from Ascuncion and Buenos Aires. The city became known as a safe haven for Jews during the Inquisition in the region.

The second wave of Conversos came to Santa Cruz de la Sierra after 1570, when the Spanish Inquisition began operating in Lima. Alleged &quot;marranos&quot; (that is, New Christians whom others rightly or wrongly suspected of crypto-Judaism), settled in Potosi, La Paz and La Plata. After they gained economic success in mining and commerce, they faced suspicion and persecution from the Inquisition and local authorities. Most of these &quot;marrano&quot; families moved to Santa Cruz de la Sierra, as it was an isolated urban settlement where the Inquisition did not bother the conversos. Most of the converso settlers were men, and many intermarried with indigenous or mestizo women, founding mixed-race or mestizo families. Conversos also settled in adjacent towns of Vallegrande, Postrervalle, Portachuelo, Terevinto, Pucara, Cotoca and others.

Many of Santa Cruz&#x27;s oldest families are of partial Jewish heritage; Some traces of Jewish culture can still be found in family traditions, as well as local customs. For example, some families have family-heirloom seven-branched candle sticks or the custom of lighting candles on Friday at sunset. The typical local dishes can be all prepared with kosher practices (none mix milk and meat, pork is served, but never mixed with other foods). Scholars disagree on provenance and recency of these practices. After almost five centuries, some of the descendants of these families claim awareness of Jewish origins, but practice Catholicism (in certain cases with some Jewish syncretism).

From independence in 1825 to the end of the 19th century, some Jewish merchants and traders (both Sephardim and Ashkenazim) immigrated to Bolivia. Most took local women as wives, founding families that eventually merged into the mainstream Catholic society. This was often the case in the eastern regions of Santa Cruz, Tarija, Beni and Pando, where these merchants came from Brazil or Argentina.

During the 20th century, substantial Jewish settlement began in Bolivia. In 1905, a group of Russian Jews, followed by Argentines, settled in Bolivia. In 1917, it was estimated that there were 20 to 25 professing Jews in the country. By 1933, when the Nazi era in Germany started, there were 30 Jewish families. The first large Jewish immigration occurred during the 1930s; the population had climbed to an estimated 8,000 at the end of 1942. During the 1940s, 2,200 Jews emigrated from Bolivia to other countries. But the ones who remained have created communities in La Paz, Cochabamba, Oruro, Santa Cruz, Sucre, Tarija and Potosí. After World War II, a small number of Polish Jews immigrated to Bolivia.

By 2006, approximately 700 Jews remained in Bolivia. There are synagogues in the cities of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, La Paz, and Cochabamba. Most Bolivian Jews live in Santa Cruz de la Sierra.

==Brazil==


Jews settled early in Brazil, especially in areas of Dutch rule. They set up a synagogue in Recife in 1636, which is considered the first synagogue in the Americas. Most of these Jews were conversos who had fled Spain and Portugal to the religious freedom of the Netherlands when the Inquisition began in Portugal in 1536. In 1656, following the Portuguese reconquest of Brazil, Jews left for the Caribbean islands and New Amsterdam under Dutch rule; the latter was taken over by the English in 1664 and was renamed as New York City.

After independence in the 19th century, Brazil attracted more Jews among its immigrants, and pressure in Europe convinced more Jews to leave. Jewish immigration rose throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, at a time of massive emigration from the Russian Empire (including Poland and Ukraine). Jewish immigration to Brazil was rather low between 1881 and 1900 although this was the height of other international immigration to Brazil; many were going to more industrialized countries. Between 1921 and 1942 worldwide immigration to Brazil fell by 21%, but Jewish immigration to Brazil increased by 57,000. This was in response to anti-immigration legislation and immigration quotas passed by the United States, Argentina, Canada and South Africa, persisting even after the crisis of Jews under the Third Reich became clear. The Brazilian government generally did not enforce its own immigration legislation. Lastly, the Jews in Brazil developed strong support structures and economic opportunities, which attracted Eastern European and Polish Jewish immigration.

Brazil has the 9th largest Jewish community in the world, about 107,329 by 2010, according to the IBGE census. The Jewish Confederation of Brazil (CONIB) estimates that there are more than 120,000 Jews in Brazil. Brazilian Jews play an active role in politics, sports, academia, trade and industry, and are well integrated in all spheres of Brazilian life. The majority of Brazilian Jews live in the state of São Paulo, but there are also sizable communities in Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Sul, Minas Gerais and Paraná.

==Chile==
Although a relatively small community amounting to no more than 1% of the country&#x27;s religious minorities, Jews in Chile have achieved prominent positions in its society. They have had key roles both before and after its independence in 1810. Most Chilean Jews today reside in Santiago and Valparaíso, but there are significant communities in the north and south of the country.

Mario Kreutzberger, otherwise known as &quot;Don Francisco&quot; and host of &quot;Sábado Gigante&quot;, the longest-running TV show in the world, is a Chilean Jew of German origin. Other Chilean Jews who have achieved recognition in arts and culture include Alejandro Jodorowsky, now established in France and best known internationally for his literary and filmic work. Others include Nissim Sharim (actor), Shlomit Baytelman (actress) and Anita Klesky (actress). Volodia Teitelboim, poet and former leader of the Chilean Communist Party, is one of the many Jews to have held important political positions in the country.

Tomás Hirsch is leader of the radical Green-Communist coalition and former presidential candidate in 2005. State ministers Karen Poniachick (Minister for Mining) and Clarisa Hardy (Minister for Social Affairs) are also Jewish. In the field of sport, tennis player Nicolás Massú (gold medalist in Athens 2004 and former top-ten in the ATP rankings) has Jewish background.

Many of the country&#x27;s most important companies, particularly in the retail and commercial field, have been set up by Jews. Examples are Calderón, Gendelman, Hites, and Pollak (commercial retailers) and Rosen (Mattress and Bed Industries).

==Colombia==
&quot;New Christians&quot;, fled the Iberian peninsula to escape persecution and seek religious freedom during the 16th and 17th centuries. It is estimated that some reached northern areas of Colombia, which at the time was known as New Granada. Most if not all of these people assimilated into Colombian society. Some continue to practice traces of Sephardic Jewish rituals as family traditions.

In the 18th century, practicing Spanish and Portuguese Jews came from Jamaica and Curaçao, where they had flourished under English and Dutch rule. These Jews started practicing their religion openly in Colombia at the end of the 18th century, although it was not officially legal to do so, given the established Catholic Church. After independence, Judaism was recognized as a legal religion. The government granted the Jews land for a cemetery.

Many Jews who came during the 18th and 19th centuries achieved prominent positions in Colombian society. Some married local women and felt they had to abandon or diminish their Jewish identity. These included author Jorge Isaacs of English Jewish ancestry, the industrialist James Martin Eder (who adopted the more Christian name of Santiago Eder when he translated his name to Spanish) born into the Latvian Jewish community, as well as the De Lima, Salazar, Espinoza, Arias, Ramirez, Perez and Lobo families of Caribbean Sephardim. Coincidentally, these persons and their families settled in the Cauca Valley region of Colombia. They have continued to be influential members of society in cities such as Cali. Over the generations most of their descendants were raised as secular Christians.

During the early part of the 20th century, numerous Sephardic Jewish immigrants came from Greece, Turkey, North Africa and Syria. Shortly after, Jewish immigrants began to arrive from Eastern Europe. A wave of immigrants came after the rise of Nazism in 1933 and the imposition of antisemitic laws and practices, including more than 7,000 German Jews. From 1939 until the end of World War II, immigration was put to a halt by anti-immigrant feelings in the country and restrictions on immigration from Germany.

Colombia asked Germans who were on the U.S. blacklist to leave and allowed Jewish refugees in the country illegally to stay. The Jewish population increased dramatically in the 1950s and 1960s, and institutions such as synagogues, schools and social clubs were established throughout the largest cities in the country.

The changing economy and wave of kidnappings during the last decade of the 20th century led many members of Colombia&#x27;s Jewish community to emigrate. Most settled in Miami and other parts of the United States. Successes in the nation&#x27;s Democratic security Policy has encouraged citizens to return; it has drastically reduced violence in the rural areas and criminality rates in urban areas, as well as in spurring the economy. The situation in Colombia has improved to the extent that many Venezuelan Jews are now seeking refuge in Colombia.

In the early 21st century, most of the Jews in Colombia are concentrated in Bogotá, with about 20,000 members, and Barranquilla, with about 7,000 members. Large communities are found in Cali and Medellín, but very few practicing Jews. Smaller communities are found in Cartagena and the island of San Andres. There are 14 official synagogues throughout the country. In Bogotá, Jews each run their own religious and cultural institutions. The Confederación de Asociaciones Judías de Colombia, located in Bogotá, is the central organization that coordinates Jews and Jewish institutions in Colombia.

In the new millennium, after years of study, a group of Colombians with Jewish ancestry formally converted to Judaism to be accepted as Jews according to the halakha.

== Costa Rica==

The first Jews in Costa Rica were probably &quot;conversos&quot;, who arrived in the 16th and 17th centuries with Spanish expeditions. In the 19th century Sephardic merchants from Curaçao, Jamaica, Panama and the Caribbean followed. They lived mostly in Central Valley, married local women, and were soon assimilated into the country&#x27;s general society. Most eventually gave up Judaism altogether.

A third wave of Jewish immigrants came before World War I and especially in the 1930s, as Ashkenazi Jews fled a Europe threatened by Nazi Germany. Most of these immigrants came from the Polish town Żelechów. The term &quot;Polacos&quot;, which was originally a slur referring to these immigrants, has come to mean door-to-door salesman in colloquial Costa Rican Spanish.

The country&#x27;s first synagogue, the Orthodox Shaarei Zion, was built in 1933 in the capital San José (it is located along 3rd Avenue and 6th Street). Along with a wave of nationalism, in the 1940s there was some antisemitism in Costa Rica, but generally there have been few problems.

Since the late 20th century there has been a fourth wave of Jewish immigration made up of American and Israeli expatriates who are retiring here or doing business in the country. The Jewish community is estimated to number 2,500 to 3,000 people, most of them living in the capital.

The San José suburb of Rohrmoser has a strong Jewish influence due to its residents. A couple of synagogues are located here, as well as a kosher deli and restaurant. The Plaza Rohrmoser shopping center had the only kosher &quot;Burger King&quot; in the country. The Centro Israelita Sionista (Zionist Israeli Center) is a large Orthodox compound where a synagogue, library and museum are located. In 2015, the Chaim Weizmann comprehensive school in San Jose had over 300 students in kindergarten, primary, and secondary grades learning in both Spanish and Hebrew.

==Cuba==

Jews have lived on the island of Cuba for centuries. Some Cubans trace Jewish ancestry to crypto-Jews, called Marranos, who fled the Spanish Inquisition. Early colonists generally married native women and few of their descendants, after centuries of residence, practice Judaism today. There was significant Jewish immigration to Cuba in the first half of the 20th century, as noted in other countries of Latin America. During this time, Beth Shalom Temple in Havana was constructed and became the most prominent Latin American Jewish synagogue. There were 15,000 Jews in Cuba in 1959, but many Jewish businessmen and professionals left Cuba for the United States after the Cuban revolution, fearing class persecution under the Communists.

In the early 1990s, &quot;Operation Cigar&quot; was launched, and in the period of five years, more than 400 Cuban Jews secretly immigrated to Israel. In February 2007 &quot;The New York Times&quot; estimated that about 1,500 Jews live in Cuba, most of them (about 1,000) in Havana. Beth Shalom Temple is an active synagogue that serves many Cuban Jews.

==Curaçao==

Curaçao has the oldest active Jewish congregation in the Americas—dating to 1651—and the oldest synagogue of the Americas, in continuous use since its completion in 1732 on the site of a previous synagogue. The Jewish community of Curaçao also played a key role in supporting early Jewish congregations in the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries, including in New York City and Newport, Rhode Island, where the Touro Synagogue was built. Growth in Latin American Jewish communities, primarily in Colombia and Venezuela, resulted from the influx of Curaçaoan Jews. In 1856 and 1902 the Jews of Coro (Venezuela) were plundered, maltreated, and driven to seek refuge in their native Curaçao.

== Dominican Republic==

Converso Merchants of Sephardic origin arrived in southern Hispaniola during the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries, fleeing the outcome of the Spanish Inquisition. Over the centuries, many Jews and their descendants assimilated into the general population and some have converted into the Catholic religion, although many of the country&#x27;s Jews still retain elements of the Sephardic culture of their ancestors. Later, in the 18th and 19th centuries, many Sephardic families from Curaçao emigrated to the Dominican Republic.

Sosua, meanwhile, is a small town close to Puerto Plata was founded by Jews fleeing the rising Nazi regime of the 1930s. Rafael Trujillo, the country&#x27;s dictator, welcomed many Jewish refugees to his island mainly for their skills rather than for religious persecution. Present-day Sosua still possesses a synagogue and a museum of Jewish history. Descendants of those Jews can still be found in many other villages and towns on the north of the island close to Sosua.

==Ecuador==

For some time, prior to the 20th century, many Jews in Ecuador were of Sephardic ancestry and some retained their use of the Judaeo-Spanish (Ladino) language. However, today, most Jewish people in Ecuador are of Ashkenazi ancestry.
Some assume that these groups were among the European settlers of Ecuador.

Many Jewish people came from Germany in 1939, on a ship called the &quot;Koenigstein&quot;. During the years 1933–43, there were a population of 2,700 Jewish immigrants. In 1939, the Jewish population, mostly German and Polish Jews, were expelled by a decree of the Italian influenced government of Alberto Enriquez Gallo. The antisemitism spread in the population, but was stopped by the intervention of the American embassy. In 1945, there was a reported population of 3,000. About 85% of them were European refugees.

The rise of Jewish immigration to Ecuador was when the Holocaust started. In 1950, there was an estimation of 4,000 persons living in Ecuador. Most of the active Jewish communities in Ecuador are from German origin. The majority of Ecuadorian Jews live in Quito and Guayaquil. There is a Jewish school in Quito. In Guayaquil, there is a Jewish Community under the auspices of Los Caminos de Israel called Nachle Emuna Congregation. Now in 2017 in Ecuador there are only 290 reported Jews in the country. 
&quot;Among the Jewish immigrants who came to Ecuador were also professionals, intellectuals and artists, some of whom were professors and writers. Other Alberto Capua, Giorgio Ottolenghi, Aldo Mugla, Francisco Breth, Hans Herman, Leopold Levy, Paul Engel, Marco Turkel, Henry Fente, Benno Weiser, Otto Glass, Egon Fellig, and Karl Kohn. Olga Fis valued and spread the Ecuadorian folk art, Constanza Capua conducted archaeological, anthropological and colonial art.

From Sephardic ancestry were Leonidas Gilces and his younger brother Angel Theodore Gilces whom helped many immigrants such as Charles Liebman who reach the capital with his library, which became the most important of the capital. Simon Goldberg who had a library in Berlin, Goethe library of old books that contributed to the dissemination of reading. Vera Kohn was a psychologist and teacher, tasks that at mid-century were not of interest of Ecuadorian women who used to live in their homes given away, devoid of intellectual curiosity and only care about social life. They were not interested in politics, with the exception of Paul Beter, belonging to the second generation of Jews, who became Minister of Economy and Central Bank President.

==El Salvador==

Alsatian-born Bernardo Haas, who came to El Salvador in 1868, was believed to be the country&#x27;s first Jewish immigrant. Another Jew, Leon Libes, was documented as the first German Jew in 1888. Sephardic families also arrived from countries such as Turkey, Egypt, Tunisia Spain and France. De Sola helped to found the first synagogue and became an invaluable member of the Jewish community. In 1936, World War II caused the Jewish community to help their ancestors escape from Europe. Some had their relatives in El Salvador. But some were forced to go into countries such as Brazil, Ecuador, Guatemala and Panama. On 30 July 1939, President Martinez barred an entry of fifty Jewish refugees going to El Salvador on the German ship &quot;Portland&quot;. On 11 September 1948, the community started and continues to support a school &quot;Colegio Estado de Israel&quot;. According to the latest Census, there are currently about 100 Jews living in El Salvador, mostly in the capital city of San Salvador. Most of them have Sephardic roots. There is a small town called Armenia in rural El Salvador where people practice Orthodox Sephardic Judaism since the inquisition.

== French Guiana ==
Jews arrived in French Guiana by the way of the Dutch West India Company. Later on 12 September 1659, Jews arrived from Dutch colonies in Brazil. The company appointed David Nassy, a Brazilian refugee, patron of an exclusive Jewish settlement on the western side of the island of Cayenne, an area called Remire or Irmire. From 1658 to 1659, Paulo Jacomo Pinto began negotiating with the Dutch authorities in Amsterdam to allow a group of Jews from Livorno, Italy to settle in the Americas. On 20 July 1600, more than 150 Sephardic Jews left Livorno (Leghorn) and settled in Cayenne. The French agreed to those terms, an exceptional policy that was not common among the French colonies. Nevertheless, nearly two-thirds of the population left for the Dutch colony of Suriname.

Over the decades, the Leghorn Jews of Cayenne immigrated to Suriname. In 1667, the remaining Jewish community was captured by the occupying British forces and moved the population to either Suriname or Barbados to work in sugarcane production. Since the late 17th century, few Jews have lived in French Guiana. In 1992, 20 Jewish families from Suriname and North Africa attempted to re-establish the community in Cayenne. A Chabad organization exists in the country and maintains Jewish life within the community. Today, 800 Jews live in French Guiana, predominately in Cayenne.

== Guatemala==
The Jews in Guatemala are mainly descendants from immigrants from Germany, Eastern Europe and the Middle East that arrived in the second half of the 19th century and first half of the 20th.

The first Jewish families arrived from the town of Kempen, Posen, Prussia (today Kepno, Poland), establishing themselves in Guatemala City and Quetzaltenango. Immigrants from the Middle East (mainly Turkey) immigrated during the first three decades of the 20th century. Many immigrated during World War II. There are approximately 900 Jews living in Guatemala today. Most live in Guatemala City. Today, the Jewish community in Guatemala is made up of Orthodox Jews, Sephardi, Eastern European and German Jews.

In 2014, numerous members of the communities Lev Tahor and Toiras Jesed, who practice a particularly austere form of Orthodox Judaism, began settling in the village of San Juan La Laguna. Mainstream Jewish communities felt concerned about the reputation following this group, who had left both the US and Canada under allegations of child abuse, underage marriage and child neglect. Despite the tropical heat, the members of the community continued to wear the long black cloaks for men and full black chador for women.

== Haiti==

When Christopher Columbus arrived in Santo Domingo, as he named it, among his crew was an interpreter, Luis de Torres, who was Jewish. Luis was one of the first Jews to settle on Santo Domingo in 1492. When the western part of the island was taken over by France in 1633, many Dutch Sephardic Jews came from Curaçao, arriving in 1634, after the Portuguese had taken over there. Others immigrated from English colonies such as Jamaica, contributing to the merchant trade. In 1683, Louis XIV banned all religions except Catholicism in the French colonies, and ordered the expulsion of Jews, but this was lightly enforced. Sephardic Jews remained in Saint-Domingue as leading officials in French trading companies. After the French Revolution instituted religious freedom in 1791, additional Jewish merchants returned to Saint-Domingue and settled in several cities. Some likely married free women of color, establishing families. In the 21st century, archaeologists discovered a synagogue of Crypto-Jews in Jérémie in the southwest area of the island. In Cap-Haïtien, Cayes and Jacmel, a few Jewish tombstones have been uncovered.

In the late eighteenth century at the time of the French Revolution, the free people of color pressed for more rights in Saint-Domingue, and a slave revolt led by Toussaint L&#x27;Ouverture broke out in 1791 in the North of the island. Slaves considered Jews to be among the white oppressor group. Through the years of warfare, many people of the Jewish community were among the whites killed; some Jews were expelled when the slaves and free blacks took power and instituted restrictions on foreign businessmen. Haiti achieved independence in 1804 but was not recognized by other nations for some time and struggled economically, based on a peasant culture producing coffee as a commodity crop. Foreigners were prohibited from owning land and subject to other restrictions. Planters and other whites were killed in 1805, and Jews were among the whites and people of color who fled to the United States, many settling in New Orleans or Charleston.

Race, as defined in slavery years, and nationality became more important in Haiti in the 19th century than religion, and Jews were considered whites and nationals of their groups. Later in the century, Polish Jews immigrated to Haiti due to the civil strife in Poland and settled in Cazale, in the North-West region of the country. Most Jews settled in port cities, where they worked as traders and merchants. In 1881 a crowd in Port-au-Prince attacked a group of Jews but was drawn back by militia men.

By the end of the 19th century, a small number of Mizrahi Jewish families immigrated to Haiti from Lebanon, Syria and Egypt; there were a higher number of Levantine Christian traders arriving at the same time. German Jews arrived with other German businessmen; they were highly acculturated and were considered part of the German community. In 1915, there were 200 Jews in Haiti. During the 20 years of American occupation, many of the Jews emigrated to the United States. The US and Haiti had joint interests in reducing the number and influence of foreign businessmen. In 1937, the government issued passports and visas to Jews of Germany and Eastern Europe, to help them escape the Nazi persecution. They retained control of any naturalization of foreigners, restricting it. During this time, 300 Jews lived on the island. Most of the Jews stayed until the late 1950s, when they moved on to the United States or Israel.

As of 2010, the number of known Jews in Haiti is estimated at 25, residing in the relatively affluent suburb of Pétion-Ville, outside Port-au-Prince.

Haiti and Israel maintain full diplomatic relations, but Israel&#x27;s nearest permanent diplomat to the region is based in neighboring Dominican Republic.

==Honduras==

During the 20th century-1980s, Jewish immigrants came to Honduras, mainly from Russia, Poland, Germany, Hungary and Romania. There were also immigration from Greece, who are of Sephardic origin and Turkey and North Africa, who are of Mizrachi origin. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, it has been absorbed a huge number of Jewish immigrants from Israel. Through the past two decades, the Honduras experienced a resurgence of Jewish life. Communities in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula grew more active. In 1998, Hurricane Mitch destroyed the synagogue, which was part of the Jewish community center in the Honduras. But the Jewish community contributed money to re-build the temple. Most Honduran Jews live in Tegucigalpa.

==Jamaica==

The history of the Jews in Jamaica predominantly dates back to the 1490s when many Jews from Portugal and Spain fled the persecution of the Holy Inquisition. When the English captured the colony of Jamaica from Spain in 1655, Jews who were living as conversos began to practice Judaism openly. In 1719, the synagogue Kahal Kadosh Neve Tsedek in Port Royal was built. By the year 1720, 18 percent of the population the capital Kingston was Jewish. For the most part, Jews practiced Orthodox rituals and customs.

A recent study has now estimated that nearly 424,000 Jamaicans are descendants of Jewish (Sephardic) immigrants to Jamaica from Portugal and Spain from 1494 to the present, either by birth or ancestry. Jewish documents, gravestones written in Hebrew and recent DNA testing have proven this. While many are non-practicing, it is recorded that over 20,000 Jamaicans religiously identify as Jews.

Common Jewish surnames in Jamaica are Abrahams, Alexander, Isaacs, Levy, Marish, Lindo, Lyon, Sangster, Myers, Da Silva, De Souza, De Cohen, De Leon, DeMercado, Barrett, Babb, Magnus, Codner, Pimentel, DeCosta, Henriques and Rodriques.

In 2006 Jamaican Jewish Heritage Center opened to celebrate of 350 years of Jews living in Jamaica. 

==Mexico==
New Christians arrived in Mexico as early as 1521. Due to the strong Catholic Church presence in Mexico, few conversos and even fewer Jews migrated there after the Spanish Conquest of Mexico.

Then, in the late 19th century, a number of German Jews settled in Mexico as a result of invitations from Maximilian I of Mexico, followed by a huge wave of Ashkenazic Jews fleeing pogroms in Russia and Eastern Europe. A second large wave of immigration occurred as the Ottoman Empire collapsed, leading many Sephardic Jews from Turkey, Morocco, and parts of France to flee. Finally, a wave of immigrants fled the increasing Nazi persecutions in Europe during World War II. According to the 2010 Census, there are 67,476 Jews in Mexico, making them the third largest Jewish community in Latin America.

Based in Cancún, they reached out to the whole Quintana Roo and Mexican Caribbean including Playa del Carmen, Cozumel, Isla Mujeres and Mérida.

In 2010 they opened a Chabad branch in Playa del Carmen to expand their activities. Rabbi Mendel Goldberg along with his wife Chaya and two daughters where assigned to direct the activities there and open a new center.

The State of Baja California has also had a Jewish presence for the last few hundred years. La Paz, Mexico was home to many Jewish traders who would dock at the port and do business. Many locals in La Paz descend from the prominent Schcolnik, Tuschman and Habiff families, although most are assimilated into Mexican life. In recent years, the tourist industry has picked up in Baja California Sur, which saw many American retirees purchase and live in properties around the Baja. In 2009, with a grassroots Jewish Community formulating and with the help of Tijuana-based businessman Jose Galicot, Chabad sent out Rabbi Benny Hershcovich and his family to run the operations of the Cabo Jewish Center, located in Los Cabos, Mexico, but providing Jewish services and assistance to Jews scattered throughout the Baja Sur region, including La Paz, Todos Santos and the East Cape.

==Nicaragua==

In the 20th century, Nicaragua&#x27;s Jewish community consisted mostly of immigrants from Eastern Europe who arrived in Nicaragua after 1929. The Jews in Nicaragua were a relatively small community, with most living in Managua. The Jews made significant contributions to Nicaragua&#x27;s economic development while dedicating themselves to farming, manufacturing and retail sales. 
It was approximated that the highest number of Jews in Nicaragua reached a peak of 250 in 1972. Some 60 Jews left the country after the 1972 earthquake that devastated Managua, it having destroyed many Jewish businesses, while others fled during the violence and unrest of the 1978-1979 Sandinista Revolution. When Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza was deposed in 1979, almost all of the remaining Nicaraguan Jews left the country, concerned about their future under the incoming socialist government.

Beginning in 1983, the Reagan administration in the U.S. made a concerted effort to increase domestic support for funding the Contras by persuading American Jews that the Sandinista government was antisemitic. According to Contra leader Edgar Chamorro, CIA officers told him of this plan in a 1983 meeting, justifying it with the antisemitic argument that Jews controlled the media and winning them over would be key to a public relations success. The Anti-Defamation League supported the Reagan administration&#x27;s charges of Sandinista antisemitism, having actively worked with Nicaraguan Jews to reclaim a synagogue that had been firebombed by Sandinista militants in 1978 and seized by the Sandinista government in 1979. However, a variety of left-wing organizations that opposed the Reagan administration&#x27;s policies in Latin America, including the progressive New Jewish Agenda, the leftist NGO the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, as well as the American Jewish Committee, all found that there was no evidence to support the U.S. charge of government antisemitism. Anthony Quainton, U.S. ambassador to Nicaragua, also reported no evidence of government antisemitism after an investigation by embassy staff. The dozens of Nicaraguan Jews who had fled the country supported the Reagan administration&#x27;s charges of antisemitism, citing several instances of intimidation, harassment, and arbitrary arrest, but two of the Jews who remained in Nicaragua denied their accuracy, and they were widely cited in the media at the time.

After Daniel Ortega lost the 1990 presidential election, Nicaraguan Jews started returning to Nicaragua. Prior to 1979 the Jewish community had no rabbi or mohel (circumcision practitioner). In 2005, the Jewish community numbered about 50 people and included 3 mohalim, but had no ordained rabbi. In 2017, there was a mass conversion of 114 Nicaraguans to Judaism.

==Panama==

=== Viceroyalty Period ===
The presence of Anusim or Crypto-Jews was recorded as early as the first migrations of Spaniards and Portuguese to the territory. Researcher and writer Elyjah Byrzdett explains that the Judeo-Converso phenomenon in Panama can be divided into two main periods: the Castilian period and the Portuguese period.

==== 1. The Castilian Period (1501–1580) ====
This period was marked by the arrival of Crypto-Jews of Castilian origin, who played an active role in the colonization of the territory. When Rodrigo de Bastidas arrived on the Isthmus of Panama in 1501, he was accompanied by recent converts to Christianity. From the first Spanish expeditions and throughout the conquest, Judeo-Conversos were present in the region.

The governor and founder of the city of Panama, Pedro Arias Dávila (known as Pedrarias), had Jewish ancestry on both his paternal and maternal sides. His paternal grandfather, Ysaque Abenazar, was an influential member of the Jewish community of Segovia, who later converted to Catholicism and adopted the name Diego Arias Dávila. Although his religious beliefs remain uncertain, it is established that he protected Judeo-Conversos from persecution led by Franciscan friar Juan de Quevedo.

Other notable figures of Converso origin include the following captains and governors:

* Felipe Gutiérrez de Toledo (a member of the Pisa clan): He served as governor of Veragua and led a migratory movement from Almagro and Toledo to the Veragua region. History professor Enrique Soria Mesa studied this migration and compiled a list of Judeo-Converso individuals who traveled with him.
* Diego Gutiérrez: He was governor of Veragua and obtained, through a new asiento on November 29, 1540, the right to explore and populate the region as governor and captain of Veragua. Tragically, he was killed by the indigenous population.

In his work &quot;The Pisa Family: A Converso Lineage&quot;, Byrzdett documents the detailed genealogy of the Pisa family, whose descendants arrived in Panama before settling in other regions. Although not all Crypto-Jews bore the name &quot;de Pisa,&quot; the author uses it as a reference due to its significance as a common lineage among several Converso families in the region.

==== 2. The Portuguese Period (1580–1640) ====
The Portuguese period began in 1580, following the dynastic union of Portugal with the Spanish Crown. During this period, Portuguese Crypto-Jews, who were better organized and had more resources, managed to establish a house of prayer on Calafates Street, located behind the old cathedral of Panama la Vieja. However, the Inquisition intensified its persecution against Judaizers, culminating in 1640 with an event known as the &quot;Great Conspiracy,&quot; which dismantled much of the Crypto-Jewish network on the Isthmus. From then on, their presence in historical records became more difficult to trace, as fear of persecution led many to further conceal their identity.

One of the most documented episodes of this persecution was the arrest of the Portuguese Sebastián Rodríguez, accused of being a Judaizer, meaning a practitioner of Judaism. Rodríguez led a group of Crypto-Jews, including Antonio de Ávila, González de Silva, Domingo de Almeyda, and a Mercedarian friar, all secretly practicing Judaism. During the trial, four doctors confirmed the presence of a circumcision mark on Rodríguez, which was used as evidence against him.

=== Period of Union with Colombia ===
When the isthmus joined Simón Bolívar’s federation project, a new wave of Jewish migration took place, revitalizing Mosaic faith in the region. These early Jewish immigrants arrived under a new policy that encouraged religious freedom in the newly independent territories. Thanks to their proficiency in languages such as German, Spanish, French, English, Dutch, and Papiamento, they played a crucial role as intermediaries and translators, facilitating communication between the local population and foreigners arriving in or passing through the region.

Sephardic (Judeo-Spanish) mainly from nearby islands such as Curaçao, St. Thomas and Jamaica, and Jewish immigrants from Central and Eastern Europe began arriving in Panama in large quantities until the mid-nineteenth century, attracted by economic incentives such as bi-oceanic railway construction and the California gold rush. And Ashkenazi (Judeo-German) Jews began arriving in significant numbers in Panama in the mid-19th century, attracted by economic opportunities such as the construction of the interoceanic railroad and the California Gold Rush. This migratory flow marked an important chapter in the history of Panama’s Jewish community.

=== Republican Period ===
The Republic of Panama, in its current form, would be significantly different without the notable contributions of the Panamanian Jewish community. Its role in the struggle for the country&#x27;s independence in 1903 was crucial and prevented the failure of the separatist movement. Prominent members of the Kol Shearith Israel Congregation, such as Isaac Brandon, M.D. Cardoze, M.A. De León, Joshua Lindo, Morris Lindo, Joshua Piza, and Isaac L. Toledano, provided essential financial support to the Revolutionary Junta when the promised funds from Philippe Jean Bunau-Varilla failed to materialize. Without their contribution, the lives of the leaders responsible for Panama’s separation from Colombia could have been in jeopardy. For this reason, the commitment of the Jewish community was of vital importance at this historical moment for Panama.

They were followed by other waves of immigration: during the First World War the Ottoman Empire from disintegrating, before and after the Second World War from Europe, from Arab countries because of the exodus caused in 1948 and more recently from South American countries suffering economic crises.

The center of Jewish life in Panama is Panama City, although historically small groups of Jews settled in other cities, like Colón, David, Chitre, La Chorrera, Santiago de Veraguas and Bocas del Toro. Those communities are disappearing as families move to the capital in search of education for their children and for economic reasons. Today Jewish community numbers some 20,000.

Panama is the only country in the world except for Israel that has had two Jewish presidents in the twentieth century. In the sixties Max Delvalle was first vice president, then president. His nephew, Eric Arturo Delvalle, was president between 1985 and 1988. The two were members of Kol Shearith Israel synagogue and were involved in Jewish life.

==Paraguay==

Toward the 19th century, Jewish immigrants arrived in Paraguay from countries such as France, Switzerland and Italy. During World War I Jews from Palestine (Jerusalem), Egypt and Turkey arrived in Paraguay, mostly Sephardic Jews. In the 1920s, there was a second wave of immigrants from Ukraine and Poland. Between 1933 and 1939, between 15,000 and 20,000 Jews from Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia took advantage of Paraguay&#x27;s liberal immigration laws to escape from Nazi-occupied Europe. After World War II, most Jews that arrived in Paraguay were survivors of concentration camps. Today, there are 1,000 Jews mostly living in Paraguay&#x27;s capital, Asunción. Most are of German descent.

== Peru==

In Peru, conversos arrived at the time of the Spanish Conquest. At first, they had lived without restrictions because the Inquisition was not active in Peru at the beginning of the Viceroyalty. Then, with the advent of the Inquisition, New Christians began to be persecuted, and, in some cases, executed. In this period, these people were sometimes called &quot;marranos&quot;, converts (&quot;conversos&quot;), and &quot;cristianos nuevos&quot; (New Christians) even if they had not been among the original converts from Judaism and had been reared as Catholics. The descendants of these Colonial Sephardic Jewish descent converts to Christianity settled mainly in the northern highlands and northern high jungle, and they were assimilated to local people: Cajamarca, the northern highlands of Piura as Ayabaca and Huancabamba, among others, due to cultural and ethnic contact with the southern highlands of Ecuador. In modern times, before and after the Second World War, some Ashkenazic Jews, Western and Eastern Slavic and Hungarians mainly, migrated to Peru, mostly to Lima. Today, Peruvian Jews represent an important part of the economics and politics of Peru; the majority of them are from the Ashkenazi community.

==Puerto Rico==
Puerto Rico is currently home to the largest Jewish community in the Caribbean, with over 3,000 Jews supporting four synagogues; three in the capital city of San Juan: one each Reform, Conservative and Chabad, as well as a Satmar community in the western part of the island in the town of Mayagüez known as Toiras Jesed for Minyanim information. Many Jews managed to settle in the island as secret Jews and settled in the island&#x27;s remote mountainous interior as did the early Jews in all Spanish and Portuguese colonies. In the late 1800s during the Spanish–American War many Jewish American servicemen gathered together with local Puerto Rican Jews at the Old Telegraph building in Ponce to hold religious services. Many Central and Eastern European Jews came after World War II.

==Suriname==
Suriname has the oldest Jewish community in the Americas. During the Inquisition in Portugal and Spain around 1500, many Jews fled to the Netherlands and the Dutch colonies to escape social discrimination and inquisitorial persecution, sometimes including torture and condemnation to the stake. Those who were converted to the Catholic faith were called New Christians, conversos, and, less often, &quot;Marranos&quot;. The stadtholder of the King of Portugal gave those who wanted to depart some time to let them settle, and supplied them with 16 ships and safe conduct to leave for the Netherlands. The Dutch government gave an opportunity to settle in Brazil. But most found their home in Recife, and merchants became cocoa growers. But the Portuguese in Brazil forced many Jews to move into the northern Dutch colonies in the Americas, The Guyanas. Jews settled in Suriname in 1639.
Suriname was one of the most important centers of the Jewish population in the Western Hemisphere, and Jews there were planters and slaveholders.
For a few years, when World War II arrived, many Jewish refugees from the Netherlands and other parts of Europe fled to Suriname. Today, 2,765 Jews live in Suriname.

==Trinidad and Tobago==
Trinidad and Tobago, a former British colony, is home to over 500 Jews.

==Uruguay==
Uruguay is home to the fifth-largest Jewish community in Latin America, and the second-largest as a proportion of the country&#x27;s total population. Jewish presence began during the colonial era, with the arrival of &quot;conversos&quot; to the Banda Oriental, fleeing the Spanish Inquisition. However, considerable Jewish immigration began at the end of the 19th century with the arrival of some Sephardic Jews from neighboring countries, and spread during the first half of the 20th century with the arrival of a large number of Ashkenazim.

By the first decades of the 20th century, the Jewish community had already set up an educational network, and its presence was notable in several areas of the capital Montevideo, such as the Villa Muñoz neighborhood, which became known as the city&#x27;s Jewish quarter. In addition, Jews from Belarus and Bessarabia formed an agricultural community in the rural area of the Paysandú Department.

Most of the Jewish immigration to Uruguay took place in the 1920s and 1930s, although in this latter period, there were some Fascist and liberal anti-immigration sectors that opposed all foreign immigration, weighing heavily on Jewish immigration. However, the country has traditionally been the destination of a large number of Jewish refugees during and after World War II. In 1940, the Central Israelite Committee of Uruguay was founded, uniting the different Jewish communities that had been formed based on the place of origin of the Jews who arrived in the country. It is estimated that between the 1950s and 1960s the Jewish community in Uruguay was made up of approximately 50,000 people.

== Venezuela==

The history of Venezuelan New Christians most likely began in the middle of the 17th century, when some records suggest that groups of &quot;conversos&quot; lived in Caracas and Maracaibo. At the turn of the 19th century, Venezuela and Colombia were fighting against their Spanish colonizers in wars of independence. Simón Bolívar, Venezuela&#x27;s liberator and his sister, found refuge and material support for his army in the homes of Jews from Curaçao. After independence, in 1826 practicing Jews came from Curaçao to Santa Ana Coro, where they had flourished under Dutch rule. Judaism was recognized as a legal religion. The government granted the Jews land for a cemetery.

According to a national census taken at the end of the 19th century, 247 Jews lived in Venezuela as citizens in 1891. In 1907, the Israelite Beneficial Society, which became the Israelite Society of Venezuela in 1919, was created as an organization to bring all the Jews who were scattered through various cities and towns throughout the country together.

By 1943, nearly 600 German Jews had entered the country, with several hundred more becoming citizens after World War II. By 1950, the community had grown to around 6,000 people, even in the face of immigration restrictions.

During the first decades of the 21st century, many Venezuelan Jews decided to emigrate due to the growth of antisemitism and to the political crisis and instability. Currently, there are around 10,000 Jews living in Venezuela, with more than half living in the capital Caracas. Venezuelan Jewry is split equally between Sephardim and Ashkenazim. All but one of the country&#x27;s 15 synagogues are Orthodox. The majority of Venezuela&#x27;s Jews are members of the middle class.

The current president of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, claims to be of Sephardic Jewish descent. Jewish groups, such as the Latin American Jewish Congress, have criticized Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, of fostering antisemitism.

<text>Computer and Video Games (also known as CVG, Computer &amp; Video Games, C&amp;VG, Computer + Video Games, or C+VG) is a UK-based video game magazine, published in its original form between 1981 and 2004. Its offshoot website was launched in 1999 and closed in February 2015. &quot;CVG&quot; was the longest-running video game media brand in the world. Several &quot;CVG&quot; writers led the creation of &quot;Video Games Chronicle&quot; in 2019.

==History==
&quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; was established in 1981, being the first British video games magazine. Initially published monthly between November 1981 and October 2004 and solely web-based from 2004 onwards, the magazine was one of the first publications to capitalise on the growing home computing market, although it also covered arcade games. At the time of launch it was the world&#x27;s first dedicated video games magazine. The first issue featured articles on &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, Chess, Othello and advice on how to learn programming.

Reviews featured a numerical score, with the highest rated games receiving the &quot;C+VG Hit&quot; award. This logo came to be seen as a selling point for games, big and small.

The magazine had a ABC of 106,000 for the second half of 1986.

===Website===
In early 2014, CVG, amongst other Future-operated websites, was earmarked for closure by management, but instead received staff cuts in July.
Future announced the closure of the website in December 2014. The website closed on 26 February 2015, with all pages redirecting to Gamesradar+, another Future publication.

===YouTube channel===
Until the closure of CVG, their official YouTube channel provided a variety of video game related content, providing everything from walkthroughs of games to news regarding video game consoles and regarding gaming events. Their second longest running series, &quot;GTA V O&#x27;clock&quot; covered news and conspiracy theories regarding Rockstar Games&#x27; &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot; and &quot;Grand Theft Auto Online&quot;. It was one of the few publications invited to see and play &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot; before its release to the public on 17 September 2013 and re-release for PC on 14 April 2015.

===&quot;CVG Presents&quot;===
When the magazine did reappear it was in a new form, titled &quot;CVG Presents&quot;, on 16 April 2008 with a bi-monthly release schedule.

==Golden Joystick Awards==
CVG hosted the annual Golden Joystick Awards, the longest running gaming ceremony in the world and widely acknowledged as one of the most prestigious, as they&#x27;re voted for solely by the general gaming public. Originally created in 1982 as the CVG magazine&#x27;s annual awards ceremony, the awards moved onto the web with CVG.com in 1999.

In April 1983, the magazine published the results of its first Golden Joystick Awards, along with pictures from the ceremony in Berkeley Square. DJ Dave Lee Travis presented the award for best game of the year to Jetpac.

<text>John Gully (21 August 1783 – 9 March 1863) was an English champion prizefighter who became a racehorse owner and, from 1832 to 1837, a Member of Parliament.

==Early life==
Gully was born at Wick, near Bath, the son of an innkeeper who became a butcher in Bath shortly after John&#x27;s birth. Gully worked for his father and inherited the business on his father&#x27;s death. In 1805, the business failed and as a result, Gully was imprisoned for debt.

==Boxing==
Gully was visited in prison by a friend, Hen Pearce, a well-known prizefighter who was nicknamed &quot;the Game Chicken&quot; in bare-knuckle boxing circles. An informal match was arranged between them, which took place in the prison; as a result, Gully&#x27;s debts were settled. On 8 October 1805, Gully was again matched against Pearce in a fight watched by the Duke of Clarence (later William IV of the United Kingdom) and numerous other spectators. After fighting twenty eight rounds, taking an hour and seventeen minutes, Gully was beaten. In 1807, he twice fought Bob Gregson, the &quot;Lancashire Giant&quot;, for two hundred guineas a side, winning on both occasions. The foremost prizefighting reporter of the period, Pierce Egan, recorded their battle of 14 October 1807:
:‘Gregson’s strength was manifest to his opponent, who endeavoured to ward off its potent effects by his thorough knowledge of the science, and Gulley put in another dreadful facer, which made the claret fly in all directions, when Gregson fell&#x27; (&quot;Boxiana&quot;, vol. I).

==Horse racing==
Gully became the landlord of the Plough Tavern in Carey Street, London. He retired from the ring in 1808, and took to horse-racing. In 1827 he lost £40,000 by backing his horse Mameluke (for which he had paid four thousand guineas) for the St. Leger Stakes. In partnership with Robert Ridsdale, in 1832, he made £85,000 by winning The Derby and St Leger with St. Giles and Margrave.

In 1844 in partnership with John Day, Gully won the 2,000 Guineas with Ugly Buck, and two years later he took the Derby and The Oaks with Pyrrhus The First and Mendicant. In 1854 he won the 2,000 Guineas with Hermit, and in the same year, in partnership with Henry Adwick, the Derby with Andover.

==Political and business interests==
Having bought Ackworth Park near Pontefract, he became Member of Parliament (MP) for the Pontefract constituency from December 1832 to July 1837. He was elected to the first post-Reform Parliament. In 1862 he purchased the Wingate Grange estate and collieries. A street in Wingate, County Durham is named after him.

Gully died in Durham on 9 March 1863 aged 79. His body was returned to Ackworth where he was interred with his daughter.

==Family==
Gully was twice married and had twelve children by each wife. His daughter Mary married Thomas Pedley. Their son was the engineer and cricketer William Pedley.

==John Gully in fiction==
Gully is a real-life character in &quot;Royal Flash&quot;, one of George MacDonald Fraser&#x27;s &quot;The Flashman Papers&quot; series of books. He was played by Henry Cooper in the 1975 film version.

<doc id="1337342" wikidata="Q2458938" url="?curid=1337342" title="Barlow, North Yorkshire">
<text>Barlow is a small village and civil parish located in the Selby District of North Yorkshire, England, about 16 miles south of York. In the 2011 census, it had around 290 houses and a population of 753.

The village has very few amenities, but there is a primary school and a licensed social club run by a committee of members. There are three entrances to the village, two of which lead from the A1041 road between Selby and Camblesforth. The other entrance is a single-track road leading from the Selby bypass. The village&#x27;s two nature reserves offer a network of paths and bridleways for woodland walks but neither allows horse riding. Barlow common also has a private fishing area and information centre.

Before the 19th century, Barlow was usually known as &#x27;Berlay&#x27; or &#x27;Barley&#x27;. The village was historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire until 1974.

==Overview==

Barlow is an essentially rural village, situated about three miles from the town of Selby and from the motorway network. More recently the village could best be described as a dormitory village for commuters to Selby, York and Leeds. At the very end of the village is a roundabout, and beyond this the gated entrance can be found to the Skylark Nature Reserve and Education Centre. Also operating from the reserve is the Yorkshire Swan &amp; Wildlife Rescue Hospital, a local registered charity where many thousands of injured animals are treated and rehabilitated back to the wild each year.

The services of the village are limited, with only the primary school and social club being the main amenities. Formally the village had a Post Office and Public House, although both of these ceased to operate in the last century. The village has a mixed-use hall near the social club, being prominently used as a daytime nursery and gym.

Barlow Church held weekly services and as well as services for the Primary school. It was closed by the parish of Brayton in 2012, due to the very small congregation coming to the weekly services. The vicar however still makes visits to the primary school, to celebrate important events in the Christian calendar.

==History==

Evidence of Barlow was first recorded in 1020, in a survey of the estates of the Archbishop of York. After the Norman Conquest, it was part of an estate centred on Drax manor. The only physical evidence of medieval settlement in Barlow is the earthworks around the present Barlow Hall farm. The furrow fields suggest that the area was in use around the time of the Norman Conquest, as the settlement was recorded in the Domesday Book as &#x27;Berlai&#x27;.

In 1520, London gentry family the Thompsons purchased the lands and built Barlow Hall and later the village chapel in the 16th century. The population grew during the industrial period and the main layout of Barlow was erected around this time. Much of the present housing was built in the last century.

The village was the site of an airship production factory in the early part of the 20th century. Established by Whitworth &amp; Co Ltd, it was responsible for the construction of the 25r, R29 and R33 during the First World War. However, in the aftermath of the war, the site became disused and the factory closed being replaced by a munitions depot in 1930. When Drax power station began construction in 1967 the supply depot was discontinued by the Ministry of Defence. The site had been mostly demolished by the late 1970s and all remains of now lie under the ash tip of Barlow Mound.
In 1912, the NER established the Selby-Goole railway line which ran through the current nature reserve down to the merry-go-rounds at Drax. It enabled the construction of the airship factory and later the ordnance depot. The station closed to passengers in 1964 but the line was still used by the depot; and for construction on Drax power station until 1983. The line was completely dismantled by 1986 and the nearby ballast tip was replaced by Barlow Common. It was declared a local nature reserve in March 2002.

<text>The Lewis River is an tributary of the Snake River. The entire course of the river is located within the boundaries of Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, US. The river is named for Meriwether Lewis, commander of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

The Lewis River begins at the southern end of Shoshone Lake and flows southerly approximately to Lewis Lake. This short stretch of the river is the only portion of the river where boating is permitted. The river reemerges at the southern end of Lewis Lake and flows in a general southerly direction through a steep canyon roughly paralleling the south entrance road toward the south entrance of the park. Below Lewis Lake the river passes over several cascades and waterfalls including Lewis Falls. Shortly before leaving the park, the Lewis River merges with the Snake River, changing the course of the Snake southward. The Snake soon flows out of Yellowstone into Grand Teton National Park and Jackson Lake.

The Lewis River has rapids up to Class VI and takes a drop at Lewis Falls, the most famous of many waterfalls and rapids on this short but scenic river.

Brown, rainbow and Yellowstone cutthroat trout are found in the river.

<text>Suicide Kings is a 1997 American crime thriller black comedy film directed by Peter O&#x27;Fallon, and starring Christopher Walken, Denis Leary, Sean Patrick Flanery, Johnny Galecki, Jay Mohr, Jeremy Sisto and Henry Thomas. Based on Don Stanford&#x27;s short story &quot;The Hostage&quot;, the film follows the group of students who kidnap a respected former Mafia figure.

It grossed $1.7 million in the US and holds a 35% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

==Plot==
Charlie Barret walks to his private table in a restaurant, only to see two young men sitting at his table – Avery and Max. Another young man, who is friends with Avery and Max, Brett, joins them shortly after Charlie sits down and begins chatting with them. Charlie happens to know Avery&#x27;s father, and, after an initial reluctance, is willing to go with the boys for a &quot;night on the town&quot;.

Before meeting Charlie, they had previously planned to use chloroform to knock him out in their car. The plan goes awry, and Charlie fights back, almost wrecking the car before they can finally put him under. When Charlie wakes up, he sees himself surrounded by the three men, and a fourth friend, T. K., checks his vital signs. It is revealed that Charlie is Carlo Bartolucci, a former mob figure. The boys explain that Avery&#x27;s sister, Elise, has been kidnapped, and that the kidnappers are demanding a $2 million ransom for her release. Unable to come up with the money on such short notice, they figure Charlie still has connections to get the money and set up an exchange. To ensure that Charlie knows how serious they are, Charlie is shown his cut-off finger, still wearing his signet ring, and is told that the same was done to Elise. As incentive for his cooperation, they explain that they will do to him everything that is done to Elise.

Charlie flies into a rage and threatens to kill them, though he eventually agrees to help. As Charlie requests continual alcoholic drinks and his blood does not properly clot, T. K., a medical student, explains that Charlie&#x27;s alcoholism may cause him to die of blood loss if he is not taken to a hospital. Charlie contacts his lawyer, who in turn contacts Lono, Charlie&#x27;s bodyguard, and asks him to track Charlie down. Lono goes about his own investigation, asking for - and in some cases beating out - information from people. However, he shows he has a soft side as one of the people he beats up is the father of Jennifer, the hostess at the restaurant that Charlie and the boys frequent. Meanwhile, Charlie seems to take perverse pleasure in playing mind games with his kidnappers. During the course of these conversations, Charlie unnerves the friends with stories of his early years as a gangster, especially concerning some former neighbors of his that he had had killed and then fed their remains to their Dobermans. Another story was how he got his signet ring.

Meanwhile Marty, Charlie&#x27;s attorney, conducts his own investigation. He speaks to Lydia, a successful madam, whose life Charlie had saved, many years ago, from her former lover and pimp. The pimp wanted to kill her because she&#x27;d spent money on herself that he felt belonged to him. Lydia gives Marty a list of contacts.

As Lono searches for Charlie, Charlie takes advantage of the boys&#x27; naïveté. A fifth friend, Ira, shows up unexpectedly and demands an explanation. They tell him they are using his house under the cover story of a poker game. Ira is flustered by their carelessness in his parents&#x27; house and becomes even more worried when he realizes they have kidnapped a major figure in the mob.

Charlie plays the friends against each other, slowly getting information out of them and using it to his advantage. After much cajoling and piecing information together, Charlie identifies Max, Elise&#x27;s boyfriend, as an inside man and pressures him into saying he is sorry. As his enraged friends plan to cut off his finger, Avery stops them by admitting that it was actually his plan, and says he recruited Max to help him. Avery had made several unlucky bets, could not pay off his debts, and was approached by mobsters who had purchased his debt. They offered him a way out: Become an inside man in his own sister&#x27;s kidnapping.

Lono eventually makes his way to Ira&#x27;s house and forces the young men to remove Charlie from his restraints. Around the same time, the money is sent to the two thugs who are demanding the ransom and they agree that Elise will be dropped off at a nearby hospital. Lono and Charlie drive away and Avery rushes to meet his sister at the appointed drop-off, but she does not appear. Avery is devastated.

Charlie and Lono track down the two kidnappers and demand the money back. Lono retrieves a suitcase from the bathroom that is supposed to have the $2 million in it. When Charlie and Lono demand to know where &quot;the girl&quot; is, they insist that they never kidnapped Elise. Charlie and Lono think that the thugs are lying and shoot them both dead. They then discover that Elise is indeed not being held with the thugs and Lono remarks that the suitcase doesn&#x27;t feel heavy/full enough (implying that some cash may be missing). It is revealed that Max and Elise set the whole thing up, splitting the ransom between them and the thugs. Charlie and Lono track Max and Elise to a boat off a tropical island where, although Charlie understands their reasons for conning him and agrees with Max on how special Elise is, he has Lono shoot them both dead. The screen dissolves to a rotoscope red and the film ends with Charlie and Lono standing alone on the boat.

==Cast==
== Production ==

&quot;Suicide Kings&quot; was shot in Los Angeles.

The film also features two alternate endings. In one of them, Charlie allows Max and Elise to live, but reclaims the $1 million, giving them a small amount of the money back. In the other ending, Charlie allows them to live, but takes his money, after which Lono shoots holes in the boat, causing it to slowly sink. However, test audiences didn&#x27;t like these endings as much, feeling that Max and Elise needed to pay for the betrayal of their friends and grief they had caused.

==Reception==
Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 35% of 31 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 5.4/10. Joe Leydon of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;With a nod toward Quentin Tarantino and an appreciative wink at Lyle Kessler&#x27;s &quot;Orphans&quot;, &quot;Suicide Kings&quot; is a smart and snappy drama tinged with dark humor and brimming with self-confidence.&quot; James Berardinelli of &quot;ReelViews&quot; wrote &quot;while the narrative is a little too erratic to ascend to the &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; level, the tone and style are on target. For those who aren&#x27;t offended by extreme profanity and violence, &quot;Suicide Kings&quot; offers a kinetic and surprisingly funny two hours.&quot; David Luty of &quot;Film Journal International&quot; called it &quot;a convoluted, senseless mess&quot; that borrows too much from Tarantino. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film will entertain those unconcerned about plot holes or credibility. Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;a smart B-picture with lots of A-pluses&quot;. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; rated it C− and called it &quot;another imitation of early Quentin Tarantino&quot;, as did Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert on their show.

<text>The London Museum Docklands in West India Quay, London, explains the history of the River Thames, the growth of the Port of London and the docks&#x27; historical link to the Atlantic slave trade. The museum is part of the London Museum and is jointly funded by the City of London Corporation and the Greater London Authority.

The museum opened in 2003 in grade I listed early 19th-century Georgian &quot;low&quot; sugar warehouses built in 1802 on the north side of West India Docks, a short walk from Canary Wharf.

==Collections and exhibits==
Much of the museum&#x27;s collection is from the museum and archives of the Port of London Authority, which became part of the port and river collections of the Museum of London in the 1970s. These were put into storage by the Museum of London in 1985. The museum includes videos presented by Tony Robinson, and it houses a large collection of historical artefacts, models, and pictures in 12 galleries and a children&#x27;s gallery (Mudlarks), arranged over two floors. Visitors are directed through the displays in chronological order. The periods covered range from the first port on the Thames in Roman times to the closure of the central London docks in the 1970s and the subsequent transformation of the area with commercial and residential developments.

London Museum Docklands has a lecture theatre and meeting rooms and hosts talks and events connected with the docks. Several workers who worked on the docks in the 1960s take part in these events, including one from the Pentonville Five. The reading room and Sainsbury Study Centre house the archives.

The museum has acquired several historic vessels for preservation over its existence. Among these were the tugboats &quot;Knocker White&quot; and &quot;Varlet&quot;, both acquired in 1986. By the 2010s the museum had decided to rationalise its collection of vessels; one was transferred to a local group, and another, the Wey barge &quot;Perseverance IV&quot;, to the National Trust. The last two vessels, &quot;Knocker White&quot; and &quot;Varlet&quot;, were transferred to Trinity Buoy Wharf in November 2016.

In 2007, the museum marked the bicentenary of the Slave Trade Act 1807, which abolished British involvement in the Atlantic slave trade by opening a £14 million exhibition funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund entitled &quot;London, Sugar, Slavery&quot;. In March 2016, the museum opened an exhibit relating to the building itself. The building was originally called No. 1 Warehouse, and was built in 1802 during the expansion of West India Docks. In September of that year, the museum displayed Dick Moore&#x27;s George Cross medal for bravery during the London Blitz. In 2017, the museum opened an exhibit displaying archaeological findings discovered during work on Crossrail. In 2020 it plans to put the Havering hoard on display.

<text>Chris Savido (born Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania) is an American artist whose acrylic portrait of George W. Bush composed of monkeys created controversy when the managers of Chelsea Market closed down the &quot;ANIMAL&#x27;S PARADISE&quot; art exhibition there because of it. It was later auctioned on eBay.

There was debate over whether the closing of the show constituted censorship. Supporters of the managers claimed that Chelsea Market was private, and thus management had a right to exclude the painting, while supporters of Savido &quot;[looked] into the degree to which the Chelsea Market walkways are legally definable as &#x27;public space,&#x27; and, as such, fully protected by the First Amendment.&quot;

Anonymous donors later paid for a digital billboard over the Holland Tunnel to show a detail of the painting.

<doc id="1337367" wikidata="Q7167105" url="?curid=1337367" title="Percival Drayton">
<text>Percival Drayton (August 25, 1812 – August 4, 1865) was a career United States Navy officer. He served in the Brazil Squadron, the Mediterranean Squadron and as a staff officer during the Paraguay Expedition.

During the American Civil War, he commanded naval forces against Confederate forts defended by his brother Thomas F. Drayton in the Battle of Port Royal. He served as Fleet Captain in the West Gulf Blockading Squadron and commanded the sloop-of-war during the Battle of Mobile Bay under Rear Admiral David Farragut. It was to Drayton that Farragut issued his famous command, &quot;Damn the torpedoes! Full steam ahead!&quot;

==Early life and family==

Drayton was born in Charleston, South Carolina, to Anna Gadsden and William Drayton, a prominent lawyer and U.S. Representative. He had an older brother Thomas F. Drayton. In 1833 the family relocated to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, following the Nullification Crisis, as William Drayton was a unionist. He was appointed as president of the Second Bank of the United States. Thomas, already grown, stayed in South Carolina and became a successful farmer and state senator.

William Drayton was a descendant of what had been a large landholding family in South Carolina. In the 1770s, his father William Drayton, Sr. had sold his property in South Carolina to his uncle John Drayton, after being appointed in the 1770s as chief justice of the Province of East Florida. John Drayton&#x27;s branch consolidated the holdings at Magnolia Plantation. After the American Revolutionary War, William Drayton, Sr. returned to South Carolina with his family and became prominent in its politics.

==Military career==

Percival Drayton was appointed a midshipman in the Navy in December 1827. He served two tours of duty with the Brazil Squadron in the South Atlantic from 1828 to 1830 and from 1839 to 1842. He served four tours in the Mediterranean Squadron from 1831 to 1832, 1835 to 1838, 1849 to 1850 and 1850 and 1852. He served one tour in the Pacific Ocean from 1842 to 1843 and one in the East Indies from 1845 to 1848.

During his time in the Brazil Squadron, stationed out of Rio de Janeiro, he served as a midshipman aboard the frigate . He attained the rank of Lieutenant in February 1838 and served aboard the schooner . His two years in the Pacific were served aboard the schooner . He had shore duty assignments at the Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., and at the New York Navy Yard.

Promoted to commander in September 1855, Drayton served as a staff officer during the Paraguay Expedition aboard the frigate . In 1859, he returned to the United States and was assigned as a member of the Board of Examiners to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. At the beginning of the Civil War in 1861, he was stationed at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, where he directed the construction and renovation of ships for war service.

In the fall of 1861, Drayton was placed in command of the gunboat ; he participated in the capture of Port Royal, South Carolina. His older brother Thomas F. Drayton, a graduate of West Point and classmate of Jefferson Davis, had resigned with the secession of South Carolina. He was a general of the Confederate army and commanded the forts destroyed in this engagement. The Union forces captured Hilton Head, Beaufort and Parris Island and used them as a base to continue operations against Savannah, Georgia and Charleston, South Carolina.
Drayton became commanding officer of the sloop-of-war and was active in inshore operations in the waters of South Carolina, Georgia and northern Florida through the summer of 1862. He was promoted to Captain in July 1862. In September 1862, he was given command of the ironclad . He oversaw her outfitting and worked with John Ericsson to improve elements of monitor design. In April 1863, Drayton commanded his ship as part of a nine ironclad attack on Forts McAllister and Sumter. The attack was unsuccessful and reinforced his opinion concerning the limitations of the monitor type ship for use against well-defended fortifications.

Drayton&#x27;s next assignment was as Superintendent of Ordnance at the New York Navy Yard. In December 1863 he began a year as Fleet Captain to the commander of the West Gulf Blockading Squadron, Rear Admiral David Glasgow Farragut. He commanded the squadron flagship, the big sloop-of-war and took part in the August 1864 Battle of Mobile Bay and the following operations within Mobile Bay. It was to Drayton that Farragut shouted his famous command, &quot;Damn the torpedoes! Full steam ahead!&quot;.
He was appointed Chief of the Bureau of Navigation in late April 1865. Drayton died of an obstructed bowel in Washington, D.C., on 4 August 1865 and was interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

==Namesakes==
The U.S. Navy has named two destroyers in honor of Percival Drayton, including: &quot;Drayton&quot; (Destroyer # 23, later DD-23) of 1910–1935; and of 1936–1946.

<doc id="1337370" wikidata="Q845080" url="?curid=1337370" title="Cross section (geometry)">
<text>In geometry and science, a cross section is the non-empty intersection of a solid body in three-dimensional space with a plane, or the analog in higher-dimensional spaces. Cutting an object into slices creates many parallel cross-sections. The boundary of a cross-section in three-dimensional space that is parallel to two of the axes, that is, parallel to the plane determined by these axes, is sometimes referred to as a contour line; for example, if a plane cuts through mountains of a raised-relief map parallel to the ground, the result is a contour line in two-dimensional space showing points on the surface of the mountains of equal elevation.

In technical drawing a cross-section, being a projection of an object onto a plane that intersects it, is a common tool used to depict the internal arrangement of a 3-dimensional object in two dimensions. It is traditionally crosshatched with the style of crosshatching often indicating the types of materials being used.

With computed axial tomography, computers can construct cross-sections from x-ray data.

==Definition==
If a plane intersects a solid (a 3-dimensional object), then the region common to the plane and the solid is called a cross-section of the solid. A plane containing a cross-section of the solid may be referred to as a &quot;cutting plane&quot;.

The shape of the cross-section of a solid may depend upon the orientation of the cutting plane to the solid. For instance, while all the cross-sections of a ball are disks, the cross-sections of a cube depend on how the cutting plane is related to the cube. If the cutting plane is perpendicular to a line joining the centers of two opposite faces of the cube, the cross-section will be a square, however, if the cutting plane is perpendicular to a diagonal of the cube joining opposite vertices, the cross-section can be either a point, a triangle or a hexagon.

===Plane sections===
A related concept is that of a plane section, which is the curve of intersection of a plane with a &quot;surface&quot;. Thus, a plane section is the boundary of a cross-section of a solid in a cutting plane. 

If a surface in a three-dimensional space is defined by a function of two variables, i.e., , the plane sections by cutting planes that are parallel to a coordinate plane (a plane determined by two coordinate axes) are called level curves or isolines.
More specifically, cutting planes with equations of the form (planes parallel to the -plane) produce plane sections that are often called contour lines in application areas.

==Mathematical examples of cross sections and plane sections==
A cross section of a polyhedron is a polygon.

The conic sections – circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas – are plane sections of a cone with the cutting planes at various different angles, as seen in the diagram at left.

Any cross-section passing through the center of an ellipsoid forms an elliptic region, while the corresponding plane sections are ellipses on its surface. These degenerate to disks and circles, respectively, when the cutting planes are perpendicular to a symmetry axis. In more generality, the plane sections of a quadric are conic sections.

A cross-section of a solid right circular cylinder extending between two bases is a disk if the cross-section is parallel to the cylinder&#x27;s base, or an elliptic region (see diagram at right) if it is neither parallel nor perpendicular to the base. If the cutting plane is perpendicular to the base it consists of a rectangle (not shown) unless it is just tangent to the cylinder, in which case it is a single line segment.

The term cylinder can also mean the lateral surface of a solid cylinder (see cylinder (geometry)). If a cylinder is used in this sense, the above paragraph would read as follows: A plane section of a right circular cylinder of finite length is a circle if the cutting plane is perpendicular to the cylinder&#x27;s axis of symmetry, or an ellipse if it is neither parallel nor perpendicular to that axis. If the cutting plane is parallel to the axis the plane section consists of a pair of parallel line segments unless the cutting plane is tangent to the cylinder, in which case, the plane section is a single line segment.
A plane section can be used to visualize the partial derivative of a function with respect to one of its arguments, as shown. Suppose . In taking the partial derivative of with respect to , one can take a plane section of the function at a fixed value of to plot the level curve of solely against ; then the partial derivative with respect to is the slope of the resulting two-dimensional graph.

===In related subjects===
A plane section of a probability density function of two random variables in which the cutting plane is at a fixed value of one of the variables is a conditional density function of the other variable (conditional on the fixed value defining the plane section). If instead the plane section is taken for a fixed value of the density, the result is an iso-density contour. For the normal distribution, these contours are ellipses.

In economics, a production function specifies the output that can be produced by various quantities and of inputs, typically labor and physical capital. The production function of a firm or a society can be plotted in three-dimensional space. If a plane section is taken parallel to the -plane, the result is an isoquant showing the various combinations of labor and capital usage that would result in the level of output given by the height of the plane section. Alternatively, if a plane section of the production function is taken at a fixed level of —that is, parallel to the -plane—then the result is a two-dimensional graph showing how much output can be produced at each of various values of usage of one input combined with the fixed value of the other input .

Also in economics, a cardinal or ordinal utility function gives the degree of satisfaction of a consumer obtained by consuming quantities and of two goods. If a plane section of the utility function is taken at a given height (level of utility), the two-dimensional result is an indifference curve showing various alternative combinations of consumed amounts and of the two goods all of which give the specified level of utility.

==Area and volume==
Cavalieri&#x27;s principle states that solids with corresponding cross-sections of equal areas have equal volumes.

The cross-sectional area (formula_1) of an object when viewed from a particular angle is the total area of the orthographic projection of the object from that angle. For example, a cylinder of height &quot;h&quot; and radius &quot;r&quot; has formula_2 when viewed along its central axis, and formula_3 when viewed from an orthogonal direction. A sphere of radius &quot;r&quot; has formula_2 when viewed from any angle. More generically, formula_1 can be calculated by evaluating the following surface integral:

: formula_6

where formula_7 is the unit vector pointing along the viewing direction toward the viewer, formula_8 is a surface element with an outward-pointing normal, and the integral is taken only over the top-most surface, that part of the surface that is &quot;visible&quot; from the perspective of the viewer. For a convex body, each ray through the object from the viewer&#x27;s perspective crosses just two surfaces. For such objects, the integral may be taken over the entire surface (formula_9) by taking the absolute value of the integrand (so that the &quot;top&quot; and &quot;bottom&quot; of the object do not subtract away, as would be required by the Divergence Theorem applied to the constant vector field formula_7) and dividing by two:

: formula_11

==In higher dimensions==
In analogy with the cross-section of a solid, the cross-section of an -dimensional body in an -dimensional space is the non-empty intersection of the body with a hyperplane (an -dimensional subspace). This concept has sometimes been used to help visualize aspects of higher dimensional spaces. For instance, if a four-dimensional object passed through our three-dimensional space, we would see a three-dimensional cross-section of the four-dimensional object. In particular, a 4-ball (hypersphere) passing through 3-space would appear as a 3-ball that increased to a maximum and then decreased in size during the transition. This dynamic object (from the point of view of 3-space) is a sequence of cross-sections of the 4-ball.

==Examples in science==


In geology, the structure of the interior of a planet is often illustrated using a diagram of a cross-section of the planet that passes through the planet&#x27;s center, as in the cross-section of Earth at right.

Cross-sections are often used in anatomy to illustrate the inner structure of an organ, as shown at the left.

A cross-section of a tree trunk, as shown at left, reveals growth rings that can be used to find the age of the tree and the temporal properties of its environment.

*16 February – &quot;The Silver Tassie&quot;, an opera by Mark-Anthony Turnage, receives its première at the London Coliseum, performed by the English National Opera.
*24 February – Italian motorcycle manufacturing company Aprilia wins a lawsuit filed against the Spice Girls over a sponsorship deal that fell apart when Geri Halliwell left the group.
*28 March – Jimmy Page wins a lawsuit filed against &quot;Ministry&quot; magazine, which claimed that Page had contributed to the death of Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham by wearing a Satanic robe and chanting spells while Bonham was dying. The magazine apologises and offers to pay Page&#x27;s legal bills. Page donates the money received from the case to the Action for Brazil&#x27;s Children Trust.
*4 April – Mick Jagger attends the opening of an arts centre named after him at Dartford Grammar School in southeast London.
*5 May – Rod Stewart undergoes an hour-long throat operation at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles to remove a growth on his thyroid, which turns out to be benign.
*13 May – The 45th Eurovision Song Contest final is held in Stockholm&#x27;s Globe Arena. The UK entry, &quot;Don&#x27;t Play That Song Again&quot;, performed by Nicki French, finishes in sixteenth place, the worst-ever showing for a UK entry up to that time.
