<text>Dink Smallwood is an action role-playing video game developed by Robinson Technologies at the time consisting of Seth Robinson, Justin Martin, and Greg Smith. It was first released in 1998 before being released as freeware on October 17, 1999. Mitch Brink composed several of the game&#x27;s music tracks while others are MIDI forms of classical music such as Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Reverie&quot;. The game has a small but constant fan following that continues to develop add-ons for the game more than two decades after its release. The game is also notable for its humorous dialogue and surrealistic themes in various scenes between the gameplay.

==Gameplay==
The game centers on Dink, a pig farmer-turned-hero who embarks on various quests throughout his world. The game features isometric, Diablo-like gameplay, including weapons, items, and magic. The game has a satirical off-color slant, including everything from a fiercely abusive uncle to a town that worships ducks. Dink is never freed from the grievances of being a pig farmer, a fact he is far too often reminded of by his nemesis, Milder Flatstomp.

==Storyline==
Dink starts out as a pig farmer, living a normal life in Stonebrook, his home village. His father is said to have disappeared, leaving him behind in a small village with his mother. Somehow, as he is outside, his house burns down and his mother is killed. He is then told to go out of his village into the world to find his aunt and start living a new life with her. Along the way, he hears of a powerful and sinister group known as the Cast whose nefarious deeds are threatening the kingdom. Dink eventually makes it his quest to defeat this mysterious cult. After that, he goes in the Darklands to kill the mighty evil, Seth.

==History==

===Development===
&quot;Dink Smallwood&quot; was developed by Robinson Technologies in the mid 1990s at the time where Seth Robinson, Justin Martin, and Greg Smith were involved. Mitch Brink composed several of the game&#x27;s music tracks. The game was initially released in 1997 for purchase in the United States and Europe. The game could be purchased from retail stores in Europe via European publisher Iridon Interactive, though Robinson Technologies did not secure a publisher for the United States, so this required them to sell to this region via mail order at the price of $25 (including shipping).

=== Freeware release ===
By the summer of 1999, Robinson Technologies had sold out of all their copies of &quot;Dink Smallwood&quot; and claimed that there were no plans to publish more copies. It was announced a short time later that the game would be distributed as freeware, and the freeware version of &quot;Dink Smallwood&quot; was released on October 17, 1999.

=== Source code release ===
Shortly after the freeware release, fans of the game often asked Seth Robinson if he had any plans to release the game&#x27;s source code. Seth generally replied &quot;no.&quot; He commonly cited the game&#x27;s sloppy and embarrassing coding as a reason for withholding the source from the community. After years of being pressed to do so, Seth finally decided to release the source code on July 17, 2003 under a Zlib-inspired own license without the content which was kept proprietary freeware. In 2008, the artwork was published (without some sounds) under a Zlib license.

A handful of projects focused on upgrading or porting &quot;Dink Smallwood&quot; have surfaced, most of them being canceled or postponed indefinitely.

=== Community-made Dink 1.08 ===
In 2005, Seth Robinson asked Dan &quot;redink1&quot; Walma, the owner of the &quot;Dink Network&quot; fan site, to create a new patch for Dink Smallwood. Robinson hoped that the numerous longstanding bugs in Dink would be fixed and the experience for new players would be streamlined. After eight-and-a-half months of development and numerous builds of alpha, beta, and release candidate testing involving the community, &quot;Dink Smallwood&quot; 1.08 was released as community-fixed version on March 10, 2006.

===GNU FreeDink===
The GNU GPL licensed GNU FreeDink fork, which is developed under the GNU Project umbrella, works on replacing the last proprietary sounds to make the game completely Free software. GNU FreeDink was ported to a variety of platforms including the PlayStation Portable, Linux, AmigaOS 4 and Mac OS X among others. GNU Freedink is based on the original v1.07 source code release, but has modes to run like v1.08. It is continuously updated and is the most successful source port so far.

DFArc2, a small GTK+ utility program, makes it easy to play and manage the Dink Smallwood game and its numerous Dink Modules (or D-Mods).

===Dink Smallwood HD===
As of December 16, 2011, a new version of Dink Smallwood called &quot;Dink Smallwood HD&quot; has been developed for iPhone, iPad, Android, Windows XP/Vista/7, webOS and Mac OS X by Seth Robinson. In the Windows/Mac/Android versions, it is also possible to play the fan-made D-Mods. A new feature is instant-load and instant-save where the player can save and load the game at any point - as opposed to the original game where saving was only possible at specific points in the game.

In October 2017 the HD version became fully free and open source too. The source code became available on GitHub shortly after.

==Modification==

Two level editors exist for Dink Smallwood. The original level editor, developed by Robinson Technologies, is DinkEdit, which is included with the game, and the second level editor is WinDinkEdit which was developed by fans of the game. The freeware game comes with its own D-Mod (short for Dink Module), Mystery Island, which follows Dink&#x27;s adventures after his victory in the original story. D-Mods can be heavily customized, and some of them are very different from the original game. Many D-Mods, some of them much longer than the original game, can be found online.

DinkEdit is a modal application that can be used to create a new world. The game world consists of at most 768 screens and each screen can have at most a hundred editor-placed sprites. Among other tasks, the editor can be used to specify music for a screen, assign scripts to sprites and to decorate the game world. WinDinkEdit is a level editor for Windows which enables the D-Mod author to perform the same tasks in a graphical environment.

The DinkC scripting language has a C-like syntax. Variables are prefixed with an ampersand, codice_1, and single line comments are supported with codice_2. Each sprite in the game can have a script attached to it which will be used to determine the behavior and appearance of the sprite. The engine calls various functions on certain events; for example, the &#x27;main&#x27;, &#x27;talk&#x27; and &#x27;hit&#x27; functions of a script will respectively be called upon loading the screen, when the player talks to the sprite and when the player hits the sprite. Each screen can also have a script attached to it which can be used for initialization of the screen or other events.

==Reception==

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; Issue #189 featured &quot;Dink Smallwood&quot; in the section &quot;The Good&quot;, saying &quot;Now here is something totally refreshing&quot;. While compared to other role-playing games, &quot;Dink Smallwood&quot; was praised for its humour, being described as “a spoonful of &quot;Zelda&quot;,…a dash of &quot;Monkey Island&quot; and a pinch of &quot;Diablo&quot;.” The humour was described as the one good aspect of the game and was found quite entertaining. However, with other elements letting the game down, the humour only made &quot;Dink Smallwood&quot; suitable as &quot;an inexpensive stopgap&quot;. The dialogue used when interacting with NPCs was criticised for containing errors as well as having little influence on the overall outcome of the game. Graphical errors were also listed, with the player character getting stuck on scenery and unable to move, or NPCs or monsters drifting through walls. The lack of interaction between NPCs and monsters was also referenced, with NPCs attempting to hold conversations while the player is in combat. Although &quot;Dink Smallwood&quot; was described as having little replay value on its own, the inclusion of editing software and the wide availability of user-generated content were noted as improving on this.

===References and impact===
In &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast&quot;, a reference to &quot;Dink Smallwood&quot; can be found: &quot;(Facetiously) I am Dinkamus Littlelog and I come in search of the holy groundhog.&quot;.

In &quot;Borderlands&#x27;&quot; first DLC, &quot;The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned&quot;, an adventurer named Dirk Smallwood is part of a missing &quot;Misery Bus&quot; crew parodying Scooby-Doo.

<text>Bruce Oldfield, OBE (born 14 July 1950) is a British fashion designer, best known for his couture occasionwear. Notable clients have included Sienna Miller, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Diana Ross, Charlotte Rampling, Jerry Hall, Joan Collins, Diana, Princess of Wales, Queen Noor of Jordan, Queen Camilla, the Duchess of Edinburgh and Queen Rania of Jordan.

==Early life==
Oldfield was brought up and educated in the care of children&#x27;s charity, Barnardo&#x27;s (his father, whom he never knew, had migrated to Britain from Jamaica). Between the ages of 1 and 13, Oldfield was placed in foster care where he was brought up by a seamstress who sparked his love for designing and making clothes. 

In 1963, age the age of 13, Oldfield moved to West Mount, a Dr Barnardo&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Home, in Ripon. Four years later, Oldfield moved out of West Mount and lodged with a couple in Harrogate.

In 1961, Oldfield passed the 11-plus and began to attend Spennymoor Grammar School. He was later educated at Ripon Grammar School, Sheffield City College of Education (now Sheffield Hallam University), and Ravensbourne College in London.

In 1973, he graduated from St. Martin&#x27;s School of Art, London, to critical acclaim. That year he staged his first one-man show for Henri Bendel, later returning to London to show his first collection.

==Career==
In 1975 the Bruce Oldfield label was born with the launch of ready-to-wear collections for European and American stores. He began making couture clothes in 1978 for individual clients and from 1980 for Diana, Princess of Wales. In 1984 he opened his first shop selling ready-to-wear and couture to an international clientele. During the 1980s, he also designed shoes for couture house Rayne.

In 2009 he opened a second premises in Beauchamp Place dedicated to weddings, incorporating wedding dresses, veils, and a full range of bridal accessories.

In 1990, Oldfield was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to the fashion industry; and in 2004 his autobiography &quot;Rootless&quot; was published. He has Honorary Fellowships to the Royal College of Art and the Universities of Durham and Sheffield, was Governor of The London Institute (1999–2001) and Trustee of the Royal Academy of Arts (2000–02).

In December 2001, Oldfield received an Honorary Doctorate of Civil Law (Hon DCL) from the University of Northumbria in Newcastle upon Tyne, and in 2005 an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Central England. He is also a Vice-President of Barnardo&#x27;s.

In 2005 it was reported that Oldfield was a supporter of the Conservative Party.

In 2023, Oldfield was chosen by Queen Camilla to design her coronation gown.

<doc id="1320902" wikidata="Q191855" url="?curid=1320902" title="Gareth Barry">
<text>Gareth Barry (born 23 February 1981) is an English professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Mid Sussex Football League side Hurstpierpoint. He made 653 Premier League appearances for Aston Villa, Manchester City, Everton and West Bromwich Albion, the highest number of Premier League appearances in history. He also represented England at international level.

Barry moved to Aston Villa from Brighton &amp; Hove Albion as a youngster, and spent 12 years at the club. He captained Aston Villa and is eighth in their all-time list of appearances, with 441 across all competitions, including 365 in the Premier League. He joined Manchester City for a fee of £12 million in June 2009, where he won the FA Cup in 2011 and the Premier League title the following season. After a season on loan, he joined Everton on a three-year contract in July 2014, and on its expiration he signed for West Bromwich Albion, where he played until his retirement in 2020.

Barry is a former England international, having won his first full cap in 2000 and captained the side in 2010 in a friendly against Egypt. He earned 53 caps in total, scoring 3 goals, and was included in England&#x27;s squads at UEFA Euro 2000 and the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

==Club career==
===Aston Villa===
Barry joined Aston Villa from Brighton and Hove Albion as a trainee in 1997, along with Michael Standing. The move was controversial, for the Brighton board had demanded £2.5 million for the two players; the Football Association&#x27;s transfer tribunal panel came up with a deal which would have seen Brighton make £2.4 million in the event of Barry and Standing making international appearances for England, as well as sell-on clauses. Following a season in the reserves and academy sides he played his first senior match for Villa on 2 May 1998, a 3–1 win at Sheffield Wednesday, as a 49th-minute substitute for Ian Taylor. On 24 April 1999, on at half time for the injured Dion Dublin, he finished Steve Stone&#x27;s cross 12 minutes later for his first professional goal, concluding a 2–0 win over Nottingham Forest at Villa Park. He started in the 2000 FA Cup Final at the old Wembley Stadium, which Villa lost 1–0 to Chelsea. In August 2001, he featured as Villa defeated FC Basel 5–2 on aggregate in the final of the 2001 UEFA Intertoto Cup.

In November 2007, it was reported that Aston Villa were set to award Barry a testimonial, at the age of just 26, to recognise his 10 years at the club. On 5 April 2008, Barry helped to break a run of bad form, scoring in a 4–0 victory over Bolton Wanderers. He scored two goals (his first two from open play that season) and he was also credited with two assists.

As of April 2008, Barry, approaching 400 total appearances for Aston Villa, was the longest serving player in the team. During the league game against Bolton Wanderers on 28 October 2007, Barry became the youngest player to appear in 300 Premier League games (aged 26 years 247 days), surpassing former record-holder Frank Lampard.

In May 2008, Liverpool made a series of bids to buy Barry, all of which were rejected by Aston Villa. Barry publicly criticised his manager, Martin O&#x27;Neill, accusing him of making no attempt to keep him at the club, and further stating a desire to join Liverpool in order to compete in the Champions League. O&#x27;Neill denied this claim and Barry was officially disciplined for giving an unauthorised interview. A further bid from Liverpool of around £15 million was rejected as it was still short of Villa&#x27;s £18 million asking price. Steve Finnan had then been offered in part-exchange in the deal, but the fee Villa wanted in this case was understood by BBC Sport to be £17 million with Finnan included. Barry was then stripped of the team captaincy, fined two weeks&#x27; wages and banned from training with the Villa squad.

He remained an Aston Villa player, starting in a UEFA Cup tie against Fimleikafélag Hafnarfjarðar, in which he scored in a 4–1 win. The goal against Hafnarfjordur was Barry&#x27;s first European goal since he scored a penalty in the Intertoto Cup against Celta Vigo in 2000. On 18 September 2008, he made his 400th appearance in a Villa shirt in the UEFA Cup away to Litex Lovech, scoring a penalty as Villa won the match 3–1. Barry scored again for Villa as they beat Ajax 2–1 in their first UEFA Cup group match on 23 October 2008. Owing to the transfer saga, O&#x27;Neill had taken the captaincy away from him and handed it to centre-back Martin Laursen for the 2008–09 season. Following Laursen&#x27;s injury, the captaincy was restored to Barry in January 2009. In total, he made 441 appearances for Aston Villa, scoring 52 goals in the process.

===Manchester City===
On 2 June 2009, Barry signed a five-year contract with Manchester City for a fee of £12 million and wore the number 18 shirt. Many Aston Villa fans publicly criticised Barry for this move considering his alleged desire to play in the UEFA Champions League. However, Barry responded to this positively and wrote a letter to the &quot;Birmingham Mail&quot; in which he thanked the Villa fans for their support while he was there, claiming that his move to City was for a &quot;new challenge&quot;. He made his debut for City in the opening league game of the season against Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park, playing the full 90 minutes in a 2–0 victory.

Barry scored his first Premier League goal for City against Manchester United at Old Trafford on 20 September 2009 levelling the scores at 1–1, but City went on to lose the match 4–3. Three days later, he scored a header in a League Cup tie with Fulham to make the scores 1–1 and City went on to win in extra time. On 16 February 2010, a week before his 29th birthday he played the full 90 minutes and scored a late equaliser in a 1–1 draw against Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium. Barry started the 2011 FA Cup Final as City defeated Stoke 1–0.

Barry scored his first goal of the 2011–12 season on 21 August in a 3–2 win against Bolton Wanderers. On 3 January 2012 he was sent off for the first time since joining Manchester City, in a 3–0 league win against Liverpool. Barry made 34 Premier League appearances in the 2011–12 season as Manchester City won the league title, the club&#x27;s first in 44 years. On 11 December 2012, Barry was charged with misconduct by the Football Association, and two days later he was fined £8,000 and banned for one match for the offence, having verbally abused a match official.

===Everton===
On 2 September 2013, transfer deadline day, Barry was loaned to Everton in a season-long deal. He made his debut on 15 September in a 1–0 home league win against Chelsea during which he made a block on Samuel Eto&#x27;o which prevented a certain goal, later being named man of the match. Later in the month Barry became the 10th player in Premier League history to make 500 career appearances in a 3–2 win over Newcastle United. He scored his first goal for the club in a 2–1 victory over Hull City on 19 October; the goal was originally awarded to Kevin Mirallas; however, the goals panel ruled that en route to the goal, Barry was deemed to have got the last touch on the ball before it beat Hull keeper Allan McGregor. He scored a long range effort in a 2–0 victory against Norwich City on 11 January 2014. He became a mainstay in Everton&#x27;s midfield during the season and forged a partnership with James McCarthy. Barry completed the most passes of any Everton player during his spell as he helped the club amass a club record of 72 Premier League points to finish fifth. Barry was booked 10 times during the season to have the worst disciplinary record at the club.

On 8 July 2014, following his successful loan spell at Goodison Park, Barry completed a permanent move to Everton, signing a three-year deal having been released by Manchester City following the expiry of his contract. On 26 December, he was booked for a foul on Steven Nzonzi in a 1–0 home loss to Stoke City, making him the first player to receive 100 yellow cards in the Premier League era. Barry was sent off with two minutes remaining away to Chelsea on 11 February 2015 for a foul on Willian, causing a melée in which he was confronted by Branislav Ivanović; the game was scoreless at the incident and Everton eventually lost 1–0.

Barry was sent off in added time at the end of a 2–1 loss at Arsenal on 24 October 2015, receiving a second yellow card for a foul on Kieran Gibbs. Following Everton&#x27;s 2–1 win over Manchester City in the first leg of the League Cup semi-final on 6 January 2016, manager Roberto Martínez described Barry as &quot;one of the best English players ever.&quot; On 12 March 2016 in a 2–0 win over Chelsea in the FA Cup quarter-final, Barry was booked for a confrontation with Diego Costa, who was given a second yellow card for his part and sent off. Barry, who was later sent off himself, denied suggestions that he had been bitten on the neck by his opponent. Facing Sunderland in May 2016, he set a new record by starting a Premier League game for the 572nd time.

Barry became the third player (after Ryan Giggs and Frank Lampard) to make 600 Premier League appearances when he played against Middlesbrough on 17 September 2016, and equalised from a corner-kick routine in a 3–1 victory.

===West Bromwich Albion===
On 15 August 2017, Barry signed for fellow Premier League side West Bromwich Albion for an undisclosed fee. Four days later he made his debut for the Baggies in a 1–0 win at Burnley and manager Tony Pulis praised him as &quot;absolutely fantastic&quot;. On 25 September, Barry captained West Brom as he made his 633rd Premier League appearance, beating Ryan Giggs&#x27; record of 632, in a 2–0 loss to Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium. At the time of breaking the record, Barry was eighth in English top-flight appearances since the Second World War.

After an injury brought his 2018–19 season to a premature end, Barry was released by West Brom in July 2019. After he recovered, the club expressed interest in re-signing him in October 2019, but a clause in his previous deal meant his former club, Everton, would be due a further payment if he received a contract extension. He was eventually re-signed on 4 November 2019 until the end of the 2019–20 season.

===Retirement and non-league football===
Barry announced his retirement from football on 27 August 2020. He continued to make appearances for Kidderminster-based over 35s team &quot;Comberton Dynamoes Veterans&quot; after the end of his professional playing career. In July 2024, Barry joined village amateur side Hurstpierpoint in the Mid Sussex Football League, which sits at the 12th tier of the English football pyramid. Barry made his debut for Hurstpierpoint away to Eastbourne Rangers on 8 February 2025.

==International career==
Barry first represented England at under-16 level, and also played for the under-18s. He made his England under-21 debut against the Czech Republic in 1998, and made 27 appearances for the under-21 side between 1998 and 2003. This was a record at the time, though has since been surpassed.

Barry was first picked for the senior England side by Kevin Keegan. After an injury to Jason Wilcox, he travelled to UEFA Euro 2000, but did not feature in any of the side&#x27;s games. Barry made his England debut as a substitute in a pre-Euro 2000 friendly against Ukraine on 31 May 2000. His first start for England was in the 1–1 draw against France on 2 September 2000. He appeared as a half-time substitute in England&#x27;s first 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Germany in the final match played at the old Wembley Stadium. After the resignation of Keegan, Barry was selected to start at left-back in England&#x27;s next qualifier away in Finland by caretaker coach Howard Wilkinson.

After Sven-Göran Eriksson&#x27;s appointment, Barry returned to play for the England under-21 team. The emergence of Ashley Cole and Wayne Bridge as England&#x27;s first- and second-choice left-backs restricted Barry&#x27;s chances of a recall; however, he was named in May 2003 in England&#x27;s squad to play friendly matches against South Africa and Serbia &amp; Montenegro, making a late substitute appearance in both matches.

On 2 February 2007, Barry was recalled to the England squad, following a four-year international exile, by Eriksson&#x27;s replacement Steve McClaren. The midfielder had been resigned to never winning another cap under Eriksson. He was brought on at the beginning of the second half of the friendly match against Spain five days later, as substitute for Steven Gerrard, and played left midfield for the majority of the game, moving to left-back when Stewart Downing was brought on; England lost 1–0. On 25 May, Barry played for England B in a 3–1 victory over Albania, getting an assist for England&#x27;s first goal scored by Alan Smith.

In August 2007, Barry became one of the few players to represent England at both the old and new Wembley Stadiums by coming on as a substitute, replacing Michael Carrick in a friendly against Germany.

Barry started in central midfield for England against Israel on 8 September 2007, as a replacement for the injured Owen Hargreaves, and recorded two assists. He kept his place with Hargreaves declared unfit for the match against Russia on 12 September 2007, and produced another impressive display. BBC pundits Ian Wright and Alan Shearer commented that Barry was immense in the centre of midfield alongside Gerrard, forming a wonderful partnership together, and further commented that he should have been made man of the match overall for the two performances against Israel and Russia.

He was also given the official man of the match for England&#x27;s UEFA Euro 2008 home qualifier against Estonia. He was selected to start against Switzerland on 6 February 2008, England&#x27;s first match under new coach Fabio Capello. He was again selected to start in England&#x27;s friendly away to France on 26 March 2008. Barry scored his first international goal against Trinidad and Tobago on 1 June 2008; this completed a personal treble for Barry, as he also captained England in the second half of his 20th cap.

He appeared in every one of England&#x27;s ten games during the 2008–09 season up until the game against Andorra on 10 June 2009, for which he was suspended, having picked up yellow cards in the games against Ukraine and Kazakhstan. In the game against Kazakhstan on 6 June, he scored his second international goal on his 13th cap, heading home a cross from Steven Gerrard.

Playing for England in a friendly against Egypt at Wembley, Barry was handed the captaincy in a game that they won 3–1, with his then Manchester City teammate Shaun Wright-Phillips on the scoresheet. However, an ankle injury picked up while playing for Manchester City made him uncertain for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, yet he was included in the 23-man England squad for the tournament. He missed the first game but played in the remaining three games for England, including the full 90 minutes of the second-round 4–1 defeat against Germany in Bloemfontein, which sent England out of the competition.

On 9 February 2011, he was again made captain for the final 10 minutes of the match against Denmark, after Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole had already worn the skipper&#x27;s armband. On 29 March 2011, Barry skippered England against Ghana in a friendly match at Wembley in a 1–1 draw. On 4 June 2011, he was an unused substitute against Switzerland in a Euro 2012 qualifier at Wembley in a 2–2 draw. On 12 November 2011, he earned his 50th cap for England in the 1–0 win over Spain in a friendly after coming on as a substitute.

On 15 November 2011, Barry scored England&#x27;s 2,000th international goal in a 1–0 friendly win over Sweden.

Barry was called into the England squad for UEFA Euro 2012 but ruled out of the tournament after picking up a groin injury. He was forced off less than 30 minutes after being introduced as a half-time substitute in the pre-tournament friendly against Norway in Oslo on 26 May 2012.

==Personal life==
Barry married his childhood sweetheart Louise in the summer of 2007.

Barry is best friends with Michael Standing, who signed for Aston Villa on the same day as him from Brighton in 1997. The pair have known each other since they were both ten years old. In 2009, Barry appointed Standing as his new agent after terminating his partnership with previous agent Alex Black.

Barry&#x27;s nephew, Bradley Barry, is also a professional footballer.

In July 2018, his brother Marc died in a vehicle incident.

Barry has played for Temple Grafton Cricket Club in the Cotswold Hills League since 2019.

<doc id="1320908" wikidata="Q5169159" url="?curid=1320908" title="Copus massacre">
<text>The Copus massacre is a name given to a skirmish occurring on September 15, 1812, between American settlers and Lenape, Wyandot, and Mohawk Native Americans on the Ohio frontier during the War of 1812.

The massacre resulted from a misunderstanding between Reverend James Copus and the members of the Native American tribes. Copus was instructed to persuade the tribes to relocate to the Piqua Reservation before the United States would force them to do so.

However, even after reaching an agreement with the tribes, American soldiers razed the tribe&#x27;s homes, burning the entire village to the ground. Assuming Copus&#x27;s betrayal, the Native Americans then retaliated. The massacre is named for Reverend James Copus, who died during an attack on his house.

In addition to Reverend Copus, 3 American soldiers died in the conflict; 2 to 11 Lenape, Wyandot, and Mohawk people died. The American settlers were defending Charles Mill Lake, Ohio while the displaced Lenape, Wyandot, and Mohawk people were most likely retaliating against multiple forced displacements and the Americans&#x27; destruction of their homes.

==Background==
In the 18th century, European colonists arrived in what is today Pennsylvania and New York - i.e., the land of the Lenape, Wyandots, and Mohawks. Colonist organizations such as the &quot;New Jersey Association for Helping the Indians&quot; forcefully expelled tribes westward via forced migration, creating Wyandot, Mohawk, and Lenape settlements in states including Ohio. However, some Lenape and Wyandots were indigenous to Ohio.

Circa 1800, Ohio was the land of the Lenape, Wyandots, and Mohawks, some of which were expelled from other territories. Occasional white missionaries and trappers would visit the forests of Ohio, but the territory was considered Indian country.

The War of 1812 led to an increase in tension between Native Americans and the increasing number of settlers. The military feared that the British Army would recruit the Native Americans as allies. Colonel Samuel Kratzer received orders to remove the Native Americans, who were mostly from the Delaware tribe, to the Piqua Reservation as a precautionary measure, and he assigned Captain Douglas to the task.

Local reverend James Copus was originally from Greene County, Pennsylvania and moved into the valley of the Black Fork in 1809 with his wife and seven children (his name is listed in the 1811 tax records of the area). He was a trusted friend of the Native Americans and had settled several miles from Greentown. Thus, when the Delaware told Captain Douglas that they would not leave, he tried to convince Copus to persuade the Native Americans. At first, Copus refused to interfere against them and said that he would personally stand accountable for their conduct. Douglas told Copus that they were under orders and that if the Native Americans did not comply, there would be bloodshed. Copus then agreed to accompany the soldiers to Greentown and speak with the Native Americans, but not before being assured that their lives and property would be protected if they agreed to surrender. Copus reluctantly met with the council of elders and, after much persuasion and reassurance, the elders agreed to leave their village.

After the soldiers led the Greentown Natives on their march, several soldiers straggled behind, ransacked the village, and burned it to the ground. Seeing the smoke from their burning homes, the Native Americans felt that they had been double-crossed by Copus.

Following the deaths of some of his neighbors, including the Zimmer family, at the hands of Native Americans, Copus asked for protection and was moved with his family to a blockhouse. After several days, Copus decided that there was no longer any danger, so on September 14, 1812, nine militia soldiers (Captain Absalom Martin&#x27;s Company of Guernsey County, Ohio) were detailed to accompany him and his family to their home. Upon his return, he found that nothing had been disturbed, and Copus felt somewhat at ease. Later that afternoon, one of Copus&#x27; daughters Nancy Copus noticed a Native American at the edge of the woods but did not report the sighting.

== Attack at the Copus homestead ==
The following day, seven of the soldiers left to wash at a nearby spring, leaving their weapons near the house. The Native Americans attacked the men at the spring. Three fled to the woods. They were pursued by the Native Americans and two of them, Private George Shipley and Private John Tedrick, were tomahawked. The third man, Private Robert Warnock, was shot and mortally wounded.

The only soldier who regained the cabin was George Dye, who fought alongside John Shambaugh a neighbor to the Copus family. George Dye was wounded in the thigh by a musketball. As he came through the door, Copus was hit by a shot through his chest.

On the east of the cabin, there was a range of hills several hundred feet high covered with timber and large rocks, which afforded an excellent cover for the enemy and gave them a position from which they could fire down upon the cabin. The Native Americans besieged the cabin from the hill. The soldiers tore up the planks of the floor and placed them against the door to prevent the balls from penetrating to the interior of the cabin. Nancy Copus, a young child, was wounded in the knee by a ball that passed through the door. John Shambaugh shot and killed the attacker of Nancy Copus. One of the soldiers, George Launtz, had his arm broken by a ball and, reportedly, killed the attacker who wounded him.

The soldiers fought back from daybreak until midmorning, and as many as eleven Native Americans were killed. The Native Americans then retreated, killing the Copus&#x27; sheep on their way. As soon as the Native Americans disappeared, one of the soldiers crawled out through the roof of the cabin and went to the blockhouse for assistance. Captain Martin and his second in command, Sgt. John Bratton (son of pioneer James Bratton, the first settler in Ohio on 1799) had agreed to call at the Copus cabin the previous evening with a number of soldiers and remain all night. But he and his soldiers, having been scouting all day and finding no signs of Native Americans, concluded that there was no real danger. Therefore, they camped on the Black Fork and reached the Copus&#x27; cabin late on the morning of the attack. He and his soldiers attended to the wounded, and a search was made for the Native Americans but they were not found.

Copus and the dead soldiers, Shipley, Tedrick, and Warnock, were buried near the cabin. On the 70th anniversary of the battle, a monument was put up at the site of the killings by the Ashland County Pioneer Society. The unveiling of the monument, on September 15, 1882, was attended by 10,000 people including Copus daughter, Sarah Vail. A second monument was erected nearby to commemorate the victims of the Zimmer massacre.

== Legacy ==
On September 15, 1882, a group of Perrysville, Ohio residents unveiled the Copus Monument, a mass grave monument in memory of the white soldiers. 6,000 persons attended the event. In 1902, Ohio genealogist Henry Howe described the 1882 event:Early in the day the people began to arrive at the Copus Hill from every direction; a-foot, on horseback and in every imaginable kind of conveyance, until fully 6,000 had assembled in the forest overlooking the scene of the Copus battle. The day was balmy—one of those pleasant fall days—and the thousands present came with baskets filled ready for the pic-nic. The exercises opened with music by the Mt. Zion band, followed by prayer by Rev. J. A. HAIL, then music, then the address of welcome by the gentleman above named. ... Mrs. Sarah VAIL, daughter of James COPUS, who was present at the time her father and the three soldiers were killed, and who now resides hard by at the age of eighty-four years, was introduced to the multitude. ... at its close a procession of vehicles to the number of about 1,200 was formed and passed by the Copus Monument as it was unveiled. The multitude then proceeded to the Ruffner Monument, when it was also unveiled. Thus the ceremonies of the day ended; a day long to be remembered.Per the suggestion of local author and poet Rosella Rice, a cenotaph to John &quot;Johnny Appleseed&quot; Chapman was prominently added to the monument. Despite this, Chapman was not involved in the conflict. Rice is perhaps best known for her prose and poetry describing Chapman; her widely published works contributed to Chapman becoming a mythologized hero of American folklore.

<text>The Zimmer massacre was the massacre of four settlers by Native Americans in Mifflin Township, Ashland County, Ohio in September, 1812. Although the exact motive for the attack is unknown, the end result was that four settlers were killed, further increasing the distrust between Native Americans and settlers at the beginning of the War of 1812.

==Background==
In the early 1800s, tensions between Native Americans and newly arrived white settlers was very high. Forced Indian removal was causing tensions to rise, as Native Americans struggled to find a way to maintain peace with their neighbors who were forcefully removing them from their land of birth. After the Treaty of Greenville in 1795, many tribes felt wronged since they were not included in the negotiations, and tribes were forced off their land having had no input in the treaty, Shawnee chief Tecumseh being a noted critic. The War of 1812 also increased tensions between the two groups. These tensions were heightened by the forced removal of the Native Americans from their homes in Greentown (near Perrysville), and the subsequent burning of the town by soldiers.

===The Zimmer family===
Note: In some sources, the name &quot;Zimmer&quot; is given as &quot;Zeimer&quot; or &quot;Seymour&quot;. It is spelled &quot;Zimmer&quot; on the family gravestone.

The Zimmers were one of the early settler families in Mifflin Township; they are listed in the 1811 tax records, and settled about north of Greentown. At that time, Mifflin Township was part of Richland County, but became part of Ashland County upon its formation in 1846. The family consisted of Frederick Zimmer, his wife, and their children, Philip (17) and Kate.

===Martin Ruffner===
Like the Zimmers, Martin Ruffner was one of the early settlers in the area. He came from Shenandoah County, Virginia, and settled about from the Zimmers&#x27; cabin, accompanied by his mother, brother Michael, and a sister.

==The events of the killing==
Although accounts differ as to the exact details of the events and the numbers of Native Americans involved, there are common elements to the story. On September 10, 1812, Ruffner&#x27;s servant (or his brother, Michael) was stopped by a group of four–six Native Americans and asked about the Zimmers. When Ruffner heard about this encounter, he was concerned and went to the Zimmers&#x27; cabin, with his gun, to warn them. Ruffner arrived at the same time, or shortly before, the Native Americans and, fearing trouble, sent Philip Zimmer to warn nearby settlers and get assistance. Philip went to the cabins of James Copus and John Lambright, and both men returned with Philip to the Zimmers&#x27; cabin.

The men found the cabin dark and the front door open. There was blood inside the open doorway and, fearing that the Native Americans were still inside, they fled to the nearest blockhouse where there were soldiers stationed. A group of soldiers returned to the house and found Ruffner&#x27;s body in the yard. Inside the house, they found the bodies of the Zimmer family. 

The Native Americans involved were thought to be Greentown Native Americans who had been protesting resettlement. It is not known if any of them were murdered in the attack.

The possible motive behind the attacks was thought to be retribution for the forced removal of Native Americans and burning of their town of Greentown. 

==Aftermath==
In 1813, Philip Zimmer sold the family property for $1.50 per acre.

Two monuments were erected, by the Ashland County Pioneer Society, to mark the spots of the Zimmer massacre and the Copus massacre. On September 15, 1882, the dedication for the monuments was attended by 10,000 people, including one of the Copus children who had survived that attack.

In 1858, a fictional account of the massacre was written by Reverend James F. McGaw, titled &quot;Philip Seymour, or, Pioneer life in Richland County, Ohio: founded on facts&quot;. This book has given rise to several misunderstandings about the events surrounding the massacres, including the role of Johnny Appleseed.

<doc id="1320944" wikidata="Q650798" url="?curid=1320944" title="R.550 Magic">
<text>The R.550 Magic (backronym for &quot;Missile Auto-Guidé Interception et Combat&quot;) is a short-range air-to-air missile designed in 1965 by French company Matra to compete with the American AIM-9 Sidewinder, and it was made backwards compatible with the Sidewinder launch hardware.

== Development ==
Developed originally as a short-range infrared air-to-air missile, the R.550 was meant to be France&#x27;s lighter short-range missile, replacing the previous heavy R.530. During a trial on 11 January 1965, a Gloster Meteor of the centre for in-flight trials fired an R.550 Magic and shot down a Nord CT20 target drone. 

The Magic was then mass-produced from 1967, the Magic was adopted by the French Air Force and Navy for active service.

An upgraded version, the &quot;Magic 2&quot;, replaced the original model in 1986. In total, 11,300 Magics (7,000 Magic 1s and 4,000 Magic 2s) were produced; they were exported, notably to Iraq and Greece, who used them in combat.

The Magic has been used by the Dassault Rafale, Dassault Mirage 2000, F-16, Sea Harrier (FRS51), MiG-21, Super Étendard, Mirage F1, Mirage 5, and Mirage III. However, the R.550 is gradually being replaced by the MBDA MICA. 480 Magics were sold to Taiwan and is used by the Republic of China Air Force&#x27;s Mirage 2000s.

The PL-7 is the Chinese reversed-engineered version of the R.550 Magic 1.

== Description ==

The Magic has four fixed fins, four movable fins directly behind the fixed fins, and four notched fins on the tail. As the canards move to guide the missile to the target, small vortices generated by the canards impart roll moments on the tail fins, which can slow the roll attempted by the missile, or even roll reversal. To prevent interfering moments from the tail, the fins are mounted on bearings allowing the tail fins to spin freely. This is in contrast with the AIM-9, which makes use of &quot;rollerons,&quot; which are slipstream driven gyros mounted on the tail fins which stabilize the missile in three axes, and have no fixed fin &quot;canards&quot; forward of the moving fins. Its diameter is larger than the Sidewinder&#x27;s, which is 5 inches (127 mm) and a legacy of the US Navy&#x27;s five-inch rocket, from which the AIM-9 is derived; the larger diameter simplified engineering. It has a Romeo solid-fuel engine, and can engage the target independently from the firing aircraft with its all-aspect cooled infrared homing system. The homing system utilizes sulfur lead granting it a high sensitivity and immunity to noise, or thermal clutter. The missile can attain track through information transmitted (prior to launch) by the aircraft&#x27;s radar system, helmet mounted target designation system, optoelectronic sighting system, or through merely being pointed at the target and then being uncaged (allowing the seeker head to move freely on the gimbal onboard the missile). 

The missile has no minimum launch speed, making it a prime candidate for arming helicopters which often fly at significantly lower speeds than fighter fixed-wing platforms. It utilizes a silver-zinc battery to power its electronics. 

The missile features a 13kg pre-fragmented controlled splinter warhead which makes up 14.6% of the missile&#x27;s total weight, and uses a proximity fuse for detonation. The warhead is armed 1.8 seconds after launch, making its minimum WEZ (Weapon Employment Zone) 0.3 kilometers (0.18 miles). It utilizes a Richard single-stage butylene solid-propellant rocket for propulsion, propelling it to speeds up to Mach 3 for the Magic 1, and Mach 2 for the Magic 2. The missile can be outfitted on any aircraft capable of firing the AIM-9 Sidewinder. If the missile misses, it self-destructs after 26 seconds.

While the missile was satisfactory as a dogfight missile in the 1980s, it is outdated by today&#x27;s standards. The Magic 2 replaced the AD3601 seeker head by the all-aspect AD3633, allowing all-aspect capability (the Magic 1 can only be fired from the rear on the target). The Magic 1 has a transparent dome on its nose, while the Magic 2 is opaque. The Magic 2 also had a reduced amount of time required for the weapon to be prepared for launch. The seeker head has a gimbal limit of 30 degrees, meaning that it can track targets up to 30 degrees off of its boresight. Once launched, the R.550 Magic 1 is capable of withstanding 35g&#x27;s, and the Magic 2 capable of 50g&#x27;s.

==Operational history==
===Greece===
On 8 October 1996, 7 months after the escalation over Imia/Kardak a Greek Mirage 2000 fired an R550 Magic II and shot down a Turkish F-16D over the Aegean Sea. The Turkish pilot died, while the co-pilot ejected and was rescued by Greek forces. In August 2012, after the downing of a Turkish RF-4E on the Syrian Coast, in response to a parliamentary question, Turkish Defence Minister İsmet Yılmaz confirmed that Turkish F-16D Block 40 (s/n 91-0023) of 192 Filo was shot down by a Greek Mirage 2000 with an R.550 Magic II on 8 October 1996 in the disputed airspace near Chios island.

===South Africa===
The South African Air Force (SAAF) received a number of R.550 missiles before a widespread international arms embargo took effect in 1977. SAAF Mirage F1 aircraft carried the R.550. South African Mirage F1s fired early generation R550 missiles in combat over Angola against MiG-21 and MiG-23 adversaries on a number of occasions. In all but one case, the missiles failed to damage or destroy the MiGs. In an engagement between a Mirage F1CZ and MiG-21 in October 1982, two R.550s were fired by SAAF Major Rankin and one of them damaged the FAPLA MiG-21. The limited performance envelope of early generation R.550s led South Africa to begin developing an indigenous AAM called the V-3 Kukri.

<doc id="1320949" wikidata="Q2589078" url="?curid=1320949" title="Potter's House Christian Fellowship">
<text>The Potter&#x27;s House Christian Fellowship, commonly known as The Potter&#x27;s House, is a Pentecostal Christian organisation based in the United States of America. It was established in Prescott, Arizona, in 1970 by Wayman Mitchell. The Potter&#x27;s House was a member of the Foursquare church until 1983 when they separated to form a new independent fellowship.

The church has also been criticised in a number of areas including high levels of control, extreme commitment requirements, and the mistreatment of former members. It has been labelled by many ex-members as a cult. 

==Etymology==
The fellowship name the &quot;Potter&#x27;s House&quot; derives from the biblical text Jeremiah 18:2 Arise, and go down to the potter&#x27;s house, and there I will cause thee to hear my words. — &quot;Jeremiah 18:2 (King James Version)&quot;

==Beliefs==
The Potter&#x27;s House Statement of Faith contains the central beliefs of the church. The articles of faith are summarised as below:

• There is one true God, and He exists as a Trinity: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
• God the Father created the universe and mankind. After man&#x27;s fall He invited mankind back for reconciliation through Christ.
• Jesus Christ is eternally God. He was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the Virgin Mary. 
• The Holy Spirit is eternally God, given in completion to the Church at Pentecost and works to empower, guide and align Christians to Christ.

• Baptism in the Holy Spirit, after conversion, is evidenced with the fruits and gifts of the Holy Spirit and speaking in tongues.

• The Bible is the infallible, eternal and final Word of God with ultimate authority. It contains the fullness of what is required to live a Christian life.

• Christ&#x27;s death on the cross made full atonement for the world&#x27;s sins. Atonement also provides healing of body, soul, and spirit.

• Salvation is given through the death of Christ and is received through faith toward Christ and repentance toward God.

• Christians are to live a life separated and dedicated to God. &quot;The shortcomings of the individual are because of the still progressing sanctification of the saints&quot;. 
• The Church is the Body of Christ consisting of those who are born of the Spirit. The work of the church is to fulfil the Great Commission. 
• Water Baptism, done in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, is a sign of the believer identifying with the death, burial and resurrection of Christ.

• The Lord&#x27;s Supper is done to commemorate the death of Jesus and is a sign of &quot;participation in Him&quot;. 
• The second coming of Christ, millennium and final judgement.

• The final judgement will be the final determination of the eternal state for all mankind &quot;determined by their relationship to Jesus Christ&quot;.

==History==
===Beginnings: 1969–1989===
In 1969, Wayman Mitchell asked for a ministerial position and was appointed to serve as the minister of the Foursquare church in Prescott, Arizona. Mitchell promoted personal witnessing which saw much church growth, primarily from the youth of the hippie movement and resulted in an overflowing church by the early seventies. Mitchell began to establish new churches which were originally called The Door (and later, these churches were called the Potter&#x27;s House), first within Arizona and interstate, then overseas. Mitchell discouraged his disciples from attending bible schools due to his own negative experiences in them so the men who he sent out did not receive full ordinations from Foursquare. According to Nathaniel Van Cleave, Mitchell permitted only his own style of primitive and militant evangelism, isolated his disciples from other Foursquare ministers and as a group, they walked out of conference meetings that they disagreed with. Although Mitchell was the state superintendent, he only focused on his own churches, excluding all other Foursquare churches that were under his care. Over time, this caused resentment among the excluded congregations and at least one church left the denomination as a result.

At the 1983 Foursquare convention, a large number of pastors brought complaints against Mitchell to the executive council meeting. Mitchell made no attempt to respond to the complaints. Instead, he and his followers left the conference. A special meeting was later held with Mitchell in an attempt to establish understanding and continued fellowship but this attempt was unsuccessful. Within weeks, Mitchell and the churches which he had planted severed their ties with Foursquare and became an independent fellowship.

===Since 1990===
In 1990, approximately 100 churches split from the Potter&#x27;s House. Larry Neville stated that the split was partially due to restrictions which prevented them from maturing and enlarging their expressions of faith.

In 2001, a second split occurred, with around 160 churches leaving the fellowship.

Wayman Mitchell died on September 21, 2020, in Prescott, Arizona.

==Statistics==
As of July 2023, Christian Fellowship Ministries has over 3460 churches worldwide.

== Conferences ==
Annual week-long conferences are a feature of national leadership churches throughout the fellowship with 55 recorded conference centres as of 2022.

==Doctrine and practice==
The Potter&#x27;s House Christian Fellowship holds Pentecostal beliefs with a strong emphasis on evangelism, church planting, and discipleship. Doctrines include salvation by faith, the infallibility of the bible, faith healing, and the second coming of Jesus Christ.

A program of evangelism is promoted with regular outreach events scheduled including, but not limited to, street evangelism, music concerts, movie nights, and revival meetings, with the intention of converting people and increasing church membership.

A major goal of the church is the establishment of new churches, commonly referred to as church planting. This is achieved through the in-house training of pastors who are then sent to start a new church. Local congregations, both new and established, have no say over who leads the church. Pastors in the Potter&#x27;s House do not receive any formal theological training as this is considered a waste of time and bible college is believed to cause those wanting to become pastors to lose their passion for the church. Instead, the church uses a process called discipleship, a type of on-the-job training where men wanting to become ministers are mentored by their pastor for three years before starting their own church. These new pastors then go on to repeat the process by training their own disciples to start new churches. Women in the church are not encouraged to pursue careers as the church believes their place is in the home supporting their husbands.

Faith healing is another belief held by the church, which holds faith healing meetings and invites the public to attend. According to Kenneth Whelan, people can be healed if they forgive all sins committed against them and become Christians. Meetings generally consist of singing, a request for donations, a sermon, and an altar call, which is a request for people to come to the front and repent. After this, people are called to the front to be prayed for healing.

The church believes that participating in sin can result in physical problems. Homosexuality can cause deafness, and idol worship can cause problems with eyesight. Breast cancer is linked to hatred of husbands, unforgiveness and gossip, and cervical cancer is linked to the &quot;curse of promiscuity&quot;.

Financial support for the church comes from the collection of tithes from its members (donating 10% of a member&#x27;s gross income) and each church in turn also pays a tithe. Financial offerings over and above the tithe are also encouraged. According to an investigation by Chris Hayes, the church financial structure is set up in a pyramid structure, with each church sending 5% of its offering back to its Mother church and another 5% back to the head church in Prescott.

==Criticism and controversy==
The Potter&#x27;s House has received much criticism throughout its existence and has been labelled by many as a cult. Major areas of criticism include the level of control exerted over its members, the intense level of commitment required, and the shunning and mistreatment of those who have left the church.

=== Controlling behaviour ===
Lee Stubbs, a former fellowship pastor, stated that the church uses a subtle form of conditioning. &quot;It&#x27;s not some maniacal thing of someone demanding blood, but the leaders have a very persuasive power over people. There was a system of things in place that directed our lives.&quot;
While new members are given love and attention to make them want to stay in the church, many former pastors and members have stated that church techniques are designed to keep those in the congregation submissive, employing fear tactics, public ridicule, and shunning to ensure compliance.
Members are told not to question the pastor&#x27;s leadership and those who do so are considered rebellious. According to Stubbs, loyalty to the pastor is equated to loyalty to God.
While the church has stated numerous times publicly that people are free to leave if they choose, former members have stated that pastors create a fear that if they do leave, they will be out of the will of God, their lives will fall apart, and they will go to hell. In one case, the parents of a former member were killed in a car accident shortly after she left the church. The church blamed the deaths on the ex-member for leaving.

=== Level of commitment ===
The church requires an intense level of commitment from its members and uses psychological and emotional pressure to enforce that commitment. Stubbs stated that commitment to the church is constantly reinforced with phrases such as, &quot;Every time the doors are open, you need to be here. You need to stay on fire for God. You need to be involved. You need to be committed. You need to be loyal.&quot; Members will spend up to seven nights a week at church in their commitment to the fellowship and have reported getting in trouble for leaving services early.

=== Shunning and mistreatment ===
According to numerous former pastors and members, anyone leaving the church is considered to be a rebel and a backslider. Current members are told not to have anything to do with them and they will often be condemned from the pulpit. This can include not just the shunning of friends but the turning of family members against each other. In cases where interaction does occur, former members have reported receiving harassing letters and phone calls, and being slandered through rumours. In one case, church leaders were instructed to publicly renounce a pastor who had left the group.
Former members have consistently reported that time in the church has led to traumatic experiences both to individuals and to families. A therapist described the symptoms of one couple who had left the church as similar to those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.
A court prevented a man from taking his 5-year-old daughter to the church after she was diagnosed with PTSD as a result of being traumatised by the pastor. The pastor had dressed up like the devil and placed the girl&#x27;s hands into a bucket of fake blood with a cow&#x27;s heart in it and yelled at her that she would never get her hand out. The pastor did not deny the event and stated that it was good to have some fear in your life.
Others stated the church had robbed them of self esteem and independence, and left them feeling spiritually shattered, while others said their involvement with the church led to divorce.

=== Lack of pastoral training ===
Former pastors of the church have noted that not only do pastors have little experience when they are sent out but because the church does not send men to bible school, they are also poorly equipped in understanding the bible which leads to indoctrination in Potter&#x27;s House methodology rather than having a bible-based background.

=== Cult ===
The intensity of involvement and indoctrination by the church has led to many former members labelling the group a cult. The church has been accused of brainwashing its members resulting in the blind following of church beliefs and the division of families. Any doubts or questioning of the church is attributed to lying spirits and the voice of the devil, and is considered akin to doubting God. Rick Ross, a cult expert with extensive experience dealing with former Potter&#x27;s House members, stated that while he does not consider the church to be a cult, it is a destructive group very close to being a cult.

=== Rape ===
In 1984, church member Debbie Christensen told her pastor, Paul Campo, that she had been raped by another church member. Christensen stated that when she told Campo about the rape, he told her she probably deserved it and not to tell anyone else about it. Campo responded in a letter to &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; stating that after Christensen told him about the alleged rape, he spoke with the accused rapist who convinced him that the sex was consensual. Christensen&#x27;s mother also spoke with Campo about the alleged rape, who told her it was Christensen&#x27;s fault and there was nothing he could do.
Church founder Wayman Mitchell contradicted Campo&#x27;s claim in another letter to &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot;, stating that Christensen had not told Campo that she had been raped as he would have told her to go to the authorities and press charges. Mitchell stated that Christensen claimed she was raped because she was bitter and vindictive.

=== Homophobia ===
The church holds a homophobic position in relation to the LGBTQI community and has screened anti-gay movies to the public. In a 2009 interview with the &quot;Waikato Times&quot;, Scott McGrath stated that although it was still considered a sin, the church had softened its stance on homosexuality and would accept gay, lesbian, and transgender members. However, in 2018 founder Wayman Mitchell was recorded using a homophobic slur while preaching in Guam, referring to homosexuals as &quot;little faggots&quot; and claiming that the gay community was miserable. Mitchell&#x27;s use of derogatory remarks from the pulpit had been previously noted in a report by Charisma magazine.

=== Intellectual property theft ===
In August 2022 a Texan church performed a rewritten version of the stage show &quot;Hamilton&quot; over two nights without obtaining the rights to do so. Representatives for &quot;Hamilton&quot; were made aware of the production and issued a cease-and-desist letter for unauthorized use of intellectual property. The Dramatists Guild, who represent playwrights, composers and lyricists, condemned the church for the unauthorized performance. After speaking with &quot;Hamilton&quot; lawyers, the church was allowed to proceed with its Saturday evening performance on the condition that it was not live-streamed or recorded, that photos and videos were not posted, and no further productions were performed. However, at the time the &quot;Hamilton&quot; team was unaware of the changes to the lyrics or the anti-LGBTQ+ sermon presented at the end of the show. A spokesman for &quot;Hamilton&quot; said they were &quot;in the process of reviewing the unauthorized changes made to the script to determine further action.&quot; In late August, Roman Gutierrez, the church&#x27;s pastor, issued an apology to &quot;Hamilton&quot;&#x27;s creator, Lin-Manuel Miranda, promising to destroy all images, video, and sound recordings of their production and agreed to never stage the performance again. The church also agreed to pay damages for their actions. &quot;Hamilton&quot; representatives stated all damages would be donated to the South Texas Equality Project, a nonprofit coalition supporting the LGBTQ community. The church had previously performed an unauthorized, rewritten performance of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; in 2018.

=== Police fatalities ===
On April 22, 2020, four Victorian police officers were killed when truck driver Mohinder Singh ran off the road and into the officers who had stopped another vehicle. Prior to leaving the depot, Singh had informed his supervisor, Simiona Tuteru, that he was too tired to drive, was &quot;seeing things&quot; and had been cursed by a witch. Rather than sending him home to rest, Singh stated that Tuteru, who was a pastor and missionary for the Potter&#x27;s House church, searched Singh&#x27;s car for voodoo dolls, then put his hand on Singh&#x27;s head and prayed for him to have the curse removed. Tuteru then told Singh he was &quot;right to go&quot; on the delivery and could go home afterwards. The fatalities occurred a short time afterwards.
Tuteru was initially charged with four counts of manslaughter, but these were later dropped in favour of heavy vehicle charges. A judge later put the case permanently on hold due to &quot;oppressive&quot; misuse of court processes.
David Vicary, former head pastor of the Australian Potter&#x27;s House churches, said in an interview that although the church had good people in it, it was a bad system that led people to hold extreme positions. He further stated that the church leaders were not accountable to anyone outside of themselves which led to tragedies such as this. In 2023, &quot;60 Minutes Australia&quot; investigated the links between the fatalities and the church. Their investigation was aired in April 2023.

<doc id="1320974" wikidata="Q1182503" url="?curid=1320974" title="Deerstalker">
<text>A deerstalker is a type of cap that is typically worn in rural areas, often for hunting, especially deer stalking. Because of the cap&#x27;s popular association with the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes, it has become stereotypical headgear for a detective, especially in comical drawings or cartoons along with farcical plays and films.
==Construction==
According to Sean M. Wright, writer and member of The Baker Street Irregulars (&quot;The Manor House Case&quot;), who has constructed dozens of them, the deerstalker is most often made of cloth, often light or heavy wool tweed, although deerstalkers made of suede, white cotton duck, and even fur or denim are not unknown. &quot;I even made one for the late Los Angeles attorney Robert Landon Kirste,&quot; said Sean, &quot;who asked me to make a deerstalker of black velvet for formal occasions. When I asked if he wanted white ribbon to tie the earflaps, he demurred. &#x27;I don&#x27;t want to stand out,&#x27; he explained.”

The cap is made of six (or eight) triangular panels with rounded sides, which are sewn together. If the sides of the panels are cut in a way giving them slightly rounded shoulders midway, the crown will become more squared and flatter rather than hemispherical. The cap may be deep or shallow, barely touching the tops of the ears, according to the whim of the hatter. Either way, it is usually lined with an inner cap of satin, polished cotton, or similar lining fabrics. Occasionally, one can find a deerstalker with a lightly quilted satin lining. 

The deerstalker&#x27;s defining feature is a pair of semicircular bills or visors worn in front and rear. The dual bills provide protection from the sun for the face and neck of the wearer during extended periods outdoors, such as for hunting or fishing. These are usually stiffened with pasteboard, cardboard, or layers of heavy canvas. For a brief period during the 1970s, some deerstalkers were manufactured with bills stiffened by the steam-cooked and pressure-molded wood-fiber construct called Masonite. The Masonite tended to crack and break into segments, and over time, was also apt to crumble at the corners.

Along with its visors, a deerstalker often, though not essentially, has a pair of unstiffened cloth earflaps attached to either side of the cap. These are tied together by grosgrain ribbons or by laces or, very occasionally, held together by snaps or a button. The earflaps, tied under the chin, provide protection in cold weather and high winds. They are otherwise tied together above the crown to keep them out of the way.

Deerstalkers may be made of solid-coloured material, but they are most often found with houndstooth check, herringbone, or plaid patterns in the twill of a fabric that serves as camouflage. Modern hunting clothes, including deerstalkers, are often made with either a red-and-black or an orange-and-black check pattern or tweed for both this purpose and hunter safety, not least in actual deer stalking, for which purpose milliners originally constructed this type of cap.

==Variations==
The &quot;sportsman&#x27;s deerstalker&quot; is made with a brim around the cap, narrow at the sides, but which may be elongated in front or back, omitting the separate double bills. The earflaps are also eliminated. Some types of this cap sport a hatband fashioned from the same material around the crown. The &quot;flapless&quot; version can be easily folded for convenient carrying. 

The variants of the &quot;Irish&quot; style deerstalker are minor but significant. The cap is fronted with a cloth panel instead of the usual seam. The earflaps, wide and triangular in the standard version, are narrow with straight sides. The usual semicircular visors may be replaced by short, rectangular bills. George C. Scott wore this type of deerstalker as a jurist who imagines himself to be Sherlock Holmes in the 1971 film &quot;They Might be Giants&quot;.

Also, a reversible deerstalker is made that looks like the standard, double-billed model, but it can be turned inside out, revealing an entirely different fabric or even suede, with the contrasting earflaps of the original fabric turned backward and tied together. Other caps with earflaps, e.g. &quot;trapper&quot; and &quot;ushanka&quot;, are not considered deerstalkers, as they lack fore and aft symmetrical bills, the defining feature of a deerstalker cap.

==Alternative names==
The deerstalker cap is also known as a &quot;fore-and-aft&quot; cap in reference to its front and rear bills. This headgear is also called a &quot;tweed helmet&quot;, due to its resemblance in design to the balaclava helmet worn by officers in the British army during the Crimean War. It has no connection to the pith helmet.

Because the detective is often depicted wearing a deerstalker in books and theatrical and television films, some people call the cap a &quot;Sherlock&quot;.

==Sherlock Holmes==
The most famous wearer of a deerstalker is the fictional character Sherlock Holmes, who is popularly depicted as favouring this style of cap. Holmes is never explicitly described as wearing a deerstalker by name in Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s stories, although in &quot;The Adventure of Silver Blaze&quot;, the narrator, Dr. Watson, describes him as wearing &quot;his ear-flapped travelling cap&quot;, and in &quot;The Boscombe Valley Mystery&quot;, as wearing a &quot;close-fitting cloth cap&quot;. As the deerstalker is the most typical cap of the period matching both descriptions, not surprisingly, the original illustrations for the stories by Sidney Paget (who favored a deerstalker himself) in the United Kingdom, and Frederic Dorr Steele in the United States, along with other illustrators of the period, depicted Holmes as a &quot;deerstalker man&quot;, which then became the popular perception of him.

Later, less-informed depictions of Holmes have him wearing this cap in the city, failing to take into account the fact that the fashion-conscious Holmes would be loath to commit such a sartorial faux pas; the deerstalker is traditionally a rural outdoorsman&#x27;s cap. It is not appropriate headgear for the properly dressed urban gentleman. Still, while contemporaneous illustrators portrayed Holmes as wearing a deerstalker in the proper setting for such attire, travelling cross-country or operating in a rural outdoor setting, Paget chose to depict Holmes as wearing the deerstalker in London while keeping vigil for the appearance of the murderous Colonel Sebastian Moran in illustrations made for &quot;The Empty House&quot; when the story first appeared in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in 1904. This is uncharacteristic of Paget, who most often depicts Holmes wearing a black top hat and frock coat in the city, as shown in the Regent Street scene in &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;, or sporting a black bowler when wearing a black or plaid Inverness cape (or, more accurately, a cape-coat) as seen in his illustrations for &quot;The Blue Carbuncle&quot; and &quot;The Musgrave Ritual&quot;, respectively.

<text>Carboplatin, sold under the brand name Paraplatin among others, is a chemotherapy medication used to treat a number of forms of cancer. This includes ovarian cancer, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, brain cancer, and neuroblastoma. It is administered by injection into a vein sometimes via a port (medicine).
Side effects generally occur. Common side effects include low blood cell levels, nausea, and electrolyte problems. Other serious side effects include allergic reactions and mutagenesis. It may be carcinogenic, but further research is needed to confirm this. Use during pregnancy may result in harm to the baby. Carboplatin is in the platinum-based antineoplastic family of medications and works by interfering with duplication of DNA.
Carboplatin was developed as a less toxic analogue of cisplatin. It was patented in 1972 and approved for medical use in 1989. It is on the 2023 World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

==Medical uses==
Carboplatin is used to treat a number of forms of cancer. This includes ovarian cancer, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, brain cancer, and neuroblastoma. It may be used for some types of testicular cancer but cisplatin is generally more effective. It has also been used to treat triple-negative breast cancer. Carboplatin has also been used for adjuvant therapy of stage 1 seminomatous testicular cancer. Research has indicated that it is not less effective than adjuvant radiotherapy for this treatment, while having fewer side effects. This has led to carboplatin based adjuvant therapy being generally preferred over adjuvant radiotherapy in clinical practice.

==Side effects==
Relative to cisplatin, the greatest benefit of carboplatin is its reduced side effects, particularly the elimination of nephrotoxic effects. Nausea and vomiting are less severe and more easily controlled.

The main drawback of carboplatin is its myelosuppressive effect. This causes the blood cell and platelet output of bone marrow in the body to decrease quite dramatically, sometimes as low as 10% of its usual production levels. The nadir of this myelosuppression usually occurs 21–28 days after the first treatment, after which the blood cell and platelet levels in the blood begin to stabilize, often coming close to its pre-carboplatin levels. This decrease in white blood cells (neutropenia) can cause complications, and is sometimes treated with drugs like filgrastim. The most notable complication of neutropenia is increased probability of infection by opportunistic organisms, which necessitates hospital readmission and treatment with antibiotics.

==Mechanism of action==
Carboplatin differs from cisplatin in that it has a bidentate dicarboxylate (the ligand is cyclobutane dicarboxylate, CBDCA) in place of the two chloride ligands. Both drugs are alkylating agents. CBDCA and chloride are the leaving groups in these respective drugs Carboplatin exhibits slower aquation (replacement of CBDCA by water) and thus slower DNA binding kinetics, although it forms the same reaction products &quot;in vitro&quot; at equivalent doses with cisplatin. Unlike cisplatin, carboplatin may be susceptible to alternative mechanisms. Some results show that cisplatin and carboplatin cause different morphological changes in MCF-7 cell lines while exerting their cytotoxic behaviour. The diminished reactivity limits protein-carboplatin complexes, which are excreted. The lower excretion rate of carboplatin means that more is retained in the body, and hence its effects are longer lasting (a retention half-life of 30 hours for carboplatin, compared to 1.5-3.6 hours in the case of cisplatin).

Like cisplatin, carboplatin binds to and cross-links DNA, interfering with the replication and suppressing growth of the cancer cell.

===Dose Calculation - Calvert Equation===
Prior to 1989, most carboplatin dosing used body surface area dosing as with other chemotherapy. However, toxicity from treatment was variable, and therefore Professor Hillary Calvert (University of Newcastle) developed a formula to dose carboplatin based on renal function.

Calvert&#x27;s formula considers the creatinine clearance and the desired area under curve. After 24 hours, close to 70% of carboplatin is excreted in the urine unchanged. This means that the dose of carboplatin must be adjusted for any impairment in kidney function.

Calvert formula: formula_1

The typical area under the curve (AUC) for carboplatin ranges from 3-7 (mg/ml)*min. GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) is a measure or estimate of kidney function. This is either measured, by measuring clearance of a radioisotope or estimated using serum and (sometimes) urine creatine measurements.

The Calvert formula was developed in 18 patients with GFR measurements up to 133ml/min. It&#x27;s applicability at very high doses of carboplatin has been challenged and in the US the Food and Drug Administration has recommended capping GFR at 125ml/min. This may be more important where dosing is based on calculations using more modern methods of creatinine measurement. The approach is not supported by all clinicians and certainly less so in those treating seminomas.

== Synthesis ==
Cisplatin reacts with silver nitrate and then cyclobutane-1,1-dicarboxylic acid to form carboplatin.
==History==
Carboplatin, a cisplatin analogue, was developed by Bristol Myers Squibb and the Institute of Cancer Research in order to reduce the toxicity of cisplatin. It gained U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for carboplatin, under the brand name Paraplatin, in March 1989. Starting in October 2004, generic versions of the drug became available.

<doc id="1321006" wikidata="Q1234955" url="?curid=1321006" title="Priapeia">
<text>The Priapeia (or Carmina Priapea) is a collection of eighty (in some editions ninety-five) anonymous short Latin poems in various meters on subjects pertaining to the phallic god Priapus. They are believed to date from the 1st century AD or the beginning of the 2nd century. A traditional theory about their origin is that they are an anthology of poems written by various authors on the same subject. However, it has recently been argued that the 80 poems are in fact the work of a single author, presenting a kind of biography of Priapus from his vigorous youth to his impotence in old age.

==Overview==
Not counting the last few poems, which seem not to be part of the original collection, the Priapeia consists of 80 epigrams (average length 6 to 8 lines) mainly written in either hendecasyllables or elegiac couplets, with a few also in scazons. Many of the epigrams are written as though they were to be engraved on the walls of a shrine containing a statue of the god Priapus that stood in the midst of gardens as the protector of the fruits that grew in them. These statues, usually carved from wood, were in the form of a man with a huge phallus, carrying a sickle in one hand. The statues, painted red to signify sexual prowess, also promoted the gardens’ fertility.

Most of the poems in the collection are monologues by Priapus himself. In them the god congratulates and praises himself for the size and virility of his sexual parts and issues fearful warnings to those who would trespass upon his garden or attempt to steal its fruits, threatening such miscreants with various punishments of a sexual nature, such as irrumation and sodomy. The poems are notable for their use of obscene words and ideas in combination with refined and elegant diction.

In the past one theory was that the &quot;Priapeia&quot; were the work of a group of poets who met at the house of Maecenas, amusing themselves by writing tongue-in-cheek tributes to the garden Priapus. (Maecenas was Horace’s patron.) Others, including Martial and Petronius, were thought to have added more verses in imitation of the originals. However, since a study by the German scholar Vinzenz Buchheit in 1962, the theory has gained ground that they are the work of a single poet illustrating Priapus&#x27;s decline from a vigorous youth to an impotent old age. The first two poems are a dedication by the author and the last one is a prayer to Priapus to increase the sexual prowess of the poet himself.

In 1890, the &quot;Priapeia&quot; were translated into English by Leonard Smithers and Sir Richard Burton (the latter of whom also freely translated &quot;The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night&quot;), who provided numerous glosses concerning the sexual practices and proclivities that are referenced in the poems. These explanatory notes address such diverse topics as oral sex (fellatio and cunnilingus), irrumation, masturbation, bestiality, sexual positions, eunuchism, phalli, religious prostitution, aphrodisiacs, pornography, and sexual terminology, but are not always accurate scholarly reflections of ancient Roman practices. A more recent translation titled &quot;The Priapus Poems&quot; has been carried out by Richard W. Hooper.

In their &quot;Introduction&quot; to the &quot;Priapeia&quot;, Smithers and Burton claim that &quot;The worship of Priapus amongst the Romans was derived from the Egyptians, who, under the form of Apis, the Sacred Bull, adored the generative Power of Nature,&quot; adding that &quot;the Phallus was the ancient emblem of creation, and representative of the gods Bacchus, Priapus, Hermaphroditus, Hercules, Shiva, Osiris, Baal and Asher, who were all Phallic deities.&quot;

==Authorship==
Although even today some scholars hold that the Carmina Priapea are anthology of poems by different authors, others support the arguments for the single authorship of all 80 poems.

Among these arguments are the following. First, the poems seem to have been carefully arranged according to metre. Only three metres are used. There appear to be 5 groups of 14 poems each. The first fourteen poems alternate between elegiac couplets and hendecasyllables. In the second to fifth groups the alternation is not so regular, but each group contains exactly 7 poems in hendecasyllables and 7 poems in either elegiac couplets or scazons. The scazon poems are arranged two in the 3rd group, two in the 4th, and two in the 5th. The last ten poems consist of a coda of 4 poems in elegiac couplets, 3 in hendecasyllables, 2 in scazons, and 1 poem in elegiac couplets. Kloss argues that if the poems were a miscellaneous anthology, they would presumably have contained poems in other metres too, such as the iambic (84 and 87), aeolic (85, 89) or hexameter (95) metres used in the &quot;extra&quot; poems in Smithers and Burton&#x27;s edition.

Further, in the second dedicatory poem, the poet announces that he has written (not collected together) the poems: &quot;Playfully, without taking too much trouble, I have written these poems, which as you can witness, Priapus, are more suitable for a garden than for a book of poems&quot;:

:&quot;lūdēns haec ego teste tē, Priāpe,hortō carmina digna, nōn libellō,scrīpsī nōn nimium labōriōsē&quot;

A third argument is based on the observation that pairs of consecutive or near-consecutive poems are often linked by the repetition of a word. For example, the rare word &quot;erucarum&quot; (rocket) in 46.8 is repeated in &quot;erucis&quot; in 47.6; &quot;Maurae ... puellae&quot; in 45.3 is echoed by &quot;puella Mauro&quot; in 46.1; &quot;virgineum locum&quot; in 2.5 reappears as &quot;virgo ... loci&quot; in 3.7, and so on. There are also possibly wider links between the poems. For example, Laure Sandoz sees a connection between the words &quot;membrōsior&quot; in 1.5, &quot;mentulātior&quot; in 36.11, and &quot;sarcinōsior&quot; (or in some texts &quot;fascinōsior&quot;) in 79.4, all meaning &quot;endowed with a larger penis&quot;, at the beginning, middle, and end of the collection, with the last two words both in the last line of a scazon poem.

On the other hand, the poet also clearly aims at variety. For example, in the first group of 14 poems, the god&#x27;s oversized phallus is referred to in a number of different ways (&quot;mentula&quot;, &quot;partī&quot;, &quot;inguen&quot;, &quot;tēlum&quot;, &quot;columna&quot; and so on).

Another argument concerns the subject matter of the poems themselves, which like the collections of love poetry of the poets of the time of Augustus, show the course of an affair from its beginning to its end. In the first group of fourteen poems, Priapus is shown as boastful and vigorous, but gradually problems set in. In poem 26 he confesses that he is worn out by sex (&quot;effutūtus&quot;) and thin and pale (&quot;macerque pallidusque&quot;) and complains that the neighbouring women give him no rest. In poem 33, on the other hand, he complains that he is compelled to relieve himself with his own hand for want of female companions among the nymphs. Towards the end of the book the problems multiply. In poem 56 he is mocked by a thief and shown the middle finger (&quot;impudīcum digitum&quot;) because his phallus is only made of wood, and he is reduced to calling on his master to perform the punishment. In poem 70 he has become so impotent that he has to endure the humiliation of a dog performing &quot;fellatio&quot; on him all night. In poem 76 we learn that Priapus is now old and grey-haired and only good for penetrating old men. In 77 he complains that because of a hedge round the garden he is no longer getting any sex. Finally, in 79, an anonymous speaker informs Priapus that he is no better endowed than &quot;our poet&quot; – who, it appears from the final poem, has an unusually small penis.

The date of the &quot;Carmina Priapea&quot; is still disputed, though is generally assumed to be in the 1st century AD. One piece of evidence for the date of the collection is the phrase &quot;inepta locī&quot; (&quot;foolish ... of the place&quot;) which occurs in poem 3.8 in connection with a girl who offers her backside to her husband on her wedding night instead of the usual place. The same phrase, in a similar context, is quoted in Seneca the Elder (&quot;Contr.&quot; 1.2.22), where it is called &quot;Ovidiānum illud&quot; (&quot;that Ovidian phrase&quot;). Some scholars have assumed therefore that poem 3 of the collection at least was composed by Ovid. However, the German scholar Gerrit Kloss argues that this is not necessarily so. It could be that &quot;inepta locī&quot; simply imitates a lost poem of Ovid, rather than being the first instance of its use. The same poem contains a number of other literary echoes of phrases used by Ovid, Virgil, and Horace.

Another piece of evidence is that certain words in the poems, such as &quot;circitor&quot; (&quot;watchman&quot;), &quot;rubricatus&quot; (&quot;painted red&quot;), &quot;prūrīgo&quot; (&quot;sexual desire&quot;) and so on, are not used until writers of the time of Nero or later. Assuming that all the poems are by a single author, then the whole collection can be dated to the time of Nero or later.

A number of arguments from prosody have also been put forward by H. Tränkle (1998) in an attempt to date the poems. For example, it has been argued that the long &quot;-ō&quot; in spondaic words like &quot;virgō&quot; and &quot;ergō&quot; (in 11 out of 13 cases in the &quot;Carmina Priapea&quot;) is closer to Ovid&#x27;s practice than that of Martial, where the &quot;-o&quot; is usually short. However, Kloss points out that this argument is weak, since other writers later than Ovid, such as Petronius and Silius Italicus also preferred the long &quot;-ō&quot;.

Buchheit (1962) found sufficient echoes of Martial to argue that the poems must date from after Martial&#x27;s time. Kloss (2003) is less certain, but thinks that the poems date at the earliest to Nero&#x27;s time, but more probably to a period after Martial.

==Other Priapic poems==
The 80 poems of the &quot;Carmina Priapea&quot; are by no means the only poems which survive from the ancient world in honour of Priapus. Kytzler&#x27;s edition contains 37 poems in Greek excerpted from the Greek anthology dating from the 3rd century BC to the 6th century AD. 

In Latin, outside the &quot;Corpus Priapeorum&quot; there are about 23 &quot;Priapea&quot; of various types, some of which are added as poems 83–95 in Smithers and Burton&#x27;s edition of the &quot;Priapeia&quot;.

The earliest extant Priapic poem in Latin (no. 89 in Smithers and Burton) appears to be Catullus fragment 1, which is written in the &quot;Priapean&quot; metre (a type of aeolic). It begins:

:&quot;hunc lūcum tibi dēdicō cōnsecrōque, Priāpe&quot;
::&quot;I dedicate and consecrate this grove to you, Priapus&quot;

Three poems in the collected works of Catullus (16, 47, and 56) are also judged to be Priapic in character. Catullus&#x27;s famous threat to &quot;sodomise and irrumate&quot; (&quot;pēdīcābo ego vōs et irrumābō&quot;) his friends Aurelius and Furius (Catullus 16) is imitated in the passive voice in &quot;Priapea&quot; 35 (&quot;pēdīcāberis irrumāberisque&quot;).

Among works of other poets, Horace &quot;Satires&quot; 1.8 (included as no. 95 in Smithers and Burton&#x27;s edition of the &quot;Priapeia&quot;) is a 50-line poem in hexameters in which Priapus recounts how the garden he was guarding, a former graveyard, was plagued by witches until suddenly the wood of his backside split open with a loud farting noise and scared them off. 

Four anonymous poems in the Appendix Vergiliana (nos. 86, 87, 88, and 84 of Smithers and Burton&#x27;s edition of the &quot;Priapeia&quot;) are also Priapic. In the first, the god describes his sufferings in the winter; in the second he describes his guardianship of the farm throughout the seasons, and demands respect from a passer-by; in the third, he warns some boys not to steal from his farm but to go to the neighbour&#x27;s farm instead. 

In the fourth poem, the anonymous poet addresses Priapus and chides him for causing him to become impotent when sleeping with a boy. Both this and the short prayer to Priapus to protect a farm (no. 83 in Smithers and Burton) are sometimes, but for no good reason, attributed to Tibullus.

Tibullus 1.4 is part of a series of 3 elegies about Tibullus&#x27;s love for a certain boy called Marathus. In this 82-line poem, Priapus gives advice to the poet on how to seduce boys.

There are also some epigrams of Martial addressed to or written about Priapus; they include 85 and 90–94 in Smithers and Burton&#x27;s &quot;Priapeia&quot;, as well as Martial 1.40, in which the poet asks Priapus to guard a grove of trees from thieves, threatening to use the statue of the god for firewood if he fails.

<text>Microsoft DNS is the name given to the implementation of domain name system services provided in Microsoft Windows operating systems.

== Overview ==
The Domain Name System support in Microsoft Windows NT, and thus its derivatives Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003, comprises two clients and a server. Every Microsoft Windows machine has a DNS lookup client, to perform ordinary DNS lookups. Some machines have a Dynamic DNS client, to perform Dynamic DNS Update transactions, registering the machines&#x27; names and IP addresses. Some machines run a DNS server, to publish DNS data, to service DNS lookup requests from DNS lookup clients, and to service DNS update requests from DNS update clients.

The server software is only supplied with the server versions of Windows.

== DNS lookup client ==
Applications perform DNS lookups with the aid of a DLL. They call library functions in the DLL, which in turn handle all communications with DNS servers (over UDP or TCP) and return the final results of the lookup back to the applications.

Microsoft&#x27;s DNS client also has optional support for local caching, in the form of a &quot;DNS Client&quot; service (also known as &quot;DNSCACHE&quot;). Before they attempt to directly communicate with DNS servers, the library routines first attempt to make a local IPC connection to the DNS Client service on the machine. If there is one, and if such a connection can be made, they hand the actual work of dealing with the lookup over to the DNS Client service. The DNS Client service itself communicates with DNS servers, and caches the results that it receives.

Microsoft&#x27;s DNS client is capable of talking to multiple DNS servers. The exact algorithm varies according to the version, and service pack level, of the operating system; but in general all communication is with a &quot;preferred&quot; DNS server until it fails to answer, whereupon communication switches to one of several &quot;alternative&quot; DNS servers.

=== The effects of running the DNS Client service ===
There are several minor differences in system behavior depending on whether the DNS Client service is started:

* Parsing of the &quot;hosts&quot; file: The lookup functions read only the hosts file if they cannot off-load their task onto the DNS Client service and have to fall back to communicating with DNS servers themselves. In turn, the DNS Client service reads the &quot;hosts&quot; file once, at startup, and only re-reads it if it notices that the last modification timestamp of the file has changed since it last read it. Thus:
** With the DNS Client service running: The &quot;hosts&quot; file is read and parsed only a few times, once at service startup, and thereafter whenever the DNS Client service notices that it has been modified.
*** Additionally, running the DNS Client service in conjunction with a “large” HOSTS file can cause it to put a 100% load on the CPU/core on which it is running until it is stopped.
** Without the DNS Client service running: The &quot;hosts&quot; file is read and parsed repeatedly, by each individual application program as it makes a DNS lookup.
* The effect of multiple answers in the &quot;hosts&quot; file: The DNS Client service does not use the &quot;hosts&quot; file directly when performing lookups. Instead, it (initially) populates its cache from it, and then performs lookups using the data in its cache. When the lookup functions fall back to doing the work themselves, however, they scan the &quot;hosts&quot; file directly and sequentially, stopping when the first answer is found. Thus:
** With the DNS Client service running: If the &quot;hosts&quot; file contains multiple lines denoting multiple answers for a given lookup, all of the answers in the cache will be returned.
** Without the DNS Client service running: If the &quot;hosts&quot; file contains multiple lines denoting multiple answers for a given lookup, only the first answer found will be returned.
* Fallback from preferred to alternative DNS servers: The fallback from the preferred DNS server to the alternative DNS servers is done by whatever entity, the DNS Client service or the library functions themselves, is actually performing the communication with them. Thus:
** With the DNS Client service running: Fallback to the alternative DNS servers happens globally. If the preferred DNS server fails to answer, all subsequent communication is with the alternative DNS servers.
** Without the DNS Client service running: Any fallback to the alternative DNS servers happens locally, within each individual process that is making DNS queries. Different processes may be in different states, some talking to the preferred DNS server and some talking to alternative DNS servers.

=== Differences from other systems ===
Linux distributions and various versions of Unix have a generalized name resolver layer. The resolver can be controlled to use a hosts file or Network Information Service (NIS), by configuring the Name Service Switch.

== Dynamic DNS Update client ==
Whilst DNS lookups read DNS data, DNS updates &quot;write&quot; them. Both workstations and servers running Windows attempt to send Dynamic DNS update requests to DNS servers.

Workstations running Windows attempt to register their names and their IP addresses with DNS servers, so that other machines may locate them by name. Prior to Windows Vista (and Windows Server 2008), this registration is performed by the &quot;DHCP Client&quot; service. It is thus necessary to run the DHCP Client service on pre-Vista machines, even if DHCP isn&#x27;t being used to configure the machine in order to dynamically register a machine&#x27;s name and address for DNS lookup. The DHCP Client service registers name and address data whenever they are changed (either manually by an administrator or automatically by the granting or revocation of a DHCP lease). In Windows Vista (and Windows Server 2008) Microsoft moved the registration functionality from the &quot;DHCP Client&quot; service to the &quot;DNS Client&quot; service.

Servers running Microsoft Windows also attempt to register other information, in addition to their names and IP addresses, such as the locations of the LDAP and Kerberos services that they provide.

== DNS server ==
Microsoft Windows Server operating systems can run the &quot;DNS Server&quot; service. This is a monolithic DNS server that provides many types of DNS service, including caching, Dynamic DNS update, zone transfer, and DNS notification. DNS notification implements a push mechanism for notifying a select set of secondary servers for a zone when it is updated.

Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;DNS Server&quot; service was first introduced in Windows NT 3.51 as an add-on with Microsoft&#x27;s collection of BackOffice services, but at the time was marked to be used for testing purposes only. It became notorious for incompatibility with BIND configuration files, in particular by lacking support for DNS wildcards and differing in its IPv6 implementation. Since the introduction, Microsoft has taken care to improve interoperability with BIND and other implementations in terms of zone file format, zone transfer, and other DNS protocol details.

As of 2004, it was the fourth most popular DNS server (counting BIND version 9 separately from versions 8 and 4) for the publication of DNS data.

Like various other DNS servers, Microsoft&#x27;s DNS server supports different database &quot;back ends&quot;. Microsoft&#x27;s DNS server supports two such back ends. DNS data can be stored either in &quot;master files&quot; (also known as &quot;zone files&quot;) or in the Active Directory database itself. In the latter case, since Active Directory (rather than the DNS server) handles the actual replication of the database across multiple machines, the database can be modified on any server (&quot;multiple-master replication&quot;), and the addition or removal of a &quot;zone&quot; will be immediately propagated to all other DNS servers within the appropriate Active Directory &quot;replication scope&quot;. (Contrast this with BIND, where when such changes are made, the list of &quot;zones&quot;, in the file, has to be explicitly updated on each individual server.)

Microsoft&#x27;s DNS server can be administered using either a graphical user interface, the &quot;DNS Management Console&quot;, or a command line interface, the dnscmd utility. New to Windows Server 2012 is a fully featured PowerShell provider for DNS server management.

=== Common issues ===
Prior to Windows Server 2003 and Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 3, the most common problem encountered with Microsoft&#x27;s DNS server was cache pollution. Although Microsoft&#x27;s DNS Server had a mechanism for properly dealing with cache pollution, the mechanism was turned off by default.

In 2004, a common problem involved the feature of the Windows Server 2003 version of Microsoft&#x27;s DNS server to use EDNS0, which a large number of firewalls could not cope with.

<doc id="1321017" wikidata="Q3239135" url="?curid=1321017" title="Lakeshore West line">
<text>Lakeshore West is one of the seven train lines of the GO Transit system in the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, Canada. It extends from Union Station in Toronto to Hamilton, along the shore of Lake Ontario. Some train trips extend past Hamilton to St. Catharines and Niagara Falls.

==History==

The Lakeshore West line is the oldest of GO&#x27;s services, opening as part of the then-unified Lakeshore line on GO Transit&#x27;s first day of operations on May 23, 1967. The first train, numbered 946 left at 5:50 am from Oakville bound for Toronto, ten minutes before service began out of Pickering. During the three-year experiment, all day GO Train service ran hourly from Oakville to Pickering with limited rush hour train service to Hamilton. The experiment proved to be extremely popular; GO Transit carried its first million riders during its first four months, and averaged 15,000 per day soon after.

Service began running west from Union, stopping at Mimico, Long Branch, Port Credit, Lorne Park, Clarkson, and Oakville. Rush-hour trains ran to Bronte, Burlington and Hamilton, at the former CN railway station at James Street.

GO trains started serving the Canadian National Exhibition in August 1967 from an older platform just west of the Dufferin Street bridge over the Lakeshore West line and the Queen Elizabeth Way. For the 1968 Exhibition season, temporary booths were set up to handle passengers, which topped 24,000 on the season&#x27;s busiest day. This prompted the need for a proper station with additional capacity, and by the 1968 Royal Agricultural Winter Fair, the current Exhibition GO Station was built and put in service.

Lorne Park Station closed within the first year of the line&#x27;s operation after seeing little usage.

Appleby GO Station opened on September 19, 1988, followed by Aldershot GO Station on May 25, 1992. The opening of Aldershot coincided with the extension of all day and weekend service from Oakville to Burlington, however, this was reversed due to budget cuts on July 3, 1993.

On April 29, 1996, James Street station was replaced by the Hamilton GO Centre. All day service to Burlington was restored on May 1, 2000, and extended to Aldershot on September 7, 2007. On June 29, 2013, all day service was increased to operate trains every 30 minutes.

A third track was added between Sixteen Mile creek and the Port Credit station. Combined with additional work undertaken since the early 1990s, this gives the Lakeshore West line at least three tracks from Union Station through to Bayview Junction.

In 2009 as a pilot project, GO began operating express trains to Via Rail stations in St. Catharines and Niagara Falls on weekends and holidays during Niagara Region&#x27;s busy summer tourist season. The service was provided again during the 2010 season, and was officially made permanently recurring starting in 2011. In 2019, the weekend express service began operating year-round, and on May 23, 2023, year-round weekday service to Niagara Falls was enhanced, with two additional round trips per day to Niagara Falls.

West Harbour GO Station opened in July 2015, serving as a second Hamilton terminus for rush-hour train service. In August 2021, all-day service was extended to this station.

On January 7, 2019, one weekday round-trip was extended beyond West Harbour station to Niagara Falls.

On April 28, 2024 as part of a larger increase in GO Train service, Metrolinx introduced 15-minute weekend service from Oakville GO and Union Station.

==Service==
On weekdays, local service operates every 30 minutes east of Aldershot and every 60 minutes at West Harbour. In addition, eleven daily express trains operate during peak and off-peak periods, of which four operate between Toronto and Hamilton GO Centre, two to West Harbour, two to Aldershot, and three to .

On weekends, local service operates every 30 minutes between Union and Aldershot, and every 60 minutes between Aldershot and West Harbour. Three express trains per day operate between Toronto and Niagara Falls.

All off-peak local trains, as well as some peak trains, are through-routed with the Lakeshore East line to Oshawa.

Five GO bus routes are considered to be part of the Lakeshore West corridor:
* Route 12 provides regular service between Niagara Falls station and Burlington GO Station
* Route 15 connects Aldershot to Brantford, via McMaster University
* Route 16 provides regular express service directly between Hamilton GO Centre and Toronto Union Station
* Route 17 provides hourly service between Hamilton, University of Guelph, and University of Waterloo
* Route 18 connects Aldershot to Brock University, via Hamilton GO Centre, West Harbour and St. Catharines station.

== Future ==
As part of the 2008 Metrolinx regional transportation plan entitled &quot;The Big Move&quot;, the agency identified an express all-day service between Hamilton and Oshawa (via Toronto Union) as one of its top 15 priorities. This project, formally dubbed GO Expansion is expected to reduce some trip times by 20%.

GO Expansion will involve electrifying the Lakeshore West line up to Burlington GO Station, and introduce electrified rail services that will operate up to every 3.5 minutes during peak hour, as well as expanding off-peak service beyond Aldershot GO Station into Hamilton and beyond to Niagara Falls. GO Expansion also involves upgrading multiple stations to include enhanced passenger accommodations, as well as raising the platforms at all GO Stations on the line to be the same height as the coaches, removing the need to step up into the coach and making all sections of the trains accessible.

In early 2019, Niagara Falls, New York officials expressed interest in having GO Transit expand rail service over the border to the Niagara Falls station in New York. Metrolinx stated that there are specific restrictions when a train leaves Ontario, or any province in Canada, that require a different set of inspection criteria and standards in order to legally enter the United States which would make a stop at the station difficult.

In June 2020, Metrolinx released a business case for a proposed station near Humber Bay, named Park Lawn GO Station. The station will be integrated with a residential development being constructed at the same time.

===Niagara Region===
Metrolinx is currently planning to expand rail service between Hamilton and Niagara Falls. The project includes three new stations, two upgraded stations, and more than 25 kilometres of new track. Originally planned for completion in 2023, Metrolinx halted the delivery process for the stations in the Niagara extension in November 2018 when the newly-elected 42nd Parliament of Ontario rescinded its funding for their construction. In order to be constructed, the stations would instead be dependent on private financing.

In 2015, Confederation GO Station (in East Hamilton, near Stoney Creek) was announced with a completion date of 2019. , the rail station is under construction and is planned to open in 2025.

In June 2016, Ontario Minister of Transportation Steven Del Duca announced that regular service would be extended to Grimsby, with the Grimsby GO Station expected to open in 2021. In 2023, enhanced service was then-expected to begin to the St. Catharines and Niagara Falls Via Rail stations which will be upgraded to support increased GO service. Ahead of the 2025 Ontario general election, all major political parties promised to build the GO station if elected.

In March 2022, Metrolinx released an initial business case for a proposed Beamsville GO Station within the Town of Lincoln. It would be located on the west side of Ontario Street in Beamsville along the rail line. Metrolinx expects the proposed station would increase GO Transit ridership by 48,000 trips annually by 2041 including 7,000 to 8,000 tourists annually. The proposed station could possibly include customer parking, a pick-up and drop-off area, bicycle parking, and an area for local and regional public transit buses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metrolinx-2022/03/15&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership==
In order to facilitate service expansions, GO Transit&#x27;s parent agency Metrolinx has gradually acquired portions of the Lakeshore West corridor from the freight railway companies Canadian National Railway (CN) and Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CPKC). Most of the Lakeshore West line operates along the Oakville subdivision, which was entirely owned by CN prior to 1998.

On March 31, 2010, GO acquired its first segment of the Oakville subdivision, between Union Station and 30th Street in Etobicoke (just west of GO&#x27;s Willowbrook Rail Maintenance Facility). On March 27, 2012, GO purchased a second segment immediately to the west, extending its ownership to a point just west of Fourth Line in Oakville. On March 22, 2013, Metrolinx purchased a third segment extending its ownership westward to a point just west of Burlington station, where the CN Halton Subdivision joins the line.

In addition to the Union Station Rail Corridor, these three segments represent Metrolinx&#x27;s current ownership of the line. CN continues to own the tracks between Burlington and the Desjardins Canal, as well as the Grimsby subdivision that carries trains into Niagara Region. CPKC owns the tracks between the Desjardins Canal and Hamilton GO Centre.

==Station list==
Most off-peak local trains, as well as some peak trains, continue as part of the Lakeshore East line after stopping at Union Station, with no train change required.

<doc id="1321020" wikidata="Q1269580" url="?curid=1321020" title="Wickliffe Mounds">
<text>Wickliffe Mounds (15 BA 4) is a prehistoric, Mississippian culture archaeological site located in Ballard County, Kentucky, just outside the town of Wickliffe, about from the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. Archaeological investigations have linked the site with others along the Ohio River in Illinois and Kentucky as part of the Angel phase of Mississippian culture. Wickliffe Mounds is controlled by the State Parks Service, which operates a museum at the site for interpretation of the ancient community. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, it is also a Kentucky Archeological Landmark and State Historic Site.

==Prehistoric community at Wickliffe Mounds==
The town at Wickliffe Mounds is located on a bluff above the Ohio River, and was both a ceremonial and administrative center of an important chiefdom in the Mississippian culture. At its peak it had a population probably reaching into the hundreds.

The site is dominated by two large platform mounds, with at least eight smaller mounds scattered around a central plaza area. Agriculture was based on the cultivation of maize as a staple, which was stored and supported denser populations and stratification of society. The Mississippian culture peoples had trade with societies as far away as North Carolina, Wisconsin, and the Gulf of Mexico. As in most other Mississippian chiefdoms, the community of Wickliffe had a social hierarchy ruled by a hereditary chief.

===Chronology===

The site was inhabited between 1000 CE and 1350 CE. When Wickliffe began to be abandoned around 1300, the population had been slowly relocating to the Twin Mounds Site, several miles to the northeast near the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers.

==Exploitation and excavation==

Amateur and semi-professional excavations first began in the site around 1913 and continued sporadically for several decades. In 1932, Fain W. King, a lumberman, amateur archaeologist, and Indian artifact collector from Paducah, Kentucky, who was a member of the Board of Regents of the Alabama Museum of Natural History, Tuscaloosa requested and privately paid for the Alabama Museum archaeology staff to conduct the excavations of the center portions of three mounds (A, B, and C) at the Wickliffe site including the cemetery, Mound C. The excavations were done under the direction of Walter B, Jones, Alabama State Geologist, and David L. DeJarnette who was the crew chief. The first publicity flyer about the excavations was co-authored by TMN Lewis and Fain King and the first two separate journal articles about the excavations (Wisconsin Archaeologist and Tenn. Academy of Science) by each author said the work was undertaken as both a scientific and educational enterprise through which the public was enabled to examine a page of unwritten history. To defray the cost of operating the site a one dollar admission was charged for the one hour guided tour during the King era.

In cooperation with his wife, Blanche Busey King, he opened the site for tourists under the name &quot;Ancient Buried City&quot;. The Kings&#x27; venture was highly controversial because they used sensational and misleading advertising, altered the site to make it more visually appealing, and made dubious and exaggerated interpretations of the site. These actions put them directly in opposition to professional archaeologists who studied the site and did not want it disturbed.

The Kings deeded the site to the Western Baptist Hospital in Paducah in 1946, that agreed to pay them a monthly stipend until both of their deaths. The hospital continued to operate the site as a tourism business until 1983 the year Mrs. King died. That year the hospital donated the site to Murray State University, to be used for research and training students. In 1984 the site&#x27;s historic importance was recognized and it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In 2004, the site became the 11th State Historical Site of Kentucky and entered the control of the Kentucky State Parks.

In addition to the freestanding Mound A, the major ceremonial mound, the museum park encloses three excavated mounds with archaeological features, to aid in their interpretation for visitors. It displays the outstanding collection of pottery and artifacts excavated on site. A mural with a birds-eye view of the Mississippian village on the bluff shows how the entire complex would have looked.
==Mound A==

Ceremonial Mound is the largest of the mounds and was the location of ceremonial structures. This would have been political and religious center of the community. Originally excavated in 1932 and later in 1984–85, it has been determined that there are six phases of development.

==Mound B==
The Architecture Building covered a mound that was residential. The Architecture Building has been removed and the excavation filled. This mound was built up over 200 years. Until 2016, visitors could look into the layers of this mound. It showed the evidence which archeologists used to identify this as a residential area, such as the layers of charred materials from cooking fires and the postholes for the poles that held the wattle and daub siding.

==Mound C==
The Cemetery Building formerly covered the area used as the community&#x27;s burial ground. Native American practices prohibit the display of the dead. The original remains were reinterred and artificial skeletons were placed to show the original burials. The exterior of the excavation has curtains with traditional designs to cover those remains that could not be removed. The burials are from the 13th century. They included many infants, as well as people with identifiable medical problems, including arthritis, tuberculosis (TB) and various injuries. All excavations have been filled and the interior can no longer be viewed.

==Mound D==
The Lifeways Building is the excavation of an early village/residential portion of the community. The early homes were replaced by an elongated mound. The excavation shows the arrangement of earlier structures, including numerous infant burials.

==Kincaid focus==
In the lower Ohio River valley in Illinois, Kentucky, and Indiana, the Mississippian-culture towns of Kincaid, Wickliffe, Tolu, and Angel Mounds have been more closely grouped together into a &quot;Kincaid focus&quot; archeological set, due to similarities in pottery assemblages and site plans. Most striking are the comparisons between the Kincaid and Angel sites, which include analogous site plans, stylistic similarities in artifacts, and geographic proximity. These connections have led some experts to hypothesize that the builders and residents were of the same society. 
Rare painted and incised sherds of Mississippian culture pottery have been found at all four sites, ranging from less than one percent near Kincaid to about three or four percent of the assemblage at Wickliffe. Some common pottery styles found in these sites include: Angel Negative Painted, Kincaid Negative Painted, and Matthews Incised. This pottery is shell-tempered and ranges from the smoothed surface and coarser temper of Mississippi Ware to the more polished surface and finer temper of Bell Ware.

<doc id="1321027" wikidata="Q3269975" url="?curid=1321027" title="First Step (Faces album)">
<text>First Step is the debut studio album by the English rock band Faces, released on 27 March 1970 by Warner Bros. Records. The album was released only a few months after the Faces had formed from the ashes of the Small Faces (from which Ronnie Lane, Kenney Jones and Ian McLagan hailed) and The Jeff Beck Group (from which Rod Stewart and Ronnie Wood hailed). The album is credited to the Small Faces on all North American issues and reissues, while record labels for initial vinyl printings give the title as The First Step.

The album cover shows Ronnie Wood holding a copy of Geoffrey Sisley&#x27;s seminal guitar tutorial &quot;First Step: How to Play the Guitar Plectrum Style&quot;.

While the album was recorded after the group&#x27;s official formation and signing to Warner Bros. Records in the Autumn of 1969, the band members had been rehearsing, performing and recording together in various combinations since May of that year.

At 46:22, &quot;First Step&quot; is the band&#x27;s lengthiest original release and many modern critics regard it as promising, but sprawling and unfocused – their least cohesive and most undisciplined offering. It is however perhaps the most democratic of the Faces releases, highlighting the band&#x27;s talents as a unified whole and affording each member at least one composer credit, as opposed to the perceived dominance of Stewart and his songwriting partnership with Wood as their career progressed.

On 28 August 2015, the album was reissued in a remastered and expanded form, including two previously unreleased bonus tracks recorded shortly after the album&#x27;s release, &quot;Behind The Sun&quot; and &quot;Mona: The Blues&quot; (the latter was remade and refined by Lane and Wood in 1972 for their &quot;Mahoney&#x27;s Last Stand&quot; film soundtrack).

== Artwork ==
The photography for &quot;First Step&quot; was taken at Willoughby House, the home of artist Mike McInnerney and his wife Kate, who, like Lane, were followers of Meher Baba. During the shoot, Kate served the band punch spiked with methanol; McLagan recalled: &quot;We ended up getting extremely drunk ... jumping up and down on this low table and smashing it to splinters.&quot; The front cover photo was taken by photographer and fellow Baba follower Martin Cook. It shows Wood holding a copy of the book &quot;First Step: How to Play the Guitar Plectrum Style&quot;, which biographer Terry Rawlings suggests is symbolic of the public perceiving him as only a bassist due to the Jeff Beck Group. McLagan and Lane are shown holding Mickey Mouse figures, of which McLagan said: &quot;I don&#x27;t remember bringing [them] along with us ... I get a feeling the doll must have been at Mike and Kate&#x27;s house although Ronnie Lane is wearing a Mickey Mouse T-shirt so maybe they were his.&quot; The album&#x27;s black-and-white gatefold photo was taken in the garden and shows the band pretending to play their instruments, except Lane, who was oblivious and instead has his hands in his pockets.

==Release and reception==

The single &quot;Flying&quot; / &quot;Three Button Hand Me Down&quot; was issued prior to the album&#x27;s release. The band promoted it by appearing on the BBC TV shows &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and &quot;Disco 2&quot;, but it still failed to chart. Lane said that the band &quot;didn&#x27;t really want to put out a single&quot; and as such &quot;didn&#x27;t really care if it was a hit, but it would have been nice if it was.&quot; Released on 27 March 1970, the album reached number 45 on the UK Official Albums Chart and number 119 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs. Another single, an edited version of &quot;Around the Plynth&quot; backed with &quot;Wicked Messenger&quot;, was released in the US, but also failed to chart. Stewart claimed that the album sold 250,000 copies within a month.

&quot;First Step&quot; received lukewarm reviews on release. Joel Selvin from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that the album was &quot;original&quot; but also &quot;highly derivative&quot; and failed to live up to the expectations of Faces&#x27; lineup. &quot;New Musical Express&quot; described it as &quot;weirdo sounds&quot; and doubted if it would be accepted by Small Faces fans. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; wrote that the band kept Small Faces&#x27; appeal, but the album was nonetheless &quot;rather patchy.&quot; A review from &quot;Billboard&quot; was more enthusiastic, proclaiming it to be &quot;[t]he most together of any first album I&#x27;ve heard in a long time!&quot;

Reviewing in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau viewed the album as &quot;one more complication in the Rod Stewart mystery&quot;, saying: &quot;With Jeff Beck he parodies himself before he&#x27;s established a self to parody. With Lou Reizner he establishes himself as a singer-songwriter of uncommon spunk and a vocal interpreter of uncommon individuality. And here he steps into the shoes of a purveyor of Humble Pie to pose as the leader of a mediocre white r&amp;b band. Best cut: Ronnie Lane&#x27;s &#x27;Stone.

<doc id="1321031" wikidata="Q2392168" url="?curid=1321031" title="Photoelectrolysis of water">
<text>Photoelectrolysis of water, also known as photoelectrochemical [[water splitting]], occurs in a photoelectrochemical cell when light is used as the energy source for the electrolysis of water, producing dihydrogen which can be used as a fuel. This process is one route to a &quot;hydrogen economy&quot;, in which hydrogen fuel is produced efficiently and inexpensively from natural sources without using fossil fuels. In contrast, steam reforming usually or always uses a fossil fuel to obtain hydrogen. Photoelectrolysis is sometimes known colloquially as the &quot;hydrogen holy grail&quot; for its potential to yield a viable alternative to petroleum as a source of energy; such an energy source would supposedly come without the sociopolitically undesirable effects of extracting and using petroleum.

Mechanism

The PEC cell primarily consists of three components: the photoelectrode the electrolyte and a counter electrode. The semiconductor crucial to this process, absorbs sunlight, initiating electron excitation and subsequent water molecule splitting into hydrogen and oxygen.

Photoanode Reaction (Oxygen Evolution):
H2O → 2H++1 2O2+ 2e−
Photocathode Reaction (Hydrogen Evolution):
2H++ 2e− → H2 

These half-reactions show the fundamental chemistry involved in photoelectrolysis, where the photoanode facilitates oxygen evolution and the photocathode supports hydrogen evolution.

Current Research and Technological Advances

Recent advancements have focused on enhancing the semiconductor materials and cell design to improve the solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency, currently between 8%-14%, with a theoretical maximum around 42%. Innovations include:

Semiconductor Materials: Research emphasizes the importance of semiconductors with smaller band gaps (under 2.1 eV) which are more effective at utilizing broader light spectra, thus improving efficiency.

Cocatalysts: The use of transition metal-based cocatalysts has been pivotal in enhancing charge separation and reducing overpotential, thereby improving the overall efficiency of the water-splitting reaction.

Nanoporous Materials: These materials have been utilized to increase the surface area for electron transport, significantly boosting the efficiency of photoelectrochemical systems.

Advantages: Utilizing sunlight, photoelectrolysis serves as a renewable method for hydrogen production, offering scalability and adaptability across different geographical conditions.

Challenges: The primary hurdles include the still-developing efficiency of the process and the intermittent nature of solar energy, which can affect consistent hydrogen production. Additionally, finding durable and efficient materials for long-term operation remains a challenge.

Role in the Hydrogen Economy

As part of a sustainable hydrogen economy, photoelectrolysis presents a promising avenue for clean hydrogen production. Although currently more expensive than traditional methods like steam methane reforming, the potential for technological advancements could make it more economically viable.

Conclusion and Future Prospects

The ongoing development in materials science and cell design is likely to enhance the viability of photoelectrolysis, making it a key player in the future landscape of renewable energy technologies. Continued research and investment in overcoming existing challenges will be crucial to harness the full potential of this technology.

Devices based on hydrogenase have also been investigated.

<text>Carrara Stadium (also known as People First Stadium under naming rights) is a stadium on the Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia, located in the suburb of Carrara.

The stadium is primarily used for Australian rules football, serving as the home ground of the Gold Coast Suns, who compete in the Australian Football League. In addition, the venue is used occasionally for cricket, including Big Bash League matches. Carrara Stadium received substantial redevelopment work prior to the entry of the Brisbane Bears to the VFL/AFL in 1987, but following the Bears&#x27; relocation to the Gabba in 1993, it was used for other sports including rugby league, rugby union and even baseball. The stadium has hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2018 Commonwealth Games as well as the athletics competitions. The venue would host Cricket for the 2032 Summer Olympics if Cricket is approved by the International Olympic Committee.

==History==
===Early history===
In 1983, the Nerang Bulls Rugby Union Club was formed and were located at Carrara Oval. During 1983, the Bulls fielded one senior team and in 1984 they fielded two senior teams. The club spent two seasons at Carrara before moving to Glennon Park in Nerang in 1985.

On 7 October 1986, it was announced that Australian rules football club the Brisbane Bears had been granted a licence to enter the Victorian Football League for the 1987 VFL season. Bears President, Paul Cronin, announced on 23 December 1986 that the club would use Carrara Oval as their home ground. The financial backer of the Bears, Christopher Skase, spent $1 million redeveloping Carrara Oval over a 10-week period at the beginning of 1987, which included upgraded player facilities, seating for 6000 spectators and new electronic scoreboard. On 19 April 1987, the Fitzroy Lions defeated the Brisbane Bears in the first VFL game played at Carrara Oval, before a crowd of 17,795. (The Brisbane Lions website records the crowd unofficially as 22,684.)

In 1989, the Brisbane Bears and the Albert Shire Council signed off on a 30-year lease for the ground with an option for a further 10 years. Following that announcement, Christopher Skase orchestrated the installation of floodlights costing $6 million, which were never paid for. With the collapse of Skase&#x27;s company Qintex, he would flee to Spain and the cost of the floodlights continued to be unpaid. Liquidators attempted to extract money from the Gold Coast City Council for the lights but, after an unsuccessful trial, it was found cheaper to leave the floodlights in place at Carrara Stadium. On 15 July 1989, the Bears hosted the first ever night match at Carrara, against the Geelong Cats, in front of a then-record crowd of 18,198.

Insufficient public transport access to the stadium and the poor on-field performance of the Bears resulted in poor crowds at Bears games, prompting local media to refer to the situation as the &quot;Curse of Carrara&quot;. After the new owner of the Bears, Reuben Pelerman, lost a further $10 million between the 1990–1992 AFL seasons, the Bears moved permanently to the redeveloped Brisbane Cricket Ground in 1993.

In 1988, Carrara Stadium played host to the very first Touch Football World Cup in which teams from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and the USA competed in the Men&#x27;s, Women&#x27;s and Mixed Opens, as well as Men&#x27;s Over 35&#x27;s divisions. Australia won all four division finals which were all played against New Zealand. The Gold Coast Clippers played their 1989–1990 Australian Baseball League season at Carrara before changing their name to the Daikyo Dolphins and moving to nearby Palm Meadows. For the 1992–93 season, they moved back to Carrara as the Gold Coast Cougars. The Cougars stayed at Carrara until the abolition of the Australian Baseball League in 1999. The Brazilian football team set up camp at Carrara Stadium for pre-tournament training before the 2000 Summer Olympics. The Brazilians later commented that the surface at Carrara was one of the best in the world.

The ground was owned by the Shire of Albert, which transferred to the Gold Coast City Council when the two local authorities amalgamated in 1995. The field is officially known as Laver Oval after long-time Albert Shire Chairman, Bill Laver.

===Growth===
Following the folding of the Gold Coast Seagulls in 1995 a newly formed Gold Coast rugby league team named the Gold Coast Chargers were created and began competing out of Carrara Stadium in 1996. They continued to use the ground until the end of the 1998 NRL season when they were excluded from the competition as a part of the rationalisation of the National Rugby League. Rugby league matches continued to be played at the stadium, with pre-season trials being played there annually from 2002 to 2005, and NRL premiership matches played in 2001 and 2005. The ground&#x27;s capacity was increased slightly during this time.

In 2005 the NRL announced that a licence would be awarded to the Gold Coast Titans, and that the stadium would be their home ground in 2007 until the completion of the Robina Stadium, which was opened in 2008. In response to the NRL move, the AFL scheduled three AFL &#x27;home games&#x27; for the North Melbourne Football Club and a NAB Cup match for Carrara in 2007, and the Queensland State League began hosting grand finals there. The Titans would play ten games at Carrara in 2007 and miss the finals. Following the conclusion of the 2007 NRL season, Titans managing director Michael Searle warned the AFL that if a team were to be started on the Gold Coast it would disappear into the Carrara &#x27;black hole&#x27; within five years.

In 2006 it was announced the North Melbourne Football Club would play nine home games at Carrara between the 2007–2009 seasons. Following the 2007 AFL season the AFL offered the Kangaroos a $100 million package to relocate from Melbourne to the Gold Coast and be based out of Carrara. On 7 December 2007 the newly appointed Kangaroos chairman James Brayshaw announced the club would not be moving to the Gold Coast permanently and would continue to be based out of Melbourne. Subsequently, the Kangaroos games played at Carrara after the announcement suffered poor crowds. The AFL released North Melbourne from the final year of a three-year contract after they drew just 6,354 spectators to their first home match at Carrara for the 2008 season.

Carlton, Richmond and St Kilda subsequently hosted the remaining home games during the 2009 season.

===Redevelopment===

On 7 May 2009, it was confirmed that the Carrara Stadium would receive a $126 million redevelopment, providing a suitable stadium for new AFL club the Gold Coast Suns. The last event at the old ground was Richmond vs Adelaide in front of 11,174 fans. On 30 October 2009, demolition of the old stadium began. By January 2010, demolition works were complete. Foundations for the grandstands as well as construction for the player and corporate facilities began in May 2010. By October 2010, the eastern grandstand was nearing completion. Just three months later in January 2011 the whole horseshoe-shaped grandstand was completed. By April 2011, the turf had been laid and the , LED-powered high-definition video board had been installed.

The redeveloped stadium cost $144.2 million to build and seats 25,000 spectators (with the ability to house an additional 15,000 temporary seats). The stadium features an AFL oval capable of accommodating an ICC-compliant cricket oval, an IAAF Athletics field and a FIFA World Cup football field, facilities for 2,000 corporate patrons, AFL team and officials&#x27; changing facilities, AFL media facilities, and team and officials&#x27; suites. Watpac were contracted for the construction, which was scheduled for completion in mid-2011. The stadium then played host to an International rules football in November 2011, with 12,595 watching Ireland defeat Australia by 50 points to 29. MakMax Australia was contracted to complete the fabric roof of the stadium. The stadium was opened for an open day on 22 May 2011, before the first match on 28 May 2011. The ground recorded its biggest ever crowd when 24,032 people watched the Suns play in Round 16 of the 2014 AFL season, a game the Suns won by 5 points.

The venue hosted the inaugural Grand Final of AFL Women&#x27;s on 25 March 2017. The Adelaide Crows defeated the Brisbane Lions 35 points to 29. The Lions won the right to host the match, but Carrara Stadium was used because the Lions&#x27; preferred venue, the Brisbane Cricket Ground, was unavailable. A men&#x27;s QClash took place at Carrara Stadium on the same evening.

The Gold Coast&#x27;s successful bid for the 2018 Commonwealth Games resulted in the stadium being upgraded to a temporary seating capacity of 35,000, which was dismantled after the Games and restored back to 25,000. The stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies as well as the athletics.

The stadium was used extensively during the 2020 AFL season, which was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as several non-Queensland teams spent extended periods of time in Gold Coast quarantine hubs and played home games at the ground, as a means of carrying on the season while state borders were restricted or closed to interstate travel. The stadium hosted several double-headers, and at the peak of hubbing in round 6, 2020 hosted four senior matches in two days. In all, the ground staged 42 matches in 2020, the most of any ground, and including its first ever finals match.

==Stadium uses==
Carrara is the home ground for Australian rules football club the Gold Coast Suns, who compete in the Australian Football League (AFL), and also hosts events such as junior representative championships and QAFL games.

===Gold Coast Suns===

The Gold Coast Suns have played their home games at Carrara since mid-2011. The Queensland Government contributed $60 million towards the redevelopment of the stadium, increasing the capacity to around 25,000 of which 23,500 is seated. The Gold Coast City Council also contributed $20 million and the AFL $10 million.

The Gold Coast Suns played their first game at the reconstructed stadium on Saturday, 28 May 2011, in Round 10 of the 2011 AFL season. The Suns lost the match against by 66 points. A round 18 game against 2010 premiers attracted a then-record crowd of 23,302, selling out two months before game day. On Saturday 11 August 2012, the Suns won their first game at the venue, defeating by 30 points.

Crowds would not reach in excess of 20,000 again until Round 12, 2014, when 21,354 fans watched the Suns take on the Sydney Swans in a game that marked the first time Gary Ablett Jr. and Lance Franklin went head-to-head since defecting from their original clubs, as well as this being Franklin&#x27;s first match on the Gold Coast as an AFL player. The record crowd was broken in 2014 when 24,032 attended the Suns&#x27; Round 16 game against Collingwood, which the Suns won by five points despite losing their captain Gary Ablett to a season-ending shoulder injury.

===Cricket===

The Gold Coast District Cricket Club was formed in 1990 and shared tenancy of Carrara Stadium with the Brisbane Bears. They would continue to be based at Carrara until 1993 when they moved to Robina. The stadium hosted an international cricket match between Queensland and England in January 1991. Controversy fell over the ground when touring English players David Gower and John Morris chose to go for a joy-ride in two Tiger moth biplanes without telling the England team management and buzzed the stadium in the middle of play. Gower and Morris also posed for press photographs with the plane later that afternoon. Both players were subsequently fined £1000 for the prank, a penalty that could have been steeper had Gower elected to release the water bombs he had prepared. Carrara also played host to a 50-over match between Queensland and the West Indies on 1 January 1992, which the visitors won by 7 wickets.

Carrara hosted its first international cricket match since redevelopment on 17 November 2018 with Australia taking on South Africa in a Twenty20 match in front of 12,866 spectators. Carrara hosted three games during the 2018–19 Big Bash League season, two of those games hosted by the Brisbane Heat and the other game hosted by the Melbourne Stars. The stadium remains a potential future home ground for a Gold Coast-based Big Bash League side that enters the competition.

Carrara Stadium was selected to host all Brisbane Heat home finals in the 2023-2024 Big Bash League season. The first final (The Qualifier) is set to be hosted at Carrara with another to be played on the 22nd (The Challenger). This is due to the Australia vs West Indies test match being hosted at The Gabba. The Qualifier final against the Sydney Sixers attracted a Gold Coast cricket record crowd of 20,191 spectators.

===Musical acts===
Carrara hosted a triple header of entertainment events on the Easter long weekend in 2001. The first night saw Kiss perform and become the first international act to play at the Stadium. Former KISS lead guitarist and foundation band member Ace Frehley revealed in his 2011 autobiography that he punched then-tour manager Tommy Thayer in the jaw while in the dressing room at the conclusion of the Gold Coast concert in 2001. The stadium served as the venue for the last leg of the Kiss Farewell Tour and Thayer would later replace Frehley as the lead guitarist in the band. The next night saw rock legend Alice Cooper perform at the stadium. The third and final night of the long weekend saw the Anthony Mundine-Timo Masua boxing match take place at Carrara.

On 10 December 2011 the Foo Fighters performed at Carrara and set the all-time attendance record for any event ever held at Carrara Stadium, 37,000 people attended the concert. The stadium is also featured in the Foo Fighters film clip of &quot;These Days&quot;. Filming took place during the concert on 10 December 2011. On 19 January 2014, the venue hosted the Gold Coast leg of the Big Day Out. The stadium was set to serve as the host of the two-day SandTunes Music Festival on 30 November &amp; 1 December 2019, prior to its cancellation. The line-up included acts such as Travis Scott, Dean Lewis and Carly Rae Jepsen.

Queen + Adam Lambert played at the stadium on 29 February 2020 in the final concert of their Australian leg of The Rhapsody Tour and pulled a record crowd of 40,000 attendees. In November 2020, it was announced Guns N&#x27; Roses would play at the stadium on 6 November 2021. The show was later postponed to 24 November 2022.

===Commonwealth Games===

Carrara Stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2018 Commonwealth Games as well as hosting the athletics events. The athlete&#x27;s village was originally going to be located next to Carrara Stadium but instead was constructed in Southport. The stadium was temporarily upgraded to hold 35,000 people prior to the start of the opening ceremony.

==Naming rights==
The stadium lacked a naming rights sponsor in its formative decades, bearing the names Carrara Stadium and Gold Coast Stadium between its opening in 1987 and 2011. On 15 March 2011, the Gold Coast Football Club announced that nationally active home builder group Metricon Homes had signed a $3 million, 5-year deal for naming rights of Carrara Stadium, to be known henceforth as Metricon Stadium. In March 2016 Metricon Homes signed a 5-year extension deal with the Suns until 25 March 2020 for the naming rights of the stadium. The agreement was later extended to the end of 2022. In 2023 the stadium was renamed Heritage Bank Stadium, after a contract was signed with mutual bank Heritage Bank. In the same year, Heritage Bank merged with People&#x27;s Choice Credit Union based in Adelaide, South Australia to create People First Bank. Therefore, the stadium was renamed People First Stadium in March 2024.

==Transport access==
The nearest railway station is Nerang, a 25-minute walk from the stadium. On match and event days, special shuttle bus services from Nerang station and Broadbeach serve the stadium. The shuttle buses travel along Route 745, a route that usually passes the stadium on non-match days. A taxi rank also operates in front of the adjacent Gold Coast Sports and Leisure Centre on match days. Future transport plans for the stadium precinct include a ferry service and light rail extension from Broadbeach that will stop outside the stadium.

<text>Andrea Absolonová (26 December 1976 – 9 December 2004), better known by the pseudonym Lea De Mae, was a Czech diver and a member of the Czech high diving national team, later an adult model and pornographic actress. She died from brain cancer on 9 December 2004, at the age of 27.

==Biography==
Born in Czechoslovakia, Absolonová became a member of the Czech high diving national team, along with her younger sister Lucie (born 5 March 1979). She injured her spine when she was 20 years old in an accident when training for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, diving from the 10m platform. She recovered from her injury, but did not qualify for the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Her problems persisted, so she retired from professional sports.

Absolonová was later persuaded by a photographer to pose nude and eventually to participate in the adult film industry.

As Lea De Mae, she appeared in over 80 adult films. She first appeared on American screens in a series of features for Private Media Group. She eventually returned to Europe, shooting more films, but after a short time returned to the United States.

De Mae was diagnosed with glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer in July 2004. Fans and fellow porn actors contributed to a medical fund set up for her in Prague, but she died on 9 December 2004 at the age of 27.

Her Body () is a Czech-Slovak film by documentary filmmaker Natália Císařovská. It is her debut feature film. The film will be about Andrea Absolonová. The film was supported by the State Cinematography Fund and the SK Audiovisual Fund.

<text>Commercial animal cloning is the cloning of animals for commercial purposes, including animal husbandry, medical research, competition camels and horses, pet cloning, and restoring populations of endangered and extinct animals. The practice was first demonstrated in 1996 with Dolly the sheep.

==Cloning methods==
Moving or copying all (or nearly all) genes from one animal to form a second, genetically nearly identical, animal is usually done using one of three methods: the Roslin technique, the Honolulu technique, or Artificial Twinning. The first two of these involve a process known as somatic cell nuclear transfer. In this process, an oocyte is taken from a surrogate mother and undergoes enucleation, a process that removes the nucleus from inside the oocyte. Somatic cells are then taken from the animal that is being cloned, transferred into the blank oocyte in order to provide genetic material, and fused with the oocyte using an electrical current. The oocyte is then activated and re-inserted into the surrogate mother. The result is the formation of an animal that is almost genetically identical to the animal the somatic cells were taken from. While somatic cell nuclear transfer was previously believed to only work using genetic material from somatic cells that were unfrozen or were frozen with cryoprotectant (to avoid cell damage caused by freezing), successful dog cloning in various breeds has now been shown using somatic cells from unprotected specimens that had been frozen for up to four days. The third method of cloning involves embryo splitting, the process of taking the blastomeres from a very early animal embryo and separating them before they become differentiated in order to create two or more separate organisms. When using embryo splitting, cloning must occur before the birth of the animal, and clones grow up at the same time (in a similar fashion to monozygotic twins).

==Livestock cloning==
The US Food and Drug Administration has concluded that &quot;Food from cattle, swine, and goat clones is as safe to eat as food from any other cattle, swine, or goat.&quot; It has also been noted that the main use of agricultural clones is to produce breeding stock, not food. Clones allow farmers to upgrade the overall quality of their herds by producing more copies of the best animals in the herd. These animals are then used for conventional breeding, and the sexually reproduced offspring become the food producing animals. The goals of cloning listed by the FDA include &quot;disease resistance ... suitability to climate ... quality body type .. fertility ... and market preference (leanness, tenderness, color, size of various cuts, etc.)&quot; Milk productivity is another desirable trait that cloning is used for, including in the case of cloned &quot;supercows&quot;.

==Medical uses==
Organs from cloned pigs have been transplanted into human patients. (See Xenotransplantation)

Cancer-sniffing dogs have also been cloned. A review concluded that &quot;qualified elite working dogs can be produced by cloning a working dog that exhibits both an appropriate temperament and good health.&quot;

==Other working animals with high performance==

Cloning of super sniffer dogs for airports was reported in 2011, four years after the dog that served as their genetic donor retired. Cloning of a successful rescue dog was reported in 2009 and of a police dog in 2019.

==Endangered and extinct animals==
The only extinct animal to be cloned as of 2022 is a Pyrenean ibex, born on July 30, 2003, in Spain, which died minutes later due to physical defects in the lungs.

Some animals have been cloned to add genetic diversity to endangered species with small remaining populations, thereby avoiding inbreeding depression. Centers performing this include ViaGen, aided by the San Diego Frozen Zoo, and Revive &amp; Restore. This is also referred to as &quot;conservation cloning&quot;. Two examples are the black-footed ferret and Przewalski&#x27;s horse.

In 2022, the world&#x27;s first cloned Arctic wolf &quot;Maya&quot; was born in Beijing by Sinogene. Although Arctic wolves are no longer listed by the IUCN Red List as an endangered species, the technique can be used to help other animals at risk of extinction, such as Mexican gray wolves and red wolves. The team of Sinogene plans to restore lost species or boost numbers in endangered animal populations.

In a recent study using sturgeons, scientists have made improvements to a technique known as somatic nuclear cell transfer, with the ultimate goal being to save endangered species. Sturgeons are endangered due to the high levels of poaching, increased destruction to habitats, water pollution, and overfishing. The somatic nuclear cell transfer technique is a well-known cloning method that has been used for years but focuses on species that are thriving rather than endangered or extinct species. This technique usually uses a single somatic donor cell with a single manipulation and inserts it into a recipient egg of the species of interest. It has recently been found that the position by which that somatic cell is located inside the recipient is very important in order to successfully clone a species. By making adjustments to the original method of using a single somatic cell and instead use multiple somatic donor cells to insert into the recipient egg, the likeliness of the somatic donor cells being in the crucial position on the egg will increase tremendously. This increase will then result in higher success rates with cloning. There is ongoing research using this improved method, but from the data collected thus far, it seems to be a reasonable method to continue and soon be able to help stop species like the sturgeons from becoming endangered and possibly stop extinction from occurring.

Cloning long-extinct animals using current methods is impossible because DNA begins to denature after death, meaning the entire genome of an extinct species is not available to be reproduced. However, new studies using genome editing have suggested it may be possible to &quot;bring back&quot; traits of extinct species by incorporating genes from the extinct species into the genome of a closely related living organism. Currently, George Church&#x27;s lab at Harvard University&#x27;s Wyss Institute is conducting research into genetically modifying Asian elephants to express genes from the extinct woolly mammoth. Their goals in doing this are to expand the habitat available to Asian elephants and reestablish the ecological interactions woolly mammoths played a role in prior to their extinction.

==History and commercialization==
ViaGen began by offering cloning to the livestock and equine industry in 2003, and later as ViaGen Pets included cloning of cats and dogs in 2016. ViaGen&#x27;s subsidiary, start licensing, owns a cloning patent which is licensed to their only competitor as of 2018, who also offers animal cloning services. (Viagen is a subsidiary of Precigen.)

The first commercially cloned pet was a cat named Little Nicky, produced in 2004 by Genetic Savings &amp; Clone for a north Texas woman for the fee of US$50,000. On May 21, 2008, BioArts International announced a limited commercial dog cloning service (through a program it called Best Friends Again) in partnership with a Korean company named Sooam Biotech. This program came after the announcement of the successful cloning of a family dog named Missy, an achievement widely publicized in the Missyplicity Project. In September 2009, BioArts announced the end of its dog cloning service. In July 2008, the Seoul National University (co-parents of Snuppy, reputedly the world&#x27;s first cloned dog in 2005) created five clones of a dog named Booger for its Californian owner. The woman paid $50,000 for this service.

Sooam Biotech continued developing proprietary techniques for cloning dogs based on a licence from ViaGen&#x27;s subsidiary, stART Licensing (which owned the original patent for the process of animal cloning). (Although the animal itself is not patentable, the process is protected by a patent). Sooam created cloned puppies for owners whose dogs had died, charging $100,000 per clone. Sooam Biotech was reported to have cloned approximately 700 dogs by 2015 and to be producing 500 cloned embryos of various breeds a day in 2016. In 2015, the longest period after which Sooam Biotech could clone a puppy was 12 days from the death of the original pet dog.
Sinogene Biotechnology created the first Chinese clone dog in 2017 before commercializing the cloning service and joining in the pet cloning market. In 2019, Sinogene successfully created the first Chinese cloned cat. In June 2022, &quot;Zhuang Zhuang&quot; was cloned by the Beijing laboratory Sinogene. He is the first from the &quot;warmblood&quot; group of breeds to be born in China and to be officially approved by the China Horse Industry Association.

==Controversies==
===Animal welfare===
The mortality rate for cloned animals is higher than for those born of natural processes. This includes a discrepancy pre-birth, during birth, and after birth in survival rates and quality of life, leading to ethical concerns. Many of these discrepancies are thought to come from maternal mRNA already present in the oocyte prior to the transfer of genetic material as well as from DNA methylation, both of which contribute to the development of the animal in the womb of the surrogate. Some common issues seen with cloned animals are shortened telomeres, the repetitive end sequences of DNA whose decreasing length over the lifespan of an organism have been associated with aging; large offspring syndrome, the abnormal size of cloned individuals due to epigenetic (gene expression) changes; and methylation patterns of genetic material that are so abnormal compared to standard embryos of the species being cloned as to be incompatible with life.

===Pet cloning===
While pet cloning is sometimes advertised as a prospective method for re-gaining a deceased companionship animal, pet cloning does not result in animals that are exactly like the previous pet (in looks or personality). Although the animal in question is cloned, there are still phenotypical differences that may affect its appearance or health. This issue was brought to light in the cloning of a cat named Rainbow. Rainbow&#x27;s clone, later named CC, was genetically identical to Rainbow, yet CC&#x27;s coloring patterns were not the same due to the development of the kitten inside the womb as well as random genetic disparities in the clone such as variable X-chromosome inactivation.

Despite its controversies, the study of pet cloning holds the potential to contribute to scientific, veterinary, and medical knowledge, and it is a potential resource in efforts to preserve endangered cousins of the cat and dog.

In 2005, California Assembly Member Lloyd Levine introduced a bill to ban the sale or transfer of pet clones in California. That bill was voted down.

<doc id="1321050" wikidata="Q5891810" url="?curid=1321050" title="Homotopical algebra">
<text>In mathematics, homotopical algebra is a collection of concepts comprising the &quot;nonabelian&quot; aspects of homological algebra, and possibly the abelian aspects as special cases. The &quot;homotopical&quot; nomenclature stems from the fact that a common approach to such generalizations is via abstract homotopy theory, as in nonabelian algebraic topology, and in particular the theory of closed model categories.

This subject has received much attention in recent years due to new foundational work of Vladimir Voevodsky, Eric Friedlander, Andrei Suslin, and others resulting in the [[Homotopical algebra|A]]1 homotopy theory for quasiprojective varieties over a field. Voevodsky has used this new algebraic homotopy theory to prove the Milnor conjecture (for which he was awarded the Fields Medal) and later, in collaboration with Markus Rost, the full Bloch–Kato conjecture.

<doc id="1321053" wikidata="Q331926" url="?curid=1321053" title="Liam Ridgewell">
<text>Liam Matthew Ridgewell (born 21 July 1984) is an English retired professional footballer who played as a defender. He was primarily a centre back but could also play at left back. He is currently an assistant coach with the Portland Timbers.

Ridgewell, who earned eight caps for England at under-21 level, began his senior career with Aston Villa. He spent time on loan at AFC Bournemouth in 2002, before moving to Villa&#x27;s local rivals Birmingham City in 2007, where he was part of the 2011 Football League Cup Final-winning team. He played for two and a half seasons with West Bromwich Albion, who released him at the end of 2013–14. He then joined the Portland Timbers, whom he captained to victory in MLS Cup 2015. During the MLS off-season, he spent time on loan in England with Wigan Athletic and Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. He ended his career in 2020 after short spells at Hull City and Southend United.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Ridgewell was born in Bexleyheath, in the London Borough of Bexley, and attended Bexleyheath School. He began his career with West Ham United, but moved to Aston Villa in February 2001. He was part of the team that won the 2002 FA Youth Cup final against Everton.

===Aston Villa===
The day after scoring for England Under-19s in a 2–2 draw against Yugoslavia in October 2002, he was loaned to AFC Bournemouth of the Third Division, for whom he made his debut in the Football League in a 2–1 win over Hartlepool United on 13 October and played five games in his month&#x27;s loan spell.

His debut for Aston Villa&#x27;s first team came on 4 January 2003, in a 4–1 defeat to Blackburn Rovers in the FA Cup third round, when he came on as a substitute to replace Rob Edwards after 69 minutes. His first Premier League appearance came on 28 December 2003, as a 62nd-minute replacement for Mark Delaney in a 3–0 win over Fulham at Villa Park; he made 11 appearances over the season.

On 15 January 2005, Ridgewell scored his first professional goal, heading in Nolberto Solano&#x27;s cross in the ninth minute to open a 3–0 win over Norwich City. On 10 April, in a 1–1 draw with rivals West Bromwich Albion, he and opponent Jonathan Greening were sent off for headbutting each other.

In the following Premier League campaign, Ridgewell recorded five goals in 32 games, including two in a 3–3 draw at Fulham on 28 December 2005. He scored his only goal of the 2006–07 season against his former club West Ham United on 10 September 2006.

===Birmingham City===
Ridgewell completed a move to Birmingham City for a fee of £2 million on 3 August 2007, becoming the first player to transfer between the bitter rivals since Des Bremner in 1984.

In the absence through injury of regular captain Damien Johnson, Ridgewell was given the captain&#x27;s armband. He described his appointment as &quot;a real honour&quot;. Though concerns were expressed over how some fans might react to a player signing from Aston Villa, Ridgewell&#x27;s performances won over the doubters. He scored his first goal for the club in their 3–2 win against Wigan Athletic at St Andrew&#x27;s in October, but then scored an own goal in the Birmingham derby two weeks later, also at St Andrew&#x27;s.

In April 2009, Ridgewell suffered a broken leg after a challenge by Plymouth Argyle midfielder Jamie Mackie. He made an unexpectedly quick return to the side five months later, playing in the less familiar position of left back. He continued in that role because of the form of preferred centre-backs Roger Johnson and Scott Dann, and played there as Birmingham went on a club-record 12-match unbeaten run in the top division and set a Premier League record by fielding the same starting eleven for nine consecutive games. He scored a 91st-minute equaliser against Tottenham Hotspur on 30 January 2010 which ensured that Birmingham remained unbeaten at home since the previous September.

Ridgewell continued his goalscoring form with a stoppage-time winner against Derby County to send Birmingham through to the quarter-finals of the FA Cup, had a goal disallowed in the quarter-final match against Portsmouth when the ball had &quot;clearly crossed the line&quot;, and scored an equalising goal against Liverpool in the league.

In June 2010, Ridgewell signed a new contract with Birmingham, to expire in June 2013. He played the full 90 minutes as Birmingham defeated favourites Arsenal 2–1 in the 2011 Football League Cup Final, thus earning qualification for the Europa League. In the absence of several midfielders through injury, Ridgewell played in the play-off round first leg against Portuguese club Nacional, Birmingham&#x27;s first participation in major European competition for nearly 50 years, in an unfamiliar holding midfield position. As the August 2011 transfer deadline approached, Ridgewell submitted a transfer request which was rejected by the club, and despite late interest from Premier League clubs including Newcastle United, he remained with Birmingham.

===West Bromwich Albion===
Ridgewell signed a two-and-a-half-year contract with Premier League club West Bromwich Albion on 31 January 2012. The transfer fee was undisclosed. On 12 February, he made his debut in a 5–1 away win over Wolverhampton Wanderers. He made his home debut a week later as West Brom beat Sunderland 4–0 at The Hawthorns. He scored his first goal for West Brom on 7 April in a 3–0 home win against Blackburn Rovers.

On 16 May 2014, West Bromwich Albion announced that they would not take up the option of extending Ridgewell&#x27;s contract and he was released from the club.

===Portland Timbers===
Ridgewell was signed as a Designated Player for the Portland Timbers of Major League Soccer on 25 June 2014. He made his MLS debut on 18 July, the 62nd consecutive sellout at Providence Park, and a comeback 2–1 victory over the visiting Colorado Rapids. Ridgewell was named in the MLS All-Star team for the 2014 MLS All-Star Game against Bayern Munich as a replacement for the injured Kyle Beckerman. He scored his first Timbers goal, the equaliser against the New England Revolution on 16 August 2014, after a solo run.

On 8 January 2015, Ridgewell signed for Wigan Athletic on a six-week loan deal. He made six appearances for the Latics, who ended the season with relegation from the Championship.

Ridgewell was sent off on 25 June 2015 in a 5–0 loss at LA Galaxy, for a kick at Alan Gordon. The Timbers qualified for the 2015 MLS Cup Playoffs, in which Ridgewell opened the scoring in a 3–1 first leg win over Western Conference regular season champions FC Dallas on 22 November, as the team eventually reached MLS Cup 2015. In the decisive match on 6 December away to the Columbus Crew at Mapfre Stadium, he captained the Timbers to a 2–1 win.

In December 2015, Ridgewell agreed a short-term loan with Championship team Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, to begin when the transfer window opened on 2 January 2016 and end in time for the second half of the Timbers&#x27; preseason. He finished his spell with four wins from five league appearances.

Ridgewell was sent off on 30 September 2018 at the end of a goalless draw at home to FC Dallas for a foul on Roland Lamah. The Timbers made the 2018 MLS Cup Playoffs; in the Western Conference semi-finals they defeated rivals Seattle Sounders FC on penalties. The Timbers lost the MLS Cup 2018 2–0 at Atlanta United FC in Ridgewell&#x27;s final game.

On 10 January 2019, Ridgewell and Portland mutually agreed to part ways.

===Return to England===
On 31 January 2019, Ridgewell joined Hull City for the remainder of the 2018–19 season. He made his debut on 9 February in a 2–0 loss at Derby County, as a 75th-minute substitute for Stephen Kingsley. He was released by Hull City at the end of the 2018–19 season.

On 9 August 2019, Ridgewell signed a one-year deal with EFL League One club Southend United, with the option of a second. He made his debut the next day in the season opener, a 3–1 home loss to Blackpool, starting on the left of a three-man defence and being replaced by Layton Ndukwu after 52 minutes. Manager Kevin Bond said his decision may have been &quot;unfair&quot; to start Ridgewell after he had not played any friendlies in the summer. He left Southend on 31 January 2020, having played no further part.&lt;br&gt;On 22 May 2020, Ridgewell joined amateur side Sutton Rangers in the Sutton and District Sunday League.

==Coaching career==
Ridgewell took on his first coaching job in December 2020, when he joined National League club Dover Athletic in the role of a first-team coach, assisting the manager Andy Hessenthaler.
Ridgewell joined the Portland Timbers coaching staff for the 2023 season. He holds a UEFA B Coaching License.

==Personal life==
In October 2016, Ridgewell and Portland Timbers teammate Jake Gleeson were arrested and charged with driving under the influence and refusing breathalyzer tests in Lake Oswego, Oregon. The case against Ridgewell was dropped in January 2017 when a judge ruled that the police had insufficient cause to stop and test him, while Gleeson pleaded no contest to his charges.

Ridgewell co-owns custom swimwear company Thomas Royall with fellow footballers Sam Saunders and John Terry.

<doc id="1321061" wikidata="Q3239156" url="?curid=1321061" title="Milton line">
<text>Milton is one of the seven train lines of the GO Transit system in the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, Canada. It extends from Union Station in Toronto to Milton, by way of Mississauga. It opened on October 25, 1981.

Trains on the Milton line run in the peak direction during peak periods. The Ontario government is working with Metrolinx to have more train service along the Milton line, known as the GO Expansion, over the next decade. During peak hours, trains would run in peak direction every 15 minutes along this line. The Milton line is the fourth-busiest GO Transit line in the rail network.

==History==
The Canadian Pacific Railway strongly resisted all efforts to put passenger trains on company-owned tracks to avoid disturbance of freight activity into Toronto. Due to the 1979 Mississauga train derailment and efforts made by Mississauga Mayor Hazel McCallion, there was increased pushback for a passenger train line. McCallion and Mississauga City Council threatened to sue CP for the cost of the emergency services and mass evacuation caused by the derailment on the CPR line near Mavis Road. As part of the compromise that got the suit dropped, CP agreed to drop its long-standing objection to passenger service on its freight line.

Following a promotional opening on Sunday October 25, 1981, regular service began the following Monday. Six trips were operated from 2002–2009 and five before this. From 2009–2011, there were seven inbound and seven outbound train trips daily. An eighth train was added to the morning and afternoon runs in 2011 and a ninth train started on January 5, 2015. On February 25, 2016, a tenth train was announced for the 2016–17 fiscal year, as part of the 2016 Ontario budget process.

Bus service was expanded into the cities of Cambridge, Kitchener and Waterloo in October 2009. Several bus routes operate between the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, the Charles Street Transit Terminal in Kitchener, and the Cambridge SmartCentre shopping centre to the Square One Bus Terminal in central Mississauga, including a small number of trips connecting with the train service at Milton GO Station.

In September 2016, GO Transit created a new bus service to connect Cambridge and Milton on weekday mornings during peak travel times, with six return trips in the evening. This bus route averaged only five passengers per trip and was cancelled in June 2019 due to low demand.

In April 2015, Metrolinx in partnership with the Town of Milton launched a pilot project through an app called Rideco which allows GO riders to book transportation to and from the Milton GO Station. This is due to the Milton station&#x27;s parking lot being full by the time the second morning train arrives. As North America&#x27;s fastest growing community for the last decade, the parking lot has increasing been in demand by new residents and those driving in from Cambridge.

== Service expansion ==
Improvements to the Milton line were proposed in &quot;The Big Move&quot;, Ontario&#x27;s regional transportation plan (RTP) published in 2008. As part of the plan, there would be two-way, all-day rail service to Milton, slated to be in place within 15 years of the announcement (by 2023). In 2013, &quot;The Big Move&quot; was updated and Milton line enhancements were shifted to a 16-to-25-year planning horizon. The update also cut back the western terminus of two-way service to Meadowvale GO Station in Mississauga. Improvements to the line would therefore not service Lisgar station in Mississauga, nor Milton&#x27;s station, service which had been promised by the provincial Liberals Halton candidate during the 2011 election.

As a result of this deferral to a longer-term timeline for the improvements, Milton town councillor Rick DiLorenzo has referred to the Milton line as the &quot;orphan&quot; of Metrolinx. Regional Chair Gary Carr said it feels like the rug was being pulled from underneath them with these sudden changes that affected Halton towns such as Milton and Georgetown. &quot;If the Big Move projects benefiting Halton are delayed, Halton will not be able to meet provincial growth plan targets. The transportation system mode split and level of service objectives will not be met,&quot; said Tim Dennis, Halton&#x27;s regional transportation services director.

An objective of the update to &quot;The Big Move&quot; was to align &quot;The Big Move&quot; with &quot;GO 2020&quot;, a transportation plan published by GO Transit in 2008. &quot;GO 2020&quot; called for all-day 30-minute service to Meadowvale with bus connections to Milton. It also proposed 15-minutes service to Meadowvale in peak periods with express service during high-demand periods. Reports cited &quot;significant infrastructure and operational challenges that mean it will not be possible to deliver two-way, all-day service all the way to Milton in the 15-year time horizon. Additional tracks and potentially numerous grade separations are necessary are a prerequisite to the expansion of service to Milton. The construction is especially challenging through built-up areas. This rail corridor is largely owned by CPR, a private third party operating freight rail. Their approval is required for any service and infrastructure expansion. Two-way, all-day service can be delivered to Meadowvale in the 15-year timeframe, but the full extension to Milton can only be delivered over the 25-year horizon.&quot;

In 2017, at a Region of Halton planning and public works committee meeting Halton Region director of planning and chief planning official Ron Glenn said, &quot;The timing for the Milton two-way, all-day GO is in the post 25-year horizon. Interestingly enough, we had a discussion with Metrolinx this week about creating a focus group on getting a defined time for the two-way, all-day GO service in Milton as a priority.&quot; The information was shared with regional councillors at a February 8 planning and public works committee. On February 17, Metrolinx, through Halton MPP Indira Naidoo-Harris, challenged that assertion, saying, &quot;Metrolinx is not aware of any sources that would lead to the information that was posted in the Milton Canadian Champion article. We are still working toward better service on the Milton GO line.&quot;

On August 10, 2021, the federal government indicated a willingness to partially fund an upgrade to the Milton line to handle all-day, two-way train service, but gave no timeline or a specific funding amount. Such an upgrade would cost about $1 billion. Before 2020, the line carried 30,000 passengers per day; however, freight traffic was a constraint against expansion of commuter service.

In February 2024, the Ontario government announced a plan to build dedicated tracks in the Milton corridor to enable two-way all-day service. The unfunded plan was estimated to cost more than $6 billion.

===Extension to Waterloo Region===
The Regional Municipality of Waterloo funded a study indicating that a $110 million extension of the Milton line could bring trains to Cambridge by 2012, with possible stations at Guelph Line in Campbellville, Highway 6 in Puslinch, and at Franklin Boulevard (a park and ride) and Water Street (downtown with transit connections) in Cambridge. However, the plans didn&#x27;t come to fruition when an environmental assessment became a victim of budget cuts. GO Transit expects expansion of train service to Cambridge to happen in the 15 to 25 year time frame, after passenger capacity upgrades at Milton to relieve current train overcrowding.

==Station list==

==Future==
In 2015, Metrolinx released a list of potential sites for construction of new GO train stations. For the Milton line, the sites include:
*Bathurst/Spadina, between Bathurst Street and Spadina Avenue in Toronto
*Liberty Village, near King Street West
*Queen West, at the intersection of Queen Street West and Dufferin Street
*Dundas West, near the intersection of Dundas Street West and College Street
*The East Mall
*The West Mall
*Cawthra/Dundas, near the intersection of Cawthra Road and Dundas Street West
*Trafalgar, southeast of Highway 401 at Trafalgar Road

Selection of some station sites would preclude other sites. Only one of The East Mall and The West Mall sites would result in a potential future station, as would only one of the Liberty Village, Queen Street West-Dufferin, and Dundas West sites. The potential site for The East Mall or The West Mall is south of Dundas Street West near its intersection with Highway 427. After a business case, none of these stations were determined to have a positive economic impact and thus were removed from the Regional Express Rail plan.

<text>Myoporum laetum, commonly known as ngaio ( , ) or mousehole tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Scrophulariaceae and is endemic to New Zealand. It is a fast growing shrub or small tree with lance-shaped leaves, the edges with small serrations, and white flowers with small purple spots and 4 stamens.

==Description==
Ngaio is a fast-growing evergreen shrub or small tree that sometimes grows to a height of with a trunk up to in diameter, or spreads to as much as . It often appears dome-shaped at first but as it gets older, distorts as branches break off. The bark on older specimens is thick, corky and furrowed. The leaves are lance-shaped, usually long, wide, have many translucent dots in the leaves and edges that have small serrations in approximately the outer half.

The flowers are white with purple spots and are borne in groups of 2 to 6 on stalks long. There are 5 egg-shaped, pointed sepals and 5 petals joined at their bases to form a bell-shaped tube long. The petal lobes are long making the flower diameter . There are four stamens that extend slightly beyond the petal tube and the ovary is superior with 2 locules. Flowering occurs from mid-spring to mid-summer and is followed by the fruit which is a bright red drupe long.

==Taxonomy and naming==
&quot;Myoporum laetum&quot; was first formally described in 1786 by Georg Forster in &quot;Florulae Insularum Australium Prodromus&quot;. The specific epithet (&quot;laetum&quot;) means &quot;cheerful, pleasant or bright&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
Ngaio grows very well in coastal areas of New Zealand including the Chatham Islands. It grows in lowland forest, sometimes in pure stands, others in association with other species such as nīkau (&quot;Rhopalostylis sapida&quot;).

==Ecology==
&quot;Myoporum laetum&quot; has been introduced to several other countries including Portugal, South Africa and Namibia. It is considered an invasive exotic species by the California Exotic Pest Plant Council.

==Uses==

===Indigenous use===
The Māori would rub the leaves over their skin to repel mosquitoes and sandflies.

===Horticulture===
Ngaio is a hardy plant that will grow in most soils but needs full sun. It can also tolerate exposure to salt spray. It can be grown from seed or from semi-hard cuttings.

==Toxicity==
The leaves of this tree contain the liver toxin ngaione, which can cause sickness and or death in stock such as horses, cattle, sheep and pigs.

==Māori legend==

According to Māori legend, a Ngaio tree can be seen on the Moon. Here is the story, as recounted by politician, historian, poet William Pember Reeves (1857–1932):

<text>Reverend Bartholomew Price (181829 December 1898) was an English mathematician, clergyman and educator.
==Life==
Bartholomew Price was born at Coln St Denis, Gloucestershire, on 14 May 1818, the son of the Revd W. Price, Rector of that parish. He went up to Pembroke College, Oxford and took first-class hours in the Final Honours School of Mathematics in 1840. In 1842 he won the university mathematical scholarship and in 1844 was ordained and was elected Fellow and Tutor in Mathematics at Pembroke College. He at once took a leading position in the mathematical teaching of the university, and published treatises on the &quot;Differential calculus&quot; in 1848 and the &quot;Infinitesimal calculus&quot; (4 vols.) in 1852–1860. This latter work included the differential and integral calculus, the calculus of variations, the theory of attractions, and analytical mechanics.

In 1853 he was appointed Sedleian Professor of Natural Philosophy, a position he held until June 1898. His chief public activity at Oxford was in connection with the Hebdomadal Council, and with the Clarendon Press, of which he was for many years secretary. He was also a curator of the Bodleian Library, an honorary fellow of The Queen&#x27;s College, a governor of Winchester College and a visitor of Greenwich Observatory. 

On 20 August 1857 at Littleham near Exmouth in Devon, Bartholomew Price married Amy Eliza Cole, the eldest daughter of William Cole Cole, Esq. [sic] of Highfield, Exmouth. The marriage was conducted by the Revd Francis Jeune, the Master of Pembroke College, Oxford. The couple moved into 11 St Giles&#x27; Street, where their seven children were born between 1858 and 1870. They moved out in 1891.

In 1891 Price was elected Master of Pembroke College, which dignity carried with it a canonry of Gloucester Cathedral.

In 1889 he was one of the shareholders in Silver&#x27;s factory in Silvertown, East London, an immensely profitable rubber company. That year saw a major strike by Silver&#x27;s workers for higher pay but after 12 weeks the strikers were forced back to work by hunger. Bartholomew Price was the shareholder who moved the motion of thanks in the Managing Director at the shareholders meeting in February 1890.

He was on the governing body of Abingdon School from c.1887 until his death in December 1898.

The Revd Bartholomew Price died in Oxford on 28 December 1898 and was buried in Holywell Cemetery, Oxford. His grave marker reads: “BARTHOLOMEW PRICE D.D., F.R.S. / FOR 45 YEARS SEDLEIAN PROFESSOR OF NATURAL / PHILOSOPHY – MASTER OF PEMBROKE COLLEGE, / CANON OF GLOUCESTER CATHEDRAL / BORN AT COLN ST DENIS, GLOUCESTERSHIRE, 14 MAY 1818 / DIED AT OXFORD, 28 DEC. 1893 / AND HIS BELOVED WIFE AMY ELIZA, DAUGHTER OF WILLIAM COLE COLE OF EXMOUTH, BORN 19 SEPTEMBER 1835, DIED 14 OCTOBER 1909.”

Nowadays, Professor Price is best remembered as one of the teachers of Lewis Carroll. There is a reference to his nickname of &#x27;the bat&#x27; in the Mad Hatter&#x27;s song &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Bat&quot;, a parody of &quot;Twinkle Twinkle Little Star&quot; in &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. A clock designed by Henry Wilson is dedicated to Price in Gloucester Cathedral.

<text>Kitchener is one of the seven train lines of the GO Transit system in the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, Canada. It extends westward from Union Station in Toronto to Kitchener, though most trains originate and terminate in Brampton in off-peak hours.

==History==

===Services===

The GO Transit Georgetown line opened on April 29, 1974, becoming the second line in the GO Transit rail network. Peak-direction train service operated between Georgetown and Union Station, replacing a commuter service previously operated by Canadian National Railway (CN).

Service was extended beyond Georgetown to Guelph on October 29, 1990, but was again cut back to Georgetown on July 2, 1993.

Limited weekday midday service was introduced in April 2002, with four trains in each direction between Union and Bramalea. These trains were discontinued in 2011 to facilitate construction of the Georgetown South Expansion project.

On December 19, 2011, the Georgetown Line was renamed the Kitchener Line as service was extended to Kitchener, making one intermediate stop at Guelph. Another intermediate stop, Acton, opened on January 7, 2013.

Weekday midday service was re-introduced in September 2015, with hourly service between Mount Pleasant and Union.

In September 2019, GO Transit introduced limited off-peak train service along the entire length of the line, with two new weekday round trips operating between Toronto and Kitchener outside of peak periods.

On October 18, 2021, service to London, Ontario began as a pilot project; one train per weekday in each direction runs as an extension of Kitchener line service, with intermediate stops in Stratford and St. Marys. The existing Via Rail station in each community served as each stop. Service beyond Kitchener was discontinued following the end of the project, on October 13, 2023.

On April 8, 2023, hourly weekend service was introduced between Mount Pleasant and Union, with Kitchener express bus connections at Bramalea. Since the weekend service was introduced, passengers have complained about overcrowding on the new express buses between Bramalea and Kitchener, which at certain times resulted in some passengers being unable to board the buses.

===Infrastructure===
As a part of the GO Transit Rail Improvement Program, the West Toronto Diamond was grade separated. The Metrolinx Weston Subdivision, which carries the Kitchener Line as well as Union Pearson Express and Via trains, was lowered into a trench to pass under CP&#x27;s North Toronto Subdivision. Trains began using the new grade separation in May 2014.

The Georgetown South railway expansion project was initiated in 2009 with Metrolinx now as its proponent. The project represented a significant increase in railway capacity, with the former one- to two-track railway being widened to 4 tracks within Toronto, with a total of 8 tracks where the Milton line and Barrie line share the corridor. All level crossings along the corridor were eliminated using railway or roadway underpasses. The plan would allow for an increased frequency of trains on the route, increasing service from approximately 50 per day to about 300. It drew criticism from Weston community groups, which opposed the increased use of diesel locomotives on the basis of air pollution. They preferred instead that the corridor be electrified. The group has also requested more stations along the route.

The Georgetown South project was later reduced in scope due to cost overruns: the corridor was expanded to three tracks, with the fourth track as well as the dedicated Barrie line tracks deferred to future projects. Construction on the Weston subdivision itself finished in 2015, allowing Union Pearson Express to begin operating, while additional track work in the Union Station Rail Corridor continued into 2016.

In 2009 Metrolinx purchased of track along the corridor from Toronto to Bramalea for $160 million. In September 2014, it purchased the of track from Georgetown to Kitchener from CN for $76 million.

In 2019, Metrolinx conducted a series of public forums on electrification of the Kitchener line from Georgetown to Kitchener, in a change from its earlier Regional Express Rail plan, which had called for continuation of diesel train service on the western portion of the line. Electrification plans reaffirmed overall Metrolinx goals of track bed and bridge improvements, quad-tracking sections of the line, and the addition of a station at Breslau.

==Station list==
==Current service==
GO Transit train service previously operated on weekdays only. Weekend bi-directional hourly service was introduced on April 8, 2023, with all trains terminating at Mount Pleasant GO. During the times that trains do not operate, corresponding GO bus service is provided.

On weekdays during peak periods in the peak direction, approximately two trains per hour operate the full route between Toronto and Kitchener, while additional trips operate shorter segments to and from Toronto. Express trains typically serve all stations between Kitchener and Bramalea, and operate non-stop between Bramalea and Union.

Outside of peak periods, service operates hourly between Mount Pleasant and Union, of which two off-peak in each direction also cover the entire route from Kitchener to Toronto.

==Future expansion==
The 2008 proposal to extend services past Georgetown to Kitchener included some components which have not yet been realized. In addition to the now-realized stations in Kitchener, Guelph and Acton, the report proposed a station in Breslau which would serve as a park-and-ride facility for Waterloo Region. A layover yard in Baden was also proposed. The Breslau station received further approval in an official expansion plan in June 2016.

The provincial initiative known as GO Regional Express Rail proposes a substantial increase in Kitchener line service over the next decade. During peak hours, trains would run in peak direction every 30 minutes from Kitchener to Union Station and every 15 minutes from Mount Pleasant to Union Station. Electrification will be in place from Bramalea to Union Station, with trains running every 15 minutes along the electrified line throughout the day. CN Rail owns a segment of the line between Georgetown and Bramalea that will be bypassed by a track to which freight traffic will be shunted. Once completed, Metrolinx will acquire the track segment between Bramalea and Georgetown.

A new station is also proposed where the line crosses Eglinton Avenue in the Mount Dennis neighbourhood. It would interface with the western end of the Line 5 Eglinton LRT at Mount Dennis station, and open when that line opens in 2024.

The Region of Waterloo is planning to build Kitchener Central Station, a transit hub, at the north-east corner of King and Victoria streets in Kitchener. The hub would serve GO Transit trains and buses as well as other local and intercity public transit services.

As part of Toronto mayor John Tory&#x27;s Smart Track initiative, new stations are planned where the line crosses St. Clair Avenue West and near Liberty Village.

, Metrolinx is considering replacing its Etobicoke North GO Station with a proposed Highway 27–Woodbine station about 2 kilometres west, near Woodbine Racetrack. Metrolinx wants to demolish Etobicoke North station site to effect service improvements.

In February 2020, Metrolinx held a series of Public Information Centres detailing plans for expansion on the line. During peak hours, the plan calls for hourly peak direction service from Kitchener and 30 minute service from Georgetown. Both of these will run express from Bramalea, with trains from Kitchener making a stop at Weston. The plan also calls for full 10 minute bi-directional service from Bramalea and hourly off-peak services running express from Bramalea to Union Station, with weekday trains stopping at Bramption and Mount Pleasant.

On April 30, 2021, the Ontario Ministry of Transportation and Metrolinx released a preliminary business case for mid-term infrastructure improvements which would permit more frequent Kitchener line service, as well as a Request for Qualifications for smaller, short-term infrastructure improvement projects on the line. The business case, dated to March 2021, estimated a reduction of GO train travel times from Kitchener to Toronto&#x27;s Union Station from 111 minutes to 98 minutes with infrastructure improvements which would lift existing slow orders on the line due to poor infrastructure repair. With grade separation of Silver Junction near Georgetown, there would be a further reduction to 90 minutes, along with improved reliability due to the elimination of the need for a train meet at Georgetown, as well as the mitigation of potential conflicts with freight operations. Metrolinx estimated that ridership on the line with full improvements would be 11,008,500 per year, compared to 7,035,100 per year with no improvements (&quot;business as usual&quot;); the vast majority of the increased ridership would be attributable to the instituting of all-day, two-way service. In May 2022, Metrolinx announced that the construction contract was awarded to Dagmar Construction Inc. The work would include:&lt;ref name=&quot;Metrolinx-2022/05/03&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<doc id="1321119" wikidata="Q2609463" url="?curid=1321119" title="Relic of the tooth of the Buddha">
<text>The relic of the tooth of Buddha (Pali &quot;danta dhātuya&quot;) is venerated in Sri Lanka as a sacred cetiya relic of the Buddha and primarily refers to the purported tooth at the Temple of the Tooth, but can also refer to the one believed to be at Somawathiya Chaitya.

==History==
According to the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta, after the Buddha&#x27;s passing and cremation, four teeth are explicitly noted to be in existence. Two of the relics are noted to be in mythological locations (Trāyastriṃśa and in the realm of the Nagaraja), while the other two are in earthly locations (Gandhāra and Kaliṅga). Out of these, the Nagaraja and the Kaliṅga tooth are purported to be extant.

== Kaliṅga tooth ==
According to the Mahāvaṃsa and the Dāṭhavaṃsa, during the Buddha&#x27;s cremation, his left canine was retrieved by his disciple Khema, who in turn gave it to King Brahmadatte of Kaliṅga for veneration, being kept at Dantapura (modern Dantapuram). At some point, the tooth relic gained the reputation for giving whoever held the relic the divine right to rule the land, with the Dāṭhavaṃsa reporting a war between Guhasiva of Kaliṅga and the king Pandu over its possession.

Legend states that following a conflict in Kaliṅga, the tooth was brought to the Abhayagiri Vihāra in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. The relic would change locations as the seat of government changed on the island, whereupon it was brought to Kandy, where it currently rests at the Temple of the Tooth.

Scholar Charles Boxer, however, claimed that the tooth was &quot;publicly pounded to smithereens with a mortar and pestle by the Archbishop of Goa&quot; as one of the results of the Church&#x27;s attempt to eradicate native religions, believed to be around the 1550s, due to its religious importance to Buddhists.

==Rumored Buddha tooth relics==

Aside from the two tooth relics in Sri Lanka, other tooth relics have been reported globally. A 2024 survey found that 32 museums and temples claimed to hold one or more of the tooth-relics, including.
* Lingguang Temple () of the Badachu Park in Beijing, China.
* Buddha Memorial Center () of the Fo Guang Shan Monastery in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.
* Engaku Temple in Kamakura, Japan.
* Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum () in Chinatown, Singapore.
* Lu Mountain Temple in Rosemead, California
* Nagarjunakonda, museum on the island situated in the Nagarjunasagar Lake.
* Lawkananda Pagoda in Bagan, Burma

<text>Barrie is one of the seven train lines of the GO Transit system in the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, Canada. It extends from Union Station in Toronto in a generally northward direction to Barrie, and includes ten stations along its route. From 1982 to 1990 and again from 1993 to 2007, it was known as the Bradford line, named after its former terminus at Bradford GO Station until the opening of Barrie South GO Station.

The Barrie line runs on the former Northern Railway of Canada route. This is the oldest operating railway line in Ontario, with passenger service beginning in 1853.

==History==
In 1852, construction began on the Ontario, Simcoe and Huron Railway, which would run from Toronto to Collingwood. The line opened on May 16, 1853, when passenger train service began operating between Toronto and Aurora (then Machell&#x27;s Corners). On October 11, 1853, service was extended to Allandale, then opposite Barrie on the south shore of Kempenfelt Bay.

In 1888, the Grand Trunk Railway took over operation of the line. In 1923, the bankrupt Grand Trunk Railway was merged into the Canadian National Railway (CNR) network.

===Commuter service planning===
In 1968, MPP William Hodgson introduced a private member&#x27;s bill to move that the government of Ontario establish GO Transit services north of Metro Toronto. That year, a community group known as the GO North Committee distributed &quot;GO North&quot; stickers for motorists to adhere to their automobile&#x27;s windshield to advocate for GO Transit commuter rail service north of Toronto.

Planning for commuter services resulted in the establishment of the Newmarket Bus Terminal by 1970, from which commuters would be taken to the Richmond Hill GO Station to commute to Toronto.

John Crawford Medcof, operating a company named Railroad Boosters, rented a train for one-day service between Barrie and Toronto on 16 October 1969, earning a profit. He gave the proceeds to the government of Ontario to support a north GO train service promised by John Robarts in late 1969, but asked for the government to return the money when the provincial government announced it would not establish a Richmond Hill line service in 1970. He applied for a grant of from the federal government to operate a commuter train for twelve weeks, with one train leaving Barrie in the morning for Toronto, and a return trip at night. The grant was approved per the government&#x27;s local initiatives program in December 1971. The train was operated by Canadian National Railways, and charged the same fares as those for the GO Transit bus service. Another trial commuter service from Barrie to Toronto was operated in late 1972, carrying 13,483 passengers.

In 1973, the Canadian Transport Commission held a public hearing at Georgian College during which its three-member committee heard presentations from Medcof and councillors from all &quot;municipalities between Toronto and Barrie&quot;. All presentations favoured the creation of commuter train service between the two cities, including that of York—Simcoe MP Sinclair Stevens.

On April 1, 1972, CN introduced commuter service from Barrie to Toronto, as required by the Canadian Transport Commission. The service was transferred to Via Rail in 1978. As a result of federal government financial cutbacks to Via Rail, the service was transferred to the provincial government and integrated into the GO Transit network on September 7, 1982, but service only extended to Bradford. On September 17, 1990, the line was extended to Barrie, but was again cut back to Bradford on July 5, 1993.

===Pre-2012 peak service expansion===
On September 8, 1998, GO Transit added a second daily round trip to the line. In the early 2000s, GO Transit opened three new stations on the line: Rutherford on January 7, 2001; York University on September 6, 2002; and East Gwillimbury on November 1, 2004. By the end of 2005, the number of daily trains on the line had doubled again to four in each direction.

In 2006, GO Transit built a bridge at the Snider diamond, which is the junction between the Barrie Line and Canadian National&#x27;s primary east–west freight line, the York Subdivision. Since CN controlled both corridors, the passage of passenger trains over the diamond was often delayed by freight trains passing through the intersection. Constructing the bridge and associated trackage resulted in a grade separation of the two lines, eliminating such delays. Construction of the bridge began in February 2006, and the bridge was opened in December 2006. The entire project was completed in June 2007.

On December 17, 2007, the Bradford Line was extended to the new Barrie South GO Station and was renamed the &quot;Barrie Line&quot;. Construction had begun on February 2, 2007, to construct the new Barrie South station, a new layover facility and new tracks, signals and crossings along the existing railway corridor. The project cost $25 million, funded by two thirds by the federal and provincial governments, and one third by the City of Barrie.

On December 15, 2009, Metrolinx purchased the portion of the Newmarket Subdivision within the City of Toronto from CN for $68 million. The Barrie line trackage, from Union Station to Barrie, is now fully owned by Metrolinx. As part of the agreement, the Canadian National Railway continues to serve five freight customers located on the Newmarket subdivision between Highway 401 and the CN York Subdivision.

On January 30, 2012, the Barrie line was extended north to the newly constructed Allandale Waterfront GO Station.

===Off-peak service and further expansion===
In the summer of 2012, a pilot train service was introduced on weekends and holidays between June and September. Two trains in each direction completed the entire route, while an additional four trains ran between Union Station and East Gwillimbury GO station. The summer service cost to operate, including train crews, safety and enforcement, station staffing and fuel. Bidirectional weekend service was offered again in summer 2013, with four trains in each direction covering the entire route from Toronto to Barrie, making all stops and having a bus connection at Rutherford GO Station for non-stop service to Canada&#x27;s Wonderland. It cost to operate. For the summers of 2014, 2015 and 2016, the same train service was provided, but without non-stop buses to Canada&#x27;s Wonderland, requiring those passengers to transfer instead to York Region Transit local bus service at Maple GO Station.

On December 31, 2016, year-round weekend train service was introduced with service every 75 minutes in both directions between Toronto and Aurora, including three daily trains per direction covering the full route between Toronto and Barrie.

On December 30, 2017, the GO Station (an intermodal station intersecting with the Toronto Transit Commission&#x27;s (TTC) new Line 1 Yonge-University subway extension) opened, and service to York University station was correspondingly reduced to peak hours only. At the same time, the Barrie line&#x27;s weekend train service was improved to every 60 minutes between Union and Aurora, and new hourly weekday off-peak service was introduced between Union and Aurora, as well as additional peak period trains between Union Station to Bradford GO Station. Although the station was intended to entirely replace York University GO Station, limited peak-period service was maintained to York University station following the opening of Downsview Park station.

Due to the temporary closure of the York University campus during the COVID-19 pandemic in Toronto, all service to York University GO Station was suspended on March 18, 2020. On July 19, 2021, Metrolinx announced that the station was permanently closed.

====Davenport Diamond grade separation====
The Davenport Diamond was an at-grade rail-to-rail crossing of the GO Barrie line and east–west CP Rail North Toronto subdivision tracks near Davenport Road in Toronto. It was one of the busiest train intersections in North America. In order to increase service frequency on the Barrie line, GO Transit identified the need to remove the diamond and build a grade separated crossing. In 2015 Metrolinx initiated a Transit Project Assessment Process (an environmental assessment process specific to transit projects) based on the preferred option of constructing an overpass to carry the GO line over the east-west CP Rail line.

The grade separated crossing (which Metrolinx calls the Davenport Diamond Guideway&lt;ref name=&quot;Metrolinx-2022/03/22&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;) is on a long, high rail bridge. It lies between Bloor Street West and St. Clair Avenue West parallel to Lansdowne Avenue. The bridge will allow GO Transit to run all-day, two-way service on the Barrie line without freight traffic disruptions. The 2015 estimated cost of the project was $120 million.

The project began construction in 2017. The Davenport Diamond Guideway went into service on Monday April 3, 2023, and the grade-level Davenport Diamond went out of service on the prior weekend. The ground-level track approaching the diamond will be removed.

At the same time of building the guideway, further community improvements were added in the immediate vicinity, including noise wall and bearing pads, a rail overpass above Wallace Avenue and a pedestrian underpass at Paton Road, as well as a replacement of the Bloor Street West bridge.

Other grade separations are planned. One was completed at Rutherford Road immediately north of Rutherford GO Station, and another is planned at McNaughton Road north of Maple GO Station.

==Stations==
There are 10 stations on the Barrie line, excluding the terminus at Union Station in Toronto.

In addition to Union Station, four station buildings along the Barrie Line are federally protected by the Heritage Railway Stations Protection Act. At Allandale Waterfront and Newmarket stations, historic station buildings remain but are used for other purposes, while at Aurora and Maple stations, the historic stations buildings continue to be in use. The station building at King City was built in 2005; the 1850s building was relocated to Black Creek Pioneer Village in the 1960s, then to King Township Museum in 1989. Bradford station is not protected and has been heavily altered.

==Service==
, the Barrie line has weekday service consisting of seven trains southbound from Barrie and three trains southbound from Bradford in the morning, and seven trains northbound to Barrie and two trains northbound to Bradford from Union Station in the afternoon. The line also has hourly, two-way service between Union and Aurora during off peak times.

Weekend service consists of hourly trains in both directions. Five trips in each direction cover the full route from Toronto to Barrie, while the remainder operate between Toronto and Aurora. Trips terminating in Aurora have connecting GO bus service to Barrie.

During the times and directions that train service does not operate, service is provided by GO bus routes 63 (Toronto–King City), 65 (Toronto–Newmarket) and 68 (Newmarket–Barrie).

The maximum speed on the line is , between Bradford and Barrie South. Trains are limited to in some parts, but can travel at least over most of the line.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, starting on May 13, 2020, most off-peak train service was suspended and replaced with buses due to low ridership. Off-peak train service was gradually reintroduced throughout 2021.

===Connections===
The Barrie line makes connections with:
* Barrie Transit
* York Region Transit
* Toronto Transit Commission
* Via Rail
* Simcoe County LINX
* BWG Transit

==Future==
===Capacity expansion===

In April 2015, the government of Ontario announced that as part of a broad GO Transit expansion project called Regional Express Rail, service on the Barrie line would increase from 7 daily train trips to over 20 daily train trips by 2020. The railway electrification system was planned to be completed by 2024 and feature two-way, all-day service every 15 minutes between Union Station and Aurora GO. However, on August 12, 2021, Metrolinx announced that, after electrification there would be 15-minute, two-way, all-day service beyond Aurora to Bradford, and 30-minute two-way, all-day service to Barrie South and Allandale Waterfront.

===Additional stations===
In the September 2015 planning document &quot;New Station Analysis&quot;, an initial list of 22 potential GO station sites were identified. These were, from north to south, at Innisfil, Holland Yard, Mulock Drive, St John&#x27;s Sideroad, Yonge Street, Bathurst Street at Side Road 15, Dufferin Street, Kirby Road, Keele Street at Teston Road, Langstaff Road, Highway 7, Steeles Avenue, Finch Avenue, Downsview Park, Wilson Avenue, Lawrence Avenue, Caledonia Road, Rogers Road, St Clair Avenue West, Davenport Road, Dupont Street, and Bloor Street.

Of these, most were rejected as unsuitable, either because they were too close to other stations, or for failing to meet other criteria, such as connections to other services, proximity to urban growth centres, construction viability, urban density, or necessary infrastructure. Others were rejected because they were considered for other lines on the network. Four sites were considered for either the Barrie line or the Kitchener line. The sites at Highway 7 in Vaughan and at St Clair Avenue West were not included as part of the 10-year RER expansion, but are part of a future expansion program. The candidate location Bathurst Street at Side Road 15 was deferred for future consideration.

Stations have been approved in Vaughan for the Kirby Road site (serving the community of Hope), at Mulock Drive in Newmarket, and in Innisfil. Under the Regional Express Rail initiative, new stations are planned in Toronto: Bloor–Lansdowne GO Station at Bloor Street West (near Lansdowne Avenue and subway station) and Spadina–Front GO Station at Spadina Avenue near Front Street (with access to the CityPlace neighbourhood and 510 Spadina streetcars).

====Caledonia station====

The design for Caledonia station on Line 5 Eglinton includes provisions for a connection to the Barrie line, including a pedestrian bridge above the Barrie line and provisions for elevator access to future GO platforms. Metrolinx announced that an environmental assessment for the station would begin in the summer of 2015.

====Innisfil GO Station====

Metrolinx is considering a station in Innisfil for a future expansion, to be located at approximately mile marker 52 (kilometre 83.7). They analyzed two sites just east of Sideroad 20: 5th Line near Lefroy&#x27;s Lormel subdivision and 6th Line near the future Sleeping Lion development in south Alcona. Innisfil town council stated its preference for the 6th Line location, which was ultimately chosen by Metrolinx, and approved use of $2 million to acquire land and $2.6 million to partially fund the station&#x27;s construction.

====Concord GO Station====
To provide an interchange with Viva, a bus rapid transit service in York Region, a new station was proposed at Highway 7. The site was called Concord station, after the Concord neighborhood in which it would be located. The city of Vaughan has integrated the station into its design plans for a mixed use development near the intersection of Highway 407 and the rail corridor. Both the municipal government of Vaughan and the regional government of York have identified this location as a potential site for the station, which requires GO Transit to perform an environmental assessment. In January 2013, Vaughan municipal clerk sent a Vaughan City Council resolution to York Regional Council requesting Metrolinx consideration for four priority projects, among them all-day two-way service on the Barrie line, creation of the Concord GO Station, and creation of a Kirby Road GO Station. The station would be located near the old CN Concord Station (located north of Highway 7 on east side of tracks on the current Barrie line) that dated back to the Northern Railway of Canada Thornhill Station c. 1853 and demolished in 1978. In 2023, a business case for the station was released.

==Ridership==
In 2012, the Barrie line served about 7,500 passengers a day, or approximately 2 million per year. By 2008, the annual number of riders on the Barrie line was almost 3.1 million, an increase of 18% from 2007 and 167% from 2001. About 2,300 of the 3,000 daily peak passengers to Union Station boarded at Aurora (about 1,000), Rutherford (about 800), and Newmarket (about 500) that year.

The weekend summer service had 105 riders per train in 2012 (32,000 total for six trains per day), and 220 riders per train in 2013 (41,000 total for four trains per day).

From 2010 to 2014, ridership on the line increased 70% based on cordon count data. For 2015, there was a weekday morning peak of 5,852 boardings and 227 alightings at the stations on the line, all other passengers alighting at Union Station in Toronto.

<text>Richmond Hill is one of the seven train lines of the GO Transit system in the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, Canada. It operates between Union Station in Toronto to Bloomington GO Station in the north in Richmond Hill. Trains on the line operate only during weekday peak hours (morning trains southbound, afternoon trains northbound), while off-peak weekday times are served by the GO bus route 61.

==History==
A Richmond Hill commuter train service had been announced in 1969 by the provincial government, but its implementation was cancelled in 1970 in favour of bus commuter service.

Following a promotional opening on Saturday April 29, the Richmond Hill line became the fourth GO Transit rail line on Monday, May 1, 1978. The opening had been delayed because the BiLevel coaches ordered for the Lakeshore line were not delivered on time, so existing Lakeshore line trains were not available to be redeployed on the Richmond Hill line.

The layout of the line remained generally unchanged until the 2010s, when the line was extended as part of the GO 2020 strategy, which aimed to extend the line north to Aurora Road in Whitchurch-Stouffville. The line was first extended north to Gormley in late 2016, with a new train layover facility at Bethesda Road. It was extended further north to Bloomington Road in June 2021.

==Route==
The Richmond Hill line operates over the CN Bala Subdivision, which is owned by Metrolinx between Union Station and Doncaster Diamond, where the line crosses the CN York Subdivision. North of Doncaster Diamond, the line is owned by Canadian National and is part of its transcontinental freight route.

The Via Rail Canadian transcontinental service from Vancouver to Toronto operates along the entire route of the Richmond Hill line, but does not stop at any stations other than Union.

During regular service, the Richmond Hill line operates trains that are six to ten coaches long. During the COVID-19 pandemic, GO Transit reduced the number of coaches on all Richmond Hill line trains from six to four cars due to diminished ridership.

==Stations==
==Future==
As a part of the GO Transit Regional Express Rail (RER) initiative, train service along the Richmond Hill line is planned to be expanded over the next decade. During peak hours, trains would run in peak direction every 15–30 minutes along this line. To implement the planned RER service, the Richmond Hill line would need $1 billion in flood mitigation and a grade separation at the Doncaster junction with the York Subdivision.

A layover facility was planned in the Don Valley adjacent to the Don Valley Parkway underneath the Prince Edward Viaduct as part of the GO Expansion program. In March 2023, Metrolinx found a different site for the planned facility in a light industrial zone at York Mills Road east of Leslie Street. GO Transit will use the Rosedale Siding adjacent to Bayview Avenue along the route as a temporary layover facility.

<text>Stouffville is one of the seven train lines of the GO Transit system in the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, Canada. Its southern terminus is Union Station in Toronto, and its northern terminus is (formerly &quot;Lincolnville&quot;) in Whitchurch-Stouffville. There are connections from almost every station to Toronto Transit Commission or York Region Transit bus services.

During peak periods on weekdays, trains operate approximately twice per hour over the entire route, but in the peak direction only. Otherwise, trains operate hourly in both directions seven days a week between either Unionville or Mount Joy stations and Union, with a small number of trips covering the full line to Old Elm. GO bus routes 70 and 71 provide service in the directions, time periods, and segments not covered by train service. However, buses to and from Union Station bypass all other stations within the City of Toronto. Weekend service was operated entirely by bus until November 2, 2019, when weekend train service was introduced.

Between Union Station and Scarborough GO Station, the Stouffville line shares tracks with the Lakeshore East line. Stouffville line trains operate non-stop through the shared segment, bypassing Scarborough and Danforth stations.

==History==

=== Early history ===
Originally laid by the Toronto and Nipissing Railway, the track came into operation in 1871. The T&amp;N merged with the Midland Railway of Canada in 1882. Only two years later, the Grand Trunk Railway leased most of the lines in the area as part of a major expansion plan and then purchased them outright in 1893. The Grand Trunk would later merge with the Canadian National Railway in 1923. CN would provide passenger rail service on the line until the formation of Via Rail in 1977.

=== Service history ===
On September 7, 1982, VIA Rail service was discontinued and replacement servicethen just a single weekday runwas started by GO Transit.

On June 29, 1998, GO Transit restored full service to the Lakeshore lines, and terminated Stouffville Line service to and , which are shared with the Lakeshore East line.

On December 13, 2007, the government of Ontario announced funding to Metrolinx for network expansion, which included $20 million to build a second track to enable all-day two-way service between Union Station and Markham.

On September 2, 2008, the line was extended northwards from Stouffville to . Lincolnville (now Old Elm) GO Station was built directly over GO Transit&#x27;s Stouffville Yard, and so it consists of six tracks and platforms instead of the usual one or two.

On February 2, 2015, select trains began stopping at Danforth GO Station as part of a year-long pilot project to increase GO service within the City of Toronto. As of June 2017, many peak-period trains continue to stop at Danforth station, and one daily train also stops at Scarborough station. These extra stops were ended sometime before November 2021.

All-day weekday service was introduced on June 24, 2017. Trains began operating from as early as 5 a.m. to as late as 11:45 p.m. with hourly service in both directions between Unionville and Union Station during the midday and evening. Service in the counter-peak direction continued to be operated by buses.

On April 8, 2019, midday train trips were extended to Mount Joy station, and buses continued the rest of the trip from Mount Joy to Lincolnville.

On August 31, 2019, GO Transit began providing bidirectional late-evening service between Union Station and Mount Joy, hourly between 9:30 p.m. and 11:30 p.m. The final northbound trip continues past Mount Joy and arrives at Lincolnville at 12:29 a.m.

Starting on November 2, 2019, hourly two-way weekend train service between Mount Joy and Union Station began, with some morning and late night trips arriving in Lincolnville.

== Schedule ==
On weekdays, GO Transit train service on the Stouffville line consists of nine southbound train trips during the morning peak and eight northbound train trips during the afternoon/evening peak, running the entire length of the line. During regular weekday operation, the frequency of peak train service is every 30–60 minutes. During midday non-peak hours, five southbound and five northbound trips are provided between Union Station and Mount Joy. From early to late evening, three southbound and three northbound trips are provided between Union Station and Mount Joy, and during the late night, one northbound trip will depart Union Station and terminate at Old Elm. All non-peak train services are operated with a frequency level of every 60 minutes in either direction.

Bus service is provided approximately every 30 minutes in the direction opposite that of the train trips during peak hours.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, train service on the Stouffville line had been previously limited to three southbound trains from Old Elm to Union Station and three northbound trains from Union Station to Old Elm daily. Further reduction of train service began on June 20, 2020, with buses replacing all weekend train service.

On September 5, 2020, Metrolinx began the first step in service restoration on the Stouffville line, with all weekend train trips restored with slight schedule adjustments. On September 8, 2020, the first stage of the restoration of weekday train service commenced, which consists of five southbound trains from Old Elm to Union Station and five northbound trains from Union Station to Old Elm.

Effective January 23, 2021, as a response to diminishing customer demand caused by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic which had been increasing in severity across the province, Metrolinx removed one southbound train from Old Elm to Union Station, one northbound train from Union Station to Old Elm, and all late evening and weekend train service. All removed trains have been replaced by buses.

Metrolinx began the second step in Stouffville line service restoration on the Stouffville line on August 7, 2021. One southbound train from Old Elm to Union Station was added to the morning peak service, one northbound train from Union Station to Old Elm was removed from the evening peak service, and two late evening trains from Union Station to Old Elm was added. An additional southbound train operates out of Old Elm each morning but only provides service between Mount Joy and Union Station. Non-peak service, including weekend service, was reintroduced with the same service frequencies as prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

On September 7, 2021, the third step of Stouffville train service restoration began. The new service levels for weekday train service match the pre-pandemic schedule more closely. Southbound morning peak service, consisting of eight train trips, is provided under a frequency level of every 30–60 minutes, starting from a 5:20 a.m. departure from Old Elm. Northbound evening peak service, consisting of five train trips, is provided under the same frequency level starting from a 3:14 p.m. departure from Union Station. All non-peak service will continue to operate between Mount Joy and Union Station, with two late-evening trips and one overnight train trip extended to Old Elm.

After the implementation of a mandatory staff vaccination policy led to staffing shortages, and in response to the highly contagious Omicron variant, service across the GO system was once again reduced starting on January 10, 2022. For Stouffville line service, this meant reverting to the schedules that took effect on August 7, 2021. Temporary service reductions were put in place on January 19, 2022, which removed most late-evening service to Mount Joy and Old Elm as well as all weekend train service. These temporary service reductions end on May 24, 2022, with the resumption of late-evening train service and the addition of one southbound train from Old Elm and one northbound train to Old Elm.

On May 28, 2022, weekend train service was reintroduced with the same service frequencies as prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Route==
The Stouffville line operates entirely over railways owned by Metrolinx. The line begins at Union Station and follows the Kingston Subdivision (GO Lakeshore East line) to Scarborough Junction, just east of Scarborough GO Station. It then branches north onto the Metrolinx Uxbridge Subdivision, originally the Toronto and Nipissing Railway.

=== Route description ===
From Union Station to Scarborough GO station, the Stouffville line&#x27;s tracks are shared with the Kingston Subdivision and the Lakeshore East GO Transit corridor. The first station after Union Station, Danforth GO Station, is therefore shared with Lakeshore East trains. Stouffville line trains no longer serve Danforth and Scarborough stations. The Stouffville GO train switches to the Uxbridge Subdivision at Scarborough and begins curving towards the north until the Midland and Danforth Road intersection, at which point the line points straight north. The train then passes through residential neighborhoods up to Eglinton Avenue, and stops at the Kennedy GO station, which is the terminus for the TTC&#x27;s Line 2, the former Line 3, and the future Line 5.

As the train progresses through the route travelling adjacent to the Scarborough RT corridor in between Eglinton Avenue and Ellesmere Road, the train enters several industrial districts. Near the Kennedy GO Station area are several industrial spurs serviced during the overnight hours by the Canadian National Railway, the former Uxbridge Sub owner. Continuing north, the train arrives at Agincourt GO station next, which is close to Sheppard Avenue.

North of Sheppard Avenue, the train passes through more residential and industrial areas. Just south of Steeles Avenue is the Milliken GO Station. Past Milliken, the train crosses Steeles Avenue and the site where the original Milliken station once stood, and enters the City of Markham, continuing north. Past Denison Street, the Stouffville train descends below 14th Avenue and the CN York Subdivision tracks before making its way back up, going beneath Highway 407 and stopping at Unionville GO Station.
North of Unionville GO station, the train begins curving in the east direction, passing through historic Unionville (which includes the former Unionville Station building and platform) and residential suburban neighborhoods built closer to the track before arriving at Centennial GO station. Further along the line to the east is Markham GO station, which is located in the historic Markham Village.

After Markham GO station, the line curves northward again, passing industrial areas before approaching Mount Joy GO station, now a major terminal station for all non-peak trains. As the train departs from Mount Joy GO station, the scenery becomes much more rural as the line continues north, crossing 19th Avenue, exiting Markham, and entering the Town of Whitchurch-Stouffville.

Suburban development is seen once again as the train enters the historic village of Stouffville, stopping at Stouffville GO Station. Stouffville was once a major junction that connected the Uxbridge Sub with the Lake Simcoe Junction Railway. Prior to 2020, passengers could see an abandoned track beside the main track where the trains were used to be stored. This track has since been removed.

The train continues until a little northeast, just exiting urban Stouffville, where it terminates at Old Elm GO Station, which is located next to the line&#x27;s GO Train overnight storage facility.

=== Route operation ===
The Stouffville line operates nine trains out of Old Elm every weekday and three trains every weekend in either direction. Additional services dispatched from Union run as far north as Mount Joy GO, and connecting bus services extend north to Uxbridge. Train service is provided in push pull configuration with the MPI MP40PH-3C locomotive at the north end of the train and the Bombardier BiLevel cab control car at the south. The trains are typically six, ten, or twelve cars long, with the fifth car from the locomotive being the door control location.

Service levels have generally been adjusted several times a year with significant cutbacks during the COVID-19 pandemic. For a much of the year in 2022 until September, off-peak service was suspended to allow for construction.

As of September 2023, on regular service days (excluding weekends and holidays), the first southbound train departs Old Elm at 5:14 a.m. The rest of the trains follow at a service frequency of 30–60 minutes with most frequent service taking place during rush hour. The last southbound train departs Old Elm at 9:17 a.m. The first northbound train departs Union Station at 9:12 a.m. These mid-day trains turn back at Mount Joy, providing two-way service at 1 hour intervals until evening rush hour for the majority of stations on the line. North bound trains have a service frequency of 30–60 minutes with most frequent service taking place during rush hour. The last northbound train does not depart Union Station until 7:12 p.m.

As of November 2, 2019, the Stouffville line operated on all weekends and holidays with three trains departing hourly from Old Elm starting from 7:14 a.m. and three trains departing hourly from Union Station starting from 10:15 a.m. All non-peak and most weekend/holiday service is provided by buses. Weekend service was cut in early 2023, but resumed with 11 daily trips in each direction in September 2023

=== Train whistle cessation agreement ===
As of December 23, 2021, the entire length of the GO Transit Stouffville line (except for one crossing at the Markham/Stouffville border, three crossings in the Town of Whitchurch-Stouffville, and one crossing in the City of Toronto) has train anti-whistling procedures implemented as the result of public outcry regarding the level of noise to which some residents were introduced as a result of the provision of increased rail service along the line. The Canadian Rail Operating Rules currently requires trains to begin blowing train whistle warning signals a quarter mile from every railroad crossing and continue to do so until the train enters the crossing as a warning to motorists and pedestrians that the train is fast approaching. The 24/7 whistle ban prohibits train engineers operating on the line from performing this warning signal.

Every city served by the line had to apply to Transport Canada individually in order to stop whistling. The railroad authority Metrolinx worked closely with these cities to implement whistle cessation as quickly as possible provided that all safety requirements are met. To impose a ban on train whistle usage at railroad crossings, several safety upgrades had to be installed at each crossing in order to receive approval from Transport Canada. These safety measures include flashing lights, bells, and gates, signs warning the public that trains will arrive without additional warning, and removal of trees to increase sighting distance.

Even when train whistling at level crossings is prohibited, there are other requirements in the Canadian Rail Operating Rules which require trains to whistle, such as when encountering a crew of track maintenance workers on or near the railroad right-of-way. As anti-whistling does not extend to these factors, residents living in close proximity to the line may still hear the whistle from time to time.

It should also be understood that the elimination of train whistling at public level crossings causes an increase in liability against the city where a train accident causing injury, permanent disability, or death occurs. As it is a well-established fact that whistle bans will increase both the frequency and severity of accidents, the city where such an accident occurs would have to assume liability to which it otherwise would not be exposed.

== Stations ==
==Expansion==
In June 2013, GO Transit held a first &quot;Public Information Centre&quot; of an environmental assessment study for expanding rail service in the Stouffville Corridor. This represented the completion of the second of five stages of work to implement expanded service, and recommended adding double track segments and other improvements between Union Station and Unionville to support increased train service levels.

Double tracking of the line from Unionville GO station to Scarborough GO was scheduled to begin in 2015. This section is proposed to become part of SmartTrack, a proposal by Toronto mayor John Tory to improve commuter rail service within the City of Toronto.

On April 16, 2015, the Ontario government announced a Metrolinx initiative to increase rail service throughout the GO Transit network over the subsequent decade, known as Regional Express Rail (RER). Under the plan, diesel trains would operate on the Stouffville line every 20 minutes from Old Elm to Union Station during peak periods, and hourly or more frequently from Mount Joy to Union Station. In addition, electric trains would operate every 15 minutes between Unionville and Union Station.

In June 2015, new stations were approved in Toronto at Finch Avenue East and Lawrence Avenue East, to be built alongside the RER electrification.

In February 2020, Metrolinx hosted a series of Public Information Centres detailing planned expansion and future service levels. On the line, peak direction service from Old Elm will be increased to every 20 minutes, with hourly reverse direction service to Mount Joy. There would also be -minute bi-directional service from Union Station to Unionville. During off-peak times, trains will run in both directions every 10 minutes to Unionville and every 30 minutes to Mount Joy.

There are long-term plans to extend service beyond Old Elm to Uxbridge, over tracks already owned by GO Transit. Until such an expansion, Uxbridge is served by a GO bus stop at Uxbridge station, and the only rail service north of Old Elm is the York–Durham Heritage Railway.

=== Grade separation ===
A key component to GO service expansion on the Stouffville line is grade separation. Grade separation is the building of underpasses or overpasses to separate road traffic from rail traffic by eliminating level crossings. Grade separation is one of the infrastructure improvements required to be completed in preparation for the GO Transit Expansion Program. There are several benefits of grade separation, the main one being that vehicles no longer have to stop for trains. By eliminating traffic conflicts, vehicular traffic flow through busy streets is improved once trains become much more frequent. A less important but still noteworthy benefit is that grade separation is the only solution that effectively removes the need for train whistling without compromising public safety.

As of July 26, 2023, the Steeles Avenue East grade separation has completed construction. In the near future, six more grade crossings will be grade separated: four in Toronto and two in Markham (right of way acquired for overpass with extension of Donald Cousens Parkway north of Major Mackenzie to terminate at Highway 48 deferred to 2026). There is also another crossing in Toronto that is included in this project that will be closed instead of grade separated since it runs through the middle of a residential neighborhood and underpass or overpass construction is infeasible.

<text>Primuline is a dye containing the benzothiazole ring system. Primuline itself is also known as Direct yellow 7, Carnotine, or C.I. 49010.

The primulines are considered derivatives of dehydrothiotoluidine (aminobenzenyltoluylmercaptan), which is obtained when para-toluidine is heated with sulfur for eighteen hours at 180–190 °C and then for a further six hours at 200–220 °C
Dehydrothiotoluidine is not itself a dye-stuff, but if the heating is carried out at a higher temperature in the presence of more sulfur, then a base is formed, which gives primuline yellow upon sulfonation.

Primuline yellow is a mixture of sodium salts and probably contains at least three thiazole rings in combination. It is a substantive cotton dye of rather fugitive shade, but can be diazotized on the fibre and then developed with other components, yielding a series of ingrain colors.

Primuline is usually available as a sodium salt. Primuline is fluorescent.

Thioflavin T is obtained by the methylation of dehydrothiotoluidine with methanol in the presence of hydrochloric acid. Thioflavin S results from the methylation of dehydrothiotoluidine with sulfonic acid. This sulfonic acid on oxidation with bleaching powder or with lead peroxide, in alkaline solution yields chloramine yellow, which dyes cotton a beautiful yellow.

<text>Steven Davis (born 1 January 1985) is a Northern Irish former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. He made his full international debut in 2005 and made 140 appearances at senior level, scoring 13 goals, to become the most capped Northern Ireland player, also a record for any man from the British home nations. He captained his country at UEFA Euro 2016 where they reached the last 16.

Davis began his club career with English Premier League club Aston Villa in 2004. He was named &quot;Young Player of the Year&quot;, &quot;The Fans Player of the Year&quot; and &quot;Player of the Year&quot; for the 2005–06 season after making 42 appearances during the season. He was sold to Fulham for £4 million in the summer of 2007, but moved on loan to Scottish club Rangers in January 2008 for an initial six months. He was part of the team that reached the 2008 UEFA Cup final and won the 2007–08 Scottish League Cup and 2007–08 Scottish Cup. At the end of the season, he moved to Rangers permanently for £3 million. He won three consecutive Scottish Premier League titles with the Glasgow club in 2009, 2010 and 2011, as well as one further Scottish Cup in 2009 and two more League Cups (2010 and 2011).

Following Rangers&#x27; liquidation in 2012, Davis exercised his rights under TUPE regulations to rescind his contract and become a free agent, returning to the Premier League with Southampton where he made over 200 appearances across six full seasons and captained the side for much of that time, which included twice qualifying for the Europa League from league position and reaching the 2017 EFL Cup final.

Davis returned to Rangers under manager Steven Gerrard in 2019. He won another Scottish league title in 2021 and another Scottish Cup in 2022, as well as reaching the 2022 UEFA Europa League final. He announced his retirement from playing in January 2024, having been absent through injury for over a year (during which he was briefly the interim manager of Rangers, taking charge of two matches). He made 371 appearances, with 28 goals, across his two spells at Ibrox.

==Club career==
===Aston Villa===
Davis, who was born in Ballymena, County Antrim, started his career at St Andrews Boys Club in the DAWFL, before transferring to Aston Villa in 2002. He was a member of the 2002 FA Youth Cup winning team that beat Everton 4–2 in the final. His first professional appearance was on 18 September 2004, he was a 57th-minute replacement for Nolberto Solano in a goalless Premier League match against Norwich City at Carrow Road. Davis made 28 league appearances across the season, scoring the winner in a 3–2 comeback victory at Southampton on 16 April 2005.

On 13 August 2005, in Villa&#x27;s first game of the new campaign, Davis volleyed past Jussi Jääskeläinen to secure a 2–2 home draw against Bolton Wanderers, albeit after nine minutes. He scored twice on 20 September in the third round of the Football League Cup, as Villa won 8–3 at Wycombe Wanderers. By October 2005, he was a regular for the club and missed only one game for Villa in the 2005–06 season. Davis was named Villa&#x27;s &quot;Young Player of the Year&quot;, &quot;The Fans Player of the Year&quot; &quot;and&quot; &quot;Player of the Year&quot; for the 2005–06 season. His form prompted the Northern Ireland manager Lawrie Sanchez, to state that Davis could be &quot;another Frank Lampard&quot;. Davis made 102 appearances for Villa and scored nine times. On 2 January 2006, he headed the first goal of a 2–1 win at rivals West Bromwich Albion.

===Fulham===
In the summer of 2007, Davis followed teammate Aaron Hughes to Fulham on 5 July 2007 to team up with international manager Sanchez, for a fee of around £4 million. He made his Fulham debut against Arsenal on 12 August 2007 and made 22 appearances for Fulham before moving to Rangers.

===Rangers===
On 31 January 2008, Davis was signed on a six-month loan by Rangers, the club he supported as a boy. He made his Rangers debut against Panathinaikos in the UEFA Cup on 13 February. He scored his first goal, again in European competition, against German team Werder Bremen. Davis scored in the penalty shootout against Dundee United that won Rangers the League Cup. He also helped the team reach the 2008 UEFA Cup Final, and won the Scottish Cup in May.

Davis made his move from Fulham permanent on 21 August 2008 in a transfer worth £3 million, signing a four-year contract. He made his first appearance of the season a day later against Aberdeen, a 1–1 draw. He scored his first goal since his move became permanent against Motherwell. He scored the only goal in the final Old Firm derby of the season on 9 May 2009 to take Rangers to the top of the SPL by two points. Davis won the SPL title and Scottish Cup with Rangers in the 2008–09 season.

Davis scored his first goal of the 2009–10 season against St. Mirren on 27 January. He continued his goalscoring form against Falkirk in the next game, curling a free kick into Bobby Olejnik&#x27;s top right hand corner. Davis&#x27;s performances in January 2010 earned him the SPL Player of the Month award. He was also named PFA Scotland Players&#x27; Player of the Year on 2 May 2010, and won the SPL and Scottish League Cup for the second time each.

Davis scored his first goal of the 2010–11 season against Motherwell at Ibrox in October 2010, when he collected the ball 30 yards from goal before striking it into the top corner; the goal drew comparisons to former Rangers favourite Ian Durrant. Davis followed this up by scoring the winner in the match against Inverness at Ibrox in January 2011. In the 2011 Scottish League Cup Final against Celtic, Davis opened the scoring in a match which Rangers won 2–1 after extra time. This was the third time he had won the Scottish League Cup. Davis scored in back-to-back games in the 2011 title run-in against Motherwell and Hearts, before playing his 54th and final game of the season in a 5–1 win over Kilmarnock, as Rangers won their 3rd consecutive SPL championship.

On 19 July 2011, Davis signed a new five-year contract with Rangers. He was made temporary captain, with the absence of formal club captain David Weir for the first part of the 2011–12 season. Davis scored his first goal of the 2011–12 season in a 2–0 win over Aberdeen at Ibrox in August. In the first Old Firm match of the 2011–12 season, he provided two assists as Rangers beat Celtic 4–2. After Rangers beat Dunfermline 4–0 at East End Park, Rangers manager Ally McCoist praised Davis&#x27;s performance by saying &quot;It was a captain&#x27;s performance from the best player on the park.&quot; For his performances during September 2011, he received the SPL Player of the Month award. Following the insolvency of Rangers in 2012, Davis exercised his rights under TUPE regulations to rescind his contract and become a free agent. PFA Scotland had previously commented that players were entitled to become free agents if they objected to the transfer to the new company formed by Charles Green.

===Southampton===

Davis rejected the chance to stay with Rangers and instead signed a three-year contract with Premier League club Southampton on 6 July 2012. The deal was subsequently extended to 2016 as part of the agreement with Rangers to complete the transfer without the need for the international transfer clearance to be agreed by FIFA, with the two clubs agreeing a fee. After joining Southampton, Davis pleaded the Rangers fans to agree with his decision to leave but accepted that a minority of fans would take a different view and made his explanation he left Rangers in order to revive his football career.

He made his debut on 19 August 2012, and scored to put the team ahead at holders Manchester City only three minutes after coming on as a substitute, but Southampton eventually lost 3–2. His only other goal of the season came against the same opposition, in a 3–1 home win on 13 February 2013.

His first two goals of the 2013–14 season came in a 5–1 victory at Barnsley in the League Cup second round on 27 August, the latter being a penalty.

On 17 October 2014, Davis signed a new contract to keep him at Southampton until 2018.

On 8 May 2016, Davis scored his first ever league brace for Southampton in a 2–1 win over Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane. He followed this up with a goal in a 4–1 victory over Crystal Palace on the final day of the season.

On 18 June 2016, he signed a new three-year contract, extending his stay with the club until 2019.

He made his 200th Southampton appearance on 16 September 2017 against Crystal Palace, scoring the only goal in a 1–0 victory.

===Return to Rangers ===
On 6 January 2019, Davis returned to Rangers on a six-month loan. On 2 May, Davis agreed to join Rangers permanently once the loan deal had finished, signing a 12-month contract. Davis helped Rangers win the 2020–21 Scottish Premiership, their first Scottish league championship since 2011, and he won the SFWA Footballer of the Year award.

Davis tore his anterior cruciate ligament in December 2022, an injury which required surgery and a long rehabilitation process.

On 25 January 2024, Davis (aged 39) announced his retirement from football as a result of the injury.

==International career==
Davis made his full international debut on 9 February 2005 in a 1–0 loss to Canada, and made the assist for David Healy in Northern Ireland&#x27;s famous 1–0 victory over England in a 2006 World Cup qualification match on 7 September. Davis&#x27; first goal came against Wales in a 3–2 home defeat in another qualifier on 8 October. He was also part of the team who beat Spain 3–2 at Windsor Park in September 2006.

On 21 May 2006, he became Northern Ireland&#x27;s youngest modern day captain against Uruguay in the United States, a 1–0 loss.

On 8 October 2015, Davis scored twice in a 3–1 victory over Greece to help Northern Ireland qualify for the final tournament of Euro 2016, their first European Championship.

In November 2019, he won his 116th cap against the Netherlands and became the most capped British midfielder, passing David Beckham. On 7 September 2020, he equalled Pat Jennings&#x27;s Northern Ireland record of 119 caps. On 8 October 2020, he played his 120th match for Northern Ireland against Bosnia and Herzegovina in the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying play-offs to become the most-capped player in their history. As of February 2023 he had 140 caps, making him the most capped British or Irish men&#x27;s player of all time.

==Coaching career==
Following the sacking of Michael Beale on 1 October 2023, Davis was announced as the manager of Rangers on an interim basis. He reported that this &quot;came out of the blue&quot; and that it &quot;was too good an opportunity to turn down&quot;. He took charge of two games, a Europa League defeat by Aris Limassol and a league win against St Mirren, before Philippe Clement was appointed manager on 15 October.

==Personal life==
Davis was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2017 Birthday Honours for services to football.

<doc id="1321150" wikidata="Q3239134" url="?curid=1321150" title="Lakeshore East line">
<text>Lakeshore East is one of the seven commuter rail lines of GO Transit in the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, Canada. It extends from Union Station in Toronto to in Durham Region. Buses from Oshawa connect to communities further east in Newcastle, Bowmanville and Peterborough.

Most off-peak and some peak trains are interlined with the Lakeshore West line, continuing to , , or .

==History==
The Lakeshore East line is the second oldest of GO&#x27;s services, opening as part of the then-unified Lakeshore line on GO&#x27;s first day of operations, 23 May 1967. It is ten minutes younger than its twin; although the first train from Pickering bound for Toronto left at 6:00 am that day, a 5:50 am departure from Oakville on Lakeshore West beat it into the record books.

On December 12, 1975, the Lakeshore East line was the site of the deadliest accident in the history of both the TTC and GO Transit, when a westbound GO train collided with a stalled TTC bus at a level crossing east of Scarborough GO station at St. Clair Ave. East. 9 bus passengers were killed and 20 others injured. The level crossing was later replaced by a railway overpass.

The line initially ran along the CN Kingston Subdivision from Union to Pickering. Just prior to the opening of GO service, CN had moved much of its freight operations from downtown areas to the new MacMillan Yard north of the city. To feed freight traffic from the east into the Yard, CN built the new York Subdivision across the top of the city (in what was then farmland) and connected the Yard to the Kingston Sub just west of Pickering at Pickering Junction. This offloaded the majority of traffic from the Kingston Sub between Pickering Junction and Union, allowing ample scheduling room for GO service. Sections of the Kingston Sub to the east of Pickering Junction remained in use as the mainline to Montreal, and CN did not have capacity to allow GO traffic on these sections.

GO had originally planned to address this as part of a much larger project known as GO-Urban, and later, GO ALRT. GO ALRT would have used a new electric train car running on a dedicated right-of-way between Pickering and its terminus to the east of Harmony Road on the far eastern edge of Oshawa. ALRT was to have followed the CN lines east to Whitby, then across the 401 to follow the CP Belleville Sub, which runs in parallel on the north side of the 401. Stations would be built at Pickering, Ajax, Whitby, Hopkins (west edge of Oshawa), Simcoe (downtown Oshawa), Oshawa east (at Stevenson) and finally Harmony. First proposed in 1982, ALRT lived for only a short time before it was cancelled in 1985 with a change of government.

Instead, the basic alignment planned for ALRT from Pickering to Oshawa was laid using conventional track, splitting off at Pickering Junction and running under the York Sub bridge over the 401 in a complex basket weave. It ran along the original ALRT layout to Whitby, but abandoned the 401 overpass and instead continued along the CN lines to the current Oshawa GO Station on the far western edge of town. The new lines were laid in sections, reaching Oshawa in 1995. Until 29 December 2006, weekend and holiday trains still ended in Pickering, but service is now offered along the entire route every day of the year.

In December 1993, GO Transit initiated a program for the eastward expansion of the Lakeshore East line, for which it received approval in 1994. GO Transit undertook a study to determine whether to use the tracks of Canadian Pacific Railway or Canadian National Railway.

Metrolinx purchased the Kingston Sub between Pickering Junction and Union on 31 March 2011 and now completely owns the Lakeshore East corridor.

On 29 June 2013, off-peak service was improved to every 30 minutes. On 24 September 2018, weekday mid-day service frequency was improved again, now operating every 15 minutes.

As of July 2020, seven level crossings remain on the line.

==Service==
As of September 2021, local service operates every 15 minutes on weekdays and every 30 minutes on weekends.

Express services have been temporarily suspended to facilitate track construction between Union Station and Danforth.

==Station list==

Most off-peak trains, as well as some peak trains, continue as part of the Lakeshore West corridor after stopping at Union. With few exceptions, it is possible to travel from Oshawa to Aldershot, West Harbour or Niagara Falls without changing trains in Toronto.

==Expansion==
===Bowmanville extension===
====Description of extension====
The Bowmanville Extension is a planned extension of the Lakeshore East line to run from Oshawa GO station to Bowmanville along a new branch line. The extension would be almost long, and have four new stations: , , , and .

Running east from Oshawa GO station, the extension would turn north crossing over Highway 401 and a CP Rail spur line on bridges to arrive at the planned Thornton&#x27;s Corners East GO station in Oshawa. Continuing north, the extension would curve east on the south side CP Rail&#x27;s Belleville Subdivision, passing the planned Ritson Road and Courtice GO Stations terminating at the planned Bowmanville GO Station. The extension would be mostly single-track with double-track between Ritson Road and Courtice GO Stations; there would two stub tracks at Bowmanville GO Station. Between Oshawa and Bowmanville, GO Transit trains would be operating on its own track independent from freight operations on the CP Belleville division.

Trains on the Bowmanville Extension would operate every hour on weekdays and every two hours on weekends.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metrolinx-2022/06/24&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Weekday peak period service would be every 30 minutes.

====History of extension====
In 2008, Metrolinx published its regional transportation entitled &quot;The Big Move&quot;. As part of this, the agency identified an express all-day service between Hamilton and Oshawa (via Toronto Union) as one of its top 15 priorities.
Metrolinx also committed to eventually providing service every 15 minutes on the line, as well as electrifying railways. This project, dubbed Regional Express Rail (now called GO Expansion), was expected to reduce some trip times by 20%.
Continued growth of the Oshawa area has led to renewed calls for expansion of the Lakeshore East line, this time all the way to Bowmanville. On June 20, 2016, it was announced that the line would be extended to Bowmanville; at that time, the extension was expected to open in 2024.

Part of the Bowmanville extension would be along a new GO Transit spur line connecting the CN rail corridor south of Highway 401 to CP Rail&#x27;s Belleville Subdivision further north. Metrolinx considered three proposals for this spur. In a 2011 proposal, the spur would have branched off west of Oshawa GO Station, crossed over Highway 401 and Stellar Drive on bridges, turned east passing under Thornton Road and under CP Rail&#x27;s GM spur servicing a General Motors Canada manufacturing plant.
In February 2020, Metrolinx proposed instead that the GO spur branch off east of Oshawa GO Station and utilize the existing GM spur to connect to the CPR corridor.
However, in November 2020, CP Rail advised Metrolinx to develop an independent alignment as the GM plant it served at the south end of the GM spur would reopen. Thus, in 2021, Metrolinx proposed a separate alignment east of Oshawa GO to cross Highway 401 on a new bridge parallel to the GM spur bridge, and then cross over that spur on another bridge to run eastwards parallel to CP Rail&#x27;s Belleville Subdivision. Metrolinx prefers its 2021 proposal.

The expansion project would cost about $730 million and include new signal infrastructure, seven new bridges, and upgrades to at-grade level crossings.

By June 2023, Bowmanville Construction Partners (BCP) was selected as the construction manager to advise on the design and construction management for the Bowmanville Extension. BCP is a partnership between Ledcor CMI Ltd. and Dragados Canada Inc.

===Corridor expansion===
The Lakeshore East Rail Corridor Expansion project is to prepare the Lakeshore East line for the addition of a fourth track and for electrification. Construction tasks along the corridor include:&lt;ref name=&quot;Metrolinx-2022/03/02&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Widening of the Warden Avenue overpass bridge.
* Widening of the Danforth Avenue overpass bridge.
* Constructing retaining walls along the railway embankment between Wolcott Avenue and Warden Avenue.
* Constructing a retaining wall along the railway embankment between Main Street and Victoria Park Avenue.
* Constructing a retaining wall along the railway embankment in the Small&#x27;s Creek area.
* Widening the railway embankment between the Don River and Gerrard Street to accommodate four GO train tracks plus two tracks for the planned Ontario Line.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metrolinx-2021/06/02&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Building the East Harbour Transit Hub providing four tracks for GO trains plus two tracks for the Ontario Line.

==Rouge River bridge==

The Rouge River bridge carries GO Transit&#x27;s Lakeshore East line over the Rouge River at the city limits of both Toronto and Pickering. Constructed about 1905, the bridge is listed as a provincial heritage property. It has two ashlar stone masonry end piers supporting a steel deck truss structure. It is one of only a few bridges of this design in the Greater Toronto Area.

In late 2021, Metrolinx started rehabilitation work to extend the life of the bridge by another 20 years. Because of its heritage status, Metrolinx decided not to replace the bridge. Rehabilitation of the bridge was completed in late 2022.

<text>The use of profanity in films has often been controversial, but has increased significantly in recent decades. The word, &quot;fuck&quot;, is repeatedly used for the documentary film of the same name. It is thought to be the vulgar term most used in film. The Hays Code banned the use of profanity outright, but the Motion Picture Association established a system of ratings to use as a guide and have each films with inappropriate content in 1968. In 1970, &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; became the first mainstream American film under the system to use the word &quot;fuck&quot;. The Motion Picture Association film rating system assigns a PG-13 rating if the film contains the word used once and not in the context of sex. The R rating is normally required, if the film contains more than one utterance or if the word is used in a sexual context. However, there are exceptions to the rule. In some cases, filmmakers appealed the rating because audiences may avoid all R-rated films about profanity. Censors have been more lenient about the word in films that portray historical events. The ratings system is voluntary and there is no legal requirement that filmmakers submit their films to be rated. The list of non-pornographic and English language feature films has over 150 counts for the word &quot;fuck&quot; (or one of its derivatives), ordered by the number of such uses. It does not contain spoken uses of instances that are preceded by “mother”. Bronagh Gallagher and Joe Pesci are tied for using the word.

<text>Louis Bromfield (December 27, 1896 – March 18, 1956) was an American writer and conservationist. A bestselling novelist in the 1920s, he reinvented himself as a farmer in the late 1930s and became one of the earliest proponents of sustainable and organic agriculture in the United States. He won the Pulitzer Prize for the Novel in 1927 for &quot;Early Autumn&quot;, founded the experimental Malabar Farm near Mansfield, Ohio, and played an important role in the early environmental movement.

==Early life and education==
Lewis Brumfield was born in Mansfield, Ohio, in 1896 to Charles Brumfield, a bank cashier and real estate speculator, and Annette Marie Coulter Brumfield, the daughter of an Ohio farmer. (Brumfield later changed the spelling of his name to &quot;Louis Bromfield&quot; because he thought it looked more distinguished.)

As a boy, Bromfield loved working on his grandfather&#x27;s farm. In 1914, he enrolled in Cornell University to study agriculture. Yet his family&#x27;s deteriorating financial situation forced him to drop out after only one semester. Deeply in debt, his parents sold their house in central Mansfield and moved to Bromfield&#x27;s grandfather&#x27;s farm on the outskirts of town. 

==Career==
From 1915 to 1916, Bromfield struggled to revive the unproductive family farm, an experience he later wrote about bitterly in his autobiographical novel &quot;The Farm&quot;. In 1916, he enrolled in Columbia University to study journalism, where he was initiated into the fraternal organization Phi Delta Theta. His time at Columbia was brief; he left after less than a year to volunteer in World War I with the American Field Service.

Bromfield served in Section 577 of the U.S. Army Ambulance Corps and was attached to the French infantry. He saw major action during the Ludendorff Offensive and the 100 Days Offensive and was briefly captured by the German army in the summer of 1918. Though he later claimed to have been awarded the Croix de Guerre, there is no evidence of this decoration in French or American military records.

Bromfield was discharged from the army in 1919. He found work in New York City as a journalist, critic and publicity manager, among other jobs. In 1921, he married the socialite Mary Appleton Wood during a small ceremony near her family home in Ipswich, Massachusetts. They had three daughters, Ann Bromfield (1925-2001), Hope Bromfield (1927-2016) and Ellen Bromfield (1932-2019).

In 1924, Bromfield published his first novel, &quot;The Green Bay Tree&quot;, which featured a headstrong, independent female protagonist — a feature that recurred in many of his later books. A second novel, &quot;Possession&quot;, was published in 1925. Stuart Sherman, John Farrar and other leading critics of the day praised the quality of his early fiction.

=== Paris and Hollywood ===
In November 1925, Bromfield moved to Paris, where he became associated with many of the central figures of the Lost Generation, especially Gertrude Stein and Ernest Hemingway. His third novel, &quot;Early Autumn&quot;, a harsh portrait of his wife&#x27;s Puritan New England background, won the 1927 Pulitzer Prize. “He is, of all the young American novelists, pre-eminently the best and most vital,” John Carter wrote that year in the &quot;New York Times&quot;.

Bromfield continued to write best-selling novels in the late 1920s and early 1930s, including &quot;A Good Woman&quot;, &quot;The Strange Case of Miss Annie Spraag&quot; and &quot;The Farm&quot;, an autobiographical novel that romanticized his family&#x27;s agrarian past. He also worked briefly in Hollywood as a contract screenwriter for Samuel Goldwyn, Jr.

=== Senlis and India ===
In 1930, he moved into a renovated 16th-century rectory, the Presbytère St-Etienne, in Senlis, north of Paris. There he built an elaborate garden on the banks of the River Nonette, where he hosted parties that were well known among artists, writers and socialites of the period. Regular guests included Gertrude Stein, Alice B. Toklas, Elsa Schiaparelli, Dolly Wilde, Leslie Howard, Noël Haskins Murphy, Douglas Fairbanks, Sir Francis Cyril Rose, F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. Janet Flanner, who was a frequent witness to the weekly gatherings at Bromfield&#x27;s Senlis estate, once said that Bromfield &quot;collected people (and noted their value) the way some men do stamps.&quot;

Bromfield&#x27;s passion for horticulture increased over the course of the 1930s. He learned techniques of intensive gardening from his peasant neighbors in Senlis and formed a close bond with Edith Wharton, who designed the formal gardens at the Pavillon Colombe, her estate in nearby Saint-Brice-Sous-Fôret.

During this period, Bromfield also made two long trips to India. He visited Sir Albert Howard’s soil institute in the state of Indore (where Bromfield was exposed to early organic farming methods) and spent time in Baroda City (present-day Vadodara) as a guest of Sayajirao Gaekwad III, the Maharajah of Baroda. His travels informed one of his most critically acclaimed bestsellers, &quot;The Rains Came&quot; (1937), which was adapted into a popular 1939 film starring Myrna Loy and Tyrone Power. He later used proceeds from this book to finance Malabar Farm, saying that “nothing could be more appropriate than giving the farm an Indian name because India made it possible.”

At the end of the Spanish Civil War, Bromfield served as the chairman of the Paris-based Emergency Committee for American Wounded, which helped repatriate volunteers who had fought in the Abraham Lincoln Brigades. He later received the French Legion of Honor for this effort. An outspoken critic of Neville Chamberlain’s policy of appeasement (most notably in the 1939 book &quot;England, Dying Oligarchy&quot;), he left Europe shortly after the Munich Agreement with a hazy plan to move to Ohio and raise his children on an “honest-to-God farm.”

=== Malabar Farm and The Friends of the Land ===
In December 1938, Bromfield purchased 600 acres of worn-out farmland near the town of Lucas in Pleasant Valley, Richland County, Ohio. He built a 19-room Greek Revival-style farmhouse that he dubbed the Big House. Using expertise and labor from New Deal agencies like the Soil Conservation Service and Civilian Conservation Corps, Bromfield rehabilitated his land and in the process learned the principles of soil conservation. He later turned Malabar into a showcase for what he called the “New Agriculture.” Among the novel farming techniques that he promoted at Malabar were the use of green manures, contour plowing, “trash farming,” sheet composting and strip cropping.

In 1941, Bromfield became first vice president of the Friends of the Land, a new national volunteer organization allied with the U.S. Soil Conservation Service, that sought to correct the ruinous farming practices that had culminated in the Dust Bowl and other incidents of widespread soil erosion in the 1930s. The organization brought together many prominent voices in 20th century ecology and agriculture, including Paul B. Sears, Hugh Hammond Bennett and Aldo Leopold. Bromfield used his celebrity to promote the work of agricultural reformers, including Edward Faulkner, whose 1943 book &quot;Plowman’s Folly&quot; criticized the moldboard plow and advocated “trash farming” (a forerunner to no-till agriculture) to avoid erosion and maintain soil fertility. Bromfield also helped popularize the organization&#x27;s journal, &quot;The Land&quot;, which featured contributions from E.B. White, John Dos Passos, Henry A. Wallace, Aldo Leopold and Rachel Carson, among many others. Bromfield established Malabar&#x27;s national reputation in 1945 by hosting the wedding of his good friend Humphrey Bogart to Lauren Bacall. Bromfield served as best man. Malabar was often visited by celebrities, including Kay Francis, Joan Fontaine, Ina Claire, Mayo Methot and James Cagney. E.B. White captured the atmosphere of the farm in a 1948 poem in the &quot;New Yorker&quot;:  Strangers arriving by every train,

Bromfield terracing against the rain,

Catamounts crying, mowers mowing,

Guest rooms full to overflowing,

Boxers in every room of the house,

Cows being milked to Brahms and Strauss,

Kids arriving by van and pung,

Bromfield up to his eyes in dung,

Sailors, trumpeters, mystics, actors,

All of them wanting to drive the tractors,

All of them eager to husk the corn,

Some of them sipping their drinks till morn […]

=== Decline and death ===
Bromfield&#x27;s newfound interest in agriculture and environmentalism coincided with a collapse of his literary reputation. Critics like Malcolm Cowley, Orville Prescott and Edmund Wilson dismissed his later fiction as contrived and superficial. Yet Bromfield&#x27;s books continued to be popular with readers; his 1947 novel &quot;Colorado&quot; sold more than 1 million copies. He also began writing a series of memoirs about agriculture and the environment, beginning with the best-selling &quot;Pleasant Valley&quot; (1945).

As Bromfield&#x27;s literary career faltered, he began to run into major financial difficulties, compounded by the high cost of maintaining his experimental farm and his lavish lifestyle. Among many failed business schemes, he tried to raise capital by creating satellite versions of Malabar in Wichita Falls, Texas and Itatiba, Brazil. After the death of his wife Mary in 1952, he began a relationship with the billionaire heiress Doris Duke, who shared his interest in horticulture and conservation. Bromfield told a newspaper reporter early in 1956 that he and Duke “might get married.” But their romance was cut short because of his deteriorating health. He died of multiple myeloma on March 18, 1956 at the University Hospital in Columbus.

==Influence and legacy==
After Bromfield&#x27;s death, Malabar Farm was eventually turned into a state park and tourist attraction. Malabar Farm State Park hosts thousands of annual visitors and maintains some aspects of Bromfield&#x27;s management philosophy. One of the park&#x27;s notable features is the Doris Duke Woods, named for Doris Duke, whose donation helped rescue Malabar from development after Bromfield&#x27;s death.

Many of Bromfield&#x27;s agricultural writings remain in print. Farmers and environmentalists such as Wendell Berry and Joel Salatin have cited Bromfield as an important influence. In 1989, Louis Bromfield was posthumously elected to the Ohio Agricultural Hall of Fame, and in December 1996, the centennial of his birth, the Ohio Department of Agriculture placed a bust of him in the lobby named for him at the department&#x27;s new headquarters in Reynoldsburg, Ohio.

Bromfield&#x27;s youngest daughter Ellen Bromfield Geld continued her father&#x27;s work in Brazil, where she and her husband Carson Geld moved in 1952. They built a farm, Fazenda Pau d’Alho, and Ellen became a well-known newspaper columnist and author. She died in 2019.

<text>Made is a 2001 American crime comedy film written, directed and co-produced by Jon Favreau. It stars Favreau, Vince Vaughn, Peter Falk, and Sean Combs. It was both Favreau&#x27;s feature directorial debut and Combs&#x27;s acting debut.

==Plot==
Bobby (Favreau) has ties to the local mafia boss, Max (Falk), but works as an honest mason for Max&#x27;s construction projects. He fights in amateur boxing matches on the side, but his career is lackluster (five wins, five losses, one draw). Struggling to support his stripper girlfriend Jessica and her daughter Chloe, Bobby decides to do a mafia job for Max. Against his better judgment, he brings along his ne&#x27;er-do-well friend Ricky.

Bobby and Ricky go to New York to act as Max&#x27;s representatives for a money laundering deal with his East Coast partner, Ruiz. They meet Jimmy, who will be their driver, and Horrace, who is connected to both Max and Ruiz. Ricky and Bobby squabble throughout their trip as Ricky tries to live large while Bobby wants to stay cautious and stick to the letter of Max&#x27;s instructions. Ruiz has a low opinion of the pair but sends them off to show his criminal contact, the Welshman, a good time. Gaffing several times along the way, the pair eventually manage to arrange a deal between Ruiz and the Welshman&#x27;s Westie contacts.

Ricky grows suspicious of Ruiz and insists they bring a gun to their meeting with the Westies. Bobby adamantly refuses. On the day of the meeting, Ricky has disappeared, but Jimmy insists that Bobby carry on with the meeting. As Bobby begins to grow suspicious of Jimmy, he meets with the Welshman and the Westies. The Westies double-cross Bobby and the Welshman, but Ricky arrives from a side entrance with a gun. A Westie recognizes Ricky&#x27;s weapon as a starter pistol and a fight breaks out. Jimmy arrives with a real pistol and sends the boys away while he deals with the Westies.

Back in Los Angeles, Bobby severs all business ties with Max. Arriving home, he discovers Jessica in bed with a client and snorting cocaine. Bobby tries to convince Jessica to clean up her act for Chloe&#x27;s sake, but Jessica refuses. Instead, she asks that Bobby take custody of Chloe and leave. In an epilogue set at Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s, we learn that Bobby and Ricky are now raising Chloe together, although the two friends still bicker constantly.

==Cast==
==Connections to other films==
Because the film is written by Jon Favreau and stars Favreau and Vince Vaughn, it is commonly misinterpreted as a sequel to &quot;Swingers&quot;. The license plate of Jimmy&#x27;s Limo, &quot;DBLDN11,&quot; is a reference to a blackjack strategy articulated in &quot;Swingers&quot; that one should &quot;always double down on an 11.&quot;

During Dustin Diamond&#x27;s cameo, Ricky refers to him as &quot;Screech,&quot; referencing Diamond&#x27;s character on &quot;Saved By the Bell&quot;.

==Reception==
The critical reception of the film was generally positive, receiving a 70% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on 105 reviews, with an average score of 6.3/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads &quot;Not as good as &quot;Swingers&quot;, but it&#x27;s still witty and goofy enough for some laughs.&quot; The film received a limited release in the United States and had almost no release overseas. It had a world box office gross of $5.5 million.

<text>&quot;The Parallel&quot; is episode 113 of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. In this episode an astronaut returns from a voyage to find the world not quite the same as he remembers it. It was an early example of the concept of mirror or alternate universes. The &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; episode &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot; was another example, although the differences between the characters in the two &quot;Star Trek&quot; alternate universes were quite noticeable. The concept has also been used by both DC Comics and Marvel Comics in their comic books and cinematic universes.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
An astronaut, Major Robert Gaines, is orbiting Earth in his space capsule. Suddenly, his communication systems stop functioning and he blacks out, waking up on Earth with no memory of his return. He appears to be none the worse for his experiences and is released to the custody of his family.

However, inconsistencies quickly pop up. His daughter senses that he is not the same person. His house has a white picket fence that he&#x27;s never seen, though his wife insists that it was there when they bought the house. Everyone calls him Colonel (confirmed by the rank insignia on his uniform) when he knows he&#x27;s a Major, and he insists that the President of the United States is John F. Kennedy, a man whom no one else has ever heard of. Gaines concludes that he has slipped into a parallel universe. His acquaintances see this as nonsense until a mechanic reports his space capsule is not completely identical to the one he was sent out in. Gaines is summoned to examine the capsule, but when he approaches it he is gradually returned to the point at which he left his own universe.

He lands his craft safely and reports what happened to his superiors. They are prepared to write it off as a nightmare, but controllers on the ground subsequently receive another transmission—from &quot;Colonel&quot; Robert Gaines. The transmission cuts out a few seconds later, and the Colonel disappears from radar. The Major returns home and happily confirms that his daughter now recognizes him and the white picket fence is absent.

==Closing narration==

*Jacqueline Scott as Helen Gaines
*Shari Lee Bernath as Maggie Gaines
*Frank Aletter as Colonel Bill Connacher

*William Sargent as Project Manager
*Paul Comi as Psychiatrist

==Legacy==
&quot;Parallels&quot;, an episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, has plot elements similar to this story

&quot;Post Traumatic Slide Syndrome,&quot; an episode of &quot;Sliders&quot; (the entire premise of which deals with four people who &quot;Slide&quot; into parallel dimensions through a wormhole, particularly in its first two seasons) centers on the four main characters finding a dimension which they believe to be their own, with only one character noticing the minor changes until the climax of the episode.

<doc id="1321179" wikidata="Q642787" url="?curid=1321179" title="Atafu">
<text>Atafu, formerly known as the Duke of York Group, is a group of 52 coral islets within Tokelau in the south Pacific Ocean, north of Samoa. With a land area of , it is the smallest of the three islands that constitute Tokelau. It is an atoll and surrounds a central lagoon, which covers some . The atoll lies south of the equator at 8° 35&#x27; South, 172° 30&#x27; West. Atafu is the northernmost area under New Zealand sovereignty.

==Population==
According to the 2016 census, 541 people officially live on Atafu (although only 413 were present the night the census was taken). Of those present, 78% belong to the Congregational Church. The main settlement on the atoll is located on Atafu Island in its northwestern corner. The Presbyterian church was established on the island in 1858, but today almost all of the residents belong to the Congregational Christian Church. The first village on Atafu was established at its southern end: Residents built houses along the lagoon shore to take best advantage of the cooling trade winds.

Fishing is traditionally done by the men on Atafu, and they are highly skilled at it. They use many traditional methods that are passed on from fathers to sons. They create very effective lures, fish traps, nets, and seines. They commonly use the technique called &quot;noose fishing&quot;, in which a circle of rope, tied with a noose knot, is dangled in the water; a large fish swims into the rope circle, lured by bait, and the noose is then tightened around its body, holding it fast. They also make well-crafted canoes, which they use for their fishing expeditions.

==Geography==

Atafu lies in the Pacific hurricane belt. In January 1914, a massive storm demolished the church and most of the houses on the islands, and wiped out many of the coconut palms.

The atoll is roughly triangular in shape and encloses a lagoon some north to south by east to west at its widest point. It is low-lying, reaching a maximum altitude of only some , and is heavily vegetated with coconut palms and other trees, with undergrowth similar to that found on many small central Pacific islands. Lizards, rats, and seabirds are common on Atafu island. The atoll attracts a wide variety of fish in large numbers.

The eastern side of the lagoon is a nearly continuous thin strip of land with one small break halfway along its length. In contrast, the western side is composed of reef and several distinct islands, notably the inverted V shape of Atafu Island in the north, Alofi, which extends into the lagoon from the western reef, and the L-shaped Fenualoa in the southwest. The smaller Tamaseko Island lies in the lagoon close to Alofi.

The reef which connects the islands of the atoll is shallow enough that it is possible to walk between the islands at low tide. This also means that there is no boat passage to the lagoon, although the ocean becomes deep very close to the reef. This allows for good anchorage, but also makes for rough seas close to the reef. The flatness of the atoll and its location within the tropical cyclone belt has led to damage to island properties on occasion.

===Important Bird Area===
Some 70 ha of the southern and south-western parts of the atoll have been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because the site supports breeding colonies of brown and black noddiess and common white terns, with about 30,000 breeding pairs estimated in 2011.

==History==

It is likely that Polynesians visited the island in ancient times, but they may not have settled there. The European discovery of the atoll came on 21 June 1765; it was made by John Byron, of . Byron found no one living on the island at that time. He named the island &quot;Duke of York&#x27;s island&quot;. According to Tokelauan oral tradition, Atafu was established by a man named Tonuia and his wife named Lagimaina, along with their seven children.

In 1859, the U.S. Guano Company claimed Duke of York along with a number of other Tokelauan atolls under the U.S. Guano Islands Act. The U.S. State Department bonded the claim in 1860. However, many of these islands were not worked by the company and in 1889 they were claimed by Great Britain as part of the Union Islands. In 1916, the Union Islands were annexed to the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony and then, in 1925, reassigned to the Dominion of New Zealand under the administration of Territory of Western Samoa. In 1979, as part of the Treaty of Tokehega, the U.S. formally renounced its prior claim on Atafu and the other Tokelauan islands now under New Zealand sovereignty, and a maritime boundary between Tokelau and American Samoa was established.

On 26 August 2007, Ralph Tuijn, who was attempting to row a boat from South America to Australia, crash-landed on Atafu. On 26 November 2010, three teenage boys from Atafu were rescued after having drifted for 50 days in the Pacific.

<text>Fakaofo, formerly known as Bowditch Island, is a South Pacific Ocean atoll located in the Tokelau Group. The actual land area is only about 3 km2 (1.1 sq mi), consisting of islets on a coral reef surrounding a central lagoon of some 45 km2. According to the 2006 census 483 people officially live on Fakaofo (however just 370 were present at census night). Of those present 70% belong to the Congregational Church and 22% to the Catholic Church.

== Geography and government ==

The main settlement on the island is Fale on Fale Islet, towards the western side of the atoll. Located two kilometres to the west of it is the relatively large Fenua Fala Islet, where a second settlement was established in 1960. Other islets in the group include Teafua, Nukumatau, Nukulakia, Fenua Loa, Saumatafanga, Motu Akea, Matangi, Lalo, and Mulifenua.

Fakaofo&#x27;s Council of Elders is made up of citizens over the age of 60.

==History==

The island was sighted by the whale ship &quot;General Jackson&quot; in 1835 and named DeWolf Island after their ship&#x27;s owner. The &quot;General Jackson&quot; returned in 1839.

The island was then named &quot;Bowditch&quot; (after Nathaniel Bowditch), this island was visited by the American ship which was part of the first American voyage of discovery – The United States Exploring Expedition (also known as &quot;the Ex Ex&quot; or &quot;the Wilkes Expedition&quot;), 1838–1842, United States Navy Lieutenant Charles Wilkes commanding. Nathaniel Bowditch (1773–1838) was a noted American navigator who wrote a famous two-volume encyclopedia of navigation and sailing that is still used and published today by the Defense Mapping Agency Topographic Center (DMATC).
In &quot;Twenty Years Before The Mast&quot;, Charles Erskine wrote &quot;The people found on this island had no knowledge of fire, which I believe, is the only instance of the kind on record.&quot;

In a village on the island is a coral slab monument personifying Tui Tokelau, a god once worshiped in the islands.

In 1889, Fakaofu and several other Tokuelauan islands were claimed by Great Britain as part of the Union Islands. In 1916, the Union Islands were annexed to the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony and then, in 1925, reassigned to the Dominion of New Zealand under the administration of Territory of Western Samoa. Unlike Atafu and Nukunono, no U.S. claims under the Guano Island Act were ever made on Fakaofu. Despite this, in 1979, as part of the Treaty of Tokehega, the U.S. formally renounced its prior claim on all Tokelauan islands now under New Zealand sovereignty, including Fakaofu, and a maritime boundary between Tokelau and American Samoa was established.

==Climate crisis==
Five-metre high concrete walls surround one of Fakaofo&#x27;s atolls, that were constructed by residents to protect the islet from rising sea levels.

<text>Nukunonu, formerly known as Duke of Clarence Island, is the largest atoll within Tokelau, a dependency of New Zealand in the south Pacific Ocean. It comprises 30 islets surrounding a central lagoon, with about of land area and a lagoon surface area of . Motuhaga is the only islet that has inhabitants. It has an estimated population of 531.

==History==

The first European vessel known to have come upon Nukunonu was the Royal Navy ship , in 1791, whose captain, Edward Edwards, named Duke of Clarence Island in honour of Prince William, Duke of Clarence and St Andrews (1765-1837), the third son of King George III and later king himself, as William IV. At the time, the &quot;Pandora&quot; was searching for mutineers from . During the early 19th century, Nukunonu&#x27;s inhabitants were converted to Roman Catholicism by Samoan missionaries.

In 1859, the U.S. Guano Company claimed Duke of Clarance along with a number of other Tokelauan atolls under the U.S. Guano Islands Act. The U.S. State Department bonded the claim in 1860. However, many of these islands were not worked by the company and in 1889 they were claimed by Great Britain as part of the Union Islands. In 1916, the Union Islands were annexed to the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony and then, in 1925, reassigned to the Dominion of New Zealand under the administration of Territory of Western Samoa. In 1979, as part of the Treaty of Tokehega, the U.S. formally renounced its prior claim on Nukunonu and the other Tokelauan islands now under New Zealand sovereignty, and a maritime boundary between Tokelau and American Samoa was established.

==Demography==
The main settlement on the atoll is located on Nukunonu Island at the southwestern edge of the lagoon with a concrete bridge joining the two areas of settlement. The island&#x27;s residents depend upon coconuts, pandanus, and marine life for subsistence. Fresh water is scarce; concrete water tanks are incorporated into the bases of newly built houses to collect rainwater from the roofs. Shipping is hampered by the lack of an adequate anchorage. Satellite TV dishes are beginning to appear on some houses in the village.

Tokelau has one hotel, the Luana Liki Hotel, and one resort, Falefa Resort, both situated on Nukunonu. Few tourists visit the country and tourism is not widely promoted. There is ambivalence about tourism, with some Tokelauans wanting to keep the country unaffected by the outside world. Despite this, visitors are greeted with traditional Polynesian hospitality. The Luana Liki Hotel functions mainly to accommodate official visitors, which have included the New Zealand Prime Minister and Governor General. There is one main shop in Nukunonu which sells a limited range of products. Due to the vagaries of shipping schedules, it is at times short of goods.

Local administration consists of a Taupulega (Council of Elders), made up of heads of family groups and two elected members. According to the 2006 census 426 people live on Nukunonu, of which more than 95% belong to the Catholic Church.

The most recent population count of 2019 found the population at 531.

==Environment==
===Important Bird Area===
Some 60 ha of the eastern side of the atoll has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because the site supports breeding colonies of brown and black noddies and common white terns, with about 20,000 breeding pairs estimated in 2011.

== Economy ==
Coconut (&quot;Cocos nucifera&quot;) is an important food source here. The Black Rat (&quot;Rattus rattus&quot;) arrived with European exploration and can take 50% of the yield, but the native Polynesian Rat (&quot;R. exulans&quot;) will do the same amount of damage anywhere the Black Rat has not become dominant. Rodent control and research on rodent control are important to deal with the problem.

<text>Snakes and Ladders / The Best of Faces was an October 1976 best-of album (the 7th album and 2nd compilation album) by British rock group Faces. While the first released Faces compilation was a repackaging of the group&#x27;s first two LPs as a double album, this US-only release presented the first attempt to compile the popular songs from the group after they had disbanded in 1975. Featuring photography by Tom Wright and unique cover art by guitarist Ronnie Wood, it was only eventually superseded in the US market by the CD compilation &quot;Good Boys... When They&#x27;re Asleep&quot; in 1999.

The selections are however heavily biased in favour of Rod Stewart&#x27;s contribution to the group, with only one track featuring Wood on vocals, and none featuring Ronnie Lane, the group&#x27;s secondary vocalist and songwriter. Although he had left the band in 1973, Lane was a prominent founder member of the band and sang on and solely composed several tracks on each of the group&#x27;s four original studio albums, but his songwriting is also under-represented here with his contributions confined to co-credits with Stewart and/or Wood. Lane is also not pictured in the collage of snapshots featured on the cover, while Jesse Ed Davis - who was only hired for the group&#x27;s final tour of fall 1975 - does appear in some of them, despite never appearing on any of the studio tracks recorded by the group. Subsequent compilations, however, would go to great lengths to redress this collection&#x27;s lack of representation of Lane&#x27;s work - the first of these being a 1977 UK/European-only double-LP retrospective simply titled &quot;The Best Of The Faces&quot;, which effectively served as this album&#x27;s expanded and more balanced counterpart in non-US markets.

The track listing of the original vinyl release of this compilation still remains unique however, in that the version of &quot;Had Me a Real Good Time&quot; presented there is the original 1970 single release, which is a noticeably different earlier mix to the 1971 &quot;Long Player&quot; album version (later reissues would substitute this mix with a short edit of the &#x27;Long Player&#x27; mix). The original single mix, which runs at 3.49, has still not been recompiled elsewhere or released on CD as of 2019.

&quot;Pineapple and the Monkey&quot; would not appear on a Faces compilation again until the release of &quot;Faces: The Definitive Rock Collection&quot; in 2007.

<doc id="1321250" wikidata="Q2307699" url="?curid=1321250" title="Bitch (Meredith Brooks song)">
<text>&quot;Bitch&quot;, also known as &quot;Bitch (Nothing in Between)&quot;, is a song by American singer-songwriter Meredith Brooks and co-written with Shelly Peiken. It was released in March 1997 by Capitol Records as the lead single from Brooks&#x27; second album, &quot;Blurring the Edges&quot; (1997). The song was produced by punk notable Geza X.

In the United States, the song steadily rose on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, eventually peaking at number two for four weeks. The song also peaked at number two in Australia and Canada and reached number six in the United Kingdom. In Australasia, at the APRA Music Awards of 1998, it won the award for Most Performed Foreign Work. The song ranked at number 79 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Songs of the &#x27;90s&quot;, and was nominated for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance and Best Rock Song at the 40th Annual Grammy Awards.

==Writing and inspiration==
&quot;Bitch&quot; was written by Brooks and Shelly Peiken. The song originated from feelings of frustration that Peiken felt in regards to her stalling music career. These feelings of frustration inspired the song&#x27;s opening lyrics—&quot;I hate the world today&quot;—which resulted in Peiken conceptualizing a song titled &quot;Bitch&quot;. Peiken reached out to Brooks to collaborate on the song, commenting: &quot;[Brooks] had a lot of spunk, and I knew she could relate to this idea.&quot; Brooks claimed that she was additionally inspired to write the song after reading the writings of psychiatrist Carl Jung. The song was written in a single day in a spare bedroom of Peiken&#x27;s home in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles. In an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot;, Brooks described the song as being about self-acceptance, referring to the word &quot;bitch&quot; as a term of endearment. Brooks intended to reclaim the word, removing the pejorative connotations surrounding it. She further explained the meaning of the song:

I&#x27;m not &quot;an angry young girl&quot; - or whatever the phrase of the moment is - but I&#x27;m human. It&#x27;s not to excuse ranting and raving, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything wrong with having &quot;a mood&quot;. I don&#x27;t think we all need to keep the mask on all the time.

Capitol Records was initially hesitant to release &quot;Bitch&quot; as the lead single from &quot;Blurring the Edges&quot; (1997) due to the song&#x27;s explicit lyrical content. The label&#x27;s vice president of artists and repertoire, Perry Watts-Russell, and producer Geza X both expressed their concerns about the song&#x27;s lyrics potentially having a negative impact on its commercial performance. Peiken explained that the record label considered censoring the song, although she and Brooks convinced the label to release the song to airplay with the lyrics intact. Following the release and subsequent success of the song, Brooks commented that she believed &quot;Bitch&quot; achieved its intended purpose of being a &quot;celebration of Everywoman&#x27;s multiple psyches.&quot;

==Composition==
According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, the song is written in the key of A major and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 92 beats per minute. Brooks&#x27; vocal range spans two octaves, from E3 to C5.

==Critical reception==
Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic cited &quot;Bitch&quot; as an &quot;Alanis clone&quot;, critiquing the &quot;semi-profane lyrics to the caterwauling chorus&quot;. Other music critics similarly compared the song to that of singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette, with &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; all making note of the musical similarities between Morissette&#x27;s work at the time in comparison with &quot;Bitch&quot;. Record producer Geza X deliberately sought a hit single that sounded like Morissette&#x27;s songs, yet he was fired soon afterward even when &quot;Bitch&quot; achieved major success, due to conflicts with Brooks&#x27; record label. David Fricke from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; remarked its &quot;the notice-me snap&quot;.

==Chart performance==
In the United States, &quot;Bitch&quot; debuted at number 57 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart for the issue dated April 26, 1997. The song spent a total of 35 weeks on the chart, peaking at number two for the issue dated July 12, 1997.

==Music video==
The accompanying music video for &quot;Bitch&quot; was directed by Paul Andressen in Los Angeles, California. The video features Brooks on guitar while performing the song on a shimmering floral background. Throughout the course of the song, several objects typically associated with women are shown floating around the singer.

==Live performances==
The song was performed as part of Brooks&#x27; opening set on the Rolling Stones&#x27; Bridges to Babylon Tour. Brooks left the stage early after the audience began booing and throwing bottles, batteries, and coins at her. In response, Brooks cited the crowd&#x27;s behavior as misogynistic and illustrative of the dangers of mob mentality.

==Legacy==
In 2017, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked &quot;Bitch&quot; number 50 in their list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Pop Songs of 1997&quot;, writing, &quot;You undoubtedly remember the thing for its cathartic chorus, in which Meredith Brooks declares herself to be the spectrum of all things feminine and human — though only one of them was memorable to enough to risk getting censored on top 40 radio. Still, when you listen next, pay attention to the underrated verses; Brooks grinning and teasing her way through a relationship that attempts in vain to pigeonhole her personality (&quot;Yesterday I cried/ You must&#x27;ve been relieved to see the softer side&quot;).&quot; In 2022, Avril Lavigne cited &quot;Bitch&quot; as the one song she wishes she could have written; she further expressed interest in covering the song.

==Covers and parodies==

In 2000, Australian comedian Chris Franklin released a parody of the song titled &quot;Bloke&quot; with the lyrics changed to reflect the stereotypical Australian male lifestyle. The song peaked at number one on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart.

American comedy music group Raymond and Scum parodied the song as &quot;Blair Witch&quot;, a parody about the film &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; (1999). Kim Gordon of the band Sonic Youth has stated that their song &quot;Female Mechanic Now on Duty&quot; was inspired by &quot;Bitch&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s worth mentioning,&quot; says Kim, &quot;that the song, &#x27;Female Mechanic on Duty&#x27; was inspired by &#x27;Bitch&#x27; by that famous Lilith-type female singer, Meredith Brooks. It&#x27;s an answer song.&quot; In 2016, Britney Spears gave a spoken word performance of the song during her &quot;&quot; concert residency.

<text>Lee Andrew Hendrie (born 18 May 1977) is an English former professional footballer and pundit for Sky Sports.

As a player, he was a midfielder who notably played in the Premier League for Aston Villa where he spent fourteen years. He also played for the England U21 and England B sides, and earned one full cap for England in 1998. He has also played in Football League for Stoke City, Sheffield United, Leicester City, Derby County, Brighton &amp; Hove Albion and Bradford City.

Following a spell in Indonesia with Bandung he became a journeyman in non-league football, playing for Daventry Town, Kidderminster Harriers, Chasetown, Redditch United, Tamworth, Corby Town, Highgate United, Basford United, Nuneaton Griff and Gloucestershire based Montpellier FC.

==Playing career==

===Aston Villa===
Born in Solihull, Hendrie was red carded on his debut for Aston Villa as a substitute in a 1–0 defeat at Queens Park Rangers on 23 December 1995. He went on to achieve the accolade of the club&#x27;s &quot;Young Player of the Season&quot; award in the 1997–98 season. Whilst at Aston Villa he played in the 2000 FA Cup Final.

After losing his place in the Villa team during the 2005–06 season it seemed Hendrie&#x27;s long spell at Villa Park was coming to an end, with Portsmouth reportedly showing an interest in his services. On 29 September he joined Stoke City on loan, on the recommendation of his father. On 30 January 2007, he extended his loan spell with the Potters until the end of the 2006–07 season. He played 28 times for Stoke scoring three goals which came against Leeds United, Sunderland and Norwich City.

During Hendrie&#x27;s time with Villa, he crashed his Porsche as he tried to make a plane for a European game and his manager Graham Taylor had to deal with other disciplinary matters.

===Sheffield United===
Hendrie signed a three-year contract with Sheffield United after arriving on a free transfer in July 2007, making his debut on the opening day of the season, a 2–2 home draw with Colchester United. However, he was dogged by injuries for the first half of the season. Hendrie scored his first goal for &quot;the Blades&quot; in a 5–0 win over Morecambe in the League Cup in September 2007, but was unable to hold down a regular first-team place as the club struggled in the bottom half of the table. He scored his first league goal for Sheffield United in a 2–1 win over Queens Park Rangers on 12 January 2008.

With the departure of Bryan Robson in February 2008, new manager Kevin Blackwell quickly allowed Hendrie to join Leicester City in an emergency loan deal, with a view to a permanent move. He scored the winning goal for Leicester in a 1–0 win over Scunthorpe United on 29 March 2008 but could not prevent the club&#x27;s relegation to League One and he subsequently returned to Bramall Lane.

In November 2008 he joined Blackpool on loan initially until 1 January 2009, making his debut as a second-half substitute the same day in the West Lancashire derby at home to Preston North End at Bloomfield Road. He was sent off for Blackpool versus Reading on 9 December 2008 and returned to Sheffield United on 31 December 2008 having made six appearances.

Having returned to Bramall Lane once more he vowed to try to force his way into first team contention having been given a wake up call by his time at Blackpool. He made a number of further substitute appearances for &quot;The Blades&quot; up to the end of the season. Having been brought off the bench in the 85th minute of the play off final against Burnley at Wembley he was subsequently sent off after the final whistle had blown for directing foul language at referee Mike Dean. Following &quot;the Blades&quot; unsuccessful play off campaign Hendrie was placed on the transfer list as the club sought to cut its wage bill.

===Derby County===
On 1 September 2009, Hendrie joined Derby County in a swap deal that involved Jordan Stewart moving in the opposite direction. Partly due to injury, Hendrie made just five starts for Derby before he moved to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion on loan for the rest of the season on 23 March 2010. It was announced on 13 May 2010, that he would leave Derby at the end of his contract after just 10 appearances from his nine months with the club.

===Bradford City===
Hendrie was set to join Scottish-side Aberdeen but the deal fell through at the last minute. Instead, he started training with Championship side Reading, but was not offered a contract and was instead offered a short-term deal at his cousin John Hendrie&#x27;s former club Bradford City by manager Peter Taylor. Taylor had previously managed Hendrie for England under-21s. Talking about his signing and the short-term deal, Hendrie said: &quot;These next few weeks will be very interesting for me, and I will knuckle down. I have to use this to build up my fitness and get back to my peak.&quot; 
On 1 January 2011 it was confirmed by Bradford manager Peter Taylor that Hendrie&#x27;s deal would not be extended due to finances and that the player had in fact, left the club. Taylor said &quot;I feel really sorry for him. He has been a superb professional during his time at the football club. Lee&#x27;s a great lad, he&#x27;s still a great player. We have a League Two budget and we could only take this deal so far&quot;. Hendrie had played 14 times for The Bantams and had scored twice.

Hendrie was offered a deal by Conference National side Mansfield Town but turned it down because of a better offer from Bandung, a club from Indonesian breakaway league, Liga Primer Indonesia.

===Bandung===
On 26 January 2011, Indonesian club Bandung announced the signing of Hendrie on a free transfer. Hendrie signed a two-year contract with the Indonesian outfit and was assigned the number 10 jersey. He was both the first Englishman and the first player with Premier League experience to sign for a Liga Primer Indonesia club. He made his debut on 5 February 2011 in a 1–0 defeat against Persema Malang. He scored his first goal for Bandung and provided an assist for Perry Somah on 12 February 2011 in a 3–2 defeat against Batavia Union. On 12 March 2011, he provided another assist for Somah in a 1–0 win against Minangkabau. It was Bandung&#x27;s first win in the 2011 Liga Primer Indonesia. At the end of season Hendrie was released from the club which then folded.

===Non-league football===
Throughout the summer of 2011, Hendrie joined a number of clubs for training and on trial. He was linked with a move to Wrexham but any hopes of that materialising broke down with manager Dean Saunders&#x27; departure to Doncaster Rovers. In July he joined Corby Town on a month&#x27;s trial, however after just three weeks he left on his own accord. In late August, Hendrie agreed to train with Hinckley United, staying with the club for a month and playing in one friendly match at the start of October. Later that month, he signed for Daventry Town until the end of the season. Hendrie was signed by Daventry Town manager Mark Kinsella who was one of his former teammates at Aston Villa.

He made his debut for the club on 15 October 2011 in an FA Cup Third qualifying round match against Nuneaton Town. He played his first league game in a 2–0 loss against Uxbridge three days later. Hendrie&#x27;s first win as a Daventry Town player came on 22 October as Kidsgrove Athletic were beaten 4–3 in the First qualifying round of the FA Trophy. Hendrie&#x27;s younger brother, Stuart, joined him at Daventry on 21 October 2011, signing on a short-team loan deal from Hinckley United.

On 9 November 2011 Hendrie was unveiled by Kidderminster Harriers as having signed on non-contract terms. Allocated the number 34 shirt, he made his league debut on 26 November 2011 as a 60th-minute substitute in a 0–0 home draw with Cambridge United; he would go on to play in a further 14 league matches for Kidderminster before his release in March 2012. Immediately upon his release by Kidderminster, Hendrie signed for Northern Premier League Premier Division side Chasetown, returning to the lower levels of English non-league football after a 5-month absence. His Chasetown debut came in a 1–1 home draw with Matlock Town on 20 March 2012.

On 29 March 2012, Hendrie joined Southern League Premier club Redditch United, the club his father managed from 1991 to 1995, on a non-contract basis until the end of the season. Hendrie joined his brother Stuart at Redditch, the latter once again on loan from parent club Hinckley United.

Hendrie signed for Tamworth in the summer of 2012, taking the number 8 shirt; he made his debut for the club on 6 October 2012 as a 60th-minute substitute for George Baldock in a 2–1 home defeat to Newport County. He announced his retirement from the game in May 2013 to focus on his work as a director at FootieBugs, a football activity programme company for young children. He resumed his playing career in September 2013, joining Corby Town.

Hendrie soon moved on from Corby and on 3 December 2013, he played for Highgate United in their away Midland Football Alliance fixture against A.F.C. Wulfrunians. Hendrie scored and provided an assist on his début for the club in a 3–1 win. However, the club were quick to announce that Hendrie&#x27;s appearance was only a &quot;one-off&quot; and that he had in fact signed for Nottinghamshire-based Basford United on 5 December. He remained dual-registered for Highgate, allowing him to potentially play for the club again (subject to his availability). He made a second appearance for the club two weeks later, on a night when Basford United did not have a fixture.

Hendrie scored on his début for Basford against Armthorpe Welfare. In April 2014 Hendrie stated he was a victim of forgery and that someone had falsified transfer documents claiming he was moving to Tavistock.

Hendrie left Basford United in October 2015. He subsequently played for Montpellier (based in Badsey), and all-conquering Sunday league club Digby Rangers from Birmingham before returning to Redditch United. He then signed for Nuneaton Griff, before returning to Highgate United.

==International career==
Despite his Scottish and Irish parentage, Hendrie represented England, the country of his birth, at international level. He appeared twelve times for the England under-21 team, scoring five goals. Hendrie made a single appearance for the England B in April 1998, a 4-1 victory against Russia B a few months before the 1998 FIFA World Cup but was not selected for the final squad.

He won his only full international cap for England at the age of 21 as a late substitute on 18 November 1998 against the Czech Republic.

==Media career==
Hendrie now works as a pundit for Sky Sports.

In 2019 and 2020, Hendrie featured in both seasons of ITV show Harry&#x27;s Heroes, which featured former football manager Harry Redknapp attempting get a squad of former England international footballers back fit and healthy for a game against Germany legends. Hendrie gained extra praise for opening up on his struggles with mental health.

For Season Two of the Apple TV series Ted Lasso, assistant director Sophie Worger hired former professional player Kasali Casal to manage the soccer choreography. Casal enlisted a team of former professional players to play for the opposition teams facing AFC Richmond during game scenes, these included Hendrie and fellow former Premier League players and Jay Bothroyd, Jermaine Pennant and George Elokobi.

==Personal life==
Lee Hendrie is the son of Scottish former professional footballer Paul Hendrie. Paul Hendrie moved to England in March 1972 to join Birmingham City. Hendrie was born in Birmingham on 18 May 1977. His younger brother, Stuart Hendrie, is also a footballer, who played alongside him at Daventry Town. Hendrie is the cousin of another Scottish professional footballer, John Hendrie.

On 27 January 2012, Hendrie was declared bankrupt by Her Majesty&#x27;s Revenue and Customs at the High Court. During this time, Hendrie twice tried to take his own life.

Aside from his playing career Hendrie is also a director of FootieBugs, a sister company of YogaBugs, which provides football-based activities and events for children aged 2 to 7.

<text>Nadia Santos is a fictional character in the television series &quot;Alias&quot;, and a main character during the series&#x27; fourth season. She is played by Mía Maestro.

==Biography==
Introduced near the end of the third season, Nadia is the daughter resulting from an affair between Irina Derevko and Arvin Sloane. She is the half-sister of Sydney Bristow and Jacqueline Sloane (Arvin&#x27;s daughter with his wife, Emily). According to Irina&#x27;s sister Katya, Nadia was born in a Soviet prison and taken away from Irina the day after her birth. Identified by the Soviets as &quot;The Passenger&quot;, a being with a &quot;direct conduit&quot; to Milo Rambaldi, Nadia spent the first few years of her life as the subject of experimentation, including injection with a &quot;Rambaldi fluid&quot; which triggered her connection to Rambaldi.

According to Elena Derevko (speaking in her guise as Sophia Vargas), Michael Vaughn&#x27;s father Bill kidnapped Nadia from Soviet custody and left her with Vargas. Regardless of the circumstances of her arrival, Nadia grew up in an orphanage in Argentina under the direction of Elena/Sophia. After being attacked by a man in the orphanage one night, Nadia ran away and spent her teen years on the streets, committing some 130 criminal acts including assault and petty theft. At the age of 17 or 18 she was captured by police. Roberto Fox, an Argentine intelligence operative, was impressed by her skill and recruited her into a branch of Argentina&#x27;s intelligence service (SIDE). She spent the next few years being trained as a spy. Eventually, she became romantically involved with Fox.

In reality, Fox was a rogue agent operating for his own interests and not those of Argentina, a fact Nadia learned during a mission to obtain secret documents during which a close friend and colleague was killed. Nadia learned the documents were in fact from the Argentine government. For this betrayal, she shot and killed Roberto Fox upon her return from the mission, however (for reasons not explained) the blame for his murder fell upon César Martinez, a fellow operative who, like Nadia, had been recruited from the streets. She continued working in Argentine intelligence after this event, while Martinez became a freelancer, using the equity of his supposed kill to establish a reputation with criminal organizations.

Santos first meets her half-sister Sydney while undercover posing as a supposedly catatonic woman in a Chechen labor camp. She is being sought by her father, Sloane, who wants to use her connection to Rambaldi to locate an artifact called the Sphere of Life. This artifact is said to house Rambaldi&#x27;s consciousness. The Covenant captures her and injects her with the same Rambaldi fluid she was subjected to as a child. This triggers a &quot;muscle memory&quot;, causing Nadia to write out a complex algebraic equation which, when solved, reveals the coordinates of the Sphere of Life. Sydney, Vaughn and a CIA team then recover Nadia. Later, Sloane approaches her and convinces her to join him on a quest for the Sphere of Life. Nadia says she had moments of lucidity as the fluid wore off and in those times she altered the equation so only she knows the true location of the Sphere.

Between seasons three and four, as shown in season four flashbacks, Nadia and Sloane locate the Sphere of Life in Siena. Nadia, seeing the madness Rambaldi inspires in Sloane grow as they get closer to the artifact, and after having apocalyptic visions upon touching the Sphere, refuses to retrieve it. Sloane berates her and tries to retrieve the Sphere himself, failing and gravely injuring himself. Nadia saves his life and apparently turns the Sphere over to the CIA or the Department of Special Research.

At the start of the fourth season, Nadia had broken ties with her father and returned to Argentina to live a peaceful life. After assisting the newly formed APO unit in rescuing her sister, she accepted a position with the organization, which is a black ops offshoot of the CIA. As of joining APO her code name was Evergreen. Upon learning of her mother&#x27;s supposed death from Sydney, she swore an oath to kill the person responsible for killing Irina, not knowing &quot;Irina&quot; was killed by Jack in order to protect Sydney (it is later revealed Jack actually killed a woman who was genetically doubled to appear as Irina).

Jack led Nadia to believe Irina had been killed by Martin Bishop, a master thief with terrorist connections who had taken Sydney prisoner during an APO mission gone astray. Nadia shot Bishop to death during the mission to rescue Sydney and continued to fire bullets into him until her gun ran out of ammunition.

Nadia continued to try to learn more about her mother, which led her to bond somewhat with Jack. During the fourth season, she was romantically involved with her CIA colleague, Eric Weiss.

Nadia is troubled by a recurring dream in which she and Sydney fight to the death. In the fourth season, she is shot by terrorist Anna Espinosa and left in a medically induced coma for several days, avoiding a second assassination attempt in the hospital thanks to quick thinking on the part of her father. Against medical advice, Jack Bristow revives Nadia from the coma in order to obtain vital information regarding the whereabouts of a chemical bomb stolen by Anna; although Nadia survives this, Jack&#x27;s actions threaten to unravel a larger plan between him and Sloane.

On a mission to stop Elena Derevko from implementing her endgame by activating a giant Mueller device over Russia, Nadia is infected with a compound which turns her into a mindless killing machine and (true to Rambaldi&#x27;s prophecy) she tries to kill her sister. Nadia nearly kills Sydney but is shot by her father. She survives the gunshot and as season 4 ends is in a coma as CIA doctors work to find a cure for her condition.

The character is not a regular during the early episodes of season 5, although the hunt for a cure is shown as a prime motivator for Sloane&#x27;s actions. Nadia does make a non-speaking cameo at the conclusion of the episode &quot;Solo&quot;; in a later episode, Nadia was briefly revived from her coma by Prophet Five as a way of continuing Sloane&#x27;s support.

In the episode &quot;30 Seconds&quot;, Nadia is finally revived permanently when Sloane administers to her a drug designed by Rambaldi, though in order for it to work, he must first kill her (which he does by suffocating her). After her revival, Nadia returns to live with Sydney and wrestle with her feelings towards her father. At the end of the episode, she finally confronts him about his obsession with Rambaldi when she discovers a Rambaldi artifact (&quot;Page 47&quot;) hidden in Sloane&#x27;s home. When she tries to destroy the page Sloane, in a brief fit of madness, pushes her into a glass coffee table. A shard of glass punctures her neck and Nadia is killed.

Nadia appeared in subsequent episodes as an apparition who haunts (and distracts) Sloane as he works to complete his endgame. When Sloane asks her why she is haunting him, she replies it&#x27;s because he wants her to. In the end, as a now immortal Sloane lies seemingly trapped forever in Rambaldi&#x27;s tomb, Nadia&#x27;s apparition appears saying &quot;You&#x27;re all alone&quot;, Sloane retorts with &quot;At least I have you&quot;, to which Nadia replies &quot;No!&quot; and fades away leaving Sloane forever alone.

Nadia spoke English, Portuguese, Spanish, Russian, and German on her missions.

<text>Ophir Pines-Paz (, born 11 July 1961) is an Israeli former politician who served as Minister of Internal Affairs, Minister of Science, Culture &amp; Sport, and as a member of the Knesset for the Labor Party from 1996 until 2010.

==Biography==
Ophir Pines-Paz was born in Rishon LeZion, the eldest of three children. His father, Yehuda, was an optician and technologist and the Weizmann Institute of Science, who had been born in the Netherlands. He had survived the Holocaust and was a member of the Dutch resistance during World War II. His mother, Ruth, was a painter. Pines-Paz graduated from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and holds a M.A. in Public Policy from Tel Aviv University. He served as a Staff Sergeant in the Israel Defense Forces from 1979 to 1982. He is currently married with two children, and lives in Ra&#x27;anana, Israel. He is a member of the Masorti congregation in Ramot, Jerusalem.

==Political career==
Pines-Paz was first elected to the Knesset in 1996. He retained his seat in the 1999 elections, and served as chairman of the parliamentary ruling coalition and as the chairman of the One Israel faction between 1999 and 2001. From 2001 to 2003 he served as the General Secretary of Labor Party.

He was re-elected again in 2003, and in 2005 was appointed Internal Affairs Minister, serving in the cabinet until Labor pulled out of the government. After being re-elected in 2006 he was appointed Minister of Science, Culture, and Sport in Ehud Olmert&#x27;s government. However, he resigned from the cabinet in November 2006 in protest against the nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu being added to the coalition; and was the only Labor Party minister to vote against the party coming into the government, stating in an interview:

:&quot;The moment the government decided to allow the inclusion of Lieberman and his party, whose leaders are infected with racist and anti-democratic statements, I am left with no other choice.&quot;

In the Labor leadership election in 2007 he came fourth in the first round, switching his support to eventual winner Ehud Barak in the second round. He came second in the party&#x27;s primary elections prior to the 2009 Knesset elections, and took third place on the party list.

In January 2010 Pines-Paz announced he was retiring from politics and leaving the Labor Party, which he said &quot;had abandoned its values over the past 15 years&quot;. His seat was taken by Einat Wilf.

He is a former chairman of the Authority for Rehabilitation of Prisoners. He also served as deputy director-general of the Immigration and Absorption Department of the Jewish Agency for Israel.

==Awards and recognition==
In 2006 he received the &quot;Ometz&quot; award given by &quot;Citizens for Good Governance and Social Justice&quot;. Previously he had been awarded the 1997 &quot;Amitai&quot; prize for honest management and integrity.

Compiled primarily by keyboardist Ian McLagan, it served to supersede the 1976 effort &quot;Snakes And Ladders / The Best of Faces&quot;, and to present a CD-length retrospective of the group, lasting nearly eighty minutes (although a UK-only double LP retrospective, &quot;Best of Faces&quot;, had already gone some way toward achieving those goals already as early as 1977, &quot;Good Boys&quot; was the first Faces compilation to benefit from the active involvement of a group member).

Rod Stewart performs lead vocals on fifteen of nineteen tracks, the set presents three tracks sung by Ronnie Lane, and the singing debut of Ronnie Wood on &quot;Ooh La La.&quot; Included for the first time is one track from the Faces&#x27; final session, &quot;Open to Ideas.&quot;

With the exception of a cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;The Wicked Messenger,&quot; all of these tracks appear, alongside many others, on the comprehensive 2004 four-disc box set by the group (again curated by keyboardist Ian Mclagan) titled &quot;Five Guys Walk into a Bar...&quot;.

<text>An emerging market (or an emerging country or an emerging economy) is a market that has some characteristics of a developed market, but does not fully meet its standards. This includes markets that may become developed markets in the future or were in the past. The term &quot;frontier market&quot; is used for developing countries with smaller, riskier, or more illiquid capital markets than &quot;emerging&quot;. As of 2006, the economies of China and India are considered to be the largest emerging markets. According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, many people find the term outdated, but no new term has gained traction. Emerging market hedge fund capital reached a record new level in the first quarter of 2011 of $121 billion. Emerging market economies’ share of global PPP-adjusted GDP has risen from 27 percent in 1960 to around 53 percent by 2013. The ten largest emerging economies by nominal GDP are 4 of the 9 BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) along with Mexico, South Korea, Indonesia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Poland. The inclusion of South Korea, Poland, and sometimes Taiwan are questionable given they are no longer considered emerging markets by the IMF and World Bank (for Korea and Taiwan.) If we ignore those three, the top ten would include Argentina and Thailand.

When countries &quot;graduate&quot; from their emerging status, they are referred to as emerged markets, emerged economies or emerged countries, where countries have developed from emerging economy status, but have yet to reach the technological and economic development of developed countries.

==Terminology==

In the 1970s, &quot;less developed countries&quot; (LDCs) was the common term for markets that were less &quot;developed&quot; (by objective or subjective measures) than the developed countries such as the United States, Japan, and those in Western Europe. These markets were supposed to provide greater potential for profit but also more risk from various factors like patent infringement. This term was replaced by &quot;emerging market&quot;. The term is misleading in that there is no guarantee that a country will move from &quot;less developed&quot; to &quot;more developed&quot;; although that is the general trend in the world, countries can also move from &quot;more developed&quot; to &quot;less developed&quot;.

Originally coined in 1981 by then World Bank economist Antoine Van Agtmael, the term is sometimes loosely used as a replacement for &quot;emerging economies&quot;, but really signifies a business phenomenon that is not fully described or constrained by such; these countries are considered to be in a transitional phase between developing and developed status. Examples of emerging markets include many countries in Africa, most countries in Eastern Europe, some countries of Latin America, some countries in the Middle East, Russia and some countries in Southeast Asia. Emphasizing the fluid nature of the category, political scientist Ian Bremmer defines an emerging market as &quot;a country where politics matters at least as much as economics to the markets&quot;.

The research on emerging markets is diffused within management literature. While researchers such as George Haley, Vladimir Kvint, Hernando de Soto, Usha Haley, and several professors from Harvard Business School and Yale School of Management have described activity in countries such as India and China, how a market emerges is now well understood and can easily be modeled.

In 2009, Dr. Kvint published this definition: &quot;an emerging market country is a society transitioning from a dictatorship to a free-market-oriented-economy, with increasing economic freedom, gradual integration with the Global Marketplace and with other members of the GEM (Global Emerging Market), an expanding middle class, improving standards of living, social stability and tolerance, as well as an increase in cooperation with multilateral institutions&quot;
In 2008 Emerging Economy Report, the Center for Knowledge Societies defines &quot;emerging economies&quot; as those &quot;regions of the world that are experiencing rapid informationalization under conditions of limited or partial industrialization&quot;. It appears that emerging markets lie at the intersection of non-traditional user behavior, the rise of new user groups and community adoption of products and services, and innovations in product technologies and platforms.

More critical scholars have also studied key emerging markets like Mexico and Turkey. Thomas Marois (2012, 2) argues that financial imperatives have become much more significant and has developed the idea of &#x27;emerging finance capitalism&#x27; – an era wherein the collective interests of financial capital principally shape the logical options and choices of government and state elites over and above those of labor and popular classes.

Julien Vercueil recently proposed an pragmatic definition of the &quot;emerging economies&quot;, as distinguished from &quot;emerging markets&quot; coined by an approach heavily influenced by financial criteria. According to his definition, an emerging economy displays the following characteristics:

# Intermediate income: its PPP per capita income is comprised between 10% and 75% of the average EU per capita income.
# Catching-up growth: during at least the last decade, it has experienced a brisk economic growth that has narrowed the income gap with advanced economies.
# Institutional transformations and economic opening: during the same period, it has undertaken profound institutional transformations which contributed to integrate it more deeply into the world economy. Hence, emerging economies appears to be a by-product of the current globalization.

At the beginning of the 2010s, more than 50 countries, representing 60% of the world&#x27;s population and 45% of its GDP, matched these criteria. Among them, the BRICs.
The term &quot;rapidly developing economies&quot; is being used to denote emerging markets such as The United Arab Emirates, Chile and Malaysia that are undergoing rapid growth.

In recent years, new terms have emerged to describe the largest developing countries such as BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China), along with &quot;BRICET&quot; (BRIC + Eastern Europe and Turkey), &quot;BRICS&quot; (BRIC + South Africa), &quot;BRICM&quot; (BRIC + Mexico), MINT (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey), Next Eleven (Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Korea, Turkey, and Vietnam) and CIVETS (Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey and South Africa). These countries do not share any common agenda, but some experts believe that they are enjoying an increasing role in the world economy and on political platforms.

Lists of emerging (or developed) markets vary; guides may be found in such investment information sources as &quot;EMIS&quot; (a Euromoney Institutional Investor Company), &quot;The Economist&quot;, or market index makers (such as MSCI).

In an Opalesque.TV video, hedge fund manager Jonathan Binder discusses the current and future relevance of the term &quot;emerging markets&quot; in the financial world. Binder says that in the future investors will not necessarily think of the traditional classifications of &quot;G10&quot; (or G7) versus &quot;emerging markets&quot;. Instead, people should look at the world as countries that are fiscally responsible and countries that are not. Whether that country is in Europe or in South America should make no difference, making the traditional &quot;blocs&quot; of categorization irrelevant. Guégan &quot;et al.&quot; (2014) also discuss the relevance of the terminology &quot;emerging country&quot; comparing the credit worthiness of so-called emerging countries to so-called developed countries. According to their analysis, depending on the criteria used, the term may not always be appropriate.

The 10 &quot;Big Emerging Markets&quot; (BEM) economies are (alphabetically ordered): Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Poland, South Africa, South Korea and Turkey. Egypt, Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, and Thailand are other major emerging markets.

Newly industrialized countries are emerging markets whose economies have not yet reached developed status but have, in a macroeconomic sense, outpaced their developing counterparts.

Individual investors can invest in emerging markets by buying into emerging markets or global funds. If they want to pick single stocks or make their own bets they can do it either through ADRs (American depositor Receipts – stocks of foreign companies that trade on US stock exchanges) or through exchange traded funds (exchange traded funds or ETFs hold basket of stocks). The exchange traded funds can be focused on a particular country (e.g., China, India) or region (e.g., Asia-Pacific, Latin America).

== FTSE International Emerging Markets Index ==

The FTSE International Emerging Markets Index calculates how emerging a company is, and have helped many companies that are on low status emerge. They have been reported by many countries, including China, India, and Brazil.

== Emerged market ==
Also referred to as &quot;emerged economy&quot; or &quot;emerged country&quot;.

Emerging markets share the economic characteristics such as low income, high growth economies that use market liberalization as their main means of growth. Of course, emerging economies can develop out of such emerging status, entering the post-emerging stage. When emerging markets are promoted from their economic status, they are referred to as emerged markets. Countries like Israel, Poland, South Korea, Taiwan, the Czech Republic, and city-states such as Singapore have transitioned from emerging to &quot;emerged&quot;. These emerged markets tend to be characterized by higher incomes and relatively stable political schemes, compared to those categorized as emerging markets.

== Commonly listed ==
Various sources list countries as &quot;emerging economies&quot; as indicated by the table below.

A few countries appear in every list (BRICS, Mexico, Turkey, South Africa). Indonesia and Turkey are categorized with Mexico and Nigeria as part of the MINT economies. While there are no commonly agreed upon parameters on which the countries can be classified as &quot;Emerging Economies&quot;, several firms have developed detailed methodologies to identify the top performing emerging economies every year. While often treated as one group, emerging market economies are diverse in their factor endowments as well as real, financial, and external linkages.

==BBVA Research==
In November 2010, BBVA Research introduced a new economic concept, to identify key emerging markets.
This classification is divided into two sets of developing economies.

As of 2014, the groupings are as follows:

EAGLEs (emerging and growth-leading economies): Expected Incremental GDP in the next 10 years to be larger than the average of the G7 economies, excluding the US.
* 
* 
* 
* 


NEST: Expected Incremental GDP in the next decade to be lower than the average of the G6 economies (G7 excluding the US) but higher than Italy&#x27;s.

==Emerging Market Bond Index Global==
The Emerging Market Bond Index Global (EMBI Global) by J.P. Morgan was the first comprehensive EM sovereign index in the market, after the EMBI+. It provides full coverage of the EM asset class with representative countries, investable instruments (sovereign and quasi-sovereign), and transparent rules.
The EMBI Global includes only USD-denominated emerging markets sovereign bonds and uses a traditional, market capitalization weighted method for country allocation. As of March end 2016, the EMBI Global&#x27;s market capitalization was $692.3bn.

For country inclusion, a country&#x27;s GNI per capita must be below the Index Income Ceiling (IIC) for three consecutive years to be eligible for inclusion to the EMBI Global. J.P. Morgan defines the Index Income Ceiling (IIC) as the GNI per capita level that is adjusted every year by the growth rate of the World GNI per capita, Atlas method (current US$), provided by the World Bank annually. An existing country may be considered for removal from the index if its GNI per capita is above the Index Income Ceiling (IIC) for three consecutive years as well as the country&#x27;s long term foreign currency sovereign credit rating (the available ratings from all three agencies: S&amp;P, Moody&#x27;s &amp; Fitch) is A-/A3/A- (inclusive) or above for three consecutive years.

J.P. Morgan has introduced what is called an &quot;Index Income Ceiling&quot; (IIC), defined as the income level that is adjusted every year by the growth rate of the World GNI per capita, provided by the World Bank as &quot;GNI per capita, Atlas method (current US$) annually&quot;. Once a country has GNI per capita below or above the IIC level for three consecutive years, the country eligibility will be determined.
* J.P. Morgan has established the base IIC level in 1987 to match the World Bank High Income threshold at US$6,000 GNI per capita.
* Every year, growth in the World GNI per capita figure is applied to the IIC, establishing a new IIC that is dynamic over time.
* This approach ensures that J.P. Morgan&#x27;s cutoff for index removal is adjusted by the World income growth rate, and not by the inflation rate of a smaller sample of Developed economies.
* This metric essentially incorporates real global growth, global inflation, and currency exchange rate (current USD-denominated) changes.
* Essentially, the introduction of the IIC establishes a higher, more appropriate threshold for country eligibility in the EMBI Global/Diversified.

==Emerging Markets Index==
The Emerging Markets Index by MasterCard is a list of the top 65 cities in emerging markets. The following countries had cities featured on the list:

==Emerging Market Multinationals Report==
Launched in 2016 by Lourdes Casanova, Anne Miroux, at Emerging Markets Institute, at the Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management, Cornell University, the Emerging Market Multinationals Report analyzes the economic performance of the emerging economies and emerging market multinationals (EMNCs), exploring among others the foreign investment, revenues, valuation and other business data of these firms with the help of the EMI research team. The second part of the report includes chapters by EmNet at the OECD Development Centre, International Finance Corporation at the World Bank Group, the business school at the University of the Andes (Colombia), and other universities of the Emerging Multinationals Research Network and beyond. 

The report launched the emerging economies &quot;E20+1&quot; grouping, that includes the top 20 emerging economies plus China. These economies are selected based on nominal gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, share in global trade and poverty levels.

In the 2020 report, EMI published the different milestones of the E20 countries. In 2021, launched the EMI Ranking of the 500 largest companies by revenue (EMNC 500R), the 500 largest by market capitalization (500MC), and the 200 best ESG performer companies (200ESG). In 2022, the report released D-ESG ranking of the E20+1. The D-ESG ranking assesses countries based on their economic growth (D) and ESG performances.

==Global Growth Generators==
&quot;Global Growth Generators&quot;, or 3G (countries), is an alternative classification determined by Citigroup analysts as being countries with the most promising growth prospects for 2010–2050. These consist of Indonesia, Egypt, seven other emerging countries, and two countries not previously listed before, specifically Iraq and Mongolia. There has been disagreement about the reclassification of these countries, among others, for the purpose of acronym creation as was seen with the BRICS.

== Estimating Demand in Emerging Markets ==
Estimating the demand for products or services in emerging markets and developing economies can be complex and challenging for managers. These countries have unique commercial environments and may be limited in terms of reliable data, market research firms, and trained interviewers. Consumers in some of these countries may consider surveys an invasion of privacy. Survey respondents may try to please researchers by telling them what they want to hear rather than providing honest answers to their questions. However some companies have dedicated their entire business units for understanding the dynamics of emerging markets owing to their peculiarity.

==Economy==
The following table lists the GDP (PPP) projections of the 30 largest emerging economies for the year of 2024 (unless otherwise stated). Members of the G-20 major economies are in bold.

<text>Peter Michael Whittingham (; 8 September 1984 – 18 March 2020) was an English professional footballer. His primary position was as a central midfielder, although he also sometimes operated as a wide midfielder on both the left and right.

He was part of the Aston Villa team that won the 2001–02 FA Youth Cup, and a year later he made his Premier League debut. Whittingham had loans at Championship clubs Burnley and Derby County in 2005. In January 2007, he signed for Cardiff City for a fee of £350,000.

In eleven seasons at Cardiff, Whittingham played 457 competitive matches and scored 96 goals, putting him seventh on the all-time appearances list and ninth among their goalscorers. During his time at that club they won the Championship in 2013, and reached the 2008 FA Cup final and 2012 League Cup final. He was named three times in the Championship&#x27;s PFA Team of the Year, and his 20-goal haul in the 2009–10 season made him the division&#x27;s top scorer. He signed for Blackburn Rovers in June 2017, and made 24 appearances for the club before his contract was terminated by mutual consent in August 2018. He died in March 2020, as a result of an accidental fall at a pub.

==Early life==
Whittingham was born in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, and attended King Henry VIII School, Coventry. His father Harry was a well-known fishmonger in the area and was known as &quot;Harry the Fish&quot;. His mother worked as a teacher. He has an older brother named James who works as an investment banker for Goldman Sachs.

==Club career==
===Coventry City===
Whittingham began playing football as a youth player with his local side Coventry City, joining the club at the age of seven. His brother had been playing in the club&#x27;s youth sides and Whittingham had been noticed playing on the side of pitch by one of the club&#x27;s scouts. Whittingham played with Coventry until the age of 16 but was released in 2001 after the club opted against offering him a contract with officials believing he was too small to play professionally. Coventry scout Ray Gooding, who had argued against his release, instead rang officials at Aston Villa to recommend Whittingham. After a successful trial, he signed for the Midlands club.

===Aston Villa===
Whittingham signed with Aston Villa in April 2001 and was part of the club&#x27;s FA Youth Cup-winning team of 2002. He was handed his first team debut on 21 April 2003 by manager Graham Taylor against Newcastle United, as a half-time substitution for Gareth Barry in a 1–1 away draw. He made two further substitute appearances before making his first start in the final day of the season in a 3–1 defeat against Leeds United.

Taylor was replaced by David O&#x27;Leary ahead of the 2003–04 season, with the Irishman being quick to praise Whittingham&#x27;s potential. After featuring regularly during the early stages of the campaign, he scored his first senior goal against Wycombe Wanderers in the League Cup third round on 23 September 2003, during a 5–0 win at Adams Park. After the match, O&#x27;Leary commented &quot;I&#x27;ve had a good feeling about Peter&quot;. In November that year, having been nearly ever-present during the opening stages of the campaign, he signed a contract that would have lasted until 2007. He finished the season having made 39 appearances in all competitions as a left-sided midfielder, including playing six times in the club&#x27;s League Cup run where they reached the semi-final before losing to Bolton Wanderers, a match in which Whittingham was later branded a &quot;scapegoat&quot; for his side&#x27;s defeat. Nevertheless, he was named Villa&#x27;s young player of the season for the campaign.

The following season, Whittingham began the campaign as a regular substitute and scored his only league goal for Villa on 6 November 2004, opening a 3–0 win over Portsmouth at Villa Park. However, he gradually fell out of favour as the side struggled and, on 14 February 2005, Whittingham signed for Championship club Burnley on a one-month loan having not featured for Villa for nearly two months. Having featured predominantly as a left-sided player during the early stages of his career, Burnley manager Steve Cotterill hoped Whittingham would make an impact as a central midfielder at the club, and hoped that he would do as well as Gary Cahill, another young player they had taken on loan from Villa. Whittingham made his debut for Burnley in a 1–1 draw with Crewe Alexandra the following day. Whittingham started all nine matches of his loan spell, seven in the league and two in the FA Cup, before returning to Villa in late-March, despite Cotterill&#x27;s hopes of extending the deal.

Whittingham started three of Villa&#x27;s opening four matches of the 2005–06 season, but returned to the Championship on 15 September, joining Derby County on a three-month loan. He made his debut for Derby three days later in a 2–2 draw with Southampton, making a total of 11 appearances without scoring before returning to Villa in November 2005.

===Cardiff City===
On 11 January 2007, after making just five appearances for Villa since the end of his loan spell with Derby more than a year previously, Whittingham was transferred to Cardiff City for a reported fee of £350,000. He quickly established himself in the team and was a first-team member until the end of the year, despite competition from Joe Ledley on the left-hand side.

Whittingham began the 2007–08 season on the bench. By mid-November Cardiff found themselves just above the relegation zone; this prompted a minor reshuffle from boss Dave Jones that involved Chris Gunter and Whittingham returning to the starting line-up. Whittingham&#x27;s recall saw him moved to an unfamiliar role on the right side of midfield, but he soon settled into the role and started the majority of the remaining matches of the season, as well as being the team&#x27;s top scorer (with three goals) during their FA Cup run. That run saw him score in matches against Chasetown, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Middlesbrough, before Cardiff eventually lost 1–0 to Portsmouth in the final.

The start of the 2008–09 season saw Whittingham continue playing on the right side of midfield, scoring his first goal of the season on 26 August in a 2–1 victory over Milton Keynes Dons in the League Cup. He ruptured ankle ligaments during a 2–1 win over Crystal Palace on 15 November, which was expected to keep him out for up to three months. However, he returned to the team ahead of schedule, coming on as a late substitute during a 1–1 draw with Reading on 26 December.

In the first match of the 2009–10 season, Whittingham converted a penalty during a 4–0 win over Scunthorpe United in the first ever competitive match at the Cardiff City Stadium and scored in consecutive rounds of the League Cup in wins over Dagenham &amp; Redbridge and Bristol Rovers. Having been appointed the first-choice penalty taker for the club, he took his league goal tally to three with goals in consecutive matches in a 3–1 defeat to against Sheffield Wednesday followed by a 6–1 win over Derby County. He continued his scoring form with a brace against Watford and goals against Crystal Palace and Coventry City followed by a hat-trick against Sheffield United. Whittingham earned the October Player of the Month award on 14 November 2009. On 24 April, he scored a free-kick during a 3–2 win over Sheffield Wednesday, and the following day was named in the 2009–10 PFA Team of the Year for the Championship.

Following the loan arrival of Craig Bellamy, Whittingham started the 2010–11 season in a new central midfield role. His performances were praised by manager Dave Jones. After scoring eight penalties in the previous campaign, Whittingham saw his first two penalties saved in this campaign, causing Jones to announce that Whittingham had been taken off penalty duty. However, he did take and score Cardiff&#x27;s next penalty against Coventry City in a 2–1 win which added to his first two goals of the season scored from a brace of free kicks scored against Bristol City three days previously. Whittingham scored a fantastic volley against Barnsley on 13 March, which ended up being voted Football League Goal of the Year award for 2011. At the end of the season, Cardiff failed to gain promotion for a second year running and Whittingham was heavily linked with a move away from Cardiff City Stadium, being linked with newly promoted Norwich City and Portsmouth.

Despite the links with a move away from the Welsh capital, new Cardiff boss, Malky Mackay insisted that Whittingham was central to his plans. Whittingham started the first match against West Ham United, and scored his first goal of the season against Oxford United after coming on for Solomon Taiwo. Whittingham made his 300th league appearance in a 1–1 draw with Burnley. On 26 August, Whittingham signed a contract extension to keep him at the club until at least the summer of 2014. Whittingham played a big role in Cardiff&#x27;s centre midfield, producing many impressive performances and scoring several fine goals, including direct freekicks against Peterborough and Crystal Palace as well as a sublime chip from 35 yards away to Reading. His 50th league goal for Cardiff came on 22 November against Coventry City. His four goals in five matches led to Whittingham being nominated for the November Championship Player of the Month.

On 30 December 2011, Mackay revealed that the club had rejected a bid, thought to be around £3 million, from West Ham United for Whittingham. Following a goal scoring drought, Whittingham scored a penalty against Leicester in February and then scored straight from a corner against Peterborough. In February, Whittingham was nominated for the Championship Player of the Year award. Whittingham was part of all the matches in the League Cup campaign, which eventually saw Cardiff lose 3–2 on penalties to Liverpool in the final at Wembley Stadium. He made his 250th Cardiff appearance in a 2–2 draw with Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, in which he scored on 7 March. Whittingham was voted the best player outside the Premier League in &quot;FourFourTwo&quot; magazine. Whittingham then won his second Cardiff City player of the year award at the end of the season. He was later named in the PFA Team of the Year for the Championship.

During the close season, more speculation about Whittingham&#x27;s future in the Welsh capital arose, this time from Premier League club West Bromwich Albion. Whittingham said that he was fully committed to Cardiff, stating: &quot;I&#x27;m happy here and until the gaffer [Malky Mackay] wants to sell me I&#x27;m here.&quot; On 28 August 2012, Whittingham signed a new 3-year deal at Cardiff, ending speculation on his future. Whittingham opened his scoring account for the 2012–13 season, on 2 September with a hat-trick in a 3–1 home win over Wolverhampton Wanderers. He then scored his fourth during the following match, converting a penalty against Leeds United, his 350th career appearance. After a drop in form, Whittingham was left out of the team towards the close of the season, but managed his eighth and final goal of the campaign with a last-minute penalty at home to Blackburn Rovers on 1 April. Whittingham collected a winner&#x27;s medal as Cardiff lifted the Championship trophy following April&#x27;s home encounter with Bolton Wanderers.

Cardiff&#x27;s debut Premier League season started off brightly with wins over champions Manchester City and Fulham. Whittingham scored his first Premier League goal in nine years against Hull City. Despite the bright start, Cardiff were eventually relegated after just one season.

In July 2014, Whittingham signed a new three-year deal keeping him till in the Welsh capital until 2017. Despite a disappointing campaign for the Bluebirds, who finished in 11th, their lowest finish in 8 years, Whittingham was selected in The Football Manager Team of the Decade at the Football League Awards, on 19 April.

Cardiff rejected two bids from unnamed clubs for Whittingham in the summer of 2015 and he was described as the club&#x27;s kingpin, by manager Russell Slade. Whittingham scored twice in a 4–1 win over Brighton &amp; Hove Albion and overtook John Toshack and Hughie Ferguson in the club&#x27;s all-time leading scorers list in English league competitions. Cardiff missed out on the play-offs at the end of the season.

Whittingham played less frequently for Cardiff after Neil Warnock was appointed manager in October 2016. As it was expected that his contract would expire at the end of the season, he received a standing ovation when substituted in his final home match, against Newcastle in 2017.

In July 2022, two years after Whittingham&#x27;s death, Cardiff retired the number 7 shirt as a tribute.

===Blackburn Rovers===
On 13 June 2017, Whittingham joined newly relegated League One club Blackburn Rovers on a two-year contract effective from the expiration of his Cardiff contract in July. Warnock praised him for his loyalty to the club, and had offered Whittingham a one-year contract extension but made it clear that he would feature less often than he had done before.

He made his Rovers debut on 6 August, playing the full 90 minutes as they began the season with a 2–1 loss at Southend United.

Whittingham had his contract with Blackburn terminated by mutual consent on 31 August 2018.

==International career==
Whittingham was an England under-21 international, making his debut against the Netherlands in 2004 and was part of the squad that competed in the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Championship held in the Netherlands. He made one substitute appearance during the tournament, coming on late in a 2–2 draw with Italy.

Whittingham scored three goals for the under-21 team. He scored his first two in a match against Wales before scoring his last goal in a match against Norway in February 2006.

==Personal life==
At the time of his death, he lived in Dinas Powys, Vale of Glamorgan with his wife Amanda and their son; their second son was born two months after his death.

==Death==
On 18 March 2020, South Wales Police confirmed that Whittingham was in hospital after suffering head injuries as a result of an accidental fall at a pub in Barry on 7 March. He died from his injuries on 18 March at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, aged 35.

In March 2021, Pontypridd Coroner&#x27;s Court recorded a verdict of accidental death, concluding that Whittingham was intoxicated and engaged in &quot;horseplay&quot; with friends before falling through a fire door and down a flight of stairs.

=== Legacy ===
In the immediate aftermath of Whittingham&#x27;s death tributes were paid across the football world, including Whittingham&#x27;s former clubs Aston Villa, Cardiff City and Blackburn Rovers along with players such as Elliott Bennett and Mark Bright. The English Football League, The Football Association of England and the Football Association of Wales also issued messages of condolence.

In 2021, Whittingham&#x27;s wife Amanda, brother James, sister Rachel and mother Sally founded a Registered Charity in his honour, named The PW7 Foundation. The Foundation raised money for three causes; The Cardiff City FC Foundation, which aimed to support children in Cardiff through football, a sports bursary at King Henry VIII School in Coventry (Peter&#x27;s old school) and Winston&#x27;s Wish, a charity that supports children who have lost a parent or sibling.

A tribute friendly was organised between Cardiff City and Aston Villa, which took place on 30 November 2022, during the break in both teams&#x27; respective leagues due to the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The ticket sales for that match at the Cardiff City Stadium raised money for the PW7 Foundation.

Cardiff City also retired the number 7 shirt in his honour.

<text>Kulkarni is a surname common amongst Marathi Brahmins. The name “Kulkarni” is native to the Indian state of Maharashtra and parts of Karnataka. “Kulkarni” is a combination of two words (&quot;kula&quot; and &quot;karni&quot;). &quot;Kula&quot; means &quot;family&quot;, and &quot;Karanika&quot; means &quot;archivist&quot;. Historically, Kulkarni was the title given to the village record keeper.

As per the historian P.J. Marshall, Kulkarni were specialized scribes who &quot;served great households and enhanced other, familiar, administrative mechanisms at their disposal&quot;.

== History ==
Before British rule, the Maharashtra region was divided into many revenue divisions. The medieval equivalent of a county or district was the pargana. The chief of the pargana was called Deshmukh and record keepers were called Deshpande. The lowest administrative unit was the village. Village society in Marathi areas included the Patil or the head of the village, collector of revenue, and Kulkarni, the village record-keeper. These were hereditary positions. The Patil usually came from the Maratha caste. The Kulkarni was usually from literate communities such as Brahmin (mainly from Deshastha and the Karhade sub-castes) and CKP castes. The Kulkarni operated at the village level but at a pargana level, the recordkeeper had titles such as Deshkulkarni, Deshpande, or Nadkarni (in Karnataka). The Kulkarni watans (land rights) were abolished in 1950.

<doc id="1321415" wikidata="Q118931" url="?curid=1321415" title="99942 Apophis">
<text>99942 Apophis (provisional designation ) is a near-Earth asteroid and a potentially hazardous object, by in size, that caused a brief period of concern in December 2004 when initial observations indicated a probability of 2.7% that it would hit Earth on Friday, April 13, 2029. Additional observations provided improved predictions that eliminated the possibility of an impact on Earth in 2029. A small possibility nevertheless remained that, during its 2029 close encounter with Earth, Apophis would pass through a gravitational keyhole estimated to be 800 metres in diameter, which would have set up a future impact exactly seven years later on Easter Sunday, April 13, 2036. This possibility kept it at Level 1 on the Torino impact hazard scale until August 2006, when the probability that Apophis would pass through the keyhole was determined to be very small and Apophis&#x27;s rating on the Torino scale was lowered to zero. By 2008, the keyhole had been determined to be less than 1 km wide. During the short time when it had been of greatest concern, Apophis set the record for highest rating ever on the Torino scale, reaching level 4 on December 27, 2004.

The discovery of Apophis in 2004 is rather surprising because it is estimated that an asteroid as big or bigger coming so close to Earth happens only once in 800 years on average. Such an asteroid is expected to actually hit Earth once in about 80,000 years.

Preliminary observations by Goldstone radar in January 2013 effectively ruled out the possibility of an Earth impact by Apophis in 2036 (probability less than 1 in a million). In February 2013 the estimated probability of an impact in 2036 was reduced to . It is now known that in 2036, Apophis will approach the Earth at a third the distance of the Sun in both March and December,this is about the distance of the planet Venus when it overtakes Earth every 1.6 years. Simulations in 2013 showed that the Yarkovsky effect might cause Apophis to hit a &quot;keyhole&quot; in 2029 so that it will come close to Earth in 2051, and then could hit another keyhole and hit Earth in 2068. But the chance of the Yarkovsky effect having exactly the right value for this was estimated as 2 in a million. Radar observations in March 2021 helped to refine the orbit, and in March 2021 the Jet Propulsion Laboratory announced that Apophis has no chance of impacting Earth in the next 100 years. The uncertainty in the 2029 approach distance has been reduced from hundreds of kilometres to now just a couple of kilometres, greatly enhancing predictions of future approaches. Entering March 2021, six asteroids each had a more notable cumulative Palermo scale rating than Apophis, and none of those has a Torino level above 0. However, Apophis will continue to be a threat possibly for thousands of years until it is removed from being a potentially hazardous object, for instance by passing close to Venus or Mars.

== Discovery and naming ==

Apophis was discovered on June 19, 2004, by Roy A. Tucker, David J. Tholen, and Fabrizio Bernardi at the Kitt Peak National Observatory. On December 21, 2004, Apophis passed from Earth. Precovery observations from March 15, 2004, were identified on December 27, and an improved orbit solution was computed. Radar astrometry in January 2005 further refined its orbit solution. The discovery was notable in that it was at a very low solar elongation (56°) and at very long range (1.1 AU).

When first discovered, the object received the provisional designation , and early news and scientific articles naturally referred to it by that name. Once its orbit was sufficiently well calculated, it received the permanent number 99942 (on June 24, 2005). Receiving a permanent number made it eligible for naming by its discoverers, and they chose the name &quot;Apophis&quot; on July 19, 2005. Apophis is the Greek name of Apep, an enemy of the Ancient Egyptian sun-god Ra. He is the Uncreator, an evil serpent that dwells in the eternal darkness of the Duat and tries to swallow Ra during his nightly passage. Apep is held at bay by Set, the Ancient Egyptian god of storms and the desert.

Tholen and Tucker, two of the co-discoverers of the asteroid, are reportedly fans of the television series &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;. One of the show&#x27;s persistent villains is an alien named Apophis. He is one of the principal threats to the existence of civilization on Earth through the first few seasons, thus likely why the asteroid was named after him. In the fictional world of the show, the alien&#x27;s backstory was that he had lived on Earth during ancient times and had posed as a god, thereby giving rise to the myth of the Egyptian god of the same name.
The mythological creature Apophis is pronounced with the accent on the first syllable (/ˈæpəfɪs/). In contrast, the asteroid&#x27;s name is generally accented on the second syllable (, or as the name was pronounced in the TV series).

Symbols were given to the first few asteroids in the 19th century, though this practice faded when it became clear that there were a great number of them, and such symbols are now extremely rarely used by astronomers. In 2008, Denis Moskowitz, a software engineer who devised most of the dwarf planet symbols in Unicode, proposed a symbol for Apophis. His symbol is based on ancient Egyptian depictions of Apep. The added star is similar to many of the 19th-century asteroid symbols.

== Physical characteristics and rotation ==

Based on the observed brightness, Apophis&#x27;s diameter was initially estimated at ; a more refined estimate based on spectroscopic observations at NASA&#x27;s Infrared Telescope Facility in Hawaii by Binzel, Rivkin, Bus, and Tokunaga (2005) is . As of 2013, NASA&#x27;s impact risk page listed the diameter at , and an assumed mass of 4 kg. The mass estimate is more approximate than the diameter estimate, but should be accurate to within a factor of three. Apophis&#x27;s surface composition probably matches that of LL chondrites.

Based on Goldstone and Arecibo radar images taken in 2012–2013, Brozović et al. have estimated that Apophis is an elongated object 450 × 170 metres in size, and that it is bilobed (possibly a contact binary) with a relatively bright surface albedo of . The axis of its angular momentum points 59° south of the ecliptic, which means that Apophis is a retrograde rotator. Apophis is a tumbler, which means that it does not rotate around a fixed axis. Rather, the axis of rotation moves in the frame of reference of the asteroid with a period of around 263 hours (called the rotation period). The angle between it and the principal axis of highest moment of inertia varies, as does the angle between that principal axis and the vector of angular momentum (from around 12° to around 55° twice every period). During this period, the angle between the long axis of Apophis and the angular momentum vector swings between around 78° and 102° (90°±12°). But the principal axis of highest moment and the rotation axis both move around the constant axis of angular momentum much faster, with a time-averaged period of 27.38 hours (this is called precession). The result is that Apophis appears to be flipping, making a revolution on average every 30.56 hours. Every 263 hours, the principal axis with highest moment goes around 263/27.28 times (ca 9.6), whereas the long axis goes around 263/30.56 times (ca 8.6).

== Orbit ==

Apophis has a low inclination orbit (3.3°) that varies from just outside the orbit of Venus (0.746 AU, as compared to the aphelion of Venus, 0.728) to just outside the orbit of Earth (1.099 AU). Although its orbit changes slightly each time it comes close to the earth, at present it comes near Earth once in 7.75 years on average (four times between April 14, 1998, and April 13, 2029). Because of its eccentric orbit, these moments are not evenly spaced and tend to occur between December and April (when Apophis is in the outer portions of its orbit). In fact, the eccentricity and semi-major axis are such that (before 2029) Apophis is always receding from Earth around May 1 and is always approaching around December 2. At the ascending node (where Apophis crosses the plane of the earth&#x27;s orbit from south to north) Apophis is very close to where Earth is around April 13 of any year, and this is what gives rise to close encounters such as the one on April 13, 2029. The orbit also passes south of where the earth is in mid December, producing for example the close approaches of December 16, 1889, and December 18, 1939. After the 2029 Earth approach, the orbit will change dramatically. The period will change from around of a year to a bit under . It will still come very close to Earth&#x27;s yearly April 13 location. It will no longer pass close to Earth&#x27;s yearly mid-December location, but will now pass close to Earth&#x27;s mid-September location. This will cause a close encounter on September 11, 2102, after which the uncertainty in the location of Apophis will increase rapidly with time.

=== 2029 close approach ===
The closest known approach of Apophis will occur on April 13, 2029, at 21:46 UT, when Apophis will pass Earth at a distance of about above the surface. Using the June 2021 orbit solution which includes the Yarkovsky effect, the 3-sigma uncertainty region in the 2029 approach distance is about ±3.4 km. The distance, a hair&#x27;s breadth in astronomical terms, is five times the radius of the Earth, one tenth the distance to the Moon, and closer than the ring of geostationary satellites currently orbiting the Earth. It will be the closest asteroid of its size in recorded history. On that date, it will become as bright as magnitude 3.1 (visible to the naked eye from rural as well as darker suburban areas, visible with binoculars from most locations). The close approach will be visible from Europe, Africa, and western Asia. Over the course of about a day, Apophis will move northwest from Centaurus to Perseus and then southwest to Pisces, an arc of 205°. During the approach, Earth will perturb Apophis from an Aten-class orbit with a semi-major axis of 0.92 AU to an Apollo-class orbit with a semi-major axis of 1.1 AU. Perihelion will lift from 0.746 AU to 0.895 AU and aphelion will lift from 1.10 AU to 1.31 AU.

During the 2029 approach, Apophis&#x27;s brightness will peak at magnitude 3.1, easily visible to the naked eye, with a maximum angular speed of 42° per hour. The maximum apparent angular diameter will be approximately 2 arcseconds. This is roughly equivalent to the angular diameter of Neptune from earth. Therefore, the asteroid will be barely resolved by ground-based telescopes not equipped with adaptive optics but very well resolved by those that are. Because the approach will be so close, tidal forces are likely to alter Apophis&#x27;s rotation axis, but Apophis will not approach within the Roche limit where it would be broken up by tidal forces. A partial resurfacing of the asteroid is possible, which might change its spectral class from a weathered Sq- to an unweathered Q-type.


=== 2036 approaches ===
In 2036, Apophis will pass the Earth at a third the distance of the Sun in both March and December. Using the 2024 orbit solution, the Earth approach on March 27, 2036, will be no closer than , but more likely about . For comparison, the planet Venus will be closer to Earth at on May 30, 2036. On December 31, 2036, Apophis will be a little bit further away than the March approach at about .

=== 2051 approach ===
Around April 19–20, 2051, Apophis will pass about from Earth and it will be the first time since 2029 that Apophis will pass within 10 million km of Earth.

=== 2066 and 2068 ===

Although early simulations showed that there was a chance Apophis could hit the earth on April 12, 2068, this was later excluded and JPL Horizons calculates that Apophis will be about from Earth, making the asteroid much farther than the Sun.

By 2116, the JPL Small-Body Database and NEODyS close approach data start to become divergent. In April 2116, Apophis is expected to pass about from Earth, but could pass as close as or as far as .

=== Refinement of close approach predictions ===
Six months after discovery, and shortly after a close approach to Earth on December 21, 2004, the improved orbital estimates led to the prediction of a very close approach on April 13, 2029, by both NASA&#x27;s automatic Sentry system and NEODyS, a similar automatic program run by the University of Pisa and the University of Valladolid. Subsequent observations decreased the uncertainty in Apophis&#x27;s trajectory and the probability of an impact event in 2029 temporarily climbed, peaking at 2.7% (1 in 37) on December 27, 2004, when the uncertainty region had shrunk to 83,000 km. This probability, combined with its size, caused Apophis to be assessed at level 4 on the Torino scale and 1.10 on the Palermo scale (corresponding to an impact hazard over 12 times the background level), scales scientists use to represent how dangerous a given asteroid is to Earth. These are the highest values at which any object has been rated on either scale. The chance that there would be an impact in 2029 was eliminated later in the day of December 27, 2004, as a result of a precovery image that extended the observation arc back to March 2004. The danger of a 2036 passage was lowered to level 0 on the Torino scale in August 2006. With a cumulative Palermo scale rating of −3.22, the risk of impact from Apophis is less than one thousandth the background hazard level.

In July 2005, former Apollo astronaut Rusty Schweickart, as chairman of the B612 Foundation, formally asked NASA to investigate the possibility that the asteroid&#x27;s post-2029 orbit could be in orbital resonance with Earth, which would increase the probability of future impacts. Schweickart also asked NASA to investigate whether a transponder should be placed on the asteroid to enable more accurate tracking of how its orbit is affected by the Yarkovsky effect.

==== 2011 observations ====
On January 31, 2011, astronomers took the first new images of Apophis in more than 3 years.

==== 2013 refinement ====
The close approach in 2029 will substantially alter the object&#x27;s orbit, prompting Jon Giorgini of JPL to say in 2011, &quot;If we get radar ranging in 2013 [the next good opportunity], we should be able to predict the location of out to at least 2070.&quot; Apophis passed within of Earth in 2013, allowing astronomers to refine the trajectory for future close passes. Just after the closest approach on January 9, 2013, the asteroid peaked at an apparent magnitude of about 15.6. The Goldstone radar observed Apophis during that approach from January 3 through January 17. The Arecibo Observatory observed Apophis once it entered Arecibo&#x27;s declination window after February 13, 2013. The 2013 observations basically ruled out any chance of a 2036 impact.

A NASA assessment as of February 21, 2013, that did not use the January and February 2013 radar measurements gave an impact probability of 2.3 in a million for 2068. As of May 6, 2013, using observations through April 15, 2013, the odds of an impact on April 12, 2068, as calculated by the JPL Sentry risk table had increased slightly to 3.9 in a million (1 in 256,000).

==== 2015 observations ====
As of January 2019, Apophis had not been observed since 2015, mostly because its orbit kept it very near the Sun from the perspective of Earth. It was not further than 60 degrees from the Sun between April 2014 and December 2019. With the early 2015 observations, the April 12, 2068, impact probability was 6.7 in a million (1 in 150,000), and the asteroid had a cumulative 9 in a million (1 in 110,000) chance of impacting Earth before 2106.

==== 2020–2021 observations ====
No observations of Apophis were made between January 2015 and February 2019 but observations began again in January 2020. In March 2020, astronomers David Tholen and Davide Farnocchia measured the acceleration of Apophis due to the Yarkovsky effect for the first time, significantly improving the prediction of its orbit past the 2029 flyby. Tholen and Farnocchia found that the Yarkovsky effect causes the semi-major axis to decrease by about 170 metres per year, causing an increase in ecliptic longitude that is quadratic in time. In late 2020 Apophis approached the Earth and passed from Earth on March 6, 2021, brightening to +15 mag at that time. Radar observations of Apophis were carried out at Goldstone in March 2021. The asteroid has been observed by NEOWISE (between December 2020 and April 2021) and by NEOSSat (in January 2021).

These observations showed that a number called ζ (basically how far behind Earth Apophis would pass if it were not deflected by the gravitational pull of Earth) in 2029 will be about 47,363 km, less than the earlier nominal value of 47,659 km by 296 km because of the Yarkovsky effect. This means that Apophis will not hit the earth in the coming century, in particular avoiding the keyhole 212.14 km below nominal that would have led to a collision in 2068.

Apophis was the target of an observing campaign by the International Asteroid Warning Network, resulting in the collection of light curves, spectra, and astrometry. The observations were used to practice and coordinate the response to an actual impact threat. Ignoring all earlier observations, the estimated probability of an impact in 2029 reached 16 percent before going down to zero.

On February 21, 2021, Apophis was removed from the Sentry Risk Table, as an impact in the next 100 years was finally ruled out.

Several occultations of bright stars (apparent magnitude 8–11) by Apophis occurred in March and April 2021. A total of five separate occultations were observed successfully, marking the first time that an asteroid as small as Apophis was observed using the occultation method (beating the previous record set in 2019 by asteroid 3200 Phaethon, which is more than ten times the size of Apophis). The first event, on March 7, was successfully observed from the United States by multiple observers. The next potential occultation, which occurred on March 11, was predicted to be visible from central Europe. This event was missed, mainly because of bad weather (two negative observations were recorded from Greece). On March 22, another occultation was observed only by a single observer from the United States, amateur astronomer Roger Venable. Larger-than-expected residuals in the March 7 data had caused the majority of observers to be deployed outside of the actual path for the March 22 occultation. This single detection then allowed the prediction of several more events that would have been unobservable otherwise, including an occultation on April 4, which was observed from New Mexico, again by Venable, alongside others. Two more occultations, observable on April 10 and 11 from Japan and New Mexico, respectively, were seen by several observers each.

On March 9, 2021, using radar observations from Goldstone taken on March 3–8 and three positive detections of the stellar occultation on March 7, 2021, Apophis became the asteroid with the most precisely measured Yarkovsky effect of all asteroids, at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 186.4, surpassing 101955 Bennu (SNR=181.6).

The 2021 apparition was the last opportunity to observe Apophis before its 2029 flyby.
=== History of impact estimates ===
== Possible impact effects ==
As of 2021, the Sentry Risk Table estimated that Apophis would impact Earth with kinetic energy equivalent to 1,200 MT or megatons of TNT. In comparison, the energy released by the eruption of Krakatoa was 200 MT, total global nuclear arsenal has an energy equivalent to 1,460 MT, and the Chicxulub impact and extinction event had an estimated energy of 100,000,000 MT (100 teratons). See TNT equivalent examples for an extended table of comparable energies.

The exact effects of an impact would vary based on the asteroid&#x27;s composition, and the location and angle of impact. Any impact of Apophis would be extremely detrimental to an area of thousands of square kilometres, but would be unlikely to have long-lasting global effects, such as the initiation of an impact winter. Assuming Apophis is a stony asteroid with a density of 3,000 kg/m3, if it were to impact into sedimentary rock, Apophis would create a impact crater.
===Expired 2036 path of risk===
In 2008, the B612 Foundation made estimates of Apophis&#x27;s path if a 2036 Earth impact were to occur, as part of an effort to develop viable deflection strategies. The result was a narrow corridor a few kilometres wide, called the &quot;path of risk&quot;, extending across southern Russia, across the north Pacific (relatively close to the coastlines of California and Mexico), then right between Nicaragua and Costa Rica, crossing northern Colombia and Venezuela, ending in the Atlantic, just before reaching Africa. Using the computer simulation tool NEOSim, it was estimated that the hypothetical impact of Apophis in countries such as Colombia and Venezuela, which were in the path of risk, could have more than 10 million casualties. A deep-water impact in the Atlantic or Pacific oceans would produce an incoherent short-range tsunami with a potential destructive radius (inundation height of &gt;2 m) of roughly for most of North America, Brazil and Africa, for Japan and for some areas in Hawaii.

== Exploration ==

=== OSIRIS-APEX post-Earth-encounter rendezvous ===
The &quot;OSIRIS-REx&quot; spacecraft returned a sample of Bennu to Earth on September 24, 2023. After ejecting the sample canister, the spacecraft can use its remaining fuel to target another body during an extended mission. Apophis is the only asteroid which the spacecraft could reach for a long-duration rendezvous, rather than a brief flyby. In April 2022, the extension was approved, and &quot;OSIRIS-REx&quot; will perform a rendezvous with Apophis in April 2029, a few days after the close approach to Earth. It will study the asteroid for 18 months and perform a maneuver similar to the one it made during sample collection at Bennu, by approaching the surface and firing its thrusters. This will expose the asteroid&#x27;s subsurface and allow mission scientists to learn more about the asteroid&#x27;s material properties. For its Apophis mission after the sample return, &quot;OSIRIS-REx&quot; was renamed &quot;OSIRIS-APEX&quot; (short for OSIRIS-Apophis Explorer).

=== Other proposed space missions ===
==== Planetary Society competition ====
In 2007, the Planetary Society, a California-based space advocacy group, organised a $50,000 competition to design an uncrewed space probe that would &#x27;shadow&#x27; Apophis for almost a year, taking measurements that would &quot;determine whether it will impact Earth, thus helping governments decide whether to mount a deflection mission to alter its orbit&quot;. The society received 37 entries from 20 countries on 6 continents.

The commercial competition was won by a design called &quot;Foresight&quot; created by SpaceWorks Engineering. SpaceWorks proposed a simple orbiter with only two instruments and a radio beacon at a cost of ~US$140 million, launched aboard a Minotaur IV between 2012 and 2014. &quot;Pharos&quot;, the winning student entry, would be an orbiter with four science instruments that would rendezvous with and track Apophis. The spacecraft would have been launched in April or May 2013 aboard a Delta II 7925 rocket, to arrive at the asteroid after a cruise of 233 to 309 days. It would have carried four additional &quot;BUOI&quot; probes that would have impacted the surface of Apophis over the course of two weeks.

==== Don Quijote mission ====
Apophis is one of two asteroids that were considered by the European Space Agency as the target of its Don Quijote mission concept to study the effects of impacting an asteroid.

==== Chinese mission ====
China had planned an encounter with Apophis in 2022, several years prior to the close approach in 2029. This mission, now known as &quot;Tianwen-2&quot;, would have included exploration and close study of three asteroids including an extended encounter with Apophis for close observation, and land on the asteroid 1996 FG3 to conduct in situ sampling analysis on the surface. The launch date is now scheduled for May 2025, with a different set of targets.

==== RAMSES ====
Apophis is the target of the European Space Agency&#x27;s proposed RAMSES (Rapid Apophis Mission for Security and Safety) mission, with a launch in April 2028 and rendezvous with the asteroid in 2029.

== Proposed deflection strategies ==

Studies by NASA, ESA, and various research groups in addition to the Planetary Society contest teams, have described a number of proposals for deflecting Apophis or similar objects, including gravitational tractor, kinetic impact, and nuclear bomb methods.

On December 30, 2009, Anatoly Perminov, the director of the Russian Federal Space Agency, said in an interview that Roscosmos will also study designs for a possible deflection mission to Apophis.

On August 16, 2011, researchers at China&#x27;s Tsinghua University proposed launching a mission to knock Apophis onto a safer course using an impactor spacecraft in a retrograde orbit, steered and powered by a solar sail. Instead of moving the asteroid on its potential resonant return to Earth, Shengping Gong and his team believe the secret is shifting the asteroid away from entering the gravitational keyhole in the first place.

On February 15, 2016, Sabit Saitgarayev, of the Makeyev Rocket Design Bureau, announced intentions to use Russian ICBMs to target relatively small near-Earth objects. Although the report stated that likely targets would be between the 20 to 50 metres in size, it was also stated that 99942 Apophis would be an object subject to tests by the program.

In October 2022, a method of mapping the inside of a potentially problematic asteroid, such as 99942 Apophis, in order to determine the best area for impact was proposed.

== Popular culture ==
In Id Software&#x27;s video game &quot;Rage&quot;, the backstory involves the asteroid colliding with Earth on August 23, 2029. The asteroid almost wipes out the human race and ushers in a post-apocalyptic age.

<text>Benjamin Luke Cousins (born 30 June 1978) is a former professional Australian rules footballer and media personality who played for and in the Australian Football League (AFL). Cousins is listed by journalist Mike Sheahan as one of the fifty greatest players of all time. During his 12-year, 238-game career with West Coast, he won several of the league&#x27;s highest individual awards, including a Brownlow Medal, Most Valuable Player and a premiership medallion. He was also selected six times in the All-Australian Team and represented Australia in the International Rules Series. He was West Coast&#x27;s club champion for four seasons and captain for five seasons.

Cousins&#x27; football career was marred by highly publicised off-field incidents involving illegal recreational drug use, traffic convictions and association with criminal elements. On several occasions he was fined or sanctioned by West Coast, culminating in the termination of his contract in October 2007. The following month, he was banned from AFL for one year by the AFL Commission for &quot;bringing the game into disrepute&quot;. Amid predictions that he would remain undrafted, Richmond claimed Cousins with the last pick of the 2008 draft. He played 32 games across two seasons at the club, retiring from the AFL at the end of the 2010 season.

Cousins co-produced a documentary film titled &quot;Such is Life: The Troubled Times of Ben Cousins&quot;, saying he hoped it would serve as a cautionary tale against drug use. Released days after his retirement, it was &quot;one of the most-watched documentaries in Australian history.&quot; Post-football, Cousins continued to struggle with his drug addiction and have run-ins with the law, and in 2017 he received a 12-month prison sentence for a variety of offences. In 2023, after beating his addictions, Cousins joined the Seven News team in Perth where he reads the morning news sports bulletin and is emerging as one of the city’s leading sports reporters. In 2025, he joined the Hit Network to co-host the WA breakfast radio show, &quot;Pete &amp; Kymba with Ben Cousins&quot;.

==Early life==
Cousins was born in Geelong, Victoria, on 30 June 1978, to Stephanie and Bryan, an Australian rules footballer who had moved from Western Australia to play for the Geelong Football Club in the Victorian Football League. When Cousins was 18 months old, his family moved back to Perth, Western Australia, where he was raised with younger siblings Matthew, Sophie and Melanie. He played junior football for the Bull Creek-Leeming Junior Football Club and for his private school, Wesley College. In his last year at Wesley in 1995, he was recruited to join the East Fremantle Football Club&#x27;s senior side in the West Australian Football League (WAFL) and played for both his school and East Fremantle throughout the season.

While Cousins was still at school, three AFL teams competed to draft him under the father–son rule: the Geelong Football Club, the West Coast Eagles, and the newly formed Fremantle Football Club. Cousins&#x27; father Bryan played 238 games for Perth in the WAFL and 67 games for Geelong in the VFL during the 1970s and 1980s. Geelong&#x27;s recruiting manager, Stephen Wells, said, &quot;Ben barracked for Geelong and we tried everything to get him here.&quot; However, Cousins preferred to remain based in Western Australia and chose West Coast in October 1995.

==AFL career==

===West Coast Eagles===
====1996–1997: Rising Star Award and increasing popularity====
At 17, a week after his tenth WAFL game for East Fremantle, Cousins played his first AFL match and kicked two goals for West Coast against Geelong. He won the Norwich Rising Star award for his debut season in 1996, polling 15 votes from the six judges to beat Shannon Grant by one point.

Cousins&#x27; popularity continued to increase over the following seasons. In 1998, the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; ran a two-page article across its centre pages about 20-year-old Cousins, titled &quot;West goes wild for the kid&quot;. The article portrayed Cousins as a sex symbol and &quot;football&#x27;s answer to Brad Pitt&quot;. When asked about the article, he said the popularity &quot;comes with the territory... If you want to be a league footballer you have to accept that it is part of the game.&quot; Sports agent Ricky Nixon approached Cousins in 1998 about managing his endorsement deals, because &quot;He&#x27;s good-looking, he elected to stay in Perth and not play in Victoria, opposition coaches take notice of him and on top of that he&#x27;s a future leader.&quot; In 1999, International Management Group, who managed sports stars such as Tiger Woods and Pete Sampras, said they would like to sign Ben, as &quot;There is no doubt that he is now in the top bracket of players and has great marketing potential... Apart from being an outstanding footballer, he is a quality young man.&quot; Ross Nicholas, West Coast&#x27;s marketing manager, said:

&quot;He&#x27;s easily the most sought-after Eagle... No player was, or is, as popular as Ben. His appeal is so diverse. Kids want his autograph and photograph. Sponsors want him to sit next to them. They want him to push their product... If Ben&#x27;s well managed, the sky&#x27;s the limit for him... They&#x27;ve got to find the balance between his commercial potential and his contribution to the community. The club offers protection, but it&#x27;s up to Ben what demands he puts himself under.&quot;

====1997–2000: First finals appearance and first All-Australian selection====
In 1998, Cousins was selected in the All-Australian Team and was runner-up in West Coast&#x27;s Best and Fairest. He played in his first AFL finals game in 1999, against the Western Bulldogs in a qualifying final at the MCG, and the year included another selection in the All-Australian Team and representing Australia in the International Rules Series. In 2000, Cousins signed a new three-year contract with the West Coast Eagles, reportedly worth nearly A$1 million.

====2000–2003: Best and Fairest at West Coast and appointed co-captain====
He played his 100th game amid speculation he would take over the captaincy from Guy McKenna, who was due to retire after the same game. Cousins said, &quot;After you play two or three seasons, you think of the possibility of a leadership role down the track, but the talk of it has certainly come a lot earlier than I would have thought.&quot; In 2001, Cousins was named co-captain, sharing the role with Dean Kemp. He won his first club Best and Fairest at the end of the season, a feat which he repeated in 2002 and 2003, and he was again named in the All-Australian Team in 2001 and 2002. Kemp&#x27;s retirement saw Cousins become the captain in 2002, a role he filled until 2006. In 2005, West Coast coach John Worsfold said of Cousins&#x27; fifth year as captain, &quot;Ben is improving all the time and with the way this group is coming along, I think he is going to be a great leader&quot;.

====2003–2004: Continued individual success and injuries====
In early 2003, Cousins injured his ankle in a game against Hawthorn but played on through five weeks of pain-killing injections. In Round 15, 2004, he injured his back and missed six games. Cousins said, &quot;That injury is something that I got over and am probably no chance of getting a relapse... The other side to it is, because I have played 10 years of consistent AFL footy, I&#x27;ve probably got an older back than someone my age&quot;. In Round 1, 2005, he dislocated a finger and missed one round after undergoing an operation. West Coast chief executive Trevor Nesbitt said, &quot;There&#x27;s no doubt that he&#x27;s at his best when under pressure and he&#x27;s so resilient; he plays with injuries that other players wouldn&#x27;t&quot;.

====2004–2006: Brownlow Medal and Grand Final berth====

After Cousins played his 200th game in July 2005 he was given a &quot;rousing reception from 41,524 grateful fans&quot;, as video clips of his ten years at West Coast were shown at the end of the game. Cousins was &quot;possibly the highest-profile sportsman in Western Australia&quot;, the youngest of the 10 West Coast players to reach 200 games and the 14th youngest in the history of the AFL/VFL.

Cousins won the Brownlow Medal, the AFL&#x27;s highest individual player award, on 19 September 2005 with 20 votes, ahead of teammate Daniel Kerr on 19 votes and Nick Dal Santo on 18 votes. Cousins was the favourite to win with bookmakers, after five previous top-10 finishes. He did not attend the award ceremony in Melbourne, remaining in Perth to prepare for West Coast&#x27;s Grand Final match against Sydney Swans the following weekend. His celebration was &quot;very quiet, I went over to the bar, bought the folks a bottle of champagne, had one lemonade and went up to the (hotel) room. I managed to get to sleep before midnight, which was a bonus.&quot; West Coast&#x27;s last training session in Perth before travelling to their first Grand Final game since 1994 was attended by 3,000 fans. Trevor Nesbitt, West Coast&#x27;s chief executive, said he expected that the combination of the team&#x27;s Grand Final appearance, Cousins&#x27; Brownlow win, and Chris Judd&#x27;s Brownlow win in the previous year, would lead to a turnover of around $2 million in club merchandise. Nesbitt added:

&quot;It&#x27;s quite a special time for the club and it&#x27;s probably worth $1 million to WA footy as a minimum I would think... The performances of Chris and Ben assist us in raising more money for WA football and their contribution is just outstanding. They&#x27;re marquee players and, apart from everything else that happens with them, they are extremely beneficial for all West Australians.&quot;

West Coast lost the 2005 Grand Final to Sydney by four points, but as well as his Brownlow win, Cousins was awarded another West Coast Best and Fairest and the players&#x27; Most Valuable Player award, with 159 votes compared to runner-up Matthew Pavlich&#x27;s 99 votes. He was runner-up to Barry Hall in the coaches&#x27; player of the year award, and in statistics, had 612 disposals, 24 goals, and ranked in the top five of the league in nine of the 12 categories.

====2006–2007: Premiership Cup, off-field misconduct and captaincy resignation====
In February 2006, Cousins resigned his captaincy after an off-field incident where he fled a booze bus. In May 2006, he signed a new three-year contract with West Coast, and in September 2006, West Coast won the Grand Final, defeating Sydney by one point. Cousins was suspended indefinitely by West Coast on 20 March 2007 after missing two training sessions. It was later confirmed that Cousins had a substance abuse problem.
After returning from four weeks of rehabilitation in Malibu, California, for substance abuse, Cousins was offered an amended contract by West Coast, rumoured to contain strict conditions such as repaying the cost of rehab and undertaking regular drug tests. On 29 June 2007, Cousins was given clearance by the AFL to resume training with the West Coast Eagles, which he did the following Monday. However, he injured a hamstring in training, delaying his comeback until West Coast&#x27;s home game against Sydney on 21 July at Subiaco Oval. He gained 38 disposals and six marks in the game, inspiring West Coast&#x27;s win.

====2007–2008: Drug possession arrest, delisted by West Coast Eagles and 12-month AFL ban====
On 16 October 2007, Cousins&#x27; car was stopped in Northbridge and searched. He was arrested for drug possession and refusing to submit to a blood test. The Eagles sacked him the next day, which meant that he was no longer a registered AFL player. On 19 November, he was banned from playing senior football for 12 months by the AFL Commission for &quot;bringing the game into disrepute&quot;, and was formally delisted by West Coast on 30 November. Eagles officials said that he would never appear in an Eagles guernsey again, and AFL CEO Andrew Demetriou said it would be &quot;extremely difficult&quot; for him to ever return to the AFL.

===Richmond Tigers===
====2008–2010: Career renewal at Richmond Tigers and retirement====

In November 2008, the AFL Commission cleared Cousins to play AFL football in 2009. The Commission ruled that Cousins must submit to regular drug tests, including urine testing up to three times per week and hair testing up to four times annually. Cousins attended drug testing in early November with no body hair long enough to sample.

Several teams showed an interest in drafting Cousins for 2009, including Collingwood Football Club, St Kilda Football Club and Brisbane Lions. Collingwood sent a private investigator to Perth to follow Cousins for several days. After meeting with Victorian Chief Commissioner of Police Christine Nixon in October 2008, Collingwood announced that they would not draft Cousins. In November, after reviewing Cousins and consulting stakeholders for five months, St Kilda said they would not draft him. The day before the national draft, Brisbane issued a media release that said they would not be drafting Cousins. On 29 November 2008, Cousins was not selected in the AFL National Draft.
Ahead of the AFL Pre-season Draft in December 2008, Richmond Football Club approached the AFL Commission for approval to move injured senior player Graham Polak to its rookie list in order to obtain a second draft pick in the pre-season draft, which it said it would use to select Cousins. The AFL Commission had given approval to Essendon two years earlier to do similar with Adam Ramanauskas during his battle with cancer. The commission, with the support of the AFLPA and most of the clubs, denied Richmond&#x27;s request. However, Richmond selected Cousins with its only Pre-season Draft selection (#6 overall) on 16 December. Following this Richmond received an influx of new club members and Cousins trained with the team the following day in front of a crowd of around 2,000. In Richmond&#x27;s Round 1 game against Carlton on 26 March, Cousins strained his hamstring during the final quarter. He played a game with the Coburg Football Club in the Victorian Football League before returning to the AFL in Round 7 against Brisbane.

On 17 August 2010, after weeks of speculation by the media, Cousins announced his retirement in front of his family and huge crowd. During the speech, he thanked everyone who had assisted him during his career, acknowledged his encounters with drugs and the law, and apologised to his family for the situation he had put them in:
I&#x27;ll always regret what I&#x27;ve put my family through. There&#x27;s a lot of shame and regret. People wonder why I haven&#x27;t broken down or shed a tear (in public). My tears are something that I hold close to me; they&#x27;re for me and my family.

==Media career==
In June 2023, Cousins commenced presenting the sport on &quot;7NEWS Morning Edition&quot; in Perth.

In early 2024, Seven Network announced that Cousins will appear as a contestant on the forthcoming twenty-first season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars Australia.&quot; He was the fifth contestant to be eliminated.

In February 2025, Cousins joined the Hit Network to co-host the WA breakfast radio show &quot;Pete &amp; Kymba&quot;, with Pete Curulli and Kymba Cahill, with the show subsequently being renamed &quot;Pete &amp; Kymba with Ben Cousins&quot;.

==Personal life==
===Early professional career===
In 1997, Cousins took part in an education campaign for the WA Asthma Foundation. During his first year in the AFL, Cousins said his chest often felt tight and he had difficulty playing, &quot;but if I monitored my asthma correctly and took the right medication, I was able to overcome those effects&quot;. In 1999, he had a mild asthma attack while warming up for a game against Melbourne, then fainted while at a restaurant after the game. West Coast&#x27;s football manager, Rod Lester-Smith, said Cousins may have been affected by asthma, low blood pressure from playing the game earlier, and a corked leg that caused some internal bleeding. He was taken to Murdoch Hospital and recovered quickly.

West Coast coach Ken Judge was told by a Perth detective in 2001 that Cousins and two of his teammates may have been using illegal drugs. Judge passed this information on to the club&#x27;s administration but no action was taken.

In September 2002, Cousins punched teammate Daniel Kerr at the club&#x27;s best and fairest award celebrations, after an argument about Kerr&#x27;s relationship with Cousins&#x27; sister Melanie. The altercation resulted in Cousins breaking his arm.

In May 2005, Cousins and teammate Michael Gardiner were questioned about their acquaintance with John Kizon and Troy Mercanti, two Perth underworld figures who were allegedly involved in a stabbing and shooting at Perth&#x27;s Metro City nightclub. Cousins was in Melbourne at the time of the shooting, but it was claimed that he and Gardiner had received phone calls from the figures both before and after the incident at the nightclub. Police questioned Cousins and Gardiner about the incident but they refused to co-operate. Newspaper columnists at &quot;The West Australian&quot; and talkback radio callers demanded Cousins resign his captaincy. His judgment had previously been questioned by West Coast management after he and Gardiner were photographed entering Crown Casino with Kizon in 2001. However, no disciplinary action was taken. Trevor Nesbitt, the team&#x27;s chief executive, said:

&quot;We are prepared to give them more than one chance. In this case, it is maybe their last chance... They have had chances before, they have had opportunities before, they have made mistakes before. It gets to the point where those mistakes can&#x27;t be tolerated any longer. This hurts us. It hurts our brand. It hurts our image.&quot;

===Troubled years===

On 12 February 2006, Cousins fled a booze bus, abandoning his Mercedes-Benz and girlfriend Samantha Druce in the middle lane of Perth&#x27;s Canning Highway and running from police with a male passenger. The male passenger was later caught and breath-tested, but Cousins eluded the police by swimming into the Swan River. On 20 February, Cousins resigned as captain of the West Coast Eagles. He pleaded guilty to obstructing the path of another driver and obstructing a public officer in court in March 2006 and was fined $900 plus costs. He was fined an additional $5,000 by West Coast.

On 3 December 2006, Cousins was arrested for public intoxication after passing out in front of Crown Casino in Melbourne and spent four hours in jail. He was released without being fined or making a court appearance. The West Coast Eagles later announced that the club would not discipline Cousins, stating that the media scrutiny was sufficient punishment.

In early March 2007, Cousins and his girlfriend of 13 years, Samantha Druce, ended their relationship. On 20 March, Cousins was suspended indefinitely from West Coast after failing to attend two training sessions. West Coast club chairman Dalton Gooding stated at a press conference that Cousins was facing a &quot;number of personal and professional issues&quot; and that &quot;Over the past few weeks those issues have come to the surface and it&#x27;s time that Ben was suspended from the club to go away and try to tackle those issues head on.&quot; He also said:

&quot;We always said we would suspend players if they reoffended and Ben has reoffended by missing training, and we have been very consistent with that … We believe he&#x27;s breached his contract and acted unprofessionally and that&#x27;s why he&#x27;s been suspended and that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re giving him every opportunity to fix up his personal and private issues.&quot;

It was later revealed that Cousins underwent an AFL drug test on 19 March 2007, and it was later confirmed that he had a substance abuse problem. On 21 March, Cousins was admitted to drug rehabilitation. On 22 March, his father Bryan released a statement in a video broadcast by Network Ten:

&quot;I am making this statement today not on behalf of Ben, but as a father on behalf of his son... Ben&#x27;s problem relates to substance abuse and he faces a great challenge... We acknowledge the public scrutiny that comes with the opportunities and privileges that Ben has had, but I ask now with the issues that Ben faces, that my son be given the privacy and the opportunity that he needs to deal with this problem... Ben, you are not alone with this challenge. Your family, your friends, your fans and your footy club want you to overcome this issue and win in the same manner in which you have done throughout your whole career.&quot;

===Rehabilitation commences===
At the end of March 2007, Cousins flew to Malibu, California, for rehabilitation at the Summit Center where he stayed for four weeks. He returned to Perth on 30 April 2007, with much attention from the media. On 4 May, he released a televised apology, saying:

&quot;As you are aware, I have been at an overseas rehabilitation centre for the past month undergoing treatment for a number of personal issues, including illness as the result of substance use... I apologise to the West Coast Eagles Football Club, sponsors, the AFL and the community for my actions... I know that in order to play football again I will have to be accepted back by the players and staff of the West Coast Eagles and the AFL, and I&#x27;m willing to fulfil any obligations imposed on me. At the present time I don&#x27;t know when I&#x27;ll play again. My priority is to regain my health, my life and my standing.&quot;

Chris Mainwaring, a former West Coast Eagles player and close friend of Cousins, died of a drug overdose on 1 October 2007. Cousins received renewed media attention, as he was the last person to see Mainwaring alive, having visited him twice on the night of his death to provide emotional support and deliver food. On 16 October, Cousins was arrested in the Perth suburb of Northbridge after police pulled over his vehicle because of &quot;the manner of his driving&quot;. Cousins&#x27; vehicle was searched, and he was charged with failure to comply with a police-ordered drug assessment and possession of a prohibited drug, the police having found quantities of prescription drugs diazepam, Viagra, oxycodone and Caverta as well as traces of ecstasy and cocaine on a $20 note in the car. Cousins was sacked by West Coast for serious breaches of his agreement with the club the day after his arrest. On 19 October, Cousins&#x27;s lawyer, Shane Brennan, reported that police would drop the drug-related charges against him. On 27 October, Cousins flew to Los Angeles to continue his drug rehabilitation at the Summit Center. The media reported that Cousins was missing and had failed to attend treatment in Malibu, and he was admitted to hospital several days later after an alleged cocaine binge. No charges were laid by US police. He returned to Australia and told a packed media conference that he was &quot;overcoming a drug addiction&quot;. A week later he flew to the Gold Coast for a three-day alcohol and drug binge during Schoolies week.

A painting of Cousins titled &quot;Waiting for the Day&quot; reached the finals of the 2009 Archibald Prize. Painted by South Australian artist Megan Roodenrys, it shows Cousins in bed battling through a sleepless night during his drug scandal. The painting was bought at auction by a Melbourne businessman the following year for $18,000.

In March 2010, Cousins was twice admitted to Epworth Hospital after suffering from abdominal pain and cramping. The Richmond Football Club denied reports that it had warned Cousins to curb his drinking amid fears his AFL career could be shortened by excessive alcohol consumption. On 12 April, Cousins was among four Richmond players suspended by the club after a drunken escapade at the team hotel in Sydney earlier that week. Although Cousins was not intoxicated, the club deemed that he had not acted responsibly or in a manner expected of him by the club, and he was suspended for one week. On 5 July, Cousins was admitted to hospital after a &quot;severe reaction to prescribed sleeping medication&quot;. His hospitalisation prompted debate over the use of legal stimulants such as caffeine and legal sedatives such as sleeping pills among sportspeople, with the Premier of Victoria, John Brumby, disapproving of their use.
A feature-length documentary on Cousins&#x27; personal problems, filmed over a two-year period, aired on the Seven Network in August 2010. Titled &quot;Such is Life&quot;, it is named after bushranger and outlaw Ned Kelly&#x27;s alleged last words, which Cousins got tattooed across his torso in 2007. Cousins is featured taking illicit drugs, speaking candidly about his addiction and saying that he hopes his story will ultimately help to save lives. It was one of the year&#x27;s most-watched programs in Australia, with over two million viewers nationwide. In November of that year, Cousins released an autiobraphy, &quot;Ben Cousins: My Life Story&quot;, published by Macmillan Australia.

==Legal issues==
In May 2011, it was reported that since Cousins&#x27; departure from AFL football his life had lost direction: he had failed to commit to a mining job in Western Australia and was struggling to find focus. His father confirmed that his son&#x27;s attempt to rebuild his life had taken a &quot;couple of bad turns&quot; in the previous three months and that he was battling &quot;troubled times&quot;. In September 2011, Cousins&#x27; partner Maylea Elizabeth Tinecheff gave birth to their first child, a son, Bobby Ernest Cousins.

On 9 January 2012, Cousins was admitted to Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital after suffering a fall at a drug rehabilitation clinic. He slipped while getting out of a shower, striking his head on a basin and injuring his neck. It was reported that Cousins had been experiencing continuing problems with illicit drugs, despite seeking help at several drug rehabilitation clinics, and that he had &quot;never been clean for more than three months.&quot; It was also reported that he had recently undertaken an extreme drug binge lasting for approximately eight days. Cousins was committed by doctors to a suburban mental health unit under police escort on 13 January 2012 after suffering a four-day episode of drug-induced psychosis while being treated at Sir Charles Gardiner Hospital.

On 27 March 2012, Cousins was arrested by police at Esperance Airport, in the south of Western Australia, on suspicion of possession of drugs. He was strip-searched and found to have methamphetamine secreted in his anus. The initial charge of intent to sell or supply the drug was later downgraded to simple possession, to which Cousins pled guilty and was fined $800. On 17 April 2012, Cousins was arrested and charged again in Western Australia for possession of cannabis and a smoking implement.

On 11 March 2015, Cousins was arrested in the Perth suburb of Bicton after leading police on a slow-speed car chase, stating he could not stop due to a family emergency. Four days later, it was reported that Cousins had been sent to a mental health facility after he was found inside the Special Air Service&#x27;s Campbell Barracks in Swanbourne. Cousins was arrested for the third time in two weeks after trying to outrun police in Canning Vale following a &quot;bizarre incident&quot; outside a Sikh temple.

In June 2016, police intervened when Cousins attempted to direct traffic on Perth&#x27;s Canning Highway. He was described by witnesses as being &quot;really lost, confused and making no sense at all&quot;, and taken to Fiona Stanley Hospital.

In November 2016, Cousins failed to appear in court on charges of breaching a violence restraining order and possessing methamphetamine. A bench warrant was issued for his arrest. At around 1:30 am the following day, while driving high on methamphetamine in High Wycombe, he crashed his car head-on into a truck. He sustained minor injuries and was taken to Royal Perth Hospital under police guard.

=== Imprisonment ===
Cousins was arrested in the Perth suburb of Melville in February 2017 and charged with a number of offences related to drugs, violence and stalking, including seven counts of breaching a violence restraining order. The following month, at the Magistrates Court of Western Australia, Cousins was charged with eleven offences and received a 12-month prison sentence. He served his sentence at Acacia Prison. In May 2017, it was reported that Cousins was attacked by another inmate after borrowing his tea cup and not returning it. Cousins became eligible for parole six months into his sentence, but the parole board denied his application and ordered him to complete rehabilitation courses after he failed a drug test.

Cousins was released from prison in January 2018. As part of his parole conditions, Cousins began part-time work in the West Coast Eagles&#x27; community and game development department, but abruptly left the job in April 2018. In August 2018, he was arrested and charged with multiple offences, including drug possession, making threats and breaking a violence restraining order. He was released on bail in April 2019.

<text>Alfonso II (1180 – 2 February 1209) was the second son of Alfonso II of Aragon (who was Alfonso I of Provence) and Sancha of Castile. His father transferred the County of Provence from his uncle Sancho to him in 1185. Alfonso II was born in Barcelona.

In 1193, Alfonso married Gersenda II of Sabran, daughter of Rainou of Sabran and Garsenda I of Forcalquier, daughter of William IV of Forcalquier. Garsenda was named after her mother, who was the heiress of William IV, but predeceased him. Garsenda therefore inherited Forcalquier from her grandfather. She was only thirteen years of age when, in 1193, her grandfather William IV and Alfonso II signed the Treaty of Aix whereby Garsenda would inherit William&#x27;s county and would marry Alfonso, who was in line to become Count of Provence. The marriage took place at Aix-en-Provence in July 1193.

Their son was Ramon Berenguer V as count of Provence. Their daughter, Garsenda, married Guillermo II de Montcada, and bore him two children, including Gaston VII, Viscount of Béarn.

According to explanations in the manuscripts of Gaucelm Faidit&#x27;s poems, Alfonso was a rival of the troubadour for the love of Jourdaine d&#x27;Embrun.

Alfonso II died in Palermo, Sicily, while accompanying his sister Constance to her wedding with Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor.

<text>Lidia Serafina Argondizzo (born 13 October 1960) is an Australian politician. She was the Labor Party (ALP) member of the Victorian Legislative Council representing Templestowe Province from 2002 to 2006.

Argondizzo was born in Italy, but immigrated to Australia as a child. She attended Preston Girls&#x27; High School and received an MBA from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. After graduating, she was employed by the Victorian Health Department for several years. It was during this period that Argondizzo was elected as a councillor in the City of Northcote in 1987. She left the Health Department the following year to take up a position as an electorate officer for Giovanni Sgro, an ALP member of the Legislative Council was also in the Party&#x27;s left-wing.

In 1989, Argondizzo was elected mayor of the City of Northcote, and got a job as an electorate officer with ALP Senator Barney Cooney. She continued on as a councillor until 1993. During this period, she made several unsuccessful attempts to secure ALP preselection for a seat in either State or Federal parliament. At one time she was a member of the splinter Left faction the Pledge Left, where she appeared likely to obtain preselection partly due to the support she received from her brother Frank Argondizzo, a then official at the Vehicle Builders Union. Tensions emerged within the Pledge Left about her candidacy and she was not selected as a result. She returned to the Socialist Left faction soon after.

In 2002, she was chosen as the ALP candidate for the seat of Templestowe Province at the election due later that year. Templestowe was held by a margin of nearly six percent by Deputy Liberal Leader in the Upper House and Shadow Minister for Natural Resources and Energy Carlo Furletti. There was a large swing to the Labor Party at the state election and Argondizzo won as a result, making Furletti one of the major casualties of the election.

She was appointed as the Government Whip in the Legislative Council after the election. She has served on the Library, Legislative Council Standing Orders and Scrutiny of Acts and Regulations Committees.

The Legislative Council was substantially reformed in the leadup to the 2006 state election, and Argondizzo was one of eight incumbent Labor members forced to fit into one new, larger, electorate which would only return a maximum of three for Labor. As a relatively junior member of the government, she did not have priority for one of the winnable Legislative Council seats, and attempted to shift to the Legislative Assembly by contesting the Liberal-held marginal seat of electoral district of Doncaster, then held by the retiring Victor Perton. She was defeated by Mary Wooldridge.

<doc id="1321528" wikidata="Q150276" url="?curid=1321528" title="Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma">
<text>Nkosazana Clarice Dlamini-Zuma (; born 27 January 1949), sometimes referred to by her initials NDZ, is a South African politician, medical doctor and former anti-apartheid activist. A longstanding member of the African National Congress (ANC), she currently serves as a Chancellor of the University of Limpopo. 

Dlamini-Zuma was born and educated in the former Natal province, where, as a student, she became involved in the Black Consciousness Movement through the South African Students&#x27; Organisation. Between 1976 and 1990, she lived in exile outside South Africa, primarily in the United Kingdom and Swaziland, where she practiced medicine and engaged in ANC activism. Since 1994, Dlamini-Zuma has served in the cabinet of every post-apartheid South African president. She was Minister of Health under President Nelson Mandela, and Minister of Foreign Affairs for ten years under Presidents Thabo Mbeki and Kgalema Motlanthe. During the first term of President Jacob Zuma, she was Minister of Home Affairs, in which portfolio she was credited with turning around a dysfunctional department. During President Cyril Ramaphosa&#x27;s second term, she was briefly also Minister of Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities.

Under President Cyril Ramaphosa, she served as Minister in the Presidency for Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation, with responsibility for the National Planning Commission, before becoming Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, in which capacity she had a prominent and controversial role in regulating South Africa&#x27;s lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. She was absent from the South African government between October 2012 and January 2017, when she served as the Chairperson of the African Union Commission, making her the first woman to lead either that organisation or its predecessor, the Organisation of African Unity. Her tenure in that position was also controversial.

She has been a member of the ANC&#x27;s National Executive Committee since the early 1990s, and has twice campaigned unsuccessfully for leadership positions in the party: in 2007, at the ANC&#x27;s 52nd National Conference, Motlanthe defeated her to win the deputy presidency; while at the 54th National Conference in 2017, she narrowly lost the ANC presidency to Ramaphosa, the current incumbent.

==Early life and career==
Nkosazana Clarice Dlamini was born on 27 January 1949 to a Zulu family in Natal. Her father, Willibrod Gweva, was a teacher, whose brother Stephen Dlamini was an activist in the African National Congress (ANC); her mother Rose was a homemaker. The eldest of eight children, Dlamini-Zuma completed high school in Amanzimtoti at Adams College, a mission school attended by many ANC stalwarts. She matriculated in 1967. Wanting to become a lawyer but acquiescing in her father&#x27;s eagerness that she become a doctor, she earned a BSc degree in zoology and botany from the University of Zululand in 1971, and then went to the University of Natal to study medicine. While there, she became an active member of South African Students&#x27; Organisation, a Black Consciousness grouping, and was elected as its deputy president in 1976.

With her political activity attracting police attention, she went into exile later in 1976. She therefore finished her medical studies in the United Kingdom, graduating with an MBChB from the University of Bristol in 1978. She was chairperson of the ANC Youth Section in Britain between 1977 and 1978, and in that capacity often travelled elsewhere in Europe. After she graduated, Dlamini-Zuma worked in England for two years, at Bristol&#x27;s Frenchay Hospital and Berkshire&#x27;s Canadian Red Cross Memorial Hospital, while serving on the British Regional Political Committee of the ANC. She then spent five years in Swaziland, where she worked as a paediatric officer at the Mbabane Government Hospital. She met her future husband, Umkhonto we Sizwe activist Jacob Zuma, while embedded in the ANC underground in Swaziland.

In 1985, Dlamini-Zuma returned to the United Kingdom to complete a diploma in tropical child health from Liverpool University&#x27;s School of Tropical Medicine. In subsequent years, she continued her work in paediatrics; helped found and directed the Health Refugee Trust, a British non-governmental organisation; and then returned briefly to Africa in 1989, to work for the ANC Health Department in Lusaka, Zambia. She returned to South Africa when the ANC was unbanned by the National Party government in 1990, signalling the beginning of the country&#x27;s transition to non-racial democracy. During the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) negotiations in 1992, she was part of the Gender Advisory Committee. In the transition period, she also served on the Executive Committee and Health Committee of the ANC&#x27;s Southern Natal branch, and as a research scientist at South Africa&#x27;s Medical Research Council in Durban.

==Career in government==
===1994–1999: Minister of Health===
In 1994, after South Africa&#x27;s first election under universal suffrage, Dlamini-Zuma was appointed as Minister of Health in the cabinet of President Nelson Mandela, where she continued the work of her predecessor, Rina Venter, in racially desegregating the health system and broadening state anti-tobacco measures. In 1999, Dlamini-Zuma introduced the Tobacco Products Amendment Bill, which made it illegal to smoke in public buildings. Her term also coincided with the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in South Africa. Despite Dlamini-Zuma&#x27;s history of HIV/AIDS activism, including a stint on the National Aids Coordinating Committee in 1992 and a period as Deputy Chairperson of the United Nations AIDS programme (UNAIDS) in 1995, she and her Ministry were criticised for publicly supporting Virodene, a &quot;quack remedy&quot; for HIV/AIDS.

====&quot;Sarafina II&quot;====
In August 1995, the Department of Health awarded a R14.27m contract to Mbongeni Ngema, a &quot;good friend&quot; of Dlamini-Zuma&#x27;s, to produce a sequel to &quot;Sarafina!,&quot; a popular South African musical. &quot;Sarafina II&quot; was designed as an HIV/AIDS public awareness initiative. However, investigations revealed that Dlamini-Zuma had misled Parliament about the source of the project&#x27;s funding (which the Department had falsely said was sponsored by the European Union) and had ignored proper bidding procedures. The play was shelved in 1996, after the Public Protector published a report criticising the project&#x27;s poor financial controls and procedural irregularities.
=== 1999–2009: Minister of Foreign Affairs ===
Dlamini-Zuma served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1999 to 2009, under Presidents Thabo Mbeki and Kgalema Motlanthe. Opposition leader Tony Leon said that her appointment was &quot;like sending the bull into the china shop&quot;. At the beginning of her term, in 1999, she was involved in shuttle diplomacy in the Second Congo War, mediating among factions of the Rally for Congolese Democracy and between Uganda and Rwanda. According to &quot;Africa Confidential&quot;, she was also particularly involved in pursuing Mbeki&#x27;s goal of reforming the United Nations to increase the relative power of Global South countries, and more generally she promoted Mbeki&#x27;s pan-Africanist &quot;African Renaissance&quot; vision. She was President of the 2001 World Conference Against Racism in Durban, and President of the Ministers&#x27; Council at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development. Yet during her tenure, she was criticised for her &quot;quiet diplomacy&quot; in response to the land invasions and political crisis under Zimbabwe&#x27;s ZANU-PF regime. Also during this period, in 2005, Mbeki reportedly offered her the post of Deputy President after Jacob Zuma was fired; she declined.

===2009–2012: Minister of Home Affairs===
In May 2009, Dlamini-Zuma was appointed Minister of Home Affairs in the cabinet of her ex-husband, newly elected President Zuma. She held the role until October 2012, and was lauded for turning around the Department of Home Affairs. During her tenure, the Department – previously viewed as &quot;a hotbed of corruption and incompetence&quot; – received its first unqualified audit in 16 years, as well as an excellence award from the Department of Public Service and Administration. The &quot;Mail &amp; Guardian&quot; attributed the improvement in service delivery to Dlamini-Zuma&#x27;s technocratic efficiency and implementation of internal control measures. However, Home Affairs Director-General Mavuso Msimang, who had arrived at the department before Dlamini-Zuma, said that Dlamini-Zuma&#x27;s predecessor, Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, was primarily responsible for the turnaround.

In 2011, Dlamini-Zuma encountered public outcry when the Dalai Lama was unable to attend Desmond Tutu&#x27;s eightieth birthday party because the Department, hesitant to offend China, failed to issue him a visa. The Department&#x27;s &quot;deliberate delay&quot; was ruled unlawful the following year by the Supreme Court of Appeal, in a judgement that strongly criticised Dlamini-Zuma.

==Chair of the African Union Commission==

In January 2012, while still heading the Ministry of Home Affairs, Dlamini-Zuma contested the position of Chairperson of the African Union (AU) Commission. In doing so, she broke an &quot;unwritten rule&quot; that major African powers do not put forward candidates for AU positions. This angered many AU states, leading to a deadlock in the first election, despite the backing for Dlamini-Zuma&#x27;s presidency provided by the fifteen states comprising the Southern African Development Community. As a consequence of the failure to secure a two-thirds majority of the vote, incumbent Jean Ping&#x27;s term was extended by six months, until a second election on 15 July at the nineteenth session of the AU Assembly elected Dlamini-Zuma to the position. The vote was largely divided along language lines – Francophone states against Anglophone states, with the latter bloc supporting Dlamini-Zuma&#x27;s candidacy. Dlamini-Zuma was Chairperson until 30 January 2017, when she was replaced by Chadian Foreign Minister Moussa Faki.

Dlamini-Zuma was unpopular and disliked among AU officials for her apparent aloofness and absenteeism. She was criticised for filling her advisory office and security detail with South African nationals, and for spending much of her time in South Africa instead of at AU headquarters in Addis Ababa, reinforcing &quot;perceptions of South Africa as an insular nation&quot;. The Agenda 2063 plan spearheaded by Dlamini-Zuma was criticised as &quot;quixotic&quot; and unrealistic. Her leadership as chairperson was considered a disappointing failure, although she was acknowledged for the managerial improvements she made. This included her insistence on professionalism which enhanced the AU&#x27;s reputation; it was taken more seriously as a result of her interventions. She was also an advocate for increased gender representation in the AU which further exacerbated her popularity issues. Furthermore, &quot;[i]n a room of stuffy old men talking about guns and tanks, she brought in concepts like gender, human rights and food security.&quot; She was also credited with the politically courageous drive to suspend Egypt from the AU after Abdel Fattah el-Sisi&#x27;s 2013 military coup, although she did not condemn other authoritarian power grabs elsewhere in Africa.

== Return to government ==

In early 2017, Dlamini-Zuma returned full-time to South Africa from Addis Ababa, and launched a campaign – ultimately unsuccessful – to win the presidency of the ANC . During her campaign, on 21 September 2017, she was sworn back in as a Member of the National Assembly, filling a casual vacancy arising from Pule Mabe&#x27;s resignation. She denied rumours that she would replace Blade Nzimande as Minister of Higher Education in an imminent cabinet reshuffle, describing her return to Parliament as a standard redeployment arranged by the ANC. Earlier that year, there had been similar rumours that Zuma&#x27;s ANC faction was lobbying for her to replace Pravin Gordhan as Minister of Finance.

=== 2018–2019: Minister in the Presidency ===
In February 2018, newly elected President Cyril Ramaphosa appointed Dlamini-Zuma Minister in the Presidency with responsibility for Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation. In this capacity she was the Chairperson of the National Planning Commission and oversaw the implementation of South Africa&#x27;s National Development Plan.

=== 2019–2023: Minister of Cooperative Governance ===
Re-elected following general elections in May 2019, Ramaphosa announced his new cabinet, which saw Dlamini-Zuma moved to the head of the Ministry of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA). Dlamini-Zuma was expected to try to repeat her successes at Home Affairs in order to turn around another famously dysfunctional portfolio. However, observers agreed that, during her first three years in office, she failed to effect such a turnaround, with the financial mismanagement of municipalities remaining a major challenge on the Cooperative Governance front. In 2022, Dlamini-Zuma&#x27;s office prepared a plan to revert the North West province to proper provincial administration after more than three years – since 2018, the province had been under national administration, supervised by COGTA, in terms of an emergency provision in the Constitution for dysfunctional provinces.

==== COVID-19 pandemic ====

Between March 2020 and April 2022, South Africa was officially under a national state of disaster, which allowed the executive to bypass Parliament in regulating the country&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In terms of the Disaster Management Act, Dlamini-Zuma, as COGTA Minister, was responsible for promulgating those regulations; she therefore, unexpectedly, gained significant power over South African policy, leading many commentators to call her a de facto head of state or prime minister. In late April, Dlamini-Zuma announced that a controversial ban on the sale of tobacco would remain in place, contradicting an announcement by President Ramaphosa earlier that week. This apparent U-turn was met with much public comment about Dlamini-Zuma&#x27;s apparently growing power in the cabinet, and necessitated a public statement from Ramaphosa to clarify that both his announcement and its reversal had been &quot;on behalf of, and mandated by, the collective I lead&quot;. COGTA&#x27;s bans on tobacco and alcohol, and other so-called &quot;hard lockdown&quot; regulations, were fiercely unpopular with parts of the population and were subject to several challenges in the courts.

However, some levity was introduced into the situation in May 2020, when South African DJ Max Hurrell released a house song which sampled remarks that Dlamini-Zuma had made during a press briefing about the tobacco ban. The song, entitled &quot;Zol&quot;, featured recordings of Dlamini-Zuma explaining why sharing &quot;zol&quot; – South African slang for roll-up cigarettes usually containing cannabis – conduced to COVID-19 transmission: &quot;When people zol, they put saliva on the paper, and then they share that zol&quot;. The song became a social media meme and the most played song in South Africa on Apple Music, and a video version produced by the Kiffness went viral online. Dlamini-Zuma Tweeted &quot;Who is this Max Hurrell fellow? We just need to talk&quot;, and reached out to the DJ to congratulate him &quot;on entertaining the nation during this difficult period&quot;.

=== 2023–2024: Minister of Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities ===
In a cabinet reshuffle on 6 March 2023, Ramaphosa appointed Dlamini-Zuma as Minister in the Presidency responsible for Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities.

== African National Congress leadership ==
=== 2007: Deputy presidential campaign ===

Dlamini-Zuma first joined the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the ANC in the period between 1991 and 1994, when she was co-opted onto the committee to fill a casual vacancy. She remained on the NEC thereafter: she was democratically elected for the first time at the ANC&#x27;s 49th National Conference in 1994, and was re-elected at subsequent conferences in 1997 and in 2002. Ahead of the next national conference in 2007, some observers viewed her as a possible contender for the ANC&#x27;s presidency and candidacy in national presidential elections. Instead, she was nominated for two other of the so-called Top Six positions in the party: four provinces (those aligned to Mbeki) nominated her as deputy president, while the other five (which backed a Zuma presidency) nominated her as national chairperson. She ultimately stood as deputy president on an Mbeki-aligned slate. Like the other members of that slate, she lost the vote, in her case to Motlanthe. However, she was re-elected to the NEC, and at the 2012 conference she won the most votes of any NEC candidate.

=== 2017: First presidential campaign ===

Ahead of the 54th National Conference of the ANC in December 2017, and having recently returned from her AU position in Addis Ababa, Dlamini-Zuma ran for the ANC presidency. As early as 2016, on some accounts, her supporters were &quot;lobbying openly&quot; for Dlamini-Zuma to replace Zuma as ANC president at the conclusion of the latter&#x27;s term in late 2017. She was endorsed by the ANC Women&#x27;s League in January 2017, and later by the ANC Youth League and the Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans&#x27; Association. Dlamini-Zuma was viewed as media-shy, and only conducted one interview, with ANN7, during her campaign.

Her campaign, under the slogan #WeAreReady, centred on land redistribution, reform at the South African Reserve Bank, and economic transformation generally, a policy package which aligned her closely with the so-called Radical Economic Transformation (RET) faction, a pro-Zuma grouping. Indeed, some analysts suspected that Dlamini-Zuma&#x27;s campaign was a &quot;Trojan horse&quot; for Zuma&#x27;s interests, aiming to secure his continued influence over the party. At the conference, Dlamini-Zuma narrowly lost in a vote against Cyril Ramaphosa, winning 2,261 votes against his 2,440. She was re-elected to the NEC.

=== 2022: Second presidential campaign ===
By September 2022, amid preparations for the 55th National Conference, Dlamini-Zuma was understood to be planning to run again for the ANC presidency. She was nominated for the position by her own ANC branch in eThekwini, Kwa-Zulu Natal, and was again endorsed by former President Zuma.

==Controversies==
===&quot;Rubbish&quot; tweet===
On 7 April 2017, amid national public demonstrations against Zuma&#x27;s presidency, Dlamini-Zuma caused controversy by apparently disparaging the protests as &quot;rubbish&quot;. Her verified Twitter account posted &quot;[Their privilege] is what they are protecting... hence some of us are not part of this rubbish. They must join us for the march for our land they stole...&quot; and deleted the tweet shortly thereafter. Dlamini-Zuma later said the tweet was &quot;fake&quot;.

===Alleged connections to cigarette smugglers===
In 2017, journalist Jacques Pauw claimed in &quot;The President&#x27;s Keepers&quot; that Dlamini-Zuma&#x27;s campaign for the ANC presidency was sponsored partly by businessman Adriano Mazzotti, whose company, Carnilinx, was widely suspected of involvement in cigarette smuggling and other illicit activities. Mazzotti allegedly financed the campaign&#x27;s merchandise. In subsequent weeks, the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; threw into question Mazzotti&#x27;s rebuttal – that he had only met Dlamini-Zuma once, briefly – by publishing Instagram photographs of the pair together on two separate occasions. Both Mazzotti and, through her spokesman, Dlamini-Zuma denied that they had any &quot;direct or substantive relationship&quot;. Johann van Loggerenberg claimed in his 2019 book, &quot;Tobacco Wars&quot;, that Mazzotti had admitted to assisting the campaign in acquiring merchandise – but through personal connections rather than by paying for the merchandise directly.

The allegations were revived in 2020, as commentators questioned whether Dlamini-Zuma was pursuing the government&#x27;s tobacco ban because of her alleged connections to tobacco smugglers, who would benefit from the ban. Such speculation drew not only on the Mazzotti allegations, but also on the ties of Edward Zuma, Dlamini-Zuma&#x27;s former stepson, to Amalgamated Tobacco Manufacturers, a cheap cigarette manufacturer also suspected of illicit activity. Dlamini-Zuma maintained that the ban was based on health concerns only.

==Personal life==
Dlamini-Zuma was married to former President Jacob Zuma between 1982 and 1998. They had four daughters together: Msholozi (born 1982); Gugulethu Zuma-Ncube (born 1984), who married the son of Zimbabwean politician Welshman Ncube; Nokuthula Nomaqhawe (born 1987); and Thuthukile (born 1989), who was controversially appointed Chief of Staff in the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services in 2014. Dlamini-Zuma divorced Zuma in June 1998 over irreconcilable differences.

Dlamini-Zuma&#x27;s younger sister, Hlobisile, is also an ANC member and serves as Member of the Kwa-Zulu Natal Legislature.

==Honours==

<doc id="1321529" wikidata="Q468622" url="?curid=1321529" title="Saint Publius">
<text>Saint Publius (; ) was a 1st century Christian bishop and saint. He is considered the first Bishop of Malta and one of the first Bishops of Athens. 

Publius is Malta&#x27;s first canonised saint, who is described in the Book of Acts as the &#x27;chief&#x27; or prince of the island (). According to Maltese Christian tradition, Publius&#x27; conversion led to Malta being the first Christian nation in the West. 

He is venerated as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic Church, with feast days on 13 March and 22 January respectively.

==History and tradition==
According to Christian tradition, it was Publius who received Paul the Apostle during his shipwreck on the island as recounted in the Acts of the Apostles. According to the Acts of the Apostles, Paul cured Publius&#x27; dysentery-afflicted father.

:&quot;In the vicinity of that place were lands belonging to a man named Publius, the chief of the island. He welcomed us and received us cordially as his guests for three days. It so happened that the father of Publius was sick with a fever and dysentery. Paul visited him and, after praying, laid his hands on him and healed him. After this had taken place, the rest of the sick on the island came to Paul and were cured. They paid us great honor and when we eventually set sail they brought us the provisions we needed.&quot; — Acts 28:7–10, New American Bible

He was martyred around 125, during the persecution of Emperor Hadrian.

== Veneration ==
His feast is celebrated on 22 January in the Roman Catholic Church, which places him as the successor of Dionysius the Areopagite, dating his martyrdom to .

Apart from being patron saint of Floriana, Publius is also one of the three patron saints of Malta, along with St. Paul the Apostle and St. Agatha of Sicily.

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, however, his feast day is observed on 13 March, and according to an epistle of Dionysius, Bishop of Corinth, he is placed as the successor of Narcissus of Athens, dating his martyrdom to the period of the persecution under Marcus Aurelius ().

<doc id="1321541" wikidata="Q381837" url="?curid=1321541" title="Ramon Berenguer V, Count of Provence">
<text>Ramon Berenguer IV or V (; 1198 – 19 August 1245) was a member of the House of Barcelona who ruled as count of Provence and Forcalquier. He was the first count of Provence to live in the county in more than one hundred years. During the minority of a previous count in 1144–1161, the regency was exercised by Ramon Berenguer IV de Barcelona, who is sometimes counted among the counts of Provence, which has led to varied numbering of the counts of Provence named Ramon Berenguer. This Ramon Berenguer was the fourth of his name to be a reigning count of Provence.

==Family==
Ramon Berenguer was the son of Alfonso II, Count of Provence, and Garsenda, Countess of Forcalquier. After his father&#x27;s death (1209), Ramon&#x27;s mother sent him to the Templar castle of Monzón in Aragon. He was accompanied by his cousin James, whose life was also under threat. He left Monzon in 1216 to claim his inheritance, which included the county of Forcalquier—inherited from his mother.

On 5 June 1219, Ramon Berenguer married Beatrice of Savoy, daughter of Thomas, Count of Savoy. She was a shrewd and politically astute woman, whose beauty was likened by Matthew Paris to that of a second Niobe. The wedding also provided the 21-year-old Ramon with a powerful father-in-law to aid him in establishing his authority and protecting his interests. They had:

* stillborn son (1220)
* stillborn son (1220)
* Margaret of Provence (1221–1295), wife of Louis IX, King of France
* Eleanor of Provence (1223–1291), wife of Henry III, King of England
* Sanchia of Provence (1225–1261), wife of Richard, King of the Romans, brother of the King of England
* Beatrice of Provence (1229–1267), wife of Charles I, King of Sicily, brother of the King of France

== Rule ==
Ramon Berenguer and his wife were known for their support of troubadors, always having some around the court. He was known for his generosity, though his income did not always keep up. He wrote laws prohibiting nobles from performing menial work, such as farming or heavy labour.

Ramon Berenguer had many border disputes with his neighbours, the counts of Toulouse. In 1226, Ramon began to reassert his right to rule in Marseille. The citizens there initially sought the help of Ramon&#x27;s father-in-law Thomas, Count of Savoy in his role as imperial vicar. However, they later sought the help of Raymond VII, Count of Toulouse.

In 1228, Ramon Berenguer supported his father-in-law in a double-sided conflict against Turin and Guigues VI of Viennois. This small war was one of many rounds intended to more firmly establish control over trade from Italy into France, and Provence included several key routes.

While the Albigensian Crusade worked in his favour against Toulouse, Ramon Berenguer was concerned that its resolution in the Treaty of Paris left him in a precarious position. Raymond turned his troops from fighting France to attempting to claim lands from Provence. When Blanche of Castile sent her knight to both Toulouse and Provence in 1233, Ramon Berenguer entertained him lavishly, and the knight left well impressed by both the count and his eldest daughter, Margaret. Soon after, Blanche negotiated the marriage between Margaret and her son, Louis, with a dowry of ten thousand silver marks. Ramon Berenguer had to get contributions from allies for a portion, and had to pledge several of his castles to cover the rest. Ramon Berenguer and Beatrice travelled with their daughter to Lyon in 1234 to sign the marriage treaty, and then Margaret was escorted to her wedding in Sens by her uncles William and Thomas of Savoy.

Shortly after, William began negotiating on Ramon Berenguer&#x27;s behalf with Henry III of England to marry his daughter Eleanor. Henry sent his own knight to Provence early in 1235, and again Ramon Berenguer and his family entertained him lavishly. Henry wrote to William on 22 June that he was very interested, and sent a delegation to negotiate the marriage in October. Henry was seeking a dowry of up to twenty thousand silver marks to help offset the dowry he had just paid for his sister, Isabella. However, he had drafted seven different versions of the marriage contract, with different amounts for the dowry, the lowest being zero. Ramon Berenguer shrewdly negotiated for that option, offering as consolation a promise to leave her ten thousand marks in his last will.

In 1238, Ramon Berenguer joined his brother-in-law Amadeus IV at the court of Emperor Frederick II in Turin. Frederick was gathering forces to assert more control in Italy. Raymond VII of Toulouse was also summoned, and all were expected to work together in the war.

In January 1244, Pope Innocent IV decreed that no one but the pope could excommunicate Ramon Berenguer. In 1245, Ramon Berenguer sent representatives to the First Council of Lyon, to discuss crusades and the excommunication of Frederick.

Ramon Berenguer died in August 1245 in Aix-en-Provence, leaving the county to his youngest daughter, Beatrice.

==Death and legacy==

Ramon Berenguer V died in Aix-en-Provence. At least two &quot;planhs&quot; (Occitan funeral laments) of uncertain authorship (one possibly by Aimeric de Peguilhan and one falsely attributed to Rigaut de Berbezilh) were written in his honour.

Giovanni Villani in his &quot;Nuova Cronica&quot; said:
Count Raymond was a lord of gentle lineage, and kin to them of the house of Aragon, and to the family of the count of Toulouse, By inheritance Provence, this side of the Rhone, was his; a wise and courteous lord was he, and of noble state and virtuous, and in his time did honourable deeds, and to his court came all gentle persons of Provence and of France and of Catalonia, by reason of his courtesy and noble estate, and he made many Provençal coblas and canzoni of great worth.

The first season of Australia&#x27;s Brainiest Kid was produced in May 2004, airing on the Seven Network on Sundays, starting 28 November 2004. It was hosted by Anna Coren. It was publicised through Australian primary schools, with children sitting an online test, followed by a selection of them taking a supervised written test. Of those that scored highly on these written tests, some of the highest scoring children appeared on the show as contestants. A second season was produced in 2005, and was broadcast on Network Ten at 6:30 pm on Sundays, starting 25 September 2005. It was hosted by Ten News newsreader Sandra Sully and co-hosted by Samuel Shaed.

The second season of &quot;Australia&#x27;s Brainiest Kid&quot; was followed by a series of specials on Network Ten featuring celebrities, reality TV contestants and sports stars, under the Australia&#x27;s Brainiest Specials title. After the broadcast of the specials no further series have been commissioned.

== &quot;Australia&#x27;s Brainiest Kid&quot; ==
The format of &quot;Australia&#x27;s Brainiest Kid&quot; went unchanged during its transition from Seven Network to Network Ten, except for the number of rounds and contestants. In Seven Network&#x27;s version, there were 4 heats and a final, and 12 children per show; in Network Ten&#x27;s version, there were 7 heats and a final, and 9 children per show.

=== Season 1 ===
The first season aired on the Seven Network in 2004. Over 5000 children sat the online test, 800 were selected to sit the supervised test. All of them won copies of the 2004 CD-ROM edition of &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;.

Everybody in the third round went on to the final; they were competing for an Apple Computer iBook. The winner of the first series final, Aaron Chong, won the title of &quot;Australia&#x27;s Brainiest Kid&quot; and A$20,000 to be held in trust until he turns 18.

=== Season 2 ===
The second season aired on Network Ten in 2005. 12,000 children sat the online test for the second season of &quot;Australia&#x27;s Brainiest Kid&quot;, aired on Network Ten. Some of them were selected to sit the supervised test. The seven winners of the heats, plus two others who made it into the final rounds of the heats played in the final. This series had considerably more children participating, mainly due to the popularity of the first series.

All contestants received a Mathemagic computer tutor from the Australian Institute of Mathematics as a &quot;participation&quot; prize. The heat winners received ASUS laptops. The winner of the second series final, William Xi, won the title of &quot;Australia&#x27;s Brainiest Kid&quot; and a trust fund worth A$20,000 that he cannot touch before his 18th birthday.

Commentators noted that children of Asian descent dominated the preliminary televised rounds during this series. &quot;The Chaser&#x27;s War on Everything&quot; parodied the series with an advertisement for &quot;Australia&#x27;s Brainiest Non-Asian Kid,&quot; in which a Caucasian contestant is unable to answer &quot;What&#x27;s two plus three?&quot; correctly. The parody ended with promos for dozens of supposed upcoming &quot;Australia&#x27;s Brainiest&quot; episodes featuring numerous animals, inanimate objects, and three subliminal messages.

<text>Chris Farlowe (born John Henry Deighton, 13 October 1940) is an English rock, blues and soul singer. He is best known for his hit single &quot;Out of Time&quot; written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, which rose to No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart in 1966, and his association with bands Atomic Rooster, the Thunderbirds and Colosseum. Outside his music career, Farlowe collects war memorabilia.

== Early life ==
Farlowe was born in Islington, North London. His mother sang and played piano at clubs. He is the nephew of Len Deighton. Farlowe was an apprentice carpenter in Holloway, London before he was a professional singer. John Henry Deighton became Chris Farlowe, after taking the surname from American guitarist Tal Farlow. 

== Career ==
His musical career began with a skiffle group, the John Henry Skiffle Group, in 1957, before he joined the Johnny Burns Rhythm and Blues Quartet in 1958. The John Henry Skiffle Group won a local talent show. He met guitarist Bob Taylor in 1959 and, through Taylor, joined the Thunderbirds, who went on to record five singles for the Columbia label. On Island&#x27;s Sue label, he released a version of &quot;Stormy Monday Blues&quot; under the pseudonym Little Joe Cook (a name also used by an American singer), which perpetuated the myth that he was a black singer.

Farlowe moved to Andrew Loog Oldham&#x27;s Immediate label and recorded eleven singles, five of which were cover versions of Rolling Stones songs: &quot;Paint It Black&quot;, &quot;Think&quot;, &quot;Ride On, Baby&quot;, &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot;, and &quot;Out of Time&quot;, which reached No. 1 (1966) in the UK Singles Chart. He recorded four more singles, the best known of which are Mike d&#x27;Abo&#x27;s &quot;Handbags and Gladrags&quot;, and &quot;My Way of Giving&quot;, a cover of a Small Faces album track written by Steve Marriott and Ronnie Lane.

Farlowe was performing at a club in 1966, when Otis Redding approached him, and asked him to join him on an episode of Ready Steady Go! with Eric Burdon.

He began an association with the jazz rock group Colosseum in September 1970, recording a live album and two studio albums including &quot;Daughter of Time&quot; (1970). Farlowe left a year later, but since Colosseum&#x27;s reunion in 1994 he appeared on all their albums and tours with them to the present. In February 1972 he joined Atomic Rooster, and is featured on the albums &quot;Made in England&quot; (1972) and &quot;Nice &#x27;n&#x27; Greasy&quot; (1973).

In 1978 Farlowe collaborated on two BBC Birmingham productions for which his former Colosseum bandmate Dave Greenslade wrote the theme music. First, in the second series of &quot;Gangsters&quot;, Farlowe sang the theme song. Farlowe and Greenslade then provided the music and Farlowe played the part of Benny opposite Sonja Kristina in the rock opera &quot;Curriculee Curricula&quot;. The production was first shown on BBC Two and shot in its entirety on video at the University of Birmingham campus, with Magnus Magnusson as the narrator.

Farlowe sang on two tracks from Jimmy Page&#x27;s &quot;Death Wish II&quot; soundtrack (1982), as well as the tracks &quot;Hummingbird&quot;, &quot;Prison Blues&quot; and &quot;Blues Anthem&quot; on Page&#x27;s album &quot;Outrider&quot; (1988). He toured for a long time with Hamburg Blues Band, mainly in Germany. Since 1999, Farlowe has appeared on stage a number of times alongside Van Morrison.
In 2009, Farlowe toured as a featured artist with Maggie Bell and Bobby Tench as part of the &quot;Maximum Rhythm and Blues&quot; tour of 32 UK theatres. On 30 July 2016, Farlowe appeared at Wembley Arena, performing his 1966 hit &quot;Out of Time&quot; as part of a show marking the 50th anniversary of the England football team&#x27;s victory in the 1966 FIFA World Cup Final.

== Personal life ==
Farlowe also collects war memorabilia, and once had a shop that sold Nazi uniforms, which had caused controversy at the time. An interest for his hobby first started when in Hamburg, he noticed and bought an Iron Cross on for sale in a Junk shop.

Farlowe has never been married or had children, but nearly got married twice.

<text>Vaisakhi, also known as Baisakhi, marks the first day of the month of Vaisakh and is traditionally celebrated annually on 13 April and sometimes 14 April.
It is seen as a spring harvest celebration primarily in Punjab and Northern India.
Whilst it is culturally significant as a festival of harvest, in many parts of India, Vaisakhi is also the date for the Indian Solar New Year. 

For Sikhs, in addition to its significance as the harvest festival, during which Sikhs hold kirtans, visit local gurdwaras, community fairs, hold &quot;nagar kirtan&quot; processions, raise the Nishan Sahib flag, and gather to socialize and share festive foods, Vaisakhi observes major events in the history of Sikhism and the Indian subcontinent that happened in the Punjab region. Vaisakhi as a major Sikh festival marks the birth of the Khalsa order by Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Guru of Sikhism, on 13 April 1699. Later, Ranjit Singh was proclaimed as Maharaja of the Sikh Empire on 12 April 1801 (to coincide with Vaisakhi), creating a unified political state.

Vaisakhi was also the day when Bengal Army officer Reginald Dyer ordered his troops to shoot into a protesting crowd in Amritsar, an event which would come to be known the Jallianwala Bagh massacre; the massacre proved influential to the history of the Indian independence movement.

This holiday is observed by Hindus and is known by various regional names in other parts of India. For many Hindu communities, the festival is an occasion to ritually bathe in sacred rivers such as Ganges, Jhelum, and Kaveri, visit temples, meet friends, take part in other festivities, and perform a mandatory &quot;daan&quot; (charity) especially of hand fans, water pitchers and seasonal fruits. Community fairs are held at Hindu pilgrimage sites. In many areas, processions of temple deities are taken out. The holiday also marks the worship and propitiation of various deities, such as Durga in Himachal Pradesh, Surya in Bihar, and Vishnu in southern India. Although Vaisakhi began as a grain harvest festival for Hindus and its observance predates the creation of Sikhism, it gained historical association with the Sikhs following the inauguration of the Khalsa.

==Date==
Vaisakhi is observed on the 13 or 14 April every year in the 21st century. However, in 1801 AD, it fell on 11 April. This is because the date of Vaisakhi and other Sankrantis keeps changing slowly over years. Vaisakhi would fall on 29 April in Year 2999. The festival coincides with other new year festivals celebrated on the first day of Vaisakh in other regions of the Indian Subcontinent such as Puthandu, Pohela Boishakh, Bohag Bihu, and Vishu.

==Etymology and pronunciation==
The word Vaisakhi or Baisakhi is an Apabhraṃśa form evolved from the word Vaishākhī (वैशाखी), derived from the name of the Indian month of Vaishakha. There is no distinction between sounds &#x27;sha&#x27; (श) &amp; &#x27;sa&#x27; (स) and between &#x27;va&#x27; (व) &amp; &#x27;ba&#x27; (ब) in Prakrit &amp; Apbhramsa. Hence the name, Vaisakhi or Baisakhi. Vaisakhi which is observed on Sankranti of Vaisakh (Vaishakh) month literally means &#x27;related to Vaisakh month&#x27;, which in turn is derived from the name of a Nakshatra known as Vishakha. In Punjab region, the word &quot;Vaisakhi&quot; is common, but in the Dogra regions, and the Doabi and Malwai dialects of Punjab, speakers often substitute a &quot;B&quot; for a &quot;V&quot;, so it is known as Baisakhi or Basakhi; also people in Jammu call it Basoa.

== Hinduism ==

For most of the Hindus, the first day of Vaisakh marks the traditional solar new year, in Assam, Bengal, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Kerala, Odisha, Punjab Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Uttrakhand and other parts of India. However, this is not the universal new year for all Hindus. For some, such as those in and near Gujarat, the new year festivities coincide with the five-day Diwali festival. For others, the new year falls on Cheti Chand, Gudi Padwa and Ugadi which falls a few weeks earlier. The harvest is complete and crops ready to sell, representing a time of plenty for the farmers. Fairs and special thanksgiving pujas (prayers) are common in the Hindu tradition. It is available in the Vanis of the saints that in Satlok, the Vaisakhi-like atmosphere always remains there.

It is regionally known by many names among the Hindus, though the festivities and its significance is similar. It is celebrated by Hindus bathing in sacred rivers, as they believe that river goddess Ganges descended to earth on Vaisakhi from Svarga. Some rivers considered particularly sacred include the Ganges, Jhelum and Kaveri. Hindus visit temples, meet friends and party over festive foods.

According to Ganhar (1975), &quot;Bhangra dances are a special feature of Baisakhi celebrations but bhangra is an importation from the Punjab and is more secular than religious&quot;.

The occasion is marked by numerous fairs and people come by the thousands to celebrate Vaisakhi. For example, Airwan in Kathua is known for Vaisakhi fair attended by 10,000 people as per Census 1961.

The three primary types of Bihu are Rongali Bihu, Kongali Bihu, and Bhogali Bihu. Each festival historically recognizes a different agricultural cycle of the paddy crops. During Rangali Bihu there are 7 pinnacle phases: &#x27;Chot&#x27;, &#x27;Raati&#x27;, &#x27;Goru&#x27;, &#x27;Manuh&#x27;, &#x27;Kutum&#x27;, &#x27;Mela&#x27; and &#x27;Chera&#x27;.

They prepare a liquid mixture of jaggery, mango, pepper and other ingredients which is called Pana (ପଣା). An earthen pot with a small hole and a grass (କୁୁଶ) within the hole at the bottom is hung over the Tulasi (ତୁୁୁଳସୀ ଚଉରା). The pot is filled with water daily which acts as a drip to protect the sacred plant from the summer heat.

====Poyla Boishakh====
Poyla Baishakh is the first day of the Bengali calendar and is celebrated on 14 April every year in the states of West Bengal, Tripura, Jharkhand and Assam (Barak Valley) by Bengali Hindus.

Some historians attribute the Bengali calendar to the 7th-century king Shashanka. The term &quot;Bangabda&quot; (Bangla year) is found too in two Shiva temples many centuries older than Akbar era, suggesting that Bengali calendar existed before Akbar&#x27;s time. Various dynasties whose territories extended into Bengal, prior to the 13th-century, used the Vikram Samvat. Buddhist texts and inscriptions created in the Pala Empire era mention &quot;Vikrama&quot; and the months such as Ashvin, a system found in Sanskrit texts elsewhere in ancient and medieval Indian subcontinent.

== Sikhism ==

Vaisakhi (Punjabi: ਵੈਸਾਖੀ , &quot;vaisākhī&quot;, is also known as &quot;Baisākhī&quot;), is a very important day for Sikhs and one of the most colourful events in the Sikh calendar. It occurs during mid-April every year and traditionally in Punjab, the festival corresponds with the first harvesting of the crops for the year. Historically, the festival has been a very joyous occasion and a time for celebration. However, since 1699, it has marked the very significant religious event of the creation of the Khalsa Panth.

Vaisakhi falls on the first day of the Vaisakh month and marks the sun&#x27;s entry to the Mesha Rasi (Mesha Sankranti) marking the solar transition to Aries. The day is also described as a sacred festival for Sikhs in India as it marks the birth of the Khalsa.

The significance of Vaisakhi as a Sikh religious festival started after the execution of Guru Tegh Bahadur for refusing to convert to Islam under the orders of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. This triggered the ascension of Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Guru of Sikhism, who subsequently inaugurated the Khalsa on Vaisakhi of 1699. The increased persecution of Sikhs by Mughal authorities followed a period of increasing strength of the Sikh movement in the Malwa region of Punjab during the period of Guru Tegh Bahadur, which would lead to his execution and the resulting foundation of the Khalsa by Guru Gobind Singh, to defend religious freedoms. This gave Vaisakhi the added dimension of being observed as a celebration of the formation of the Khalsa, and is also known as Khalsa Sirjana Divas or Khalsa Sajna Divas. The Birth of the Khalsa Panth was on 30 March 1699.

Later, Ranjit Singh was proclaimed as Maharaja of the Sikh Empire on 12 April 1801 (to coincide with Vaisakhi), creating a unified political state, with Sahib Singh Bedi, a descendant of Guru Nanak, conducting the coronation.

Vaisakhi is celebrated in much the same way as Gurpurab, or a Guru&#x27;s birthday anniversary, with gurdwaras being decorated and attended by Sikhs who listen to &quot;kirtan&quot; and religious discourses there. Many Sikhs also choose to be inducted into the Khalsa order on this day. After the prayers, &quot;karah parshad&quot; is then served to the congregation, and the function ends with a &quot;langar&quot;, or community lunch. The festival is marked with a &quot;nagar kirtan&quot; street procession headed by a group of &quot;Panj Pyare&quot; representatives, and music, singing, and chanting scriptures are part of the celebration.

===Punjab===

Fairs and melas are held in many places in Punjab to celebrate the formation of the Khalsa. According to Dogra and Dogra (2003), &quot;an annual fair is held at Takht Kesgarh Sahib on Baisakhi day&quot;. A procession is lead through the city of Anandpur to mark the occasion. Other important places where large gatherings take place are Harmandar Sahib, Amritsar and Takht Sri Damdama Sahib, Talwandi Sabo. A special celebration takes place at Talwandi Sabo (where Guru Gobind Singh stayed for nine months and completed the recompilation of the Guru Granth Sahib), in the Gurudwara at Anandpur Sahib the birthplace of the Khalsa, and at the Golden Temple in Amritsar.

Vaisakhi is a harvest festival for people of Northern India. Chander and Dogra (2003) state that in Punjab, Vaisakhi marks the ripening of the rabi harvest. According to Dhillon (2015), in Punjab, this day is observed as a thanksgiving day by farmers whereby farmers pay their tribute, thanking God for the abundant harvest and also praying for future prosperity. The harvest festival is celebrated by Hindus and Sikhs. In the Punjab, historically, during the early 20th century, Vaisakhi was a sacred day for Hindus and Sikhs and a secular festival for all Muslims and Christians. In modern times, sometimes Christians in Punjab participate in Baisakhi celebrations along with Hindus and Sikhs. The harvest festival is also characterized by the folk dance, Bhangra which traditionally is a harvest dance.

Aawat pauni is a tradition associated with harvesting in the Punjab, which involves people getting together to harvest the wheat. 
===Himachal Pradesh===
A large number of Sikhs visit Paonta Sahib on the festival of Vaisakhi. According to Sahi (1999), Paonta Sahib &quot;was the abode of Guru Gobind Singh Ji for a couple of years.&quot; Paanta Sahib Gurdwara is in Sirmaur district in Himachal Pradesh. The site is located near the river Yamuna. The tricentenary celebrations to mark the birth of the Khalsa were started from Paanta Sahib Gurdwara in 1999.
===Jammu===

Gurdwara Dera Nangali Sahib in Jammu was established in 1803. The Gurdwara is situated in the Poonch district of Jammu. An annual gathering takes place at the gurdwara on the on Baisakhi when many people participate in the day-long function of Baisakhi. Dera Nangali Sahib is known as a centre for Sikhism in Jammu. The other important gurdwara is the Dera Baba Banda which is dedicated to Banda Bahadur. The gurdwara is located near Reasi. Baisakhi celebrations take place at this Dera.
===Kashmir===

Sikhs in Kashmir celebrate Vaisakhi as a religious festival to mark the foundation of the Khalsa. Unlike in the North Indian plains where Vaisalhi is also associated with harvesting, Sikhs in Kashmir mark the day when Guru Gobind Singh baptised the Panj Pyare. Bajan Keertans are held in all gurdwaras in Kashmir. However, the main celebration takes place at Chatti Pathshahi Gurdwara in Rainawari. Sikhs will visit friends and family in Vaisakhi. People will wear special clothes and prepare special food to mark the festival. Sikhs will also visit the gardens and markets. The mode of celebration is believed to be different to the way the festival is celebrated elsewhere.
===Nihang===

The Nihang () or Akali (lit. &quot;the immortals&quot;) is an armed Sikh warrior order originating in the Indian subcontinent. Nihang are believed to have originated either from Fateh Singh and the attire he wore or from the &quot;Akali Dal&quot; (lit. Army of the Immortal) started by Guru Hargobind. Early Sikh military history was dominated by the Nihang, known for their victories where they were heavily outnumbered. Traditionally known for their bravery and ruthlessness in the battlefield, the Nihang once formed the irregular guerrilla squads of the armed forces of the Sikh Empire, the Sikh Khalsa Army.

Nihangs mark Vaisakhi in their own unique manner. They will engage in martial arts and participate in Gatkas. They will also exhibit displays of horsemanship. According to Singh and Fenech (2014), Nihangs will move to the city of Amritsar on Vaisakhi day.
==Sikh celebrations outside India==
===Pakistan===
Pakistan has many sites that are of historic importance to the Sikh faith, such as the birthplace of Guru Nanak. These sites attract pilgrims from India and abroad every year on Vaisakhi. Pakistan used to have many more Sikhs, but a vast majority moved to India during the 1947 India-Pakistan partition. Contemporary Pakistan has about 20,000 Sikhs in a total population of about 200 million Pakistanis, or about 0.01%. These Sikhs, and thousands more who arrive from other parts of the world for pilgrimage, observe Vaisakhi in Western Punjab (Pakistan) with festivities centered on the Panja Sahib complex in Hasan Abdal, Gurudwaras in Nankana Sahib, and in various historical sites in Lahore.

In western Punjab, Punjabi Muslims used to celebrate Baisakhi as a harvest festival, but Islamist policies of Zia-ul-Haq led to the ending of its observance, becoming solely viewed as a Sikh celebration rather than a pan-Punjabi one. According to Aziz-ud-din Ahmed, Lahore used to have Baisakhi Mela after the harvesting of the wheat crop in April. However, adds Ahmed, the city started losing its cultural vibrancy in 1970s after Zia-ul-Haq came to power, and in recent years &quot;the Pakistan Muslim League (N) government in Punjab banned kite flying through an official edict more under the pressure of those who want a puritanical version of Islam to be practiced in the name of religion than anything else&quot;. Unlike the Indian state of Punjab that recognizes the Vaisakhi Sikh festival as an official holiday, the festival is not an official holiday in Punjab or Sindh provinces of Pakistan as Sikhs constitute a very small number in terms of population.

In April 2010, the Federal Ministry of Minorities in Pakistan announced that Baisakhi would be officially recognized as a holiday. The Pakistani government welcomes Sikh pilgrims from India to celebrate Baisakhi within its borders.

===Canada===
====British Columbia====
In the Province of British Columbia, large, local Sikh communities in the cities of Vancouver, Abbotsford, and Surrey hold their annual Vaisakhi celebrations in April, which include two Nagar Kirtan (parades).

In Vancouver, the parade was first held in 1979 and is the largest annual single-day festival in the city. The parade starts at Ross Street Temple and makes its way through the traditional Punjabi Market in the Sunset neighbourhood of South Vancouver, attracting up to 300,000 people.

One week later, the festival in Surrey is one of the largest such celebrations outside of India, having attracted over 200,000 people in 2014, over 350,000 in 2015, and approached 400,000 in 2016. The 2017 attendance in Surrey reportedly topped 400,000, causing organizers to consider future distribution of the festival over several days and local cities, particularly in areas of economic disadvantage which would benefit from the generous charitable efforts seen during Vaisakhi celebrations. Record attendance was again experienced in April 2018 in the 20th annual Surrey Vaisakhi parade, with the RCMP officially estimating the crowd at over half a million people in a city with a 2016 census population of 517,887. Starting at the Gurdwara Dashmesh Darbar Temple (12885 85th Avenue in Surrey), the parade features a variety of floats, community groups, free food, live music and dancers and performers, and travels along 124th Street, turns left onto 75th Avenue, continues on 76th Avenue, onto 128th Street, then back to the Temple.

Kelowna&#x27;s annual Vaisakhi parade is held a week after Surrey&#x27;s parade each year and begins and ends at the Sikh Temple on Rutland Road.

Victoria&#x27;s all-day Vaisakhi celebration features a parade that begins and ends at Gurdwara Singh Sabha, 470 Cecelia Road. The 2018 celebrations on 29 April would be the first held in Victoria in over 100 years.

====Ontario====
In the Province of Ontario, the Toronto Vaisakhi Parade is held in April, starting at the Canadian National Exhibition grounds and traveling east to Toronto City Hall, finishing almost three hours later. Following the parade, dignitaries address the gathering until late afternoon.

In the city of Brampton, the Gurudwara Sikh Sangat temple and Gobind Sarvar Gurmat School hold Vaisakhi cultural events such as yoga, pagh (turban) tying, storytelling, and food fairs.

In the city of Malton, a three-hour Nagar Kirtan parade winds from Morning Star, Goreway, Derry Rd, &amp; Airport Rd to Malton Gurdwara Sahib.

====Prairies====
In the Province of Alberta, the Edmonton Vaisakhi parade is held in May and travels between the Gurdwara Singh Sabha (4504 Millwoods Road S) &amp; Gurdwara Millwoods (2606 Millwoods Road E) temples.

In the Province of Saskatchewan, the Saskatoon Vaisakhi parade is held in May, starting and ending at the Gurudwara Sahib Temple at 331 Lowe Road.

====Atlantic====
In the Province of Nova Scotia, the Halifax-based Maritime Sikh Society holds Vaisakhi celebrations in April featuring Shabad Kirtan performed by professional ragis (musicians).

===United Kingdom===
The United Kingdom has a large Sikh community originating from the Indian sub-continent, East Africa and Afghanistan. The largest concentrations of Sikhs in the UK are to be found in the West Midlands (especially Birmingham and Wolverhampton) and London. The Southall Nagar Kirtan is held on a Sunday a week or two before Vaisakhi. The Birmingham Nagar Kirtan is held in late April in association with Birmingham City Council, and is an annual event attracting thousands of people which commences with two separate nagar kirtans setting off from gurdwaras in the city and culminating in the Vaisakhi Mela at Handsworth Park.

===United States===
Amongst Sikh populations in the United States, there is usually a parade commemorating the Vaisakhi celebration. In Manhattan, New York City people come out to do &quot;Seva&quot; (selfless service) such as giving out free food, and completing any other labor that needs to be done. In Los Angeles, California, the local Sikh community consisting of many gurdwaras holds a full day Kirtan (spiritual music) program followed by a parade.

===Malaysia===
The Sikh community, a subgroup of the Malaysian Indian ethnic minority race, is an ethnoreligious minority in Malaysia, which is why Vaisakhi is not a public holiday. However, in line with the government&#x27;s efforts to promote integration among the country&#x27;s different ethnic and religious groups, has announced that beginning 2013, all government servants from the Sikh Malaysian Indian community will be given a day off on Vaisakhi Day. Vaisakhi &#x27;open houses&#x27; are also held across the country during the day of the festival, or the closest weekend to it.

== Buddhism ==

The new year falls on or about the same day every year for many Buddhist communities in parts of South and Southeast Asia. This is likely an influence of their shared culture in the 1st millennium CE. Some examples include:
* &quot;Sangken&quot; in Arunachal Pradesh and parts of Assam, India
* &quot;Aluth Avuruthu&quot; in Sri Lanka.
* &quot;Chol Chnam Thmey&quot; in Cambodia
* &quot;Pi Mai&quot; in Laos
* &quot;Songkran&quot; in Thailand
* &quot;Thingyan&quot; in Myanmar
* &quot;Water-Sprinkling Festival&quot;, celebrated by the Dai people in Sipsongpanna in Yunnan, China

==As a harvest festival==
Vaisakhi is a harvest festival for people of Northern India. Chander and Dogra (2003) state that in Punjab, Vaisakhi marks the ripening of the rabi harvest. Vaisakhi, the Hindu Solar new year, also marks the Nepalese, Punjabi and Bengali New year. Fairs or &quot;Melas&quot; (fair) are held in many parts of North India to mark the new year and the harvesting season. Vaisakhi fairs take place in various places, including Jammu City, Kathua, Udhampur, Reasi and Samba, in the Pinjore complex near Chandigarh, in Himachal Pradesh cities of Rewalsar, Shimla, Mandi and Prashar Lakes. According to Ann Louise Wood, Vaisakhi is a festival that is celebrated by the Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims of Punjab.

<doc id="1321665" wikidata="Q26759674" url="?curid=1321665" title="Anambas Islands Regency">
<text>Anambas Islands Regency () is an island regency in the Riau Islands Province, Indonesia, located in the Natuna Sea. The regency consists of 255 islands, including five outer islands that are important for Indonesia&#x27;s sovereignty boundaries, namely: Tokong Berlayar Island, Tokong Nanas Island, Mangkai Island, Damar Island, and Malangbiru Island. Anambas Islands Regency located northeast of Batam Island in the Natuna Sea between the Malaysian Peninsula to the west and the island of Borneo to the east. Geographically part of the Tudjuh Archipelago. This island regency covers a land area of approximately spread over an area of approximately 46,664 km² of water. The regency had a population of around 37,411 at the 2010 Census. and 47,402 at the 2020 Census; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 50,140. The administrative centre is at Tarempa on Siantan Island.

== Islands ==

=== Main islands ===
The islands fall into two main groups. The eastern group includes the principal island of Siantan (on which is situated the main town of Tarempa) and Bajau. Further north lie the islands of Matak and Mubur, together with a number of small islands. The western group is centred on the island of Jemaja (on which is situated the only other town of Letung), with a number of smaller islands to its north. Between these two main groups lie a number of smaller islands, of which Telaga Island is the largest, while Airabu Island lies due south of Siantan.

=== Matak island ===
The Anambas archipelago contains a large reserve of natural gas that is exported to countries such as Singapore and Malaysia. The island of Matak is the main base for oil exploration.

=== Pulau Bawah ===
Pulau Bawah, formerly known as Leeward island, is a clustered archipelago of six islands accessed by seaplane. It is located about 150 nautical miles northeast of Singapore and Batam, is a cluster of islets that collectively surround three lagoons, each of which suitable for snorkelling, scubadiving and coral beach activities. CNN rates the Anambas Islands are one of Southeast Asia&#x27;s most spectacular coastal spots, with good snorkelling and diving spots, and Pulau Bawah in particular has good tourism potential.

Whilst the majority of the population generates their income from fishing and fishing-related industries, tourism has been gaining traction.

== Diving ==
The shipwrecked vessels &quot;Seven Skies&quot; and &quot;Igara&quot; attract a variety of indigenous marine life and offer diving opportunities.

==Administrative districts==
At the 2010 Census, the Regency was divided into seven districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;), but three additional districts have subsequently been created by splitting of two of the existing districts - Jemaja Barat from Jemaja District, and Siantan Utara and Kute Siantan from Palmatak District. The ten districts are tabulated below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census and the 2020 Census, together with the official estimates as at mid 2022. The table also includes the location of the district administrative centres, the number of villages in each district (totaling 52 rural &quot;desa&quot; and 2 urban &quot;kelurahan&quot;, the latter being Tarempa and Letung), and its post code.

Notes: (a) the 2010 population of the new Jemaja Barat District is included in the figure for Jemaja District, from which it was cut out. &lt;br&gt;(b) notwithstanding the district name, this is situated on Matak Island, of which it comprises the southern part. &lt;br&gt;(c) comprises most of Matak Island, plus nearly small islands. (d) notwithstanding the district name, this is situated on Mubur Island. &lt;br&gt;(e) the 2010 populations of the new Siantan Utara District and Kute Siantan District are included in the figures for Palmatak District, from which they were cut out.

<doc id="1321667" wikidata="Q6866761" url="?curid=1321667" title="Ministry of Defence Guard Service">
<text>The Ministry of Defence Guard Service (MGS) is part of the Defence Infrastructure Organisation of the Ministry of Defence, it provides Defence establishments across the United Kingdom with guarding and patrol services and was established as a response to the Deal Bombing. The Guard Service is one of the few remaining uniformed Civil Service agencies within the UK, and has been named an elite guarding service within the United Kingdom. They provide the highest level of security to Defence assets supporting critical Defence assets.

The MGS deals with access and pass control, initial response, key control, vehicle and personnel searching, security patrols of buildings and perimeter fences, dog patrols, CCTV, and alarm monitoring. It also performs other duties like helicopter marshalling, first aid provision, mail and baggage scanning, security sweeps, and health and safety guidance and the cordoning off of suspected bomb threats.

== Organisation and grades ==
The Ministry of Defence Guard Service (MGS) is composed of staff at all grades between SZ2 and Senior Civil Servant (SCS) Pay Band 1 (SCS PB1). A list of these is - SZ2, E2, E1, D, C2, C1, B2, B1, SCS PB1. The non-uniformed staff in MGS cover a range of business management functions and grades, for example, secretariat, service delivery, assurance, personnel management, training, standards and stores roles from SZ2 to SCS PB1 level.

Grades are often referred to by officers by the antiquated grading system’s number (e.g. CSO4 may be referred to as a &quot;four&quot; and CSO5 a &quot;five&quot;). The MGS also has support, administrative and managerial staff including programme and project managers, training staff and communications staff.


== Dog section ==
The MGS has its own dog section, made up of CSO5 (dog handlers) and military working dogs (MWDs), which provide support to other officers. The working dogs are a requirement to some MoD stations&#x27; licensing requirements to hold, store and distribute arms and ammunition, as well as other vital assets. The dogs within the MGS are recognised as force multipliers, in which the MGS say one dog team is as efficient as four officers working a beat patrol. The dog section adheres to MoD, military and statutory standards for training and welfare and are subject to the rules of engagement when met with fleeing suspects on defence estates.

== Performance ==

The MGS&#x27;s standards are maintained through external accreditation. They hold the following awards:

* National Security Inspectorate (NSI) Gold Standard
* Customer Service Excellence (CSE) Award
* Committed to Equality (C2E) Award
* Government Security Team of the Year Award 2021

==History==
From 2004 to 2013 MGS and Ministry of Defence Police worked in the Ministry of Defence Police and Guarding Agency, and were based out of MDPGA Wethersfield (previously RAF Wethersfield) in Essex. In April 2013, the MDPGA was disbanded and the MGS joined the Defence Infrastructure Organisation.

From 2019 to 2020 MoD Guard Service personnel completed around 800,000 personal and vehicle searches across the Defence estate, confiscated over 9,000 out of date security and vehicle passes, reported just under 3,000 security breaches and completed over 117,000 environmental/energy conservation actions whilst undertaking patrols.

===Operation Riverbank===

At the request of the UK Border Force various officers from the MGS assisted in Border operations during a 7 week period whilst the London 2012 Olympics were ongoing. This included detached duties to London Heathrow, Standsted Airport, Coquelles and potentially other ports as part of operations that were left undocumented in the public domain. This detachment was completed alongside the MOD Police, and officers were trained at MDPGA Weathersfield in order to work on the borders effectively.

==Uniform and equipment==
Although the MGS are a guarding organisation; they wear a similar uniform to police forces such as the MET Police Service. This consists of: 
=== Standard issue CSO uniform ===

* Short-sleeved white shirt (summer dress)
* Long-sleeved white shirt (winter dress)
* NATO &quot;woolly-pulley&quot; navy blue jumper
* Dark navy blue peaked cap (with MGS cap badge)
* Dark navy blue beret (only issued to officers stationed at air bases that host the United States Air Force)
* Black trousers (black combat trousers sometimes worn)
* Duty kit belt
* Black steel-toe-capped boots or shoes (officer specific)
* Black epaulettes denoting &quot;MoD Guard Service&quot; and grade
* Black waterproof trousers
* Black waterproof hat cover
* High visibility (printed with &quot;MoD Security&quot; in a navy blue box on breast and back) 
** High visibility light vest
** High visibility fleece (no epaulettes)
** High visibility waterproof coat
* Black British Army MkII combat glove

===Additional dog section uniform===

* Dark navy blue beret (with MGS cap badge)
* Black waterproof/foldable cap denoting &quot;MoD&quot;
* Black equipment vest
* Black field jacket
* Combat/cargo trousers

=== Other uniform ===

* Black polo shirt with &quot;MGS&quot; logo on breast
* White overalls (for vehicle searching)
* Sealskin &quot;beanie&quot; hat
* High-visibility vest
* Official MOD Guard Service tunic (number two) worn on special occasions 
* Stab vest denoting department and role &quot;MoD Security&quot;

Equipment carried can include but is not limited to:

* Air-wave radio 
* LED torch or Maglite
* First aid kit
* Acid attack kit
* Vehicle search equipment 
* Security-infringement paperwork 
* Fire safety management plans 
* Official personal notebook (PNB) and pen

==Foundation training==

Currently MGS officers are expected to attend a ten day long foundation course which includes industry leading training and equips officers with skills regarding service delivery and conflict management, emergency first aid (including trauma first aid) amongst other security and defence related training. This is then followed by a 6 month probation period where the officer will be assessed by their Operations Manager.

==Controversy==
===OMEC===
In mid 2020 the Operational MGS Employment Contract (OMEC) was introduced to newly recruited officers, this contract saw that on paper officers would earn around £25,000 which is more than what the existing contract offered. However the OMEC contract sees that officers get less meal break time and owe more shifts (26 per year) to their management. In addition officers can no longer claim for weekend premiums, and current serving officers on the old MGS contract wishing to transfer or apply for promotion will be moved onto the OMEC contract. The MoD are currently not in a position to understand the MGS officer&#x27;s concerns regarding the dispute which has led to officers in some areas taking industrial action.

===Touch pass protocol===
In August 2022 it was said that officers within the MGS at Devonport Dockyard may strike as the &quot;touch pass protocol&quot; was announced to be brought back after COVID-19 health and safety practices put a stop to it. It is said to be due to health and safety concerns.

== Other organisations ==

The MGS works alongside armed guard services—the Military Provost Guard Service in England, Scotland and Wales, and the Northern Ireland Security Guard Service (NISGS) in Northern Ireland. The Ministry of Defence Police (MDP) also work closely with the MGS, by providing an armed police service to the defence community and often act as the armed standoff or cover to the MGS whilst on guard.

The MGS also exist in within Germany as the Germany Guard Service (GGS previously CGSU (G)) similar to the afore mentioned NISGS.

<text>Harishchandra Fort is a hill fort in the Ahmednagar district of India. Its history is linked with that of Malshej Ghat, Kothale village and it has played a role in guarding and controlling the
surrounding region.

==History==
The fort is quite ancient. Remnants of Microlithic man have been discovered here. The various Puranas (ancient scriptures) like &quot;Matsyapurana, Agnipurana and Skandapurana&quot; include many references about Harishchandragad. Its origin is said to have been in the 6th century, during the rule of Kalachuri dynasty. The citadel was built during this era. The various caves probably have been carved out in the 11th century. In these caves are idols of Lord Vishnu. Though the cliffs are named Taramati and Rohidas, they are not related to Ayodhya. Great sage Changdev (one who created the epic &quot;Tatvasaar&quot;), used to meditate here in the 14th century. The caves are from the same period. The various constructions on the fort and those existing the surrounding region point to the existence of diverse cultures here. The carvings on the temples of Nageshwar (in Khireshwar village), in the Harishchandreshwar temple and in the cave of Kedareshwar indicate that the fort belongs to the &quot;medieval period&quot;, since it is related to mahadeva as a totem of tribes Mahadev Koli. They were controlling the fort before Moguls.
Later the fort was under the control of Moguls. The Marathas captured it in 1747.
==Notable Places of Interest==

===Saptatirtha Pushkarni===
To the east of the temple is a well-built lake called “Saptatirtha”. On its bank are temple-like constructions in which there are idols of Lord Vishnu. Recently these idols have been shifted in the caves near the temple of Harishchandreshwar. These days many trekkers have been responsible for the sad plight of this place, as they throw plastic wastes and other things in the pond. 7 years back the water was potable, and now it isn&#x27;t suitable even to swim. (However, this water is so cold in summer that you can actually feel like you are standing in a refrigeration unit.)

===Kedareshwar Cave===
Towards the right of Harishchandreshwar temple, there is the huge cave of Kedareshwar (&quot;see picture&quot;), in which there is a big Shiva Linga, which is completely surrounded by water. Its height from the base is , and the water is waist-deep. It is quite difficult to reach the Shiva Linga because the water is ice-cold. There are sculptures carved out in the cave. In the monsoon it is not possible to reach this cave, as a huge stream flows across the way. Actually this is the origin of River Mangalganga.

As can be seen from the picture, there is a huge rock above the Shiva Linga. There were four pillars built around the Shiva Linga to support the cave.

Another interesting thing about this place is that water seeps into this temple from the four walls on an daily basis. And owing to the water being very cold, it&#x27;s difficult to reach inside too. The water continues to seep in during all the seasons during the year. During rainy season the water level in this cave becomes almost waist high.
===Kokan Kada (कोकण कडा)===

This cliff faces west and looks down upon the Konkan. It provides views of the surrounding region. The cliff has an overhang, but has been climbed many times. Sometimes a circular rainbow (the Brocken spectre phenomenon) can be seen from this point. It can be seen only when there is a bit of mist in the valley, and the sun is right behind the person facing the valley. One phenomenon that can be observed at this place is the vertical cloud burst, in which the clouds nearing the cliff get sucked into the pit fall area below and are thrown vertically into the sky reaching more than , creating the impression of a wall that is rising straight from the edge of the cliff without entering the landmass area. If you happen to visit this place in April–May, then throw your panama cap from the cliff and enjoy it rising high and falling back on the plateau.

===Taramati peak===
Also known as Taramanchi. This is the top most point on the fort (1429 meters). Leopards are seen in the forests beyond this peak. From here we can have a glimpse of the whole range of Naneghat and the forts near Murbad.
From this Taramati point, we can have a glimpse of forts till Siddhagad near Bhimashankar in the south and Napta twin peaks, Ghodishep (865 meters), Ajoba (1375 meters), Kulang fort (1471 meters) in the north near the Kasara region.


===Caves on Harishchandragad===
These caves are spread out all over the fort. Many of these are situated at the foot of Taramati peak and are the place of accommodation. A few are near the temple, whereas some are near the citadel and some far away in the forests. A deep natural cave is on the northwestern side of the fort, to the right of Kokan Kada. Many other caves are still said to remain undiscovered.

===Nageshwar temple near Khireshwar===
This is a great antique construction, and diverse artistic works are seen on this. On the ceiling of the temple are carvings. The main attraction of the carvings here is the 1.5 m long sculpture of Lord Vishnu in the sleeping posture, popularly known as &quot;Sheshshayi Vishnu&quot; in Marathi. It is rare and hence holds a lot of importance. There are a lot of legends told about this sculpture. There are caves near the temple.
===Temple of Harishchandreshwar===

This temple is marvelous example of the fine art of carving sculptures out of stones that prevailed in ancient India. It is about 16 m high from its base. Around this temple there a few caves &amp; ancient water tanks. The river Mangal Ganga is said to originate from one of the tanks located close to the temple. The top of the temple resembles construction with the north-Indian temples. A similar temple is situated in Buddha-Gaya. Here we can see many tombs, in which a typical construction is seen. These are built by well-finished arranging stones one on top of the other. There are three main caves near the temple. The cisterns near the temple provide drinking water. A short distance away, another temple called Kashitirtha is located. The fascinating thing about this temple is that it has been carved out from a single huge rock. There are entrances from all four sides. On the main entrance there are sculptures of faces. These are faces of guards of the temple. On the left side of the entrance is a Devnagri inscription, which is about saint Changdev.

==How to reach==
Harishchandragad lies where the boundaries of Thane, Pune and Ahmednagar districts converge.

1) From Thane District:
One has to board the bus for Nagar from Kalyan &amp; alight at ‘Khubi Phata’. From there we reach the village of Khireshwar by bus or private vehicle. This village is 7 km from the foothills of the fort.

2) From Pune District:
There is a daily bus from Shivajinagar ST stand (Pune) to Khireswar village.

3) From Ahmednagar District:
One has to board the bus for Nashik or Mumbai &amp; alight at Ghoti village. From Ghoti, we have to board another bus to Sangamner via Malegaon &amp; alight at Rajur village. From here, 2 ways diverge to the fort.
1) From Rajur, one has to board the bus or a private vehicle to the village of Pachanai. From here, the way is straight to the topmost point.
2) Recently, the way from Rajur to kothale (Tolar Khind) has been made available. From Tolar Khind (Tolar valley), the temple is about 2–3 hours by walking.
3) from kotul to kothale bus facilities available way to tolar khind every hour bus going towards kothale, private vehicles also available on this route.

==Hiking to the Fort==
There are 4–5 known ways up to the fort, the most usual being the following ones:

===Way from Khireshwar===
The way beside the caves, where water tanks are seen, proceeds further to Junnar Darwaaja (entrance From Junnar). From here, the route goes straight to Tolar Khind. Walking a few minutes from Tolar Khind, we come across a rock-patch on which railings are fixed. After ascending the railings, we come to the plateau region on which less dense forests are seen. From here, we have to cross 7 hills and after a walk of 2–3 hours, we reach the temple of Harishchandreshwar, the temple of Lord Shiva.

Also there is one interesting short route if one has to skip the seven hills. By this route, you can reach the temple in 1 hour instead of 2 hours through seven hills but this route goes through very very dense forests hence if you are in group of many people, this route can be tried. After climbing the rock patch from the Tolar Khind, follow the usual trek route going ahead and at one point, you will encounter two ways one to the right goes to the temple through seven hills and the straight one goes below the Balekilla (citadel) through very dense forests and this route reaches to the seventh mountain directly.

===Way from Belpada===
The third way is specially meant for hikers, which is via Sadhleghat. One should board the bus for Malshej Ghat and go to the village of Belpada via Savarne village on the Malshej-Kalyan road. From here, the route goes through Sadhleghat. Here one has to climb a straight rock patch on which grips are provided. The temple is situated at a height of about 1 km from Belpada. The total distance is about 19 km. This route is not very popular and less used. Trekkers are advised to take guide and very slippery in rainy season.

===Way from Pachnai ===

There is another way to reach Harischandragad is from Pachnai village, a village you can reach by buses or private vehicles. Buses coming from Rajur, Akole or from Kotul. From Kotul the distance is 25 km with buses going every hour towards Pachnai &amp; Kothale. From kothale pachnai is 5 km away, you can reach there by local transport. Harischandragad is 3 km away from Pachnai. To reach Harischandragad you need to go by foot. On this way there is a small pond of pure natural water available at that pond. The history of that pond is that some years ago this pond provided water for all cowboys who came from the nearest villages. Pachnai is surrounded by mountain and in monsoon you can get visual of five falls from base.

==Drinking water==
The water tanks near the caves provide water all round the year for basic needs. The perennial stream running near the caves is the major source for drinking water. It is advisable to refrain from drinking water at the tank near to caves. While in monsoon, there are a number of waterfalls around the caves which provide potable water. Potable water is available from the tanks which are present in the temple compound.

On weekends during summer and winter, the villagers sell lemon water and buttermilk at 2–3 points between Tolar Khind and Harishchandreshwar. Basic meals are available at 7–8 temporary shacks over the weekend. Even tents can be provided by local people for accommodation.

==Notes==
In monsoon, proper care should be taken while trekking in the rockface after Tolar khind. It is advisable not to walk on the rock face in monsoon particularly during night where one can experience heavy rainfall with thunder strikes.

Gibraltar is the only member of the IIGA that is not an island or group of islands, as it is a peninsula of Iberia, sharing a land border with Spain. Ynys Môn (Anglesey), Frøya and Hitra have bridge or tunnel connections to their mainlands. Greenland is by far the largest island, and is magnitudes bigger than all the rest combined, but is very sparsely populated. Former members of the IIGA include the countries Iceland and Malta, Canada&#x27;s island province Prince Edward Island, and the Rhodes island of Greece .

===By country===
# (2):Faroe Islands - Greenland
# (1):Saare County

# (10):Bermuda - Cayman Islands - Falkland Islands - Gibraltar - Isle of Wight - Orkney - Saint Helena - Shetland - Western Isles - Ynys Môn
# (3) Guernsey - Alderney - Sark
# (1) Isle of Man 
# (1) Jersey

===Membership criteria===
The IIGA constitution lists the criteria which apply to new applicants. These limit applications to island territories with populations less than 125,000. There must be a local association of governing bodies of at least two sports in the IIGA program at which the island can &quot;adequately&quot; compete. Membership is limited to 25.
