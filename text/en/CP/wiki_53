<text>Marcus Aurelius Nemesianus was a Roman poet thought to have been a native of Carthage and flourished about AD 283. He was a popular poet at the court of the Roman emperor Carus (Historia Augusta, &quot;Carus&quot;, 11). 

==Bogus name &quot;Olympius&quot;==
A bogus poet by the name of Olympius Nemesianus was mentioned in the Historia Augusta, where he was given authorship of two otherwise-unattested and probably imaginary works, &quot;Halieutica&quot; on fishing and &quot;Nautica&quot; on boating. It is likely that a gloss on the Historia Augusta noted the name &quot;Cynegetica&quot; in the margin in Greek letters, probably because the copyist recognized the name Nemesianus and wanted to use his limited knowledge of Greek; a later copyist moved it into the text of the Historia Augusta, and the name Olympius was conflated with the genuine Nemesianus.

==Works==
The works below are by, or have been at times attributed to, Nemesianus:
===Didactic poetry===
Nemesianus wrote a poem on hunting (&quot;Cynegetica&quot;); a fragment, 325 hexameter lines, has been preserved. It is neatly expressed in good Latin, and was used as a school textbook by Hincmar of Reims in the 9th century AD. The spoof work Historia Augusta gives to 
&quot;Olympius Nemesianus&quot; a work on the arts of fishing (&quot;Halieutica&quot;) and one on sailing (&quot;Nautica&quot;). 

Two fragments exist of a poem about bird catching (&quot;De aucupio&quot;), which are sometimes attributed to Nemesianus, although this attribution is considered doubtful.

===The Eclogues===

Four eclogues, formerly attributed to Titus Calpurnius Siculus, are now generally considered to be by Nemesianus.

===The Praise of Hercules===
The &quot;Praise of Hercules&quot;, sometimes printed in Claudian&#x27;s works, may be by him.

==Editions==
Complete edition of the works attributed to him in Emil Baehrens, &quot;Poetae Latini Minores&quot;, iii. (1881); &quot;Cynegetica&quot;: ed. Moritz Haupt (with Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Halieutica&quot; and Grattius) 1838, and R. Stern, with Grattius (1832); Italian translation with notes by L. F. Valdrighi (1876). The four eclogues are printed with those of Calpurnius in the editions of H. Schenkl (1885) and Charles Haines Keene (1887); see L. Cisorio, &quot;Studio sulle Egloghe di Nemesiano&quot; (1895) and &quot;Dell&#x27; imitazione nelle Egloghe di Nemesiano&quot; (1896); and M. Haupt, &quot;De Carminibus Bucolicis Calpurnii et Nemesiani&quot; (1853), the chief treatise on the subject. The text of the &quot;Cynegetica&quot;, the &quot;Eclogues&quot;, and the doubtful &quot;Fragment on Bird-Catching&quot; were published in Vol. II of &quot;Minor Latin Poets&quot; (Loeb Classical Library with English translations (1934).

<doc id="1336553" wikidata="Q897843" url="?curid=1336553" title="Erythroplakia">
<text>Erythroplakia is a clinical term to describe any erythematous (red) area on a mucous membrane, that cannot be attributed to any other pathology.

The term erythroplasia was coined by Louis Queyrat to describe a precancerous red lesion of the penis. This gave rise to the term erythoplasia of Queyrat. Depending upon the context, this term may refer specifically to carcinoma in situ of the glans penis or vulva appearing as a red patch, or may be used as a synonym of erythroplasia on other mucous membrane or transitional sites.

It mainly affects the glans penis (the head of the penis), although uncommonly it may present on the mucous membranes of the larynx, and rarely, the mouth, or the anus.

Erythroplakia is analogous to the term leukoplakia which describes white patches. Together, these are the 2 traditionally accepted types of premalignant lesion in the mouth, When a lesion contains both red and white areas, the term &quot;speckled leukoplakia&quot; or &quot;eyrthroleukoplakia&quot; is used.

Although oral erythroplakia is much less common than leukoplakia, erythroplakia carries a significantly higher risk of containing dysplasia or carcinoma in situ, and of eventually transforming into invasive squamous cell carcinoma (a type of oral cancer).

== Signs and symptoms ==
Although often the terms &quot;erythroplasia&quot; and &quot;erythroplakia&quot; are used synonymously, some sources distinguish them, stating that the latter is macular (flat) while the former is papular (bumpy).

Erythroplakia of the genital mucosae is often referred to as erythroplasia of Queyrat.

The most common areas in the mouth where erythroplakia is found are the floor of the mouth, buccal vestibule, the tongue, and the soft palate. It appears as a red macule or plaque with well-demarcated borders. The texture is characterized as soft and velvety. An adjacent area of leukoplakia may be found along with the erythroplakia.

Erythroplasia may also occur on the laryngeal mucosa, or the anal mucosa.

== Causes ==
Erythroplakia has an unknown cause but researchers presume it to be similar to the causes of squamous cell carcinoma. Carcinoma is found in almost 40% of erythroplakia. It is mostly found in elderly men around the ages of 65 - 74. It is commonly associated with smoking.

Alcohol and tobacco use have been described as risk factors.

== Diagnosis ==

===Differential diagnosis of an oral red lesion===
There are many other conditions that are similar in appearance and must be ruled out before a diagnosis of erythroplakia is made (see table). Sometimes, a diagnosis is delayed for up to two weeks in order to see if the lesion spontaneously regresses on its own or if another cause can be found. Erythroplakia frequently is associated with dysplasia, and is thus a precancerous lesion.

===Biopsy===
Microscopically, the tissue exhibits severe epithelial dysplasia, carcinoma-in-situ, or invasive squamous cell carcinoma in 90% of cases. There is an absence of keratin production and a reduced number of epithelial cells. Since the underlying vascular structures are less hidden by tissue, erythroplakia appears red when viewed in a clinical setting.

== Treatment ==
Treatment involves biopsy of the lesion to identify extent of dysplasia. Complete excision of the lesion is sometimes advised depending on the histopathology found in the biopsy. Even in these cases, recurrence of the erythroplakia is common and, thus, long-term monitoring is needed.

==History==

In 1911, French dermatologist Louis Queyrat described a sharply defined, bright red, glistening velvety precancerous lesion of the glans penis. He coined the term &quot;erythroplasie&quot; to designate red plaques as an analogy to &quot;leucoplasie&quot;, which designated white patches. Since &quot;leucoplasie&quot; was the equivalent of the English leukoplakia (coined in 1861), the term became erythroplakia in English. Similarly, the term leukoplakia was originally coined to describe white lesions of the urinary tract, and in 1877 was first applied to white patches in the mouth. It is unclear when the term erythroplakia was first adapted to describe red lesions in the mouth.

==Etymology==
The word erythroplakia means &quot;red patch&quot;, and is derived from the Greek words ερυθρος - &quot;red&quot; and πλάξ - &quot;plate&quot;
The World Health Organization defines oral erythroplakia as follows:

<doc id="1336557" wikidata="Q1135712" url="?curid=1336557" title="Butare Province">
<text>Butare was a province (&quot;prefecture&quot;) of Rwanda prior to its dissolution in January 2006. Butare city was the second largest city in Rwanda and one of the nation&#x27;s former twelve provinces. It is located in south-central region of the country and borders Burundi to the south. It had a population of 77.449 as of January 2006.

== Description ==

Butare was situated in the south west of the country and bordered Burundi. Its geography was in keeping with most of the rest of Rwanda, and was hilly compared to surrounding Tanzania, but not as mountainous as the North of Rwanda.

== Genocide ==

During testimony at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) investigating the 1994 Rwandan genocide, expert André Guichaoua referred to Butare as the &quot;rebel province.&quot; Butare was the only prefecture to be run by a Tutsi, Jean-Baptiste Habyalimana, who actively opposed the genocide. Because it had a large Tutsi minority, prefectural politics were dominated by the Parti Social Démocrate (PSD), rather than the Mouvement Républicain National pour la Démocratie et le développement (MRND), from which the genocidal Interahamwe drew recruits. The Interahamwe in Butare were thus less numerous and less organized than their counterparts in the rest of country. When the country erupted into bloodshed following the death of President Juvenal Habyarimana (no relation to the prefect) on 6 April 1994, Butare was untouched, with the notable exception of the Nyakizu commune. Many Tutsis who fled the violence in other parts of country found haven in Butare.

The calm lasted two weeks. Interim President Théodore Sindikubwabo, himself a native of Butare, appointed a new prefect on 19 April in a ceremony in the prefectural capital. Prefect Habyalimana was shortly thereafter arrested and killed. One of the next to die was former Queen Rosalie Gicanda, described by the ICTR prosecution as &quot;a historical symbol for all Tutsi&quot;. Paramilitary units and Interahamwe were then airlifted from Kigali, signaling the start of the killing. It has been suggested that the Hutu government leadership were particularly concerned about Butare because so many of them were natives; besides Sindikubwabo, Prime Minister Jean Kambanda (the first person convicted by the ICTR), General Augustin Ndindiliyimana (head of the Gendarmie), and Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, the minister of women and family affairs were all born in Butare. Despite the fact that the genocide was delayed two weeks, 220,000 would be killed. This is more than 20% of the total and the highest by far of any prefecture.

<doc id="1336564" wikidata="Q2756984" url="?curid=1336564" title="Backlash (1956 film)">
<text>Backlash is a 1956 American western film directed by John Sturges and starring Richard Widmark, Donna Reed and William Campbell. It was produced and distributed by Universal Pictures.

It was directed by John Sturges (with whom Widmark would also make another Western &quot;The Law and Jake Wade&quot;) and unfolds in the vein of the psychological Western (a subgenre that has yielded many films, e.g. those of Anthony Mann, with whose films this bears comparison). It delivers an unconventional story, written by Borden Chase, that sometimes crosses into film noir, as a colorful cast of supporting characters help or hinder the protagonist during the unfolding of its central mystery. &quot;Backlash&quot; was filmed on location at Old Tucson Studios.

==Plot==
Jim Slater meets Karyl Orton in Gila Valley, Arizona. She thinks that he is searching for a gold cache believed to be hidden somewhere in the valley. When a man with a rifle starts shooting at him, Jim wonders if she can be trusted. After Jim kills his foe, he discovers the dead man was a deputy sheriff from Silver City. He takes the body there.

When Sheriff J. C. Marson questions him, Jim reveals that he is after the person responsible for his father&#x27;s death. Jim&#x27;s father and four other men were besieged and killed by Apaches. Jim believes there was a sixth man who got away and could have gone for help, but instead decided he wanted the gold they found all to himself. Marston reveals that one of the men was the brother of the dead deputy. There are two other brothers, who will want revenge. When Jim refuses to leave town, Marston suggests he go see Sergeant George Lake in Tucson. Lake led the detail that found the massacre victims.

Jim takes his advice but finds Lake and his men under siege at an isolated trading post. Lake tells Karyl that only three of the bodies could be identified. While there, Karyl stakes her claim to the gold; her husband was another victim of Gila Valley. Lake and Jim sneak out that night and stampede the Apaches&#x27; horses, allowing the party to escape. Lake, however, is mortally wounded. Before he dies, he reveals they found a horse bearing the brand of Carson&#x27;s outfit in Texas.

When Jim returns to Tucson, he encounters Karyl in a hotel, being forced upstairs by a stranger. Karyl calls him by name, whereupon the stranger draws his gun. Jim kills him and wounds another man gunning for him, though he is shot in the shoulder. Afterward, Karyl reveals that the dead man is Jeff Welker and the survivor is his brother Tony. Jim slaps her. She tracks him down, tends to his wound, and offers to trade information. Jim kisses her.

When the pair reach their destination, Major Carson tries to recruit Jim against Bonniwell, who has organized the local bandits. Jim is not interested in the upcoming range war, though he does learn that Bonniwell arrived in the region with $60,000, the same amount as the missing gold. One of Carson&#x27;s gunmen, the black-clad, insolent Johnny Cool, informs Bonniwell of Carson&#x27;s plans.

Bonniwell gathers his men in town, guns down Sheriff Olson when he tries to keep the peace, and prepares an ambush. He finds Jim locked in the jail. He lets the prisoner out when he learns who he is, then reveals that he is Jim&#x27;s father, whom Jim had not seen since he was a child. The gold came, not from mining, but via robbery. The others forced Bonniwell out, only to run afoul of the Apaches, leaving him to collect the gold. Disillusioned, Jim wants nothing to do with his father.

Johnny Cool comes after Jim, who is unarmed. Cool asks Bonniwell to give Jim a gun, which he does. Jim outdraws and kills Cool.

Karyl pleads with Jim to leave immediately, but he wants to warn Carson. When he tries to fire a warning shot, he discovers that Bonniwell gave him back an unloaded gun. Bonniwell chases his son with a knife, but Jim manages to wrestle a gun from one of the bandits and fire. Alerted, Carson has his men surround the town, whereupon the bandits panic and flee. Bonniwell offers to step out of hiding and draw to see which Slater is faster, but he treacherously already has his gun in his hand. Carson&#x27;s men ride in and fatally shoot him just before Jim steps out in the open. Bonniwell seems ready to say something to Jim, but dies beforehand. Jim and Karyl walk off together.

<text>The Berthold Seliger Forschungs- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH (BSFEGmbH) was a company founded by West German rocket technical designer Berthold Seliger in 1961. Seliger was a former assistant theoretician professor Dr. Eugen Sänger. The company developed and built prototypes of sounding rockets and launched them near Cuxhaven. The BSFEGmbH cooperated strongly with the Hermann-Oberth-Gesellschaft, of which Berthold Seliger was a member. The first rocket developed by the BSFEGmbH was an improved version of the Kumulus, which was first launched on 19 November 1962 and reached a height of 50 kilometres. On 7 February 1963 the BSFEGmbH launched a two-stage rocket with a maximum height of 80 kilometres and, on 2 May 1963, they launched a three-stage rocket with a maximum flight height of more than 100 kilometres. The latter rocket may have attained the highest flight altitude of all rockets built in post-war Germany. The signals from all these rockets were also received at the observatory in Bochum (300 km SSW of Cuxhaven). After May 1963 the BSFEGmbH worked on the improvement of the steering system of their rockets and thought also on military usable rockets.

On 5 December 1963 the BSFEGmbH gave a flight demonstration of their rockets to military staff of non-NATO-countries. Although their rockets were launched with reduced amount of propellant in order not to violate Allied laws concerning the development of military rockets in Germany and were not fit for military use, the rocket experiments of the Hermann-Oberth-Gesellschaft e.V. and the BSFEGmbH after this date were viewed with great suspicion.

In 1964, these experiments were discontinued with a temporary injunction, which is still valid today, after a fatal accident at a rocket demonstration by Gerhard Zucker at Braunlage, although Gerhard Zucker did not cooperate with the BSFEGmbH or the Hermann-Oberth-Gesellschaft e.V. in any way and also had a bad reputation with the members of these societies.

<text>By the end of Portuguese rule, Macau was administratively divided into two municipalities: Macau and Ilhas, and seven civil parishes (). Parishes were administrative subdivisions of the municipalities. 

After the 1999 transfer of sovereignty over Macau from Portugal to China, municipalities were formally abolished on 31 December 2001 by Law No. 17/2001. Since the abolition of the municipalities, parishes are still officially recognized divisions but for symbolic reasons only, while some of the municipal services are now handled by the Municipal Affairs Bureau.

==Parishes==
Prior to the dissolution of the municipalities in 2001, the first five parishes listed in the table below fell under the Municipality of Macau while the remaining two fell under the Municipality of Ilhas, totalling to seven parishes. The parishes of Nossa Senhora do Carmo and São Francisco Xavier are coterminous with the natural borders of the islands of Taipa and Coloane, respectively.

===Former municipalities===
Each municipality was run by a municipal chamber (), with a supervising municipal assembly ().

<text>The Hermann Oberth Gesellschaft (1952-1993) was an association named after Hermann Oberth, the German astronautics pioneer and the authoritative expert on rocketry outside the United States, which develops and builds rockets and trains engineers in space technology.

The association was founded on the initiative of the german rocket pioneer Karl Poggensee (1909-1980) on September 21, 1952 by eleven rocket specialists as the &quot;Deutsche Agentur für Raumfahrtangelegenheiten&quot; (DAFRA) under the motto &quot;to promote the peaceful exploration and development of space&quot;. Its founders were of the opinion that the company they had set up should be dedicated to developing rockets and using them exclusively for peaceful purposes, and that the Federal Republic of Germany should make a contribution to space research. August Friedrich Staats was elected chairman. In the early days, various test rockets were developed in Hespenbusch near Grossenkneten, which soon reached heights of a few kilometers, so that the area available in Hespenbusch became too small.

In 1956, DAFRA was accepted as a member of the IAF at the 7th Congress of the International Astronautical Federation (IAF) in Rome. On the eve of the 1958 DAFRA conference, it was decided to transform DAFRA into the &quot;Deutsche Raketen-Gesellschaft&quot; (DRG) and to set up the first German Commission for Space Research. The chairman of DAFRA, August Friedrich Staats, was elected president of the DRG, and in 1960 he became vice president of the IAF.

In 1957 the rocket tests of the Deutsche &quot;Raketen-Gesellschaft&quot; (DRG) were relocated to the Wadden area of Cuxhaven. There in 1959 some mail rockets were launched by the DRG. In December 1960, the first launch of the single-stage high-altitude rocket Kumulus took place with a peak altitude of 20 kilometers and on September 16, 1961, the first launch of the two-stage high-altitude rocket Cirrus with a peak altitude of 50 kilometers.

At this time Berthold Seliger began to build rockets in this society (DRG). In 1961 Berthold Seliger created his own company, the Seliger Forschungs- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH, which cooperated with the Deutsche Raketen-Gesellschaft (DRG). The Seliger Forschungs- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH developed several two- and three-stage rockets, which could reach heights of up to 150 kilometers, between 1962 and 1963. After a disputed flight demonstration of the Seliger Forschungs- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH militarily usable rockets before military representatives from non-NATO states at Cuxhaven on December 5, 1963, a break between the Seliger Forschungs- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH and the Deutsche Raketen-Gesellschaft occurred. The latter continued to make a few high-altitude rocket launches up to June 1964 and continued experimenting with mail rockets and hybrid-propellant rocket and steam rocket propulsion systems until 1976.

In 1963, with the consent of Hermann Oberth, who had rendered outstanding service to Space, it was decided to rename the DRG to &quot;Hermann-Oberth-Gesellschaft&quot; (HOG). Oberth died in Feucht on December 28, 1989. In his book &quot;The Rocket to the Planetary Spaces&quot; published in 1923, he was the first to comprehensively present the scientific and technical foundations of rocket and space technology. He is considered the father of scientific rocket technology and astronautics.

After the termination of the rocket launches in the Cuxhaven Wadden area the &quot;Hermann-Oberth-Gesellschaft&quot; focused on nationwide public relations work on the international space programs through lecture evenings and space congresses, as well as the promotion of students in space technology in so-called &quot;Rocket and Space technology teaching and test centers&quot;.

In 1990, Dr.-Ing. August Friedrich Staats resigned as President after nearly forty years in office. His successor was Prof. Dr.-Ing. Hans Josef Rath. Staats was elected honorary and vice president. In the fall of 1990, the &quot;Hermann-Oberth-Gesellschaft&quot; entered into negotiations with the aim of merging the HOG with the &quot;Deutsche Gesellschaft für Luft- und Raumfahrt&quot;, the &quot;Gesellschaft für Raketentechnik und Weltraumfahrt&quot; and the &quot;Fachverband für Luftfahrt&quot; for the &quot;Deutschen Gesellschaft für Luft- und Raumfahrt Lilienthal–Oberth (DGLR)&quot; to merge. After extensive discussions and coordination, the merger was completed in 1993.

<text>A Supposedly Fun Thing I&#x27;ll Never Do Again: Essays and Arguments is a 1997 collection of nonfiction writing by David Foster Wallace.

In the title essay, originally published in &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; as &quot;Shipping Out&quot;, Wallace describes the excesses of his one-week trip in the Caribbean aboard the cruise ship , which he rechristens the &quot;Nadir&quot;. He is uncomfortable with the professional hospitality industry and the &quot;fun&quot; he should be having, and explains how the indulgences of the cruise cause introspection, leading to overwhelming internal despair. Wallace uses footnotes extensively for various asides.

Another essay in the same volume takes up the vulgarities and excesses of the Illinois State Fair. This collection also includes Wallace&#x27;s influential essay &quot;E Unibus Pluram&quot; on television&#x27;s impact on contemporary literature and the use of irony in American culture. In 2019, the collection was ranked in &quot;Slate&quot; as one of the 50 greatest nonfiction works of the past 25 years.

==In popular culture==
In his 2011 book &quot;That Is All&quot;, John Hodgman titles a chapter about taking a cruise &quot;A Totally Fun Thing I Would Do Again as Soon as Possible&quot;. The title of the 2012 &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;A Totally Fun Thing That Bart Will Never Do Again&quot; also references the title essay. Tina Fey&#x27;s 2011 memoir &quot;Bossypants&quot; includes a chapter on her own cruise experience, titled &quot;My Honeymoon: Or, A Supposedly Fun Thing That I&#x27;ll Never Do Again Either,&quot; in which she jokingly suggests that those who&#x27;ve heard of Wallace&#x27;s book should consider themselves members of the &quot;cultural elite.&quot; In Charlie Kaufman&#x27;s 2020 film &quot;I&#x27;m Thinking of Ending Things,&quot; the character Jake mentions the book, refers to &quot;E Unibus Pluram,&quot; then recites a portion of the essay from the section &quot;Image-Fiction&quot; verbatim.

<text>The Cirrus is a sounding rocket with two stages, developed by the &quot;Hermann Oberth Society&quot;. Its only launches were both on September 16, 1961, at Cuxhaven. The maximum height of the Cirrus, depending on the version, is 35 kilometres with a single stage or 50 kilometres for the 2 stage version.

A Cirrus rocket is exhibited at the Hermann Oberth Space Travel Museum in Feucht, Germany.

<text>Archibald Campbell MacLaren (1 December 1871 – 17 November 1944) was an English cricketer who captained the England cricket team at various times between 1898 and 1909. A right-handed batsman, he played 35 Test matches for England, as captain in 22 of those games, and led the team to defeat in four Ashes series against Australia. An amateur, MacLaren played first-class cricket for Lancashire, captaining that county for most of his career. As a batsman, MacLaren was one of the leading cricketers of his time and had a reputation as a fast-scoring stylist. In 1895, he scored 424 runs in an innings against Somerset which was the highest individual score in first-class cricket until 1923 and remained a record in English cricket until 1994. Opinions were divided over his captaincy. He was a deep thinker on the game and critics believed him to be tactically advanced, but his pessimism, clashes with the selectors and inability to get the best out of his players led most commentators to rate him a poor leader.

After attending public school, MacLaren played intermittently for Lancashire until 1899 as he tried to establish a career outside the sport. Even so, he was appointed county captain in 1894 and was chosen frequently to play for England. An appointment as Lancashire&#x27;s assistant secretary allowed him to play more regularly from 1900. He first captained England in 1898 as a stand-in, but became captain in his own right in 1899. Under his leadership, England lost to Australia in three consecutive series—1899, 1901–02 and 1902. MacLaren was involved in controversies throughout all three defeats, and was replaced as captain in 1905, although he remained in the team. Business interests kept him out of the game for the following years, but he was invited to lead England once more in 1909. Defeat in that series ended his Test career, and the following year he ceased playing regular first-class cricket. He played occasionally until 1922–23, and had some late successes: in 1921, a team selected and captained by MacLaren defeated a previously unbeaten Australian team, and on his final first-class appearance during a 1922–23 Marylebone Cricket Club tour of New Zealand, he scored 200 runs.

MacLaren had many jobs as he attempted to find ways to support his cricket, family and lifestyle. At various times, he worked as a teacher, a journalist and a cricket coach. For many years, he was employed as Lancashire&#x27;s assistant secretary but such were his financial worries that he often had to ask for cash advances from the committee, with which he had a stormy relationship. He worked for several years as private secretary to K. S. Ranjitsinhji and he became involved in his employer&#x27;s financial scandals. Many of MacLaren&#x27;s later business ventures were failures, and only when his wife came into an inheritance did he and his family live in comfort. Throughout his life, MacLaren was involved in many disagreements and was never popular with teammates. However, he was a hero to the cricket writer Neville Cardus, who wrote prolifically on him. MacLaren died in 1944, aged 72.

==Early life==
MacLaren was born on 1 December 1871 in Whalley Range, a fairly prosperous district of Manchester, the second of seven sons to James MacLaren and Emily Carver. His father, a cotton merchant and cricket enthusiast, served as honorary treasurer to the Lancashire team from 1881 until his death in 1900. MacLaren senior encouraged his sons to play cricket. With the aim of improving their ability in the game, MacLaren senior sent Archie and his older brother James to Elstree, a school well-regarded for its coaching.

MacLaren&#x27;s cricket instruction was supplemented during the holidays at Old Trafford Cricket Ground, where his father paid professional cricketers to bowl at him. He was soon selected for the school&#x27;s cricket team, scored his first century, and was the captain by his final year. From Elstree, MacLaren went to Harrow School in 1886 where he joined James; Geoffrey, their younger brother, followed them but financial difficulties prevented any other family members attending the school. MacLaren had little success in intra-school cricket during his first year there but in 1887, success in trial games resulted in his promotion to the school first eleven. A century in an early match ensured his selection for the important fixture against Eton College at Lord&#x27;s. Although an inexperienced Harrow team was easily defeated, MacLaren top-scored in both innings with scores of 55 and 67, and in praising his batting, critics suggested he had a bright future. He came top of the school batting averages for the 1887 season.

Wet weather in the following two years affected playing conditions, making the cricket pitches slow-paced and difficult to bat on. With little experience of such conditions, MacLaren had a succession of failures. His technique, based at the time on playing forward at the ball, was unsuited to wet pitches and it was only late in 1889 that he made the required technical adjustments and learned to play off the back foot (i.e. stepping backwards to play a shot). During 1890, his final year at Harrow, he captained the team and had his most successful season, scoring over 500 runs at an average of 42.54. In the match against Eton at Lord&#x27;s, MacLaren once more succeeded when others struggled, and he scored 76 on a difficult pitch. In his four years at Harrow, MacLaren was twice awarded the prize for the school&#x27;s best batsman, and received awards for his fielding. MacLaren also played football successfully: he captained his House team and played in the school first eleven in 1888 and 1889 before a knee injury forced him to miss the 1890 season. Unlike many of his fellow amateur cricketers in this period, MacLaren did not attend Oxford or Cambridge Universities, where he would have played a high level of cricket; his father could not afford to send him or his brothers there. On leaving Harrow, MacLaren found employment with the Manchester and Liverpool District Bank.

==Lancashire cricketer==
Lancashire monitored MacLaren&#x27;s progress during his time at Harrow. When his season there ended in 1890, he was selected to play for Lancashire in the County Championship. Making his first-class debut on 14 August 1890 in a match against Sussex, he scored 108 runs on a difficult pitch in a relatively fast time of two hours. Although less successful in the remaining games of the season, he finished fourth in the Lancashire averages with 140 runs at an average of 23.33. MacLaren&#x27;s financial circumstances forced him to keep working at the District Bank, limiting the amount of cricket he played in 1891 and 1892.

When he did play for Lancashire, MacLaren was moderately successful. He led the county&#x27;s batting averages in 1892 and in total scored 548 runs at 27.40. Of his two centuries, the second came when he opened the batting. During the winter of 1892–93, MacLaren studied cotton manufacture in New Orleans; when he returned home, he played more regularly for Lancashire. He scored consistently in 1893, totalling 831 runs at 25.18, had success in the high-profile match against Yorkshire, and led the team in the absence of the regular captain. As a result of his successes, he was selected to play for the North of England in a representative match against the Australian team who were touring England that year. He scored 66, sharing an opening partnership of 121 in 80 minutes with his county colleague Albert Ward. Later in the season, he was chosen to play for the amateur &quot;Gentlemen&quot; team in the prestigious Gentlemen v Players match at Lord&#x27;s.

Before the 1894 season, MacLaren resigned from the bank to play a whole season of cricket. Lancashire at the time were undergoing a period of transition, and the captaincy was unsettled: three men captained the county in the first part of the season. In the absence of other amateurs with county experience who could play regularly, MacLaren was appointed captain. &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot; observed that MacLaren was young for the position, and largely unproven in cricket, but it supported the decision. After losing his first match in charge, the team improved in the latter part of the season to finish fourth in the Championship. MacLaren finished sixth in the Lancashire averages, and in total scored 1,105 runs at 25.69, but his batting had made little progress since his debut. However, his successful leadership of Lancashire led some press critics to suggest him as a future England captain. At the end of the season, he was a last-minute selection to tour Australia with a team led by Andrew Stoddart.

==Test cricketer==

===Test debut===

Approached to organise a touring team by the Australian cricket authorities, Stoddart had been unable to persuade several leading batsmen to join his squad. Stoddart only took 13 men, of whom two were wicket-keepers (only one of whom could realistically play in each match) and one was a lob bowler who did not play any Test matches; this guaranteed MacLaren&#x27;s selection for all the matches against Australia. Consequently, he retained his place even when his form was poor. In his first game, against South Australia, he scored 228, and hit another half-century in the build-up to the first Test. He made his international debut on 14 December 1894, scoring 4 and 20 as England won despite being asked to follow on. England also won the next game, although MacLaren was caught from the opening delivery of the match, the first time anyone had been dismissed by the first ball of a Test. Australia took the third and fourth Tests to level the series. MacLaren had little personal success, and averaged only 12.50 in the series after four games.

By then, MacLaren was in financial difficulties. As an amateur, his expenses were covered by the tour organisers but he received no money for playing. To support him financially, the Lancashire committee had given him £100 before the tour. By the latter stages of the tour, his money was running out; most of it was probably spent betting on horse races, and he sent Lancashire a request for further money. Just before the final Test, he received a £60 advance on his expenses for the upcoming English season. For the fifth Test, he dropped down from opening the batting, which he had done throughout the series, to batting at number five, and responded with his first Test century. Batting with greater caution than usual, he scored 120 before accidentally standing on his own wicket. England won the match to take the series 3–2, amid great public interest in England and Australia. MacLaren scored 240 runs at 26.67 in the Test series, finishing fourth in the English averages. He performed more effectively in the lesser matches, and following some final tour fixtures, he totalled 803 runs at 47.23 in all first-class games. On the six-week outward journey MacLaren met (Kathleen) Maud Power, an Australian socialite and the daughter of a horse racing official. They were married in 1898.

===World record holder===
MacLaren returned home via Japan, missing the start of the 1895 cricket season. In his absence, he was named as a &quot;Young Batsman of the Year&quot; in &quot;Wisden&quot; for his performances in 1894. After playing two games for Lancashire, MacLaren accepted the offer of a teaching job in a preparatory school in Harrow; although still Lancashire&#x27;s captain, he missed several matches, to the disquiet of its supporters. The team&#x27;s results were mixed in his absence, and he returned to play Somerset at Taunton. On the first day of the three-day game, MacLaren scored 289 not out in 330 minutes. On the second day, he took his score to 424 before he was dismissed, surpassing the previous highest individual innings in first-class cricket, W. G. Grace&#x27;s score of 344, made in 1876. MacLaren batted for 470 minutes in total and hit 62 fours and a six. This remained the highest score in first-class cricket until 1923 when Bill Ponsford scored 429 in Australia, and was the largest first-class innings in England until Brian Lara scored 501 in 1994. In total, Lancashire scored 801 runs and won the game by an innings. After a spell of lower scores, MacLaren played several big innings, including three consecutive centuries in the last three games of the season. He ended 1895 top of the national batting averages with 1,229 runs at 51.20. MacLaren was elected a life member of Lancashire in recognition of his achievements.

Teaching commitments left MacLaren unavailable for the start of the 1896 season, and his first appearance came in July. Although he had batted only once in the season, he was chosen to play in the second Test match of the summer between England and Australia, a selection made controversial by his lack of cricket. As the Test was played at Old Trafford, the England team was chosen by the Lancashire committee, who recognised that MacLaren would attract spectators as a local player. He was dismissed by the first ball he faced in the first innings, and scored 15 runs in the second as England were defeated. Shortly after the Test, he scored 226 against Kent to take Lancashire to a draw in a match they seemed likely to lose. This was enough for him to retain his place in the team for the final Test match, where he scored 20 and 6. He batted effectively for the rest of the season, finishing with 713 runs for Lancashire at 54.85. Critics praised his batting, but his absences may have prevented the team from winning the Championship; they finished second. In all first-class matches, he scored 922 runs at 36.88.

===Second tour of Australia===
MacLaren&#x27;s teaching duties meant that in 1897 he again missed the start of the cricket season, and he felt it necessary to resign as Lancashire&#x27;s captain. When he began playing, he scored heavily, including another double century against Kent, and his runs helped Lancashire to win the County Championship: concentrating on aggressive batting, he scored faster than in previous years, and hit 974 runs at 51.26. At the end of the season, MacLaren was included in Stoddart&#x27;s second Australian touring team. Despite high expectations of success, the Test series was lost 4–1. Although nominally captain, Stoddart played in only two Tests; he was grief-stricken after the death of his mother and disillusioned by the failures of his team. MacLaren, after an unproductive start to the tour, scored 142 and 100 against New South Wales to become the first batsman to score two centuries in the same Australian first-class match. In the absence of Stoddart, he captained the England team in the first Test. He scored 109 in the first innings, batting more cautiously than usual, and 50 not out in the second as England won by nine wickets. His captaincy proved controversial when he refused to recall the Australian batsman Charlie McLeod to the wickets after he was dismissed; McLeod was out to a no-ball but, being deaf, did not hear the umpire&#x27;s call and was run out when he left his crease. With Stoddart still absent, MacLaren was captain in the second Test. Australia won by an innings, and MacLaren was criticised in the Australian press for complaining about the pitch. Commentators also suggested that he underused the bowling of Ted Wainwright. Stoddart returned for the third and fourth Tests, both of which England lost by an innings. MacLaren scored 124 in the third game, but was mocked in the press after the fourth when he claimed that a fly in his eye caused him to be dismissed. When Stoddart withdrew from the final match, MacLaren once more assumed the leadership. He scored 65 in the first innings but could not prevent Australia winning again.

In all first-class matches, MacLaren scored 1,037 runs at 54.57; in the Test matches, he aggregated 488 runs at an average of 54.22. &quot;Wisden&quot; noted that MacLaren batted &quot;magnificently&quot; and commented: &quot;Of all the English players the one who had the best cause to look back upon the trip with satisfaction was MacLaren.&quot; At the conclusion of the tour, on 17 March 1898, he married Power. The wedding attracted media attention and was well attended. The couple later had two sons.

==England captain==

===Appointment and start of captaincy===
MacLaren played little cricket in 1898, initially owing to his teaching commitments and the need to establish himself and his wife in a new home. After making his first appearance in July, he did not play again until August. He played nine first-class games, scoring 478 runs at 29.87, before his season was ended by neuralgia. Despite his frequent absences—again he missed the first part of the season—Lancashire re-appointed MacLaren as joint captain for 1899. That summer, the Australians toured England and the first Test took place before MacLaren had played any cricket. For the second game, MacLaren replaced W. G. Grace as England captain; the other candidate for the leadership was Stanley Jackson, who was senior to MacLaren at Harrow and had preceded him into the England side, but MacLaren was favoured owing to his previous experience in the role with Lancashire and England.

Australia comfortably won the second Test, and on his first appearance of the season, MacLaren scored 4 runs opening the innings on the first day. In the second innings, he moved down the order to number six, but he came in to bat when England trailed heavily and had lost four wickets. He batted for around 150 minutes to score 88 not out. The &quot;Wisden&quot; match report stated: &quot;There was ... some risk in playing MacLaren, who had not so far taken part in any first-class cricket during the season. In this case however, the [selection] committee had reason to congratulate themselves, MacLaren playing a magnificent second innings and making a great, though fruitless, effort to save the game ... Never has MacLaren played a greater innings.&quot; Afterwards, MacLaren scored a century in difficult batting conditions against Yorkshire. Jackson did not play in this game, and initially refused to play for England in the third Test; the press attributed this to jealousy of MacLaren and anger at being passed over for the captaincy. The third Test was drawn owing to poor weather, but England&#x27;s revival continued in the next game, which was drawn with England in a dominant position. The final match was also drawn, but while England lost the series 1–0, critics believed the team had recovered from a poor start to the summer and held the ascendancy in the final three games. MacLaren&#x27;s only score over fifty was that in the second Test, and he finished the series with 164 runs at 32.80. In all first-class cricket, he made 814 runs at 32.56, including two centuries against Yorkshire.

===Full-time cricketer===
In late 1899, MacLaren joined a private cricket tour of America and Canada organised by the cricket-playing Indian prince Ranjitsinhji. The following March, he was appointed as an assistant secretary at Lancashire. The position was a sinecure; his main role was to coach the first eleven which effectively meant that he was paid to play cricket, despite his amateur status. Surviving records do not indicate his salary, but some sources suggest he was paid comfortably more than Lancashire&#x27;s leading professionals. In addition, MacLaren worked as a journalist for the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, reporting on matches in which he played, a common practice at the time for amateurs. Resuming sole control over the Lancashire side, and freed from his teaching responsibilities, MacLaren played from the beginning of the 1900 season, planning meticulously in a bid to lead Lancashire to the County Championship. His batting form suffered initially, but the team dominated the start of the season. Commentators gave much of the credit to MacLaren&#x27;s captaincy. However, he was severely criticised for conservative tactics in one game, when he was reluctant to attempt to force a win. In the latter stages of the season, MacLaren scored prolifically, making a succession of high scores at rapid pace. He ended the 1900 season with 1,554 runs at 36.13. During that season, the leading Lancashire bowler Arthur Mold had been no-balled for throwing, but MacLaren defended him in the press. At a meeting of county captains in December, MacLaren was the only representative to defend the legality of Mold&#x27;s bowling action, and in 1901, Mold was again no-balled and his career was effectively over. MacLaren struggled with injury in 1901, and his batting form suffered. He frequently dropped low in the batting order, and it was late in the season before he began to score runs regularly. His captaincy was criticised after some tactical decisions which were either unconventional or unsuccessful, and he clashed with the Lancashire committee over the poor state of Old Trafford&#x27;s pitch. In total, he scored 1,069 first-class runs at 31.44.
MacLaren was invited by the Melbourne Cricket Club to bring a team to Australia during the English winter of 1901–02. This was the last privately organised team to represent England at Test level in Australia, with subsequent ones playing under the colours of the MCC. Many leading players were unavailable—Yorkshire&#x27;s Wilfred Rhodes and George Hirst were not permitted to tour by their captain Lord Hawke. The team was judged to be weak, but contained several players at the beginning of their careers who went on to success at Test level. Sydney Barnes was chosen by MacLaren after playing only a handful of county matches. Barnes&#x27; success on his single appearance for Lancashire in 1901 convinced MacLaren of his worth, to the surprise and disparagement of commentators, most of whom had never seen him. Barnes began the tour well, but did not get on with his captain. During a storm on part of the sea journey, MacLaren, speculating on their chances of survival, commented to a team member: &quot;If we go down, at least that bugger Barnes will go down with us.&quot; The team lost their first match and continued to struggle. MacLaren clashed with authorities in Melbourne over his right to choose an umpire, but he began to bat well at Sydney, where he scored 145 and 73 in a tour match.

In the first Test, MacLaren shared a century opening partnership with Tom Hayward and scored 116 to become the first man to score four Test centuries. This was the last Test century by an England captain in Australia for 57 years. Barnes bowled with great success; Colin Blythe and Len Braund, like Barnes chosen by MacLaren and making their Test debuts, performed effectively and England won by an innings. The remaining four Tests were lost as the team suffered from a lack of effective bowlers. MacLaren severely overbowled Barnes, who took 13 wickets, in the second Test; the bowler was injured in the next game and took no further part on the tour. MacLaren was successful with the bat. He scored 92 in the fourth Test, made centuries in the two first-class games played in between the Test matches, and finished top of the batting averages. Critics judged that his team had performed well despite the heavy defeat, and his captaincy attracted praise. In addition, the team were considered to be the best fielding side to visit Australia. In the Test series, MacLaren scored 412 runs at 45.77, while in all first-class matches he hit 929 runs at 58.06.

Before the tour began, MacLaren resigned as Lancashire&#x27;s captain and assistant secretary, owing to his concern for the health of his wife. Journalists speculated that MacLaren would join the Hampshire team as assistant secretary, as he lived in that county, or even move to Australia. Lancashire selected a replacement captain, but when MacLaren returned to England, he re-committed to the club, stating the visit to Australia had improved the health of his wife, and he was reappointed.

===Ashes series of 1902===
MacLaren began the 1902 season well and, facing an Ashes series against Australia, began planning for the Tests; he arranged to receive reports on prospective players from both sides. England dominated the first Test, scoring 376 and bowling Australia out for 36; rain prevented a result and also heavily curtailed the drawn second Test. The team for the third Test, played in Sheffield, was to be chosen from 12 players picked by the selectors, with the final place contested between Bill Lockwood and Schofield Haigh. However, on the morning of the match, MacLaren, with the approval of the selector Lord Hawke, summoned Barnes from Manchester to play instead of either. The move was unpopular with spectators—their favoured choice, Haigh, was a Yorkshire player—but Barnes took six wickets in the first innings, although injury reduced his effectiveness in the second innings. England were bowled out in poor light—MacLaren&#x27;s biographer Michael Down suggests that part of the blame lies with him for not appealing against the light—and needed an unlikely 339 runs to win in their second innings. MacLaren changed the batting order, asking Gilbert Jessop to open the batting. Jessop scored fifty, and MacLaren scored 63, but England lost by 143 runs.

Following the defeat, the England selectors made several changes for the fourth Test; both Barnes and Jessop were left out. MacLaren favoured Jessop&#x27;s inclusion but the selectors considered him unreliable. Although Barnes was not fully fit, later commentators suggested the selectors omitted him because of MacLaren&#x27;s actions at Sheffield. A further player was added to the squad in case the pitch was affected by rain before the match, but rather than choosing Haigh, the leading wet-pitch bowler in the country, Hawke insisted that Sussex&#x27;s Fred Tate was included—critics have suggested that Hawke wanted to prevent Haigh&#x27;s absence from the Yorkshire team, of which Hawke was captain, given the unlikeliness of the extra bowler being needed. According to the cricket writer Neville Cardus, when MacLaren saw the list of players in the team, he responded: &quot;My God, look what they&#x27;ve sent me&quot;. MacLaren was angry with Hawke, and when it rained before the match, included Tate in the final eleven at the expense of George Hirst, a leading all-rounder. Gibson suggests that Tate was included by the selectors only &quot;because they thought MacLaren could not possibly pick him&quot; and so he could not make any further late changes to the team; MacLaren, according to Gibson, in turn included Tate out of spite. Other writers have suggested that MacLaren, as a Lancastrian, preferred a Sussex player to a Yorkshire one.

Australia won the toss. The match began in damp conditions, and before the pitch began to dry, at which point it would become extremely difficult for batting, the Australian opening batsmen scored 135 in 90 minutes; Australia&#x27;s total reached 173 for one wicket at lunch, and Victor Trumper scored a century in that time. MacLaren was subsequently criticised for allowing Australia to score so quickly, but claimed that his carefully planned strategy was rendered obsolete when Trumper began to strike the ball out of the ground. MacLaren commented: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t very well have had a man fielding in the bloody practice ground, now could I?&quot; The bowlers recovered the situation to some extent, and following a century from Jackson, England trailed by 37 runs after the first innings. In the second innings, Australia collapsed to the England bowlers, but Tate dropped a crucial catch while stationed by MacLaren at the edge of the field. MacLaren also received criticism for this, as Tate was unaccustomed to fielding on the boundary. Gibson notes that MacLaren &quot;later spent much breath defending himself on this point&quot;; although it is not clear how Tate came to be moved—a later interpretation is that MacLaren moved Tate there rather than ask an amateur player to cross the field for a few deliveries—most commentators agree that this was the turning point of the match. England were left needing 124 runs to win. MacLaren opened the batting, having batted at number four in the first innings, and tried to score quickly, but was caught from a big hit. According to Gibson, he returned to the dressing room in fury, throwing his bat across the room and saying that he had &quot;thrown away the match and the bloody rubber [series]&quot;. Gibson suggests that the implication that only MacLaren could have guided England to victory must have had a demoralising effect on the remaining batsmen, and speculates that he felt guilty over the composition of a team that looked likely to lose. Gibson comments: &quot;This does not say much for MacLaren as a captain. Indeed, it has always seemed to me a shocking performance, from the choice of the team to the chuck of the bat.&quot; Wickets continued to fall and Tate, the last batsman, was bowled when England needed four runs to win.

England won the final match by one wicket, but lost the series 2–1. While contemporary critics did not blame MacLaren, the cricket authorities were less happy. MacLaren believed that the choices of the selectors had made it impossible to win, and continued to write about the series for many years. He finished the series with 198 runs at 28.28, and ended the season with 1,254 first-class runs at 32.15.

==Cricketing decline==

===Replacement as England captain===

MacLaren took a new job with a wine merchant which allowed him to complete a full season in 1903. Wet weather caused many difficult pitches for batting, and MacLaren was often the only Lancashire batsman able to cope with the conditions. His highest-profile success came when he captained the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord&#x27;s. When his team faced defeat on the final day on a difficult pitch, he scored 168 not out and shared a partnership of 309 with C. B. Fry in less than three hours. This innings was later praised as one of his finest. He ended the season with 1,886 runs at 42.86, and Lancashire finished fourth. However, his success with the bat was overshadowed by controversy over the England captaincy. MacLaren originally planned to tour Australia with another private team in the winter of 1903–04, but withdrew over his concerns that there was not enough strong bowling available. Frustrated with MacLaren, the cricket authorities in Melbourne asked the MCC, via Pelham Warner, to organise their own team. MacLaren was not offered the captaincy—Warner was chosen in June 1903 when Jackson proved unavailable. Newspaper rumours suggested that Lord Hawke played a part in this decision, and that MacLaren&#x27;s recent paid role for Lancashire counted against him. The press favoured MacLaren, and Warner was widely criticised; one journal noted that he was &quot;condemned as an interloper and a nonentity&quot;. The cricket establishment was less sympathetic to MacLaren. After publicly vacillating over the summer, he eventually decided not to tour under Warner, whom he perceived to be his junior. The tour proved a great success for Warner, and his team won the Test series.

In 1904, MacLaren led Lancashire to victory in the County Championship, their only such success under his captaincy. Unusually for a Championship-winning team, the club relied heavily on batting rather than bowling. MacLaren played several big innings, scoring at a rapid pace, as his team began the season with a string of victories. Their form faded later in the season, but they remained unbeaten. In all first-class cricket, MacLaren scored 1,191 runs at 31.34. At some point during the season, he was asked by Ranjitsinhji, a close friend, to become his private secretary, and both men travelled to India during the winter of 1904–05. Ranjitsinhji at the time was pursuing his claim to the throne of Nawanagar, and he remained in India when MacLaren returned to England for the 1905 cricket season.

The Australians toured England in 1905, but MacLaren was again passed over for the England captaincy; the team was captained by Jackson and won the series 2–0. MacLaren began the season well and played in the first Test. Australia led by 25 runs after the first innings, as England struggled to play the pace of Albert Cotter. According to a story later told by Neville Cardus, before the second innings he saw MacLaren muttering: &quot;Cotter! I&#x27;ll bloody Cotter him!&quot;. MacLaren attacked Cotter&#x27;s bowling, and overcame the defensive bowling tactics used by Australia to slow down the game. He scored 140, his highest Test innings and only Test century in England. When Australia batted, Bernard Bosanquet took eight wickets to bowl England to a win; it was MacLaren&#x27;s suggestion that Jackson persist with Bosanquet&#x27;s bowling when it was initially unsuccessful. MacLaren scored 56 and 79 in the drawn second Test, but did not play in the third owing to injury. He played in the final two Tests but accomplished little. In the series, he scored 303 runs at 43.28. Jackson later wrote that MacLaren was an invaluable tactical aid during the series. Lancashire ended the season second in the Championship, and opened a testimonial fund for MacLaren which raised over £800 by the end of the season. He later clashed with committee members who were unhappy with his decision to use the money to buy a motor car. At the end of the season, MacLaren resigned the captaincy of Lancashire, but was persuaded to continue by the committee. In total during 1905, he scored 1,522 runs at an average of 35.39 in all first-class cricket.

===Private secretary to Ranjitsinhji===
A combination of injuries and work reduced the amount of cricket MacLaren played after 1905. He missed most of Lancashire&#x27;s matches in June and July 1906. He returned against Middlesex at Lord&#x27;s in August, but was involved in mild controversy when he declined to put Middlesex&#x27;s batsmen under pressure when chasing a small but challenging total to win the game; this may have arisen from his dislike of Lord&#x27;s and the figures in authority there. MacLaren ended the 1906 season with 599 runs at 20.65. In the winter of 1906–07, MacLaren returned to India to work for Ranjitsinhji. In January 1907, he wrote to Lancashire to inform them of his reduced availability for 1907; even so, the committee retained him as captain. In February, Ranjitsinhji was named as the new ruler of Nawanagar. MacLaren attended his installation on 11 March—MacLaren and the politician Arthur Priestley were the only English attendees—and did not return to England until mid-June, although he informed Lancashire that his absence in India was to recover from an illness. He resumed the captaincy of Lancashire, and made a good start with scores of 47 and 92 in his second match, but his form faded. One match provoked a public row between MacLaren and Lord&#x27;s. MacLaren captained Lancashire against Middlesex at Lord&#x27;s in July; rain restricted play on the first day of the three-day game, and at the start of the second day, the umpires ruled that the waterlogged pitch remained unfit to play on. Some spectators came on to the pitch to look for themselves, then protested outside the pavilion. The incident was defused by the ground authorities, but the following day MacLaren told the press: &quot;Owing to the pitch having been deliberately torn up by the public, I, as captain of the Lancashire eleven, cannot see my way to continue the game, the groundsman bearing me out that the wicket [pitch] could not be again put right.&quot; Lancashire would not play—although all decisions about fitness for play should have been made by the umpires, not MacLaren—and the match was drawn. The incident provoked discussion in the press, but most critics agreed that MacLaren was in the wrong. MacLaren subsequently scored his first century for two years, but he did little in the remainder of the season, at the end of which he again resigned the captaincy of Lancashire, conscious of his failing form and fitness. In all first-class cricket in 1907, he scored 829 runs at 26.74.

Much of MacLaren&#x27;s time was now taken up working for Ranjitsinhji, who visited England between October 1907 and December 1908. MacLaren played just nine matches in 1908; Lancashire were eager for him to play, but he had little impact. His greatest success came for the Gentlemen against the Players at the Oval, when he shared a partnership of 141 with C. B. Fry. In total, he scored 428 runs at an average of 28.53. Meanwhile, Ranjitsinhji lived extravagantly in Sussex, running up huge bills and ignoring most attempts to make him pay. MacLaren was involved in several cases which resulted in either legal action or complaint to the India Office. When an artist had to go to court to make Ranjitsinhji pay for work she had done, MacLaren&#x27;s attempts to delay and obstruct her caused the India Office, in its adjudication, to describe him as Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s &quot;ridiculous private secretary&quot;. In October, MacLaren was taken to court himself over non-payment of rent. He had a house close to Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s residence, and claimed in court that Ranjitsinhji rented the house on his behalf, and, as a ruling prince, could not be prosecuted. The magistrates disagreed, ruled MacLaren liable, and forced him to pay—although Ranjitsinhji probably paid for him.

In his biography of Ranjitsinhji, Simon Wilde suggests that MacLaren had to work very hard for his employer in this period, and found little time for cricket. In addition, his batting form was poor throughout, and he seemed to be in bad physical condition when he occasionally found time to play. Before Ranjitsinhji returned to India, MacLaren resigned as his secretary—although he went with him to India for a holiday. According to Wilde, the resignation was to allow MacLaren to play more regularly, but &quot;he never really recovered his form&quot;. In summarising Ranjitsinhji&#x27;s life at this time, Wilde suggests that his unreliability with money was quite calculated, and writes: &quot;Many of his off-the-field exploits with A. C. MacLaren ... will probably never be known, but it seems clear that sometimes they were not averse to conducting themselves in the fashion of E. W. Hornung&#x27;s fictional character Raffles, the cricketing burglar.&quot;

===Return as England captain===
For the 1909 season, MacLaren worked to improve his fitness prior to that summer&#x27;s Test series against Australia. Jackson was first choice to lead the England team, but when he was unavailable, MacLaren was appointed captain, to the approval of critics and the public. MacLaren began the season well for Lancashire, and as Australia struggled in their early tour matches, England began the Tests as favourites to win. England won the low-scoring first match; the press praised MacLaren&#x27;s deployment of fielders.
In England&#x27;s second innings Jack Hobbs, batting with Fry—whom MacLaren promoted to open the batting having done so himself in the first innings—scored the required runs to complete a ten-wicket win. Hobbs was making his first Test appearance in England, despite MacLaren&#x27;s reluctance to include him in the team.

The England selectors made several changes to the team for the second Test. Colin Blythe, a crucial bowler to the team, withdrew before the game. Other players were left out whom most commentators believed should have played, and the bowling attack was packed with medium-paced bowlers of a similar style. The report in &quot;Wisden&quot; suggested: &quot;Never in the history of Test Matches in England has there been such blundering in the selection of an England eleven&quot;. The selectors later implied the controversial choices were at the behest of MacLaren, although other evidence suggests that MacLaren did not get the team he requested. England lost the game; MacLaren&#x27;s reputation suffered and commentators began to blame him for the defeat. He offered his resignation, but the selectors retained him as captain and restored some of the players omitted from the second Test. When England lost the third Test after the batsmen failed, not helped by MacLaren&#x27;s poor form, critics questioned his place in the team. MacLaren tried to excuse his position, suggesting in the press that he knew the team would struggle and played &quot;in spite of my personal wishes&quot;. He also implied that the team&#x27;s selection was out of his hands. When the fourth Test was rained off, England could not win the series and so Australia retained the Ashes.

The final match of the series was drawn, mainly because the pitch heavily favoured batting. MacLaren was involved in another selection controversy when the fast bowler Claude Buckenham was left out of the England team at his instigation. The &quot;Wisden&quot; match report described this decision as &quot;so grave a blunder that it is difficult to find words in which to speak of it.&quot; The &quot;Wisden&quot; editor, Sydney Pardon, commented: &quot;A fatal blunder was committed in leaving out Buckenham—a blunder for which it was generally understood that MacLaren was responsible. Experts occasionally do strange things and this was one of the strangest. The idea of letting England go into the field in fine weather, on a typical Oval wicket, with no fast bowler except Sharp touched the confines of lunacy.&quot; Further issues arose over MacLaren&#x27;s handling of his bowlers, and &quot;Wisden&quot; suggested &quot;MacLaren was sadly at fault in his management of the England bowling&quot;. Douglas Carr, a 37-year-old, was called into the team after some success in preceding games and on the premise that the Australians would be unable to play his googly. After Carr had initial success, MacLaren kept him bowling for a long period until the player tired and was easily punished by the batsmen. In his only innings, MacLaren scored 12, and when the match ended, much of the blame for England&#x27;s failures was apportioned to him. In the series, he scored 85 runs at 12.14. The Oval match was his final Test match; in 35 games he had scored 1,931 runs at 33.87. He ended the season with 613 runs at 19.77.

===Retirement from regular cricket===
MacLaren played regularly for Lancashire at the start of 1910, but his poor form continued until midway through the season, when he scored centuries in successive matches. He played once more for Lancashire and once for the &quot;Gentlemen of England&quot; before withdrawing from first-class cricket for the season, in which he scored 345 runs at 26.53. This was effectively the end of his Lancashire career and he played only sporadically for the team afterwards. He continued to play cricket, including a tour of Argentina with the MCC in 1910–11. He also played for the team of the businessman Lionel Robinson, including some first-class games, over the following seasons. During the 1914 season, MacLaren attempted to return to the Lancashire team, possibly to boost the circulation of a magazine for which he was writing. He appeared in one county match, without success, although he continued to play in other first-class games for the MCC and other teams.

==Later career==

===Final cricket matches===

After MacLaren stopped playing regularly for Lancashire, he formed a business partnership with J. N. Pentelow, a cricket writer. Pentelow was the owner of &quot;The World of Cricket&quot;, a cricket magazine, and in 1914 MacLaren joined him in an attempt to improve its circulation. MacLaren was officially known as the editor of the publication and Pentelow his assistant, but the latter did most of the work. Pentelow was already struggling to keep the magazine going, but matters worsened after MacLaren joined. Pentelow&#x27;s debts increased and by the end of 1914, the business folded; although details are obscure, Down suggests that &quot;MacLaren&#x27;s characteristic unreliability with money left Pentelow very much in the lurch.&quot;

During the First World War, MacLaren joined the Royal Army Service Corps as a lieutenant and worked in the Manchester area recruiting men into the army. He was promoted to captain before leaving the Army on health grounds. After the war, he was employed as cricket manager for Lionel Robinson and wrote for various newspapers and cricket publications. MacLaren and his family lived for a time on Robinson&#x27;s estate when their financial situation was poor. He advised Robinson on the best way to prepare cricket pitches and to organise matches which might bring about Robinson&#x27;s greater acceptance in society. As part of this process, MacLaren arranged for the 1921 Australian touring team to play at Robinson&#x27;s cricket ground against a team selected and captained by MacLaren himself. The Australians struggled against MacLaren&#x27;s team, but went on to dominate the Test matches against England; MacLaren insisted throughout the summer that the Australian team was not as strong as it appeared, and that younger English players should be chosen. Eastbourne Cricket Club invited him to captain a team named &quot;An England XI&quot; against the tourists following the conclusion of the Tests. He was dismissed by critics when he claimed that he could beat the Australian team; prior to the game, the Australians were undefeated on the tour and had won 22 of their 36 games. MacLaren planned meticulously for the match; he chose an all-amateur team, selecting spin bowlers noted for their reliability and excellent fielders. Although bowled out for 43 in their first innings, MacLaren&#x27;s team came back strongly to win by 28 runs, the touring team&#x27;s first defeat, although his batting contribution was slight.

===Coach and senior figure===
Lancashire appointed MacLaren as coach for the 1922 season, to popular acclaim; he also captained the Lancashire second team. Even before he began work, his poor financial situation forced him to request two advances on his salary. As a coach, MacLaren was autocratic and demanding, but encouraged the players to think for themselves. He was unpopular with some players and clashed frequently with the Lancashire committee. During the winter of 1922–23, the MCC organised two cricket tours—a Test playing tour to South Africa and a tour to Australia and New Zealand intended to give experience to young, promising cricketers. MacLaren was chosen to captain the latter team on account of his experience and his success with young cricketers during his win over the Australians in 1921. He was given a good reception by the crowds when he played and press reports praised his tactical awareness. The team was undefeated in matches in New Zealand. Against the full New Zealand team, MacLaren scored 200 not out in 264 minutes in his final first-class innings; the effort placed a strain on his knee and he was unable to play again on the tour. He ended his first-class career with 22,236 runs at an average of 34.15.

When the team returned to play more matches in Australia, MacLaren became involved in controversy for criticising the standards of play in New Zealand and for comments made in the press there. He also queried the first-class status of Bill Ponsford&#x27;s record innings of 429, scored against Tasmania. On the journey home, MacLaren sent a message to Lancashire asking for more money; the committee declined to send the sum and shortly afterwards terminated his contract as coach. Lancashire told the press that MacLaren&#x27;s knee injury meant that he could not continue.

===Final years===
In the following years, MacLaren and his family struggled financially. His wife&#x27;s family sometimes sent money, but MacLaren often spent extravagantly whenever he had funds. On one occasion, when paid for writing an article, he moved out of his accommodation into an expensive hotel, and threw a dinner party for his friends. He ran up many debts—including an unpaid champagne bill at Old Trafford Cricket Ground in 1923—and borrowed money from friends. He supplemented his wife&#x27;s income through working as a journalist and a coach. Among other business ventures, he designed a cricket bat, showed specially shot cricket films, briefly owned a hotel and attempted to start a horse bloodstock agency. He continued to play club cricket and in 1924–25 he managed a privately organised tour of South Africa.

Shortly before the Second World War, MacLaren&#x27;s wife inherited a large sum of money which enabled them to live in comfort. They bought an estate at Warfield Park near Bracknell in Berkshire and the couple were able to live in the extravagant manner he had always wanted. Around this time, on a visit to America, MacLaren made a brief appearance in the Hollywood film &quot;The Four Feathers&quot;, which starred his friend, former cricketer C. Aubrey Smith. In the 1940s, his health began to fail. He was hurt in a car crash and then contracted cancer. He died on 17 November 1944, aged 72; his wife died a few months later.

==Style, technique and captaincy==

MacLaren&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; stated that he was &quot;one of the outstanding opening batsmen of all time&quot;. As a batsman, he had a reputation for stylishness, but his technique was based on scoring runs safely. He always tried to seize the initiative in a game. Batting with his head slightly raised, he drew his bat back unusually far, which provided the power to his shots, and in particular his drives. He scored runs quickly, mainly through his ability to score from good length balls. When playing a shot, he either stepped right forward or moved far back in the batting crease and having hit the ball, he followed through with the bat, often holding his pose for effect. These qualities, and his quick footwork, made him effective on difficult batting pitches. One of his most highly regarded shots was the hook. In later years, Cardus described the shot: &quot;To see MacLaren hook a fast ball ... from the front of his face, was in those days an experience which thrilled me like heroic poetry; he didn&#x27;t merely hook the ball, he dismissed it from his presence.&quot; Cardus, for whom MacLaren was a boyhood hero, wrote prolifically about him in later years; he called one such essay on MacLaren &quot;The Noblest Roman&quot;, and judged him among the best of all batsmen. Gideon Haigh suggests: &quot;If ever a cricketer was the creation of a single writer, it is MacLaren, the luminous majesty with which he is associated owed in very large degree to his youthful acolyte Neville Cardus.&quot; MacLaren was also a highly proficient fielder, initially in the outfield but later at slip.

Critics have looked less favourably on MacLaren as a captain. When he assumed the leadership of England, the press were reporting on the tactical performance of captains for the first time. MacLaren was among the first captains to study tactics. However, judgements on his effectiveness have varied greatly. For most of his career, he was regarded as an excellent captain. Contemporaries praised his tactical awareness; he planned minutely, and organised his fields extremely carefully to prevent batsmen scoring through blocking their favourite shots, a technique practically unheard of at the time. He liked to alter the batting order, a tactic which often divides critics, although it frequently succeeded for MacLaren. He was less successful in managing his team. Regarded as a pessimist, he openly showed disappointment at the composition of his sides, and became downcast when the course of the match was running against him. Some of those who played under him thought that his sides were unhappy ones which operated without joy and solely concentrated on winning. He encountered many difficulties over selection; he often promoted cricketers whom he considered to show potential and consequently railed against committees which did not provide him with the players he wanted. Down suggests that MacLaren was usually correct, being more experienced and a better judge than most of those who chose the teams. Peter Wynne-Thomas describes MacLaren&#x27;s approach to selection as &quot;unorthodox&quot;, and writes that while his ideas were sometimes successful, they failed badly at other times. Apart from his own failings, MacLaren had a reputation as an unlucky captain, both in terms of losing important players to injury and illness before vital games, and in the frequency with which he lost the toss before a match. Nor was MacLaren particularly popular; in later years, several people for whom he had been a hero changed their opinion once they met him.

In his history of the club, Peter Wynne-Thomas describes MacLaren as the dominant figure in Lancashire cricket from his debut until the First World War. Gibson accepts that MacLaren was tactically a good captain, but observes that in his 12 seasons as leader of a strong Lancashire team, he only once won the County Championship. In addition, as the appointed captain in four series against Australia, he was beaten in each one, something no other England captain has repeated. Gibson suggests that &quot;the excuses begin to run thin, sieved through such a tale of failure.&quot; Gibson summarises that &quot;England under MacLaren must have been a good side to watch, save for the passionate partisans, but an uncomfortable side in which to play ... Bad captain or no, with no doubt ... MacLaren was one of the most entrancing, one of the most glamorous—though that word had not come into fashion in his day—characters of his cricketing epoch.&quot;

<text>KXLN-DT (channel 45) is a television station licensed to Rosenberg, Texas, United States, serving as the Houston-area outlet for the Spanish-language network Univision. It is owned and operated by TelevisaUnivision alongside Alvin-licensed UniMás station KFTH-DT (channel 67). The two stations share studios near the Southwest Freeway (adjacent to the I-610/I-69 interchange) on Houston&#x27;s southwest side; KXLN-DT&#x27;s transmitter is located near Missouri City, in unincorporated northeastern Fort Bend County.

In addition to its own digital signal, KXLN is simulcast in high definition on KFTH&#x27;s fifth digital subchannel (67.5) from a separate transmitter near Missouri City.

==History==
The earliest attempt at launching channel 45 was in 1968, when the Overmyer Network/United planned to launch the station as KJDO-TV.

In February 1980, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) designated three applications seeking channel 45 in Rosenberg for hearing. Trinity Broadcasting of Texas dropped out in 1981, leaving two combatants for the channel. Pueblo Broadcasting, owned by businessmen A.C. Peña and J. Adán Treviño, proposed the construction of Houston&#x27;s first full-time Spanish-language outlet; previously, KRIV, an English-language independent, had carried some Spanish programming from the Spanish International Network, Univision&#x27;s predecessor, or adjacent to prime time. The bid had initially been prepared because SIN was interested in a station in the market and had approached local Hispanics to put together an application. The other applicant was Texas 45 Broadcasting, a subsidiary of Chicago-based Weigel Broadcasting.

The comparative hearings ended up examining Weigel&#x27;s bid, more specifically issues added as to whether Weigel had misrepresented the coverage area of its only TV station, WCIU-TV, on maps it gave to prospective advertisers. In 1984, administrative law judge Edward Luton found Weigel qualified to be a licensee but also gave Pueblo the nod based on its lack of substantive broadcast interests, compared to the one station owned by Weigel, and a superior proposal for integration of management. That same year, on August 2, Pueblo signed on a translator for SIN on channel 45 (K45AK), which it had separately filed for in 1979. Plans were then made to build the full-power facility, which began broadcasting on September 16, 1987. The station originally operated from studio facilities located at 9440 Kirby Drive, near the Astrodome; it moved down the road in 1989.

KXLN was immediately profitable: by 1990, sales reached $6 million a year. It was the fastest-growing Hispanic business in the entire United States between 1984 and 1988, according to &quot;Hispanic Business&quot; magazine. Univision bought KXLN from Pueblo in 1994 for $20 million.

Univision Communications acquired channel 67, then KHSH-TV, from USA Broadcasting in 2000; that station became the Houston charter station of Univision&#x27;s new secondary network, Telefutura (which was rebranded as UniMás in January 2013) when it launched in January 2002. Later that year, Univision, in a multimillion-dollar purchase, bought a six-story building in Houston&#x27;s Uptown district to serve as the studio facilities for KXLN, KFTH and several Univision-owned radio stations in the Houston area. The Univision-owned local properties moved into the building in 2006.

On January 26, 2019, KXLN changed frequencies from RF channel 45 to RF channel 30 as part of the FCC&#x27;s spectrum repack.

==News operation==
In 1988, KXLN began producing news updates during Univision prime-time programming; two years later, the station began producing a 6 p.m. newscast. In 1993, KXLN debuted Houston&#x27;s first Spanish-language morning news program, , as well as an innovative late evening newscast called . Ratings success was quick to follow; the station attracted more younger viewers than KPRC-TV by 2001.

On March 27, 2015, the station axed its morning newscast along with the local UniMás show for a regionalized morning newscast titled that would air on Univision stations in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Austin. Univision restored separate morning newscasts to the four Texas stations in 2019.

The Univision building in Houston houses a weather center, opened in 2017, that supplies the company&#x27;s broadcast stations and digital platforms nationwide with weather information and forecasts.

===Notable on-air staff===
* Martin Berlanga – reporter
* Raul Peimbert – anchor

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

KXLN-DT transmits one of KTXH&#x27;s subchannels under Houston&#x27;s ATSC 3.0 (NextGen TV) deployment plan; in turn, KXLN is available in that format on the KTXH multiplex.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KXLN-DT (as KXLN-TV) ended regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 45, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 46 to channel 45 for post-transition operations.

Eleven days later, all Univision owned-and-operated stations, including KXLN, permanently added a &quot;-DT&quot; suffix to their call signs.

<text>Clinical pharmacology is &quot;that discipline that teaches, does research, frames policy, gives information and advice about the actions and proper uses of medicines in humans and implements that knowledge in clinical practice&quot;. Clinical pharmacology is inherently a translational discipline underpinned by the basic science of pharmacology, engaged in the experimental and observational study of the disposition and effects of drugs in humans, and committed to the translation of science into evidence-based therapeutics. It has a broad scope, from the discovery of new target molecules to the effects of drug usage in whole populations. The main aim of clinical pharmacology is to generate data for optimum use of drugs and the practice of &#x27;evidence-based medicine&#x27;.

Clinical pharmacologists have medical and scientific training that enables them to evaluate evidence and produce new data through well-designed studies. Clinical pharmacologists must have access to enough patients for clinical care, teaching and education, and research. Their responsibilities to patients include, but are not limited to, detecting and analysing adverse drug effects and reactions, therapeutics, and toxicology including reproductive toxicology, perioperative drug management, and psychopharmacology.

Modern clinical pharmacologists are also trained in data analysis skills. Their approaches to analyse data can include modelling and simulation techniques (e.g. population analysis, non-linear mixed-effects modelling).

==Branches==
Clinical pharmacology consists of multiple branches listed below:
*Pharmacodynamics – what drugs do to the body and how. This includes not just the cellular and molecular aspects, but also more relevant clinical measurements. For example, not just the pharmacological actions of salbutamol, a beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist, but the respiratory peak flow rate of both healthy volunteers and patients.
*Pharmacokinetics – what happens to the drug while in the body. This involves the body systems for handling the drug, usually divided into the following classification:
** Absorption – the processes by which the drug move into the bloodstream from the site of administration (e.g. the gut)
** Distribution – the extent to which the drug enters and leaves different tissues of the body
** Metabolism – the processes by which the drug is metabolized in the liver, i.e. transformed into molecules that are usually less pharmacologically active
** Excretion – the processes by which the drug is eliminated from the body, which mostly happens in the liver and kidneys.
*Rational Prescribing – using the right medication, in the right dose, using the right route and frequency of administration, and for the right duration of time.
*Adverse drug effects – unwanted effects of a medicine that are typically not noticed by the individual (e.g. a reduction in the white cell count or a change in the serum uric acid concentration)
*Adverse drug reactions – unwanted effects of the drug that the individual experiences (e.g. a sore throat because of a reduced white cell count or an attack of gout because of an increased serum uric acid concentration) 
*Toxicology – the discipline that deals with the adverse effects of chemicals
*Drug interactions – the study of how drugs interact with each other. A drug may negatively or positively affect the effects of another drug; drugs can also interact with other agents, such as foods, alcohol, and devices.
*Drug development – the processes of bringing a new medicine from its discovery to clinical use, usually culminating in some form of clinical trials and marketing authorization applications to country-specific drug regulators, such as the US FDA and the UK&#x27;s MHRA.
*Molecular pharmacology – the discipline of studying drug actions at the molecular level; it is a branch of pharmacology in general.
*Pharmacogenomics – the study of the human genome in order to understand the ways in which genetic factors determine the actions of medicines.

== History ==
Medicinal uses of plant and animal resources have been common since prehistoric times. Many countries, such as China, Egypt, and India, have written documentation of many traditional remedies. A few of these remedies are still regarded as helpful today, but most have them have been discarded, because they were ineffective and potentially harmful.

For many years, therapeutic practices were based on Hippocratic humoral theory, popularized by the Greek physician Galen (129 – c. AD 216) and not on experimentation.

In around the 17th century physicians started to apply use methods to study traditional remedies, although they still lacked methods to test the hypotheses they had about how drugs worked.

By the late 18th century and early 19th century, methods of experimental physiology and pharmacology began to be developed by scientists such as François Magendie and his student Claude Bernard.

From the late 18th century to the early 20th century, advances were made in chemistry and physiology that laid the foundations needed to understand how drugs act at the tissue and organ levels. The advances that were made at this time gave manufacturers the ability to make and sell medicines that they claimed to be effective, but were in many cases worthless. There were no methods for evaluating such claims until rational therapeutic concepts were established in medicine, starting at about the end of the 19th century.

The development of receptor theory at the start of the 20th century and later developments led to better understanding of how medicines act and the development of many new medicines that are both safe and effective. Expansion of the scientific principles of pharmacology and clinical pharmacology continues today.

<text>Daegu National University of Education, commonly abbreviated as Daegu-gyodae () in Korean, is one of the National Universities of Education which provides training courses for preliminary teachers in the public primary schools of South Korea.

Founded in 1950, DNUE was previously called Daegu Normal School. Its first president was Kim Young-gi (). In 1963, it was renamed Daegu Gyoyuk Dae. It concentrated on primary school education, not including secondary school courses. Its most recent name change was in 1993, when the school adopted the name it uses today. Nam Seung-in () has been its president since 2011. About 85 instructors are employed by the university.

==History==

Daegu National University of Education (DNUE) opened as Daegu Normal School in 1950, though its origins can be traced back to 1923, when Daegu Sabeom Haggyo (大邱師範學敎, 大邱师范学校) was established by the Japanese Government-General of Korea for training school instructors.

The university has always been under national control. It officially began as Daegu Normal School (대구사범학교) in 1950. In 1962, it was briefly attached to Kyungpook National University as a two-year college, but the institutions were separated again the following year. It became a four-year college in 1982 and a university in 1993. The graduate school was established in November 1995.

The university has had various name changes to gratify social needs.

=== Pre-established ===

The university was known as Daegu Sabeom Haggyo from 1923 to 1946, with some variations.
* Gonglib Daegu Sabeom Haggyo (公立大邱師範學敎, 공립대구사범학교) (1923–1929) – established by the government, but operated by the local government
* Guanlib Daegu Sabeom Haggyo (官立大邱師範學敎, 관립대구사범학교) (1929–1944) – operated by the government
* Daegu Sabeom Haggyo (大邱師範學敎, 대구사범학교) (1944) – considered a special college

The name was changed to Daegu Normal University when two similar schools were merged.
* Daegu Sabeom Daehak (大邱師範大學, 대구사범대학) (1946) – considered a college of Kyungpook National University
* Dolib Gyeongsangbuk-do Chodeung-gyowon Yangseongso (道立慶尙北道初等敎員養成所, 도립경상북도초등교원양성소) (established in 1949) – a training school for elementary school teachers operated by the Gyeongsangbuk-do government

=== Establishment ===
The school has been known as Daegu National University of Education since 1950.
* Daegu Gonglib Sabeom Haggyo (大邱公立師範學敎, 대구공립사범학교) (1950) – Dolib Gyeongsangbuk-do Chodeung-gyowon Yangseongso was merged with Daegu Sabeom Daehak, commonly called Daegu Normal University
* Educational College was annexed by Kyungpook National University (慶北大學校竝設敎育大學, 경북대학교병설교육대학) (1962) with Gim-wiseog as the college principal, 김위석(金渭錫) – two-year college
* Daegu National College of Education (大邱敎育大學, 대구교육대학) (1963) – split with Kyungpook National University
* Daegu National College of Education (大邱敎育大學, 대구교육대학) (1982) – four-year college

<text>The River Neckinger is a reduced subterranean river that rises in Southwark and flows approximately through south London to St Saviour&#x27;s Dock where it enters the Thames. What remains of the river is enclosed and runs underground and most of its narrow catchment has been diverted into other combined and surface water sewers, flowing into the Southern Outfall Sewer and the Thames, respectively.

==Course==

The watercourse drained first the seasonally wet (and occasionally flooded) ground at St George&#x27;s Fields, where the former building of the Bethlem Royal Hospital, now the Imperial War Museum, stands. Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park, in western Southwark. Its course was east as follows: it took the line of Brook Drive then passed by the Elephant and Castle, then passed the site of Lock Hospital, Kent Street. This upper section was also known before that hospital&#x27;s closure in the early 19th century as the Lock Stream. It then runs under abbey street and passed the grounds of (since ruined and underground) Bermondsey Abbey to the south, forming the channel north of what was the large Thames island of Bermond&#x27;s ey (island). The channel is today resembled by Abbey Street. In the first millennium, the river merged into the Thames by hooking north at three points. At least three tidally broadly flooded mouths existed, two of which were west of the former small island of Horsleydown and the third at the approximate site of St Saviour&#x27;s Dock. The Neckinger&#x27;s northern mouth (now a surface water point of discharge into a deep, excavated inlet) divides the much-built up former marshland at the east end of Horsleydown island, known as Shad Thames and the low part of Bermondsey historically known as Jacob&#x27;s Island to the east, which has also been built-up.

==History==
===Etymology===
In the 17th century convicted pirates were hanged at the wharf where the Neckinger entered the Thames. The name of the river is believed to derive from the term &quot;devil&#x27;s neckcloth&quot;, a slang term for the hangman&#x27;s noose. In &quot;London Past and Present&quot;, published in 1891, Henry B. Wheatley argued that there was &#x27;much good evidence&#x27; that &#x27;the &#x27;Devil&#x27;s Neckinger&#x27;... the ancient place of punishment and execution&#x27; was at the site of the &#x27;Dead Tree public-house&#x27; on Jacob&#x27;s Island. Writing in &quot;The Inns of Old Southwark And Their Associations&quot;, in 1888, authors William Rendle and Philip Norman note that a place called &quot;Devol&#x27;s Neckenger&quot; appears on a map in 1740 and, in the same location, in 1813, the Dead Tree inn. 
===Canute&#x27;s Trench===
Historian Walter Besant says the Neckinger&#x27;s early section, where it crosses the Kent Road, at Lock Bridge, was also known as &quot;Canute&#x27;s Trench&quot;. In May, 1016, Danish Cnut the Great, who had invaded England, dug a trench through Southwark to allow his boats to avoid the heavily defended London Bridge. In 1173, a channel following a similar course was used to drain the Thames to allowing building work on London Bridge.

===Middle Ages===
In the 14th century, the crossing point of the Neckinger and the Old Kent Road was known as &quot;the of Seint Thomas&quot;, or &quot;St. Thomas-à-Watering&quot;, and was mentioned by Geoffrey Chaucer in &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; as a place where the pilgrims water their horses on their way to Thomas Becket&#x27;s shrine. In the Tudor period &quot;St. Thomas-à-Watering&quot; was also the location for public executions.

In the 16th century, herbalist and botanist John Gerard wrote of the &quot;wild willow herb&quot; that &#x27;It is found nigh the place of execution at St. Thomas a Watering; and by a style on a Thames bank near to the Devil&#x27;s Neckerchief on the way to Redriffe.&#x27;
During the Middle Ages, the local religious house, Bermondsey Abbey, made use of the water of the Neckinger to power a Tide mill. The mill&#x27;s early name was &quot;Redriff&quot;, also an early name for the present neighbouring district of Rotherhithe, On 31 June 1536, the Abbey leased the mill to John Curlew, but the Dissolution of the Monasteries saw it privately acquired. At this time the Neckinger was navigable from the Thames up to the Abbey grounds.

Local doctor, William Rendle, writing in &quot;Old Southwark And Its People&quot;, in 1878, describes a bridge on the Old Kent Road, dated to the time of Bermondsey Abbey, which was still visible as part of the sewer system in the 19th century. It was &#x27;of a pointed arch of stone with six ribs, similar to the oldest part of the London Bridge and to those of Bow and Eltham. There are, however, no mouldings to the bridge; it was merely chamfered at the edges. Its date may be about the middle of the fifteenth century... The dimensions of the bridge are: width, 20 feet; span of arch, 9 feet.&#x27;

In 1640, the City of London issued an order to &#x27;make up and amend&#x27; the Lock Bridge as part of sewer works. According to Rendle the sewers were built up to adjoin the bridge at each side and it was a familiar landmark to &#x27;sewer people&#x27; in the tunnels. During the 19th century improvements &#x27;the ancient relic was not injured by the new works but necessarily covered up again.

===17th and 18th centuries===
Private homes and businesses began to be built on the former Abbey grounds and the water of the Neckinger attracted tanners to its banks. In the late 1700s competition for the water led to the tanners bringing a suit against the mill owner which was won on the argument of &#x27;ancient usages of the district&#x27; which ensured the inhabitants had the right to a supply of tidal water.

The Jacob&#x27;s Island district was notoriously squalid from early Victorian times until the mid-20th century. It was described by Charles Dickens in 1838 as &quot;the filthiest, the strangest, the most extraordinary of the many localities that are hidden in London&quot;, and by the Morning Chronicle in 1849 as &quot;The very capital of cholera&quot; and &quot;The Venice of drains&quot;. In Dickens&#x27; novel, &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; a branch of the Neckinger is given the name &quot;Folly Ditch&quot; and is the place where the book&#x27;s Bill Sikes meets his death.

In the 1790s &quot;Neckinger Mill&quot; was established to produce paper, which continued until 1805 when the site was sold to the leather manufacturers Bevingtons. In 1838, the construction of a new line for the London and Greenwich Railway divided the mill land into two uneven portions, with further railway works taking place in 1841 and 1850.

===Modern era===
In 1935, Bevingtons moved most of their business to Dartford, keeping the smaller section of their divided site as a warehouse, and selling the larger portion to the Bermondsey Borough Council. When Bevingtons sold the warehouse in early 1980s it was converted into a residential development, and it has since been joined by new blocks of flats, which coexist, with some friction, with the more bohemian houseboats moored offshore at Reed Wharf.

<text>The 55th Coke&#x27;s Rifles (Frontier Force) was a regiment of the British Indian Army. It was raised in 1849 as the 1st Regiment of Punjab Infantry. It was designated as the 55th Coke&#x27;s Rifles (Frontier Force) in 1903 and became 1st Battalion (Coke&#x27;s) 13th Frontier Force Rifles in 1922. In 1947, it was allocated to the Pakistan Army, where it continues to exist as 7th Battalion The [[Frontier Force Regiment]].

==History==
===1849–1880===
The regiment was formed on 18 May 1849 as the 1st Regiment of Punjab Infantry by Captain John Coke. It was one of five such regiments raised by Colonel Henry Lawrence, the agent (and brother) of the Governor-General of the Punjab frontier region, John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence, to form the infantry element of the Trans Frontier Brigade. The men were recruited from veterans of disbanded opposition forces after the British annexation in 1848 of the Punjab during the Second Sikh War. In 1851 the regiment was retitled as the 1st Regiment of Infantry, Punjab Irregular Force when the Trans Frontier Brigade, tasked with policing the volatile North-West Frontier, was expanded and renamed the Punjab Irregular Force (PIF), giving rise to the &quot;Piffer&quot; name adopted by the officers and men of the regiments of the PIF and still used to this day by their successor regiments.

In 1857 the Indian Mutiny began and the regiment, like many other Indian units, remained loyal to the British. During the British-Indian siege of rebel-held Delhi (begun on 30 May) the 1st Punjab Infantry was part of the 3rd Column, commanded by Col. Campbell. On 14 September the column was tasked with storming the Kashmiri Gate—a part of the walled defences of Delhi—which they successfully achieved. Fierce fighting, however, ensued and Delhi was not fully retaken until 20 September. The rebellion was finally quelled by July 1858.

In 1863 the 1st Punjab Infantry took part in the Umbeyla campaign in the North-West Frontier. At the Crag Picquet the regiment saw fierce fighting on 30 October, to such an extent that the regiment was compelled to withdraw from the hill; it was retaken shortly afterwards and two Victoria Crosses (VC) were later awarded. One of the VC recipients was Henry William Pitcher of the 4th Punjabis, who later joined the 1st Punjab Infantry and was killed in 1875 at Dera Ghazi Khan. Further fighting took place at Crag Picquet in November, which involved the regiment. In 1865 the Punjab Irregular Force was renamed the Punjab Frontier Force and the regiment&#x27;s title was consequently changed to become the 1st Regiment of Infantry, Punjab Frontier Force.

In 1878, the Second Afghan War began and the regiment participated as part of the 2nd Infantry Brigade of the Kandahar Field Force, commanded by Lieutenant-General Sir Donald Stewart. The force captured the city of Kandahar on 8 January 1879. The regiment was awarded the Theatre Honour &quot;Afghanistan 1878–79&quot; for their participation in the initial campaign of the war. The conflict did not conclude until 1880.

===1880–1922===
The 1890s saw the 1st Punjab Infantry involved in several major operations against the hostile tribes on the North-West Frontier of India. These included Maizar, and Waziristan on 10 June 1897, when the regiment was ambushed in an action that signified the beginning of a large tribal uprising against the British. The beginning of the 20th century gave the regiment no respite, and it took part in further operations in Waziristan in 1901. That same year it became, simply, the 1st Punjab Infantry. In 1903, the regiment was designated a rifle regiment and retitled as the 55th Coke&#x27;s Rifles (Frontier Force), named in honour of the regiment&#x27;s founder. In 1908, the Regiment took part in the Mohmand expedition on the North-West Frontier.

The 55th did not serve abroad during the First World War but the regiment—which comprised companies of Afridis, Punjabi Musulmans, Sikhs and Yusufzais—saw active service on the North-West Frontier for the duration of the war, fighting many of the numerous marauding tribes that populated the area. Many men of the regiment did, however, see service abroad during the war while attached to other units. In 1915, Jemadar Mir Dast, while attached to the 57th Wilde&#x27;s Rifles (Frontier Force), was awarded the 55th&#x27;s first (and only) Victoria Cross for his distinguished actions at Wieltie, Belgium. Mir Dast&#x27;s brother, Mir Mast, had deserted from his regiment—the 58th—to the Germans. It is rumoured that Mir Mast received the Iron Cross while fighting for them.

===1922–47===
In 1921–22, a major reorganization was undertaken in the British Indian Army leading to the formation of large infantry groups of four to six battalions. Among these was the 13th Frontier Force Rifles, formed by grouping the 55th Coke&#x27;s Rifles with the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 56th Punjabi Rifles, the 57th Wilde&#x27;s Rifles, 58th Vaughan&#x27;s Rifles and 59th Scinde Rifles (Frontier Force). The Coke&#x27;s new designation was 1st Battalion (Coke&#x27;s) 13th Frontier Force Rifles. The 55th&#x27;s uniform of rifle green colour was adopted as the uniform of the new regiment.

During the Second World War, the 1/13th Frontier Force Rifles (Coke&#x27;s) was part of the 9th Indian Division based on the west coast of Malaya. The battalion fought in the disastrous Malayan Campaign against the Japanese, which led to the surrender of British forces at Singapore on 15 February 1942. The battalion was re-raised in 1946. In 1945, 13th Frontier Force Rifles dropped its regimental number &quot;13&quot; to become Frontier Force Rifles.

===1947 onwards===
Upon the independence in 1947, the Frontier Force Rifles was allotted to Pakistan Army. In 1948, 1 FF Rifles fought in the Kashmir War against India. The battalion fought with great gallantry at Chakothi in the Jhelum Valley, and foiled all Indian attempts to advance towards Muzaffarabad. In 1956, the Frontier Force Rifles and the Pathan Regiment were merged with the Frontier Force Regiment, and 1 FF Rifles was redesignated as 7th Battalion (Coke&#x27;s) The Frontier Force Regiment or 7 FF. During the Indo-Pakistan War of 1965, the battalion again distinguished itself in the Battle of Chawinda.

<doc id="1336632" wikidata="Q3111258" url="?curid=1336632" title="Plum Warner">
<text>Sir Pelham Francis Warner, (2 October 1873 – 30 January 1963), affectionately and better known as Plum Warner or &quot;the Grand Old Man&quot; of English cricket, was a Test cricketer and cricket administrator.

He was knighted for services to sport in the 1937 Coronation Honours.

==Early life==

Warner was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad, the youngest of 21 children. His mother, Rosa Cadiz, was a Spanish woman, and his father Charles Warner, was from an English colonial family. He was educated in Barbados at Harrison College, and then sent to England to Rugby School and Oriel College, Oxford.

==Cricket career==

As a right-hand batsman, Warner played first-class cricket for Oxford University, Middlesex and England. He played 15 Test matches, captaining in 10 of them, with a record of won 4, lost 6. He succeeded in regaining The Ashes in 1903–04, winning the series against Australia 3–2. However he was less successful when he captained England on the tour of South Africa in 1905–06, suffering a resounding 1–4 defeat, the first time England had lost to South Africa in a Test match. He was also to have captained England on the 1911–12 tour of Australia, but fell ill. He was unable to play in any of the Tests, with Johnny Douglas taking over the captaincy.

He was named Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1904 and also in 1921, making him one of two to have received the honour twice (the usual practice is that it is only won once: the other is Jack Hobbs). The second award marked his retirement as a county player after the 1920 season, in which he captained Middlesex to the County Championship title.

In the mid-1920s he was Chairman of Selectors, and in 1926 during industrial strife served as a Special Constable. He did not, however, play in another first-class fixture until 1926–27, when he captained a Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) side to Argentina, in which the four representative matches against the host nation were accorded first-class status. MCC scraped a win in the series by two games to one, with one match drawn. He played one more first-class match, in 1929 for the MCC against the Royal Navy.

===Cricket management===

After retiring as a player, he became a tour manager, most notably on the infamous &quot;Bodyline&quot; tour of Australia in 1932–33 in which he was reportedly opposed to the tactics and argued against their use. He was the chairman of the England Test selectors for several years in the 1930s. He later became President of the Marylebone Cricket Club. He was knighted for his services to cricket in 1937.

===Cricket writing===

Warner wrote extensively on cricket. He detailed his Ashes Tests and a history of Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground. He founded &quot;The Cricketer&quot; magazine. He was cricket correspondent of the &quot;Morning Post&quot; from 1921 to 1933, and subsequently of the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;.

==Family life==

He married Agnes Charlotte Blyth in the summer of 1904 and had two sons, Esmond and John, and a daughter, Elizabeth. He died, aged 89, at West Lavington, West Sussex.

His brother Aucher Warner not only captained the first combined West Indies side in the West Indies during the 1896–97 season (playing against A. A. Priestley&#x27;s XI and for Trinidad vs. Lord Hawke&#x27;s touring team, which included Pelham Warner) but also the first West Indian touring side to England in 1900.

Marina Warner, novelist and mythographer, is his granddaughter.

<text>The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage: The Official Style Guide Used by the Writers and Editors of the World&#x27;s Most Authoritative Newspaper is a style guide first published in 1950 by editors at the newspaper and revised in 1974, 1999, and 2002 by Allan M. Siegal and William G. Connolly. According to the &quot;Times&quot; Deputy News Editor Philip B. Corbett (in charge of revising the manual) in 2007, the newspaper maintains an updated, intranet version of the manual that is used by &quot;NYT&quot; staff, but this online version is not available to the general public. An e-book version of this fifth edition was issued in February 2015, and it was released in paperback form in September 2015 (Three Rivers Press, ).

&quot;The New York Times Manual&quot; has various differences from the more influential &quot;Associated Press Stylebook&quot;. As some examples, the &quot;NYT Manual&quot;: 
*Uses &quot;″s&quot; for possessives even for a word/name ending in &quot;s&quot;
*Gives rationales for many practices for which &quot;AP&quot; simply states a rule
*Is strictly alphabetical and thus self-indexed, while &quot;AP&quot; has separate sections for sports and weather entries, and combines many entries under such terms as &quot;weapons&quot;
*Has some whimsical entries – such as one for how to spell &quot;shh&quot; – in contrast to &quot;AP&quot;″s drier, more utilitarian format (though the &quot;NYT&quot; book is not alone in its tone among journalistic style guides)
*Requires that the surnames of subjects be prefixed with a courtesy title (such as Dr., Mr., Ms., or Mrs.). However, since about 2015, courtesy titles have not been used in sports pages, pop culture, and fine arts. Also, after the first use of honorifics denoting posts (such as President or Professor, but not Dr.) in an article, the person is subsequently referred to by an egalitarian courtesy title (e.g. &#x27;President Biden&#x27; then &#x27;Mr. Biden&#x27;).
*Uses its own style for abbreviations rather than deferring to common usage; for example the National Football League is abbreviated NFL in most sources but N.F.L. in the New York Times

<text>Nevado Anallajsi is a stratovolcano in Bolivia. The date of its last eruption is unknown, but its youngest lava flows appear to have erupted from a vent on the north flank of the mountain. The main composition of the volcano is andesitic and dacitic. It overlies a plateau which is composed of ignimbrite. The volcano covers an area of and is 10.2 mya old based on its erosion state, while other estimates indicate an age of 2.6 mya.

<text>The MMR06 is a Soviet/Russian rocket for meteorological experiments, with a length of 3.48 metres and a total weight of 130 kg. The MMR06 rocket was built in two versions: One version had a conical top, the second one, named MMR06-M, had a detachable free flying top, also called dart. The maximum flight height was about 60 - 80 kilometres. Between 1988 and 1992 62 rockets of the type MMR06-M were launched from the former NVA exercise area Zingst, in order to accomplish wind and temperature measurements in the upper atmosphere.

Dave Emory, since the 1980s, has produced, written and hosted several radio programs: &quot;The Guns of November,&quot; &quot;Miscellaneous Archive Shows,&quot; &quot;One Step Beyond&quot; and &quot;Anti-Fascist Archives&quot; (formerly &quot;Radio Free America&quot;). In 1983, Emory and &quot;Nip Tuck&quot; (AKA Tad Williams) created &quot;The Guns of November&quot;, a four-part four-hour-long-segments series on the Kennedy assassination for Foothill College&#x27;s radio station, KFJC, in Los Altos Hills, California. Emory became co-host of KFJC&#x27;s &quot;One Step Beyond&quot; which started in 1979 and was a multi-hour Sunday night phone-in show hosted by Nip Tuck focused on political topics emphasising &quot;Nazi spies, CIA mind control experiments and mercenaries, among others.&quot; In the 2000s, Emory&#x27;s &quot;For the Record&quot; series has aired every Monday on KKUP-FM, Cupertino, California, Wednesday on WFMU in Jersey City, in the early a.m. hours Thursday on KPFK in Los Angeles, Thursdays and Fridays on KFJC, and Fridays on WCBN-FM in Ann Arbor. Descriptions and summaries of &quot;For the Record&quot; programs are archived and maintained by SpitfireList.com. Audio archives are maintained by WFMU.

Recent programs consist of two 30-minute monologues or telephone interviews on one or more topics, including fascism, corporatism, genocide, the Cold War, Fifth column movements and international banking scandals. Recurring topics also include the Kennedy assassination and its alleged relations to the FBI, George H. W. Bush, Richard Nixon and the Watergate scandal, German-controlled industry and banking, the Muslim Brotherhood, the O. J. Simpson murder case, 9/11, the Bush family and its business connections to the Osama Bin Laden family and the Third Reich (through Senator Prescott Bush), the P-2 Lodge, disinformation, mind control and cults. Interview guests include writer Kevin Coogan, author John Loftus, author Sterling Seagrave, freelance journalist and 2004 presidential candidate John Buchanan, and investigative journalists Lucy Komisar and Robert Parry.

==&quot;The Underground Reich&quot;==
Emory frequently propounds the existence of an &quot;Underground Reich&quot; as a central feature of his broader theses. An entity which maintains the long-term interests of German-based multinational conglomerates, it includes heavy industry, chemicals, communications, as well as international shipping, banking and financial interests. Emory contends that the many units which make up the &quot;Underground Reich&quot;, having survived World War II, persist and flourish as major components of the current global capital elite. Boris Kachka of New York Magazine wrote, &quot;According to Dave Emory’s radio programs, nearly every figure in world politics is a tendril of the “Underground Reich”, a network including Hitler&#x27;s personal secretary&quot;. Kachka agrees there were obvious connections around World War II, &quot;but Emory’s present-day analysis is a little more paranoid, even for the age of WikiLeaks (a Nazi data-mining operation)&quot;.

<text>The Landship Committee was a small British committee formed during the First World War to develop armoured fighting vehicles for use on the Western Front. The eventual outcome was the creation of what is now called the tank. Established in February 1915 by First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill, the Committee was composed mainly of naval officers, politicians and engineers. It was chaired by Eustace Tennyson d’Eyncourt, Director of Naval Construction at the Admiralty. For secrecy, by December 1915 the name was changed to &quot;the D.N.C.&#x27;s Committee&quot; to disguise its purpose.

==Formation==

The committee was formed at Churchill&#x27;s instruction in February 1915, in part from ideas by Colonel Ernest Swinton, who was then employed as a war correspondent for HM government, and by Maurice Hankey, Secretary of the Committee for Imperial Defence, who wrote Churchill a missive on 26 December 1914. Churchill on 5 January 1915 disclosed the Committee notion to Prime Minister Herbert Asquith by letter in which he wrote:

The committee started with only three members: d&#x27;Eyncourt, as chairman; Flight Commander Thomas Hetherington of the Royal Naval Air Service Armoured Car Squadron; and Colonel Wilfred Dumble of the Naval Brigade. Hetherington had proposed a large wheeled landship, estimated to weigh some 300 tons. A former Royal Engineer, Dumble had managed the London Omnibus Co. and been brought back to service in response to the urgent need for transport by the Royal Naval Division in Antwerp; he had been an adjutant to Colonel R.E.B. Crompton, who was trying to develop cross-country vehicles for the Army. Dumble recommended Crompton to the committee as an expert on heavy traction.

The committee&#x27;s activities were concealed from Kitchener at the War Office, the Board of the Admiralty, and the Treasury, all of whom were expected to block the project. Experiments were performed on the grounds of Hatfield House, the home of the Marquess of Salisbury.

==Tank development==
The Committee conducted a number of trials with various wheeled and tracked vehicles, and work was in progress on a prototype vehicle (later to become Little Willie) when in July 1915 the Committee&#x27;s existence came to the attention of the War Office. This led to its operations being taken over by the Army and a number of its members transferring from the Navy. From December, 1915 the word &quot;tank&quot; was adopted as a codename for the vehicles in development, and the Landship Committee became known officially as the Tank Supply Committee.

==Tank deployment==
The tank was first deployed to the battle of the Somme in September 1916.

==Immediate aftermath==
In 1919 the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors held a session to determine the inventor of the tank.

<text>Patilla Pata is a stratovolcano in the Oruro Department in Bolivia. It is situated in the Sajama Province, in the west of the Curahuara de Carangas Municipality, at the border with Chile. Patilla Pata lies south-west of the mountain Jisk&#x27;a Kunturiri, north-east of the lake Q&#x27;asiri Quta &quot;(Khasiri Kkota)&quot; and the mountain Qullqi Warani, west of the little lake Sura Pata, south-east of the mountains Laram Q&#x27;awa, Kunturiri and Milluni and south of the little lake named Ch&#x27;iyar Quta.

The river Junt&#x27;uma K&#x27;uchu (Aymara &quot;junt&#x27;u&quot; warm, hot, &quot;uma&quot; water, &quot;k&#x27;uchu&quot; corner, &quot;warm water corner&quot;, &quot;Junthuma Khuchu&quot;) originates south of Patilla Pata. It flows to the south-east as a right affluent of the Sajama River.

The date of its last eruption is unclear, but it is unlikely to be during the Holocene as the mountain is heavily glaciated. The composition of the volcano is largely andesitic, but there are also a number of basaltic lava flows.

<text>Meteor is a family of Polish sounding rockets series. The Meteor rockets were built between 1963 and 1974.

Meteor was a series of one- and two-stage meteorological rockets using solid fuel, constructed for the research of the upper layers of the atmosphere, wind directions and forces from 18 km to more than 50 km above the Earth&#x27;s surface. These rockets were designed by Polish engineers of Warsaw Aviation Institute (among them was Professor Jacek Walczewski and engineer Adam Obidziński) and had been produced by WZK-Mielec.

== History ==

The first launch site of the sounding rockets in Poland was Błędowska Desert, where between 1958 and 1963, rockets of different types had been launched; among others RD and Rasko. During a flight, a biological experiment with earlier trained two white mouses was conducted (the RM-2D rocket achieved the altitude of 1,580 meters).

From 1965 until April 1970, the Meteor-1 rockets had been launched from a &quot;spaceport&quot; located 5 km from Ustka. This programme had been continued to 1974, when rockets were bearing out from the area of experimental center founded there during the years of the Second World War, located on west side of Łeba. Currently, it is preserved in the museum (the starting place with the ramp and the radar bases).

There were 224 flights of &quot;Meteor-1&quot; rocket series (including prototypes). The valuable data both meteorological and connected with rocket techniques were collected and analyzed as the result of these researches.

The &quot;Meteor-1&quot;, &quot;Meteor-2H&quot; and &quot;Meteor 2K&quot; (the largest civilian rocket developed in Poland) were single-stage rockets. The &quot;Meteor-3&quot; was a two-stage rocket, developed from &quot;Meteor 1&quot;.

Meteor rockets had been launched from Łeba and Ustka. Five Meteor rockets missions were conducted around 1970 from Zingst, in East Germany. The programme of flights of Meteor-2 was finished during the same year, when Poland started to participate in Interkosmos research, using the Vertical rockets, which were derived from R-14 missile.

==Meteor-1==

One stage, but two units rocket called &quot;Meteor-1&quot; had the length of 2,470 mm and the initial mass of 32.5 kg. The flight lasted for 80 seconds and reaching at the peak altitude of 36.5 km. The motor ignite for 2–3 seconds and reached the maximum velocity of 1,100 meters per seconds. In 1965, 6 rockets of &quot;Meteor-1&quot; type was launched and after this time: 12 in 1966, 40 in 1967, 45 in 1968, 36 in 1969, 34 in 1970 and 4 in 1971.

The charge of metal dipoles was released by rockets and this material had later been observed on radar screens. It was the base of derivation of winds strength in the stratosphere and winds directions in the same atmospheric layer. After experiments that had been conducted in the years 1965–1966, during &quot;The Year of the Quiet Sun&quot;, a cyclic pattern of variation in case of directions of these atmospheric flows was concluded.

==Meteor-2==

The one stage &quot;Meteor-2K&quot; was the most advanced version of the Meteor rocket. On 7 October 1970, the flight took place and reached the altitude of 90 kilometers. This rocket had been used as sounding of the ionosphere, reaching the level of boundary between D and E layers. 10 more flights of this version were realized, when the measurements of temperature were made. The length of rocket frame is 4.5 meters and some are more longer than an English rocket, Petrel (in service since 1968). The &quot;Meteor-2&quot; had not been produced in serial way. The cost of this rocket prototype was eight times higher than for the copy of &quot;Meteor-1&quot;. The weight of useful charge, in form of &quot;RAMZES&quot; recovery probe, is 10 kg.

==Meteor-3==

A two-stage rocket called &quot;Meteor-3&quot; was a developed version of &quot;Meteor-1&quot;. The range of flight was increased and the rocket gained possibility of launching of few charges of dipoles. It can reach at ceiling altitudes between 67 and 74 kilometers. An idea of version &quot;S&quot; project had been considered, although never realized. This model could be launch from airplane frame, about 5 kilometers above the surface.

==Meteor-4==

&quot;Meteor-4&quot; rocket has ten times more thrust than &quot;Meteor-2&quot;. This version could reach above 100 km. According to design, this rocket is longer than 5 meters and had the initial total mass of 407 kg with useful weight of 10 kg. 175 seconds into the flight, it would reach at the altitude of 120 kilometers.

<text>is a manufacturer of coffee and tea products in Kobe, Hyōgo. &quot;UCC&quot; stands for &quot;Ueshima Coffee Company&quot;.

It owns a Kona coffee farm on the island of Hawaii.
The company is a part of the UCC Group.

==History==
The company started as a store under the name of &quot;Ueshima Tadao Shoten&quot; in 1933. It became a limited partnership in 1940 and in 1951, became &quot;Ueshima Coffee Co., Ltd.&quot;. The company introduced the world&#x27;s first canned coffee, &quot;UCC Coffee with Milk&quot; in April 1969, which started the trend for canned coffee () in Japan.

It formally became &quot;UCC Ueshima Coffee Co., Ltd.&quot; in 1991.

==Marketing tie-ins==
UCC Coffee became famous with otaku (anime fans) around the world after their canned coffee was featured in the 1997 feature film &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot;. As a tie-in with the makers of the film, UCC created six coffee can designs featuring the Evangelion characters holding the company&#x27;s products. These cans subsequently became prized collector&#x27;s items. UCC continued this partnership when, a decade later, a new set of four Evangelion films began their release with 2007&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. The cans were again featured in the film, and UCC again featured illustrations of the film&#x27;s characters on a limited release of their cans. In 2009, UCC created another line of limited edition cans featuring the characters from the second film in the series, &quot;&quot;.

<text>Juvenalorden is a student society based at Uppsala University, Sweden. Juvenalorden was founded in 1907, but traces its traditions to the society known as &quot;The Juvenals&quot; (&quot;Juvenalerna&quot;), which had been active in the 1830s and 1840s.

The &quot;Juvenalorden&quot;, or &quot;Juvenal Order&quot;, of 1907 was founded on the initiative of then student, later clergyman August Lindh, remembered for his widespread Swedish translation of the German student song (in Swedish: &quot;O, gamla klang - och jubeltid!&quot;), and with a tenuous connection to the original society in the form of the aging physician M. Aspelin, who had during his student days in Uppsala been introduced into the Juvenals by its principal figure, the poet and composer Gunnar Wennerberg (1817-1901) himself. The purpose of the order (as stated in the &quot;Nordisk familjebok&quot; article on the society from 1924) was to work &quot;for the ennobling of youthful happiness in the academic life&quot;. As a revival of the earlier society the order worked to both conserve and develop aspects of older upsaliensian student life, which had acquired a classical character in the mid 19th century; important aspects of this is the male student choir singing and the performance of &quot;spex&quot;, a form of comical musical theatre usually based on themes from history or classical literature and characterized by its humorous anachronisms.

Notable members of the younger juvenals include the arctic explorer Finn Malmgren, the historian Sten Lindroth (later the Carlberg Professor of History of Ideas and Learning in Uppsala), the writer Gösta Knutsson, and the writer and entertainer Tage Danielsson. Among the prominent living members are the lawyer Peter Nobel, former Secretary General of the Swedish section of Amnesty International, and Hans Dalborg, chairman of the Nordic bank Nordea.

Juvenalorden publishes a series of publications covering various aspects of Upsaliensian student history.

<doc id="1336682" wikidata="Q727363" url="?curid=1336682" title="Giovanni Vincenzo Gravina">
<text>Giovanni Vincenzo Gravina (20 January 1664 – 6 January 1718) was an Italian man of letters and jurist. He was born at Roggiano Gravina, a small town near Cosenza, in Calabria. He was the adoptive father of the poet Metastasio.

== Biography ==

Giovanni Vincenzo Gravina was born at Roggiano a small town near Cosenza, to a well-off family. He was early sent to study with his maternal uncle, Gregorio Caloprese, who possessed some reputation as a poet and philosopher. This was a decisive experience in his education: his tutor not only guided him toward knowledge of the classics, but also exposed him to the methods and perspectives of “new science”; Caloprese had returned to Calabria from Naples, where he had frequented the Accademia degli Investiganti (Academy of Investigators), which diffused the ideas of Galileo, Descartes, and Pierre Gassendi throughout southern Italy.

In 1680 Gravina moved to Naples to undertake legal studies, during which he turned particularly to the great humanists of the sixteenth century, both jurists and scholars. At the same time he perfected himself in Greek at the school of Gregorio Messere He quickly entered into the most forward-thinking cultural circles of the capital, represented in the sphere of law by the followers of Francesco D&#x27;Andrea. Naples was a center for the intersection and comparison of different philosophical and religious tendencies. These included polemics against neo-Aristotelian and Thomist traditions, as well as against Jansenistic, quietistic, and anti-Jesuitic trends. Gravina&#x27;s first printed work was consequently of a moral and religious character: &quot;Hydra mistica&quot; (1691), from which minor works drawing on the same material followed.

In Naples, meanwhile, he had earned the favor of Cardinal Antonio Pignatelli (the future pope Innocent XII), who in 1689 requested that he come to Rome as one of his agents. To the slightly stifling climate of the Roman capital in those years, Gravina brought a breath of the lively debates in which he had participated in Naples. In 1690 he was among the founders of Rome&#x27;s Academy of Arcadia. In Rome, which had now become his base, he composed between 1692 and 1696 numerous writings that were literary in nature or characterized either by historical scholarship or by moral or aesthetic criticism, and that were for the most part united in the various &quot;Opuscula&quot;, dedicated to Innocent XII (1696). He also received several public appointments, including in 1699 the chairmanship of the faculty of Civil Law at La Sapienza University, during the reorganization and reinvigoration of the university, which had been rather inactive until that point. In 1703 he transferred to the chair of Canon Law. From Innocent XII Gravina received the offer of various ecclesiastical honors, but declined them from a disinclination to enter the clerical profession.

His openness to the currents of European thought brought on more than a few disputes with more conservative groups in the Curia, which he often resolved only with much effort. In 1701 Gravina published the first draft of his principal work, &quot;Originum juris civilis libri tres&quot;, which was completed in 1704, appeared in a definitive edition in Leipzig in 1708, and has been reprinted several times. Appreciated in all Europe, the &quot;Origines&quot; became a standard reference until the nineteenth century on the history of Roman law and on the theme of the relationships between natural rights and the historicity of rights. Gravina&#x27;s literary interests, his contributions in aesthetic theory, and his interests in historical scholarship were all expressed in the same period in an abundance of writings: among the principal works, the &quot;Ragion poetica&quot; (1708) and a collection of &quot;Orationes&quot; (1712) are particularly significant. In 1711 a schism occurred in the Academy of Arcadia, and Gravina and his followers founded in opposition to it the Academy of Quirina.

The years 1714-16 he spent in Calabria resting and attending to the inheritance bequeathed him by Caloprese. In his final years Gravina continued to publish on legal and literary subjects and even wrote tragedies, which were in their time much appreciated. He also reestablished contacts in the Neapolitan circle, traveling frequently to the capital of the Kingdom of Naples and publishing various works there. He died in 1718 in Rome. Comforting him at his death in 1718 was one of his dearest friends and followers, Pietro Metastasio. Gravina was survived by his mother, to whom he left his property in Calabria. His Roman possessions were left to Metastasio. Among the famous pupils of Gravina were Lorenzo Gori and Orazio Filippo Bianchi.

== Works ==

Gravina was the author of a number of works of great erudition, the principal being his &quot;Origines juris civilis&quot;, completed in 3 vols (1713) and his &quot;De Romano imperio&quot; (1712). The work of Gravina that is best remembered is his discourse on poetry, first published in 1708: &quot;Della Ragion Poetica libri due&quot;, in which he defines poetry as an intuitive and imaginative form of knowledge with the power to inspire civic renewal. Gravina seeks to pioneer poetics as a science deduced from rational first principles and conceives poetry itself as a rudimentary and imperfect form of cognition through which philosophical truth is transmitted by means of image and emotion. In this and in his preference for the primitive (Homer and Dante) over the refined (Virgil and Torquato Tasso), he points distantly towards Vico&#x27;s &quot;The New Science&quot; (1725).

<text>Yaacov Agam (; born 11 May 1928) is an Israeli sculptor and experimental artist widely known for his contributions to optical and kinetic art.

==Early life, family and education==
Yaacov Gibstein (later Agam) was born in Mandate Palestine. His father, Yehoshua Gibstein, was a rabbi and a kabbalist.

Agam trained at the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design in Jerusalem, before moving to Zürich, Switzerland in 1949, where he studied under Johannes Itten (1888–1967) at the Kunstgewerbe Schule. He was influenced by the painter and sculptor Max Bill (1908–1994).

In 1951 Agam moved to Paris, France, where he still resides.

==Artistic career==
Agam&#x27;s first solo exhibition was at the Galerie Craven, Paris, in 1953, and he exhibited three works at the 1954 Salon des Réalités Nouvelles
and at the &quot;Le Mouvement&quot; exhibition at the &quot;Galerie Denise René&quot;, Paris, in 1955. 

Agam&#x27;s work is usually abstract, kinetic art, with movement, viewer participation and frequent use of light and sound. His works are placed in many public places. His best-known pieces include &quot;Double Metamorphosis III&quot; (1965), &quot;Visual Music Orchestration&quot; (1989), the fountain at the La Défense district in Paris (1975) and the &quot;Fire and Water Fountain&quot; in the Dizengoff Square in Tel Aviv (1986). He is also known for a type of print known as an &quot;Agamograph&quot;, which uses barrier-grid animation to present radically different images, depending on the angle from which it is viewed. The lenticular technique was executed in large scale in the square &quot;Complex Vision&quot; (1969), mounted on the facade of the Callahan Eye Foundation Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama.

Agam had a retrospective exhibition in Paris at the Musée National d&#x27;Art Moderne in 1972, and at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City in 1980, among others. His works are held in numerous museum collections including the Museum of Modern Art and the Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum.

He is the subject of two 20th century documentary films by American filmmaker Warren Forma: &quot;Possibilities of Agam&quot; (1967) and &quot;Agam and...&quot; (1980).

In 1996, he was awarded the Jan Amos Comenius Medal by UNESCO for the &quot;Agam Method&quot; for visual education of young children.

He designed and created the winner&#x27;s trophy for the 1999 Eurovision Song Contest that was held in Jerusalem.

In 2009, at age 81, Agam created &quot;Peaceful Communication with the World&quot;, a monument for the World Games in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. It consists of nine high hexagonal pillars positioned in a rhomboid formation. The sides of the pillars are painted in different patterns and hues..

One of Agam&#x27;s more notable creations is the menorah at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 59th Street in New York City, sponsored by the Lubavitch Youth Organization. The high, gold colored, steel structure is recognized by the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as the &quot;world&#x27;s largest Hanukkah menorah&quot;.

In May 2014, Agam&#x27;s piece &quot;Faith- Visual Pray&quot; was presented to Pope Francis by El Al Israel Airlines&#x27;s president, David Maimon. The piece included significant symbols of both Jewish and Christian faiths.

Agam&#x27;s work commands the highest prices of any Israeli artist. In a Sotheby&#x27;s New York auction in November 2009, when his &quot;4 Themes Contrepoint&quot; was sold for $326,500, he said: &quot;This does not amaze me … my prices will go up, in keeping with the history I made in the art world.&quot;

In 2018, the Yaacov Agam Museum of Art (YAMA) opened in the artist&#x27;s hometown of Rishon LeZion, Israel. Agam told the &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot; that it is &quot;the only museum in the world that is dedicated to art in motion.&quot;

<text>Movin&#x27; Out is a 2002 jukebox musical featuring the songs of Billy Joel. Conceived and created by Twyla Tharp, the musical tells the story of a generation of American youth growing up on Long Island during the 1960s and their experiences with the Vietnam War. The principal characters are drawn from those who appeared in various Joel tunes: high school sweethearts Brenda and Eddie (&quot;Scenes from an Italian Restaurant&quot;), James (&quot;James&quot;), Judy (&quot;Why Judy Why&quot;), Sergeant O&#x27;Leary and Tony (Anthony in &quot;Movin&#x27; Out&quot;). The show diverts from the traditional musical in that it essentially is a series of dances linked by a thin plot, and none of the dancers sing. Instead, all the vocals are performed by a pianist (the &quot;Piano Man&quot;, representing Billy Joel) and band suspended on a platform above the stage while the dancers act out the songs&#x27; lyrics, basically making the show a rock ballet.

==Productions==
In 2000, Tharp approached Joel for permission to create the show, presenting him with a 20-minute concept video featuring the show&#x27;s eventual Broadway cast. Joel was enthusiastic about it, but kept his involvement thereafter to a minimum. The show started in pre-Broadway try-outs at the Shubert Theatre in Chicago from June 25, 2002, through September 1, 2002. The Chicago production was negatively received, and Tharp made extensive revisions to the show&#x27;s first act, with some suggestions from Joel.

It premiered on Broadway at the Richard Rodgers Theatre on October 24, 2002, to more positive reviews, and closed on December 11, 2005, after 1,303 performances and 28 previews. Directed and choreographed by Tharp, the cast included Michael Cavanaugh (Piano Man), Darren Holden (replacement Piano Man), Wade Preston (alternate Piano Man), Elizabeth Parkinson (Brenda), John Selya (Eddie), Keith Roberts (Tony), Henry Haid (understudy Piano Man), Ashley Tuttle (Judy), Benjamin G. Bowman (James), and Scott Wise (Sergeant O&#x27;Leary/Drill Sergeant). 

The first national tour of &quot;Movin&#x27; Out&quot; ran for three years, opening on January 27, 2004 and closing on January 21, 2007, after 1,111 performances. The tour also played to generally excellent reviews and full houses in 82 U.S. cities, and also ran in Canada in December 2005. It featured numerous dancers from the original Broadway production, who rotated in and out as schedules allowed. Darren Holden was the primary lead Piano Man and star for the entire run of the tour, understudied by Matt Wilson (2004), Charlie Neshyba-Hodges (2004), James Fox (2005) and Matthew Friedman (2006). Holly Cruikshank, in the role of Brenda, won the 2005 Helen Hayes Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Non-Resident Production.

The West End production opened on April 10, 2006, at London&#x27;s Apollo Victoria Theatre where, despite receiving mostly solid reviews, it ran for less than two months, closing on May 2, 2006. James Fox and Darren Reeves were the leads.

The show played Tokyo, Japan in the summer of 2006, with many of the first national tour&#x27;s performers including Darren Holden in the lead role.

A second national tour opened in Atlantic City on June 14, 2007, with Matthew Friedman and Kyle Martin in the lead role of Piano Man.

A third National Tour opened in La Crosse, Wisconsin on November 4, 2008, with Matthew Friedman, Kyle Martin, and Jon Abrams in the lead role of Piano Man.

On October 15, 2002, a live cast recording was released featuring the 2002 original Broadway cast. It was a single CD featuring 30 tracks.

<text>Blizna is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Ostrów, within Ropczyce-Sędziszów County, Subcarpathian Voivodeship, in south-eastern Poland. It lies approximately north of Ostrów, north of Ropczyce, and north-west of the regional capital Rzeszów.

==History==

===World War II===

From 5 November 1943 to early July 1944 there was an SS military base near Blizna, from which 139 A4 (also known as V-2) rockets were launched for experimental purposes and for training. After the air raid on Peenemünde on 17 August 1943 it was decided that the training and testing should be done in southeast Poland outside of the range of the Allied bombers. However test launches also continued at Peenemuende until 21 February 1945.

Because the rockets launched from Blizna - in contrast to the rockets launched from Peenemünde - flew over a populated area, there was also some destruction of buildings. Wernher von Braun, a central figure in Germany&#x27;s pre-war rocket development program, and post-war director of NASA&#x27;s Marshall Space Flight Center, worked at the Blizna test site and personally visited the test missile impact areas to troubleshoot any problems discovered during trials.

The missile testing ground at Blizna was quickly located by the Polish resistance movement, the Armia Krajowa thanks to reports from local farmers. Armia Krajowa field agents even managed to obtain pieces of the fired rockets, by arriving on the scene before German patrols. In early March 1944, British Intelligence Headquarters received a report of an Armia Krajowa agent (code name: &quot;‘Makary’&quot;) who had covertly surveyed the Blizna railway line and observed a freight car heavily guarded by SS troops containing &quot;‘an object which, though covered by a tarpaulin, bore every resemblance to a monstrous torpedo’&quot;. Subsequently, a plan was formed to make an attempt to capture a whole unexploded V-2 rocket and transport it to Britain. Around 20 May 1944, a relatively undamaged V-2 rocket fell on the swampy bank of the Bug River near the village of Sarnaki and local Poles managed to hide it before German arrival. The rocket was then dismantled and smuggled across Poland. In late July 1944, the Polish resistance (Home Army and V1 and V2) secretly transported parts of the rocket out of Poland in Operation Most III (Bridge III), for analysis by British intelligence.

In July 1944 the advance of Soviet troops forced the base at Blizna to be evacuated and launch activities were moved to the Tuchola Forest.

<text>Graaff-Reinet (; Xhosa: eRhafu) is a town in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. It is the oldest town in the province and the fourth oldest town in South Africa, after Cape Town, Stellenbosch, Simon&#x27;s Town, Paarl and Swellendam. The town was the centre of a short-lived republic in the late 18th century. The town was a starting point for Great Trek groups led by Gerrit Maritz and Piet Retief and furnished large numbers of the Voortrekkers in 1835–1842.

Graaff-Reinet is home to more national monuments than any other town or city in South Africa. It is also known for being a flourishing market for agricultural produce, noted for its mohair industry, and sheep and ostrich farming.

==History==
Graaff-Reinet was established by the Dutch East India Company in 1786, after Cape Town in 1652, Stellenbosch in 1679, Paarl in 1687 and Swellendam in 1745. The town is named after then-governor of the Cape Colony, Cornelis Jacob van de Graaff, and his wife. The town was originally established as a trading post to expand trading inland from the Cape Colony.

In 1795, the town&#x27;s burghers, who were annoyed by company taxation, proclaimed themselves to be the independent &quot;Colony of Graaff-Reinet&quot;. The burghers then requested guardianship from the government of the Netherlands. Similar action was subsequently taken by the burghers of Swellendam. Before the authorities at Cape Town could take decisive measures against the rebels, they were compelled to capitulate to the British who had invaded and occupied the Cape.

In January 1799, Marthinus Prinsloo, a leader of the 1795 independence movement, rebelled again but surrendered the following April. Prinsloo and nineteen others were imprisoned in the Cape Town castle. After trial, Prinsloo and another commandant were sentenced to death. Other conspirators were sentenced to exile. The sentences were not carried out and the prisoners were released in March 1803, on the retrocession of the Cape to the Netherlands.

In 1801, there was another revolt in Graaff Reinet, but due to the measures of General Francis Dundas, the acting governor of the Cape Colony, peace was soon restored. In February 1803, due to the 1802 signing of the Treaty of Amiens, the British returned the Cape Colony to the Netherlands, then named the Batavian Republic.

On 13 August 1814 the Cape Colony was formally ceded to Britain by a convention under which Dutch vessels were entitled to resort freely to the Cape of Good Hope for the purposes of refreshment and repairs. Britain agreed on 13 August 1814 to pay five million sterling to the United Netherlands for the Dutch possession at the Cape.

The Cape Colony received a degree of independence in 1872 when &quot;Responsible Government&quot; was declared in South Africa. In 1877, the government of Prime Minister John Molteno began construction of the railway line connecting Graaff-Reinet to Port Elizabeth on the coast. This railway was officially opened on 26 August 1879.

Graaff Reinet became the centre of British military operations for the Eastern Cape during the Second Boer War. In 1901, a number of captured Boer rebels were tried in the town for crimes ranging from high treason, murder, attempted murder, arson and robbery. Nine were sentenced to death, with eight of these being executed by firing squad on the outskirts of the town, while the ninth sentence was carried out in Colesberg. A monument stands in the town to commemorate these fallen Boers.

==Geography==
The town lies above sea level and is built on the banks of the Sundays River, which rises a little further north on the southern slopes of the Sneeuberge, and splits into several channels here.

The town is home to a number of tourist attractions, including the Dutch Reformed church in the town, which is a prominent stone building with seating to accommodate 1,500 people. The building is influenced by the architecture of Salisbury Cathedral in England. The town is also home to tourist sites such as The Valley of Desolation, Camdeboo National Park and the Reinet House Museum, a Cape Dutch building, formerly the Dutch Reformed Church parsonage.

==Demographics==
In the South African National Census of 2011, the population of Graaff-Reinet and the township of uMasizakhe was recorded as 35,672, which included 8,393 households. 62.2% of these residents described themselves as &quot;Coloured&quot; an identity that Khoi communities were coerced into accepting, 28.2% as &quot;Black African&quot;, and 8.7% as &quot;White&quot;. The dominant language was Afrikaans, which was the first language of 76.0% of the population. 18.9% spoke Xhosa, and 3.6% spoke English.

==Coats of arms==

Graaff Reinet was given the arms of its founder, Cornelis Jacob van de Graaff, namely a silver shield displaying two black stripes with embattled edges, and a golden canton bearing a double-headed black eagle. An anchor was placed behind the shield. The British authorities discontinued the drostdy seals in 1814, and replaced them with the royal coat of arms.

The arms were now: &quot;Argent, two bars embattled counter-embattled Gules, on a canton Sable an anchor erect Or&quot; (i.e. the bars were changed from black to red, and the canton to a gold anchor on a black background). The crest was differenced by placing a golden anchor on the eagle&#x27;s breast. The supporters and motto remained the same.

===Divisional council===
The divisional council, i.e. the local authority for the rural areas outside the town, assumed its own coat of arms, had it granted by the provincial administrator in July 1966 and registered it at the Bureau of Heraldry in January 1969.

The arms were: &quot;Argent, on a chevron Vert. a pair of compasses expanded Argent, in base a spade erect Sable, on a chief embattled Sable a merino ram&#x27;s head caboshed Or&quot;. In layman&#x27;s terms, a silver shield displaying, from top to bottom, a golden merino ram&#x27;s head on a black stripe with an embattled edge, a pair of silver compasses on a green chevron, and an upright black spade.

The crest was a double-headed black eagle, and the motto was &quot;Monemus et minimus&quot;.

<text>The Tuchola Forest, also known as Tuchola Pinewoods or Tuchola Conifer Woods, (the latter a literal translation of ; ; ) is a large forest complex near the town of Tuchola in northern Poland. It lies between the Brda and Wda rivers, within the Gdańsk Pomerania region. The largest towns in the area are Czersk and Tuchola.

The designation may also refer to the eponymous historical land and ethnocultural region, World War II battle, geomorphological mesoregion, phytogeographic landscape region and syntaxonomical subregion, nature and forest mesoregion, promotional forest complex, Biosphere Reserve, Natura 2000 Special Protection Area, national park, LEADER/CLLD local action group, or a number of local associations. Geographical extent varies greatly among these units or entities.

== Geography, nature and ecology ==
With 3,200 km2 of dense spruce and pine forest, the area is one of the biggest forests in Poland and Central Europe.

=== Geomorphology and geology ===
The area was formed during the last glacial age and is covered with low hills and more than 900 post-glacial lakes. From the geomorphological point of view, the area is located in the South-Pomeranian Lakeland macroregion of the South-Baltic Lakelands Sub-Province belonging to the Polish Plain, a part of the North European Plain province. The forest covers the eponymous Tuchola Forest mesoregion, but also the Świecie Plain (both mesoregions sometimes jointly referred to as Tuchola Plain), large swaths of the Charzykowy Plain and the Brda River Valley mesoregions, as well as lesser parts of other mesoregions: the Bytów Lakeland, the Kashubia Lakeland, the Starogard Lakeland, and the Krajna Lakeland.
The geology of Tuchola Forest consists mainly of sandar glaciofluvial deposits of sand sediment, while the soil is predominantly of podzol type.

=== Climate ===
The climate in the area is classified as &quot;Dfb&quot; climate, a variant of the hemiboreal subtype belonging to the humid continental climate type.

=== Phytogeography ===
From the geobotanical point of view, the area encompasses several floristic landscape subregions forming the eponymous Tuchola Forest landscape region, classified as the only landscape region in the eponymous Tuchola Forest syntaxonomical subregion of the Sandar Forefields of Central Pomeranian Lake District syntaxonomical region located in the Pomeranian divide of the South-Baltic subprovince.

A smaller part of the forest is located in three out of five floristic landscape subregions forming the Świecie Plain landscape region, classified in the Chełmno-Dobrzyń syntaxonomical region belonging to the Mazovian subdivide of the Mazovian-Polesian divide in the Central European (Proper) subprovince.

Both floristic subprovinces are parts of the Central European floristic province in the Circumboreal Region of the Holarctic Kingdom.

=== Ecology and habitat ===

This predominantly coniferous forest is composed mainly of suboceanic (&quot;Leucobryo-Pinetum&quot;) and subcontinental (&quot;Peucedano-Pinetum&quot;) young Scots pine forest habitat types covering 64.5% of the area of land habitats, as well as of dry acidophilous Scots pine forest (&quot;Cladonio-Pinetum&quot;) covering 2.5% of the area, and of marshy pine forest (&quot;Vaccinio-uliginosi-Pinetum&quot;). The Habitats Directive classifies the initial three habitat types jointly as the Central European lichen Scots pine forest habitat type, and the last one as belonging to bog woodlands habitat type, all belonging to the Forests of Temperate Europe group. The habitat classification of the European Nature Information System classifies the first type as belonging to subcontinental moss Pinus sylvestris forests, the second and the third type belong to subcontinental lichen Pinus sylvestris forests, while the fourth belongs to nemoral Pinus sylvestris mire forests.

Deciduous forest habitats cover minority of the forest area, mainly swamps, and include:
*&quot;Vaccinio-uliginosi-Betuletum-pubescentis&quot; birch bog forest,
*&quot;Ribeso-nigri-Alnetum&quot; alder carr,
*&quot;Fraxino-Alnetum&quot; riparian forest.

The occurrence of other phytocenoses such as for instance &quot;Betulo-Quercetum roboris&quot;, &quot;Molinio-Pinetum&quot; or &quot;Stellario-Carpinetum&quot;, is considered to be of fragmentary nature or in the form of deformed phytocenoses.

The forest belongs to the Baltic mixed forests ecoregion located in the European Continental Biogeographic Region, belonging to the temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome of the Palearctic realm. The area is covered by the drainage basins of Brda and Wda, belonging to the Lower Vistula Basin, a part of the Vistula Basin emptying into the Baltic Sea, classified together with the rest of Central &amp; Western Europe as temperate floodplain rivers and wetlands of the Palearctic realm.

=== Forestry ===
For the purposes of forestry, Poland is divided into eight nature and forest lands, divided into nature and forest mesoregions, largely based on the borders of geomorphological mesoregions. The bulk of Tuchola Forest is located in the 3rd Greater Polish-Pomeramian Nature and Forest Land, where the forest covers the Tuchola Forest nature and forest mesoregion formed by merging the Tuchola Forest and the Charzykowy Plain geomorphological mesoregions, with the northernmost part of the merged unit being detached to form a separate Zaborski nature and forest mesoregion, also covered by the forest. Other nature and forest mesoregions of the 2nd Land which are partially covered by the forest include the Świecie Plain, the Brda River Valley and the Krajna Lakeland nature and forest mesoregions.

A small, peripheral part of the forest lies in the 1st Baltic Nature and Forest Land, namely in parts of the Bytów Lakeland, the Kashubia Lakeland, and the Starogard Lakeland nature and forest mesoregions.

According to the European forest classification, the young Scots pine forests and the dry acidophilous Scots pine forests habitats are classified as Nemoral Scots pine forests, while the marshy pine forests are classified as conifer dominated or mixed mire forests.

The forest is managed by the Regional Directorates of State Forests in Toruń, Gdańsk, and (a small part only) Szczecinek, with the exception of the territory of the Tuchola Forest National Park, managed outside the State Forests entity by the park itself.

A south-eastern fragment of the forest located in the part managed by the Regional Directorate in Toruń has been designated the Tuchola Forest Promotional Forest Complex for the purposes of promoting sustainable forest management. Its primary objective is forest education, in the forms of outdoor lessons and guided tours, classes in forest education chambers, meetings with foresters at schools, meetings outside schools, educational events and actions, exhibitions, forest contests, festivities, fairs, etc., carried out by qualified foresters, known as the leaders of forest education, using dedicated facilities established in the forest, such as education centers, educational chambers, educational shelters, educational trails, educational points, and others. The complex also enables interdisciplinary research based on fully recognized forest environment, for the purposes improvement of forest management methods and setting acceptable limits on economic (commercial) interventions in forest ecosystems. It also allows for sports, recreation and leisure activities in the forest, unhampered by the restrictions typically imposed in a national park or a nature reserve.

=== Environmental protection ===

In June 2010 the Tuchola Forest area was designated by UNESCO as a Tuchola Forest Biosphere Reserve, grossly coextensive with the Tuchola Forest (&quot;Bory Tucholskie&quot;, PLB220009) and the Great Brda Sandar (&quot;Wielki Sandr Brdy&quot;, PLB220001) Natura 2000 Special Protection Areas combined, encompassing several smaller Natura 2000 Special Areas of Conservation, such as the Brda and Stążka Valley in Tuchola Forest (&quot;Dolina Brdy i Stążki w Borach Tucholskich&quot;, PLH040023), the Brda and Chocina Valley (&quot;Dolina Brdy i Chociny&quot;, PLH220058), the Brda Sandar (&quot;Sandr Brdy&quot;, PLH220026), the Wda Sandar (&quot;Sandr Wdy&quot;, PLH040017), Mętne (PLH220034), Wdzydze Lakes (&quot;Jeziora Wdzydzkie&quot;, PLH220057), the Zapceń Refuge (&quot;Ostoja Zapceńska&quot;, PLH220077), Młosino-Lubnia (PLH040023), or the Church in Śliwice (Kościół w Śliwicach, PLH040034). The nucleus of the Biosphere Reserve is protected by the Tuchola Forest National Park covering and of the 25 nature reserves lying within the buffer zone. The buffer zone includes Tuchola, Wda, Wdzydze and Zaborski Landscape Parks. There is also a transit zone which includes the town of Tuchola and surrounding districts. The core area of the Reserve covers , and the three zones together cover .

== Ethnocultural region ==
The term Tuchola Forest (Polish: &quot;Bory Tucholskie&quot;) understood as an ethnocultural region and a historical land of Poland carries a much narrower geographical sense than the area covered by the actual forest. In this meaning, the designation refers exclusively to the part of the forest which is inhabited by the &quot;Tuchola Borowians&quot; (or &quot;Borowians&quot;) Polish ethnographic group, comprising the area located roughly north-east of Chojnice (Rytel, Gutowiec, Czersk, Łąg), south of Czarna Woda (Osieczna, Osówek), north-west of Świecie (Świekatowo, Lniano, Drzycim), north-east of Sępólno Krajeńskie (Wałdowo, Przepałkowo), stretching south to the suburbs of Bydgoszcz (Koronowo, Pruszcz), encompassing the entire Tuchola County (Tuchola, Raciąż, Bysław, Cekcyn, Śliwice, Legbąd, Lińsk, Gostycyn, Kęsowo, Żalno, Lubiewo). Borowians speak a specific dialect of Polish (&quot;gwara borowiacka&quot; or &quot;gwara tucholska&quot;) belonging to the Greater Polish dialects, albeit under strong influence of Kashubian.

Prior to World War II, the western part of the region partially overlapped with the Kosznajderia vel Kosznajdry or Koschneiderei former ethnocultural region inhabited by a relatively secluded solid community of Catholic German settlers brought from the Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück by the Teutonic Order State during its brief control of the area at the end the 14th century, who maintained their original culture (including clothing) and spoke Koschneiderisch, a distinct South-East-Pomeranian or Süd-Hinterpommersch dialect of Low German which preserved many features of Westphalian dialect of Middle Low German (spoken by the original pioneer founding settlers), itself heavily influenced by the Middle Dutch.

Other areas of the forest (including the National Park) are inhabited by neighbouring ethnographic groups: Kashubians (including Krubans, Borans and Zaborans), Kociewians (including Lasans and Piaskarze) - approximately 30% of the area, as well as Krajnians.

=== Community-led local development ===
In order to co-ordinate in the region various development activities related to training courses, promotion of tourism to the region, promotion and marketing of regional products, promotion of regional cuisine, organizations of regional culture activities, festivities or contests, a Local Action Group ″Tuchola Forest″ (technically a union of associations) was established by several associations of public (including all gminas of the Tuchola County, the Tuchola County itself, as well as three gminas of the Świecie County), private (including commercial) and NGO sectors, which acted under the Local Action Plan as an operator of funds distributed from the LEADER programme of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development in the years 2007–2013. Beginning from the EU budget perspective 2014-2020 onwards, the law restricted the permitted legal form of LEADER/CLLD local action groups to an association (and not a union of associations), and therefore, the entity lost the official status of LEADER local action group. As a replacement, a new LEADER/CLLD programme local operator, the Partnership ″Local Action Group Tuchola Forest″ (technically a registered ), was established by local entities (this time only those located in the territory of the Tuchola County), including local self-government units, as well as private entities (including commercial ones) and those from the NGO sector. The original union of associations continues, however, its activities as a forum of discussion and cooperation in the entire region in- and outside the territory of Tuchola County, in forms such as conferences, training courses or contests, albeit funded from sources other than the LEADER programme, such as the funds received form territorial self-government units or government institutions. Similarly, the ″Borowiak Fishie″ Fishieries Local Action Group association operates the funds for the development of fisheries and fishing communities, allocated from the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund. Other importąnt regional organizations include the Cultural Society of Borowiacy in Tuchola, the ″Promotion of Tuchola Forest″ Society for Regional Development, as well as the ″Tuchola Forest″ Association of Agri-Tourism Holdings.

== History ==
The area formed part of Poland since the establishment of the state in the 10th century, with a brief interruption during the occupation by the Teutonic Order State at the end of the 14th century. After the First Partition of Poland in 1772 the area was annexed by Prussia, and from 1871 it was part of the German Empire. Under German rule, near the village of Grupa, a military exercise area &quot;Truppenübungsplatz Gruppe&quot; was established, in which medical research was conducted, leading to publication of the name in scientific reports of the early 20th century. During World War I, pacifist doctor Georg Friedrich Nicolai was banished from Berlin to the remote area which had to be restored in 1919 to Poland as a result of the Treaty of Versailles, after Poland regained independence in November 1918.
In 1939, during the invasion of Poland at the very beginning of World War II, the major Battle of Tuchola Forest was fought in the area. Despite having cohabitated peacefully for centuries with their Polish, Kashubian or Jewish neighbours, Kosznajders succumbed to Nazi German propaganda during the increasing hostilities of the German Reich towards Poland in the months preceding the impeding invasion, when a number of them joined the Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz, participated in the preparation of Sonderfahndungsbuch Polen, or even played an active role in atrocities against Poles during the genocidal &quot;Intelligenzaktion Pommern&quot; conducted primarily in October and November 1939, when Germans murdered 335 Poles from Tuchola and Tuchola County in six large massacres known as the Rudzki Most massacre. Among the victims were teachers, school principals, merchants, craftsmen, farmers, priests, foresters, postmen, railwaymen, policemen and local officials, including mayor of Tuchola Stanisław Saganowski.

Meanwhile, the military test area was re-established as &quot;Truppenübungsplatz Westpreußen&quot;, known otherwise by its code name, &quot;Heidekraut&quot;. Between August 1944 and January 1945, SS troops under Hans Kammler and Walter Dornberger carried out extensive tests of the A-4 missiles (V-2 rockets), after the test site near Blizna was discovered by the Home Army and then bombed by the Allies. Approximately 107 missiles were fired in a southbound direction for tests and training purposes. In January 1945 the site had to be evacuated before the Red Army offensive overran the area.

After World War II, almost the entire population of Kosznajders fled or were expelled to Germany. The forest then became a safe haven for many Polish anti-communist partisans (Cursed soldiers), among them Zygmunt Szendzielarz.

<doc id="1336707" wikidata="Q1134808" url="?curid=1336707" title="Military history of the Soviet Union">
<text>The military history of the Soviet Union began in the days following the 1917 October Revolution that brought the Bolsheviks to power. In 1918 the new government formed the Red Army, which then defeated its various internal enemies in the Russian Civil War of 1917–22. The years 1918–21 saw defeats for the Red Army in the Polish–Soviet War (1919–21) and in independence wars for Estonia (1918–20), Latvia (1918–20) and Lithuania (1918–19). The Red Army invaded Finland (November 1939); fought the Battles of Khalkhin Gol of May–September 1939 (together with its ally Mongolia) against Japan and its client state Manchukuo; it was deployed when the Soviet Union, in agreement with Nazi Germany, took part in the invasion of Poland in September 1939, and occupied the Baltic States (June 1940), Bessarabia (June–July 1940) and Northern Bukovina (June–July 1940) (from Romania). In World War II the Red Army became a major military force in the defeat of Nazi Germany and conquered Manchuria. After the war, it occupied East Germany and many nations in central and eastern Europe, which became satellite states in the Soviet bloc.

Following the Allies&#x27; victory over Germany and Japan in 1945, the Soviet Union became the sole superpower rival to the United States. The Cold War between the two nations led to military buildups, the nuclear arms race, and the Space Race. By the early 1980s the Soviet armed forces had more troops, tanks, artillery guns and nuclear weapons than any other nation on earth. The Soviet Union fell in 1991, not because of military defeat but because of economic and political factors - see History of the Soviet Union (1982–91).

The Soviet military consisted of five armed services - in their official order of importance:

* the Strategic Rocket Forces (service established in 1959)
* Ground Forces
* Air Forces
* Airborne Forces
* Air Defense Forces (separate service from 1949)
* Naval Forces
* Spetsnaz

Two other Soviet militarized forces existed: the Internal Troops (MVD Troops), subordinated to the Ministry of the Interior, and the Border Troops, subordinated to the KGB.

The February Revolution replaced the Tsar with the Russian Provisional Government, 1917 which was itself overthrown by the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. The Russian army, exhausted by its participation in World War I, was in the final stages of disintegration and collapse.

Even though Bolshevik influence in the ranks was strong, the officer corps was staffed with many who violently opposed communism. The Bolsheviks perceived the Tsarist army to be one of the foundations of the hated old regime, and decided to abolish it in favor of establishing a new military loyal to the Marxist cause. Thus the core of the Tsarist army became the core of the Russian Provisional Government army which became the core of the White Army, which in intermittent collaboration with interventionist forces from outside Russia (from Japan, Britain, France and the United States) aided the Whites and tried to contain the Red Army during the Russian Civil War.

On January 28, 1918 the Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin decreed the establishment of the Red Army, officially merging the 20,000 Red Guards, 60,000 Latvian red riflemen with 200,000 Baltic Fleet sailors and a handful of sympathetic Petrograd garrison soldiers. Leon Trotsky served as their first commissar for war.

The early Red Army was egalitarian and therefore poorly disciplined. The Bolsheviks considered military ranks and saluting to be bourgeois customs and abolished them; soldiers now elected their own leaders and voted on which orders to follow. This arrangement was abolished, however, under pressure of the Russian Civil War (1918–21), and ranks were reinstated.

During the civil war, the Bolsheviks fought counterrevolutionary groups that became known as the White armies as well as armies sponsored by Russia&#x27;s former allies such as the Britain and France, which saw a need to overthrow the Bolshevik government. The Red Army enjoyed a series of initial victories over their opponents, and in a surge of optimism Lenin ordered the Soviet Western Army to advance West in the vacuum created by the German forces retreating from the &quot;Ober-Ost&quot; areas. This operation swept the newly formed Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic and Belarusian People&#x27;s Republic and eventually lead to the Soviet invasion of Second Polish Republic, a newly independent state of the former Russian Empire. By invading Poland and initiating the Polish-Soviet War the Bolsheviks expressed their belief that they would eventually triumph over opposing capitalist forces both at home and abroad.

The overwhelming majority of professional officers in the Russian army were of nobility (dvoryanstvo); moreover, most of them had joined the White armies. Therefore, the Workers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Army initially faced a shortage of experienced military leaders. To remedy this, the Bolsheviks recruited 50,000 former Imperial Army officers to command the Red Army. At the same time, they attached political commissars to Red Army units to monitor the actions and loyalty of professional commanders, formally termed as &quot;military specialists&quot; (&quot;voyenspets&quot;, for &quot;voyenny spetsialist&quot;). By 1921 the Red Army had defeated four White armies and held off five armed foreign contingents that had intervened in the civil war, but began to face setbacks in Poland.

Polish forces managed to break a long streak of Bolshevik victories by launching a bold counteroffensive at the Battle of Warsaw in August 1920. At Warsaw the Red Army suffered a defeat so great and so unexpected that it turned the course of the entire war and eventually forced the Soviets to accept the unfavorable conditions offered by the Treaty of Riga, signed on March 18, 1921. It was the biggest defeat of the Red Army in history.

After the civil war, the Red Army became an increasingly professional military organization. With most of its five million soldiers demobilized, the Red Army was transformed into a small regular force, and territorial militias were created for wartime mobilization. Soviet military schools, established during the civil war, began to graduate large numbers of trained officers loyal to the Soviet power. In an effort to increase the prestige of the military profession, the party reestablished formal military ranks, downgraded political commissars, and eventually established the principle of one-man command.

==Development of the structure, ideology, and doctrine of the Soviet military==
===Military counterintelligence===

Throughout the history of the Soviet Army, the Soviet secret police (known variously as the Cheka, GPU, NKVD, among many others) maintained control over the counterintelligence &quot;Special Departments&quot; (Особый отдел) that existed at all larger military formations. The best known was SMERSH (1943–1946) created during the Great Patriotic War. While the staff of a Special Department of a regiment was generally known, it controlled a network of secret informants, both chekists and recruited ordinary military.

===Political doctrine===
Under the direction of Lenin and Trotsky, the Red Army claimed to adhere to Karl Marx&#x27;s proclamation that the bourgeoisie could be overcome only by a worldwide revolt of the proletariat, and to this end early Soviet military doctrine focused on spreading the revolution abroad and expanding Soviet influence throughout the world. Lenin provided an early experiment of Marx&#x27;s theory when he invaded Poland in hopes of generating a communist uprising in neighboring Germany. Lenin&#x27;s Polish expedition only complemented his March 1919 establishment of the Comintern, an organization whose sole purpose was to fight &quot;by all available means, including armed force, for the overthrow of the international bourgeoisie and for the creation of an international Soviet republic as a transition stage to the complete abolition of the State.&quot;

In keeping with the Comintern philosophy, the Red Army forcibly suppressed the anti-Soviet Basmachi Revolt in Central Asia in order to keep Turkestan in the Soviet alliance system. In 1921, a Red Army occupation of the Democratic Republic of Georgia overthrew the representative Georgian government and replaced it with a Soviet Republic. Georgia was then forcibly merged with Armenia and Azerbaijan in order to form the Transcaucasian SFSR, a member state of the Soviet Union.

===Military-party relations===
During the 1930s, Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Five Year Plans and industrialization drive built the productive base necessary to modernize the Red Army. As the likelihood of war in Europe increased later in the decade, the Soviet Union tripled its military expenditures and doubled the size of its regular forces to match the power of its potential enemies.
In 1937, however, Stalin purged the Red Army of its best military leaders. Fearing that the military posed a threat to his rule, Stalin jailed or executed many Red Army officers, estimated in thousands, including three of five marshals. These actions were to severely impair the Red Army&#x27;s capabilities in the Soviet–Finnish War (Winter War) of 1939–40 and in World War II.

Fearing the immense popularity of the armed forces after World War II, Stalin demoted war hero Marshal Georgy Zhukov and took personal credit for having saved the country. After Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953, Zhukov reemerged as a strong supporter of Nikita Khrushchev. Khrushchev rewarded Zhukov by making him minister of defense and a full Politburo member. Concern that the Soviet army might become too powerful in politics, however, led to Zhukov&#x27;s abrupt dismissal in the autumn of 1957. Khrushchev later alienated the armed forces by cutting defense expenditures on conventional forces in order to carry out his plans for economic reform.

Leonid Brezhnev&#x27;s years in power marked the height of party-military cooperation as he provided ample resources to the armed forces. In 1973 the minister of defense became a full Politburo member for the first time since 1957. Yet Brezhnev evidently felt threatened by the professional military, and he sought to create an aura of military leadership around himself in an effort to establish his authority over the armed forces.

In the early 1980s, party-military relations became strained over the issue of resource allocations to the armed forces. Despite a downturn in economic growth, the armed forces argued, often to no avail, for more resources to develop advanced conventional weapons.

Mikhail Gorbachev downgraded the role of the military in state ceremonies, including moving military representatives to the end of the leadership line-up atop Lenin&#x27;s Mausoleum during the annual Red Square military parade commemorating the October Revolution. Instead, Gorbachev emphasized civilian economic priorities and reasonable sufficiency in defense over the professional military&#x27;s perceived requirements.

===Military doctrine===
The Russian army was defeated in the First World War, a fact which strongly shaped the early stages of Red Army development. While the armies of Britain and France were content to retain strategies which had made them victorious, the Red Army proceeded to experiment and develop new tactics and concepts, developing parallel to the reborn German armed forces. The Soviets viewed themselves as a nation unique to human history and thus felt no loyalty to previous military tradition, an ideology which allowed for and prioritized innovation.

From its conception, the Red Army committed itself to emphasizing highly mobile warfare. This decision was influenced by the formative wars of its history, namely the Russian Civil War and the Polish–Soviet War. Both of these conflicts had little in common with the static trench warfare of the First World War. Instead, they featured long range mobile operations, often by small but highly motivated forces, as well as rapid advances of hundreds of kilometers in a matter of days.

Under Lenin&#x27;s New Economic Policy, the Soviet Union had few resources to devote to the Red Army during its formative years in the 1920s. This changed only when Stalin began the industrialisation drive in 1929, a policy created in part to allow for unprecedented funds to be dedicated to the military.
Using these new resources, the Red Army of the 1930s developed a highly sophisticated concept of mobile warfare which relied on huge formations of tanks, aircraft, and airborne troops designed to break through the enemy&#x27;s line and carry the battle deep to the enemy&#x27;s rear. Soviet industry responded, supplying tanks, aircraft and other equipment in sufficient numbers to make such operations practical. To avoid overestimating the power of the Soviet army, although before 1941 Soviet formations of a given level were at least equal to and often stronger than equivalent formations of other armies, huge wartime losses and reorganisation based on war experience reversed the trend during the later war years. Thus, for example, the Soviet Tank Corps was equivalent in armored vehicle power to an American armored division, and a Soviet rifle (infantry) division, unless specifically reinforced, was often equivalent to an American infantry regiment.

The Soviets developed their armament factories under the assumption that during the war they would have to rebuild the whole equipment of the ground and air forces many times over. This assumption was indeed proven correct during the four-year-long war.

The Red Army&#x27;s focus on mobile operations in the early 1930s was gravely disrupted by Stalin&#x27;s purge of the military&#x27;s leadership. Since the new doctrines were associated with officers who had been declared enemies of the state, the support for them declined. Many large mechanised formations were disbanded, with the tanks distributed to support the infantry. After the German blitzkrieg proved its potency in Poland and France, the Red Army started a frantic effort to rebuild the large mechanised corps, but the task was only partly finished when the Wehrmacht attacked in 1941. The huge tank forces, powerful only on paper, were mostly annihilated by the Germans in the first months of Operation Barbarossa. Another factor contributing to the initial defeat was that the Soviet post-World War I rearmament effort was started too early, and in 1941 the majority of Soviet equipment was obsolete and inferior to that of the Wehrmacht.

In the initial period of the war, in the face of catastrophic losses, the Red Army drastically scaled down its armored formations, with the tank brigade becoming the largest commonly deployed armored unit, and reverted to a simpler mode of operations. Nevertheless, the revolutionary doctrines of the 1930s, modified by combat experience, were eventually successfully used at the front starting in 1943 after the Red Army regained the initiative.

==Practical deployment of the Soviet military==
===Interwar period===

Following the death of Lenin, the Soviet Union was enmeshed in a struggle for succession that pitted Trotsky and his policy of &quot;world revolution&quot; against Stalin and his policy of &quot;socialism in one country.&quot; Thanks to his control over and support from the Party and state bureaucracy, Stalin prevailed and Trotsky was removed as war commissar in 1925, resulting in a turn away from the policy of spreading the revolution abroad in favour of focusing on domestic issues and defending the country against the possibility of foreign invasion.

Eager to dispose of Trotsky&#x27;s political and military supporters, Stalin directed the execution of eight high-ranking generals between 1935 and 1938. Primary among these was Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky, leader of the Soviet invasion of Poland.

Despite Stalin&#x27;s isolationist policies, and even though the Soviet Union&#x27;s borders would remain static for fifteen years following Lenin&#x27;s death, the Soviets continued to involve themselves in international affairs, and the Comintern was instrumental in establishing the Communist parties of China in 1921 and Indochina in 1930. Additionally, the Red Army played a crucial role in the Spanish Civil War, supplying over 1,000 aircraft, 900 tanks, 1,500 artillery pieces, 300 armored cars, hundreds of thousands of small arms and 30,000 tons of ammunition to the Republican cause.

Soviet participation in the Spanish Civil War was greatly influenced by the growing tension between Stalin and Adolf Hitler, the leader of Nazi Germany and an avid supporter of the fascist forces of Francisco Franco. Nazi–Soviet relations were tempered by Hitler&#x27;s personal hatred for communist ideology and for wanting to expand German territories. Direct armed conflict between Germany and the Soviet Union was delayed by the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact on August 23, 1939, which essentially divided the nations of Eastern Europe into two spheres of interest, one belonging to the Soviets and the other to the Nazis.

The Soviet Union sold arms to the Governor of Xinjiang province of the Republic of China, Jin Shuren, and help install his successor Sheng Shicai in 1934 as their puppet governor. They intervened militarily in an invasion of Xinjiang against the Chinese Muslims 36th Division (National Revolutionary Army) and Han chinese troops led by the Chinese Muslim General Ma Zhongying and the Han chinese general Zhang Peiyuan when they were on the verge of defeating Sheng&#x27;s manchurian and white Russian troops. 2 brigades of 7,000 men, armed with tanks, planes, mustard gas, and armored cars were the Soviet forces which invaded. After fierce fighting, in which mustard gas was used by the Soviet Union at the Battle of Tutung, Ma Zhongying retreated and Zhang committed suicide to avoid capture. During the battle, the chinese Muslims reportedly dressed up in sheepskins and stormed Soviet machine guns posts with swords. Ma encountered a Red Army column at the Battle of Dawan Cheng and wiped out the entire column, his Muslim troops rolled the wrecked Soviet armored cars off the mountainside. The Soviet Union intervened again in the Xinjiang War (1937), invading with 5,000 troops and using planes with mustard gas.

In late 1930s, Soviet Union was no longer satisfied with the status quo in its relations with independent countries of Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania. This came as a result of a change in Soviet foreign policy. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact gave a great opportunity to recover the provinces of Imperial Russia lost during the chaos of the October Revolution and the Russian Civil War. As a result of this pact, on 1 September, the Germans invaded Poland from the west. When the Poles were close to defeat and the Polish government left the country, on 17 September the Red Army invaded Poland from the east to regain the territories populated mostly by ethnic Belarusians and Ukrainians.

Next, Soviet Union sent ultimatums to the Baltic states and gained control in September and October. The Soviet Union had negotiated with the Finns for over a year, but the Finns refused Soviet demands. The Red Army launched the Winter War on November 30, 1939 with the goal of annexing Finland. Simultaneously, a puppet regime, called the Finnish Democratic Republic, was created by the Soviets. The initial period of the war proved disastrous for the Soviet military. Finnish victories in the Battle of Suomussalmi and the Battle of Raate Road thwarted Soviet attempts to reach Oulu and cut the country in half. Further south, the Soviets reached the Mannerheim Line, but staunch Finnish resistance prevented the Red Army from advancing past it, with the Soviets taking severe casualties in the process. The Soviet Union was expelled from the League of Nations on December 14, 1939.

On January 29, 1940, the Soviets put an end to their Finnish Democratic Republic puppet government and recognized the sitting government in Helsinki as the legal government of Finland, informing it that they were willing to negotiate peace. The Soviets reorganized their forces and launched a new offensive along the Karelian Isthmus in February 1940. Soviet forces broke through the Mannerheim Line and began progressing westward as Soviet peace proposals were given to the Finnish government. As fighting in Viipuri raged and the hope of foreign intervention faded, the Finns accepted peace terms on March 12, 1940 with the signing of the Moscow Peace Treaty. Fighting ended the following day. The Finns had retained their independence, but ceded 9% of Finnish territory to the Soviet Union.

===World War II===


The Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 established a non-aggression treaty between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union with a secret protocol describing how Poland and the Baltic countries would be divided between them. In the invasion of Poland of 1939 the two powers invaded and partitioned Poland, and in June 1940 the Soviet Union also occupied Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.

The Red Army had little time to correct its numerous deficiencies before Nazi Germany and other Axis countries allied with it swept across the newly relocated Soviet border on June 22, 1941, in the opening stages of Operation Barbarossa. The poor Soviet performance in the Winter War against Finland encouraged Hitler to ignore the terms of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and take the Red Army by surprise. During the initial stages of the war, Soviet forces were often ordered to stand their ground despite limited defensive capabilities, resulting in numerous encirclements and correspondingly high numbers of casualties.

The United States program of lend-lease was extended to Soviet Union in September 1941, supplying planes, tanks, trucks and other war materials. Eventually the Soviets managed to slow the Wehrmacht&#x27;s blitzkrieg, halting the Nazi offensive in December 1941 outside the gates of Moscow, in part because mobilized troops with winterized clothing from Siberia were transferred from there after Stalin realized that Japan was not going to attack the Soviet Union (Japan had just attacked Pearl Harbor). The Red Army launched a powerful winter counteroffensive which pushed the Germans back from the outskirts of Moscow. At the start of 1942, the weakened Axis armies abandoned their march on Moscow and advanced south towards the Caucasus and Volga river. This offensive, in turn, ran out of steam in autumn 1942, allowing the Soviet forces to stage a devastating counteroffensive on the overextended enemy. The Red Army encircled and destroyed significant German forces at the Battle of Stalingrad, which ended in February 1943 and reversed the tide of the war in Europe.

In the summer of 1943, following the Battle of Kursk, the Red Army seized the strategic initiative for the remainder of the war. All Soviet territory was liberated from Axis occupation by 1944. After having driven the Axis armies out of Eastern Europe, in May 1945 the Red Army launched its assault on Berlin, which effectively ended World War II in Europe (see V-E Day). Much of Eastern Europe and great parts of the Soviet Union were devastated by Red Army troops as a result of an aggressive policy of &quot;scorched earth&quot;. Once Germany had surrendered, the Red Army joined the war against Japan, and in summer 1945 carried out an offensive against Japanese forces stationed in northern Manchuria. The Red Army emerged from the war as one of the most powerful land armies in history with five million soldiers, and more tanks and artillery than all other countries combined.

The defeat of the Wehrmacht had come, however, at the cost of over eight million soldiers and as much as fifteen million civilians dead, by far the highest losses of any country during the war. This is believed to be the highest human death toll from any military conflict.

===The Cold War and conventional forces===

By the end of World War II, the Soviet Union had a standing army of 10 to 13 million men. During and right after the war, the Red Army was by far the most powerful land army in the world. Immediately following Germany&#x27;s surrender, this number was reduced to five million; this decline was indicative not of diminishing interest in the Soviet military but rather of a growing interest in establishing more modern and mobile armed forces. This policy resulted in the 1949 introduction of the AK-47, designed two years earlier as an improvement on the submachine gun which supplied Soviet infantry with a rugged and reliable source of short-range firepower. Also important was the 1967 introduction of the BMP-1, the first mass-used infantry fighting vehicles commissioned by any armed force in the world. These innovations would help direct the course of Soviet military operations throughout the Cold War.

The Soviet military assisted the Second East Turkestan Republic during the Ili Rebellion.

The Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic became involved in a border dispute with the Republic of China during the Pei-ta-shan Incident, Soviet Russian and Mongol forces attempted to occupy and raid Chinese territory, in response, a Chinese Muslim Hui cavalry regiment, the 14th Tungan Tungan Cavalry regiment was sent by the Chinese government to attack Mongol and Soviet positions.

Many of the Soviet forces who fought to liberate the countries of Eastern Europe from Nazi control remained in the region even after Germany&#x27;s surrender in 1945. Stalin used this military occupation to establish satellite states, creating a buffer zone between Germany and the Soviet Union. The Soviets quickly became an enormous political and economic influence in the region and the Soviet Union actively assisted local communist parties in coming to power. By 1948, seven eastern European countries had communist governments.

In this setting, the Cold War emerged from a conflict between Stalin and U.S. President Harry S. Truman over the future of Eastern Europe during the Potsdam Conference in 1945. Truman charged that Stalin had betrayed the agreement made at the Yalta Conference. With Eastern Europe under Red Army occupation, the Soviet Union remained adamant in the face of Truman&#x27;s attempt to stop Communist expansion, and in 1955 Moscow introduced the Warsaw Pact to counterbalance the Western NATO alliance.

Conventional military power showed its continued influence when the Soviet Union used its troops to invade Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 to suppress the democratic aspirations of their peoples and keep these countries within the Soviet regime. The Soviet Union and the western forces, led by the US, faced a number of standoffs that threatened to turn into live conflicts, such as the Berlin Blockade of 1948–49 and the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, which saw &quot;hawks&quot; on both sides push the respective rivals closer towards war due to policies of brinksmanship. This attitude was tempered by fears of a nuclear conflict and desires among moderates for détente.

Under Khrushchev&#x27;s leadership, Soviet relations with Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s Yugoslavia were finally repaired with the 1956 dissolution of the Cominform. This decision generated a further rift between the Soviet Union and the People&#x27;s Republic of China, a neighboring communist state which felt the Soviets were turning their back on the fundamental Marxist–Leninist struggle for the worldwide triumph of communism. This Sino-Soviet split erupted in 1967 when the Red Guard besieged the Soviet embassy in Beijing. Additional conflicts along the Sino-Soviet border followed in 1969.

Tension between the political forces in Moscow and Beijing would greatly influence Asian politics during the 1960s and 1970s, and a microcosm of the Sino-Soviet split emerged when the by-then late-Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s Soviet-aligned Vietnam invaded Pol Pot&#x27;s pro-Chinese Cambodia in 1978. The Soviets had ensured the loyalty of Vietnam and Laos through an aggressive campaign of political, economic and military aid – the same tactic which allowed the Soviet Union to compete with the United States in a race to establish themselves as neocolonial rulers of newly independent states in Africa and the Middle East. Extensive arms sales made weapons like the AK-47 and the T-55 tank icons of the contemporary wars between Israel and its Arab neighbors.

Also significant was the 1968 declaration of the Brezhnev Doctrine which officially asserted the Soviet Union&#x27;s right to intervene in other nation&#x27;s internal affairs in order to secure socialism from opposing capitalist forces. This doctrine was used to justify the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. In Afghanistan the Soviet forces met a fierce resistance from the Afghans who were supported by the CIA. Battling an opposition that relied on guerrilla tactics and asymmetric warfare, the massive Soviet war machine proved incapable of achieving decisive victories and the entire campaign quickly devolved into a quagmire not unlike that which the U.S. faced a decade earlier in the Vietnam War. After ten years of fighting at the cost of approximately 20 billion dollars a year (in 1986 United States dollars) and 15,000 Soviet casualties, Gorbachev surrendered to public opinion and ordered troops to withdraw in early 1989.

===The Cold War and nuclear weapons===

The Soviet Union tested their first atomic bomb codenamed &quot;First Lightning&quot; on 29 August 1949, four years after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, surprising many Western commentators who had expected the U.S. monopoly to last for some time longer. It soon came out that the Soviet atomic bomb project had received a considerable amount of espionage information about the wartime Manhattan Project, and that its first bomb was largely a purposeful copy of the U.S. &quot;Fat Man&quot; model. More important from the perspective of the speed of the Soviet program, the Soviets had developed more uranium reserves than specialists in the American military had thought possible. From the late 1940s, the Soviet armed forces focused on adapting to the Cold War in the era of nuclear arms by achieving parity with the United States in strategic nuclear weapons.

Though the Soviet Union had proposed various nuclear disarmament plans after the U.S. development of atomic weapons in the Second World War, the Cold War saw the Soviets in the process of developing and deploying nuclear weapons in full force. It would not be until the 1960s that the United States and the Soviet Union finally agreed to ban weapon buildups in Antarctica and nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere, outer space, and underwater.

By the late 1960s, the Soviet Union had reached a rough parity with the United States in some categories of strategic weaponry, and at that time offered to negotiate limits on strategic nuclear weapons deployments. The Soviet Union wished to constrain U.S. deployment of an antiballistic missile (ABM) system and retain the ability to place multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRVs).

The Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty began in November 1969 in Helsinki. The interim agreement signed in Moscow in May 1972 froze existing levels of deployment of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and regulated the growth of submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). As part of the SALT process, the ABM Treaty was also signed.

The SALT agreements were generally considered in the West as having codified the concept of Mutually assured destruction (MAD), or deterrence. Both the U.S. and the Soviet Union recognized their mutual vulnerability to massive destruction, no matter which state launched nuclear weapons first. A second SALT agreement, SALT II, was signed in June 1979 in Vienna. Among other provisions, it placed an aggregate ceiling on ICBM and SLBM launchers. The second SALT agreement was never ratified by the United States Senate, in large part because of the breakdown of &quot;détente&quot; in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

At one time, the Soviet Union maintained the world&#x27;s largest nuclear arsenal in history. According to estimates by the Natural Resources Defense Council, the peak of approximately 45,000 warheads was reached in 1986. Roughly 20,000 of these were believed to be tactical nuclear weapons, reflecting the Red Army doctrine that favored the use of these weapons if war came in Europe. The remainder (approximately 25,000) were strategic ICBMs. These weapons were considered both offensive and defensive in nature. The production of these weapons is one of the factors that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union.

==Military-industrial complex and the economy==
With the notable exception of Khrushchev and possibly Gorbachev, Soviet leaders from
the late 1920s onwards emphasized military production over investment in the civilian economy. The high priority given to military production traditionally enabled military-industrial enterprises to commandeer the best managers, labor, and materials from civilian plants. As a result, the Soviet Union produced some of the world&#x27;s most advanced armaments. In the late 1980s, however, Gorbachev transferred some leading defense-industry officials to the civilian sector of the economy in an effort to make it as efficient as its military counterpart.

The integration of the party, government, and military in the Soviet Union became most evident in the area of defense-related industrial production.
Gosplan, the state planning committee, had an important role in directing necessary supplies and resources to military industries. The Soviet Defense Council made decisions on the development and production of major weapons-systems. The Defense Industry Department of the Central Committee supervised all military industries as the executive agent of the Defense Council. Within the government, a Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers headed the Military Industrial Commission, which coordinated the activities of many industrial ministries, state committees, research-and-development organizations, and factories and enterprises that designed and produced arms and equipment for the armed forces.

In the late 1980s the Soviet Union devoted a quarter of its gross economic output to the defense sector (at the time most Western analysts put the figure at 15%). At the time, the military–industrial complex employed at least one of every five adults in the Soviet Union. In some regions of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, at least half of the workforce was employed in defense plants. (The comparable U.S. figures were roughly one-sixteenth of gross national product and about one of every sixteen in the workforce.) In 1989, one-fourth of the entire Soviet population was engaged in military activities, whether active duty, military production, or civilian military training.

==Collapse of the Soviet Union and the military==
The political and economic chaos of the late 1980s and early 1990s soon erupted into the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact and the collapse of the Soviet Union. The political chaos and rapid economic liberalization, the infamous IMF shock therapy, had an enormously negative impact on the strength and funding of the military. In 1985, the Soviet military had about 5.3 million men; by 1990 the number declined to about four million. At the time the Soviet Union dissolved, the residual forces belonging to the Russian Federation were 2.7 million strong. Almost all of this drop occurred in a three-year period between 1989 and 1991.

The first contribution to this was a large unilateral reduction which began with an announcement by Gorbachev in December 1988; these reductions continued as a result of the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and in accordance with Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaties. The second reason for the decline was the widespread resistance to conscription which developed as the policy of glasnost revealed to the public the true conditions inside the Soviet army and the widespread abuse of conscript soldiers.

As the Soviet Union moved towards disintegration in 1991, the huge Soviet military played a surprisingly feeble and ineffective role in propping up the dying Soviet system. The military got involved in trying to suppress conflicts and unrest in Central Asia and the Caucasus, but it often proved incapable of restoring peace and order. On April 9, 1989, the army, together with MVD units, killed 20 demonstrators in Tbilisi in Georgia. The next major crisis occurred in Azerbaijan, when the Soviet army forcibly entered Baku on January 19–20, 1990, resulting in the death of 137 people. On January 13, 1991 Soviet forces stormed the State Radio and Television Building and the television retranslation tower in Vilnius, Lithuania, both under opposition control, killing 14 people and injuring 700. This action was perceived by many as heavy-handed and achieved little.

At the crucial moments of the August Coup, arguably the last attempt by the Soviet hardliners to prevent the breakup of the state, some military units did enter Moscow to act against Boris Yeltsin but ultimately refused to crush the protesters surrounding the Russian parliament building. In effect, the leadership of the Soviet military decided to side with Gorbachev and Yeltsin, and thus finally doomed the old order.

As the Soviet Union officially dissolved on December 31, 1991, the Soviet military was left in limbo. For the next year and a half various attempts to keep its unity and transform it into the military of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) failed. Steadily, the units stationed in Ukraine and some other breakaway republics swore loyalty to their new national governments, while a series of treaties between the newly independent states divided up the military&#x27;s assets. In mid-March 1992, Yeltsin appointed himself as the new Russian minister of defence, marking a crucial step in the creation of the new Russian armed forces, comprising the bulk of what was still left of the military. The last vestiges of the old Soviet command structure were finally dissolved in June 1993.

In the next few years, Russian forces withdrew from central and eastern Europe, as well as from some newly independent post-Soviet republics. While in most places the withdrawal took place without any problems, the Russian army remained in some disputed areas such as the Sevastopol naval base in the Crimea as well as in Abkhazia and Transnistria.

The loss of recruits and industrial capacity in breakaway republics, as well as the breakdown of the Russian economy, caused a devastating decline in the capacity of post-Soviet Russian armed forces in the decade following 1992.

Most of the nuclear stockpile was inherited by Russia. Additional weapons were acquired by Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan. Amid fears of nuclear proliferation, these were all certified as transferred to Russia by 1996. Uzbekistan is another former Soviet republic where nuclear weapons may once have been stationed, but they are now signatories of the Nuclear non-proliferation treaty.

In addition to explicit wars, the Soviet military took part in a number of internal conflicts in various countries, as well as proxy wars between third countries as a means of advancing their strategic interests while avoiding direct conflict between the superpowers in the nuclear age (or, in the case of the Spanish Civil War, avoiding a direct conflict with Nazi Germany at a time when neither side was prepared for such a war). In many cases, involvement was in the form of military advisors as well as the sale or provision of weapons.

<doc id="1336708" wikidata="Q133944" url="?curid=1336708" title="Peter Gabriel (1978 album)">
<text>Peter Gabriel is the second studio album by the English singer-songwriter Peter Gabriel, released on 2 June 1978 by Charisma Records. Gabriel started recording the album in November 1977, the same month that he had completed touring in support of his debut solo release. He employed former King Crimson guitarist Robert Fripp, who was part of Gabriel&#x27;s early touring band, to produce the album. Fripp used his Frippertronics effects on the co-written song &quot;Exposure&quot;.

The album&#x27;s cover artwork by Hipgnosis led to it becoming known as Scratch to differentiate it from Gabriel&#x27;s other eponymously titled albums. Some music streaming services refer to it as Peter Gabriel 2: Scratch.

The album reached No. 10 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 45 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Albums chart.

==Background==

Gabriel briefly considered working again with the producer of his first album, Bob Ezrin, but ultimately decided against it. Gabriel instead selected Robert Fripp. Compared to Ezrin, who was more insistent on dictating the arrangements, Fripp favoured a more spontaneous work process that allowed Gabriel to contribute his own musical ideas. Gabriel credited Fripp with creating a studio environment that was conducive to creativity.

Robert&#x27;s approach to the process of recording was very good. He likes situations to happen rather than make them happen. On the first album I wasn&#x27;t confident of my own ability in arrangement, whereas on the last one I was a lot more confident and had definite ideas.

Fripp utilised his Frippertronics technique on the track &quot;Exposure&quot;, which he and Gabriel cowrote. He later recorded a version of the song as the title track of his 1979 solo album &quot;Exposure&quot;.

During the assembly of the album package, Fripp wanted to express his belief that he abdicated too much creative control to Gabriel by including the phrase &quot;Produced by Robert Fripp for Peter Gabriel&quot; in the liner notes. Gabriel said that Fripp suggested this credit &quot;because some of the style of the sound was not altogether what he wanted. He didn&#x27;t want people to think that was exactly how he would have interpreted the music&quot;.

In a 1980 interview with &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, Gabriel stated that he failed to attain the results he desired on his second solo release in part because of his creative differences with Fripp. Gabriel believed that Fripp lacked an understanding on how to effectively record synthesisers and said that the two &quot;spent too much time on theoretical arguments.&quot; He also expressed his opinion that &quot;On the Air&quot; and &quot;White Shadow&quot; were the only songs on the album that received sufficient attention in the recording studio. Larry Fast, who played synthesisers on the album, thought that Fripp&#x27;s production choices did not aversely impact his contributions and felt that the drier and more intimate arrangements dictated which &quot;sonic colors and textures and spaces to work with.&quot;

== Artwork ==
The cover depicts an image of Gabriel with several vertical grooves gouged into it that end at his fingertips. He stands with hands raised, palms facing himself, and fingers bent to simulate the appearance of tearing the image. The effect was achieved by gluing strips of torn paper onto a photo of Gabriel in the appropriate pose, taken by photographer Peter Christopherson, then using Tipp-Ex correction fluid to touch up the spots where they met his fingers.

== Critical reception ==
In &quot;NME&quot;, Nick Kent wrote that the album&#x27;s &quot;brazenly left-field veneer left me cold at first, and it&#x27;s only now that its strengths are starting to come across ... once past the disarming non-focus veneer, there&#x27;s a quietly remarkable talent at work – quiet in the manner of the slow fuse burn of &#x27;Mother of Violence&#x27; with Roy Bittan&#x27;s piano work outstripping anything he&#x27;s turned out for either Bruce Springsteen or David Bowie. Closer to the root of the album, there&#x27;s a purity, a strength to the songs individual enough to mark Gabriel out as a man whose creative zenith is close at hand.&quot;

== Track listing ==

* On original LP pressings of the album, the audio of &quot;White Shadow&quot; (the last song on side one) continued into a locked groove.
* Some editions of the cassette release had a different running order. &quot;A Wonderful Day in a One-Way World&quot; was track 11, &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot; was track 5, and &quot;White Shadow&quot; was track 4.
* The original B-side of the single &quot;D.I.Y.&quot; is a longer version of &quot;Perspective&quot; edited for the album and all subsequent releases.

<text>Count Iosif Vladimirovich Romeyko-Gurko (;  – ), also known as Joseph or Ossip Gourko, was a prominent Russian field marshal during the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878).

==Biography==

=== Career ===
Of Belarusian extraction, Gurko was educated in the Imperial Corps of Pages, entered the hussars of the Imperial Guard as a sub-lieutenant in 1846, became captain in 1857, adjutant to Alexander II of Russia in 1860, colonel in 1861, commander of the 4th Hussar Regiment of Mariupol in 1866, and major-general of the emperor&#x27;s suite in 1867.

He subsequently commanded the grenadier regiment, and in 1873 the 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, of the cavalry of the Imperial Guard. Although he took part in the Crimean War, being stationed at Belbek, his claim to distinction is due to his service in the Turkish war of 1877. He led the spearhead of the Russian invasion, took Tarnovo on July 7, crossed the Balkans by the Haim Boaz pass—which debouches near Hainkyoi—and, despite considerable resistance, captured Uflani, Maglizh and Kazanlak; on July 18 he attacked Shipka, which was evacuated by the Turks the following day. Thus within 16 days of crossing the Danube, Gourko had secured three Balkan passes and created a panic at Constantinople.

He then made a series of successful reconnaissances of the Tundzha valley, cut the railway in two places, occupied Stara Zagora () and Nova Zagora (), checked the advance of Suleiman Pasha&#x27;s army and returned again over the Balkans. In October he was appointed commander of the allied cavalry, and attacked the Plevna line of communication to Orhanie with a large mixed force, captured Gorni-Dubnik, Telish and Vratsa and, in the middle of November, Orhanie itself. Pleven was isolated, and after its liberation in December Gourko led his troops amidst snow and ice over the Balkans to the fertile valley beyond. He liberated Sofia and decisively defeated Suleiman Pasha at the Battle of Philippopolis and occupied Adrianople. The armistice at the end of January 1878 stopped further operations. With the help of Carol I of Romania and a few other Russian commanders such as : Michael Nikolaevich and Iosif Vladimirovich Gourko, the Russian Empire won the war. After the Russian victory, the Treaty of Berlin was signed, granting independence to Romania, Serbia and Montenegro.

=== Governor-General of Warsaw ===
In 1879–1880, Gurko was a governor of St. Petersburg, and from 1883 to 1894 Governor-General of Poland, where he enforced the Russification policies of Alexander III. While in office as Governor-General of Poland, he carried out significant training maneuvers involving troops from all over the Empire. In late 1883, notable military preparations took place along the Austrian and German borders. This included enhancing the military readiness of railways and steamships which led to delays in grain shipments on the Black Sea. Troops were also stationed between the Vistula and Bug rivers. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Gourko gave a speech in 1883 where he claimed that the defense against all enemies, regardless of German opinion, was &quot;the cause of all Slavs.&quot; The anti-German nature of his rhetoric generated concern that he would be removed from office.

In 1887, observers in Europe noted the buildup of troops in Russian Poland.

In 1890, Gourko was summoned to St. Petersburg, again sparking rumors that he would be removed from his post as governor. The &quot;Times of London&quot; reported that he would remain in office and that this was the preferred outcome to the Poles. According to the &quot;Times&quot;, the Poles considered him neither hard nor unjust at that time.

In 1892, notable construction projects were underway including roads, railways, and fortifications. These projects employed 150,000 Poles. In that same year, Gourko heard complaints from factory workers about &quot;brutal treatment&quot; from German overseers. In response, he issued a policy requiring factory overseers to be able to speak Russian and Polish perfectly.

During the cholera epidemic in 1892, Gourko held a conference in Warsaw to decide a response to the spread of the disease. Attendees to the conference included regional governors and police officials.

According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Gourko also played a role in carrying out expulsions from Russian Poland.

=== Later life ===
Gourko experienced paralysis on the entire left side of his body in 1894.

He died in 1901, near the city of Tver.

==Honour==
Gurko was made a count and decorated with the 2nd class of St. George, Order of the Cross of Takovo and other orders.

Gurkovo town in South-central Bulgaria and General Yosif V. Gurko Street in Sofia, Bulgaria are named after him.

<doc id="1336719" wikidata="Q336335" url="?curid=1336719" title="Lionel Tennyson, 3rd Baron Tennyson">
<text>Lionel Hallam Tennyson, 3rd Baron Tennyson (7 November 1889 – 6 June 1951) was known principally as a first-class cricketer who captained Hampshire and England. He was the grandson of the poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson.

==Early life and family==
The son of Hallam Tennyson, the Governor of South Australia, Tennyson was born at Westminster in November 1889. His father would later be appointed Governor-General of Australia in 1903. He had lived in Australia since 1899, with his father and mother, Audrey, along with his siblings. He was initially educated in Australia at Melbourne Grammar School, where he first played cricket, before attending Eton College in England. There, he played for the college cricket team, initially as a fast bowler in 1907, before focussing on his batting in 1908. From there, he matriculated to Trinity College, Cambridge. He performed well in the freshmans match, but did not play for Cambridge University Cricket Club. He left Cambridge after one year, in order to join the British Army.

==Military service==
Tennyson was commissioned into the Coldstream Guards as a second lieutenant in August 1909, before transferring to the Rifle Brigade in December 1912. His transfer allegedly came about from an agreement he reached with his father after losing £12,000 in the space of a week betting on horse racing, which had left him with £7,000 debt.

He served in the First World War with the Rifle Brigade, seeing action in September 1914 at the First Battle of the Marne. In October he was wounded in action, having been shot in the leg, causing him to fall into a trench and tear his ligaments. He was sent back home to recuperate, travelling home on board the , where he was informed by the wounded Lord Francis Scott that he had been pronounced dead by newspapers back home. He was promoted to lieutenant in December 1914, antedated to November 1914. Having recovered from his wound, Tennyson was seconded to headquarters as a staff captain to General Roy in March 1915, and returned to the Western Front in July 1915. Tennyson saw action in the allied defeat at the Battle of Loos in September–October 1915, with his promotion to captain occurring shortly after, but was not gazetted until March 1916. 

Upon his promotion to captain, Tennyson undertook a machine gun course at Wisques and was shortly thereafter ordered to join the staff of General William Pulteney; however, his appointment to Pulteney was short-lived, as his brigade was ordered to the Ypres Salient and General Roy requested his return to his staff. He was made an acting major in July 1917, while commanding a battalion. Tennyson was wounded in action three times during the war, and was mentioned in despatches twice. He was decorated during the war with the Mons Star, and following the war with the Victory and General Service Medal&#x27;s. His two younger brothers were killed in the war. 

Tennyson resigned his commission in November 1919, one year after the conclusion of war, at which point he was granted the rank of major. He was later appointed Honorary Colonel of the 51st (London) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery (a Territorial Army unit based in Chelsea, London) on 9 August 1931 and held the position until 1947.

==Cricket==
===Pre-war cricket and Test debut===
Tennyson made his debut in first-class cricket for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against Oxford University at Lord&#x27;s in 1913, making a century on debut when he scored 110 runs in the MCC second innings. In the same year, he also made his debut for Hampshire in the County Championship, with Tennyson playing nine times for Hampshire in 1913. He made three centuries in his debut season, in which he scored 832 runs at an average of 46.22. He scored heavily alongside Cecil Abercrombie, with the two going some way to compensate for the loss of C. B. Fry from the Hampshire team. Following his successful first season, the MCC offered him a place on the winter tour to South Africa as a replacement for Frederick Fane, which he accepted. Tennyson departed with the team on the Union-Castle Line steamer from Southampton on 18 October 1913, with his parents amongst the crowd of well-wishers who saw the team off.

Tennyson played in the first five first-class matches of the tour against provincial and regional teams, before making his Test debut for England against South Africa at Durban on 13 December; he made 52 batting at number four in England&#x27;s only innings. Tennyson played in all five Test matches on the tour, scoring 116 runs at an average of 16.57. He also played in eight further first-class matches on the tour against provincial and regional teams, though he failed to make a century in any of his first-class tour matches. For his performances in 1913, Tennyson was named one of &quot;Wisden&#x27;s&quot; five Cricketers of the Year for 1914. Military duties and the outbreak of the First World War limited Tennyson to five first-class appearances in 1914, making three appearances for Hampshire in the County Championship while on leave. He played in the match between the MCC South African Touring Team against The Rest, which celebrated Lord&#x27;s centenary. He also played for the British Army cricket team against the Royal Navy.

===Hampshire and England captaincies===
Tennyson played nine Test matches for England, five of them on the tour of South Africa under Johnny Douglas in 1913/14. In 1921, England having lost six Test matches in succession to the Australians under Warwick Armstrong, Tennyson was recalled to the side for the second Test at Lord&#x27;s, and though the game was again lost, he scored an undefeated 74 in the second innings against Jack Gregory and Ted McDonald at their fastest. That innings led him to be appointed captain for the three remaining matches of the series, succeeding Douglas. The next game was lost; the final two matches were left drawn. At Headingley in the first of these three games as captain, Tennyson split his hand while fielding in the Australians&#x27; first innings but, patched up with what Wisden called a &quot;basket guard&quot;, he made 63 and 36. He led several non-Test match tours overseas, to India, South Africa and the West Indies.

Tennyson was captain of Hampshire from 1919 to 1932. He was in charge of the side in the remarkable match against Warwickshire in 1922, when Hampshire were bowled out for 15 runs in their first innings and, having been forced to follow on, then scored 521 in the second innings and won the match by 155 runs.

In 1933 he published his autobiography, &quot;From Verse to Worse&quot;. Returning from his second war-wound to the Western Front he records: &quot;I have never liked &#x27;travelling light&#x27;, and so, though the amount of kit I arrived with may, in fact, have aroused a certain amount of astonishment, I was quickly forgiven by my commanding officer as well as by everyone else, when they found out that it included, amongst other things, a case of champagne.&quot; He published a second volume of memoirs, &quot;Sticky Wickets&quot;, in 1950.

==Family and personal life==
He succeeded his father, Hallam Tennyson, 2nd Baron Tennyson, to the title in 1928, having been known before that as Hon. Lionel Tennyson. He married Hon. Clare Tennant in 1918. They had three sons before they divorced in 1928:

* Harold Tennyson, 4th Baron Tennyson (1919–1991), died unmarried
* Mark Tennyson, 5th Baron Tennyson (1920–2006), married Deline Celeste Budler but died without issue
* Lionel Tennyson (1925–1925), died in infancy

He was later married to Carroll Donner (née Elting) from 1934 until their divorce in 1943.

<text>The Gouffier family was an old French noble family that owned the estate of Bonnivet in Poitou from the 14th century. There were many branches of this family, the chief of them being the dukes of Roannais, the counts of Caravas, the lords of Crévecoeur and of Bonnivet, the marquises of Thois, of Brazeux, and of Espagny. The name of Gouffier was adopted in the 18th century by a branch of the house of Choiseul, to produce the house of Choiseul-Gouffier. 

== Genealogy ==
*Guillaume Gouffier, chamberlain to Charles VII, was an inveterate enemy of Jacques Coeur, obtaining his condemnation and afterwards receiving his property (1491). He had a great number of children, several of whom played a part in history:
**Artus Gouffier, seigneur de Boisy (c. 1475–1520) was entrusted with the education of the young count of Angoulême, and on the accession of this prince to the throne as Francis I became grand master of the royal household, playing an important part in the government; to him was given the task of negotiating the treaty of Noyon in 1516; and shortly before his death the king raised the estates of Roanne and Boisy to the rank of a duchy, that of Roannais, in his favor.
***Claude Gouffier, son of Artus, was created comte de Maulevrier (1542) and marquis de Boisy (1564).
**Adrien Gouffier (died 1523) was bishop of Coutances and bishop of Albi, and grand almoner of France.
**Guillaume Gouffier, became admiral of France.
**Charlotte Gouffier de Boisy, Governess to the Children of France
** (died 1528), bishop of Albi

<text>Parinacota (in Hispanicized spelling), Parina Quta or Parinaquta is a dormant stratovolcano on the border of Bolivia and Chile. Together with Pomerape it forms the Nevados de Payachata volcanic chain. Part of the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes, its summit reaches an elevation of above sea level. The symmetrical cone is capped by a summit crater with widths of or . Farther down on the southern slopes lie three parasitic centres known as the Ajata cones. These cones have generated lava flows. The volcano overlies a platform formed by lava domes and andesitic lava flows.

The volcano started growing during the Pleistocene and formed a large cone. At some point between the Pleistocene and the Holocene, the western flank of the volcano collapsed, generating a giant landslide that spread west and formed a large, hummocky landslide deposit. The avalanche crossed and dammed a previously existing drainage, impounding or enlarging Lake Chungará; numerous other lakes now forming the headwaters of the Rio Lauca sprang up within the deposit. Volcanic activity rebuilt the cone after the collapse, cancelling out the collapse scar.

Parinacota had numerous effusive and explosive eruptions during the Holocene, the latest about 200 years ago. While there are no recorded eruptions, legends of the local Aymara people imply that they may have witnessed one eruption. Renewed activity at Parinacota is possible in the future, although the relatively low population density in the region would limit potential damage. Some towns and a regional highway between Bolivia and Chile are potentially exposed to the effects of a new eruption.

== Name ==

The name &quot;Parinacota&quot; is Aymara. &quot;Parina&quot; means flamingo and &quot;quta&quot; lake. Parinacota and its neighbour Pomerape are also known as the Nevados de Payachata, &quot;twins&quot;. This refers to the fact that the volcanoes resemble each other.

== Geomorphology and geology ==

Parinacota lies in the Altiplano, a high plateau in the Central Andes. The border between Bolivia and Chile bisects the volcano and runs along the rim of the crater, which lies in Bolivia. In Chile, where most of the edifice is located, Parinacota lies in the commune of Putre, Arica y Parinacota Region, and in Bolivia in the Oruro Department of the Sajama Province. The towns of Ajata and Parinacota lie southwest and west of the volcano, respectively. The region lies at high altitude and access is difficult, hampering research on the volcanoes of the Central Andes.

=== Regional ===

The Nazca Plate and Antarctic Plate subduct beneath the South America Plate in the Peru-Chile Trench at a pace of and , respectively, resulting in volcanic activity in the Andes. Present-day volcanism occurs within four discrete belts: The Northern Volcanic Zone (NVZ), the Central Volcanic Zone (CVZ), the Southern Volcanic Zone (SVZ) and the Austral Volcanic Zone (AVZ). These extend between 2°N-5°S, 16°S-28°S, 33°S-46°S and 49°S-55°S, respectively. Between them they contain about 60 active volcanoes and 118 volcanoes which appear to have been active during the Holocene, not including potentially active very large silicic volcanic systems or very small monogenetic ones. These belts of active volcanism occur where the Nazca Plate subducts beneath the South America Plate at a steep angle, while in the volcanically inactive gaps between them the subduction is much shallower; thus there is no asthenosphere between the slab of the subducting plate and the overriding plate in the gaps.

Parinacota is part of the CVZ, which contains about 44 active volcanoes. Most volcanoes of the CVZ are relatively poorly researched and many exceed of elevation. Some of these edifices were active during historical time; these include El Misti, Lascar, San Pedro and Ubinas; the largest historical eruption of the CVZ occurred in 1600 at Huaynaputina. Other volcanoes in the CVZ that have been the subject of research are Galan and Purico complex. The CVZ has a characteristically thick crust () and the volcanic rocks have peculiar oxygen and strontium isotope ratios in comparison to the SVZ and NVZ. Parinacota lies in a segment of the CVZ where the Peru-Chile Trench undergoes a 45° curvature, and where the direction of subduction changes from diagonal to perpendicular. The crust is especially thick there, the reasons for this are not agreed upon yet and may vary between the western and eastern sides of the CVZ.

Subduction-related volcanism in the region has been ongoing since 200 million years ago, burying most of the Precambrian basement. Various units of sedimentary and volcanic origin form most of the outcropping basement in the region. A dramatic increment of volcanic activity occurred approximately 27 million years ago, when the Farallon Plate broke apart and subduction increased substantially. On the Chilean side, the basement is formed by the Oligocene-Miocene Lupica formation, the Miocene Ajoya volcanics, the Lauca formation and the Lauca Ignimbrite. On the Bolivian side the oldest volcanites are the Oligocene Kollukollu formation 34 million years ago and the 23 million years old Rondal Lavas. Miocene volcanic activity generated the Berenguela, Carangas and Mauri formations, followed by the Perez formation during the Pliocene and Pleistocene. These formations were all affected by terrain uplift and folding, probably linked to changes in the subduction regime. Volcanism continued into the late Pleistocene and Holocene (Condoriri 650,000±70,000 and Pomerape between 300,000-100,000 years ago), and was accompanied by glacial activity during the Pleistocene. During this whole time period, volcanic activity progressively migrated westward; presently, it is located on the Bolivia-Chile border.

=== Local ===

Parinacota is a highly symmetric volcanic cone, having the classical &quot;regular cone&quot; shape of a stratovolcano. The volcano is or high and features both blocky lava flows and scoria flows. Lava flows are fresh with levees, lobes and flow ridges, and reach lengths of on the slopes of the cone. The lava flows are between thick and can spread to widths of at the foot of the volcano. Pyroclastic flows are also found, reaching lengths of and are usually poorly consolidated, containing breadcrust bombs and breccia.

The volcano is capped by a wide and deep summit crater, which has a pristine appearance. Other data imply a width of and a depth of . The crater is the source of pumice flows, which have well conserved surface features such as levees and lobes especially down on the eastern slope. These pumice flows extend as far as away from the crater. An ashfall deposit spreads east from Parinacota to a distance of in Bolivia. Ash and lapilli deposits have been found at the shores of Lake Chungará as well.

The cone sits atop a thick multilobed andesitic platform known as the &quot;Chungará Andesites&quot; which crop out on the north shore of Lake Chungará in the form of a shelf. Overlying this shelf is a system of lava domes, which reach thicknesses of . The lava domes are accompanied by block and ash flow deposits that reach lengths of . A steep descent leads to Lake Chungará.South of the main edifice lie the parasitic vents known as the Ajata cones, which formed along a fissure that emanates from the main cone and is aligned with the regional Condoriri-Parinacota lineament. The dimensions of the cones reach width and height. The High Ajata flow emanates from a single cone and spreads southwest as a lobated lava flow. The middle Ajata flow is much smaller and is sourced to three different cones below the source of the High Ajata, each cone having its own small flow field. The upper and lower Ajata flows are only slightly smaller than the High Ajata flow and form superposed lava flows lower on the edifice. These lava flows are gray-black aa lava flows, commonly up to thick; the longest of these flows reaches a length of .

Older are the large dacitic lava flows known as the &quot;Border Dacites&quot; on the southeastern side of Parinacota, which are over horizontal distance. A similar but smaller lava flow lies west of the Border Dacites, entirely within Chile. These three lava flows have a total volume of about . Overall, Parinacota rises from a surface of ; the resulting edifice has a volume of 

On the northern side Parinacota partly overlaps with Pomerape, which in turn overlies the rocks of Condoriri farther north; together the volcanoes form a north-northeast trending volcano chain. Parinacota, Pomerape, and volcanoes farther south like Quisiquisini, Guallatiri and Poquentica constitute the eastern margin of the Lauca basin. This is a relatively gentle plain drained by the Rio Lauca. A chain of dormant or extinct volcanoes farther west like Taapaca forms the western margin of the basin and separates the Altiplano from the steep dropoff to the Atacama west of the Lauca basin.

==== Glaciers ====

The old cone was subject to glaciation, and traces of glacial erosion are preserved on its lava flows. A system of moraines can be seen at an elevation of on the southeastern foot of the volcano, where they partly cross the shores of Lake Chungará. Six such high moraines have been identified there, they were formed during the regional last glacial maximum (which did not coincide with the global last glacial maximum) although a pre-last glacial maximum origin has been proposed. Other, unspecified glacial deposits have also been observed in this area.

Presently, a or large ice cap covers the upper parts of the volcano and drops down to an elevation of about . There is also a large glacier on its southern flank. Some reports disagree with calling any part of Parinacota&#x27;s ice cap a &quot;glacier&quot;, however. Between 1987 and 2016, ice area at Parinacota and Pomerape declined by 1.94% every year. A retreat of was noted between 2002 and 2003, and most of the ice lies on the western slope of the mountain.

==== Sector collapse ====

Parinacota shows evidence of a major sector collapse (a giant landslide), whose deposit was originally interpreted to be a lava flow. The collapse removed a volume of about from the cone, plunged over vertical distance and flowed west, covering a surface area of or with debris; the volume is not very well established. 

As the volcano grew, it put more and more load on relatively weak sedimentary material that the volcano had developed on, deforming it, until these sedimentary rocks gave way. The western slope might have been weakened by glacial action, further facilitating the onset of the collapse. The collapse was probably sequential from the lower part of the edifice to the summit, and it formed an avalanche of rocks that flowed down the volcano. This flow was probably laminar and extremely fast ( ), judging from the morphologies of the avalanche deposit, and it incorporated substantial pre-collapse sediments from the Lauca basin. As the avalanche descended the slopes of the volcano, it picked up enough speed to run up on some topographical obstacles. Such collapses have occurred on other volcanoes in the CVZ such as Llullaillaco, Ollagüe, Socompa and Tata Sabaya; the most recent event occurred between 1787 and 1802 at Tutupaca in Peru and was much smaller than the Parinacota sector collapse.

The collapse event resembled the one that occurred on Mount St. Helens during the latter&#x27;s eruption in 1980, although the Parinacota collapse was three times larger. A separate, minor sector collapse occurred on a lava dome on the southwestern foot of the volcano at an unknown time. Such sector collapses are a common phenomenon on volcanoes. 

The avalanche eventually came to rest in a large &quot;L&quot; with the long side extending along the axis of the collapse and the short side closer to the edifice pointing north where its advance was limited by tomography, formed an exceptionally well preserved debris avalanche deposit. This deposit has a &quot;hummocky&quot; appearance typical for sector collapse deposits; individual hummocks can reach sizes of and heights of , with the size decreasing away from the volcano. The formation of these hummocks was probably influenced by the pre-existing structure of the edifice; much of the original stratigraphy of the pre-collapse edifice was preserved within the final collapse deposit. As the avalanche came to rest, compressional ridges formed with axes perpendicular to the movement of the avalanche. A few large Toreva blocks lie in the avalanche deposit just at the foot of Parinacota, they reach heights of and volumes of . Large blocks with sizes of up to are part of the deposit, and some of these blocks preserve details of the pre-collapse structure; the blocks reach sizes of even at large distances from Parinacota. These large blocks dominate the avalanche deposit; fine material is not present in the Parinacota collapse deposit, an unusual feature among debris avalanches. Some blocks slid away from the main avalanche deposit. The avalanche deposit displays a noticeable split into two units; the upper one is andesitic and originated from the actual cone, the lower one is derived from the lava domes beneath the present-day edifice.

This collapse gave birth to Lake Chungará when the avalanche flowed across a westbound drainage between Choquelimpie and Parinacota, forming a high volcanic dam that retained about of water. The formation of lakes during sector collapses has been observed at other volcanoes, including the 1988 Mount St. Helens collapse. Prior to the collapse, alluvial and riverine deposits occupied the area. In 2015 it was proposed that a much smaller lake occupied part of the Lake Chungará basin before the collapse.

Within the hummock-like topography of the deposit, a number of other lakes and peat filled basins are found, formed by water percolating through the avalanche deposit. These lakes are known as the Lagunas Cotacotani lakes, and are an important bird refuge. At least some of these lakes may be kettle holes, formed when blocks of ice transported within the avalanche melted. With increasing distance from the main cone the size of the lakes decreases. Some of these lakes are connected with each other and others are isolated, and during periods of low lake stands some of the lakes can become disconnected from each other. Springs at the foot of Parinacota form the Rio Benedicto Morales which flows through some of the lakes and ends in the main Lake Cotacotani. Otherwise, these lakes receive water from Lake Chungará through seepage. The lakes ultimately form the headwaters of the Rio Lauca, whose course previously extended across the area covered by the avalanche. The river has not carved an outlet all the way to Lake Chungará, probably because the relatively coarse avalanche deposit allows large amounts of water to seep through without carving a new river channel. The rate at which waters seep through the avalanche deposit has been estimated at ; it has progressively decreased over time, probably as a consequence of increased siltation within the avalanche deposit. Thus the depth and surface area of Lake Chungará have increased since the formation of the lake, and so has evaporation, which currently removes almost 5/6 of the total inflow.

A pumice fall deposit of dacitic composition is associated with the sector collapse event, which together with lava bombs suggest that an eruption took place at the time of the collapse; this has been contested however. The sector collapse was probably not caused by an eruption, although the intrusion of a cryptodome may have helped. There is no evidence on the edifice for the existence of a collapse scar, indicating that post-collapse volcanic activity has completely filled up the space removed by the collapse. The volcanic edifice has reached a volume similar to its volume before the failure.

==== Surroundings ====

The terrain around Parinacota is mostly formed by Neogene volcanic rocks. These are for the most part over one million years old and include individual volcanic centres such as Caldera Ajoya, Caldera Lauca, Choquelimpie, Condoriri, Guane Guane, Larancagua and Quisiquisini, and the Miocene Lauca ignimbrite (2.7 ± 0.1 million years ago) that forms the basement. The activity of many of these centres occurred over 6.6 million years ago. At slightly larger distances lie the volcanoes Guallatiri, Nevados de Quimsachata and Taapaca. Proterozoic and paleozoic basement rocks crop out as charnockite/granulite east and as amphibolite/gneiss west of the volcano, respectively. Other formations include the volcaniclastic Lupica Formation of Oligocene-Miocene age and the lacustrine Lauca formation.

A number of volcanoes have been active around Parinacota in the last one million years. Pomerape northeast of Parinacota is similar to Parinacota but the greater degrees of erosional decay suggest it is older than Parinacota; a subsidiary vent dated 205,000 years ago is found on its eastern slope. Pomerape is a comparatively simple volcanic cone whose foot is covered by glacial debris. One age obtained on the cone is 106,000 ± 7,000 years ago. The Caquena and Chucullo rhyolitic to andesitic lava domes are found northwest and southwest of Parinacota, respectively; they are associated with the oldest stages of activity at Parinacota.

==== Periglacial and erosional landforms ====

Periglacial landscapes are frequent in the area; they include rounded landforms, smooth surfaces, solifluction terrain and striated terrain. This extensiveness is the result of the relatively dry climate in the region, which limits the development of glaciers. On Parinacota, landforms of this type are found starting from elevation and become dominant above until the glacier line. The extent of their development is a function of the age of the underlying rocks as well; Holocene volcanic rocks have little periglacial alteration while older rock formations at times are heavily altered. Lahars also occurred during the history of Parinacota; thick layers of lahar deposits are found on the southern and eastern slopes and form a fan on the northwestern slope of Parinacota. At this fan, lahar deposits reach distances of away from the volcano.

Erosion has formed gullies on the upper sector of Parinacota. Otherwise, the volcanic rocks of Parinacota are well preserved owing to the arid climate and the youth of the volcano.

=== Petrology ===

Volcanic rocks erupted by Parinacota range in composition from basaltic andesite to rhyolite. Andesites from the old cone are classified as hornblende and pyroxene andesites. Minerals found within the rocks include amphibole, apatite, biotite, clinopyroxene, iron oxide and titanium oxide, feldspar, olivine, orthopyroxene, pyroxene, sanidine and zircon. Not all of these minerals are found in rocks from all stages of Parinacota. Some of these minerals, such as quartz and sanidine, were at least in part formed by the inclusion of foreign rocks into the magma. Gabbro and granite are found as xenoliths.

Overall, volcanic rocks at Parinacota belong to a potassium-rich calc-alkaline suite. The volcanites have characteristically high contents of barium and strontium, especially in the youngest Ajata rocks where their concentration is higher than in any other CVZ volcanic rock. A trend to a more tholeiitic composition in younger eruptions may reflect an increased magma flux and a decreased interaction with the upper crust.

The magmas that formed Parinacota and Pomerape are considered to be a group distinct from these that formed older volcanic centres in the region, but also distinct from the magmas that formed the subsidiary vent of Pomerape and the Ajata cones; these tend to be more mafic. In turn, the younger and older Ajata cone lavas have different compositions, one having a high quantity of strontium and the other a low one.

Magmas in the Parinacota region formed through distinct processes. One of these is fractional crystallization within closed magma chambers. Another is the mixing of different magmas, one of which in the case of Parinacota may be the Ajata magmas. More specifically, two different magmas with compositions akin to the Ajata magmas contributed the mafic element to the Parinacota magmas. Some differences in magma composition between various volcanoes and stages may reflect the occurrence of several different magma differentiation events.

Processes within magma chambers play an important role in the formation of the magmas erupted by volcanoes. The diversity of the petrographic patterns suggest that Parinacota did not have a single major magma chamber, but rather various magma reservoirs at various depths and with variable interconnection patterns. Some Ajata magmas bypassed the shallow reservoirs completely. Starting about 28,000 years ago however several different magma systems consolidated into one, probably as a result of more frequent injections of new magma and/or the accumulation of cumulates that insulated the magmatic system. The transit of the magmas through the conduit system probably takes several ten thousand years, and the residence time within magma chambers could be on the order of 100,000 years.

In the case of Parinacota, there is a noticeable difference between the pre-sector collapse and post-sector collapse magmas, indicating that a large turnover of the magmatic system was triggered by the landslide. More specifically, after the collapse erupted rocks became more mafic and their composition more influenced by fractional crystallization, while the preceding magmas were more strongly affected by mixing processes. Also, magma output increased significantly, while the resting time in the magma chambers decreased. Modelling indicates that over the short term, a collapse would cause activity to stop at a volcano of Parinacota&#x27;s size, and over the long term the plumbing system would change and become shallower. Also, the plumbing system of the volcano would become more permissive to denser mafic magmas after a sector collapse, perhaps explaining why the Ajata vents were active after the collapse but the magma erupted through them influenced petrogenesis of main cone magmas much earlier. The magnitude of such changes is considerably larger than at neighbouring volcano Taapaca, where a sector collapse was not accompanied by changes in activity; presumably Parinacota&#x27;s shallower magma supply system made it more susceptible to the effects of unloading.

The source of the Parinacota magmas is ultimately the mantle wedge above the slab of the Nazca Plate. Fluids released from the slab flux the wedge and trigger the formation of melts, with the assistance of asthenospheric material that is hotter and gets transported into the wedge. These ascending magmas then interact with the crust, resulting in extensive changes to their composition. The area in the crust where such interaction takes place is known as &quot;MASH&quot; or &quot;Melting Assimilation Storage Homogenization&quot;, and it is there that the base magmas are formed which then enter into shallow magmatic systems. Further, the relative thickness of the crust and narrowness of the mantle wedge mean that garnet is stable within the wedge, causing the magmas to be influenced by garnet-linked petrogenic processes. Shallower crustal components such as the locally extensive Lauca-Perez ignimbrite may have been assimilated by Parinacota as well. These crustal components contributed about 12% of the primitive magmas as erupted by the Ajata cones, while the mantle wedge contributed 83%. Fluids from the slab and sediments subducted in the Peru-Chile Trench added the remaining 3 and 2%.

== Climate ==

Average temperatures at Parinacota are about , with the isotherm hovering between elevation. On neighbouring Sajama, on the summit temperatures range . The atmosphere becomes thinner and drier at higher altitudes, allowing both increased solar radiation to reach the surface during daytime and more thermal radiation from the ground to escape to the top of the atmosphere during night. This pattern determines a large diurnal temperature amplitude in the region, with variations on the scale of .

Average precipitation at Parinacota is about . Between about 12 and 26° degrees southern latitude, most of the moisture that arrives was absorbed by winds over the Amazon and transported to the Andes. Thus, humidity increases from west to east, with the Pacific coastline being particularly dry. Parinacota lies within the &quot;puna seca&quot; climate region, where precipitation occurs over 7 or 8 months of wet season and results in a total amount of , most of it falling during the summer months when the Altiplano warms up under the sun, generating a monsoon-like wind current. The summer precipitation is also known as the &quot;Bolivian winter&quot; or &quot;Altiplanic winter&quot;. This is an unusual precipitation pattern for Chile; most of the country has a mediterranean climate where most precipitation occurs during the winter months. 

The arid climate is a consequence of the activity of the South Pacific High just off the coast, the rain shadow effect of the Andes and the cold Humboldt Current in the Pacific Ocean. The dry climate became apparent in the region 10–15 million years ago. The generally arid climate of the region means that volcanoes can remain topographically recognizable for a long time, being subject to only minimal erosion. Likewise, the groundwater pools in the region tend to be fairly old, going back to 13,000–12,000 years ago. The climate was not always so dry in the past; around 28,000 years ago and between 13,000 and 8,200 years ago a wet period was accompanied by advances of glaciers. The middle Holocene was dry, after 4,000 years before present climate became wetter again. Because of the aridity, relatively little sediment is flushed into the Peru-Chile Trench from land, which has effects on the tectonics of the region and the chemistry of the magmas erupted in the volcanoes.

Winds at Parinacota come generally from the west, except during the wet season when easterly winds are common. This wind pattern is controlled by the formation of a high-pressure area and a shift of the subtropical jet stream to the south.

== Flora and fauna ==

The Andes are a long mountain chain with different climates at various latitudes and elevations. Thus, vegetation differs from one location to the other. In the region of Parinacota, between altitude the vegetation is formed by shrub steppe such as &quot;Baccharis incarum&quot;, &quot;Baccharis tola&quot;, &quot;Fabiana densa&quot;; the dominant species are &quot;Deyuexia breviaristata&quot;, &quot;Festuca orthophylla&quot;, &quot;Parastrephia lucida&quot; and &quot;Parastrphia quadrangularis&quot;. During the wet season, this vegetation is augmented by herbaceous plants. Above a grass vegetation dominates, which on rocky ground occasionally gives way to cushion vegetation such as &quot;Azorella compacta&quot;, whose yellow colour is characteristic and can be seen from large distances. This type of xeric vegetation is also known as &quot;puna&quot;. Herbs and shrubs reach elevations of . &quot;Polylepis tarapacana&quot; is the only true tree found at high elevations (up to ) and forms small woods. Close to water, the &quot;bofedal&quot; marsh-like vegetation prevails, with &quot;Oxychloe andina&quot; being the dominant species. Some genera and species are endemic to the puna; they include &quot;Chilotrichiops&quot;, &quot;Lampaya&quot;, &quot;Parastrephia&quot; and &quot;Oreocerus&quot;.

Among the ecological factors that determine vegetation in the region are lack of water, saline soils, plentiful solar irradiation, herbivores, wind and cold nighttime temperatures. These plant species which release airborne pollen can often be identified in samples taken from Parinacota&#x27;s icecap, where winds deposit the pollen grains.Animal species that live around Parinacota include flamingo, guanaco, huemul, rhea, vicuña and viscacha. Among predatory animals feature the Andean cat, the pampas cat and the puma. The most abundant animal species however are rodents, some of which can be found up to the highest treelines and which include the viscacha and the burrowing tuco-tuco. Also important are birds, such as the rhea, the tinamous, flamingos and various predatory and wetland birds, including the Andean condor.

Many mammal species in the area were decimated in the past, although some have displayed a recent recovery in numbers. Parinacota and surroundings in 1965 were made part of the Lauca National Park, which was further modified in 1970 and 1983 and is an UNESCO biosphere reserve. This natural preserve features a unique flora and fauna for Chile. However, potential future water diversions from Lake Chungará, the hunting of indigenous animals, overharvesting of the vegetation, overgrazing and the existence of a major border-crossing highway close to Lake Chungará constitute ongoing threats to the environment around Parinacota.

Lake Chungará adds to the local flora and fauna. These include charophytes, diatoms and aquatic macrophyte plants. Animal taxa found in the lake include bivalves, gastropods and ostracods. About 19 species of &quot;Orestias&quot; fish are found in the lake, some of which are endemic. The speciation of &quot;Orestias chungarensis&quot;, &quot;Orestias laucaensis&quot; and &quot;Orestias piacotensis&quot; was aided by the volcanic activity of Parinacota and its collapse, which separated the watersheds inhabited by their ancestor species and caused allopatric speciation.

== Eruptive history ==

Parinacota underwent five separate stages of volcanic activity. A relatively young age of the last eruption is presumed considering the good preservation of volcanic landforms, such as lava flows and the summit crater; SERNAGEOMIN considers it the most active volcano of the Central Andes by magma output. The high magma output may be facilitated by the presence of faults that facilitate the rising of magma; the Condoriri lineament in the area could be the fault that channels magma to Parinacota. The injection of mafic magmas into magma chambers and the mixing between magmas of different composition has been held responsible for the onset of eruptions at many volcanoes including Parinacota.

=== Chungará Andesites and lava domes ===

The oldest volcanic structure of Parinacota are the &quot;Chungará Andesites&quot; and the overlying lava dome, which form the platform that crops out on the southern side of the Parinacota volcano, facing Lake Chungará. Erosion and glacial action has smoothed the surfaces of these rocks, leaving no primary textures.

This platform was erupted between 300,000 and 100,000 years ago. The finer subdivision defines the &quot;Chungará Andesites&quot; as having erupted 163,000–117,000 years ago and the &quot;Rhyolite domes&quot; being 52,000–42,000 years old. Other dates obtained on these stages are 110,000 ± 4,000 and 264,000 ± 30,000 years ago for the Chungará Andesites and over 112,000 ± 5,000 for the &quot;rhyolite domes&quot;. These two units are also called &quot;Parinacota 1&quot;. A hiatus of over 60,000 years occurred between the eruption of the &quot;Chungará Andesites&quot; and the formation of the lava dome plateau. Traces of explosive activity during the lava dome stage have been found.

The &quot;Chungará Andesites&quot; have a volume of over ; material from these stages was incorporated in the collapse deposit. Pomerape volcano developed during this time as well. This and the long delay between the eruption of the Chungará Andesites and the rest of the volcano&#x27;s history may imply that the magmatic systems involved were different. Magma output during the early stage was low, with a magma output of with the dome growth contributing .

=== Old Cone and sector collapse ===

At the same time as the lava domes were emplaced, the Old Cone started growing a short distance northwest of the domes. The temporal gap between this stage of Parinacota&#x27;s activity and the previous one may be because the deposits from this time interval are only poorly preserved. The Old Cone developed over 85,000 years until the sector collapse, and is also known as Parinacota 2. Outcrops of this stage are found mostly low on the southeastern and north-northwestern slopes; individual dates obtained on rocks from this stage are 20,000 ± 4,000, 46,700 ± 1,600, and 53,000 ± 11,000 years ago. The &quot;Border Dacites&quot; also belong to this stage, being dated at 28,000 ± 1,000 years ago. Likewise, ash fall deposits found in the Cotacotani lakes have been dated to this period of volcanic history, indicating that the Old Cone occasionally featured explosive eruptions. This stage erupted andesite and dacite in the form of three distinct suites. Magma output during this time was about . This also was a time of glacier growth and development in the region, and consequently a glacier cap developed on the Old Cone during this time. By the time of the sector collapse, the glaciers were already retreating.

The date of the collapse is not known with certainty, because dates have been obtained on various materials with different stratigraphic interpretations. 18,000 years ago was considered the most likely estimate, but ages as young as 8,000 years ago were also proposed. Radiocarbon dates from peat within the collapse deposit indicated an age of 13,500 years ago, or 11,500–13,500 years ago. Many dates were obtained on material predating the collapse that was embedded within the collapse deposit, and thus the most likely time for the collapse was considered to be 8,000 years ago. Later research indicated an age between 13,000 and 20,000 years ago, the most recent proposal is 8,800 ± 500 years before present.

The postulated period coincides with a global clustering of volcano collapse events; perhaps global warming occurring during this time when the last glacial maximum approached its end predisposed volcanoes to collapse. On the other hand, the younger dates of around 8,000 years ago significantly post-date the end of glaciation, thus if the collapse occurred at that time it was probably unrelated to glacial fluctuations. This collapse and the collapse of Socompa farther south may have affected humans in the region.

=== Young cone and Ajata ===

After the collapse, the cone was relatively rapidly rebuilt during the Young Cone stage reaching a total volume of approximately . The units erupted during this time are also known as the &quot;healing flows&quot; or Parinacota 3. During this stage, volcanic activity was focused on the summit crater. This stage was relatively short and accompanied by an increase in the magma output of Parinacota to depending on how the duration of this stage is measured. The higher magma flux is comparable to peak output by other large stratovolcanoes. The maximum possible magma flux at Parinacota during this period is about .

Apart from lava flows, sub-Plinian eruptions generated pumice and scoria flows, with some individual explosive eruptions dated to 4,800 ± 800, 4,300 ± 2,600 and 3,600 ± 1,100 years ago. Based on the patterns of tephra deposition in Lake Chungará, it is inferred that the rate of explosive activity increased after the early Holocene until recent times; in addition, tephra falls contributed calcium to the lake waters and impacted its biological productivity. It has been proposed that dust particles found in ice cores at Nevado Sajama may actually be tephra from Parinacota.

Various Holocene dates have been obtained from rocks on the southern flank of the Young Cone; the youngest date for this stage was obtained by argon-argon dating: 500 ± 300 years ago. Further, an age of less than 200 BP has been determined by radiocarbon dating for a pyroclastic flow.

Other recent activity, originally considered to be the youngest, formed the Ajata cones. These cones are constructed by basaltic andesite with a volume of about . The Ajata cones form four groups of different ages: The lower Ajata flows were erupted 5,985 ± 640 and 6,560 ± 1,220 years ago, the upper Ajata flows 4,800 ± 4,000 years ago, the middle Ajata flows 9,900 ± 2,100 years ago, and the High Ajata flows 2,000 – 1,300 years ago. These groups also form compositionally distinct units. The youngest surface exposure date obtained is 1,385 ± 350 years ago.

According to SERNAGEOMIN, Aymara legends referencing volcanic activity imply a latest eruption date of 1800 AD. One history narrating of a bearded man, son of the Sun, that was mistreated by a local town head with the exception of a woman and her son. They were warned that a great disaster would happen, and as they fled from the town it was destroyed by fire. Details of the story imply that the story might reference a small explosive eruption that sent a pyroclastic flow into Lake Chungará after the time of the Spanish conquest; the theory that it references the sector collapse conversely appears to be unlikely.

== Present-day activity and hazards ==

Presently, Parinacota is dormant, but future volcanic activity is possible. Explicit fumarolic activity has not been observed, but satellite imaging has shown the evidence of thermal anomalies on the scale of , and reports of sulfurous smells at the summit imply that a fumarole may exist in the summit area. The volcano is seismically active including one potential seismic swarm, but earthquake activity is less than at Guallatiri farther south. Based on Landsat Thematic Mapper images, it was considered a potentially active volcano in 1991.

The volcano is one among ten volcanoes in northern Chile monitored by SERNAGEOMIN and has a volcano hazard level published. The relatively low population density on the Bolivian side of the volcano means that renewed activity would not constitute a major threat there, although the town of Sajama may be affected. The Arica-La Paz highway runs close to the volcano and might be threatened by mud and debris flows, along with small communities in the area. Communities close to the volcano include Caquena, Chucullo and Parinacota. Potential hazards from future activity include the development of lahars from interactions between magma and the ice cap, pyroclastic flows especially on the southern flank, and eruptions from the flank vents; ash fall from prolonged flank vent eruptions could disturb pastures in the region. The important natural preserve that is the Lauca National Park could suffer significant disruption from renewed eruptions of Parinacota.

== Human history and cultural value ==

The region around Parinacota has been inhabited for about 7,000–10,000 years. Politically, since 1,000 years ago first Tiwanaku and then the Inka ruled over the region. In contrast with many other local mountains, no archeological findings are reported from the summit of Parinacota.

Several legends concern Parinacota and its sister mountain Pomerape, which are often portrayed as unmarried sisters. Some involve a dispute with or between the mountains Tacora and Sajama, often resulting in Tacora being driven off. Parinacota is one among several volcanoes that figure on the Chilean passport.

<text>KX Television, sometimes branded as KX Net or simply KX, is a group of four television stations in western North Dakota owned by the Nexstar Media Group and affiliated with CBS and The CW Plus.

==Stations==
The network consists of four stations:
The group was formed in 1958 when John Boler, owner of KBMB-TV in Bismarck (founded in 1955), sold a half-interest in his station to Minot businessman Chester Reiten. Boler and Reiten then teamed up to buy North Dakota&#x27;s oldest station, KCJB-TV in Minot (founded in 1953), and changed its call letters to KXMC-TV. The two stations formed a mini-network, with KXMC as the flagship station even though KBMB was the larger station. A year later, KBMB changed its calls to KXMB.

KXMD in Williston signed on in 1969. Two years later, Boler sold his stake in the stations to Reiten. 

The network was partially completed in 1970, when KDIX-TV in Dickinson began switching to and from KXMB&#x27;s signal whenever CBS programming aired, as KDIX-TV could not afford a network feed. This arrangement continued after KDIX-TV was sold to new owners and changed its call letters to KNDX. When KNDX was on the verge of closure in late 1984, Reiten bought the station, changed its calls to KXMA, and merged it fully into the KX network. 

The stations carried a secondary affiliation with ABC until KBMY signed on in 1985.

Chester Reiten retired in the 1990s and turned over his interest in the stations to his five children: Steve Reiten, David Reiten, Kathleen Reiten Hruby, Tim Reiten, and Melanie Reiten Shonkwiler. Master control and internal operations were moved to Bismarck sometime in the 2000s. David Reiten served as KXMC&#x27;s general manager. Tim Reiten served as company president and KXMB&#x27;s general manager. 

KXMB and KXMC are the two full-fledged stations in the group. KXMB covers the southern portion of the market while KXMC covers the northern portion. For many years, KXMA placed local inserts into KXMB&#x27;s newscasts, while KXMD placed inserts into KXMC&#x27;s newscasts. However, recent cutbacks have resulted in all operations being merged in Bismarck and Minot, with KXMA and KXMD being reduced to local bureaus, and as a result, local inserts have been eliminated. However, all four stations continue to air separate identifications and commercials. Starting in 2009, KXMA and KXMD began simulcasting KBMY on their digital subcarriers as part of a sales agreement with KBMY&#x27;s owner, Forum Communications. 

Nexstar Broadcasting Group announced that it would merge with Reiten Television in a $44 million deal on September 17, 2015–a handsome return on Chester Reiten&#x27;s original investment in KXMB-TV 57 years earlier. The sale was completed on February 2, 2016. As result of the acquisition, Nexstar terminated KX Television&#x27;s agreements with KBMY.

Nexstar signed an affiliation deal with The CW on July 1, 2016, bringing the network to the KX stations. The CW Plus programming airs on the second digital channels of KXMB, KXMC, and KXMD. However, it airs on KXMA&#x27;s primary channel in an unusual arrangement, moving CBS to the second channel. This is likely to ensure satellite carriage for The CW Plus in the market, as most satellite providers do not usually carry secondary subchannel services.

For years, the stations used the slogan &quot;Your Eye on Dakota,&quot; an allusion to the CBS Eyemark logo. Around 2020, the branding changed to &quot;Putting North Dakota First.&quot;

===Former semi-satellites===
KXJB formerly provided limited simulcasts of KXMB&#x27;s programming from 1954 until 1971.

<text>Øyvind Leonhardsen (born 17 August 1970) is a Norwegian former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. He retired after the 2007 season, ending a career with nine years in English football at clubs Wimbledon, Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur, and Aston Villa, and in Norway he played for Molde, Rosenborg, Lyn, and Strømsgodset. Between 1990 and 2003 he made 86 appearances for the Norway national team scoring 19 goals.

==Club career==

===In Norway===
Leonhardsen started his career in Clausenengen before he, as a 19-year-old, moved to Premier Division side Molde in 1989. Two years later he was brought to Norwegian champions Rosenborg.

Leonhardsen won the honorable Kniksen award as the best midfielder in 1989, 1991, 1992 and 1993. He was voted the Player&#x27;s Player of the Year in Norway in 1994.

===In England===
Leonhardsen moved to Wimbledon in the Premier League the following season, where he made an instant impact on the left wing. He spent three seasons with Wimbledon, and helped them reach the semi-finals of both the FA Cup and Football League Cup in his final season there. He was sold to Liverpool for £3.5million in May 1997, and was initially a regular member of the first team under the management of Roy Evans.

After Gerard Houllier&#x27;s continental revolution of Liverpool from 1999, Leonhardsen fell out of favour at Anfield and was sold to Tottenham Hotspur, before joining Aston Villa on a free transfer in August 2002.

===Return to Norway===
Leonhardsen moved back to Norway in 2004 to join FC Lyn Oslo, where he became the captain. He signed a two-year contract with second-level club Strømsgodset IF from Drammen in December 2005.

Leonhardsen retired aged 37 after helping securing Strømsgodset&#x27;s promotion to Tippeligaen in 2006, and later retaining their place in the league in 2007.

Leonhardsen began working as a youth coach at his former club Lyn. In 2018 he became assistant coach of Mjøndalen IF.

==International career==
Leonhardsen made 86 appearances for the Norway national team, scoring 19 goals. He was part of the 1994 and 1998 FIFA World Cup squads.

In Norway, the expression &quot;a Leo run&quot; is derived from Leonhardsen&#x27;s running capacity and smart movements. He seemed to have an uncanny instinct for anticipating when and where a loose ball would present him with a scoring chance, directing and timing his runs to make sure he&#x27;d be there to exploit it - hence his impressive scoring rate for a midfielder. He is reckoned as somewhat of a cult hero and a symbol of the Norway national team success in the 1990s. He earned great respect during his career due to his highly professional approach to the game.

<doc id="1336744" wikidata="Q5347232" url="?curid=1336744" title="Effect of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake on Norway">
<text>The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was an undersea megathrust earthquake of moment magnitude 9.1–9.3 that struck the Indian Ocean off the western coast of northern Sumatra, Indonesia on 26 December 2004 at 00:58:50 UTC (07:58:50 local time in Jakarta and Bangkok).

==Norwegian citizens in the affected region==
* Formally identified dead: 84 (updated 18 May 2005)
* People who were in the affected areas at the time of the disaster: ca. 7,660

===Problems in reporting===
The first few days, the Norwegian Foreign office was in charge of collating names and information about people reported missing or with possible whereabouts in the environs of the hit areas. According to their information, 21 Norwegian citizens were confirmed to be killed during the calamity, and about 1,600 were either missing or of unknown whereabouts presumptively in the general South and East Asia regions.

On 30 December the national police took over the lists, which actually had partial information (duplicate or triplicate listings etc.) on more than 8,000 entry lines.

Through the work of the police, those listed as missing were whittled down to below 300. On 3 January the police published a list with names of 279 missing persons, and that there were 16 confirmed deaths instead of the originally reported 21 (no list published). The drop from 21 to 16 was explained by more stringent demands as to legal presumption of death.

It soon transpired that there had been a fair amount of miscommunication, reporting snags and computer errors, even typing errors. Many people who learned that they were on their lists, were able to call in and were removed. By the afternoon of 5 January, the names of missing persons had been lowered to 80. It was furthermore stated that the number of confirmed deaths had, again, been over-reported due to a typing error, dropping the number of confirmed dead from 16 to 12.

Apparently due to the stringency of presumed death declarations, a Norwegian Tamil woman who was killed in the waves in a part of Sri Lanka controlled by the Tamil Tigers, found after one day, identified by local friends and relatives and buried in Sri Lanka on 2 January, remained listed as &quot;missing&quot; on the official list. But on 6 January her name was removed, and the statistics of confirmed dead increased from 12 to 13.

On 18 January the Police published numbers of dead and missing according to an altered system. The number of deceased (eight) included only those whose formal identification had been confirmed by the pertinent civic authorities. The number of missing (then eighty) thus included some people whose bodies had been identified by relatives or friends, but not yet by the authorities.

==History==
Thailand has been a Norwegian tourist destination of great popularity for many years. In recent years, more and more Norwegians have also started to celebrate Christmas in the warmth of the south Asian weather, instead of celebrating at home, where the weather can be rough, with temperatures far below zero degrees Celsius as well as snow. In light of these facts, the impact of the catastrophe has a large psychological and personal impact on the small nation.

In Sri Lanka, there are reports of three Norwegians dead, one of them a Norwegian citizen born in the Tamil part of the country and doing volunteer work at an orphanage in her town of birth. The tradition of vacationing there is much more limited than Thailand. The Norwegian Embassy was in a state of emergency following the disaster.

==Impact==
This disaster exerted significant psychological impact everywhere in the world. Tourism is South-East Asia&#x27;s biggest export and it was disrupted considerably. However, it is making a comeback with more and more tourists visiting each year.

A memorial for the victims of the tsunami catastrophe of 26 December 2004 was initiated by the Norwegian government. The memorial is meant to be a dignified place for reflection and contemplation for all people affected by catastrophes. The sculpture by John Audun Hauges entitled &quot;Interferens&quot; is located on the western shore of Bygdøy in Oslo. It was officially unveiled by HM King Harald V of Norway on 19 October 2007.

<doc id="1336748" wikidata="Q19880738" url="?curid=1336748" title="KXMA-TV">
<text>KXMA-TV (channel 2) is a television station in Dickinson, North Dakota, United States, serving as an owned-and-operated station of The CW Plus and an affiliate of CBS. The station is owned by Nexstar Media Group, and maintains a news bureau and advertising sales office at the intersection of West Villard Street and State Avenue North in Dickinson; its transmitter is located southwest of the city. As Dickinson is located in the Mountain Time Zone, the station&#x27;s prime time schedule starts at 6 p.m. rather than the usual 7 p.m. start for the rest of Mountain Time, or in Central Time, where most of North Dakota is located.

KXMA&#x27;s second digital subchannel is considered a semi-satellite of KXMB-TV in Bismarck, which is the flagship station of the four-station [[KX Television]] regional network. KXMC-TV in Minot is the oldest station and former flagship of the KX group, while KXMB provides master control and some internal operations for the entire network. KXMA-DT2 airs a time-shifted simulcast of KXMB in Mountain Time for most of the day, clearing all network and syndicated programming as provided through its parent. However, KXMA-DT2 airs separate legal identifications and commercial inserts. The KX network relays CBS network programming and other programs across central and western North Dakota, as well as bordering counties in Montana and South Dakota. KXMA serves the southwestern portion of the Bismarck–Minot market. The four stations are counted as a single unit for ratings purposes. Unlike the other KX stations, KXMA airs The CW Plus on its main signal as a satellite of KXMB-DT2—hence its on-air branding, Dakota&#x27;s CW 2—and CBS programming (which aired on 2.1 until 2016) on DT2.

==History==

KXMA signed on in 1956 as KDIX-TV, and was owned by the Dickinson Radio and TV Corporation along with KDIX radio. Although the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) had combined all of western and central North Dakota into a single market in the mid-1950s, this wouldn&#x27;t be fully realized for another three decades, mainly because Dickinson is in the Mountain Time Zone. It carried programming from all three networks—CBS, NBC and ABC—but was a primary CBS affiliate.

The station was unable to get a direct network feed for its first three decades on the air. Until 1966, the station picked up what CBS programs it could under CBS&#x27; Extended Market Plan, which served as a go-between for non-interconnected stations in very small markets. It also aired a few ABC and NBC shows out of pattern.

Then, in 1966, KOTA-TV in Rapid City planned to sign on KHSD-TV (channel 11), a satellite station in Lead, South Dakota; to extend its coverage into northeastern Wyoming and southeastern Montana. At the time, KOTA-TV held a joint affiliation with CBS and ABC, but slightly favored CBS. Stanley Deck, KDIX&#x27;s general manager at the time, discovered that Dickinson was close enough to Lead that his engineers could easily get an acceptable signal from KHSD whenever CBS and ABC programming aired. He arranged with the Duhamel family, owners of KOTA, to provide network programming for KDIX-TV. In addition, Deck purchased virtually all the stock in the Dickinson Radio and TV Corporation. The deal took effect when KHSD opened on November 2, 1966; for the next several years, KDIX was practically a separately-owned satellite of KOTA. It continued airing NBC programming even after KFYR-TV opened a low-powered translator in Dickinson around 1967.

Then, in 1970, KOTA swapped affiliations with KRSD-TV (a precursor of the present KOTA-TV) and joined NBC. KDIX-TV still picked up ABC programming from KOTA, and was also able to pick up NBC as well. However, its engineers now had to switch to KXMB&#x27;s signal for CBS shows. A decade later, in 1980, KFYR-TV owner Meyer Television upgraded its Dickinson translator to a full-power station, KQCD-TV. Channel 2 then dropped all NBC programming and severed its remaining ties with KOTA-TV; afterward, KDIX-TV and the Reiten stations — KXMC-TV, KXMB-TV, and KXMD-TV — were jointly branded as the &quot;4X Network.&quot;

In 1983, Deck sold KDIX-TV to Big Horn Communications, which owned KOUS-TV (now KHMT) in Billings, and the calls were changed to KNDX. Big Horn paid so little attention to KNDX that the station&#x27;s signal quickly deteriorated to the point of unacceptability. With the station on the verge of closing down, the Reitens came to KNDX&#x27;s rescue, agreeing to buy the station in late 1984. The station adopted its current calls, KXMA-TV, when the deal closed on January 2, 1985. (It would have been KXME, but Prairie Public Television objected.) With wealthier ownership, KXMA was finally able to get a direct network feed from CBS. Since then, KXMA has been a semi-satellite of KXMB, airing a time-shifted feed of KXMB in Mountain Time. It continued to air a few ABC shows until 1986, when newly signed-on Bismarck ABC affiliate KBMY opened a translator in Dickinson.
In 2006, the stations began a web portal-like website called KX Net, with each station&#x27;s website displaying a localized front page. The stations continue to be branded as &quot;KX Television&quot; and as &quot;KX News&quot; on the air, but also began using the &quot;KX Net&quot; moniker on the air also. KXNet.com combined the previous domains kxma.com, kxmb.com, kxmc.com and kxmd.com under one umbrella. The original domains are still active. KXNet.com won the 2007 Teddy Award for Best Website and the 2007 Eric Sevareid Award for best website small market television in a six state region.

In July 2008, Reiten Television began a joint agreement to sell television commercial slots on both its existing stations and KBMY, Bismarck&#x27;s ABC affiliate owned by Forum Communications Company. A consequence of this agreement was that KBMY&#x27;s programming began to be simulcast in Dickinson on a full-power signal on KXMA&#x27;s second digital subchannel in 2009.

In October 2007, KXNet.com along with Midkota Solutions launched DakotaPolitics.com, a web site focusing on North Dakota political news coverage. DakotaPolitics featured profile information, voting records and some analysis. DakotaPolitics also launched weekly tracking polls for the 2008 elections. In 2008, KXNet.com became the first web site in North Dakota to deliver a live news broadcast over the Internet when they streamed a 1-hour special coverage of the 2008 Presidential Caucuses from Bismarck.

Nexstar Broadcasting Group announced its $44 million purchase of the Reiten Television stations, including KXMA-TV, on September 17, 2015. Sale was completed on February 2, 2016. As result of the acquisition, Nexstar decided to terminate the Joint Sales Agreement with KBMY.

==Programming==
The KX network carries the &quot;CBS Overnight News&quot; (though with public service announcements instead of local commercials), while weekends simulcast the local weather conditions of North Dakota. All four stations provide a formal sign-off, including &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, at 1:05 a.m. CT/12:05 a.m. MT Tuesday through Saturday mornings and at 1:35 a.m. CT/12:35 a.m. MT on Sunday and Monday mornings.

The North Dakota State Fair parade in Minot is aired live across the KX network every July as well as a July 4th Parade in Mandan.

===News operation===

KXMB produces local newscasts on weekdays at noon, 6 and 10 p.m. Weekend newscasts are produced at 6 and 10 p.m. on Saturdays, and 10 p.m. on Sundays. KXMC produces a morning show at 5 a.m. and co-produces a 5 p.m. newscast with KXMB, broadcast on all four stations. All of the local newscasts are broadcast in high definition.

For many years, KXMA placed inserts into KXMB&#x27;s newscasts. However, recent cutbacks have resulted in KXMA&#x27;s operations being largely merged with those of KXMB, and local inserts have been eliminated.

As a whole, KX Television has long trailed NBC North Dakota in the ratings by a significant margin; the main stations and their satellites are counted as one station for ratings and regulatory purposes. However, &quot;KX News Morning&quot; has recently surged well ahead of NBC North Dakota&#x27;s &quot;Country Morning Today&quot;—the only time in recent memory that NBC North Dakota has lost consecutive ratings periods in any time slot.

On November 30, 2013, actor Will Ferrell, as a promotion for his film &quot;Anchorman 2&quot;, co-anchored the KX network&#x27;s evening news as his character Ron Burgundy.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
Starting in 2016, KXMA moved CBS programming to its second digital subchannel, with The CW Plus on its primary channel. This is likely to ensure satellite carriage for The CW in the market.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KXMA-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 2, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 19, using virtual channel 2.

<text>KXMB-TV (channel 12) is a television station in Bismarck, North Dakota, United States, serving as an affiliate of CBS and an owned-and-operated station of The CW Plus. The station is owned by Nexstar Media Group, and maintains studios on North 15th Street in Bismarck; its transmitter is located near St. Anthony, North Dakota.

KXMB-TV serves as the flagship station of [[KX Television]], a regional network of four stations relaying CBS network and other programming provided by KXMB across central and western North Dakota, as well as bordering counties in Montana and South Dakota. The three satellite stations clear all network and syndicated programming as provided through KXMB but air separate legal identifications and commercial inserts. KXMC-TV (channel 13) in Minot also produces local weather and sports inserts, KXMD-TV (channel 11) in Williston simulcasts KXMC&#x27;s programming, and KXMA-DT2 in Dickinson (channel 2.2) simulcasts KXMB&#x27;s programming. The four stations are counted as a single unit for ratings purposes.

KXMC is the oldest station of the KX group, and was the flagship station originating programming until master control and internal operations were moved to KXMB in the 2000s. Dish Network only provides KXMC, while DirecTV only provides KXMB, as central and western North Dakota&#x27;s CBS affiliate.

==History==

KXMB first went on the air on November 19, 1955, as KBMB-TV, owned by Fargo businessman John Boler and his North Dakota Broadcasting Company. The station had a primary affiliation with CBS, but carried other networks as well. During the late 1950s, the station was briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network. In 1958, it moved to its current location.

In 1961, Boler sold a part-interest in the North Dakota Broadcasting Company to Chester Reiten of Minot. The two men teamed up to buy that city&#x27;s CBS station, KCJB-TV, and changed the calls to KXMC-TV. The two stations merged their operations, with KXMC as the flagship station. That same year, KBMB changed its calls to the current KXMB. They would put KXMD-TV in Williston on in 1969.
KXJB-TV in Fargo was co-owned with the KX stations (though programmed separately) until Boler sold his interest in the partnership to Reiten in 1971. Reiten retained the western North Dakota stations. The KX stations formerly had a secondary affiliation with ABC shared with KFYR-TV before full-time ABC affiliate KBMY signed on.

Reiten Broadcasting purchased KNDX (previously KDIX-TV) in Dickinson in 1985 and converted it into a full-time semi-satellite of KXMB and changed the call letters to KXMA (It would have been KXME, but Prairie Public Television objected.) Before being sister stations, KNDX/KDIX would often pick up CBS programming from KXMB since 1970, when KHSD-TV (KOTA-TV Rapid City, South Dakota satellite) dropped CBS programming.

After an ice storm on April 6, 1997, caused the KXJB-TV mast to collapse, some cable systems replaced KXJB with KXMB, either temporarily or permanently, to maintain CBS service.
In 2006, the stations began a web portal-like website called KX Net, with each station&#x27;s website displaying a localized front page. The stations continue to be branded as &quot;KX Television&quot; and as &quot;KX News&quot; on the air, but also use the &quot;KX Net&quot; moniker on the air also. KXNet.com combined the previous domains kxma.com, kxmb.com, kxmc.com and kxmd.com under one umbrella. The original domains are still active. KXNet.com won the 2007 Teddy Award for Best Website and the 2007 Eric Sevareid Award for best website small market television in a six state region.

In July 2008, Reiten Television began a joint agreement to sell television commercial slots on both KXMB and KBMY, Bismarck&#x27;s ABC affiliate owned by Forum Communications Company. KXMB houses sales and engineering personnel solely for KBMY&#x27;s operations. A consequence of this agreement has enabled KBMY-DT to begin broadcasting in July 2008 directly from KXMB&#x27;s station, bringing a digital ABC television signal to Bismarck.

In October 2007, KXNet.com along with Midkota Solutions launched DakotaPolitics.com, a web site focusing on North Dakota political news coverage. DakotaPolitics featured profile information, voting records and some analysis. DakotaPolitics also launched weekly tracking polls for the 2008 elections. In 2008, KXNet.com became the first web site in North Dakota to deliver a live news broadcast over the Internet when they streamed a 1-hour special coverage of the 2008 Presidential Caucuses from Bismarck.

Nexstar Broadcasting Group announced its $44 million purchase of the Reiten Television stations, including KXMB-TV, on September 17, 2015. The deal gave the Reitens a handsome return on Chester Reiten&#x27;s investment of 57 years earlier. The sale was completed on February 2, 2016. As a result of the acquisition, Nexstar decided to terminate the Joint Sales Agreement with KBMY.

==Programming==
The KX network carries the &quot;CBS Overnight News&quot; (though with public service announcements instead of local commercials), while weekends simulcast the local weather conditions of North Dakota. All four stations provide a formal sign-off, including &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, at 1:05 a.m. CT/12:05 a.m. MT Tuesday through Saturday mornings and at 1:35 a.m. CT/12:35 a.m. MT on Sunday and Monday mornings.

The North Dakota State Fair parade in Minot is aired live across the KX network every July as well as a July 4th Parade in Mandan.

===News operation===
KXMB produces daily local newscasts at 6 a.m., noon, 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. on weekdays, 6 and 10 p.m. on Saturdays, and 10 p.m. on Sundays. KXMC long aired separate newscasts in these timeslots as well. However, since the Nexstar purchase, its separate newscasts have been replaced with weather and sports inserts during the 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. weekday newscasts. KXMC co-produces a morning show, &quot;Good Day Dakota&quot; (formerly &quot;KX News Morning&quot;) and a 5 p.m. newscast with KXMB, broadcast on all four stations. All of the local newscasts are broadcast in high definition.

For many years, KXMA placed inserts into KXMB&#x27;s newscasts. However, recent cutbacks have resulted in KXMA&#x27;s operations being largely merged with those of KXMB, and local inserts have been eliminated.

As a whole, KX Television has long trailed NBC North Dakota in the ratings by a significant margin; the main stations and their satellites are counted as one station for ratings and regulatory purposes. However, &quot;Good Day Dakota&quot; has recently surged well ahead of NBC North Dakota&#x27;s &quot;Country Morning Today&quot;—the only time in recent memory that NBC North Dakota has lost consecutive ratings periods in any time slot.

On November 30, 2013, actor Will Ferrell, as a promotion for his film &quot;Anchorman 2&quot;, co-anchored the station&#x27;s evening news as his character Ron Burgundy.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KXMB-TV was the first commercial digital television station in North Dakota as when it went on the air in 2002. The station shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 12, at 10 a.m. on May 28, 2009. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 23 to VHF channel 12 for post-transition operations.

===Satellite stations===
To reach viewers throughout the vast Minot/Bismarck/Dickinson/Williston television market, KXMB extends its over-the-air coverage area through a network of three full-power stations encompassing much of the western and central two-thirds of North Dakota and parts of eastern Montana and northwestern South Dakota, branded as KX Television.

These stations mostly rebroadcast KXMB, although they rebroadcast KXMC before the 2000s. However, their full-power licenses allow them to broadcast separate station identifications and local commercial inserts, as well as different programming if desired. KXMC maintains a separate studio facility, which houses its Minot newsroom and sales office, and produces separate local newscasts that air nightly on KXMC and simulcast on KXMD. KXMA simulcasts KXMB&#x27;s newscasts.

<text>KXMC-TV (channel 13) is a television station in Minot, North Dakota, United States, serving as an affiliate of CBS and an owned-and-operated station of The CW Plus. Owned by Nexstar Media Group, the station has studios at the intersection of 2nd Street SE and 18th Avenue SE in Minot, and its transmitter is located near South Prairie.

KXMC-TV is the oldest station and served as the flagship of the [[KX Television]] regional network until the 2000s, when master control and internal operations were moved to the studios of KXMB-TV (channel 12) on North 15th Street in Bismarck. While being one of two full-fledged stations of the KX network, KXMC is actually considered a semi-satellite of KXMB. It clears all network and syndicated programming as provided through its parent but airs separate local newscasts, local identifications, and commercial inserts. KXMD-TV (channel 11) in Williston simulcasts KXMC while KXMA-DT2 (channel 2.2) in Dickinson simulcasts KXMB. The four stations are counted as a single unit for ratings purposes. Dish Network only provides KXMC, while DirecTV only provides KXMB, as central and western North Dakota&#x27;s CBS affiliate.

The over-the-air signal of KXMC reaches portions of the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba.

==History==
KXMC was the first television station in North Dakota, going on the air as KCJB-TV in April 1953. Minot businessman Chester Reiten and Fargo businessman John Boler, owners of KBMB-TV in Bismarck (now KXMB), bought the station in 1958 and changed KCJB&#x27;s call letters to the current KXMC-TV.

Boler sold his interest in the KX stations to Reiten in 1971. Reiten retired in the 1990s and turned over his interest to his five children: Steve Reiten, Dave Reiten, Kathleen Reiten Hruby, Tim Reiten, and Melanie Reiten Shonkwiler. Tim served as company president.

The KX stations formerly had a secondary affiliation with ABC before full-time ABC affiliate KMCY signed on in 1986. During the late 1950s, the stations were also briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network.

Until 1986, KXMD was carried by cable systems across neighboring Saskatchewan, even operating a sales office in Saskatoon, as did KUMV and Great Falls ABC station KFBB-TV. These arrangements ended in 1986 when the Canadian cable companies were granted permission to replace the North Dakota signals with network affiliates from Detroit and Toledo, Ohio.

KXJB-TV in Fargo was co-owned with the KX stations (though programmed separately) until Boler sold his interest in 1971. The stations still occasionally share stories. After an ice storm on April 6, 1997, caused the KXJB-TV mast to collapse, some cable systems replaced KXJB with KXMC, either temporarily or permanently, to maintain CBS service.

In 2006, the stations began a web portal-like website called KX Net, with each station&#x27;s website displaying a localized front page. The stations continue to be branded as &quot;KX Television&quot; and as &quot;KX News&quot; on the air, but also use the &quot;KX Net&quot; moniker on the air also. KXNet.com combined the previous domains kxma.com, kxmb.com, kxmc.com and kxmd.com under one umbrella. The original domains are still active. KXNet.com won the 2007 Teddy Award for Best Website and the 2007 Eric Severaid Award for best website small market television in a 6 state region.

In October 2007, KXNet.com along with Midkota Solutions launched DakotaPolitics.com, a web site focusing on North Dakota political news coverage. DakotaPolitics featured profile information, voting records and some analysis. DakotaPolitics also launched weekly tracking polls for the 2008 elections. In 2008 KXNet.com became the first web site in North Dakota to deliver a live news broadcast over the Internet when they streamed a 1-hour special coverage of the 2008 Presidential Caucuses from Bismarck.

In July 2008, Reiten Television began a joint agreement to sell television commercial slots on both KXMC and KMCY, Minot&#x27;s ABC affiliate owned by Forum Communications Company. KXMC houses sales and engineering personnel solely for KMCY&#x27;s operations.

On June 23, 2011, then anchorman/reporter Shaun Sipma received a phone call from Minot native Josh Duhamel who was in Moscow, Russia at the time to pledge his support when his hometown got flooded during KXMC&#x27;s 24-hour flood coverage.

Nexstar Broadcasting Group announced its $44 million purchase of the Reiten Television stations, including KXMC-TV, on September 17, 2015. Sale was completed on February 2, 2016. As result of the acquisition, Nexstar terminated the Joint Sales Agreement with KMCY.

==Programming==
The KX network carries the &quot;CBS Overnight News&quot; (though with public service announcements instead of local commercials), while weekends simulcast the local weather conditions of North Dakota. All four stations provide a formal sign-off, including &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, at 1:05 a.m. CT/12:05 a.m. MT Tuesday through Saturday mornings and at 1:35 a.m. CT/12:35 a.m. MT on Sunday and Monday mornings.

The North Dakota State Fair parade in Minot is aired live across the KX network every July as well as a July 4th Parade in Mandan.

===News operation===

For many years, KXMC and KXMB produced separate daily local newscasts at noon, 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. on weekdays, 6 and 10 p.m. on Saturdays, and 10 p.m. on Sundays. However, after Nexstar bought the KX stations, KXMC&#x27;s noon and weeknight newscasts, as well as all weekend newscasts, were dropped. It now places sports and weather inserts into KXMB&#x27;s newscasts in those timeslots.

KXMC co-produces two newscasts with KXMB—a morning show at 6 a.m., &quot;Good Day Dakota&quot; (formerly &quot;KX News Morning&quot;) and a 5 p.m. newscast. Both are simulcast on all four stations.

KXMD simulcasts KXMC, while KXMA simulcasts KXMB. All of the local newscasts are broadcast in high definition.

For many years, KXMD placed inserts into KXMC&#x27;s newscasts. However, recent cutbacks have resulted in KXMD&#x27;s operations being largely merged with those of KXMC, and local inserts have been eliminated.

As a whole, KX Television has long trailed NBC North Dakota in the ratings by a significant margin; the main stations and their satellites are counted as one station for ratings and regulatory purposes. However, KXMC has historically been well ahead of KMOT in the ratings for the northern part of the market. This was largely because it was the only station airing a full schedule of local news for the northern part of the market. Also, &quot;Good Day Dakota&quot; has recently surged well ahead of NBC North Dakota&#x27;s &quot;Country Morning Today&quot;—the only time in recent memory that NBC North Dakota has lost consecutive ratings periods in any time slot.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KXMC-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 13, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 45 to VHF channel 13 for post-transition operations.

<text>KXMD-TV (channel 11) is a television station in Williston, North Dakota, United States, serving as an affiliate of CBS and an owned-and-operated station of The CW Plus. Owned by Nexstar Media Group, the station maintains a news bureau and advertising sales office at the intersection of 13th Avenue West and 18th Street West (near US 2/85) in Williston, and its transmitter is located west of the city near the North Dakota–Montana border.

KXMD is part of the [[KX Television]] regional network of CBS affiliates in central and western North Dakota, originating from flagship station KXMB-TV (channel 12) in Bismarck. The KX network relays CBS network and other programming across central and western North Dakota, as well as bordering counties in Montana and South Dakota. Master control and some internal operations of KXMD are based at KXMB&#x27;s facilities on North 15th Street in Bismarck. The four stations are counted as a single unit for ratings purposes.

KXMD operates as a semi-satellite of KXMC-TV (channel 13) in Minot. KXMC is itself a semi-satellite of KXMB-TV in Bismarck, which also has semi-satellite KXMA-DT2 (channel 2.2) in Dickinson. KXMD identifies itself as a station in its own right, but clears all network and syndicated programming as provided through KXMC. However, KXMD airs separate local commercial inserts and legal identifications. The Montana viewing portion of KXMD&#x27;s coverage area is within the Mountain Time Zone, and the station&#x27;s prime time schedule starts at 6 p.m. rather than the usual 7 p.m. for the time zone.

The over-the-air signal of KXMD reaches portions of the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. Most of the Montana portion of KXMD&#x27;s viewing area also receives CBS from KXGN-TV in Glendive via a network of translators and cable television.

==History==
KXMD signed on October 25, 1969, as a semi-satellite of KXMC-TV in Minot. Previously, Williston viewers had to pick up CBS programming on cable from KOOK-TV in Billings, Montana (now KTVQ), although KUMV-TV had not been above breaking away from the KFYR/KMOT feed when CBS had something very important to present.

Boler sold his interest in the KX stations to Reiten in 1971. Steve Reiten, Dave Reiten, Kathleen Reiten Hruby, Tim Reiten, and Melanie Reiten Shonkwiler, Chester&#x27;s children, still own the stations today (including KXMA-TV in Dickinson, which he bought in 1985).

The KX stations previously had a secondary affiliation with ABC before full-time ABC affiliate KMCY signed on in 1986. During the late 1950s, the stations were also briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network.

Until 1986, KXMD was carried by cable systems across neighboring Saskatchewan, even operating a sales office in Saskatoon, as did KUMV and Great Falls ABC station KFBB-TV. These arrangements ended in 1986 when the Canadian cable companies were granted permission to replace the North Dakota signals with network affiliates from Detroit and Toledo, Ohio.

In 2006, the stations began a web portal-like website called KX Net, with each station&#x27;s website displaying a localized front page. The stations continue to be branded as &quot;KX Television&quot; and as &quot;KX News&quot; on the air, but also use the &quot;KX Net&quot; moniker on the air also. KXNet.com combined the previous domains kxma.com, kxmb.com, kxmc.com and kxmd.com under one umbrella. The original domains are still active. KXNet.com won the 2007 Teddy Award for Best Website and the 2007 Eric Severaid Award for best website small market television in a 6 state region.

In October 2007, KXNet.com along with Midkota Solutions launched DakotaPolitics.com, a web site focusing on North Dakota political news coverage. DakotaPolitics featured profile information, voting records and some analysis. DakotaPolitics also launched weekly tracking polls for the 2008 elections. In 2008 KXNet.com became the first web site in North Dakota to deliver a live news broadcast over the Internet when they streamed a 1-hour special coverage of the 2008 Presidential Caucuses from Bismarck.

In July 2008, Reiten Television began a joint agreement to sell television commercial slots on both its existing stations and KMCY, Minot&#x27;s ABC affiliate owned by Forum Communications Company. KMCY became available in Williston on a full-power signal on KXMD&#x27;s second digital subchannel in 2009.

Nexstar Broadcasting Group announced its $44 million purchase of the Reiten Television stations, including KXMD-TV, on September 17, 2015. Sale was completed on February 2, 2016. As result of the acquisition, Nexstar decided to terminate the Joint Sales Agreement with KMCY.

==Programming==
The KX network carries the &quot;CBS Overnight News&quot; (though with public service announcements instead of local commercials), while weekends simulcast the local weather conditions of North Dakota. All four stations provide a formal sign-off, including &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, at 1:05 a.m. CT/12:05 a.m. MT Tuesday through Saturday mornings and at 1:35 a.m. CT/12:35 a.m. MT on Sunday and Monday mornings.

The North Dakota State Fair parade in Minot is aired live across the KX network every July as well as a July 4th Parade in Mandan.

===News operation===

KXMC produces local newscasts daily at 6 a.m., noon, 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. KXMC produces a morning show at 6 a.m., &quot;KX News Morning,&quot; and co-produces a 5 p.m. newscast with KXMB. Both are simulcast on all four stations. All of the local newscasts are broadcast in high definition.

For many years, KXMD placed inserts into KXMC&#x27;s newscasts. However, recent cutbacks have resulted in KXMD&#x27;s operations being largely merged with those of KXMC, and local inserts have been eliminated.

As a whole, KX Television has long trailed NBC North Dakota in the ratings by a significant margin; the main stations and their satellites are counted as one station for ratings and regulatory purposes. However, KXMC has historically been well ahead of KMOT in the ratings for the northern part of the market. This is largely because it is the only station airing a full schedule of local news for the northern part of the market. Also, &quot;KX News Morning&quot; has recently surged well ahead of NBC North Dakota&#x27;s &quot;Country Morning Today&quot;—the first time in recent memory that NBC North Dakota has lost consecutive ratings periods in any time slot.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KXMD-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 11, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 14, using virtual channel 11.

<doc id="1336766" wikidata="Q7592175" url="?curid=1336766" title="St. Xavier's College, Kolkata">
<text>St. Xavier&#x27;s College is a private, Catholic, autonomous college in Kolkata, India. It is run by the Calcutta Province of the Society of Jesus. It was founded by the Jesuits in 1860 and named after St. Francis Xavier, a Jesuit saint of the 16th century, who travelled to India. In 2006, it became the first autonomous college in West Bengal, India. The college is affiliated to the University of Calcutta. St. Xavier&#x27;s was ranked 6th among colleges in India by the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) in 2024.

== History ==
The college was founded in 1860 by the Jesuits, an all-male Catholic religious order formed by Saint Ignatius of Loyola. The college is named after Francis Xavier, the 16th century Spanish Jesuit saint. The founder of the college was Father Henri Depelchin, SJ. He oversaw most of the ground work, during the foundation years. The college&#x27;s coat of arms has remained the same, since it was undertaken in 1905.

===Sans Souci theatre===
Before 1843, the Sans Souci theatre was located at 30 Park Street (now Mother Teresa Sarani, Kolkata-700016). In that year a fire broke out, leaving nothing but ashes. The site was later bought by seven Jesuits, who had arrived from Belgium. It is here that the present day campus stands tall.

===Foundation years===
The present 30, Park Street address where the college is situated, is an amalgamation of numbers 10 and 11, Park Street. Premise number 11, was bought for Rs 45,000.00, by Fr. Depelchen. These funds were made possible with the generous donations of the Anglo-Indians and with help from the home Province of Belgium. Park Street is located in the heart of Kolkata and is a landmark street in the city, a melting pot of its diverse cultural, culinary, social and intellectual milieu.
The college&#x27;s very first class had only forty students. In 1862, two years after its inception, the college was affiliated to the Calcutta University.
However, there was a shortage of funds for expansion work in terms of class rooms and to accommodate the Jesuit fathers. So the Rector appealed to the public of Calcutta in newspapers for generous assistance and was responded to with magnanimity by well wishers of the city in 1864. Besides Fr Depelchin and his assistant, Br. Koppes the builder went around personally collecting funds. The present imposing five-storey building was built in an interval of six years, from 1934 to 1940, at a cost of Rs 9 lakhs, which was collected partly from the public of Calcutta, assistance from Belgium, and the huge rental received from the American army that occupied the building during the Second War. Expansion of the college has been a ceaseless effort, with a campus slated to come up in Salt Lake City, Kolkata and a second boys&#x27; hostel not far away from the existing one.

===Goethals Library===
The Goethals library, which is located above the College Chapel, houses some of the oldest periodicals, journals and books at the university. The treasures were inherited by the Jesuit Fathers in 1908, from the then Archbishop of Calcutta, Paul Goethals, S.J. Today, the treasures are well preserved and the library has become a spot of historical significance.

===Postal stamp===

A commemorative stamp was issued by the Indian Post on 12 April 1985 depicting the college campus. Thus recognizing the college&#x27;s contribution to society.

== Courses ==

<text>Jean-Étienne Guettard (22 September 1715 – 7 January 1786), was a French naturalist and mineralogist. He was born at Étampes, near Paris.

In boyhood, he gained a knowledge of plants from his grandfather, who was an apothecary, and later he qualified as a doctor in medicine. Pursuing the study of botany in various parts of France and other countries, he began to take notice of the relation between the distribution of plants and the soils and subsoils. In this way his attention came to be directed to minerals and rocks.

In 1746, he communicated to the Academy of Sciences in Paris a memoir on the distribution of minerals and rocks, and this was accompanied by a map on which he had recorded his observations. He thus, as remarked by W. D. Conybeare, &quot;first carried into execution the idea, proposed by Martin Lister years before, of geological maps.&quot; In the course of his journeys he made a large collection of fossils and figured many of them, but he had no clear ideas about the sequence of strata.

He made observations also on the degradation of mountains by rain, rivers and sea; and he was the first to ascertain the existence of former volcanoes in the district of Auvergne.

In 1759, Guettard was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

He died in Paris on 7 January 1786.

His publications include:
* &quot;Observations sur les plantes&quot; (2 vols, 1747)
* &quot;Histoire de la découverte faite en France de matières semblables à celles dont la porcelaine de la Chine est composée&quot; (1765)
* &quot;Mémoires sur différentes parties des sciences et arts&quot; (5 vols, 1768–1783)
* &quot;Mémoires sur la minéralogie du Dauphiné&quot; (2 vols, 1779).
* &quot;Atlas et description minéralogiques de la France&quot; (1780)
* &quot;Atlas minéralogique de la France, volume de planches&quot; (1780)

<text>Monster Rancher, known in Japan as , is a Japanese anime television series based on Tecmo&#x27;s &quot;Monster Rancher&quot; video game franchise. It originally aired on CBC in Japan for two seasons from April 1999 to September 2000. In North America, the series was first licensed by BKN, Inc. and broadcast with an English dub on the Bohbot Kids Network, the Sci-Fi Channel, the Fox Family Channel, and Fox Kids in the United States and YTV in Canada. It was later licensed by Discotek Media in 2013.

==Story==
The story follows a boy named Genki Sakura, who is a key player of the &quot;Monster Rancher&quot; video games. After winning a tournament hosted by the game&#x27;s creators, Genki wins a special CD that he can use to unlock a special monster in his game at home. However, upon using this disk in his game console, he finds himself transported to a world of monsters that, much like Genki&#x27;s game, are given life by scanning special stone disks within temples. There, he meets a girl named Holly and her monster friend Suezo, who are seeking a stone disk containing a legendary Phoenix that will save the land from the tyranny of an evil ruler named Moo. Upon attempting to use the disk Genki had won to try and release the monster, they bring forth a different monster, which Genki names Mocchi. Wanting to free the land from Moo&#x27;s rule, Genki, Holly, Mocchi, and Suezo set off to find the Phoenix, using Holly&#x27;s Magic Stone to guide them in the direction of the Phoenix. The Magic Stone leads them to Golem, Tiger, and Hare, each of which have their motivations to join the group on their journey to find the Phoenix.

It is revealed that Moo is actually Holly&#x27;s missing father, who merged with an evil spirit after being banished from his village. Determined to separate Moo&#x27;s evil spirit from Holly&#x27;s father, the group continues their search for the Phoenix, defeating Moo&#x27;s strongest minions, the Big Bad Four—Pixie, Gali, Grey Wolf, and Naga. In their travels, the gang befriends and aids many monsters as they continue searching, unlocking as many Mystery Disks as possible in the hopes of finding the Phoenix. One of these unlocked monsters, Monol, tells the group of a previous war between Moo and the Phoenix (as part of a larger war between humans and monsters, who exploited monsters as workers and companions in a futuristic society) that destroyed much of the world and weakened the two entities into their dormant states, separating their body and souls.

In the end of the first season, Moo&#x27;s body is found and merges with Holly&#x27;s father. Shortly after, the Phoenix&#x27;s body is found, and it is revealed that the five monsters—Mocchi, Suezo, Golem, Tiger, and Hare—are pieces of the Phoenix&#x27;s soul. Understanding what must be done, they say goodbye to Genki and merge with the Phoenix&#x27;s body, and begin to fight Moo. As the two beings fight, Moo realizes that good and evil are inherently inseparable, and that the two are doomed to repeat a perpetually repeating fight as representatives of the two forces. The two monsters seemingly die, and Genki is knocked back into the real world in the resulting explosion, comforted by visions of his friends as he goes home.

The second season consists of Genki returning to the Monster World to revive and reunite his friends, who were turned into disks and separated after the fight with Moo. The gang must compete in a series of tournaments against General Durahan&#x27;s army in their pursuit to find Holly&#x27;s father. The third season ends with Genki and the others battling the soul of Moo that has possessed Durahan; during the credits of the final episode it is revealed in the Japanese version that both Genki and Mocchi are able to travel between both the Monster Rancher world and Earth.

<text>National Semiconductor&#x27;s SC/MP (pronounced &quot;scamp&quot;) for Simple Cost-effective Micro Processor, is an early 8-bit microprocessor which became available in April 1976. It was designed to allow systems to be implemented with the minimum number of additional support chips. SC/MP included a daisy-chained control pin that allowed up to three SC/MP&#x27;s share a single main memory to produce a multiprocessor system, or to act as controllers in a system with another main central processing unit (CPU). Three versions were released over its lifetime, SCMP-1 through 3, the latter two also known as INS8060 and INS8070.

To lower cost, the system used a bit-serial arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and was thus significantly slower than contemporary designs like the Intel 8080 or MOS 6502 which had parallel ALUs. Another oddity was that the program counter could only access the lower 12-bits of the 16-bit address, and the upper 4-bits had to be set using special instructions. The result was that instructions accessed main memory as sixteen 4 kB &quot;pages&quot; and reaching memory outside those pages required multiple instructions.

The combination of slow speed and paged memory limited its attractiveness outside the embedded markets it was aimed at, and in this market it competed against the Fairchild F8 which had a number of useful additional features. The system saw relatively little use.

==Design==
===ALU and main registers===
The arithmetic logic unit (ALU) was accumulator-based, with a single 8-bit accumulator, AC. A second 8-bit register, &quot;Extension&quot;, or E, could be used as a backup for AC. E could not be accessed directly by most instructions; one could not load data from memory directly into E for instance. Instead, the value in AC could be read from E, or AC and E could be swapped. E can also be used as the source value for the seven logical/arithmetic operations supported by the ALU. If E were not used for other operations, it could also used in a fashion similar to the mirror registers seen in designs like the Zilog Z80, with E acting as a quick way to store the value of AC during an interrupt.

A major purpose of E was to act as a buffer for the built-in serial I/O system. This was driven by the SIO instruction, which bit shifted the least significant bit in E to a latch which was connected to the SOUT pin on the processor. Repeated calls to SIO thus presented bits of the 8-bit E value one at a time to the output, or reversed this operation for reading from the SIN pin. Once a complete 8-bit value had been read or written, the value could be sent to memory by exchanging the value with A and then loading or storing A to memory. E could also be used as the source for logical operations on AC, so for instance, one could read a status byte in from the serial port and then AND that value with a mask in AC, to check for various status bits read from an external device.

The separate Status Register was 8-bits. The three least-significant-bits, 0 through 2, were connected directly to pins, providing an easy way to check external device&#x27;s status. A further two pins, Sense A and B, were connected to bits 4 and 5. Sense A was normally used to service interrupts (see details below). Interrupts could be turned off by setting bit 3, Interrupt Enable (IE) to 0 with the Disable Interrupt instruction, DINT, and enabled with IEN, or by moving the value to and from A and manipulating it there. Bits 6 and 7 were conventional overflow and carry flags, as seen in most processors.

===Addressing and index registers===
Like most 8-bit microprocessors of the era, the SC/MP is based around a 16-bit address and an 8-bit data bus. To lower pin count, the external address bus contains only 12 pins, sharing 4 pins from the data bus to create a complete 16-bit address. Internally, the program counter is twelve bits wide, and there are separate instructions to set the upper four bits by copying an 8-bit value into the high byte. This provides a memory map of sixteen four-kilobyte pages, and program code could not refer to code or immediate or PC-relative data outside its own page. Thus the memory is arranged as 16 pages of 4 kB each. This leads to a curiosity of the design; when the program counter reaches the end of a page, it does not move to the next page, it returns to the start of the current page.

This was further limited by the two-byte instruction format, which used one byte for the opcode and a second one to indicate an offset between -128 and +127, which was added to a value in the processor registers to produce a complete 16-bit address. For instance, an address might refer to a location in memory by saying it is +10 locations from the value in the program counter, or +10 from the value in one of the 16-bit index registers. To access a location outside that range, the address had to be stored in one of the index registers, and then the offset set to zero. Because the registers are 16-bit, and the accumulator that loads values is 8-bit, setting a complete address required several instructions.

As indexes were critical to the addressing model, the SC/MP included four index registers, the &quot;Pointer Registers&quot; PR0 through PR3. PR0 was the program counter, and not normally manipulated by user programs. By convention, PR1 was normally used as a pointer into ROM, PR2 into RAM, and PR3 was used to store an address during interrupts and subroutine calls. The SC/MP did not have a stack, where return values were normally stored on most contemporary designs. Programs had to save return addresses with explicit code.

There were four primary addressing modes, PC-relative, indexed, immediate (meaning a constant in the instruction&#x27;s second byte as opposed to an offset), and auto-indexed. PC-relative addressing was actually the same as indexed, selecting PR0 as the index register.

Auto-indexed is used to aid the construction of loops. If the displacement is less than zero, the contents of the Pointer Register is decreased by the displacement before the contents of the effective address are fetched or stored. If the displacement is equal to or greater than zero, the contents of the Pointer Register are used as the effective address, and the contents of the Pointer Register are increased by the displacement after the contents of the effective address are fetched or stored. This removes the need for a separate instruction to change the value in the register, so one could store the starting value of a block of data in memory in a PR and then loop through all of the data by calling a single instruction. If the offset is negative it performs the decrement before accessing the final value, if it is positive, it does a post-increment.

===Interrupt handling===
The system includes automatic handling of interrupts on the Sense A line. When an interrupt is received and IE is high (enabled), before starting to fetch the next instruction the system instead clears IE to prevent another interrupt, and then exchanges the values in PC and PS3. This has the effect of saving the return address in PR3 and sending the next instruction into the interrupt handler entry point previously stored in PR3.

The system does not include the equivalent of a return-from-interrupt. This can be performed with another XPPC, copying the previously-saved address in PR3 back to the PC and execution continues where it left off. However, this leaves the wrong address in PR3, not the start of the interrupt handler, but the end. To address this, the common solution is to place the XPPC that returns to the main code one instruction above the handler entry point, rather than at the end. When the handler completes, it jumps back to this instruction, so when XPPC is called, the PC is pointed one location before the proper entry point. Because the system increments the PC before calling an instruction, this means the next interrupt will result it in entering at the correct entry point. This &quot;exit handler&quot; normally also resets the IE to 1 to re-enable interrupts.

===Bus control===

A feature of the SC/MP was a shared daisy-chained control line that allowed multiple SC/MP, or more commonly a single SC/MP and related direct memory access (DMA) controllers, to share access to a single main memory. When any one of the chips on the bus desired access to memory, it would set the ENOUT pin high, thereby signalling the other chip&#x27;s ENIN pins that they had to release the bus. With most other processors, this would normally require external logic implemented by the board designers to pause the CPU to the same end, often with some complexity due to the internal instruction timing that was not visible to the external circuits. In the SC/MP this was all included internally so a single line on the circuit board was all that was needed to implement this feature.

The original idea was to ease the creation of microcontroller-like applications containing an SC/MP, one or more DMA controllers, and a single shared memory. Designed specifically to be as low-cost as possible in terms of an overall system, the desire to lower the cost of the SC/MP itself also led to decisions about the bit-serial ALU and the inclusion of serial input/output lines to eliminate the need for a separate UART (this feature was removed in the later SC/MP III). Osborne&#x27;s review of the system stated it was the &quot;microprocessor of choice in any multi-processor application&quot; but this market seems to have been limited as sales were never particularly strong.

===Unusual features===
The SC/MP did not include a jump-to-subroutine instruction. Instead, the assembler language included the JS macro that wrote a series of instructions to implement this functionality. The macro loaded the high byte of the address into AC, and then called XPAH to move it to the high byte of a selected pointer register. It then repeated this for the low byte using XPAL. It then called XPPC to transfer the resulting 16-bit value from the PR to the PC. Since XPPC exchanges the two values, the current value of the PC is thus stored into the selected PR, and the return-from-subroutine can be implemented with a single XPPC to copy the value back.

SC/MP increments the program counter &quot;before&quot; fetching the instruction, so that on reset it actually starts executing instructions from location 0001. This also needs to be taken into account for calculating displacements, since the offset will be added to the program counter which will be still pointing to the location of the displacement and not the next instruction.

The system included a Delay instruction, DLY, which took a single parameter, P. This stopped operation for a period of 13 + (2 x P) + (2^9 x P) + (2 x AC) microcycles, which it did by continually decrementing the value in AC until it reached zero. This meant it could produce a delay between 13 and 131,593 cycles. This was normally used with the serial pins; a program could set the value in AC to the time it took to transmit a single bit at a given speed and then check the value of one of the flag pins to see if it was ready for the next one.

The processor was not particularly picky about timing, and in low-speed applications it did not need to use a crystal oscillator and this could be replaced with a simple capacitor instead.

==Implementations==

ISP-8A/500 SC/MP-1 Clocked at 1 MHz, first implementation (P Channel MOS technology)

INS 8060 ISP-8A/600 SC/MP-2 Clocked at 4 MHz (internally 2 MHz) first N Channel MOS version (single +5V supply)

INS 807x SC/MP-3 Clocked at 4 MHz (internally 2 MHz) included variations with up to 4 KB ROM (optional onboard BASIC (NIBL))

==Uses==
The SC/MP was also used as the basis of a single board microcontroller produced by Science of Cambridge (later Sinclair Research Ltd) called the MK14.
Montgomery Elevator Co of Moline IL (later purchased by KONE, Inc) used the SC/MP as the basis for its first micro processor based elevator controller released in 1975. There are still many of these units running in buildings across the U.S.A.

<text>Eduard Heinrich Flottwell (23 July 1786 – 28 May 1865; after 1861 von Flottwell) was a Prussian &quot;Staatsminister&quot;. He served as &quot;Oberpräsident&quot; (governor) of the Grand Duchy of Posen (from 1830) and of the Saxony (from 1841), Westphalia (from 1846) and Brandenburg (from 1850) Provinces. He was also Prussian Minister of Finance (1844-1846) and Minister of Interior (1858-1859).

==Early life==
Flottwell was born in Insterburg in the Province of East Prussia (present-day Chernyakhovsk in Russian Kaliningrad Oblast), studied law at the University of Königsberg and entered the civil service at the Insterburg court in 1805. 

==Career==
From 1812 he was a member of the East Prussian &quot;Regierungspräsidium&quot; of Gumbinnen. After the Napoleonic Wars he together with &quot;Oberpräsident&quot; Theodor von Schön re-organised the administration of the West Prussian province at Danzig. In 1825 he was appointed &quot;Regierungspräsident&quot; of Marienwerder.

When in 1830 the Polish November Uprising led by Michał Gedeon Radziwiłł broke out at Warsaw in Russian Congress Poland, his brother Antoni Radziwiłł was dismissed as Duke-Governor of the Prussian Grand Duchy of Posen by King Frederick William III and the sole rule passed to Flottwell as the new &quot;Oberpräsident&quot;. He was a strong supporter of Germanisation and standardised schooling policies, which by some was seen as directed against ethnic Polish Prussians in the region. In 1843 in &quot;Anerkennung der Hilfe nach dem großen Hamburger Brand&quot; (acknowledgment of the assistance after the great Hamburg fire), he was named an honorary citizen of Hamburg.

<text>Acotango is the central and highest of a group of stratovolcanoes straddling the border of Bolivia and Chile. It is high. The group is known as Kimsa Chata and consists of three mountains: Acotango, Umurata () north of it and Capurata () south of it.

The group lies along a north–south alignment. The Acotango volcano is heavily eroded, but a lava flow on its northern flank is morphologically young, suggesting Acotango was active in the Holocene. Later research has suggested that lava flow may be of Pleistocene age. Argon-argon dating has yielded ages of 192,000±8,000 and 241,000±27,000 years on dacites from Acotango. Glacial activity has exposed parts of the inner volcano, which is hydrothermally altered. Glacial moraines lie at an altitude of but a present ice cap is only found past of altitude.

The volcano is a popular hiking route in the Sajama National Park and Lauca National Park. It is on the border of two provinces: Chilean province of Parinacota and Bolivian province of Sajama. Its slopes are within the administrative boundaries of two cities: Chilean commune of Putre and Bolivian commune of Turco.

To climb the summit from the Chilean side is dangerous due to land mines, however it is relatively safe to climb the summit from the Bolivian side. The southern ascent starts over a glacier and passes an abandoned copper mine.

== First Ascent and human presence ==
Acotango&#x27;s first modern ascent was by Sergio Kunstmann, Pedro Rosende and Claudio Meier (Chile) October 14, 1965. It is believed that Pedro Rosende, a Chilean explorer, found the remains of firewood at the summit of Acotango. Because of this, it is thought that the mountain might have been one of the high Incan Andean sanctuaries. However, more exploration is needed to verify this information.

<text>Princess Elizabeth of Clarence (Elizabeth Georgiana Adelaide; 10 December 1820 – 4 March 1821) was a member of the British royal family. She was the second daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Clarence and St Andrews, later King William IV and Queen Adelaide. Princess Elizabeth was a granddaughter of King George III.

Elizabeth was born on 10 December 1820 during the reign of her uncle George IV at St James&#x27;s Palace, and was christened that day at the Palace by William Howley, then Bishop of London.

After &quot;being suddenly seized with the fatal disease, an intro-susception of the bowels&quot; she died shortly thereafter, aged 12 weeks. She was buried at Windsor Castle, in St George&#x27;s Chapel, on 10 March 1821. She was third in line of succession to the British throne at the time of her death; had she lived another sixteen years, she would have become queen instead of her cousin Victoria.

<text>Edward Mandell House (July 26, 1858 – March 28, 1938) was an American diplomat, and an adviser to President Woodrow Wilson. He was known as Colonel House, although his title was honorary and he had performed no military service. He was a highly influential backroom politician in Texas before becoming a key supporter of the presidential bid of Wilson in 1912 by managing his campaign, beginning in July 1911. Having a self-effacing manner, he did not hold office but was an &quot;executive agent&quot;, Wilson&#x27;s chief adviser on European politics and diplomacy during World War I (1914–1918). He became a government official as one of the five American commissioners to the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. In 1919, Wilson broke with House and many other top advisers, believing they had deceived him at Paris.

==Early years==

He was born July 26, 1858, in Houston, Texas, the last of seven children of Mary Elizabeth (Shearn) and Thomas William House Sr. His father was an emigrant from England by way of New Orleans, who became a prominent Houston businessman, with a large role in developing the city and served a term as its mayor. His father sent ships laden with cotton to evade the Union blockade in the Gulf of Mexico during the American Civil War. He traded Texas cotton through Matamoros, Mexico, in exchange for equipment and ammunition.

As a young man, House and his companions harassed recently freed slaves verbally and with slingshots. His diary entries &quot;consistently reveal a deeply felt racism&quot; and a belief in white supremacy.

House attended Houston Academy, a school in Bath, England, a prep school in Virginia, and Hopkins Grammar School, New Haven, Connecticut.
He went on to study at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, in 1877 where he was a member of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity. He left at the beginning of his third year to care for his sick father, who died in 1880.

He married Loulie Hunter on August 4, 1881.

==Texas business and politics==

On his return to Texas, House ran his family&#x27;s business. He eventually sold the cotton plantations, and invested in banking. He was a founder of the Trinity and Brazos Valley Railway.

House helped to make four men governor of Texas: James S. Hogg (1892), Charles A. Culberson (1894), Joseph D. Sayers (1898), and S. W. T. Lanham (1902). After their elections, House acted as unofficial adviser to each. In 1893, Hogg appointed House to his military staff with the rank of lieutenant colonel, a position which came with a title but no actual military responsibilities. He was reappointed by Culberson, Sayers, and Lanham, and was soon known as &quot;Colonel House&quot;, the title which he used for the rest of his career.

House moved to New York City about 1902. A &quot;cosmopolitan progressive&quot; who examined political developments in Europe, House was an admirer of the British Liberal welfare reforms instigated between 1906 and 1914, noting to a friend in June 1911 that David Lloyd George

is working out the problems which are nearest my heart and that is the equalization of opportunity ... . The income tax, the employers&#x27; liability act, the old age pension measure, the budget of last year and this insurance bill puts England well to the fore. We have touched these problems in America but lightly as yet but the soil is fallow.

House&#x27;s friend David F. Houston shared his interests in England and the continent, concluding in August 1911 that “England and Germany are doing many interesting things in a desirable socialistic direction. We shall follow slowly because of the newness of conditions here and the lack of pressure.”
In 1912, House anonymously published a novel called &quot;Philip Dru: Administrator&quot;, in which the title character leads the democratic Western U.S. in a civil war against the plutocratic East, becoming the dictator of America and turns it into “Socialism as dreamed of by Karl Marx”. Dru as dictator imposes a series of reforms which resemble the Bull Moose platform of 1912 and then vanishes.

==Adviser to Wilson==

After House withdrew from Texas politics and moved to New York, he became an adviser, close friend and supporter of New Jersey governor Woodrow Wilson in 1911, and helped him win the Democratic presidential nomination in 1912. He became an intimate of Wilson and helped set up his administration.

House was offered the cabinet position of his choice (except for Secretary of State, which was already pledged to William Jennings Bryan) but declined, choosing instead &quot;to serve wherever and whenever possible&quot;. House was even provided living quarters within the White House.

He continued as an adviser to Wilson particularly in the area of foreign affairs. House functioned as Wilson&#x27;s chief negotiator in Europe during the negotiations for peace (1917–1919) and as chief deputy for Wilson at the Paris Peace Conference.

In the 1916 presidential election, House declined any public role but was Wilson&#x27;s top campaign adviser: &quot;he planned its structure; set its tone; guided its finance; chose speakers, tactics, and strategy; and, not least, handled the campaign&#x27;s greatest asset and greatest potential liability: its brilliant but temperamental candidate.&quot;

After Wilson&#x27;s first wife died in 1914, the President was even closer to House. However, Wilson&#x27;s second wife, Edith, disliked House, and his position weakened. It is believed that her personal animosity was significantly responsible for Wilson&#x27;s eventual decision to break with House.

==Diplomacy==

House threw himself into world affairs, promoting Wilson&#x27;s goal of brokering a peace to end World War I. He spent much of 1915 and 1916 in Europe, trying to negotiate peace through diplomacy. He was enthusiastic but lacked deep insight into European affairs and relied on the information received from British diplomats, especially the British foreign secretary Edward Grey, to shape his outlook. Nicholas Ferns argues that Grey&#x27;s ideas meshed with House&#x27;s. Grey&#x27;s diplomatic goal was to establish close Anglo-American relations; he deliberately built a close connection to further that aim. Thereby Grey re-enforced House&#x27;s pro-Allied proclivities so that Wilson&#x27;s chief adviser promoted the British position.

After a German U-boat sank the British passenger liner on May 7, 1915, with 128 Americans among the 1198 dead, many Americans called for war. Prior to departure from New York, the Imperial German Embassy had announced that ships sailing into warzone waters in order to aim for Germany&#x27;s enemies would be targeted as enemy supply. The ship was carrying war munitions, although this was not publicly revealed at the time. Wilson demanded that Germany respect American neutral rights, and especially not sink merchant ships or passenger liners without giving the passengers and crew the opportunity to get into lifeboats, as required by international law. Tension escalated with Germany, until Germany agreed to Wilson&#x27;s terms. House felt that the war was an epic battle between democracy and autocracy; he argued the United States ought to help Britain and France win a limited Allied victory. However, Wilson still insisted on neutrality.

House played a major role in shaping wartime diplomacy. He supported as well Thomas Garrigue Masaryk’s Czechoslovak legions, especially in Russia. Wilson had House assemble &quot;The Inquiry&quot;, a team of academic experts to devise efficient postwar solutions to all the world&#x27;s problems. In September 1918, Wilson gave House the responsibility for preparing a constitution for a League of Nations. In October 1918, when Germany petitioned for peace based on the Fourteen Points, Wilson charged House with working out details of an armistice with the Allies.

Diplomat and historian Philip Zelikow argues that House&#x27;s actions and advice to Wilson in the 1916-1917 period significantly extended World War I. At a time when both the Allies and Central Powers were anxious to begin peace talks, House often misread and misled Wilson, as well as his contacts in Britain and Germany, about each others&#x27; intentions and conditions for peace. This led Wilson to crucially delay offers to initiate a peace conference, and eventually fumble the diplomatic procedures necessary to make such an offer. While it is unclear if these mistakes were caused simply by House&#x27;s lack of diplomatic experience or were instead intentional misdirects intended to protect House&#x27;s own social standing, Zelikow argues that this failure of diplomacy was a primary reason for Wilson&#x27;s eventual break with House following the end of the war.

House&#x27;s perspective, as reflected in his personal papers, differs. House traveled in Europe to explore the possibility of peace as Wilson&#x27;s unofficial agent. House was dismayed by German militarism, which he believed the main cause of the war, but also by the hardened self-interest of each of the warring nations which included territorial aspirations, as well as Britain&#x27;s fear of Germany&#x27;s challenge to their military power, in particular naval primacy. The belligerents in the grip of war fever considered even discussing a peace conference a show of weakness; rejected automatically any proposal their enemy favored. Wilson&#x27;s hopeful call for a reasonable, practical &quot;peace without victory&quot; backfired; angered the French and English fighting for Germany&#x27;s utter and decisive defeat. Soldiers started calling dud shells &quot;Wilsons.&quot; The efforts to offer American mediation foundered not for lack of trying, but because the intransigent warring nations were not ready for peace—this, according to House&#x27;s contemporaneous correspondence. Then Germany&#x27;s decision to resume unrestrained submarine attacks against vessels of neutral nations, together with the Zimmermann telegram offering a German-Mexican alliance on the understanding Mexico would be assisted to reconquer New Mexico, Texas, and Arizona—precipitated Wilson&#x27;s decision to ask Congress to declare that a state of war existed between Germany and the United States. But both Wilson and House viewed entering the war to end it not just as a necessity of national interest, but as a Progressive project for a better future. Mankind would reject militarism after the horrors of this war; out of it would come a League of Nations to team against any single nation that waged aggressive war. It was to be (they thought) the War to End All Wars. 
==Paris conference==

House helped Wilson outline his Fourteen Points and worked with the president on the drafting of the Treaty of Versailles and the Covenant of the League of Nations. House served on the League of Nations Commission on Mandates with Lord Milner and Lord Robert Cecil of Great Britain, Henri Simon of France, Viscount Chinda of Japan, Guglielmo Marconi of Italy, and George Louis Beer as adviser. On May 30, 1919, House participated in a meeting in Paris which laid the groundwork for establishment of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), a private organization based in New York. Throughout 1919, House urged Wilson to work with Senator Henry Cabot Lodge to achieve ratification of the Versailles Treaty, but Wilson refused to deal with Lodge or any other senior Republican.
The conference revealed serious policy disagreements and personality conflicts between Wilson and House. Wilson became less tolerant and broke with his closest advisers, one after another. Later, he dismissed House&#x27;s son-in-law, Gordon Auchincloss, from the American peace commission when it became known the young man was making derogatory comments about him.

In February 1919, House took his place on the Council of Ten, where he negotiated compromises unacceptable to Wilson. The following month, Wilson returned to Paris. He decided that House had taken too many liberties in negotiations, and relegated him to the sidelines. After they returned to the US later that year, the two men never saw or spoke to each other again. Shortly after returning to Washington, Wilson suffered a debilitating stroke, the extent of which was concealed from the public and the press. Other than his doctors, direct access to the president was now limited to and controlled by Wilson&#x27;s wife and Chief of Staff. Though House continued to send memos and reports to the president during this time, Wilson&#x27;s wife made sure he did not see any of them.

==Later years==
In the 1920s, House strongly supported membership of both the League of Nations and the Permanent Court of International Justice.

In 1932, House supported Franklin D. Roosevelt for the presidency without joining his inner circle. Although he became disillusioned with the course of the New Deal after Roosevelt&#x27;s election, he expressed his reservations only privately. House was a confidant of William E. Dodd, Roosevelt&#x27;s first Ambassador to Nazi Germany, acting at times as Dodd&#x27;s intermediary with the White House and the State Department.

==Death and legacy==

House died on March 28, 1938, in Manhattan, New York City, following a bout of pleurisy. As a (one time) novelist, House had much more influence with the book &quot;Philip Dru: Administrator&quot; than has been appreciated. Historian Maxwell Bloomfield notes the impact of the character &quot;Dru&quot;, as written by Wilson&#x27;s Secretary of the Interior. In his diary, Franklin K. Lane wrote the following:

House was buried at Glenwood Cemetery in Houston. After his death, politicians, diplomats and statesman from around the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom expressed their admiration for House and regrets about his death, including President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Cordell Hull, Fiorello LaGuardia, Al Smith, Mackenzie King, David Lloyd George, Lord Tyrrell, and Lord Robert Cecil.

House Park, a high school football stadium in Austin, Texas, stands on House&#x27;s former horse pasture. The small farming community of Emhouse in north-central Navarro County, Texas, was renamed from Lyford in his honor, as he had served as the superintendent of the railroad company that operated in the community.

A statue of House, financed by Ignacy Jan Paderewski in 1932, is located at Skaryszewski Park in Warsaw. House is considered a hero in Poland for his advocacy of Polish independence after World War I, which was incorporated into the Fourteen Points and resulted in the reestablishment of the Polish nation.

The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor.

<text>William Daniel Conybeare FRS (7 June 178712 August 1857), dean of Llandaff, was an English geologist, palaeontologist and clergyman. He is probably best known for his ground-breaking work on fossils and excavation in the 1820s, including important papers for the Geological Society of London on ichthyosaur anatomy and the first published scientific description of a plesiosaur.

== Life and career==

===Childhood and education===
He was a grandson of John Conybeare, bishop of Bristol (1692–1755), a notable preacher and divine, and son of Dr William Conybeare, rector of St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate. Born in London, he was educated there at Westminster School, then went in 1805 to Christ Church, Oxford, where in 1808 he took his degree of BA, with a first in classics and second in mathematics, and proceeded to MA three years later.

===Early career===
Having entered holy orders he became in 1814 curate of Wardington, near Banbury, and he accepted also a lectureship at Brislington near Bristol. During this period he was one of the founders of the Bristol Philosophical Institution (1822). He was rector of Sully in Glamorganshire from 1823 to 1836, and vicar of Axminster from 1836 to 1844. He was appointed Bampton lecturer in 1839, called and later published in a book as &quot;An Analytical Examination into the Character, Value, and Just Application of the Writings of the Christian Fathers During the Ante Nicene Period&quot;. He was instituted to the deanery of Llandaff in 1845.

===Geology===
Attracted to the study of geology by the lectures of John Kidd he pursued the subject with ardour. As soon as he had left college he made extended journeys in Britain and on the continent, and he became one of the early members of The Geological Society. Both William Buckland and Adam Sedgwick acknowledged their indebtedness to him for instruction received when they first began to devote attention to geology.
He contributed geological memoirs to the &quot;Transactions&quot; of the Geological Society, the &quot;Annals of Philosophy&quot;, and the &quot;Philosophical Magazine&quot;. In 1821, in collaboration with Henry De la Beche he distinguished himself by describing, from fragmentary remains, the saurian Plesiosaurus in a paper for the Geological that also contained an important description and analysis of all that had been learned to that point about the anatomy of ichthyosaurs including the fact that there had been at least three different species. His predictions about the plesiosaur were proved correct by the discovery of a nearly complete skeleton by Mary Anning in 1823, which Conybeare described to the Geological Society in 1824. Among his most important memoirs is that on the south-western coal district of England, written in conjunction with Dr Buckland, and published in 1824.
He wrote also on the valley of the Thames, on Elie de Beaumont&#x27;s theory of mountain-chains, and on the great landslip which occurred near Lyme Regis in 1839 when he was vicar of Axminster.

His principal work, however, is the &quot;Outlines of the Geology of England and Wales&quot; (1822), being a second edition of the small work issued by William Phillips and written in co-operation with that author. The original contributions of Conybeare formed the principal portion of this edition, of which only Part 1, dealing with the Carboniferous and newer strata, was published. It affords evidence throughout of the extensive and accurate knowledge possessed by Conybeare; and it exercised a marked influence on the progress of geology in Britain.

Conybeare was an advocate of gap creationism.

He was a fellow of the Royal Society and a corresponding member of the Institute of France. In 1844, he was awarded the Wollaston medal by the Geological Society of London.

His elder brother, the scholar John Josias Conybeare, was also interested in geology.

===Death===

He was taken ill on the way to Weybridge, Surrey, to see his gravely ill eldest son, William John Conybeare in July 1857, who died, and his own death followed shortly thereafter on 12 August 1857, at Itchen Stoke, Hampshire, where another son, Charles Ranken Conybeare, had recently taken up the incumbency of the parish church, and a third son, Henry Conybeare, was later to build a new church to replace it.
He is buried near the Chapter House at Llandaff Cathedral and his tomb is marked by a cross on a slender memorial shaft.

<text>John Josias Conybeare (1779–1824), the elder brother of William Daniel Conybeare, was a scholar of Anglo-Saxon.

He was an accomplished scholar, and studied at Christ Church, Oxford. He became vicar of Batheaston, and was Rawlinsonian Professor of Anglo-Saxon (1808–1812), and afterwards Professor of Poetry (1812–1821), at the University of Oxford.

==Works==
He published a translation of Beowulf in English and Latin verse (1814), but is particularly noted for his posthumously published 1826 &quot;Illustrations of Anglo-Saxon Poetry&quot;.

Like his brother, he was a student of geology and communicated papers to the &quot;Annals of Philosophy&quot; and the &quot;Transactions&quot; of the Geological Society of London (Obituary in &quot;Ann. Phil.&quot; vol. viii., Sept. 1824, p. 162.)

He gave the Bampton Lectures at Oxford in 1824. These were published posthumously (also in 1824) as &quot;An attempt to trace the History and ascertain the Limits of the Secondary and Spiritual Interpretation of Scripture&quot;.

<text>Marc Laidlaw is an American writer. He is a former lead writer for the video game company Valve, where he worked on the &quot;Half-Life&quot; series before his departure in 2016. Before joining Valve, Laidlaw was a novelist working in the fantasy and horror genres, and in 1996 won the International Horror Guild Award for his novel &quot;The 37th Mandala&quot;.

==Biography==
Laidlaw attended the University of Oregon, where he tried, and was discouraged by, punched card computer programming. He wrote short stories and his first novel, &quot;Dad&#x27;s Nuke&quot;, was published in 1985. This was followed by several more novels over the next decade, while working as a legal secretary in San Francisco.

Laidlaw had played computer and arcade games, but was not intrigued until he played &quot;Myst&quot; (1993). He obsessed over &quot;Myst&quot; and bought a new computer so that he could play it. He wrote &quot;The Third Force&quot; (1996), a tie-in novel based on the world of the &quot;Gadget&quot; computer game.

=== 1990s–2016: Valve ===
Laidlaw joined the video game company Valve while they were developing their first game, the first-person shooter (FPS) &quot;Half-Life&quot; (1998). He was hired to work on another game, &quot;Prospero&quot;, but switched when &quot;Prospero&quot; was canceled and the &quot;Half-Life&quot; project expanded.

Laidlaw said his contribution was to add &quot;old storytelling tricks&quot; to Valve&#x27;s ambitious designs. Rather than dictate narrative elements, he worked with the team to improvise ideas, and was inspired by their experiments. He contributed to the &quot;visual grammar&quot; of the level design, and focused on &quot;doing storytelling with the architecture ... The narrative had to be baked into the corridors.&quot;

For &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; (2004), the team developed the characterization. Laidlaw created family relationships between the characters, saying it was a &quot;basic dramatic unit everyone understands&quot; that was rarely used in games. He also worked on &quot;Half-Life 2: Episode One&quot; (2006) and &quot;Half-Life 2: Episode Two&quot; (2007), plus several canceled &quot;Half-Life&quot; projects, including &quot;Half-Life 2: Episode Three&quot; and a virtual reality game set on a time-travelling ship. Laidlaw said he had intended &quot;Episode Three&quot; to end the &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; story arc, at which point he would &quot;step away from it and leave it to the next generation&quot;. In 2012, Laidlaw started a Twitter account to tell a story about the &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; character Dr Breen. He described the story as &quot;fan fiction&quot;, and wrote: &quot;I personally cannot give the world a &quot;Half-Life&quot; game. All I can personally do, at least for now, is stuff like this.&quot;

Laidlaw also contributed to Valve&#x27;s puzzle series &quot;Portal&quot;, which is set in the &quot;Half-Life&quot; universe. He disliked the crossover, feeling it &quot;made both universes smaller&quot;, and said later: &quot;I just had to react as gracefully as I could to the fact that it was going there without me. It didn&#x27;t make any sense except from a resource-restricted point of view.&quot;

=== 2016–present: Departure from Valve ===
Laidlaw announced his departure from Valve in January 2016. He said the primary reason for his departure was his age, and that he planned to return to writing stories. Laidlaw later said he was tired of the FPS genre and of solving storytelling problems in a &quot;Half-Life&quot;-style narrative. He said he had &quot;always hoped that we&#x27;d stumble into a more expansive vocabulary or grammar for storytelling within the FPS medium, one that would let you do more than shoot or push buttons, or push crates&quot;.

On August 25, 2017, Laidlaw published a short story titled &quot;Epistle 3&quot;, describing it as &quot;a snapshot of a dream I had many years ago&quot;. Journalists interpreted it as a summary of what could have been the plot for &quot;Half-Life 2: Episode Three&quot;, though Laidlaw later denied this. In 2023, Laidlaw said he regretted publishing the story. He said he had been &quot;deranged&quot; and &quot;completely out of touch&quot; at the time, and that it had created problems for his former colleagues at Valve. Valve released a new game, &quot;Half-Life: Alyx&quot;, in 2020. As of 2023, Laidlaw had not played it and said: &quot;I don&#x27;t ever need to see another Combine soldier again, not even in VR.&quot;

In 2018, Laidlaw completed a new novel, &quot;Underneath the Oversea&quot;, but could not find a publisher and self-published it on Kindle. He said the publishing world had &quot;forgotten who he was&quot; and that his age prevented publishers from building a new audience.

== Personal life ==
In 2003, Laidlaw said his favorite games included &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, &quot;Animal Crossing&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Ico&quot;, &quot;Fatal Frame&quot; and &quot;&quot;. After leaving Valve, Laidlaw moved to Kauai, Hawaii. He has an amateur radio license and his call sign is WH6FXC.

<doc id="1336827" wikidata="Q3124850" url="?curid=1336827" title="R. E. Foster">
<text>Reginald Erskine Foster (16 April 1878 – 13 May 1914), nicknamed Tip Foster, commonly designated R. E. Foster in sporting literature, was an English first-class cricketer and footballer. He is the only man to have captained England at both sports.

One of seven Foster brothers who were all educated at Malvern College and who all played cricket for Malvern and for Worcestershire, Foster was a right-handed middle-order batsman. In 1903 he scored 287 on Test debut, setting a world record for the highest Test score.

==Cricket career==

Foster was educated at Malvern College and University College, Oxford. He first played for Oxford University Cricket Club in 1897; in addition to cricket, he also represented Oxford at football, racquets and golf. However, although he did fairly well, it was not until 1899 that his beautiful and immaculate driving to the off-side made him into one of the finest batsmen of his time. He had played for Worcestershire while they were still a minor county but in 1899, their inaugural season as a first-class county, he and his brother Wilfrid Foster both scored two hundreds in a match (against Hampshire), a feat which remains unique in county cricket. In 1900, as captain of Oxford, he scored 171 to set the record for the highest individual score in the Varsity Match, and he scored 102 not out and 136 for the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord&#x27;s, the first man to score two centuries in a match in the Gentleman v Players series. In total, Foster scored 930 runs at an average of 77.5 for Oxford in the 1900 season, a record in University cricket.

For these performances, Foster was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1901 and the following year a superb run of form for Worcestershire resulted in him scoring 1,957 runs, at an average of 54.36. However, business prevented him representing the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in Australia the following year and England undoubtedly missed his brilliant batting. Moreover, apart from one match against Warwickshire, he could devote no time to first-class cricket in May and June 1902, ruling him out of contention for an England place against Australia.

In 1903, his appearances were restricted to three matches in June and August, but England were desperate for a captain for that winter&#x27;s Ashes tour. Foster was (oddly) able to arrange to be away from England. Although one might have feared that he would be out of practice, in the first Test at Sydney in 1903, Foster scored 287. This was the highest score in Test cricket until 1930 (surpassed by Andy Sandham), and remains the highest score by a debutant and the third highest by a batsman of any nationality against Australia, home or away (surpassed only by Len Hutton&#x27;s 364 in 1938 &amp; Ross Taylor&#x27;s 290 in 2015). For more than a century, Foster also held the record for the highest score in a test match at the SCG, his score not being beaten until Australian Michael Clarke scored 329 not out against India in January 2012. Foster did not follow it up, until the final Test on a vicious wicket at Melbourne, where he top-scored in both innings with 18 (in a total of 61 all out) and, having been promoted to open, an excellent 30 (out of 101 all out).

In the following three seasons Foster could spare no time for cricket, apart from August 1905 (when he scored 246 on his first appearance), but in 1907 he was able to find time to play regularly from the beginning of June. His batting was as good as ever in a summer of appalling wickets and helped Worcestershire (fourteenth of sixteen counties in 1906) to rise to equal second with Yorkshire. He captained England in the three-match series against South Africa in 1907, winning one match and drawing two. Offered the captaincy of the MCC for the 1907/1908 Ashes tour, Foster declined because business commitments were monopolising his attention.

After the Third Test of 1907 he could spare time for only two more first-class matches, one in 1910 (when he scored 133 against Yorkshire) and one in 1912. However, in Saturday club cricket, he never lost his brilliance. In one club match in 1909 he scored 261 in just 75 minutes.

==Football career==

In football, Foster played as a forward for the Corinthians in the early 1900s, scoring 22 goals in 26 matches. He also played for Old Malvernians, a team made up of ex pupils from Malvern College.

He played five matches for England between 1900 and 1902, making his debut against Wales on 26 March 1900. In his second game, against Ireland at the Dell, Southampton, he scored his first international goal in a 3–0 victory. C. B. Fry played at full-back in the same game. Foster was awarded the captaincy against Wales in his final appearance on 3 March 1902, which ended in a 0–0 draw. During his short England career he scored two goals.

He also played one match for England Amateurs against Germany, on 21 September 1901, at White Hart Lane, London. He scored 6 (one source gives 7) in a 12-0 win.

==Business career==
Foster was a member of the stock exchange.

==Death==
By 1913 it was clear Foster was suffering severely from diabetes. A trip to South Africa failed to help him recover and he died in May 1914 at the age of 36.

<text>Slow, Deep and Hard is the debut studio album by the American gothic metal band Type O Negative, released on June 11, 1991, through Roadrunner Records. The album was originally titled None More Negative, and released in 1990 as a demo under the group&#x27;s former name Repulsion.

==Production==

Keyboardist and producer Josh Silver convinced his parents to lend him $6,000 in late 1989 so the band could record the album.

==Composition==

&quot;Revolver&quot; said that the album was &quot;noisy and angry&quot; and &quot;a far cry from the hooky choruses and doom-out goth of their 1993 breakout, &quot;Bloody Kisses&quot;,&quot; having more in common with the New York hardcore sound of Peter Steele&#x27;s previous band, Carnivore. The lyrics were intended to be sarcastic, though several songs, like &quot;Unsuccessfully Coping With the Natural Beauty of Infidelity,&quot; &quot;Prelude to Agony&quot; and &quot;Der Untermensch&quot;, led to accusations of misogyny, bigotry and Nazism in part due to Untermensch (German &quot;sub-human&quot;) being a blanket term used by the Nazis to refer to non-Aryans. Keyboardist Josh Silver, who is Jewish, recalled, &quot;They just invented a bunch of shit and said we were Nazis. Meanwhile, there were bands playing right down the block that are sieg-heiling the audience, and nobody&#x27;s bothering with them. But it was a good and bad thing. As a Jew, I obviously never wanna be labeled as a Nazi. But at the same time, go ahead and make us famous. That&#x27;s fine.&quot; Silver said, regarding the album&#x27;s lyrics, &quot;I think Peter was at the height of his lyrical powers&quot;. However, they did not translate well to non-English speaking countries, where lyrics intended as being sarcastic were directly translated and taken literally. &quot;Unsuccessfully Coping With the Natural Beauty of Infidelity&quot; used the chord structure of Simple Minds&#x27; song &quot;Don&#x27;t You (Forget About Me)&quot;. &quot;The Misinterpretation of Silence and Its Disastrous Consequences&quot; consists of hiss from a blank audio cassette tape; Silver explained, &quot;We actually just ran a blank tape. We were hoping people would think it was fucked up and turn their stereos up really loud. Then the next song would kick in.&quot; The main riff of &quot;Gravitational Constant&quot; was inspired by the theme song for the sitcom &quot;The Munsters&quot;.

==Release==
The recordings on the album initially appeared on a demo called &quot;None More Negative&quot;, released under the band name Repulsion. After the band found out that there was another band using this name, they changed their name to Type O Negative. The cover image was taken from a pornographic magazine, a close-up of a penis entering a vagina during sexual intercourse.

On March 24, 2009, Type O Negative reissued the album with remastered audio, revised artwork, and expanded liner notes. This remaster features the bonus track &quot;Hey Pete (Pete&#x27;s Ego Trip Version)&quot; which originally appeared on the album &quot;The Least Worst Of&quot;. This is a studio version of the song which appears live on the album &quot;The Origin Of The Feces&quot;.

<text>Sylvan Pass (el. ) is a mountain pass located in the Absaroka Range in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. The pass provides access to the park from the east entrance.

The pass was named after nearby Sylvan Lake (derived from medieval Latin sylvānus, from Latin Silvānus, god of the woods, from silva, forest), and was formed by frost action breaking the rocks. The park road through the pass was closed during winter but is now open to visitors throughout winter. The road is maintained to allow access via snowmobile, snow coach, and cross-country skiing. In the 2007–08 season it cost the parks service in excess of $200,000 to keep it open and avalanche control measures were put in place.

The Sylvan Pass route is the only way to enter/exit Yellowstone National Park from the East Entrance.

Sylvan Pass is the low point of the saddle between Hoyt Peak and Top Notch Peak.

The original road through the pass was designed by Captain Hiram Chittenden of the Army Corps of Engineers.

==Climate==
Sylvan Lake (Yellowstone Park) is located near the summit of Sylvan Pass at an altitude of 8420 feet (2566 m). Sylvan Lake has a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;), characterized by long, cold winters and short summers.
The weather station, Yellowstone NP East ENT, is situated roughly halfway between the summit of Sylvan Pass and Pahaska Tepee, at an elevation of 6954 feet (2120 m).

<text>Michał Drzymała (; 13 September 1857 – 25 April 1937) was a Polish peasant living in the Greater Poland region (or the Grand Duchy of Posen) under Prussian rule. He is a Polish folk hero because, after he was denied permission to build a house on his own land (he was Polish and opposed to Germanization) by the Prussian authorities in the village of Kaisertreu, he bought a circus wagon and turned it into his home. At the time, Prussian law considered any dwelling a house if it remained stationary for more than 24 hours. Drzymała used the mobility of the wagon to exploit the law and to avoid the negative consequences by moving the wagon each day and thus preventing the Prussians the ability to penalize him. His dwelling became known as Drzymała&#x27;s wagon (&quot;Wóz Drzymały&quot;), and gained notoriety when this case was described by the Polish and European newspapers, making fun of the Prussian state, and energizing the Poles living under the Prussian authority against it.

<text>Findev Inc. (formerly TransGaming Inc.) is a real estate investing company, with its head office in Toronto. It is involved in property development within the Greater Toronto Area. The company is aligned with Plazacorp, a property development company, which is its major shareholder. The current CEO is Sruli Weinreb.

A former technology company founded by Gavriel State - who ran the Linux product division at Corel. TransGaming&#x27;s Graphics and Portability Group was acquired by NVIDIA in 2015, paving the way to NVIDIA&#x27;s first office in Toronto, Canada.

In 2016, TransGaming Inc. decided to change its business focus from technology and gaming to real estate financing. In August 2016 its last remaining gaming division, GameTree TV, with its subsidiaries and offices in Tel Aviv and Kyiv, were sold to TransGaming Interactive UK Limited - a subsidiary of General Media Ventures based in the United Kingdom. This company, now renamed to PlayWorks Digital Ltd., carries on the former GameTree TV business under the PlayWorks name.

== Former technology products ==

=== Cider ===
Cider was a technology marketed towards developers that allowed Windows games to run on Mac OS X. It shared much of the same core technology as Cedega but was designed for video game designers and publishers. Like Cedega, Cider was a proprietary fork of Wine.

At the 2007 Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC07), Electronic Arts announced their return to the Mac, publishing various titles simultaneously on both PCs and Macs, using Cider on the Mac.

In a newsletter dated 2007-11-13, the company announced that Cider&#x27;s improvements will be merging back into Cedega.

=== GameTree Linux ===

GameTree Linux was a developer program dedicated to further developing Cedega, a compatibility layer for running Microsoft Windows games on Linux. There are games that run on Cedega but not on wine, and games that run on wine but not Cedega. Users that want to play a specific game usually look for it on the games databases available on the web.

=== SwiftShader ===

SwiftShader is a high-performance CPU-based implementation of the Vulkan graphics API. Its goal is to provide hardware independence for advanced 3D graphics. It contains shaders and other Direct3D 8/9 class capabilities. SwiftShader was sold to Google in 2015 for US$1.25 million. It is currently used in Google Chrome as well as in Apple&#x27;s Safari Web Browser to render 3D content. SwiftShader is built around two major optimizations that affect its architecture: dynamic code generation, and parallel processing. Generating code at run-time allows to eliminate code branches and optimizes register usage, specializing the processing routines for exactly the operations required by each draw call. Parallel processing means both utilizing the CPU&#x27;s multiple cores and processing multiple elements accoss the width of the SIMD vector units. 

=== GameTree TV ===

In 2010 TransGaming launched their new app, GameTree TV, a cloud-based, on-demand entertainment platform for Smart TV. In 2012 TransGaming acquired the connected TV division of Oberon Media and integrated them into their GameTree TV platform. 

=== Digital rights management (DRM) ===
In a press release dated 2008-08-20, TransGaming announced that they &quot;will utilize Sony DADC&#x27;s SecuROM digital rights management (DRM) solution for all video game titles enabled through TransGaming&#x27;s Cider portability engine for Mac games.&quot; TransGaming&#x27;s use of SecuROM is notable because of the company&#x27;s decision to use SecuROM technology for all Mac games enabled through Cider, irrespective of distribution channel (download vs. retail) and whether SecuROM was used for a game&#x27;s Windows PC release.

<doc id="1336900" wikidata="Q7922828" url="?curid=1336900" title="Vertical displacement">
<text>In tectonics, vertical displacement refers to the shifting of land in a vertical direction, resulting in uplift and subsidence. The displacement of rock layers can provide information on how and why Earth&#x27;s lithosphere changes throughout geologic time. There are different mechanisms which lead to vertical displacement such as tectonic activity, and isostatic adjustments. Tectonic activity leads to vertical displacement when crust is rearranged during a seismic event. Isostatic adjustments result in vertical displacement through sinking due to an increased load or isostatic rebound due to load removal.

== Tectonic causes of vertical displacement ==
Vertical displacement resulting from tectonic activity occurs at divergent and convergent plate boundaries. The movement of magma in the asthenosphere can create divergent plate boundaries as the magma begins to rise and protrude weaker lithospheric crust. Subsidence at a divergent plate boundary is a form of vertical displacement which occurs when a plate begins to split apart. As intrusive magma widens the rift zone of a divergent plate boundary the layers of crust on the surface above the rift will subside into the rift, creating a vertical displacement of those layers of surface crust.

Convergent plate boundaries create orogenies such as the Laramide orogeny that raised the Rocky Mountains. For this orogen event dense oceanic crust from the Pacific plate subducts beneath the less dense continental crust of the North American plate as they converge. This subduction induced the compression of the bounded western region of the North American plate which created the uplift of different layers of rock. This vertical displacement created the various mountain formations which are cumulatively known as the Rocky Mountain range.

Earthquakes are one mechanism that leads to vertical displacement of crust. The fracturing of land during an earthquake creates a fault when land is displaced during the event. The throw of the fault is a term used to describe and quantify the magnitude of this displacement.

== Glacial isostatic adjustment ==

Changes in glaciation can lead to the vertical displacement of crust. Glaciers and ice sheets residing on top of landmass result in an isostatic depression, or sinking, in a section of lithospheric crust due to the weight of the ice. Likewise, isostatic rebound, or uplift, occurs when glaciers and ice sheets recede.

Using asthenosphere viscosity data researchers are able to determine the rate by which isostatic rebound occurs. Isostatic rebound occurrence rate can be determined by comparing local viscosities to the maximum viscosity of the asthenosphere. Areas with higher viscosity are subject to quick isostatic rebound while in regions of low viscosity crustal uplift occurs at a slower rate. Uplift is still occurring through isostatic rebound from the Last Glacial Maximum.

Glacial isostatic rebound leads to sea level regression which can be measured using 14C dating to determine the age of sublittoral sediment in different regions along the seafloor.

<text>Sacabaya (also known as Tambo Quemado) is a pyroclastic shield in Bolivia. It is located on the Altiplano near to the Rio Lauca. The volcano is composed of ignimbrite, which has formed a shield. The shield is capped by an area of vents which has many overlapping craters, and is elongated in shape. At the southern end lies the youngest of the craters which has a lava dome within it.

Sacabaya has a diameter of and rises to the summit; the edifice is covered by material produced during explosive activity. The summit contains a north-south row of several pit craters, each with a diameter of about , and one of which contains a lava dome. Material from the volcano has been transported away by wind. The volcano may be of Holocene age and is presently fumarolically active (GVP).

<text>Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) is a political party based primarily in the Indian state of Haryana. It was initially founded as the Haryana Lok Dal (Rashtriya) by Devi Lal in 1996, who served as the Deputy Prime Minister of India. 

The party emerged as a significant voice advocating for farmers&#x27; rights and rural development in the state of Haryana. It has played a crucial role in advocating for agricultural reforms and regional development as well. The party is generally considered to adhere to the ideology of regionalism and follows a centrist position within the spectrum of India&#x27;s politics.

The party was led by Om Prakash Chautala, the son of Devi Lal, until his death on 20th December 2024. Both of them had served as the Chief Minister of Haryana. 
Om Prakash Chautala&#x27;s son, Abhay Singh Chautala is the current General Secretary.

On 27 January 2021, Abhay Singh Chautala had resigned as the only MLA from the party citing the BJP-led Union government&#x27;s refusal to accept farmers’ demands. He was later re-elected from the Ellenabad constituency in a bypoll election on 2 November 2021.

== History ==

Chaudhary Devi Lal, following his triumph in the election for the Rori constituency to the Haryana Legislative Assembly in 1974, established the Bharatiya Lok Dal. Subsequently, the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) emerged in 1987 after the assembly election. The electoral battles of 1982 and 1987 were waged under the banner of Lok Dal (LKD), marking a transitional phase for the party. Notably, in 1998, the party underwent a rebranding, adopting its current name.

The party&#x27;s political affiliations saw it become a constituent of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Consequently, it contributed to the governance helmed by the Bharatiya Janata Party from 1998 to 2004 on the federal stage.

The Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) has faced a series of electoral setbacks, notably performing below expectations in each of the four successive general elections conducted since 1998. It has experienced a string of defeats in the Haryana assembly elections, facing losses in the years 2005, 2009, and 2014. Moreover, despite forming an alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2009, the party encountered disappointment by failing to secure any seats in the Lok Sabha during both the 2004 and 2009 general elections.

During the 1999 Lok Sabha elections, the INLD forged an electoral alliance with the BJP in Haryana. Each party contested five out of the ten seats in the state, resulting in a clean sweep with all ten candidates securing victories. Subsequently, in 2000, Chautala clinched his fifth term as the Chief Minister of Haryana. The INLD exhibited strong performance in the state assembly elections, securing 47 out of the 90 available seats. However, following this success, the party opted to sever ties with the BJP, consequently departing from both the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the government. The 2004 electoral contest saw the party vying for 20 Lok Sabha seats across Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Chandigarh. Unfortunately, a majority of these candidates, numbering 14, failed to retain their deposits. Specifically, in Haryana, the INLD&#x27;s 10 candidates managed to secure 22.43% of the votes. Meanwhile, in Rajasthan, 5 candidates garnered 0.52% of the votes, 4 candidates in Uttar Pradesh secured a mere 0.02%, and the sole candidate in Chandigarh amassed 6.61% of the votes.

In the subsequent 2005 Haryana state assembly elections, the INLD faced a substantial setback, losing its majority by securing only 9 out of the 90 available seats. This marked a significant decline compared to the Congress party&#x27;s sweeping victory, clinching 67 seats during the same electoral contest. In 2009, the INLD won 31 seats.

On 16 January 2013, Om Prakash Chautala and Ajay Chautala were sent jail after a New Delhi court sentenced them to ten years imprisonment under various provisions of the IPC and the Prevention of Corruption Act. In the 16th Lok Sabha elections, the INLD won on two seats. Dushyant Chautala was elected from the Hisar Lok Sabha constituency and Charanjeet Singh Rori was elected for a Sirsa Lok Sabha constituency.

In Rohtak at Chhotu Ram Stadium, INLD made the Guinness World Records for having supporters apply for 10,450 eye donations in 8 hours. In the 2014 Legislative Assembly election, the INLD won 19 seats and became the Opposition party in the state, earning more seats than the Congress party. Abhay Singh Chautala was elected as the Leader of the Opposition in the Haryana Legislative Assembly.

On 14 April 2015, &quot;Indian National Lok Dal&quot;, Janata Dal (United), Janata Dal (Secular), Rashtriya Janata Dal, Samajwadi Party, and Samajwadi Janata Party (Rashtriya) announced that they would merge into a new national Janata Parivar Alliance. 

Jannayak Janta Party emerged from a split in the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) which itself had been caused by infighting among the Chautala family. An INLD rally at Gohana in October 2018 had seen heckling of Abhay Chautala, a son of INLD leader Om Prakash Chautala for which Dushyant Chautala, a grandson, and his younger brother, Digvijay Chautala, were blamed. The JJP was formally launched at a rally in Jind in December 2018 by Dushyant Chautala who held a seat in the Lok Sabha of the national Parliament of India, from when he was an INLD member.

For the 2019 Haryana Legislative Assembly election, they forged an alliance with Shiromani Akali Dal. Previously, both parties fought elections together but their alliance fell in 2017 over the issue of the Sutlej Yamuna link canal. Abhay Singh Chautala was elected as the lone MLA of the party.

On 27 January 2021, Abhay Singh Chautala had resigned as the only MLA from the party citing the BJP-led Union government&#x27;s refusal to accept farmers’ demands. He was later re-elected from the Ellenabad constituency in a bypoll election on 2 November 2021.

On 25 February 2024, preceding the 2024 Indian general election, Haryana INLD State Vice-President, Nafe Singh Rathee was shot dead by unidentified gunmen who ambushed his SUV in the Jhajjar district. Rathee and his associates were inside the vehicle when the men, who came in a car, opened fire, and fled. Another party leader who was travelling with him also died while two others were critically injured. 

Before the 2024 Indian general election, Abhay Singh Chautala formed an alliance with Haryana Nationalist Congress Party (SP) Chief Virender Verma to contest from the Karnal Lok Sabha constituency against Manohar Lal Khattar. Abhay Singh Chautala and the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) party extended full support to Virender Verma. 

In July 2024, before the 2024 Haryana Legislative Assembly election, INLD decided to contest elections in alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), where the latter will contest 27 seats and the former shall contest the rest. The party managed to win two seats, one more than last time.

<doc id="1336913" wikidata="Q5300018" url="?curid=1336913" title="Double dissolution">
<text>A double dissolution is a procedure permitted under the Australian Constitution to resolve deadlocks in the bicameral Parliament of Australia between the House of Representatives (lower house) and the Senate (upper house). A double dissolution is the only circumstance in which the entire Senate can be dissolved.

Similar to the United States Congress, but unlike the British Parliament, Australia&#x27;s two parliamentary houses generally have almost equal legislative power (the Senate may reject outright but cannot amend appropriation (money) bills, which must originate in the House of Representatives). Governments, which are formed in the House of Representatives, can be frustrated by a Senate determined to reject their legislation.

If the conditions (called a trigger) are satisfied, the prime minister can advise the governor-general to dissolve both houses of Parliament and call a full election. If, after the election, the legislation that triggered the double dissolution is still not passed by the two houses, then a joint sitting of the two houses of parliament can be called to vote on the legislation. If the legislation is passed by the joint sitting, it is deemed to have passed both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The 1974 joint sitting remains the only occurrence in federal Australian history.

Historically, a double dissolution election has been called in lieu of an early election, with the formal trigger bill not playing a significant role during the subsequent election campaign.

There are also similar double dissolution provisions in the South Australian state constitution.

==Constitutional basis==
Part of section 57 of the Constitution provides:

If the House of Representatives passes any proposed law, and the Senate rejects or fails to pass it, or passes it with amendments to which the House of Representatives will not agree, and if after an interval of three months the House of Representatives, in the same or the next session, again passes the proposed law with or without any amendments which have been made, suggested, or agreed to by the Senate, and the Senate rejects or fails to pass it, or passes it with amendments to which the House of Representatives will not agree, the Governor-General may dissolve the Senate and the House of Representatives simultaneously. But such dissolution shall not take place within six months before the date of the expiry of the House of Representatives by effluxion of time.

Section 57 also provides that, following the election, if the Senate a third time rejects the bill or bills that were the subject of the double dissolution, the Governor-General may convene a joint sitting of the two houses to consider the bill or bills, including any amendments which have been previously proposed in either house, or any new amendments. If a bill is passed by an absolute majority of the total membership of the joint sitting, it is treated as though it had been passed separately by both houses, and is presented for royal assent. The only time this procedure was invoked was in the 1974 joint sitting.

==Trigger event==
The double dissolution provision comes into play if the Senate and House twice fail to agree on a piece of legislation (in section 57 called a &quot;proposed law&quot;, and commonly referred to as a &quot;trigger&quot;). When one or more such triggers exist, the Governor-General may dissolve both the House and Senate – pursuant to section 57 of the Constitution – and issue writs for an election in which every seat in the Parliament is contested.

The conditions stipulated by section 57 of the Constitution are:

* The trigger bill originated in the House of Representatives.
* Three months elapsed between the two rejections of the bill by the Senate (&quot;rejection&quot; in this context can extend to the Senate&#x27;s failure to pass the bill, or to the Senate passing it with amendments to which the House of Representatives will not agree).
* The second rejection occurred in the same session as the first, or the subsequent session, but no later.

There is no similar provision for resolving deadlocks with respect to bills that have originated in the Senate and are blocked in the House of Representatives.

Though the Constitution refers to possible actions by the Governor-General, it had long been presumed that convention required the Governor-General to act only on the advice of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet. However, as the 1975 constitutional crisis demonstrated, the Governor-General is not compelled to follow the Prime Minister&#x27;s advice. In these cases, he or she must be personally satisfied that the conditions specified in the Constitution apply, and is entitled to seek additional information or advice before coming to a decision.

==Practice and misconceptions==
As a High Court Chief Justice Barwick observed in a unanimous decision in &quot;Cormack v Cope (Joint Sittings Case)&quot; (1974) (with emphasis added):

== History ==
There have been seven double dissolutions: in 1914, 1951, 1974, 1975, 1983, 1987 and 2016. However, a joint sitting following a double dissolution pursuant to section 57 has only taken place once, in 1974.

* In 1914, the Joseph Cook Commonwealth Liberal Party sought to abolish preferential employment for trade union members in the public service, resulting in a double dissolution on 30 July 1914. In the election on 5 September 1914 the government was defeated by the opposition, Andrew Fisher&#x27;s Australian Labor Party, and the bill was not pursued.
* In 1951, the Robert Menzies Liberal–Country Party coalition government sought to reverse the proposed nationalisation of the banks put in place by the Australian Labor Party government led by Ben Chifley. The repeal was opposed by the Labor Party in the Senate. Parliament was dissolved on 19 March 1951. In the election on 28 April 1951, the government was returned with a reduced majority in the lower house, but now with a majority in the Senate. The Commonwealth Bank Bill was presented to Parliament again on 26 June 1951 and passed both houses.
* In 1974, the Gough Whitlam Labor government was unable to pass a large number of bills through a hostile Senate. The government had announced a half-Senate election, but in the wake of the Gair affair, Whitlam decided to call a double dissolution on 11 April 1974, citing six bills as triggers. The bills included representation of the territories and for the setting up of Medibank. At the election of 18 May 1974, the government was returned, but still without a majority in the Senate. Sir Paul Hasluck&#x27;s term as Governor-General ended on 11 July and the new Governor-General Sir John Kerr took office. The trigger bills were reintroduced and again rejected by the Senate and on 30 July Kerr approved Whitlam&#x27;s request for a joint sitting. The coalition parties applied to the High Court on 1 August to prevent the joint sitting. One of the grounds was that the dissolution writs did not set out which &quot;proposed laws&quot; were the subject of the dissolution and that only one bill could be dealt with at a joint sitting. The court delivered a unanimous decision on 5 August 1974 and ruled that the sitting was constitutionally valid, that the joint sitting may deal with any number of trigger bills, and that provided the circumstances set out in section 57 had been satisfied then the Governor-General need not specify which &quot;proposed laws&quot; were to be the subject of a future joint sitting. The joint sitting took place on 6–7 August 1974, and it passed the 6 trigger bills. Thirteen months later, four states challenged the validity of various laws passed in the joints sitting. The High Court upheld the validity of the &quot;Senate (Representation of Territories) Act&quot; 1973, the &quot;Commonwealth Electoral Act (No. 2)&quot; 1973, and the &quot;Representation Act&quot; 1973, The &quot;Petroleum and Minerals Authority Act&quot; 1973, was challenged on the grounds that there had not been the required 3 month gap between the Senate&#x27;s first and second rejections of that Act. The High Court ruled that the Act was not eligible for the double dissolution process, as the Senate had not had sufficient time to &quot;fail to pass&quot; it.
* In 1975, the Whitlam government was again frustrated by a hostile Senate. The government had accumulated a total of 21 trigger bills, but did not call for a double dissolution. However, the Whitlam government was unable to obtain passage of appropriation bills through the hostile Senate, leading to the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis. On 11 November 1975, in an attempt to break the deadlock, Whitlam intended to call a half-Senate election, but instead was dismissed by the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr, who then appointed Malcolm Fraser, the Leader of the Liberal-Country coalition Opposition, caretaker Prime Minister. The Fraser minority government immediately passed the Supply bills through the Senate before losing a no-confidence motion in the House of Representatives. Kerr then dissolved both houses of Parliament on the advice of the new Prime Minister citing the trigger bills, even though Fraser had opposed the bills. Fraser remained the caretaker Prime Minister during the election campaign. In the election on 13 December 1975 the Fraser government was elected with a majority in both houses and the trigger bills were not brought up after the election.
* On 3 February 1983, Malcolm Fraser called a double dissolution, citing 13 trigger bills. When Fraser called the election, he expected he would be facing Bill Hayden as the alternative prime minister. But unbeknown to Fraser, Labor had changed leadership from Hayden to Bob Hawke earlier that same morning. The Fraser coalition government was defeated by the Labor Opposition led by Hawke at the election on 5 March 1983, and the bills lapsed. Fraser is the only prime minister to have advised two double dissolutions (1975 and 1983).
* On 5 June 1987, Bob Hawke called a double dissolution after the rejection of the Australia Card Bill 1986. The government was returned at the election of 11 July 1987, but still without a Senate majority. The bill was reintroduced in September 1987, and a vote in the Senate was planned for 7 October. A retired public servant, Ewart Smith, said that the Australia Card Bill was unworkable because the implementation date would have needed to be the subject of a regulation, which would have required the concurrence of the Senate alone, which was hostile to the legislation. Even if the bill had been passed by the parliament at a joint sitting, the Opposition could still have prevented it from being implemented as long as it held a majority in the Senate. In these circumstances, Hawke decided to abandon the bill. Sir Ninian Stephen is the only Governor-General to have approved two double dissolutions (1983 and 1987).
* On 8 May 2016, Malcolm Turnbull called a double dissolution election for 2 July 2016, citing three of the four available trigger bills. The trigger bills were reintroduced to parliament after the election and all were passed with amendments.

=== Summary ===
The following table is a summary of the relevant details:

==Elections==
A double dissolution affects the outcome of elections for houses of parliament using proportional representation over multiple elections, such as the proportional voting system for the Senate where each state normally only elects half its Senate delegation, but following a double dissolution, each state elects its entire senate delegation. The outcome is affected in two ways:

# the quota for a seat is lower making it easier for smaller parties to win seats; and
# Senators need to be allocated long-term and short-term seats.

Neither of these issues arise in relation to the two territories represented in the Senate as each elects its two senators to a term ending at the dissolution of the House of Representatives.

=== Quota ===
Under proportional representation, the more seats there are, the easier it is for smaller parties to win seat. A double dissolution increases the number of available seats because all seats are contested in the same election. The following calculations refer to the current arrangements of 12 senate seats per state since 1984, however the calculations are similar for the period from 1949 until 1983 when there were 10 senate seats per state. The quota for the election of each senator in each Australian state in a full senate election is 7.69% (formula_1), while in a normal half-Senate election the quota is 14.28% (formula_2).

While the threshold is lower for smaller parties, for more significant parties the distribution of candidates&#x27; votes as they are eliminated has a rounding effect. A double dissolution favours parties that have a vote significantly greater than a multiple of the required double dissolution vote and greater than a multiple of the normal quota. It disadvantages those that do not. For example, a party achieving 10% of the vote is likely to get one candidate out of six elected in a regular election (as minor parties&#x27; votes are distributed until they get to 14.28%) but the same party with the same vote is likely to have one candidate out of 12 elected during a double dissolution election (as their second candidate will be left with 2.31% and be excluded early in the count). A party with 25% is likely to achieve three candidates out of 12 during a double dissolution election (three candidates and 1.83% of the vote for their 4th candidate distributed to other candidates) and two out of six in a regular election (one candidate taking 14.28% and the second holding 10.72% remains standing until minor parties&#x27; preferences push the second candidate to a quota).

Since the abolition of group voting tickets in the lead-up to the 2016 general election, it is no longer possible to create &quot;calculators&quot; that assess the senate election outcome with reasonable accuracy. Antony Green&#x27;s working guide is that &quot;if a party has more than 0.5 of a quota, it will be in the race for one of the final seats&quot;. His calculation of the percentage of primary-vote required for the first six full- and half-quotas at a double dissolution election are as follows:

Unlike the case of a normal half-Senate election, the newly elected Senate, like the House, takes office immediately. The Senate cycle is altered, with the next change of Senate membership scheduled for the third date that falls on 1 July after the election. The senators from each state are divided into two classes: the first class receive three-year terms and the second class receive six-year terms (both of these may be interrupted by another double dissolution). Thus for the Parliament elected in the March 1983 double dissolution election, the next two Senate changeovers would have been due on 1 July 1985 and 1 July 1988, while the term of the new House of Representatives would have expired in 1986. Bob Hawke decided to call a regular federal election for December 1984 after only 18 months in office, to bring the two election cycles back into synchronisation.

=== Allocation of long-term and short-term seats ===
In order to return to the normal arrangement of half the state Senators being contested at each election, following a double dissolution, section 13 of the Australian Constitution requires the senate to divide the state senators into two classes, with three-year and six-year terms. This has traditionally been done by allocating long terms to the senators elected earliest in the count. The 1984 amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act required the Australian Electoral Commission to conduct a notional recount as if only half the seats were to be elected, which was seen as producing a fairer allocation. This alternative allocation has not yet been used. Following double dissolution elections in 1987 and 2016, the order-elected method continued to be used, despite Senate resolutions in 1998 and 2010 agreeing to use the new method.

== South Australian double dissolutions ==
Under section 41 of the South Australian constitution, if a bill is passed by the House of Assembly during a session of Parliament and in the following Parliament after a general election for the lower house is rejected by the Legislative Council on both occasions, it is permitted for the Governor of South Australia to either issue a writ for the election of 2 additional members of the Legislative Council or to dissolve both houses at the same time to elect an entirely new Parliament. As the upper house consists of 22 members, with 11 elected statewide at each general election for an 8-year term at a quota of 8.33%, this would result in an election for all 22 members at a quota of 4.35%.

Although it has been threatened, this South Australian double dissolution procedure has never been used.

<doc id="1336915" wikidata="Q5456090" url="?curid=1336915" title="Five Points, Atlanta">
<text>Five Points is a district of Atlanta, Georgia, United States, the primary reference for the downtown area.

==Description==
The name refers to the convergence of Marietta Street, Edgewood Avenue, Decatur Street, and two legs of Peachtree Street (the south-southwestern leg was originally Whitehall Street, before a section of Whitehall was renamed as an extension of Peachtree Street to give businesses south of Five Points the prestige of a Peachtree Street address). Five Points is usually considered by Atlantans to be the center of town, and it is the origin of the street addressing system for the city and county, although four of the streets (except Edgewood) are rotated at least 30° clockwise from their nominal directions, along with the rest of the downtown street grid.

Woodruff Park is on the northeast corner of the intersection, between Peachtree Street and Edgewood Avenue. The Five Points MARTA station is one block south of the intersection on Peachtree Street.

A large round Coca-Cola sign overlooks Five Points, atop the Olympia Building on the east side of the intersection between Edgewood Avenue and Decatur Avenue. The nearly 50-foot tall sign has a 33-foot lighted neon face and faces up and down Peachtree Street. A lighted portion at the bottom of the sign gives the current time and temperature.

At the other corners of Five Points are located: Woodruff Park (northeast); the William-Oliver Building (northwest); Georgia State University&#x27;s Andrew Young School of Policy Studies (southwest); and a parking garage (southeast). On a triangular island in the intersection stands the George Beasley sculpture Five Points Monument, alluding to the water tower formerly standing on the spot as well as the streetcar tracks that once existed in the intersection.

==History==
Prior to the arrival of white settlers, Five Points was the intersection of two Creek Indian trails, the Peachtree Trail and the Sandtown Trail. In 1845, George Washington Collier opened a grocery store at what is now Five Points, and the store later served as Atlanta&#x27;s first post office in 1846. In 1848, Five Points served as the location of Atlanta&#x27;s first mayoral election. Moses Formwalt became Atlanta&#x27;s first mayor, defeating Jonathan Norcross. In 1875, Atlanta&#x27;s drinking water system began with the construction of three artesian wells at Five Points. The system delivered water to Atlanta&#x27;s residents via wooden pipes.

Until the 1960s, Five Points represented the central hub of Atlanta. With the advent of urban sprawl and the development of shopping malls, the economic and demographic center of Atlanta shifted northward, and Five Points went into decay. By the 21st century, the area was revitalizing, mostly due to the expansion of Georgia State University, which maintains a large footprint in Five Points.

<text>William III de Ferrers, 5th Earl of Derby (c. 1193 – 28 March 1254) of Chartley Castle in Staffordshire, was an English nobleman and major landowner, unable through illness to take much part in national affairs. From his two marriages, he left numerous children who married into noble and royal families of England, France, Scotland and Wales.

==Origins==
He was the son and heir of William de Ferrers, 4th Earl of Derby (c. 1168 – c. 1247), by his wife Agnes de Kevelioc, a daughter of Hugh de Kevelioc, 5th Earl of Chester (by his wife Bertrada de Montfort).

==Career==
In 1230 he accompanied King Henry III to France and attended Parliament in London in the same year. Like his father, he suffered from gout from youth and after the 1230s took little part in public affairs, travelling always in a litter. He was accidentally thrown from his litter into the River Great Ouse while crossing a bridge at St Neots in Huntingdonshire and, although he escaped death, never recovered from the effects of the accident. He succeeded to the title of his father in 1247, but only lived another seven years, dying on 28 March 1254.

==Landholdings==
Unable to play any part at court or at war, he followed his father in managing the family&#x27;s landholdings. Their original lands were centred on Tutbury Castle, stretching beyond Staffordshire into the south of Derbyshire and the west of Nottinghamshire. The death in 1232 of his uncle Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester, brought him vast new estates, including Chartley Castle in Staffordshire, much of Lancashire between the Rivers Ribble and Mersey and many manors in Northamptonshire and Lincolnshire. He continued the policy of encouraging the growth of towns and markets, exploiting the forests of Needwood and Duffield Frith, and taking advantage of rising prices in commodities and land values. By the time of his death his income placed him among the top six English nobles, but he also left his son considerable debts.

==Marriages &amp; issue==
He married twice:

===To Sybil Marshal===
He married (1st) Sibyl Marshal, a daughter of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, by his wife Isabel de Clare, 4th Countess of Pembroke, by whom he had seven daughters: 
*Agnes de Ferrers (d. 11 May 1290), who married (as his second wife) William de Vesci (d.1253);
*Isabel de Ferrers (died before 26 November 1260), who married (1) Gilbert Basset, of Wycombe, and (2) (as his second wife) Reginald II de Mohun, feudal barony of Dunster in Somerset, father-in-law of her sister Joan.
*Maud de Ferrers (died 12 March 1298), who married (1) Simon de Kyme (died 1248), (2) William de Vivonne (died 1259), and (3) Amaury IX, Viscount of Rochechouart.
*Sibyl de Ferrers, who married (as his first wife) Frank de Bohun, of Midhurst, great-nephew of Savaric FitzGeldewin;
*Joan de Ferrers (died 1267) married:
**(1) Sir John de Mohun, master of Dunster (died 1253 in Gascony), with John de Mohun (1248–79), feudal baron of Dunster as probable issue; and
**(2) (as his first wife) Sir Robert II Aguillon of Addington; 
*Agatha de Ferrers (died May 1306), married Hugh Mortimer, younger son of Ralph de Mortimer;
*Eleanor de Ferrers (died 16 October 1274) married (1) William de Vaux, (2) in about 1252 (as his 3rd wife) Roger de Quincy, 2nd Earl of Winchester, and (3) in about 1265 Roger de Leybourne.

===To Margaret de Quincy===

He married (2nd) in 1238 Margaret or Margery de Quincy (c. 1218 - 12 March 1280), daughter and heiress of Roger de Quincy, 2nd Earl of Winchester, by his wife Helen of Galloway. When Margaret&#x27;s father married (as his 3rd wife) Eleanor de Ferrers (d.1274), she became both step-mother and step-daughter of Eleanor. By Margaret de Quincy he had two sons and three daughters: 
*Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby (1239–1279), eldest son and heir, who married firstly (aged 10) Mary de Lusignan, a daughter of Hugh XI de Lusignan, Count of Angoulême, and a niece of King Henry III. He married (2nd) in 1269 Eleanor de Bohun, daughter of Sir Humphrey V de Bohun, of Kimbolton Castle, by his wife Eleanor de Braose.
*William de Ferrers (1240–1287), of Groby in Leicestershire, younger son, who having been granted by his mother Groby Castle, founded the junior line of Ferrers of Groby. He married firstly Anne Durward, possibly the widow of Colbán, Earl of Fife and a daughter of Alan Durward, by whom he had issue:
**William Ferrers, 1st Baron Ferrers of Groby (1272–1325), who assumed the arms of de Quincy (&quot;Gules, seven mascles or conjoined 3:3:1&quot;) in lieu of his paternal arms;
:He married (2nd) Eleanor de Lovaine, a daughter of Matthew de Lovaine, who after her husband&#x27;s death was abducted by and married to William the Hardy, Lord of Douglas.
*Joan de Ferrers (died 19 March 1309), who married Thomas de Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Berkeley Castle in Gloucestershire;
*Agnes de Ferrers, who married (1) Sir Robert de Musgrove, of Kemerton, Boddington &amp; Deerhurst (2) John FitzReginald.
*Elizabeth de Ferrers, who married (1) William Marshal, killed at the Battle of Evesham in 1265 (2) Dafydd ap Gruffydd, a prince of Gwynedd.

==Death, burial &amp; succession==
He died on 28 March 1254 and was buried in Merevale Abbey, Warwickshire. He was succeeded by his 15-year-old eldest son Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby (1239–1279), still a minor, who in 1249 aged 10 had been married to Mary de Lusignan, a niece of King Henry III, and knighted. His wardship was granted to the King&#x27;s eldest son, the future King Edward I. William&#x27;s first wife&#x27;s great estates in Ireland (primarily the county of Kildare) passed to her seven daughters and their heirs.

<doc id="1336919" wikidata="Q2034436" url="?curid=1336919" title="Osmotic diuretic">
<text>An osmotic diuretic is a type of diuretic that inhibits reabsorption of water and sodium (Na). They are pharmacologically inert substances that are given intravenously. They increase the osmolarity of blood and renal filtrate. This fluid eventually becomes urine.

Two examples are mannitol and isosorbide.

In the nephron, osmotic diuretics act at the portions of the nephron that are water-permeable.

Osmotic diuretics work by expanding extracellular fluid and plasma volume, therefore increasing blood flow to the kidney. This washes out the cortical medullary gradient in the kidney. This stops the loop of Henle from concentrating urine, which usually uses the high osmotic and solute gradient to transport solutes and water.

These agents can also act at other parts of the body. For example, they can be used to reduce intracranial and intra-ocular pressure. Osmotic diuretics increase plasma volume, but because they do not cross the blood-brain barrier, this does not affect the nervous system. In effect, this is the cause of their action reducing locally the plasma volume in the nervous system.

== Mechanism of action ==

Osmotic diuretics have their major effect in the proximal convoluted tubule and the descending limb of the Loop of Henle. These sites are freely permeable to water. Through osmotic effects, they also oppose the action of ADH in the collecting tubule. The presence of a nonreabsorbable solute such as mannitol prevents the normal absorption of water by interposing a countervailing osmotic force. As a result, urine volume increases.

The increase in urine flow rate decreases the contact time between fluid and the tubular epithelium, thus reducing sodium as well as water reabsorption. The resulting natriuresis is of lesser magnitude than the water diuresis, leading eventually to excessive water loss and hypernatremia.

Any osmotically active agent that is filtered by the glomerulus but not reabsorbed causes water to be retained in these segments and promotes a water diuresis. Such agents can be used to reduce intracranial pressure and to promote prompt removal of renal toxins. The prototypical osmotic diuretic is mannitol.

Mannitol lowers the intra cranial pressure through two effects in the brain. The first, rheological effect, reduces blood viscosity, and promotes plasma expansion and cerebral oxygen delivery. In response, cerebral vasoconstriction occurs due to autoregulation, and cerebral blood volume is decreased. The second effect occurs through creation of an osmotic gradient across the blood-brain barrier, leading to the movement of water from the parenchyma to the intravascular space. Brain tissue volume is decreased and, therefore, ICP is lowered.

<doc id="1336923" wikidata="Q32762" url="?curid=1336923" title="Võro language">
<text>Võro ( ; , ) is a South Estonian language. 
It has its own literary standard and efforts have been undertaken to seek official recognition as an indigenous regional language of Estonia. Võro has roughly 75,000 speakers (Võros), mostly in southeastern Estonia, in the eight parishes of the historical Võru County: Karula, Harglõ, Urvastõ, Rõugõ, Kanepi, Põlva, Räpinä and Vahtsõliina. These parishes are currently centred (due to redistricting) in Võru and Põlva counties, with parts extending into Valga and Tartu counties. Speakers can also be found in the cities of Tallinn and Tartu and the rest of Estonia.

==History==

Võro is a descendant of the old South Estonian regional language and is the least influenced by Standard Estonian (which is based on Northern Estonian dialects). Võro was once spoken further south and east of historical Võromaa in South Estonian-speaking enclaves Lutsi (Ludza), Leivu and Kraasna in what is now Latvia and Russia. In addition to Võro, other contemporary South Estonian languages are Mulgi, Tartu and Seto.

One of the earliest written evidences of South Estonian is a translation of the New Testament (&quot;Wastne Testament&quot;) published in 1686. Although the status of South Estonian began to diminish after the 1880s, the language began to undergo a revival in the late 1980s.

==Present situation==
Today, Võro is used in the works of some of Estonia&#x27;s best-known playwrights, poets, and authors (Madis Kõiv, Ülle Kauksi, Jaan Kaplinski, Ain Kaalep, etc.). One newspaper is printed in Võro: the fortnightly &quot;Uma Leht&quot; (literally &quot;Our Own Newspaper&quot;). Twenty six public schools offer weekly special classes (mostly extracurricular) in modern Võro.

Estonia&#x27;s contribution to the Eurovision Song Contest 2004 was the song &quot;Tii&quot;, which was performed by Neiokõsõ in Võro.

The language is endangered, and according to Kadri Koreinik this is due to the government&#x27;s lack of legal commitment to protect the language.

==Orthography==

Võro employs the Latin script, like Estonian and Finnish.

Most letters (including &quot;ä&quot;, &quot;ö&quot;, &quot;ü&quot;, and &quot;õ&quot;) denote the same sounds as in Estonian, with a few exceptions. The letter &quot;q&quot; stands for the glottal stop and &quot;y&quot; denotes , a vowel very close to Russian &quot;ы&quot; (from 2005 written &quot;õ&quot;).

Palatalization of consonants is marked with an acute accent (´) or apostrophe (ʼ). In proper typography and in handwriting, the palatalization mark does not extend above the cap height (except uppercase letters &quot;Ń&quot;, &quot;Ŕ&quot;, &quot;Ś&quot;, &quot;V́&quot; etc.), and it is written above the letter if the letter has no ascender (&quot;ǵ&quot;, &quot;ḿ&quot;, &quot;ń&quot;, &quot;ṕ&quot;, &quot;ŕ&quot;, &quot;ś&quot;, &quot;v́&quot; etc.) but written to the right of it otherwise (&quot;bʼ&quot;, &quot;dʼ&quot;, &quot;fʼ&quot;, &quot;hʼ&quot;, &quot;kʼ&quot;, &quot;lʼ&quot;, &quot;tʼ&quot;). In some sources, an apostrophe is placed after the letter in all cases.

==Phonology==
===Vowels===
====Vowel harmony====

Võro has preserved the system of vowel harmony that was present in Proto-Finnic. This distinguishes it from Estonian and some other Finnic languages, which have lost it.

The vowel harmony system distinguishes front, back and neutral vowels, much like the system found in Finnish. A word cannot contain both front and back vowels; suffixes automatically adapt the backness of the vowels depending on the type of vowels found in the word it is attached to. Neutral vowels can be combined with either type of vowel, although a word that contains only neutral vowels has front vowel harmony. The only neutral vowel is &quot;i&quot;, like in Votic but unlike Finnish and Karelian, where &quot;e&quot; is also neutral.

*The vowel &quot;ɨ&quot; (in the Võro orthography written with &quot;õ&quot; or &quot;y&quot;, see Orthography section) is considered a back vowel for harmony purposes, but does not participate in harmony itself, as it does not occur in suffixes and endings.

Some examples, with Estonian and Finnish included for comparison:

===Consonants===
All Võro consonants (except and ) can be palatalized. The glottal stop (q, IPA ) is a very common sound in Võro.

==Grammar==

===Nouns===

Endings are shown only in the back vowel harmony variant. The &quot;e&quot; of the illative ending does not undergo vowel harmony, so it never changes to &quot;õ&quot;.

Only the more common endings are shown. There are some unusual/irregular endings that are only found in a few words or word types.

Notes:
* The accusative is not usually considered a separate case in Võro grammars, as it is always identical to either the nominative or the genitive.
* When an ending beginning with &quot;d&quot; is attached to a stem ending in an obstruent, it is devoiced to &quot;t&quot; automatically.

===Verbs===

The 3rd person singular of the indicative mood can be either without an ending or, alternatively, with an &quot;s&quot;-ending:
Among the Finnic languages, such double verb conjugation can be found only in the South Estonian and Karelian languages.

====Negation====

Võro has a negative particle that is appended to the end of the verb, whereas standard Estonian and Finnish have a negative verb, which precedes the verb. In Estonian and Finnish, the negative verb &quot;ei&quot; (Finnish &quot;en/et/ei/emme/ette/eivät&quot;) is used in both present and past negation, whereas in Võro the same is expressed by different particles ending with &quot;-i(q)&quot; or &quot;-s&quot;:

<text>Arthur Owen Jones (16 August 1872 – 21 December 1914) was an English cricketer, noted as an all-rounder, and former Captain of England. He was also a rugby union player for Leicester at full back or three quarter.

==Early life==

Jones was born in 1872 in Shelton, Nottinghamshire, and educated at Bedford Modern School and Jesus College, Cambridge.

==Cricket career==

Jones played for Cambridge University, Nottinghamshire, London County and England. He was named Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1900.

Jones was the first substitute to keep wicket in a Test match, when he did so against Australia at The Oval in 1905. He was a brilliant, sometimes impetuous, opening batsman and a leg-break and googly bowler. In 1903 he made what was then the highest-ever score by a Nottinghamshire batsman, scoring an unbeaten 296 against Gloucestershire at Trent Bridge, Nottingham. Jones played 12 Test matches for England, but lost the two games he captained. He led Nottinghamshire to the County Championship in 1907 and was captain of the 1907/08 England tour to Australia. But he only appeared in two matches because of illness. He remained captain of Nottinghamshire until a few months before his death from tuberculosis, in Dunstable, Bedfordshire.

==Rugby career==

Jones made 15 appearances for Bedford between 1889 and 1895 before moving to Leicester Tigers in 1895. He was appointed captain between 1896 and 1899 and then again between 1902 and 1904. He was club captain when Tigers secured their first piece silverware, the Midlands Counties Cup, though missed the final through injury. He was captain in the victorious finals of 1899, 1903 and 1904 and played in the victorious final of 1900 and 1901. He became the first player to pass 500 points for the club against Moseley in 1903.

Between 1906 and 1912 he refereed 5 rugby internationals, including France&#x27;s first test victory against Scotland in 1911.

<text>Da&#x27;i Bachtiar (born 25 January 1950) is an Indonesian police officer who was Chief of the Indonesian National Police from November 2001 to July 2005.

On 15 October 2002, he announced that Indonesian investigators at the scene of the Bali bombings had recovered traces of C-4 plastic explosives. It is rumoured that there was rivalry between Bachtiar and intelligence chief Hendropriyono. In November 2002, after Amrozi had been arrested, Bachtiar had a face-to-face meeting with him. Bachtiar laughed, shook hands and posed for photographs with Amrozi.

Currently Bachtiar holds positions as a Professor of Security &amp; Counter-Terrorism at Edith Cowan University and Presidium Chairman of Indonesia Crime Prevention Foundation.

<text>John Hardyng (or Harding; 1378–1465) was an English chronicler. He was born in Northern England.

==Biography==
As a boy Hardyng entered the service of Sir Henry Percy (Hotspur), with whom he was present at the Battle of Shrewsbury (1403). He then passed into the service of Sir Robert Umfraville, under whom he was constable of Warkworth Castle, Northumberland, and Kyme Castle, Lincolnshire. He was in Umfraville&#x27;s retinue at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415 and in the sea-fight before Harfleur in 1416.

In 1424 Hardyng was at Rome, where at the instance of Cardinal Beaufort he consulted the chronicle of Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus. Upon the death of Umfraville in 1436, Hardyng retired to the Augustinian Priory at Kyme, where he wrote the two versions of his chronicle and where he probably lived until his death about 1465. Hardyng was a man of antiquarian knowledge, and under Henry V was employed to investigate the feudal relations of Scotland to the English crown. For this purpose he visited Scotland. By his own account, he spent three and a half years mapping the terrain and securing documents related to English sovereignty. Later, he would incorporate material from his Scottish mission, most notably the first independent map of Scotland, into a history of Britain written for Henry V&#x27;s son.

For his services he says that Henry V promised Hardyng the manor of Geddington in Northamptonshire. Many years after, in 1440, he had a grant of £10 a year for similar services. In 1457 there is a record of the delivery of documents relating to Scotland by Hardyng to the earl of Shrewsbury, and his reward by a further pension of £20.
It is clear that Hardyng was well acquainted with Scotland, and James I is said to have offered him a bribe to surrender his papers. But most of the documents, which are still preserved in the Record Office, have been shown to be forgeries, and were probably manufactured by Hardyng himself.

Hardyng spent many years on the composition of a rhyming chronicle of England. His services under the Percies and Umfraville&#x27;s gave him opportunity to obtain much information of value for fifteenth century history. It was written and rewritten to suit his various patrons. The original edition ending in 1437 had a Lancastrian bias and was dedicated to Henry VI and his family. Afterwards he began preparing a version for Richard, Duke of York, and continued the chronicle for Richard&#x27;s son, Edward IV. A reference to Edward&#x27;s wife, Elizabeth Woodville, in the prologue indicates that Hardyng was still working on his second version in 1464.

==Versions==
The first version is preserved in Lansdowne manuscript 204 in the British Library, and the best of the later versions in Oxford, Bodleian Library, Arch. Selden B. 10. Richard Grafton printed two editions in January 1543 and Stow, who was acquainted with a different version, censured Grafton on this point somewhat unjustly. Sir Henry Ellis published the longer version of Grafton with some additions from the Selden and Harley manuscripts in 1812. Professors Sarah Peverley and James Simpson have edited the first chronicles, and Peverley is editing the second version.

<text>Ronald is a masculine given name derived from the Old Norse &quot;Rögnvaldr&quot;, or possibly from Old English &quot;Regenweald&quot;. In some cases &quot;Ronald&quot; is an Anglicised form of the Gaelic &quot;Raghnall&quot;, a name likewise derived from &quot;Rögnvaldr&quot;. The latter name is composed of the Old Norse elements &quot;regin&quot; (&quot;advice&quot;, &quot;decision&quot;) and &quot;valdr&quot; (&quot;ruler&quot;). &quot;Ronald&quot; was originally used in England and Scotland, where Scandinavian influences were once substantial, although now the name is common throughout the English-speaking world. A short form of &quot;Ronald&quot; is &quot;Ron&quot;. Pet forms of &quot;Ronald&quot; include &quot;Roni&quot; and &quot;Ronnie&quot;. &quot;Ronalda&quot; and &quot;Rhonda&quot; are feminine forms of &quot;Ronald&quot;. &quot;Rhona&quot;, a modern name apparently only dating back to the late nineteenth century, may have originated as a feminine form of &quot;Ronald&quot;. The names &quot;Renaud&quot;/&quot;Renault&quot; and &quot;Reynold&quot;/&quot;Reinhold&quot; are cognates from French and German respectively. The name &quot;Ronaldo&quot; is a cognate from Spanish and Portuguese.

<doc id="1336960" wikidata="Q2737027" url="?curid=1336960" title="Failure rate">
<text>Failure rate is the frequency with which any system or component fails, expressed in failures per unit of time. It thus depends on the system conditions, time interval, and total number of systems under study.
It can describe electronic, mechanical, or biological systems, in fields such as systems and reliability engineering, medicine and biology, or insurance and finance. It is usually denoted by the Greek letter formula_1 (lambda).

In real-world applications, the failure probability of a system usually differs over time; failures occur more frequently in early-life (&quot;burning in&quot;), or as a system ages (&quot;wearing out&quot;). This is known as the bathtub curve, where the middle region is called the &quot;useful life period&quot;.

== Mean time between failures (MTBF) ==

The mean time between failures (MTBF, formula_2) is often reported instead of the failure rate, as numbers such as &quot;2,000 hours&quot; are more intuitive than numbers such as &quot;0.0005 per hour&quot;.

However, this is only valid if the failure rate formula_3 is actually constant over time, such as within the flat region of the bathtub curve. In many cases where MTBF is quoted, it refers only to this region; thus it cannot be used to give an accurate calculation of the average lifetime of a system, as it ignores the &quot;burn-in&quot; and &quot;wear-out&quot; regions.

MTBF appears frequently in engineering design requirements, and governs the frequency of required system maintenance and inspections. A similar ratio used in the transport industries, especially in railways and trucking, is &quot;mean distance between failures&quot; - allowing maintenance to be scheduled based on distance travelled, rather than at regular time intervals.

==Mathematical definition==

The simplest definition of failure rate formula_1 is simply the number of failures formula_5 per time interval formula_6:

:formula_7

which would depend on the number of systems under study, and the conditions over the time period.

===Failures over time===

To accurately model failures over time, a cumulative failure distribution, formula_8 must be defined, which can be any cumulative distribution function (CDF) that gradually increases from formula_9 to formula_10. In the case of many identical systems, this may be thought of as the fraction of systems failing over time formula_11, after all starting operation at time formula_12; or in the case of a single system, as the probability of the system having its failure time formula_13 before time formula_11:

:formula_15

As CDFs are defined by integrating a probability density function, the failure probability density formula_16 is defined such that: 

:formula_17

where formula_18 is a dummy integration variable. Here formula_16 can be thought of as the &quot;instantaneous failure rate&quot;, i.e. the fraction of failures per unit time, as the size of the time interval formula_6 tends towards formula_9.

===Hazard rate===

A concept closely-related but different to instantaneous failure rate formula_16 is the hazard rate (or ), formula_23.

In the many-system case, this is defined as the proportional failure rate of the systems &quot;still functioning&quot; at time formula_11 (as opposed to formula_16, which is the expressed as a proportion of the &quot;initial number&quot; of systems). 

For convenience we first define the reliability (or survival function) as:

:formula_26

then the hazard rate is simply the instantaneous failure rate, scaled by the fraction of surviving systems at time formula_11:

:formula_28

In the probabilistic sense, for a single system this can be interpreted as the conditional probability of failure time formula_13 within the time interval formula_11 to formula_31, &quot;given that the system or component has already survived to time formula_11&quot;:

:formula_33

====Conversion to cumulative failure rate====

To convert between formula_23 and formula_8, we can solve the differential equation

:formula_36

with initial condition formula_37, which yields

:formula_38

Thus for a collection of identical systems, only one of hazard rate formula_23, failure probability density formula_16, or cumulative failure distribution formula_8 need be defined.

Confusion can occur as the notation formula_3 for &quot;failure rate&quot; often refers to the function formula_23 rather than formula_44

===Constant hazard rate model===

There are many possible functions that could be chosen to represent failure probability density formula_16 or hazard rate formula_23, based on empirical or theoretical evidence, but the most common and easily-understandable choice is to set

:formula_47,

an exponential function with scaling constant formula_1. As seen in the figures above, this represents a gradually decreasing failure probability density.

The CDF formula_8 is then calculated as: 

:formula_50

which can be seen to gradually approach formula_10 as formula_52 representing the fact that eventually all systems under study will fail.

The hazard rate function is then:

:formula_53

In other words, in this particular case &quot;only&quot;, the hazard rate is constant over time.

This illustrates the difference in hazard rate and failure probability density - as the number of systems surviving at time formula_54 gradually reduces, the total failure rate also reduces, but the hazard rate remains constant. In other words, the probabilities of each individual system failing do not change over time as the systems age - they are &quot;memory-less&quot;.

===Other models===

For many systems, a constant hazard function may not be a realistic approximation; the chance of failure of an individual component may depend on its age. Therefore, other distributions are often used.

For example, the deterministic distribution increases hazard rate over time (for systems where wear-out is the most important factor), while the Pareto distribution decreases it (for systems where early-life failures are more common). The commonly-used Weibull distribution combines both of these effects, as do the log-normal and hypertabastic distributions.

After modelling a given distribution and parameters for formula_23, the failure probability density formula_16 and cumulative failure distribution formula_8 can be predicted using the given equations.

==Measuring failure rate==
Failure rate data can be obtained in several ways. The most common means are:
;Estimation:From field failure rate reports, statistical analysis techniques can be used to estimate failure rates. For accurate failure rates the analyst must have a good understanding of equipment operation, procedures for data collection, the key environmental variables impacting failure rates, how the equipment is used at the system level, and how the failure data will be used by system designers.
;Historical data about the device or system under consideration: Many organizations maintain internal databases of failure information on the devices or systems that they produce, which can be used to calculate failure rates for those devices or systems. For new devices or systems, the historical data for similar devices or systems can serve as a useful estimate.
;Government and commercial failure rate data: Handbooks of failure rate data for various components are available from government and commercial sources. MIL-HDBK-217F, &quot;Reliability Prediction of Electronic Equipment&quot;, is a military standard that provides failure rate data for many military electronic components. Several failure rate data sources are available commercially that focus on commercial components, including some non-electronic components.
;Prediction: Time lag is one of the serious drawbacks of all failure rate estimations. Often by the time the failure rate data are available, the devices under study have become obsolete. Due to this drawback, failure-rate prediction methods have been developed. These methods may be used on newly designed devices to predict the device&#x27;s failure rates and failure modes. Two approaches have become well known, Cycle Testing and FMEDA.
; Life Testing: The most accurate source of data is to test samples of the actual devices or systems in order to generate failure data. This is often prohibitively expensive or impractical, so that the previous data sources are often used instead.
;Cycle Testing: Mechanical movement is the predominant failure mechanism causing mechanical and electromechanical devices to wear out. For many devices, the wear-out failure point is measured by the number of cycles performed before the device fails, and can be discovered by cycle testing. In cycle testing, a device is cycled as rapidly as practical until it fails. When a collection of these devices are tested, the test will run until 10% of the units fail dangerously. 
;FMEDA: Failure modes, effects, and diagnostic analysis (FMEDA) is a systematic analysis technique to obtain subsystem / product level failure rates, failure modes and design strength. The FMEDA technique considers:
* All components of a design,
* The functionality of each component, 
* The failure modes of each component,
* The effect of each component failure mode on the product functionality,
* The ability of any automatic diagnostics to detect the failure,
* The design strength (de-rating, safety factors) and
* The operational profile (environmental stress factors).
Given a component database calibrated with field failure data that is reasonably accurate, the method can predict product level failure rate and failure mode data for a given application. The predictions have been shown to be more accurate than field warranty return analysis or even typical field failure analysis given that these methods depend on reports that typically do not have sufficient detail information in failure records.

==Examples==

===Decreasing failure rates===

A decreasing failure rate describes cases where early-life failures are common and corresponds to the situation where formula_23 is a decreasing function.

This can describe, for example, the period of infant mortality in humans, or the early failure of a transistors due to manufacturing defects.

Decreasing failure rates have been found in the lifetimes of spacecraft - Baker and Baker commenting that &quot;those spacecraft that last, last on and on.&quot;

The hazard rate of aircraft air conditioning systems was found to have an exponentially decreasing distribution.

===Renewal processes===

In special processes called renewal processes, where the time to recover from failure can be neglected, the likelihood of failure remains constant with respect to time.

For a renewal process with DFR renewal function, inter-renewal times are concave. Brown conjectured the converse, that DFR is also necessary for the inter-renewal times to be concave, however it has been shown that this conjecture holds neither in the discrete case nor in the continuous case.

===Coefficient of variation===

When the failure rate is decreasing the coefficient of variation is ⩾ 1, and when the failure rate is increasing the coefficient of variation is ⩽ 1. Note that this result only holds when the failure rate is defined for all t ⩾ 0 and that the converse result (coefficient of variation determining nature of failure rate) does not hold.

===Units===
Failure rates can be expressed using any measure of time, but hours is the most common unit in practice. Other units, such as miles, revolutions, etc., can also be used in place of &quot;time&quot; units.

Failure rates are often expressed in engineering notation as failures per million, or 10−6, especially for individual components, since their failure rates are often very low.

The Failures In Time (FIT) rate of a device is the number of failures that can be expected in one billion (109) device-hours of operation
(e.g. 1,000 devices for 1,000,000 hours, or 1,000,000 devices for 1,000 hours each, or some other combination). This term is used particularly by the semiconductor industry.

===Combinations of failure types===

If a complex system consists of many parts, and the failure of any single part means the failure of the entire system, then the total failure rate is simply the sum of the individual failure rates of its parts

:formula_59

however, this assumes that the failure rate formula_3 is constant, and that the units are consistent (e.g. failures per million hours), and not expressed as a ratio or as probability densities. This is useful to estimate the failure rate of a system when individual components or subsystems have already been tested.

Adding &quot;redundant&quot; components to eliminate a single point of failure may thus actually increase the failure rate, however reduces the &quot;mission failure&quot; rate, or the &quot;mean time between critical failures&quot; (MTBCF).

Combining failure or hazard rates that are time-dependent is more complicated. For example, mixtures of Decreasing Failure Rate (DFR) variables are also DFR. Mixtures of exponentially distributed failure rates are hyperexponentially distributed.

===Simple example===
Suppose it is desired to estimate the failure rate of a certain component. Ten identical components are each tested until they either fail or reach 1,000 hours, at which time the test is terminated. A total of 7,502 component-hours of testing is performed, and 6 failures are recorded.

The &quot;estimated&quot; failure rate is:

: formula_61

which could also be expressed as a MTBF of 1,250 hours, or approximately 800 failures for every million hours of operation.

<doc id="1336987" wikidata="Q444685" url="?curid=1336987" title="Joan Burton">
<text>Joan Burton (born 1 February 1949) is an Irish former Labour Party politician who served as Tánaiste and Leader of the Labour Party from 2014 to 2016, Minister for Social Protection from 2011 to 2016, Deputy leader of the Labour Party from 2007 to 2014, Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs from 1994 to 1997 and Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare from 1993 to 1994. She served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dublin West constituency from 1992 to 1997 and 2002 to 2020.

Burton was first elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1992 general election. From 1995 to 1997, she was Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs. She lost her seat at the 1997 general election but was re-elected to the Dáil at the 2002 general election. She was deputy leader of the Labour Party under Eamon Gilmore, between 2007 and 2014. She was Tánaiste (Deputy Prime Minister) from 2014 to 2016 and Minister for Social Protection from 2011 to 2016. She resigned as Labour Party leader in May 2016, following heavy losses by the party in the 2016 general election. Burton lost her seat in the 2020 general election on the 5th count.

==Early life==
Burton is a native of the Stoneybatter area of Dublin. She was adopted by the Burton family as a baby and was brought up in Inchicore. Her adoptive father worked in the local iron foundry. She was educated at St. Gabriel&#x27;s NS, Cowper Street St. Joseph Sisters of Charity Secondary School, Stanhope Street and University College Dublin (UCD), where she graduated with a degree in commerce. She is also a fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants. She has worked as a lecturer in Accountancy at the Dublin Institute of Technology and the University of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

==Political career==
===Early years: 1989–1997===
Burton first stood for election at the 1989 general election, as one of two Labour Party candidates in the Dublin Central constituency; she failed to be elected. At the local elections in 1991, she was elected to Dublin County Council for the Mulhuddart local electoral area.

Burton was first elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1992 general election as a Labour Party TD for the Dublin West constituency in the 27th Dáil. She was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare in the Fianna Fáil–Labour Party coalition that was formed after that election, with responsibility for Poverty. With the breakdown of that coalition and the establishment of a Rainbow Coalition of Fine Gael-Labour-Democratic Left in early 1995, she became Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, a position she held until the coalition&#x27;s defeat at the 1997 general election.

===Loss of seat and re-election: 1997–2007===
She lost her seat at the 1997 general election, to Joe Higgins of the Socialist Party. Burton was re-elected to Fingal County Council in the 1999 local elections, on this occasion winning a seat in the Castleknock local electoral area. She was re-elected to the Dáil for Dublin West at the 2002 general election. She was then appointed Labour Party Spokesperson for Finance. She was a candidate for the deputy leadership of the party in 2002, obtaining 24% of the first preference vote, but was unsuccessful. From 1997 to 2002 she had returned to lecturing.

===Labour Deputy leadership: 2007–2014===
Burton became deputy leader of the Labour Party in September 2007. She was re-elected to represent Dublin West at the 2011 general election, topping the poll on the 1st count with 9,627 votes, and was the first TD in the country to be elected to the 31st Dáil.

===Labour Leadership: 2014–2016===
Labour polled badly at the 2014 local and European elections; this led to the resignation of Eamon Gilmore as leader. Burton announced her candidacy for the leadership to replace him. On 4 July 2014, she won the leadership election, defeating Alex White by 78% to 22%. Taoiseach Enda Kenny, appointed her as Tánaiste on the same day. Upon her election she said that the Labour Party &quot;would focus on social repair, and govern more with the heart&quot;. She became the first woman to lead the Labour Party.

On 11 July 2014, Burton announced the Labour Party cabinet ministers, with party deputy leader Alan Kelly appointed as Minister for the Environment, Alex White as Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Jan O&#x27;Sullivan as Minister for Education and Skills and Gerald Nash as Minister of State for Business and Employment and Brendan Howlin remaining as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. Burton also remained in her ministry at the Department of Social Protection. During her term as leader and Tánaiste, her contribution was key to preventing the sell-off of State assets, protecting core welfare payments and increasing the minimum wage twice.

Despite a Millward Browne poll that predicted she would lose her constituency seat a month before the 2016 general election, Burton polled better than expected and retained her Dublin West seat.

At the Women in Media conference that took place in April 2016, following elections and during negotiations to form a governing coalition, Burton discussed how women were excluded from the government negotiation process. She criticized what she called the misogyny and abuse female politicians faced during the election, as well as the &quot;vulgar, crude, and demeaning&quot; &quot;Late Late Show&quot; broadcast during the election that offered Freudian interpretations of politicians&#x27; body language.

The Labour Party returned to opposition following the 2016 general election, in greatly reduced numbers. Burton remained as Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection in an acting capacity during prolonged talks on government formation. On 6 May 2016, Enda Kenny announced in the Dáil that Frances Fitzgerald would be the new Tánaiste, while Burton&#x27;s constituency colleague Leo Varadkar took her old job in the Department of Social Protection.

On 10 May 2016, she announced her resignation as Labour Party leader, which took effect on 20 May 2016, when her replacement Brendan Howlin was chosen unopposed.

She lost her seat at the 2020 Irish general election, with her first preference vote declining from 15.4% to 4.8%.

<text>Lieutenant General Sir Edward Bruce Hamley (27 April 182412 August 1893) was a British general and military writer and a Conservative politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1885 to 1892.

==Early life==
Hamley was the youngest son of Vice-Admiral William Hamley, born at Bodmin, Cornwall, and entered the Royal Artillery in 1843.

==Career==
Hamley was promoted captain in 1850, and in 1851 went to Gibraltar, where he began his literary career by contributing articles to magazines. He served throughout the Crimean campaign as &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to Sir Richard Dacres, commanding the artillery, taking part in all the operations with distinction, and becoming successively major and lieutenant-colonel by brevet. He also received the CB and French and Turkish orders.

During the war Hamley contributed to &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; an admirable account of the progress of the campaign, which was afterwards republished. The combination in Hamley of literary and military ability secured for him in 1859 the professorship of military history at the new Staff College at Sandhurst, from which in 1866 he went to the council of military education, returning in 1870 to the Staff College as commandant.

From 1879 to 1881 Hamley was British commissioner successively for the delimitation of the frontiers of the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria, Ottoman Empire in Asia and the Russian Empire, and Ottoman Empire and Greece, and was rewarded with the KCMG. Promoted colonel in 1863, he became a lieutenant-general in 1882, when he commanded the 2nd Division of the expedition to Egypt under Lord Wolseley, and led his troops in the Battle of Tell El Kebir, for which he received the KCB, the thanks of Parliament, and 2nd class of the Order of Osmanieh.

Hamley considered that his services in Egypt had been insufficiently recognised in Lord Wolseley&#x27;s despatches, and expressed his indignation freely, but he had no sufficient ground for supposing that there was any intention to belittle his services.

==Later life==
From 1885 until 1892, Hamley was Member of Parliament for Birkenhead in parliament in the Conservative interest. He was promoted to general in 1890. He was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 2nd Middlesex Artillery Volunteers on 6 November 1887. Hamley is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.

==Writings==
Hamley was a clever and versatile writer. His principal work, &quot;The Operations of War&quot;, published in 1866, became a text-book of military instruction. It was praised by the German General Helmuth von Moltke, Chief of the Prussian General Staff, and until 1894 it was the sole text used in the entrance examination for the Camberley Staff College. He also published some pamphlets on national defence, was a frequent contributor to magazines, and the author of several novels, of which perhaps the best known is &quot;Lady Lee&#x27;s Widowhood&quot;.

Hamley took interest in animal welfare. He authored &quot;Our Poor Relations&quot;, in 1872. The book reflected his compassion for animals and his horror of their abuse. He attacked vivisection and condemned the collecting of moths.

&quot;The War in the Crimea&quot; was published in 1891 by Seeley and Co., London. Within this publication, was a complete overview of events leading up to the war in the Crimea all the way through to the close of the war.
