<text>The Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPDC), more commonly known locally as the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD), and, colloquially, DC Police, is the primary law enforcement agency for the District of Columbia, in the United States. With approximately 3,400 officers and 600 civilian staff, it is the sixth-largest municipal police department in the United States. The department serves an area of and a population of over 700,000 people. Established on August 6, 1861, the MPD is one of the oldest police departments in the United States. The MPD headquarters was formerly located at the Henry J. Daly Building, located at 300 Indiana Avenue NW in Judiciary Square across the street from the District of Columbia Court of Appeals and the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, however in 2023 MPD moved into One Judiciary Square located at 441 4th St NW while the Daly Building undergoes extensive renovation and refurbishment. The department&#x27;s mission is to &quot;safeguard the District of Columbia and protect its residents and visitors with the highest regard for the sanctity of human life&quot;. The MPD&#x27;s regulations are compiled in title 5, chapter 1 of the District of Columbia Code.

The MPD has a broad array of specialized services, including the Emergency Response Team, K9, harbor patrol, air support, explosive ordnance division, homeland security, criminal intelligence, narcotics, and the violent crime suppression units. The MPD also operates the Command Information Center (CIC) which monitors hundreds of cameras across the city, license plate readers, ShotSpotter, and many other intelligence and surveillance devices.

The MPD has a unique role in that it serves as a local police department, with county, state and federal responsibilities, and is under a municipal government but operates under federal authority. They are responsible for operating the district&#x27;s sex offender registry, approving all applications for motorcades, protests, demonstrations and other public events, and maintaining the district&#x27;s firearm registry.

== Duties ==
While the MPD is the primary law enforcement agency in the city, it shares its jurisdiction with the Transit Police, responsible for policing the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Metrorail and Metrobus systems; the United States Park Police, which provides law enforcement for the National Mall and all other National Park Service properties; the United States Marshals Service, which acts as the city&#x27;s sheriff; and many other federal agencies. However, the MPD ultimately remains the primary agency in the city and has the authority to investigate all crimes in the city regardless of the location it took place.

Under the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, whenever the President of the United States determines that special conditions of an emergency nature exist which require the use of the Metropolitan Police for federal purposes, the president may direct the mayor to provide, and the mayor shall provide, such services of the Metropolitan Police force for up to 48 hours. During longer periods of time, the president must provide to Congress in writing his or her reasons for continuing control of the MPD. This control can be extended at any time beyond 30 days if either the emergency continues or if Congress passes a law ordering it. During this nature of emergency, the MPD is considered a federal law enforcement agency.

==History==

===19th century===
As the American Civil War raged on, U.S. president Abraham Lincoln took a personal interest in the formation of a regular police force for the U.S. capital. Washington had quickly filled with soldiers, government employees, and citizens hoping to cash in on the war. The crowds, crime, and the constant threat of enemy spies, had made the capital into a rowdy city barely under control. After the formation of the Metropolitan Police and its governing Board of Commissioners by Act of Congress, signed into law by Lincoln on August 6, 1861, Lincoln dispatched a member of the board to study the New York City Police Department and its structure.

The Metropolitan Police replaced previous law enforcement organizations. Before the formation of the district in 1801, county constables had jurisdiction over the area, along with the comparatively developed police force for the City of Alexandria. Within the City of Washington, the first police superintendent was named in 1803, and the city divided into four policing wards, each under a constable, in 1804. Yet another force, the 16-member Auxiliary Guard of the City of Washington, was established by Act of Congress in August 1842, purportedly because President John Tyler had been burned in effigy, and had rocks thrown at him on the White House grounds. The formation of the Metropolitan Police dissolved all these previous authorities. (The Militia of the District of Columbia was created in the Assumption Act of May 3, 1802, active as peacekeepers within the district but tasked with defending the federal government, and commanded directly by the president as a military force, not law enforcement.)

The Metropolitan Police Board unanimously chose one of its members, William Benning Webb, who was commissioned as a major in the army, to serve as the first chief of police, the formal title being &quot;Major and Superintendent&quot;. The Police Board initially divided the district into 10 precincts. The First Precinct constituted the portion of Washington County east of the Anacostia River, while the Second Precinct included the county territory north of Washington City and between the Anacostia and Rock Creek. The Third Precinct comprised the remainder of Washington County west of Rock Creek, including Georgetown and the island of Analostan in the Potomac River. The Fourth through Tenth precincts corresponded respectively with the First through Seventh wards of Washington City. Beginning immediately, Superintendent Webb worked to organize the department which had an authorized strength of ten sergeants and as many patrolmen as needed, though not to exceed 150. The majority of the new department was hired by September, with the superintendent of police salaried annually at $1,500, sergeants received $600, and patrolmen were paid $480. The officers worked 12-hour shifts, seven days a week with no holidays or vacation time. At first officers were issued no uniform or badges and had to purchase their own firearms. The U.S. Capitol building was chosen as the back drop of the MPD badge a month later and today&#x27;s badge has changed little from the original. The first arrest by an MPD officer was for public intoxication.

At the urging of U.S. Marshal for the District of Columbia Ward Lamon and United States Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, President Lincoln agreed in November 1864 to have bodyguards, although he felt that the president of the United States should not have found it necessary to have guards at all. Superintendent Webb had four MPD officers assigned the task of guarding the White House grounds and accompanying the president on his walks through the city. However, Lincoln did not want this fact made public, and the officer&#x27;s orders were not made official, and they wore plainclothes with their revolvers concealed. One of the officers, William H. Crook, the most well known of Lincoln&#x27;s original guards, would go on to serve under five other administrations and wrote down his recollections in a book, &quot;Through Five Administrations&quot;. He became close to Lincoln and accompanied him to Richmond, Virginia, at Lincoln&#x27;s request after the city was captured. Two officers would begin their shift at 8 a.m. until 4 p.m. They were then relieved by an officer who stay until midnight and was then himself relieved at 8 the next morning.

In December 1864, A. C. Richards became Major and Superintendent, a post he would hold through the next 14 years. Richards was present at Ford&#x27;s Theater the night the Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth. In one of the lowest points of the MPD&#x27;s history, the police officer who was to guard Lincoln that night, John Frederick Parker, had left his post at the door to Lincoln&#x27;s box, presumably to get a drink at the bar across the street. Officer Crook, who had been on duty that day and had been relieved by Parker who was several hours late for his shift, would place blame in his book on Parker for Lincoln&#x27;s death.

After Booth had fled the theater, Major Richards began organizing the activities for investigation until it was taken over by Secretary Stanton. In the hours immediately after the assassination, MPD officers enforced closures of all places of entertainment and helped seal off the city. They patrolled the streets on horses alongside members of the Military Provost. That night on April 14, 1865, an MPD detective entered into the daily blotter: &quot;At this hour the melancholy intelligence of the assassination of Mr. Lincoln President of the U.S. at Fords Theatre was brought to this office and the information obtained ... goes to show that the assassin is a man named J. Wilks Boothe.&quot; It remains the most famous entry in the MPD&#x27;s records. A tip provided to MPD detectives indicated that the Mary E. Surratt Boarding House at 614 H Street was linked to the assassination. The tip would lead to the eventual trial and execution of Booth&#x27;s conspirators.

In 1871, the first MPD officer was killed in the line of duty. On Friday, December 29, 1871, Officer Francis M. Doyle and several other officers attempted to gain entry to the house of a thief to recover stolen property. When they forced the door, the wife of the suspected thief fired at them, striking Doyle in the chest and killing him instantly. Although the wife was arrested and tried for the murder, she was acquitted. Officer Doyle was a veteran of the Civil War, having served in the US Navy, and had been with the MPD for five years. He was 38 years old at the time of his death and was survived by his wife and three children. He was buried in the Congressional Cemetery.

The MPD is only police department that has arrested a sitting U.S. president. During his presidency, Ulysses S. Grant was known to speed in his horse and buggy on Washington&#x27;s streets. The MPD had issued him three different citations for this offense. On the fourth occasion, Grant was arrested on M Street for racing, and his horse and buggy were confiscated. When brought to the station however, the officers became unsure if a sitting president could be formally charged if he had not been impeached. Grant was allowed to pay a fine but had to walk back to the White House. In 1878, Congress abolished the Metropolitan Police Board, and its duties were taken over by the newly formed DC Board of Commissioners, established by Congress to govern the entire district. That year as well, Thomas P. Morgan was named to replace Richards, who had resigned, as Major and Superintendent. Although a police fund had been established during the MPD&#x27;s first year to assist those officers injured in the line of duty, Morgan would add to this by establishing a retirement fund for older officers who could no longer perform their duties.

On July 2, 1881, the MPD took part in investigating the assassination of President James A. Garfield. The assassin, Charles J. Guiteau, approached Garfield at the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station and fired his weapon twice, hitting Garfield. Although Garfield had no bodyguards, MPD Officer Patrick Kearney had been nearby and arrested Guiteau before he could leave the station. Kearney took Guiteau a few blocks away to the station to be booked where the small pistol that Guiteau had used was discovered inside his jacket pocket. The officials at the station at first refused to believe Kearney&#x27;s claims that Guiteau had shot the president. The detective blotter would note the shooting, investigation, and arrest as well as Garfield&#x27;s death several weeks later.

===20th century===

In the summer of 1918, Major and Superintendent Raymond W. Pulliam established the Women&#x27;s Bureau, originally directed by Marion O. Spingarn. The Women&#x27;s Bureau was created to deal with issues involving juveniles, specifically girls, such as delinquency, investigating casework on juveniles, preventive welfare work to curb criminality in juveniles, and the supervision of movie theatres, dance halls, and similar places. Most of the officers in the Bureau in 1920 were trained as school teachers, nurses, or social workers, and included one lawyer. On October 7, 1918, Mina Van Winkle was appointed a police officer in the Women&#x27;s Bureau. She was known to be extremely outspoken and was an ardent supporter of protection for girls and other women during the law enforcement and judicial process. In January 1919 Van Winkle became director of the Women&#x27;s Bureau, a post she held until her death in 1932.

Also in 1919, the MPD established a &quot;School of Instruction&quot; on the third floor of the 7th Precinct. This was the early forerunner to the Training Bureau and today&#x27;s Metropolitan Police Academy. A group of 22 officers took a 30-day course in the fundamental duties of police officers, the law of arrest, and court procedures. By 1930, an official training school was established. The school expanded the original course work to a three-month period, and brought in outside experts from various fields to instruct.

During Prohibition, the MPD remained active dealing with the organized crime that resulted in DC. During that thirteen-year period, almost 25 officers were killed in the line of duty, mostly due to gunfire and accidents while pursuing rum-runners.
During the Great Depression, over 17,000 veterans of the First World War marched on Washington to demand payment for their service. Known as the Bonus Army, they set up camp in a Hooverville in Anacostia Park. The marchers remained at their campsite waiting for President Herbert Hoover to take action after Congress rejected a bill to pay the veterans. On July 28, 1932, Attorney General William D. Mitchell ordered the Metropolitan Police to remove the Bonus Army veterans from their camp. When the veterans moved back into it, they rushed two officers trapped on the second floor of a structure. The cornered officers drew their revolvers and shot two veterans, William Hushka and Eric Carlson, who died later. In the aftermath of the shooting, President Hoover ordered the military, under General Douglas MacArthur, to disperse the Bonus Army. Fifty-five veterans were injured and 135 arrested.
In December 1951, Robert V. Murray became Major and Superintendent. He took the command of a demoralized department marred by embarrassments, corruption, and waning public support. During his 13 years as chief, Murray would be credited with making the most sweeping, and longest lasting changes in the MPD&#x27;s history and is seen as bringing the department into the modern era of policing. One of his first acts was that he would make rounds of the various precincts, inspecting them and the officers where he promised his support. He developed a code of ethics for officers and created a new branch to investigate police corruption, named the Internal Investigations Division—this was a precursor to the Internal Affairs Division. Murray also made good on his promise to improve conditions for his department. By 1952 Murray had petitioned Congress to give his officers a ten percent raise, had turned the six-day work week into a five-day work week, and worked to have two officers per patrol car. He went on to improve the MPD&#x27;s vehicle fleet, initiated the use of canines, radar, helicopters and experimented with hand held radios.

In 1953 Congress passed the District Government Reorganization Act. It formally abolished the rank and title of Major and Superintendent and replaced it with the position of Chief of Police. Murray would be the last Major and Superintendent and the first Chief of Police of the MPD. Murray&#x27;s reforms and efforts improved the image of the department which expanded to 3,000 officers. He and the MPD earned public accolades for their handling of the Transit strikes in the hot summers of 1955 and 1956, the March on Washington, and the funeral of JFK. One of his final major acts would be to fully integrate assignments. Specific assignments and beats would no longer be given by only white officers or only black officers. Although it did not eliminate racist tensions and discrimination, it moved the department forward towards racial equality.
The April 1968 Washington, D.C., riots, in the aftermath of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., were the most devastating to the city. The roughly 20,000 rioters quickly overwhelmed the 3,100 member police department. During the four days of violence, the inner part of Washington was devastated in widespread looting and fires, at one point coming within two blocks of the White House. The rioting ended when 11,850 federal troops and 1,750 D.C. Army National Guardsmen were called out to assist the overwhelmed MPD. 13 people were killed, 1,098 were injured, and over 6,100 were arrested. The resulting economic fallout and crime spike would take many areas decades to recover from. The mobilization of 13,600 troops to assist the MPD in putting down the riot was the largest military occupation of an American city since the Civil War.

On September 20, 1974, Officer Gail A. Cobb was shot and killed, becoming the first female U.S. police officer to be shot and killed while patrolling in the line of duty. While on foot patrol, Cobb was tipped off that a suspected bank robber had just fled into a nearby garage. She located the man and instructed him to place his hands on the wall. As she radioed for assistance, the suspect spun around and fired a single shot at point-blank range. The bullet went through her wrist and her police radio and then struck in the chest, killing her.

Officers of the MPD were also present at the assassination attempt of President Ronald Reagan during which one officer, Thomas Delahanty, was shot. In the late 1980s and early 1990s Washington was hit by the crack epidemic and the homicide rates soared. The district soon became known as the &quot;murder capital&quot; of the nation.

During the 1991 Washington, D.C. riot, the MPD contended with three days of violence by rioters, mostly in the Mt. Pleasant neighborhood, who were upset in the aftermath of a controversial police shooting which exacerbated strained relationships between the city&#x27;s Hispanic population and the MPD. The riot was dispersed after a curfew was initiated and over 1,000 riot police descended on the area to enforce the peace.

In 2000, MPD detective Johnny St. Valentine Brown, assigned to the narcotics division, was convicted of perjury after lying about having a degree from Howard University&#x27;s School of Pharmacy. In the wake of his conviction, many drug offenders with cases involving Brown were retried. In 2001, Brown was charged with contempt after sending the sentencing judge forged letters of support in a bid to gain leniency in his sentencing.

===21st century===
The MPD also responded to the September 11 attacks of 2001. Charles H. Ramsey, who was the Chief of Police at the time, later stated in an interview:

We had just finished up a meeting when my chief of staff came in and told me I needed to go into his office and take a look at what was going on in New York. He had the &quot;Today Show&quot; on and he was looking at images of the first tower burning, the second tower had not yet been hit. I asked what happened and he said nobody seems to know. A small plane based on the way it was described must have flown into the building. Everybody was still kind of not sure if it was an accident, on purpose or whatever and as we were standing there looking we actually saw the second plane strike the second tower. Once the second plane struck they realize that it was an coordinated attack.

The MPD activated its newly built Joint Operations Command Center (JOCC). Although it had not officially opened yet, September 11, 2001, became its first day of operations. While some equipment had been installed, other devices, such as phones, had not and had to be installed on the fly as emergency personnel arrived to respond. Officials from various agencies and departments including the United States Park Police, United States Capitol Police, the FBI, Secret Service, and the FAA&#x27;s military district arrived to respond. Around that time, they were notified that the Pentagon had been hit as well. Though the Pentagon was located across the river in Arlington County, Virginia, MPD officers still responded to assist with the emergency response. Additionally, MPD officers working in conjunction with U.S. Park Police officers locked down all federal buildings along the National Mall, including establishing a perimeter around the White House.
The U.S. Park Police had sent its two helicopters to assist with operations at the Pentagon. Shortly thereafter, the flight control tower at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport was evacuated. Flight control of all airspace over the Washington metro area was turned over to the U.S. Park Police helicopters who coordinated with NORAD. However, needing to assist with evacuating victims, the Park Police requested assistance from MPD. Shortly thereafter, an MPD helicopter arrived and took over command and control of Washington&#x27;s air space.

That evening, after the majority of the population had returned home and Washington&#x27;s streets lay empty, Chief Ramsey, his Executive Assistant Chief Terry Gainer, FBI director Robert Mueller, and Secret Service director Brian L. Stafford drove around D.C. to check security measures of the locked-down city. While several officers also wanted to assist with efforts in New York, many had to remain in D.C. and the majority of the department worked 12-hour shifts several weeks after the attacks. Ramsey noted that at the time many, himself included, thought that there were more attacks to come.

On January 2, 2007, Cathy L. Lanier took the post of Chief of Police. Lanier, who began her career as a Metropolitan Police patrol officer, became the first female chief of the department. She has been singled out in publications for her community-oriented and technology-driven approach to policing that has helped modernize the MPD and lower crime rates. In 2012 the city attained a lowered homicide rate not seen since 1961. Lanier departed in 2016 to lead security for the National Football League and was succeeded by Peter Newsham, the chief from 2017 to 2021.

On September 16, 2013, MPD officers responded to the Washington Navy Yard for an active shooter in Building 197. Two officers were shot during the over-hour-long search and gunfight. The first, Officer Scott Williams, was hit in both legs during an exchange of gunfire with the shooter, Aaron Alexis. The second, Officer Dorian DeSantis, was a member of MPD&#x27;s Emergency Response Team. Officer DeSantis was with U.S. Park Police officers Andrew Wong and Carl Hiott and had entered an area of cubicles when Alexis engaged them, striking DeSantis in his tactical vest. Uninjured by the gunshot, DeSantis immediately returned fire and killed Alexis. In all, thirteen people were killed and eight others were injured, three from gunfire. Williams and DeSantis were given the Medal of Valor, Medal of Honor and the Blue Badge Medal on February 20, 2014, during a ceremony to honor them and the 170 law enforcement officers, including 57 MPD officers, who responded and entered the building to search for Alexis.

During the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol, the Metropolitan police were among the agencies called to restore order. The department reported that 58 officers were injured during the assault, and that several were hospitalized.

In May 2021, Distributed Denial of Secrets republished the leak of Washington D.C.&#x27;s Metropolitan Police Department, including over 90,000 emails. Among other things, the files revealed details of surveillance of right-wing extremists and the response to the 2021 United States Capitol attack.

== Notable responses ==
=== September 11 attacks ===

On September 11, 2001, four commercial aircraft were hijacked by Al-Qaeda. Two of the planes were crashed into each of The World Trade Center towers in New York City, one was retaken by passengers and crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and one was crashed into The Pentagon. All MPD officers were called in to support law enforcement efforts, including those to evacuate the city and protect buildings.

=== Washington Navy Yard shooting ===

On September 16, 2013, Aaron Alexis entered the Washington Navy Yard where he was working as a contractor and carried out the deadliest workplace mass shooting in Washington D.C. history, killing 12. He used a shotgun he had legally purchased days before, and a handgun he had taken from a security guard after fatally shooting him during the attack. His attack lasted 1 hour and 9 minutes before he was fatally shot by a member of the MPD Emergency Response Team (ERT).

=== January 6 United States Capitol attack ===

On January 6, 2021, supporters of Donald Trump, the 45th U.S. president, broke past police barricades and entered the United States Capitol in a failed attempt to overturn his defeat in the 2020 presidential election. MPD was called in to assist the United States Capitol Police. Over 60 MPD officers were injured during their response. The attack resulted in five deaths, including Brian Sicknick, a United States Capitol Police officer.

===2025 Potomac River mid-air collision===

On January 29, 2025, American Eagle Flight 5342, a scheduled domestic passenger flight operated by a Bombardier CRJ700 series airliner, collided mid-air with a United States Army Sikorsky UH-60L Black Hawk helicopter while on final approach to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The flight originated from Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport. Both aircraft crashed into the Potomac River, killing all 67 people on board the two aircraft. The Metropolitan Police Department was among several D.C. area emergency services to respond to the crash scene. 

==Organization and personnel==
===Structure===
MPD is headed by a chief of police. Other senior leadership members includes an executive assistant chief of police, two patrol chiefs (one North and one South), three assistant chiefs (one each for the Investigative Services, Homeland Security, and Internal Affairs bureaus) and two directors (one for the Corporate Support Bureau and one for the Professional Development Bureau). Each of the district&#x27;s seven districts is led by a district commander. The First, Sixth and Seventh Districts report to Patrol Services South while the Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Districts report to Patrol Services North.

The department has a number of specialized units, including the Gun Recovery Unit (GRU) and District Crime Suppression Teams (CSTs). Other specialized units in the MPD are under the Special Liaison Branch works with various parts of Washington&#x27;s population. Within the branch are four units: the Asian Liaison Unit (ALU), the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Liaison Unit (DHHU), the Gay and Lesbian Liaison Unit (GLLU) -- formerly led by internationally recognized leader and retired Lieutenant: Brett Parson, and the Latino Liaison Unit (LLU), which collectively have 196 members. Within MPD&#x27;s Homeland Security Bureau is the Special Operations Division and the Joint Strategic &amp; Tactical Analysis Command Center. Within the Special Operations Division is the Training Unit, Special Tactics Branch, and the Special Events Branch; the latter two units coordinate with the U.S. Secret Service.

===Demographics===
The MPD has had an average of just under 3,800 sworn members. As of the end of 2017, the department had 3,837 sworn personnel and 658 civilian personnel. Of the sworn personnel, there are 3,075 officers and detectives, 146 recruits, 437 sergeants, 116 lieutenants, 35 captains, and 28 command personnel. Among sworn personnel, about 78% were men and 22% were women and, about 52% of sworn personnel were black, 36% were white, 9% were Hispanic, and 4% were Asian. The proportion of African American officers has increased over time; in 1968, African Americans constituted 25% of the department&#x27;s force and in 1970 constituted 35% of the department&#x27;s force.

=== Districts ===
The District of Columbia is divided into seven geographical areas designated as &quot;districts&quot; which are numbered 1–7. The districts are then broken up into Patrol Service Areas (PSA). These PSAs are the beats that are served by the patrol units.
=== Detectives ===
Detectives do not hold supervisory authority over a sergeant and above and do not have supervisory authority over uniformed officers except when taking charge of a crime scene. Members who hold the rank of sergeant or above but are assigned to the Criminal Investigation Division or have investigatory duties, are referred to with the &quot;Detective&quot; title in front, e. g. &quot;Detective-Sergeant&quot;.
===Training===
Persons who are hired by the MPD spend at least 28 weeks at the Maurice T. Turner Jr., Metropolitan Police Academy receiving basic instruction in police work to include laws of arrest, search and seizure, criminal law, traffic regulations, human relations, community policing, and ethics. In addition to these they receive specialized skill training in emergency vehicle operations, firearms, first aid, and defensive tactics.

They are then assigned to one of the seven police districts and are assigned to a field training officer (FTO) who continues to monitor their progress and help them to practically apply their training. The entire process lasts through an 18-month probationary period. At the end of the probationary period, officers are certified to patrol on their own, apply to specialized units, and progress through the department&#x27;s hierarchy.

== Rank structure and uniforms ==
These are the current ranks of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia.

Recruit Officer is the initial rank of oncoming Metropolitan Police officers, held while undergoing training at the Metropolitan Police Academy.
Officers are eligible for the rank of Patrol Officer First Class after three years time in service. Patrol officers first class are given preference, after master patrol officers, in the field testing of new technologies and in the selection of patrol related training.

Master Patrol Officers (MPO) are assigned some of the field training duties, and hold supervisory authority in the absence of a sergeant. The rank of Master Patrol Officer is currently being phased out as the MPD has not held a promotion for the MPO rank in nearly a decade.

The MPD adopts a rank differentiation method via the uniforms worn. Officers up through the rank of Master Patrol Officer wear dark blue shirts and silver badges with &#x27;M.P.D.&#x27; insignia pinned on each side of the collar and silver cap plates. Sergeants also wear the same dark blue shirt but they wear gold badges, gold collar insignia, and gold cap plates instead of silver. Uniformed headgear of all ranks consists of an eight-point hat, similar to those worn by the NYPD and San Francisco Police Departments. Baseball hats are permitted and in the winter a watch cap is authorized for wear. For decades prior to 2018, the MPD wore light blue shirts.

In October 2018 the MPD switched to a new uniform for Officers through Sergeants consisting of an outer load bearing vest with a patch on the back saying &quot;METROPOLITAN POLICE&quot; in white lettering. The color of the uniform also changed from the previous light powder blue to a dark navy blue, similar to the NYPD. The new uniform also consists of wool pants with hidden cargo pockets.

Lieutenants and above wear white shirts with gold badges and gold &#x27;M.P.D.&#x27; insignia pinned on each side of the collar. Their insignia of rank is displayed on the shoulder epaulets of the uniform (as in the military). The badges and cap plates for higher-ranking officers are gold and engraved with the wearer&#x27;s rank-title. With the exception of their badges and rank insignia the outer uniform dress is the same for all ranks, but may include a blazer with any awarded service ribbons displayed above the badge.

== Equipment and vehicles ==
The standard-issue service weapon for MPD officers is the Glock 17 or Glock 19. Officers at the rank of lieutenant or above are authorized to carry the Glock 26. Investigators and Detectives are authorized to carry the Glock 19.

The Emergency Response Team uses the SIG Sauer P226 9x19mm as the sidearm instead of the standard issue Glock pistols carried by other units and officers in the agency.

The current colors of MPD vehicles is an all-white body with red stripes and a single blue stripe that waves through the red stripes. The word &quot;POLICE&quot; is printed in large text on the side of the car, and &quot;MPDC&quot;, with the MPD shield splitting MP and DC, on the rear quarter panels of the vehicle. The cruiser number is printed on the front fenders of the vehicle. The cruiser number is also printed on the roof of the vehicle as well as on the back right of the vehicle with the district or unit on the back left. The motto &quot;We are here to help&quot; is printed on the rear windows. &quot;METROPOLITAN POLICE&quot; is emblazoned on the back of the vehicle as well. The vehicles are designed and outfitted by Major Police Supply in Laurel, Maryland.

The MPD utilizes a variety of vehicles to support their mission. For patrol operations the department utilizes the Ford Police Interceptor Sedan, Ford Police Interceptor Utility, Chevrolet Impala, Dodge Durango, Ford Fusion, and the Dodge Charger. The Ford Transit Prisoner Transport Van is also utilized by patrol for prisoner transports as well as patrol operations if the district is short on vehicles. The department also utilizes the Chevrolet Malibu, Ford Fusion, and Chrysler 200. These are typically unmarked and are used by detectives and specialty units such as Crime Suppression Teams. The Special Operations Division (SOD) has a large variety of vehicles including the Eurocopter AS350B3, Lenco Bearcat, and a Freightliner M2 tandem rear axle chassis with a mobile command center van. In addition to the vehicles used by patrol, the SOD also uses the Ford F-150 Police Responder, Chevrolet Tahoe, Harley-Davidson FLHPTI motorcycles, and many others. In 2020, MPD introduced a new fleet of 2020 BMW R1250RT-P motorcycles which were seen during the 2021 presidential inauguration.

As of 2018, the MPD maintained a fleet of nearly 1,700 vehicles. This consists of 830 marked police cruisers, 405 unmarked police cruisers, 170 marked other vehicles (such as vans, SUVs, trucks, and command buses), 29 unmarked other vehicles, 134 Honda-Harley scooters, 60 Harley-Davidson FLHTPI motorcycles, 17 boats, and 34 miscellaneous vehicles, including forklifts, traffic machines, and trailers. The MPD also maintains a fleet of police Segways.
== Line-of-duty deaths ==
Since its establishment, 123 MPD officers have died in the line of duty. The most common causes of line-of-duty deaths among MPD officers have been gunfire (61), motorcycle crash (11), automobile crash (9), vehicular assault (7), and accidental gunfire (8).
==In popular culture==
The MPD has been featured in several novels, films, and television series. In these depictions it is often, but incorrectly, referred to as the &quot;Metro&quot; Police instead of the &quot;Metropolitan&quot; Police. There is a distinction, as the &quot;Metro Police&quot; is the commonly used name to refer to the police department of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, a multi-jurisdictional transportation agency (DC/Maryland/Virginia). The primary jurisdiction of the &quot;Metro Police&quot; is the metropolitan area subway (known as &quot;the Metro&quot;) and the bus transit system whereas MPD has jurisdiction throughout Washington, D.C.

===Novels===
* Author James Patterson features MPD police detective Alex Cross in the &quot;Alex Cross&quot; series of books.
* The novels of George Pelecanos, which are largely set in the Washington, D.C. area, have included several major and minor characters who are active or former MPD officers.
* The novels of Margaret Truman feature MPD detectives. The 1997 film &quot;Murder at 1600&quot; was based on her first novel. The premise of the novel and film, that an MPD Homicide detective would be the lead investigator for a death that occurs in the White House is factually correct as the MPD has primary jurisdiction over death investigations anywhere in the District of Columbia.
* The 2009 novel &quot;True Blue&quot; by David Baldacci features a former MPD officer as the protagonist and her older sister who is the Chief of Police. The chief in the novel was loosely based on Chief Cathy Lanier. Baldacci spent time shadowing MPD officers and interviewed Chief Lanier for the novel.
* Author Philip Scholz&#x27;s novel &quot;Slovo Ne Vorobey&quot; is set in Washington, D.C., and features several MPD officers and detectives who are hunting a serial killer.

===Television===
* The syndicated CBS television series &quot;The District&quot; (2000–2004) dramatized the daily goings-on of the police department.
* The TV series &quot;Bones&quot; (2005–2017) has MPD officers as characters at crime scenes that are set in Washington, D.C.
* The online U.S. TV series &quot;House of Cards&quot; (2013–2018) features the MPD in several episodes, specifically in the first season when they play a prominent role in the development of a cover-up. The police chief is incorrectly portrayed as the police &quot;Commissioner&quot;.
* The TV series &quot;Minority Report&quot; features the 2065 iteration of the department.

===Film===
* In the 1943 film &quot;Sherlock Holmes in Washington&quot;, Sherlock Holmes played by Basil Rathbone, investigates a disappearance with the help of Washington Police 
* Harrison Ford portrays MPD Internal Affairs Sergeant William &quot;Dutch&quot; Van Den Broeck in the 1999 film &quot;Random Hearts&quot;.
* In the 2009 film &quot;State of Play&quot;, two reporters investigate a series of murders in conjunction with MPD. MPD detectives and MPD cruisers are featured prominently in several scenes.

===Video Games===
* The game Payday 2 prominently features the mpd as one of the main enemy factions of the game appearing as first responders and swat units on the Normal and Hard difficulties.

<text>Winning Lines is a National Lottery game show that was broadcast on BBC One from 12 June 1999 to 16 October 2004. It was originally hosted by Simon Mayo and then by Phillip Schofield.

==Gameplay==
===Round 1===
Forty-nine contestants take part in this round, each is assigned a two-digit number from 01 to 49. In the first series, Mayo asks a question that can be answered by one of these numbers, and anyone who believes that his/her number is the answer may buzz in. Contestants who buzz in wrongly are eliminated. If the owner of the correct number buzzes in, he/she advances to the next round, if not, he/she is eliminated. The host continues to ask questions until six contestants have qualified to advance, at which point all others are eliminated.

The format of this round was changed beginning with the second series. Each contestant now has a keypad on which to enter answers. Mayo or Schofield asks a question with a numerical answer, and the contestant who keys it in first in the fastest time advances to the next round. Anyone who enters an incorrect answer is eliminated from the game. As before, the round ends when six contestants have qualified to advance, and all others are eliminated.

The last digit from each of the six advancing players&#x27; numbers are displayed at the end of the show. Any home viewers who can form their own telephone number from these digits (in any order as always mentioned by Simon &amp; Phillip) may call in for a chance to appear on the next episode.

===Round 2 – Looking After Number One===
The six qualifying contestants retain their numbers from the first round. The host asks a series of toss-up questions on the buzzer, each of which can be answered with the number of a contestant still in play at the time. If a contestant responds correctly with an opponent&#x27;s number, that opponent is eliminated; a contestant who responds correctly with his/her own number remains in the game. An incorrect response eliminates the contestant who gave it, regardless of the number. If no one buzzes in on a question, the contestant with the correct number is eliminated. The last remaining contestant advances to the Wonderwall round for a chance to win a trip, whilst the last contestant eliminated from the game wins a holiday in the Countryside.

===Final Round – The Wonderwall===
The champion faces a set of three projection screens on which 49 answers are displayed, numbered 1 to 49, and has three minutes to answer as many questions as possible. The host gives the champion 15 seconds to study the answers, after which the questions begin and the clock starts to run. The champion must respond by giving both an answer and its number. The correct answer is then removed from the board, regardless of whether the contestant gave it or not. No penalties were given for incorrect answers.

Twice during the round, the champion may take a &quot;pit stop&quot; by pressing a handheld button. Doing so freezes the clock for 15 seconds, during which the champion may look over the answers again, however, he/she may not respond to the current question until the pit stop has ended.

The champion wins a trip whose destination depends on the number of correct answers given, as shown in the table below. During Schofield&#x27;s first series as host, the champion then played the Wonderwall again (on the same day as the Wednesday Lotto draw), but with no pit stops, each correct answer awarded £200 with a bonus of £1,000 for getting all 20, for a potential maximum of £5,000. Afterwards, they were then also given the right to start the midweek lottery draws.

The prize for giving only one correct answer was a stay at a bed-and-breakfast near the Gravelly Hill Interchange, popularly referred to as &quot;Spaghetti Junction.&quot;

During Simon Mayo&#x27;s tenure as host, the runner-up in round 2 started the Thunderball draw and the Wonderwall winner started the main Lottery draw. When Schofield took over as host from series three, the Thunderball draw moved to being before round 2, with Schofield himself starting the draw, and the Lottery and Lottery Extra draws took place before the Wonderwall; in the third and fourth series, the runner-up contestant started both the Lottery and Lottery Extra draws, but from the fifth series onwards all draws in the show were started by Schofield.

==Winning Lines - Midweek Draws==
During the third series in 2001, the winner of each edition of Saturday&#x27;s show had to return on Wednesday to play the Wonderwall again for a chance to win some spending money to take on their holidays. Each correct answer was worth £200, with twenty correct answers earning them a bonus £1,000, to make a total of £5,000. The only sting of the round was that there were no &quot;pitstops&quot;. During its one series run, only one contestant managed to answer all 20 questions correctly to win the top prize of £5,000.

==International versions==
In Italy, between 2000 and 2001, the end-game &quot;The Wonderwall&quot; was played as a segment of &quot;Domenica in&quot; on Rai Uno and presented by Carlo Conti.

<text>Friedrich Julius Hammer (7 June 1810 – 23 August 1862) was a German poet born in Dresden.

In 1831 he went to Leipzig to study law, but devoted himself mainly to philosophy and belles lettres. Returning to Dresden in 1834 a small comedy, &quot;Das seltsame Frühstück&quot;, introduced him to the literary society of the capital, notably to Ludwig Tieck, and from this time he devoted himself entirely to writing. In 1837 he returned to Leipzig, and, coming again to Dresden, from 1851 to 1859 edited the &quot;feuilleton&quot; of &quot;Sächsische konstitutionelle Zeitung&quot;, and took the lead in the foundation in 1855 of the Schiller Institute in Dresden. His marriage in 1851 had made him independent, and he bought a small property at Pillnitz, on which, soon after his return from a residence of several years at Nuremberg, he died.

Hammer wrote, besides several comedies, a drama &quot;Die Brüder&quot; (1856), a number of unimportant romances, and the novel &quot;Einkehr und Umkehr&quot; (Leipzig, 1856); but his reputation rests upon his epigrammatic and didactic poems. His &quot;Schau um dich, und schau in dich&quot; (1851), which made his name, has passed through more than thirty editions. It was followed by &quot;In allen guten Stunden&quot; (1854), &quot;Fester Grund&quot; (1857), &quot;Auf stillen Wegen&quot; (1859), and &quot;Lerne, liebe, lebe&quot; (1862).

Besides these he wrote a book of Turkish songs, &quot;Unter dem Halbmond&quot; (Leipzig, 1860), and rhymed versions of the psalms (1861), and compiled the popular religious anthology &quot;Leben und Heimat in Gott&quot;, of which a 14th edition was published in 1900.
He was a member of the &quot;Naturforschenden Gesellschaft Isis&quot; in Dresden.

<doc id="1313609" wikidata="Q6966903" url="?curid=1313609" title="Nashua Corporation">
<text>The Nashua Corporation (NASDAQ: NSHA) was an American company headquartered in Nashua, New Hampshire that made labels, specialty papers, and imaging products and services. On September 15, 2009, it was bought by Cenveo, Inc. As of early 2010, it had four factories in several states. In April 2019 the long-run label and receipt paper businesses were sold by Cenveo to Iconex.

== History ==
Nashua began as a gummed paper manufacturer in Rockport, Massachusetts. In 1898 the company went defunct. The owner, Charles H. Crowell, was an inventor and entrepreneur. He sold his failing company to Carter, Rice &amp; Company of Boston, who retained Crowell as manager of their new division, renamed Winthrop Manufacturing Company. A fire destroyed the factory in February, 1904, which had moved to south Boston. The search for a new location led the owners to Nashua, New Hampshire, where they found the heavily indebted Nashua Card and Glazed Paper Company, which had been founded in 1849 as a manufacturer of cardboard and glazed paper. During the California Gold Rush Nashua made playing cards for miners and became known as a result as the Card Shop. This name remained with the company for nearly 100 years. The owners of Nashua sold their factory to Carter and Rice for $74,000, plus mortgage. Thus, in 1904, the Nashua Corporation was founded. In April, 1904 the wholly-owned subsidiary was incorporated. It became known as the Nashua Card, Gummed and Coated Paper Company. The new company combined the capabilities of both companies, continuing to manufacture the products of Carter, Rice &amp; Company: gummed flats, gummed paper and sock linings. They added the products of the previous company, glazed paper, cardboard and &quot;surface coated&quot; paper.

In 1910 the company had its first telephone installed along with new office machinery and boilers. That year the company also retained its first chemist, adding research and development to the business model.

In 1926 it bought the Knowles Youngblood Co.

The entire city of Nashua worked at the mill in the 1930s through the 1960s.

Dolers card company moved into the plant (date unknown) bringing in women workers which had not previously worked at a paper-producing plant. Napkins began being processed at the Nashua plant in the 1960s or 1970s. A women designer came in as a consultant, and brought many more designs to the plant. This reflected an evolution of the company from paper milling to design and print work. New machines came in that could print on cloth and other materials. (PNL/rd) There were five designers on staff in the 1950s and 1960s. Mainly focused on bubble gum wrappers (3 of the 5 staff designers), the Hershey’s 5 cent candy bars kept the company in business.

In 2000 it merged with Rittenhouse, another printing specialty firm.

Nashua Corporation sold its line of tape products to Tyco International in 1997. The tape products line was then divested as part of Covalence Specialty Materials which later merged with Berry Plastics. Nashua Brand Tape Products are now manufactured in Franklin, Kentucky.

== Popular culture ==
Nashua Tape Products&#x27; 357 brand duct tape is used by MythBusters duo Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman for their projects. Nashua Tape&#x27;s 357 was featured in four MythBusters episodes including Duct Tape Hour (Season 7, Episode 13), Duct Tape Hour 2 (Season 8, Episode 7), Duct Tape Plane (Season 9, Episode 16), and most recently Duct Tape Island (Season 10, Episode 1).

Nashua Corporation was featured in the 1980 NBC White Paper episode If Japan Can... Why Can&#x27;t We?

<text>Rampisham Down is a chalk hill in the Dorset Downs, eight miles north west of Dorchester in west Dorset, England. The highest part of the hill is 221 metres (720 feet). To the north east of the hill is the Frome valley and the village of Rampisham, to the south west is the Hooke valley and the village of Hooke. The A356 road between Dorchester and Crewkerne cuts across the down.

==Communications station==

Rampisham Down was the location of one of the main transmitters of the BBC World Service in Europe until it was shut in 2011. There were 26 transmitter pylons on the down.

The 189-acre site was acquired by the BBC in November 1939 and the station, known as Overseas Extension 3 (OSE3), was equipped with four Marconi type SWB 18, 100 kW short-wave transmitters. The transmitter halls, each containing a pair of these transmitters, were separated by heavy blast walls. A comprehensive aerial system was installed consisting of 29 arrays supported between 15 masts of heights varying between 100 ft and 325 ft. Full world coverage was given by this aerial system, although the transmissions were primarily intended for areas outside Europe. This was the first of the BBC&#x27;s short-wave stations to be provided with 4-wire transmission lines, following tests made at Daventry (OSE1). A remotely controlled switching tower was used for connecting any transmitter to any aerial array (antenna).

OSE3 was provided with an emergency power supply consisting of two 750-bhp diesel alternator sets. The diesel engines, which had been designed for railway locomotives abroad, were equipped with battery starting facilities instead of the compressed-air starting arrangements that were conventional for diesel engines of this size. The station came into service on 16 February 1941 and during May of that year a number of tests were carried out using a captive balloon to measure the performance of the horizontal dipole arrays and to determine the effect of the contour of the ground close to the station on their vertical radiation pattern.

During those first years the site was subject to attempts at destruction by the German Luftwaffe. Mr E.A. Beaumont, who was part of the original installation team writes: &#x27;I have vivid recollections of my colleagues during these years when we completed the installation and putting into service of the station to the accompaniment of the Luftwaffe&#x27;s efforts to put southern England out of action and I can still recall the line of craters left on the north side of the road opposite the station by a stick of bombs deposited by a German bomber one night and the cannon shells which penetrated the diesel generator building on another occasion. Aerial dog fights between large formations of German bombers and our defending fighters became a daily occurrence‘.

The original transmitters remained in service until 1963 when they were replaced by 250 kW transmitters built by Marconi along with two twin-channel 100 kW units. About three years later the first of the BBC&#x27;s relay stations overseas was built on Ascension Island and in order to provide a programme feed to the island two 60 kW Single Side Band transmitters were installed at Rampisham. This method of sending programme feeds to the relay stations continued until satellite feeds became available.

In 1982 Rampisham went through the biggest re-engineering since it began. The site was completely stripped of the old antennas and the building gutted to a shell in preparation for a complete new installation. Ten 500 kW transmitters and 34 wideband curtain arrays were installed. The majority of antennas point in an Easterly direction with others capable of beaming to the West. A fully automatic control system was also installed that continually monitored the broadcasts and the site.

In 2010 the station was operated by Babcock International Group as part of the takeover of VT Group (formerly VT Communications and Merlin Communications following the privatisation of BBC Transmission Services in 1997).

Following extensive budget cuts by the BBC World Service, due to the ceasing of funding by the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office, the site was earmarked for closure in Summer 2011. The final broadcast from the site took place on Saturday 29 October 2011. Sender 48 was the final transmitter on-air, broadcasting Deutsche Welle&#x27;s German service to Europe on 6075 kHz between 21:00 and 21:59. This was the final Deutsche Welle broadcast to Europe. The final BBC transmissions were in Arabic between 20:00 and 21:00 on 5790 kHz and 11680 kHz to North Africa.
==Site of Special Scientific Interest==
In August 2013 Rampisham Down was notified as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) by Natural England, in recognition of a very large area of lowland acid grassland occurring on the whole site, together with areas of lowland heath habitat. These have hardly been disturbed since the communications station was installed. The acid grassland is largely agriculturally unimproved and forms the largest area of this habitat in the county of Dorset. Such a site of over is rare in lowland England, and the mosaic of acid grassland and lowland heath habitats is of national significance.

==Proposed solar farm==
On 15 January 2015 West Dorset District Council approved a planning application by British Solar Renewables to build a solar farm on of the site of the former transmitting station, subject to conditions and for a period of 25 years. The facility will generate 24 megawatts. The rest of the site is to remain as grassland. The scheme is opposed by a number of organisations including Dorset Wildlife Trust.

On 2 February 2015 the Government instructed West Dorset District Council to stop any further progress with the development, while the Department of Communities and Local Government considered whether to call in the application to be decided at a public inquiry.

On 30 June 2015 the Government announced it had called in the planning permission for the development, to be determined by a planning inspector at a public inquiry.

British Solar Renewables asked for the public inquiry, set to take place in September 2016, to be put &quot;on hold&quot;, pending an application to develop an adjacent site that is less controversial. On the 22 December 2016 planning permission was granted for this smaller site. In addition, plans for the main site will be dropped and existing infrastructure on the SSSI will be removed.

<doc id="1313620" wikidata="Q3153554" url="?curid=1313620" title="Inverse quadratic interpolation">
<text>In numerical analysis, inverse quadratic interpolation is a root-finding algorithm, meaning that it is an algorithm for solving equations of the form &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 0. The idea is to use quadratic interpolation to approximate the inverse of &quot;f&quot;. This algorithm is rarely used on its own, but it is important because it forms part of the popular Brent&#x27;s method.

==The method==

The inverse quadratic interpolation algorithm is defined by the recurrence relation

:formula_1

:::::formula_2

where &quot;f&quot;&quot;k&quot; = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;&quot;k&quot;). As can be seen from the recurrence relation, this method requires three initial values, &quot;x&quot;0, &quot;x&quot;1 and &quot;x&quot;2.

==Explanation of the method==

We use the three preceding iterates, &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;−2, &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 and &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;, with their function values, &quot;f&quot;&quot;n&quot;−2, &quot;f&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 and &quot;f&quot;&quot;n&quot;. Applying the Lagrange interpolation formula to do quadratic interpolation on the inverse of &quot;f&quot; yields

:formula_3

:formula_4

We are looking for a root of &quot;f&quot;, so we substitute &quot;y&quot; = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 0 in the above equation, and this results in the above recursion formula.

==Behaviour==

The asymptotic behaviour is very good: generally, the iterates &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; converge fast to the root once they get close. However, performance is often quite poor if the initial values are not close to the actual root. For instance, if by any chance two of the function values &quot;f&quot;&quot;n&quot;−2, &quot;f&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 and &quot;f&quot;&quot;n&quot; coincide, the algorithm fails completely. Thus, inverse quadratic interpolation is seldom used as a stand-alone algorithm.

The order of this convergence is approximately 1.84 as can be proved by secant method analysis.

==Comparison with other root-finding methods==

As noted in the introduction, inverse quadratic interpolation is used in Brent&#x27;s method. 

Inverse quadratic interpolation is also closely related to some other root-finding methods.
Using linear interpolation instead of quadratic interpolation gives the secant method. Interpolating &quot;f&quot; instead of the inverse of &quot;f&quot; gives Muller&#x27;s method.

<text>Municipal police, city police, or local police are law enforcement agencies that are under the control of local government. This includes the municipal government, where it is the smallest administrative subdivision. They receive funding from the city budget, and may have fewer legal powers than the &quot;state paid&quot; police. These police forces usually report to a mayor or a local police board.

== Historical development ==
Historically, the role of the municipal police of local civic protection was carried out by watchmen. Today, some formations of municipal police still carry the name of the city/communal/municipal guard.

<doc id="1313623" wikidata="Q1365679" url="?curid=1313623" title="Calender">
<text>A calender is a series of hard pressure rollers used to finish or smooth a sheet of material such as paper, textiles, rubber, or plastics. Calender rolls are also used to form some types of plastic films and to apply coatings. Some calender rolls are heated or cooled as needed. Calenders are sometimes misspelled &quot;calendars&quot;.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;calender&quot; itself is a derivation of the word κύλινδρος &quot;kylindros&quot;, the Greek word that is also the source of the word &quot;cylinder&quot;.

==History==
Calender mills for pressing serge were apparently introduced to the Netherlands by Flemish refugees from the Eighty Years&#x27; War in the 16th and 17th centuries.

In eighteenth century China, workers called &quot;calenderers&quot; in the silk- and cotton-cloth trades used heavy rollers to press and finish cloth.

In 1836, Edwin M. Chaffee, of the Roxbury India Rubber Company, patented a four-roll calender to make rubber sheet. Chaffee worked with Charles Goodyear with the intention to &quot;produce a sheet of rubber laminated to a fabric base&quot;. Calenders were also used for paper and fabrics long before later applications for thermoplastics. With the expansion of the rubber industry the design of calenders grew as well, so when PVC was introduced the machinery was already capable of processing it into film. As recorded in an overview on the history of the development of calenders, &quot;There was development in both Germany and the United States and probably the first successful calendering of PVC was in 1935 in Germany, where in the previous year the Hermann Berstorff Company of Hannover designed the first calender specifically to process this plastic&quot;.

In the past, for paper, sheets were worked on with a polished hammer or pressed between polished metal sheets in a press. With the continuously operating paper machine it became part of the process of rolling the paper (in this case also called web paper). The pressure between the rollers, the &quot;nip pressure&quot;, can be reduced by heating the rolls or moistening the paper surface. This helps to keep the bulk and the stiffness of the web paper which is beneficial for its later use.

Modern calenders have hard heated rollers made from chilled cast iron or steel, and soft rollers coated with polymeric composites. The soft roller is slightly non-cylindrical, tapered in diameter toward both ends, to widen the working nip and distribute the specific pressure on the paper more evenly.

==Calendering paper==
In a principal paper application, the calender is located at the end of a papermaking process (on-line). Those that are used separately from the process (off-line) are also called &quot;supercalenders&quot;. The purpose of a calender is to make the paper smooth and glossy for printing and writing, as well as of a consistent thickness for capacitors that use paper as their dielectric membrane.

The calender section of a paper machine consists of a calender and other equipment. The paper web is run between in order to further smooth it out, which also gives it a more uniform thickness. The pressure applied to the web by the rollers determines the finish of the paper, in three basic types:

* machine finish, or MF Paper, which can range from a rough, matte (non glossy) look, to a smooth, high-quality finish.

* supercalendered finish, or MG Paper (Machine Glazed), glossy/glazed and suitable for high-degree, fine-screened halftone printing.

* plater finish, obtained by placing cut sheets of paper between stacked zinc or copper plates and put under pressure and heat. A special finish such as a linen finish would be achieved by placing a piece of linen between the plate and the sheet of paper, or else an embossed steel roll might be used.

After calendering, the web has a moisture content of about 6% (depending on the finish). It is wound onto a roll called a &quot;tambour&quot;, and stored for final cutting and shipping.

===Supercalender===
A supercalender is a stack of calenders consisting of alternating steel- and fiber-covered rolls through which paper is passed to increase its density, smoothness and gloss. It is similar to a calender except that alternate chilled cast-iron and softer rolls are used. The rolls used to supercalender uncoated paper usually consist of cast iron and highly compressed paper, while the rolls used for coated paper are usually cast iron and highly compressed cotton. The finish produced varies according to the raw material used to make the paper and the pressure exerted on it, and ranges from the highest English finish to a highly glazed surface. Supercalendered papers are sometimes used for books containing fine line blocks or halftones because they print well from type and halftones, although for the latter they are not as good as coated paper.

==Calendering textiles==
Calendering is a finishing process used on cloth and fabrics. A calender is employed, usually to smooth, coat, or thin a material.

With textiles, fabric is passed under rollers at high temperatures and pressures. Calendering is used on fabrics such as moire to produce its watered effect and also on cambric and some types of sateens.

Various man-made fabrics made from synthetic materials are also calendered. 

==Other materials==

Calenders can also be applied to materials other than paper and textiles when a smooth, flat surface is desirable. 

Polymers such as vinyl and ABS polymer sheets, and to a lesser extent HDPE, polypropylene and polystyrene, are calendered.

The calender is also an important processing machine in the rubber industries, especially in the manufacture of tires, where it is used for the inner layer and fabric layer.

Calendering can also be used for polishing, or making uniform, coatings applied to substrates- an older use was in polishing magnetic tapes, for which the contact roller rotates much faster than the web speed. More recently, it is used in the production of certain types of secondary battery cells (such as spirally-wound or prismatic lithium-ion cells) to achieve uniform thickness of electrode material coatings on current collector foils.

<doc id="1313629" wikidata="Q3575946" url="?curid=1313629" title="The Chair (game show)">
<text>The Chair is an American game show that was created by Julie Christie, Darryl McEwen and Brian Bigg for Touchdown Television (now Eyeworks Touchdown). Although &quot;The Chair&quot; was originally developed in New Zealand, the first country where the program aired in was the United States. The American version, which was hosted by former tennis champion John McEnroe, aired on ABC for nine episodes from January 15 to March 18, 2002; the American version would be canceled with four episodes remaining unaired of its original 13-episode order. McEnroe would later host the British version, which aired between August 31 and November 9, 2002, on BBC One. Among the show&#x27;s writers was writer/actress Teresa Strasser, who had served on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; and later hosted TLC&#x27;s &quot;While You Were Out&quot;.

==Format==
Prospective contestants underwent extensive medical examination before appearing. They were given intelligence tests and had their heart monitored for several hours, among other diagnostic procedures to see how they would react to sudden surprises. If they were declared fit, they moved on to the game.

;Question round

Once seated in the Chair, the contestant found themselves looking up at a large video screen on which the host&#x27;s image was displayed, as well as the information for the current question. They began with a stake of $5,000 and could increase it to a maximum of $250,000 by answering a series of seven questions. The contestant&#x27;s heart rate was continuously measured throughout the game and compared to a &quot;redline&quot; threshold. This value started at 60% (later 70%) above the resting heart rate, and it was reduced by 5% of the resting heart rate after each question (with a maximum redline threshold of between 130% and 140% for the final question). For example, a contestant with a resting heart rate of 80 would have an initial redline threshold of 128 or 136 (160% and 170% of the resting rate, respectively), which would drop by 4 (5%) after each question.

For each question except the fifth, a list of four possible answers was presented, and then the question itself was read. The host would then tell the contestant whether or not an answer could be accepted, depending on their heart rate at the moment.

Money was subtracted from the contestant&#x27;s total for every second that their heart rate exceeded the redline value (&quot;redlining&quot;). In addition, they were ineligible to give an answer during this time; only while the heart rate was no higher than the threshold number could an answer be given. Redlining between questions, or while a question was being asked, mostly carried no penalty; for at least the first episode, the penalty went into effect when the host began reading the question, but later it would be after the whole question had been read. The third question involved recalling information from a series of images that appeared on the screen above them and required the player to remember something specific or particular details about one image, the fifth required the player to list items pertaining to a given category, and the seventh involved choosing which event occurred first or last (this question type would be eliminated later in the show&#x27;s run). After the fourth question, the host made a one-time offer: keep the redline rate constant for the next question, at a cost of $25,000; this offer was rarely accepted.

As long as the contestant had money in the account and continued to answer questions correctly, the game continued until all seven questions were answered correctly. The game prematurely ended when a contestant answered a single question incorrectly, lost all of their money due to redlining, or committed a third violation of the countermeasure rule.

If the contestant answered a question incorrectly, they left with whatever amount they had &quot;stabilized&quot; (see below). Correctly answering every question awarded the contestant all of the money in their account, for a potential top prize of $250,000 if they had no redlining penalties.

;Heartstoppers
At two points during the contestant&#x27;s campaign, a &quot;heartstopper&quot; event took place. These were designed to raise the heart rate (coming face to face with an alligator or a hive of bees, a large pendulum swinging just overhead, having McEnroe serve tennis balls at the contestant&#x27;s head, etc.). Precautions were taken to ensure the contestant&#x27;s safety during these events, such as a pane of heavy plastic being set just in front of their face as McEnroe served. If the contestant could endure the event for 15 seconds (20 seconds in some versions), the event would end. If they went over the redline rate, the event continued until the heart rate was under control, and the contestant lost money at the rate for the previously answered question. In the Korean version, the host is responsible for initiating the Heartstopper by saying, simply enough, &quot;start the Heartstopper&quot;, at which point the countdown begins. If a contestant is redlining, the Heartstopper is not officially over until the contestant lowers their heart rate back into the &quot;safe zone&quot;.

In some international versions of the show (usually for the first Heartstopper only), a contestant must answer rapid-fire free-response questions in a 45-second bonus round which is designed to add 1 heartbeat back to the redline threshold for each correct answer. In the original New Zealand version, for the second Heartstopper, the contestant must answer 7 rapid-fire questions in a 60-second bonus round on one of the three categories shown on the screen above them. Each correct answer it was given, they will earn money but with each wrong answer to each question, they will be monetarily penalized from only their stabilized winnings.

;Stabilization
After answering the $15,000 question correctly (for a potential prize of $35,000), the contestant earned the chance to &quot;stabilize&quot;. Once during the rest of the game, they could exercise this option after a correct answer; if they missed a question or received their third violation of the countermeasure rule, they would leave with the money won up to the &quot;stabilize&quot; point. However, if the contestant redlined in the interim and went below the stabilized amount, the stabilized amount would fall and match the current prize amount.

In the British version of the show, a contestant would be required to stabilize after correctly answering the fifth question if they had not yet done so by that point.

;Countermeasure rule
Contestants were required to stay alert during the game at all times. If a contestant tried to close their eyes or perform some other task in an attempt to lower the heart rate, the host gave a warning. If a contestant received a third violation or suffered a medical issue during the game, they were disqualified from the game; contestants could still leave with their stabilized amount. The latter never happened, though one contestant on the US show received two violations and was almost disqualified for the above actions. On the first episode, one contestant closed her eyes for the entire time on the one Heartstopper she reached and was not penalized. In the Korean version, this warning rule only applied in Heartstoppers.

==Broadcast history==
&quot;The Chair&quot; aired for nine episodes on ABC between January 15 and March 18, 2002, but not before two people managed to answer the final question correctly; Kris Derrico (née Mackerer) won $224,600 () on the fourth episode that aired on February 5 and Steven Benjamin won the maximum $250,000 () on the ninth and final episode that aired on March 18. On January 29, 2002, just a week before Mackerer&#x27;s $224,600 win, another player, Dean Sheffron, reached the last question with a total of $132,200 but lost it all due to redlining.

Thirteen episodes were taped, but only nine were broadcast. Many episodes were taped during post-midnight hours to hurry production in order to compete with Fox&#x27;s show &quot;The Chamber&quot; (which was canceled after three episodes of its six-episode order were aired). Both programs would air during NBC&#x27;s coverage of the 2002 Winter Olympics, which resulted in low ratings and became a factor in the cancellation of both programs (along with high production costs).

===&quot;The Chamber&quot; vs. &quot;The Chair&quot;===
&quot;The Chair&quot; premiered around the same time as Fox&#x27;s torture show &quot;The Chamber&quot;. The production companies fought over this, each claiming the other show was a rip-off of theirs. A lawsuit was filed against Fox and the production company of &quot;The Chamber&quot; by the New Zealand production company of &quot;The Chair&quot;, Touchdown Television, but nothing became of it.

==International versions==
Apart from the US version being aired first, it has led to recreation of becoming a worldwide franchise as the show was adapted and recreated in several other countries.
Most international versions&#x27; intros often have the shape of the heart on &quot;The Chair&quot;, including the original New Zealand version (except the German version). All these international versions were distributed by UK distributor Target Entertainment (or Target TV).

<doc id="1313638" wikidata="Q302603" url="?curid=1313638" title="Yessongs">
<text>Yessongs is the first live album by the English progressive rock band Yes, released as a triple album in May 1973 on Atlantic Records. After completing their Close to the Edge Tour in April 1973, the band selected live recordings between February and December 1972 on their tours supporting &quot;Fragile&quot; (1971) and &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; (1972) for a live album release. They were then edited and remixed with their producer and live sound mixer Eddy Offord. Two tracks feature original Yes drummer Bill Bruford while eight tracks feature his replacement, Alan White, and three tracks use no drummer at all.

&quot;Yessongs&quot; received a mostly positive reception from music critics, though much criticism was directed at its sound quality. The album was a commercial success for the band, reaching number 7 on the UK Albums Chart and number 12 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In 1998, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for selling over one million copies in the United States. In 2015, recordings of seven shows from late 1972, including ones that were used in the original album, were released in their entirety as &quot;&quot;.

==Background and recording==
In September 1971, the Yes line-up of singer Jon Anderson, bassist Chris Squire, drummer Bill Bruford, guitarist Steve Howe, and newcomer keyboardist Rick Wakeman embarked on their Fragile Tour in support of the band&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Fragile&quot; (1971). The tour saw the band play across the United Kingdom, the United States, and Europe until March 1972. Following the recording of their fifth studio album, &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; (1972), the band resumed as a live act on 30 July 1972 to support the album. The tour saw the debut of drummer Alan White in the band after Bruford left when recording for the album had finished. His departure came eleven days prior to the tour&#x27;s start, leaving White to learn the band&#x27;s repertoire in three days. The tour ended in April 1973, by which time Yes had made additional live recordings. Yes manager Brian Lane said that people had started to think that the group were a &quot;studio band&quot; and were unable to reproduce what they recorded in the studio on stage, which became a reason for putting out a live album.

The &quot;Fragile&quot; and &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; tours had producer and engineer Eddy Offord travelling with the band as their live sound mixer who operated a sound system developed by the Clair Brothers. In addition, co-founder Roy Clair assisted with the operation of the system, and Geoff Haslam was hired as the recording engineer alongside assistant Mike Dunn to work on &quot;Yessongs&quot;. As Offord was in charge of the band&#x27;s sound on stage, he could not operate the recording equipment at the same time. This resulted in recordings that he was disappointed with as they were substandard. When it was time for the album to be edited and remixed, Offord and the band retreated to studio 2 at Advision Studios in Fitzrovia, London to complete it. Howe recalled the group treated the mixing process with as much care and importance as one of their studio albums with careful consideration to the preparation of the various edits and the finished product.

===Dates and locations===

The liner notes do not list recording dates or locations, but audio comparisons of the album and the live box set &quot;&quot; (2015) can be made, in addition to the soundtrack to the &quot;Yessongs&quot; concert film. They are:

*19 and/or 23 February 1972 at the Academy of Music in New York City – &quot;Perpetual Change&quot; and &quot;Long Distance Runaround&quot;/&quot;The Fish (Schindleria Praematurus)&quot;
*1 November 1972 at Ottawa Civic Centre in Ottawa, Ontario – &quot;Roundabout&quot;
*12 November 1972 at Greensboro Coliseum in Greensboro, North Carolina – &quot;Heart of the Sunrise&quot;, &quot;And You and I&quot;, the second half of &quot;I&#x27;ve Seen All Good People&quot;
*14 November 1972 at University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia – &quot;Yours Is No Disgrace&quot;
*15 November 1972 at Knoxville Civic Coliseum in Knoxville, Tennessee – &quot;Siberian Khatru&quot;, the first two thirds of &quot;Excerpts from &#x27;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&#x27;&quot;
*20 November 1972 at Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, New York – &quot;Opening (Excerpt from &#x27;Firebird Suite&#x27;)&quot;, the final third of &quot;Excerpts from &#x27;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Mood for a Day&quot;
*15 and/or 16 December 1972 at the Rainbow Theatre in Finsbury Park, London – &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;, &quot;Starship Trooper&quot;

==Songs==
&quot;Yessongs&quot; begins with &quot;Opening (Excerpt from &#x27;Firebird Suite&#x27;)&quot;, the closing section to the orchestral work &quot;The Firebird&quot; by Russian composer Igor Stravinsky. Yes have used the piece as the introductory music to most of their concerts since 1971, the year of the composer&#x27;s death. The recording of the Suite heard on &quot;Yessongs&quot; is by the Boston Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Seiji Ozawa, first released in 1970 (RCA Red Seal – LSB 4009); it uses Stravinsky&#x27;s 1919 re-orchestration. The track segues into &quot;Siberian Khatru&quot; from &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;. &quot;Perpetual Change&quot; and &quot;Long Distance Runaround&quot;/&quot;The Fish (Schindleria Praematurus)&quot; were recorded during the Fragile Tour with Bruford on drums, and feature extended solos from Howe, Bruford and Squire compared to the studio versions. &quot;Excerpts from &#x27;The Six Wives of Henry VIII is a keyboard solo spot of excerpts from Wakeman&#x27;s first solo album &quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot; (1973), which he recorded during the &quot;Fragile&quot; and &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; tours and features Howe, Squire, Bruford, and White. The solo is preceded by Anderson singing notes from the opening of another Stravinsky orchestral piece, &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;.

==Artwork==

The album was originally presented in a gatefold sleeve with artwork designed and illustrated by the band&#x27;s longtime associate, artist Roger Dean. His brother Martyn was responsible for its layout and additional photography, featuring shots of each member performing in concert. Dean described the album as &quot;the most elaborate and complex package&quot; of his career at the time, which consisted of three albums worth of artwork and a booklet. The large space for Dean&#x27;s work allowed him to continue a theme that &quot;implied a story&quot; that he introduced on the cover of &quot;Fragile&quot;, which portrays a planet breaking into pieces and a spacecraft in flight. The narrative was continued on the sleeve of &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;. Dean recalled that talks about the artwork for &quot;Yessongs&quot; were scarce until he presented the group with a rough version of his &quot;Pathways&quot; painting, which was well received and influenced his decision to continue the narrative. However, Dean had to redesign a new broken planet to the one on &quot;Fragile&quot; as the pieces of land that break off were too square shaped, so the pieces seen on &quot;Yessongs&quot; are more triangular. The gatefold design involved complex paper folding that Dean described as &quot;a way of going from gatefold to any number of pages, folded out of one piece of card&quot;, and resulted in Dean and his printers, Tinsley Robor, filing a patent for that way of folding. Further development of the technique was cut short due to a subsequent national paper shortage.

The first painting, named &quot;Escape&quot;, shows the spacecraft and a planetary fragment drifting through space in the search for a new world. &quot;Arrival&quot; depicts these fragments landing in the waters of the new world, with &quot;Awakening&quot; showing signs of new life starting, including plant and animal species. The final image, &quot;Pathways&quot;, depicts the emergence of civilisation with a city in the background. The version with the girl sitting on top of the pathway structure was not in the original, and was painted separately and added later at the printing stage. While Dean was working on &quot;Pathways&quot;, his cat walked across the canvas whilst still wet and its paw prints can be seen in the sky area. Dean attempted to disguise them as clouds, but it failed to produce the desired results and he kept them in. After it was photographed for the sleeve, Dean&#x27;s cat urinated on the painting as it was standing against a wall, causing Dean to paint a new version that he said &quot;looked quite different&quot; to the version photographed.

In June 2013, Dean filed a $50 million lawsuit against director James Cameron for copyright and contributory infringement and unjust enrichment, claiming the design of Pandora, a fictional setting in Cameron&#x27;s epic science fiction film &quot;Avatar&quot; (2009) and the highest-grossing film at the time, was based on Dean&#x27;s paintings including &quot;Pathways&quot; and used without permission. The lawsuit was thrown out by judge Jesse M. Furman
in September 2014 who disagreed and believed the court found no substantial similarities between the film and Dean&#x27;s artwork.

==Release==

&quot;Yessongs&quot; was released in May 1973. its release was originally planned for February 1973, prior to the start of the band&#x27;s early 1973 North American tour, but delays in printing its cover led to its release pushed back. The band and Lane agreed to take a cut in royalties generated from the album so it could be sold at a lower price.

It peaked at number 7 on the UK Albums Chart and number 12 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. On 2 June 1973, the American magazine &quot;Cash Box&quot; reported that the album had reached gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for selling 500,000 copies in the US. In 1998, the album was certified platinum for shipping one million copies, becoming one of the band&#x27;s highest selling records.

In an overall positive review for &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;, Richard Cromelin said that although some of the live renditions are sub-par to their studio versions, it presented some &quot;excellent and rarely-heard pieces&quot; that make the listener &quot;really feel the people behind the music&quot; which in turn makes up for the &quot;occasional sloppiness&quot;. Cromelin praised the album for the &quot;stunning improvisations&quot; and interplay within the band which dispels those who criticise Yes for being &quot;dry and mechanical&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; published a positive review, noting the album shows the band at &quot;their exciting best&quot;. Band biographer Tim Morse thought the album&#x27;s downfall was its substandard audio quality despite the band&#x27;s strong performances.

==Reissues==
&quot;Yessongs&quot; has been reissued several times:

* 1987 – 2-disc CD reissue on Atlantic Records

<doc id="1313639" wikidata="Q1041630" url="?curid=1313639" title="Skyrmion">
<text>In particle theory, the skyrmion () is a topologically stable field configuration of a certain class of non-linear sigma models. It was originally proposed as a model of the nucleon by (and named after) Tony Skyrme in 1961. As a topological soliton in the pion field, it has the remarkable property of being able to model, with reasonable accuracy, multiple low-energy properties of the nucleon, simply by fixing the nucleon radius. It has since found application in solid-state physics, as well as having ties to certain areas of string theory.

Skyrmions as topological objects are important in solid-state physics, especially in the emerging technology of spintronics. A two-dimensional magnetic skyrmion, as a topological object, is formed, e.g., from a 3D effective-spin &quot;hedgehog&quot; (in the field of micromagnetics: out of a so-called &quot;Bloch point&quot; singularity of homotopy degree +1) by a stereographic projection, whereby the positive north-pole spin is mapped onto a far-off edge circle of a 2D-disk, while the negative south-pole spin is mapped onto the center of the disk. In a spinor field such as for example photonic or polariton fluids the skyrmion topology corresponds to a full Poincaré beam (a spin vortex comprising all the states of polarization mapped by a stereographic projection of the Poincaré sphere to the real plane). A dynamical pseudospin skyrmion results from the stereographic projection of a rotating polariton Bloch sphere in the case of dynamical full Bloch beams.

Skyrmions have been reported, but not conclusively proven, to appear in Bose–Einstein condensates, thin magnetic films, and chiral nematic liquid crystals, as well as in free-space optics.

As a model of the nucleon, the topological stability of the skyrmion can be interpreted as a statement that the baryon number is conserved; i.e. that the proton does not decay. The Skyrme Lagrangian is essentially a one-parameter model of the nucleon. Fixing the parameter fixes the proton radius, and also fixes all other low-energy properties, which appear to be correct to about 30%, a significant level of predictive power.

Hollowed-out skyrmions form the basis for the chiral bag model (Cheshire Cat model) of the nucleon. The exact results for the duality between the fermion spectrum and the topological winding number of the non-linear sigma model have been obtained by Dan Freed. This can be interpreted as a foundation for the duality between a quantum chromodynamics (QCD) description of the nucleon (but consisting only of quarks, and without gluons) and the Skyrme model for the nucleon.

The skyrmion can be quantized to form a quantum superposition of baryons and resonance states. It could be predicted from some nuclear matter properties.

==Topological soliton==
In field theory, skyrmions are homotopically non-trivial classical solutions of a nonlinear sigma model with a non-trivial target manifold topology – hence, they are topological solitons. An example occurs in chiral models of mesons, where the target manifold is a homogeneous space of the structure group

: formula_1

where SU(&quot;N&quot;)&quot;L&quot; and SU(&quot;N&quot;)&quot;R&quot; are the left and right chiral symmetries, and SU(&quot;N&quot;)diag is the diagonal subgroup. In nuclear physics, for &quot;N&quot; = 2, the chiral symmetries are understood to be the isospin symmetry of the nucleon. For &quot;N&quot; = 3, the isoflavor symmetry between the up, down and strange quarks is more broken, and the skyrmion models are less successful or accurate.

If spacetime has the topology S3×R, then classical configurations can be classified by an integral winding number because the third homotopy group

: formula_2

is equivalent to the ring of integers, with the congruence sign referring to homeomorphism.

A topological term can be added to the chiral Lagrangian, whose integral depends only upon the homotopy class; this results in superselection sectors in the quantised model. In (1 + 1)-dimensional spacetime, a skyrmion can be approximated by a soliton of the Sine–Gordon equation; after quantisation by the Bethe ansatz or otherwise, it turns into a fermion interacting according to the massive Thirring model.

== Lagrangian ==
The Lagrangian for the skyrmion, as written for the original chiral SU(2) effective Lagrangian of the nucleon-nucleon interaction (in (3 + 1)-dimensional spacetime), can be written as
: formula_3
where formula_4, formula_5, formula_6 are the isospin Pauli matrices, formula_7 is the Lie bracket commutator, and tr is the matrix trace. The meson field (pion field, up to a dimensional factor) at spacetime coordinate formula_8 is given by formula_9. A broad review of the geometric interpretation of formula_10 is presented in the article on sigma models.

When written this way, the formula_11 is clearly an element of the Lie group SU(2), and formula_12 an element of the Lie algebra su(2). The pion field can be understood abstractly to be a section of the tangent bundle of the principal fiber bundle of SU(2) over spacetime. This abstract interpretation is characteristic of all non-linear sigma models.

The first term, formula_13 is just an unusual way of writing the quadratic term of the non-linear sigma model; it reduces to formula_14. When used as a model of the nucleon, one writes

: formula_15

with the dimensional factor of formula_16 being the pion decay constant. (In 1 + 1 dimensions, this constant is not dimensional and can thus be absorbed into the field definition.)

The second term establishes the characteristic size of the lowest-energy soliton solution; it determines the effective radius of the soliton. As a model of the nucleon, it is normally adjusted so as to give the correct radius for the proton; once this is done, other low-energy properties of the nucleon are automatically fixed, to within about 30% accuracy. It is this result, of tying together what would otherwise be independent parameters, and doing so fairly accurately, that makes the Skyrme model of the nucleon so appealing and interesting. Thus, for example, constant formula_17 in the quartic term is interpreted as the vector-pion coupling ρ–π–π between the rho meson (the nuclear vector meson) and the pion; the skyrmion relates the value of this constant to the baryon radius.

==Topological charge or winding number==
The local winding number density (or topological charge density) is given by
: formula_18

where formula_19 is the totally antisymmetric Levi-Civita symbol (equivalently, the Hodge star, in this context).

As a physical quantity, this can be interpreted as the baryon current; it is conserved: formula_20, and the conservation follows as a Noether current for the chiral symmetry.

The corresponding charge is the baryon number:

: formula_21
Which is conserved due to topological reasons and it is always an integer. For this reason, it is associated with the baryon number of the nucleus. 
As a conserved charge, it is time-independent: formula_22, the physical interpretation of which is that protons do not decay.

In the chiral bag model, one cuts a hole out of the center and fills it with quarks. Despite this obvious &quot;hackery&quot;, the total baryon number is conserved: the missing charge from the hole is exactly compensated by the spectral asymmetry of the vacuum fermions inside the bag.

==Magnetic materials/data storage==
One particular form of skyrmions is magnetic skyrmions, found in magnetic materials that exhibit spiral magnetism due to the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction, double-exchange mechanism or competing Heisenberg exchange interactions. They form &quot;domains&quot; as small as 1 nm (e.g. in Fe on Ir(111)). The small size and low energy consumption of magnetic skyrmions make them a good candidate for future data-storage solutions and other spintronics devices.
Researchers could read and write skyrmions using scanning tunneling microscopy. The topological charge, representing the existence and non-existence of skyrmions, can represent the bit states &quot;1&quot; and &quot;0&quot;. Room-temperature skyrmions were reported.

Skyrmions operate at current densities that are several orders of magnitude weaker than conventional magnetic devices. In 2015 a practical way to create and access magnetic skyrmions under ambient room-temperature conditions was announced. The device used arrays of magnetized cobalt disks as artificial Bloch skyrmion lattices atop a thin film of cobalt and palladium. Asymmetric magnetic nanodots were patterned with controlled circularity on an underlayer with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). Polarity is controlled by a tailored magnetic-field sequence and demonstrated in magnetometry measurements. The vortex structure is imprinted into the underlayer&#x27;s interfacial region by suppressing the PMA by a critical ion-irradiation step. The lattices are identified with polarized neutron reflectometry and have been confirmed by magnetoresistance measurements.

A recent (2019) study demonstrated a way to move skyrmions, purely using electric field (in the absence of electric current). The authors used Co/Ni multilayers with a thickness slope and Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction and demonstrated skyrmions. They showed that the displacement and velocity depended directly on the applied voltage.

In 2020, a team of researchers from the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (Empa) has succeeded for the first time in producing a tunable multilayer system in which two different types of skyrmions – the future bits for &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; – can exist at room temperature.

<doc id="1313642" wikidata="Q566789" url="?curid=1313642" title="Hatto I">
<text>Hatto I (c. 850 – 15 May 913) was Archbishop of Mainz (Mayence) from 891 until his death.
==Family and early life==
Hatto belonged to a Swabian family, and was probably educated at the monastery of Reichenau, of which he became abbot in 888. He was also abbot of Ellwangen Abbey.
==Counsellor of Arnulf of Carinthia==
Hatto soon became known to the German king, Arnulf, who appointed him archbishop of Mainz in 891, and he became such a trustworthy and loyal counsellor that he was popularly called the heart of the king. He presided over the important synod at Tribur in 895 and accompanied the king to Italy in 894 and 895, where he was received with great favor by Pope Formosus. In 899, when Arnulf died, Hatto became regent of the Empire and guardian of the young king, Louis the Child, whose authority he compelled Zwentibold, duke of Lorraine, an illegitimate son of Arnulf, to recognize.
==Execution of Adalbert of Babenberg==
During these years Hatto did not neglect his own interests, for in 896 he secured for himself the abbey of Ellwangen and in 898 that of Lorsch. He assisted the Franconian family of the Conradines in its feud with the Babenbergs for supremacy in Franconia; after the battle of Fritzlar on 9 September 906 between the Babenbergs and Conradines he arranged for the capture and execution of Count Adalbert of Babenberg, breaking his promise of safe conduct. 
==Failed attempt to assassinate Henry the Fowler==
Hatto retained his influence during the entire reign of Louis the Child and on the king&#x27;s death in 911 was prominent in securing the election of Conrad, duke of Franconia, to the vacant throne. When trouble arose between Conrad and Henry the Fowler, duke of Saxony, afterwards King Henry I, the attitude of Conrad was ascribed by the Saxons to the influence of Hatto, who wished to prevent Henry from securing authority in Thuringia, where the see of Mainz had extensive possessions. He was accused of complicity in a plot to murder Henry, who in return ravaged the archiepiscopal lands in Saxony and Thuringia.
==Legends about his death at Mount Etna==
Hatto died on 15 May 913, one legend saying he was struck by lightning, and another that he was thrown alive by the devil into the crater of Mount Etna. His memory was long regarded in Saxony with great abhorrence, and stories of cruelty and treachery gathered round his name.
==Legend of the Mouse Tower==
The legend of the Mouse Tower at Bingen is connected with Hatto I and Hatto II, who was archbishop of Mainz from 968 to 970. This latter Hatto built the church of St. George on the island of Reichenau, was generous to the see of Mainz and to the abbeys of Fulda and Reichenau, and was a patron of the chronicler Regino, abbot of Prum.

<doc id="1313643" wikidata="Q1588738" url="?curid=1313643" title="Love in Excess; or, The Fatal Enquiry">
<text>Love in Excess (1719–20) is Eliza Haywood&#x27;s best known novel. It details the amorous escapades of Count D&#x27;Elmont, a rake who becomes reformed over the course of the novel. &quot;Love in Excess&quot; was a huge bestseller in its time, going through multiple reissues in the four years following its initial publication. It was once compared in terms of book sales with &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; and &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;. This information was later shown to be incorrect; the novel selling only about 6000 copies over 23 years.

==Summary==

The first part of the novel details the rivalry between Alovisa and Amena, two upper-class young women, for the Count D&#x27;Elmont&#x27;s attention. The narrator mentions the &quot;custom which forbids women to make a declaration of their thoughts.&quot; This is important to both the plot and the theme of the novel. Alovisa writes an unsigned letter to D&#x27;Elmont. This inadvertently leads D&#x27;Elmont to court Amena instead. Amena&#x27;s father refuses to allow his daughter to continue meeting with D&#x27;Elmont without a proposal of marriage. During one of their secret meetings, the pair are compromised by the intervention of Alovisa&#x27;s servant, Charlo, who awakens Amena&#x27;s household. Alovisa feigns desire to help the pair by allowing them to meet in her apartment; however, Alovisa colludes with Amena&#x27;s father to ship Amena off to a convent in the countryside. D&#x27;Elmont, in the meanwhile, has left to receive his brother, Chevalier Brillian. During the course of their conversation, it is revealed that the Chevalier has fallen in love with Alovisa&#x27;s sister Ansellina (who resides in Amiens).

Part the Second deals with D&#x27;Elmont&#x27;s falling in &quot;true&quot; love with Melliora, a girl entrusted in his care. At the first sight of &quot;the matchless Melliora&quot;, his &quot;impregnable&quot; heart &quot;surrendered&quot;. The Baron D&#x27;Espernay, a close friend of D&#x27;Elmont, helps him plot to seduce Melliora—in part because he desires Alovisa for himself. D&#x27;Espernay plans a ball, during which D&#x27;Elmont is arranged to have access to Melliora, but Melantha, D&#x27;Espernay&#x27;s sister, is enamored with D&#x27;Elmont and takes Melliora&#x27;s room. When D&#x27;Elmont enters what he thinks is Melliora&#x27;s chamber, he instead ravishes the too-willing Melantha. Alovisa, certain that D&#x27;Espernay can help her discover the identity of her husband&#x27;s lover, agrees to trade sexual favors for this knowledge. In the chaos of the evening, Alovisa ends up running into D&#x27;Elmont&#x27;s sword.

Part the Third commences with the aftermath of Alovisa&#x27;s death; D&#x27;Elmont ends up in Italy, yearning endlessly for Melliora, while Melliora returns to the monastery where she was educated. Later, D&#x27;Elmont intervenes to rescue a stranger from certain death, killing a masked bravo, or &quot;hired murderer&quot;, and narrowly escaping with his own life. To avoid being implicated, D&#x27;Elmont flees, stumbling into a garden belonging to his secret admirer. D&#x27;Elmont is confronted by Melliora&#x27;s brother, Frankville, for tarnishing her reputation. Frankville is revealed to be the stranger whose life D&#x27;Elmont saved earlier on. Despite being affianced to Violetta (the chaste &quot;good&quot; woman), Frankville had fallen in love with a woman named Camilla, inciting the vengeance of Violetta&#x27;s villainous father Cittolini, who is described as a &quot;possessor of immense riches&quot;. D&#x27;Elmont attempts to assist Frankville by secretly delivering a letter to Camilla, who lives with Ciamara, the temptress who wrote to D&#x27;Elmont. Ciamara (the lusty &quot;bad&quot; woman) attempts to seduce D&#x27;Elmont when he mistakes her for Camilla, and this causes Frankville to spurn Camilla. Attempting to rectify this confusion, D&#x27;Elmont presents himself to Ciamara as a decoy long enough for Frankville to forcibly gain access to Camilla&#x27;s quarters. But Camilla is unmoved by Frankville&#x27;s pleading, and Frankville and D&#x27;Elmont narrowly escape an attack from Ciamara&#x27;s servants. While Violetta was engaged to Frankville, she inevitably falls in love with D&#x27;Elmont and seeks to reunite Frankville and Camilla.

Receiving word that Melliora has been kidnapped from the monastery, and learning through Violetta of Ciamara and Cittolini&#x27;s revenge plot, D&#x27;Elmont, Frankville, and Camilla flee Rome, accompanied by Fidelio, who is actually Violetta disguised as a pageboy. They learn that Ciamara had poisoned herself out of grief, and Violetta&#x27;s vengeful father has also died. En route to Paris, the travelers—burdened by Fidelio who has fallen ill—take shelter from a storm with a wealthy gentleman, the Marquess D&#x27;Saguillier. D&#x27;Elmont is surprised in bed by Melliora, who reveals the events leading to her kidnapping: Betrothed to Melliora&#x27;s friend, Charlotta, the Marquess instead desired Melliora and abducted her. Melliora secures her own freedom to leave with D&#x27;Elmont through an elaborate plot. Meanwhile, Fidelio is revealed to be Violetta, and she professes her undying love for D&#x27;Elmont on her deathbed. Violetta&#x27;s fidelity is rewarded, as the Marquess D&#x27;Saguillier and Charlotta, Frankville and Camilla, and D&#x27;elmont and Melliora are wed. D&#x27;Elmont returns to Paris, where he is reunited with his brother. D&#x27;Elmont and Melliora are &quot;still living, ... great and lovely examples of conjugal affection.&quot;

==Major themes==
A work of amatory fiction, &quot;Love in Excess&quot; offers many models of female desire, and ultimately articulates the early-18th century &quot;cultural shift toward a companionate model of marriage.&quot; Like Aphra Behn and Delarivier Manley, Haywood uses love triangles to illustrate the different roles women can play. Exploring the conflict between social expectations and individual desires, Haywood&#x27;s novel illustrates how female desire is silenced by public norms. According to David Oakleaf, Haywood &quot;laments that women cannot, like men, express their desire directly&quot;. Although &quot;Love in Excess&quot; is known for its female characters, Count D&#x27;elmont is also an important character. Count Delmont is a &quot;male version&quot; of women who inspire sexual desire but are indifferent to their admirers.

== Publication history ==
&quot;Love in Excess,&quot; one of Haywood&#x27;s&#x27; first and most popular novels, was published in three parts, by William Chetwood. Between 1719 and 1742 the novel was printed in six editions. Holly Luhning explains the publication history of &quot;Love in Excess&quot;, which was one of the most successful popular novels in the eighteenth century, through the prefatory poems. In the first part of the book, Chetwood included a dedicatory letter by the famous actress Anne Oldfield, instead of indicating that Haywood was the author. However, her name appeared in the second part and the third parts of her novel. In addition to this dedicatory letter, Chetwood also included several prefatory poems. The poems flatter Haywood&#x27;s narrative skills and her ability to present &quot;the power of physical and emotional love&quot;. The poems that were published in the early editions praised &quot;Love in Excess&quot;, but in the 6th edition, they also noticed Haywood&#x27;s body of work, suggesting her higher reputation as a writer. Positive reaction to her work influenced more women to publish.

<text>Michael Otto (born 12 April 1943), is the chairman of the supervisory board of Germany&#x27;s Otto Group, one of world&#x27;s largest mail order companies, with €15.6 billion in revenue in 2021.

==Early life==
He earned doctorates from the University of Hamburg and the University of Munich.

==Career==
Otto Group was founded by his father, the late Werner Otto, as a mail-order business in Hamburg in 1949.

They were the former owners of Spiegel, Inc. (the parent company of Eddie Bauer and former owners of Spiegel catalog), which filed for bankruptcy on 17 March 2003. On 25 May 2005, Spiegel, Inc. emerged from bankruptcy, was renamed Eddie Bauer Holdings, and is now owned primarily by Commerzbank. The Otto Group no longer has any stake in the company.

Otto and his family own extensive real estate in Canada and in the United States, shopping centers in Germany and part of home-furnishings chain Crate &amp; Barrel. Known as a committed environmentalist, his company has long touted environmentally safe products. In 1993, he created the Michael Otto Foundation (German: Michael Otto Stiftung). This foundation played, and is still playing, an important role in furthering multi-stakeholder dialogue on hot environmental issues. Otto is also a member of the World Future Council.

Otto is president of the Foundation 2°, which promotes a transition towards a carbon-free economic system. He once stated about this transition: &quot;Understanding climate protection as a modernisation project for the economy can now play an important role in overcoming the consequences of the Corona crisis – and at the same time help to avoid profound negative impacts of the climate crisis.&quot;

==Personal life==
Otto is married, with two children, and lives in Hamburg, Germany.

<text>The Lesse is a river in the Ardennes, in the Walloon region of Belgium. It is a right tributary to the river Meuse.

The source of the Lesse is near Libramont-Chevigny, in the Belgian province of Luxembourg. The Lesse flows roughly in north-western direction. Near Han-sur-Lesse (municipality of Rochefort) the entire river goes underground, flowing through limestone caves. Many of the caves along the banks of the Lesse are important archaeological sites; these include the Trou de Chaleux (by the Cirque de Chaleux), and the Trou des Nutons and Trou du Frontal at Furfooz. The Lesse flows into the river Meuse in the village of Anseremme, municipality of Dinant. Towns along the Lesse are Daverdisse, Han-sur-Lesse, Houyet and Anseremme.

<doc id="1313664" wikidata="Q570412" url="?curid=1313664" title="Selection rule">
<text>In physics and chemistry, a selection rule, or transition rule, formally constrains the possible transitions of a system from one quantum state to another. Selection rules have been derived for electromagnetic transitions in molecules, in atoms, in atomic nuclei, and so on. The selection rules may differ according to the technique used to observe the transition. The selection rule also plays a role in chemical reactions, where some are formally spin-forbidden reactions, that is, reactions where the spin state changes at least once from reactants to products.

In the following, mainly atomic and molecular transitions are considered.

== Overview ==
In quantum mechanics the basis for a spectroscopic selection rule is the value of the &quot;transition moment integral&quot; 
:formula_1
where formula_2 and formula_3 are the wave functions of the two states, &quot;state 1&quot; and &quot;state 2&quot;, involved in the transition, and is the transition moment operator. This integral represents the propagator (and thus the probability) of the transition between states 1 and 2; if the value of this integral is &quot;zero&quot; then the transition is &quot;forbidden&quot;.

In practice, to determine a selection rule the integral itself does not need to be calculated: It is sufficient to determine the symmetry of the &quot;transition moment function&quot; formula_4 
If the transition moment function is symmetric over all of the totally symmetric representation of the point group to which the atom or molecule belongs, then the integral&#x27;s value is (in general) &quot;not&quot; zero and the transition &quot;is&quot; allowed. Otherwise, the transition is &quot;forbidden&quot;.

The transition moment integral is zero if the &quot;transition moment function&quot;, formula_5 is anti-symmetric or odd, i.e. formula_6 holds. The symmetry of the transition moment function is the direct product of the parities of its three components. The symmetry characteristics of each component can be obtained from standard character tables. Rules for obtaining the symmetries of a direct product can be found in texts on character tables.
== Examples ==

=== Electronic spectra ===
The Laporte rule is a selection rule formally stated as follows: In a centrosymmetric environment, transitions between like atomic orbitals such as &quot;s&quot;-&quot;s&quot;, &quot;p&quot;-&quot;p&quot;, &quot;d&quot;-&quot;d&quot;, or &quot;f&quot;-&quot;f,&quot; transitions are forbidden. The Laporte rule (law) applies to electric dipole transitions, so the operator has &quot;u&quot; symmetry (meaning &quot;ungerade&quot;, odd). &quot;p&quot; orbitals also have &quot;u&quot; symmetry, so the symmetry of the transition moment function is given by the product (formally, the product is taken in the group)
&quot;u&quot;×&quot;u&quot;×&quot;u&quot;, which has &quot;u&quot; symmetry. The transitions are therefore forbidden. Likewise, &quot;d&quot; orbitals have &quot;g&quot; symmetry (meaning &quot;gerade&quot;, even), so the triple product &quot;g&quot;×&quot;u&quot;×&quot;g&quot; also has &quot;u&quot; symmetry and the transition is forbidden.

The wave function of a single electron is the product of a space-dependent wave function and a spin wave function. Spin is directional and can be said to have odd parity. It follows that transitions in which the spin &quot;direction&quot; changes are forbidden. In formal terms, only states with the same total spin quantum number are &quot;spin-allowed&quot;. In crystal field theory, &quot;d&quot;-&quot;d&quot; transitions that are spin-forbidden are much weaker than spin-allowed transitions. Both can be observed, in spite of the Laporte rule, because the actual transitions are coupled to vibrations that are anti-symmetric and have the same symmetry as the dipole moment operator.

=== Vibrational spectra ===

In vibrational spectroscopy, transitions are observed between different vibrational states. In a fundamental vibration, the molecule is excited from its ground state (&quot;v&quot; = 0) to the first excited state (&quot;v&quot; = 1). The symmetry of the ground-state wave function is the same as that of the molecule. It is, therefore, a basis for the totally symmetric representation in the point group of the molecule. It follows that, for a vibrational transition to be allowed, the symmetry of the excited state wave function must be the same as the symmetry of the transition moment operator.

In infrared spectroscopy, the transition moment operator transforms as either &quot;x&quot; and/or &quot;y&quot; and/or &quot;z&quot;. The excited state wave function must also transform as at least one of these vectors. In Raman spectroscopy, the operator transforms as one of the second-order terms in the right-most column of the character table, below.
The molecule methane, CH4, may be used as an example to illustrate the application of these principles. The molecule is tetrahedral and has &quot;Td&quot; symmetry. The vibrations of methane span the representations A1 + E + 2T2. Examination of the character table shows that all four vibrations are Raman-active, but only the T2 vibrations can be seen in the infrared spectrum.

In the harmonic approximation, it can be shown that overtones are forbidden in both infrared and Raman spectra. However, when anharmonicity is taken into account, the transitions are weakly allowed.

In Raman and infrared spectroscopy, the selection rules predict certain vibrational modes to have zero intensities in the Raman and/or the IR. Displacements from the ideal structure can result in relaxation of the selection rules and appearance of these unexpected phonon modes in the spectra. Therefore, the appearance of new modes in the spectra can be a useful indicator of symmetry breakdown.

=== Rotational spectra ===

The selection rule for rotational transitions, derived from the symmetries of the rotational wave functions in a rigid rotor, is Δ&quot;J&quot; = ±1, where &quot;J&quot; is a rotational quantum number.

=== Coupled transitions ===
There are many types of coupled transition such as are observed in vibration–rotation spectra. The excited-state wave function is the product of two wave functions such as vibrational and rotational. The general principle is that the symmetry of the excited state is obtained as the direct product of the symmetries of the component wave functions. In rovibronic transitions, the excited states involve three wave functions.

The infrared spectrum of hydrogen chloride gas shows rotational fine structure superimposed on the vibrational spectrum. This is typical of the infrared spectra of heteronuclear diatomic molecules. It shows the so-called &quot;P&quot; and &quot;R&quot; branches. The &quot;Q&quot; branch, located at the vibration frequency, is absent. Symmetric top molecules display the &quot;Q&quot; branch. This follows from the application of selection rules.

Resonance Raman spectroscopy involves a kind of vibronic coupling. It results in much-increased intensity of fundamental and overtone transitions as the vibrations &quot;steal&quot; intensity from an allowed electronic transition. In spite of appearances, the selection rules are the same as in Raman spectroscopy.

=== Angular momentum ===
In general, electric (charge) radiation or magnetic (current, magnetic moment) radiation can be classified into multipoles E (electric) or M (magnetic) of order 2, e.g., E1 for electric dipole, E2 for quadrupole, or E3 for octupole. In transitions where the change in angular momentum between the initial and final states makes several multipole radiations possible, usually the lowest-order multipoles are overwhelmingly more likely, and dominate the transition.

The emitted particle carries away angular momentum, with quantum number , which for the photon must be at least 1, since it is a vector particle (i.e., it has  = 1− ). Thus, there is no radiation from E0 (electric monopoles) or M0 (magnetic monopoles, which do not seem to exist).

Since the total angular momentum has to be conserved during the transition, we have that
:formula_7
where formula_8 and its z-projection is given by formula_9 and where formula_10 and formula_11 are, respectively, the initial and final angular momenta of the atom. 
The corresponding quantum numbers and (-axis angular momentum) must satisfy
:formula_12
and
:formula_13

Parity is also preserved. For electric multipole transitions 
:formula_14
while for magnetic multipoles
:formula_15
Thus, parity does not change for E-even or M-odd multipoles, while it changes for E-odd or M-even multipoles.

These considerations generate different sets of transitions rules depending on the multipole order and type. The expression &quot;forbidden transitions&quot; is often used, but this does not mean that these transitions &quot;cannot&quot; occur, only that they are &quot;electric-dipole-forbidden&quot;. These transitions are perfectly possible; they merely occur at a lower rate. If the rate for an E1 transition is non-zero, the transition is said to be permitted; if it is zero, then M1, E2, etc. transitions can still produce radiation, albeit with much lower transitions rates. The transition rate decreases by a factor of about 1000 from one multipole to the next one, so the lowest multipole transitions are most likely to occur.

Semi-forbidden transitions (resulting in so-called intercombination lines) are electric dipole (E1) transitions for which the selection rule that the spin does not change is violated. This is a result of the failure of LS coupling.

==== Summary table ====
formula_16 is the total angular momentum, 
formula_17 is the azimuthal quantum number, 
formula_18 is the spin quantum number, and
formula_19 is the secondary total angular momentum quantum number.
Which transitions are allowed is based on the hydrogen-like atom. The symbol formula_20 is used to indicate a forbidden transition.

In hyperfine structure, the total angular momentum of the atom is formula_21 where formula_22 is the nuclear spin angular momentum and formula_23 is the total angular momentum of the electron(s). Since formula_24 has a similar mathematical form as formula_25 it obeys a selection rule table similar to the table above.

=== Surface ===
In surface vibrational spectroscopy, the &quot;surface selection rule&quot; is applied to identify the peaks observed in vibrational spectra. When a molecule is adsorbed on a substrate, the molecule induces opposite image charges in the substrate. The dipole moment of the molecule and the image charges perpendicular to the surface reinforce each other. In contrast, the dipole moments of the molecule and the image charges parallel to the surface cancel out. Therefore, only molecular vibrational peaks giving rise to a dynamic dipole moment perpendicular to the surface will be observed in the vibrational spectrum.

<doc id="1313667" wikidata="Q451128" url="?curid=1313667" title="Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller">
<text>Arnold Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller (; 13 July 1913 – 16 April 2012) was a Danish shipping magnate. He was a longtime figure at A.P. Moller–Maersk Group, which was founded by his father.

==Personal life==
Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller was born in Hellerup, the son of a Danish father, Arnold Peter Møller, founder of the A.P. Moller–Maersk Group and an American mother of Irish and German descent, Chastine Estelle Roberta (née McKinney) Møller. Mærsk married his high-school sweetheart, Emma Neergaard Rasmussen in 1940 and remained married to her until her death in 2005. They had three daughters: Leise (born 1941), Kirsten, Mrs Olufsen (born 1944), and Ane, Mrs Uggla (born 1948). He ranked 557th-wealthiest person in the world (2007) on the Forbes list with an estimated fortune of 142 billion Danish kroner, which made him the wealthiest person in Denmark until his death.

==Business activities==
Møller became a partner in the A.P. Moller–Maersk Group in 1940. When Denmark was occupied by Germany during World War II Møller went into exile in the United States and ran the family business from New York until his return to Denmark in 1947. Møller became CEO and chairman on his father&#x27;s death in 1965. In 1970, Møller became the first non-American member of the board of IBM, a position he held until 1984.

Møller stepped down as CEO in 1993 in favour of Jess Søderberg, but stayed on as chairman of the board until 2003 when, at age 90, he retired completely. He personally controlled a substantial portion of the company&#x27;s shares until his death. At his death he was Denmark&#x27;s second-richest man after Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, according to the Forbes List of Billionaires 2007. This is disputed by the Danish financial magazine Berlingske Nyhedsmagasin, which placed Møller as number one in Denmark and estimated his fortune in 2006 as 141.2 billion DKK, and his personal wealth at 7.0 billion DKK. Most of Møller&#x27;s fortune was placed in foundations controlling the A.P. Moller–Maersk Group, in which he held a controlling interest.

===North Sea oil===
In 1962, A.P. Møller–Maersk A/S was granted concession to survey and exploit oil and natural gas resources in Denmark, rendering a monopoly-like status to Maersk. The 40-year agreement was renewed in 2003, causing some discussion. The levy paid to the state is not influenced by fluctuating oil price, meaning Maersk could gain a much larger profit in times with high oil prices. The levy is 69 percent, lower than Norway&#x27;s (80 percent). The UK raised the oil levy in 2006 due to high prices. As of November 2007, the price of oil had risen from US$22 to $96 per barrel, since the agreement of 2003, meaning that in 40 years&#x27; time, the company would not just earn the expected profit of 87 billion kroner, but 346 billion kroner, overall. Government parties declined to change the agreement or raise the oil levy. The oil and gas was reclaimed by Mærsks Olie og Gas A/S and Dansk Undergrunds Consortium (DUC), owned by A.P. Møller–Maersk A/S (39%), a subcompany of Royal Dutch Shell (46%) and Chevron Denmark Inc. (15%).

The company is a major contributor to the Conservative People&#x27;s Party and Venstre, the two parties forming Denmark&#x27;s governing coalition from 2001 to 2011. Smaller contributions have been paid to other political parties, including the Danish Social Liberal Party, Danish People&#x27;s Party, and formerly the Centre Democrats and the Progress Party. 

=== Succession ===
Upon his death, his youngest daughter Ane Mærsk Mc-Kinney Uggla took over as chairperson of the controlling foundation of Maersk, and announced a plan to keep the organization mostly the same as a conglomerate of loosely-related businesses.

==Philanthropy==

The Copenhagen Opera House, at a cost of 2.3 billion kroner, is one of the most expensive opera houses ever built; it was donated by The A.P. Møller and Chastine Mc-Kinney Møller Foundation. It is situated directly across the harbour from the royal residence, Amalienborg Palace, and within sight of his Maersk headquarters. In the same area, Møller donated Amaliehaven, a park between the Palace and the harbour, in the 1980s.

==Death==
Møller died on 16 April 2012, aged 98, just four days after his last public appearance. He was survived by his three daughters.

==Distinctions and accolades==
Møller was a knight of the Danish Order of the Elephant (awarded 15 December 2000); he was, during his membership of the order, the only person who was neither royal nor a head of state to hold this honour (the nuclear physicist Niels Bohr and founder of the East Asiatic Company Hans Niels Andersen held the same order), which granted him the title His Excellency. He was awarded the honour of Life Honorary Membership of the Baltic Exchange in recognition of his service to shipping by the Baltic. AP Møller-Maersk has conducted business through Baltic Exchange brokers since the early 20th century and its London company has been a Baltic member since 1951.

The &quot;Maersk 2013&quot;, a new Triple E-class container ship (165,000 metric tons deadweight), IMO:9619907, yard number 4250, ship name &quot;Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller&quot;, was named for Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller.

<doc id="1313668" wikidata="Q2747504" url="?curid=1313668" title="Military history of France">
<text>The military history of France encompasses an immense panorama of conflicts and struggles extending for more than 2,000 years across areas including modern France, Europe, and a variety of regions throughout the world.

According to historian Niall Ferguson, France is the most successful military power in history. It participated in 50 of the 125 major European wars that have been fought since 1495; more than any other European state. The first major recorded wars in the territory of modern-day France itself revolved around the Gallo-Roman conflict that predominated from 60 BC to 50 BC. The Romans eventually emerged victorious through the campaigns of Julius Caesar. After the decline of the Roman Empire, a Germanic tribe known as the Franks took control of Gaul by defeating competing tribes. The &quot;land of Francia&quot;, from which France gets its name, had high points of expansion under kings Clovis I and Charlemagne, who established the nucleus of the future French state. In the Middle Ages, rivalries with England prompted major conflicts such as the Norman Conquest and the Hundred Years&#x27; War. With an increasingly centralized monarchy, the first standing army since Roman times, and the use of artillery, France expelled the English from its territory and came out of the Middle Ages as the most powerful nation in Europe, only to lose that status to the Holy Roman Empire and Spain following defeat in the Italian Wars. The Wars of Religion crippled France in the late 16th century, but a major victory over Spain in the Thirty Years&#x27; War made France the most powerful nation on the continent once more. In parallel, France developed its first colonial empire in Asia, Africa, and in the Americas. Under Louis XIV France achieved military supremacy over its rivals, but escalating conflicts against increasingly powerful enemy coalitions checked French ambitions and left the kingdom bankrupt at the opening of the 18th century.

Resurgent French armies secured victories in dynastic conflicts against the Spanish, Polish, and Austrian crowns. At the same time, France was fending off attacks on its colonies. As the 18th century advanced, global competition with Great Britain led to the Seven Years&#x27; War, where France lost its North American holdings. Consolation came in the form of dominance in Europe and the American Revolutionary War, where extensive French aid in the form of money and arms, and the direct participation of its army and navy led to the independence of the United States. Internal political upheaval eventually led to 23 years of nearly continuous conflict in the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. France reached the zenith of its power during this period, dominating the European continent in an unprecedented fashion under Napoleon Bonaparte. However, France was ultimately defeated in 1815, and its borders were restored to the same ones it controlled before the Revolution. The rest of the 19th century witnessed the growth of the Second French colonial empire as well as French interventions in Belgium, Spain, and Mexico. Other major wars were fought against Russia in the Crimea, Austria in Italy, and Prussia within France itself.

Following defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, Franco-German rivalry erupted again in the First World War. France and its allies were victorious this time. Social, political, and economic upheaval in the wake of the conflict led to the Second World War, in which France and the Allies were defeated in the Battle of France and almost half of the country was placed under German military occupation for more than four years. The Allies, including the Free French Forces led by a government in exile, eventually emerged victorious over the Axis Powers. As a result, France secured an occupation zone in Germany and a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. The imperative of avoiding a third Franco-German conflict on the scale of the first two world wars paved the way for European integration starting in the 1950s. France became a nuclear power and, since the late 20th century, has cooperated closely with NATO, the United States and European partners.

==Dominant themes==
Historian Niall Ferguson argues that France is the most belligerent military power in history. It participated in 50 of the 125 major European wars fought since 1495; more than any other European state. It is followed by Austria which fought in 47 of them; Spain in 44; and England in 43. Out of the 169 most important world battles fought since 387 BC, France has won 109, lost 49 and drawn 10.

In the last few centuries, French strategic thinking has sometimes been driven by the need to attain or preserve the so-called &quot;natural frontiers,&quot; which are the Pyrenees to the southwest, the Alps to the southeast, and the Rhine River to the east. Starting with Clovis, 1,500 years of warfare and diplomacy has witnessed the accomplishment of most of these objectives. Warfare with other European powers was not always determined by these considerations, and often rulers of France extended their continental authority far beyond these barriers, most notably under Charlemagne, Louis XIV, and Napoleon. These periods of incessant conflict were characterized by their own standards and conventions, but all required strong central leadership in order to permit the extension of French rule. Important military rivalries in human history have come about as a result of conflict between French peoples and other European powers. Anglo-French rivalry, for prestige in Europe and around the world, continued for centuries, while the more recent Franco-German rivalry required two world wars to stabilize.
Starting in the early 16th century, much of France&#x27;s military efforts were dedicated to securing its overseas possessions and putting down dissent among both French colonists and native populations. French troops were spread all across its empire, primarily to deal with the local population. The French colonial empire ultimately disintegrated after the failed attempt to subdue Algerian nationalists in the late 1950s, a failure that led to the collapse of the Fourth Republic. Since World War II, France&#x27;s efforts have been directed at maintaining its status as a great power and its influence on the UN Security Council. France has also been instrumental in attempting to unite the armed forces of Europe for their own defense in order to both balance the power of Russia and to lessen European military dependence on the United States. For example, France withdrew from NATO in 1966 over complaints that its role in the organization was being subordinated to the demands of the United States. French objectives in this era have undergone major shifts. Unencumbered by continental wars or intricate alliances, France now deploys its military forces as part of international peacekeeping operations, security enforcers in former colonies, or maintains them combat ready and mobilized to respond to threats from rogue states. France is a nuclear power with the largest nuclear arsenal in Europe, and its nuclear capabilities, just like its conventional forces, have been restructured to rapidly deal with emerging threats.

==Early period==
Around 390 BC, the Gallic chieftain Brennus made his own way through the Alps, defeated the Romans in the Battle of the Allia and sacked Rome for several months. The Gallic invasion left Rome weakened and encouraged several subdued Italian tribes to rebel. One by one, over the course of the next 50 years, these tribes were defeated and brought back under Roman dominion. Meanwhile, the Gauls would continue to harass the region until 345 BC, when they entered into a formal treaty with Rome. But Romans and Gauls would maintain an adversarial relationship for the next several centuries and the Gauls would remain a threat in Italia.

Around 125 BC, the south of France is conquered by the Romans who called this region &quot;Provincia Romana&quot; (&quot;Roman Province&quot;), which evolved into the name Provence in French. Brennus&#x27; sack of Rome was still remembered by Romans, when Julius Caesar conquered the remainder of Gaul. Initially Caesar met with little Gallic resistance: the 60 or so tribes that made up Gaul were unable to unite and defeat the Roman army, something Caesar exploited by pitting one tribe against another. In 58 BC, Caesar defeated the Germanic tribe of the Suebi, which was led by Ariovistus. The following year he conquered the Belgian Gauls after claiming that they were conspiring against Rome. The string of victories continued in a naval triumph against the Veneti in 56 BC. In 53 BC, a united Gallic resistance movement under Vercingetorix emerged for the first time. Caesar laid siege to the fortified city of Avaricum (Bourges) and broke through the defenses after 25 days, with only 800 out of the 40,000 inhabitants managing to escape. He then besieged Gergovia, Vercingetorix&#x27;s home town, and suffered one of the worst defeats in his career when he had to retreat to suppress a revolt in another part of Gaul. After returning, Caesar surrounded Vercingetorix at Alesia in 52 BC. The townspeople were starved into submission and Caesar&#x27;s unique defensive earthworks, protruding towards the city and away from it in order to stop a massive Gallic relief force, eventually forced Vercingetorix to surrender. The Gallic Wars were over.

Gallo-Roman culture settled over the region in the next few centuries, but as Roman power weakened in the 4th and 5th centuries AD, a Germanic tribe, the Franks, overran large areas that today form modern France. Under King Clovis I in the late 5th and early 6th centuries, Frankish dominions quadrupled as they managed to defeat successive opponents for control of Gaul. In 486 the Frankish armies under Clovis triumphed over Syagrius, the last Roman official in Northern Gaul, at the Battle of Soissons. In 491 Clovis defeated Thuringians east of his territories. In 496 he overcame the Alamanni at the Battle of Tolbiac. In 507 he scored the most impressive victory in his career, prevailing at the Battle of Vouillé against the Visigoths, who were led by Alaric II, the conqueror of Spain.

Following Clovis, territorial divisions in the Frankish domain sparked intense rivalry between the western part of the kingdom, Neustria, and the eastern part, Austrasia. The two were sometimes united under one king, but from the 6th to the 8th centuries they often warred against each other. Early in the 8th century, the Franks were preoccupied with Islamic invasions across the Pyrenees and up the Rhone Valley. Two key battles during this period were the Battle of Toulouse and the Battle of Tours, both won by the Franks, and both instrumental in slowing Islamic incursions.

Under Charlemagne the Franks reached the height of their power. After campaigns against Lombards, Avars, Saxons, and Basques, the resulting Carolingian Empire stretched from the Pyrenees to Central Germany, from the North Sea to the Adriatic. In 800 the Pope made Charlemagne Emperor of the West in return for protection of the Church. The Carolingian Empire was a conscious effort to recreate a central administration modeled on that of the Roman Empire, but the motivations behind military expansion differed. Charlemagne hoped to provide his nobles an incentive to fight by encouraging looting on campaign. Plunder and spoils of war were stronger temptations than imperial expansion, and several regions were invaded over and over in order to bolster the coffers of Frankish nobility. Cavalry dominated the battlefields, and while the high costs associated with equipping horses and horse-riders helped limit their numbers, Carolingian armies maintained an average size of 20,000 during peacetime by recruiting infantry from imperial territories near theaters of operation, swelling to more with the levies called upon when at war. The Empire lasted from 800 to 843, when, following Frankish tradition, it was split between the sons of Louis the Pious by the Treaty of Verdun.

==Middle Ages==
Military history during this period paralleled the rise and eventual fall of the armored knight. Following Charlemagne and the breakdown of the Frankish Empire due to civil war and ceaseless Viking incursions, the larger and more logistically difficult to maintain infantry-based armies were abandoned in favor of cavalry supplemented by an improvement in armor: leather and steel, steel helmets, coats of mail, and even full armor added to the defensive capabilities of mounted forces. A smaller and more mobile elite cavalry force quickly grew to be the most important component of armies within French territories and most of the rest of Europe, with the shock charge they provided becoming the standard tactic on the battlefield when it was invented in the 11th century. At the same time, the development of agricultural techniques allowed the nations of Western Europe to radically increase food production, facilitating the growth of a particularly large aristocracy under Capetian France. The rise of castles, which began in France during the 10th century, was partly caused by the inability of centralized authorities to control these emerging dukes and aristocrats. While all vassals and knights were in theory bound to fight for their sovereign when called upon, this period was marked by many feudal local and regional lords using the knights and levied conscripts below them to fight amongst each other, often in defiance or even outright rebellion towards their sovereign. After campaigns designed for plundering, attacking and defending, castles became the dominant feature of medieval warfare.
During the Crusades, there were in fact too many armored knights in France for the land to support. Some scholars believe that one of the driving forces behind the Crusades was an attempt by such landless knights to find land overseas, without causing the type of internecine warfare that would largely damage France&#x27;s increasing military strength. However, such historiographical work on the Crusades is being challenged and rejected by a large part of the historical community. The ultimate motivation or motivations for any one individual are difficult to know, but regardless, nobles and knights from France generally formed very sizeable contingents of crusading expeditions. Crusaders were so predominantly French that the word &quot;crusader&quot; in the Arabic language is simply known as &quot;Al-Franj&quot; or &quot;The Franks&quot; and Old French became the lingua franca of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.
In the 11th century, French knights wore knee-length mail and carried long lances and swords. The Norman knights fielded at the Battle of Hastings were more than a match for English forces, and their victory simply cemented their power and influence. Between 1202 and 1343, France reduced England&#x27;s holdings on the continent to a few small provinces through a series of conflicts including the Bouvines Campaign (1202-1214), the Saintonge War (1242) and the War of Saint-Sardos (1324).

Improvements in armor over the centuries led to the establishment of plate armor by the 14th century, which was further developed more rigorously in the 15th century. However, by the late 14th century and the early 15th century, socioeconomic calamities such as the Black Death, and political crises such as the Jacquerie peasant revolt, and especially the Armagnac-Burgundian Civil War combined with numerous English invasions, all led to French military power declining during the first two phases of the Hundred Years&#x27; War. New weapons, including artillery, and tactics seemingly made the knight more of a sitting target than an effective battle force, but the often-praised longbowmen had little to do with the English success. Poor coordination or rough and soft, muddy terrain led to a number of bungled French assaults. The slaughter of knights at the Battle of Agincourt best exemplified this carnage. The French were able to field a much larger army of men-at-arms than their English counterparts, who had many longbowmen. Despite this, the French suffered about 6,000 casualties compared to a few hundred for the English because the narrow terrain prevented the tactical envelopments envisioned in recently discovered French plans for the battle. The French suffered a similar defeat at the Battle of the Golden Spurs against Flemish militia in 1302. When knights were allowed to effectively deploy and attack their opponents in the open field, however, they could be more useful, as at Cassel in 1328 or, even more decisively, at Bouvines in 1214, and Patay in 1429.

Popular conceptions of the third and final phase of the Hundred Years War are often dominated by the exploits of Joan of Arc, but French resurgence was rooted in multiple factors. A major step was taken by King Charles VII, who created the &quot;Compagnies d&#x27;ordonnance&quot;—cavalry units with 20 companies of 600 men each—and launched the first standing army for a dynastic state in the Western world. The &quot;Compagnies&quot; gave the French a considerable edge in professionalism and discipline, being composed of paid full-time professional soldiers, at a time when the allegiances of the aristocratic knights would often shift to the opposing side. Strong French counterattacks turned the tide of the war. The important victories of Orléans, Patay, Formigny and Castillon allowed the French to win back all English continental territories, except Calais, which was later captured by the French.

Equipment of medieval French sergeants was based on their property:

==&quot;Ancien Régime&quot;==

The French Renaissance and the beginning of the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;, normally marked by the reign of Francis I, saw the nation become far more unified under the monarch. The power of the nobles was diminished as a national army was created. With England expelled from the continent and being consumed by the Wars of the Roses, France&#x27;s main rival was the Holy Roman Empire. This threat to France became alarming in 1516 when Charles V became the king of Spain, and grew worse when Charles was also elected Holy Roman Emperor in 1519. France was all but surrounded as Germany, Spain, and the Low Countries were controlled by the Habsburgs. The lengthy Italian Wars that took place during this period eventually resulted in defeat for France and established Catholic Spain, which formed a branch of the Habsburg holdings, as the most powerful nation in Europe, with their dreaded &quot;tercios&quot; dominating the European battlefield well into the Thirty Years War. Later in the 16th century, France was weakened internally by the Wars of Religion. As nobles managed to raise their own private armies, these conflicts between Huguenots and Catholics all but demolished centralization and monarchical authority, precluding France from remaining a powerful force in European affairs. On the battlefield, the religious conflicts highlighted the influence of the gendarmes, heavy cavalry units that comprised the majority of cavalrymen attached to the main field armies. The pride of the royal cavalry, gendarme companies were often attached to the main royal army in hopes of inflicting a decisive defeat on Huguenot forces, although secondary detachments were also used for scouting and intercepting enemy troops.

After the Wars of Religion, France could do little to challenge the dominance of the Holy Roman Empire, although the empire itself faced several problems. From the east it was facing intense warfare against Ottoman Empire, with which France formed an alliance. The vast Habsburg empire also proved impossible to manage effectively, and the crown was soon divided between the Spanish and Austrian holdings. In 1568, the Dutch declared independence, launching a war that would last for decades and would illustrate the weaknesses of Habsburg power. In the 17th century, the religious violence that had beset France a century earlier began to tear the empire apart. At first France sat on the sidelines, but under Cardinal Richelieu it saw an opportunity to advance its own interests at the expense of the Habsburgs. Despite France&#x27;s staunch Catholicism, it intervened on the side of the Protestants. The Thirty Years&#x27; War was long and extremely bloody, but France and its allies came out victorious, under the leadership of the legendary commanders Condé and Turenne, beginning a long line of unparalleled French marshals who would help usher in a new era of military strategy. After their victory, France emerged as the sole dominant European power under the reign of Louis XIV. In parallel, French explorers, such as Jacques Cartier or Samuel de Champlain, claimed lands in the Americas for France, paving the way for the expansion of the French colonial empire.

The long reign of Louis XIV saw a series of conflicts: the War of Devolution, the Franco-Dutch War, the War of the Reunions, the Nine Years War, and the War of the Spanish Succession. Few of these wars were either clear victories or definite defeats, but French borders expanded steadily anyway. The west bank of the Rhine, much of the Spanish Netherlands, and a good deal of Luxembourg were annexed while the War of the Spanish Succession saw the grandson of Louis placed on the throne of Spain. The French strategic situation, however, changed decisively with the Glorious Revolution in England, which replaced a pro-French king with an enemy of Louis, the Dutch William of Orange. After a period of two centuries seeing only rare hostilities with France, England now became a consistent enemy again, and remained so until the 19th century. To stop French advances, England formed coalitions with several other European powers, most notably the Habsburgs. While these armies had difficulties against the French on land, the British Royal Navy dominated the seas, and France lost many of its colonial holdings. The British economy also became Europe&#x27;s most powerful, and British money funded the campaigns of their continental allies.

Wars in this era consisted mostly of sieges and movements that were rarely decisive, prompting the French military engineer Vauban to design an intricate network of fortifications for the defense of France. The armies of Louis XIV were some of the most impressive in French history, their quality reflecting militaristic as well political developments. In the mid-17th century, royal power reasserted itself and the army became a tool through which the King could wield authority, replacing older systems of mercenary units and the private forces of recalcitrant nobles. Military administration also made gigantic progress as food supply, clothing, equipment, and armaments were provided in a regularity never before equaled. In fact, the French embedded this standardization by becoming the first army to give their soldiers national uniforms in the 1680s and 1690s.

The 18th century saw France remain the dominant power in Europe, but begin to falter largely because of internal problems. The country engaged in a long series of wars, such as the War of the Quadruple Alliance, the War of the Polish Succession, and the War of the Austrian Succession, but these conflicts gained France little. Meanwhile, Britain&#x27;s power steadily increased, and a new force, Prussia, became a major threat. This change in the balance of power led to the Diplomatic Revolution of 1756, when France and the Habsburgs forged an alliance after centuries of animosity. This alliance proved less than effective in the Seven Years&#x27; War, but in the American Revolutionary War, the French helped inflict a major defeat on the British.

==Revolutionary France==


The French Revolution, true to its name, revolutionized nearly all aspects of French and European life. The powerful sociopolitical forces unleashed by a people seeking liberté, égalité, and fraternité made certain that even warfare was not spared this upheaval. 18th-century armies—with their rigid protocols, static operational strategy, unenthusiastic soldiers, and aristocratic officer classes—underwent massive remodeling as the French monarchy and nobility gave way to liberal assemblies obsessed with external threats. In 1790 the officer corps was opened to all classes and a new generation of lower birth soldiers rose rapidly in the ranks during the following wars. The fundamental shifts in warfare that occurred during the period have prompted scholars to identify the era as the beginning of &quot;modern war&quot;.

In 1791 the Legislative Assembly passed the &quot;Drill-Book&quot; legislation, implementing a series of infantry doctrines created by French theorists because of their defeat by the Prussians in the Seven Years&#x27; War. The new developments hoped to exploit the intrinsic bravery of the French soldier, made even more powerful by the explosive nationalist forces of the Revolution. The changes also placed a faith on the ordinary soldier that would be completely unacceptable in earlier times; French troops were expected to harass the enemy and remain loyal enough to not desert, a benefit other Ancien Régime armies did not have.

Following the declaration of war in 1792, an imposing array of enemies converging on French borders prompted the government in Paris to adopt radical measures. August 23, 1793, would become a historic day in military history; on that date the National Convention called a levée en masse, or mass conscription, for the first time in human history. By summer of the following year, conscription made some 500,000 men available for service and the French began to deal blows to their European enemies.

Armies during the Revolution became noticeably larger than their Holy Roman counterparts, and combined with the new enthusiasm of the troops, the tactical and strategic opportunities became profound. By 1797 the French had defeated the First Coalition, occupied the Low Countries, the west bank of the Rhine, and Northern Italy, objectives which had defied the Valois and Bourbon dynasties for centuries. Unsatisfied with the results, many European powers formed a Second Coalition, but by 1801 this too had been decisively beaten. Another key aspect of French success was the changes wrought in the officer classes. Traditionally, European armies left major command positions to those who could be trusted, namely, the aristocracy. The hectic nature of the French Revolution, however, tore apart France&#x27;s old army, meaning new men were required to become officers and commanders.

Besides opening a flood of tactical and strategic opportunities, the Revolutionary Wars also laid the foundation for modern military theory. Later authors that wrote about &quot;nations in arms&quot; drew inspiration from the French Revolution, in which dire circumstances seemingly mobilized the entire French nation for war and incorporated nationalism into the fabric of military history. Although the reality of war in the France of 1795 would be different from that in the France of 1915, conceptions and mentalities of war evolved significantly. Clausewitz correctly analyzed the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras to give posterity a thorough and complete theory of war that emphasized struggles between nations occurring everywhere, from the battlefield to the legislative assemblies, and to the very way that people think. War now emerged as a vast panorama of physical and psychological forces heading for victory or defeat.

==Napoleonic France==

The Napoleonic Era saw French power and influence reach immense heights, even though the period of domination was relatively brief. In the century and a half preceding the Revolutionary Era, France had transformed demographic leverage to military and political weight; the French population was 19 million in 1700, but this had grown to over 29 million in 1800, much higher than that of most other European powers. These numbers permitted France to raise armies at a rapid pace should the need arise. Furthermore, military innovations carried out during the Revolution and the Consulate, evidenced by improvements in artillery and cavalry capabilities on top of better army and staff organization, gave the French army a decisive advantage in the initial stages of the Napoleonic Wars. Another ingredient of success was Napoleon Bonaparte himself—intelligent, charismatic, and a military genius, Napoleon absorbed the latest military theories of the day and applied them in the battlefield with deadly effect.
Napoleon inherited an army that was based on conscription and used huge masses of poorly trained troops, which could usually be readily replaced. By 1805 the French Army was a truly lethal force, with many in its ranks veterans of the French Revolutionary Wars. Two years of constant drilling for an invasion of England helped to build a well-trained, well-led army. The Imperial Guard served as an example for the rest of the army and consisted of Napoleon&#x27;s best handpicked soldiers. Napoleon&#x27;s huge losses suffered during the disastrous Russian campaign would have destroyed any professional commander of the day, but those losses were quickly replaced with new draftees. After Napoleon, nations planned for huge armies with professional leadership and a constant supply of new soldiers, which had huge human costs when improved weapons like the rifled musket replaced the inaccurate muskets of Napoleon&#x27;s day during the American Civil War.
This large size came at a cost, as the logistics of feeding a huge army made them especially dependent on supplies. Most armies of the day relied on the supply-convoy system established during the Thirty Years&#x27; War by Gustavus Adolphus. This limited mobility, since the soldiers had to wait for the convoys, but it did keep possibly mutinous troops from deserting, and thus helped preserve an army&#x27;s composure. However, Napoleon&#x27;s armies were so large that feeding them using the old method proved ineffective, and consequently, French troops were allowed to live off the land. Infused with new concepts of nation and service. Napoleon often attempted to wage decisive, quick campaigns so that he could allow his men to live off the land. The French army did use a convoy system, but it was stocked with very few days worth of food; Napoleon&#x27;s troops were expected to march quickly, effect a decision on the battlefield, then disperse to feed. For the Russian campaign, the French did store 24 days&#x27; worth of food before beginning active operations, but this campaign was the exception, not the rule.

Napoleon&#x27;s biggest influence in the military sphere was in the conduct of warfare. Weapons and technology remained largely static through the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras, but 18th-century operational strategy underwent massive restructuring. Sieges became infrequent to the point of near-irrelevance, a new emphasis arose towards the destruction of enemy armies as well as their outmaneuvering, and invasions of enemy territory occurred over broader fronts, thus introducing a plethora of strategic opportunities that made wars costlier and, just as importantly, more decisive. Defeat for a European power now meant much more than losing isolated enclaves. Near-Carthaginian treaties intertwined whole national efforts—social, political, economic, and militaristic—into gargantuan collisions that severely upset international conventions as understood at the time. Napoleon&#x27;s initial success sowed the seeds for his downfall. Not used to such catastrophic defeats in the rigid power system of 18th-century Europe, many nations found existence under the French yoke difficult, sparking revolts, wars, and general instability that plagued the continent until 1815, when the forces of reaction finally triumphed at the Battle of Waterloo.

==French colonial empire==

The history of French colonial imperialism can be divided in two major eras: the first from the early 17th century to the middle of the 18th century, and the second from the early 19th century to the middle of the 20th century. In the first phase of expansion, France concentrated its efforts mainly in North America, the Caribbean and India, setting up commercial ventures that were backed by military force. Following defeat in the Seven Years&#x27; War, France lost its possessions in North America and India, but it did manage to keep the wealthy Caribbean islands of Saint-Domingue, Guadeloupe, and Martinique.

The second stage began with the conquest of Algeria in 1830, then with the establishment of French Indochina (covering modern Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia) and a string of military victories in the Scramble for Africa, where it established control over regions covering much of West Africa, Central Africa and Maghreb. In 1914 France had an empire stretching over (6,000,000 mile²) of land and about 110 million people. Following victory in World War I, Togo and most of Cameroon were also added to the French possessions, and Syria and Lebanon became French mandates. For most of the period from 1870 to 1945, France was territorially the third largest nation on Earth, after Britain and Russia (later the Soviet Union), and had the most overseas possessions following Britain. Following the Second World War, France struggled to preserve French territories but wound up losing the First Indochina War (the precursor to the Vietnam War) and granting independence to Algeria after a long war. Today, France still maintains a number of overseas territories, but their collective size is barely a shadow of the old French colonial empire.

==From 1815==
After the exile of Napoleon, the freshly restored Bourbon monarchy helped the absolute Bourbon king of Spain to recover his throne during the French intervention in Spain in 1823. To restore the prestige of the French monarchy, disputed by the Revolution and the First Empire, Charles X engaged in the military conquest of Algeria in 1830. This marked the beginning of a new expansion of the French colonial empire throughout the 19th century. In that century, France remained a major force in continental affairs. After the 1830 July Revolution, the liberal king Louis Philippe I victoriously supported the Spanish and Belgian liberals in 1831. The French later inflicted a defeat on the Habsburgs in the Franco-Austrian War of 1859, a victory which led to the unification of Italy in 1861, after having triumphed over Russia with other allies in the Crimean War 1854–56. Detrimentally, however, the French army emerged from these victories in an overconfident and complacent state. France&#x27;s defeat in the Franco-Prussian War led to the loss of Alsace-Lorraine and the creation of a united German Empire, both results representing major failures in long-term French foreign policy and sparking a vengeful, nationalist revanchism meant to earn back former territories. The Dreyfus Affair, however, mitigated these nationalist tendencies by prompting public skepticism about the competence of the military.

=== First World War ===

In World War I, the French, with their allies, managed to hold the Western front and to counterattack on the Eastern front and in the colonies until the final defeat of the Central Powers and their allies. After major conflicts such as the Battle of the Frontiers, the First Battle of the Marne, the Battle of Verdun, and the Second Battle of the Aisne—the last resulting in tremendous loss of life and mutiny within the army—the French proved to be enough of a cohesive fighting force to counterattack and defeat the Germans at the Second Battle of the Marne, the first in what would become a string of Allied victories that ended the war. The Treaty of Versailles eventually returned Alsace-Lorraine to France. The French military, civilian and material losses during the First World War were huge. With more than 1.3 million military fatalities and more than 4.6 million wounded, France suffered the second highest Allied losses, after Russia. As a result, France was adamant on the payment of reparations by Germany. The organised failure of the Weimar Republic to pay reparations led to the Occupation of the Ruhr by French and Belgian forces.

===Second World War===
A variety of factors—ranging from smaller industrial base to low population growth and obsolete military doctrines—crippled the French effort at the outset of World War II. The Germans won the Battle of France in 1940 despite the French often having better planes and tanks than their opponents whereas they were lacking modern weaponry for the infantry, the main problem although was the unexistant doctrine to synchronize the tanks alongside the plane, as tanks were not used as a primary force but rather as support for infantry, without planning an anti-air protection for them. their use as primary force were made in very rare occasion, when commanded by Charles de Gaulle for example, only a tank crew division commander by the time of 1940.
Prior to the Battle of France, there were sentiments among many Allied soldiers, French and British, of pointless repetition; they viewed the war with dread since they had already beaten the Germans once, and images of that first major conflict were still poignant in military circles. The costs of World War I along with the now stale doctrine employed by the French Army (while the Germans were developing a doctrine which stressed initiative from junior commanders and combining different arms, the French sought to minimize casualties through a rigorously controlled type of battle and a top down command structure) forced the French to look for more defensive measures. The Maginot Line was the result of these deliberations: the French originally allocated three billion francs for the project, but by 1935 seven billion had been spent. The Maginot Line succeeded in holding off the German attack. However, while the French thought that the main weight of the German attack would arrive through central Belgium, and accordingly deployed their forces here, the assault actually came further south in the Ardennes forest. The Third Republic collapsed in the ensuing conflict.

After the defeat, Vichy France cooperated with the Axis powers until 1944. Charles de Gaulle exhorted the French people to join the allied armies, while the French Vichy forces participated in direct action against Allied forces, inflicting casualties in some cases.

The Normandy landings in that year were the first step towards the eventual liberation of France. The Free French Forces, under de Gaulle, had participated widely throughout previous campaigns, and their large size made them notable at the end of the war. As early as the winter of 1943, the Free French already had nearly 260,000 soldiers, and these numbers only grew as the war progressed. The French Resistance had also a significant contribution, participating also actively in the liberation of France. At the end of the war, France was given one of four occupation zones in Germany, in Berlin and Austria.

===Post-1945 warfare===


Following the 1939–45 war, decolonization spread through the former European empires.

Following the First Indochina War, they withdrew from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. The military also tried to keep control of Algeria during the Algerian War, when French forces attempted to defeat the Algerian rebels. Despite its military victory, France granted independence to Algerians. French Algeria was home to over a million of settlers (known as Pieds-Noirs), de Gaulle&#x27;s decision to grant independence to Algeria, almost led to a civil war, supported by various Pied-Noir, Harki and nationalist factions, including the FAF and the OAS. Related to and during the Algerian war France participated in the Suez Crisis with Israel and the UK.

By 1960 France had lost its direct military influence over all of its former colonies in Africa and Indochina. Nonetheless, several colonies in the Pacific, Caribbean, Indian Oceans and South America remain French territory to this day and France kept a form of indirect political influence in Africa colloquially known as the &quot;Françafrique&quot;.

As President of the French Republic, Charles de Gaulle oversaw the development of French atomic weapons and promoted a foreign policy independent of U.S. influence. He also withdrew France from the NATO military command in 1966—although remaining a member of the western alliance. The effect of withdrawal was reduced by continued cooperation between the French military and NATO, though France did not formally rejoin the NATO military command until 2009.

France intervened in various post-colonial conflicts, supporting former colonies (Western Sahara War, Shaba II, Chadian–Libyan conflict, Djiboutian Civil War), NATO peacekeeping missions in war-torn countries (UNPROFOR, KFOR, UNAMIR) and many humanitarian missions.

As a nuclear power and having some of the best trained and best equipped forces in the world, the French military has now met some of its primary objectives which are the defense of national territory, the protection of French interests abroad, and the maintenance of global stability. Conflicts indicative of these objectives are the Gulf War in 1991—when France sent 18,000 troops, 60 combat aircraft, 120 helicopters, and 40 tanks—and Mission Héraclès in the War in Afghanistan, along with recent interventions in Africa.

African interventions during the early 21st century include peacekeeping actions in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, which involved brief direct fighting between the French and Ivorian armies in 2004; under the mandate of Nicolas Sarkozy, French forces returned to Côte d&#x27;Ivoire in 2011 to remove the Ivorian president. In the same year, France played a pivotal role in the 2011 military intervention in Libya against Muammar Gaddafi. The year after, France intervened in Mali during that country&#x27;s civil war, as Islamist militants appeared to threaten the south after seizing control of the arid north. Changes in the government of France, including Socialist François Hollande becoming president in 2012 after years of center-right governance, have done little to alter Paris&#x27; foreign policy in Africa.

Hollande also proposed French military involvement in the Syrian civil war in the wake of chemical attacks French intelligence reports linked to the forces of President Bashar al-Assad in mid-2013.

France has encouraged military cooperation at an EU level, starting with the formation of the Franco-German Brigade in 1987 and Eurocorps in 1992, based in Strasbourg. In 2009 a battalion of German light infantry was moved to Alsace, the first time German troops had been stationed in France since the Nazi occupation of World War II. This process has not been immune to budget cuts—in October 2013 France announced the closure of her last infantry regiment in Germany, thus marking the end of a major presence across the Rhine although both countries will maintain around 500 troops on each other&#x27;s territory. As fellow members of the UN Security Council with many interests and problems in common, the UK and France have a long history of bilateral collaboration. This has occurred both at government level and in industrial programmes like the SEPECAT Jaguar whilst corporate mergers have seen Thales and MBDA emerge as major defence companies spanning both countries. The financial crisis of 2007–08 led to renewed pressure on military budgets and the &quot;austerity alliance&quot; enshrined in the Lancaster House Treaties of 2010. These promised close integration in both procurement and at an operational level, reaching into the most sensitive areas such as nuclear warheads.

==Topical subjects==

===French Air and Space Force===

The Armée de l&#x27;Air became one of the first professional air forces in the world when it was founded in 1909. The French took active interest in developing their air force and had the first fighter pilots of World War I. During the interwar years, however, particularly in the 1930s, the technical quality fell when compared with the Luftwaffe, which crushed both the French and British air forces during the Battle of France. In the post–World War II era, the French made a concerted and successful effort to develop a homegrown aircraft industry. Dassault Aviation led the way forward with their unique and effective delta-wing designs, which formed the basis for the famous Mirage series of jet fighters. The Mirage repeatedly demonstrated its deadly abilities in the Six-Day War and the Gulf War, becoming one of the most popular and well-sold aircraft in the history of military aviation along the way. Currently, the French are awaiting the A400M military transport aircraft, which is still in developmental stages, and the integration of the new Rafale multi-role jet fighter, whose first squadron of 20 aircraft became operational in 2006 at Saint-Dizier. In 2020 it was renamed the Armée de l&#x27;Air et de l&#x27;Espace, or French Air and Space Force.

===French Navy===
Medieval fleets, in France as elsewhere, were almost entirely composed of merchant ships enlisted into naval service in time of war, but the early beginnings of the French naval history goes back to that era. The first battle of the French Navy was the battle of Arnemuiden (23 September 1338), where it defeated the English Navy. The battle of Arnemuiden was also the first naval battle using artillery. It was later defeated by an Anglo-Flemish fleet at the Battle of Sluys and, with Castilian help, managed to beat the English at La Rochelle—both battles playing a crucial role in the development of the Hundred Years War. However, the navy did not become a consistent instrument of national power until the 17th century with Louis XIV. Under the tutelage of the &quot;Sun King,&quot; the French Navy was well financed and equipped, managing to resoundingly defeat a combined Spanish-Dutch fleet at the Battle of Palermo in 1676 during the Franco-Dutch War, although, along with the English navy, it suffered several strategic reversals against the Dutch, who were led by the brilliant Michiel de Ruyter. It scored several early victories in the Nine Years War against the Royal Navy and the Dutch Navy. Financial difficulties, however, allowed the English and the Dutch to regain the initiative at sea.

A perennial problem for the French Navy was the strategic priorities of France, which were first and foremost tied to its European ambitions. This reality meant that the army was often treated better than the navy, and as a result, the latter suffered in training and operational performance. The 18th century saw the beginning of the Royal Navy&#x27;s domination, which managed to inflict a number of significant defeats on the French. However, in a very impressive effort, a French fleet under de Grasse managed to defeat a British fleet at the Battle of the Chesapeake in 1781, ensuring that the Franco-American ground forces would win the ongoing Siege of Yorktown. Beyond that, and Suffren&#x27;s impressive campaigns against the British in India, there was not much more good news. The French Revolution all but crippled the French Navy, and efforts to make it into a powerful force under Napoleon were dashed at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, where the British all but annihilated a combined Franco-Spanish fleet. The disaster guaranteed British naval domination until the end of the Napoleonic wars.

Later in the 19th century, the navy recovered and became the second finest in the world after the Royal Navy. It conducted a successful blockade of Mexico in the Pastry War of 1838 and obliterated the Chinese navy at the Battle of Foochow in 1884. It also served as an effective link between the growing parts of the French empire. The navy performed well during World War I, in which it mainly protected the naval lanes in the Mediterranean Sea. At the onset of the war, the French had a large fleet in the Mediterranean whive no less than seven battleship &amp; six heavy cruiser . French defeats in the early stages of World War II, however, forced the British to attack the French fleet moored at Mers-el-Kebir in order to prevent the threat she fall to the Germans, the remaining of French fleet scuttled herself at Toulon for prevent the 7th Panzer Division to capture the fleet, two years later .

Currently, French naval doctrine calls for two aircraft carriers, but the French currently only have one, the &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot;, due to restructuring. The navy is in the midst of some technological and procurement changes; newer submarines are under construction and Rafale aircraft (the naval version) are currently replacing older aircraft.

===Foreign Legion===

The Foreign Legion was created in 1831 by French king Louis-Philippe to allow the incorporation of foreign nationals into the French Army. Over the past century and a half, it has gone on to become one of the most recognizable and lauded military units in the world. The Legion had a very difficult start; there were few non-commissioned officers, many of the soldiers could not speak French, and pay was often irregular. The Legion was soon transferred to fight in Algeria, performing moderately successfully given its condition. On August 17, 1835, the commander of the Legion, Colonel Joseph Bernelle, decided to amalgamate all the battalions so that no nationality was exclusively confined to a particular battalion; this helped ensure that the Legion did not fragment into factions.

Following participation in Africa and in the Carlist Wars in Spain, the Legion fought in the Crimean War and the Franco-Austrian War, where they performed heroically at the Battle of Magenta, before earning even more glory during the French intervention in Mexico. On April 30, 1863, a company of 65 legionnaires was ambushed by 2,000 Mexican troops at the Hacienda Camarón; in the resulting Battle of Camarón, the legionnaires resisted bravely for several hours and inflicted 300–500 casualties on the Mexicans while 62 of them died and three were captured. One of the Mexican commanders, impressed by the memorable intransigence he had just witnessed, characterized the Legion in a way they&#x27;ve been known ever since, &quot;These are not men, but devils!&quot;

In World War I, the Legion demonstrated that it was a highly capable unit in modern warfare. It suffered 11,000 casualties in the Western Front while conducting brilliant defenses and spirited counter-attacks. Following the debacle in the Battle of France in 1940, the Legion was split between those who supported the Vichy government and those who joined the Free French under de Gaulle. At the Battle of Bir Hakeim in 1942, the Free French 13th Legion Demi-Brigade doggedly defended its positions against a combined Italian-German offensive and seriously delayed Rommel&#x27;s attacks towards Tobruk. The Legion eventually returned to Europe and fought until the end of the Second World War in 1945. It later fought in the First Indochina War against the Viet Minh. At the climactic Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954, French forces, many of them legionnaires, were completely surrounded by a large Vietnamese army and were defeated after two months of tenacious fighting. French withdrawal from Algeria led to the collapse of the French colonial empire. The legionnaires were mostly used in colonial interventions, so the destruction of the empire prompted questions about their status. Ultimately, the Legion was allowed to exist and participated as a rapid reaction force in many places throughout Africa and around the world.

<text>Let&#x27;s Face It is the fifth studio album by American ska punk band The Mighty Mighty Bosstones. It was released on March 11, 1997, by Mercury Records and Big Rig Records.

The album sold very well due to the success of its single &quot;The Impression That I Get&quot;, which reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart. Also faring well were the album&#x27;s other two singles, &quot;Royal Oil&quot; (No. 22) and &quot;The Rascal King&quot; (No. 7). The album itself reached No. 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 (the only Bosstones album to enter the top 50). The album has been certified platinum.

&quot;Let&#x27;s Face It&quot; was rereleased on vinyl by Asbestos Records in 2013.

==Reception==
&quot;Let&#x27;s Face It&quot; has received positive reviews. Sputnikmusic&#x27;s Adam Thomas called the album &quot;a quintessential piece of &#x27;90s ska&quot; and concluded that it &quot;shows The Mighty Mighty Bosstones at the top of their game and is one of the greatest ska-punk albums to come out of the nineties.&quot; AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey also gave the album a positive review, writing: &quot;Even if the production is a tiny bit slick, and the playing time is rather short... it&#x27;s still difficult to view &quot;Let&#x27;s Face It&quot; as anything but a rousing success and easily one of the band&#x27;s best albums.&quot; Stephen Thompson of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote that &quot;for every misfire like the preachy title track, there&#x27;s an infectious anthem that begs to be blared from every window in the city. Play &#x27;The Rascal King&#x27; or &#x27;The Impression That I Get&#x27; as loud as you can get away with, and ask yourself if the Bosstones aren&#x27;t back.&quot; David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was more reserved in his praise, criticizing the album&#x27;s &quot;flat&quot; production.

In 2004, &quot;Let&#x27;s Face It&quot; was ranked No. 36 in a &quot;Kerrang!&quot; reader poll of the 50 greatest punk albums.

<text>Mikhail Dmitrievich Prokhorov (; born 3 May 1965) is a Russian-Israeli oligarch and politician. He was also an owner of the Brooklyn Nets. 

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Prokhorov obtained Russian state-owned metals assets at prices far below market value in Russia&#x27;s controversial loans-for-shares privatization program. His company, Norilsk Nickel, became the world&#x27;s largest producer of nickel and palladium. He is the former chairman of Polyus Gold, Russia&#x27;s largest gold producer, and the former President of Onexim Group. As of December 1, 2021, &quot;Bloomberg Billionaires Index&quot; estimates his wealth at US$14.0 billion and has named him the 148th richest person in the world, while &quot;Forbes Magazine&quot; lists his wealth at US$11.5 billion and the 193rd richest person in the world.

In 2011, Prokhorov ran as an independent candidate in the 2012 Russian presidential election. He was third in voting, amassing 7.98 percent of the total vote. In June 2012, he declared the establishment of the new Russian political party called Civic Platform.

In April 2022, Prokhorov immigrated to Israel and received Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return.

==Early life==
Prokhorov was born in Moscow to Tamara and Dmitri Prokhorov. On his paternal side, his grandparents were Russians, relatively wealthy peasant farmers (known as kulaks) who were persecuted as class enemies under the Bolsheviks and again under Stalin. His father, one of eight children, grew up poor, after his family &quot;lost everything and was forced to flee from one part of Siberia and restart life in another&quot;. He has one sibling, an elder sister, Irina. On his maternal side his grandfather was Russian, and his grandmother Anna Belkina, was a Jewish microbiologist who remained in Moscow during World War II to make vaccines while her daughter Tamara was moved east to safety. 

Dmitri Prokhorov was trained as a lawyer and handled international relations for the Soviet Committee of Physical Culture and Sport. Tamara Prokhorova was a materials engineer at the Institute for Chemical Machine-Building.
As part of his job, Dmitri Prokhorov had the opportunity to travel abroad. His wife worked as an engineer for a research group at the institute specializing in plastics. They died within a year of each other, both from heart disease when they were in their late 50s. Mikhail Prokhorov&#x27;s sister, Irina, who &quot;runs his philanthropic organizations, an erudite literary magazine, and a publishing house ... lives in a wing of his mansion west of Moscow&quot;.

In 1989, he graduated from the Moscow Finance Institute. From 1989 to 1992, he worked in a management position at the International Bank for Economic Cooperation. Thereafter, he shortly served as head of management board of the MFK bank (International Finance Company) () and then in 1993 the newly formed United Export-Import Bank () (Uneximbank; akas: Onexim Bank; Oneksimbank), with Alexander Khloponin, a friend from college, and Vladimir Potanin, to whom he was introduced by Khloponin and who became his business partner. Oneksimbank is the financial twin of MFK and was also known as the ONEKSIMbank-MFK banking group which was also close to Andrey Vavilov.

==Business career==
In 1992, at the age of 27, Prokhorov partnered with Potanin to run Interros, a holding company that they used in 1995 to effect the purchase of Norilsk Nickel, one of Russia&#x27;s largest nickel and palladium mining and smelting companies. During the largely un-regulated privatization of former state-controlled industries after the collapse of the USSR, Prokhorov and Potanin (the latter by then a deputy prime minister who oversaw privatization) were able acquire the shares from the workers of Norilsk Nickel for a fraction of their estimated market value and seize ownership of the company. When he departed in 2007, Prokhorov&#x27;s share of the company was worth US$7.5 billion.

Prokhorov&#x27;s first major financial success came at MFK, which became a depository institution for the government. The bank acquired Soviet assets in the amount of US$300 to US$400 million. Prokhorov held the post of chairman of the board from 1992 until 1993. In 1993, Prokhorov became the chairman of the board for Potanin&#x27;s Onexim Bank, which, in 1993, became the paying agent for Finance Ministry bonds and a servicing bank for the City of Moscow&#x27;s external economic activities. In May 1994, Onexim Bank focused on large clients in foreign economic activity especially in the sectors of oil and gas, chemical and metallurgical industries. In 1994, Onexim became the depository and paying agent for Russian Treasury obligations, and in 1995, it became the authorized bank for the federal agency dealing with bankrupt enterprises.

Banks holding government funds earned handsome fees and paid minimal interest at a time when inflation was in the triple digits.

In the 1990s, the Russian government needed loans to operate. Prokhorov partnered with Potanin. Their Onexim bank ran auctions for the government, in which bidders won the right to loan the Russian government money. Onexim and its affiliates were the winning bidders at the Norilsk Nickel and other auctions they conducted. The Russian government secured the loans with blocks of shares of the newly privatized state enterprises. The government never repaid the loans, and, as a result, Onexim received ownership of the collateral, which was the shares in the privatized enterprises.

When cash privatization eventually replaced the failing voucher privatization phase, the government came up with a scheme to leverage the privatization process and quickly raise money for its cash-strapped operations. Under the &quot;loans for shares&quot; program, the administration sold off majority stakes in some of its prized companies in the energy, telecommunications, and metallurgical sectors in exchange for loans taken from the new private sector banks owned by rich businessmen. According to the terms of the loan, the lender could stake equity ownership in the company if the government failed to repay the loans by September 1996. Auctions conducted under the &quot;loans for shares&quot; program were executed in such a way that only the few businessmen who owned these banks were allowed to partake in auctions. Following these bogus auctions, the majority stakes in some of the biggest Russian companies were acquired by a small number of major banks at abysmally low prices. These businessmen also bankrolled Yeltsin&#x27;s 1996 presidential election victory, exerting their influence over the then president.

Onexim purchased Sidanko, which was a part of the Novolipetsk metallurgical industrial complex, and also the Novorossiisk marine shipping company and a large share of the Northwest marine shipping company. All of these enterprises were purchased by Prokhorov and Potanin for approximately one third of their estimated market value. 

In April 1996, Prokhorov was appointed to the Board of Directors of Norilsk Nickel (which then still belonged to the state). In November 1995, Onexim Bank won 38% of Norilsk Nickel in a loans-for-shares auction for US$170.1 million, US$100,000 (or less than 1%) higher than the bid starting price. At the time, Norilsk produced 25% of the world&#x27;s nickel output.

Onexim managed the Norilsk Nickel auction, with a reservation price of US$170 million. It arranged three bids from affiliates, all at US$170 or US$170.1 million. Rossiiski Kredit Bank offered US$355 million, more than twice the starting amount. However, Onexim disqualified Rossiiski Kredit&#x27;s bid on the basis that the bid amount exceeded Rossiiski Kredit&#x27;s charter capital (the nominal value of its outstanding shares). The auction rules required Onexim to provide any objections in advance of the auction, to give bidders time to cure them. None of the submitted bids even closely approximated the market value of Norilsk Nickel, which had annual profits of around US$400 million.

&quot;60 Minutes&quot;, the American news program, interviewed Prokhorov. The program alleged that:
&quot;Kremlin leaders gave him what amounts to an insiders opportunity to buy one of the state&#x27;s most valuable assets. It was acquired from the Kremlin in a so-called auction for the measly sum of a few hundred million dollars in a process that even Prokhorov&#x27;s business partner admits wasn&#x27;t perfect, and probably not even legal under Western standards. But it was legal in Russia&quot;.

During the interview, Russian business correspondent Yulia Latynina stated about the auction of Norilsk Nickel, &quot;Yes, it was rigged. But, it cannot be explained in normal economic terms to an outsider, especially an American. You had robber barons, we have oligarchs.&quot;

In December 2011, Prokhorov capped a year of higher-profile political activity in Russia with the December declaration that he would run as an independent in the 2012 presidential elections. He took third place in these elections with 7.98% of the vote. In June 2012, he declared the establishment of a new political party called the “Party of Civic Platform”. He resigned his positions as Chairman of Polyus Gold and President of the ONEXIM Group to enter politics in June 2011.

In August 2017, Prokhorov agreed to sell 7% of Rusal to fellow billionaire Viktor Vekselberg for $503.9 million. Talks between the two had stalled earlier in the year with Prokhorov selling 3.3% via an accelerated bookbinding.

In October 2017, Prokhorov and Viktor Vekselberg sold 3% of Rusal for $315 million in an accelerated bookbuilding. The sale of Prokhorov&#x27;s 0,7% reduced his stake in the company to 6%.

===Norilsk Nickel===
After selling off most of Norilsk&#x27;s non-mining assets, Prokhorov moved to modernize a highly complex mining operation which required icebreakers to transport metal over the frozen Arctic region. Prokhorov invested in an innovative Finnish freighter that did not require icebreakers. Norilsk Nickel is headquartered in Moscow. Environmental and labor conditions are harsh, and pollution remains a problem; Prokhorov has invested heavily in pollution control. However, despite these efforts, the mining areas continue to suffer from a high level of pollution. He converted Norilsk&#x27;s gold-mining interests into the US$8.5 billion corporation Polyus Gold, Russia&#x27;s largest gold producer. In 2003, he oversaw the acquisition of Stillwater Mining, his first international venture. He resigned as Norilsk CEO in February 2007 and declared his intention to separate his assets from those of long-time partner Vladimir Potanin. The two engaged in protracted negotiations to separate the conglomerate Interros, which the duo co-owned since the 1990s, into separate holdings.

===ONEXIM Group===
In May 2007, following the decision to exit Interros, Prokhorov launched the private investment fund ONEXIM Group, with assets valued at US$17 billion at the time. As the separation from Interros proceeded, and as other industries caught Prokhorov&#x27;s attention, the group rapidly changed its investment profile. In April 2008, Prokhorov sold his 25% plus two shares stake in Norilsk Nickel to United Company RUSAL, another mining conglomerate controlled by his fellow billionaire Oleg Deripaska, in exchange for some 14% of Rusal stock, about US$5 billion in cash, and additional payment obligations of US$2 billion. The deal has been singled out as a major success for Prokhorov as only three months later, following a dip in oil prices, a disastrous stock market crash halved the value of most Russian companies, including Norilsk. He emerged as one of the very few businessmen to have cashed out in time. However, his wealth has also been affected, as the value of his remaining interests in various companies (including Rusal and Open Investments) declined sharply, and as the remaining payment from Rusal had to be postponed but has since been fully paid. 

In September 2008, ONEXIM Group acquired 50% of Renaissance Capital, a major Russian investment bank which has reportedly encountered liquidity problems. ONEXIM purchased a small bank, renaming it IFC (for the bank which Prokhorov had run in the early 1990s). One of ONEXIM Group&#x27;s divisions focuses on the development of nanotechnology investing in high-technology projects such as white LEDs. One of the key areas of development is the production of materials with ultra–tiny structures used in energy generation and medicine. As part of that focus, ONEXIM purchased Optogan in 2008. 

In June 2007, the Russian Prime Minister, Mikhail Fradkov, announced the formation of the Government Council for Nanotechnology, to oversee the development of nanotechnology in the country. Prokhorov was one of 15 individuals appointed to the council, which was to be chaired by then-First Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov.

In July 2009, the shareholders of RBC Information Systems agreed with Prokhorov&#x27;s ONEXIM Group to sell an additional 51% stake for US$80 million, half of which went to pay off debts. The deal was closed in 2010. Prokhorov has business interests in mining and metallurgy (Polyus Gold, Intergeo, stake in Rusal), financial services (IFC-Bank, Soglassye insurance company, half of Renaissance Capital), utilities (stake in Quadra), nanotech, media (JV!) and real estate development (Open Investments). 

In 2016, Onexim sold its 20% stake in Uralkrali, and is considering selling off assets including United Co. Rusal, Opin PJSC and Quadra.

In January 2022, ONEXIM Group sold 82.47% of the energy company to a subsidiary of Rosatom State Corporation.

==International investments and patronage==
Prokhorov owns a number of international investments. In Israel, he owns two private hospitals, where he has paid for the medical treatment of friends such as Alla Pugacheva.

In March 2004, Prokhorov founded the Cultural Initiatives Foundation (as part of the Mikhail Prokhorov Foundation). It is headed by Prokhorov&#x27;s elder sister, Irina, a prominent Russian publisher. At one time, he financially supported CSKA Moscow&#x27;s basketball, hockey and football clubs, and is a member of the Supreme Council of the Sport Russia organization. He serves as president of the Russian Biathlon Union. He is also an avid freeride/freestyle jet skier. He performs tricks on a jet ski in a professional stand-up achievement. In the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview he stated that a backflip is his most impressive trick.

In September 2009, he made an offer to buy a controlling interest in the New Jersey Nets of the National Basketball Association and half of a project to build a new arena in Brooklyn. On 11 May 2010, the NBA approved the sale of the Nets to Prokhorov, making him the majority owner of the team with an 80% stake. He also acquired a 45% interest in the new Barclays Center sports and entertainment arena.

He became the first non-North American team owner in the NBA. In December 2011, after announcing his run for the Russian presidency, the NBA confirmed that Prokhorov&#x27;s ownership interest would not need to be altered in the event of his election (Herb Kohl, a then sitting but since retired U.S. Senator, owned the Milwaukee Bucks at the time). On 30 April 2012, the Nets officially made the move to Brooklyn, rebranding themselves as the Brooklyn Nets.

In October 2017, reports continued to circulate that Prokhorov was moving closer to closing the sale of 49 percent of the Brooklyn Nets. On 27 October, ESPN reported that Prokhorov had agreed to sell the 49 percent to Taiwanese-Canadian businessman Joseph Tsai, co-founder and executive vice chairman of Alibaba. The stake was valued at $1.2 billion. On 18 September 2019, Prokhorov sold the remaining 51 percent of the Nets to Tsai. According to Dmitry Razumov, CEO of Onexim, Prokhorov&#x27;s investment was less than $1.5 billion, and the overall sale was estimated at $3.5 billion, with an income of about $2 billion.

Prokhorov controls, and is one of the largest investors in, Sensorium Corp, a virtual reality company.

==Controversies==
At a Christmas party for the Russian nouveau riche at the French Alpine resort of Courchevel in January 2007, he was arrested on suspicion of arranging prostitutes for his guests. After three days, he was released without charge. In September 2009, Prokhorov was officially cleared from this charge and the court case was dismissed. According to the French prosecutor, he had paid all expenses for the single women to travel to France, but they were not professional prostitutes or working for a prostitution agency.

Prokhorov made headlines in early March 2010 when he was forced to forfeit a £36 million deposit he had placed on the £360 million Villa Leopolda in the French Riviera in 2008. Under French property law, once an initial sale contract has been signed, a deposit can be refunded only during a seven-day cooling-off period. On 2 March 2010, a court at Nice in France ruled that the villa&#x27;s owner, 71-year-old Lily Safra, could keep the £36 million deposit, plus £1 million in interest.

Regarding Prokhorov&#x27;s political efforts and the Right Cause party, critical commentators claim that the entire endeavor is just a project of the Kremlin closely curated by Vladislav Surkov and that Prokorov was effectively appointed to be the party leader rather than being chosen by independently minded party members. According to them, the &quot;puppet party&quot; was designed to divert opposition voters by using liberal rhetoric.

Prokhorov had run the Russian Biathlon Union from 2008 to 2014 and offered legal services to disqualified Russian biathletes.

Prokhorov is one of many &quot;Russian oligarchs&quot; named in the Countering America&#x27;s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, CAATSA, signed into law by President Donald Trump in 2017.

==Russian politics==
In May 2011, Prokhorov announced a plan to join the leadership of the Russian pro-business political party Right Cause. While not antagonistic to the Kremlin, the party was seen as likely to support President Dmitry Medvedev rather than Prime Minister Vladimir Putin if the latter entered the 2012 presidential race. In June of that year, Prokhorov was elected to the leadership of the party at the Right Cause Party Congress of 2011. At the acceptance ceremony, Prokhorov officially criticized the present ruling tandem of Medvedev-Putin, the structure of Russia, and vowed to bring Russia back to a stable development course. However, in September 2011, Prokhorov reversed course and resigned from Right Cause, &quot;condemning it as a &#x27;puppet Kremlin party&#x27; micromanaged by a &#x27;puppet master&#x27; in the president&#x27;s office ... Vladislav Y. Surkov&quot;.

In 2014, Prokhorov announced that he was considering moving control of his ownership in the Brooklyn Nets to one of his Russian-based subsidiaries, in an attempt to comply with Putin&#x27;s order, signed into law in 2013, that no Russian politicians should have foreign assets and equity, and that all Russian companies should be registered and pay tax locally.

In 2016, Prokhorov ran afoul of Putin when his media group Onexim, specifically RBC Media, published articles and news reports on the Panama Papers and Putin&#x27;s son-in-law Kirill Shamalov&#x27;s connections and offshore assets. Onexim offices were raided by the Federal Security Service as well as tax department officials, in April 2016. The raids were officially described as part of an investigation into another bank but the FSB reported that tax violations were discovered at &quot;a number of commercial structures&quot;.

A number of media journalists, including editor-in-chief of RBC Media, were fired after the raid, amid rumors of pressure and opposition from the Kremlin.

In June 2012, he became the leader of the Civic Platform Party. In 2015, Prokhorov resigned as leader of the party and left it.

===2012 presidential campaign===
In December 2011, after the legislative elections, Prokhorov announced that he would contest the 2012 presidential election against Vladimir Putin as an independent. He called it &quot;probably the most important decision of my life&quot;. According to Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov and opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, both saw the move as inspired by the Kremlin. According to Nemtsov, it was an attempt &quot;to preserve Putin&#x27;s regime&quot;. He collected 2 million signatures needed to allow him to run for the presidency. Prokhorov said he would not base his campaign on criticism of Putin. &quot;Criticism must make up no more than 10% ... I would like to focus on the things I would do,&quot; he said.

On 4 March 2012 presidential polling, Prokhorov gained 7.98% of the vote. According to a poll by VTSIOM, his candidacy was known by only 8% of the Russian electorate.

On election day, Prokhorov said: &quot;Initially I had no illusions that I was going to the presidential elections, which are, in fact, dishonest. Obviously, preferences were made in favor of one candidate&quot;.

==Lawsuit against Grigory Rodchenkov==
Following Russia&#x27;s banning from the 2018 Winter Olympics and the stripping of medals from multiple Russian athletes, in February 2018, Prokorov agreed to finance a defamation lawsuit in New York against Grigory Rodchenkov, the former mastermind behind Russia&#x27;s state sponsored Olympic doping program. The suit claims that Rodchenkov defamed three Russian biathletes — Olga Zaytseva, Yana Romanova and Olga Vilukhina — when Rodchenkov included them on a list of athletes who took performance-enhancing drugs as part of a state-controlled program that corrupted the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. The women, who were stripped of the silver medal they won as part of a relay team, are seeking $10 million each in damages.

In April 2018, Rodchenkov, through his lawyer, Jim Walden, countersued Prokhorov under New York&#x27;s anti-SLAPP law asserting that Prokhorov&#x27;s suit was frivolous and intended to limit an individual&#x27;s First Amendment rights to free speech. According to published reports, the countersuit is likely to seek the names of other individuals who are financing the lawsuit against Rodchenkov as well as information about the assets of Prokhorov.

Walden said he believes Prokhorov&#x27;s lawsuit was intentionally designed to uncover Rodchenkov&#x27;s whereabouts in the United States and allow agents of the Russian government to find him.

==Personal life==
Prokhorov has never been married, but has been engaged twice. Shortly after purchasing the Nets, he vowed to get married if the Nets had not won the NBA championship within five years. In July 2015, he rescinded the pledge, saying that NBA Commissioner Adam Silver had &quot;taken his place&quot; by marrying in May. While Prokhorov was romantically linked to Ksenia Sobchak in the media, he has not named any specific woman as a possible bride, only that he might marry, and has never done so.

==Awards==
In August 2006, he was awarded the Order of Friendship for his significant contribution to the growth of Russia&#x27;s economic potential, when the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, signed an order for the granting of state honors on 18 August 2006. In March 2011, he was bestowed with the French Legion of Honour. France&#x27;s ambassador to Moscow, Jean de Gliniasty, presented it at the French embassy in Moscow.

<doc id="1313678" wikidata="Q1415342" url="?curid=1313678" title="Michigan Supreme Court">
<text>The Michigan Supreme Court is the highest court in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is Michigan&#x27;s court of last resort and consists of seven justices. The Court is located in the Michigan Hall of Justice at 925 Ottawa Street in Lansing, the state capital.

==Operations==
Each year, the Court receives approximately 2,000 new case filings. In most cases, the litigants seek review of Michigan Court of Appeals decisions, but the Supreme Court also hears cases of attorney misconduct (through a bifurcated disciplinary system comprising an investigation and prosecution agency – the Attorney Grievance Commission – and a separate adjudicative agency – the Attorney Discipline Board), judicial misconduct (through the Judicial Tenure Commission), as well as a small number of matters over which the Court has original jurisdiction.

The Court issues a decision by order or opinion in all cases filed with it. Opinions and orders of the Court are reported in an official publication, &quot;Michigan Reports&quot;, as well as in Thomson West&#x27;s privately published &quot;North Western Reporter&quot;.

===Administration of the courts===
The Court&#x27;s other duties include overseeing the operations of all state trial courts. It is assisted in this endeavor by the State Court Administrative Office, one of its agencies. The Court&#x27;s responsibilities also include a public comment process for changes to court rules, rules of evidence and other administrative matters. The court has broad superintending control power over all the state courts in Michigan.

Article 6, Section 30 of the Michigan Constitution creates the Michigan Judicial Tenure Commission. This is an agency within the judiciary, having jurisdiction over allegations of judicial misconduct, misbehavior, and infirmity. The Supreme Court is given original, superintending control power, and appellate jurisdiction over the issue of penalty (up to and including removal of judges from office).

==History==
The Michigan Supreme Court can be dated back to the Supreme Court of Michigan Territory, established in 1805 with three justices. These justices served for indefinite terms. In 1823, the terms of justices were limited to four years.

The Michigan Supreme Court was the only court created by the first Michigan constitution in 1835. It had three members and each also oversaw one of the three judicial circuits, located in Detroit, Ann Arbor and Kalamazoo. The court needed a quorum of two to operate and members were appointed to seven-year terms by the governor with the consent of the senate. In 1838, Justice William A. Fletcher proposed a new plan for the court that the legislature approved. This increased the number of circuits to four and thus expanded the bench to four justices, but left the quorum at two.

In 1848, the court was expanded to five justices and the 1850 Michigan constitution provided that they be elected for six-year terms. In 1858, the Circuit Courts were split from the Supreme Court, so justices now only served on the Michigan Supreme Court and reduced its size to only four justices, one of whom was the Chief Justice.

In 1887, the court was expanded to five justices each serving for ten years. The court was again expanded in 1903 to eight justices serving terms of eight years. In 1964, the new state constitution provided that the next justice to leave the court would not be replaced to reduce the court to seven members, which was achieved when Justice Theodore Souris declined to run for re-election in 1968, leaving the court with seven members since January 1, 1969.

==Composition==
The Supreme Court consists of seven justices who are elected to eight-year terms. Candidates are nominated by political parties and are elected on a nonpartisan ballot. Supreme Court candidates must be qualified electors, licensed to practice law in Michigan for at least five years, and under 70 years of age at the time of election. The Michigan Constitution allows vacancies on the state Supreme Court to be initially filled by the Governor, with that appointee serving until the next general election, at which time the elected winner is seated to fill the remaining portion of the vacated term. Every two years, the justices elect a member of the Court to serve as Chief Justice.

===Current justices===
Following the 2012 election, the court had a 4–3 conservative Republican majority, with Robert P. Young Jr. serving as Chief Justice. After the resignation of Justice Diane Hathaway and appointment of David Viviano in 2013, there was a 5–2 Republican majority. After the 2018 election, the court reverted to a 4–3 conservative Republican majority with the election of Megan Cavanagh.

In 2020, Bridget Mary McCormack was re-elected as Chief Justice and Elizabeth M. Welch was elected as Justice, giving the Democrats a 4–3 majority on the court starting January 1, 2021. This also made the court majority female for the fourth time in state history. With the election of Kimberly Thomas to succeed retiring Justice David Viviano in 2024, Democrats increased their advantage to a 5–2 majority on the court, starting January 1, 2025.

The current justices of the Michigan Supreme Court are:

<text>The Dutch Wikipedia () is the Dutch-language edition of the free online encyclopedia, Wikipedia. It was founded on 19 June 2001. 

As of 2025, the Dutch Wikipedia is the -largest Wikipedia edition, with articles. It was the fourth Wikipedia edition to exceed one million articles, after the English, German, and French editions. Many articles however have been created by bots and are only a few lines of length, the &quot;article depth&quot; is very low. In April 2016, 1154 active editors made at least five edits in that month.

English is the most popular Wikipedia in the Netherlands, followed by Dutch. In Belgium, Dutch is sometimes the most popular Wikipedia, but French is usually the most popular; in Suriname however, the only Dutch-speaking country outside Europe, Dutch Wikipedia is second after English.

In Curaçao and Aruba, as well in Caribbean Netherlands, it has a presence, but has fewer pageviews than English.
==History==
The Dutch Wikipedia was started on 19 June 2001, and reached 100,000 articles on 14 October 2005. It briefly surpassed the Polish Wikipedia as the sixth-largest edition of Wikipedia, but then fell back to the eighth position. On 1 March 2006, it overtook the Swedish and Italian editions in one day to rise back to the sixth position. The edition&#x27;s 500,000th article was created on 30 November 2008. In a 2006 &quot;Multiscope&quot; research study, the Dutch Wikipedia was rated the third-best Dutch-language website, after Google and Gmail, with a score of 8.1.

The Dutch language Wikipedia has the largest ratio of Wikipedia pages per native speaker of all of the top 10 largest Wikipedia editions. Its rate of daily article creations spiked in March 2006, rapidly growing to an average of 1,000 a day in early May 2006. After this number was reached, growth dropped to an average of only about 250 a day, comparable to the averages around December 2005. Since then, there have been more article-creation surges, one of the largest peaking at 2,000 new articles per day in September 2007, but the growth rate has always returned to the lowest average of around 250.

In 2008, Dutch businessman Bob Sijthoff attempted to sue &quot;the Vereniging Wikimedia Nederland&quot; and &quot;the Stichting Wikimedia Nederland&quot; to force the removal of his Dutch Wikipedia article, which he stated contained &quot;false and abusive&quot; information. On 10 December 2008, the court rejected his request. The judge ruled that he had sued the wrong entity and that legal responsibility for the content of the articles would not lie in the Netherlands, but with the American Wikimedia Foundation.

===Internet bots===
The majority of articles in Dutch Wikipedia (59%) were created by internet bots. In October 2011, several bots created 80,000 articles (then equivalent to 10% of the entire edition&#x27;s article count) in only 11 days.

The Dutch Wikipedia&#x27;s one-millionth article was created in December 2011, after another surge of bot activity saw 100,000 added articles in only 10 days. In late March 2013, the Dutch Wikipedia surpassed the French Wikipedia to become the third-largest edition of Wikipedia. In June 2013, it overtook the German Wikipedia to become the second-largest Wikipedia edition.

==Quality==
===Depth===
The &quot;depth&quot; or &quot;editing depth&quot; of Wikipedia is a rough indicator of the encyclopedia&#x27;s collaborative quality, showing how frequently its articles are updated. The depth is measured by taking the average number of edits per article multiplied by the extent in which articles are supported by discussion (among other things, talk pages). Among the nine language editions with one million articles, the Dutch, Swedish, and Polish Wikipedias in that order have depth parameters much lower than the other six. , for the English version the article depth is 666, for the German 88, for the French 153, for the Spanish 160, for the Dutch only 18.

===Bytes per article===

Compared to most other Wikipedia editions with a similar number of articles, articles on the Dutch Wikipedia have less content with an average of 1,598 bytes per article (). This is roughly 40% of that of the French, German, Italian, Russian, and Spanish editions (3,986–4,277 bytes/article ).

== Culture ==
Dutch Wikipedians responding to a Wikimedia survey described the atmosphere on the Dutch Wikipedia as quarrelsome and distrustful, with ego and stubbornness named as the premier causes of conflict. There is a small hardcore group of users in effective control. New users are discouraged by moderators from joining discussions in the Dutch equivalent of the &quot;Village pump&quot;.

<text>American Freightways Corp. (AF) was an American regional less than truckload (LTL) carrier based in Harrison, Arkansas. It was acquired by FedEx in 2001, renamed FedEx Freight East in 2002, and its operations were merged with FedEx&#x27;s other LTL subsidiaries in 2010 to form FedEx Freight Inc.

==History==
Sheridan Garrison founded The company&quot; Arkansas Freightways&quot;&#x27; on October 25, 1982. At its inception, it provided service to seven states from 20 terminals. Garrison had former experience in trucking, having bought a small Arkansas trucking company, Harp Line Trucks, which they renamed Garrison Motor Freight, in 1955 with his brother and father. By 1987 the company still served seven states but had grown to 58 terminals and had a combined 1,700 tractors and trailers and almost 1,000 employees.

Arkansas Freightways became a publicly held corporation in March 1989 with an over-the-counter stock offering. At the time, it served nine states with 1,200 employees and reported previous year profits of on in revenue. The company continued expansion in November announcing 13 new terminals in Texas bringing the network-wide total to 89.

In January 1993, Arkansas Freightways, which now served 12 states, changed its name to American Freightways Corp..

==FedEx acquisition==

American Freightways was acquired by FedEx Corporation in 2001 for . FedEx created a new subsidiary, FedEx Freight to serve as the parent of both AF and FedEx&#x27;s existing LTL subsidiary, Viking Freight, a western US regional carrier. The combination created the third largest LTL carrier in the United States after Con-way Freight and USFreightways.

In June 2002, FedEx rebranded AF as FedEx Freight East and Viking as FedEx Freight West, both still operated as independent subsidiaries of FedEx Freight. This marked the end of the American Freightways brand. FedEx expanded its LTL operations by buying Lakeland, Florida-based LTL carrier Watkins Motor Lines in 2006. Watkins was renamed FedEx National LTL and initially operated as a separate subsidiary of FedEx alongside FedEx Freight, both part of FedEx&#x27;s FedEx Freight division.

In January 2010, FedEx merged its regional and national operations into a single entity, FedEx Freight Inc. marking the end of independent operations of the former American Freightways. The DOT number, 239039, which was initially assigned to American Freightways, remains in use by FedEx Freight, Inc.

<text>Georg Waitz (9 October 1813 – 24 May 1886) was a German medieval historian and politician. Waitz is often spoken of as the leading disciple of Leopold von Ranke, though perhaps he had more affinity with Georg Heinrich Pertz or Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann. He concentrated on medieval German history.

==Biography==
He was born at Flensburg, in the duchy of Schleswig, and educated at the Flensburg gymnasium and the universities of Kiel and Berlin. The influence of Ranke early diverted him from his original purpose of studying law, and while still a student he began researches in German medieval history, his life&#x27;s work.

On graduating at Berlin in August 1836, Waitz went to Hanover to assist Pertz in publishing the &quot;Monumenta Germaniae historica&quot;; and it led to the chair of history at Kiel in 1842. Waitz began to take an interest in politics, and in 1846 entered the provincial diet as representative of his university. His leanings were strongly German, so that he annoyed the Danish government, and he accepted an invitation in 1847 to become professor of history at the University of Göttingen peculiarly acceptable.

The Revolutions of 1848 delayed Waitz in taking up his new chair. When the German party in Schleswig and the duchy of Holstein rose against the Danish government during the First Schleswig War, Waitz placed himself at the service of the provisional government. He was sent to Berlin to represent the interests of the duchies there, and during his absence he was elected by Kiel as a delegate to the Frankfurt Parliament. He was supported German unification; and when King Frederick William IV of Prussia declined the imperial crown Waitz withdrew from the assembly in disappointment, and left public life.

In the autumn of 1849 Waitz began lecturing at Göttingen, and the reputation of the Göttingen historical school grew. In 1875 he moved to Berlin to succeed Pertz as principal editor of the &quot;Monumenta Germaniae historica&quot;. He travelled to England, France and Italy to collate works preserved there. He died at Berlin on 24 May 1886. He was twice married—in 1842 to a daughter of Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling the philosopher, and in 1858 to a daughter of Jakob von Hartmann.

The violinist Joseph Joachim attended Waitz&#x27;s lectures in 1853.

==Works==
Waitz&#x27;s main works, apart from his contributions to the &quot;Monumenta&quot;, are:

*&quot;Deutsche Verfassungsgeschichte&quot; (8 vols, Kiel, 1844–1878; 2nd ed., 2 vols only, 1865–1870)
*&quot;Schleswig-Holsteins Geschichte&quot; (2 vols, Göttingen, 1851–1854; the 3rd vol. was never published)
*&quot;Lübeck unter Jürgen Wullenwever und die europäische Politik&quot; (3 vols; Berlin, 1855–1856)
*&quot;Grundzüge der Politik&quot; (Kiel, 1862)

Other works include:

*&quot;Jahrbücher des deutschen Reichs unter Heinrich I.&quot; (Berlin, 1837, 3rd ed., 1885)
*&quot;Über das Leben und die Lehre des Ulfila&quot; (Hanover, 1840)
*&quot;Das alte Recht der salischen Franken&quot; (Kiel, 1846)
*&quot;Deutsche Kaiser von Karl dem Grossen bis Maximilian&quot; (Berlin, 1872)

With other scholars, Waitz took a leading part in the publication of the &quot;Forschungen zur deutschen Geschichte&quot; (Munich, 1862 seq.), and in the &quot;Nordalbingische Studien&quot;, published in the &quot;Proceedings&quot; of the Schleswig-Holstein Historical Society (Kiel, 1844–1851). A &quot;Bibliographische Übersicht über Waitz&#x27;s Werke&quot; was published by Ernst Steindorff at Göttingen in 1886.

Obituary notices of Waitz are in the &quot;Historische Zeitschrift&quot;, new series, vol. xx.; in the publications for 1886 of the &quot;Berlin Academie der Wissenschaften&quot;, the &quot;Göttingen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften&quot;, and the &quot;Hansischer Geschichtsverein&quot;; in the &quot;Historisches Jahrbuch der Görres Gesellschaft&quot;, vol. viii.; and in the &quot;Revue historique&quot;, vol. xxxi.

<doc id="1313696" wikidata="Q1355413" url="?curid=1313696" title="Dinner theater">
<text>Dinner theater (sometimes called dinner and a show) is a form of entertainment that combines a restaurant meal with a staged play or musical. In the case of a theatrical performance, sometimes the play is incidental entertainment, secondary to the meal. In the style of a night club, the play may be the main feature of the evening, with dinner less important or optional. &quot;Dinner and a show&quot; can also refer to a restaurant meal in combination with live concert music, where patrons listen to a performance during a break in the meal.

Dinner theater requires the management of three distinct entities: a live theater, a restaurant and, usually, a bar.

==History==
The Madrigal dinners in the Renaissance were early forms of dinner theater. Some early dinner theaters, known as &quot;theatre restaurants&quot;, served dinner in one room and staged the play in another.

===Notable venues in the United States===
====Narroway Productions==== 
Narroway Productions is a Christian Dinner Theatre, founded by Yvonne Clark and Rebecca Martin in September 1996, located in Fort Mill, South Carolina. The theater started out in the &quot;King&#x27;s Arena&quot; amphitheater. After 8 years of performing at the King&#x27;s Arena amphitheater, their lease had ended and they were forced to switch locations.
In 2005 an old gambling warehouse, on Carowinds Blvd, went for sale. after some negotiation, the owner of the warehouse agreed to sell the property to Narroway Productions under value. Since then they have written 3+ new shows, they created 4 shops across the parking lot, and even hosted a golf tournament.

====Barksdale Theatre====
Barksdale Theatre in Richmond, Virginia, founded in 1953 by David and Nancy Kilgore at the Hanover Tavern, was the first formal dinner theater in the United States. After the theatre was established, an adjoining room in the theatre was changed to accommodate a buffet dinner for groups attending the performance, eventually becoming available to all patrons.

====Drury Lane Theatres====
Tony DeSantis opened the Martinique Restaurant in Evergreen Park, Illinois and began producing plays in 1949 in a tent adjacent to the restaurant to attract customers. The enterprise was successful, prompting him to build his first theater, &quot;Drury Lane Evergreen Park&quot; in 1958. It was the first of six dinner theaters he started and a local entertainment fixture for 45 years before closing in 2003. Drury Lane North began operations in 1976 and was sold to the Marriott Lincolnshire Resort, becoming the Marriott Theatre. Drury Lane Oak Brook Terrace opened in 1984. The facility uses local performers and shows are limited to musicals.

====Meadowbrook Theatre Restaurant====
Cedar Grove, New Jersey, was the location of the Meadowbrook Theatre Restaurant, which opened in 1960 with 700+ seats of table service. It closed after 13 years, in part due to nearby competition from Broadway and Actors&#x27; Equity Association (Equity) requirements that the facility follow the rules that applied to Broadway theatres, including pay scales and other restrictions.

====Candlelight Theatre Restaurant====
The first facility where dinner and the show were together in one room was the Candlelight Theatre Restaurant in Washington, D.C. Bill Pullinsi was a theater student in 1959 who conceived and implemented the entertainment concept at the Presidential Arms Hotel during summer breaks. The venture was successful but it was unable to convert to a year-round operation due to the hotel&#x27;s convention business. Pullinsi returned to his Chicago home and opened the Candlelight Dinner Playhouse, first in a building owned by his grandfather, then in a new facility with seating for 550. The Candlelight introduced several innovations, including the hydraulic stage, lighting equipment located in the mezzanine, and stage wagons on wheels.

==== Barn Dinner Theatres ====
Howard Douglass Wolfe, an entrepreneur from Roanoke, Virginia, created the Barn Dinner Theatre franchise and has been called the &quot;Father of Dinner Theater&quot;. He began the franchise in 1961 with Conley Jones. The chain included 27 theaters in New York, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Louisiana, and Georgia. Each franchise featured Wolfe&#x27;s architectural barn designs, farm-themed decorations that included a plow and other tools, and a stage elevator that Wolfe called the &quot;Magic Stage&quot;. At the end of an act or scene, the stage would disappear into the ceiling, then reappear set for the next scene. The whole process took less than a minute. During the franchise phase of The Barn, all the productions were staged at a studio in New York City, then sent out to the individual theaters. At the break-up of the franchise, the production facilities were moved to Nashville. In its early days, the performance&#x27;s cast also served as the waiters and waitresses. Actors were selected and cast in New York and resided in living quarters above the theater for the duration of the productions. Mickey Rooney and many other well-known performers acted in roles at The Barn. 

The Barn in Greensboro, North Carolina, was founded in 1964 and is the oldest continuously running dinner theater in America and the last of the original Barn Dinner Theatres.

==== Chaffin&#x27;s Barn ====
Chaffin&#x27;s Barn in Nashville, Tennessee, opened in 1967, as Nashville&#x27;s first professional theater. Known as a place where many actors landed their first paid professional &quot;gigs&quot;, The Barn was forced to close in October 2020, after 50 years of business due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

====Alhambra Dinner Theatre====
The Alhambra Dinner Theatre in Jacksonville, Florida was opened in 1967 by Leon Simon. It was purchased in 1985 by Tod Booth, who left Chicago&#x27;s Drury Lane Theatres. The Alhambra is the oldest dinner theater still open. The facility uses a thrust stage to provide all 400 seats with an unobstructed view.

====Chanhassen Dinner Theatres====
Chanhassen Dinner Theatres in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area were founded in 1968. 

Chanhassen claims to be the largest professional dinner theater in the U.S. The Main Stage seats 577, the Fireside Theatre contains 230 seats for non-dining patrons, and the Playhouse Theatre has tables for 126. The Main Stage production cast are members of Actors Equity.

Herb Bloomberg, who designed and built the expanded Old Log Theatre near Lake Minnetonka, subsequently constructed and operated the Chanhassen Dinner Theatres. The Old Log Theatre has an attached dining room. Revenue from food sales is necessary for financial success, but is not a dinner theater.

====Carousel Dinner Theatre====
The Carousel Dinner Theatre opened in 1973 and moved to Akron, Ohio in 1988 to what had been a Las Vegas-style nightclub. With 1200 seats, it was the largest dinner theater in the United States until it closed in 2009. Some believe the theater was a victim of the late 2000s US economic crisis, however it was more likely the change in ownership and poor decisions on their part that triggered events leading to the theatre closing.

====Beef &amp; Boards Dinner Theatre====
Beef &amp; Boards Dinner Theatre in Indianapolis, Indiana, opened in 1973 and was one of a chain of dinner theatres founded by J. Scott Talbott. It has a 450-seat house and features Broadway shows and concerts preceded by a buffet dinner. It is a professional Equity theatre.

====Riddlesbrood Touring Theater====
The Riddlesbrood Touring Theater Company stages dinner theater, murder mystery shows, and comedy shows. Based in Stratford, New Jersey, some of their shows have been performed entirely in made-up languages and have incorporated ideas from the New Thought movement.

====Westchester Broadway Theatre====
Westchester Broadway Theatre in Elmsford, NY. The theatre continuously presents Broadway Musical Revivals and many special events and concerts including tribute bands, comedy shows, rock bands, dance shows, magic shows, and more. It is the longest running year-round professional theatre in the State of New York. The Theatre originally opened as An Evening Dinner Theatre on July 9, 1974. In 1991, the theatre moved to a larger performance space with state-of-the-art technology, hydraulic lifts, increased seating capacity, and many other features. The theatre was also given the new name, &quot;Westchester Broadway Theatre&quot;.

The Derby Dinner Playhouse

The Derby Dinner Playhouse in Clarksville, Indiana opened in 1974 and was still open in 2009, operating continuously for 35 years. They utilized a &quot;magic stage&quot; similar to those used by the Barn Dinner Theatre. An orchestra, if utilized, plays in the &quot;attic&quot;, out of sight.

==Popularity and decline==
Dinner theaters as regional entertainments for local audiences in the US peaked in the 1970s. Alhambra Dinner Theatre owner Tod Booth stated that in 1976, there were 147 professional dinner theaters in operation nationwide.
The dinner theaters that used former movie actors to star in the productions were particularly successful. Van Johnson, Lana Turner, Don Ameche, Eve Arden, Mickey Rooney, June Allyson, Shelley Winters, Dorothy Lamour, Tab Hunter, Betty Grable, Sandra Dee, Mamie Van Doren, Joan Blondell, Debbie Reynolds, Cyd Charisse, Kathryn Grayson, Betty Hutton, Jane Withers, Martha Raye, Elke Sommer, Donald O&#x27;Connor, Roddy McDowall, Jane Russell, Cesar Romero, and Ann Miller are just a few Hollywood stars who were featured in dinner theatre. Actors from well remembered television series, such as Betty White, Ann B. Davis, Vivian Vance, Bob Denver, Jo Anne Worley, Bernie Kopell, Dawn Wells, Ken Berry, Gavin MacLeod, Nancy Kulp, Frank Sutton, and Bob Crane were also used as headliners. Burt Reynolds owned a dinner theater in Jupiter, Florida from 1979 to 1997, as did actor Earl Holliman, who owned the &quot;Fiesta Dinner Playhouse&quot; in San Antonio, Texas.

The boom ended in the mid-1980s, with many of the theaters closing. Film and television stars ceased working in dinner theater. Booth commented: &quot;They could make more in a day doing a commercial than they could make during the entire run of dinner theater show, and they didn&#x27;t have to travel. Plus, a lot of the stars just started dying off. It was a fine gig for a while.&quot; He said that, in 1999, you could count the number of surviving professional dinner theaters on two hands. There was a stigma attached to dinner theater and audiences got tired of such shows like &quot;The Last of the Red Hot Lovers&quot; and &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot;.

===Resurgence===
After 2000, new dinner theaters began opening. Chicago&#x27;s original Drury Lane Water Tower Place was founded in 1976, but closed in 1983. A new $7 million version opened in 2004.
The Desert Star Theater in Murray, Utah opened a dinner theater in 2004 and the &quot;Gathering Dinner Theatre&quot; in Jacksonville opened in early 2009. At the end of 2006, the National Dinner Theatre Association had 32 members, compared to 9 in 1999.

The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 led to a resurgence of the form as a way of giving employment back to musicians and entertainment back to patrons in an industry severely affected by closures.

==Different types==
===Union vs. non-union===
In the United States, union theatres are known as &quot;equity theatres&quot;, where performers are members of the Actors&#x27; Equity Association, the union that represents professional stage actors and stage managers. Union shows have a higher cost because equity contracts typically require the theater to pay for lodging, a minimum salary, insurance and pension payments, among other work rules regarding auditions and hiring.

The reduction in professional dinner theaters from 147 in 1976 to 9 in 1999 was partly because union theaters changed to non-union to reduce expenses. Although actors are often housed at non-union theatres, salary for non-union actors may be significantly lower than at Equity theaters.

===Commercial vs. non-profit===
Tony DeSantis commented that theater operations break even at best, while the restaurant and especially the bar, are more likely to be profitable. While many theaters operate as not-for-profit organizations in order to take advantage of grants and funding from government agencies or private foundations, most dinner theaters are commercial businesses. Commercial dinner theatres often have shows six or seven nights a week and matinees. They also have short breaks between shows, usually less than a week.

An example of a non-profit theater is the &quot;Starlight Dinner Theatre&quot; in Lansing, Michigan, where the dinner is catered. The shows are staged at a school and the season includes only four productions with four performances per production (on Friday and Saturday nights).

Some non-profits use amateur actors or casts where the leading role may be a professional with the rest of the cast composed of amateurs.

==Variations==

===Tourist===
Vacation American destinations such as Las Vegas, Destin, Florida, Branson, Missouri, Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, Anaheim, and Los Angeles, California, saw the emergence of specialty dinner theaters, where the show stays the same for an extended run because the vast majority of their customers are tourists, not local residents. The most popular vacation destination in the United States, Orlando, Florida, had more than a dozen dinner theaters operating in 1999; through the 1990s, sixteen opened and closed there.

===Murder mystery===
Murder mystery games are interactive dinner theater events that have become popular on their own. The productions may be public where anyone can attend for the price of admission, or private where a company, social group or organization sponsors an event for its members. While utilizing the &quot;dinner and a show&quot; concept, the murder mystery show generally targets a smaller audience than typical dinner theater. Public performances usually feature professional actors while private showings may offer &quot;roles&quot; to the guests who participate in the production as either characters or detectives.

===Others===
The Wedding Comedy is similar to Murder Mystery as the staging requirements are minimal and the audience has interaction with the actors while they perform. Joey and Maria&#x27;s Comedy Italian Wedding was written by Darlyne Franklin in 1992 and the franchise rights were sold in 2001. Other examples include Tony n&#x27; Tina&#x27;s Wedding and a gay version, Joni and Gina&#x27;s Wedding.

Riverboat Dinner Cruises combine a showboat with a meal. They are limited to locations on a navigable body of water, such as the Showboat Branson Belle or the Goldenrod Showboat.

Madrigal dinners aka &quot;Madrigal Feasts&quot; are seasonal, typically held during the Christmas season. They are often staged by educational or religious entities for fundraising and include food, singing, poetry, humor, costumes, and a play from the Middle Ages, ranging from medieval to the Renaissance periods.

Medieval Times Dinner and Tournament is a chain of dinner theaters with shows featuring horses and jousting.

<doc id="1313701" wikidata="Q6966906" url="?curid=1313701" title="Nashua (horse)">
<text>Nashua (April 14, 1952 – February 3, 1982) was an American-born thoroughbred racehorse, best remembered for a 1955 match race against Swaps, the horse that had defeated him in the Kentucky Derby.

==Background==
Nashua&#x27;s sire was the European champion Nasrullah. The dam was Segula, a broodmare who has had influence through her female descendants.

==Racing career==
Owned by William Woodward Jr.&#x27;s famous Belair Stud in Bowie, Maryland, Nashua was trained by Sunny Jim Fitzsimmons and ridden by jockey Eddie Arcaro. As a two-year-old in 1954, Nashua entered eight races, winning six and finishing second twice, which earned him champion 2-year-old honors. The following year he earned United States Horse of the Year awards from the Thoroughbred Racing Association (with 21 of the 40 votes), and the publishers of Daily Racing Form.

===U.S. Triple Crown series===
Nashua was the betting favorite to win the 1955 Kentucky Derby but was beaten by the second choice, Swaps.

In the 1955 Preakness Stakes, second leg of the Triple Crown, Swaps did not run and Nashua won by a length over a surprisingly strong challenge by Marion duPont Scott&#x27;s colt, Saratoga. Nashua&#x27;s time of 1:54 3/5 for the mile and three-sixteenth race on dirt broke the Pimlico track record.

Swaps did not run in the Belmont Stakes and Nashua, the overwhelming choice of the bettors, romped home nine lengths ahead of his nearest rival Blazing Count with Porterville another five and on-half behind them.

In what would become Nashua&#x27;s most famous race, he defeated Swaps in an August 31, 1955 match race at Chicago&#x27;s Washington Park Race Track.

Nashua would be voted the 1955 American Horse of the Year.

==New owners==
Following the killing of William Woodward Jr., the Belair Stud horses were auctioned off. In 1955, a syndicate purchased Nashua for a record $1,251,200 from the Woodward estate, with majority interests owned by Christopher J. Devine (senior partner and founder of C.J. Devine &amp; Co.); Leslie Combs II; and John Wesley Hanes II, an Under Secretary of the Treasury in the Franklin D. Roosevelt Administration, the head of the New York Racing Association and a part owner in the company that made Hanes hosiery and underwear.
In 1956 the syndicate leased Nashua to Combs to race under the Combs colors.

==Retirement==
At the end of his 1956 season, after thirty career races with a record of 22–4–1, Nashua was retired to stand at stud at Spendthrift Farm in Lexington, Kentucky. He retired as only the second horse to earn more than $1 million. His earnings of $1,288,565 surpassed the great Citation&#x27;s record and stood as the earnings mark until surpassed by Round Table in the autumn of 1958.

At stud, Nashua was consistent, though his fillies were usually better runners than his colts. His progeny included the Hall of Fame racemare Shuvee, Bramalea (the dam of Roberto), Gold Digger (the dam of Mr. Prospector), and Melbourne Cup winner Beldale Ball.

In 1965, Nashua was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. In &quot;The Blood-Horse&quot; ranking of the top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century, he was ranked 24.

Nashua died in 1982 and is buried at Spendthrift Farm. In the mid-eighties, the farm commissioned a statue to be raised over him. The sculptor was Liza Todd, the daughter of Mike Todd and Elizabeth Taylor.

In 2010, sportswriter Bill Christine wrote that Nashua &quot;...belongs on that short list of best horses never to have won the Kentucky Derby&quot;.

<text>A small satellite, miniaturized satellite, or smallsat is a satellite of low mass and size, usually under . While all such satellites can be referred to as &quot;small&quot;, different classifications are used to categorize them based on mass. Satellites can be built small to reduce the large economic cost of launch vehicles and the costs associated with construction. Miniature satellites, especially in large numbers, may be more useful than fewer, larger ones for some purposes – for example, gathering of scientific data and radio relay. Technical challenges in the construction of small satellites may include the lack of sufficient power storage or of room for a propulsion system.

== Rationales ==
One rationale for miniaturizing satellites is to reduce the cost; heavier satellites require larger rockets with greater thrust that also have greater cost to finance. In contrast, smaller and lighter satellites require smaller and cheaper launch vehicles and can sometimes be launched in multiples. They can also be launched &#x27;piggyback&#x27;, using excess capacity on larger launch vehicles. Miniaturized satellites allow for cheaper designs and ease of mass production.

Another major reason for developing small satellites is the opportunity to enable missions that a larger satellite could not accomplish, such as:
* Constellations for low data rate communications
* Using formations to gather data from multiple points
* In-orbit inspection of larger satellites
* University-related research
* Testing or qualifying new hardware before using it on a more expensive spacecraft

== History ==
The nanosatellite and microsatellite segments of the satellite launch industry have been growing rapidly in the 2010s. Development activity in the range has been significantly exceeding that in the range.

In the range alone, fewer than 15 satellites were launched annually in 2000 to 2005, 34 in 2006, then fewer than 30 launches annually during 2007 to 2011. This rose to 34 launched in 2012 and 92 launched in 2013.

European analyst Euroconsult projects more than 500 smallsats being launched in 2015–2019 with a market value estimated at .

By mid-2015, many more launch options had become available for smallsats, and rides as secondary payloads had become both greater in quantity and easier to schedule on shorter notice.

In a surprising turn of events, the U.S. Department of Defense, which had for decades procured heavy satellites on decade-long procurement cycles, is making a transition to smallsats in the 2020s. The office of space acquisition and integration said in January 2023 that &quot;the era of massive satellites needs to be in the rear view mirror for the Department of Defense&quot; with small satellites being procured for DoD needs in all orbital regimes, regardless of &quot;whether it&#x27;s LEO MEO or GEO&quot; while aiming for procurements in under three years. The smaller satellites are deemed to be harder for an enemy to target, as well as providing more resilience through redundancy in the design of a large distributed network of satellite assets.

In 2021, the first autonomous nanosatellites, part of the Adelis-SAMSON mission, designed and developed by the Technion and Rafael in Israel were launched into space. In 2023, SpaceX launched a 20cm quantum communication nano satellite developed by the Tel Aviv University, it is the world&#x27;s first quantum communication satellite. TAU&#x27;s nanosatellite is designed to form a quantum communication network as well as communicate with Earth through an optical ground station.

== Classification groups ==
=== Small satellites ===
The term &quot;small satellite&quot;, or sometimes &quot;minisatellite&quot;, often refers to an artificial satellite with a wet mass (including fuel) between , but in other usage has come to mean any satellite under .

Small satellite examples include Demeter, Essaim, Parasol, Picard, MICROSCOPE, TARANIS, ELISA, SSOT, SMART-1, Spirale-A and -B, and Starlink satellites.

==== Small satellite launch vehicle ====
Although smallsats have traditionally been launched as secondary payloads on larger launch vehicles, a number of companies began development of launch vehicles specifically targeted at the smallsat market. In particular, with larger numbers of smallsats flying, the secondary payload paradigm does not provide the specificity required for many small satellites that have unique orbital and launch-timing requirements.

Some USA-based private companies that at some point in time have launched smallsat launch vehicles commercially:
*Orbital Sciences Corporation&#x27;s Pegasus (rocket)
*Rocket Lab&#x27;s Electron (300 kg)
*Virgin Orbit&#x27;s LauncherOne (500 kg)
*Astra&#x27;s Rocket 3.3 (100 kg)
*Firefly Aerospace&#x27;s Firefly Alpha

=== Microsatellites ===
The term &quot;microsatellite&quot; or &quot;microsat&quot; is usually applied to the name of an artificial satellite with a wet mass between . However, this is not an official convention and sometimes those terms can refer to satellites larger than that, or smaller than that (e.g., ). Sometimes, designs or proposed designs from some satellites of these types have microsatellites working together or in a formation. The generic term &quot;small satellite&quot; or &quot;smallsat&quot; is also sometimes used, as is &quot;satlet&quot;.

Examples: Astrid-1 and Astrid-2, as well as the set of satellites currently announced for &quot;LauncherOne&quot; (below)

In 2018, the two Mars Cube One microsats—massing just each—became the first CubeSats to leave Earth orbit for use in interplanetary space. They flew on their way to Mars alongside the successful Mars &quot;InSight&quot; lander mission.
The two microsats accomplished a flyby of Mars in November 2018, and both continued communicating with ground stations on Earth through late December. Both went silent by early January 2019.

==== Microsatellite launch vehicle ====
A number of commercial and military-contractor companies are currently developing microsatellite launch vehicles to perform the increasingly targeted launch requirements of microsatellites. While microsatellites have been carried to space for many years as secondary payloads aboard larger launchers, the secondary payload paradigm does not provide the specificity required for many increasingly sophisticated small satellites that have unique orbital and launch-timing requirements.

In July 2012, Virgin Orbit announced LauncherOne, an orbital launch vehicle designed to launch &quot;smallsat&quot; primary payloads of into low Earth orbit, with launches projected to begin in 2016. Several commercial customers have already contracted for launches, including GeoOptics, Skybox Imaging, Spaceflight Industries, and Planetary Resources. Both Surrey Satellite Technology and Sierra Nevada Space Systems are developing satellite buses &quot;optimized to the design of LauncherOne&quot;. Virgin Orbit has been working on the LauncherOne concept since late 2008, and , is making it a larger part of Virgin&#x27;s core business plan as the Virgin human spaceflight program has experienced multiple delays and a fatal accident in 2014.

In December 2012, DARPA announced that the Airborne Launch Assist Space Access program would provide the microsatellite rocket booster for the DARPA SeeMe program that intended to release a &quot;constellation of 24 micro-satellites (~ range) each with 1-m imaging resolution.&quot; The program was cancelled in December 2015.

In April 2013, Garvey Spacecraft was awarded a contract to evolve their &quot;Prospector 18&quot; suborbital launch vehicle technology into an orbital nanosat launch vehicle capable of delivering a payload into a orbit to an even-more-capable clustered &quot;20/450 Nano/Micro Satellite Launch Vehicle&quot; (NMSLV) capable of delivering payloads into circular orbits.

The Boeing Small Launch Vehicle is an air-launched three-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle concept aimed to launch small payloads of into low Earth orbit. The program is proposed to drive down launch costs for U.S. military small satellites to as low as per launch ($7,000/kg) and, if the development program was funded, could be operational by 2020.

The Swiss company Swiss Space Systems (S3) has announced plans in 2013 to develop a suborbital spaceplane named &quot;SOAR&quot; that would launch a microsat launch vehicle capable of putting a payload of up to into low Earth orbit.

The Spanish company PLD Space born in 2011 with the objective of developing low cost launch vehicles called Miura 1 and Miura 5 with the capacity to place up to into orbit.

=== Nanosatellites ===
The term &quot;nanosatellite&quot; or &quot;nanosat&quot; is applied to an artificial satellite with a wet mass between . Designs and proposed designs of these types may be launched individually, or they may have multiple nanosatellites working together or in formation, in which case, sometimes the term &quot;satellite swarm&quot; or &quot;fractionated spacecraft&quot; may be applied. Some designs require a larger &quot;mother&quot; satellite for communication with ground controllers or for launching and docking with nanosatellites. Over 2300 nanosatellites have been launched as of December 2023.

A CubeSat is a common type of nanosatellite, built in cube form based on multiples of 10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm, with a mass of no more than per unit. The CubeSat concept was first developed in 1999 by a collaborative team of California Polytechnic State University and Stanford University, and the specifications, for use by anyone planning to launch a CubeSat-style nanosatellite, are maintained by this group.

With continued advances in the miniaturization and capability increase of electronic technology and the use of satellite constellations, nanosatellites are increasingly capable of performing commercial missions that previously required microsatellites.
For example, a 6U CubeSat standard has been proposed to enable a satellite constellation of thirty five Earth-imaging satellites to replace a constellation of five RapidEye Earth-imaging satellites, at the same mission cost, with significantly increased revisit times: every area of the globe can be imaged every 3.5 hours rather than the once per 24 hours with the RapidEye constellation. More rapid revisit times are a significant improvement for nations performing disaster response, which was the purpose of the RapidEye constellation. Additionally, the nanosat option would allow more nations to own their own satellite for off-peak (non-disaster) imaging data collection. As costs lower and production times shorten, nanosatellites are becoming increasingly feasible ventures for companies.

Some examples of nanosatellites are the ExoCube (CP-10), ArduSat, and SPROUT. Nanosatellite developers and manufacturers include EnduroSat, GomSpace, NanoAvionics, NanoSpace, Spire, Surrey Satellite Technology, NovaWurks, Dauria Aerospace, Planet Labs and Reaktor.

==== Nanosat market ====
In the ten years of nanosat launches prior to 2014, only 75 nanosats were launched. Launch rates picked up substantially when in the three-month period from November 2013–January 2014 94 nanosats were launched.

One challenge of using nanosats has been the economic delivery of such small satellites to anywhere beyond low Earth orbit. By late 2014, proposals were being developed for larger spacecraft specifically designed to deliver swarms of nanosats to trajectories that are beyond Earth orbit for applications such as exploring distant asteroids.

==== Nanosatellite launch vehicle ====
With the emergence of the technological advances of miniaturization and increased capital to support private spaceflight initiatives in the 2010s, several startups have been formed to pursue opportunities with developing a variety of small-payload Nanosatellite Launch Vehicle (NLV) technologies.

NLVs proposed or under development include:
* Virgin Orbit &quot;LauncherOne&quot; upper stage, intended to be air-launched from WhiteKnightTwo similar to how the SpaceShipTwo spaceplane is launched.
* Ventions&#x27; Nanosat upper stage.
* Nammo/Andøya &quot;North Star&quot; (polar orbit-capable launcher for a payload)
* , Garvey Spacecraft (now Vector Launch) is evolving their &quot;Prospector 18&quot; suborbital launch vehicle technology into an orbital nanosat launch vehicle capable of delivering a payload into a orbit.
* Generation Orbit is developing an air-launched rocket to deliver both nanosats and microsats to low Earth orbit.

Actual NS launches:
* NASA launched three satellites on 21 April 2013 based on smart phones. Two phones use the PhoneSat 1.0 specification and the third used a beta version of PhoneSat 2.0
* ISRO launched 14 nanosatellites on 22 June 2016, 2 for Indian universities and 12 for the United States under the Flock-2P program. This launch was performed during the PSLV-C34 mission.
* ISRO launched 103 nanosatellites on 15 February 2017. This launch was performed during the PSLV-C37 mission.

=== Picosatellites ===
The term &quot;picosatellite&quot; or &quot;picosat&quot; (not to be confused with the PicoSAT series of microsatellites) is usually applied to artificial satellites with a wet mass between , although it is sometimes used to refer to any satellite that is under 1 kg in launch mass. Again, designs and proposed designs of these types usually have multiple picosatellites working together or in formation (sometimes the term &quot;swarm&quot; is applied). Some designs require a larger &quot;mother&quot; satellite for communication with ground controllers or for launching and docking with picosatellites.

Picosatellites are emerging as a new alternative for do-it-yourself kitbuilders. Picosatellites are currently commercially available across the full range of . Launch opportunities are now available for $12,000 to $18,000 for sub-1 kg picosat payloads that are approximately the size of a soda can.

=== Femtosatellites ===
The term &quot;femtosatellite&quot; or &quot;femtosat&quot; is usually applied to artificial satellites with a wet mass below . Like picosatellites, some designs require a larger &quot;mother&quot; satellite for communication with ground controllers.

Three prototype &quot;chip satellites&quot; were launched to the ISS on on its final mission in May 2011. They were attached to the ISS external platform Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE-8) for testing. In April 2014, the nanosatellite KickSat was launched aboard a Falcon 9 rocket with the intention of releasing 104 femtosatellite-sized chipsats, or &quot;Sprites&quot;. In the event, they were unable to complete the deployment on time due to a failure of an onboard clock and the deployment mechanism reentered the atmosphere on 14 May 2014, without having deployed any of the femtosats.
ThumbSat is another project intending to launch femtosatellites in the late 2010s. ThumbSat announced a launch agreement with CubeCat in 2017 to launch up to 1000 of the very small satellites.

In March 2019, the CubeSat KickSat-2 deployed 105 femtosats called &quot;ChipSats&quot; into Earth orbit. Each of the ChipSats weighed 4 grams. The satellites were tested for 3 days, and they then reentered the atmosphere and burned up.

== Technical challenges ==

Small satellites usually require innovative propulsion, attitude control, communication and computation systems.

Larger satellites usually use monopropellants or bipropellant combustion systems for propulsion and attitude control; these systems are complex and require a minimal amount of volume to surface area to dissipate heat. These systems may be used on larger small satellites, while other micro/nanosats have to use electric propulsion, compressed gas, vaporizable liquids such as butane or carbon dioxide or other innovative propulsion systems that are simple, cheap and scalable.

Small satellites can use conventional radio systems in UHF, VHF, S-band and X-band, although often miniaturized using more up-to-date technology as compared to larger satellites. Tiny satellites such as nanosats and small microsats may lack the power supply or mass for large conventional radio transponders, and various miniaturized or innovative communications systems have been proposed, such as laser receivers, antenna arrays and satellite-to-satellite communication networks. Few of these have been demonstrated in practice.

Electronics need to be rigorously tested and modified to be &quot;space hardened&quot; or resistant to the outer space environment (vacuum, microgravity, thermal extremes, and radiation exposure). Miniaturized satellites allow for the opportunity to test new hardware with reduced expense in testing. Furthermore, since the overall cost risk in the mission is much lower, more up-to-date but less space-proven technology can be incorporated into micro and nanosats than can be used in much larger, more expensive missions with less appetite for risk.

== Collision safety ==

Small satellites are difficult to track with ground-based radar, so it is difficult to predict if they will collide with other satellites or human-occupied spacecraft. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission has rejected at least one small satellite launch request on these safety grounds.

<text>Hebrew Wikipedia (, ) is the Hebrew language edition of Wikipedia. This edition was started on 8 July 2003 and contains more than articles as of 2025.

==History==
===Timeline ===
*8 July 2003: The Hebrew edition of Wikipedia was launched.
* 25 October 2003: The 1,000th article was written.
* 22 July 2004: The first meeting of Hebrew Wikipedians took place in Tel Aviv, Israel.
* 10 September 2004: The 10,000th article was written.
* 20 September 2004: The Hebrew version of the Flag of Kazakhstan article became the one millionth article created in all Wikipedias.
* 24 December 2006: The 50,000th article was written.
* 10 January 2010: The 100,000th article was written.
* 29 August 2013: The 150,000th article was written.
* 28 December 2016: The 200,000th article was written.
*15 September 2019: The 250,000th article was written.
* 3 August 2021: The 300,000th article was written.
Hebrew Wikipedia features several organized article writing projects, among them Wikitort - an academic project to write original articles about tort law, PhysiWiki - a project to write and improve articles about Physics with the cooperation of Weizmann Institute of Science, and ongoing academic projects. Another major topic is Jewish history and the History of Israel. In 2006, the Elef Millim project () was launched to provide Wikipedia with free images. Groups of Wikipedians meet for field trips around the country to take pictures of Israeli sites. 
Hebrew spelling is a matter of debate. Since the standards published by the Academy of the Hebrew Language are not always meticulously followed in common usage, the Hebrew Wikipedia community decides on problematic cases of spelling through discussion and polls to ensure consistency. When technically possible, spelling decisions are periodically enforced using automatic replacement by a bot.

Hebrew Wikipedia&#x27;s requirements for standards are relatively strict.

Hebrew Wikipedia organizes yearly competitions, sometimes with the assistance of the Wikimedia Foundation, as well as social gatherings and picnics.

&quot;Haaretz&quot; journalist Omer Benjakob said in 2023 in relation to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that &quot;Unlike many Wikipedias in languages with a global span, like English, Spanish or Arabic, Hebrew Wikipedia resembles its Polish or Hungarian counterparts in being more of an &quot;Israeli Wikipedia.&quot; It can be seen as having an implicit pro-Israeli bias.&quot;

==2010 Knesset meeting==
On the occasion of the 100,000 articles milestone, the Science and Technology Committee of the Knesset (Israeli parliament) invited Wikipedia contributors and users to the 2 February 2010 morning meeting, to join in a debate about Wikipedia and other open-source resources. Some Wikipedia contributors at the meeting criticized &quot;the lack of government cooperation with their efforts to compile a free online Hebrew-language encyclopedia,&quot; as well as sharing complaints from Wikipedia editors abroad that since the Israel Defense Forces does not release photos for free redistribution on the Internet, the sole source of available pictures for entries such as the Gaza War and the 2006 Lebanon War are the Palestinians.

==Hamichlol==

Hamichlol ( &quot;The Entirety&quot;) is a mirror of the Hebrew Wikipedia. It contains articles copied from the Hebrew Wikipedia which are edited to be acceptable to Orthodox Jewish readers.

== Statistics ==
As of January 2024, the Hebrew Wikipedia ranks among the best language editions in retention of new editors, while also having one of the highest edit revert rates.

<text>Crémazie station () is a Montreal Metro station in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Orange Line. It is located on the border between the boroughs of Ahuntsic-Cartierville and Villeray–Saint-Michel–Parc-Extension The station opened October 14, 1966, as part of the original Metro network.

==Overview==
The station, designed by Adalbert Niklewicz, is a normal side platform station, built in tunnel. A large volume serves as the transept, with three of the four platform stairways in enclosed tunnels. The mezzanine serves two entrances, one on each side of the Autoroute Métropolitaine, and both integrated into buildings; the northern access has doors both in front of and behind the building.

A large ceramic mural by Georges Lauda, Paul Pannier, and Gérard Cordeau, &quot;Le poète dans l&#x27;univers&quot; (&quot;the poet in the universe&quot;), is located on the wall of the large volume, over the Montmorency platform. It commemorates three famous Quebec poets, Octave Crémazie, Émile Nelligan, and Hector de Saint-Denys Garneau, represented by wrought iron masks on the mural.

==Origin of the name==
This station is named for Crémazie Boulevard, in turn commemorating Octave Crémazie (1827–1879), one of Quebec&#x27;s most important poets and the author of &quot;Le Drapeau de Carillon.&quot; The street was so named in 1914.

<text>Jolicoeur () is a station on the Green Line of the Montreal Metro rapid transit system operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM). It is located in the Côte-Saint-Paul district in the borough of Le Sud-Ouest in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The station opened on September 3, 1978, as part of the extension of the Green Line westward to Angrignon.

== Art and architecture ==
Designed by Claude Boucher, it is a side platform station, built in a shallow open cut, with the ticket hall integrated into a large glass-walled entrance pavilion. The design was influenced by the International Style architecture of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. The floor of the platform level is decorated with a series of 42 circular ceramics by the architect.

== Renovation and upgrade works ==
In October 2019, work began to make the station universally accessible. To allow for the installation of elevators, the entrance building was expanded on both sides. As part of the project, a sculpture by Chloé Desjardins entitled &quot;Perspectives&quot; was installed on the main floor overlooking the platforms in June 2022. The work is inspired by the preexisting circular and triangular ceramics in the station. The upgrades were completed in December 2022, making Jolicoeur the 25th accessible station of the Metro, and the 6th station to be made accessible in 2022.

==Origin of the name==
This station is named for rue Jolicoeur. Father Jean-Moïse Jolicoeur founded the parish of Notre-Dame-du-Perpétuel-Secours in 1906; the street was renamed in his honour in 1914.

==Connecting bus routes==
There are no bus bays here and Société de transport de Montréal and RTM Roussillon (CITROUS) buses serve the station from curbside bus stops on Drake Street and Jolicoeur Street.

<text>Don&#x27;t Know How to Party is the third full-length album by the American ska punk band the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, which was released in 1993. &quot;Don&#x27;t Know How to Party&quot; was The Mighty Mighty Bosstones&#x27; major label debut on Mercury Records, their first venture away from their original label Taang! Records. The album reached #187 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and spawned several singles, including the Bosstones fan favorite—&quot;Someday I Suppose&quot; (#19 Billboard Modern Rock Tracks). Lead singer Dicky Barret would later state that, &quot;When we made `Don&#x27;t Know How to Party&#x27;, no one knew where [we] [were] coming from&quot;. Bassist Joe Gittleman stated that the album was &quot;slower than [our] other records.&quot;

==Reception==

Gregory Perez of the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; said that the album &quot;packs quite a wallop. While it isn&#x27;t all ska, as Barrett is quick to point out, it is all Bosstones. Songs such as A Man Without and Issachar maintain the harder-than-calculus anthems that make live Bosstones shows such a brutal pleasure.&quot; AllMusic writer Steve Huey explained that &quot;the lackluster songwriting renders this album necessary for diehards only.&quot;

<doc id="1313717" wikidata="Q911487" url="?curid=1313717" title="Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)">
<text>Romeo and Juliet (), Op. 64, is a ballet by Sergei Prokofiev based on William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. First composed in 1935, it was substantially revised for its Soviet premiere in early 1940. Prokofiev made from the ballet three orchestral suites and a suite for solo piano.

==Background and premiere==
Based on a synopsis created by Adrian Piotrovsky (who first suggested the subject to Prokofiev) and Sergey Radlov, the ballet was composed by Prokofiev in September 1935 to their scenario which followed the precepts of &quot;drambalet&quot; (dramatised ballet, officially promoted at the Kirov Ballet to replace works based primarily on choreographic display and innovation). Following Radlov&#x27;s acrimonious resignation from the Kirov in June 1934, a new agreement was signed with the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow on the understanding that Piotrovsky would remain involved.

However, the ballet&#x27;s original happy ending (contrary to Shakespeare) provoked controversy among Soviet cultural officials. The ballet&#x27;s production was then postponed indefinitely when the staff of the Bolshoi was overhauled at the behest of the chairman of the Committee on Arts Affairs, Platon Kerzhentsev. The ballet&#x27;s failure to be produced in the Soviet Union until 1940 may also have been a result of consequences in the performing arts following &quot;Pravda&#x27;s&quot; denunciation of Dmitri Shostakovich in 1936, as well as other &quot;degenerate modernists&quot; including Piotrovsky. The conductor Yuri Fayer met with Prokofiev frequently during the writing of the music, and he strongly urged the composer to revert to the traditional ending. Fayer went on to conduct the first performance of the ballet at the Bolshoi Theatre.

Suites of the ballet music were heard in Moscow and the United States, but the full ballet premiered in the Mahen Theatre, Brno (then in Czechoslovakia, now in the Czech Republic), on 30 December 1938. This version was a single-act production with music mainly from the first two suites. Prokofiev was not able to attend the premiere due to his status of outbound restriction.

The history of the creation of the ballet was recited by the composer Sergei Prokofiev himself:

== 1940 Kirov production ==

It is better known today from the significantly revised version that was first presented at the Kirov Theatre (now Mariinsky Theatre) in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) on 11 January 1940, with choreography by Leonid Lavrovsky and with Galina Ulanova and Konstantin Sergeyev in the leading roles. Despite the objections of Prokofiev, Lavrovsky significantly changed the score of the ballet. This production received international acclaim and was awarded the Stalin Prize.

In 1955, Mosfilm made the film version of this production with Galina Ulanova as Juliet and Yuri Zhdanov as Romeo. This film won the Best Lyrical Film and nominated as Palme d&#x27;Or in the 1955 Cannes Film Festival.

Original Cast
* Galina Ulanova, Juliet
* Konstantin Sergeyev, Romeo
* Robert Gerbek, Tybalt
* Andrei Lopukhov, Mercutio

==Revivals and other productions==

In 1955, Frederick Ashton choreographed a production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; for the Royal Danish Ballet.

In 1962, John Cranko&#x27;s choreography of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; for the Stuttgart Ballet helped the company achieve a worldwide reputation. It had its American premiere in 1969.

In 1965, choreographer Sir Kenneth MacMillan&#x27;s version for the Royal Ballet premiered at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev danced the title roles. Fonteyn, considered to be near retirement, embarked upon a rejuvenated career with a partnership with Nureyev. Also in 1965, Oleg Vinogradov stages a version in Russia while serving as assistant ballet master to Pyotr Gusev.

In 1971, John Neumeier, partly inspired by John Cranko, created another version of the ballet in Frankfurt. In 1974, Neumeier&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; premiered in Hamburg as his first full-length ballet with the company.

In 1977, Rudolf Nureyev created a new version of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; for the London Festival Ballet, today&#x27;s English National Ballet. He performed the lead role of Romeo with British ballerinas Eva Evdokimova and Patricia Ruanne creating the role of Juliet. As a partnership, they toured the production internationally. Eva Evdokimova danced the leading role Juliet in London and Paris, and it continues to be a popular ballet in the ENB repertoire, with its most recent revival in 2010 staged by Patricia Ruanne and Frederic Jahn of the original 1977 cast. This production was also staged by La Scala Theater Ballet in 1980 and Paris Opera Ballet in 1984 and has been a renowned performance in the POB repertoire.

In 1979, Yuri Grigorovich created a new version for the Bolshoi, &quot;which did away with most of the stage properties and stylized the action into an all-danced text.&quot; This was revived in 2010 and remains in the Bolshoi repertory.

In 1985, choreographer László Seregi&#x27;s production premiered at the Hungarian National Ballet, Budapest.

In 1990, director Armondo Linus Acosta used Prokofiev&#x27;s score, performed by the London Symphony Orchestra, to create a motion picture adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s Romeo and Juliet. Acosta&#x27;s &quot;Romeo.Juliet&quot; was conceived as a film-in-concert with a live orchestra performing the soundtrack, and was performed as such to international acclaim with by conductors such as André Previn, Barry Wordsworth, and Nicholas Cleobury. 

In 1991, Christopher Gable directed his own production for the Northern Ballet Theatre. It was choreographed by Massimo Moricone and featured William Walker as Romeo and Jayne Regan as Juliet.

In 1996, choreographer Jean-Christophe Maillot premiered his version of &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; at Les Ballets de Monte Carlo. Taking formal inspiration from the episodic character of Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s classic score, Maillot structured the action in a manner akin to cinematic narrative. Rather than focusing on themes of political-social opposition between the two feuding clans, this Romeo and Juliet highlights the dualities and ambiguities of adolescence.

In 2007, Peter Martins made &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot; on New York City Ballet to the Prokofiev music.

In 2008, Krzysztof Pastor presented his version by the Scottish Ballet at the Edinburgh Festival Theatre. The Polish premiere of this version was by the Polish National Ballet in Warsaw, and the United States premiere was by the Joffrey Ballet in 2014.

On July 4, 2008, with the approval of the Prokofiev family and permission from the Russian State Archive, the original Prokofiev score was given its world premiere. Musicologist Simon Morrison, author of &quot;The People&#x27;s Artist: Prokofiev&#x27;s Soviet Years&quot;, unearthed the original materials in the Moscow archives, obtained permissions, and reconstructed the entire score. Mark Morris created the choreography for the production. The Mark Morris Dance Group premiered the work at the Fisher Center for the Performing Arts at Bard College in New York state. The production subsequently began a year-long tour to include Berkeley, Norfolk, London, New York, and Chicago.

In 2011, the National Ballet of Canada premiered a new choreography of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; by Alexei Ratmansky in Toronto, with plans to take it on tour in Western Canada in early 2012.

Also in 2011, Graeme Murphy created his version of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; for The Australian Ballet.

In 2015, Stanton Welch premiered his version of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; for Houston Ballet.

In 2019 at the Curve Theatre, Leicester Matthew Bourne choreographed an alternative adaptation of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; set in a mental hospital called &#x27;Verona Institute&#x27;. It was filmed with Cordelia Braithwaite as Juliet, Paris Fitzpatrick as Romeo and Dan Wright as Tybalt.

==Recordings==
Sergei Prokofiev himself made the first recording of music from the ballet, with the Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra in 1938. Since then, there have been recordings of the full score, as well as various excerpts such as the orchestral suites the composer prepared. Leopold Stokowski conducted the NBC Symphony Orchestra in an early stereo recording in 1954. Gennady Rozhdestvensky and the Symphony Orchestra of the Bolshoi Theatre recorded the full score in 1959. André Previn with the London Symphony Orchestra and Lorin Maazel with the Cleveland Orchestra both made recordings of the complete score in 1973; these landmark recordings meant wider Western audiences could hear the full score on disc for the first time, and have served as references since their release. Erich Leinsdorf conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra for an audiophile recording of excerpts on the Sheffield Lab label released in 1978. Michael Tilson Thomas conducted the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra in 1995, in selections from the score, for RCA Victor. Georg Solti conducted the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording coupled with the Classical Symphony. Valery Gergiev made two recordings, with the Kirov Orchestra in 1990 and with the London Symphony Orchestra in 2011.

<text>Michael Herz (born September 28, 1943) is a German businessman, co-owner of the German coffee shop and retail chain Tchibo.

==Family business==
In 1965, after the death of his father Max Herz, who co-founded Tchibo in 1949 with Carl Tchilinghiryan, Herz joined Tchibo as head of sales.

Tchibo is 100% owned by family members. In 2003, along with his mother and brother Wolfgang, he bought out his other brother, Günter Herz, and sister, Daniela Herz-Schnoekel.

In 2007, the Tchibo holding company, changed its name from &quot;Tchibo Holding AG&quot; to &quot;Maxingvest AG&quot;. 

According to Forbes’ list of global billionaires, Herz is listed at number 360 with a net worth of $4.3 billion as of July 8, 2015. He was the 21st richest man in Germany and in 2003 made the top 10.

Michael Herz bought and reorganized the book wholesaler Libri and the florist Blume 2000, and he also prevented the break-up of Beiersdorf AG through his efforts. His investment in Escada turned out to be a failure and ended in bankruptcy.

==Personal life==
He is married and lives in Hamburg.

In 2008, his brother Joachim died in a motorboat accident.

<doc id="1313722" wikidata="Q16331597" url="?curid=1313722" title="Costume design">
<text>Costume design is the process of selecting clothing for a performer to wear. A costume may be designed from scratch or may be designed by combining existing garments. &quot;Costume&quot; may also refer to the style of dress particular to a nation, a social class, or a period. It is intended to contribute to the fullness of the artistic, visual world which is unique to a particular theatrical or cinematic production. Costumes can denote status, age, or personality of a character, or provide visual interest to a character. Costumes may be for a theater, cinema, musical performance, cosplay, parties, or other events.

==History==

Ancient Greek village festivals and processions in honor of Dionysus (See also: Dionysia) are believed to be the origin of theatre, and therefore theatre costume. Sculpture and vase paintings provide the clearest evidence of these costumes. Ritualized masks were used giving each character a specific look. They varied depending on whether they were used for comedic or dramatic purposes. Some masks were constructed with a cheerful as well as a serious side on the same face in an attempt to indicate a change in emotion without a change of mask. The same is true for the Romans, who continued the mask tradition; doubling a mask made doubling roles easier.

During the Late Middle Ages in Europe, dramatic enactments of Bible stories were prevalent, therefore actual Christian vestments, stylized from traditional Byzantine court dress, were worn as costumes to keep the performances as realistic as possible. Stereotypical characterization was key when clothing performers for this style of theatre. In most instances actors had to supply their own costumes when playing a character found in daily life.

Later, in Elizabethan theatre performance during the 16th century and 17th century in England, costume became the most important visual element. Garments were very expensive because only the finest fabrics were used. The majority of characters were clothed in contemporary Elizabethan fashion. The costumes could be divided into five categories: 
&quot;Ancient&quot;, which was out of style clothing used to represent another period; &quot;Antique&quot;, older additions to contemporary clothing to distinguish classical characters; Dreamlike, &quot;fanciful&quot; garments for supernatural or allegorical characters; &quot;Traditional&quot; clothing which represented only a few specific people, such as Robin Hood, or &quot;National or Racial&quot; costumes that were intended to set apart a specific group of people but did not tend to be historically accurate.

&quot;Ordinarily, fashionable garments were used in both comedy and tragedy until 1727, when Adrienne Lecouvreur adopted the much more elaborate and formal court dress for tragedy. Her practice soon became standard for all tragic heroines&quot; Major actors began to compete with one another about who would have the most lavish stage dress. This practice continued until around the 1750s when costumes became relevant to the character again. Art began to copy life and realistic characteristics were favored especially during the 19th century. For example, Georg the second, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen took personal interest in the theatre and began managing troupes. He advocated for authenticity and accuracy of the script and time period, therefore he refused to let actors tamper with their own costumes. He also made sure the materials were authentic and specific, using real chain mail, armor, swords, etc. No cheap substitutes would be allowed.

In August 1823, in an issue of &quot;The Album&quot;, James Planché published an article saying that more attention should be paid to the time period of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, especially when it comes to costumes. In the same year, a casual conversation led to one of Planché&#x27;s more lasting effects on British theatre. He observed to Charles Kemble, the manager of Covent Garden, that &quot;while a thousand pounds were frequently lavished upon a Christmas pantomime or an Easter spectacle, the plays of Shakespeare were put upon the stage with makeshift scenery, and, at the best, a new dress or two for the principal characters.&quot; Kemble &quot;saw the possible advantage of correct appliances catching the taste of the town&quot; and agreed to give Planché control of the costuming for the upcoming production of &quot;King John&quot;, if he would carry out the research, design the costumes and superintend the production. Planché had little experience in this area and sought the help of antiquaries such as Francis Douce and Sir Samuel Meyrick. The research involved sparked Planché&#x27;s latent antiquarian interests; these came to occupy an increasing amount of his time later in life.

Despite the actors&#x27; reservations, &quot;King John&quot; was a success and led to a number of similarly costumed Shakespeare productions by Kemble and Planché (&quot;Henry IV, Part I&quot;, &quot;As You Like It&quot;, &quot;Othello&quot;, &quot;Cymbeline&quot;, &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;). The designs and renderings of &quot;King John&quot;, &quot;Henry IV&quot;, &quot;As You Like It&quot;, &quot;Othello&quot;, &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Merchant of Venice&quot; were published, though there is no evidence that &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Merchant of Venice&quot; were ever produced with Planché&#x27;s historically accurate costume designs. Planché also wrote a number of plays or adaptations which were staged with historically accurate costumes (&quot;Cortez&quot;, &quot;The Woman Never Vext&quot;, &quot;The Merchant&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, &quot;Charles XII&quot;, &quot;The Partisans&quot;, &quot;The Brigand Chief&quot;, and &quot;Hofer&quot;). After 1830, although he still used period costume, he no longer claimed historical accuracy for his work in plays. His work in &quot;King John&quot; had brought about a &quot;revolution in nineteenth-century stage practice&quot; which lasted for almost a century.

In 1923 the first of a series of innovative modern dress productions of Shakespeare plays, &quot;Cymbeline&quot;, directed by H. K. Ayliff, opened at Barry Jackson&#x27;s Birmingham Repertory Theatre in England.


Costumes in Chinese theatre are very important, especially in Beijing Opera. They are usually heavily patterned with intense, bright colors. The standard items consist of at least 300 pieces and indicate the actors character type, age and social status through ornament, design, color and accessories. &quot;Color is always used symbolically: red for loyalty and high position, yellow for royalty, and dark crimson for barbarians or military advisors.&quot; Symbolic significance is also found in the designs used for emblems. For example, the tiger stands for power and masculine strength. A majority of the clothing, regardless of rank, is made out of rich and luxurious materials. Makeup is also used symbolically and completes the overall look.

In Japanese Noh drama masks are always used and the prominent aspect of the costume. They are made of wood and usually last for generations. There are five basic types: male, female, aged, deities and monsters, all with many variations. The masks are changed often throughout the play. 
In Kabuki, another form of Japanese theatre, actors do not wear masks but rely heavily on makeup for the characterizations. Features are exaggerated or removed and for some of the athletic roles musculature is outlined in a specific pattern. Traditional costumes are used for each role, based upon historical garments that are altered for dramatic effect. &quot;Some costumes weigh as much as fifty pounds, and stage attendants assist the actors in keeping them properly arranged while on stage&quot;

In the 21st century digital technologies have ushered in a new era of costume design. Traditionally, theater costumers were manually crafted by hand, through sewing and patterns drafted on paper. Now, theater costumes are able to be designed using 3D printers, modeling software and other digital tools to create costumes more efficiently. Utilizing 3D costume-modeling programs and 3D printers allows designers to come up with the most efficient ways to save the amount of materials used on a project. Designers can optimize material usage with design software, and reduce costs through cheaper materials printed from 3D printing. Moreover, these technologies save on time where models can be adjusted in real time to the corresponding feedback through virtual fittings and sewings.

== Design process ==
The costume design process involves many steps and though they differ from genre to genre a basic method is commonly used. 1. Analysis:
The first step is an analysis of the script, musical composition, choreography, etc. Costume parameters for the show are established and a rough costume plot is created. A costume plot outlines which character is in which scene, when the actors change, and what costumes are mentioned in the script.

2. Design collaboration:
An important phase in the process is when all of the designers meet with the director. There must be a clear understanding of the overall show concept. The designers must all get on the same page with the director in terms of themes for the show and what messages they want the audience to get from the show.

3. Costume research:
Once the director and designers are on the same page, the next step is for the Costume designer to gather research. Costume designers usually begin with research where they find resources to establish the world where the play takes place. This helps the designers establish the rules of the world and then in turn understand the characters better. The designer will then go into broad research about each character to try to establish their personalities though their costume.

4. Preliminary sketching and color layout:
Once enough information is obtained, Costume designers begin by creating preliminary sketches. Beginning with very quick rough sketches the designer can get a basic idea for how the show will look put together and if the rules of the world are being maintained. The Costume designer will then go into more detailed sketches and will figure out the specific costumes and colors for the character. Sketches help see the show as a whole without them having to spend too much time on them.

5. Final sketches:
Once the Costume Designer and the Director agree on the costumes and the ideas are fully flushed out, the designer will create final sketches. These are called renderings and are usually painted with watercolors or acrylic paints. These final sketches show what the designer wants the character to look like and the colors of the costume.

==Production process==
Once the show is designed, it is necessary to plan where the items will be sourced. There are four options. Garments can be: 
* Pulled, which refers to searching through a costume shop&#x27;s stock
* Rented
* Shopped/purchased
* Constructed, or also known as made to order.

There are two ways a garment can begin to be constructed; either pattern drafted or draped, and many times both methods will be used together.
Pattern drafting begins by using a set of basic pattern blocks developed from the actor&#x27;s measurements. They are drawn out on paper first, then transferred to fabric, and sewn together to test fit.

Draping involves manipulating a piece of fabric on a dress form or mannequin that has measurements closely related to the actor&#x27;s. It is a process that takes a flat piece of cloth and shapes it to conform the fabric to a three-dimensional body by cutting and pinning.

Once constructed, however, the costume has not finished &quot;working.&quot; A very important aspect of costumes is the ways they affect actors&#x27; performances and function within their settings. The very best costume designers build their original ideas after assessing the visual and spatial conditions of the costumes.

<text>Verdun station () is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Verdun in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Green Line. It opened on September 3, 1978, as part of the extension of the Green Line westward to Angrignon station.

== Architecture and art ==

Designed by Jean-Maurice Dubé, it is a normal side platform station, built in a deep open cut necessitated by the surrounding Utica shale formation. The ticket hall is located at transept level, and both the mezzanine and platforms are surmounted by high volumes. The volume over the tracks and platforms has a forced perspective; the ceiling lowers and the platform width shortens on the western end of the station. Accesses are located on either side of rue de Verdun.

The artwork running throughout the station consists of concrete walls with bas-reliefs in the upper parts and painted motifs on the lower, which were designed by Claude Théberge and Antoine D. Lamarche.

==Origin of the name==
This station is named for rue de Verdun and for the borough (formerly the city) of Verdun, in front of whose borough office the station is located. The land that would later constitute the borough was granted as a concession to Zacharie Dupuis in 1671; he named it Fief-de-Verdun for his birthplace at Saverdun in the south of France.

<text>The Italian Wikipedia () is the Italian-language edition of Wikipedia. This edition was created on 10 May 2001, and first edited on 11 June 2001. As of , it has articles and more than registered accounts. It is the -largest Wikipedia by the number of articles (after the English, Swedish, German, Dutch, French, Cebuano, Russian, and Spanish editions).

==History==
As early as March 2001, Jimmy Wales, the creator and co-founder of the original English language Wikipedia, had proposed the creation of parallel Wikipedia projects in other languages. The Italian-language version was among the first ones to be created, in May 2001. The original URL was , while the standardized ISO 639 address became active a few days later. Afterwards, Wikipedia sites switched their domains from to . The first pages (circa five hundred) were simply untranslated copies from the English-language Wikipedia; the first edits were made from 11 June 2001, onwards.

One of the earlier edits was an appeal to help Nupedia; the first entries on the Italian Wikipedia were the pages on Dante Alighieri, Petrarch, Manzoni, and other Italian writers. The edits were not numerous, and the priority was initially given to helping Nupedia; the lemmas were just twenty or thirty, and there were about ten users. With the end of the Nupedia project, the situation began to improve for the Italian Wikipedia: users started to sign in, and the functions of and were implemented. This happened by 2004; the number of articles was now .

In August 2005 the Italian Wikipedia overtook the Spanish and Portuguese language editions, becoming the 8th largest edition by article count. The primary reason for the rapid leap from to articles was an automated bot which created stub articles on more than municipalities of Spain in an operation dubbed &quot;&quot;.

On 8 September 2005, the Italian Wikipedia overtook the Dutch Wikipedia and one day later, on 9 September, it passed articles. On 11 September, it overtook the Swedish Wikipedia, becoming the fifth-largest language edition. Again, automated scripts contributed heavily to the growth. For instance, a bot created more than articles on municipalities of France. However, it was overtaken by the Polish edition on 23 September 2005.

In June 2006, Italian Wikipedia users independently created the Template:Bio (with &quot;Bio&quot; being a diminutive of , &quot;biography&quot;). On 23 October, the Polish version again surpassed the Italian Wikipedia by number of articles. As of 16 October 2006, the registered number of users was (90 of which were administrators).

In 2007, the Italian Wikipedia adopted an &quot;&quot;, shared with other Wikipedias. In the same year, on 21 May, there were more than entries. On 22 January 2008, the entries were ; on 3 October, they were . The number of users had reached .

In 2009 the Italian Wikipedia was awarded the Premiolino, the oldest and most prestigious Italian journalism prize, in the new media category.

On 22 June 2010, it passed articles (Robie House – 700,000th article). On 28 September 2010, the Italian Wikipedia overtook the Polish Wikipedia, becoming the 4th largest edition, though in October 2010 the numbers on both Wikipedias were very close, and as of 2011 the Polish Wikipedia was in the lead again.
On 12 May 2011, it passed articles. On the same day, it overtook the Polish Wikipedia. On 12 March 2012, it passed articles. On 22 January 2013, it passed articles.

In April 2016, the project had 2233 active editors who made at least five edits in that month, and as of March 2022, the project has 121 administrators.

==2011 mass blanking protest==
From 4 to 6 October 2011, following a decision adopted by volunteers of the Italian Wikipedia community, a knowledge blackout was in place. During this time, all of the site&#x27;s articles were hidden and the website was blocked by its administrators, as a protest against the &quot;DDL intercettazioni&quot; (&quot;Wiretapping Bill&quot;), which was being debated at the time in the Chamber of Deputies of the Italian parliament.

The controversy largely centered on paragraph 29 of the proposed bill. According to a public statement by editors of the Italian Wikipedia:

The bill allowed for a fine of between €9,500 and €12,000.

This was the first time that a Wikipedia had blanked all its content to protest. The Wikimedia Foundation officially supported the decision of the Italian Wikipedia by a statement released the same day. the manifesto, which replaced the Italian Wikipedia, had been viewed approximately 8 million times. On 6 October 2011, the website content was restored, with a banner across the top of each page explaining the reason for the protest.

==Other shutdowns==

On 18 January 2012, the English Wikipedia was shut down for 24 hours, following a decision by contributors to protest against two bills being examined by the Congress of the United States: the Stop Online Piracy Act and the Protect Intellectual Property Act. On that day, the Italian Wikipedia redirected users from its own main page to a black page with a message of support for the decision of the English encyclopedia. Users could then click to access the Italian encyclopedia&#x27;s content normally.

On 10 July 2012, when the Russian Wikipedia was closed to protest State Duma’s debating of amendments to the law &quot;On information&quot; (Law Project No. 89417-6), the Italian Wikipedia displayed a site-wide banner supporting the protest.
In November 2012, messages appeared on the Italian Wikipedia protesting the Italian Senate&#x27;s Bill #3491, 3204, 3.400 and especially 3.207.
From 3 to 5 July 2018, to protest the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market, the Italian Wikipedia displayed a site-wide banner supporting the protest, and disabled all searches and contributions.
From 25 March 2019 for the following 24 hours, Italian Wikipedia contents were not accessible, replaced by a message encouraging the readers to contact their European Parliament representatives to vote against Article 11 and Article 13 of the European Copyright Directive to be discussed on 26 May.

== Features ==

* The Italian Wikipedia currently accepts free images licensed under the GFDL and Creative Commons. Fair use images have been rejected since April 2006 due to potential copyright problems, and many of them were subsequently replaced during 2007 with equivalents which follow Italian law.
* The Italian Wikipedia has used automated scripts to create articles, much like the English Wikipedia.
* Administrators are elected through a vote; a minimal quorum of 65–70 voters and 80% of support votes are required if the request is to be considered successful. Any administrator is automatically open to recall after a year of service. The community then decides whether to let them keep the role or not with a vote. Administrators who have been inactive (have not used any administrative tools such as the &quot;delete&quot; or &quot;block&quot; buttons) for six months automatically lose their privileges.

<text>De L&#x27;Église station () is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Verdun in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Green Line. The station opened on September 3, 1978, as part of the extension of the Green Line westward to Angrignon station.

== Architecture and art ==

Designed by Jean-Maurice Dubé, it was planned as a normal side platform station. However, during the station&#x27;s construction, a cave-in of the surrounding weak Utica Shale formation made it necessary to build the station with a narrower profile. It is therefore built with stacked platforms, with the Honoré-Beaugrand platform above and Angrignon below, and both directions opening to the left instead of the usual right. There are two accesses, one in the centre and one at the western end of the station, with separate ticket halls.

The station is decorated with a series of circular motifs in ceramic tile on the lower levels and concrete bas-reliefs in the upper levels by Claude Théberge and Antoine D. Lamarche.

In 2022, the STM&#x27;s Universal Accessibility Report noted that design work to make the station accessible was underway.

==Origin of the name==
This station is named for Rue de l&#x27;Église, in turn named for the Église Notre-Dame-des-Sept-Douleurs near the station. (The roadway continues into Côte-Saint-Paul under the name Avenue de l&#x27;Église, itself named for the Église Saint-Paul in that neighbourhood.) This roadway has existed since at least 1834; the portion in Verdun, previously called rue du Pavillon, became known as rue de l&#x27;Église or Church Street following the construction of the first Église Notre-Dame-des-Sept-Douleurs in 1899.

<text>LaSalle station () is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Verdun, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Green Line. The station opened on September 3, 1978, as part of the extension of the Green Line westward to Angrignon station.

== Architecture and art ==
Designed by Didier, Gillon et Larouche, it is a normal side platform station with one ticket hall and access. The platform and mezzanine walls are enlivened by large, irregular concrete planes painted in bright colours, designed by Michèle Tremblay-Gillon, while a stainless-steel mural by Peter Gnass above the ticket hall reflects sunlight and passengers&#x27; movements.

==Origin of the name==
This station is named for nearby LaSalle Boulevard, named for explorer Robert Cavelier de La Salle (1643–1687), who founded the town of Lachine and claimed Louisiana for France.

Since the station is not located in the neighbouring borough of LaSalle, alternative names have been proposed, including Paul-Grégoire and Curé-Caisse; the latter name was approved by the Montreal Urban Community in 1984, but for unknown reasons the name change was not carried out.

<text>Charlevoix station () is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Le Sud-Ouest in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Green Line. It is located in the district of Pointe-Saint-Charles. It opened on September 3, 1978, as part of the extension of the Green Line westward to Angrignon station.

== Architecture and art ==
Designed by Ayotte et Bergeron, it was built as a stacked platform station, in order to reduce the width of the station owing to the weak Utica Shale in which it was built. The lower (Honoré-Beaugrand) platform is below the surface, making this the deepest station in the network, as well as the lowest in altitude (the lower platform is below sea level).

The station has one ticket hall and one access. The long stairways to the platforms, built around a light shaft, are brightened by two stained-glass windows by Mario Merola and Pierre Osterrath.

==Origin of the name==
This station is named for rue Charlevoix. Pierre François Xavier de Charlevoix (1682–1761) was a French Jesuit historian and explorer of New France.

==Connecting bus routes==

The buses at Charlevoix use its bus loop which is under an OMHM apartment building.

<doc id="1313735" wikidata="Q73439" url="?curid=1313735" title="Richard Schulze-Kossens">
<text>Richard Schulze-Kossens (2 October 1914 – 3 July 1988, born &quot;Richard Schulze&quot;) was a Nazi Party member and SS commander during the Nazi era. Before and during World War II, he served as a personal adjutant to foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop. He also served at different intervals, as an ordinance officer and SS adjutant for Adolf Hitler and later commanded the SS Division Nibelungen, SS-Junkerschule Bad Tölz. After the war in Europe ended, he was held in an American internment camp for three years and died in 1988.

==SS career==
Richard Schulze was born in Spandau, Berlin. A year after graduating from gymnasium in 1934, the 20-year-old Schulze entered the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; and was assigned to &quot;6.SS-Standarte&quot; in Berlin. In November 1934, he served in the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH), one of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s SS bodyguard units. Between 1935 and 1937 took various officer training courses at the SS-Junkerschule Bad Tölz, in Jüterbog and Dachau. In May 1937, Schulze became a member of the Nazi Party. Schulze served as personal adjutant to Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop from April 1939 until January 1941. Schulze is pictured standing with Molotov, Ribbentrop, Stalin and Soviet Chief of Staff Shaposnikov at the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of 23 August 1939.

From October 1941 and at intervals thereafter, he was an SS ordinance officer and SS adjutant for Adolf Hitler. While serving in these roles, Schulze was also a member of the &quot;Führerbegleitkommando&quot; (FBK), which provided personal security for Hitler. In December 1942, Hitler transferred some of the command authority of the FBK to Schulze. He was placed in charge of administration, guidelines for training, discipline, deployment and transfer of members of the unit. By 1944, he was promoted to the rank of SS-&quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; (lieutenant colonel). He became the divisional commander of the 38th SS Division Nibelungen in 1945. At that time, Schulze was the commanding officer of the &quot;SS-Brigade Nibelungen&quot; and the SS cadet training school at Bad Tölz.

==Later life==
After the Second World War ended, Schulze changed his name to &quot;Richard Schulze-Kossens&quot;. He was held in an American internment camp for three years. After being released, he worked as a salesman and wrote several books.

He remained in contact with a group of former adjutants, secretaries and other staff members who continued to have a favourable view of Hitler following the end of the war. Schulze-Kossens died of lung cancer on 3 July 1988. More than 100 former SS members attended his funeral, with many wearing the insignia of an SS veterans association, and his casket was draped with tributes from former SS units. Werner Grothmann and two former Nazi officers provided eulogies.

<text>Atwater station is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Ville-Marie in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Green Line on the border between the city of Westmount and Montreal.

The station opened on October 14, 1966, as part of the original network of the Metro; it was the western terminus of the Green Line until the extension to Angrignon in 1978.

== Architecture and art ==
Designed by David, Boulva et Cleve, it is a normal side platform station, built in open cut under the De Maisonneuve Boulevard. It has a large mezzanine with ticket barriers on either end. It has underground city connections to Place Alexis Nihon, Westmount Square, and Dawson College.

In August 2016, the Dawson exit was closed for refurbishment. In January 2017 the Cabot Square entrance was closed for major renovations and also to make the building unwelcoming to drug use and violent gangs on the premises.

, work is underway to make the station universally accessible. Phase 2 of this project has begun in 2024.

The station is equipped with MétroVision information screens which display news, commercials, and the time until the next train.

==Origin of the name==
This station is named after Atwater Avenue, which itself was named in honor of Edwin Atwater (1808–1874). Edwin Atwater was a municipal alderman of the Saint-Antoine district. The street was officially named after him in 1871.

<text>The Polish Wikipedia () is the Polish-language edition of Wikipedia, a free online encyclopedia. Founded on 26 September 2001, it now has more than articles, making it the -largest Wikipedia edition overall. It is also the second-largest edition in a Slavic language, after the Russian Wikipedia.

==History==
The Polish Wikipedia was created in September 2001 under the domain wiki.rozeta.com.pl. It was originally hosted by a server in a shoebox inside the wardrobe of one of its founders, Paweł Jochym. At the suggestion of the founders of the English Wikipedia, the site was incorporated into the international project as http://pl.wikipedia.com on 12 January 2002, and as http://pl.wikipedia.org on 22 November that year. To avoid domain squatting that could frustrate potential users, the Polish Wikipedia also has its own domain, wikipedia.pl, which redirects to pl.wikipedia.org.

On 27 January 2005, the founders of the Polish Wikipedia, Krzysztof P. Jasiutowicz and Paweł Jochym, received the Internet Citizen of the Year 2004 award issued by the Internet Obywatelski (&quot;Public Internet&quot;) society.

In July 2005, the &quot;tsca.bot&quot; bot program was instructed to upload statistics from official government pages about French, Polish, and Italian municipalities to the Polish Wikipedia. In a few months, the bot uploaded more than 40,000 articles. On 13 October 2009, the Polish Wikipedia received a &quot;special recognition for social innovation&quot; at the 2009 Jan Łukasiewicz Award ceremony, which recognises the most innovative Polish IT companies. The Polish Wikipedia exceeded 1,000,000 articles on 24 September 2013. In April 2016, the project had 1,140 active editors who made at least five edits in that month.

==Polish Wikipedia on DVD==

The text of the Polish Wikipedia was first published on a DVD together with the paper edition of the magazine &quot;Enter SPECIAL&quot; in August 2005. The publisher did not make any attempt to contact the Wikimedia Foundation prior to making the DVD available on the market, and the edition itself turned out to be illegal, as it violated the GNU FDL license. Additionally, the software used on the DVD worked improperly on Microsoft Windows 98.

A second DVD edition was prepared as a joint project of Wikimedia Polska (the Polish branch of the Wikimedia Foundation) and the Polish publisher Helion. It contained articles written before 4 June 2006. The edition was completed on 24 November 2006, and released at the end of July 2007 with a purchase price of 39 zlotys.

<text>The Philadelphia Police Department (PPD, Philly PD, or Philly Police) is the police agency responsible for law enforcement and investigations within the County and City of Philadelphia. The PPD is one of the oldest municipal police agencies, fourth-largest police force and sixth-largest non-federal law enforcement agency in the United States. Since records were first kept in 1828, at least 289 PPD officers have died in the line of duty.

The Philadelphia Police Department has a history of police brutality, intimidation, coercion, and disregard for constitutional rights, particularly during the tenure of Frank Rizzo as police commissioner (1967–1971) and mayor (1972–1980). The patterns of police brutality were documented in a 1978 Pulitzer Prize–winning &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; series by William K. Marimow and Jon Neuman.

==History==
===19th century===
In 1797, Philadelphia established a night watch, and employed its first police officers to patrol the streets in daytime in 1833. The two entities were combined in 1854 to form the Philadelphia Police Department, which was modeled on London&#x27;s Metropolitan Police.

In 1870, a Philadelphia policeman shot and killed Henry Truman, an unarmed Black man in an alley. He was found guilty of manslaughter.

In 1887, the police department was put under control of the city&#x27;s Department of Public Safety. Two years later, the PPD inaugurated its mounted patrol, which was disbanded in 2004 but restored in 2011.

===20th century===

In 1913, L. M. Gillespie became one of the first women police officers in Philadelphia. Major race riots broke out in 1919 and 1964.

A well publicized raid of the Black Panther Party occurred September 1, 1970. During the weekend of August 29–30, 1970, seven Philadelphia policemen were shot during widespread racial tension.

In 1974, the Pennsylvania Crime Commission&#x27;s &quot;Report on Police Corruption and the Quality of Law Enforcement in Philadelphia&quot; concluded &quot;that police corruption in Philadelphia is ongoing, widespread, systematic, and occurring at all levels of the police department. Corrupt practices were uncovered during the investigation in every police district and involved police officers ranging in rank from policeman to inspector. Specific acts of corruption involving improper cash payments to the police by gamblers, racketeers, bar owners, businessmen, nightclub owners, after-hours club owners, prostitutes, and others are detailed in the report. More than 400 individual police officers are identified by first name, last initial, and badge or payroll number as receiving improper payments in terms of cash, merchandise, sexual services, or meals.&quot;

A 1978 Pulitzer Prize-winning series in &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; by William K. Marimow and Jon Neuman documented extensive patterns of police brutality in the PPD. The tenure of Frank Rizzo as police commissioner (1967–1971) and mayor (1972–1980) has frequently been characterized as a period in which the PPD engaged in extensive police brutality and discriminatory policing.

In 1985, federal judge Clarence Charles Newcomer criticized the PPD for indiscriminately arresting a number of Spanish-speaking people after an officer was killed, calling the arrests &quot;unlawful&quot; and &quot;disgraceful&quot;.

In 1985, a residential eviction against an anarcho-primitivist organization called MOVE lead to a shootout between the group and the PPD. During the standoff, a PPD Lieutenant in a PA State Police helicopter dropped C-4 onto a bunker on the roof of the house, often referred to as the MOVE compound. This caused a fire that killed six adults and five children in the house, and burned 65 other houses to the ground. The incident was investigated by the Philadelphia Special Investigation Commission (MOVE).

===21st century===
In 2000, carjacking/shooting suspect Thomas Jones was beaten while wounded by more than one dozen law enforcement officers.

In 2012, the PPD&#x27;s education and/or experience requirements were increased to include at least one of four new options, including 60 college credits.

In 2017, the PPD announced they would be moving the headquarters to the old Inquirer Building.

In 2018, the Philadelphia Police Department&#x27;s Gun Violence Reduction Task Force (G.V.R.T.F.) was founded within the Detective Bureau. The Task Force is staffed entirely by Detectives, and was created to focus on violent offenders &amp; prior convicts (felons) in possession of firearms. 

In 2019, 72 Philadelphia police officers are taken off street duty over racist and hateful Facebook posts. In 2019, August 2019 Philadelphia shooting: Six PPD officers are shot and injured while serving a drug warrant.

In 2019, Commissioner Ross resigns amid sexual harassment claims within the organization.
In 2020, during the George Floyd protests in Philadelphia, Police Staff Inspector Joseph Bologna was suspended and charged with aggravated assault after he allegedly hit a student protester with a baton. Other incidents caught on video involving Bologna regarding the 2020 protests saw him tackling a female protester who had touched his bicycle, lunging at a journalist, and hitting a security guard. Previously in the 2000s, Bologna was videoed instructing his officers to turn off security cameras for a raid, and was suspended for &quot;failing to properly supervise&quot;. A West Philadelphia unit he managed in the 2010s accumulated many misconduct complaints. Bologna was later found &quot;Not Guilty&quot; by a jury.

In 2021, the city of Philadelphia paid $2 million to a Black woman who in 2020 was pulled from a car and beaten by PPD officers, as well as separated from her toddler for hours. The Fraternal Order of Police posted pictures on social media claiming &quot;This child was lost during the violent riots in Philadelphia, wandering around barefoot in an area that was experiencing complete lawlessness. The only thing this Philadelphia Police Officer cared about in that moment was protecting this child.&quot; The officers involved in the beating of the woman and her separation from the toddler have since been fired.

In 2021, a PPD Detective was reassigned and investigated after the department received evidence indicating she had attended the January 6 rally in support of overturning the 2020 presidential election result that preceded the U.S. Capitol attack. The investigation revealed the Detective did not participate in the riot, and did not enter the Capitol building.

A 2021 report found that of more than 9,000 civilian complaints against PPD officers, &quot;only 0.5% of civilian allegations resulted in any recorded consequence beyond a reprimand.&quot; The study found that not a single allegation of civil rights violations (including racial profiling and racial slurs by officers) was upheld.

In 2023, Philadelphia police shot and killed Eddie Irizarry during a traffic stop; the initial narrative given by Philadelphia police was that Irizarry was outside his vehicle, told by officers to drop a weapon, and &quot;lunged at the officers&quot;, prompting the shooting. A day later, Philadelphia police admitted that Irizarry was actually inside his car during the shooting. Body camera footage showed Irizarry being shot through his car&#x27;s rolled-up driver-side window, around five seconds after the shooting officer alighted from a police car. The shooting officer has been charged with murder. In September 2023, the charges were dismissed by Municipal Judge Wendy Pew.

In late October 2023, Officer Patrick Heron accepted a plea deal that would place him in confinement for between fifteen and forty years. He had been accused of 200 counts related to charges of unlawful contact, sexual abuse of children, and forgery.

=== Notable investigations ===
*1894-95, Detective Frank P. Geyer investigated H. H. Holmes, one of America&#x27;s first serial killers who confessed to killing twenty-seven men, women, and children, some of which were later determined to be alive. Holmes killed his business partner, Benjamin Pitezel, in Philadelphia and later killed three of Pitezel&#x27;s young children (two in Irvington, and one in Canada). Detective Geyer is credited with finding the bodies of the three children after a cross-country, international investigation. 
*1981, PPD Officer Daniel Faulkner was fatally shot by Mumia Abu-Jamal (né Wesley Cook) while performing a routine traffic stop of the latter&#x27;s brother, William Cook. A jury convicted Abu-Jamal, a former Black Panther Party member, of first degree murder. He was sentenced to death in 1982, but in 2011 prosecutors said they would drop their pursuit of his execution and agreed to accept &quot;de facto&quot; life imprisonment without parole. The incident, subsequent trial and Abu-Jamal&#x27;s conviction remain controversial in the US and around the world.
*1999, serial killer Gary Heidnik was executed by lethal injection. Heidnik kidnapped, tortured and raped six women and kept them prisoner in his Philadelphia basement. A jury convicted Heidnik of the first degree murders of two of the women and sentenced him to death.
*2001, American Ira Samuel Einhorn, a.k.a. &quot;The Unicorn Killer&quot; (born May 15, 1940), was extradited from France back to Philadelphia to stand trial for the 1977 murder of Holly Maddux. Einhorn was an outspoken activist in the 1960s and &#x27;70s. In 1981, Einhorn fled to Europe to avoid the trial. In 1993, Einhorn had a trial in absentia and was convicted of first degree murder. In 2002, he was retried and again convicted. Einhorn was sentenced to life in prison without parole.
*2012, Antonio Rodriguez, a.k.a. &quot;The Kensington Strangler&quot;, received three life sentences for murdering three women in 2010. PPD Homicide Detectives obtained a confession from Rodriguez after he was arrested.
*2013, a federal jury convicted drug lord Kaboni Savage and his sister, Kidada, of orchestrating the 2004 firebomb murders of a witness&#x27;s six family members and of conspiring to participate in a violent drug enterprise. The jury convicted Kaboni of 12 murders in total and he was later sentenced to death.

==Organization==
The PPD employs over 6,400 sworn officers and over 800 civilian personnel, and patrols an area of 369.4 km2 (142.6 mi2) with a population of almost 1.5 million. The department is subdivided into 21 patrol districts, and like many other large municipal police forces, it incorporates many special units such as a K-9 Unit, SWAT, Bomb Squad, Community Relations Unit, Marine Unit, Narcotics Unit, and Highway Patrol Unit.

The head of the PPD is the Police Commissioner, who is appointed by the Mayor. The current Commissioner is Kevin Bethel.

Under the Commissioner are two three-star Deputy Commissioners. The First Deputy Commissioner heads Field Operations. The Deputy Commissioner and Chief Administrative Officer heads Organizational Services, Strategy, and Innovation.

The Office of Field Operations is headed by the three-star First Deputy Commissioner of Field Operations. The current First Deputy Commissioner is John Stanford. The force comprises two commands, Patrol Operations and, Specialized Operations and Homeland Security; each command is headed by a two-star Deputy Commissioner. The Investigations Command is headed by a two star Deputy Commissioner. The two star Deputy Commissioner of Investigations is in charge of the Detective Divisions and Special Investigation Units/Divisions. The Detective Bureau is divided into two elements, with one Chief Inspector overseeing Detective Divisions, and a second Chief Inspector overseeing Special Investigation Units.

The Office of Organizational Services, Strategy, and Innovation is headed by the three-star Deputy Commissioner and Chief Administrative Officer.

Patrol Operations is headed by a two-star Deputy Commissioner of Patrol Operations. Patrol Operations is divided into two regional commands, Regional Operations Command (North) and Regional Operations Command (South). Each regional command is headed by a Chief Inspector, and is subdivided into three divisions (ROC-North: East, Northwest, Northeast; ROC-South: Central, Southwest, South). Each patrol division is headed by an Inspector. A division comprises three or four districts; there are 21 patrol districts in all, and each district is headed by a captain. Each District is subdivided into three or four police service areas (PSA&#x27;s), each headed by a Lieutenant, for a total of 64 PSA&#x27;s citywide.

In January 2013, Commissioner Ramsey announced changes to the command structure of the department lowering the number of deputy commissioners from 9 to 6. Ramsey only replaced one of the deputies who was promoted from staff inspector of the Internal Affairs Bureau to deputy commissioner of the Office of Professional Responsibility. 

===Mounted units===

The beginnings of the mounted unit can be traced to the Fairmount Park Mounted Guard created in 1867. In 1889 the Philadelphia Police Mounted Patrol Unit was established. The Philadelphia Police unit survived until 1952, however, the Fairmount Park unit would be used for parades and crowd control measures. The Fairmount Park Mounted Guard became the Fairmount Park Police in 1966, but maintained the same responsibilities. In 1972, Mayor Frank Rizzo found it unnecessary for taxpayers to fund two separate police departments, and merged the Fairmount Park Police into the Philadelphia Police, creating the Park Division. The mounted unit was once again used to patrol the streets of Philadelphia. The mounted unit survived to celebrate 100 years in 1989, but was disbanded in 2004 due to budgetary cuts by Mayor John F. Street&#x27;s administration.

On July 18, 2008, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles H. Ramsey confirmed that plans are in the works to recreate the mounted unit.

&quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; again reported on June 2, 2009, that Ramsey hoped to revive the unit once the city was in a better financial standing.

The continued recreation of the Mounted Unit took an additional step forward on October 31, 2011, when the city announced plans to build a new facility for the unit in Fairmount Park.

==Ranks within the Philadelphia Police Department==

===Rank descriptions===
To be promoted in the Philadelphia Police Department, police officers must finish their first year in the department. Then, when the next Corporal or Detective test is announced, they are eligible to take the test. Philadelphia PD Test for Corporal and Detectives is a written multiple choice test, lasting two to three hours. Also part of an officer&#x27;s score is based on seniority.

The ranks of Corporal and Detective have the same pay grade, but have different functions. The rank of Corporal is the first supervisory rank. Corporals are &quot;Operations Room supervisors&quot; and are responsible for overseeing a patrol district&#x27;s operations room, or a special unit&#x27;s operations; i.e., ensure that reports are submitted accurately and in a timely manner, etc. Only rarely do Corporals work the street. (A notable exception is Corporals in the SWAT Unit and Narcotics Bureau. Corporals in these assignments frequently work on the street.) A Corporal must have a minimum of a year&#x27;s experience as a police officer.

Sergeants command a squad of officers, making assignments to beats, assigning traffic details, helping to supervise the radio room, commanding Marine Unit patrol boats and performing other similar tasks. When assigned to the Detective Bureau, a Sergeant interviews suspects and witnesses, assigns Detectives to cases and investigates clues, among other duties. Sergeants must have a minimum of two years experience as a Police Officer, or a year&#x27;s experience as a Corporal or Detective.

The rank of Lieutenant is a managerial rank. Lieutenants command an assigned area in a police district or a specialized unit, such as a traffic unit. If assigned to the Detective Bureau, a Lieutenant supervises an investigation. Lieutenants must have a minimum of one year&#x27;s experience as a sergeant.

The rank of Captain is the first command rank. Captains either command police districts or direct the activities of a specialized unit. When assigned as a detective, a Captain organizes and directs surveillance activities and police raids, prepares cases, interviews and interrogates suspects and testifies in court. Captains must have a minimum of one year&#x27;s experience as a Lieutenant.

Staff inspectors are usually departmental administrative officers, serving on the police Command Staff under a commissioner or deputy commissioner. They are generally assigned to inspect police divisions, districts and units, evaluate police practices, equipment and personnel, and make recommendations for improvement where necessary; however, they may also command units and divisions. Staff Inspectors must have a minimum of one year&#x27;s service as a captain.

Inspectors are senior executive officers who typically command divisions and supervise officers under their command during any major police action, disaster or emergency. Inspectors must have a minimum of one year&#x27;s service as a Staff Inspector or Captain.

Chief Inspectors are senior departmental administrative officers who either command bureaus within the department or are in charge of a regional command.They also inspect police divisions, districts and units, evaluate police practices, equipment and personnel, and make recommendations for improvement where necessary. Chief Inspectors must have a minimum of one year&#x27;s service as a Staff Inspector.

Deputy Commissioners and above are appointed by the city managing director with mayoral approval, not by the city civil service. The two First Deputy Commissioners head the Office of Field Operations and the Office of Organizational Accountability. The commissioner is appointed by the city managing director with mayoral approval, and is in charge of the entire department.

===Detectives===

Detectives are part of the Detective Bureau, and may be assigned to Detective Divisions, or specialized units like Homicide, Shooting Investigation Group, Organized Crime/Intelligence, Special Victims Unit, Gun Permits Unit and Background Investigation. The commanding officer of a detective division (a Captain) reports to the Inspector of Detective Bureau Headquarters. The ranking supervisor at Detective Bureau Headquarters is the Chief Inspector of the Detective Bureau. Detectives are not considered supervisory personnel, despite being equivalent to a Corporal in pay grade. Detectives are a civil service rank of their own, and take orders from a Sergeant. There are also Police Officers who serve in an investigative capacity, such as in the Juvenile Aid and Special Victims Units. Police Officers who are assigned to the Detective Bureau are paid the same pay as a Police Officer assigned to patrol.

Unlike most law enforcement agencies, the Philadelphia Police Department Detective Bureau does not maintain the ranks such as Detective Sergeant or Detective Lieutenant, etc. The supervisors (Sergeant, Lieutenant &amp; Captain) in the Detective Bureau can be transferred back to patrol, and are required to maintain a uniform.

Unlike other big city police departments, such as NYPD, Chicago Police Department, and LAPD, Philadelphia Police detectives do not have a uniform that can be worn during details or funerals. The prescribed attire of a Philadelphia Police Detective is proper business attire, and the rank of Detective is a permanent, plainclothes, civil service assignment. In the Philadelphia Police Department, the rank of Detective can only be achieved by a civil service exam and there are no grade differentiations. This is in contrast to NYPD that has the ability to make field promotions to the rank of Detective for an outstanding performance or circumstance.

== Demographics ==
The PPD&#x27;s officers are and have been of many ethnicities. A large number of Irish Americans have been PPD officers since the 1850s.

<text>The Amblève (French, ) or Amel (German, ) is a long river in eastern Belgium in the province of Liège. It is a right tributary of the river Ourthe. It rises near Büllingen in the High Fens or &quot;Hoge Venen&quot; (Dutch), &quot;Hohes Venn&quot; (German), and &quot;Hautes Fagnes&quot; (French), close to the border with Germany.

Tributaries of the Amblève are the rivers Chefna, Ninglinspo, Warche, Eau Rouge, Salm and Lienne. The Amblève flows through the towns of Amel, Stavelot, Trois-Ponts, Remouchamps, and Aywaille. The Amblève joins the river Ourthe in Comblain-au-Pont.

==Sites==

At the village of Coo (near Trois-Ponts) is the Coo Waterfall, which at tall is not the highest but one of the better known waterfalls in Belgium. The waterfall was created artificially in the 18th century when local monks cut through a bend in the river to feed a watermill. The dried out river bed is now used as the lower storage basin for the Coo-Trois-Ponts Hydroelectric Power Station.
A curiosity of Lorcé, a nearby village, is the unusual design of the dam located at a place called &quot;Fang-Naze&quot; or &quot;Fagne-Naze.&quot; Built between 1928 and 1932, it captures about of water, which is then led through a long tunnel cut out of the hill, before falling into the turbines of the power plant &quot;Heid Ile&quot; at Nonceveux part of Aywaille.

On the right bank near Sprimont is the site of the Belle Roche cave, the oldest known place of human occupation of the Benelux (dating back about 500,000 years).

The &quot;Fond de Quareux&quot; stretch of the river near Nonceveux is listed as one of Wallonia&#x27;s Major Heritage sites.

<doc id="1313746" wikidata="Q183268" url="?curid=1313746" title="Guy–Concordia station">
<text>Guy–Concordia station is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Ville-Marie in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Green Line. The station opened on October 14, 1966, as part of the original network of the Metro. It has consistently been one of the network&#x27;s busiest stations, ranking 5th from 2000 to 2001, 4th from 2002 to 2007, 3rd since 2008, and 2nd since 2021.

== Overview ==
Before the station underwent renovations, the walls on the platform were covered in an orange-brown glazed tile pattern that still covers some of the walls in the access areas. These tile were replaced with a more modern style glazed ceramic white tiles, multicolored tile mosaics over the seats, and white stone floors. 

Designed by J.A. Chicoine, it is a normal side platform station, built in tunnel with a transept, ticket hall, and access at each end. The platforms at Guy-Concordia are notably longer than the trains, and so a small section at each end of each platform is closed off by a gate for safety.

The eastern access contains shops and services, and an underground city connection to five Concordia University buildings: EV, MB, GM, LB and H buildings.

There are several shops and services on the mezzanine (where the ticket booth and the turnstiles are located) of the Guy-exit side of the station, including a Tim Hortons, a Chinese restaurant (Monsieur Gao), a &quot;Belle Pizza&quot;, an Asian pastry shop (Cocobun), a hair salon, a cyber cafe, shoe store and another small cafe. The station platforms feature the MétroVision information screens which displays news, commercials, and the amount of time left until the next train arrives. This was the third station after Berri-UQAM and McGill to have the screens installed.

==Historical facts==
Guy–Concordia was the first Metro station in Montreal to be designed by the city&#x27;s architects in the early 1960s. Therefore, during its design phase it was used to determine many of the architectural standards that were used for the other stations of the initial Metro system.

As the building above the Guy entrance was constructed at the same time as the underlying Metro station, Guy-Concordia also became the first station to have several storeys of commercial spaces above it.

Guy–Concordia (or just &quot;Guy&quot; at the time) was part of the initial network that was officially opened on October 14, 1966. It was the second east-bound station on the Green Line (Atwater was the terminal station between the opening in 1966 and opening of the extension of the eastern part of the Green Line until the Angrignon terminal station on September 3, 1978).

==Origin of the name==

The station was originally called Guy after the street where it is located: Guy Street, which, in turn, takes its name from Étienne Guy who represented Montreal in the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada and was the owned of the land through which the street runs.

On January 1, 1988, it was renamed Guy–Concordia to reflect the fact that it serves the Sir George Williams campus of Concordia University.

(Note that in French the name &quot;Guy&quot; is pronounced to rhyme with &quot;bee&quot;, whereas in English the name is usually pronounced to rhyme with &quot;high&quot;. The station is still sometimes referred to simply as &quot;Guy&quot;.)

== Underground connections ==

As of April 7, 2010, all of Concordia University&#x27;s main buildings are connected through a system of underground passages leading to the Guy–Concordia station. A new tunnel was added to the already-existing tunnel that connects the Hall building with the LB building and leads to the station, exiting near the Uniprix store located near the turnstiles.

The new JMSB building, which opened to students in September 2009 features a tunnel stretching under Guy street that connects it with the EV building, opposite the location of the Le Gym. This major tunnel is 396 feet long and lined with ceramic tiles, with display panels for added visual interest.

== Renovations ==

In March 2012, the St-Mathieu exit of the station underwent renovation work that included new flooring, ceilings, walls, lighting, as well as sprinkler and electrical systems. The escalators also underwent an overhaul and motorized doors were added to the station&#x27;s entrance and exit. This work represents the second major renovations performed to the station since its construction in 1966.

When work at the St-Mathieu Street exit was complete in August 2012, similar renovations commenced at the Guy Street entrance. This work included new flooring, ceilings, walls, as well as adding four turnstiles for increased traffic.

<text>Ingram Micro Holding Corporation is an American distributor of information technology products and services. The company is based in Irvine, California, U.S. and has operations around the world. Founded as Micro D, Inc in 1979 in California by Geza Czige and Lorraine Meccathe, the company, originally a traditional distributor focused on marketing, selling and shipping vendor products to resellers, is currently focusing on becoming a platform-based business.

==History==
===Early history===
Ingram Micro&#x27;s origins trace back to the founding of distributor Micro D, Inc. in July 1979 by husband and wife team, Geza Czige and Lorraine Mecca, who were both teachers. The company started in Southern California and in its first year of business achieved approximately $3.5 million in sales.

Meanwhile, in 1982, entrepreneurs Ronald Schreiber, Irwin Schreiber, Gerald Lippes, and Paul Willax were busy founding Software Distribution Services in Buffalo, N.Y. Ingram Distribution Group, a unit of the privately held Ingram Industries, acquired Software Distribution Services in the spring of 1985 and renamed it Ingram Software. The operation was renamed Ingram Computer in February 1988.

After acquiring the remaining publicly traded shares of Micro D in 1989, Ingram Industries merged these two former competitors to create the microcomputer industry&#x27;s first $1 billion computer products wholesale distribution company, renaming it Ingram Micro D. 

In August 1993, Ingram Micro Belgium acquired Zaventem Electronic Dealer Distribution (Zedd) and much of its assets, including the right to distribute Hewlett-Packard products.

In 1996, Ingram Micro became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange, with revenues exceeding $12 billion.

<text>Assomption station is a Montreal Metro station situated in the Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve borough of Montreal, Quebec. Managed by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM), it facilitates commuters along the Green Line and resides within the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve district. The station opened some time after 6 June 1976, as part of the extension of the Green Line to Honoré-Beaugrand.

== Overview ==
Designed by Duplessis and Labelle, Assomption station features a conventional side platform layout constructed primarily from concrete and partially situated within a tunnel. Access to the station is facilitated through a deep open cut that leads to a single entrance. Notably, the station&#x27;s entrance building and the hallways leading to the stairwell have murals painted by Guy Montpetit.

In 2022, the STM&#x27;s Universal Accessibility Report noted that preliminary design work to make the station accessible was underway.

==Origin of the name==
This station, formerly known as L&#x27;Assomption, (a name that can still be observed on the station&#x27;s nameplates), derives its name from Assomption boulevard. The boulevard was named as such in 1951, commemorating Pope Pius XII&#x27;s affirmation of the dogma of the Assumption of Mary in his 1950 apostolic constitution, &quot;Munificentissimus Deus&quot;.

<doc id="1313753" wikidata="Q944742" url="?curid=1313753" title="Palmetto (train)">
<text>The Palmetto is a passenger train operated by Amtrak on a route between New York City and Savannah, Georgia, via the Northeast Corridor, Washington, D.C., Richmond, Virginia, Fayetteville, North Carolina, and Charleston, South Carolina. The &quot;Palmetto&quot; is a shorter version of the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot;, which continues south to Miami, Florida. From 1996 to 2002 this service was called the Silver Palm. Although currently a day train, the &quot;Palmetto&quot; is considered a long-distance train by Amtrak and previously provided overnight sleeper service to Florida.

During fiscal year 2019, the &quot;Palmetto&quot; carried 345,342 passengers, a decrease of 11% from FY2018. The train had a total revenue of $27,208,372 during FY2016, a 61.4% increase over FY2015.

==History==

The &quot;Palmetto&quot; name was first used by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in 1909 for the &quot;Palmetto Limited&quot;, which ran from New York City to Augusta and Savannah, Georgia, with a connection to Atlanta via the Georgia Railroad. The ACL train was discontinued in 1968.

Amtrak introduced the new &quot;Palmetto&quot; on June 15, 1976. The train drew its name from the &quot;Sabal palmetto&quot;, the state tree of South Carolina. The &quot;Palmetto&quot; was the first train in the Southern United States to receive the then-new Amfleet equipment, and the run was the longest at the time for the new coaches. At the time of introduction, Amtrak planned to run the &quot;Palmetto&quot; daily for the summer only, with service ending September 8. However, citing better-than-expected ridership, Amtrak extended the &quot;Palmetto&quot; to a year-round service indefinitely. In October 1976 the Florida Department of Transportation urged Amtrak to extend the &quot;Palmetto&quot; south to Miami.

In October 1984, Amtrak began operating the &quot;Carolinian,&quot; a North Carolina-focused regional train, as a section of the &quot;Palmetto.&quot; The two trains ran combined between New York and Richmond, Virginia. At Richmond the &quot;Carolinian&quot; continued separately to Raleigh and Charlotte, North Carolina. The &quot;Carolinian&quot; was discontinued in September 1985, after the state of North Carolina refused to increase its support for the train, and then revived in 1990.

In December 1988 Amtrak extended the &quot;Palmetto&quot; south to Jacksonville, Florida. The train continued to be coach-only, without full dining service. Beginning on May 12, 1990, the &quot;Palmetto&quot; combined with a revived &quot;Carolinian&quot;, although this time the split occurred in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. The two trains began running independently to New York in April 1991. In October 1994 the &quot;Palmetto&quot; became a full overnight with sleeper and dining car service, running through to Tampa, Florida. This replaced the &quot;Silver Meteor&#x27;s&quot; Tampa section. This extension was short-lived: budget cuts under the Clinton administration led to the &quot;Palmetto&#x27;s&quot; discontinuance on February 1, 1995.

=== Revival ===

Amtrak added a third train from New York to Miami on November 10, 1996, known as the &quot;Silver Palm&quot; in line with the &quot;Silver Service&quot; brand for Amtrak&#x27;s Florida trains. However, it used the same route as the former &quot;Palmetto&quot; and carried the same numbers (89 southbound and 90 northbound). While the &quot;Silver Star&quot; and &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; ran straight from Jacksonville to Miami, at Jacksonville the &quot;Silver Palm&quot; turned west and continued over the old Seaboard Air Line Railroad main line via Waldo, Ocala, Wildwood and Dade City to Tampa. At Tampa, it reversed and ran south to Miami. Amtrak restored the &quot;Palmetto&quot; name on May 1, 2002, after it removed the sleepers and dining car from the train, although it continued serving Florida.

On November 1, 2004, Amtrak truncated the &quot;Palmetto&quot; to Savannah, Georgia, operating a daytime schedule to and from New York (as it had prior to 1994). With the truncation to Savannah, the &quot;Silver Star&quot; was rerouted to serve Tampa; the old Jacksonville-Lakeland route is now served by a Amtrak Thruway bus transfer from the &quot;Silver Star&quot;, which serves all the former stations as well as Gainesville.

In the January 2011 issue of &quot;Trains&quot; magazine, this route was listed as one of five routes to be looked at by Amtrak in FY 2011 as the previous five routes (&quot;Sunset&quot;, &quot;Eagle&quot;, &quot;Zephyr&quot;, &quot;Capitol&quot;, and &quot;Cardinal&quot;) were examined in FY 2010. In October 2015, in an effort to reduce redundant trains, Amtrak temporarily cancelled one daily &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; round trip and allowed the &quot;Palmetto&quot; to take local passengers north of Washington. Stops at , BWI Airport, and were added to the &quot;Palmetto&quot;.

On April 3, 2016, the southbound Palmetto struck a backhoe while travelling through Chester, Pennsylvania, killing two track workers and derailing the locomotive, as well as damaging the first two cars of the train.

== Operation ==
=== Equipment ===
Most &quot;Palmetto&quot; trains consist of six cars hauled by a locomotive.

The passenger cars are from the Amfleet series. Most trains include an Amfleet club car which has a combination of Business Class seating with a Café (food service/lounge) and four Coach Class cars. The train also carries a Viewliner series baggage car for checked baggage service. Unlike most Amtrak long-distance trains, the &quot;Palmetto&quot; does not carry sleeping cars or a dining car, which were removed from the train in 2002.

Between Savannah and Washington, trains are pulled by a GE Genesis or Siemens Charger diesel locomotive at speeds up to . (Amtrak began replacing the older P40DC and P42DC locomotives with the Chargers in 2023). Between New York and Washington, the service operates over the Northeast Corridor which has overhead electric wires and trains are pulled by Siemens ACS-64 electric locomotives at speeds up to .

In the coming years all equipment will be replaced with Amtrak Airo trainsets, the railroad&#x27;s branding of its combination of Siemens Venture passenger cars and a Siemens Charger diesel-electric locomotive. The trainsets for the &quot;Palmetto&quot; will have six passenger cars, which will include a food service area and a mix of 2x2 Coach Class and 2x1 Business Class seating. The car closest to the locomotive will be a specialized &quot;Auxiliary Power Vehicle&quot; which will include a pantograph to collect power from overhead lines and will feed it to four traction motors in the car, and via a DC link cable, to the four traction motors in the locomotive. The arrangement will offer a near seamless transition between power sources at Washington, a process that currently requires a time-consuming locomotive change.

=== Classes of service ===
The cafe car includes complimentary WiFi and electric outlets. All classes of service have an electric outlet (120 V, 60 Hz AC) at each seat, reading lamps, fold-out tray tables. Reservations are required on all trains, tickets may be purchased online, from an agent at some stations, a ticketing machine at most stations, or, at a higher cost, from the conductor on the train.
*Coach Class: 2x2 seating. Passengers self-select seats on a first-come, first-served basis.
*Business Class: 2x1 seating with more legroom than coach. Passengers receive complimentary soft drinks. Seats assigned in advance.

=== Route ===
The &quot;Palmetto&#x27;s&quot; route has not changed significantly since it first ran in 1976. It parallels the Florida-bound &quot;Silver Meteor&quot;, making additional station stops. When introduced in 1976 it included two new stations: and Kingstree, South Carolina. Kingstree sees the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; as well. The &quot;Palmetto&quot; added Selma, North Carolina (Smithfield) in October 1982. In October 2015, it added New Carrollton, BWI Airport, and Metropark.

The &quot;Palmetto&quot; operates over Amtrak and CSX Transportation trackage:
* New York – Washington D.C. (Amtrak)
** Northeast Corridor
* Washington D.C. – Savannah, GA (CSXT)
** RF&amp;P Subdivision
** Richmond Terminal Subdivision
** North End Subdivision
** South End Subdivision
** Charleston Subdivision
** Savannah Subdivision

=== Bus connections ===
Amtrak Thruway bus routes began operating in eastern North Carolina in October 2012 that connect to the northbound and southbound &quot;Palmetto&quot; at the Wilson, North Carolina station. One route serves Greenville, New Bern, Havelock, and Morehead City; the other route serves Goldsboro, Kinston, Jacksonville, and Wilmington.

===Station stops===
Unlike other long-distance trains, the &quot;Palmetto&quot; makes local stops along the Northeast Corridor as well as major city stops. It stops at Metropark and BWI Airport in both directions.

Before 2019, the southbound &quot;Palmetto&quot; followed the practice of most medium- and long-distance trains running in the Northeast, and did not allow passengers to travel only between stations in the Northeast Corridor. It only stopped to receive passengers between Newark and Washington. This policy was intended to keep seats available for passengers making longer trips. Starting in 2019, the southbound &quot;Palmetto&quot; began allowing local travel along the Northeast Corridor. The northbound &quot;Palmetto&quot; has allowed such local travel since 2015.

<text>Cadillac station is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Green Line. It is in the district of Mercier-Ouest. The station opened on June 6, 1976, as part of the extension of the Green Line to Honoré-Beaugrand station.

== Overview ==
Designed by Longpré, Marchand, Goudreau, Dobush, Stewart, et Bourke, it is a normal side platform station built in tunnel. The central mezzanine gives access to the entrances diagonally across from one another at the corner of rue de Cadillac and rue Sherbrooke. The hallways to these entrances feature complementary murals by Jean Cartier.
==Origin of the name==
This station is named for rue de Cadillac, itself named after Antoine Laumet, dit de La Mothe sieur de Cadillac (1658–1730) — a colourful French explorer of New France who founded Detroit, Michigan and commanded it from 1701 to 1710. Despite his name being pronounced as \ka.di.jak\ in French, the station is pronounced as \ka.di.lak\. The STM has corrected this pronunciation issue as of August 2022 .

<doc id="1313761" wikidata="Q1395520" url="?curid=1313761" title="Richard DeVos">
<text>Richard Marvin DeVos Sr. (March 4, 1926 – September 6, 2018) was an American billionaire businessman, co-founder of Amway with Jay Van Andel (company restructured as Alticor in 2000), and owner of the Orlando Magic basketball team. In 2012, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine listed him as the 60th wealthiest person in the United States, and the 205th richest in the world, with an estimated net worth of $5.1 billion.

==Early life==
DeVos was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the son of Ethel Ruth (Dekker) and Simon Cornelius DeVos, Dutch Americans who worked in the electrical business. He was educated at Grand Rapids Christian School, and at Calvin College, and was a member of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity. He served in the military in World War II in the United States Army Air Corps.

== Career ==
=== Amway ===
DeVos and his school friend Jay Van Andel founded Amway in 1959 as a multi-level marketing business to distribute cleaning products, following the business model they had observed in a previous venture together. They ran the business together, expanding it over the decades into an international distributor of a wide variety of products.

===Books===
Books written by him include &quot;Compassionate Capitalism&quot; and &quot;Hope From My Heart: Ten Lessons For Life&quot;. The latter reflects his feelings after successfully undergoing a heart transplant operation in the United Kingdom in 1997 after being turned down for a transplant in the United States because of his age and diabetes. This was preceded by two heart-bypass operations in 1983 and 1992. In 1975, DeVos published a book about his success, co-authored with Charles Paul Conn, titled &quot;Believe!&quot;. In 2014 he published his memoirs, titled &quot;Simply Rich&quot;.

===Sports ownership===

DeVos was the owner of the NBA team Orlando Magic, having bought the team in 1991 for $85 million. He became interested in the team after an unsuccessful effort to acquire a Major League Baseball expansion franchise for Orlando.

DeVos also formerly owned the Orlando Solar Bears, Grand Rapids Griffins, and the Kansas City Blades, three International Hockey League franchises before that league folded; the Solar Bears and Blades were closed as a result of the league folding, while the Griffins moved to the American Hockey League, and are now under the ownership of Dan DeVos, one of Richard&#x27;s sons.

DeVos asked Orange County, Florida, to help pay for the Orlando Magic&#x27;s new arena using county funds and Dema Stobell&#x27;s Corporation money. Amway, for a time, paid for the naming rights to Amway Center (now Kia Center). The use of public money was controversial.

===Boards===
He sat on the board of trustees of Northwood University and had been president of the Council for National Policy. He also served on the board of trustees of the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, which is a museum dedicated to the U.S. Constitution. He sat on the legacy board of Christian Leaders Institute, the nonprofit organization founded by Henry Reyenga Jr. after he was encouraged by DeVos and Ron Parr.

==Political involvement==
DeVos was a major donor to the U.S. Republican Party and to conservative causes, including Focus on the Family, and the American Enterprise Institute. DeVos supported the candidacies of Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich. DeVos has served as a finance chairman for the Republican National Committee. In 1987, President Ronald Reagan appointed DeVos to the President&#x27;s Commission on the HIV Epidemic, and was criticized at the time for characterizing people with AIDS as wanting &quot;special treatment&quot;. He was a dedicated opponent of same-sex marriage.

DeVos was a long-time close friend of Gerald and Betty Ford, and was an honorary pallbearer at Gerald Ford&#x27;s state funeral. He was an honorary trustee of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Foundation.

=== Donations ===
He co-founded the Richard and Helen DeVos Foundation, an American conservative foundation and grant-making body in 1970. It is based in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The DeVoses were known in their philanthropy for contributing to education, health care, arts, and historic causes like Mount Vernon, and conservative think tanks such as The Heritage Foundation and AEI. Education-related philanthropy included the Richard M. and Helen DeVos Center for Entrepreneurship &amp; Innovation at Grand Valley State University, the Richard and Helen DeVos Fieldhouse at Hope College, and the Richard and Helen DeVos Center for Arts and Worship at Grand Rapids Christian Schools. The Richard and Helen DeVos Foundation was in part responsible for funding the creation of the Sport Business Management Program at the University of Central Florida.

==Personal life==
Richard DeVos was the father of Dan (owner of the Grand Rapids Griffins hockey team), Richard Jr. (&quot;Dick&quot;, husband of former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and candidate for governor of Michigan), Cheri, and Doug.

DeVos was a member of the Christian Reformed Church in North America. He spent the last decade of his life trying unsuccessfully to rejoin it with the Reformed Church in America, from which it had split in 1857, dividing his grandparents.

==Death==
He died at his home in Ada, Michigan on September 6, 2018, at the age of 92.

<text>Radisson station is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Green Line. It is in the district of Saint-Jean-de-Dieu. It opened on June 6, 1976, as part of the extension of the Green Line to Honoré-Beaugrand station.

== Overview ==
Designed by Papineau, Gérin-Lajoie, Le Blanc, Edwards, it is a normal side platform station built partly in tunnel, with a very tall, vaulted volume over the eastern part of the platform. This contains the transept and a tall escalator shaft rising unsupported to the ticket hall above. The latter gives access to three entrances. The station serves a metropolitan bus terminus and a park and ride lot.

In 2022, the STM&#x27;s Universal Accessibility Report noted that preliminary design work to make the station accessible was underway.

==Origin of the name==
The station is named for rue Radisson. Pierre-Esprit Radisson (c. 1640–1710) was a French explorer who was instrumental in the development of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company.

==Film and television appearances==
*Scenes of the Bruce Willis-Richard Gere film &quot;The Jackal&quot; were shot in this station, redressed to stand in for the Capitol Heights station on the Washington Metro.

==Terminus Radisson==

The adjoining bus terminus, located on the west side of Sherbrooke Street, is owned and operated by the Réseau de transport métropolitain, with all bus traffic entering and leaving through the rear at Faradon Street. Several regional MRC de L&#x27;Assomption and MRC Les Moulins routes of the CRT Lanaudière use the terminus, as well as Société de transport de Laval and Réseau de transport de Longueuil buses, and local services provided by Société de transport de Montréal. It is the only terminus where STL and RTL bus routes meet.

On December 13, 2021, as part of mitigation measures related to major repairs of the nearby Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine Bridge–Tunnel undertaken by the Quebec government, three new Exo buses as well as one new RTL bus connecting the bus terminus to the south shore were added. The announcement was made by Transport Minister and Minister Responsible for the Montreal Region, Chantal Rouleau, and Justice Minister, Attorney General, and Minister Responsible for the Montérégie region, Simon Jolin-Barrette. New bus quays would be added to the terminus as well. The new buses connect Montreal to Boucherville, Varennes, Sainte-Julie and Beloeil. The Exo buses to the South Shore operate on weekdays and holidays only, with reduced service being offered on holidays.

<text>Keystone Resort is a ski resort located in Keystone, Colorado, United States, 20.92 km of Frisco. Since 1997, the resort has been owned and operated by Vail Resorts. It consists of three mountains (Dercum Mountain, North Peak, and the Outback) and five Bowls (Independence, Erickson, Bergman, and North and South Bowls). The three mountains are connected by a series of ski lifts and gondolas with access from two base areas (River Run and Mountain House).

==History==
In the 1940s, Max Dercum left his job as a forestry professor and ski racing coach at Penn State University to work for the Forest Service as a forester and fire spotter in Colorado. He and his wife Edna first lived in Georgetown before settling on a ranch outside the village of Keystone. Max served as a rodeo clown at the Summer Rodeo. Their passion was skiing. 

They skied at the Climax Mine, Loveland and Berthoud Passes, Loveland Ski Area, and Steamboat. After a race at Loveland Pass, Max filed mining claims for land around an alpine cirque that he hoped to develop into a ski area. Max served as the head coach of the ski school, and Edna quickly followed as the first female instructor at the school.

=== Founding ===
Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Max hiked and scouted the mountain, drew up plans for the ski area, and created a papier-mâché model of the mountain ranges. After discussing the plan for the New Year&#x27;s party (1968–1969), Bill Bergman, a corporate lawyer from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, agreed. At 3 a.m. on New Year&#x27;s Day, Bill and Max founded the Keystone International.

Bill and Max hired lumbermen to hand-cut the ski trails, which Max laid out to follow the natural contours of the mountain. They used the old timber and mining roads and installed the lift towers with helicopters. A wetland easement was also included in the development, so no building would be directly on the Snake River. Keystone was opened on November 21, 1970.

In May 1974, Keystone was acquired by Ralston Purina.

=== 1976 Winter Olympics ===
Independence Mountain was an Olympic finalist and nearly selected for the alpine skiing downhill event for the 1976 Winter Olympic Games, initially awarded to Denver, United States. Lands owned by the Denver Water Board at the base of Independence Mountain were given consideration by the Forest Service as an alternative second base area. Speculation about conflicts in the Snake River Valley with the lynx reintroduction program stifled further study and land allocation. Prior to the formal expansion of the Keystone ski area onto Independence Mountain, this terrain was under permit by multiple guides and outfitters in the 1970s and 1980s using snowcats and helicopters for alpine skiing.

=== North Peak expansion ===
North Peak opened for skiing in 1984. Two trails, Diamond Back and Mozart, allow access to North Peak from Dercum Mountain. North Peak initially featured seven trails, serviced by two Lift Engineering triple chairlifts. Santiago serviced the North Peak pod, while Teller, now known as Ruby Express, provided egress back to Dercum Mountain. As part of the expansion, a second base area was opened at River Run, with a gondola running all the way to the Summit House. Several trails in the Spring Dipper area, and a new triple chairlift, Erickson, was also introduced.

In 1986, the original River Run Gondola was removed and replaced with a new gondola constructed by Von Roll, reusing the original gondola terminals.

===1990s===
In 1990, Keystone entered the detachable industry as Doppelmayr constructed two high speed quads to replace aging lifts on Dercum Mountain. The Peru Express lift replaced a Heron Poma double, providing access from the Mountain House base area to the Packsaddle Bowl and the west side of the mountain. It was supplemented by the Montezuma Express lift, which replaced a Yan triple chairlift and provided access to all trails on the upper and central part of Dercum Mountain.

In 1991, Keystone opened an expansion into the Outback, located beyond North Peak. Doppelmayr constructed three new lifts to service the expansion. A two-way gondola, known as the Outpost Gondola, was built from the summit of Dercum Mountain over to North Peak. A new high speed quad known as the Outback Express was built to service the Outback trails, and a fixed-grip quad known as the Wayback was built to service two access trails leading to the Outback as well as provide egress from the area.

In 1996, Vail Resorts announced plans to acquire Keystone and Breckenridge&#x27;s parent company Ralston Resorts Inc. from Ralston Purina. The merger was approved by the U.S. Department of Justice on January 3, 1997.

In 1997, the Erickson triple chairlift on Dercum Mountain was removed and replaced with a new Doppelmayr high speed quad, named the Summit Express, running parallel to the River Run Gondola for its entire length. That same year, a new triple chairlift known as the Ranger was built to open up a learning area at the summit of Dercum Mountain.

In 1998, the Santiago Express was built to replace the Santiago triple chairlift on North Peak.

===2000s to 2020s===
In 2000, the original Ruby (then Teller) lift was removed and replaced with a high speed six pack. The Ruby Express was constructed by Poma and provided faster egress out of North Peak and the Outback.

In 2008, the River Run Gondola, nearing 22 years of continuous service, was retired and replaced with a new gondola. Doppelmayr constructed the replacement River Run Gondola, which had its base area terminal moved from adjacent to the Summit Express to a new location across the river. The new gondola also features a mid-station, allowing guests to upload or download from midway up Dercum Mountain, as well as a new learning area.

In 2014, the Outback Express was given a capacity upgrade to 2,400 pph, using chairs transferred over from the Peru Express and Montezuma Express lifts.

For the 2017 season, Keystone built their second high speed six pack, bringing in Leitner-Poma to replace the Montezuma Express lift. Parts from the old lift were relocated to Beaver Creek Resort and used to construct the Red Buffalo Express.

In 2021, Keystone completed the upgrade of the Peru Express lift, replacing it with a high speed 6-passenger chair. Part of this project also included removing the Argentine Chair, which was an original lift from the resort.

In 2022, Keystone expanded its lift-serviced terrain into the Bergman Bowl, including a new chairlift, new trails, new snowmaking and a ~6000 sq ft expansion of the Outpost Restaurant.

In 2025, Keystone features 21 lifts with an uphill capacity of 39,100 riders per hour, 140 runs of varying difficulty (12% beginner, 39% intermediate, and 49% advanced), a longest run of 5.63 km, and 1 terrain park.

* Keystone has 13 chairlifts, and 8 surface lifts.

*Keystone has 8 surface lifts: Midway Carpets (2), Kokomo Carpet (2), Double Barrel Carpet (2), Triangle Carpet, Ski School Carpet, and the Tubing Hill Carpet.

=== Teller Lift Accident ===
The Teller Lift was a Yan 1000 model triple chair installed in 1984 as part of the North Peak expansion. On December 14, 1985, the upper bullwheel disconnected from the main gearbox shaft, resulting in dozens of lift riders being thrown from their chairs onto the slope below. Two riders were killed and an additional 47 were injured. Faulty welding was blamed for the accident. The lift was rebuilt by Yan as the Ruby Lift, free of charge. Settlements between Yan and injured skiers topped over seven million dollars.

==Activities==
During the summer, visitors to Keystone resort often participate in hiking, horseback riding, fly-fishing, whitewater rafting, paddle boat and standup paddle board rentals and mountain biking. Additionally, Keystone provides lift access for mountain hiking events and hundreds of miles of single-track mountain biking.

Keystone Resort is also home to two 18-hole championship golf courses, The Ranch and River Run. The Ranch course was designed by Robert Trent Jones Jr. and is situated next to a historic ranching homestead.

In the winter, Keystone offers night skiing, a five-acre resurfaced ice skating lake, sleigh rides, and several fine-dining restaurants.

==USDA Forest Service==
Keystone ski area operates on National Forest System lands under a special use permit from the Forest Service. The 30-year special use permit assigns to the permit holder only a portion of the bundle of rights normally associated with real estate ownership. For the privilege of using federal lands, the ski area pays an annual fee of about one dollar per skier visitor to the U.S. Treasury. Twenty-five percent of those fees are returned to Summit County, Colorado, for roads and schools. The Forest Service approves development plan revisions. The 1984 Land and Resource Management Plan and 2002 Revision, authored by Erik Martin, program manager for ski area administration (1972–2003), WRNF, established the final expanded boundary perimeter for Keystone Resort, including the eventual expansion of developed skiing onto Independence Mountain. The 2002 Forest Plan Revision suggested an aerial transportation corridor and south portal be constructed in the Swan Valley to provide direct access between Keystone ski area and the Town of Breckenridge.

<text>Lionel-Groulx is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Le Sud-Ouest in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and is a transfer station between the Green Line and Orange Line, with cross-platform interchange available. It is located in the Saint-Henri area, along Atwater Avenue on that area&#x27;s eastern border with Little Burgundy. If transfers between lines are included, the station is one of the busiest on the Metro. It first opened in 1978.

== History ==
The station opened on September 3, 1978 as part of the extension of the Green Line to Angrignon, but service was on the Green Line only. Though the Orange Line platforms were built at the same time, they did not enter service until the extension to Place-Saint-Henri was opened on April 28, 1980. The station was the first transfer station after Berri-UQAM opened in the original network.

In 2009, it became the first existing station, after elevators were added, to be retrofitted to be fully wheelchair-accessible. Berri-UQAM station had elevators added at the same time but only between the mezzanine and the Orange Line platforms. (The three stations in Laval, which opened in 2007, already had elevators.) Three elevators connect, respectively, the entrance to the mezzanine, the mezzanine to the upper platform, and the upper platform to the lower platform.

== Architecture and art ==
The station, built in open cut, features stacked platforms with central platforms between the lines; the Orange Line is to the south and the Green Line to the north. The platforms are arranged in an anti-directional cross-platform interchange, with the two inbound lines (Montmorency and Honoré-Beaugrand) on the upper level, and the two outbound lines (Côte-Vertu and Angrignon) on the lower level. This allows the majority of passengers to transfer by simply walking across the platform, without having to go up or down stairs. The station&#x27;s mezzanine, suspended on beams, is located above the upper platform, and gives access to the single entrance. The orange, yellow and red circular tiles on the platform floor recall the multi-colored maple leaves that typically carpet the city’s sidewalks, parks and surrounding woodlands in autumn.

The station was designed by Yves Roy. It contains two artworks: a pair of stainless steel mural sculptures by the architect over the mezzanine, and in the mezzanine itself, a sculpture called &quot;The Tree of Life&quot; by Italian artist Joseph Rifesser. Representing the races of humanity growing from a common root, it was carved from the entire trunk of a walnut tree, it was originally located at Man and His World and was given to the Metro by the United Nations.

The station is equipped with the MétroVision information screens which displays news, commercials, and the time till the next train.

==Station layout==
==Origin of the name==
This station is named for rue Lionel-Groulx, which had its name changed to allow the station to commemorate Lionel Groulx. Groulx, one of the most influential of Quebec historians, founded the Franco-American History Institute in 1946 and edited the &quot;Revue d&#x27;histoire de l&#x27;Amérique française&quot; from 1947 to 1967.

In November 1996, the League for Human Rights of B&#x27;nai Brith Canada officially requested that the Executive Committee of the Montreal Urban Community (M.U.C.) recommend a name change to the station, due to anti-Semitic statements and positions made and maintained by Lionel Groulx.

Likewise, there has been a recent movement to rename the station in honour of Oscar Peterson. The movement was originally started as a virtual petition, but has recently been picked up by the media. The issue was politicized and fraught in controversy as global monuments and statues celebrating controversial historical icons were called in to question.

==Connecting bus routes==
The 77 MUHC shuttle is abolished on August 23, 2021, as Vendôme station became accessible and provides accessible path to the MUHC Glen Site.

<text>Leonard Norman Stern (born March 28, 1938) is an American billionaire businessman, and philanthropist.

He is the chairman and CEO of the privately owned Hartz Group based in New York City. The company&#x27;s real estate portfolio was owned and operated under its Hartz Mountain Industries subsidiary company, of which he is also chairman and CEO.

==Early life and education==
Stern was born to a Jewish family, the son of Hilda (née Lowenthal) and Max Stern. Max Stern was the German-born vice-chairman of the board of trustees of Yeshiva University for whom its Stern College for Women was named. He had emigrated from Weimar Germany to the U.S. in the 1920s after his textile business proved unprofitable, bringing along 2,100 canaries from Germany to sell on the U.S. market. By selling caged birds, bird cages and other pet bird supplies to U.S. pet owners through Woolworth&#x27;s stores over the next thirty years, Stern&#x27;s father built up the family business: Hartz Mountain Corporation (HMC), also headquartered in Secaucus, NJ. HMC later grew to become the flagship subsidiary of The Hartz Group. The business was named after the Harz Mountains of Germany. Though Canaries originally come from the Canary Islands the Canaries in trade are the result of selective breeding by farms located at Harz.

In 1957, Stern graduated from New York University (NYU).

==Career==
Stern initially inherited his wealth from his father. He gradually purchased his brother&#x27;s and sister&#x27;s share of the family business, Hartz Mountain, and by the early 1960s, exercised absolute control of Hartz Mountain Corporation (HMC). Hartz Mountain Corporation then began to capture the pet supply market that catered to both dog and cat owners and parakeet and canary owners. By 1984, Hartz Mountain Corporation (HMC) controlled 75% to 90% of the U.S. market for most U.S. pet supply goods . Its pet supply business was estimated to be worth $400 million and was earning $40 million in annual profits. In the mid-1980s Leonard Stern bought the alternative New York City weekly alternative newspaper The Village Voice. Additional alternative weeklies were also purchased, forming Stern Publishing, which was sold in 2000 to a venture capital group.

==Legal and image problems==
According to the unsigned cover article, &quot;Dynasty In Distress&quot; in the February 9, 2004 issue of &quot;Business Week&quot;, Stern was &quot;intensely engaged&quot; as a board member of Rite Aid in the mid-to-late &#x27;90s when the drugstore chain admitted to overstating net income by $1 billion over two years.

Stern was named in several class action suits in which investors claimed that he and other directors had breached their fiduciary duty to shareholders. A separate lawsuit, filed by Kevin Mann, the son of the original founder and former executive vice-president, alleged that Stern used his influence to increase shelf space in Rite Aid stores for Hartz&#x27;s pet products at the expense of competitors. Rite Aid settled that suit in 1999 for $11 million.

Stern resigned from the board in late 2001. According to the article, he &quot;brushes all of this aside: &#x27;We saved that company from bankruptcy. We threw out the old management and brought in the new and set it on its turnaround&#x27; &quot;.

==Philanthropy==
He was the founder in 1986 and is chairman of Homes for the Homeless. According to its website, it serves over 630 homeless families and over 1,200 homeless children each day at five separate sites across New York City.

Stern collected Cycladic antiquities in the 1980s–now under custodianship of the Hellenic Ancient Culture Institute, lending objects to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and to the Museum of Cycladic Art in Athens.

==Personal life==
Stern has been married twice: 
*Judith Stern Peck, is a family therapist and family business consultant in New York. They divorced in 1980 and she later remarried to Stephen M. Peck. They had three children:
**Emanuel T. Stern (&quot;Manny&quot;) (b. 1964) - runs the family&#x27;s real estate business and known for losing a $1.3 billion deal to redevelop a sports and entertainment complex at New Jersey&#x27;s Meadowlands Sports Complex. In 1992, he married Elizabeth Egan in a service held at the Central Park Zoo. 
**Edward J. Stern (b. 1966) - who ran the Canary Capital Partners LLC hedge fund and was the first fund manager to be charged by New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer for &quot;fraudulent&quot; late trading and market timing of mutual funds. In 1991, he married Stephanie Beth Rein in a Jewish service at the New York Botanical Garden.
**Andrea C. Stern (b. 1968) - is a photographer.
*Allison Maher, a former model and TV producer who grew up &quot;dirt-poor&quot; in Kentucky. They married in 1987. Allison is a trustee and vice-chairman of the Wildlife Conservation Society, the parent of the Bronx Zoo.

&quot;Forbes&quot; listed him with a net worth of $4.8 billion in 2018, making him the 143rd richest person in the USA, and with a net worth at $8.1 billion in 2024, making him as the 325th richest person in the world.

New York University&#x27;s business school is named after him.

<doc id="1313780" wikidata="Q179391" url="?curid=1313780" title="Snowdon station">
<text>Snowdon station is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and is a transfer station between the Orange Line and Blue Line; it is the western terminus of the Blue Line. It is located in the Snowdon neighbourhood. The town of Hampstead is located nearby to the west, across Macdonald Avenue; one emergency exit from the station extends into Hampstead.

The station opened on September 7, 1981 with service on the Orange Line only, though the Blue Line platforms were built at the same time. At the time it was the western terminus of the Orange Line, taking over from Place-Saint-Henri station; it is thus the only station to have been the terminus of two different lines. Service on the Blue Line began on January 4, 1988.

==Overview==

The station was constructed as an anti-directional cross-platform interchange, with three lateral tunnels containing two storeys each, joined by four cross-tunnels; both lines therefore have stacked platforms. This layout was intended to allow rapid transfer between a future extension into Notre-Dame-de-Grâce and service to downtown; this service never opened, and the station&#x27;s layout means that most people who transfer between the Blue and Orange Lines must go down stairs.

The station&#x27;s central access tunnel is connected at its western end to the station&#x27;s single entrance, which is integrated into an STM control centre and contains a small sunken garden.

=== Accessibility ===
In October 2013, work began to make the station accessible. Construction involved building two elevators to connect both platform levels of the station, with a third elevator constructed to connect the upper platform level with the surface entrance. The only vestibule of the station underwent reconstruction. After completion, the surface elevator features its longest shaft in Montreal Metro, with the pit depth of about 25 meters. Works was completed by June 2016. However, the Blue Line itself was not accessible until Jean-Talon station (which also interchanges with the Orange Line) gained elevators in 2019.

==Architecture and art==
The station was designed by Jean-Louis Beaulieu, who also provided sculptural grilles for the station&#x27;s main staircase and the rear of the control building. The station&#x27;s main artwork, a group of four murals by Claude Guité running the full length of the platform and entitled &quot;Les quatre saisons&quot; (the four seasons). The murals are painted on 500 panels of asbestos cement stretching the entire length of the platforms, they portray semi-abstract scenes of the foliage and weather associated with each of the four seasons. The seasons go in order, counterclockwise around the platforms, with winter on the Côte-Vertu platform, spring on Montmorency, summer on the Saint-Michel departure platform, and autumn on the Snowdon arrival platform.

Soon after the station opened the murals were victims of graffiti that badly damaged the artwork. Attempts of removing the graffiti destroyed large sections of the paintings. In 2004 the murals were all removed for a restoration plan by the STM to have the artist repaint the murals and slowly have them reinstalled in the station. As of June 2010 all the murals have been repainted, and are partially reinstalled on all four platforms of the station with a protective sheet of glass to prevent any future vandalism.

==Origin of the name==
This station is named for the neighborhood in which it is located, named in turn for the owner of a farm on which it was built. The underground station platforms, located under Avenue Dornal, are approximately four blocks—about 250 m (270 yards)—east of the site of Snowdon Junction, a major transfer point during the streetcar era.

<text>More Noise and Other Disturbances is the second studio album by the American band the Mighty Mighty Bosstones. It was released in 1992 by Taang! Records. It was a hit on college radio. &quot;Where&#x27;d You Go&quot; was released as a single.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that the horns &quot;are the most stylistically consistent thing on the album, which hops across a variety of bouncy or slamming genres, from the hardcore of &#x27;Guns and the Young&#x27; to the hip-hop of &#x27;Bad in Plaid&#x27;.&quot; The &quot;Deseret News&quot; deemed &quot;More Noise and Other Disturbances&quot; &quot;a bristling mix of punk rock, rock, funk and ska.&quot;

&quot;Tiny Mix Tapes&quot; called the album, along with &quot;Question the Answers&quot;, &quot;the band’s best work,&quot; and wrote that they both &quot;[hold] up surprisingly well.&quot;

<text>Jean-Talon () is a station of the Montreal Metro rapid transit system, operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM). It is located in the Little Italy district on the border between the boroughs of Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie and Villeray–Saint-Michel–Parc-Extension in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

It is a transfer station between the Orange Line and Blue Line. The Orange Line station opened on October 14, 1966, as part of the original network of the Metro.

== Overview ==
The original station was designed by Duplessis, Labelle et Derome. It is a normal side platform station built in a tunnel, with a mezzanine on its southern end giving access to several exits, including underground city access to the Tour Jean-Talon.

With the construction of the Blue Line in 1986, the station was greatly expanded. Two large volumes were dug, one on either side of the original station, giving access to the stacked Blue Line platforms below. This portion of the station was designed by Gilbert Sauvé, and included artistic tiling designs by the architect as well as a large mural by Judith Bricault. Another access was built leading to the Plaza Saint-Hubert, connecting to the eastern volume by an automated entrance. The Blue Line platforms were inaugurated on June 16, 1986.

Jean-Talon is the only one of Montreal&#x27;s four transfer stations that was not built that way from the beginning. 

In 2013, work began to make the station accessible at a cost of $9 million, with the installation of elevators. In June 2015, work was completed to make the Orange Line platforms accessible. In November 2019, it was announced that works to make the Blue Line platform accessible via elevator had been completed, making the Blue Line accessible for the first time. 

The station has 4 entrances:
: 7100 Berri Street
: 430 Jean-Talon Street E.
: 522 Jean-Talon Street E.
: 780 Jean-Talon Street E. (automated entrance)


==Origin of the name==
This station is named for Jean-Talon Street. Jean Talon (1626–1694) served as intendant of New France from 1665 to 1668 and 1670 to 1672.

<text>The Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Atlantic City, formerly Trump Taj Mahal, is a casino and hotel on the Boardwalk, owned by Hard Rock International, in Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States.

Hard Rock Live (Atlantic City) is a performance venue at the casino.

The casino was inaugurated in 1990 by its owner, Donald Trump, and was built at a total cost of nearly US$1 billion. Original restaurants at the Taj Mahal included Hard Rock Cafe, Sultan&#x27;s Feast, Dynasty, Il Mulino New York, Moon at Dynasty, and Robert&#x27;s Steakhouse. It was also the home of Scores, the country&#x27;s first in-casino strip club.

The Taj Mahal came to the brink of closure in 2014 as its parent company went through bankruptcy, but ultimately remained open under the new ownership of Icahn Enterprises. In 2015, the Taj Mahal admitted to having &quot;willfully violated&quot; anti-money-laundering regulations for years and was fined $10 million. It was the highest penalty ever levied by the U.S. federal government against a casino. On August 3, 2016, it was announced that the Trump Taj Mahal would close after Labor Day because it was losing millions of dollars each month. It was closed on October 10, 2016.

On March 1, 2017, the Seminole Tribe of Florida through its Hard Rock International brand, and the Morris and Jingoli families, announced its purchase of the facility and conversion to the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino brand. It reopened on June 27, 2018, a day earlier than planned.

==History==
===Trump Taj Mahal era: 1990–2016===

Construction of what was originally known as the Taj Mahal commenced in 1983 by Resorts International, owner of the neighboring Resorts Casino Hotel, with an estimated budget of $250 million. Resorts head James Crosby said it might be named the United States Hotel, in reference to the city&#x27;s first major hotel.

After Crosby&#x27;s death in April 1986, Resorts International became a takeover target. The Taj Mahal had encountered construction problems, and Crosby&#x27;s heirs, lacking experience in large development projects, doubted their ability to complete it successfully. Donald Trump, who owned two other Atlantic City casinos, beat out several other bidders to purchase a controlling stake in the company for $79 million in July 1987. Trump was appointed chairman of Resorts International, and said he would complete the Taj Mahal in about a year.

Because New Jersey law prohibited anyone from owning more than three casinos, Trump planned to close the original Resorts casino and operate it as a hotel annex to the Taj Mahal.

As the total budget had ballooned to $930 million, Resorts sought to raise $550 million to complete the Taj Mahal, but struggled to find the financing. With the company claiming to be near bankruptcy in early 1988, Trump made a tender offer to buy all outstanding stock for $22 a share, stating that he was willing to personally finance the construction but only if he owned the entire company. Television producer Merv Griffin made an unexpected offer to purchase the company for $35 a share, sparking a highly publicized takeover battle, with Trump and Griffin filing lawsuits against each other. The two ultimately reached a settlement, which was executed in November 1988, with Griffin purchasing the company, and Trump purchasing the Taj Mahal from the company for $273 million.

Trump raised $675 million to finance the purchase and completion of the casino, primarily through junk bonds with a 14 percent interest rate.

The casino opened on April 2, 1990. With of gaming space, it claimed to be the largest casino in the world (though this was disputed by the Riviera), and billed itself as the &quot;eighth wonder of the world&quot;. An elaborate grand opening ceremony was held three days later.

In 1991, the Taj Mahal went through a prepackaged bankruptcy, resulting in Trump giving a 50 percent stake in the business to its bondholders in exchange for lowered interest rates and a longer payoff schedule.

In 1996, Trump&#x27;s new publicly traded company Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts purchased Taj Mahal in a transaction that valued the property at $890 million. In the 1990s, Trump&#x27;s Taj Mahal casino was &quot;the world&#x27;s largest, most flamboyant casino&quot; and Trump took on an &quot;enormous amount of debt&quot; to launch it. During eighteen months after its April 2, 1990 opening, when the Casino was on the verge of bankruptcy, it became the &quot;preferred gambling spot for Russian mobsters living in Brooklyn, according to federal investigators who tracked organized crime in New York City&quot;.

In 2001, the building hosted the UFC 31 and UFC 32 events, which were the first UFC cards held during the leadership of Dana White.

The Taj Mahal was the highest grossing casino in the city until the opening of The Borgata in 2003. In 2008, The Chairman Tower opened, bringing the complex to over 2,000 rooms.

In 2013, the Taj Mahal opened the nation&#x27;s first casino strip club, featuring scantily clad dancers.

====Bankruptcy filing====
Trump Entertainment Resorts filed for bankruptcy on September 10, 2014,
and announced plans to close the Taj Mahal on November 13 if the casino did not get concessions from its unions. A sister property, the Trump Plaza, did close in 2014.

Workers from the casino marched to Mayor Don Guardian&#x27;s office on the morning of November 3, 2014 to ask him to reconsider granting concessions, which the casino said were necessary to remain open. About 1,000 employees signed a petition calling on the mayor and other officials &quot;to do everything possible&quot; to keep the casino open. At the time, four of twelve casinos in Atlantic City had closed and Trump Taj Mahal would have been the fifth if it were to close.

In filing a revised reorganization plan in a Delaware bankruptcy court, Trump Entertainment Resorts said its board had approved a shutdown of the casino by December 12, 2014. The shutdown date was later pushed back to December 20. On December 18, two days before the scheduled closure, UNITE HERE reached a deal with Trump Entertainment Resorts that saved the Taj from closing. The same day, billionaire Carl Icahn committed $20 million in financing for the Taj.

In February 2016, Trump Entertainment Resorts exited bankruptcy and became a subsidiary of Icahn Enterprises. The casino retained the name &quot;Trump Taj Mahal&quot;, though Donald Trump no longer held any ownership stake. In April, another Icahn affiliate, Tropicana Entertainment, took over the property under a management agreement. Icahn also stated he would withhold a planned $100-million investment into the property if New Jersey approved casinos in the northern region of the state.

On Monday, October 10, 2016, the Trump Taj Mahal Hotel and Casino was shut down. After the closing on that date, one UNITE HERE leader raised the possibility that the casino would remain closed over the winter but will reopen in Spring 2017 as a non-union facility, an attempt that he said would try to prompt a union boycott. On March 1, 2017, Hard Rock International announced plans to spend $300 million to purchase the resort and renovate it. It re-opened as the Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Atlantic City on June 27, 2018.

====Labor disputes====
On November 14, 2014, Trump Entertainment Resorts announced that the casino would shut down in December unless its main union, UNITE HERE, dropped its appeal of a court-ordered cost-savings package, which had effectively cancelled the workers&#x27; health insurance and pension coverage. However, it was revealed that the closing was to happen because it had not received the state and local tax breaks it sought.

On October 10, 2016, Trump Taj Mahal Hotel and Casino was shut down amidst chaos of casino workers on strike, though Hard Rock Cafe remained open.

On June 15, 2022, UNITE HERE union members voted overwhelming in favor of a strike if their agreement is not made by July 3. UNITE HERE Local 54, which represents workers at the casino as well as other casinos in Atlantic City demanded a raise in wages to help cover financial setbacks from the pandemic and increases in living costs.

===Hard Rock: 2018–present===
On March 1, 2017, Hard Rock International announced its purchase of the Trump Taj Mahal property, and officially reopened as the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino Atlantic City, on June 27, 2018.

In November 2018, the Hard Rock announced a plan to launch both online and retail sportsbooks in 2019.

In January 2019, the Hard Rock launched its online sportsbook, making it the 10th sportsbook app in New Jersey.

In January 2020, Scores Nightclub officially closed down. One month later, in February 2020, Robert&#x27;s Steakhouse closed.

==Money laundering==
Over its years of operation from 1990 to 2016, Trump Taj Mahal was, according to National Public Radio business correspondent, Jim Zarroli, &quot;repeatedly cited for having inadequate money-laundering controls, not an unusual charge in the gaming business&quot;.

In February 2015, the U.S. Department of the Treasury&#x27;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network settled an investigation of Trump Taj Mahal with the assessment of a $10 million civil fine for &quot;significant and long-standing money laundering violations&quot; which were described as &quot;willful and repeated&quot; contraventions of the record-keeping and reporting requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act. It was the highest penalty ever levied by the U.S. Federal Government against a casino.

The casino agreed to periodic external audits to comply with anti-money laundering statutes, and admitted to multiple violations as part of its settlement. The U.S. Treasury made note of casino violations dating back to 1998, when Trump Taj Mahal paid a $477,700 fine for violating currency transaction requirements, as well as violations in 2003, 2010, and in 2012, for which the company was &quot;repeatedly warned&quot;. Trump Taj Mahal was &quot;far from meeting&quot; standards required to protect the U.S. financial system &quot;from exploitation from criminals, terrorists, and other bad actors&quot;, the Treasury said in a press release.

In 2017, CNN obtained access to U.S. Treasury Department documents under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) which included the 1998 and the 2015 settlement.

==Controversies==
===Alleged organized crime links===
A 218-page U.S. Senate Subcommittee report, &quot;Asian Organized Crime: the New International Criminal&quot;, released in 1992 linked Trump&#x27;s businesses to Asian organized crime.

The Senate subcommittee named Danny Sau Keung Leung, who had been Trump Taj Mahal&#x27;s vice president of foreign marketing since 2000, as an associate of the Hong Kong-based organized crime group 14K Triad linked to &quot;murders, extortions and heroin smuggling&quot;. Leung worked at Trump Taj Mahal from 1990 to 1995. He was &quot;known by law enforcement to be linked to organized crime syndicates&quot; and was investigated by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission in 1995 with hearings in Atlantic City regarding his &quot;background and character&quot;. &quot;Mentions of Trump businesses&quot; were &quot;sprinkled throughout the 1992 Senate report on &quot;Asian organized crime in the United States&quot;. &quot;Crime bosses who ran the Chinatown bus system put together trips to Trump businesses in Atlantic City. [O]ther people with links to organized crime booked shows at Trump venues and in 1987, one was indicted on a charge of providing kickbacks to executives at Trump Castle.&quot; According to an Internal Revenue Service report cited in a 2016 &quot;Politifact&quot; article by Linda Qui, Trump also worked closely with other members and associates of organized criminal enterprises, including Danny Leung, Felix Sater, Salvatore Testa, and Kenneth Shapiro&quot;. In 1984, Canadian police had identified Leung as &quot;a major player in Toronto organized crime&quot;, yet in 1989, the New Jersey Casino Control Commission granted him the casino &quot;key license reserved for executives&quot; and he began working for Trump Taj Mahal in 1990. At the New Jersey Casino Control Commission hearing in 1994, Trump sent Taj President Dennis Gomes to &quot;testify on Leung&#x27;s behalf at the hearing New Jersey Casino Control Commission. In spite of an objection of the Division of Gaming Enforcement and the testimony of Canadian police, his casino key license was renewed. &quot;Leung&#x27;s lawyer, Guy Michael said, that the criminal allegations were &quot;absolutely untrue. In August 2013, Leung requested to be placed on the Casino Key Employee Inactive List in August 2013 &quot;in lieu of complying with the resubmission process&quot;.

===Shooting incidents===
On May 27, 2009, Ray Kot, a casino supervisor for the former Taj Mahal, was shot and killed while working, by Mark Magee of Norristown, Pennsylvania. Magee claimed that he killed Kot because all &quot;casinos cheat gamblers&quot;. On August 11, 2010, Magee was sentenced to 30 years without parole, &quot;The Ray Kot Memorial Park&quot; was dedicated on October 16, 2009.

On September 18, 2011, a man was shot dead and a woman was wounded during an apparent carjacking inside the parking garage of the casino. The man, 28-year-old Sunil Rattu, and the woman, 24-year-old Radha Ghetia, were held up as they left the casino, and then forced to drive to a nearby alley where Rattu was shot dead, while Ghetia was shot in the upper part of her body. Ghetia was treated for her injuries and later recovered. Just days later, three Camden men were taken into custody; two of whom admitted to the crime and took plea bargains with the county attorneys office, one sentence of 40 and the other one for 47 years.

On March 24, 2016, three teenagers attending a party in a hotel room on the forty-seventh floor were shot. Seven suspects were arrested in connection with the incident, which was later described as &quot;gang related&quot;.

<text>Côte-des-Neiges station () is a Montreal Metro station in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Blue Line. It is located in the Côte-des-Neiges area of the borough of Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce. It opened in 1988.

== Overview == 
It is a normal side platform station built in tunnel. A ticket hall, also in tunnel, diverges to two entrances, one on each side of Ch. de la Côte-des-Neiges. The western entrance is housed in an imposing building containing a stained glass window by Claude Bettinger, while the eastern one is integrated into another building and includes a suite of sculptures by Bernard Chaudron. A second stained-glass mural by Bettinger is found in the transept leading to the platforms.

In 2022, the STM&#x27;s Universal Accessibility Report noted that design work to make the station accessible was underway.

==Origin of name==
Côte-des-Neiges station takes its name from the road on which it lies: Côte-des-Neiges Road.

Côte-des-Neiges Road takes its name from the settlement originally on this location, the Village of Côte-des-Neiges, which was created in 1862, and annexed by Montreal in two parts in 1908 and 1910.

The name for the area, Côte de Notre-Dame des Neiges (Our Lady of the Snows Hill), dates from the early 18th century. The name lives on in the church and the school in the centre of the former village.

The station was designed by Patrice Gauthier. The design of the station was constrained by a ventilation shaft for the Mont Royal Tunnel, as well as an underground aqueduct. It is a normal side platform station. 

The station was designed to be able to provide a connection with the then-Agence métropolitaine de transport&#x27;s Montreal—Deux Montagnes commuter rail line, which during the planning of the original network was to have been converted into Line 3 of the Metro. This proposal did not occur, instead, the Réseau express métropolitain (REM) now takes the place of the first two proposals. There is an underground tunnel between the metro station and the CEPSUM complex.

=== Artwork ===
The Blue line station does not have artwork, however colourful benches and flooring were designed by architect Patrice Gauthier. The REM station will have artwork installed in the mezzanine corridor, consisting of eight mosaic panels by artist Manuel Mathieu.

== History ==
The station was opened in January 1988 as part of the extension of the Blue Line to Snowdon.

In 2020, work began to install elevators to serve the Blue line platforms, allowing an accessible interchange between the REM and the Metro. This was originally planned for completion in late 2022.

=== Réseau express métropolitain station ===
In November 2016, CDPQ Infra announced that the proposed Réseau express métropolitain (REM) system would connect to the Blue line at Édouard-Montpetit. As with the 1980s Line 3 proposal, the REM will use the historic Mont Royal tunnel to head north from downtown.

The new station will be located around 20 storeys or below ground, making it the deepest station in Canada and the second deepest in North America after Portland&#x27;s Washington Park station. For comparison, the Blue line is around below ground at this location. Two banks of high-speed elevators will connect the REM platforms to the Blue Line station and the surface.

Construction on the Édouard-Montpetit REM station began in July 2018. Blasting to expand the Mont Royal tunnel to accommodate new platforms, passageways and utility rooms began in October 2018, and lasted around a year. , the REM station was planned to open at the end of 2024 but that was later pushed to October 2025.

== Origin of name ==
During planning, the station was to be named Vincent-d&#x27;Indy, but the name was ultimately changed to Édouard-Montpetit, from the street under which it lies: Édouard-Montpetit Boulevard. The boulevard in turn takes its name from Édouard Montpetit (1881–1954), a Quebec lawyer, economist and academic closely linked with the nearby Université de Montréal.

<text>Outremont station () is a Montreal Metro station in the Outremont borough of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Blue Line. It opened in January 1988.

== Overview == 
The Outremont station was designed by the architectural firm Dupuis, Chapuis, &amp; Dubuc, with Pierre Chapuis as one of the lead architects. It is a normal side platform station with a mined trainroom and open-cut volume at one end, containing the ticket hall and topped by the one large entrance and a glazed skylight. Classic materials and a mural of glazed ceramics by Gilbert Poissant evoke the architecture of the surrounding neighbourhood, as does a Borough of Outremont lamp post at the foot of the stairs to one platform. 

=== Station upgrade ===
In 2021, work began to make the station universally accessible, provide a new ventilation shaft, as well as other refurbishments including flooring, waterproofing and new lighting.

Due to the single entrance building at the station, upgrade works could not safely take place while the station was open. The station was therefore temporarily closed between January and August 2022, with a shuttle bus provided to take passengers to Acadie station. Works (such as the installation of elevators) has been done since December 18, 2024. As part of the upgrade works, The Saint-Michel and Snowdon elevators and an artwork has been commissioned for the station.

==Origin of name==
The station takes its name from the borough (formerly city) of Outremont, in which it is located. Originally named Côte-Sainte-Catherine, the town took its name in 1875 from a mansion, still extant, built in 1833 by Louis-Tancrède Bouthillier and named &quot;Outre-Mont&quot; (&quot;beyond the mountain&quot; from the main settlement of Montreal).

<text>Pungnaptoseong () is a flat earthen wall built at the edge of the Han River in modern-day Pungnap-dong, Songpa-gu, Seoul, South Korea. It has a circumference of 3.5 km. It used to be included in the neighboring city of Gwangju. It has a long oval shape, spreading to north and south, and leaning slightly toward the east. Based on research conducted during the Japanese occupation, it has been speculated that Pungnap Toseong was Hanam Wiryeseong, the first capital of Baekje.

Only 2.7 km of its walls remain. Including the west wall, which had been destroyed by flooding, its circumference reaches about 3.5 km and its area nearly 859,508 m2. After constructing this central part, the inner wall, mainly composed of sandy soil, grit, clayish soil and muddy soil, was set up by heaping earth at a slant. On the top of the last earthen layer of the inner wall, pebbles were laid in three layers and trimmed stones were piled up inside 1.5 m high with mud prepared from natural soil, and by piling up the central part in trapezoid shape whose lower part is 7m wide and 5m high.

<text>Michael Edward Mills (born December 17, 1958) is an American multi-instrumentalist, singer, and composer who was a founding member of the alternative rock band R.E.M. Though known primarily as the bass guitarist and backing vocalist of R.E.M., his musical repertoire also includes keyboards, guitar and occasional lead vocals. He contributed to a majority of the band&#x27;s musical compositions and is the only member to have had formal musical training.

== Early life ==
Michael Edward Mills was born to Frank and Adora Mills in Orange County, California, where his father was stationed in the Marines. While his father was away, six-month-old Mills, with his mother and grandmother, moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where he lived for around ten years. The family moved to Macon, Georgia, in 1971. It was there that Mills met future R.E.M. bandmate Bill Berry when they attended high school. The duo started out in bands together. Early projects included the band Shadowfax, later called The Back Door Band. Berry kept his drum kit in the basement of Mills&#x27;s parents&#x27; house, and Mills dabbled with it. &quot;We had a turntable next to it, so we would put it on,&quot; explained Mills. &quot;I only had three records at that point. I had &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; by Queen, &quot;Tres Hombres&quot; by ZZ Top, and I don&#x27;t remember the third one.&quot; At high school, he began playing bass because he enjoyed experiencing the wooden bleachers vibrate from the sound of the bass in the school&#x27;s jazz band. He borrowed two bass guitars from his mother&#x27;s chiropractor, one being a Fender and the other a Gibson EB-2. After giving those back, he used the school&#x27;s jazz bass for a long time. He played in the school&#x27;s jazz band, which meant (per the school&#x27;s rules) that he also had to play in the school&#x27;s classical band and their marching band.

Records Mills regularly listened to during high school include &quot;Suitable for Framing&quot; by Three Dog Night (his favorite band for a long time), &quot;Summer Breeze&quot; by Seals and Crofts and &quot;You Don&#x27;t Mess Around with Jim&quot; by Jim Croce. Via his transistor radio, he listened to WNEX-FM, the only top-40 station available in Macon. &quot;Loved it. I &quot;listened&quot; to everything because they would &quot;play&quot; everything. You&#x27;d get Motown, you&#x27;d get the Beach Boys, you&#x27;d get British Invasion.&quot; Being in the American South, he was also exposed to white gospel music on Sunday-morning television&#x27;s &quot;Southern&quot; &quot;Gospel Jubilee&quot;. &quot;You&#x27;d get the white gospel, and you could find some black gospel. Country music was everywhere. My parents were into classical music, and my dad was into jazz. So I was just surrounded by everything.&quot; Mills&#x27;s mother played acoustic guitar.

Mills and Berry sold most of their musical equipment and moved to Athens, Georgia, together. Upon arriving, they bought their equipment back, having been turned onto punk music by Ian Copeland, who Berry worked with at Paragon Booking Agency in Macon. Mills attended the University of Georgia, where R.E.M. was formed.

== Career ==
Mills is credited with being the chief composer behind many of R.E.M.&#x27;s songs, including &quot;Nightswimming&quot;, &quot;Find the River&quot;, &quot;At My Most Beautiful&quot;, &quot;Why Not Smile&quot;, &quot;Let Me In&quot;, &quot;Wendell Gee&quot;, &quot;(Don&#x27;t Go Back To) Rockville&quot;, &quot;Beat a Drum&quot;, &quot;Be Mine&quot;, &quot;Electrolite&quot;, and &quot;What&#x27;s the Frequency, Kenneth?&quot; In particular, R.E.M.&#x27;s 2004 album &quot;Around the Sun&quot; was heavily shaped by Mills&#x27; piano and keyboard contributions.

Mills is responsible for the prominent backing vocal and harmony parts found in the band&#x27;s back catalog, with his vocal contributions being most noticeable on 1986&#x27;s &quot;Lifes Rich Pageant&quot; and 2008&#x27;s &quot;Accelerate&quot;. He sang lead vocals on the songs &quot;Texarkana&quot;, &quot;Near Wild Heaven&quot;, The Clique cover &quot;Superman&quot; and The Troggs cover &quot;Love Is All Around&quot;.

Mills has written and performed with friends on various projects during his time with the band and since. In 1990 he wrote music for Howard Libov&#x27;s short film &quot;Men Will Be Boys&quot;. That same year, he recorded with Warren Zevon together with Buck and Berry as the Hindu Love Gods.

In 2012, Mills contributed piano to a Record Store Day single released by Drive-By Truckers member Patterson Hood, in protest of a Walmart development being built in Athens, Georgia.

Mills is a member, along with Steve Wynn, Scott McCaughey, Peter Buck, and Linda Pitmon, of The Baseball Project.

Mills performs as part of singer-songwriter Joseph Arthur&#x27;s band. On April 3, 2014, while performing with Arthur, Mills broke the news that David Letterman would be retiring in 2015. Nine years later, Mills said: &quot;I spoke to Dave about it later and he said, &#x27;No, it was fine. If somebody was going to do it, I&#x27;d rather it be you.&#x27; And I said, &#x27;Well, thank you.&#x27; It was quite a moment to hear him say that sitting there in the dressing room.&quot; Mills took a band self-portrait that he posted to Instagram and did a short interview about &quot;breaking&quot; the story.

Since 2010, Mills has played with a rotating group of musicians for a series of concerts built around Big Star&#x27;s album &quot;Third/Sister Lovers&quot;. Known as Big Star&#x27;s Third, the concerts have taken place in London, Sydney, Chicago, Seattle, Los Angeles, and New York. A longtime Big Star fan, Mills wrote the liner notes for the 2014 reissue of the band&#x27;s first two releases, 1972&#x27;s &quot;#1 Record&quot; and 1974&#x27;s &quot;Radio City&quot;.

In 2016, he toured to support a &quot;Concerto for Violin, Rock Band, and String Orchestra&quot; with childhood friend Robert McDuffie, along with guitar players William Tonks and John Neff. The tour resumed in 2022.

In 2023, a mushroom species of the genus &quot;Pluteus&quot;, &quot;Pluteus millsii&quot; Justo, Borovička, Grootmyers, Kalichman and S.D. Russell, was named in his honor.

== Musical style ==
Mills&#x27; melodic approach to bass playing is inspired by Paul McCartney of the Beatles and Chris Squire of Yes; Mills has said, &quot;I always played a melodic bass, like a piano bass in some ways ... I never wanted to play the traditional locked into the kick drum, root note bass work.&quot; Mills has more musical training than his bandmates, which he has said &quot;made it easier to turn abstract musical ideas into reality.&quot; He began taking piano lessons at age 14.

During R.E.M.&#x27;s career, Mills often harmonized with Michael Stipe in songs; in the chorus for &quot;Stand&quot;, Mills and Stipe alternate singing lyrics, creating a dialogue. &quot;My voice is the culmination of a lifetime of enjoying harmony,&quot; Mills explained in 2023. &quot;When I was a kid singing in the church choir, I was always finding harmony. I usually got the tenor part. I grew up around music. There was always music in the house. So when R.E.M. started playing, I sang. Our approach was that my voice and Michael&#x27;s voice were extra instruments. It wasn&#x27;t about a lead vocal and a backing vocal and a harmony vocal. It was just more melody and more instrumentation to add to the mix.&quot;

=== Equipment ===
Regarding his best bass sound in R.E.M.&#x27;s catalog, Mills said: &quot;I&#x27;m not a gearhead, and I don&#x27;t always think about it in those terms. The Rick I had for the first couple of records was cool; it sounded alright. The trouble with the Rick was that when the pickups went out, the replacement pickups sucked. Rickenbacker&#x27;s replacement pickups all sucked, so I had to quit playing their bass. I went through this series of Ibanez and various different things. I ended up with a Guild Pilot for the &#x27;89 tour. Which sounded fine; it was cool. It might even be on [&quot;Green&quot;]; I can&#x27;t remember. I finally broke down. I didn&#x27;t want to play a Fender Precision] bass because everybody played one, but then I thought, &#x27;There&#x27;s a reason everybody plays one.&#x27; They&#x27;re the best basses, especially for bigger halls.&quot;

<text>Acadie station is a Montreal Metro in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in the borough of Villeray–Saint-Michel–Parc-Extension (on the border with the town of Mount Royal, Quebec). It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Blue Line. It is located in the Parc-Extension.

== Overview == 
It is a normal side platform station. Two entrances on either side of boul. de l&#x27;Acadie lead to a common ticket hall. The station platform is decorated in bold colours such as blue, hot pink, black, and slate grey. The ticket hall is host to a tall clock and bench ensemble entitled &quot;Lieu de rendez-vous&quot; by Météore Design and the seating is by sculptor Michel Morelli. A series of whimsical photographic works by Jean Mercier showing people turning cartwheels and mid-air somersaults adorns the walls of the stairwell and passages to the exits.

== Origin of name ==
Acadie station was named for the Boulevard de l&#x27;Acadie (&quot;English: Acadie Boulevard&quot;), in turn named to remember Acadia, the site of the first permanent french settlement in North America.

<text>An osmometer is a device for measuring the osmotic strength of a solution, colloid, or compound.

There are several different techniques employed in osmometry:
* [[Freezing point depression osmometer|Freezing point depression osmometers]] may also be used to determine the osmotic strength of a solution, as osmotically active compounds depress the freezing point of a solution. This is the most common method in clinical laboratories because it is the most accurate and simple method.
* [[Vapor pressure osmometry|Vapor pressure osmometers]] determine the concentration of osmotically active particles that reduce the vapor pressure of a solution.
* [[Membrane osmometers]] measure the osmotic pressure of a solution separated from pure solvent by a semipermeable membrane.

Osmometers are useful for determining the total concentration of dissolved salts and sugars in blood or urine samples. Osmometry is also useful in determining the molecular weight of unknown compounds and polymers.

Osmometry is the measurement of the osmotic strength of a substance. This is often used by chemists for the determination of average molecular weight.

Osmometry is also useful for estimating the drought tolerance of plant leaves.

<text>The Battle of Makassar Strait, also known as the Action of Madura Strait, the Action North of Lombok Strait and the Battle of the Flores Sea, was a naval battle of the Pacific theater of World War II. An American-British-Dutch-Australian (ABDA) fleet—under &quot;Schout-bij-nacht&quot; (Rear Admiral) Karel Doorman—was on its way to intercept a Japanese invasion convoy reported as bound for Surabaya (its destination was actually Makassar), when it was attacked by 36 Mitsubishi G4M1 &quot;Betty&quot; and 24 Mitsubishi G3M2 &quot;Nell&quot; medium bombers, which forced the fleet to retreat.

The battle occurred on 4 February 1942 in the Java Sea, closer to the Kangean Islands than to Makassar Strait. This battle should not be confused with the Battle of Balikpapan, which occurred over a week earlier on 24 January 1942, which is also sometimes referred to as the &quot;Battle of Makassar Strait&quot;.

==Background==
At the end of January, Japanese forces had conquered the north and west coast of Borneo and large parts of Maluku (Moluccas). On Borneo&#x27;s east coast, Japanese forces occupied the oil facilities and ports of Balikpapan and Tarakan, and on Celebes the cities of Menado and Kendari had also fallen. To gain full control of Makassar Strait, the Japanese needed to capture the cities of Makassar and Banjarmasin.

On 1 February, Allied commanders received word from a reconnaissance plane: at Balikpapan, a Japanese invasion force—consisting of 20 troop transport ships, three cruisers and 10 destroyers—was preparing to sail. On 2 February, Admiral Thomas C. Hart, &quot;Vice-Admiraal&quot; (Vice Admiral) Conrad Helfrich, Rear Admiral William A. Glassford and (Commodore) John Collins, RAN met at Palembang; Helfrich&#x27;s suggestion that a strike force be formed was approved. It was formed the following day under &quot;Schout-bij-nacht&quot; (Rear Admiral) Karel Doorman, and began taking on supplies at the Gili Islands, south of Madura.

The ABDA force consisted of four cruisers (, which was the flagship, and , and ) escorted by seven destroyers (, , , , , , and ).

==Battle==
On the morning of 3 February, the ABDA strike force was spotted by a formation of about 30 Japanese bombers reported as heading toward Surabaya. Seven of the bombers showed special interest in the strike force and started circling above the ships. The ships initially dispersed to deeper water, but the planes left without attacking, and the strike force resumed taking on supplies.

At about midnight, the ships sailed for &quot;Meinderts Droogte&quot; (Meinderts Reef; later Karang Mas), off the north east tip of Java. The last ship arrived around 05:00 on 4 February. At 09:30, the strike force received word that air patrols from Makassar had spotted the Japanese apparently heading for Surabaya. On the morning of 4 February, the ABDA strike force headed out for Makassar Strait, in search of the Japanese invasion force, which was reported to be passing through the straits and was now said to include three cruisers and 18 destroyers, escorting transports and other ships, under &quot;Sho-sho&quot; (Rear Admiral) Takeo Takagi.

At 09:49, while Doorman&#x27;s strike force was south of the Kangean Islands, Japanese bombers were sighted to the east by sailors on the ABDA ships. The Japanese planes where flying in four &quot;v&quot;-formations at an altitude of about .

The planes attacked the Allied cruisers. The first to be targeted was &quot;Marblehead&quot;, and the bombs landed about in front of the ship. During a second attack, &quot;Marblehead&quot; sustained two direct hits and a damaging near miss. The two direct hits penetrated the deck, killed 15 crew directly and destroyed the ship&#x27;s ability to manoeuver; &quot;Marblehead&quot; was now able only to sail in circles. The near miss also caused a hole , near the bottom of the ship. However, subsequent attacks on &quot;Marblehead&quot; were less intense.

&quot;Houston&quot; initially evaded bombs successfully, but suffered a severe hit during a final attack; a bomb hit the deck near the aft gun turret, and killed 48 crew. The rear guns were rendered useless.

After the hits on &quot;Houston&quot; and &quot;Marblehead&quot;, the planes focused on &quot;De Ruyter&quot;, which evaded four attacks and sustained only minor damage to fire control for its 40 mm guns.

At about 13:00, Doorman ordered his ships to return west and signalled Hart that—without fighter protection—it would not be possible to advance to Makassar Strait, due to the threat from bombers. &quot;Houston&quot; and &quot;Tromp&quot; had already gone south through Alas Strait, and were south of the strait. &quot;Marblehead&quot; and the four U.S. destroyers went south through Lombok Strait. &quot;De Ruyter&quot; and the three Dutch destroyers also stayed with &quot;Marblehead&quot; until the Lombok Strait. Both U.S. cruisers headed for Tjilatjap, to get repairs and medical attention for their wounded.

==Aftermath==
Japanese aircrews reported three cruisers sunk during the attack: one &quot;&quot;Augusta&quot; class cruiser&quot;, one &quot;Tromp&quot;-class cruiser type and one &quot;Java&quot;-class cruiser. However, no ships of the latter class were present during the attack, and only &quot;Marblehead&quot; and &quot;Houston&quot; were damaged.

At Tjilatjap, &quot;Houston&quot; and &quot;Marblehead&quot; transferred their wounded to a hospital and buried their dead. &quot;Marblehead&quot; would not fit in the dry dock, but the hole in the hull was temporarily repaired, and the ship sailed for the east coast of the U.S.—by way of Ceylon and South Africa—for repairs. &quot;Houston&quot; was able to continue service with the ABDA fleet.

The retreat of the strike force resulted in the Japanese taking control of Makassar Strait and thereby tightening their grip on the western part of the Dutch East Indies.

<doc id="1313814" wikidata="Q1668008" url="?curid=1313814" title="Internet Systems Consortium">
<text>Internet Systems Consortium, Inc., also known as ISC, is an American non-profit corporation that supports the infrastructure of the universal, self-organizing Internet by developing and maintaining core production-quality software, protocols, and operations. ISC has developed several key Internet technologies that enable the global Internet, including: BIND, ISC DHCP and Kea. Other software projects no longer in active development include OpenReg and ISC AFTR (an implementation of an IPv4/IPv6 transition protocol based on Dual-Stack Lite).

ISC operates one of the 13 global authoritative DNS root servers, F-Root.

Over the years a number of additional software systems were operated under ISC (for example: INN and Lynx) to better support the Internet&#x27;s infrastructure. ISC also expanded their operational activities to include Internet hosting facilities for other open-source projects such as NetBSD, XFree86, kernel.org, secondary name-service (SNS) for more than 50 top-level domains, and a DNS OARC (Operations, Analysis and Research Center) for monitoring and reporting of the Internet&#x27;s DNS.

ISC is actively involved in the community design process; it authors and participates in the development of the IETF standards, including the production of managed open-source software used as a reference implementation of the DNS.

ISC is primarily funded by the sale of technical support contracts for its open source software.

==History==
Originally the company was founded as the Internet Software Consortium, Inc. The founders included Paul Vixie, Rick Adams and Carl Malamud. The corporation was intended to continue the development of BIND software. The founders believed that it was necessary that BIND&#x27;s maintenance and development be managed and funded by an independent organization. ISC was designated as a root name server operator by IANA, originally as NS.ISC.ORG and later as F.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.

In January 2004, ISC reorganized under the new name Internet Systems Consortium, Inc.

In July 2013, ISC spun off the Security Business Unit to Farsight Security, Inc. a new company started by ISC founder Paul Vixie.

In early 2020, ISC closed its headquarters in Redwood City, California and moved its operations to Newmarket, New Hampshire.

==Open Source==
ISC develops and maintains open source networking software, including BIND and two DHCP implementations: ISC DHCP and Kea DHCP. ISC also distributes INN and several older, unmaintained projects. Some early aspects of its software were developed by developers that were commercially employed by Nominum, amongst others.

==ISC license==

ISC developed and used the ISC license, which is functionally similar to the simplified BSD and MIT licenses. The ISC license is OpenBSD&#x27;s preferred license for new code.

All current versions of ISC-hosted software are available under the Mozilla Public License 2.0.

==DNS root server==
ISC operates the DNS &quot;F&quot; root server, the first such server to be distributed using anycast. In 2007 it was announced that ISC and ICANN would sign an agreement regarding the operation of F, the first such agreement made between ICANN and a root-server operator.

==Usenet moderators list==
ISC maintains and publishes (on ftp.isc.org) the central Usenet moderators list and relays for moderated groups, so individual server operators don&#x27;t have to track moderator changes.

==Internet Domain Survey==

The Internet Domain Survey searched the Domain Name System (DNS) to discover every Internet host. The survey began when only a few hundred hosts were Internet-linked. The earliest published reports, dated 1993, were performed by Network Wizards owner Mark K. Lottor. The Internet host count was in January 1993 and in the January 2017 survey.

ISC ended its sponsorship and publication of the Internet Domain Survey in 2019.

<text>Saint-Michel station () is a Montreal Metro station in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and is the eastern terminus of the Blue Line. It opened in 1986. 

The station briefly closed down in October 2024 due to structural issues with the primary beams above the station&#x27;s walkway. It was re-opened to the public on November 11, 2024.

== Overview == 

It is a side platform station with two entrances on either side of boul. St-Michel connecting to a common ticket hall. Unlike all other stations on the Blue Line, the station is only as long as the six-car trains used on the line; all of the other stations were built to accommodate a nine-car train. However, the station cavern is long enough for a nine-car train; the extra space could be opened and finished to accommodate full-length trains when the STM extends the line east into the boroughs of St. Leonard and Anjou and to commit to the line&#x27;s original design.

The platforms feature four abstract paintings under glass bricks, by Normand Moffat, Charles Lemay, Lauréat Marois, and Marcelin Cardinal.

==Origin of name==
Saint-Michel station takes its name from the street under which it lies, boulevard Saint-Michel, named since about the late eighteenth century for the former Ville Saint-Michel within which it is located. Saint-Michel is the French Catholic title for the archangel Michael.

<doc id="1313833" wikidata="Q770587" url="?curid=1313833" title="Schizophonic (Geri Halliwell album)">
<text>Schizophonic is the debut solo studio album by British pop singer Geri Halliwell. The album was released in June 1999, after her 1998 split from popular girl group the Spice Girls. The term &quot;schizophonic&quot; is a portmanteau of the Greek words &quot;schizo&quot; (&quot;split&quot;, &quot;divide&quot;) and &quot;phonic&quot; (&quot;sound&quot;), and also seemingly a play on the word &quot;schizophrenic&quot; and the musical term &quot;schizophonia&quot;. This was the first solo album released by a Spice Girl.

It produced four singles, all of which saw commercial success in the UK—&quot;Mi Chico Latino&quot;, &quot;Lift Me Up&quot; and &quot;Bag It Up&quot; reached number one, while the first single &quot;Look at Me&quot; peaked at number two. As of 2001, the album has sold over two million copies worldwide.

==Background==

On 31 May 1998, it was announced that Halliwell had left girl group Spice Girls, with the singer claiming that she was suffering from exhaustion and wanted to take a break. However, rumours of a feud with fellow member Melanie Brown as the reason for her departure were circulated by the press. Halliwell&#x27;s departure from the group became one of the biggest entertainment news stories of the year, making news headlines the world over. The four remaining members were adamant that the group would carry on, and continued their Spiceworld Tour without her in the summer of 1998. In 2007, she stated on BBC One documentary &quot;Giving You Everything&quot; that she had &quot;given all I could&quot; and felt like she &quot;didn&#x27;t belong anymore. They didn&#x27;t need me anymore, really, and I definitely felt very redundant.&quot;

As a solo artist, Halliwell signed a three-album deal with EMI worth US$3 million, influenced by Robbie Williams&#x27; solo success after leaving Take That. She then started developing her debut album, asking the Absolute production team—Paul Watson and Andy Watkins—who had already produced songs for the Spice Girls, for help. Allegedly, the four remaining girls from the Spice Girls said that if they worked with Halliwell, they could not work with them again. Eventually, the duo decided to work with the singer. The next year, she launched her solo career and released her debut album titled &quot;Schizophonic&quot;, which she described as &quot;a cross between Julie Andrews and Johnny Rotten&quot;.

==Promotion==
The album&#x27;s release was promoted with a documentary, &quot;Geri&quot;, which was directed by Molly Dineen and screened by Channel 4 on 5 May 1999, following Halliwell&#x27;s life after her departure from the Spice Girls. Later Halliwell admitted that &quot;With hindsight, it was a mistake, but I was very out of sorts, I was lonely and I felt starved of friendship and intellectual company, which Molly gave me because she is so totally intellectual.&quot; While she does not regret doing the documentary, she found it &quot;far too upsetting a prospect to even consider watching it again&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Schizophonic&quot; received generally mixed reviews from music critics. In his review for &quot;The Independent&quot;, Nicholas Barber declared &quot;Schizophonic&quot; &quot;considerably more sophisticated and more obviously packed with hits than either of the Spice Girls&#x27; albums.&quot; &quot;People&quot; called the album &quot;flip, fun froth from a former Spice.&quot; The magazine wrote that &quot;the self-worth, Girl Power sloganeering of her old group is replaced here by Halliwell&#x27;s plucky, self-deprecating statement of Geri-empowerment [...] Except for a few oversweetened ballads and two ill-advised forays into foreign (Latin and Indian) genres, Solo Girl comports herself well indeed.&quot; Karen Schoemer from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; remarked that &quot;Schizophonic&quot; &quot;is more Girl Chutzpah than Girl Power. Geri seems intent on being all spices: sweet, salty, flirty, bossy [...] Geri&#x27;s voice is flat and unsyncopated – she puts syllables in the darnedest places between the beat – but it has a surprising, undeniable charm. She&#x27;s like a really enthusiastic impersonator, so anxious to win you over that you give in. &quot;Schizophonic&quot; doesn&#x27;t reveal any hidden talents.&quot;

AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine felt that &quot;unfortunately, Halliwell doesn&#x27;t have strong collaborators, who know how to exploit her admittedly limited voice, so much of it falls a little flat musically.&quot; He felt that the album&#x27;s most successful tracks were its upbeat ones, which &quot;sparkle with a gleeful, unabashed love of pop and dance.&quot; Erlewine concluded that the album &quot;doesn&#x27;t work on some levels, [but] it does succeed as a statement of purpose from the newly independent Halliwell.&quot; Chris Charles, writing for BBC News, found that &quot;Schizophonic&quot; &quot;sees Geri adopt – or attempt to adopt – so many alter-egos that it is difficult to pin-point which is the real her [...] This mixing and matching is Geri all over. One minute she&#x27;s popping out of a skimpy Union jack number, the next she&#x27;s the prissie librarian figure clutching her pampered pooch.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Schizo-phonic&quot;, breaking every seduction rule of women&#x27;s magazines, is an act of pure desperation. Count the signs: the 60-piece orchestra; the Latino number; the plucky showstopper, the maudlin ballad. It&#x27;s clichid like a river of tears running past, yes, a mountain so high, yet when you&#x27;re trying to be all things to all people, that&#x27;s inevitable.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
In the United Kingdom, &quot;Schizophonic&quot; debuted at number four on the UK Albums Chart, with sales of 35,000 copies. It sold 483,853 in total, being certified two-times Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipments of 600,000 copies. In Canada, the album debuted and peaked at number 15. With strong long-term sales the album was certified Platinum with just over 100,000 copies shipped. In the United States, the album faced moderate success, selling 40,000 copies in its first week debuting and peaking at number 42 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the strongest Spice Girls solo showing on the chart. It shipped 500,000 copies and received a Gold certification in the country by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). According to Nielsen SoundScan, &quot;Schizophonic&quot; has sold 181,000 copies there as of July 2007. The album was also certified Gold in Australia and Spain with shipments of over 35,000 and 50,000 copies, respectively. However, the album only reached number 85 in Japan, selling 3,190 copies. By August of the same year of release, more than 1.3 million copies had been distributed through stores, by 2001, more than two million copies had been sold worldwide.

==Singles==
Three of the four singles from the album went to number one in the United Kingdom, while the debut single made number two. The lead single was &quot;Look at Me&quot;, produced by Absolute and Phil Bucknall. It was released in the United Kingdom on 10 May 1999, the same week as Boyzone&#x27;s &quot;You Needed Me&quot;. In early 1999, Boyzone was at the height of its own success with five UK number-ones, however, Halliwell was confident that &quot;Look at Me&quot; would reach number one. Though more transactions were made of the &quot;Look at Me&quot; single, two CD singles of &quot;You Needed Me&quot; were released in order for fans to purchase both and ensure that Boyzone made it to the number-one position. &quot;Look at Me&quot; entered the UK Singles Chart at number two, selling 140,000 copies in its first week; it was only 700 copies behind &quot;You Needed Me&quot;. Halliwell was disappointed with the outcome of the chart performance for &quot;Look at Me&quot;, since she had believed that it would reach number one. She had also feared that her career would be ruined six months after the release of the single. However, Halliwell would earn her first UK number-one single with &quot;Mi Chico Latino&quot;. &quot;Look at Me&quot; went on to sell 330,812 copies in the United Kingdom alone, being certified Gold by the BPI, and over 1.5 million copies worldwide.

&quot;Mi Chico Latino&quot; debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart on 22 August 1999, selling 132,000 copies in its first week, becoming Halliwell&#x27;s first number-one solo single in the country. It also was the beginning of a sequence of four consecutive Halliwell singles reaching number one in the United Kingdom. It spent fifteen weeks in the charts, and went on to sell almost 383,000 copies in the UK and was certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). &quot;Mi Chico Latino&quot; experienced moderate success in other European markets. In Austria, it entered the singles chart at number 34, eventually peaking at number 27 and spending a total of eight weeks on the chart. In France, the song peaked at number 40, remaining on the chart for ten weeks in total. On the Swiss Singles Chart dated 19 September 1999, it peaked at number 26. In Australia, &quot;Mi Chico Latino&quot; debuted at its peak of number 43 on the issue dated 5 September 1999. The song also experienced success in the United States, peaking at number 19 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot Dance Club Songs chart.

&quot;Lift Me Up&quot; was the third single from the album and the second single which ultimately reached number one on the UK Singles Chart on 13 November 1999, selling 140,000 copies in its first week, 30,000 more copies than &quot;What I Am&quot;. Its total sales are 346,000 copies in the United Kingdom, and the single enjoyed a fifteen-week run in the UK chart. The music video for &quot;Lift Me Up&quot; was directed by Howard Greenhalgh and filmed in October 1999 in Málaga, Spain.

&quot;Bag It Up&quot; was the final single from the album and was sold 106,000 copies in its first week, becoming Halliwell&#x27;s third consecutive solo number one on the UK Singles Chart. It has sold over 260,000 copies and been certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry. The music video to &quot;Bag It Up&quot; was filmed in January 2000 and was directed by Dawn Shadforth.

&quot;Schizophonic&quot; was released with two different covers, representing an angel (white), and a devil (red); both covers are the same edition of the album. On the first &quot;O&quot; on &quot;Schizophonic&quot;, there is an angel halo on the white cover and horns on the red cover. On the back cover, the song titles are written in both red and white, relating the theme of the song to one of the personalities.

<doc id="1313836" wikidata="Q3343654" url="?curid=1313836" title="Norumbega">
<text>Norumbega, or Nurembega, is a legendary settlement in northeastern North America which was featured on many early maps from the 16th century until European colonization of the region. It was alleged that the houses had pillars of gold and the inhabitants carried quarts of pearls on their heads.

The word &quot;Norumbega&quot; was originally spelled &quot;Oranbega&quot; in Giovanni da Verrazzano&#x27;s 1529 map of America, and the word is believed to derive from one of the Algonquian languages spoken in New England. It may mean &quot;quiet place between the rapids&quot; or &quot;quiet stretch of water&quot;. In 1542, Jean Allefonsce reported that he had coasted south from Newfoundland and had discovered a great river. It often appeared on subsequent European maps of North America, lying south of Acadia in what is now New England. 

The town of Bangor, Maine, commemorated the legend during the nineteenth century, naming their municipal hall &quot;Norumbega Hall&quot;. In 1886, inventor Joseph Barker Stearns built a mansion named &quot;Norumbega Castle&quot;, which still stands on US Route 1 in Camden, Maine, overlooking Penobscot Bay. During the late 19th century, Eben Norton Horsford associated the name and legend of Norumbega with supposed Norse settlements on the Charles River, and built the Norumbega Tower at the confluence of Stony Brook and the Charles River in Weston, Massachusetts, where he claimed Fort Norumbega was located. In honor of Horsford&#x27;s generous donations to Wellesley College, a building named Norumbega Hall was dedicated in 1886 and celebrated in a poem by John Greenleaf Whittier. Presently, the myth is commemorated by such place names as Norumbega Mountain (formerly Brown Mountain) in Acadia National Park.

<doc id="1313846" wikidata="Q2619487" url="?curid=1313846" title="Historical Latvian Lands">
<text>Historical Latvian Lands () or formerly Cultural regions of Latvia () are several areas within Latvia formally recognised as distinct from the rest of the country. These are: Kurzeme (Courland), Zemgale (Semigallia), Latgale (Latgalia), Vidzeme, and Sēlija (Selonia). While some of these regions are seen purely as culturally distinct, others have historically been parts of different countries and have been used to divide the country for administrative and other purposes.

On 16 June 2021, the Saeima adopted the which aims to create the necessary preconditions for strengthening the common identity of the population and for the preservation and sustainable development of the cultural and historical environment and cultural spaces of the historical Latvian lands. The Law assigns each parish and town in Latvia to one of the five historical Latvian regions: Vidzeme, Latgale, Kurzeme, Zemgale, and Sēlija. The state city of Riga, a Baltic metropolis, is a historical part of Vidzeme and the special identity and the particularities of the cultural and historical environment of Riga should be supported and promoted.

== Historical Latvian Lands ==
The Latvian nation was formed from the cultures of peoples that inhabited the Historical Latvian Lands: Livonians, Curonians, Latgalians (ancient and modern), Selonians, and Semigalians, under the influence of the Baltic German culture.

The Appendix 1 to the Historical Latvian Lands Law enumerates the cities (or city parts) and parishes according to the historical lands.

*Courland (, Livonian: &quot;Kurāmō&quot;), the westernmost part of Latvia, consisting of the cities of Liepāja and Ventspils and the municipalities of Kuldīga, Saldus, South Kurzeme, Talsi and Ventspils. Traditional Courland also includes environs of Klaipėda County and Telšiai County in the northwestern part of Lithuania.
*Semigallia () is the central part of Latvia. Zemgale is bounded by Kurzeme in the west, the Gulf of Riga, the Daugava river and Vidzeme in the north, Selonia in the east and the Lithuanian border in the south. It consists of the city of Jelgava and the municipalities of Ķekava, Bauska, Dobele, Jelgava and Tukums. Traditional Semigallia also includes the northern part of Šiauliai County in Lithuania.
*Selonia () is often considered a part of Semigallia. Selonia comprises the eastern part of the 1939 province of Semigallia, roughly corresponding to parts of the former Aizkraukle, Daugavpils and Jēkabpils districts south of Daugava river. Traditional Selonia also includes a portion of north east Lithuania. Named after the Selonians.
*Vidzeme (Livonian: &quot;Vidūmō&quot;), meaning &quot;Middle land&quot;, is also known as Livonia or Livland, though it comprises only the Latvian part of Swedish Livonia and the city of Riga. It roughly corresponds to the former Alūksne, Cēsis, Gulbene, Limbaži, Madona, Valka, Valmiera districts and parts of Aizkraukle, Ogre and Riga districts north of Daugava river.
*Latgallia (, Latgalian: &quot;Latgola&quot;), the part of Livonia still in the hands of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth after the Treaty of Altmark in 1629, then called &quot;Polish Livonia&quot; or Inflanty Voivodeship. It roughly corresponds to Balvi, Krāslava, Ludza, Preiļi, Rēzekne districts and parts of Daugavpils and Jēkabpils districts north of Daugava river. The Latgalian language, a dialect of Latvian, is based on this territory.
In some cases, Kurzeme, Sēlija and Zemgale are combined into one region. This reflects the political division of Latvia between 1629 and 1917, when Kurzeme and Zemgale were together, first as the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, then as the Courland Governorate in the Russian Empire while Vidzeme and Latgale as parts of the Duchy of Livonia were politically separate, both from Courland and one from another since the 17 century. From this perspective, there are three regions: Kurzeme (including Zemgale and Sēlija), Vidzeme and Latgale. Such division is no longer commonly used but it can be seen in the coat of arms of Latvia and the &quot;Monument of Freedom&quot; in Riga both of which contain three stars: for Kurzeme, Vidzeme and Latgale, which were united into Latvia in 1918.

<doc id="1313848" wikidata="Q1703639" url="?curid=1313848" title="Jordan Motor Car Company">
<text>The Jordan Motor Car Company was founded in 1916 in Cleveland, Ohio by Edward S. &quot;Ned&quot; Jordan, a former advertising executive from Thomas B. Jeffery Company of Kenosha, Wisconsin. The factory produced what were known as &quot;assembled cars&quot; until 1931, using components from other manufacturers. Jordan cars were noted more for attractive styling than for advanced engineering, although they did bring their share of innovations to the marketplace. The company&#x27;s advertising was often more original than the cars themselves; said Jordan, &quot;Cars are too dull and drab.&quot; He reasoned that since people dressed smartly, they were willing to drive &quot;smart looking cars&quot; as well.
==Establishment in Cleveland==
Jordan Motor Car established its plant east of downtown Cleveland at 1070 East 152nd Street in the Collinwood neighborhood along the Nickel Plate Railroad tracks. This not only provided an ideal location for shipping the finished cars but also provided Jordan with ready access to out-of-area suppliers. The plant was built in two stages: the first building was begun on April 5, 1916 and finished some seven weeks later, while the second addition was completed within months of the first structure. In their first year of production (1916), Jordan sold over one thousand vehicles.

==Manufacturing Methods==
The Jordan was an &quot;assembled automobile&quot;, with parts obtained from outside vendors. The cars were powered by Continental engines, used Timken axles, Bijur starters and Bosch ignitions. According to Ned Jordan&#x27;s biographer, James Lackey, the source of early Jordan bodies was somewhat a mystery. While Jordan had the capacity to paint the automobile bodies, attach them to the chassis and outfit the passenger compartment, the facility was unable to fabricate the bodies themselves. Later production bodies were shipped from a variety of manufacturers in Ohio and Massachusetts, fabricated from aluminum.

While most automobile producers limited themselves to a single color combination and Ford relied exclusively on the fast-drying Japan Black lacquer which cured in a matter of hours, Jordan automobiles were available in three colors of red - &quot;Apache Red&quot;, &quot;Mercedes Red&quot;, and &quot;Savage Red&quot;- as well as &quot;Ocean Sand Gray&quot;, &quot;Venetian Green&quot;, &quot;Briarcliff Green&quot;, &quot;Egyptian Bronze&quot;, &quot;Liberty Blue&quot; and &quot;Chinese Blue&quot;. Black was also available. The most-flamboyant of color schemes was on the four-passenger Sport model, which could be ordered in &quot;Submarine Gray&quot;, with khaki top and orange wheels.

Details given the cars were unusually advanced for an independently made assembled car; for example, Jordans boasted one of the first cowl fresh-air ventilation systems. Jordan also went to all-steel construction in the mid-1920s, some ten years before Buick and eight years before Chrysler introduced the advanced Airflow models.

In 1917, Jordan&#x27;s 60 Series Limousine had a 6-cylinder, 303.1-cubic-inch Continental engine. Jordan purchased and installed straight-six engines for its 1919 Series F and 1920-1921 Series M cars. In 1922, the Series MX model featured a 246-cubic-inch, six-cylinder flathead engine. In 1926, their Line Eight and Great Line Eight models offered, corresponding to their names, eight-cylinder engines. The 1931 Model 90 was powered by an eight-cylinder, 85-horsepower engine.

==Jordan marketing==
Jordan was also one of the first automakers to christen its model types with unique, evocative names, such as the Sport Marine (with &quot;fashionably low&quot; 32×4-inch {81×10 cm} wheels, it was &quot;essentially a woman&#x27;s car&quot;), Tomboy, and Playboy. He originally wanted to name the car with the World War I term &quot;Doughboy,&quot; but decided on the common-sensical-but-provocative Playboy instead. In 1920, the company issued the Friendly Three coupe, with the slogan &quot;Seats two, three if they&#x27;re friendly&quot;.

Jordan used the suburbs of Cleveland Heights and Shaker Heights as backdrops for his advertising photographs, setting the cars in front of the mansions of Overlook and South Park Drives.

Appearing in the June, 1923 edition of the Saturday Evening Post, the ad promoted the Jordan Playboy in art by Fred Cole, driven by a cloche hat wearing flapper hunkered down behind the wheel in abstract fashion, racing a cowboy and the clouds.&lt;br&gt; :

While other Jordan ads contained the same winsome prose, one in particular had an unseen outcome: Jordan&#x27;s &quot;Port of Missing Men&quot;, which also appeared in the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; (1920), featured Jordan&#x27;s musings on restless men and those places where they travel to when they needed to get away. The ad featured art work showing a Jordan Playboy in front of a cottage in winter by the sea, with a young boy walking by, looking up to the second story window aglow red from within.

Jordan wrote to the editor of the &quot;Post&quot;:

==Final years of production (1927-1931)==
In 1927, the firm introduced its only significant misstep: the Little Custom, a luxury compact. Not only did consumers ignore the car but its financial drain on the company was a leading factor in the takeover by bankers of JMC, leaving Ned Jordan as the company’s titular head. Both Jordan and his wife began divesting their interests in the company in 1928.

The company survived the stock market crash of 1929, but with intense competition among the many US automakers then extant, and personal problems besetting Ned Jordan, the company ceased production in 1931.

The true total production of Jordan cars is unclear; some sources list the total amount as high as over 100,000 units, while other sources list the production as low as 30,000.

Annual production of the Jordan is indicated below (sourced from &quot;The Standard Catalog of American Cars 1805-1932, 3rd edition):

<text>U and non-U English usage, where &quot;U&quot; stands for upper class and &quot;non-U&quot; represents the aspiring middle and lower classes, was part of the terminology of popular discourse of social dialects (sociolects) in Britain in the 1950s. The different vocabularies can often appear quite counter-intuitive: the middle classes prefer &quot;fancy&quot; or fashionable words, even neologisms and often euphemisms, in attempts to make themselves sound more refined (&quot;posher than posh&quot;), while the upper classes in many cases stick to the same plain and traditional words that the working classes also use, as, confident in the security of their social position, they have no need to seek to display refinement.

== History ==

The discussion was set in motion in 1954 by the British linguist Alan S. C. Ross, professor of linguistics in the University of Birmingham. He coined the terms &quot;U&quot; and &quot;non-U&quot; in an article on the differences social class makes in English language usage, published in a Finnish professional linguistics journal. Though his article included differences in pronunciation and writing styles, it was his remark about differences of vocabulary that received the most attention.

The upper class English author Nancy Mitford was alerted and immediately took up the usage in an essay, &quot;The English Aristocracy&quot;, which Stephen Spender published in his magazine &quot;Encounter&quot; in 1954. Mitford provided a glossary of terms used by the upper classes (some appear in the table), unleashing an anxious national debate about English class-consciousness and snobbery, which involved a good deal of soul-searching that itself provided fuel for the fires. The essay was reprinted, with contributions by Evelyn Waugh, John Betjeman, and others, as well as a &quot;condensed and simplified version&quot; of Ross&#x27;s original article, as &quot;Noblesse Oblige: an Enquiry into the Identifiable Characteristics of the English Aristocracy&quot; in 1956. Betjeman&#x27;s poem &quot;How to Get On in Society&quot; concluded the collection.

The issue of U and non-U could have been taken lightheartedly, but at the time many took it very seriously. This was a reflection of the anxieties of the middle class in Britain of the 1950s, recently emerged from post-war austerities. In particular the media used it as a launch pad for many stories, making much more out of it than was first intended. In the meantime, the idea that one might &quot;improve oneself&quot; by adopting the culture and manner of one&#x27;s &quot;betters&quot;, instinctively assented to before World War II, was now greeted with resentment.

Some of the terms and the ideas behind them were largely obsolete by the late 20th century, when, in the United Kingdom, reverse snobbery led younger members of the British upper and middle classes to adopt elements of working class speech, such as Estuary English or Mockney. However, many, if not most, of the differences remain very much current, and can therefore continue to be used as class indicators.

===American usage===

A study in 1940 on the speaking differences between the American upper and middle classes revealed a strong similarity with the results of Ross&#x27;s research. For instance, the American upper class said &#x27;curtains&#x27;, whilst the middle class used &#x27;drapes&#x27;. Notably, the well-heeled would use &#x27;toilet&#x27; whereas the less well-heeled would say &#x27;lavatory&#x27;, an inversion of the British usage.

<doc id="1313870" wikidata="Q1249604" url="?curid=1313870" title="Robot (Doctor Who)">
<text>Robot is the first serial of the 12th season in the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was first broadcast in four weekly parts on BBC1 from 28 December 1974 to 18 January 1975. It was the first full serial to feature Tom Baker as the Fourth Doctor, as well as Ian Marter as new companion Harry Sullivan. In the serial, the director of an English research institute plots to use an experimental robot to steal nuclear launch codes and blackmail the world&#x27;s governments with them.

The serial brought a full end to the Pertwee era, as it was the final story with the production team of Barry Letts and script editor Terrance Dicks. It was also the final regular appearance of UNIT, who had become regulars starting with the first Jon Pertwee serial &quot;Spearhead From Space&quot;.

The episode received mixed reviews from critics, seeing praise for the acting, especially that of Baker and Marter, but criticisms due to stereotypical villains and a weak plot.

== Plot ==
Following his regeneration, the Fourth Doctor becomes delirious and erratic. The Doctor tries to sneak off in his TARDIS, but the Brigadier and Sarah Jane stop him, convincing him to help in finding the culprit in the theft of top secret plans for a disintegrator gun.

Sarah investigates the National Institute for Advanced Scientific Research, colloquially known as the &quot;Think Tank&quot;. She finds that director Hilda Winters, her assistant Arnold Jellicoe, and Professor J.P. Kettlewell are developing a robot, K1, to be used to perform tasks in hazardous locations. Winters and Jellicoe have secretly instructed K1 to kill Cabinet Minister Joseph Chambers, and use a completed disintegrator gun to steal international nuclear launch codes from Chambers&#x27; safe. K1 discovers Sarah&#x27;s presence, and Winters orders K1 to kill her. When UNIT arrives, the three conspirators and K1 escape with Sarah as their hostage.

Winters sends a list of demands to the world governments and gives them thirty minutes to comply, then orders Kettlewell to connect to the launch computers. Kettlewell, who never expected their plan to get to this stage, hesitates, and in the ensuing discussion, Sarah and Harry attempt to escape with Kettlewell&#x27;s assistance. Winters orders K1 to stop them, but the robot inadvertently fires the disintegrator gun at Kettlewell, killing him. In a confused state due to the death of its creator, K1 falls to the ground and apparently shuts down. 

As UNIT forces take Winters and Jellicoe away, K1 reactivates and attacks UNIT. K1 seeks out Sarah to protect her, a result of an Oedipus complex it developed from Sarah&#x27;s previous compassion, according to the Doctor. The Doctor finds out about the living metal that Kettlewell used in constructing K1 and the metal virus he designed to reduce the world&#x27;s metallic waste. He races back to Kettlewell&#x27;s lab to synthesise a batch of the virus.The Brigadier fires the disintegrator gun at the robot, but the blast is absorbed by the living metal- and K1 grows to an enormous size. The Doctor returns, throwing a bucket of virus solution onto K1; the robot slowly shrinks before the virus consumes it. As they regroup back at UNIT headquarters, Sarah is saddened by the loss of K1. The Doctor offers to cheer her up with a trip in the TARDIS, extending the invitation to Harry as well.

== Production ==
As the Doctor was transitioning from the third to the fourth incarnations, changes were also occurring in the production department of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Barry Letts, who had been the producer since the second Jon Pertwee serial in 1970, was leaving the series, but would stay on to cast the part of the new Doctor as well as produce this debut serial. Letts would be succeeded for the next story by Philip Hinchcliffe, who trailed him on this story.

Terrance Dicks, who had worked on the series as a script editor since 1968, was also leaving, to be replaced by Robert Holmes. Holmes had been a writer for the show since season six and penned four stories in Pertwee&#x27;s era, including &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot; (1970), the Third Doctor&#x27;s first serial. Though Dicks was leaving as script editor, he would still be involved with the series as an occasional writer. Having previously helped write the serials &quot;The Seeds of Death&quot; and &quot;The War Games&quot; (both 1969), Dicks would write the first story for the incoming Fourth Doctor.

The K1 robot costume was designed by one of the series&#x27; regular costume designers at the time, James Acheson, and built by sculptor Allister Bowtell.

=== Conception and writing ===
Terrance Dicks stated that a major influence for this story was &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933). The initial script was written before Tom Baker had been cast as the Fourth Doctor, and there was some discussion of returning to an older actor. This would have required a younger character to handle the action scenes, so the character of Harry Sullivan was created. This was Sullivan&#x27;s debut story, but he had been mentioned in the final episode of the preceding serial, when the Brigadier telephoned him, requesting medical help for the Doctor.

Dicks included a number of elements from &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot;: the Doctor being disorientated after regeneration, going to hospital to recover, changing costume as a result of escaping from hospital in a hospital gown, viewing himself in a mirror to see his new face, and storing the TARDIS key in his shoe. These elements helped the audience with the transition between actors.

=== Casting ===

It was known beforehand that Jon Pertwee would be leaving his role as the Third Doctor and that a new Fourth Doctor would need to be cast for the part. Tom Baker had previously had major parts in several films, including &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot; (1971) and &quot;The Vault of Horror&quot; (1973), but had found himself unemployed as an actor and working in construction at the time. He had written to Bill Slater, the Head of Serials at the BBC, asking for work. Slater suggested Baker to &quot;Doctor Who&quot; producer Barry Letts, who had been looking to fill the part. Letts saw Baker&#x27;s work in &quot;The Golden Voyage of Sinbad&quot; (1973) and hired him. Baker would continue in his role as the Doctor for seven seasons, longer than any other actor.

Nicholas Courtney and John Levene reprised their roles as Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart and Sergeant Benton respectively. Levene had started his role with the Second Doctor story &quot;The Invasion&quot; (1968) as a member of the military organisation UNIT (the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce). Courtney started earlier in the same year in &quot;The Web of Fear&quot;, with his character&#x27;s rank being a colonel. They, along with Sladen, would be the transition cast to carry through from the Third Doctor to the Fourth Doctor, though this would be the only UNIT story for the twelfth season. The Earth-based stories involving UNIT, which had regularly featured in the Third Doctor&#x27;s period, were introduced partly as an effort to reduce production costs when the series moved into colour by Peter Bryant and Derrick Sherwin, the show&#x27;s previous producer and script editor, as well as to base the series more on &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; (1953).

Edward Burnham portrays Professor Kettlewell, the wild-haired, bespectacled boffin who creates the titular K1 robot. Along with Courtney and Levene, Burnham had also appeared in &quot;The Invasion&quot;, where he played another scientist, Professor Watkins. The part of the K1 robot is played by Michael Kilgarriff who had played another robotic part in &quot;The Tomb of the Cybermen&quot; (1967), the Cyberman Controller. Patricia Maynard is cast in the part of Miss Hilda Winters, the director of the National Institute for Advanced Scientific Research. Miss Winters&#x27; assistant, Arnold Jellicoe, is played by Alec Linstead. Linstead had played the part of Sergeant Osgood—a member of the technical staff at UNIT—in &quot;The Dæmons&quot; (1971).

=== Filming ===
This was the first serial to be produced for the season. This was also the first &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial to have its location material shot entirely on videotape using outside broadcasting facilities, as opposed to the more usual BBC television drama practice of the time of shooting studio interiors on videotape and location exteriors on 16 mm film. This was due to the large number of video effects involving the eponymous robot required in exterior scenes (shot at the then BBC Engineering Training Department at Wood Norton, Worcestershire), which were easier and more convincing to marry to videotape than to film. The team had learned that lesson during the previous season&#x27;s &quot;Invasion of the Dinosaurs&quot;. The Wood Norton facility was chosen for location shooting because it had an underground bunker, which director Christopher Barry felt would be suitable for the entrance to the underground complex in the story; however, they were refused permission to shoot in that area.

== Broadcast and reception ==
&quot;Robot&quot; was the first serial of the twelfth season of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Part one of &quot;Robot&quot; was first broadcast on BBC One on Saturday, 28 December 1974 and had a viewership of 10.8 million, which was higher than the first serial for season eleven. The next three parts were broadcast over the next successive Saturdays, each having an audience of over 10 million with the exception of the part four on Saturday, 18 January 1975 which only had viewership of 9 million.

=== Reception ===

Viewer reaction was mixed as defined in an &quot;Audience Research Report&quot; conducted by the BBC. About 30% felt the show was &quot;definitely enjoyable&quot; with a lower percentage being &quot;distinctly unimpressed&quot;. A number of viewers thought the new Doctor would &quot;take some getting used to&quot;, but most younger viewers gave positive comments about the serial. As with all of the Doctors, Baker received some criticism by the audience, who felt he was a &quot;loony&quot; and presented as &quot;stupid&quot;.

Writing for &quot;Doctor Who Bulletin&quot; in 1988, Jonathan Way felt the serial was fun, and for the same publication, Robert Cope praised Baker&#x27;s performance as the new Doctor, also noting that the relationship between Baker&#x27;s Doctor and Sladen&#x27;s Sarah worked well. David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker, writing in &quot;The Television Companion&quot;, admired the performances of Nicholas Courtney and Elisabeth Sladen and felt Marter&#x27;s debut as Harry Sullivan was promising. They also commended the K1 robot costume, but criticised the use of CSO (colour-separation overlay) effects for a number of shots involving the K1 robot, as did Robert Cope. In &quot;Doctor Who Episode by Episode&quot;, Ray Dexter described Baker&#x27;s &quot;over-the-top&quot; performance as &quot;compelling&quot; but the plot as &quot;a little lazy and derivative, with some terrible science.&quot; He considered the dialogue &quot;some of the best we&#x27;ve seen&quot; but added that &quot;the story falls into the typical Dicks trap of just having baddies being bad because they&#x27;re bad, and a logical robot behaving utterly illogically&quot;. He also thought the location work on video &quot;cheapens the look of the show&quot; and criticised the effects as &quot;not good enough, not even for this era&quot;.

Mark Braxton of &quot;Radio Times&quot; awarded the serial three stars out of five, praising the introduction of Baker and Marter, as well as the K1 concept. However, he felt that the villains were stereotypical and wrote that &quot;Robot&quot; &quot;boasts perhaps the show&#x27;s worst visual effect ever&quot;. IGN reviewer Arnold Blumburg gave the story a rating of 7 out of 10, attributing its success to Baker. He too criticised the effects, feeling that it made the story &quot;[fail] when trying to present an epic conclusion&quot;. DVD Talk&#x27;s Nick Lyons wrote that it &quot;may not be the most original episode, but it is one of the stronger episodes of the Baker years simply because it never drags and is a breezy action-adventure. It doesn&#x27;t hurt that the robot itself is a nifty villain&quot;. He gave the serial three and a half out of five stars. In 2010, &quot;SFX&quot; named the scene where the Doctor tries on many different costumes as one of the silliest moments in the show&#x27;s history.

Reviewing the serial in 2007, literary critic John Kenneth Muir noted several influences on the writing of &quot;Robot&quot;. Kettlewell&#x27;s K1 robot is programmed so that it cannot harm humans; Muir traces the inspiration for this directly from the Three Laws of Robotics devised by Isaac Asimov in his 1950 story collection, &quot;I, Robot&quot;. He also considers the relationship of Sarah Jane Smith with the K1 robot, its transformation into gigantic antagonist (holding a captive damsel in distress, Sarah, in its claw) and its tragic destruction by military force as an analogue of the 1933 film, &quot;King Kong&quot;.

<doc id="1313878" wikidata="Q7103029" url="?curid=1313878" title="Orlando Health/Amtrak station">
<text>Orlando Health/Amtrak station, also known as Orlando station, is a train station in Orlando, Florida. It is served by Amtrak, the national railroad passenger system of the United States, and SunRail, the commuter rail service of Greater Orlando, as well as local and intercity buses. It serves Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; and &quot;Floridian&quot; lines. Built in 1926, the historic station is located in Downtown Orlando approximately one mile south of the central business district, near the campus of Orlando Health. Serving 160,442 passengers at last measure in 2013, The station is Amtrak&#x27;s fifth busiest in the Southeastern United States; it is the second busiest Amtrak station in Florida, behind the Sanford station of the Auto Train.

==History==

The station was built in 1926 by A.M. Griffin and W. T. Hadlow for the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad (ACL). The building was designed in the Spanish Mission style. It became part of the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad after the Coast line merged with the Seaboard Air Line Railroad in 1967.

===Service in peak years===
Prior to the decline in operations in the 1950s and 1960s several long distance trains operated by the ACL ran through the station. 
*&quot;Champion&quot; (West Coast) New York – Sarasota
*&quot;Havana Special&quot; New York and the train&#x27;s Sarasota section

Shuttle sections that fed off these trains in Jacksonville, to points south. In Jacksonville connections could be made with trains that originated in either Chicago or Cincinnati:
*&quot;City of Miami,&quot; &quot;Dixie Flagler,&quot; &quot;Dixie Flyer,&quot; &quot;Dixie Limited,&quot; &quot;Flamingo,&quot; &quot;Seminole,&quot; &quot;South Wind,&quot; &quot;Southland&quot;

For a period after a strike on the Florida East Coast Railway interrupted service on its coastal route, from 1964 to 1968, the ACL and its successor, the SCL, ran trains making local stops down the Atlantic Coast from Jacksonville to Miami, notably including a stop in Orlando. This provided the first direct rail service from Orlando to Miami.

===Amtrak===
Amtrak continued the &quot;Champion,&quot; and also added a St. Petersburg section to the &quot;Silver Star&quot; that also called at Orlando. Until 1979, the St. Petersburg section of the Chicago-originating &quot;Floridian&quot; stopped in Orlando as well. The &quot;Champion&quot; was folded into the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; in 1979, and both it and the &quot;Silver Star&quot; continued to serve Orlando via Tampa Bay sections (which terminated in St. Petersburg before 1984 and in Tampa after 1984).

In 1993, the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; was extended to South Florida, thus providing the first one-seat ride between Orlando and Miami since 1968. Starting in the fall of 1996, the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; and &quot;Silver Star&quot; were routed through Orlando after both trains dropped their Tampa Bay sections. The &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; was shortened to Sanford. Later in the decade, the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; was extended to Orlando again. As a result of Hurricane Katrina, the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; was suspended east of New Orleans in 2005. On November 10, 2024, the &quot;Silver Star&quot; was merged with the as the &quot;Floridian&quot;.

===SunRail===
In 2014, the City of Orlando started a project to build a second platform for use by the new SunRail commuter rail service. Unlike most SunRail stations, which feature shelters consisting of white aluminum poles supporting sloped green roofs, the station&#x27;s canopies feature arches that resemble the mission-style architecture of the adjacent historic station&#x27;s canopy. It also includes ticket vending machines, ticket validators, emergency call boxes, drinking fountains, and separate platforms designed for passengers in wheelchairs. The station was officially named Orlando Health/Amtrak Station due to its proximity to the main Orlando Health hospital campus, Orlando Regional Medical Center, the Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children and the Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women &amp; Babies. The revamped station opened on May 1, 2014.

In August 2014, the City of Orlando announced a $2.1 million station restoration project for the historic building. The project, which was the first major renovation to the facility since 1990, included fixing cracks and leaks in the stucco walls and tile roof, pavement repairs, restroom upgrades, repainting of the building exterior, restoration of the original 1926 wood doors and windows, replacement and relocation of the air conditioning system to the roof of the building (which allowed the original entrance on the side of the building to be reopened), and the installation of a wheelchair ramp from the parking lot to the new station entrance. Work officially commenced on September 24, 2014 and was completed on June 29, 2015. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2022.

The station also serves Amtrak Thruway buses and Lynx bus route 40. It is also the proposed terminus on the planned Orange Blossom Express commuter rail project out of Lake County.

<text>Aromata (Greek: Αρώματα, lit. &quot;spices, aromatics&quot;), also called the Spice Port, was an ancient seaport and emporium in the Horn of Africa, today a part of Somalia. It lay near the tip of Cape Guardafui, which was itself called the &quot;promontory of spices&quot; (&quot;Aromaton akron&quot;, Αρώματον ἄκρον). It was notable for its produce of resins and various herbs.

==Location==
It is to be identified with Damo, a site protected on the south but exposed on the north. British archaeologist Neville Chittick discovered Roman pottery near Damo, confirming the identification. Previously, G. W. B. Huntingford had identified with Olok (Olog), which is to the west.

==Descriptions==
According to the 1st-century &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot;, the &quot;port of spices&quot; (&quot;Aromaton emporion&quot;, Ἀρωμάτων ἐμπόριον) had a roadstead or anchorage (&quot;hormos&quot;) in the land of the Barbaroi. It was one of the &quot;far side&quot; ports that lay in a line along the north Somali coast. They were &quot;far&quot; because they came after Adulis and beyond the strait of Bab-el-Mandeb. Merchants left Egypt in July to reach them. Aromata was the sixth port after Zeyla (&quot;Aualites&quot;), Berbera (&quot;Malao&quot;), Heis (&quot;Moundou&quot;), Bandar Kasim (&quot;Mosullon&quot;) and Bandar Alula (&quot;Akannai&quot;). It could occasionally be dangerous to ships.

According to the 2nd-century &quot;Geography&quot; of Ptolemy, a merchant named Diogenes, returning from India, was driven south by a north wind as he approached Aromata. He sailed for 25 days with the coast of the Troglodytae on his right (west) almost as far as Rhapta in Azania. Citing Marinus of Tyre, Ptolemy adds that a merchant named Theophilos sailed from Rhapta to Aromata in twenty days with a south wind blowing. Ptolemy emphasises that these were single sailings and he does not know the average number of days to sail between Aromata and Rhapta. He places Aromata 6°N, while Marinus places it 4.25°N. He cites a certain Dioskoros for the location of Cape Prason, the southernmost point the Greeks reached in Africa, being &quot;many days&quot; beyond Rhapta. He then estimates the distance from Aromata to Cape Prason as 20.67° of latitude. Ptolemy also says that he has heard from traders that the direction from Arabia Felix to Aromata is southwest not due south. He places Aromata on the Gulf of Aden and not in the Indian Ocean.

Aromata, like all other ports on the Gulf of Aden, was independent and ruled by its own chief. Its major exports were frankincense and all grades of cassia (&quot;gizeir&quot;, &quot;asuphe&quot;, &quot;magla&quot; and &quot;moto&quot;). It may have served as a major transshipment port for goods coming from India and Southeast Asia, the latter being the main source for cassia. It also exported grain, rice, sesame oil and cotton cloth. According to the &quot;Periplus&quot;, a ship warned at Aromata of an approaching storm on the Indian Ocean could take refuge at Tabai (Chori Hordio), two days&#x27; sailing and on the other side of the cape.

==Land of Aromatics==
The &quot;Monumentum Adulitanum&quot; is a third-century monumental inscription by an anonymous King of Axum recording his various victories in war. It is lost, but its text was copied down in the 6th century by Cosmas Indicopleustes in his &quot;Christian Topography&quot;. It describes the King&#x27;s conquest of a country towards the east as the &quot;Land of Aromatics&quot;, also translated &quot;Land of Incense&quot; or &quot;Frankincense Country&quot;:

I am the first and only of the kings my predecessors to have subdued all these peoples by the grace given me by my mighty god Ares Maḥrem], who also engendered me. It is through him that I have submitted to my power all the peoples neighbouring my empire, in the east to the Land of Aromatics, to the west to the land of Ethiopia Kush] and the Sasou [?Sesea]; some I fought myself, against others I sent my armies.

Paul Henze takes this to refer to the whole of the &quot;dry coastal region, a major source of incense&quot; from the lowlands of what is today Eritrea through Somalia and perhaps even a part of South Arabia. Yuzo Shitomi suggests that it may in fact have been Ḥaḍramawt in South Arabia. L. P. Kirwan distinguishes two lands of incense: that of the &quot;Monumentum Adulitanum&quot; (which he places in South Arabia) and that of the &quot;Christian Topography&quot; itself (which is the Aromata of the &quot;Periplus&quot; and Ptolemy).

<text>The 1948 United States Senate elections were held concurrently with the election of Democratic President Harry S. Truman for a full term. The 32 seats of Class 2 were contested in regular elections, and one special election was held to fill a vacancy. Truman campaigned against an &quot;obstructionist&quot; Congress that had blocked many of his initiatives, and additionally, the U.S. economy recovered from the postwar recession of 1946–1947 by election day. Thus, Truman was rewarded with a Democratic gain of nine seats in the Senate, enough to give them control of the chamber. This was the last time until 2020 that Democrats flipped a chamber of Congress in a presidential election cycle.

Democrat Bert H. Miller defeated incumbent Republican Henry Dworshak. As of 2024, this remains the only time that a Democrat would win Idaho&#x27;s Class 2 Senate seat. Dworshak was appointed back to this seat in October 1949 after Miller died earlier that month and served until he himself died in 1962.

Incumbent United States Senator James E. Murray, who was first elected to the Senate in a special election in 1934 and was re-elected in 1936 and 1942, ran for re-election. After winning the Democratic primary, he faced Tom J. Davis, an attorney and the Republican nominee, in the general election. Following a narrow re-election in 1936, Murray significantly expanded his margin of victory and comfortably won re-election over Davis, winning his fourth term and his third full term in the Senate.

There were 2 elections to the same seat, due to the December 15, 1946 death of three-term Democrat Josiah Bailey. Democratic former congressman William B. Umstead was appointed December 18, 1946 to continue Bailey&#x27;s term, pending a special election.

Umstead supported the conservative Taft–Hartley Act. The Democratic former Governor of North Carolina J. Melville Broughton was seen as a &quot;rather liberal alternative&quot; to Umstead. Broughton beat Umstead in the Democratic primaries and then won the general elections.

Broughton was seated December 31, 1948 to finish the current term but died March 6, 1949, just after the new term began. His death lead to another appointment (Democrat Frank Graham) in 1949 and another special election in 1950 of Democrat Willis Smith. Smith also died during the term, leading to yet another appointment (Democrat Alton A. Lennon) and 1954 special election (of Democrat W. Kerr Scott). In all, five senators held the seat during the 1949–1955 term.

Senator Burnet R. Maybank was opposed in the Democratic primary by U.S. Representative William Jennings Bryan Dorn and three other candidates. Maybank obtained over 50% in the primary election on August 10 to avoid a runoff election.


Since the end of Reconstruction in 1877, the Democratic Party dominated the politics of South Carolina and its statewide candidates were never seriously challenged. Maybank did not campaign for the general election as there was no chance of defeat.

Incumbent Democrat W. Lee O&#x27;Daniel decided to retire rather than seek a second full term. Congressman Lyndon Johnson won the highly contested Democratic primary against former governor Coke Stevenson. Johnson went on to win the general election against Republican Jack Porter, but by a closer margin than usual for Texas Democrats.

Incumbent Democrat A. Willis Robertson defeated Republican Robert H. Woods and was re-elected to his first full term in office.

==Etymology==
Both the German name &quot;Trautenau&quot; and the Czech name &quot;Trutnov&quot; are derived from the Old German &quot;truten ouwe&quot;, which meant &quot;cute floodplain&quot;.

==Geography==

Trutnov is located about north of Hradec Králové. A negligible part of the municipal territory borders Poland. Most of the territory of Trutnov lies in the Giant Mountains Foothills, but it also extends to the Broumov Highlands on the east and a small northern part extends into the Giant Mountains. The highest point is a contour line on the slopes of the Dvorský les Mountain at above sea level. The town proper is situated in the valley of the Úpa River.

==History==
The first written mention of Trutnov is from 1260. It was founded around 1250 by the Švábenský of Švábenice noble family and originally named Úpa after the eponymous river. In 1301, King Wenceslaus II bought the whole area, already called Trutnov. From 1400 to 1599, Trutnov was a dowry town of the Bohemian queens. In 1421, the town was captured by Jan Žižka during the Hussite Wars.

Trutnov was the site of the Battle of Trautenau in 1866 during the Austro-Prussian War.

During the World War II, the German occupiers operated three forced labour camps for Jewish women, located in Horní Staré Město, Poříčí and Libeč, which all became subcamps of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp in March 1944, and a forced labour subcamp of the Stalag VIII-B/344 prisoner-of-war camp for Allied POWs in Libeč. After the war, the remaining German population was expelled in 1945 in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement.

==Demographics==
==Economy==

The largest employers based in the town are Vitesco Technologies Czech Republic and Tyco Electronics EC Trutnov, both manufacturers of electrical equipment for automotive industry with more than 1,000 employees. The largest non-industrial employer is the Trutnov hospital.

The Krakonoš Brewery was founded in 1582 and is one of the oldest breweries in the country.

==Transport==
Trutnov is the terminus of an interregional railway line from Prague. There are also railway lines heading from Trutnov to Kolín and Vrchlabí.

==Sport==

The ice hockey team HC Trutnov is based in the town.

There is a slalom course on the Úpa river in Trutnov. The &quot;Trutnovské slalomy&quot; competition is held here every year since 1965.

==Culture==
Trutnov has hosted the Trutnov Open Air Music Festival since 1990 and, since 1999, has hosted Obscene Extreme.

==Sights==

The historic core comprises the area of Vnitřní Město part of Trutnov, with Krakonoš Square (&quot;Krakonošovo náměstí&quot;) in its centre. The area was delimited by town walls in the 14th century. Their fragments are preserved to this day. The landmark of the square is the neo-Gothic Old Town Hall, nowadays the tourist information centre. In the middle of the square are a statue of Joseph II, a stone fountain with statue of Krakonoš, and the baroque Holy Trinity Column from 1704.

The most valuable buildings of Trutnov are the three churches. Church of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary is a Neoclassical building with late Baroque elements from 1756–1782. The Church of Saint Wenceslaus in Horní Staré Město part of Trutnov is first documented already in 1313. In 1581, it was rebuilt in the Renaissance style, and a tower was added. The neo-Gothic Church of Saints Peter and Paul was built in 1897–1903 and is located in Poříčí.

<text>Delphic were an alternative dance band from Manchester, England. They are signed to Polydor but released their first single &quot;Counterpoint&quot;, produced by Ewan Pearson, in April 2009 through R&amp;S Records.

In 2009, the band toured the UK music festival circuit, playing at T in the Park, Reading and Leeds Festivals, and Creamfields, among others.

The EP for &quot;This Momentary&quot; was released on 31 August 2009 through Kitsuné. The music video was nominated for three UK Music Video Awards, including Best Cinematography, Best Editing and Best Telecine. In November 2009, they made their first TV appearance appearing on &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot; playing &quot;Doubt&quot; and &quot;Halcyon&quot;.

Delphic were one of the 15 shortlisted music acts for the BBC Sound of 2010 as announced on 7 December 2009. When the winners were announced in early 2010, it was revealed that the band had placed third on BBC Sound of 2010, after Ellie Goulding and Marina and the Diamonds.

&quot;Acolyte&quot; was released in Australia and New Zealand on 22 January 2010 via Modular and in the United States on 29 June 2010 via Dangerbird Records.
&quot;Collections&quot;, the band&#x27;s second album, was released on 28 January 2013.

Delphic collaborated with Manchester International Festival in July 2013, performing a three night exclusive residency at the festival, re-working their entire album &quot;Collections&quot; with an array of instruments from around the world, played by musicians from the UK. The event series was entitled &#x27;Our Worldly Collections&#x27;.

Richard Boardman has now gone on to start a Manchester-based songwriting collective known as The Six who have most recently written on the Louis Tomlinson and Bebe Rexha single &quot;Back To You.&quot;

==History==
===&quot;Acolyte&quot; (2010)===
Announced on Delphic&#x27;s website on 2 November 2009, their debut album was called &quot;Acolyte&quot; and released on Polydor on the band&#x27;s own imprint Chimeric Records on 11 January 2010. Reviewing for BBC Music, writer Lou Thomas commented that it &quot;might just be the first great album of 2010&quot;. Acolyte was also described as &quot;on kissing terms with magnificence&quot; by Simon Price of the Independent. The singles released from &quot;Acolyte&quot; were &quot;Doubt&quot;, &quot;Halcyon&quot;, and &quot;Counterpoint&quot;, the latter of which was re-released later on Chimeric.

&quot;Counterpoint&quot; was used as one of the theme songs for Sky Sports&#x27; coverage of the Premier League in the 2010–11 season, and also is one of the songs included in the playlist of &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer 2010&quot;.

The song &quot;Red Lights&quot; has been featured on the new E4 advert for &quot;90210&quot;.

The song &quot;Halcyon&quot; has been featured nationwide on the new advert for the Samsung Monte mobile phone.

The first song from the album, &quot;Clarion Call&quot;, features in the F1 2010 video game by Codemasters, the video game &quot;Saint&#x27;s Row: The Third&quot;, and is used by Sky Sports as theme music for International Cricket highlights programmes.

After a sold out UK tour in early January 2010 with pop noir band Mirrors, the band set tour dates for a second and third run of the UK in March and May.

The band were also nominated for the &quot;Best UK &amp; Ireland New Act&quot; in the 2010 MTV EMAs in Madrid.

===&quot;Collections&quot; (2013)===
In an April 2012 interview with &quot;NME&quot;, Boardman said the band had been working on material for their second album over the course of 18 months and had been working with producers Ben Allen (Bombay Bicycle Club) and DFA Records co-founder Tim Goldsworthy. In the article, he noted their and Goldsworthy&#x27;s shared affinity for contemporary R&amp;B, which suggests a possible shift in direction on the new album.

In an interview on the unofficial Delphic Fansite, Boardman confirmed the release dates for the first single and the follow-up to 2010&#x27;s &quot;Acolyte&quot; would be &quot;soon&quot;. The album&#x27;s title and song titles remain unknown, though Boardman revealed there was a song with a working title of &quot;Bhangra&quot; that has since been renamed.

BBC News reported on 28 June 2012 that Delphic, alongside Muse, Elton John vs. Pnau, Dizzee Rascal, and The Chemical Brothers, would be releasing one of the five official songs of the 2012 Summer Olympics taking place in London, United Kingdom. In line with a previous report by international news agency Reuters, Delphic&#x27;s single was released on 23 July 2012 on Polydor.

&quot;Good Life,&quot; Delphic&#x27;s London 2012 Olympics single, premiered as the &quot;Hottest Record in the World&quot; feature of Zane Lowe&#x27;s evening Radio 1 programme on 18 July 2012. In an interview with Lowe directly following the song&#x27;s worldwide premiere, guitarist Matt Cocksedge explained their management had submitted a demo of &quot;Good Life&quot; without the band&#x27;s knowledge, until it was revealed to them later that it had been chosen as one of the official singles of the 2012 Summer Olympics. Rick Boardman went on to say that the album has a planned early 2013 release.

When asked by UK music blog There Goes the Fear whether &quot;Good Life&quot; was a good example of their yet to be released material, singer/bassist James Cook stated that the new single was &quot;&quot;...closer to the Acolyte material than any of the other new tunes. It is &quot;representative more of&quot; [the] &quot;mood&quot; [of the new material], &quot;not&quot; [its] &quot;musical direction.&quot;&quot;.

On 15 August 2012, Delphic announced they would be previewing the new album material on a UK tour taking place October and November 2012. The band performed 3 new songs live for the first time at Free Form Festival 2012 in Warsaw, Poland – &quot;Baiya&quot;, &quot;Memeo&quot; and &quot;Atlas&quot;. On the UK Tour they debuted another new song named &quot;Changes&quot;.

The first details of the new album, &quot;Collections&quot;, surfaced on 1 November 2012 on Delphic&#x27;s website which coincide with the final day of Delphic tour in autumn 2012. The band posted &quot;Introducing &#x27;Collections&quot;&#x27;, a sample of the new album on VEVO on 31 October 2012, in which new songs &quot;Baiya&quot;, &quot;Memeo&quot; and &quot;Atlas&quot; were featured.

Delphic unveiled the first single taken from their new album – titled &quot;Baiya&quot; – in November. The track is currently streaming online.

===&quot;Get Familiar (mixtape)&quot; (2014)===
On 22 April 2014, the band posted a seven track mixtape called &#x27;Get Familiar&#x27; on their SoundCloud page.

=== The Six (2014) ===
Also in 2014, Rick Boardman started a Manchester-based songwriting collective known as The Six. Later that year, The Six were featured on the Gorgon City track &quot;Take It All&quot; and then supported them on a UK tour. He has 31 registered songs to his name, and has also worked on the 2014 single &quot;Real Love&quot; by Clean Bandit and Jess Glynne, which peaked at 2 in the UK singles chart and number 2 in Germany. Boardman continues to lead The Six who have more recently written on the Louis Tomlinson and Bebe Rexha single &quot;Back to You” and Galantis single &quot;Love on Me”.
