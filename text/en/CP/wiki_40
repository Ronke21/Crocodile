<text>The New York–style bagel is the original style of bagel available in the United States, originating from the Jewish community of New York City, and can trace its origins to the bagels made by the Ashkenazi Jews of Poland.

A traditional New York-style is typically larger and fatter than a mass-produced bagel, or a wood-fired Montreal-style bagel. They have also grown over time, from about in 1915 to in 2003.

==History==

As Jewish refugees from Poland and Eastern Europe began to arrive in New York City en masse in the 1800s, they brought their traditional foods with them such as challah, brisket, knishes, and bagels. For many decades, bagels were little known outside of the Jewish community, where their popularity was widespread. Bagels became so popular among the Jewish community of New York, that unions were formed to represent bagel bakers in the city, such as Bagel Bakers Local 338, which by the early 1910s represented over 300 bagel craftsman in Manhattan.

New York–style bagels are the original bagel available in the United States. Although various cities spanning the globe have their own distinct style of cooking and serving bagels, the concept of the bagel originated on the Lower East Side, in Manhattan, New York. The bagel was created as a filling, tasty, inexpensive treat for Jewish immigrants living in Manhattan in the 1800s. The bagel quickly spread around New York City, across the United States, and was soon adapted in various forms across the world. The idea of a bagel in its modern-day form is native to New York City, particularly the Jewish community there.

Beginning in the 1960s, the popularity of the New York–style bagel began to increase with the non-Jewish population of New York City and beyond. Over the decades the size of the New York–style bagel increased from around 3 ounces to the more commonly found 6 ounces sizes today.

==Texture and flavor==

Many people claim the main difference in taste and texture of a real New York bagel compared to other styles of bagels is due to the use of New York City tap water, which contains certain minerals which they attribute to creating a better bagel. Specifically attributed are the low concentration of calcium, low concentration of magnesium, and high level of total dissolved solids found in New York City municipal water, each helping to make the water softer. Soft water has been claimed to strengthen the gluten in the bagel dough, helping to create the chewy inside and crispy outside characteristic of a New York–style bagel.

Christopher Pugliese, owner of a popular bagel shop in the East Village attributes the New York–style bagel&#x27;s signature taste to &quot;100% the water&quot;. The use of New York City water in a bagel has been compared to the terroir of grape varietals used to make champagne.

Conversely, Peter Shelsky, co-owner of Shelsky&#x27;s Brooklyn Bagels firmly believes that it is not the water. According to Mr. Shelsky, &quot;New Jersey and Long Island, both are dotted with fantastic NY style bagels. Both New Jersey and Long Island have different water supplies, and that water has vastly different composition to that of New York City proper. A great bagel with the right texture can be made anywhere. It&#x27;s not the water. It&#x27;s the know-how.&quot;

However, the use of New York tap water in the bagel-making process may not be the only reason for the difference in texture and flavor in a NY bagel compared to other styles of bagel, according to Josh Polack, owner of a bagel shop in Denver, Colorado which tries to mimic the water used in New York–style bagels:

==Preparation==
A New York–style bagel is always boiled in water that has had barley malt added, which gives a bagel its signature taste, texture, and leathery skin. The bagels are then traditionally topped with sesame seeds, poppy seeds, dried onion or garlic, or everything bagel seasoning, or are left plain or brushed with an egg wash. While these are the traditional flavors of NY style bagels, newer sweet flavors such as cinnamon-raisin are also available, having originated in the 1950s and 1960s. These sweeter flavors have been criticized by some New Yorkers and members of the Jewish community, some of whom call the sweeter flavors a &quot;&quot;.

The bagels are then loaded onto burlap-covered cedar or pine boards which have been wetted down with water, or sometimes coated with cornmeal or semolina, and are then baked in the oven. Halfway through the cooking process, the baker takes the boards and flips the bagels over and removes the boards from the oven. The bagels are then removed and allowed to cool.

==Serving==
A fresh New York–style bagel is traditionally never toasted. Some New York City bagel shops, like Murray&#x27;s in Chelsea and Ess-a-Bagel at 21st and Third Avenue, have had no-toasting policies. Toasting of bagels in New York City is considered a bastardization and sacrilege. Former New York Times food critic Mimi Sheraton called the practice of eating toasted bagels obscene. 

===Bagel with lox and schmear===

According to Jewish culinary historian Gil Marks, the Jewish community in New York City developed the bagel with lox and in the 1930s as a kosher adaption of eggs benedict, which Jewish people are unable to eat due to eggs Benedict both containing pork and mixing dairy and meat (both of which are violations of kashrut, Jewish dietary law). This was unique to the Jews of New York City, as Jewish communities in Poland had traditionally spread schmaltz on their bagels, or had eaten them with cholent, or other various soups and as a dinner roll.

<text>Christophe Léon Louis Juchault de Lamoricière (5 September 1806 – 11 September 1865) was a French general.

==Early life==
Juchault de Lamoricière was born in Nantes. He studied at the École Polytechnique and the École d&#x27;Application.

== Service ==
He was commissioned a sub-lieutenant in the Engineers in 1828.

=== In Algeria ===
He served in the Algerian campaigns from 1830 onwards, being made a captain of Zouaves. By 1840, Juchault de Lamoricière had risen to the grade of &quot;maréchal-de-camp&quot; (major-general). Three years later he was made a general of division. He was one of the most distinguished and efficient of Bugeaud&#x27;s generals, rendering special service at Isly (14 August 1844). He acted temporarily as governor-general of Algeria, and finally effected the capture of Abd-el-Kader in 1847.

Juchault de Lamoricière played a part in the political events of 1848, both as a member of the Chamber of Deputies and as a military commander. Under the regime of General Cavaignac he was for a time minister of war (28 June – 20 December 1848).

=== In the French Second Republic ===
From 1848 to 1851 Juchault de Lamoricière was one of the most conspicuous opponents of the policies of Louis Napoleon, and following the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of 2 December 1851 he was arrested and exiled. Juchault de Lamoricière refused to give his allegiance to the new Emperor Napoleon III.

=== In service to the Pope ===
In 1860 he accepted command of the papal army, which he led in the Italian campaign of 1860. On 18 September that year, he was severely defeated by the Italian army at Castelfidardo.

=== Retirement ===
His last years were spent in complete retirement in France where he had been allowed to return in 1857.

== Death and tomb ==
He died at Prouzel (Somme) in 1865. His tomb at Nantes Cathedral, designed by Paul Dubois, was completed in 1875.

<doc id="1330114" wikidata="Q3925975" url="?curid=1330114" title="Purple Hearts (British band)">
<text>Purple Hearts are an English mod revival band, formed in 1977 in Romford, eastern Greater London. They were often considered one of the best English mod revival groups, the &quot;NME&quot; calling them &quot;one of the few mod bands to actually cut it on rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll terms&quot;.

==Career==
Purple Hearts started in 1977, when teenagers Jeff Shadbolt, Simon Stebbing, Bob Manton, and Nick Lake formed the band in Romford as The Sockets, before they even knew how to play their instruments. They formed for the purpose of getting a support slot at a Buzzcocks gig at the East London Polytechnic, to debut their tongue-in-cheek rock opera, &quot;Reg&quot;.

In 1978, their drummer Nick Lake broke his leg. He was replaced by Gary Sparks from Romford punk outfit, 1348. The band switched their name to Purple Hearts, after an amphetamine-barbiturate mixture popular with the mods of the 1960s. Accordingly, they changed their sound from the rough-edged punk rock, to a more mod-influenced sound, which, thanks largely to The Jam, was beginning to capture public attention. In September 1979, the band scored a minor hit with their debut single, &quot;Millions Like Us&quot; which reached number 57 in the UK Singles Chart. The band then toured the UK with Secret Affair and Back To Zero on &#x27;the march of the mods&#x27; tour in 1979. The band&#x27;s second single, &quot;Frustration&quot; was released in November that year. A tour of the UK to promote the single followed.

In 1980, the band released their debut album, &quot;Beat That!&quot;. The album was produced by Chris Parry of Fiction Records. The single taken from the album, &quot;Jimmy&quot;, gave the band another minor hit reaching number 60 in the UK chart in March 1980. After the commercial failure of &quot;Beat That&quot;, the band parted company with Fiction Records, before signing a one-off single deal with Safari which produced the &quot;My Life`s A Jigsaw&quot; single, produced by Andy Arthurs. The record did make the BBC Radio One playlist, but did not make the national charts. A final single, &quot;Plane Crash&quot; was released in 1982, on the independent record label Roadrunner Records before the band split up in November of that year after a failed American trip.

After the Hearts, Jeff Shadbolt joined The Rage, who included Brett Ascott from The Chords. Gary Sparks joined High Zierra with former members of Department S, Tony Lourdan, Mark Taylor and Michael Herbage. Simon Stebbing joined Hearts on Fire who recorded an album &quot;Dreams of Leaving&quot; and two EPs for Midnite Records. Bob Manton joined Simon Stebbing and Peter Green in cosmic country rockers Owen and the Deacons.

Purple Hearts resurfaced in 1984 to release a live album, &quot;Head on Collision Time&quot; (1985) recorded live at the 100 Club, and their second studio effort, &quot;Popish Frenzy&quot; (1986). A single &quot;Friends Again&quot; taken from this album was released on Unicorn Records. In 1986 the group toured West Germany, Austria and The Netherlands before once again calling it a day. They re-convened at the Mods Mayday &#x27;99 show, recorded for the Detour Records live compilation album. In 2003, Stebbing produced a rarities compilation, &quot;Smashing Time&quot;, also released on Detour Records.

In 2000 Stebbing formed RT4 with Gary along with Mike Herbage and Mark Taylor from Department S, they gigged for 5 years. Simon then went on to form Speakeasy with Mark Le Gallez (the Risk and Thee Jenerators) after an initial EP on Biff Bang Pow Records, with guests Fay Hallam (Makin Time) on Hammond organ and the late Mike Evans (the Action / Mighty Baby) on bass, Speakeasy released a self-titled album on Detour Records in 2010, then Trouble their second LP released on Twist records in 2014 with Ian Jones (The Affair / Long Tall Shorty) as new bassist. Speakeasy continue to play occasional shows, and started recording a third album in 2016. In 2008 Bob Manton reappeared fronting the short lived Norwich garage band The Alley Jaggers.

The band re-formed in 2009 and played all over the UK and Europe including Dublin, Vienna and Madrid. They continued playing from 2009 to 2014. The band released a new live album from the 2009 tour in April 2010 called &quot;Purple Hearts Live!&quot; with Pride and Joy Records. This included the band&#x27;s first new material in 25 years with the track &quot;Urban Soul&quot;.

<text>José Antonio Navarro (February 27, 1795 – January 13, 1871) was a Texas statesman, revolutionary, rancher, and merchant. The son of Ángel Navarro and Josefa María Ruiz y Peña, he was born into a distinguished noble family at San Antonio de Béxar in the Viceroyalty of New Spain (now the American city of San Antonio, Texas). His uncle was José Francisco Ruiz and his brother-in-law was Juan Martín de Veramendi.

Navarro County, Texas, established in 1846, is named in his honor, as is the small town of Navarro, Texas.

==Early life and career==
Navarro was proficient in the laws of Mexico and Spain, although he was mainly self-educated. As a native Texan, he had a vision of the future of Texas like that of Stephen F. Austin. Austin and he developed a steady friendship, and worked together to find the new state of Texas. An early proponent of Texas independence, he took part in the 1812–1813 Magee, Gutiérrez, and Toledo resistance movement.

Working with the &quot;empresarios&quot; of the period, he helped Austin obtain his contracts to bring settlers into the area. He became a land commissioner for Dewitt&#x27;s Colony, and soon after, for the Béxar District. In 1825, he married Margarita de la Garza and they raised seven children. His son José Ángel Navarro III served three terms in the Texas Legislature.

During the early 1830s, Navarro represented Texas both in the legislature of the state of Coahuila y Tejas and in the federal Congress in Mexico City. Always a champion of democratic ideas, Navarro, collaborating with Austin, worked to pass legislation that would best benefit the people of Texas.

Navarro later served as a leader in the Texas Revolution. He was at the Convention for Texas Independence, when he received the news from Juan Seguin of the Alamo&#x27;s fall. With the death of James Bowie (his nephew by marriage), Navarro had to secure the release of the surviving Navarros, two women and a child, who were being held by the Mexicans at the Músquiz house. They were removed to the Navarro family home. The surviving noncombatants thereby avoided humiliation or death from General Antonio López de Santa Anna.

José Antonio Navarro was one of the first signers of the Texas Declaration of Independence, in early March, 1836, in Washington-on-the-Brazos. He later signed the Constitution of the Republic of Texas.
In 1841, Navarro reluctantly participated in the ill-conceived Texan Santa Fe Expedition sent by President Mirabeau B. Lamar, when he tried to persuade the residents of New Mexico to secede from Mexico and join with Texas. He was captured, put on trial, sentenced to death, and imprisoned for years. He escaped with the help of sympathetic Mexican Army officials, sailing back to Texas.

José Antonio Navarro became a representative in the Republic of Texas Congress from Bexar County, Texas. Attempting to keep a balance of power, he worked closely with Senator Juan Seguin to promote legislation favorable to the Tejano citizenry, who were quickly becoming the political minority. Education was one such priority, working to bring academic institutions into the San Antonio area. He supported the annexation of Texas by the United States. In 1845, Navarro was instrumental in drafting the first state Constitution of Texas, ensuring future political rights for all people. He served two terms in the Texas Senate before retiring from politics in 1849.

==Slave ownership==
Like a number of other Tejanos, Navarro owned enslaved African Americans. Between 1856 and 1864, he owned between six and nine enslaved people. As a legislator in the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas, Navarro introduced a bill known as the &quot;Law of Contracts&quot; which allowed enslaved people to be brought to Texas as indentured servants under contract, working to pay their debt in labor to their owners. Census records indicate that as early as 1850, Navarro owned an enslaved twelve-year-old boy named Henry.

==Later life==
In his retirement, Navarro wrote several historical and political essays about Texas and San Antonio&#x27;s role in the Mexican Independence movement for the &quot;San Antonio Ledger&quot;.

Ranching occupied much of his time in later years, and he spent most of each spring, summer, and fall on the San Geronimo Ranch, rich grasslands near Seguin, Texas, about 35 miles east of San Antonio.


Navarro later sold his ranch and lived full-time in San Antonio, where he died in 1871.

==Legacy==
In 1846, the Texas Legislature named Navarro County south of Dallas to honor his service. In 1848, Navarro County&#x27;s seat of government was founded, and José Navarro selected the name, Corsicana, for the town.

A state historical marker identifies his Geronimo Creek Ranch in South Texas. Navarro Street in downtown San Antonio is also named for him.

Casa Navarro State Historic Site in San Antonio is the original residence complex of José Antonio Navarro. He first bought the property, about 1.5 acres, in 1832 (during the Mexican Texas period. The structures of limestone, caliche block, and adobe were built over the next 20 years or so. The site is situated in the heart of old San Antonio. The buildings were acquired and restored by the San Antonio Conservation Society, and the complex, including his one-story limestone home, kitchen, and a two-story store and offices, was opened to the public in October 1997.

<text>Allemande sauce or sauce parisienne is a sauce in French cuisine based on a light-colored velouté sauce (typically veal; chicken and shellfish veloutés can also be used), but thickened with egg yolks and heavy cream, and seasoned with lemon juice. Allemande was one of the five mother sauces of classic French cuisine as defined by Antoine Carême in &quot;The Art of French Cooking in the 19th Century.&quot; 

Escoffier perfected the &quot;sauce allemande&quot; (&#x27;German sauce&#x27;) in the early 20th century. At the outbreak of World War I, he renamed it &quot;sauce parisienne&quot;. Some American cookbooks define a completely different &quot;sauce parisienne&quot; consisting of cream cheese whipped together with oil and citrus juices, which they also call &quot;cream cheese mayonnaise&quot;.

<doc id="1330137" wikidata="Q423712" url="?curid=1330137" title="Factor XIII">
<text>Factor XIII, or fibrin stabilizing factor, is a plasma protein and zymogen. It is activated by thrombin to factor XIIIa which crosslinks fibrin in coagulation. Deficiency of XIII worsens clot stability and increases bleeding tendency.

Human XIII is a heterotetramer. It consists of 2 enzymatic A peptides and 2 non-enzymatic B peptides. XIIIa is a dimer of activated A peptides.

== Function ==
Within blood, thrombins cleave fibrinogens to fibrins during coagulation and a fibrin-based blood clot forms. Factor XIII is a transglutaminase that circulates in human blood as a heterotetramer of two A and two B subunits. Factor XIII binds to the clot via their B units. In the presence of fibrins, thrombin efficiently cleaves the R37–G38 peptide bond of each A unit within a XIII tetramer. A units release their N-terminal activation peptides.

Both of the non-covalently bound B units are now able to dissociate from the tetramer with the help of calcium ions (Ca2+) in the blood; these ions also activate the remaining dimer of two A units via a conformational change.

Factor XIIIa (dimer of two active A units) crosslinks fibrins within the clot by forming isopeptide bonds between various glutamines and lysines of the fibrins. These bonds make the clot physically more durable and protect it from premature enzymatic degradation (fibrinolysis).

In humans, plasmin, antithrombin and TFPI are the most relevant proteolytic inhibitors of the active factor XIIIa. α2-macroglobulin is a significant non-proteolytic inhibitor.
==Genetics==
Human factor XIII consist of A and B subunits. A subunit gene is &quot;F13A1&quot;. It is on chromosome 6 at the position 6p24–25. It spans over 160 kbp, has 14 introns and 15 exons. Its mRNA is 3.9 kbp. It has a 5&#x27; UTR of 84 bp and a 3&#x27; UTR of 1.6 kbp. &quot;F13A1&quot; exon(s)

*1 code 5&#x27; UTR
*2 code activation peptide
*2–4 code β-sandwich
*4–12 code catalytic domain
*12–13 code β-barrel 1
*13–15 code β-barrel 2

B subunit gene is &quot;F13B&quot;. It is on chromosome 1 at the position 1q31–32.1. It spans 28 kpb, has 11 introns and 12 exons. Its mRNA is 2.2 kbp. Exon 1 codes 5&#x27; UTR. Exons 2–12 code the 10 different sushi domains.

== Structure ==
Factor XIII of human blood is a heterotetramer of two A and two B linear polypeptides or &quot;units&quot;. A units are potentially catalytic; B units are not. A units form a dimeric center. Non-covalently bound B units form a ring-like structure around the center. B units are removed when XIII is activated to XIIIa. Dimers containing only A units also occur within cells such as platelets. Large quantities of singular B units (monomers) also occur within blood. These dimers and monomers are not known to participate in coagulation, whereas the tetramers do.

A units have a mass of about 83 kDa, 731 amino acid residues, 5 protein domains (listed from the N-terminal to C-terminal, residue numbers are in brackets):

*activation peptide (1–37) 
*β-sandwich (38–184) 
*catalytic domain (185–515), in which the residues C314, H373, D396 and W279 partake in catalysis 
*β-barrel 1 (516–628) 
*β-barrel 2 (629–731)

B units are glycoproteins. Each has a mass of about 80 kDa (8.5% of the mass is from carbohydrates), 641 residues and 10 sushi domains. Each domain has about 60 residues and 2 internal disulfide bonds.

==Physiology==
A subunits of human factor XIII are made primarily by platelets and other cells of bone marrow origin. B subunits are secreted into blood by hepatocytes. A and B units combine within blood to form heterotetramers of two A units and two B units. Blood plasma concentration of the heterotetramers is 14–48 mg/L and half-life is 9–14 days.

A clot that has not been stabilized by FXIIIa is soluble in 5 mol/L urea, while a stabilized clot is resistant to this phenomenon.

==Factor XIII deficiency==
Factor XIII deficiency, while generally rare, does occur, with Iran having the highest global incidence of the disorder with 473 cases. The city of Khash, located in Sistan and Balochistan provinces, has the highest incidence in Iran, with a high rate of consanguineous marriage.

==Diagnostic use==
Factor XIII levels are not measured routinely, but may be considered in patients with an unexplained bleeding tendency. As the enzyme is quite specific for monocytes and macrophages, determination of the presence of factor XIII may be used to identify and classify malignant diseases involving these cells.

==Discovery==
Factor XIII Deficiency is also known as Laki–Lorand factor, after Kalman Laki and Laszlo Lorand, the scientists who first proposed its existence in 1948. A 2005 conference recommended standardization of nomenclature.

<doc id="1330139" wikidata="Q1694882" url="?curid=1330139" title="USS Cyclops">
<text>USS &quot;Cyclops&quot; (AC-4) was the second of four &quot;Proteus&quot;-class colliers built for the United States Navy several years before World War I. Named after the Cyclops, a race of giants from Greek mythology, she was the second U.S. naval vessel to bear the name. The loss of the ship and 306 crew and passengers without a trace occurred sometime after 4 March 1918.

As the loss occurred during World War I, she was thought to have been captured or sunk by a German raider or submarine because she was carrying of manganese ore used to produce munitions, but German authorities at the time subsequently denied any knowledge of the vessel. The Naval History &amp; Heritage Command has stated she &quot;probably sank in an unexpected storm&quot;, but the cause of the ship&#x27;s loss is not known.

==History==
&quot;Cyclops&quot; was launched on 7 May 1910, by William Cramp &amp; Sons of Philadelphia and placed in service on 7 November 1910. Operating with the Naval Auxiliary Service, Atlantic Fleet, she voyaged in the Baltic from May to July 1911 to supply Second Division ships. Returning to Norfolk, Virginia, she operated on the east coast from Newport, Rhode Island, to the Caribbean, servicing the fleet. During the United States occupation of Veracruz in Mexico in 1914 and 1915, she coaled ships on patrol there and received the thanks of the U.S. Department of State for cooperation in evacuating refugees.

With American entry into World War I, &quot;Cyclops&quot; was commissioned on 1 May 1917. She joined a convoy for Saint-Nazaire, France, in June 1917, returning to the U.S. in July. Except for a voyage to Halifax, Nova Scotia, she served along the East Coast until 9 January 1918, when she was assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service. She then sailed to Brazilian waters to fuel British ships in the South Atlantic, receiving the thanks of the U.S. State Department and Commander-in-Chief, Pacific.

===Disappearance===
The ship put to sea from Rio de Janeiro on 16 February 1918, and entered Salvador on 20 February. Two days later, she departed for Baltimore, Maryland, with no stops scheduled, carrying the manganese ore. The ship was thought to be overloaded when she left Brazil, as her maximum capacity was . Before leaving port, Commander Worley had submitted a report that the starboard engine had a cracked cylinder and was not operative. This report was confirmed by a survey board, which recommended, however, that the ship be returned to the United States. She made an unscheduled stop in Barbados because the water level was over the Plimsoll line, indicating that it was overloaded, but investigations in Rio proved the ship had been loaded and secured properly. &quot;Cyclops&quot; then set out for Baltimore on 4 March, and was rumored to have been sighted on 9 March by the molasses tanker &quot;Amolco&quot; near Virginia, but this was denied by &quot;Amolco&quot;″s captain. Additionally, because &quot;Cyclops&quot; was not due in Baltimore until 13 March, the ship was highly unlikely to have been near Virginia on 9 March, as that location would have placed her only about a day from Baltimore. In any event, &quot;Cyclops&quot; never arrived in Baltimore, and no wreckage of the ship has ever been found.&lt;ref name=&quot;usnsh-c/cyclops.htm&quot;&gt;USN Ships–USS Cyclops (1910–1918)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
That &quot;Cyclops&quot; was overdue and feared lost was front-page news in various American newspapers on 15 April 1918, following an announcement by the Navy.

On 1 June 1918, Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt declared &quot;Cyclops&quot; to be officially lost, and all hands deceased. The loss of &quot;Cyclops&quot; was noted in the &quot;Annual Report of the Secretary of the Navy&quot; for 1918.

One of the seamen lost aboard &quot;Cyclops&quot; was African-American mess attendant Lewis H. Hardwick, the father of Herbert Lewis Hardwick, &quot;The Cocoa Kid&quot;, an Afro-Puerto Rican welterweight boxer who was a top contender in the 1930s and 1940s, who won the world colored welterweight and world colored middleweight championships.

===Possible explanations===
As &quot;Cyclops&quot; disappeared during World War I, and submarines of the Imperial German Navy were known to operate in the West Indies, that the ship was lost due to hostile action was considered. However, the German navy denied any involvement, or having even seen &quot;Cyclops&quot;, both during and after the war.

Reports indicate that on 10 March, the day after &quot;Cyclops&quot; was rumored to have been sighted by &quot;Amolco,&quot; a violent storm swept through the Virginia Capes area. While some suggest that the combination of the overloaded condition, engine trouble, and bad weather may have conspired to sink &quot;Cyclops,&quot; an extensive naval investigation concluded: &quot;Many theories have been advanced, but none that satisfactorily accounts for her disappearance.&quot; This summation was written, however, before two of &quot;Cyclops&quot;″s sister ships, and , vanished at sea during World War II less than a year after their sale to civilian operators. Both ships were transporting heavy loads of metallic ore similar to that which was loaded on &quot;Cyclops&quot; during her fatal voyage. In both cases, their loss was theorized to have been the result of catastrophic structural failure, but a more outlandish theory attributes all three vessels&#x27; disappearances to the Bermuda Triangle.

Rear Admiral George van Deurs suggested that the loss of &quot;Cyclops&quot; could be owing to structural failure, as her sister ships suffered from issues where the I-beams that ran the length of the ship had eroded due to the corrosive nature of some of the cargo carried. This was observed definitively on , and is believed to have contributed to the sinking of another similar freighter, &quot;Chuky,&quot; which snapped in two in calm seas. Moreover, &quot;Cyclops&quot; may have hit a storm with winds. These would have resulted in waves just far enough apart to leave the bow and stern supported on the peaks of successive waves, but with the middle unsupported, resulting in extra strain on the already weakened central area.

For a BBC Radio 4 documentary in 2009, Tom Mangold had an expert from Lloyd&#x27;s investigate the loss of &quot;Cyclops.&quot; The expert noted that manganese ore, being much denser than coal, had room to move within the holds even when fully laden, the hatch covers were canvas, and that when wet, the ore can become a slurry. As such, the load could shift and cause the ship to list. Combined with a possible loss of power from its one engine, it could founder in bad weather.

==The captain==

Investigations by the Office of Naval Intelligence revealed that Captain Worley was born Johan Frederick Wichmann in Sandstedt, Hanover, Germany in 1862 (the official Navy Register lists his date of birth as 11 December 1865), and that he had entered North America by jumping ship in San Francisco in 1878. By 1898, he had changed his name to Worley (after a seaman friend), and owned and operated a saloon in San Francisco&#x27;s Barbary Coast. He also got help from brothers, whom he had convinced to emigrate. During this time, he had qualified for the position of ship&#x27;s master, and had commanded several civilian merchant ships, picking up and delivering cargo (both legal and illegal; some accounts say opium) from the Far East to San Francisco. The crews of these ships reported that Worley suffered from a personality allegedly akin to that sometimes ascribed to HMS &quot;Pandora&quot;&#x27;s captain Edward Edwards, with the crew often being brutalized by Worley for trivial things. Worley was commissioned as a lieutenant commander in the Naval Auxiliary Reserve on 21 February 1917.

Naval investigators discovered information from former crew members about Worley&#x27;s habits. He would berate and curse officers and men for minor offenses, sometimes getting violent; at one point, he had allegedly chased an ensign about the ship with a pistol. Saner times found him making his rounds about the ship dressed in long underwear and a derby hat. Worley sometimes would have an inexperienced officer take charge of loading cargo onto the ship while a more experienced man was confined to quarters. In Rio de Janeiro, one such man was assigned to oversee the loading of manganese ore, something a collier was not used to carrying, and in this instance the ship may have been overloaded, which may have contributed to her sinking. The most serious accusation against Worley was that he was pro-German in wartime and may have colluded with the enemy; indeed, his closest friends and associates were either German or Americans of German descent. &quot;Many Germanic names appear,&quot; Livingston stated, speculating that the ship had many German sympathizers on board. One of the passengers on the final voyage was Alfred Louis Moreau Gottschalk, the consul-general in Rio de Janeiro, who was as roundly hated for his pro-German sympathies, as was Worley. Livingston stated he believed Gottschalk may have been directly involved in collaborating with Worley on handing the ship over to the Germans. After World War I, German records were checked to ascertain the fate of &quot;Cyclops&quot;, whether by Worley&#x27;s hand or by submarine attack. Nothing was found.

Near the time the search for &quot;Cyclops&quot; was called off, a telegram was received by the State Department from Charles Ludlow Livingston, the U.S. consul on Barbados:
:&quot;Secretary of State&quot;
:&quot;Washington, D.C.&quot;
:&quot; 17, 2 April p.m.&quot;
:&quot;Department&#x27;s 15th. Confidential. Master CYCLOPS stated that required six hundred tons coal having sufficient on board to reach Bermuda. Engines very poor condition. Not sufficient funds and therefore requested payment by me. Unusually reticent. I have ascertained he took here ton fresh meat, ton flour, thousand pounds vegetables, paying therefore 775 dollars. From different sources gather the following: he had plenty of coal, alleged inferior, took coal to mix, probably had more than fifteen hundred tons. Master alluded to by others as damned Dutchman, apparently disliked by other officers. Rumored disturbances en route hither, men confined and one executed; also had some prisoners from the fleet in Brazilian waters, one life sentence. United States Consul-General Gottschalk passenger, 231 crew exclusive of officers and passengers. Have names of crew but not of all the officers and passengers. Many Germanic names appear. Number telegraphic or wireless messages addressed to master or in care of ship were delivered at this port. All telegrams for Barbados on file head office St. Thomas. I have to suggest scrutiny there. While not having any definite grounds I fear fate worse than sinking though possibly based on instinctive dislike felt towards master.&quot;

:&quot;LIVINGSTON, CONSUL&quot;.

Some reports attribute the telegram to Brockholst Livingston, but he was actually the 13-year-old son of the consul.

==Sister ships==
&quot;Cyclops&quot; had three sister ships, all commissioned in 1913, which were all ill-fated.

* was a military ship converted to an aircraft carrier between 1920 and 1922 and was recommissioned as . &quot;Langley&quot; was the first American aircraft carrier and was vital in developing United States naval aviation capabilities. She was converted again between 1936 and 1937 as a seaplane tender and redesignated as AV-3. She was stationed in the Philippines in December 1941 and departed for Australia following the Japanese attacks on Pearl Harbor and the Philippines. On 27 February 1942, while ferrying fighter planes to Southeast Asia, she was attacked by Japanese aircraft and was hit by five bombs, causing critical damage. After her surviving crew members were rescued, &quot;Langley&quot; was scuttled by torpedoes fired by her escorting destroyers.
* was sold on 8 March 1941, became part of the Canadian Merchant Navy, and was lost at sea without a trace, probably in or near the Caribbean Sea, sometime after 25 November 1941 with a load of bauxite ore.
* was sold to the Aluminium Company of Canada on 27 February 1941. She was lost without a trace after departing Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, sometime after 10 December 1941, with a load of bauxite ore.

==USS &quot;Cyclops&quot; in fiction==

In 1986, Clive Cussler&#x27;s Dirk Pitt novel &quot;Cyclops&quot; depicts Pitt finding the wreck of the USS &quot;Cyclops&quot;.

In the &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; episode &quot;Ghost Ship&quot; a former WW2 pilot tells Sam Beckett he was picked up by USS &quot;Cyclops&quot; when his squadron crashed during a storm in the Bermuda Triangle before itself was sunk with him as the only survivor; Al reveals the ship was from the First World War.

The ship is referenced in the 2019 horror-adventure game &quot;The Sinking City&quot;. Charles Winfield Reed, the game&#x27;s protagonist, served on the USS &quot;Cyclops&quot; as a sailor and diver before her mysterious sinking, of which he is the sole survivor. Its loss at sea is hinted to have been caused by the otherworldly events which cause Charles to see visions. The ship&#x27;s sinking and Reed&#x27;s subsequent experiences prior to the game&#x27;s beginning also closely mirror that of the unnamed protagonist of the H. P. Lovecraft short story &quot;Dagon.&quot;

The USS &quot;Cyclops&quot; is encountered in the first episode of the 2005 television miniseries, &quot;The Triangle&quot;. In the story, a team of four experts is assembled by a shipping magnate to investigate the mysterious disappearance of some of his vessels. The team discovers the sunken wreck of the &quot;Cyclops&quot; whilst conducting research in the Bermuda Triangle aboard a submarine.

A ship implied to be the USS &quot;Cyclops&quot; also appeared in the 2006 animated movie &quot;Scooby-Doo! Pirates Ahoy!&quot; It was shown in a scene where the main protagonists are about to enter the heart of the Bermuda Triangle, so the movie seems to suggest that the disappearance of the ship is linked to the mystical, supernatural powers and the legends of the Bermuda Triangle. As it passes by the ship carrying the protagonists, it is confirmed by Velma to be the &quot;Cyclops&quot;.

<text>David Blyth Hanna (December 20, 1858, Thornliebank, Scotland – December 1, 1938, Toronto) was a railway executive with the Canadian Northern Railway and the Canadian National Railways. Born in Thornliebank, Scotland, he emigrated to Canada in 1882 where he was employed by the Grand Trunk Railway. In 1896 he joined William Mackenzie and Donald Mann who organized the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) in Western Canada.

He was third vice-president of the CNoR, president of the Canadian Northern Quebec Railway Company and of the Quebec and Lake St. John Railway Company. After the federal government took control of the bankrupt CNoR in 1918, Hanna was named president of the reorganized company in September 1918.

He was appointed the first president of the Board of Directors of the Canadian National Railways in 1919. He retired in 1922 and was appointed first chairman of the Liquor Control Board of Ontario 1927–28. Sir Henry Thornton (1871–1933) succeeded him as second president of the CNR.

The town of Hanna, Alberta is named after him.

<doc id="1330156" wikidata="Q639715" url="?curid=1330156" title="Polonization">
<text>Polonization or Polonisation () is the acquisition or imposition of elements of Polish culture, in particular the Polish language. This happened in some historic periods among non-Polish populations in territories controlled by or substantially under the influence of Poland.

Like other examples of cultural assimilation, Polonization could be either voluntary or forced. It was most visible in territories where the Polish language or culture was dominant or where their adoption could result in increased prestige or social status, as was the case with the nobilities of Ruthenia and Lithuania. To a certain extent, political authorities have administratively promoted Polonization, particularly during the Second Polish Republic and in the period following World War II.

Polonization can be seen as an example of cultural assimilation. Such a view is widely considered applicable to the population of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the times of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1795), when the Ruthenian and Lithuanian upper classes were drawn towards Westernization with the adoption of Polish culture and the political and financial benefits of such a transition, as well as, sometimes, with the administrative pressure exerted on their own cultural institutions, primarily the Orthodox Church and Protestant by conversion to the Roman Catholic faith was often the single most important part of the process. For Ruthenians at that time, being Polish culturally and Roman Catholic by religion was almost the same. This diminishing of the Orthodox Church was the part most resented by the Belarusian and Ukrainian masses. In contrast, the Lithuanians, who were mostly Catholic, were in danger of losing their cultural identity as a nation, but that was not realized by the wide masses of Lithuanians until the Lithuanian national renaissance in the middle of the 19th century.

On the other hand, the Polonization policies of the Polish government during the interwar years of the 20th century, particularly in the Eastern Borderlands, were more deliberate. Some of them were similar to the mostly forcible assimilationist policies implemented by other European powers that have aspired to regional dominance (e.g., Germanization, Russification), while others resembled policies carried out by countries aiming at increasing the role of their native language and culture in their own societies (e.g., Magyarization, Romanianization, Ukrainization). For Poles, it was a process of rebuilding Polish national identity and reclaiming Polish heritage, including the fields of education, religion, infrastructure and administration, that suffered under the prolonged foreign occupation by the neighboring empires of Russia, Prussia, and Austria-Hungary. However, as a third of recreated Poland&#x27;s population was ethnically non-Polish and many felt their own nationhood aspirations thwarted specifically by Poland, large segments of this population resisted to varying degrees the policies intended to assimilate them. Part of the country&#x27;s leadership emphasized the need for the long-term ethnic and cultural homogeneity of the state. However, the promotion of the Polish language in administration, public life and especially education, were perceived by some as an attempt at forcible homogenization. In areas inhabited by ethnic Ukrainians, for example, actions of the Polish authorities seen as aiming at restricting the influence of the Orthodox and the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church caused additional resentment and were considered to be closely tied to religious Polonization.

== Medieval Poland ==

Between the 12th and the 14th centuries, many towns in Poland adopted the so-called Magdeburg rights that promoted the towns&#x27; development and trade. The rights were usually granted by the king on the occasion of the arrival of migrants. Some integrated with the larger community, such as merchants who settled there, especially Greeks and Armenians. They adopted most aspects of Polish culture but kept their Orthodox faith. In Western Poland, many townspeople were Germans. Initially, trade guilds had been exclusively German-speaking. However, this began to change by increasing Polonization in the 15th and 16th centuries.
Since the Middle Ages, Polish culture, influenced by the West, in turn radiated East, beginning the long process of cultural assimilation.

== Polish–Lithuanian Union (1385–1795)==
=== Grand Duchy of Lithuania ===
Poles reached Lithuania long before the union of the two countries. In a letter to the German Franciscans, Grand Duke Gediminas asked them to send monks who spoke Samogitian, Ruthenian or Polish. Other sources mention Polish slave carers and educators of children. This indicates the presence of Poles, probably prisoners of war or their descendants. Polish influence increased considerably after the Union of Krewo (1386). The Lithuanian Grand Duke Jogaila was offered the Polish crown and became Władysław II Jagiełło (reigned 1386–1434). This marked the beginning of the gradual, voluntary Polonization of the Lithuanian nobility. Jagiełło built many churches in pagan Lithuanian land and provided them generously with estates, gave out the lands and positions to the Catholics, settled the cities and villages and granted the biggest cities and towns Magdeburg rights in their Polish variant.

Lithuanian nobles were granted privileges modeled on those held by the Polish nobility. 47 families of Lithuanian families were adopted by 45 Polish families and endowed with Polish coats of arms. Lithuania adopted Polish political solutions and institutions. The offices of voivodes and castellans appeared, and the country was divided into voivodeships and powiats. There was also a representation of the nobility, called Sejm, following the Polish model. However, unlike the Polish Sejm, the magnates had the deciding vote, and the petty and middle nobility only approved the decisions of the magnate&#x27;s council. Since the late 15th century marriages between Lithuanian and Polish magnates became more frequent. This brought the Lithuanians even closer to Polish culture. The first such marriage was the one between and the daughter of Alekna Sudimantaitis in 1478.

Polish influence intensified in the period preceding the Union of Lublin. The royal court took steps to make the political and economic system of Lithuania more similar to Poland. An important step was the introduction of the hide system (Volok Reform – ), based on the Polish model. The reform was introduced by specialists from Poland, mainly from Mazovia, headed by . &quot;Włóka&quot; was a Polish measure of land (in Ruthenian &quot;volok&quot;), and in Lithuania, it became the basis for land measurement. At the same time, Polish measures of area and distance were introduced, as well as a model of farming based on the folwark and three-field system. 

During the Reformation, voices were raised that Latin should be the language of the Lithuanians, due to the alleged proximity of the two languages and the legendary origin of the Lithuanian nobility from the Romans. However, this intention failed and Latin never reached the same position as in the Polish Crown. Instead, Polish quickly took the place of the official language. At the beginning of the 17th-century instructions and resolutions of sejmiks were written down in Polish. In the period 1620–1630, the Polish language supplanted Ruthenian in the books of the Lithuanian Metrica. When in 1697 the Sejm of the Commonwealth passed a resolution to replace Ruthenian language by Polish in all official actions, it only approved the long-standing status quo. In addition to Polish, Latin was also used in the documents of the Lithuanian chancellery referring to the Catholic Church, cities under Magdeburg Law, Livonia and foreigners.

Already at the beginning of the 16th century, Polish became the first language of the Lithuanian magnates. In the following century, it was adopted by the Lithuanian nobility in general. Even the nobility of Žemaitija used the Polish language already in the 17th century. At the beginning of the 18th century, the Polish language was adopted by the entire nobility of the Grand Duchy – Lithuanian, Ruthenian, German and Tatar. The Polish language also penetrated other social strata: the clergy, the townspeople, and even the peasants.

Linguistic Polonization did not always mean full Polonization in the state or ethnic sense. The Lithuanian nobility felt united with the Polish nobility as part of one political nation of the Commonwealth, enjoying privileges, freedom and equality. In this sense, they often referred to themselves as &quot;Polish nobility&quot; or outright &quot;Poles&quot;. At the same time, separatism and the defense of Lithuanian national separateness within the federation state were very strong. The Lithuanian nobility was strongly attached to the laws, traditions and symbols of the Grand Duchy. Moreover, the Lithuanian separateness was also defended by the members of ethnically Polish families settling in Lithuania.

==== Church and education ====
The spread of Polish culture was channelled through the Catholic Church. A large part of the Lithuanian clergy were Poles, either of Polish descent or from Polish families settled in Lithuania. Of the 123 known canons of Vilnius, only slightly more than half (66) were ethnic Lithuanians, and most of the others were of Polish origin. The role of the church was important because it had a monopoly on teaching. By 1550, 11 schools were established in the Samogitian diocese and 85 in the Vilnius diocese. In 1528 the diocese of Vilnius decreed that the language of instruction of religious texts should be Polish and Lithuanian. Latin was taught exclusively in Polish, so children who did not know this language were taught Polish first. Lithuanians went to Kraków to study, in 1409 professor of theology founded a dormitory for students from Grand Duchy Overall 366 Lithuanian students studied in Kraków between 1430 and 1560. In the 16th-century students from Lithuania were coming to Kraków already considerably Polonized. In 1513, Lithuanian students were accused of mocking the plain Polish speech of their colleagues from Mazovia before the university court.

Polish had the advantage over Ruthenian and Lithuanian that its vocabulary, being influenced by Latin, allowed more abstract thoughts to be expressed. Moreover, its proximity to the Ruthenian language made its adoption all the more natural. The Reformation, on the one hand, accelerated the development of literatures in Lithuanian, on the other hand, it contributed to an even faster spread of the Polish language. The Calvinist magnate Mikołaj &quot;the Black&quot; Radziwiłł published in Brest a Polish translation of the Bible for the use of Lithuanian Calvinists.

==== Royal court ====
The second important channel for the spread of the Polish language and culture was the royal and grand ducal court. After 1447, only for short periods there was a separate grand ducal court in Vilnius. But even then the Polish influence was strong. Already Grand Duke Vytautas employed Polish secretaries to run his Latin chancellery. The Krakow court was dominated by Poles who travelled with the king to Lithuania. The Lithuanian nobles who joined the court were therefore greatly influenced by Polish culture. Casimir Jagiellon was the last grand duke to know Lithuanian. From the time of Zygmunt August, correspondence with the Lithuanian elite was conducted almost exclusively in Polish, since the knowledge of Latin in Lithuania was too weak.

=== Ruthenian lands ===

Jogaila&#x27;s successor Władysław III of Varna, who reigned in 1434–1444, expanded the privileges of the nobles to all Ruthenian nobles irrespective of their religion, and in 1443 signed a bull equalizing the Orthodox church in rights with the Roman Catholicism thus alleviating the relationship with the Orthodox clergy. These policies continued under the next king Casimir IV Jagiellon. Still, the most cultural expansion of the Polish influence continued since the Ruthenian nobility were attracted by both the glamour of the Western culture and the Polish political order where the magnates became the unrestricted rulers of the lands and serfs in their vast estates.

In the 1569 Union of Lublin, the Ukrainian territories controlled by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were transferred to the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, and thus found themselves under the direct influence of the Polish culture and language.

Ukrainian lands of Kyiv and Braclav voivodeship were rather sparsely populated and attracted a lot of settlers, mostly from Volhynia, but also from central Poland. One of the reasons was that serfdom was not introduced there. Among the settlers was also a petty nobility. Ruthenian, just like Lithuanian, nobility was attracted by the Polish culture, which at that time flourished. Many of them adopted the Polish language and customs, even converted to Roman Catholicism. Even for those who remained faithful to the Orthodox Church and Ruthenian language, Polish political identity became very important, as they were inspiring to be part of &quot;szlachta&quot; – a ruling, privileged elite. It was at that time when the concept of &quot;gente Ruthenus, natione Polonus&quot; (a Poles of a Rus&#x27; religion) was born. It all resulted in the almost complete abandonment of Ruthenian culture, traditions and the Orthodox Church by the Ruthenian higher class.

The creation of the Greek Catholic Church, following the 1596 Union of Brest which sought to break the relations between Orthodox clergy in the Commonwealth and the Patriarchate in Moscow, put the Ruthenian people under stronger influence of Polish culture. The unia was supported by the Polish authorities. In addition to the Unia itself, the eventual Latinization of the Unia was one of the components of Polonization. The unia was accompanied by the spread of the Roman Catholic Church in the Ruthenian lands. Dioceses of the Roman Catholic Church were established as early as the 14th and 15th centuries by the Grand Dukes of Lithuania. After the Union of Lublin Jesuit schools were established by Ruthenian magnates.

Some Ruthenian magnates like Sanguszko, Wiśniowiecki and Kisiel, resisted the cultural Polonization for several generations, with the Ostrogski family being one of the most prominent examples. Remaining generally loyal to the Polish state, the magnates, like Ostrogskis, stood by the religion of their forefathers, and supported the Orthodox Church generously by opening schools, printing books in Ruthenian language (the first four printed Cyrillic books in the world were published in Cracow, in 1491) and giving generously to the Orthodox churches&#x27; construction. However, their resistance was gradually waning with each subsequent generation as more and more of the Ruthenian elite turned towards Polish language and Catholicism. Still, with most of the educational system getting Polonized and the most generously funded institutions being to the west of Ruthenia, the Ruthenian indigenous culture further deteriorated. In the Polish Ruthenia the language of the administrative paperwork started to gradually shift towards Polish. By the 16th century the language of administrative paperwork in Ruthenia was a peculiar mix of the older Church Slavonic with the Ruthenian language of the commoners and the Polish language. With the Polish influence in the mix gradually increasing it soon became mostly like the Polish language superimposed on the Ruthenian phonetics. The total confluence of Ruthenia and Poland was seen coming.

=== Royal Prussia ===
Since Teutonic times the language of the Prussian elite and administration has been German. This did not change after the incorporation into the kingdom of Poland. It was only from the beginning of the 16th century that the role of the Polish language began to increase. Since 1527 there have been complaints from representatives of large cities that some council members use Polish, although they know German. In 1555, a canon of Gniezno delivered a speech to the Prussian Sejm in Polish, without the help of an interpreter. In the second half of the 16th century, royal decrees were issued in Polish, debates in the Landtag were held in Polish. Great Prussian families Polonized their names: the Baysen to Bażyński; the Zehmen to Cema; the Dameraw to Działyński, and the Mortangen to Mortęski, the Kleinfelds to Krupocki.

==Partitions (1795–1918)==

Polonization also occurred during times when a Polish state did not exist, despite the empires that partition Poland applied the policies aimed at reversing the past gains of Polonization or aimed at replacing Polish identity and eradication of Polish national group.

The Polonization took place in the early years of the Prussian partition, where, as a reaction to the persecution of Roman Catholicism during the Kulturkampf, German Catholics living in areas with a Polish majority voluntarily integrated themselves within Polish society, affecting approximately 100,000 Germans in the eastern provinces of Prussia.

According to some scholars the biggest successes in Polonization of the non-Polish lands of former Commonwealth were achieved after the Partitions, in times of persecution of Polishness (noted by Leon Wasilewski) (1917), Mitrofan Dovnar-Zapolsky (1926). Paradoxically, the substantial eastward movement of the Polish ethnic territory (over these lands) and growth of the Polish ethnic regions were taking place exactly in the period of the strongest Russian attack on everything Polish in Lithuania and Belarus.

The general outline of causes for that is considered to include the activities of the Roman-Catholic Church and the cultural influence exacted by the big cities (Vilna, Kovno) on these lands, the activities of the Vilna educational district in 19th century–1820s, the activities of the local administration, still controlled by the local Polish or already Polonized nobility up to the 1863–1864 January uprising, secret (Polish) schools in second half nineteenth to the beginning of the 20th century (&quot;tajne komplety&quot;) and the influence of the land estates.
Following the demise of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the end of the 18th century, the Polonization trends initially continued in Lithuania, Belarus and Polish-dominated parts of Ukraine as the initially liberal policies of the Empire gave the Polish elite significant concessions in the local affairs. Dovnar-Zapolsky notes that the Polonization actually intensified under the liberal rule of Alexander I, particularly due to the efforts of Polish intellectuals who led the Vilnius University which was organized in 1802–1803 from the Academy in Vilna (&quot;Schola Princeps Vilnensis&quot;), vastly expanded and given the highest &quot;Imperial&quot; status under the new name Vilna Imperial University (&quot;Imperatoria Universitas Vilnensis&quot;). By the Emperor&#x27;s order, the Vilna education district overseen by Adam Czartoryski, a personal friend of Alexander, was greatly expanded to include the vast territories in the West of the Russian Empire stretching to Kiev in south-east and much of the Polish territory and the development of the university, which had no rival in the whole district, received the highest priority of the Imperial authorities which granted it significant freedom and autonomy. With the effort of Polish intellectuals who served the rectors of the university, Hieronim Strojnowski, Jan Śniadecki, Szymon Malewski, as well as Czartoryski who oversaw them, the university became the center of Polish patriotism and culture; and as the only University of the district the center attracted the young nobility of all ethnicities from this extensive region.

With time, the traditional Latin was eliminated from the university and by 1816 it was fully replaced by Polish and Russian. This change both affected and reflected a profound change in the Belarusian and Lithuanian secondary schools systems where Latin was also traditionally used as the university was the main source of the teachers for these schools. Additionally, the university was responsible for the textbook selection and only Polish textbooks were approved for printing and usage.

Dovnar-Zapolsky notes that &quot;the 1800s–1810s had seen the unprecedented prosperity of the Polish culture and language in the former Great Duchy of Lithuania lands&quot; and &quot;this era has seen the effective completion of the Polonization of the smallest nobility, with further reduction of the areal of use of the contemporary Belarusian language. also noting that the Polonization trend had been complemented with the (covert) anti-Russian and anti-Eastern Orthodox trends. The results of these trends are best reflected in the ethnic censuses in previously non-Polish territories.

Following the Polish November uprising aimed at breaking away from Russia, the Imperial policies finally changed abruptly.

In the 19th century, the mostly unchallenged Polonization trend of the previous centuries had been met staunchly by then &quot;anti-Polish&quot; Russification policy, with temporary successes on both sides, like Polonization rises in mid-1850s and in 1880s and Russification strengthenings in 1830s and in 1860s. Any Polonization of the east and west territories (Russian and German partitions) occurred in the situation were Poles had steadily diminishing influence on the government. Partition of Poland posed a genuine threat to the continuation of Polish language-culture in those regions. As Polonization was centered around Polish culture, policies aimed at weakening and destroying it had a significant impact on weakening Polonization of those regions. This was particularly visible in Russian-occupied Poland, where the Polish culture fared worst, as Russian administration gradually became strongly anti-Polish. After a brief and relatively liberal early period in the early 19th century, where Poland was allowed to retain some autonomy as the Congress Poland puppet state, the situation for Polish culture steadily worsened.

=== Lithuanian and Belarusian lands ===
A complicated linguistic situation developed on the territory of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Polish speakers used a &quot;Kresy&quot; variant of Polish (Northern Borderlands dialect) that retained archaic Polish features as well as many remnants of Belarusian and some features of Lithuanian. Linguists distinguish between official language, used in the Church and cultural activities, and colloquial language, closer to the speech of the common people. Inhabitants of a significant part of the Vilnius region used a variant of the Belarusian language, which was influenced mainly by Polish, but also by Lithuanian, Russian and Jewish. This language was referred to as &quot;simple speech&quot; (), and was treated by many as a dialect variety of Polish. In fact, it was a kind of &quot;mixed language&quot; serving as an interdialect of the cultural borderland. This language became a gateway to the progressive Slavization of the Lithuanian population.

The knowledge of Slavonic intedialect made it easier for Lithuanians to communicate with their Slavic neighbors, who spoke Polish, Russian, or Belarusian. The attractiveness and cultural prestige of the Polish language and its common use in church caused the process to continue and lead to the full adoption of the Polish language. Among the Belarusian population, the usage of Polish was limited to official relations, while at home, the local language was still spoken. As a result, the Lithuanian language retreated under the pressure of Polish faster than Belarusian. This led to the formation of a compact Polish language area between the Lithuanian and Belarusian language areas, with Vilnius as the center. After some time, especially in the Vilnius region, ignorance of the Polish language was considered a lack of cultural savvy. In ceremonial situations it was advisable to use Polish. This gradually limited the use of simple speech to everyday life situations, and gave rise to a sense of contempt for it and Belarusian as the language of work, cursing, but also more emotional and impetuous.

In the Belarusian territories, the Polonization processes were intensified by the struggle of the Russian authorities against the Catholic Churches. The liquidation of the Uniate Church and forced conversions to Orthodoxy provoked resistance among the local community. The Russian authorities opposed the Catholic Church, called the &quot;Polish faith&quot;, to the Orthodox Church, called the &quot;Russian faith&quot;. As a result, referring to oneself as a &quot;Pole&quot; was the same as referring to oneself as a &quot;Catholic.&quot; After Latin, Polish was considered the second language of worship, so attempts to replace it with Russian or local languages were resisted by local population.

The spread of Polish language and culture, and eventually Polish national consciousness, was fostered not only by its prevalence among the upper classes, but also among the impoverished, declassed nobility. Their representatives regarded the nobility&#x27;s traditions, inextricably linked with Polishness, as a marker of prestige, so they cultivated their attachment to the Polish national tradition. And due to the lack of an impassable property and cultural barrier, they exerted influence on the surrounding peasantry. Paradoxically, this was fostered by the anti-Polish and anti-szlachta Russian policy, which gave relief to peasants for the purchase of land. As a result, the property gap between the petty gentry and the peasantry decreased, which resulted in the appearance of mixed marriages, which in turn led to the spread of Polish culture among the peasants.

The emergence of the Lithuanian national movement in the 1880s slowed down the process of Polonization of the ethnically Lithuanian population, but also cemented a sense of national identity among a significant portion of the Polish-speaking Lithuanian population. The feeling of a two-tier Lithuanian-Polish national identity, present throughout the period, had to give way to a clear national declaration. Previously, every inhabitant of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania had been considered a Lithuanian, but in the face of the emergence of the Lithuanian national movement, which considered only those who spoke Lithuanian as Lithuanians, Polish-speaking residents of Lithuania more and more often declared themselves as Poles. The dispute over the auxiliary language of services (Polish or Lithuanian) in the churches on the eastern border of ethnic Lithuania, which heated up from the end of the nineteenth century, influenced the formation of Polish consciousness and the adoption of the Polish language among those believers whose ancestors had abandoned Lithuanian for plain speech.

The Lithuanian historian Vaidas Banys has said the following about Polonization within the Catholic Church of Lithuania in the 19th century:&quot;The &#x27;Polonomaniacs&#x27; announced that the Catholic Church in Lithuania is a Polish church and no other national manifestations are welcome in it. Lithuanian religious services were obstructed, while there was whistling during Lithuanian singing and even fistfights. One event resounded throughout all of Lithuania in 1901, when a jubilee cross with a Lithuanian inscription was thrown away from Šėta&#x27;s church. So-called &#x27;Lithuanomaniacs&#x27; () priests were punished, moved to poorer parishes, or humiliated in their ministry.&quot;

==Second Polish Republic (1918–1939)==

According to the Polish census of 1921 ethnically Polish population constituted about 69% of the population of the reborn state. The largest minorities in interwar Poland were Ukrainians, Jews, Belarusians and Germans. The Polish government&#x27;s policy toward each minority varied, and also changed over time. In general, during the first period of democratic rule dominated by national democracy, there was a tendency to restrict the rights of minorities and pursue Polonization. This changed with the 1926 coup and the assumption of power by Sanation. Policies became more liberal and minority autonomy increased. However, this began to change for the worse a few years before the start of World War II.

Assimilation was considered by National Democrats to be a major factor for &quot;unifying the state&quot;. They hoped that the attractiveness of Polish culture, above all to Slavic minorities, would help to make rapid peaceful assimilation without much resistance. The centrist and leftist parties pointed out that the nation-building processes in the eastern lands could not be reversed. They called, therefore, for conducting so-called state assimilation, that is, granting broad cultural and territorial autonomy, in exchange for loyalty to the Polish state. Such policy was partially conducted by the Sanation regime, especially under leadership of Józef Piłsudski in years 1926–1935.

Polonization also created a new educated class among the non-Polish minorities, a class of intellectuals aware of the importance of schooling, press, literature and theatre, who became instrumental in the development of their own ethnic identities.

=== Belarusians ===
Belarusians in Poland were a poorly educated group, 90% of them making their living by farming. The aspiration of the Belarusians was to achieve cultural autonomy, as well as fair land reform. The maximum number of people of Belarusian nationality in interwar Poland was about 2 million. It is difficult to determine a definite number because for the most part, they did not have an established sense of their national identity; they described their language as &quot;Tutejszy&quot; &quot;simple speech&quot; () or &quot;Poleshuk&quot; (in Polesia). Additionally, after two centuries of Polish influence, Catholic Belarusians naturally leaned toward Polish culture and often referred to themselves as &quot;Poles&quot; even though they spoke Belarusian.

The Polish state&#x27;s policy toward them was not consistent. Initially, during the period of fighting over the eastern border, the activities of Belarusian activists were tolerated. However, this changed after the peace came. In 1924, the Law on Minority Education led to the closure of a huge part of the approximately 350 (or 514) existing Belarusian schools, opened mostly during the German occupation. A 19 bilingual schools and just three elementary Belarusian schools remained. Officials prevented the creation of new schools, despite meeting formal conditions.

The change came after the May Coup of 1926. Despite the abolition of the Belarusian Belarusian Social Democratic Party, for its contacts with the Comintern, there was a period of liberalization of educational policy. The new Minister of Education, Gustav Dobrotsky, ordered the dismissal of officials blocking the establishment of new schools, allowed new schools to open in Catholic communities as well, and organized Belarusian language courses for elementary school teachers. As a result, four Belarusian grammar schools and a dozen elementary schools were opened. The results, however, were poor. In 1928, there were only 69 schools with Belarusian language, all of them in Wilno and Nowogródek voivodeships, very small number in comparison with 2 164 Polish schools existing there. The reversal of this policy came quickly, and after 1929 the number of Belarusian schools began to decline again. Of the Belarusian gymnasiums existing in Vilnius, Navahrudak, Kletsk and Radashkovichy, only the Vilnius gymnasium had survived to 1939. Belarusian schools often conducted classes in Russian, this was especially true of gymnasiums. This resulted from the significant Russification of the Belarusian intelligentsia. The Polish officials often treated any Belarusian demanding schooling in Belarusian language as a Soviet spy and any Belarusian social activity as a product of a communist plot.

Orthodox Christians also faced discrimination in interwar Poland. This discrimination was also targeting assimilation of Eastern Orthodox Belarusians. The Polish authorities were imposing Polish language in Orthodox church services and ceremonies, initiated the creation of Polish Orthodox Societies in various parts of West Belarus (Slonim, Białystok, Vaŭkavysk, Navahrudak).

Belarusian Roman Catholic priests like Fr. Vincent Hadleŭski who promoted Belarusian language in the church and Belarusian national awareness were also under serious pressure by the Polish regime and the leadership of the Catholic Church in Poland. The Polish Catholic Church issued documents to priests prohibiting the usage of the Belarusian language rather than Polish language in Churches and Catholic Sunday Schools in West Belarus. A 1921 Warsaw-published instruction of the Polish Catholic Church criticized the priests introducing the Belarusian language in religious life: &quot;They want to switch from the rich Polish language to a language that the people themselves call simple and shabby&quot;.

The Belarusian civil society resisted Polonization and mass closure of Belarusian schools. The Belarusian Schools Society (), led by Branisłaŭ Taraškievič and other activists, was the main organization promoting education in Belarusian language in West Belarus in 1921–1937.

Compared to the (larger) Ukrainian minority living in Poland, Belarusians were much less politically aware and active. Nevertheless, according to Belarusian historians, the policies by the Polish government against the population of West Belarus increasingly provoked protests and armed resistance. In the 1920s, Belarusian partisan units arose in many areas of West Belarus, mostly unorganized but sometimes led by activists of Belarusian left wing parties. In the spring of 1922, several thousands Belarusian partisans issued a demand to the Polish government to stop the violence, to liberate political prisoners and to grant autonomy to West Belarus. Protests were held in various regions of West Belarus until mid 1930s.

The largest Belarusian political organization, the Belarusian Peasants&#x27; and Workers&#x27; Union (or, the Hramada), which demanded a stop to the Polonization and autonomy for West Belarus, grew more radicalized by the time. It received logistical help from the Soviet Union, and financial aid from the Comintern. By 1927 Hramada was controlled entirely by agents from Moscow. It was banned by the Polish authorities, and further opposition to the Polish government was met with state-imposed sanctions once the connection between Hramada and the more radical pro-Soviet Communist Party of Western Belarus was discovered. The Polish policy was met with armed resistance.

=== Ukrainians ===
Interwar Poland was inhabited by 4-5 million Ukrainians. They lived primarily in the areas of Eastern Galicia and Volhynia. Until the First World War, Galicia with its large Ukrainian Greek Catholic population in the east (around Lviv) was controlled by the Austrian Empire. On the other hand, the Ukrainians of Volhynia, formerly of the Russian Empire (around Rivne), were largely Orthodox, and were influenced by strong Russophile trends. National self-identification was much stronger among the Galician Ukrainians,

==== Religion ====

While the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, which is in communion with the Catholic Church, hoped to receive a better treatment in Poland where the leadership saw Catholicism as one of the main tools to unify the nation – the Poles under Stanisław Grabski saw the restless Galician Ukrainians as less reliable than the Eastern Orthodox Volhynian Ukrainians, seen as better candidates for gradual assimilation. That&#x27;s why the Polish policy in Ukraine initially aimed at keeping Greek Catholic Galicians from further influencing Orthodox Volhynians by drawing the so-called &quot;Sokalski line&quot;.

Due to the region&#x27;s history the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church attained a strong Ukrainian national character, and the Polish authorities sought to weaken it in various ways. In 1924, following a visit with Ukrainian Greek Catholics in North America and western Europe, the head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church was initially denied reentry to Lviv for a considerable amount of time. Polish priests led by their bishops began to undertake missionary work among Eastern Catholics, and the administrative restrictions were placed on the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.

With respect to the Eastern Orthodox Ukrainian population in eastern Poland, the Polish government initially issued a decree defending the rights of the Orthodox minorities. In practice, this often failed, as the Catholics, also eager to strengthen their position, had official representation in the Sejm and the courts. Any accusation was strong enough for a particular church to be confiscated and handed over to the Catholic Church. The goal of the two so called &quot;revindication campaigns&quot; was to reverse the gains of the Orthodox Church from the partitions period and to return to the Catholics those churches that had been converted into Orthodox churches by the Russian authorities. 190 Orthodox churches were destroyed, some of the destroyed churches were abandoned, and 150 more were forcibly transformed into Roman Catholic (not Greek Catholic) churches. Such actions were condemned by the head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, metropolitan Andrei Sheptytsky, who claimed that these acts would &quot;destroy in the souls of our non-united Orthodox brothers the very thought of any possible reunion.&quot;

==== Education ====
The Polish administration closed many of the Prosvita reading rooms. The number of reading rooms declined from 2,879 in 1914 to only 843 in 1923. The decline can be partially explained by the war devastation.

In the independent Poland educational was centralized, provincial school administration was abolished, as it happened with Lviv-based separate Ukrainian representation. In 1924 the law was passed, which set up bilingual Ukrainian and Polish schools. As a result, number of Ukrainian unilingual schools declined, and they were replaced by bilingual schools. This affected Eastern Galicia most severely, where before the war there were 2,400 Ukrainian elementary schools, and during the existence of the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic their number increased to about 3,000. After the region was annexed to Poland, the number began to decline, in 1923 it was 2453, in 1925 it was still 2151, but after the introduction of bilingual schools there was a rapid decline to 648 schools in 1930 and 352 in 1938. At the same time, the number of bilingual schools grew from 9 in 1925 to 1,793 in 1930 and to 2,485 in 1938. The number of Polish schools also declined from 2,568 schools in 1925 to 2,161 in 1938.

The principle of &quot;numerus clausus&quot; had been introduced following which the Ukrainians were discriminated when entering the Lviv University (not more than 15% of the applicants&#x27; total number, the Poles enjoying not less than the 50% quota at the same time).

==== Land reform ====
The land reform was designed to favor ethnic Polish population. By 1938 some 800,000 hectares had been redistributed within Ukrainian-inhabited areas. The redistribution did not necessarily help the local Ukrainian population, however. In 1920 in Volhynia and Polissia 39 percent of the allotted land (312,000 hectares) had been awarded to Polish war veterans. In Eastern Galicia 200,000 hectare had been given to Polish peasants from the western provinces of the country. By the 1930s the number of Poles living within contiguous Ukrainian ethnographic territory had increased by about 300,000.

=== Lithuanians ===

During the interwar period of the 20th century (1920–1939), Lithuanian–Polish relations were characterized by mutual enmity. As a consequence of the conflict over the city of Vilnius, and the Polish–Lithuanian War, both governments – in the era of nationalism which was sweeping through Europe – treated their respective minorities harshly. In 1920, after the staged mutiny of Lucjan Żeligowski, Lithuanian cultural activities in Polish controlled territories were limited and the closure of Lithuanian newspapers and the arrest of their editors occurred. 33 Lithuanian and Belarusian cultural activists were formally expelled from Vilnius on 23 January 1922 and deported to Lithuania. In 1927, as tensions between Lithuania and Poland increased, 48 additional Lithuanian schools were closed and another 11 Lithuanian activists were deported. Following Piłsudski&#x27;s death in 1935, the Lithuanian minority in Poland again became an object of Polonization policies with greater intensity. 266 Lithuanian schools were closed after 1936 and almost all Lithuanian organizations were banned. Further Polonization ensued as the government encouraged settlement of Polish army veterans in the disputed regions. About 400 Lithuanian reading rooms and libraries were closed in Poland between 1936 and 1938. Following the 1938 Polish ultimatum to Lithuania, Lithuania re-established diplomatic relations with Poland and efforts to Polonize Lithuanians living in Poland decreased somewhat.

==Post–World War II==
During Operation Vistula of 1947, the Soviet-controlled Polish communist authorities removed the support base for the still active in that area Ukrainian Insurgent Army by forcibly resettling about 141,000 civilians residing around Bieszczady and Low Beskids to northern areas of the so-called Recovered Territories awarded by the Allies to Poland in the post-war settlement. The farmers received financial help from the Polish government and took over homes and farms left behind by the displaced Germans, in most cases improving their living conditions due to the increased size of the newly reassigned properties, brick buildings, and running water. Dr Zbigniew Palski from IPN explains that an identical operation was performed in Ukraine by the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic at exactly the same time. It was dubbed Operation West. Both operations were coordinated from Moscow; however, there was a shocking difference between their outcomes.

<doc id="1330159" wikidata="Q1379244" url="?curid=1330159" title="Eva Jessye">
<text>Eva Jessye (January 20, 1895 – February 21, 1992) was an American conductor and composer who was the first black woman to receive international distinction as a professional choral conductor. She is notable as a choral conductor during the Harlem Renaissance. She created her own choral group which featured widely in performance. Her professional influence extended for decades through her teaching as well. Her accomplishments in this field were historic for any woman. She collaborated in productions of groundbreaking works, directing her choir and working with Virgil Thomson and Gertrude Stein on &quot;Four Saints in Three Acts&quot; (1933), and serving as musical director with George Gershwin on his innovative opera &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; (1935).
==Early life and education==
Eva Jessye was born January 20, 1895, in Coffeyville, Kansas. She was educated at Western University, a historically black university in Kansas, and Langston University in Oklahoma. She later studied privately with Will Marion Cook in New York City.

In 1919, Jessye began work as the choir director at Morgan State College in Baltimore. She returned west for a time to teach at an African Methodist Episcopal Church school in Oklahoma. In 1926, she went back east to Baltimore, where she began to perform regularly with her group, the &quot;Eva Jessye Choir&quot;. She had first named them the &quot;Original Dixie Jubilee Singers&quot;, but many groups began to appropriate the name, Dixie Jubilee Singers, so she changed hers.

She and the group moved to New York, where they appeared frequently in the stage show at the Capitol Theatre, where Eugene Ormandy conducted the orchestra. They were also frequent performers on NBC and WOR radio in New York in the 1920s and 1930s. They recorded on Brunswick, Columbia, and Cameo records in the 1920s. In 1929, Jessye went to Hollywood as the choral director for the MGM film &quot;Hallelujah&quot;, which had an all-black cast directed by King Vidor. She received praise from members of the black press when she spoke out against the discriminatory practices that she endured while on the set for this film.

In New York, Jessye worked with creative multi-racial teams in groundbreaking productions that experimented with form, music and stories. In 1933, she directed her choir in Virgil Thomson&#x27;s and Gertrude Stein&#x27;s opera, &quot;Four Saints in Three Acts&quot;, produced as a Broadway theatre work. According to Steven Watson, the Eva Jessye Choir&#x27;s participation in &quot;Four Saints&quot;, represented a musical and economic breakthrough for African-American singers at the time. Watson quotes Jessye, describing &quot;Four Saints&quot; as &quot;quite a departure, because up to that time, the only opportunities involved things like &#x27;Swanee River&#x27;, or &#x27;That&#x27;s Why Darkies Are Born&#x27;, or &#x27;Old Black Joe&#x27;. They called that &#x27;our music&#x27;, and thought we could sing those things only by the gift of God, and if God hadn&#x27;t given us that gift, we wouldn&#x27;t have any at all ... With this opera, we had to step on fresh ground, something foreign to our nature completely.&quot; Jessye also demanded that her singers be paid for rehearsal, &quot;fighting a deeply ingrained system of discriminatory salaries, rampant kickbacks, and nonpayment of choruses during rehearsals&quot;, writes Watson. In 1935, George Gershwin chose her as his music director for his opera &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;.

In 1927, Jessye published &quot;My Spirituals&quot;, a collection of her arrangements of spirituals, together with stories about growing up in southeast Kansas.

Jessye also composed her own choral works:
* &quot;The Life of Christ in Negro Spirituals&quot; (1931);
* &quot;Paradise Lost and Regained&quot; (1934), a folk oratorio; and
* &quot;The Chronicle of Job&quot; (1936).

These are combined spirituals, religious narrative or biblical text, and her orchestral compositions.

An active supporter of the civil rights movement, Jessye and her choir participated in the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.

Active into her 80s, she taught at Pittsburg State University (Pittsburg, Kansas), and the University of Michigan. She donated her extensive collection of books, scores, artwork, and other materials to the University of Michigan, which became the basis of the university&#x27;s African American Music Collection. Dr. Jessye was a member of Sigma Gamma Rho sorority.

==Legacy and honors==
Shortly before her death in Ann Arbor, Michigan, she established the Eva Jessye African-American Music Collection at the University of Michigan. She left most of her personal papers to Pittsburg State University in Kansas.

<doc id="1330186" wikidata="Q2005693" url="?curid=1330186" title="Nutuk">
<text>Nutuk (, known as A Speech or The Speech in English) was a speech delivered by Ghazi Mustafa Kemal from 15 to 20 October 1927, at the second congress of Republican People&#x27;s Party. The speech covered the events between the start of the Turkish War of Independence on 19 May 1919, and the foundation of the Republic of Turkey, in 1923. It took thirty-six hours (on a 6 day span) to be read by Atatürk, and became a foundation of Kemalist historiography. Nutuk marked a turning point of Turkish nationalism by introducing a series of new myths and concepts into the vernacular of public discourse, such as republic, democracy, sovereignty of the nation, and secularism. Atatürk designated these concepts as the &#x27;most precious treasures&#x27; of Turkish people, the &#x27;foundations&#x27; of their new state, and the preconditions of their future &#x27;existence&#x27; in his speech.

==Context==
Mustafa Kemal begins his speech by describing the situation of the Ottoman Empire when he landed at Samsun to start the Turkish War of Independence in 1919: 

He argues that the Ottoman Empire is on its death throes by 1919. The people and the army keep loyal to the Sultan who was guilty of treachery, due to centuries old traditions and dogmas: 

He asserts that Turkey can only be respected by other powers if it achieves independence and sovereignty on the basis of Turkish nationhood, not members of the House of Osman as individuals, and threatens Ottoman restorationists: 

Criticizing certain predominant ideas among the Ottoman populace regarding the continued existence of the Ottoman state, particularly about favoring being either an American or British protectorate, he explains his rejection to such ideas and puts forward his reasoning for the founding of a Turkish state: 
Atatürk ended the speech by conveying his message to Turkish youth.

==Analysis==
According to Turkish historian Hakan Uzun, Nutuk is an embodiment of the core values of the nation that Atatürk has embraced. The speech covers the importance of national unity to both the National Movement and the republic. The National Movement, with the goal of achieving independence and unity through the pursue of sovereignty, has done so with a defensive position rather than an aggressive one via a lawful foundation.

According to Turkish sociologist Fatma Müge Göçek, the speech was &quot;adopted as the official Turkish national narrative and became sacralized by the state&quot;. Göçek stated that, because the law criminalizes insulting Atatürk, Turkish historians have been unable to analyze the speech critically. She said: &quot;It is evident that the text commences the birth of the Turkish nation with 1919, removing in the process the demise of the Armenians in 1915 through state violence to the realm of Republican prehistory.&quot;

Historian Marc David Baer wrote: British historian Perry Anderson states that, &quot;The speech he gave in 1927 that became the official creed of the nation dwarfed any address by Khrushchev or Castro. Extolling his own achievements, it went on for 36 hours, delivered over six days, eventually composing a tome of 600 pages: a record in the annals of autocracy.&quot;

<text>Century Theatres is a movie theater chain that operates many multiplexes in the western United States, primarily in California, Colorado, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona. In its later years, it had expanded into the inter-mountain states, the Pacific Northwest, Texas, Alaska and parts of the Midwestern United States. Founded in 1941, the chain was headquartered in San Rafael, California until it was acquired by Cinemark Theatres from Plano, Texas in 2006. Many now-Cinemark-owned theaters continue to operate under the Century brand.

==History==
The Century Theater chain was originally named Syufy Enterprises, for its founder Raymond Syufy, Senior, who built his first theater in Vallejo, California in 1941. The first Century theater was the Century 21 in San Jose, California, which opened November 24, 1964, adjacent to the Winchester Mystery House. The Century 21 theater was built to showcase Cinerama type movies (the left and right empty projection booths are still present), but in fact, it showed only 70mm movies. The screen was later replaced with a flat model, and has remained intact as a throwback to the domed Cinerama palaces of the 1960s. The &quot;Century 21&quot; name was a tactic used to convey to the viewing public a &quot;futuristic image&quot;. This image is bolstered by the lobby&#x27;s distinct modern &quot;bubbled lights&quot; and metallic gold accents. The large orange metal ornament on the top of the domed-theater was functional in addition to being decorative—theater employees rappelled from it when the dome&#x27;s outer track-lighting needed to be maintained. The first film presented at the Century 21 was &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; in 70mm format.
The company started using the name &quot;Century Theatres&quot; in the early 1990s.

Century Theatres has a long history of litigation against its much larger competitor, AMC Theatres, for alleged anti-competitive behavior. However, since the late 1990s, both sides have generally refrained from suing each other.

On August 8, 2006, Texas-based chain Cinemark Theatres announced that it had completed a purchase agreement under which Century Theatres would be acquired with a combination of cash and stock from Cinemark&#x27;s parent company. The transition to Cinemark was completed on Thursday, October 5, 2006, with the exception of the Century 24, which was transferred back to its original company, Syufy Enterprises. In early 2013, it was announced that Century 21, 22, 23, and 24 theaters were soon to be redeveloped. The company&#x27;s drive-in theaters and swap meets were also not part of the merger and also reverted to Syufy Enterprises ownership. They now operate under the brand name &quot;West Wind Drive-Ins and Public Markets&quot;.

In January of 2014, Century 24 was closed and demolished. At the end of March, the 50-year lease for Century 21, 22, and 23 ended and was not renewed, and the theaters closed. A preservation movement, which began the year before, was successful in getting City Historic Landmark status for the very first - the Century 21 - as a prime local example of Mid Century Modern architecture. It was also Placed on the California Register of Historical Resources, and deemed &quot;eligible&quot; to be placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Century 22 and 23 were demolished in 2019 and have been replaced by a parking garage and parking lot, respectively, while the former site of Century 24 has yet to be redeveloped.

===2012 shooting===

On July 20, 2012, in Aurora, Colorado, during a midnight showing of the movie &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;, gunman James Eagan Holmes, shot at viewers in Theater 9 at the Century 16 theater, killing 12 people and injuring 70 others.

Cinemark held an &quot;evening of remembrance&quot; at the remodeled theater on January 17, 2013, inviting elected officials, victims and relatives of victims, after which movies were shown without charge. The theater reopened permanently on January 25. Theater 9 at Century Aurora is now a Cinemark XD Theatre. Instead of numbers, theaters are now identified by letters; for example, the Theater 9 is now Theater I, and Theater 8 is now Theater H.

==Cinemark XD==

In 2009, Cinemark introduced XD (standing for Extreme Digital Cinema), the company&#x27;s response to IMAX. The first XD auditorium was completed at the Century Theatre in the Westfield San Francisco Center by Moorefield Construction, Inc. Extreme Digital allows Cinemark to play any film and display any aspect ratio they want on it, unlike IMAX which requires special formatting. Because of this, Cinemark can play a different movie in their XD auditoriums whenever they want, while IMAX usually plays the same movie for weeks. There are currently 217 Century and Cinemark Theaters equipped with XD. The technology employs a larger screen, up to 38′ × 70′, with additional improvements in audio and digital projection. The projector can project either 2D or 3D from digital cinema sources. As of May 2023, Cinemark operates 168 XD auditoriums. More than 25% of the XD auditoriums are located in the California market.

Shortly after its introduction, IMAX filed a lawsuit against Cinemark, claiming that Cinemark stole trade secrets from them that ultimately went into the creation of XD.

In recent years , XD has also been licensed to the Pacific Theaters chain, and is currently being used at its Winnetka screen in Los Angeles as well as at the Grove in Hollywood, Los Angeles.

In May 2018, Cinemark announced that over 200 XD auditoriums in the United States and Latin America would be equipped with THX sound. This allows audiences to enjoy uncompromised audio and video quality in an environment that fully complements the cinematic experience. THX works closely with exhibitor partners to meet THX Certified Cinema specifications, focusing on auditorium architecture, acoustics, audio and projection equipment calibration and speaker configuration. Recertification is conducted annually by a THX Certificated technician to ensure the cinema continues to meet THX certification requirements year after year.

<text>In cooking, al dente (, ; ) pasta or rice is cooked to be firm to the bite. The term also extends to firmly-cooked vegetables.

In contemporary Italian cooking, it is considered to be the ideal consistency for pasta and involves a brief cooking time. &quot;Molto al dente&quot; is the Italian term for slightly undercooked pasta. 

When cooking commercial pasta, the al dente phase occurs right before the white of the pasta center disappears.

Undercooking pasta is used in the first round of cooking when a pasta dish is going to be cooked twice.

==Nutrition==
The American Diabetes Association says that al dente pasta has a lower glycemic index than pasta that is cooked soft.

<text>Speak of the Devil is an album by jazz guitarist John Abercrombie with organist Dan Wall and drummer Adam Nussbaum that was recorded in 1993 and released by ECM in 1994.

==Reception==
The Allmusic review by Michael G. Nastos gave the album 2½ stars, stating, &quot;Though &quot;While We&#x27;re Young&quot; was a definitive recording for Abercrombie&#x27;s vaunted trio, this CD simply offers a different slant. It&#x27;s the sign of a group either in transition of evolution, and whatever the case, it&#x27;s an intriguing step for these three uncanny sonic explorers&quot;. &quot;The Penguin Guide to Jazz&quot; gave the album 3 stars, stating, &quot;It must have been fun to play, but there is too little for the listener to get a purchase on&quot;.

<text>Lake Superior State University (colloquially Lake State, Soo Tech, and LSSU) is a public college in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, United States. It enrolls approximately 1,600 students. Due to its proximity to the Canadian border, LSSU has many Canadian students and offers joint programs with Sault College and Algoma University in the twin city of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada across the St. Marys River. In a sign of this close relationship with its international neighbor, LSSU flies both the Canadian and United States flags on its campus.

LSSU offers primarily bachelor&#x27;s and associate degrees, but also offers certificates. LSSU has regional centers in northern Michigan in the cities of Escanaba and Petoskey. It is one of three Michigan public colleges or universities that is also a community college.

== History ==

The area that makes up the campus of Lake Superior State University served as Fort Brady from 1894 to 1944; it is listed as &quot;New Fort Brady&quot; on the National Register of Historic Places, as the earlier incarnation of the fort was downhill.

Lake Superior State University was established in 1946 to address the needs of returning World War II veterans and to provide educational opportunities to the people of the Eastern Upper Peninsula. The campus includes several buildings which are listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

The institution was originally a branch of Michigan College of Mining &amp; Technology, which is now known as Michigan Technological University. It opened in 1946 as the Sault Ste. Marie Residence Center of the Michigan College of Mining &amp; Technology, which was commonly shortened to Soo Tech. The original class consisted of 272 students. The institution was later renamed Lake Superior State College of Michigan Technological University in 1966. The college received autonomy from Michigan Tech in 1970 and was known as Lake Superior State College until 1987, when the institution was granted university status.

The institution&#x27;s college radio station is WLSO, and its student newspaper is &quot;The Compass&quot;.

==Academics==

Lake Superior State&#x27;s most popular majors, by 2021 graduates, were:
::Criminal Justice/Law Enforcement Administration (46)
::Registered Nursing/Registered Nurse (34)
::Fisheries &amp; Wildlife Management (29)
::Exercise Science and Kinesiology (20)
::Business/Commerce (19)
::Biology/Biological Sciences (17)

== Major buildings ==


* Administration Building: The Administration Building houses the offices of the President and Provost, as well as human resources, purchasing, and public safety.
* Arts Center: The arts center is a $15 million facility which opened in 2005. The arts center houses a 674-seat auditorium, art, music and dance studios, classrooms and faculty offices. The Arts Center Gallery has a permanent display from the L. F. Noyes Collection of Native American and Western Art.
* Brady Hall: This building is currently being used as freshmen housing. The building is named after Colonel Hugh Brady. Col. Brady was the first commanding officer to serve at Fort Brady. Brady Hall was built as barracks for WACS or Women&#x27;s Army Corps in 1938.
* Brown Hall: Built in the 1820s, this building served as the captain&#x27;s quarters of Fort Brady. Brown Hall wasn&#x27;t called by its present name until 1982 when it was named for retired employee, Edward J. Brown. In the 1940s, the school as well as this building became a guide for veterans of WWII. Remodeling of this hall took place in 1946. In the 1960s, Brown Hall was converted into a counseling and career center that provided academic advising. It was originally led by Steve Youngs and was later taken on by John Truckey. It once served as the location of the School of Education, and the Fine Arts Program. It now houses the Integrated Marketing Department. Much of the known information about this building can be recovered from the LSSU KJS Library Special Collections room.
* CASET: The Center for Applied Science and Engineering Technology is home to the School of Engineering and Technology, as well as the School of Mathematics and Computer Science. CASET also houses the LSSU Robotics Lab and the Product Development Center.
* Cisler Center: The Walker Cisler Student and Conference Center is the main food service and student life building on campus. Dining options include the Quarterdeck and Galley, which features the Grill 155 and a convenience store. It is also home to the Office of Campus Life and Housing, and hosts the Peacock Cove Coffee House, Student Government offices, Student Organization Center, the school newspaper (&quot;The Compass&quot;), and the University radio station (WLSO).
* Crawford Hall: This building focuses on the many science and allied health degrees offered at the university, from nursing to biology and chemistry, to geology and environmental science. In 2000, a $23 million renovation and expansion was completed, providing modern laboratory, classroom, and faculty and student research space. Crawford Hall also houses the LSSU Superior Analytics Laboratory, Ben Long Planetarium, the Cannabis Center of Excellence and Lion Labs Institute, the Environmental Molecular Biology Lab, Kemp Mineral Museum, and the Micro Analysis &amp; Spectroscopic Characterization (MASC) Lab.
* Fletcher Center: Business Operations, Financial Aid, Registrar, and Scheduling can all be found in the former gymnasium for Fort Brady and later, the Soo Tech Hornets. It was named after LSSU benefactor, H. Thayer Fletcher
* Norris Center: This is the main building for recreation, and the School of Criminal Justice, Fire Science and Emergency Medical Services and the School of Recreation and Exercise Science. It is also the main building for the Athletic Department and includes the main office for the Athletic Director. Inside the building lies the Cooper Gym, home of the Laker basketball and volleyball teams; Taffy Abel Arena, home of the Laker hockey team; and the Student Activity Center (SAC), which hosts tennis, track, a weights area and climbing wall. The university has announced a renovation effort to several athletic Norris Center facilities.
* Shouldice Library: The Kenneth J. Shouldice Library facility houses offices for Social Sciences, Business, English and Communications, and two lecture halls. The main level includes the main circulation desk and audio visual, and the Testing Center. It also offers a student computer lab, interactive TV rooms and the Shouldice Gallery. The lower level is home to the Learning Center, Career Services, and academic supportive services. The second floor has a special collections room with five special collections including the Oschner Collection, and a group of Native American, Mayan, European, and African American artifacts and books.
* R.W. Considine Hall: Formerly South Hall, R.W. Considine Hall is the home to LSSU&#x27;s Lukenda School of Business, and provides state-of the art teaching and meeting facilities for all campus programs. In 2017, a three-year, $13.5 million project took the existing 32,000 sq. ft. South Hall and added another 12,000 sq. feet to provide an interactive commons, new program and conference rooms, faculty offices and support spaces, a securities trading lab, the Frenchie LaJoie Board Room, and a Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation that will serve the twin Sault Communities on both sides of the U.S. and Canadian border.

:The LSSU Foundation Office raised $3.6 million in its capital campaign for the project ($600,000 more than expected). The State of Michigan provided $9 million. The building&#x27;s namesake - Robert W. Considine - partnered with LSSU&#x27;s Foundation Office in 2014 to push the project over its funding goal by matching gifts up to $450,000.

:Built in 1903, the original South Hall building was built to house Fort Brady&#x27;s infantry soldiers. The infantry barracks were originally composed of twin buildings. South Hall&#x27;s twin stood approximately 80 feet to the west of South Hall, and was known as the Forestry Building. The two buildings were connected by a third building, which was a one-floor 80 ft by 40 ft wooden structure consisting of an outer shell with a hard wood floor. The building was referred to as the &quot;drill floor&quot;. ROTC cadets practiced marching in the building during inclement weather; otherwise, drills took place outside on the parade grounds, which is where the Kenneth Shouldice Library now stands.

:The Forestry building was destroyed by fire in the early 1960s. The drill floor building was not damaged but was razed during the demolition of the Forestry Building. The floor itself was scavenged and sold. Prior to this time, South Hall was always referred to as the Library although the library only took up a portion of the building. The Campus Book Store used two floors before moving to the renovated Canusa Hall, which saw dining services move to the Cisler Center.

== Admissions ==

LSSU is considered &quot;selective&quot; by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. For the Class of 2025 (enrolling Fall 2021), LSSU received 2,309 applications and accepted 1,680 (72.8%), with 324 enrolling. The middle 50% range of SAT scores for enrolling freshmen was 963-1178. The middle 50% ACT composite score range was 19-27.

==Notable facilities==
* Richard and Theresa Barch Center for Freshwater Research and Education: Previously known at the Aquatic Research Lab (ARL) was an off campus research and educational facility originally located in the east end of the Cloverland Electric Coop hydroelectric plant. Now the designated fishery for CFRE, the hatchery has released more than 40,000 Atlantic salmon into the St.Mary&#x27;s River since 1984. The new $13.2 million CFRE building, funded by Richard and Theresa Barch, officially opened in December of 2021, stands out as a significant attraction on the St. Marys River. The facility is fulfilling its core mission of conducting freshwater research and public outreach, teaching students with a K-12 discovery lab, and providing office space for university researchers and partners, such as members from the USFWS and USCG. Much of the research is geared toward fish culture and management, emerging contaminants in the St. Marys River, and managing invasive species throughout the region.
* Superior Analytics Laboratory: The SAL is housed in the chemistry department at LSSU, and provides analytical services to LSSU researchers, government agencies, businesses, and private citizens. The SAL routinely conducts standard environmental testing, as well as trace level analysis of environmental contaminants such as pesticides, persistent organic pollutants, metals, and cyanotoxins. Revenues from the SAL assist the Chemistry Department in purchasing and maintaining state of the art analytical instrumentation, and provide students with employment opportunities and experience working in a professional lab.
* Cannabis Center of Excellence &amp; Lion Labs Institute: The Cannabis Center of Excellence, sponsored by Agilent Technologies, opened in 2019. As northern Michigan&#x27;s leading center for mass spectrometry and chemical analysis, the CCE supports faculty and student research, and the undergraduate programs in Biology, Biochemistry, Cannabis Chemistry, Chemistry, Environmental Science, Forensic Chemistry, and Geology. The Lion Labs Institute conducts research and education on the extraction and purification of natural products, and contains facilities for hydrocarbon extraction, ethanol extraction, and distillation/purification.
* Environmental Molecular Biology Lab: The Environmental Molecular Biology Lab is a multi-investigator research facility specializing in the application of cutting edge molecular &amp; genetic techniques to the study of human disease through wastewater epidemiology, zoonotic diseases, and wildlife disease. Instrumentation includes ddPCR, qPCR, and nanopore long read genetic sequencing.
* Robotics Lab: The LSSU Robotics Lab is a multimillion-dollar facility dedicated to student instruction in robotics and automation technology. Robotic workcells use FANUC, Stäubli, and Kuka industrial robots.
* Micro Analysis &amp; Spectroscopic Characterization (MASC) Lab: The MASC Lab is a regional research facility dedicated to the characterization of biologic, geologic, and engineered material as well as forensic trace evidence and environmental contaminants. Established in 2023 with funding from the National Science Foundation, MASC Lab core instrumentation includes a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and a micro X-Ray Fluorescence spectrometer (υXRF). Additional instrumentation includes a quantum cascade laser infrared chemical imaging system, fluorescence microscopy, and polarized light microscopy.
* Simulation Center: In the fall of 2018, through a collaboration with a community member of interest, the Lake Superior State University/War Memorial Hospital (LSSU/WMH) Simulation Center was created as a partnership and allowed the Simulation Center to be moved to an on-campus location. This center is housed in a newly renovated space in the Arts Center Building. With a little more than 4,000 sq. feet, the simulation center provides a wide range of simulated experiences for students using high-fidelity male, female, pediatric, and infant simulators. There are three designated patient care areas each with their own control and debriefing rooms. Each patient room consists of working infusion pumps, headwall units, patient monitors, and simulated electronic health records. There is a spacious medication/supply area with a simulated medication-dispensing unit. Because the simulation center provides learning experiences as part of the paramedic program, a simulated ambulance was purchased during the fall 2018 semester, which provides for an increased ability to coordinate and run Interprofessional simulation experiences.

==Traditions==
Lake Superior State University has a variety of traditions.

* &quot;Banished Words List&quot;: Each new year brings another installment of the school&#x27;s &quot;List of Words and Phrases Banished from the Queen&#x27;s English for Mis-Use, Over-Use and General Uselessness&quot;. It has been published since New Year&#x27;s Day 1976 and receives significant media coverage. Word-watchers pull nominations throughout the year from everyday speech, as well as from the news, fields of education, technology, advertising, politics, and more. A committee gathers the entries and chooses the best in December. The list is released on New Year&#x27;s Day.&quot;
* &quot;Hoholik Victory Bell&quot;: The bell, outside the Norris Center and Taffy Abel Arena, is rung after each home victory. Fans gather around the bell as members of the hockey team make their way outside in the cold temperatures to ring the bell. This tradition was started after the bell was hung in the early 1980s. The original bell was replaced in 1992 after extensive damage from the 1992 NCAA Championship celebration.
* &quot;Ship&#x27;s Horn&quot;: An authentic ship&#x27;s horn is within the Taffy Abel Arena, where the Lakers play home hockey games. The horn is mounted high on the wall behind the goal a visiting team defends for two periods. The powerful horn, operated on compressed air, blasts after each Laker goal and at the end of each home game.
* &quot;Snowman Burning&quot;: Each March, on or near the first day of Spring, students, alumni and townsfolk gather around a 10 to snowman on campus and light it on fire. The snowman burning is derived from a German tradition in which the mayor of the town melts snowflakes to declare an end to winter. The snowmen are usually made out of recycled paper and wire. In 1992, the event was canceled due to protests from the Environmental Awareness Club, a student group at Lake Superior State University. This decision upset many people. Calls came in from all over the country. Radio stations, newspapers, citizens, alumni, and local people were all angry. A student poll was taken by The Compass (Lake State&#x27;s campus newspaper) in the fall semester after the cancelled year of the snowman burning. Of 500 students polled, 450 voted to burn a snowman. After receiving so many complaints the tradition was reinstated the following year in 1993.
* &quot;Snowmobile Race&quot;: The city of Sault Ste. Marie puts on the annual I-500 snowmobile race held at a one-mile (1.6 km) oval behind the Norris Center on the campus of Lake State. The event draws a big crowd and is held the first Saturday of February.
* &quot;The Unicorn Hunters&quot; established the banished words list and snowman burning. They also put on stone-skipping tournaments and started a literary magazine. As their name suggests, they also searched for unicorns. Once an ABC News crew found their way to the campus and filmed students &quot;questing for unicorns.&quot; &quot;The Quest, of course, is the pursuit of the unicorn, and the unicorn is one&#x27;s personal vision of perfection or happiness (McWhirter).&quot;

==Athletics==
The school&#x27;s official nickname is the Lakers, but in some instances the athletic teams are called the Soo Lakers in reference to the institution&#x27;s hometown. Prior to becoming known as the Lakers, sports teams were known as the Hornets. The most prominent sport at LSSU is men&#x27;s ice hockey, which is the school&#x27;s only NCAA Division I program. The men&#x27;s ice hockey team is a member of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, being one of seven teams that left the Western Collegiate Hockey Association after the 2020–21 season to reestablish the CCHA. Other sports at LSSU play at a Division II level in the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, of which LSSU is a charter member. At $1284 per student, in 2015 the student subsidy for athletics at LSSU was the highest among all Michigan&#x27;s public universities (this compares to $14 at MSU and $6 at U-M).(24)

<doc id="1330193" wikidata="Q8031085" url="?curid=1330193" title="Women's Test cricket">
<text>Women&#x27;s Test cricket is the longest format of women&#x27;s cricket and is the female equivalent to men&#x27;s Test cricket. Matches comprise four-innings and are held over a maximum of four days between two of the leading cricketing nations. The rules governing the format differ little from those for the men&#x27;s game, with differences generally being technicalities surrounding umpiring and field size.

The first women&#x27;s Test match was played by England women and Australia women in December 1934, a three-day contest held in Brisbane which England won by nine wickets. A total of 149 Women&#x27;s Test matches have been played. Far fewer matches are played each year in favour of Women&#x27;s One Day Internationals and Women&#x27;s Twenty20 Internationals, with the international calendar revolving around the shorter formats of the game.

==Playing conditions==
Women&#x27;s Test cricket is subject to the Laws of cricket, with a number of variations and refinements, which are set out in the ICC&#x27;s &quot;Women&#x27;s Test match playing conditions&quot; document. For the most part, these playing conditions are very similar to those set out for men&#x27;s Test cricket. Matches are played between two teams of eleven players, across up to four innings. Test cricket can have three results: a draw, a tie, or one team wins.

The primary, and most noticeable, difference from the men&#x27;s game is that women&#x27;s Test matches are typically played over four days, rather than five. However, the players are expected to fit more overs in per hour in the women&#x27;s game than the men&#x27;s: 17 as opposed to 15, and so a full day&#x27;s play in a women&#x27;s Test match should include 100 overs, rather than 90. The cricket field has smaller dimensions; the boundaries must be between , in contrast to the required in men&#x27;s Tests. As well as playing on a smaller field, the women use a smaller and lighter ball than their male counterparts; the Laws of cricket dictate that women should use a ball that is between and ounces (139.98 and 150.61 grams); which could be up to ounces (23.03 grams) lighter than the ball used by the men. The Decision Review System (UDRS) is now available in women&#x27;s Test matches, also umpires are permitted to ask the third umpire to check television replays in certain cases.

As women&#x27;s tests are often played over four days, the minimum lead to impose a follow-on is 150 runs, as opposed to a 200 run lead when played over five days. This is consistent with four/five day men&#x27;s test matches.

==Nations==
In all, ten national women&#x27;s teams have competed in Test cricket. The England team&#x27;s tour of Australia and New Zealand in the 1934–35 season established the first three sides, and it is those three teams that have competed in Test cricket most frequently; each having played at least 45 matches. South Africa were the next side to play the format, contesting their first match in 1960. However, due to their exclusion from international sport due to the nation&#x27;s apartheid policy, they have only played in thirteen Test matches, fewer than India. Four sides — Pakistan, Ireland, the Netherlands and Sri Lanka — have competed in fewer than five Test matches.

The nations with men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s test teams do not entirely overlap. Of full members with men&#x27;s test teams, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe do not have women&#x27;s test teams. Netherlands, while not a test team in the men&#x27;s game, are a test playing nation in the women&#x27;s game. Ireland, while having both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s test teams, unusually played a women&#x27;s test match, their only one to date, seventeen years before their first men&#x27;s test match - on both test debuts, the opponent was Pakistan. The eight other full members, including Pakistan, have played men&#x27;s, and then women&#x27;s, test cricket.

The teams with Test status (with the date of each team&#x27;s Test debut) are:
# (28 December 1934)
# (28 December 1934)
# (16 February 1935)
# (2 December 1960)
# (31 October 1976)
# (31 October 1976)
# (17 April 1998)
# (17 April 1998)
# (30 July 2000)
# (28 July 2007)

==Recent developments==

As of April 2019, there had only been one Women&#x27;s Test match in the previous three years, and only two teams other than England and Australia had played in a Women&#x27;s Test in the previous ten years. Australia&#x27;s captain, Meg Lanning, expressed her interest in more Women&#x27;s Test matches being played. In July 2019, following the conclusion of the one-off Women&#x27;s Ashes Test in England, the question was raised about whether Women&#x27;s Test matches should be played across five days, instead of four. The match had two sessions washed out and finished in a draw.

In December 2019, New Zealand&#x27;s Sophie Devine requested that administrators arrange a Women&#x27;s Test match between New Zealand and Australia, following a strong performance in the Women&#x27;s Big Bash League. New Zealand&#x27;s women last played in a Test match in 2004, and their last encounter against Australia in the format was in 1996. In June 2020, during an ICC webinar, Devine and India&#x27;s Jemimah Rodrigues both supported the idea of a multi-format series for women&#x27;s cricket.

In April 2021, the ICC awarded permanent Test and One Day International (ODI) status to all full member women&#x27;s teams.

On International Women&#x27;s Day 2021, it was announced that India and England would play a one-off Test later in the year. The Test was played at Bristol County Ground, between 16 and 19 June 2021. Additionally, the Board of Control for Cricket in India was said to be in talks with Cricket Australia about a possible Test match between India and Australia.

Between 2000 and June 2021, only thirty women&#x27;s Test matches were played, with fourteen of those being Ashes Tests between Australia and England.

On 20 May 2021, Cricket Australia confirmed that an Australia versus India Test match would be played at the WACA Ground, Perth, between 30 September and 3 October 2021. Due to COVID-19 lockdowns and restrictions, the match was later moved to Metricon Stadium on the Gold Coast in Queensland. Another Test match, between Australia and England, was played at Manuka Oval, Canberra, between 27 and 30 January 2022, as part of the 2021–22 Women&#x27;s Ashes series. Both of these matches ended in a draw.

In an interview on the BBC &quot;Test Match Special&quot; radio programme during the 1st Test of the New Zealand men&#x27;s tour of England in early June 2022, Greg Barclay, Chair of the International Cricket Council (ICC), asserted that women&#x27;s Test cricket will not be &quot;part of the landscape moving forward to any real extent&quot;. The assertion generated significant controversy, and also calls from former women&#x27;s Test cricketers and others for the ICC to return control of the women&#x27;s game to women&#x27;s cricket associations.

At the end of June 2022, England and South Africa played their first women&#x27;s Test match against each other since 2003. The match was South Africa&#x27;s first women&#x27;s Test since November 2014. It was played at the County Ground, Taunton, England, and was the first stage of a multi-format South African tour of England.

==Records==
Due to the infrequent playing of women&#x27;s Test cricket outside of Australia, England and New Zealand, cumulative records, such as the most runs during a career, are dominated by players from those three nations. England&#x27;s Jan Brittin has scored the most runs during her career, totalling 1,935 during her 27 matches, and 18 of the top twenty players come from either Australia, England or New Zealand. The Australian batsman Denise Annetts, who is 15th on that list, has the highest batting average, 81.90, from her ten matches. Annetts was also involved in the largest partnership in women&#x27;s Test cricket, sharing a stand of 309 runs with Lindsay Reeler in 1987. Ten women have scored double centuries in Test cricket; the highest of these was the 242 runs scored by Pakistan&#x27;s Kiran Baluch against the West Indies in 2004.

Mary Duggan, who played for England between 1949 and 1963 is the leading wicket-taker in women&#x27;s Test cricket, claiming 77 wickets from 17 matches. The next most prolific bowler is Australia&#x27;s Betty Wilson, who claimed her 68 wickets at the lowest bowling average, 11.80 and the first hat-trick in Women&#x27;s Test cricket. Both of the players with the best bowling figures, in an innings and in a match, are from the Indian subcontinent; India&#x27;s Neetu David holds the record for the best figures in an innings, having taken eight second innings wickets against England in 1995, while Pakistan&#x27;s Shaiza Khan took thirteen wickets in a match against the West Indies in 2004.

Amongst wicket-keepers, Christina Matthews has taken the most dismissals in her career, accumulating 46 catches and 12 stumpings during her 20 matches for Australia. Lisa Nye holds the record for the most dismissals in a single innings, having been responsible for eight of the ten wickets for England against New Zealand in 1992. Only two players have achieved the all-rounders double of scoring a century and taking ten wickets in the same match; Betty Wilson did it against England in 1958, while Enid Bakewell managed it for England against the West Indies in 1979. Wilson&#x27;s performance was the first time such a feat had been achieved in Men&#x27;s or Women&#x27;s Tests and also included the first hat-trick in Women&#x27;s Tests.

<text>China Europe International Business School (CEIBS ( ) ) is a business school headquartered in Pudong, Shanghai, China. CEIBS has campuses in Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, Accra in Ghana, and Zurich in Switzerland.

Established under an agreement between the Chinese government and the European Commission in Shanghai in November 1994, CEIBS was the first business school in mainland China to offer a full-time MBA in China, an Executive MBA and a wide range of Executive Education programmes (e.g. full time MBA programme in English, part-time Global EMBA (GEMBA) programme in English). CEIBS follows the European model of business schools. CEIBS was the first business school on the Chinese mainland to be accredited by both EQUIS and AACSB. The CEIBS Global EMBA (GEMBA) programme is ranked #1 worldwide by the Financial Times. The CEIBS MBA programme has ranked in the top 25 of the Financial Times&#x27; annual ranking for over 20 consecutive years (2005-2025), including nine consecutive years as #1 in Asia. CEIBS offers MBA, Finance MBA, EMBA, Global EMBA, HEMBA, DBA (Switzerland), and Executive Education programmes (see Programmes Overview). The China Europe International Business School (CEIBS) offers top-ranked English-taught programs:
Global Executive MBA (GEMBA): Ranked No. 1 worldwide in the Financial Times Executive MBA ranking for 2024. (FT Executive MBA Rankings 2024)
Full-Time MBA: Recognized as the No. 1 English-taught MBA program in Asia and ranked #12 globally by the Financial Times in 2025. (FT MBA Rankings 2025)

==History==

The school&#x27;s predecessor, the China-EC Management Institute (CEMI), was launched in Beijing in 1984. After CEIBS was formally established in 1994 in collaboration with its partners European Foundation for Management Development and Shanghai Jiao Tong University, it later moved to Minhang in Shanghai. In 1994, CEIBS opened its main campus in Shanghai&#x27;s Pudong district.

In May 2009, CEIBS started an EMBA programme in Ghana, being the first Asian business school to start such a programme in Africa. CEIBS was also the first Asian business school, and one of the very few around the globe, to become carbon neutral in 2011. In 2009, CEIBS became the first Chinese business school to make the world&#x27;s Top 10 MBA ranking compiled by the &quot;FT&quot;.

In November 2015, CEIBS announced that it had acquired the Lorange Institute of Business of Zurich for 16.5 million Swiss francs, with plans to train over 200 Chinese managers per month.

===The CEIBS Diaries===
In June 2022, a 12-part series of posts detailing the negative experience of international students at CEIBS was published on Reddit by an account claiming to be a group of CEIBS MBA alumni. 

The European President of CEIBS Dominique Turpin acknowledged the CEIBS Diaries but vowed the school would learn from its missteps. 

==Campus==
The main campus of CEIBS in Shanghai&#x27;s Pudong district established in 1994 was designed by Henry N. Cobb and Ian Bader of Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners and made CEIBS the first business school in mainland China with its own campus. In 2011, CEIBS began the 18-month construction of Phase 3 of the Shanghai campus which doubled its size to 7.5 million square meters.

CEIBS opened its Beijing campus on April 24, 2010, within Beijing&#x27;s Zhonguangcun Software Park alongside the research centres of IBM, Oracle, Neusoft and more than 200 other leading technology companies. It effectively doubled the school&#x27;s total number of classroom seats. Designed by the Spanish architectural firm IDOM, the Beijing campus hosts CEIBS EMBA programme and executive education courses. Each year, the CEIBS Beijing campus graduates almost 300 EMBA students and nearly 3,000 executive education participants. The campus is also a central meeting point for CEIBS alumni as Beijing is home to CEIBS’ second-largest alumni chapter (after Shanghai).

The CEIBS Zurich Campus is in Horgen, on the shore of Lake Zurich, 18km from the city centre. Campus buildings are connected by a futuristic-looking glass facade. Hosting participants from the MBA, EMBA, GEMBA and HEMBA programmes, as well as customised Executive Education programmes, the Zurich Campus serves as a satellite of CEIBS&#x27; main campus in China and as a bridge between Europe and China for the school. In 2019, a major expansion project doubled the size and capacity of the campus.

Accreditation

In March 2004, CEIBS received European Quality Improvement System (EQUIS) accreditation, making it the first school in mainland China to receive this international accreditation. EQUIS is a renowned international system of quality assessment, improvement, and accreditation of higher education institutions in management and business administration. In 2007, 2012, 2017, and most recently in 2022, EQUIS awarded CElBS with a five-year renewal of its accreditation in recognition of the school&#x27;s high standards.

In December 2008, CEIBS also received accreditation from the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). Founded in 1916, AACSB International is the longest serving global accrediting body for business schools that offer undergraduate, master’s, and doctoral degrees in business and accounting. CEIBS now holds the distinction of having received accreditation from both the US and European standard accrediting bodies. In 2013, 2019, and again in 2024, CEIBS was re-certified as an accredited business school by the AACSB.

In addition, in 2002, the Academic Degree Committee of the State Council of China formally recognised CEIBS’ MBA degree.

<doc id="1330201" wikidata="Q5627242" url="?curid=1330201" title="Gălăciuc">
<text>Gălăciuc (pronounced Gah-lah-chook) is a youth camp in Vrancea county, Romania, 3 km west from Tulnici village, 10 km east of Lepşa resort and 75 km west of Focşani at an altitude of 710 meters, near National Road 2D, in some of the most beautiful and picturesque surroundings in the Carpathians. Built in the 1970s in a very remote, mountainous region, it is the host of some national or international contests such as the Infoeducatie Applied Informatics Contests or The Omega Balkanic Physics contest. The camp can accommodate 390 persons, but the very poor conditions available on site have restricted its official maximum accommodation number to 250.

==Conditions and Accommodation==
Housing is either in the Main Building, in rooms with 4 beds and the Galaciuc building, rooms with 2 or 3 beds, or wooden buildings with 6 or 8 beds. Most of the buildings existed prior to the opening of the camp, being log-cabins belonging to Vrancea&#x27;s Forest Management Company.

==Activities==
Gălăciuc is an excellent venue for paragliding, mountaineering and sightseeing. Its very good position and clean air are the advantages of the camp. 8 km from the camp, in the direction of Lepşa lies the Putna waterfall, with a number of trekking routes, while 10 km away, near Lepşa, there is the Cheile Tişiţei nature preserve and wildlife reservation (with one of the largest population of wild bears in Europe. Trout fishing is possible either in the Putna river or the Lepşa trout farm.

==InfoEducatie==
Infoeducatie is the most important event in Gălăciuc. Taking place in July or August it is a national software development contest for high-school students in Romania. First taking place in 1994, it is also the oldest one surviving. Students are required to bring a home-made software (any kind is accepted, although educational software falls in a special category) developed by themselves or a website and show it in front of a jury. To be able to enter the contest, you must win a prize (rank 1st, 2nd or 3rd) in local and regional qualification rounds. Sponsors include Google, Orange and Cisco. Although prizes are not high ($350 for first prize in 2004), all students that win a prize are entitled to enroll in some informatics departments of Romanian universities without standard application procedures (they are automatically accepted), thus making the competition rather fierce. Some of the software presented is of commercial grade, including CAD programs and utilities, games, anti-viral software, robots programming and compression tools.
A great number of people, IT&amp;C specialists, grow here in this wonderful place

<text>George Armistead (April 10, 1780 – April 25, 1818) was an American military officer, best known as the commander of Fort McHenry during the Battle of Baltimore in the War of 1812.

==Early life and education==
Armistead was born to the former Lucinda Baylor Page and her husband John Armistead at his Newmarket Plantation in Caroline County, Virginia (now in Milford). His ancestors had emigrated from Britain to Gloucester County in the Virginia colony, and moved to what was then the frontier before the American Revolutionary War, during which they aligned with the Patriot cause. The family included five brothers, who also served as military officers during the War of 1812. John Baylor Armistead (d. after 1844) was captain of the U.S. Light Dragoons (1799-1800); William Armistead moved to Prince William County, Addison Bowles Armistead (D. Feb. 10, 1813) was lieutenant of the 7th U.S. Infantry (1799-1800) and an artillery and engineering captain after 1806, Lewis Gustavus Adlphyus Armistead would become a captain of rifleman in the Army and die Sept 17;, 1814 in a sortie from fort Erie, and Walker Keith Armstrond (1785-1845) a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy of would become a breveted brigadier general in 1828. While all five brothers served in the War of 1812, the most distinguished (other than this man) was Walker Keith Armistead, who graduated from West Point in 1803 and served for 42 years as a commissioned officer, including as the Army&#x27;s chief engineer (from 1818 to 1821), then as colonel of the 3d Artillery Regiment until his death in 1845.

==Career==

This man&#x27;s military career began during the Quasi War with France, as he accepted a commission as an ensign in the 7th U.S. Infantry Regiment on January 14, 1799. Although promoted to 2nd lieutenant on March 3 of the same year and to 1st lieutenant on May 14, 1800, he was discharged from the Army on June 15, 1800 as the Quasi War ended.
However, this lapse in service lasted for less than a year, as on February 16, 1801, Armistead accepted a commission as a lieutenant in the 1st Regiment of Artillerists and Engineers. He was promoted to captain on November 1, 1806.
==War of 1812==
Five Armistead brothers served in the War of 1812, three in the regular army and two in the Virginia militia.
As hostilities with Britain escalated, Armistead served as an artillery officer at Fort Niagara. Within months, on May 27, 1813, Armistead distinguished himself at the capture of Fort George (near the mouth of Niagara River in Canada) from the British, Armistead was promoted to major of the 2nd Artillery Regiment on March 2, 1814. He would later carry the captured British flags to President James Madison. Upon his arrival in Washington, Armistead was ordered to &quot;take command of Fort McHenry.&quot;

When he arrived at Fort McHenry, located in the outer harbor of Baltimore, Maryland, Armistead ordered &quot;a flag so large that the British would have no difficulty seeing it from a distance&quot;. That flag, known as the Star-Spangled Banner Flag, measured 42&#x27; × 30&#x27;, and was made by Baltimore resident Mary Pickersgill, her daughter, and seven seamstresses, and would be later memorialized by Francis Scott Key in the poem &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, which became the American national anthem in 1931.

During the nearly 25-hour bombardment of Fort McHenry, commencing before dawn on September 13 until the morning of September 14, 1814, Armistead alone knew the fort&#x27;s magazine was not bombproof. When a shell crashed through the roof of the magazine but failed to explode, Armistead ordered the powder barrels cleared out and placed under the rear walls of the fort. Remarkably, only four men were killed, when two shells smashed into the fort&#x27;s southwest bastion, despite a deadly rain of some 2,000 mortar shells that the British bombardment fleet fired at the fort. Because the Royal Navy proved unable to capture or reduce the fort in order to enter Baltimore harbor to bombard the main American defense line east of the city, British commander-in-chief Vice Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane wrote to British Army commander Colonel Arthur Brooke that it was up to him whether to decide to attack or withdraw. Brooke, who had taken over from Major-General Robert Ross, who was mortally wounded just before the Battle of North Point on September 12, decided to withdraw. Armistead received a brevet promotion to lieutenant colonel on September 20, 1814 for his gallant services in defense of Fort McHenry.

==Personal life==

On October 26, 1810, he married Louisa Hughes, whose grandfather had emigrated from County Wexford in Ireland, and whose mother had been born in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The couple had two daughters and a son and owned several enslaved people.

==Death and legacy ==

Following the battle, Armistead was soon promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel, but was much weakened by the arduous preparations for the battle. He died at age 38, while still in command at Ft. McHenry only three years later. Historian Benson Lossing, wrote &quot;the tax upon his nervous system during that bombardment left him with a disease of the heart ... on the 25 of April, 1818 he expired, at the age of thirty eight years.&quot; His funeral procession was described as &quot;immense&quot;. He buried in the graveyard of Old St. Paul&#x27;s Church in Baltimore. Baltimore constructed a marble monument which overlooks the city mentioning his role in the defense of Fort McHenry, and which with a later-erected building across from the Baltimore City Hall define a plaza near the harbor.
Following his death, his widow inherited the Star-Spangled Banner (the larger of two flags displayed at the historic fort during the battle), which the family said was given to Armistead following the bombardment of Fort McHenry. Not only was the flag displayed during significant events (such as Lafayette&#x27;s visit to Baltimore, which happened after this man&#x27;s death), his widow and later family members distributed pieces as souvenirs, damaging the historic object. Nonetheless, generations of the family treasured the flag, and unlike the smaller battle flag, it survives to this day. His grandson, Ebenezer Appleton, lent it to the Smithsonian Institution in 1907 and made the loan permanent in 1912, with provisos requiring its maintenance and display.

<text>Franco Ventriglia (October 20, 1922 – November 28, 2012) was an opera singer who sang bass in every major European opera house during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. He returned to the U.S. in 1978, where he continued to perform at venues including Carnegie Hall, and traveled to perform in southeast Asia, until his retirement in 2001 at age 79.

==Biography==
Franco Ventriglia was born on October 20, 1922, in Fairfield, Connecticut, to Rosa and Salvatore Ventriglia. He grew up on a vegetable farm and graduated from Roger Ludlowe High School in Fairfield in 1941. He enlisted in the Marine Corps, serving in the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing in the South Pacific during World War II. After returning from the war, he was working at his brother&#x27;s filling station in Easton, Connecticut, when Mario Pagano, a &quot;maestro de Canto&quot; at the American Theatre Wing Professional School heard from one of Ventriglia&#x27;s coworkers about his singing talent. Ventriglia passed an audition and went on to attend the school on the G.I. Bill, crossing paths with classmate Marlon Brando, among others.

==Singing career==
Ventriglia worked as an inspector at Sikorsky Aircraft in Stratford, Connecticut, and sang in local concerts. After attending a few of Ventriglia&#x27;s concerts in Bridgeport, Connecticut, Igor Sikorsky, a music lover, granted Ventriglia permission to take one day off from work each week to continue his voice studies in New York City.

After Pagano&#x27;s death, Ventriglia and his wife Jean boarded the ocean liner SS Constitution for Italy. On board, after singing &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; for a group in first class, he met a businessman who asked him to contact Toti Dal Monte, a great coloratura soprano who also taught voice in Rome. Ventriglia took singing lessons from Dal Monte and eventually made his operatic debut in Palermo, singing in the &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;. He later sang with Luciano Pavarotti in &quot;La bohème&quot; and &quot;Rigoletto&quot;. He performed in &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; at La Scala, a performance he considered the highlight of his career.

==Later life and death==
Ventriglia&#x27;s last concert was at the age of 79.

Ventriglia died on November 28, 2012. He was buried at Oak Lawn Cemetery in Fairfield.

<text>The Monitoring the Future (MTF) study, also known as the National High School Senior Survey, is a long-term epidemiological study that surveys trends in legal and illicit drug use among American adolescents and adults as well as personal levels of perceived risk and disapproval for each drug. The survey is conducted by researchers at the University of Michigan&#x27;s Institute for Social Research, funded by research grants from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, one of the National Institutes of Health.

== Survey design ==
The survey began in 1975 and only focused on that year&#x27;s senior class. Questionnaires are sent out yearly by mail. Beginning in 1976, a proportion of survey participants were also chosen for reevaluations. In 1991, the survey was expanded to include 8th and 10th grade students. The questionnaire is anonymous for 8th- and 10th-grade students while the questionnaire for 12th-grade students is confidential—name and address information is collected for longitudinal follow-up surveys.

Nationally representative samples of 8th-, 10th-, and 12th-grade students (The 2010 MTF survey encompassed about 46,500 students from almost 400 schools nationwide) receive a questionnaire investigating substance use patterns, attitudes and beliefs about drugs, perceived availability of drugs, and norms among peer and role model groups. Currently, approximately 50,000 8th, 10th and 12th-grade students complete the survey annually.

The survey also evaluates a variety of topics beyond drug use. Questionnaire questions also explore subjects&#x27; occupational and educational plans and experiences, attitudes about gender roles, attitudes and experiences with people of a different race/ethnicity, trust in government and other institutions, concerns about the environment, media consumption, victimization and delinquency, among other things. Follow-up studies into adulthood also cover marriage and family formation, college attendance, military service, civilian employment, unemployment, and other topics.

== Regular marijuana and cigarette use by 12th graders ==

Chart below is from a NIDA article. Text at the top was added later. Chart is for regular marijuana and cigarette use by 12th graders in the USA in the past 30 days. For cigarettes actual daily use is measured. For marijuana it is for use on 20 or more occasions in the past 30 days.

<doc id="1330220" wikidata="Q834021" url="?curid=1330220" title="RoboCop 2">
<text>RoboCop 2 is a 1990 American science fiction superhero action film directed by Irvin Kershner and written by Frank Miller and Walon Green. It stars Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, Dan O&#x27;Herlihy, Belinda Bauer, Tom Noonan and Gabriel Damon. It is the sequel to the 1987 film &quot;RoboCop&quot;, the second entry in the &quot;RoboCop&quot; franchise and the last to feature Weller as RoboCop until he returned in &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot; (2019), &quot;&quot; (2023) and other media; it is also the last film Kershner directed before his death in 2010.

Set in a dystopian Detroit, the plot follows RoboCop (Weller) as he becomes embroiled in a scheme made by Omni Consumer Products to bankrupt and take over the city while also fighting the spread of a street drug called &quot;Nuke&quot; and its gang of dealers led by Cain (Noonan). The film was shot on-location in Houston.

The film received mixed reviews upon its release and earned a moderate box office return, grossing $45 million worldwide, compared to the previous film&#x27;s $53 million gross on a significantly smaller production budget. It was nominated for three Saturn Awards, including Best Science Fiction Film, Best Performance by a Younger Actor (for Damon), and Best Special Effects (for Phil Tippett, Rob Bottin and Peter Kuran). A sequel, &quot;RoboCop 3&quot;, was released in 1993. Miller would return to write the comic book sequel &quot;RoboCop Versus The Terminator&quot; in 1992 and Steven Grant adapted his original screenplays for the second and third films into the comics &quot;Frank Miller&#x27;s RoboCop&quot; from 2003 to 2006 and 2013 to 2014.

==Plot==
In a near dystopian future, Detroit is nearing bankruptcy after failing to pay off its debts to conglomerate Omni Consumer Products (OCP). The OCP chairman intends to have the city default on its debt, then foreclose on all public property so they may move ahead with their radical urban development project, Delta City. To rally public opinion behind the project, OCP deliberately underfunds the Detroit Police Department to cause a rise in street crime. A new designer drug, Nuke, is sweeping the city, backed by a man named Cain. 

RoboCop remains on duty with his partner Anne Lewis, and continues to be plagued by memories as his life as Alex Murphy. He locates the home of his widow and son and begins watching them until she brings litigation against OCP, but when she meets him face-to-face and is responsive to him, RoboCop claims not to know her and that her husband is dead. OCP attempts to develop a &quot;RoboCop 2&quot; using the brains of legally-dead police officers, intending to mass produce them to replace human officers. However, all subjects kill themselves upon activation. Psychologist Juliette Faxx suggests that the error is the test subjects, and that Murphy was a success because of his strict Catholic upbringing and moral code, preventing him from committing suicide and reinforcing his devotion to his duty. Faxx begins screening suitable candidates for the project, but instead of police officers she secretly considers death row inmates who desire power and immortality.

RoboCop raids a construction site used by Cain&#x27;s gang, but he is ambushed and dismembered, and the pieces dumped in front of the precinct. RoboCop is repaired, but Faxx intentionally reprograms him with more than 300 new directives that severely impede his ability to perform his duties so that her project can be selected. RoboCop eventually clears these by shocking himself with a high-voltage transformer and rebooting his system. He convinces the police to aid him in raiding Cain&#x27;s hideout, and Cain is heavily wounded and arrested and put in hospital care. Cain&#x27;s lieutenant, a prepubescent boy named Hob, escapes and takes control of his empire. Believing she can control Cain via his Nuke addiction, Faxx selects him for the RoboCop 2 project and disconnects his life support. His brain is removed and implanted in a new cyborg body. Hob contacts the mayor and offers to cover the city&#x27;s debt to OCP in exchange for leniency towards Nuke, and OCP sends RoboCop 2 to stop the deal. The mayor escapes but RoboCop 2 slaughters everyone else present, and RoboCop arrives and is told by a wounded Hob that Cain was the attacker before he dies.

The chairman of OCP presents an unveiling ceremony for RoboCop 2 and Delta City, and RoboCop 2 begins to go berserk when he holds up a canister of Nuke. RoboCop arrives and the two cyborgs battle, ending with Lewis using the Nuke canister to distract RoboCop 2 so RoboCop can climb on its back. He rips out Cain&#x27;s brain and smashes it on the street, deactivating RoboCop 2. OCP decide to use Dr. Faxx as a scapegoat for the failure of RoboCop 2 but intend to move ahead with construction of Delta City. Lewis complains that OCP will once again avoid accountability, but RoboCop insists they must be patient because &quot;we&#x27;re only human&quot;.

=== 1987–1988: &quot;The Corporate Wars&quot; ===

&quot;RoboCop&quot; screenwriters Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner started drafting a sequel in September 1987 due to strong demand by Orion which imposed a deadline of December 31, 1987. Neumeir and Miner rushed the screenplay as they were also simultaneously writing for another Orion project, &quot;Company Man&quot;; a film about the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s involvement in the Contras, it was planned to be directed by Oliver Stone, star Paul Newman, and be released before the next United States election.

Neumeier and Miner&#x27;s draft, &quot;RoboCop 2: The Corporate Wars&quot;, is set 25 years after the first movie. RoboCop, trying to stop a bank-robbery, is blown up by a thief. The titular protagonist wakes up in a new United States named AmeriPlex, consisting of upper-class &quot;plexes&quot; made out of former cities (e.g. NewYorkPlex, RioPlex, DelhiPlex) and many more shanty towns with residents named OutPlexers. He is revived in a now-abandoned building for the defunct Omni-Consumer Products (OCP) by two goons of a &quot;super-entrepreneur&quot; named Ted Flicker, who plans to make the national government a private corporate entity that he will own. Flicker also currently has a lot of control over the country, despite another person (who was a former comedian) being the president. RoboCop&#x27;s new system is also the central computer system of AmeriPlex, NeuroBrain.

&quot;RoboCop 2&quot; follows numerous subplots, such as Flicker&#x27;s plan for domination, a violence-spreading narcotic named Smudge, the Internal Grid Security commander trying to commit genocide against the OutPlexers, and RoboCop&#x27;s code being played with by an American scientist and a Chinese hacker. The script expands upon the first film&#x27;s consumerist aspects; those in the high-class city plexes eat at LeisureGold where ServiceDroids serve them and make love with SexBots at various brothels; while the environment&#x27;s media landscape is filled with &quot;NewsBlips,&quot; mood-enhancing drugs ads, and MoonDog, a rapper from space, changing public opinion.

On March 7, 1988, a five-month Writers Guild of America strike began and its length resulted in Neumeier and Miner being fired from the project for breach of contract. Additionally, the writers and Orion struggled to agree on a story, with the studio turned off by the gritty parts of Neumeier and Miner&#x27;s draft. Stone also stopped &quot;Company Man&quot; to work on &quot;Talk Radio&quot; (1988), making Neumeier and Miner no longer involved at Orion.

=== 1988–1989: Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;RoboCop 2&quot; ===
In order for a sequel to still be possible, Orion had to sign a waiver to develop other &quot;RoboCop&quot; scripts, and, before he was fired, Neumeier recommended two popular comic book authors to write them: Alan Moore and Frank Miller. Moore declined the offer, citing a lack of interest in working on movies. Miller, who had become popular for his edgy, &quot;tragic hero&quot; take on the Batman character, signed on to the project after Miner and Neumeier had been fired. His script went through four drafts. While there had been no reports of Miller taking influence from Neumeier&#x27;s script, &quot;The Corporate Wars&quot;, both versions of the script have several things in common, including the concepts of corporate executives trying to buy out entire governments and highly addictive drugs causing mass violence.

Miller&#x27;s first draft was less comic and had a bigger emphasis on corporatism than the final film, with the last showdown pitting RoboCop against OCP forces instead of RoboCop 2. While &quot;RoboCop&quot; (1987) producer Jon Davison praised its grittiness, &quot;inventive action,&quot; humor, and politics, Orion rejected the script as &quot;unfilmable&quot; and brought in a screenwriter of the violent western film &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; (1969), Walon Green, to re-write it. Cut material included backstories for Anne Lewis and the marriage between Alex Murphy and his wife Ellen. Miller later used his treatment as the basis for his own series of &quot;RoboCop&quot; comics published in the 2000s.

=== Development ===
Davison had been reluctant to produce a sequel to &quot;RoboCop&quot;, citing a skepticism of sequels in general. He believed that most sequels were worse than their predecessors, and he preferred to cater new properties to audiences of the first film. He was also forced to decide between producing a second &quot;RoboCop&quot; film, versus producing Warren Beatty&#x27;s screen adaptation of the &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; comics. He ultimately chose to take on &quot;RoboCop 2&quot;, saying that &quot;&quot;RoboCop&quot; is my movie and &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; is more Warren&#x27;s movie&quot;. Director Paul Verhoeven did not return, as he was working on &quot;Total Recall&quot; (1990). As with the first film, multiple directors rejected offers from Davison to direct &quot;RoboCop 2&quot;, although for different reasons; Davison reported potentials were either concerned about following up Verhoeven&#x27;s directing, or not wanting to direct a sequel. Alex Cox considered the project, but changed his mind after watching a screening of the sequel to &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (1973).

Davison first hired his friend Tim Hunter, mostly known for &quot;River&#x27;s Edge&quot; (1986), to direct &quot;RoboCop 2&quot;, citing his &quot;realistic tone with actors&quot; and &quot;real dark sensibility&quot; as reasons. However, Hunter left the project eleven weeks before filming began, citing a conflict between his vision of an entirely dark product like the first film, and Miller&#x27;s more humorous script, which he called &quot;tonally unfocused&quot;. He was replaced by Irvin Kershner, who had previously filled in as director on &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980), and who shared Miller&#x27;s vision. While Davison had made Kershner agree to not make changes to the script once shooting had begun, due to the state of the script and the tight schedule, Kershner found himself forced to work closely with Miller on editing the script as filming progressed. Kershner added more dialogue and discarded several new scenes that Green had added, in favor of the reworks that he was performing with Miller. Miller later said that he had only been willing to work with Kershner on revising the script, and that he had rejected multiple offers from other people to do this.

Orion Pictures asserted far greater control over the sequel compared to the original film, and frequently pushed back against input from Miller, Kershner, and the actors. Before the story had been completed, Orion announced a release date during the Christmas season in 1989, then later moved it up to early that summer, resulting in a rushed production cycle. Neumeier and Miner claimed that these decisions were based solely on business decisions and stifled creativity, and Weller said that the film did not have a proper third act since Orion insisted that &quot;the monster&#x27;s going to be enough.&quot;

=== Casting ===
Initially, Orion was skeptical of casting Weller, under the reasoning that the audience would find RoboCop the same if another actor was under the helmet, similar to the titular character of Universal&#x27;s &quot;The Mummy&quot;. Weller himself was also skeptical coming back; he disliked Neumeier and Miner&#x27;s draft as a &quot;cartoon&quot; and lacking in tension, felt not &quot;complete with the character&quot; thinking &quot;there was something else to say with it,&quot; and wondered if he should do months of training for acting in a RoboCop suit, or get paid for filming in the Caribbean for ten weeks. Ultimately, Weller returned for Miller and Green&#x27;s new screenplay, and the fact that he would again work with mime Moni Yakim, who developed RoboCop movements for Weller in the first film; he praised him as the &quot;magic element&quot; to solve all of a crew&#x27;s problems. Additionally, Russell Towery returned as Weller&#x27;s stunt double, with Weller more dependent on him than the first movie.

Allen, despite already having played a cop character in the first &quot;RoboCop&quot;, still made preparations for shooting &quot;RoboCop 2&quot;; she learned martial arts and spent two months of training at a Los Angeles police academy. Although Cain was originally planned to be a typical professionally-suited drug dealer, his actor, Tom Noonan, came up with the character being a former hippie, with the actor using his experience as one in the 1960s.

=== Filming ===
&quot;RoboCop 2&quot; was chiefly filmed in Houston. Kershner mentioned that Houston was an ideal location, due to the relative calmness of Downtown Houston at night. He also claimed that they were shooting in winter, and snow and rain would be an inappropriate climate for film production. Jefferson Davis Hospital was used as the location for the Nuke manufacturing plant; it also served as the exterior of the police station. The finale of the film was shot in the Houston Theater District, near Wortham Theater Center and Alley Theatre. Cullen Center was depicted as the headquarters of Omni Consumer Products, while Houston City Hall was shown in a scene in which Mayor Kuzak speaks to the press. The George R. Brown Convention Center and the Bank of America Center were also included in the film. Additional footage was filmed at the decommissioned Hiram Clarke Power Plant.

With Kershner&#x27;s first few weeks spent storyboarding the visual effects during pre-production, the first month on &quot;RoboCop 2&quot; was night shooting, and Vistavision-camera background plates for Phil Tippett&#x27;s animated special effects of the final battle scenes. A week spent filming a major sequence at an abandoned steel mill established how Kershner would direct the film&#x27;s other scenes in terms of acting, lighting and camera movements.

The second unit was directed by Conrad Palmisano and mostly shot in Los Angeles, although a stunt sequence by the unit was reported to be filmed near the entrance of the Wortham Theater Center. It got so busy it was unable to produce all the shots Kershner wanted; this meant the director had to film with the unit for a few weeks.

A magazine article published at the time of filming described the environment on set as &quot;hell on earth&quot;, with the cast and crew rebelling against Kershner&#x27;s &quot;obsessive finickyness&quot; and &quot;costly reshoots.&quot; However, this was debunked by Weller who said: &quot;Kersh didn&#x27;t delay anything, he&#x27;s very, very instinctive - he had his mind made up, usually ahead of time.&quot; Kershner said: &quot;I didn&#x27;t shoot a lot of film at all. You see, if I&#x27;d tried to do a lot of coverage, I would never have finished. I would have been 120 days. I had to pretty much lock it in, piece by piece by piece, giving myself an out here and there, a variation, so I wasn&#x27;t totally locked in. That way, I could finish. If I didn&#x27;t do that, this would have gone on forever. I never would have gotten each day&#x27;s work done.&quot;

Although, at the time, Allen praised Kershner for his creativeness and attention to detail, she later criticized the director as antagonistic, and ruining the humor and &quot;heart&quot; of the screenplay. Peter Weller was also critical of the script: &quot;&quot;RoboCop 2&quot; didn&#x27;t have a third act. I told the producers and Irv Kershner up front, and Frank Miller. I told them all. I said, &#x27;Where&#x27;s the third act here, man? So I beat up a big monster. In the third act, you have to have your Dan O&#x27;Herlihy. Somebody&#x27;s got to be the third act.&#x27; &#x27;No, no, the monster&#x27;s going to be enough.&#x27; &#x27;Look, it&#x27;s not enough!&#x27;&quot; Despite the script problem, he enjoyed working on the movie with Kershner: &quot;I had a good time making &quot;RoboCop 2&quot; but the script did not have the code, the spine, or the soul of the first one.&quot; Noonan also claimed to be &quot;relaxed&quot; and enjoying himself on set, where &quot;everyone was incredibly nice,&quot; and found Kershner able to adapt with many location and script changes during shooting.

=== Effects ===
Phil Tippett returned from the first &quot;RoboCop&quot; to do the visual effects for the sequel, this time leading all the effects units. &quot;RoboCop 2&quot; was Tippett and Kershner&#x27;s second collaboration, after Tippett worked at Industrial Light &amp; Magic for &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;.

Most of the RoboCop 2 design was created while Hunter was signed as director.

RoboCop suit designer Rob Bottin, although not overseeing the process like in the first film, returned to produce a new suit for the second film. The first suit was dark chrome using metal flake and various green, purple and gold colors to create a look made iridescent and steel-like by Jost Vacano&#x27;s fluorescent lighting; however, since Mark Irwin replaced Vacano for cinematographer and used conventional lighting, the second film suit (although using a black base like the other suit) looked light-bluer, so iridescent colors were more directly applied with powder. Thanks to a bigger budget, the effects team had more time to paint and polish the suit, which led to Bottin&#x27;s desired &quot;show car&quot; look he couldn&#x27;t achieve in the first. With a lot of planning and fastener hunting, Bottin also built all parts of the suit to come on and off quickly so that it couldn&#x27;t decay from the actor having it on too long, which was the case of the first film.

Stop-motion and computer animation was used for the final showdown between the RoboCop and RoboCop 2 characters.

==Music==
The film score was composed and conducted by Leonard Rosenman, who did not use any of Basil Poledouris&#x27;s themes from the first film, instead composing entirely new themes and leitmotifs. The soundtrack album was released by Varèse Sarabande.

The glam metal group Babylon A.D. released a song called &quot;The Kid Goes Wild&quot;, written by members Derek Davis, Vic Pepe and Jack Ponti. The song is played in the background in the middle part of the film, and it was also used to promote the film. The group created a music video featuring RoboCop targeting the band and having a shootout with some bad guys (footage of the film was also used).

==Release==
===Marketing===
To promote the film, RoboCop made a guest appearance at WCW&#x27;s pay-per-view event Capital Combat, where he rescued Sting from The Four Horsemen.

===Home media===
The film was first released to VHS on December 13, 1990, and was later released to DVD in 1998. The film first received a Blu-ray release in 2011. VHS copies of &quot;RoboCop 2&quot; began with an anti-drug PSA starring an out-of-character Weller that announced the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America were where there was &quot;no pot, no pills, no crack, no smack, no coke — no exceptions.&quot;

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;RoboCop 2&quot; debuted as the second-highest-grossing film at the box office in its opening weekend. It went on to gross $45.7 million at the U.S. box office, and additional $22,505,000 from video rentals.

===Critical response===

&quot;RoboCop 2&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. While the special effects and action sequences are widely praised, a common complaint was that the film did not focus enough on RoboCop and his partner Lewis and that the film&#x27;s human story of the man trapped inside the machine was ultimately lost within a sea of violence.

In his &quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot; review, Roger Ebert wrote: &quot;Cain&#x27;s sidekicks include a violent, foul-mouthed young boy named Hob, who looks to be about 12 years old but kills people without remorse, swears like Eddie Murphy, and eventually takes over the drug business... The movie&#x27;s screenplay is a confusion of half-baked and unfinished ideas... the use of that killer child is beneath contempt.&quot;

The film &quot;reset&quot; RoboCop&#x27;s character by turning him back into the monotone-voiced peacekeeper seen early in the first film, despite his reclaiming his human identity and personality by the end of that film. Many were also critical of the child villain Hob; David Nusair of Reel Film Reviews stated: &quot;That the film asks us to swallow a moment late in the story that features Robo taking pity on an injured Hob is heavy-handed and ridiculous (we should probably be thankful the screenwriters didn&#x27;t have RoboCop say something like, &#x27;Look at what these vile drugs have done to this innocent boy&#x27;).&quot;

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Unlike &quot;RoboCop&quot;, a clever and original science-fiction film with a genuinely tragic vision of its central character, &quot;Robocop 2&quot; doesn&#x27;t bother to do anything new. It freely borrows the situation, characters and moral questions posed by the first film.&quot; She further adds: &quot;The difference between &quot;Robocop&quot; and its sequel, [...] is the difference between an idea and an afterthought.&quot; She also expressed her opinion about the Hob character: &quot;The aimlessness of &quot;Robocop 2&quot; runs so deep that after exploiting the inherent shock value of such an innocent-looking killer, the film tries to capitalize on his youth by also giving him a tearful deathbed scene.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;This ultraviolent, nihilistic sequel has enough technical dazzle to impress hardware fans, but obviously no one in the Orion front office told filmmakers that less is more.&quot; Peter Rainer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; panned the film.

Jay Scott, of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, was one of the few prominent critics who admired the film calling it a &quot;sleek and clever sequel. For fans of violent but clever action films, &quot;RoboCop 2&quot; may be the sultry season&#x27;s best bet: you get the gore of &quot;Total Recall&quot; and the satiric smarts of &quot;Gremlins 2: The New Batch&quot; in one high-tech package held together by modest B-movie strings. &quot;RoboCop 2&quot; alludes to classics of horror and science-fiction &quot;(Frankenstein&quot;, &quot;Metropolis&quot;, &quot;Westworld)&quot;, for sure, but it also evokes less rarefied examples of the same genres–&quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;, &quot;Godzilla&quot;, and that Z-movie about Hitler&#x27;s brain in a bottle. It&#x27;s ironic that the directorial coach of the first &quot;RoboCop&quot;, Paul Verhoeven, went on to &quot;Total Recall&quot;; couldn&#x27;t he see that the script for &quot;Robo 2&quot; was sleeker and swifter than Arnie&#x27;s cumbersome vehicle? His absence in the driver&#x27;s seat is happily unnoticed because Irvin Kershner, the engineer of sequels that often zip qualitatively past the originals (&quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;,&quot; The Return of a Man Called Horse&quot;, and the best Sean Connery–James Bond of all, &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;), has tuned-up the premise until it purrs.&quot;

Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively collected 40 reviews to give the film a score of 28%, with an average rating of 4.70/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;A less satisfying rehash that generally lives down to the negative stereotype of sequels, &quot;Robocop 2&quot; tries to deliver more of everything and ends up with less&quot;. On Metacritic the film has a score of 42 based on reviews from 22 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B−, on scale of A to F.

The film received attention in 2013 from news media, due to its plot predicting Detroit filing for bankruptcy in the future.

== Thematic analysis ==
Bryan Kristopowitz described &quot;RoboCop 2&quot; as a parody of its predecessor.

=== Politics and corporations ===
Kershner took the offer to direct &quot;RoboCop 2&quot;. &quot;RoboCop 2&quot; continues the first film&#x27;s critiques on American capitalism, corporate power and its resulting militarization and other perceived negative impacts; the city&#x27;s greedy politics continue to benefit only a few, while other citizens have to face problems of crime, pollution, and infrastructure dilapidation due to inadequate restructuring and police strikes. Unlike the predecessor which had a self-aware tone and was hopeful the human race would last due to its rebelliousness, &quot;RoboCop 2&quot;″s take on the corporate and political system is cynical, and more in the forefront of the story, with more staff of Omni-Consumer Products (including its CEO) becoming antagonists. It also includes a few humorous pokes at bleeding-heart liberalism, such as OCP recoding RoboCop into an environmentalist role model.

The creation of a second RoboCop to repeat the success of the original cyborg can be interpreted as a take on companies making their older products quickly out-of-date in order to keep selling new ones, and RoboCop 2&#x27;s uncontrolled murdering of humans showcases how corporate entities devalue human life to a variable in an equation. More mock advertisements are seen, such as the MagnaVolt security system that electrocutes car thieves, and the Sunblock 5000, a blue-and-green skincare product which can cause skin cancer itself to prevent getting skin cancer &quot;ever since we lost the ozone layer.&quot; Noonan&#x27;s idea behind Cain being a hippie was that a love for sex and drugs and hatred for law enforcement (common aspects of hippies) were negatively impacting a 1990s&#x27; Detroit.

=== Humanity and masculinity ===
&quot;RoboCop 2&quot; also elaborates on Officer Murphy&#x27;s remaining humanity and the tech&#x27;s impact on it, another reason Kershner wanted to direct; he found the conflict a symbol on real-life society becoming programmed and &quot;roboticized&quot; by outside forces unconsciously. Kershner&#x27;s intention with &quot;RoboCop 2&quot; was to focus more on human depth and emotions and less on violence than the first film: &quot;It&#x27;s really the violence of the soul, the violence of human interaction that counts, and that&#x27;s all there.&quot;

Weller summarized that the character, after &quot;finding out&quot; in the predecessor, is now &quot;reaching out for ways to return to who he was.&quot; A scene depicts RoboCop spying on his former wife&#x27;s home that brings back memories of his previous life; the camera presents from his point-of-view in these set of memories, which end with Murphy seeing his human face in a bathroom, changing his expression from a smile to frown, and match cutting back to the helmeted face of RoboCop in the police car. Fordham University social professor Maxwell Guttman suggests that while having memories doesn&#x27;t make RoboCop more human than any other regular cyborg, the addition of unnecessary, lengthy and conflicting directives by Dr. Juliette Faxx symbolizes how complicated human behavioral science is.

David Roche and Isabelle Schmitt-Pitiot interpreted mirror sequences in &quot;RoboCop 2&quot; and its predecessor as showing identity problems in the hypermasculine figure, mourning the loss of a &quot;natural&quot; masculine identity; while the first film&#x27;s sequence showcased a mixture of a fake human face and electronic parts on his head as him having a fragmented identity, the second film&#x27;s memory scene showcases two separate identities, where the real human one is no longer a part of him. The re-programming of RoboCop&#x27;s code and use of it for a different RoboCop also presents masculinity as changing, taking various forms, and revealing hypermasculinity to not be a good form in comparison to others.

== Impact ==
Serial killer Nathaniel White claimed to have found inspiration for his first murder while watching &quot;RoboCop 2&quot;: &quot;The first girl I killed was from a &quot;RoboCop&quot; movie... I seen him cut somebody&#x27;s throat then take the knife and slit down the chest to the stomach and left the body in a certain position. With the first person I killed I did exactly what I saw in the movie.&quot;

==Other media==
===Sequel===
A sequel film, &quot;RoboCop 3&quot;, was released in 1993, with Robert Burke replacing Peter Weller as RoboCop.

===Video game===
A video game set between &quot;RoboCop 2&quot; and &quot;RoboCop 3&quot;, &quot;&quot;, was released in 2023, with Peter Weller reprising his role.

=== Novelization ===
A mass market paperback novelization by Ed Naha, &quot;RoboCop 2: A Novel&quot;, was published by Jove Books. Marvel Comics produced a three-issue adaptation of the film by Alan Grant. Like the novelization, the comic book series includes scenes omitted from the finished movie.

===Comic books===

Frank Miller&#x27;s original screenplay for &quot;RoboCop 2&quot; was turned into a nine-part comic book series titled &quot;Frank Miller&#x27;s RoboCop&quot;. Critical reaction to the comic adaptation of the Miller script was mixed. Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the comic a &quot;D&quot; score, criticizing the &quot;tired story&quot; and lack of &quot;interesting action.&quot; A recap written for the pop culture humor website I-Mockery said: &quot;Having spent quite a lot of time with these comics over the past several days researching and writing this article, I can honestly say that it makes me want to watch the movie version of &quot;RoboCop 2&quot; again just so I can get the bad taste out of my mouth. Or prove to myself that the movie couldn&#x27;t be worse than this.&quot;

<doc id="1330222" wikidata="Q1500241" url="?curid=1330222" title="Ventrilo">
<text>Ventrilo (or Vent for short) is a proprietary VoIP software that includes text chat.

The Ventrilo client and server are both available as freeware for use with up to 8 people on the same server. Rented servers can maintain up to 400 people. The Ventrilo server is available under a limited license for Microsoft Windows and macOS and is accessible on FreeBSD Kopi, Solaris and NetBSD. The client is available for Windows and macOS. However, the macOS client is still unable to properly use most servers because of a lack of support for the sparsely used GSM codec. Flagship Industries does not offer a Linux Ventrilo client. Third party Ventrilo clients are available for mobile devices, such as Ventrilode for iPhone and Ventriloid for Android.

Ventrilo supports the GSM Full Rate codec and used to support the Speex codec, which Ventrilo 4.0.0 replaced with the Opus codec.

==Usage==
Ventrilo is sometimes used by gamers who use the software to communicate with other players on the same team of a multiplayer game, or for general chat. This usage inspired the 2006 smash single &quot;Vi sitter i Ventrilo och spelar DotA&quot; by Swedish artist Basshunter.

==Controversy==

Flagship Industries Inc. has been involved in several copyright infringement cases as plaintiff.

<doc id="1330224" wikidata="Q538296" url="?curid=1330224" title="Pancetta">
<text>Pancetta () is a salt-cured pork belly meat product in a category known as &quot;salume&quot;. In Italy, it is often used to add depth to soups and pasta.

==Uses==
For cooking, pancetta is often cut into cubes (&quot;cubetti di pancetta&quot;). In Italy, it is commonly served as a sliced meat, sliced thin and eaten raw. It can also be used in carbonara (although guanciale is generally regarded as more traditional). 

==Types==
The two basic types of pancetta are &quot;arrotolata&quot; (&#x27;rolled&#x27;) and &quot;stesa&quot; (&#x27;flat&#x27;). The &quot;arrotolata&quot;, salted, is mainly cut in thin slices and eaten raw as part of antipasti or simply as a component of a sandwich; the &quot;stesa&quot; is used chopped as an ingredient in many recipes or cut in thick strips that are usually eaten grilled. There is also a version of &quot;arrotolata&quot; to which &quot;coppa&quot; is added in the center of the roll (&quot;pancetta coppata&quot;).

The rolled type is typical of northern Italy, while the flattened type is typical of central and southern Italy.

While most pancetta is salt-cured and dried, &quot;pancetta affumicata&quot; is salt-cured and smoked, similar to bacon.

==Ingredients==
Most pancetta products are made using pork belly brined in a mixture of salt, dextrose, spices and spice extracts, sodium erythorbate, garlic, sugar, sodium nitrate, and/or sodium nitrite.

==Production process==
The pork belly skin is removed before the pork is salted and held in a tub of brine for 10–14 days in a low-temperature and high-humidity environment. The brine is usually composed of salt, nitrite, ascorbate, spices such as black pepper, chilli, garlic, juniper, and rosemary, and sometimes nitrate.

After salting and brining, the pork is rolled, with layers of fat on the outside surrounding a meaty core. The rolled pork is then tightly packed into nettings or other fibrous casings. Rolling produces the pancetta&#x27;s distinctive shape, while the casing prevents case hardening in the latter stages of the production process.

Following rolling and packing, the pork undergoes enzymatic reactions facilitated by exposure to a warm environment of 22–24 °C for 24 to 36 hours. It is simultaneously exposed to cold smokes for desirable colours and flavours and to prevent moulding.

Finally, the smoked pork is held at 12–14 °C and 72–75% relative humidity for 3–4 weeks for drying. The resulting pancetta retains approximately 70% of its original weight.

==Preservation and shelf life==
Pancetta is preserved by curing. Curing is done using a spice and salt mixture containing nitrates or nitrites, which act to extend the shelf life of cured meats. Nitrates help remove excess moisture from the pork, decreasing water activity and limiting available free water for the growth of spoilage-causing and pathogenic microorganisms. Sodium nitrites are used to prevent the growth of botulism-causing bacteria and listeria monocytogenes, as well as imparting desirable flavour and colour. Nitrates are said to act like time-released nitrites and are used in pancetta products that require longer periods of curing and drying.

Other constituents of the spice mixture also act to preserve the shelf life of pancetta—black pepper acts as an antibiotic, and sodium erythorbate is used as an antioxidant.

Pancetta kept in its original packaging can be stored for up to 12 months. After opening, it has a shelf life of around 2–3 weeks in the refrigerator and up to 3 months in the freezer.

==Nutritional value==
One 30-g serving of pancetta contains around 5.0 g of protein, 11.0 g of fat, and 20–25 mg of cholesterol. One serving comprises between 15 and 22 percent of the accepted daily value of fats. Despite its high portion of daily fat value, pancetta has a lower fat content than other bacon products.

A single serving of pancetta contains around 540 mg of sodium. Consumption of processed meats is reported to be the second largest source of dietary sodium consumption, with bacon products leading processed pork products in sodium content.

Pancetta contains trace amounts of carbohydrates and no dietary fibre. These values can vary depending on processing, curing, and cooking methods.

==Regulations==
In the European Union, the labelling of pancetta is regulated under the protected designation of origin (PDO) regime. Only pancetta produced in the Italian region of Calabria may be labelled as &quot;pancetta di Calabria.&quot;

In the United States, under the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the USDA, hormones are not allowed in hogs or poultry raised for food. Pork or poultry sold in the US must be labelled as hormone-free and include a statement saying that federal regulations prohibit the use of hormones.

Under Canadian regulations (C.R.C., Annex C.2), a cured meat product such as pancetta is an edible meat product prepared with salt with at least 100 ppm of sodium nitrate or potassium nitrate.

<text>is a Japanese broadcaster in Shizuoka. Its radio station is affiliated with Japan Radio Network (JRN) and National Radio Network (NRN), and its TV station is affiliated with JNN (Japan News Network).

==History==

After the establishment of the &quot;Three Radio Laws&quot; (Radio Law, Broadcasting Law, and Radio Supervisory Committee Establishment Law) in 1950, private broadcasting companies began to appear across Japan.At its first meeting in March 1951, several companies, politicians, and financial institutions elected Shuntaro Katsuta (the then vice president of Shinano Mainichi Shimbun) as the president of Shinano Broadcasting.On October 18 of the same year, they obtained a preparatory broadcast license. In July 1951, then Shizuoka Shimbun president Mitsunosuke Oishi also intended to apply for a private broadcasting license, but at that time other groups had already applied for a broadcasting license in the name of &quot;Shizuoka Broadcasting&quot;. With the help of the local financial circles, they finally agreed to change the &quot;Shizuoka Broadcasting&quot; to Shizuoka Shimbun as the main body, and obtained the broadcasting license in September 1952. On October 1 of the same year, Shizuoka Broadcasting was formally established and began broadcasting programs one month later on November 1. It was the 17th private radio station in Japan. As Radio Shizuoka, broadcasts started on November 1, 1952, as the seventeenth commercial radio station to open in Japan. Initially it broadcast on 1450kc, but on August 1, 1953, the station moved to 1400kc.

In September 1953, Shizuoka Broadcasting applied for a television broadcasting license, but it was not obtained until February 1958, five years later. On November 1, 1958, Shizuoka Broadcasting System began broadcasting television programs and was the 12th private television station overall in Japan. The following year, Shizuoka Broadcasting joined the JNN network and was able to significantly reduce the cost of delivering news images. According to a survey in May 1965, Shizuoka Broadcasting accounted for an average daily viewing share of 73.6% in Shizuoka Prefecture. After Shizuoka TV, the second private TV station in Shizuoka Prefecture, started broadcasting, in November 1971, Shizuoka Broadcasting still maintained this figure at 50.7%. In the early days of broadcasting, the Shizuoka Broadcasting Department&#x27;s broadcast time was only 5 hours and 23 minutes a day. In May 1963, Shizuoka Broadcasting Corporation began to broadcast television programs in the morning. Three years later, in October 1968, Shizuoka Broadcasting Television began to gradually implement all-day broadcasting. In May 1967, Shizuoka Broadcasting began broadcasting color TV programs for the first time.

The abbreviation, SBS, has been used since September 22, 1960. Color broadcasts started on September 26, 1965, for networked programming and on September 1, 1966, for local programming. On October 1, 1969, less than a year after TV Shizuoka signed on as most of Fuji TV&#x27;s shows moved to SUT as it joined FNN/FNS.

Shizuoka Broadcasting was initially located in the headquarters of Shizuoka Shimbun News Agency, but as business increased and the space gradually became insufficient, it was decided to build a new headquarters. In March 1970, the new headquarters of Shizuoka Broadcasting was completed. The building was designed by the famous architect Kenzo Tange. It has 18 floors above ground and 1 floor underground, with a total floor area of 33,000 square meters. It is the joint headquarters of Shizuoka Broadcasting and Shizuoka Shimbun. In August 1972 , on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the launch, Shizuoka Broadcasting System held the &quot;Shizuoka Carnival&quot; (フェスタしずおか) event and broadcast a live video of the event. In 1985, Shizuoka Broadcasting System and five other radio and television broadcasting companies in Shizuoka Prefecture visited Zhejiang Province, China, and six stations also jointly produced a documentary. It was the first attempt by Shizuoka stations to jointly produce a TV program. Starting in 1993, Shizuoka Broadcasting dispatched special correspondents to the JNN New York branch, also the first overseas correspondent of Shizuoka Broadcasting System.

In order to adapt to the equipment needs of the digital TV era, Shizuoka Broadcasting began building a broadcast center in February 2000 to serve as its new headquarters in the digital TV era. In April 2001, the broadcasting center was completed. It has 5 floors above ground and is 70 meters high when including the iron tower. It has a total floor area of 4,608 square meters and is connected to the main building by a sky bridge. Shizuoka Broadcasting launched the current trademark in 2003. On June 1, 2005, Shizuoka Broadcasting System began broadcasting digital television signals, becoming the first private television station in Shizuoka Prefecture to begin broadcasting digital television. On July 24, 2011, Shizuoka Broadcasting stopped broadcasting analog TV signals. In the same year, on October 3, Shizuoka Broadcasting began broadcasting programs on the Internet radio station Radiko.

<text>The Capture of [[Old Fort Erie|Fort Erie]] by American forces in 1814 was a battle in the War of 1812 between the United Kingdom and the United States. The British garrison was outnumbered but surrendered prematurely, in the view of British commanders.

==Background==
The United States shared a long border with British North America (present-day Canada) in 1814. During the war, the Americans launched several invasions into Upper Canada (present-day Ontario). One section of the border where this was easiest (because of communications and locally available supplies) was along the Niagara River. Fort Erie was the British post at the head of the river, near its source in Lake Erie.

In 1812, two American attempts to capture Fort Erie were bungled by Brigadier General Alexander Smyth. Bad weather or poor administration foiled the American efforts to cross the river.

In 1813, the Americans won the Battle of Fort George at the northern end of the Niagara River. The British abandoned the Niagara frontier and allowed Fort Erie to fall into American hands without a fight. The Americans failed to follow up their victory, and later in the year they withdrew most of their soldiers from the Niagara to furnish an ill-fated attack on Montreal. This allowed the British to recover their positions and to mount raids which led to the Capture of Fort Niagara and the devastation of large parts of the American side of the Niagara River.

==Battle==
For 1814, a new invasion of Upper Canada was planned under the command of Major General Jacob Brown. Originally aimed at Kingston on Lake Ontario, it was switched to the Niagara because British ships controlled Lake Ontario for the first six months of 1814.
Because American troops were already concentrated at Buffalo and Black Rock, the attack was to be launched across the southern part of the Niagara frontier. Fort Erie was the first objective that stood in the way, which required its capture. Lieutenant General Gordon Drummond, the British commander in Upper Canada, hoped that the garrison at Fort Erie could at least buy him enough time against the American invasion to concentrate his forces. Major Thomas Buck was given command of the fort with a garrison of 137 British soldiers.

Brown&#x27;s force crossed into Canada on July 3. Brigadier General Winfield Scott landed a mile and a half (3 km) north of the fort with a brigade of regulars while it was still dark. Another brigade under Eleazar Wheelock Ripley crossed the head of the river to the south of the fort, although they were delayed by fog. Meanwhile, New York militia demonstrated opposite Chippawa to distract the British troops in the area.

As Scott&#x27;s and Ripley&#x27;s forces approached Fort Erie, Buck fired only a few shots at the Americans from the fort&#x27;s cannon and then surrendered. The Americans had captured an important fort at little cost. The fort&#x27;s garrison had bought the British little time and Buck was later court martialled for his hasty surrender.

==Aftermath==

From their new base at Fort Erie, Brown next marched up the Niagara River and met the British at the Battle of Chippawa. The British commander at Chippawa, Major General Phineas Riall, believed that the garrison of Fort Erie was still holding out, which contributed to his decision to launch a hasty and ill-fated attack.

Following the Battle of Lundy&#x27;s Lane in July, British forces under the command of Gordon Drummond advanced and unsuccessfully besieged the fort. However, American commanders decided to abandon the fort, which was evacuated and blown up in November 1814.

<text>Patrick Jamel Crayton (born April 7, 1979) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL) for the Dallas Cowboys and San Diego Chargers. He played college football for the Northwestern Oklahoma State Rangers.

==High school==
Crayton attended DeSoto High School, where he played as a wide receiver, quarterback, running back and return specialist. He accepted a scholarship from Northwestern Oklahoma State University, where he was a wide receiver in his first three seasons, before switching to quarterback as a senior.

==College career==
A four-time all-conference selection, Crayton saw time as a punt returner, kickoff returner, quarterback and wide receiver at NWOSU. In 44 games during his Ranger career, Crayton averaged 19.0 yards-per-catch and scored 17 touchdowns at receiver, rushed for 17 touchdowns, returned 72 punts for a 20.8-yard average and ten touchdowns, returned two kickoffs for scores and passed for 21 touchdowns with eight interceptions. In four years, he amassed 5,688 all-purpose yards, including 3,718 yards in total offense and 46 touchdowns.

As both a sophomore and junior, Crayton earned All-America honorable mention and All-Central States Football League first team honors at receiver. As a sophomore, he led the nation with 19 punt returns for 508 yards (26.7 avg.) and three touchdowns.

As a senior, he earned Little All-America second team and CSFL Offensive Player of the Year honors starting at quarterback while also handling kickoff returns, punt returns and logging time at wide receiver.

==Professional career==

===Dallas Cowboys===
Crayton was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the seventh round (216th overall) of the 2004 NFL draft. He was declared inactive for the first 3 weeks of the season and was waived on October 1. He was signed to the practice squad on October 4 and was later promoted to the active roster on October 29.

In 2005, he had an unexpected success, following injuries to wide receivers higher up the depth chart. He outperformed Quincy Morgan in preseason, leading to Morgan&#x27;s release. In his first game of the season, Crayton continued his solid play with six receptions for 89 yards and one touchdown. However, he sustained a broken ankle on October 16 against the New York Giants, and was unable to return to full form until December 24.

The 2006 season brought Crayton back to renewed prominence, especially when the Cowboys switched quarterbacks mid-season to Tony Romo. he recorded his first 100-yard game against the Arizona Cardinals while filling in for an injured Terry Glenn. Head Coach Bill Parcells had said that Crayton possessed the best hands on the team. In the Wildcard playoff game against the Seattle Seahawks, Crayton had a diving touchdown reception in a losing effort.

In 2007, he filled in at the second receiver spot while Terry Glenn was rehabbing from a knee injury. On December 27, Crayton was rewarded for his efforts with a four-year contract extension worth $14 million. Crayton finish with 697 receiving yards, 7 touchdowns and had developed a reputation around the league as a vocal player. In the divisional round, where Dallas lost to the eventual Super Bowl XLII Champions, New York Giants, he dropped a pass that would have resulted in a critical first down if not a touchdown.

In 2008, Crayton started seven-of-16 games played and was replaced by Roy Williams in the starting position after he arrived from the Detroit Lions in week 5. By the end of the season Crayton had caught 39 passes for 550 yards and four touchdowns - which tied for second on the team with Jason Witten. He also finished with 15 punt returns for 143 yards while sharing that role with Adam &quot;Pacman&quot; Jones.

In 2009, he was again the number two receiver alongside Williams after the Cowboys released Terrell Owens. He would return to a backup role after Miles Austin had a break-out game against the Kansas City Chiefs. Crayon started 6 out of the 16 games and caught 37 passes for 622 yards, averaging a career-high 16.8 yards per reception, including a career long 80 yard touchdown reception in Week one against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He had 5 touchdowns receptions (third on the team) and scored his first career punt return touchdown in week 7 at Atlanta, which earned him NFC Special Teams Player of the Week honors. He followed it up with his second touchdown return in a week later against the Seattle Seahawks. Crayton finished with 36 punt returns for 437 yards and 2 touchdowns (tied with DeSean Jackson for first in the league punt return touchdowns) with a long of 82 yards which are all career highs.

On September 3, 2010, Crayton was traded to the San Diego Chargers in exchange for a 2011 seventh round draft pick (#220-Shaun Chapas), after his agent requested his release following the team selection of Dez Bryant in the first round.

===San Diego Chargers===
In 2010, he dislocated his left wrist in the second quarter of the tenth game of the season against the Denver Broncos, after making 3 receptions for 105 yards and one touchdown. He was declared inactive for the last 6 games, finishing with 28 receptions for 514 yards and 1 touchdown. The next year, he played in 14 games and was used mainly as a punt returner. He recorded 23 receptions for 248 yards and was not re-signed.

===New Orleans Saints===
On August 12, 2013, the New Orleans Saints signed him as a free agent after being out of football for a year. He was released on August 19.

<doc id="1330250" wikidata="Q27686509" url="?curid=1330250" title="Dracaena sanderiana">
<text>Dracaena sanderiana is a species of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae, native to Central Africa. It was named after the German–English gardener Henry Frederick Conrad Sander (1847–1920). The plant is commonly marketed as &quot;lucky bamboo,&quot; which has become one of its common names.

==Names==
Common names include Sander&#x27;s dracaena, ribbon dracaena, lucky bamboo, curly bamboo, Chinese water bamboo, Goddess of Mercy&#x27;s plant, Belgian evergreen. It is also called the ribbon plant, although the same common name is sometimes used for &quot;Chlorophytum comosum&quot; (also known as the &quot;spider plant&quot;). While the word &quot;bamboo&quot; occurs in several of this plant&#x27;s common names, &quot;D. sanderiana&quot; is of an entirely different taxonomic order from true bamboos – though it is worth noting that this plant and true bamboos both fall under the monocot clade. Despite several of its common names that suggest it is from China or Belgium, it is a native West African species. &quot;Dracaena sanderiana&quot; is also often confused with &quot;Dracaena braunii&quot;, a plant from coastal West Africa with flowers 5 times shorter than those of &quot;D. sanderiana&quot;.

==Description==
A perennial herb reaching a height of , the plant has slightly twisted, gray-green leaves which grow to around . Its fleshy stem distinguishes it from bamboo. Over time, the plant&#x27;s stem becomes unsteady with the added weight of new growth. Regular trimmings are needed to ensure the shape of this plant stays neat and manageable while it grows. 

==Cultivation==
&quot;Dracaena sanderiana&quot; and its related varieties are popular houseplants. It is a suitable plant for confined spaces, and it does very well in indirect sunlight or partial shade as direct sunlight often causes its leaves to burn or yellow. The ideal temperature range for &quot;D. sanderiana&quot; is from . It requires average warmth, adequate light, and regular watering with dry periods in between if planted in soil. It tolerates dry air, but because it is a tropical plant, it does best in higher humidity areas or when given regular mistings. When planted indoors, it stays a smaller, more compact size while growing upwards, leading to its bamboo-like appearance. In contrast, if planted in the ground, it loses its bamboo-like look and it would fill with a leaf-like shape like other dragon trees. When it comes to light, lucky bamboo prefers bright, filtered sunlight, such as what is found under a rainforest canopy. Avoid direct sunlight as it will scorch the leaves. It can be propagated by cutting a part of the stem just above a node (the &quot;rings&quot; around the plant&#x27;s stem from which offshoots grow). Cuttings can be made year round.

<text>Bernard Berrian (born December 27, 1980) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Fresno State Bulldogs, earning first-team All-American honors in 2001. Berrian was selected by the Chicago Bears in the third round of the 2004 NFL draft. He also played in the NFL for the Minnesota Vikings.

==Early life==
Berrian was born in Spain, and grew up in Winton, California, while both of his parents served at Castle Air Force Base. Berrian attended Atwater High School in Atwater, California, where he played football and basketball and ran track. He was named Modesto Bee player of the year in 1998. Cal High All-Northern California team member. He was known as an explosive two-way starter for Atwater High School, which went 13–1 his senior year, after he caught 53 passes for 1,276 yards and 16 touchdowns. In track &amp; field, he competed in the 200- and 400-meter dashes, recording times of 22.6 in the 200m and 50.6 in the 400m.

==Professional career==
===Chicago Bears===
The Chicago Bears selected Berrian with the 78th pick in the third round of the 2004 NFL draft.

Berrian spent a majority of his early years with the Bears as a back-up wide receiver and return specialist. His playtime increased during the 2005 Chicago Bears season, but an injury kept him sidelined for a portion of the season. Berrian returned to play during the Bears&#x27; NFC Divisional game against the Carolina Panthers, but eventually he was forced to leave after sustaining an injury.

During the early half of the 2006 Chicago Bears season, Berrian emerged as one of the Bears&#x27;s most productive receivers and sharpest deep-threat weapons. On November 5, 2006, Berrian suffered an injury to his ribs during a game against the Miami Dolphins. According to Berrian, he sustained the injury after hitting the ground during the very first play of the game. Berrian returned from the injury after missing only one game, but struggled at times. His surrogate, Mark Bradley, momentarily became the Bears&#x27; deep threat. Berrian finished the regular season as the Bears&#x27; second leading wide receiver, only a few catches behind team leader Muhsin Muhammad.

During the 2006 playoffs, in the divisional round game against the Seattle Seahawks, Berrian caught five passes for 105 yards, including a 68-yard touchdown pass. The Chicago Bears went on to win 27–24 in overtime. In the NFC championship game against the New Orleans Saints, Berrian led the Bears with five receptions for 85 yards. He also made a clutch, 33-yard diving touchdown reception behind a jumping Fred Thomas, giving the Bears an eleven-point lead, which contributed to their 39–14 victory. Well after the season&#x27;s conclusion, the catch was named one of the Bears&#x27; top ten plays in 2006. Berrian played in Super Bowl XLI against the Indianapolis Colts, where he caught four passes for 38 yards. Berrian was in the last year of his contract and the Bears chose not to put a franchise tag on him. The Bears had to wait until the Free Agency period on February 29, 2008, for Berrian to become an unrestricted free agent and negotiate a new contract.
===Minnesota Vikings===
On March 1, 2008, Berrian signed a six-year, $42 million contract with the Minnesota Vikings that included $16 million in guaranteed money.

His first touchdown as a Viking was against the New Orleans Saints which tied up the game 27–27 they would later win that game 30–27. He led all wideouts with 102 yards off a career playoff-high nine catches. He also caught an 86-yard catch and run against the Lions. On November 30, 2008, in a game against the Chicago Bears, Berrian caught a 99-yard touchdown pass from Gus Frerotte, tying an NFL record for the longest pass from scrimmage. On December 14, 2008, he returned an 82-yard punt against the Arizona Cardinals after a quick three and out on their opening drive. He also caught a 49-yard touchdown pass in a 28–21 victory over the Houston Texans. Berrian had the highest average per. catch that NFL season with 20.1 yards per catch. Berrian finished the season with 48 catches, 964 yards and 7 touchdowns. (50 catches for exactly 1,000 yards and 7 touchdowns including the playoffs.)
In 2009, with the acquisition of 20-year veteran quarterback Brett Favre, Berrian became one of the deep threats of the wide receiver core along with Sidney Rice, Percy Harvin, and Visanthe Shiancoe. He struggled with a hamstring injury that bothered him all season long. He ended the season with 55 catches for 618 yards and 4 touchdowns, 2 touchdowns in the series with the Green Bay Packers, and 2 in the games with the Seattle Seahawks and Baltimore Ravens. In the NFC Championship, Berrian recorded 9 receptions for 102 yards.

In 2010, the 7-year veteran finished with 28 receptions, for 252 yards, and no touchdowns. It was his lowest season in his entire career. His best performance of the season came against the Arizona Cardinals where he caught 9 passes for 91 yards.

On October 24, 2011, Berrian was released by the Vikings.

==Charity work==
In November 2008, Bernard pledged to donate up to $10,000 to Second Harvest Heartland, Minnesota&#x27;s largest hunger-relief organization, to provide turkeys to hungry inner-city families for the holiday season. He donated $5,000 to Second Harvest Heartland to provide turkeys to local inner-city families for Thanksgiving.
Berrian has expressed interest in participating in additional community outreach programs.

Berrian was a contestant on NBC&#x27;s Minute to Win It on September 7, 2010, where he was playing to win money for the Second Harvest Heartland.

==Personal life==
During a Monday Night Football appearance, Muhsin Muhammad revealed that Berrian&#x27;s nickname is &quot;B-twice&quot;. However, in a later interview with Fox News Chicago, Berrian stated his teammates also call him, &quot;California Cool&quot;. ChicagoBears.com&#x27;s columnists and announcers also refer to Berrian as the &quot;Silent Assassin&quot;. He is friends with Chad Johnson and appeared occasionally on his dating show .

In 2015, Berrian was inducted into the Fresno County Athletic Hall of Fame.

<doc id="1330262" wikidata="Q1637536" url="?curid=1330262" title="Clelia (snake genus)">
<text>Clelia is a genus of snakes, one of three genera containg species with the common name mussurana or musurana (Portuguese: muçurana). &quot;Clelia&quot; is a genus of large snakes in the subfamily Dipsadidae of the family Colubridae. The genus is native to Central America and South America, and species of &quot;Clelia&quot; are found from southern Mexico to Brazil. They specialize in ophiophagy, i.e., they attack and eat other snakes. Seven species are recognized as being valid. They have other popular names in various countries, such as in Central America and cribo on some Caribbean islands (though they are not related to &quot;Drymarchon)&quot;.

==Species==
The genus &quot;Clelia&quot; contains the following species which are currently recognized as being valid.
*&quot;Clelia clelia&quot; – black mussurana, windward cribo 
*&quot;Clelia equatoriana&quot; – equatorial mussarana
*&quot;Clelia errabunda&quot; – Underwood&#x27;s mussurana, Saint Lucia cribo (extinct)
*&quot;Clelia hussami&quot; 
*&quot;Clelia langeri&quot; 
*&quot;Clelia plumbea&quot; 
*&quot;Clelia scytalina&quot; – Mexican snake eater

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Clelia&quot;.

==Description==
Mussuranas have an average total length (including tail) of about , but may grow up to about . When young, the dorsal color is light pink, which becomes lead-blue when adult. The ventral color is whitish yellow. They have 10 to 15 teeth at the front of the upper jaw, which are followed, after a space, by two enlarged grooved teeth at the back of the mouth (opisthoglyphous teeth) which they use to grasp the head of the attacked snake and push it into the gullet. Then they coil around the prey, killing it by constriction (this is the reason these species are called pseudoboas). Ingestion of the whole body follows. The long body of the ingested snake is compressed as a wave in order to fit into the mussuranas&#x27; gastrointestinal system.

==Reproduction==
Mussaranas are oviparous.

==Venom==
Although mussuranas are rear-fanged and produce a mild venom, these snakes pose no danger to humans. Even when handled they usually do not bite. Very few envenomations have been reported and they were not fatal. Mussuranas are immune to the venom of the snakes they feed upon, particularly the smaller Central and South American pit vipers of the genus &quot;Bothrops&quot;. They are not immune to the venom of the coral snake, though. In the absence of other snakes, mussuranas can feed also on small mammals. It has been reported that at least some captive specimens will accept only live snakes as prey.

==Habitat and behavior==
The preferred habitat of mussuranas is dense ground-level vegetation. They are diurnal.

==Conservation==
In some regions, farmers keep mussuranas as pets in order to keep their living environment clear of pit vipers, which claim annually a large number of deaths of domestic animals, like cattle. In the 1930s a Brazilian plan to breed and release large numbers of mussuranas for the control of pit vipers was tried but did not work. The Butantan Institute in São Paulo, which specializes in the production of antivenins, erected a statue of &quot;Clelia clelia&quot; as its symbol and a tribute to its usefulness in combating venomous snake bites. Mussuranas&#x27; immunity to bothropic venom was studied by the Brazilian scientist Vital Brazil in the 1920s. Mussuranas are increasingly rare due to the disappearance of their prey and have disappeared in many habitats.

<text>Sir John Craig Eaton (April 28, 1876 – March 30, 1922) was a Canadian businessman and a member of the prominent Eaton family.

==Life and career==

He was born in Toronto, Ontario, the youngest son of department store magnate Timothy Eaton and his wife, Margaret Wilson Beattie. He married Flora McCrea in 1901, and they had six children: Timothy Craig, John David, Edgar Allison, Gilbert McCrea, Florence Mary, and Evlyn (adopted).

In 1905, weeks after laying the final stone at the new store at the corner of Portage and Donald in Winnipeg, John Craig (aka &#x27;Jack&#x27;) participated in several automobile races, successfully lowering the 5-mile record driving a Packard. He didn&#x27;t appear to race again after 1905, but his grandson, George Eaton inherited not only the family business, but also the racing gene. 

Upon the death of his father in 1907, he inherited five million dollars and the T. Eaton Company. He became its president at this time, and the company flourished under his control. He greatly influenced the company and expanded the stores nationally.

He built Ardwold, an enormous residence of 50 rooms in Toronto, beginning in 1909 and finishing in 1911. He also acquired a resort home from his mother in Oakville, Ontario, called the Raymar Estate (the estate has since disappeared).

In 1915, Eaton was made a Knight Bachelor in recognition of his participation in the war effort. He thus became Sir John Craig Eaton, and his wife was known as Lady Eaton.

He was a noted philanthropist. Perhaps his most lavish public contribution was the gift, made together with his mother, of land and funds for a large Methodist church on St Clair Avenue in Toronto. Named Timothy Eaton Memorial Church after his father, it was constructed in 1912–14. He also made many donations to Omemee, Ontario, the home town of his wife Flora. These donations included Coronation Hall (1911), and the manse and organ for Trinity United Church.

He died of pneumonia following influenza in 1922 at the age of 45, and his cousin Robert Young Eaton became president of the company until Sir John&#x27;s son, John David Eaton, reached an appropriate age to take over. Sir John&#x27;s grandson, John Craig Eaton II, served as chairman of Eaton&#x27;s in its later years.

<doc id="1330266" wikidata="Q1378329" url="?curid=1330266" title="Generic brand">
<text>Generic brands of consumer products (often supermarket goods) are distinguished by the absence of a brand name, instead identified solely by product characteristics and identified by plain, usually black-and-white packaging. Generally they imitate more expensive branded products, competing on price. They are similar to &quot;store brand&quot; or &quot;private label&quot; products sold under a brand particular to the merchant, but typically priced lower and perceived as lower quality. The term off brand is sometimes used. In the United Kingdom, these products are often referred to as &quot;own brand&quot; items.

== Characteristics ==
Generics may be manufactured by less prominent companies or manufactured on the same production line as branded products. Generic brand products may be of similar quality as a branded product, and are commonly made from the standard ingredients used for branded products.

Without the costs of marketing individual products, generic brands are priced lower than branded products. They are preferred by customers for whom price or value-for-money is the priority. They are generally more popular in recessionary times, when consumers&#x27; purchasing power is lower, putting them on the lookout for value-for-money products; they experienced a period of popularity in the United States in the late 1970s and early 1980s, during a period of high price inflation.

Consumer perceptions about generic brands differ widely. A generic brand skin care product may have a consumer unsure about its &quot;health and safety&quot; quotient. This implies that there are certain product categories more aligned to generic brands. Examples include over-the-counter medications, cereal and gasoline among others.

The German discount supermarket Aldi is known for their own brand goods and absence of branded goods with minor exceptions. 

There has been a growth in demand for generic brand goods since the late-2000s, and the stigma of the absence of a brand name is declining with time; as food inflation reaches new highs in 2022, and sales of branded food products decline.

==In popular media==
The 1984 film &quot;Repo Man&quot; highlighted the then-new trend of generic brands with a running sight gag of products labelled generically, such as a beer can labelled &#x27;Beer&#x27;, a can labelled &#x27;Drink&#x27;, and a can of food labelled &#x27;Food&#x27;.

<text>Hollywood Babylon is a book by avant-garde filmmaker Kenneth Anger, which details the purported scandals of famous Hollywood denizens from the 1900s to the 1950s. The book was banned shortly after it was first published in the U.S. in 1965, and remained unavailable until reprinted ten years later. Upon its second release in 1975, &quot;The New York Times&quot; said of it, &quot;If a book such as this can be said to have charm, it lies in the fact that here is a book without one single redeeming merit.&quot; &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; described Anger&#x27;s book as &quot;essentially a work of fiction. There is no doubt that many—if not all—of the stories Anger shares in his slim bible have no merit.&quot; Film historian Kevin Brownlow repeatedly criticized the book, citing Anger as saying his research method was &quot;mental telepathy, mostly&quot;.

== Contents ==
Originally published in French in 1959 by J.J. Pauvert (Paris) as Hollywood Babylone, the first U.S. edition of &quot;Hollywood Babylon&quot; was published in 1965 by Associated Professional Services of Phoenix, Arizona. A second U.S. edition was published by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;′s Straight Arrow Press and distributed by Simon &amp; Schuster, released in 1975 after a series of copyright conflicts.

The book details alleged scandals of Hollywood stars from the silent era through to the 1960s, including Charles Chaplin, Lupe Vélez, Mary Nolan, Rudolph Valentino, Marie Prevost, Mary Astor, Wallace Reid, Olive Thomas, Jeanne Eagels, Thelma Todd, Errol Flynn, Frances Farmer, Juanita Hansen, Mae Murray, Alma Rubens, John Gilbert, Barbara La Marr, Ramon Novarro, Jean Harlow, Carole Landis, Lana Turner, Judy Garland, and Marilyn Monroe.

&quot;Hollywood Babylon&quot; also features chapters on the Fatty Arbuckle–Virginia Rappe scandal, the murder of William Desmond Taylor, the Hollywood blacklist, the murder of Sharon Tate, and the &quot;Confidential&quot; magazine lawsuits.

== Criticisms ==

=== Exploitation ===
The book&#x27;s 1975 edition featured graphic images such as the scene of the traffic accident that killed Jayne Mansfield, a photograph of Carole Landis after her suicide, images of director and screenwriter Paul Bern following his suicide, a photograph of Lewis Stone as he lay dying on a sidewalk, and uncensored images of the Black Dahlia&#x27;s mutilated corpse.

=== Falsehoods ===
Although many of Anger&#x27;s claims have been denounced as untrue since the book&#x27;s initial publication, it is nonetheless responsible for many oft-quoted urban legends. For example, it claimed that Clara Bow engaged in sex with the entire USC football team, including a young John Wayne, a fallacy which has been debunked several times. Bow&#x27;s sons considered suing Anger at the time of the book&#x27;s second release.

The book also claimed that Lupe Vélez was found drowned in her own vomit with her head in a toilet after she committed suicide by swallowing more than 500 sleeping tablets. There was no basis to the story; in 2013, the first publication of a death photo showed Vélez had been found on her bedroom floor.

Other debunked urban legends started by the book include claims that impoverished film star Marie Prevost&#x27;s body was partially eaten by her dachshund after she died in her Hollywood apartment in 1937, and that Jayne Mansfield was decapitated in her fatal 1967 car accident.

Anger acquired the &quot;lurid, grotesque, and often surreal&quot; images that populate the book from a variety of sources such as Hollywood still gallaries, newspapers, magazines, police archives, or his own photography collection. Both unintentionally and intentionally by taking artistic license, Anger misattributes or miscaptions a number of them. In the chapter covering the Fatty Arbuckle-Virigina Rappe scandal, a woman photographed in a mourning outfit is misidentified as Rappe&#x27;s friend and witness to the incident Maude Delmont, when she is actually Arbuckle&#x27;s wife Minta Durfee.

The fallacies, myths, and exaggerations of &quot;Hollywood Babylon&quot; were the focus of season 10 of Karina Longworth&#x27;s podcast &quot;You Must Remember This&quot;: &quot;Fake News: Fact Checking &quot;Hollywood Babylon&quot;&quot;.

== Sequels ==
Hollywood Babylon II was published in 1984. It was greatly expanded in format but was not as well received as the first book. It covered stars from the 1920s to the 1970s.

For years Anger said he intended to write a &quot;Hollywood Babylon III&quot;, and in a 2010 interview he claimed that the book had been finished but was placed on hold, explaining, &quot;The main reason I didn&#x27;t bring it out was that I had a whole section on Tom Cruise and the Scientologists. I&#x27;m not a friend of the Scientologists.&quot; In 2008, a book titled &quot;Hollywood Babylon: It&#x27;s Back!&quot; was published. Written by Darwin Porter and Danforth Prince, the book had no participation or association with Anger. Anger was reportedly so upset he placed a curse on the authors. (He was a self-proclaimed magician of the school of Thelema.)

In 1971 the movie &quot;Hollywood Babylon&quot; was released starring Uschi Digart as Marlene Dietrich, in which scenes from the book were reenacted.

A television series based upon the books was produced for syndication in 1992–1993. Hosted by Tony Curtis, the series featured dramatic reenactments of stories from Anger&#x27;s books, augmented by veteran actor Curtis relating Hollywood-based anecdotes of his own.

<doc id="1330277" wikidata="Q1136961" url="?curid=1330277" title="Coulis">
<text>A coulis ( ) is a form of thin sauce made from puréed and strained vegetables or fruits. A vegetable coulis is commonly used on meat and vegetable dishes, and it can also be used as a base for soups or other sauces. Fruit coulis are most often used on desserts. Raspberry coulis, for example, is especially popular with poached apples or Key lime pie. Tomato coulis may be used to add flavor to other sauces or served on its own (either cold or hot). 

The term comes from Old French &quot;coleïs&quot;, meaning flowing or running.

The way of making coulis varies with the type of fruit or vegetable used: it is possible to simply mash raspberries and strawberries through a strainer with a spoon, while ripe pears and melons are usually pureed in a blender prior to straining; apples have to be cooked first. Depending on the consistency of the puree, either a chinois (for the softest purees), food mill, or drum sieve (for the hardest ones) can be used for straining. Reduction of coulis (to strengthen its sweetness and flavor) can be difficult, as the sauce may acquire a jam-like taste when heated, so sometimes vacuum evaporation is used to boil the mixture at a lower temperature.

== Additives ==
While fruit coulis can be used with its natural flavor, a small amount of fruit brandy (Kirsch, framboise, ) is occasionally added when under-ripe fruits are used. Desserts that are not very sweet, like brioche, can benefit from coulis with added sugar, while the taste of ice cream, on the other hand, improves with a contrasting, unsweetened sauce.

== Older uses ==
In its current meaning, the term is fairly new in the English language, with widespread use, alongside Nouvelle cuisine, since the 1980s (Merriam-Webster Dictionary provides 1952 as the first recorded use in the modern sense). However, originally with the spelling &quot;cullis&quot;, the word has six hundred years of history in the English language. The &quot;cullis&quot; was derived from an Old French &quot;coleis&quot; (originally from , &quot;to strain&quot;), the French word defining straining, pouring, flowing, or sliding (the meaning is preserved in English &quot;colander&quot;). The term was used to denote strained broth, originally likely made from chicken, later also from meat and fish. The cullis was used as a sauce or as a base for other sauces.

<text>Domanick Williams (born Davis; October 1, 1980), known during the majority of his playing career as Domanick Davis, is an American former professional football player who was a running back for three seasons with the Houston Texans of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for four seasons with the LSU Tigers.

==Career==

Davis played college football for the LSU Tigers. In his four-year career there, he rushed for 2056 yards and 20 touchdowns, including four touchdowns in the 2002 Sugar Bowl.

Davis was drafted by Houston in the fourth round of the 2003 NFL draft. He was named the 2003 Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Year, an award created in 2002, in which fans vote online from a pool of five candidates to determine the winner. He rushed for 1,000+ yards in his first two seasons in the NFL (2003 and 2004) while scoring 22 touchdowns. As a result, he received a contract extension before the start of the 2005 season. Prior to the extension, Davis was scheduled to make $385,000 in 2005. The extension called for a payout of $22 million over the life of the deal, with $8 million in guaranteed money.

In 2005, Davis rushed for 976 yards in the first 11 games before suffering a knee injury and being placed on injured reserve. He did not play during the 2006 season, and was released by the Texans on March 22, 2007.

==NFL career statistics==
==Personal life==
He changed his surname from Davis to Williams in late 2006.
&quot;(on changing his name from Domanick Davis) “And it will be number 31, Domanick Williams. I just had to make a change. I wasn’t really a Davis the whole time, but I have kids of my own and I needed to do what was right.”&quot;

&quot;(more on the name change) “I just changed Davis to Williams. I wasn’t really a (Davis). It was my older brother’s Dad’s last name and whatever happened I ended up with Davis. So now that I have kids of my own, a little boy and a little girl, ‘Spike’ (Domanick, Jr.) and Lina, I have to change my name to what it really is, and it’s Williams.”&quot;

<text>The Flats is a neighborhood located in the southeastern end of Woodbridge, Connecticut, in the West River valley area that runs between the hilly western part of town and the rock formation known as West Rock. The West River valley continues into the city of New Haven. The Flats is bounded on the northeast by West Rock Ridge, on the south by the Amity neighborhood of New Haven, and on the northwest by an incline in elevation above which lies the highlands of Woodbridge. This region was called “Shushuck” by Native Americans.

The Flats is Woodbridge&#x27;s main commercial section, with mixed-use residential, recreational and retail zoning. CT Route 63 and CT Route 69 are the primary roads in this neighborhood, which form major north–south arterials between New Haven and northern towns like Bethany and the Naugatuck River Valley region beyond. CT Route 15/The Wilbur Cross Parkway runs east-west through The Flats to intersect with CT-63 and CT-69.

<text>Aviv Geffen (, born 10 May 1973) is an Israeli rock musician, singer, and songwriter. In addition to his solo career, Geffen is a founding member of the band Blackfield, he was also the global music director for WeWork.

Geffen was and is extremely popular among Israeli youth who were known during the 1990s as the &quot;Moonlight Children&quot; (). Politically, he associates with the Israeli left. His music deals with subjects such as love, peace, death, suicide, politics, and the army (in particular, the IDF). He is often criticized for singing about the IDF while not having served, though he was discharged for medical reasons.

== Childhood ==
Aviv Geffen was born in Ramat Gan and raised in Beit Yitzhak. He is the son of the author and poet Yehonatan Geffen and actress . His sister is actress Shira Geffen. He was named after his late grandmother, Aviva Geffen. 

Geffen&#x27;s first public performance was in 1984, in the Israeli youth program &quot;Shminiyot Ba&#x27;Avir&quot; [&quot;somersaults&quot;] on the Israeli Channel 1, in which he sang the song &quot;You&#x27;re Only 40 Years Old&quot; for which his sister wrote the lyrics and he composed the melody. In 1987 Geffen participated in the amateur film &quot;Hamitpaḥat&quot; &quot;The Handkerchief&quot;, for which he wrote and sang the song &quot;Ima&quot; &quot;Mom&quot;. 

Although a great-nephew (via his grandmother Aviva) of the legendary Israeli General and former Defense Minister, Moshe Dayan, Geffen refused enlistment in the mandatory Israeli military service, claiming conscientious objector status. He had previously advocated that Israeli youth should likewise refuse military service and criticized Israel for being &quot;a paranoid country where people think they always have to be strong.&quot;

== Career ==
=== 1990s ===
In 1990, Geffen recorded his first song, &quot;Friend&quot; [&quot;chaver&quot;], together with the band &quot;Cats in the Piping&quot;. In 1992, he released his first album, &quot;Ze Rak Or Hayareach&quot; [&quot;It&#x27;s Only the Moonlight&quot;], all of whose tracks were written and the music composed by Geffen himself.

Also in 1992, he played a part in the teenage television series &quot;A Matter of Time&quot;. That year, he also wrote a song for the Israeli movie &quot;The Beach Boys&quot;. Geffen performed in clubs with his band HaTauyót [&quot;The Mistakes&quot;] (the Hebrew name is purposefully misspelled in two places).

In 1993, Geffen released his second album, &quot;Achshav Me&#x27;unan&quot; [&quot;It&#x27;s Cloudy Now&quot;], which went gold in the same year and expressed his generation&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the Israeli government. It was produced by Moshe Levi and Ofer Meiri, who created the typical Geffen sound. The title track &quot;It&#x27;s Cloudy Now&quot; was followed by the question that many Israeli teenagers asked with Geffen – &quot;Do you want change?&quot;

In 1994, Geffen released his third album, &quot;Aviv Geffen III&quot;, a concept album about negative effects on someone who was forced to join the army, the album did not mark a change in Geffen&#x27;s sound. The production was handled by Geffen and Lior Tevet. The album featured the major hit &quot;Ha&#x27;im Lehiot Bach Mehohav?&quot; [&quot;Should I Be In Love With You?&quot;], which was promoted by a video and followed the success of &quot;Achshav Me&#x27;unan&quot;.

In his next album, &quot;Shumakom&quot; [&quot;Nowhere&quot;], Geffen took charge of the production, albeit with help from Reuven Shapira (as sound engineer), and producer Moshe Levi. Geffen again wrote all the lyrics and music.

As a political activist, Geffen also expressed the hope for peace with Israel&#x27;s neighbors.

On 4 November 1995, the Israeli peace political parties organized a rally to support the peace process. Geffen was invited to perform, and surprisingly decided to perform Livkot Lekha [&quot;Cry for You&quot;], which he wrote and gave to Israeli singer Arik Einstein. Only later was it discovered that the lyrics prophesied the tragic assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin later that night. &quot;Cry for You&quot; became a kind of anthem, and was the song that symbolized the Candle Children who mourned Rabin&#x27;s death visually with memorial candles.

In 1996, Geffen released &quot;HaMikhtav&quot; [&quot;The Letter&quot;]. &quot;Mèred HaDmaót&quot; [&quot;The Tears Rebellion&quot;] was written after Rabin&#x27;s murder in 1995. It expressed a change and a turning point in Geffen&#x27;s music. Later, in 1996, Geffen recorded what was known later as &quot;The Israeli version of &#x27;Imagine&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Shir Tikvá&quot; [&quot;Let&#x27;s Walk for the Dream&quot;], which expressed deeply Geffen&#x27;s vision.

In 1997, Geffen released his first compilation, which included a CD with the best songs of the early era, and a second CD which included B sides and live performances. An attempt to widen his audience on a global level saw one of Geffen&#x27;s more unusual albums, &quot;Halulìm&quot; [&quot;Hollowed&quot;]. Like his &quot;big brothers&quot;, it was also produced by Moshe Levi, but unlike them, it is a hard, cold, and alienated, full of distortion. Despite heavy promotion (such as billboards), it failed commercially.

1999 saw the release of Geffen&#x27;s 8th studio album –&quot; Leilót Levanìm&quot; [&quot;White Nights&quot;], created under the influence of the changes in Geffen&#x27;s life. Moshe Levi was again the producer; the combination of the two created a soft and melodic album compared to Halulim. It contained the song &quot;Mexico&quot; which stayed on the Israeli charts for a long time.

=== 2000s ===
In September 2000, Geffen released his 9th album, &quot;Yomán Masá&quot; [&quot;A Journey&#x27;s Log&quot;], for the first time produced by Louie Lahav, and on a new label – &quot;Helicon&quot;. Geffen collaborated with two notable colleagues – Daniel Salomon (who joined from the Leilot Levanim tour) and Moshe Levi, who was involved in the orchestration. Geffen had recorded 11 melodic songs, with a bonus track – a tribute to Bob Dylan – an Israeli cover of Geshem Kaved Omed Lipol [&quot;A Hard Rain&#x27;s Gonna Fall&quot;] (translated by his father). The album produced three notable hits for Geffen: Uri Ur [&quot;Wake Up&quot;], Tsalakót [&quot;Scars&quot;], and Yoman Masa (together with Arik Einstein).

In 2001 Geffen met and began to collaborate with British rock star Steven Wilson, with whom he created the band Blackfield. Blackfield combines the musical efforts of both musicians and they perform their own original compositions as well as Aviv&#x27;s own songs translated into English. The band released three highly acclaimed albums in the mid-2000s (see ahead) and conducted major tours for each release. Their fourth release in 2013 saw Wilson take more of a back seat due to his own increasing workload, opting to produce the album and contribute minor writing and recording work only.

Two years after &quot;A Journey&#x27;s Log&quot; (April 2002), Geffen released his next album: &quot;Memento Mori&quot;, which he dedicated to his grandmother, who died a short time before the album&#x27;s release. The name was taken from the Latin phrase, &quot;Remember You Will Die&quot; (meaning one should remember one&#x27;s mortality). Like his previous albums, &quot;Memento Mori&quot; was soft (but still features harder compositions). The album featured two major hits: Keren Or [&quot;Ray of Light&quot;] and Holèch Kadima [&quot;Moving Forward&quot;]. From this album came the single Shir Atzuv [&quot;Sad Song&quot;].

In 2003 the Israeli documentary film &quot;Aviv&quot; was released which focused on Aviv Geffen&#x27;s life. The film premiered at the Bangkok International Film Festival.

In 2004 the album &quot;Blackfield&quot; was released which was a result of the collaboration between Geffen and Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree. Its followup &quot;Blackfield II&quot; was released in early 2007, followed by the live DVD &quot;Blackfield: Live in NYC&quot; later in the year. Both of the Blackfield albums spawned several hits, notably &quot;Blackfield&quot;, &quot;Pain&quot; and &quot;Once&quot;. A third album, entitled &quot;Welcome to my DNA&quot; was released in March 2011, in which most songs were written by Geffen. It also contains a renewed version of the track &quot;Zigota&quot;&quot; () from his album &quot;Memento Mori&quot;.

In 2006 Geffen&#x27;s 11th album &quot;Im HaZmán&quot; [&quot;With Time&quot;] was released. The theme song is a cover of a French chanson by Léo Ferré, which indicated matureness and sobering from the clichés that he symbolized in his initial years. Most recently he compiled a 2CD/1DVD live album, simply titled &quot;Live.&quot; Lately, Geffen declared himself radical left.

After releasing two albums with Blackfield, Geffen announced in November 2007 that he was recording his first English-language studio album. In January 2008 his single &#x27;End of the World&#x27; charted at number one in Poland and he performed at Bush Hall in London on the 31st. He released a single (Silence) at the end of 2008 and is touring throughout January 2009, with dates in Kraków, Berlin, Hamburg, Cologne, Amsterdam, Munich, Paris and London.

In June, he announced that recording had begun at Sarm West Studios, with Trevor Horn producing and Steven Wilson and Mike Garson featuring on the album. These sessions led to his debut English-language album, &quot;Aviv Geffen&quot;, released towards the end of summer 2009. The debut single released was &#x27;It was Meant to be a Love Song&#x27;.

=== 2010s ===
In March 2011, Blackfield&#x27;s third studio album was released called &quot;Welcome to my DNA&quot;. 2013 saw the release of &quot;Blackfield IV&quot; with contributions of several guest vocalists.

Beginning in 2012, Aviv Geffen served as one of the four coaches on the Israeli version of the vocal performance competition show &quot;The Voice Israel&quot;.

Geffen spent most of 2015 recording the upcoming fourth Blackfield record, still with involvement of Steve Wilson who obviously took over some guitar and vocal duties, although he had announced in 2014 that he had to stop from being part of Blackfield due to lack of time. The new album was recorded in London and Los Angeles, produced by the legendary Alan Parsons. According to Geffen&#x27;s Twitter account the album (or just parts of the album) was finally mixed. The record, named &quot;Blackfield V&quot;, is released on 10 February 2017.

Aviv Geffen&#x27;s solo EP &quot;Mr Down &amp; Mrs High&quot; was released in the UK on 23 May 2012. Part produced by Tony Visconti and Trevor Horn, the EP features four tracks, includes the lead song Mr Down &amp; Mrs High, with &#x27;Jerusalem&#x27;, &quot;Highway&#x27; and &#x27;When Summer Comes&#x27;.

In 2018 he was appointed as the global music director for WeWork.

=== 2020s ===
In August of 2022, Geffen apologized for his past anti-settler views during a concert at a settlement in the West Bank. Geffen said he had undergone a process of personal transformation that had “opened my eyes”, and that he had previously been “ignorant”.

== Personal Life==
In 1996 Geffen married Israeli actress . The couple divorced in 1998. In 2005 Geffen married Shani Friedan after a seven-year relationship. The couple&#x27;s first son, Dylan (named after Bob Dylan), was born in 2007. The couple&#x27;s second son, Elliott (named after the character of Elliott Taylor from the film &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;), was born in 2016. This marriage also ended in a divorce. In 2024, he married Sharon Kauffman after a one-year relationship, in a Jewish ceremony in Hamburg. Geffen&#x27;s third child, John (named after John Lennon and as a shortened English variant of his father&#x27;s name, Yehonatan), was born in 2025.

Geffen is an atheist.

==Musical influences==
Over the years, Geffen&#x27;s musical style has been influenced by rock bands like Pink Floyd, U2, Radiohead, Nirvana, and artists like John Lennon and Bob Dylan. Geffen&#x27;s piano and guitar playing is mainly influenced by Radiohead&#x27;s Thom Yorke and U2&#x27;s The Edge. Geffen has often cited Bob Dylan and Roger Waters as major influences.

<doc id="1330308" wikidata="Q1154771" url="?curid=1330308" title="Kazushi Sakuraba">
<text>is a Japanese professional wrestler, submission wrestler and former mixed martial artist, currently signed to Pro Wrestling Noah, where he was formerly one-half of the former GHC Tag Team Champions with Takashi Sugiura. He has also competed in traditional puroresu for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) and shoot-style competition for UWFi and Kingdom Pro Wrestling (KPW). He has fought in MMA competition in the Ultimate Fighting Championship, Pride Fighting Championships, Hero&#x27;s, Dream and most recently Rizin Fighting Federation. He is known as the Gracie Hunter or the Gracie Killer due to his wins over four members of the famed Gracie family: Royler Gracie, Renzo Gracie, Ryan Gracie, and Royce Gracie. Sakuraba is famous for beating 15 champions of different top MMA organizations; opponents who were often many weight-classes above him.

Known for his excellent skills in catch wrestling and unorthodox fighting style, he is considered to be one of the greatest mixed martial art fighters of all time, and also holds notable victories over 7 UFC champions, 3 Pancrase Champions, a DREAM champion, a King of the Cage champion and Battlecade Extreme Fighting champion; former Welterweight Champion Carlos Newton, two former Light heavyweight champions Vitor Belfort and Quinton Jackson, former Heavyweight Champion Kevin Randleman, 3-time UFC Tournament champion Royce Gracie, former Superfight champion and King of Pancrase Ken Shamrock, former King of Pancrase Masakatsu Funaki, DREAM Super Hulk Tournament Champion Ikuhisa Minowa, former King of the Cage Light Heavyweight champion Vernon White, and former Battlecade Extreme Fighting champion Marcus Silveira. He is also the first of only two Japanese champions in UFC history. Sakuraba&#x27;s Pride fights routinely draw more than viewers in Japan. Sakuraba is the founder of the submission wrestling promotion Quintet, where he has competed since 2018.

== Early life ==
Sakuraba became a fan of Japanese professional wrestling during his childhood thanks to the &quot;Tiger Mask&quot; manga, with the eponymous New Japan Pro-Wrestling wrestler Tiger Mask being his favorite. After being convinced against dropping out of high school to pursue professional wrestling, Sakuraba began a career in amateur wrestling at the age of 15, hoping to gain a useful background to achieve his childhood dream. A high school stand-out, he finished as high as second in the nation before joining the freestyle wrestling squad of Chuo University, a team which had counted Olympic gold medalists Shozo Sasahara and Osamu Watanabe amongst its ranks. He won the East Japan Freshman championship in his first year and served as their team captain thereafter. In his senior year, he finished fourth place in the All-Japan tournament. Amongst his notable wins was one over future Olympic bronze medalist Takuya Ota. Upon graduating from college, Sakuraba initially thought about remaining with Chuo University as a coach. However, at the last minute, he decided to continue his road to professional wrestling.

==Professional wrestling==
=== Background ===
Having weighed for most of his amateur wrestling career, Sakuraba was encouraged by his peers to gain weight, as it would be difficult to compete as a smaller fighter in pro wrestling. After working to gain the weight needed to compete, he never wanted to lose it anymore, something that would be reflected in his MMA career. Finding himself attracted by the shoot wrestling movement, which had been by his childhood idol Sayama, Sakuraba considered joining the mixed martial arts organization Pancrase, but he ultimately chose the promotion Union of Wrestling Forces International, a professional wrestling league that was nonetheless known for its highly technical and realistic-looking bouts.

=== Union of Wrestling Forces International (1993–1996) ===
His time in the UWF-i would prove to be a formative experience for Sakuraba. He received his initial instruction in both grappling and striking under main trainer Yoji Anjo, later honing his catch wrestling skills under the tutelage of Billy Robinson. He also trained in muay thai under master Bovy Chowaikung, the main UWF-i striking teacher. Those disciplines would serve as the base of the unorthodox game that would later lead him to success in the Pride Fighting Championships. Over time he became one of Takada&#x27;s four main trainees, along with Kiyoshi Tamura, Yoshihiro Takayama and Masahito Kakihara.
In spite of his amateur pedigree, Sakuraba was forced to work his way up from the bottom of the UWFi&#x27;s rung, as it is traditional in puroresu. Sakuraba lost his debut on August 13, 1993, to Steve Nelson and went winless through his rookie year with the league. It is also popularly alleged that under the eye of Kiyoshi Tamura, he was made to perfectly perform menial chores about the dojo. Still undeterred, Sakuraba steadily built a working knowledge of submission holds upon his freestyle wrestling base until his efforts were at last rewarded with a win over Mark Silver in October 1994.

Though his record remained below .500, Sakuraba continued to edge his way closer to mid-card status through the rest of the year. Then, in 1995, the UWFi began an interpromotional feud with New Japan Pro-Wrestling. The vast majority of UWF-i workers came out on the losing end of the booking to the larger and more mainstream promotion and Sakuraba was no exception. He was defeated in high-profile bouts to Tokimitsu Ishizawa, Koji Kanemoto and Shinjiro Otani, bringing Sakuraba a new level of exposure to the public. The ring psychology and technical prowess he displayed in the bouts also impressed the management of the UWF-i enough that he was finally pushed towards main event status.

New Japan&#x27;s dominance in the feud injured the marketability of the UWFi promotion, which had pressed the perception that their athletes boasted legitimate skill in real fighting. In a bid to regain credibility, Yoji Anjo travelled to California to perform a dojo challenge on Rickson Gracie, only to be swiftly and brutally defeated before the assembled Japanese press that had followed him there. With the UWFi&#x27;s formerly fearsome reputation in tatters, its attendance numbers swiftly decreased, with the federation closing its doors once and for all in December 1996. In their final show it was Sakuraba who at long last headlined, defeating Anjoh by submission.

=== Kingdom Pro Wrestling (1997–1998) ===
Following the close of the UWFi, Nobuhiko Takada, the most popular of the UWFi workers amongst the mainstream public founded Kingdom Pro Wrestling, taking in Sakuraba and the majority of his fellow UWFi alumni. In the vein of its predecessor, Kingdom was primarily a league devoted to shoot-style realistic-looking works. Having by now established his ability, Sakuraba was this time booked as a main-eventer from the outset. However, unlike the UWFi, Kingdom struggled from the beginning to draw substantial crowds. Mixed martial arts was growing in popularity, and the dominance of the Gracie family and their fellow Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioners over the field and more specifically over professional wrestlers, left the Japanese public ever more unconvinced as to the fighting ability of Kingdom&#x27;s stable of athletes.

=== Inoki Bom-Ba-Ye (2000) ===

=== Inoki Genome Federation (2011) ===

=== New Japan Pro-Wrestling (2012–2016) ===

On August 12, 2012, Sakuraba, alongside Katsuyori Shibata, started appearing in New Japan Pro-Wrestling. It was Sakuraba&#x27;s first work for the company since 1995, and the first ever as a free agent instead of a representative from another promotion. Sakuraba and Shibata wrestled their first match on September 23, defeating Hiromu Takahashi and Wataru Inoue in a tag team match. Sakuraba and Shibata, collectively dubbed Laughter7, continued their winning ways at the following two pay-per-views, King of Pro-Wrestling on October 8 and Power Struggle on November 11, both times defeating the team of Togi Makabe and Wataru Inoue. Also at Power Struggle, Shinsuke Nakamura nominated Sakuraba as the next challenger for his IWGP Intercontinental Championship. On December 2, Sakuraba won his first exchange with Nakamura, when Laughter7 defeated Nakamura and Tomohiro Ishii in a tag team match to remain undefeated since their return. On January 4, 2013, at Wrestle Kingdom 7 in Tokyo Dome, Sakuraba suffered his first defeat since his return to professional wrestling, when he unsuccessfully challenged Shinsuke Nakamura for the IWGP Intercontinental Championship. Sakuraba and Shibata returned to their winning ways at the following pay-per-view, The New Beginning on February 10, where they defeated Hirooki Goto and Wataru Inoue in a tag team match. On April 7 at Invasion Attack, Sakuraba and Shibata suffered their first tag team loss, when they were defeated by Hirooki Goto and Yuji Nagata via referee stoppage, when Sakuraba injured his right elbow, after taking a belly-to-back suplex from Nagata, and unable to continue the match. New Japan later announced that Sakuraba would be sidelined for two to three months. Sakuraba wrestled his return match on July 20, defeating Yuji Nagata via submission. On September 8, Sakuraba and Shibata took part in the Wrestle-1 promotion&#x27;s inaugural event, defeating Masakatsu Funaki and Masayuki Kono in a tag team match. Sakuraba continued his rivalry with Yuji Nagata at the September 29 Destruction pay-per-view, where he and Shibata defeated Nagata and Manabu Nakanishi with Sakuraba pinning his rival for the win.

On October 14, Sakuraba was defeated by Nagata in a singles rematch between the two. Following the match, Sakuraba and Nagata came together to accept a challenge issued by Daniel and Rolles Gracie On January 4, 2014, at Wrestle Kingdom 8 in Tokyo Dome, Sakuraba and Nagata defeated the Gracies via disqualification, after Nagata was choked out with a gi. A rematch between the two teams took place on February 11 at The New Beginning in Osaka and saw Rolles submit Sakuraba for the win. Sakuraba suffered another loss against the Gracies on May 3 at Wrestling Dontaku 2014, where he teamed with Shinsuke Nakamura. On May 25 at Back to the Yokohama Arena, Sakuraba ended the Gracies&#x27; win streak by defeating Rolles in a singles match. Sakuraba then started a new rivalry with Minoru Suzuki, while also forming a partnership with Toru Yano, who was also involved in his own rivalry with Suzuki&#x27;s Suzuki-gun stable. The partnership led to Sakuraba becoming an associate of Yano and Nakamura&#x27;s Chaos stable, eventually becoming a full-time member. The rivalry between Sakuraba and Suzuki culminated in a match on January 4, 2015, at Wrestle Kingdom 9 in Tokyo Dome, where Sakuraba was defeated.

On April 5 at Invasion Attack 2015, Sakuraba submitted Katsuyori Shibata in a tag team match, where he and Yano defeated Shibata and Hiroshi Tanahashi, igniting a rivalry between the former Laughter7 partners. The two faced off on July 5 at Dominion 7.5 in Osaka-jo Hall in a match, where Shibata was victorious.

=== Pro Wrestling Noah (2019–present) ===

After wrestling sporadically for independent promotions for a few years, Sakuraba returned to wrestling full-time for Pro Wrestling Noah, aligning himself with the Sugiura-gun faction headed by Takashi Sugiura. On 30 August 2020 Sakuraba and Sugiura defeated AXIZ (Go Shiozaki and Katsuhiko Nakajima) for the vacant GHC Tag Team Championship, Sakuraba&#x27;s first ever pro-wrestling title. In September Sakuraba entered the annual N1-Victory tournament as a singles competitor, finishing on 4 points with 2 wins and 3 losses. As of 22 November Sakuraba and Sugiura have successfully defended the GHC tag titles on two occasions.

==Mixed martial arts==
=== Early career ===
Though sources often cite Sakuraba&#x27;s match with Kimo Leopoldo on July 14, 1996, as his first experience with mixed martial arts, there is debate about whether it was a shoot or a worked match. Sakuraba himself has stated that he doesn&#x27;t remember it. However, his first contact with MMA can be traced to his different style fight at 26 June 1996 against Dutch kickboxer Rene Rooze, which was won by Sakuraba via ankle hold.

===Ultimate Fighting Championship===
In an attempt to gain attention for the embattled Kingdom Pro Wrestling league, Hiromitsu Kanehara and Yoji Anjoh signed on to compete in the Ultimate Fighting Championship&#x27;s Ultimate Japan tournament. Kanehara was injured in his training for the tournament, and Sakuraba wound up as his late-hour substitute. The tournament was intended for heavyweights, but Sakuraba who weighed 183 pounds (middleweight by modern standards), was nearly twenty pounds beneath the UFC&#x27;s 200 pound designation for the weight class. Having reported himself as 203 pounds (Light heavyweight by modern standards) in order to gain entry, Sakuraba was paired off against the 240 pound Brazilian jiu-jitsu blackbelt and former Extreme Fighting champion, Marcus Silveira.

The match saw the two grapplers exchanging leglocks without any decisive movement. Following a barrage of light blows by Silveira, Sakuraba dropped for a low single leg takedown, but referee John McCarthy stopped the fight before Sakuraba could complete it, believing he had been knocked out by the punches. A loud protest followed from the crowd and an angry Sakuraba attempted unsuccessfully to take the microphone and address the Japanese audience. However, after reviewing tape, McCarthy changed his decision to a no-contest. As Tank Abbott, who had earlier defeated Anjoh, had dropped from the tournament due to an injured hand, it was ruled that Sakuraba and Silveira faced off once more that night in what would be the championship bout of the tournament.

Silveira opened their second match taking Sakuraba&#x27;s back, which the Japanese wrestler answered by attempting to apply a Kimura lock. After freeing his arm, Silveira capitalized on another Kimura attempt by Saku to try to twist it into an armbar from his guard, only for the Japanese to escape to his knees. Silveira then tried his own Kimura, but at that moment Sakuraba reversed it in the same way and locked the armbar, making the Brazilian submit. Afterwards, in the post-fight interview, Sakuraba famously stated, . With the victory Sakuraba remains one of the last UFC tournament champions to date.

With Nobuhiko Takada having left Kingdom to challenge Rickson Gracie in an event called Pride Fighting Championships, the still struggling promotion capitalized on Sakuraba&#x27;s newly found popularity establishing him as Kingdom&#x27;s top talent. He embarked on a winning streak against several foreign mixed martial arts competitors including Paul Herrera, Rene Rooze, Mark Hall and Orlando Weit. However, Kingdom continued to flounder and finally folded in March 1998.

===Pride Fighting Championships===

====Pride 2 through 8====
Entering the Pride Fighting Championships on the heels of a defeat of stablemate Nobuhiko Takada at the hands of Rickson Gracie in the organization&#x27;s initial event, Sakuraba was paired off against Vernon White, then a veteran of 32 bouts in Pancrase who also boasted a 20-pound weight advantage. Showcasing a balance of wrestling and submission prowess, Sakuraba came after White with constant takedowns and unceasing submission attempts. White held Sakuraba off for the first two rounds, but was ultimately submitted by armbar towards the end of the third round.

Next, in Pride 3, Sakuraba was matched against Ultimate Fighting Championship veteran Carlos Newton. Though relatively new to mixed martial arts, Newton had recently disposed of the reigning Shooto light heavyweight champion Erik Paulson with a swift armbar victory and already developed a reputation as a talented grappler. Accordingly, the match was a back and forth grappling affair between the two fighters. At the second round, after several exchanges on the mat, Newton looked to capture Sakuraba&#x27;s back, but the Japanese trapped him in a rolling kneebar and finished him.

Eager to capitalize on Sakuraba&#x27;s shoot wrestling prowess to reverse the perception that Japanese professional wrestlers were inferior to Brazilian combatants (in part perpetuated by his teammates&#x27; own defeats), Sakuraba&#x27;s next three bouts were scheduled against Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belts Vitor Belfort, Allan Goes and luta livre black belt Ebenezer Fontes Braga. In a trend that would continue through Sakuraba&#x27;s Pride career, each opponent occupied a spot near the top of the 205-pound class at the time of their meeting with him and held a weight advantage of around 20 pounds.

Sakuraba&#x27;s match against Goes would be an instrumental point in his fighting&#x27;s style evolution, pitted against an opponent with a strong defensive guard. Through the bout, Sakuraba attempted several moves to bypass the stationary Goes&#x27;s defense, including leglocks, dives and kicks to the legs, but he also would have to defend, as Goes was relentless in his upkicks and submission counterattacks. Sakuraba was threatened by a rear naked choke several times, and in turn he almost finished Allan as well with an armbar, but none of it came to fruition. Due to the absence of judges in Pride&#x27;s ruleset at the time, the match was ruled a draw. Sakuraba, always humble, stated &quot;I fight his style, not mine. I think I lost the fight&quot;, although Goes, a Carlson Gracie protege, would similarly state in a later interview &quot;I&#x27;ve been training my whole life on the ground, and to me, [Sakuraba] was the best guy I ever faced on the ground&quot;.

Belfort would be a different matchup, as his boxing prowess was known aside from his great grappling credentials. However, despite several big flurries by the Brazilian to open the match, Sakuraba went unscathed and took Belfort down, proceeding to land ground and pound. As Belfort would not leave the mat through the match, in part due to a broken hand in one of his own combos, Sakuraba deployed his improved strategy and punished Vitor with leg kicks and jumping stomps to the head, as well as landing unanswered striking combinations every time Belfort was called up by the referee. At the end, as Pride had just implemented the judges system, Sakuraba was awarded his first decision victory unanimously.

Unlike the previous two matches, Kazushi faced in Braga a consistently aggressive opponent, with the luta livre practitioner landing effective muay thai knees and kicks until Sakuraba put him down. The Japanese wrestler continued his signature guard assault, but also outstruck Braga in his last standing segment before taking him down again and lock an armbar for the tap out.

====&quot;The Gracie Hunter&quot;====
After defeating Anthony Macias at Pride 7, Sakuraba was matched against Royler Gracie, who had previously conquered Sakuraba&#x27;s stablemate Yuhi Sano. It marked the largest weight advantage Sakuraba has enjoyed in his career to date (being around 30 pounds heavier than Royler). Royler, unable to score a takedown or strike effectively from a standing position, remained on the ground in an effort to bait Sakuraba into a grappling-oriented contest, while Sakuraba, standing, landed punishing kicks to Royler&#x27;s legs, thighs and head. Eventually, with less than two minutes remaining, Sakuraba finally engaged Royler on the ground and instantly caught him in a Kimura lock. As Sakuraba wrenched on the submission, the referee intervened with 1 minute and 44 seconds remaining on the clock, ending the contest and awarding Sakuraba the win by TKO.

Sakuraba&#x27;s victory over Royler constituted the first loss by a Gracie in professional fighting in several decades and as such, sent ripples of shock and controversy through the mixed martial arts community. Some protested that the victory was tainted due to the fact that Royler (although placed in a debilitating submission hold) never conceded defeat and was little time away from the final bell when the bout was stopped. It is worth noting that the last Japanese athlete to defeat a Gracie prior to Sakuraba&#x27;s win against Royler, legendary judoka Masahiko Kimura, had used the very same technique Sakuraba utilized to beat Royler. That time, the recipient had been Royler&#x27;s father, Hélio Gracie, who had, like Royler, also refused to submit but likewise lost.

====Pride 2000 Grand Prix====

While the Japanese fight media rejoiced and elevated Sakuraba to superstar status, the Gracie family took great umbrage over the incident, feeling that they had been cheated by Pride. Despite Sakuraba challenging Royler&#x27;s older brother Rickson Gracie after the match, it was his younger brother and former UFC Champion Royce Gracie who, compelled to set the record straight and re-assert the dominance of his family, returned to the sport of mixed martial arts in 2000 and entered the 16-Man Pride Grand Prix alongside Sakuraba and several other top fighters of the era. Placed on the same side of the bracket, a special set of rules were requested by the Gracies in the event of a Sakuraba-Royce match, including no referee stoppages and no time-limits, the fight ending only in the event of a submission or knock-out (something prohibited in modern MMA because of the widely adopted Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts limiting matches to 25 minutes overall, 5 x 5 minute rounds).

In his first fight of the 2000 Pride tournament Sakuraba once again found himself matched up against a heavier opponent, this time the well-regarded 205 pound fighter, former King of Pancrase Guy Mezger. After a closely fought 15 minutes the judges requested an overtime round, and the fight ended in controversy when Mezger&#x27;s coach Ken Shamrock forced his fighter back to the locker room claiming that no additional rounds were agreed upon in the contract. Sakuraba ended up winning the match by forfeit. Meanwhile, Royce defeated Nobuhiko Takada by unanimous decision and thus set the stage for their much anticipated showdown.

In the tournament quarterfinals Royce and Sakuraba battled for an hour and a half (six 15 minute rounds). Gracie opened the fight aggressively, raining punches from Kazushi&#x27;s back while the Japanese fighter worked an armlock from standing, but Sakuraba kept calm, knowing Royce had no knockout power and expecting him to waste his energy; he even came to the point of smiling to the cameras during the attack. Towards the end of the round, Sakuraba nearly ended the match with a kneebar, while Gracie came back with a guillotine choke at the second, but Kazushi again joked to show he was out of danger by simulating to pull down Royce&#x27;s gi pants. Sakuraba switched to attack at the third round, dominating the stand up and making Royce lie repeatedly on the ground to avoid him. As the confrontation stretched on, the Gracie&#x27;s own no time-limit rules began to work against Royce as Sakuraba&#x27;s wrestling skills and balance nullified Royce&#x27;s ability to score a takedown and—in some instances—even pull guard. Even Royce&#x27;s ever-present jiu-jitsu gi became a weapon for the wrestler to use against him as Sakuraba used it to help him control Gracie on the instances the fight did come to the ground. However, with Sakuraba&#x27;s control of the takedown, these instances of ground warfare became increasingly sporadic. After Kazushi landed a long series of punishing leg kicks in the fifth and sixth rounds, Royce&#x27;s brother, Rorion threw in the towel.

Exhausted from his battle with Royce, Sakuraba surprised many when he emerged from the locker room for the tournament semi-finals. His opponent, Igor Vovchanchyn, outweighed him by close to sixty pounds (Sakuraba had come into the bout with Royce lighter than usual, at 176 pounds) and was considered to be the top heavyweight striker of the day. Sakuraba surprised many by taking Vovchanchyn down and nearly finishing him with an armbar. Sakuraba was actually leading the fight past the 10-minute mark, but near the end Igor was able to reverse a takedown and draw the first round even with ground strikes. After the first round was declared a draw Sakuraba&#x27;s corner threw in the towel before the beginning of overtime, primarily due to fatigue.

====Pride 10 through 15====
Following the Grand Prix, Sakuraba was christened the &quot;Gracie Hunter&quot; by the Japanese sports media. Keeping in tow with his new nickname, Sakuraba sandwiched a swift victory via achilles lock against Shannon Ritch between fights against brothers Renzo Gracie and Ryan Gracie. In contrast to Royler and Royce, Renzo and Ryan were products of Carlson Gracie&#x27;s approach to jiu-jitsu, which placed a stronger emphasis on combat-ready skills and training without a gi.

At the time of his bout with Sakuraba, Renzo&#x27;s only loss in 10 bouts was a closely contested decision to Sakuraba&#x27;s former UWFi stablemate and rival, Kiyoshi Tamura while Maurice Smith, Oleg Taktarov and Abu Dhabi champion Sanae Kikuta numbered amongst his victims. Renzo&#x27;s stylistic differences from his cousins were in evidence from the outset of his contest against Sakuraba, as he pressed the pace of the bout with a variety of kicks and punches, although few connected. Sakuraba responded in kind, and the striking seemed to go to a stalemate. Throwing his wrestling into the equation, Sakuraba timed a number of double and single leg takedowns against Renzo&#x27;s flurries from where he alternately attempted to cartwheel past Gracie&#x27;s guard, malign his legs with kicks from the standing position and even attack with a baseball slide. However, Renzo&#x27;s defensive skills from bottom nullified the entire gamut of Sakuraba&#x27;s offensive attempts, and after using an entry derived from the De la Riva guard, he took the wrestler&#x27;s back, pressing him against the turnbuckle as mere seconds remained in the battle. With time ticking away, Sakuraba locked in a kimura from the back and spun around, flipping Renzo to the canvas even as he wrenched his arm behind his back. Like Royler and Helio before him, Renzo refused to submit to the hold despite his elbow being snapped prior to hitting the ground and, even as the referee stopped the contest due to the injury, which awarded victory to Sakuraba.

Renzo took the microphone and, before the 35,000 fans assembled at the Seibu Dome, stated that Sakuraba was &quot;the Japanese version of the Gracie family&quot;. Renzo has since referred to the bout as his proudest moment in mixed martial arts. Similarly, years later Gracie called Sakuraba &quot;his hero&quot; and remembered their match as &quot;one of the biggest lessons he learned in his life&quot;. Commentator Stephen Quadros stated too: &quot;if any fans still doubted the abilities of Kazushi Sakuraba in MMA competition, they are now silent.&quot; Ryan Gracie, who had fought on the same card and emerged victorious, jumped into the ring issued a challenge to Sakuraba, which was accepted. Vitor Belfort also demanded a rematch, although Sakuraba had stated not to be interested in rematches due to his interest in facing Frank Shamrock, Tito Ortiz and Dan Henderson.

The fight between Sakuraba and Ryan was scheduled to happen at Pride 12. Due to a shoulder injury, the fight was limited to a single 10-minute round, where Ryan&#x27;s spirited efforts were generally stymied and controlled by Sakuraba, who noticeably avoided attacks on his younger opponent&#x27;s injured arm. Despite it, Kazushi later argued in an interview that he believed Ryan would have been faking the entire injury in order to catch him off guard. Nonetheless, the Japanese threw some of his usual antics during the match, at some points delivering chops to Ryan&#x27;s rear while controlling him.

Following the win against Ryan, Sakuraba was slated to battle Pancrase veteran Bas Rutten, but the latter declined and was replaced by Brazilian muay thai specialist Wanderlei Silva. Sakuraba was a heavy favorite to win, but he was fighting through a significant weight disadvantage. The bout was also contested under Pride&#x27;s new rules, which allowed kicks and knees to the head of a downed opponent, a change that greatly benefitted Wanderlei. During the match, a Sakuraba willing to trade strikes managed to knock Wanderlei down with a right hook, but the Brazilian recovered and dropped the wrestler with a barrage of punches and kicks. As Sakuraba turtled while attempted a takedown, Silva delivered multiple knees to his head and ultimately finished him off with kicks to the face. It marked Sakuraba&#x27;s second defeat in mixed martial arts and his first loss in the 205-pound division. Sakuraba then shocked the audience further by giving Silva his belt with &quot;Saku&quot; engraved on it. Wanderlei then stated that he would willingly give Sakuraba a rematch if Sakuraba wanted one, which the Japanese accepted.

After sitting out the next Pride to recuperate, Sakuraba found himself across the ring from Quinton Jackson, a former collegiate wrestler who had compiled a record of 10–1 on the American circuit. At the sound of the bell, Sakuraba immediately took the bigger man to the canvas with a low single-leg takedown. However, Jackson&#x27;s superior size and enormous physical strength allowed him to muscle out of Sakuraba&#x27;s submission attempts. After locking his legs around Jackson for a triangle choke, Sakuraba found himself hefted into the air and repeatedly slammed to the canvas in the way of a powerbomb. Later, he attempted an armbar against Jackson, only for the Tennessee native to again lift him up and this time attempt to drop him from the ring. His expression unchanging through the course of Jackson&#x27;s assault, Sakuraba continued to flow from one lock to another. Eventually, he took the back of an exhausted Jackson and submitted him with his first rear naked choke victory. The contest was a launchpad for Jackson&#x27;s career, leading to a long-term contract with Pride where he eventually became regarded as a top middleweight competitor, and later, a UFC champion.

====Title bout with Silva, losing streak====
The Jackson bout also re-established Sakuraba&#x27;s proficiency in dealing with larger opponents and placed him back in line for another shot at Wanderlei Silva in Pride&#x27;s next event, this time to decide Pride&#x27;s inaugural 205-pound champion. Usually prone to humorous entrances, it was a somber and focused Sakuraba that came down the aisle for his rematch with Silva. As with Jackson, Sakuraba was able to score an early takedown in the bout, where he then worked from Silva&#x27;s guard. After several minutes searching for a leglock, he finally found one when Silva attempted to escape to his feet. Sakuraba started to control the fight, avoiding Silva&#x27;s strikes and threatening him with clinches and takedown attempts. Halfway through the round, the Japanese locked on a tight guillotine choke, but was countered by a wild slam from Wanderlei which ended up breaking his collar bone. The wrestler managed to end the round with submission attempts from the bottom, but not willing to let him go on so hampered, his corner threw in the towel between rounds.

Sakuraba took time off to let his shoulder heal, also briefly training basic Brazilian jiu-jitsu with Sergio Penha at Takada Dojo. He then returned against heavyweight kickboxer Mirko Cro Cop. Sakuraba was proposed a special ruleset of no strikes on the ground as part of the &quot;K-1 vs Pride theme&quot;, but he rejected the offer, not wanting any special rule for him. Ironically, although he managed to take Cro Cop down through hard kicks, Sakuraba would end losing the match while exchanging strikes on Mirko&#x27;s guard when an upkick from the kickboxer broke his orbital bone.

Finally assenting to place him in competition against fighters of his own weight class, Pride management put him against French jiu-jitsu champion Gilles Arsene in a bout Sakuraba dominated and then against Rickson Gracie protege Antônio Schembri. With a win over Schembri, it was speculated that Sakuraba might be then groomed for a championship fight in a new weight division for fighters of his size. Sakuraba controlled the fight initially, landing plenty of hits and breaking Antônio&#x27;s nose, but when he was going for one of his trademark Mongolian chops, Schembri stunned him with a series of knee strikes (controversially preceded by an illegal headbutt), winning by TKO.

After the defeat to Schembri, Sakuraba expressed desire to gain weight and move up to the heavyweight division, hoping to fight either Bob Sapp or PRIDE Heavyweight Champion Fedor Emelianenko. However, nothing of this was realized, and instead Sakuraba faced Wanderlei Silva for the third time at Pride Total Elimination. The bout reminisced their first encounter, as Sakuraba flashed again a comical entrance and traded strikes with Silva in his own field of specialty. The Japanese utilized a strategy of faking takedowns and attacking with uppercuts, followed by a real takedown attempt which Silva blocked with knees to the head. Sakuraba escaped and kept trading hits, but despite his best efforts to match his opponent&#x27;s striking acumen, Wanderlei knocked him out with a jab-cross combination. After the fight, there was talk of Kazushi planning to retire, but nothing came from it.

Those defeats seemed to mark a turning point in Sakuraba&#x27;s career; though he was unbeaten in his first nine Pride bouts, he thereafter split his next six matches. He had a notable victory over Kevin Randleman, a former UFC Heavyweight Champion, widely remembered due to his ring entrance as Mario, a pun intended to reflect the Japanese media referring to Randleman as Donkey Kong. In the match itself, Randleman was fast in showing his wrestling accolades at taking down Sakuraba, but the Japanese countered by setting submissions from every available position, until the American made a mistake and was caught in an armbar in the third round.

At Pride Shockwave 2003, Sakuraba would face Antônio Rogério Nogueira, brother to the famous Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira. The Brazilian, having promised to knock out the Japanese, opened the match lunging at him with punches, but Kazushi answered in kind and opened a cut on Nogueira&#x27;s eye which almost stopped the bout. The action resumed, both men battled for several minutes, with Rogério gaining the upper hand in striking and Sakuraba in wrestling, allowing him to get in Nogueira&#x27;s guard and inflict significant damage again. During the second round, Nogueira managed to catch Sakuraba in a triangle choke/armbar combo, but the Japanese escaped the hold and sought his own submission, to no effect. Finally, the third round saw Nogueira taking over with punches and knees, exchanging strikes with Sakuraba almost until the last minute, and ultimately winning the decision.

====Pride 2005 Middleweight Grand Prix====
After a quick TKO victory over decorated judoka Yoon Dong-Sik in the opening round, Sakuraba suffered a particularly devastating yet controversial loss against Ricardo Arona in the quarterfinal of the tournament in June 2005. Although Sakuraba put Arona on his back and seemed to put to work his signature jumping stomps, the heavier and stronger Arona soon overpowered him, landing a series of brutal knees to the head, as well as hard soccer kicks to the face. The Brazilian&#x27;s toenail accidentally slashed open the skin over Sakuraba&#x27;s left eye, which Ricardo then capitalized on by squeezing the cut and digging his finger into it in order to force the doctor stoppage. The Japanese tried to keep on, but Arona hit another flurry of knees to the head, and ended the fight landing soccer kick after soccer kick, rendering Kazushi&#x27;s face severely swollen and bloody. Sakuraba would eventually lose the fight by technical knockout after his corner called a stop to the fight at the conclusion of the second round, due to the amount of damage he had sustained.

Following the loss, Pride president Sakakibara suggested Sakuraba might move down in weight to compete in their newly formed 183-pound division. However, instead of moving down in weight, Sakuraba began training at Chute Boxe Academy in Brazil alongside his one-time rival Wanderlei Silva. The move had also a symbolic value, as Chute Boxe was at the time in a rivalry with Arona&#x27;s Brazilian Top Team.

====Post Grand Prix====
Upon completion of his training, he made his return to the ring to engage in yet another contest at the 205-pound limit, this time against fellow shoot wrestler Ken Shamrock. Three minutes into the bout, Sakuraba struck through Shamrock&#x27;s guard with a left hand. Shamrock staggered back and ultimately fell into the ropes, his head hanging out of the ring and his back turned to Sakuraba. Sakuraba rushed in to follow up but before any meaningful offense could be launched, the fight was halted by referee Yuji Shimada. Shamrock got up following the KO and protested vigorously. Opinions were mixed regarding the KO&#x27;s legitimacy, though Ken&#x27;s adopted brother and rival, Frank, stated to believe the stoppage was justified: &quot;He got clocked. He went down. According to the rules, he was no longer defending himself and that&#x27;s the end of the fight.&quot;

Prior to Pride&#x27;s &quot;Shockwave 2005&quot; New Year&#x27;s Eve event, Sakuraba strongly petitioned for a match against fellow shoot wrestler and professional wrestling proponent, Kiyoshi Tamura, even going so far as to publicly request a bout with Tamura. However, with Tamura refusing to face him, Sakuraba recommended another shoot wrestler, Ikuhisa Minowa, who referred to himself as a &quot;real pro wrestler.&quot; Sakuraba did not request the match due to any grudge against Minowa, but rather because he believed that he and Minowa would put on a fight worthy of the Shockwave event. The bout was a competitive one, with Sakuraba choosing to fight from the bottom and using both men&#x27;s submission attempts to force scrambles. After long minutes pinned under Sakuraba, Minowa escaped and took his back, but Kazushi applied a Kimura lock which, although Minowa would not tap to it, nonetheless prompted the referee to halt the contest. The victory marked his final bout under the Pride banner; it also marked one of the few times he was matched against an opponent of his own size from the 183-pound division and his first bout against a Japanese fighter.

=== Hero&#x27;s ===
==== Leaving Pride ====
On 3 May 2006, Sakuraba surprisingly appeared with Hero&#x27;s head Akira Maeda at a Hero&#x27;s event wearing his street clothes (yellow shirt and blue jeans) and a pro wrestling mask in the style of one of his childhood heroes, Tiger Mask. He did not reveal himself, but it was apparent that it was a masked Sakuraba and that he signed with K-1 and FEG. A day later, Sakuraba appeared at a FEG press conference to announce he would fight in Hero&#x27;s. His defection to Hero&#x27;s was a culmination of several signs that suggested he was leaving Pride. It was reported that Sakuraba left Takada Dojo (run by Pride&#x27;s general manager, Nobuhiko Takada), and conspicuously was not entered into Pride&#x27;s 2006 Open Weight Grand Prix Tournament.

==== Hero&#x27;s Light Heavyweight Tournament ====
Sakuraba was then scheduled to compete in Hero&#x27;s Light Heavyweight Tournament. His first opponent was the 16–5 Lithuanian Kęstutis Smirnovas. Sakuraba opened the fight striking aggressively, even flooring Smirnovas with a kick, but as he was coming in to follow up he was caught and knocked down to his knees and hands. Kazushi then turned over, sliding beneath the bottom rope, and Smirnovas unleashed repeated blows to his head. As Sakuraba seemed at this point unable to defend himself, when the referee stepped between the two fighters it seemed likely he was moving to put an end to the contest. However, instead of halting the battle, the referee re-positioned the fighters from underneath the bottom rope into the ring and resumed the bout. Though the restarting of fighters who have found themselves near or outside the ropes is common practice, it was nonetheless controversial. Following the restart, Smirnovas picked up where he&#x27;d left off and proceed to pound a turtled Sakuraba, but the Japanese managed to escape to his feet and land a sharp combination, staggering Smirnovas and bloodying his face. Having turned the tide of the match, Sakuraba began dominating the Lithuanian on the striking segments until Smirnovas dropped to the ground to escape the assault. Sakuraba then accomplished an armbar, forcing his opponent to give up.

Initially there were some doubts as to whether Sakuraba would be able to make it into the next round of the Hero&#x27;s tournament based on the severity of the damage he endured against Smirnovas. However, Sakuraba reported that a follow-up CAT scan had found no irregularities and was then slated to face one-time Olympic judoka, Yoshihiro Akiyama in the tournament&#x27;s semi-finals on October 9 in what K-1 hoped would be a high revenue match-up. The winner of that bout was to face the victor between Melvin Manhoef and Shungo Oyama to determine a tournament champion. However, during a hard sparring session for the upcoming bout Sakuraba began vomiting and fainted. After being rushed to the hospital he was diagnosed with vertebrobasilar damage that restricted blood circulation to the head and neck area. The doctors determined the damage was caused from years of untreated head injuries dating back to his college years.

==== K-1 Dynamite!!! ====
In spite of this revelation, rather than being granted a break to recover and possibly undergo surgery Sakuraba scheduled to return to action on December 31, 2006, against Yoshihiro Akiyama at K-1 Dynamite!!. During the bout, Sakuraba was hit with several punches and he rushed to get the takedown, but in doing so he slipped from Akiyama&#x27;s body. As the sequence repeated itself over and over while Sakuraba took punishment, he opted to drop to his back and attempt a kneebar from there, but his grip on the judoka inexplicably failed again. Having Sakuraba trapped against the ropes and struggling for his submission, Akiyama was free to attack with ground and pound for the referee stoppage. Words were exchanged between Sakuraba and referee Yoshinori Umeki prior to the stop, which was brought on by the sounding of a bell at the behest of Akira Maeda, the event coordinator, the referee separating the fighters following the bell rather than initiating the stop himself.

Afterwards, the usually soft-spoken Sakuraba surprised many with complaints that Akiyama&#x27;s body had been greased. The referee in charge subsequently checked Akiyama&#x27;s body and gave indication to ringside officials that he had not found anything unusual. In the aftermath of the fight the controversy escalated drastically and new accusations of weighed gloves also surfaced. To deal with the growing controversy, K-1 launched an investigation to look into the accusations against Akiyama. Although Akiyama&#x27;s gloves were found to be regulation, video-tape revealed Akiyama administering a lotion to his skin. Akiyama—who attested he was simply treating his dry skin—was found to have been &quot;negligent&quot; and disqualified. The fight was subsequently declared a no-contest and Akiyama&#x27;s purse was withheld. A press conference followed, wherein Akiyama—now heavily maligned by the Japanese sports media—offered a public apology.

Although Sakuraba wore a shirt into the ring against Akiyama which read &quot;K Sakuraba: End of Service&quot;, his experience against Akiyama apparently changed his plans regarding retirement and at Heros 8 he submitted the winless Yurij Kiseliov by armbar.

Following that win, he would next share the mixed martial arts ring with his fellow shoot wrestler and UWFi alum, Kiyoshi Tamura. Once again donning the guise of his childhood hero, Tiger Mask, as he had to signal his exodus from Pride Fighting Championships to Heros, Sakuraba this time wore the mask to mark the occasion of his return to Pride at their final DSE promoted show, Kamikaze. Before the assembled crowd at the Saitama Super Arena—Pride&#x27;s most frequented venue—Sakuraba and Tamura publicly voiced their willingness to meet in a Pride ring, before shaking hands and embracing. A bout between Tamura and Sakuraba had been one of Pride&#x27;s most frequently promised match-ups, one that had never been delivered upon in spite of several efforts to put it together.

On 2 June 2007, Sakuraba rematched Royce Gracie in K-1 Dynamite!! USA. While Sakuraba knocked Gracie to the canvas in the opening seconds, the bout itself was fought at a relatively slow pace, with Kazushi scoring multiple takedowns and Gracie scoring a number of flailing kicks to the legs and face from the bottom, as well as standing knee strikes to Kazushi&#x27;s injured and bandaged knee. The Japanese wrestler also besieged Gracie on the ground, finishing the bout having taken the back of Gracie and searching for an armbar. Royce won by unanimous decision, which many viewers and MMA sites disputed immediately on the feeling that Sakuraba won the fight. Sherdog scored it 29–28 in favor of the Japanese fighter. Moreover, Gracie tested positive for steroids after the bout.

==== Sakuraba versus Funaki ====
Sakuraba returned to the ring on 17 September 2007 at K-1 Hero&#x27;s 10 against former NJPW pro wrestler Katsuyori Shibata. Prior to the bout, Shibata&#x27;s trainer, Masakatsu Funaki had challenged Sakuraba on the basis that their styles would make for an entertaining contest. Shibata came out striking aggressively, but was soon taken to the canvas by Sakuraba&#x27;s trademark single leg. Shibata unleashed a torrent of blows off his back, but the more experienced Sakuraba responded with strikes of his own before transitioning into an armbar and finishing the bout.

Following his victory, Sakuraba praised the fighting spirit of Shibata and accepted Funaki&#x27;s challenge. Much like Sakuraba, Funaki was trained in shoot wrestling and emerged into the world of mixed martial arts on the heels of a career in the UWF (the direct predecessor of Sakuraba&#x27;s UWF International). Both men also held in common a past history of submission wins over world-class opposition and recognition as two of the top Japanese mixed martial artists to date. Appropriately, their bout took place in the main event of K-1&#x27;s year end Dynamite!! show, which garners more TV viewers each year than any other televised mixed martial arts event in Japan. The two fighters exchanged colourful entrances at the arena, Sakuraba&#x27;s featuring him and baseball player Tsuyoshi Shimoyanagi dressed in identical fighting gears and &quot;Ultraman&quot; masks.

Once in the match, Sakuraba was able to sneak in a double leg takedown after Funaki committed heavily to a missed right cross. Funaki closed guard around Sakuraba before opening it up to spin for a kneebar, and for a moment Funaki appeared to secure Sakuraba&#x27;s leg, but he was thwarted by a combination of Sakuraba&#x27;s submission acumen and their position against the ring ropes. Sakuraba then maneuvered to Funaki&#x27;s back, only for the Pancrase founder to roll back into the guard position. Breaking away momentarily from the grappling contest, Sakuraba stood up and began to assault Funaki&#x27;s legs with a series of kicks, which Funaki answered with an upkick of his own, cutting Sakuraba&#x27;s eye. Kazushi then returned himself to the ground, where Funaki immediately attempted to sweep him, but Sakuraba blocked the attempt and secured a Kimura lock or double wristlock, eventually forcing Funaki to submit.

After the match, event producer Sadaharu Tanikawa spoke about a possible matchup between Sakuraba and Rickson Gracie the next year, which the former approved. However, nothing came from it.

=== Dream ===
In 2008, it was announced that Kazushi Sakuraba would compete in the Middleweight Grand Prix of the new MMA promotion, Dream. On 29 April 2008, Sakuraba defeated Andrews Nakahara in the main event at Dream 2: Middle Weight Grandprix 2008 1st Round. However, he was knocked out (and thus eliminated from the tournament) by Melvin Manhoef in the main event of Dream 4: Middle Weight Grandprix 2008 2nd Round. During the match, Sakuraba suffered an ulnar fracture of the left forearm, which was caused by a kick from Manhoef.

Finally it was announced that Kiyoshi Tamura and Kazushi Sakuraba were set to fight at the K-1 Dynamite!! 2008 event on December 31. The fight featured Sakuraba fighting mostly from his back, attempting armbars, kneebars and triangle chokes from his guard while Tamura defended them and applied ground and pound. At the end of the first round, Sakuraba appeared to have an armbar locked in, but the bell sounded before he could extend the arm. Tamura held on at the second, controlling much of the action and consistently kicking Sakuraba&#x27;s injured legs; he was taken down in the final minute by Sakuraba, who immediately launched a barrage of punches, only for the bell to end his attacks again. Ultimately, Tamura was awarded a unanimous decision.

After his return to Dream, Sakuraba defeated boxer turned mixed martial artist Rubin Williams at Dream 11, before facing Croatian Zelg Galesic on Dream 12. Sakuraba took Galesic to the ground via single leg takedown and he immediately transitioned to a leg lock. Galesic tried to defend himself against the submission by raining punches on Sakuraba. Sakuraba absorbed the punches and held on to Galesic&#x27;s leg until he successfully made the Croatian tap out due to a kneebar.

On May 29 he faced Ralek Gracie, at the Saitama Super Arena in &quot;Dream 14&quot;. It would be the sixth time Sakuraba faced a Gracie, albeit this time with a deep age difference, given the Japanese (41) and the Brazilian (24)&#x27;s respective ages. During the match, the wrestler performed significantly against the young Gracie, but the latter kept dominating, evidencing a training specialized to counter Sakuraba&#x27;s style. There was controversy towards the end of the fight, as Sakuraba seemed to have secured a kimura, only to the referee to pause the match to pull up Ralek&#x27;s pants. The pause allowed the Brazilian to come back with an armbar, which Kazushi escaped to meet a unanimous decision win for Gracie.

On September 25, at Dream 16, Sakuraba lost to Jason &quot;Mayhem&quot; Miller via arm triangle choke.

Sakuraba fought for the Dream Welterweight Championship against current champion Marius Zaromskis at Dynamite!! 2010 in December 2010. The fight ended in doctor stoppage, Sakuraba&#x27;s ear was partially ripped off.

Sakuraba fought against undefeated Brazilian jiu-jitsu Black Belt Yan Cabral at Dream 17, losing via head arm triangle. This was Sakuraba&#x27;s 6th loss in his last 8 fights.

=== Rizin Fighting Federation ===
On October 8, 2015, new Japanese mixed martial arts promotion Rizin Fighting Federation announced at a press conference that Sakuraba would face fellow Japanese fighter and grappler Shinya Aoki on the December 29, 2015. This was Sakuraba&#x27;s first fight after taking four years away from the sport. Sakuraba lost the fight via TKO at 5:56 in the first round, after being taken down and receiving ground and pound.

== Submission grappling ==
=== Metamoris ===
On November 22, 2014, Sakuraba fought Renzo Gracie in a grappling match in Metamoris V. Renzo played defensive closed guard earlier in the match, with the two exchanging guillotine choke attempts, but he eventually flipped Sakuraba over and pinned him. However, Sakuraba resisted all of his submission attempts, and with 90 seconds left he scrambled and tried to lock a Kimura, which was unsuccessful. The fight ended in a draw.

=== Rizin ===
On October 15, 2017, Sakuraba fought former UFC champion Frank Shamrock at RIZIN fighting world grand Prix 2017 Autumn: Aki Jin event in Fukuoka, Japan for a grappling exhibition march at 84 kg division. The match ended with a draw decision.

=== Quintet ===
In April 2018, Sakuraba announced the formation of a submission wrestling promotion named Quintet (grappling). Based on five-man teams, it is fought under a &quot;kachi-nuki-shiai&quot; tournament format similar to Nanatei Judo. He competed in the inaugural event, but his team was eliminated in the semi-final round.

Sakuraba competed at Quintet 4 on September 10, 2023, where he would captain his own team, Team Sakuraba. Sakuraba drew his only match and his team went out in the opening round.

== Fighting style ==
Sakuraba became known for a unique, unorthodox fighting style which has been described as creative and compared to &quot;throwing all we&#x27;d thought we&#x27;d learned about martial arts on its head.&quot; He employed moves and techniques from professional wrestling, among them spinning sole kicks, jumping stomps, Mongolian chops and baseball slides. He also used cartwheels to pass guard and several kinds of confusing, often comical tricks to gain advantage over his opponent. However, his main strength was his rounded set of abilities developed from shoot-style wrestling, which included a grinding striking learned from muay thai and a brilliant catch wrestling submission expertise. He submitted important grapplers of his time like Royler Gracie, Renzo Gracie and Masakatsu Funaki by using his signature double top wrist lock, a technique he opened both from standing and on the ground. Though he wasn&#x27;t afraid of giving his back to his opponent in order to secure it, Sakuraba would also use the technique as a positional weapon, threatening with it to control his adversary. Renzo Gracie praised his ability to play against his opponent&#x27;s weaknesses, Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira commended his technical skill, and Mark Kerr called him the world&#x27;s best technician of his era.

== Personal life ==
Sakuraba is married and has a son. He is an atheist.

He has never cared much about diet and admits to drinking alcohol and being a smoker. 
Regarding the notable differences in weight between himself and his opponents throughout his career, as well as the banning of IV&#x27;s for rehydration (and potential PED usage), Sakuraba has stated through an interpreter that &quot;it doesn&#x27;t matter if they [the opponent] use a pill or medicine to get bigger or smaller, I just train hard, eat healthy, fight at my weight and try my best to beat them. For me it doesn&#x27;t matter if they use drugs, but I would not use it. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s bad if they use it to win.&quot;

About his proneness to fight outside his weight class, Sakuraba declared &quot;the more impossible the fights got, the more willing to accept them I became&quot;. Although he once desired to fight him, he later cited Fedor Emelianenko as the only fighter he ever refused to fight.

In June 2021, Sakuraba was a torch bearer for the 2020 Summer Olympics.

Sources, usually Internet-based since the 1990s, may include census and electoral roll records, social networking sites, court reports and purchase histories. The information from data brokers may be used in background checks used by employers and housing.

There are varying regulations around the world limiting the collection of information on individuals; privacy laws vary. In the United States there is no federal regulation protection for the consumer from data brokers, although some states have begun enacting laws individually. In the European Union, GDPR serves to regulate data brokers&#x27; operations. Some data brokers report to have large numbers of population data or &quot;data attributes&quot;. Acxiom purports to have data from 2.5 billion different people.

== Overview ==
&quot;Information broker&quot; is sometimes abbreviated to IB, and other terms used for information brokers include data brokers, independent information specialists, information or data agents, data providers, data suppliers, information resellers, data vendors, syndicated data brokers, or information product companies. Information consultants, freelance librarians, and information specialists are also sometimes termed information brokers.

Credit scores were first used in the 1950s, and information brokering emerged as a career for individuals during that decade. However the business of information brokering did not become widely known or specifically regulated until the 1990s. During the 1970s, &quot;information brokers&quot; often had a library science degree; however, towards the end of the 20th century, people with degrees in science, law, business, medicine, or other disciplines entered the profession, and the line between the terms information professional and information broker became more blurred. In 1977, Kelly Warnken published the first fee-based information directory, followed by the &quot;Journal of Fee-Based Information Services&quot; in 1979 and the book &quot;The Information Brokers: How to Start and Operate Your Own Fee-based Service&quot; in 1981.

Beginning in the late twentieth century, technological developments such as the development of the Internet, increasing computer processing power, and declining costs of data storage made it much easier for companies to collect, analyze, store and transfer large amounts of data about individuals. This gave rise to the information broker or data broker industry. , there is no required academic qualification for the job of information broker; some people may have a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business or marketing, while others may have a background in library science, or may have worked for a database provider.

=== Services ===
Information brokering has been described as the &quot;business of buying and selling information as a commodity&quot;. Information brokers have been defined by the (US) Federal Trade Commission as &quot;companies that collect information, including personal information about consumers, from a wide variety of sources for the purpose of reselling such information to their customers for various purposes, including verifying an individual&#x27;s identity, differentiating records, marketing products, and preventing financial fraud&quot;. Gartner defines an information broker as &quot;a business that aggregates information from a variety of sources; processes it to enrich, cleanse or analyze it; and licenses it to other organizations&quot;. It states that data is &quot;licensed for particular or limited uses&quot; rather than sold to a client.

Information brokers (IBs) collect and collate data concerning myriad topics, ranging from the daily communications of an individual to more specialized data such as product registrations, patents and copyright data, mostly from publicly available sources, usually obtained from online databases. They may also provide various other services, such as analysing the data and writing reports on them; creating databases for clients; or updating clients whenever new information on a specific topic or person. Clients use data brokers to save themselves time and money, as the brokers are trained in the skills needed to retrieve such information effectively and efficiently. Information brokers are secondary researchers, who find information on a variety of subjects, including companies (often competitors), markets, people, and products. Their role includes analysis and synthesis of the data they find, Brokers may find everything else they can about an individual on the Internet, and aggregate that data with information from a variety of other sources.

Information brokers sometimes specialise in a specific area, such as market research, statistics, or scientific data.

Clients of information brokers come from a wide range of industries and professions, including manufacturing, financial institutions, political parties, government agencies and historians. Non-profit organizations might benefit from information which helps them to apply for grant funding, and real estate agents often use IBs to undertake land title searches. Advertising, fraud detection and risk mitigation are three common reasons for using data brokers, and these are the three broad categories defined by the Federal Trade Commission. Information brokers need to screen their clients carefully to avoid criminals obtaining data on individuals for nefarious purposes: US broking companies Lexis-Nexis and ChoicePoint have both been duped by phoney clients, leading in one case to identity theft on a large scale.

Data may be harvested from various sources, including census, change of address, motor vehicle-related records, user-contributed material and social networking sites, media and court reports, voter registration lists, consumer purchase histories, most-wanted lists and terrorist watch lists, bank card transaction records, health care authorities, and Web browsing histories. IBs may also purchase information from other companies (such as a credit card company). The information collected may include name, address, social security number, driver&#x27;s licence number and other such identifying information, as well as occupation, property ownership, income, etc. Advertising companies are most often only interested in profiles and categories rather than personal information about an individual.

Information from property records, tax filings, etc. may also be available via &quot;people-search&quot; whitepage sites, either for a small fee or no cost. These websites can thereby have implications for stalking, harassment, and domestic violence.

The data are aggregated to create individual profiles, often made up of thousands of pieces of information, such as a person&#x27;s age, race, gender, height, weight, marital status, religious affiliation, political affiliation, occupation, household income, net worth, home ownership status, investment habits, product preferences and health-related interests. Brokers then sell the profiles to other organizations that use them mainly to target advertising and marketing towards specific groups, or to verify a person&#x27;s identity including for purposes of fraud detection, and to sell to individuals and organizations so they can research people for various reasons. Some datasets may also include geolocation data and is included in marketing resources from Acxiom. Experian and Oracle also advertise location-based marketing services.

Many brokers work independently, while others are employees of large companies such as LexisNexis or ProQuest.

=== In the United States ===
Data brokers in the United States include Acxiom, Experian, Epsilon, CoreLogic, Datalogix, Intelius, PeekYou, Exactis, and Recorded Future. In 2012, Acxiom claimed to have files on about 500 million active consumers worldwide, with about 1,500 data points per person and, in 2023, Acxiom (renamed LiveRamp) claims to have files on 2.5 billion people and over 3,000 data points per person. The company Oracle has publicly noted it has connections with 80 data broker companies. The US Department of Homeland Security has purchased cell phone location data and home utility data from data brokers to facilitate deportations. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has purchased personal data from the company Venntel. Under both of these circumstances, a warrant is not required to acquire this data, due to the fact that it is &quot;open source&quot; or &quot;commercially obtained&quot;. Use of the data also has implications in background checks (used in rent/housing and job applications).

In 2012, Spokeo, a people search website, settled with the US Federal Trade Commission for $800,000 over violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

In 2017, Cambridge Analytica claimed that it has psychological profiles of 220 million United States citizens, based on 5,000 separate data sets, with another source reporting 230 million. A scandal emerged after it was found that after 270,000 Facebook users consented to sharing their data, data was scraped from about 50 million profiles on the social media platform. This was seen as breach of trust by Facebook.

In 2018, American companies spent $19 billion acquiring and analyzing consumer data, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau.

In 2021, &quot;The Pillar&quot; outed a Catholic priest by purchasing data from a data broker including data usage from Grindr.

==Privacy issues and regulation==
Information privacy laws are not as strict in the United States as in the European Union, where data brokers work hard to get around the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regulations, brought into operation in 2018. Under GDPR, data can only be collected for re-use on one of six legal bases. The rather vague term &quot;legitimate interest&quot; is often abused or misinterpreted. Explicit consent from users is required for information storage. In addition, data processing related with political opinion and religious belief is prohibited unless the consent of data subject is granted.

In the US, individuals generally cannot find out what data a broker holds on them, how a broker got it, or how it is used. There is no federal law that permits or enables consumers to see, make corrections to, or opt out of data compiled by brokers.

Files on individuals are generally sold in lists; examples cited in testimony to the U.S. Congress include lists of rape survivors, seniors with dementia, financially vulnerable people, people with HIV, police officers (by home address), alcoholics, and people with erectile dysfunction.

=== Calls for regulation in the US ===
A 2007 University of California study, after requesting and analyzing information-sharing practices at 86 companies, found many operating under an opt-out model that it described as inconsistent with consumer expectations, and recommended that the California state legislature require companies to disclose their information-sharing policies using clear, unambiguous language, and consider creating a centralized, user-friendly method for consumers to opt out of information-sharing.

The proposed US Data Accountability and Trust Act (introduced in 2009) contained a number of requirements for auditing and verification of accuracy of data held by information brokers, and additional measures in the case of a security breach. The bill also gave identified individuals the means and opportunity to review and correct the data held that related to them. It passed through the United States House of Representatives in the 111th United States Congress, but failed to pass the United States Senate. It was revived by the 112th United States Congress in 2011 as H.R. 1707., but died after being referred to committee. The bill was first introduced by Rep. Bobby Rush [D-IL1] on 30 April 2009, H.R. 2221.

In 2009, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission had recommended the United States Congress develop legislation enabling consumers to see the information that data brokers hold about them, a recommendation it renewed in subsequent reports in 2012 and 2014. In 2013, the U.S. Government Accountability Office also called for Congress to consider legislation.

In October 2019, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed into action statute AB 1202. This bill &quot;would require data brokers to register with, and provide certain information to, the Attorney General. The bill would define a data broker as a business that knowingly collects and sells to third parties the personal information of a consumer with whom the business does not have a direct relationship, subject to specified exceptions&quot;. This law was created to safeguard against the &quot;cloak of invisibility&quot; (unregistered, unregulated, untracked information broker) that previous data brokers roamed in. It was also meant to regulate the purchasing of data in commercial third party buyers, and tracks the data brokers information trades. 

Due to the interest in federal regulation, data broker firms have lobbied and spent $29 million in the year 2020.

=== Criticisms, consumer rights and breaches===
A United States Senate Committee in 2013 published &quot;A Review of the Data Broker Industry: Collection, Use, and Sale of Consumer Data for Marketing Purposes&quot;. It states that &quot;Today, a wide range of companies known as &#x27;data brokers&#x27; collect and maintain data on hundreds of millions of consumers, which they analyze, package, and sell generally without consumer permission or input.&quot; Their main findings were that:
*Data brokers collect a huge volume of detailed information on hundreds of millions of consumers.
*Data brokers sell products that identify financially vulnerable consumers.
*Data broker products provide information about consumer offline behavior to tailor online outreach by marketers.
*Data brokers operate behind a veil of secrecy.

The information produced by data brokers has been criticized for enabling discrimination in pricing, services and opportunities. For example, a May 2014 White House report found that web searches that included black-seeming first names such as Jermaine were more likely to result in ads being displayed that include the word &quot;arrest,&quot; compared with web searches including white-seeming first names such as Geoffrey.

An Online Information Broker FAQ is published by Privacy Rights Clearinghouse (PRC), a nonprofit consumer organization in the United States. PRC also maintains a list of information brokers, with links to their privacy policies, terms of service, and opt-out provisions.

Data brokers have also faced legal charges for security breaches due to poor data security practices.

==Professional associations==
The Association of Independent Information Professionals (AIIP) is a professional association based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, with members from 20 countries worldwide, representing both primary and secondary researchers.

== Fiction ==

Examples of information brokers in contemporary fiction would be the Shadow Broker in the video game series &quot;Mass Effect&quot;; Nicholas Wayne, Rachel, Elean Duga, Gustav St. Germain, Carol, and the President of the Daily Days newspaper company in &quot;Baccano!&quot;; or Izaya Orihara in the light novel series &quot;Durarara!!&quot;. A few of the characters in Neal Stephenson&#x27;s novel Snow Crash find work selling data as &quot;stringers&quot; for the Central Intelligence Corporation. Information broker characters play a prominent role in stories published by DC Comics. The character trope is best exemplified by the superhero Oracle, but the trope is later used with the characters Calculator, Proxy, Chloe Sullivan, and Felicity Smoak as well.

<text>Bansi Kaul (23 August 1949 – 6 February 2021) was an Indian theatre director and the founder of Rang Vidushak, a theatre group in Bhopal. He was a recipient of the Padma Shri, India&#x27;s fourth highest civilian honor, in 2014, and the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1995. Some of his notable plays included &quot;Aala Afsar, Kahan Kabir,&quot; and &quot;Sidhi Dar Sidhi urf Tukke pe Tukka.&quot; He was a designer and associate show director for the 2010 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony and also the art director for the 1986 and 1987 Khajuraho Festival.

==Early life==
Bansi Kaul was born on 23 August 1949 into a Kashmiri Pandit family in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, India. He was interested in art and painting from an early age. He was exposed to amateur theater groups in Kashmir. He moved to New Delhi to join the National School of Drama (NSD), but, did not qualify for the first time, before successfully retrying. He graduated from the institute with a specialization in stagecraft in 1973.

== Career ==
Kaul started his career as a director with National School of Drama&#x27;s NSD Repertory Company and was also a member of the faculty of the school&#x27;s department of extension, before forming his own theatre group in 1984. In 1986, he founded &quot;Rang Vidushak&quot;, a theater group based in Bhopal, that incorporated folk idioms into its production and evolved a new idiom of clown-theatre. The group performed in India and abroad in several languages such as Hindi, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Tamil and Sinhalese.

Kaul directed and produced over 100 plays through his career, with some of his notable plays included &quot;Aala Afsar&quot; based on Nikolai Gogol&#x27;s satirical play The Government Inspector, &quot;Kahan Kabir&quot; based on the collected works of poet-saint Kabir&quot;,&quot; and &quot;Sidhi Dar Sidhi urf Tukke pe Tukka&quot; an adaptation of Chinese folktale &quot;Three promotions in succession&quot;&quot;.&quot; Most of his plays were based on the Nautanki style of street theater. Other works included &quot;Mrichakatikam, Raja Agnivarna ka Pair, Agnileek, Veini Samhaar, Dashkumar Charitham, Sharvilk, Pancharathram, Andha Yug, Khel Guru Ka, Jo Ram Rachi Raakha, Aranyadhipathi Tantyamaama, Zindagi aur Zyonk, Vatan ka Raag, and Saudagar&quot;. In a review of a retrospective of his works &quot;Rang-Bansi&quot; (), newspaper &quot;The Hindu&quot; wrote, &quot;As a designer, he (Kaul) treads two worlds – the designer of mega events with plenty of resources and the designer of the theatrical productions suffering from utter paucity of funds.&quot;

Through his works, he explored the politics of laughter and studied riddles and myths across Indian traditional folk tales, including clowns, or &quot;Vidushak&quot;, into the central figure of his works. His last production &quot;Paglaye Gusse Ka Dhuan&quot; in 2019 was for the Lucknow based Bhartendu Natya Akademi. The play was based on the works of Kashmiri poets and addressed the topic of Exodus of Kashmiri Pandits during years of militancy in the state. 

Building on his training in stagecraft, he worked as the art director for the 1986 and 1987 Khajuraho Festival and also for the Festival of India in China, Switzerland, and the USSR. Kaul was one of the lead designers and an associate show director for the 2010 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony. Speaking about his mandate, he would say that the requirement was to bring Indian culture and themes to the event, without letting Bollywood come across as the &quot;only cultural identity of the country&quot;.

He was awarded the 1995 Sangeet Natak Akademi Award and the Padma Shri, India&#x27;s fourth highest civilian honor in 2014. He was also the recipient of the 2016 Rashtriya Kalidas Samman for &quot;Kahan Kabir&quot;. He received the 1994 Shikhar Samman from the Government of Madhya Pradesh, and the 1995 Safdar Hashmi Award from the Uttar Pradesh Sangeet Natak Akademi.

== Personal life ==
Kaul was married to theater artist Anjana Puri. Puri was a Sangeet Natak Akademi Awardee herself and composed music for many of his productions. 

Kaul died from cancer on 6 February 2021, in Delhi. He was 71.

<doc id="1330326" wikidata="Q2927516" url="?curid=1330326" title="Buddy Baer">
<text>Jacob Henry &quot;Buddy&quot; Baer (June 11, 1915 – July 18, 1986) was an American boxer and later an actor with parts in seventeen films, as well as roles on multiple television series in the 1950s and 1960s.

In 1941, he came extremely close to boxing stardom at Washington&#x27;s Griffith Stadium, when in the opinion of most ringside officials, Joe Louis gave him a disqualifying late sixth-round hit in a title match that should have made Baer the world heavyweight champion. He lost to Louis in a rematch for the title the following year but remained solidly ranked among the top heavyweights in the early 1940s. In 2003, Baer was chosen for &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of 100 greatest punchers of all time. He was the younger brother of boxing heavyweight champion and actor Max Baer, and the uncle of actor Max Baer Jr.

==Boxing career==
Baer was born in Denver, Colorado, on June 11, 1915, to father Jacob, a butcher, and mother Dora Bales. However, a few sources, such as his brother Max, list his birthplace as Omaha, Nebraska. He moved with his family to California in 1928, living first in Livermore in 1926 and then Hayward, before settling in the early 1930s in Sacramento, where he would later retire. Both Buddy and his brother Max had a large Jewish following, for they claimed Jewish ancestry on their father&#x27;s side and frequently wore a Star of David on their boxing trunks. Neither brother, however, appeared to be observant or openly religious, and their claims of Jewish heritage were questioned by trainer Ray Arcel. Standing at 6&#x27; &quot; (1.99 m), Baer fought from 1934 to 1942. Baer&#x27;s manager during the largest portion of his boxing career was Ancil Hoffman, who also managed Max&#x27;s career for a period.

===Early career===
In his professional debut, Baer knocked out Tiny Abbott, 1:54 into the first round on September 23, 1934, in Eureka, California. A boxer of some repute, the towering 6&#x27; 8&quot; Abbott had twice faced Baer&#x27;s brother Max, and though it was Baer&#x27;s first time in the ring, the more experienced Abbott was nearing the end of his career. Baer had a long winning streak following his debut fight until he met Babe Hunt. On January 10, 1935, Baer was defeated in a four-round bout, losing on points to Hunt at Boston&#x27;s Rickard Recreation Center. The loss was Baer&#x27;s first in thirteen straight fights, twelve of which Baer won by knockout. Though Hunt had a bad second round, he came back strongly in the third and fourth to win by unanimous decision.

He completed a technical knockout of Jack O&#x27;Dowd at 2:10 into the second round at Detroit&#x27;s Olympia Stadium on January 4, 1935. On a ticket that included Joe Louis, the total audience reached 15,853. The crowd witnessed a performance from Baer, who outweighed his opponent by 29 pounds, less than his typical advantage. In an odd victory, O&#x27;Dowd, who seemed to lack the will to fight, was down five times in the first round, in a few instances without actually being hit. Though O&#x27;Dowd had faced the great Joe Louis the previous year, he showed no desire to mix with Baer and appeared thoroughly outmatched. 

Frank Connolly, a former Golden Gloves champion, fell to Baer on March 20, 1935, in a convincing first-round knockout at the Oakland Auditorium before a substantial early-career crowd of 9,500. The final blow was a right hook that started low and came up with enormous power to knock out Connolly, who weighed 245, only a pound heavier than Baer.

Baer defeated Al Delaney on July 18, 1935, in a four-round knockout at Buffalo&#x27;s Offerman Stadium. In a complete victory, Baer had Delaney down five times before the referee counted him out 34 seconds into the fourth round from a right behind the ear. In the opening round, Baer was knocked to his knees by a strong left, but he recovered, and had his own way for the rest of the match.

===Match with Ford Smith===
On the ticket of the Max Baer-Joe Louis match, he had one of his most lucrative bouts on September 4, 1935, when he lost a six-round wind-up match to Ford Smith in New York before an immense crowd of 90,000 fans at Yankee Stadium. Baer tried to overpower Smith in the early rounds with his punching ability, but Smith moved, blocked, and weathered the storm. In later rounds, Baer was less effective with intermittent looping blows that Smith countered with sharp, short punches to the body. Baer was tired in the last round, and though he had an advantage in reach and weight, he did little damage in his final rally, having lost speed and precision in his blows. The more experienced Smith took four of the six rounds. According to one source, his purse for the match, which was the most heavily attended in New York history, was $42,000. Louis, who won the title match against brother Max, had a purse of $200,000.

At this early stage of his career, Baer suffered a rare loss on April 22, 1936, dropping a six-round decision to Frenchman Andre Lenglet at Oakland&#x27;s Municipal Auditorium. Baer looked strong in the first and had a brief rally in the fifth but lost his chance when Lenglet snapped back with a defense. One reporter, who wrote that Lenglet won each round by a large margin, noted that Baer failed to score with a telling blow throughout the match. Lenglet scored well with short left jabs to the face, and followups to the midriff and his frequent changes of pace confused Baer&#x27;s ability to use his strong right.

In an important match on May 24, 1937, Baer outpointed Jack London, later the holder of the Commonwealth Boxing Council&#x27;s Heavyweight title from 1944 to 1945. Baer won on points in a ten-round decision at Swansea, England, and though he had a significant advantage in height of nearly eight inches, he had only twenty pounds in weight over the sturdy London boxer. Two weeks earlier, Baer had defeated Jim Wilde at Harringay Arena in a fourth-round technical knockout. With dominance and punching power, he had Wilde down three times in the first round and for a count of eight in the third. After being knocked to the canvas for a count of five in the opening of the fourth, the referee called the match. British rules required ending a bout after five knockdowns.

===Match with top contender Abe Simon===
He brought a stop to seasoned Jewish heavyweight Abe Simon before 25,000 fans, on August 30, 1937, scoring a technical knockout at Yankee Stadium in 2:38 of the third round. Though Simon punished Baer severely in the first and had him hanging from the ropes with a two-fisted attack, Baer rallied in the second with sharp left jabs and a stinging right cross and had Simon down and then staggering in the third when the referee called the fight. Both fighters had exceptional weight and reach and though Baer had a two-inch advantage in height, Simon, a giant himself, actually outweighed Baer by seven pounds.

===Painful loss to Gunar Barlund===
Baer lost to gifted Finnish boxer Gunnar Barlund on March 4, 1938, before 8,565 fans in a seventh-round technical knockout at Madison Square Garden. Baer had a forty-pound weight advantage over Barlund, and -inch advantage in height, but lacked stamina and heart as the fight progressed. Baer performed well in the first, cutting Barlund&#x27;s forehead and nose with stinging left jabs and an occasional right, while Barlund lost points for low blows. In the second, however, Gunnar reached Baer with a few punches and then getting his range, took the second, third, and fourth. Baer maintained an edge in the fifth, and though both showed fatigue, Gunnar took the sixth, scoring at least ten straight rights and lefts without a return. In the seventh, Barlund drove Baer into the ropes with a heavy barrage. He followed him across the ring when Baer retreated and continued his attack, Baer seeming to give up, dropping his hands to his sides during the attack, and after coming from a clinch signaling the referee to end the fight. The referee asked Baer, apparently hurt, if he wished to continue, and decided to stop the fight, 1:36 into the seventh. Baer made no excuses for his performances but believed his layoff from the ring had affected his timing and ability to connect punches, particularly his right. Barlund successfully circled away from Baer&#x27;s hard overhand right.

===Three wins; Savold, Mann, and Blackshear===
He defeated Lee Savold in an important match on October 30, 1939, in an eight-round newspaper decision before 3,500 in Des Moine, Iowa. After a brief exchange, Baer had his opponent down for a count of eight in the first round from a right uppercut, and though Savold battled hard in the remaining rounds, he struggled to connect blows after his rough first round. Most reporters gave five rounds to Baer with only two to Savold in the hotly contested match.

He defeated Nathan Mann on May 3, 1940, before 5000, in a seventh-round technical knockout at New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden. In the match, Baer took the first four rounds, but Mann took the next four with cutting hooks to the head and body. A savage right hook in the opening of the seventh severely cut Mann&#x27;s eye, causing his handlers to end the fight.

Winning in a three-round technical knockout before 4,000 fans, he defeated accomplished boxer Harold Blackshear, who maintained a winning record and a 50% knockout percentage, on December 17, 1940, at Oakland&#x27;s Auditorium. Baer had the advantages of roughly five inches in reach, 5.5 inches in height, and 49 pounds in weight, as well as his superior punching ability. He toyed with Blackshear for the first two-and-a-half rounds, before commencing a clubbing and brutal assault in the third that led to the end of the charity bout. Many at ringside considered the bout a mismatch. Although he pocketed $2,500 for the contest, Baer had faced stronger opposition in the recent past, as Blackshear had dropped his last two fights, suffering a loss and a strong knockout.

===Loss to Eddie Blunt in Oakland===
Baer lost to Eddie Blunt on January 15, 1941, at the Auditorium in Oakland in a ten-round points decision. Though Baer was a 3-1 favorite in the early betting, Blunt won eight of the ten rounds. Despite a weight disadvantage of twenty-four pounds, Blunt kept Baer off balance with long lefts and stiff uppercuts throughout the match, and by the fifth had cut Baer&#x27;s eyes, after which Baer kept losing ground. The fifth through seventh rounds were hard fought with both boxers fighting toe to toe. Though Baer attempted a rally in the tenth, it was far too late to make up the points differential, though he managed to win the round. In the words of one reporter, &quot;Baer took one of the most beautiful shellackings of his erratic career&quot;. Baer required stitches above both eyes, and it was evident he would need a break before his next fight.

In a ramp up to a heavyweight title match, he defeated colorful contender Tony Galento before 8,500 fans on April 8, 1941, in a seventh-round technical knockout in Washington, D.C., when Galento had to discontinue the bout due to a broken hand. Galento took the first round backing Baer into the ropes with a few hard rights, but the second was even, and Baer took the remaining rounds. Baer used his superior reach in the remaining rounds to keep Galento from boring in, and in the fourth, he staggered Galento with a hard right to the mouth. Another solid blow in the sixth caused Galento to lose his mouthpiece, and there were some hard punches, but the match featured no knockdowns. The win was a solid one for Baer. Baer succeeded in connecting with solid lefts to Galento&#x27;s head and both lefts and rights to his body.

==World heavy title contender==

The highlight of his boxing career came in his two attempts to take the heavyweight boxing championship from Joe Louis. In their first fight on May 23, 1941, Baer caught Louis with a powerful left hook in the first round and knocked the champion out of the ring. Louis, however, hurt but unfazed, climbed back in before the count of ten, though many ringside believed Louis benefited from a long count. Louis eventually won the fight on a disqualification after he had knocked down Baer three times in the sixth. Baer claimed that his third knockdown came shortly after the bell had rung to end the sixth round. In the seventh, when Baer&#x27;s handlers refused to leave the ring as they protested what they believed was a late hit in the sixth, the referee, Arthur Donovan, disqualified Baer in a technical knockout for not resuming the match. In a controversial decision, the referee believed the last hit came before or during the final bell, but most ringside officials, including the official timekeeper, knockdown timekeeper, and both judges believed the final blow came after the bell, which should have disqualified Louis. The final decision of the boxing commissioner favored the referee, and Louis retained the title. Regardless of the decision, many ringside believed Louis would have eventually won the fight, as he punished Baer repeatedly in the sixth, and had fully recovered from his knockdown in the first. Baer, nonetheless, came closer to defeating Louis and taking the title than any of the other opponents Louis would face, until losing to Ezzard Charles in 1950.

In their rematch in Madison Square Garden, on January 9, 1942, before an estimated crowd of 19,000, Louis knocked Baer out in the first, after downing him two previous times. His second knockdown, after a barrage of blows and a thundering left hook, resulted in a count of nine. After rising to his feet again, Baer was battered around the ring and floored for the last time with a straight right to the head that put him down for a seven count. Unable to get up, the count was completed and the fight ended. Baer subsequently remarked, &quot;The only way I could have beaten Louis that night was with a baseball bat.&quot; A year later he said, &quot;I had to quit. I injured my neck in an auto crash before the fight&quot;.

==After boxing==
Baer retired from boxing after the second Louis bout and enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces at McClellan Air Force Base in 1942, the early years of America&#x27;s involvement in World War II.

With the war over, and his Army discharge complete in September 1945, he returned to Sacramento and started his most successful business, Buddy Baer&#x27;s Bar of Music at 1411 11th Street, which he opened with Fred Cullincini. He dabbled with less success in a variety of other businesses, including a health food store, a clothing shop, heavy equipment sales and real estate. After his brother Max&#x27;s death in 1959 of a heart ailment, he served as the national chairman for the Fraternal Order of Eagles Max Baer Heart Fund. He later worked as a marshal or sergeant at arms for the California State Legislature in the 1970s. For a number of years he supported himself as a nightclub singer, putting his bass-baritone voice to use at such places as New York&#x27;s Leon and Eddie&#x27;s, and the Charles Club in Baltimore. He performed in 1952 with Pearl Bailey at the Paramount Theatre in New York.

==Final years==
Baer&#x27;s last years were spent battling ailments that included diabetes, hypertension, and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. After a transfer from Sutter Memorial Hospital, he was admitted to the Martinez Veterans Hospital one week before his death and died on July 18, 1986, in Martinez, California. He was survived by his wife Vicki Farrell Brumbelow—whom he had married in 1964—a daughter Sheila, and three grandchildren. Baer had three previous marriages. His body is buried in East Lawn Sierra Hills Memorial Park in Sacramento. Both Buddy and his brother Max were known as the &quot;professional good guys&quot; or &quot;the genial giants&quot;. After their deaths, Sacramento sports reporter Billy Conlin wrote, &quot;When they died, the &#x27;sweet science&#x27; lost two of the sweetest!&quot;

==Television==
In 1957, Baer appeared in an episode of television&#x27;s Gunsmoke, the episode entitled, &quot;Never Pester Chester&quot;. In 1958, Baer appeared in an episode of the syndicated &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; TV series, playing the role of Atlas, a circus strongman, who is duped by his fellow circus performers into stealing for them. They tell him that Superman is a crook and that he can help right the Man of Steel&#x27;s wrongs by doing so.

In 1958, Baer appeared in Season 1 Episode 33 of Wagon Train, “The Daniel Hogan Story”. He played a boxer nicknamed “The Tinsmith”.

<doc id="1330334" wikidata="Q6670959" url="?curid=1330334" title="London Underground diesel locomotives">
<text>Diesel locomotives have seen limited use on the London Underground, largely because exhaust gases cannot be discharged when the vehicles are working in tunnels. A prototype diesel engine numbered DEL120 was built in 1939 from two 1915 stock motor cars, which was expected to be part of a batch of ten, but experience with battery locomotives showed that these were a better alternative. Three 0-6-0 diesels (DL81-DL83) were obtained in 1971, to replace the last steam engines, but were too short to operate the signalling system, and too heavy for some of the bridges. In 1996, fourteen diesels (numbered 1 through 14, but also given female names) were supplied by Schöma of Germany, which were used during the construction of the Jubilee line tunnels. They were fitted with exhaust scrubbers, to enable them to work in the tunnels. To speed up track renewals on the subsurface lines, Class 66 locomotives have been hired in since 2006 to handle permanent way trains, but again suffer from being too heavy for some of the bridges. Because they are not fitted with tripcock safety devices, and pull trains much longer than the signalling system is designed for, they are restricted to slow speed running.

==DEL120==

===Design===
The design of a prototype diesel locomotive which could work through London&#x27;s tube tunnels was first considered in 1936, and work began on its construction at Acton Works in 1939. It was designed to use its diesel engine when in the open air, but to draw current from the third and fourth rail when underground. Two Brush built 1915 Stock (also known as &#x27;Ealing Stock&#x27;) driving motors, numbered 3937 and 3941, which had been withdrawn from the Central London line, were converted into the electro-diesel locomotive. The work involved scrapping the passenger saloons and joining the two driving ends together to form a double ended locomotive. The central bay held a six-cylinder two-stroke diesel engine, manufactured by Petters, which was coupled to a direct current generator.

===Construction===
The prototype, which was the first electro-diesel locomotive to be constructed in Britain, was completed in November 1940, and was painted in Metropolitan &#x27;Lake&#x27;, with gold lining. It was intended to build ten similar locomotives, to replace the fleet of steam engines, and a further 18 withdrawn motor cars were stored at Cockfosters depot with this in mind. The construction of further locomotives was delayed by the outbreak of the Second World War, and experience with the 1935 fleet of battery locomotives showed that these were a better solution.

===Service===
DEL120 entered normal service in 1941, but was not a success, as the complicated operating system resulted in frequent breakdowns and repairs. It was used initially around Watford, and was transferred to Hainault to work ballast trains after an overhaul in 1952. It was moved to Golders Green depot temporarily, to operate a works train while an experimental ground wheel lathe was installed. The diesel engine was removed in 1954, after which it was only used for shunting, initially at Hainault and later at Acton. It was not ideal as a shunting engine, as visibility from the cab was poor, and access difficult, and so it was idle from 1956, finally being scrapped in 1958.

==DL81-DL83==

Three Rolls-Royce-engined diesel-hydraulic locomotives were built in 1967–68, and were supplied to an open-cast iron ore mine at Corby. When the iron ore was worked out, the locomotives were surplus to requirements, and were acquired by London Transport in 1971. They were numbered in the range DL81-DL83. All three were standard 0-6-0DH Sentinel diesel shunters obtained from Thomas Hill (Rotherham) Ltd (the Rolls Royce/Sentinel dealer). They were painted dark green and operated at Neasden and Lillie Bridge depots where they replaced the last of the ex-GWR pannier tank steam locomotives.

The locomotives had a wheelbase of only , and this was too short to operate the track circuits. Since this made their use impracticable, each was permanently coupled to a tender, which consisted of a bogie removed from a redundant District line Q Stock car. The weight of the bogie was increased to 17 tons, and it was fitted with tripcocks and sleet brushes, so that it could be used for clearing snow and ice from the current rails. Although the tenders were permanently coupled to the locomotives, they carried separate numbers, and were identified as DT81, DT82 and DT83. The tender increased the wheelbase to .

One locomotive was normally operational at each of the depots, with the third kept as a spare. Transfers between the works occurred when maintenance or repairs were necessary. Movement outside of the depots was severely restricted when the civil engineering department decided that the short wheelbase and 16-ton axle loading might cause overloading problems on a number of bridges. Both the free end (front) of the locomotive and the tender were fitted with &#x27;Ward&#x27; type couplers as well as normal buffers and couplings to allow them the couple to almost any Departmental rolling stock (at the time).

The locomotives had all been withdrawn from service by March 1993, as engineers trains were no longer operated from Neasden Depot. Two locomotives were subsequently preserved; no. DL82 on the Epping Ongar Railway and no. DL83 on the Nene Valley Railway. The third locomotive, no. DL81, was sold for further use with an industrial user.

==Schöma==
In connection with the construction of the Jubilee Line Extension project, fourteen diesel-hydraulic locomotives were purchased from Schöma of Germany to assist in equipping the tunnels prior to electrification. Weighing 33.88 tonnes each, they are long, and are powered by six-cylinder inline diesel engines, which give them a maximum speed of . They entered service from February 1996, are built to tube tunnel loading gauge, and were fitted with buckeye couplers when built. They are equipped with exhaust scrubbers to prevent soot and other particles from being expelled into the tunnels. The locomotives have since been used on other engineering projects. When not in use they can be found at Lillie Bridge Depot or Ruislip depot.

Following the completion of the Jubilee Line extension, ownership of the vehicles was transferred to London Underground Transplant. Numbers 1 and 5 have been modified by fitting Wedglock couplers so that they can be used to shunt tube stock, whilst numbers 3 and 6 have been fitted with emergency couplers.

The locomotives were sold by an auction on 14 August 2024.
==Leased locomotives==

===Class 66===
Metronet contracted five newly built Class 66 locomotives from GB Railfreight in order to speed up track replacement works on the London Underground network. They were first used in August 2006, pulling engineering trains consisting of wagons and high-output track laying equipment nearly long. The locomotives are capable of hauling consists with a maximum length of , thus reducing from 30 to 8 the number of trains needed to supply materials to relay a typical weekend possession of track, and as a consequence increasing the amount of track that can be renewed. One disadvantage of the heavier locomotives is that bridges on the District line needed to be strengthened to carry the extra weight. While working on the network, they are restricted to a maximum speed of , since they are not fitted with tripcocks, and the signalling infrastructure is only designed to cope with trains having a maximum length of .

<doc id="1330342" wikidata="Q1224370" url="?curid=1330342" title="Stierlitz">
<text>Max Otto von Stierlitz (, ) is the lead character in a Russian book series written in the 1960s by Yulian Semyonov, and the television adaptation &quot;Seventeen Moments of Spring&quot; (starring Vyacheslav Tikhonov) as well as feature films (produced in the Soviet era) and a number of sequels and prequels. Other actors portrayed Stierlitz in several other films. Stierlitz has become a stereotypical spy in Soviet and post-Soviet culture, similar to James Bond in Western culture. American historian Erik Jens has described Stierlitz as the &quot;most popular and venerable hero of Russian spy fiction&quot;.

==Character origins==
The culture of Imperial Russia was very strongly influenced by that of France, and Russian writers accordingly shared the disdain traditionally held by French writers towards spy novels, which was seen as a lowbrow type of literature. In the Soviet Union, espionage was depicted before 1961 as something committed against the Soviet state by its enemies and not as an activity that the Soviet state itself engaged in. Perhaps the best example of this attitude was the founding of SMERSH in 1943, which was an acronym for the wartime slogan &quot;Smert&#x27; shpionam!&quot; (&quot;Death to Spies!&quot;), which reflected the picture promoted by the Soviet state of spies as a disreputable type of person who deserved to be killed without mercy. Furthermore, the legacy of the &quot;Yezhovshchina&quot; and other Stalinist repression had given the &quot;Chekisty,&quot; as secret policemen are always called in Russia, a very negative image. In November 1961, Vladimir Semichastny became chairman of the KGB and set out to improve the image of the &quot;Chekisty&quot;. 

Semichastny wanted to erase the memory of the &quot;Yezhovshchina&quot; and give the KGB a more positive image. It was during his tenure as KGB chairman from 1961 to 1967 that the cult of the &quot;hero spies&quot; began in the Soviet Union, the Soviet media lionising the achievements of spies such as Harold &quot;Kim&quot; Philby, Richard Sorge, and Colonel Rudolf Abel. Inspired by the popularity of the James Bond novels in the West, Semichastny also encouraged Soviet writers to write novels featuring heroic &quot;Chekisty&quot; as their heroes. One such novel was &quot;No Password Required&quot; (1966) by Yulian Semyonov, set in the Russian Civil War, which marked the first appearance of the heroic Cheka agent Maxim Maximovich Isaуev. In 1967, Semichastny was replaced as KGB chairman by Yuri Andropov who likewise encouraged writers to publish novels featuring heroic &quot;Chekisty&quot;.

In January-February 1969, the novel &quot;Seventeen Moments of Spring&quot; by Semyonov, a sequel to &quot;No Password Required,&quot; was serialized in &quot;Pravda&quot; and published as a book later in 1969. The novel was set in Berlin in March-May 1945 as the Red Army advanced onto Berlin, causing the Nazis to become more desperate while Isayev, who has gone undercover in Berlin under the alias Max Otto von Stierlitz, outmaneuvers their plans. Impressed by the favorable public response to &quot;Seventeen Moments of Spring&quot;, Andropov pressed to have the book adopted as a television mini-series, which was filmed in 1971–72. &quot;Seventeen Moments of Spring&quot; was one of the most expensive Soviet television productions ever filmed, being shot on a lavish scale that was unusual for Soviet television. All of the leading parts were played by famous and well respected actors, which certainly contributed to its appeal. The mini-series caused much protest by the Red Army, who complained that the series gave the impression that it was the NKVD that won the Great Patriotic War, as the war with Germany is known in the Soviet Union. The director Tatyana Lioznova was subsequently ordered to add in new scenes showing the Red Army advancing and taking Berlin, which added another year to its production, causing the mini-series to debut in 1973 instead of 1972 as planned. To save money and give a sense of authenticity, the battle scenes Lioznova added were mostly stock footage from the war. The mini-series &quot;Seventeen Moments of Spring&quot; was another enormous hit in 1973, attracting an average of 30-40 million viewers per night and turning the Isayev character into a cultural phenomena in the Soviet Union.

==Character==
In &quot;Seventeen Moments of Spring&quot;, Stierlitz is the cover name for a Soviet super-spy Colonel Maxim Maximovich Isaуev (Макси́м Макси́мович Иса́ев), whose real name is Vsevolod Vladimirovich Vladimirov (Все́волод Влади́мирович Владимиров).

Stierlitz is assigned a role in the SS Reich Main Security Office in Berlin during World War II, infiltrating Ausland-SD (foreign intelligence) headed by Walter Schellenberg. Working deep undercover, Stierlitz tries to collect intelligence about the Germans&#x27; war plans and communicate it to Moscow. He receives instructions from Moscow on how to proceed, on one occasion traveling to Switzerland on a secret mission. He diverts the German nuclear &quot;Vengeance Weapon&quot; research program into a fruitless dead-end, thwarts separate peace talks between Nazi Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States, engages in intellectual games with members of the Nazi high command and sacrifices his own happiness for the good of his motherland. Despite being racked with desire to return home to his wife he subordinates his feelings to his duty, thus embodying an idealised Soviet vision of patriotism.

Stierlitz is quite the opposite of the action-oriented James Bond; most of the time he gains his knowledge without any Bond-style stunts and gadgets, while in the film adaptation of the stories the action is presented through a narrative voice-over by Yefim Kopelyan. He is presented in a deeply patriotic but non-ideological light, fighting to defend the Soviet motherland against external enemies rather than just defending the Communist government against its ideological opponents. Stierlitiz engages in a lengthy &quot;battle of the wits&quot; with the Nazi leaders, especially his nemesis the Gestapo chief Heinrich Müller who knows that there is a Soviet spy in Berlin and gradually closes in on Stierlitz. Much of the dramatic tension in both the book and the mini-series comes from the way that Müller, who is portrayed here as a relentless Javert-like figure moves irrevocably towards the conclusion that Stierlitz is the mole, who in turn knows he can only delay the inevitable, but chooses to stay on as long as possible to sabotage the German war effort as much as he can. In what appeared to be a joke on the part of the mini-series&#x27;s producers, the part of Müller was played by the Jewish actor Leonid Bronevoy. Unlike the real Müller, a very ambitious and rather crude career policeman whose only interest was power, Bronevoy portrayed Müller as having a certain suave charm whose conversations with Stierlitz, which however pleasant on the surface, were really attempts to probe who he really is. 

Using the real life Operation Sunrise as its inspiration, both the novel and mini-series depicted Allen Dulles, the chief of the American OSS operations for Central Europe engaging in peace talks in Switzerland with Karl Wolff, the Higher SS Police Chief of Italy, which was historically correct; however the picture of the United States seeking an alliance with Nazi Germany against the Soviet Union was not. The picture of Operation Sunrise as an attempt to form an American-German alliance was widely accepted in the Soviet Union and Harrison Salisbury, the Moscow correspondent of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, found himself in 1973-74 being regularly criticized by ordinary Soviet citizens who fumed at the alleged American perfidy against the Soviet Union during the Dulles-Wolff talks. However, there is a kernel of truth to the version of the Dulles-Wolff talks offered in &quot;Seventeen Moments of Spring&quot; in that the Soviets were not informed of Operation Sunrise at first, and expressed much suspicion of Operation Sunrise when they did learn of the talks, believing that Dulles was engaged in something underhanded against them. 

An aspect of both the novel and TV versions of &quot;Seventeen Moments of Spring&quot; that has greatly annoyed Westerners who are more accustomed to seeing spy stories via the prism of the fast-paced Bond stories is the way that Stierlitz spends much time interacting with ordinary Germans who he meets during his long walks on the streets and parks of Berlin despite the fact these interactions do nothing to advance the plot as these scenes are utterly superfluous to the story. However, the point of these scenes are to show that Stierlitz is still a moral human being, who remains sociable and kind to all people, including the citizens of the state that his country is at war with despite the way that state has killed millions of his own people. Unlike Bond, Stierlitz is devoted to his wife who he deeply loves and despite spending at least ten years as a spy in Germany and having countless chances to sleep with attractive German women remains faithful towards her. The brooding, thoughtful and quiet Stierlitiz who remains devoted to his wife who he has not seen for years reflects a certain Russian ideal of a romantic hero. 

In an entirely unrealistic scene, Stierlitz&#x27;s beloved wife is smuggled into Berlin to be allowed to see him from a café in Berlin opposite another café on the other side of the street which he is in; for six minutes Stierlitz and his wife stare longingly at each other before departing without saying a word. Through Stierlitz is a spy for the NKVD as the Soviet secret police was known from 1934 to 1946, it is stated quite explicitly in &quot;Semnadtsat&#x27; mgnoveniy vesny&quot; (which is set in 1945) that he left the Soviet Union to go undercover in Nazi Germany &quot;more than ten years ago&quot;, which means that Stierlitz was not involved in any way in the &quot;Yezhovshchina&quot;. Unlike most Soviet productions, Stierlitz is described as working for Russia rather than the Soviet Union or &quot;the party&quot;, suggesting that he is first and foremost a Russian patriot rather than a Communist. Unlike many Soviet productions, most of the ordinary Germans Stierlitz meets are portrayed in a favorable light with the implied message that the ordinary Germans were not responsible for Nazi crimes. Instead, the message of both the book and the TV show was that ordinary Germans were in a certain sense victims of the Nazi leaders who are shown as treating their own people with a callous contempt.

Through &quot;Semnadtsat&#x27; mgnoveniy vesny&quot; was a KGB sponsored production, many people who saw the mini-series viewed the Stierlitz character as a metaphor for dissidents in the Soviet Union. The way that Stierlitiz, who despite being in the presence of mostly sympathetic people has to hide at all times who he really is, what he is really doing and what he really believes, was seen as an inspiring metaphor for dissidents in the Brezhnev era Soviet Union. Much of the Soviet &quot;intelligentsia&quot; saw parallels between Siterlitiz, who can never say what he really feels and their own situation in the Soviet Union, which helped to make the character an iconic figure even to those who feared the KGB, and contributed to his appeal even after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The American scholar Erik Jens has argued that the &quot;dog whistles&quot; in the mini-series such as scenes where Stierlitz buys luxury goods on the black markets of Berlin such as French cigarettes and cognac, which he greatly enjoys, which Soviet viewers took as an allegory for buying forbidden Western goods on Soviet black markets (a very common practice in the Soviet Union), were intentionally added in to give the series credibility with the Soviet public. The fact that Stierlitz buys goods on the black markets of Berlin that were otherwise unobtainable in a wartime economy helped to make the character more appealing to a Soviet audience in the 1970s who likewise had to frequently resort to the black markets to obtain basic goods that were not readily available in the stores. &quot;Seventeen Moments of Spring&quot; was unusual amongst Soviet television series in having a hero who enjoys certain Western luxuries as normally in Soviet TV Western luxury goods were associated with decadence and corruption and as a result shunned by the protagonists. 

Jens noted that Stierlitz is often called the &quot;Russian James Bond&quot; that description is incorrect as the Stierlitz is &quot;...not nearly as cartoonish or formulaic a figure as Agent 007 or indeed the majority of Western, especially American, fictional spies&quot;. Jens argued that the heavy losses taken by the Soviet Union in the Great Patriotic War ensured that Soviet audiences could never accept an ultra-violent figure like James Bond as a hero, instead preferring a mere cerebral, intellectual hero like Stierlitz who wins by his cunning and his intelligence. Jens wrote: &quot;No fictional Russian spy, either approved by the Kremlin or accepted by Soviet citizenry, could take such a cartoonish view of life and death as do James Bond and his countless Western imitations&quot;. Jens argued that Stierlitz is far closer to George Smiley rather than James Bond, but that comparison does not entirely work as: &quot;Bond is a pop culture icon, on the same plane as Superman, Tintin, or Mickey Mouse. And however intricately and realistically John le Carré rendered him or how compellingly Gary Oldman or the late Alec Guinness played him on-screen, Smiley remains a creature of the shadowy intelligence world, known mainly to the fans of the genre and having little to say to the wider culture&quot;. Jens wrote the character whom Stierlitz mostly closely resembles is Atticus Finch as both characters are &quot;morally complex and admirable&quot; men operating in deeply amoral worlds (the segregationist Deep South of the 1930s, Nazi Germany) who do their best to retain their integrity and work to redeem despised professions (i.e. lawyer, spy). In much the same way that the part of Atticus Finch came to be identified with Gregory Peck, the part of Stierlitz likewise came to be identified with Vyacheslav Tikhonov, and the Russian people have never really accepted any other actors playing the character. Jens noted that both Finch and Stierlitz play the same role in their respective national cultures as embodying certain ideals about their respective professions as Finch is the sort of lawyer that Americans wish that they had while Stierlitz is the sort of spy that Russians wish that they had.

==Influences in Russian culture==
Although Stierlitz was a much-loved character, he was also the butt of a common genre of Russian jokes, often satirising his deductive trains of thought, with unexpected twists, delivered in the deadpan style of the voice-overs in the film adaptations; for example:

Stierlitz continues to be a popular character in modern Russia. Despite the fact that references and Stierlitz jokes remain in contemporary speech, &quot;Seventeen Moments of Spring&quot; is very popular mainly because it is quite patriotic. It is repeated annually on Russian television, usually around Victory Day. Stierlitz also continues to have a political significance. When his actor Vyacheslav Tikhonov died in December 2009, the Foreign Intelligence Service—one of the successor organisations of the former Soviet KGB—sent its condolences to his family. Ivan Zassoursky notes that Russian Prime Minister (and former and current President) Vladimir Putin, a former KGB agent, has been portrayed as &quot;embod[ying] the image—very important for the Russian television audience—of Standartenführer von Stierlitz... If anyone missed the connection between Putin, who served in Germany, and von Stierlitz, articles in the press reminded them of the resemblance and helped create the association.&quot; The connection went both ways; Putin was strongly influenced by the novels, commenting: &quot;What amazed me most of all was how one man&#x27;s effort could achieve what whole armies could not.&quot; Putin himself first came to public attention in 1991 when as an aide to Anatoly Sobchak, the mayor of Leningrad (modern St. Petersburg), he performed for Soviet television an iconic scene from the television mini-series, making much of the fact that both he and Stierlitz were &quot;Chekisty&quot;.

Stierlitz movies contributed a number of catchphrases, such as &quot;Character: nordic, robust&quot; (Характер — нордический, выдержанный, a personal characteristic, usually mocking or ironic).

In the movie Seventeen Moments of Spring Stierlitz has the longest scene of complete silence in the history of Russian sound cinema when Stirlitz silently meets with his wife for five and a half minutes.

<doc id="1330346" wikidata="Q843770" url="?curid=1330346" title="Broadcasting System of San-in">
<text>is a Japanese radio station and TV station broadcasting in Tottori Prefecture and Shimane Prefecture.

The station is affiliated with Japan Radio Network (JRN), National Radio Network (NRN) and Japan News Network (JNN).

==Head office==
*1-1-71, Nishi-Fukuhara, Yonago, Tottori Prefecture

==History==
The predecessor company, Radio San-in Broadcasting Co., Ltd. (RSB: Radio San-in Broadcasting Co., Ltd.), was founded by Ichiro Nosaka, who majored in radio before the war and was the head of the Sakai Coast Guard communications station after the war. In response to the amendments to the Broadcasting Law and Radio Law in April 1950, his younger brother Shinzo (father of the former Yonago Mayor Yasuo Saka), a radio engineer, made full-fledged plans to open a radio station, which had been under consideration until then. Yasuhisa Nosaka, the father of both of the brothers and a prominent local figure who served as a member of the Yonago City Council even before the war, agreed with their idea, and the three of them drew up an application for establishment, and the local business community With the cooperation of Yonago Shinkin Bank chairman Kisaburo Aoto (at the time), who was a good understanding of Yasuhisa, he supported Heibei Sakaguchi (2nd), Choemon Ta (23rd), and Yonehara. Shozo and others participated as promoters, and Hideyuki Miyoshi became the representative and submitted the application in December 1952. The following year, in September 1953, it was granted a preliminary license.

As stated in Yasuo&#x27;s reminiscences, the office building at the time of its opening was located on the second floor of the Oyasu Building in Yonago City. There was a pachinko parlor on the first floor. The entrance was also shared with a pachinko parlor, and employees and performers had to pass through the pachinko machines that were open. The studio reportedly struggled with soundproofing to prevent the noise from the pachinko machines. For this reason, at the time of its opening, it was nicknames Pachinko Broadcasting Station. In addition, the transmitting station was rented out at the facilities of NTT.

After that, its television broadcasts started on December 15, 1959, and changed the company name to &quot;San-in Broadcasting Co., Ltd.&quot; (abbreviation BSS: Broadcasting System of San-in Inc.) on June 1, 1961.

==Supplement==
Although this broadcasting station belongs to JNN/JRN/NRN, it was also once associated with Asahi Shimbun. Therefore, on BSS radio, the Asahi Shimbun news of independence work are broadcast during the morning. That key stations differ on radio and television Since the system of the area of the television station opened from the second half of the 1950s to the second half of the 1960s was 1 prefecture 1 wave in principle when beginning television broadcasting of this broadcasting station, In Tottori Prefecture in which Nihonkai TV (日本海テレビ) which had already begun broadcast at this time exists, it is because its service cannot be started, but it is Shimane Prefecture which had not prepared the television station yet then and its service was to be started first. And already, the request of a start of television broadcasting was replied to Tottori Prefecture, and Tottori Prefecture has also started television broadcasting at last in September 1972. Simultaneous broadcast of the program besides the series which Nihonkai TV, such as a &quot;morning news show&quot; and &quot;Doraemon&quot;, and San-in Chuo TV (山陰中央テレビ) are treating to one time in television broadcasting till September 1989 might be carried out also by BSS.

<text>David Nicola Cicilline ( ; born July 15, 1961) is an American lawyer and politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 2011 to 2023. A member of the Democratic Party, he was the 36th mayor of Providence from 2003 to 2011, the first openly gay mayor of a U.S. state capital.

Cicilline chaired the House Judiciary Committee&#x27;s Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law. In this role, he has supported efforts to modernize antitrust law. On September 29, 2022, he was elected chair of the House Middle East, North Africa, and Global Counterterrorism subcommittee, succeeding Ted Deutch, who resigned from the House on September 30, 2022. In November 2022, Cicilline announced he would run against outgoing Majority Whip Leader Jim Clyburn as Assistant Democratic Leader, the fourth senior position in the Democratic House caucus. Cicilline later dropped his bid for assistant minority leader.

In February 2023, Cicilline announced his resignation from Congress, effective June 1, 2023, to become president and chief executive officer of the Rhode Island Foundation.

==Early life, education, and legal career==
Cicilline was born July 15, 1961, in Providence, Rhode Island. His mother, Sabra (née Peskin), is Jewish, and his father, John Francis &quot;Jack&quot; Cicilline, is Italian American and Catholic. His father was a prominent attorney in Providence who defended local Mafia figures in the 1970s and 1980s, and was an aide to Mayor Joseph A. Doorley Jr.

He was raised in Providence before moving to Narragansett. In high school, he served as president of his graduating class, and participated in the Close Up Washington civic education program before attending Brown University, where he established a branch of the College Democrats with his classmate John F. Kennedy Jr. He graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; with a degree in political science in 1983. He then went to Georgetown University Law Center, where he earned a J.D.

He remained in Washington, D.C. for a while to work as a lawyer at the Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia.

In 1992, he ran for the Rhode Island Senate against incumbent senator Rhoda Perry, but lost the Democratic primary. Two years later, he was elected to the Rhode Island House of Representatives, representing the 4th district on Providence&#x27;s East Side.

==Mayor of Providence (2003–2011)==

===Elections===
;2002

Cicilline defeated Joseph R. Paolino, Jr, Keven A. McKenna, and David V. Igliozzi in the Democratic primary.

In November 2002, Cicilline was elected in a landslide with 84% of the vote, following the downfall of controversial mayor Buddy Cianci and the aftermath of Operation Plunder Dome. He succeeded acting mayor John J. Lombardi, who served out Cianci&#x27;s term and decided not to run in the 2002 election.

;2006

In 2006, Cicilline defeated Christopher F. Young in the Democratic primary. He went on to win an easy reelection with 83% of the vote.

===Tenure===
;Approval ratings
A Brown University survey from September 2007 found that 64% of state residents approved of the job Cicilline was doing in Providence. By February 2008, that number had dropped to 51%. In September 2008, his popularity fell to 46%.

;Affiliations
Cicilline was the 2008 President of the National Conference of Democratic Mayors. As mayor, he was a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, a bipartisan group with the stated goal of &quot;making the public safer by getting illegal guns off the streets&quot;. Boston Mayor Thomas Menino and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg co-chaired the Coalition.

In 2009, Cicilline served as one of six selection committee members for the Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence.

;Focus
Cicilline&#x27;s administration focused on the residential neighborhoods of Providence, as well as the &quot;Renaissance&quot; areas of downtown and Federal Hill that thrived under Cianci, and continued the promotion of the city via the tax breaks given to artists and movie productions. A former state legislator, he overcame the animosity between state and city government that had existed under Cianci.

;Student head tax
In May 2009, Cicilline gained national headlines after proposing a $150 per semester Head Tax on each of the 25,000 college students attending four universities in the city. The tax was an effort to close $6–$8 million of a reported $17 million city budget shortfall. The Associated Press reported that if enacted, it would become the first-in-the-nation tax on students simply for being enrolled and attending college within the city limits.

;Environment
Cicilline has expressed concern about the Providence metropolitan area&#x27;s carbon footprint. As mayor, he sought to implement a streetcar/light rail-type system for the city. He also focused efforts to fight poverty. He won passage of a vacant-and-abandoned property penalty, to provide an economic disincentive for banks to keep properties off the housing market for extended periods of time. He also proposed municipal bonds for the purpose of buying foreclosed properties to expand housing.

;After school programs
Cicilline is a strong proponent of after-school activities as a means of improving opportunities for children. As mayor, Cicilline served as Chair of the Standing Committee for Children, Health and Human Services of the United States Conference of Mayors. He has also been recognized for his efforts to establish youth programming and to strengthen ties among schools, businesses and local government, in order to expand access to after-school programming. Under Cicilline, city officials worked with Rhode Island&#x27;s Education Partnership to form PASA, the Providence After School Alliance. Cicilline also serves on the board of the national nonprofit Afterschool Alliance, an organization that works to promote and to support after-school activities for all children.

;Prostitution
Between 1980 and 2009, most prostitution was legal in Rhode Island. As mayor, Cicilline was a strong advocate for outlawing it. Cicilline personally testified in Superior Court to stop the opening of &quot;spas&quot; in Providence, and discussed his position in the 2009 documentary &quot;Happy Endings?&quot;.
 He lobbied for a prostitution law—not only to arrest sex workers and their customers, but also to fine landlords that permitted prostitution on their premises. On September 2, 2009, Cicilline submitted an ordinance to the City Council to ban indoor prostitution in the city, imposing a $500 fine and a potential 30-day prison sentence on violators. On November 3, 2009, Rhode Island Governor Donald Carcieri signed into law a bill making the buying and selling of sexual services a crime.

;Democratic presidential primaries
During the 2008 Democratic primaries, Cicilline supported Hillary Clinton. In August 2008, he attended the Democratic National Convention in Denver. While there, he told an interviewer that he now supported Barack Obama, saying &quot;[t]here is a real sense of hope and optimism about what we&#x27;re about to do, and about a change in leadership in this country”.

===Controversies===
;ICE controversy with Governor Carcieri
On June 8, 2008, Marco Riz, an undocumented immigrant from Guatemala who had been arrested twice the previous year while under a deportation order, was charged with the robbery and rape of a 30-year-old woman. A federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent criticized the Providence Police Department for not checking Riz&#x27;s immigration status at the time of his previous arrest. The governor of Rhode Island, Donald Carcieri, blamed Cicilline for the department&#x27;s failure. Previously, Carcieri had signed an executive order requiring all state officials to work with ICE on arrests or hirings of undocumented immigrants. When Carcieri asked the same of local agents, Providence Police Chief Dean Esserman refused. Cicilline responded that it has been the policy of the Police Department to work with ICE and its database on all arrests, that the policy had been followed when Riz was arrested, and that the ICE had failed to act.

On July 8, 2008, Rhode Island Governor Donald Carcieri claimed that Cicilline was not upholding his oath of office by failing to report undocumented immigrants, and suggested that the U.S. Attorney investigate the mayor. Mayor Cicilline responded by accusing Carcieri of &quot;playing politics&quot;. Eight days later, Cicilline wrote an op-ed in &quot;The Providence Journal,&quot; stating that the city always has and will continue to report all arrests to immigration authorities, and that the focus is therefore inappropriate.

;Firefighters&#x27; union contract arbitration
Beginning in 2003, Cicilline was engaged in a dispute with the Providence Firefighters labor union, Local 799. In a July 2002 email Cicilline sent to the members of Local 799, he indicated that he hoped to resolve their pending contract dispute with the city within 30 days of taking office. In August, Cicilline said in an interview that it was impossible for him to promise to bring the contract negotiations to a successful conclusion, owing to the unpredictability of his negotiating partners. The city and the union had been in arbitration in every contract year since 2002, with Cicilline appealing one arbitration decision to the Rhode Island Supreme Court. The appeal was rejected.

In 2004, Democratic vice presidential nominee John Edwards canceled a fundraising appearance in Providence in support of the Local 799. In 2007, Hillary Clinton asked Cicilline, a Clinton supporter, not to attend a Clinton rally, because of threats by the union to picket the appearance.

Both the Rhode Island AFL-CIO and the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) censured Cicilline for his conduct in this matter. In 2009, due to the union picketline, the Obama administration canceled Joe Biden&#x27;s appearance at the U.S. Conference of Mayors in Providence, in the interests of remaining neutral in the conflict.

;Tax office controversy
In June 2008, John M. Cicilline, brother of Mayor Cicilline, pleaded guilty to conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and making false statements for his role in the courthouse corruption scheme. Federal prosecutors indicted John M. Cicilline, disbarred attorney Joseph Bevilacqua Jr., and two assistants in January 2007. According to court documents, the two attorneys spun a complicated scheme to win leniency in a drug trafficking case.

Before reporting to prison, John M. Cicilline gave the city of Providence a $75,000 check for taxes owed by a client, but asked that the check not be cashed, and only held as collateral. Two of the mayor&#x27;s top aides told the city tax collector, Robert Ceprano, not to cash the check because it would bounce. In four instances, Ceprano said mayoral aides pressured him to perform tax favors for the mayor&#x27;s friends and/or campaign contributors. The mayor claimed the taxpayers had been given relief because the city had made errors on their taxes, not because they were his friends or contributors. During the controversy, Ceprano was fired.

On May 10, 2009, Robert Ceprano filed a lawsuit against the City of Providence, alleging conspiracy, corruption, libel, and wrongful termination. The suit accused John M. Cicilline, the mayor&#x27;s imprisoned brother, of attempting to defraud the City of Providence by writing a bad check for $75,000 on behalf of a delinquent taxpayer. Furthermore, it alleged the mayor and his aides &quot;willfully conspired...to conceal John M. Cicilline&#x27;s illegal activities&quot;. Ceprano also charged that he was fired not for poor job performance, but because he resisted the mayor&#x27;s efforts to perform tax favors for political friends and supporters. Lawyers for Ceprano asked for $10 million. Judge Kristin Rodgers dismissed the single-count complaint against John M. Cicilline on November 17, 2009.

;Budget controversy

Shortly after assuming office, Cicilline&#x27;s successor as the Mayor of the City of Providence, Angel Taveras, announced that the City was facing a &quot;category 5&quot; hurricane due to its substantial debt. Tavares made budget cuts, including teacher layoffs and paycuts for city employees. The total structural debt inherited by Tavares in 2011 was $180 million.

A report commissioned by the City of Providence found that the Cicilline administration had transferred funds from the Undesignated Surplus (the city&#x27;s cash reserves) without the proper approval of the City Council, had not provided financial information on a timely basis to the independent auditor, the City Council, or the Internal Auditor, and had not provided the City Council with monthly financial statements, or with projections of year-end surpluses or deficits, among other findings. Providence City Council Finance Chairman John Igliozzi accused him of &quot;hiding the scope of the city&#x27;s fiscal woes through &#x27;illusory revenues, borrowing, and other tricks.&#x27;&quot;

Fitch Ratings also downgraded Providence&#x27;s ratings, citing &quot;imprudent budgeting decisions, and failure to implement recurring budget solutions&quot;. Cicilline, who portrayed himself as a reformer looking to restore transparency to City Hall, was criticized by his opponents from the primary and House elections; Democrat Anthony Gemma said that he felt Cicilline had lied his way to federal office, and Republican John Loughlin said, &quot;You just don&#x27;t lie to people in such a transparent way&quot;.

A year later, it was reported that Providence could be on the brink of bankruptcy. Former Mayor Cianci placed much of the blame on Cicilline for Providence&#x27;s problems, saying that although he didn&#x27;t think it was entirely his fault, he did hide it from the public. Experts have said that the only way out for Providence may be to declare bankruptcy.

==U.S. House of Representatives (2011–2023)==

===Elections===
====2010====

On February 13, 2010, Cicilline announced his candidacy for the U.S. House of Representatives, following the retirement of Patrick J. Kennedy. He won the Democratic primary in September with 37% of the vote, defeating businessman Anthony Gemma (23%), State Representative David Segal (20%), and state party chairman Bill Lynch (20%).

In November, he defeated Republican State Representative John Loughlin with 51% of the vote.

====2012====

He ran for re-election in the newly redrawn 1st district, and won. He beat out former Rhode Island State Police Superintendent Brendan Doherty with 53% of the total votes cast.

A February 2012 survey showed Cicilline&#x27;s approval rating had dropped almost 10% in 3 months, with the percentage of those who rated his performance as &quot;excellent or good&quot; dropping by 24%. Anthony Gemma, Cicilline&#x27;s primary opponent, said that the poll clearly showed that “a majority of Rhode Islanders wanted to see Cicilline go.”

In 2011, it was reported that although Rhode Island had experienced a population shift of only 7,200, a new congressional map would put 125,000 Rhode Islanders into new districts, which would help Democrats—and notably Cicilline. Fellow House Democrat Jim Langevin accused Cicilline of trying to use the redistricting to aid with his reelection campaign. Potential Republican contenders suggested that it was an attempt to save Cicilline after his approval numbers had dropped. Cicilline rebuffed the allegations, and asserted that he did not attempt to influence the redistricting.

====2014====

In 2014, Cicilline defeated his Democratic primary opponent, Matthew Fecteau, with 62.98% of the vote. In the general election, he was reelected to a third term, defeating Republican nominee Cormick Lynch with 59% of the vote.

====2016====

Cicilline was reelected to a fourth term, defeating Republican nominee H. Russell Taub with 64% of the vote.

====2018====

Cicilline ran in the primary election against Christopher Young. During the campaign, both Young and Cicilline&#x27;s Republican opponent, Patrick Donovan, criticized Cicilline&#x27;s behavior at the hearing of Peter Strzok. Young said that Cicilline was &quot;screaming like a lunatic&quot;. Donovan said, &quot;What Mr. Cicilline did in the hearing was childish. To be yelling like that is not part of what he’s supposed to be doing representing our interests down in Washington.&quot; Cicilline defeated Young in the primary election with 78% of the vote.

In September, Cicilline stated that if Democrats became the majority party in the House, he would run for assistant Democratic leader. For his work on the Assault Weapons Ban he had introduced to the House, The Newtown Action Alliance endorsed Cicilline in the 2018 election.

Cicilline won the general election, defeating Republican nominee Patrick Donovan with 66.6% of the vote.

====2020====

Cicilline ran unopposed in the 2020 Democratic primary election. In the general election, he received 70.8% of the vote, defeating the two independent candidates, Frederick Wysocki and Jeffery Edward Lemire, who earned 15.8% and 12.6%, respectively.

====2022====

Cicilline again ran unopposed in the 2022 Democratic primary election.

Cicilline won the general election, defeating Republican nominee Allen Waters with 64% of the vote.

===Tenure===

Upon being sworn in, Cicilline became the fourth openly gay member of Congress.

Cicilline has voted with his party 96% of the time. He has been called a &quot;populist-leaning liberal&quot;. Since 2016, he has served as a co-chair of the Policy and Communications Committee. He has been described as a &quot;rising star&quot; in the Democratic Party. The Democratic Caucus elected Cicilline chair of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee after he dropped out of the race to become assistant Democratic leader. As chair of the DPCC, Cicilline will be in charge of the caucus&#x27; messaging strategy.

Cicilline voted for both articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump.

On January 12, 2021, Cicilline was named an impeachment manager (prosecutor) for Trump&#x27;s second impeachment trial.

In October 2021, Portuguese Ambassador to the United States Domingos Teixeira de Abreu Fezas Vital made Cicilline a Grand Officer of the Order of Prince Henry.

Cicilline voted with President Joe Biden&#x27;s stated position 100% of the time, according to &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot; analysis completed in January 2023.

On February 21, 2023, it was announced that Cicilline would resign from Congress on June 1, 2023, to become president and CEO of the Rhode Island Foundation. A special election was scheduled to fill the remainder of his term, with Gabe Amo winning in November 2023.

====Business and telecommunications====
In 2017, Cicilline joined the new Congressional Antitrust Caucus and co-sponsored the Merger Retrospective Act, which would require the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice to do yearly studies on the effects of corporate mergers on the economy. At the time he joined the Antitrust Caucus, he was the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law.

Cicilline has come out publicly in favor of net neutrality, saying that &quot;he will do whatever it takes&quot; to stop the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s proposed plans to end regulation of internet service providers under Title II.

On March 7, 2018, Cicilline introduced the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act to the House. The aim of the bill was to temporarily allow news publishers to band together to negotiate with large online platforms, such as Facebook and Google. In a fact sheet published by Cicilline&#x27;s office, he claimed that a &quot;free and diverse press, particularly local press, is the backbone for a healthy and vibrant democracy&quot;. One of the bill&#x27;s goals was to restore public trust in online media.

In the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica scandal—in which Facebook reportedly gave access to the data of 50 million accounts to Cambridge Analytica—Cicilline sent a letter to the Chairman of the Judicial Committee requesting that he invite Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before the committee. Cicilline said in a statement: “This incident is only Facebook’s latest abuse of public trust and attempt to obscure its role in the rise of information warfare and propaganda online.”

Cicilline and Representative Jeff Fortenberry sent Alphabet Inc. CEO Sundar Pichai a letter following up on a complaint from 20 advocacy groups regarding Google&#x27;s compliance with the Children&#x27;s Online Privacy Protection Act. The letter asked the company to reveal the details of how it collects the data of children.

Cicilline attended the November 2019 meeting of the International Grand Committee on Disinformation and &#x27;Fake News&#x27; in Dublin. The committee was made up of parliamentarians from 10 countries, and sought to enhance global collaboration on the regulation of harmful content, hate speech, and electoral interference.

In July 2020, Cicilline chaired a meeting of the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law, which included Zuckerberg, Pichai, Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook, and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, so that they could testify about their platforms. Cicilline and the other members of the bipartisan committee extensively interrogated and scrutinized the four CEOs, and accused them of anti-competitive practices, with Cicilline insinuating that the various platforms had problems with their competitive practices. When questioning Pichai, Cicilline claimed that Google&#x27;s business model was a problem, and displayed emails from over a decade ago that showed the company had engaged in &quot;a pattern of anti-competitive behavior.&quot; He also argued that the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the urgent need for regulation of these companies, and compared them to past monopolies, such as the railroads and oil tycoons, AT&amp;T, and Microsoft.

====Foreign affairs====
An avid supporter of nonviolence, Cicilline has taken a stance against the U.S. military presence in Libya, voting to limit the use of funds supporting NATO operations in Libya, and to remove armed forces from Libya. In 2013, he went on record as &quot;skeptical&quot; of the Obama administration’s attempts to get congressional approval for military action in Syria.

In March 2018, Cicilline was among a handful of U.S. legislators to receive the Presidential Medal of Gratitude from President Bako Sahakyan of the Republic of Artsakh. According to Public Radio of Armenia, &quot;The Medal of Gratitude is awarded to individuals, organizations, and collectives for significant contributions in restoring and developing the economy, science, culture, and social spheres of the NKR, as well as for defending and promoting international recognition of the Republic.&quot; Cicilline was a part of the bipartisan group of 37 U.S. Representatives to call for a $70 million aid package to Armenia and Artsakh.

On March 23, 2018, Cicilline released a statement voicing his opposition to Trump&#x27;s appointment of John Bolton as National Security Advisor. Cicilline cited Bolton&#x27;s advocacy for preemptive attacks on Iran and North Korea, as well as his support for the Iraq War, when he worked as Ambassador to the United Nations during President George W. Bush’s administration.

In April 2018, Cicilline warned Trump against meeting with Kim Jong-un, saying, “There was a reason that prior presidents had rejected the idea of meeting with a North Korean dictator, his father, and grandfather before him, because it elevates his standing in the international community right away by having the meeting. The notion that it is historic, it is historic, but it may not be historic in a good way.”

In May 2018, Cicilline introduced a bipartisan bill to block the sale of F-35s to NATO ally Turkey. He cited concerns over Turkey&#x27;s increasing aggression against U.S.-backed forces in Iraq and Syria, as well as the Turkey&#x27;s increasingly friendly relationship with Russia.

Cicilline and Representative Adam Kinzinger authored an opinion piece about the UN peacekeeping mission in Liberia. They commended the UN&#x27;s work in Liberia, and cited the mission as one of the UN&#x27;s major peacekeeping successes.

Cicilline accused Turkey of inciting the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. On October 1, 2020, he co-signed a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that condemned Azerbaijan’s offensive operations against Nagorno-Karabakh, denounced Turkey’s role in the conflict, and called for an immediate ceasefire.

====Gun rights====
Cicilline is a strong gun control advocate, and was a founding member of the bipartisan coalition Mayors Against Illegal Guns. In 2010, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence endorsed Cicilline; in 2000, the National Rifle Association of America awarded him an F− lifetime score. Cicilline has also indicated his support for a ban on the sale or transfer of all forms of semi-automatic weapons, for more stringent state restrictions on the purchase and possession of firearms, and for a requirement that manufacturers equip firearms with child-safety locks. On November 16, 2011, he made a public statement against the National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act, which would &quot;require all states to allow out-of-state visitors to carry concealed firearms, as long as the laws of the visitors&#x27; home states allow them to do so.&quot; He insisted that the Second Amendment had nothing to do with this bill, which he argued would infringe upon the right of state governments to protect the safety of their citizens, and would force communities to accept concealed-carry standards set by other states.

In October 2017, after the Las Vegas shooting, Cicilline introduced a bill to ban bump stocks. After the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, he introduced the Assault Weapons Ban Act of 2018. The bill would ban 205 specific firearms, such as the AR-15 and the AK-47, outright. Cicilline was also among the members of Congress who supported the National School Walkout, and met with protesters at the U.S. Capitol.

====Immigration====
Cicilline has repeatedly expressed his view that the U.S. immigration system is &quot;broken&quot; and that the Congress must fix it. In May 2017, he opposed the Davis-Oliver Act, introduced by Representative Raúl Labrador, which would have added 12,500 armed federal immigration officers, penalized sanctuary cities, and stepped up detentions and deportation activities. Cicilline called the bill &quot;President Trump&#x27;s mass deportation act&quot; and said it would make “our communities less safe.”

On March 6, 2018, Cicilline introduced the Advancing Mutual Interests and Growing our Success (AMIGOS) Act, which would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to include Portugal as a country whose citizens would be eligible for entry into the United States as E-1 or E-2 nonimmigrants, provided that Portugal provides similar benefits to U.S. nationals.

====LGBT rights====
In March 2011, Cicilline co-sponsored a bill to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, and supported efforts to legalize same-sex marriage.

In 2015, Cicilline introduced the Equality Act, a bill that would expand the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. In September 2017, he reintroduced the Equality Act. In 2019, Cicilline reintroduced the Equality Act again, the first time it was introduced in a Democratic-controlled House. The bill passed the House on May 17, 2019.

In September 2016, Cicilline asked Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Sarah Saldana what her agency was doing to &quot;enhance&quot; guidelines for LGBT individuals in ICE custody. Saldana answered that ICE officers spoke with LGBT+ undocumented immigrants in order to properly accommodate them while they were in American detention facilities.

In July 2018, Cicilline was a co-sponsor of The Gay and Trans Panic Defense Prohibition Act. This act would prohibit defense lawyers from using a victim’s LGBTQ identity as justification for a crime, or to argue for lesser sentences on the premise that there were extenuating circumstances that motivated their clients to lash out violently. Also that year, Cicilline was one of over 100 Democratic members of Congress to oppose the State Department&#x27;s decision to deny or revoke diplomatic visas to unmarried same-sex partners of foreign diplomats.

==== Abortion ====
Cicilline is pro-choice, and advocates that abortions always be legally available, and that government funding be provided to clinics and medical facilities that provide abortion services. He opposed the Protect Life Act of October 2011, which would ban the use of federal funding to cover any costs under health care plans that paid for abortions, and would allow federally funded hospitals to refuse to perform abortions, even in cases in which the mother&#x27;s life is in danger. Stating that the bill would put women&#x27;s lives at risk and would limit &quot;how women can spend their own private dollars to purchase health insurance&quot;, Cicilline called it &quot;outrageous&quot;.

In February 2011, Cicilline voted against prohibiting the disbursement of federal funds to Planned Parenthood, and, in May 2011, against prohibiting taxpayer funding of abortions. He co-sponsored the Violence Against Women Health Initiative Act of 2011, which sought to &quot;improve the health care system&#x27;s assessment and response to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, and for other purposes.&quot;

====Veterans affairs====
Cicilline has declared his support for veterans&#x27; &quot;access to a range of resources in health care, housing, employment, mental health services, and education&quot;. He has co-sponsored numerous acts in the interest of veterans, including the Veterans Dog Training Therapy Act, which was intended to aid veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder; the Disabled Veterans Tax Termination Act, to permit disabled veterans to receive both retirement pay and disability compensation; and the Veteran Employment Transition Act of 2011, to extend work opportunities to recently discharged veterans.

On November 18, 2011, Cicilline said of the Vow Hire Heroes Act, which was intended to increase job opportunities for veterans: &quot;This vote ensures that Rhode Island veterans, and all of our nation&#x27;s veterans, will receive some of the tools and resources they need to successfully reenter the workforce, and provide for their families and loved ones&quot;.

<text>Léon Charles Albert Calmette ForMemRS (; 12 July 1863 – 29 October 1933) was a French physician, bacteriologist and immunologist, and an important officer of the Pasteur Institute. He co-discovered the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin, an attenuated form of &quot;Mycobacterium bovis&quot; used in the BCG vaccine against tuberculosis. He also developed the first antivenom for snake venom, the Calmette&#x27;s serum.

==Early career==
Calmette was born in Nice, France. He wanted to serve in the Navy and be a physician, so in 1881 he joined the School of Naval Physicians at Brest. He started to serve in 1883 in the Naval Medical Corps in Hong Kong, where he worked with Dr Patrick Manson, who studied the mosquito transmission of the parasitic worm, filaria, the cause of elephantiasis. Calmette completed his medical degree on the subject of filariasis. He was then assigned to Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, where he arrived in 1887. Afterwards, he served in West Africa, in Gabon and French Congo, where he researched malaria, sleeping sickness and pellagra.

==Association with Pasteur==
Upon his return to France in 1890, Calmette met Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) and Emile Roux (1853–1933), who was his professor in a course on bacteriology. He became an associate and was charged by Pasteur to found and direct a branch of the Pasteur Institute at Saigon (French Indochina), in 1891. There, he dedicated himself to the nascent field of toxicology, which had important connections to immunology, and he studied snake and bee venom, plant poisons and curare. He also organized the production of the existing vaccines against smallpox and rabies and carried out research on cholera, and the fermentation of opium and rice.

In 1894, he returned to France and developed the first antivenoms for snake bites using immune sera from vaccinated horses (&quot;Calmette&#x27;s serum&quot;). Work in this field was later taken up by Brazilian physician Vital Brazil, in São Paulo at the Instituto Butantan, who developed several other antivenoms against snakes, scorpions and spiders.

He also took part in the development in the first immune serum against the bubonic plague (black pest), in collaboration with the discoverer of its pathogenic agent, &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot;, by Alexandre Yersin (1863–1943), and went to Portugal to study and to help fight a plague epidemic at Oporto in 1899.

==Institute leadership==
In 1895, Roux entrusted him with the directorship of the Institute&#x27;s branch at Lille (Institut Pasteur de Lille), where he was to remain for the next 25 years. In 1901, he founded the first antituberculosis dispensary at Lille, and named it after Emile Roux. In 1904, he founded the &quot;Ligue du Nord contre la Tuberculose&quot; (Northern Antituberculosis League), which still exists today.

In 1909, he helped to establish the Institute branch in Algiers (Algeria). In 1918, he accepted the post of assistant director of the Institute in Paris; the following year he was made a member of the Académie Nationale de Médecine.

==Research on tuberculosis==

Calmette&#x27;s main scientific work – which was to bring him worldwide fame and permanently attach his name to the history of medicine – was the development of a vaccine against tuberculosis, which, at the time, was a major cause of death. The German microbiologist Robert Koch had discovered, in 1882, that its pathogenic agent was the tubercle bacillus, &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;, and Louis Pasteur became interested in it too. In 1906, a veterinarian and immunologist working at the Institut Pasteur de Lille, Camille Guérin, established that immunity against tuberculosis was associated with the living tubercle bacilli in the blood. Using Pasteur&#x27;s approach, Calmette investigated how immunity would develop in response to attenuated bovine bacilli injected in animals. This preparation received the name of its two discoverers (&quot;Bacillum Calmette-Guérin&quot;, or BCG, for short). Attenuation was achieved by repeatedly cultivating them in a bile-containing substrate, based on a theory of Norwegian researcher Kristian Feyer Andvord (1855–1934). From 1908 to 1921, Guérin and Calmette strived to produce less and less virulent strains of the bacillus, by transferring them to successive cultures. Finally, in 1921, they used BCG to successfully vaccinate newborn infants in the Hôpital de la Charité in Paris.

The vaccination program, however, suffered a serious setback in 1930 when 72 vaccinated children developed tuberculosis in Lübeck, Germany, due to a contamination of some vaccine batches in Germany. Mass vaccination of children was reinstated in many countries after 1932, when new and safer production techniques were implemented. Notwithstanding, Calmette was deeply shaken by the event, dying one year later, in Paris.

==Impact on industrial brewing ==
Calmette helped develop the amylolytic process which was used in industrial brewing.

==Personal life==
He was the brother of Gaston Calmette (1858–1914), the editor of &quot;Le Figaro&quot; who was shot and killed in 1914 by Henriette Caillaux after running a long press campaign against her husband.
Mme Caillaux was acquitted of murder on the grounds that she had committed a crime of passion.

==Legacy==
Today, his name is one of the few remaining French names in the streets of Ho Chi Minh City (others being Yersin, Alexandre de Rhodes, Pasteur).
A bridge completed in 2009 is also named &quot;Calmette&quot; connecting district 1 to district 4, also connected to the exit of the new Thu Thiem tunnel connecting the district 1 to the future residential Thu Thiem area in district 2. In Cambodia, a major hospital was named after him, Calmette Hospital.

<doc id="1330359" wikidata="Q4118734" url="?curid=1330359" title="United Air Lines Flight 610">
<text>On June 30, 1951, United Air Lines Flight 610, a US transcontinental San Francisco–Oakland–Salt Lake City–Denver–Chicago service flown by the Douglas DC-6 aircraft &quot;Mainliner Overland Trail&quot; (registration N37543) crashed in Larimer County, northwest of Denver. All 50 on board (45 passengers and 5 crew) were killed.

== Events leading up to crash ==
After completing its first two segments, Flight 610 departed Salt Lake City at 12:11 a.m. en route to Denver. At around 1:47 a.m, Flight 610 reported to air traffic control that it had passed the Cheyenne radio range station, and requested a lower altitude, which was granted down to 8,500 feet.
At that point, Flight 610 was scheduled to make a right turn to intercept the 168° course line of the DEN low frequency range, and then to proceed to the WONT intersection, its next clearance limit. To intercept that course line, the plane turned to a heading of approximately 210°, which was a proper intercept angle of almost 45°. If the pilot had configured his audio selector switches properly, he would have been able to hear the aural Morse code identifier of &quot;A&quot;, for the north side of that low frequency range. As he neared the course line itself, he would then have begun to hear the &quot;N&quot; identifier, the signal to turn left again, and could track the 168° course line to the WONT intersection.

However, the plane did not turn left, remaining on a 210° intercept heading until impact. At 2:00 a.m. the DC-6 crashed into Crystal Mountain, about 50 miles NNW of Denver. It skidded 690&#x27; to a stop and it burst into flames.

== Nature of error ==
It was thought that the pilot, in a darkened cockpit, might have selected the wrong audio frequency switches. This, instead of giving him the appropriate Denver low frequency radio range signals, gave him the Denver Visual Audio Range (VAR) course signals. Both of those navigation ranges used the same audio morse code identifier of &quot;DEN.&quot; Both of those ranges needed to be received to pinpoint the WONT intersection- the position to which the flight had been cleared by ATC. If the captain had set those switches to incorrect positions, though, so that he was listening to the aural identifiers for the VAR course, he would have heard only the &quot;A&quot; identifier, but not the &quot;N&quot; identifier, which was needed to tell him when it was time to turn left again.

After that investigation, the letter &quot;V&quot; was added to the &quot;DEN&quot; Morse code identifier for the VAR course, to avoid confusion with the DEN low frequency range.

According to the July 1 edition of the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Robert M. Byers, a United Press International reporter, observed the wreckage from a plane and reported that the aircraft had gouged out a path 150&#x27; long by 50&#x27; wide through the heavy timber, about 8,600&#x27; up Crystal Mountain. He also indicated that smoke rose from the gash torn in the trees by the splintering airliner.

<text>is a popular local Japanese festival (matsuri) which takes place annually in Tobata, a ward of Kitakyushu in Fukuoka prefecture, Kyūshū, Japan. It is held for three days (Friday–Sunday) before and after the fourth Saturday of July. The festival is a national cultural asset of Japan, and is centred on the parading of the .

==The Yamagasa==

The Yamagasa (or Yamakasa) are very large floats, and are the focal point of the festival. There are four regions of Tobata which participate: Higashi, Nishi, Tenraiji and Nakabaru. Each region has a large Yamagasa for men and a small one for boys, making eight main floats in total.

During the festival in the daytime, the eight official floats with twelve great flags hoisted on the four large ones are carried for a parade, followed by some small floats for children. But in the nighttime, the floats are completely transformed into pyramids of light—huge Lantern Yamakasa floats, their decorations with the flags removed. Each with twelve layers of 309 lanterns, 10 meters high, and 1.5 tons in weight, is shouldered by about 100 carriers.

To move the Yamagasa is an art which requires concerted lifting by all the carriers. To ensure that they do it successfully, they all shout &quot;yoitosa, yoitosa&quot; together in a rhythmic chant with drums and cymbals.

== History ==

This festival has its origin in 1802, when people plagued by an epidemic in Tobata Village of Chikuzen prayed to Suga-taijin to disperse the plague, their prayers were answered and all of the villagers with the plague were cured. At that time the villagers held the Yamakasa Festival as the celebration event of the answer to their prayers.

At some point, the nighttime races against the clock around a set course were abandoned . However, as of 2017, they take place. Also, a Yamagasa festival for ladies has been started .

<doc id="1330432" wikidata="Q1354109" url="?curid=1330432" title="Mighty Aphrodite">
<text>Mighty Aphrodite is a 1995 American comedy film written, directed by, and co-starring Woody Allen, alongside Mira Sorvino, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Rapaport, and F. Murray Abraham. The screenplay was vaguely inspired by the story of &quot;Pygmalion&quot; and is about Lenny Weinrib&#x27;s (Allen) search for his genius adopted son&#x27;s biological mother, ultimately finding that she is a dim-witted prostitute named Linda Ash (Sorvino).

Critical reception of the film was generally positive, with Sorvino earning high praise for her performance. She won several accolades, including the Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress, and was nominated for the BAFTA Award and SAG Award in the same category. Allen&#x27;s screenplay earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.

==Plot==
At the ruins of an ancient Greek theatre in Taormina, Sicily, a Greek chorus introduces and narrates the story of one Lenny Weinrib. Lenny is a sportswriter in Manhattan, married to the ambitious art curator, Amanda. The couple adopts a baby boy and names him Max. As Lenny spends more time with Max it becomes evident that the child is remarkably gifted. Intrigued, Lenny becomes obsessed with uncovering the identity of Max&#x27;s biological mother.

After an extensive search Lenny discovers that Max&#x27;s biological mother is a prostitute and part-time porn star who goes by various names. She reveals her birth name as Leslie Ash and expresses her preference for being called Linda because it means ‘pretty’ in Spanish. Lenny arranges to meet Linda at her apartment but doesn&#x27;t engage in any intimate activities. Instead he encourages her to leave her current lifestyle behind and pursue a more wholesome life. Linda reacts angrily, returning Lenny&#x27;s money and demanding that he leave.

Undeterred, Lenny remains determined to befriend Linda and improve her circumstances. He successfully helps Linda escape her abusive pimp and then tries to match her up with a boxer named Kevin. Initially they seem like a well-matched couple but their relationship sours when Kevin discovers Linda&#x27;s background.

Meanwhile Lenny and Amanda&#x27;s marriage begins to falter owing to Lenny&#x27;s preoccupation with Linda, Amanda&#x27;s career ambitions and her affair with her colleague Jerry. Amanda eventually confesses to Lenny that she wants to explore her relationship with Jerry. However Lenny and Linda find solace in each other following their respective breakups and end up consummating their relationship. The next day, though, Lenny reconciles with Amanda, realizing that they are still deeply in love.

Linda unsuccessfully tries to win back Kevin. While driving back to Manhattan she witnesses a helicopter landing and offers a lift to the pilot, Don. The Greek chorus reveals that Linda and Don will eventually marry, although Linda is now pregnant with Lenny&#x27;s child. About a year later Linda (with her infant daughter) and Lenny (with Max) meet by chance in a toy store. Unaware of the connection, Linda expresses her gratitude to Lenny for his help and leaves him stunned. In conclusion, the Greek chorus performs a lively song and dance routine.

The soundtrack includes &quot;Neo Minore&quot; performed by Vassilis Tsitsanis, &quot;Horos Tou Sakena&quot; by Stavros Xarchakos, &quot;I&#x27;ve Found a New Baby&quot; by Wilbur de Paris, &quot;Whispering&quot; by Benny Goodman &amp; His Orchestra, &quot;Manhattan&quot; by Carmen Cavallaro, &quot;When Your Lover Has Gone&quot; by Ambrose &amp; His Orchestra, &quot;L&#x27;il Darlin&quot; by Count Basie &amp; His Orchestra, &quot;Take Five&quot; by the Dave Brubeck Quartet, &quot;Penthouse Serenade (When We&#x27;re Alone)&quot; and &quot;I Hadn&#x27;t Anyone Till You&quot; by Erroll Garner, &quot;The &#x27;In&#x27; Crowd&quot; by Ramsey Lewis, and &quot;You Do Something to Me&quot; and &quot;When You&#x27;re Smiling&quot; by the Dick Hyman Chorus &amp; Orchestra. Graciela Daniele choreographed the dance routines.

The Greek chorus includes George de la Peña and Pamela Blair. Tony Sirico and Paul Giamatti make brief appearances in minor roles.

Manhattan locations include Bowling Green, Central Park, and FAO Schwarz. Additional exteriors were filmed in North Tarrytown and Quogue. The Greek chorus scenes were filmed in the Teatro antico in Taormina on the island of Sicily.

Mira Sorvino mentioned in a 2011 interview that she chose Linda&#x27;s voice to be high and gravelly since &quot;high voice kind of makes you sound less intellectually gifted, and the gravelly part just added this kind of rough-and-tumble, been-to-the-school-of-hard-knocks element to it.&quot; Four weeks into the production, Allen spoke with Sorvino asking if she had ever wondered about using a different voice. Sorvino stated that the voice affected how she approached the character, and that if she changed the voice the character changed. When she pointed out that they were four weeks into the movie Allen said, &quot;Oh, that doesn&#x27;t matter. I have it written into my budget that I can reshoot the entire movie if I want.&quot;

In real life Leonard &quot;Lenny&quot; Weinrib was the name of an American actor, voice actor and writer known for playing the title role in the children&#x27;s television show &quot;H.R. Pufnstuf&quot;. He died in 2006.

==Release==
&quot;Mighty Aphrodite&quot; debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival before going into limited release in the United States. It opened on 19 screens and earned $326,494 its opening weekend. It eventually grossed $6,401,297 in the US and $19,598,703 in international markets for a total worldwide box office of $26 million.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 78% based on reviews from 37 critics, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;Mighty Aphrodite&quot; may not stand with Woody Allen&#x27;s finest work, but it&#x27;s brought to vivid life by a thoroughly winsome performance from Mira Sorvino.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 59 out of 100 based on 16 reviews from critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B+&quot; on scale of A+ to F.

In her review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin said, &quot;Even when it becomes unmistakably lightweight, &quot;Mighty Aphrodite&quot; remains witty, agile and handsomely made.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; called the film &quot;a sunny comedy&quot; and added, &quot;The movie&#x27;s closing scene is quietly, sweetly ironic, and the whole movie skirts the pitfalls of cynicism and becomes something the Greeks could never quite manage, a potential tragedy with a happy ending.&quot;

In the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Leah Garchik said the film was &quot;an inventive movie, imaginative and rich in detail&quot; and added, &quot;Woody Allen&#x27;s incredible wit is at the heart of all that&#x27;s wonderful in &quot;Mighty Aphrodite&quot;, and Woody Allen&#x27;s incredible ego is at the core of its major flaw . . . He fails when he attempts . . . to get the audience to suspend its disbelief and accept Allen, a withered Romeo, as a sweet-natured naif. The crotchety charm of the shy and awkward characters he played as a young man has worn off; nowadays, he comes across as just plain crotchety.&quot;

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said, &quot;The film is a showcase for Sorvino, actor Paul&#x27;s Harvard-grad daughter, who gives a sensational performance. She shows startling humor and heart without trading on sentiment.&quot;

In &quot;Variety&quot;, Todd McCarthy described the film as &quot;a zippy, frothy confection that emerges as agreeable middle-range Woody . . . There is perhaps a bit too much of the chorus galavanting about delivering their increasingly colloquial admonitions and too few convulsive laughs, but the writer-director has generally pitched the humor at a pleasing and relatively consistent level . . . The film&#x27;s biggest surprise, and attraction, is Sorvino . . . [who] goes way beyond the whore-with-a-heart-of-gold externals of the part in developing a deeply sympathetic and appealing character. None of the diverse roles she has done to date would have suggested her for this part, but this gutsy performance will put her much more prominently on the map.&quot;

<text>Count Peter Ivanovich Shuvalov (; 1711 – ) was a Russian statesman and Field Marshal who, together with his brother Aleksandr Shuvalov, paved the way for the elevation of the Shuvalov family to the highest offices of the Russian Empire. He is also remembered as the founder of Izhevsk, the capital of Udmurtia.

Pyotr Shuvalov began his career as a page at the court of tsesarevna Elizabeth. He was brought to tsesarevna&#x27;s attention when he married her close friend and in-law, Mavra Shepeleva. For his assistance in the enthronement of Elizabeth, he was promoted to the rank of Chamberlain, then appointed senator and became a count in 1746.

Initially, he was in charge of an army division stationed near St.Petersburg and then the Observation Corps, formed by Shuvalov himself and designated to protect the rear of the regular army. He also held the post of a conference minister and managed the artillery and weapons chancelleries.

Shuvalov improved the Russian artillery and built a few weapons factories. He invented a special canister-shooting gun with an oval bore, called &quot;secret howitzer&quot;, which had a limited success; his more useful addition to Russian artillery were licornes, a kind of gun-howitzers, which remained in service for almost hundred years. He enjoyed unlimited power throughout the reign of Elizabeth due to his wife&#x27;s and cousin Ivan Ivanovich Shuvalov&#x27;s influence on the empress. Almost no single affair of the state was to be taken care of without Shuvalov, especially those pertaining to national economy and military organization. In 1753, Shuvalov presented before the Governing Senate a project for eliminating internal customs offices and outposts and increasing tariffs on imported goods, instead.

Shuvalov is known to have been very selfish at times. He worried excessively about his own interests and, quite often, to the detriment of the state and private parties. For example, Shuvalov obtained for himself an exclusive right to export lumber, lard, blubber oil and monopolized the seal trade. Having led a luxurious lifestyle, Shuvalov left a debt of more than a million rubles to the state treasury.

<text>Souvenirs is the second studio solo album by the American rock singer-songwriter Dan Fogelberg. The album was released in late 1974, on the label Epic Records.

<text>Ladera Ranch is a master-planned community and census-designated place located in south Orange County, California, just outside the city limits of Mission Viejo.

==History==
Ladera Ranch is a planned community, bordered by the cities of Mission Viejo and San Juan Capistrano to the west and the city of Rancho Santa Margarita to the north. Located along Antonio Parkway and Crown Valley Parkway, construction of the community began in 1999 on portions of the O&#x27;Neill, Avery, &amp; Moiso families&#x27; Rancho Mission Viejo cattle ranch, which was the largest remaining working ranch in Orange County.

==Geography==
Ladera Ranch is located in the foothills of the Orange County Saddleback. It is bordered by Rancho Mission Viejo to the south, Las Flores to the north, and the city of Mission Viejo to the west.

===Design and development===
The Ladera Ranch development is divided into nine &quot;villages&quot;. Within each village, individual builders develop an area called a neighborhood. There are ten or more neighborhoods per village. The villages are:
* Oak Knoll Village
* Bridgepark
* Flintridge Village
* Township
* Wycliffe Village
* Echo Ridge Village
* Avendale Villages
* Terramor Village
* Covenant Hills

Four of the nine villages have clubhouses themed on a particular architecture style that is emphasized within that village. There are also parks, pools, playgrounds and open areas within each village. The Covenant Hills village is a gated community which is closed to the general public, but accessible to all card-carrying residents of Ladera Ranch. There are no other gated villages in the community.

In addition to the various clubhouses, the community has a private water park and skate park, 18 community parks, a dog park, six smaller neighborhood pools, many pocket parks and green belts, shopping districts called Mercantile East and Mercantile West Shopping Centers, and miles of hiking/biking trails that connect to Doheny Beach.

=== Community organizations ===
The Ladera Ranch Maintenance Corporation (LARMAC) is the homeowners association formed to manage, maintain, and govern the LARMAC Property. LARMAC enforces its Governing Documents and imposes architectural control in the community. Each homeowner in the community is a Member of LARMAC. The LARMAC board of directors oversees its operations. Day-to-day activities are performed by the general manager and supervised by the LARMAC Board. Two essential committees assist the board of directors in overseeing its operations; the Aesthetic Review Committee, which has jurisdiction over design, development, aesthetics and the character of the community, and the Covenant Committee, which enforces the use restrictions of the community in accordance with the Governing Documents.

Ladera Ranch Community Services (LARCS) is an independent non-profit public benefit corporation (Community Services Organization) led by an elected five member board of directors. LARCS primary purpose is to enhance the lifestyle for the residents of Ladera Ranch through community and neighborhood events, recreational programs, resident led clubs and community groups, coordination of volunteer opportunities and resident communication which includes the management of the community website, resident communication which includes the management of the community website, LaderaLife.com, and the production of the quarterly news magazine, Roots &amp; Wings.

The Ladera Ranch Civic Council (LRCC) is a volunteer group that advises the Orange County Board of Supervisors. The council has no official municipal role or legal authority. The seven-member Civic Council board of directors focuses on topics within Ladera Ranch that are traditionally associated with a municipal body, such as planning and land use, public safety, and infrastructure.

Ladera-Rancho Chamber of Commerce is currently working in partnership with LARCS to promote business awareness within the community through community events.

The community sponsors the annual Fourth of July Celebration, a Summer Concert series, Family Campout, movie night in the park, Spring and Fall Festivals, National Night Out, Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony and Santa visit, and a Bark, Biscuits, and Brew event, as well as partnership events with local charities and vendors.

The community also has a Teen Leadership Council which is composed of 25 youth between 7th and 12th Grades who assist with programming and activities for community youth.

The community is served by the Capistrano Unified School District. A branch of the Orange County Public Library is also located on the campus of Ladera Ranch School.

Within the community are the Chaparral and Oso Grande Elementary Schools and the Ladera Ranch School, which is home to both an elementary school and a middle school on the same campus.

Chaparral Elementary School received the &quot;California Distinguished School Award&quot; in both 2004 and 2008. Ladera Ranch School opened in 2003, and the Middle School received the &quot;California Distinguished School Award&quot; in 2007 and has been nominated again in 2011.

Depending on which part of the community they live in, high school students attend either San Juan Hills High School in San Juan Capistrano or Tesoro High School in Las Flores. Prior to its opening in 2007, students in areas currently served by San Juan Hills attended Capistrano Valley High School. A number of Ladera Ranch&#x27;s students have attended Capistrano Valley, either due to having begun attendance prior to 2007, or by virtue of having been &quot;grandfathered&quot; in through siblings&#x27; attendance.

<text>United Air Lines Flight 615 was a US transcontinental east–west airline service from Boston to Hartford, Cleveland, Chicago, Oakland and San Francisco. On August 24, 1951, the Douglas DC-6 with registration operating the service, crashed on approach to Oakland, causing the death of all 44 passengers and 6 crew members on board.

The flight departed Chicago at 10:59 p.m. CST en route to Oakland. At around 4:16 a.m., the plane was approaching Oakland. At this time, the pilot, Marion W. Hedden of Los Altos, had talked with the control tower of the Civil Aeronautics Administration at the airport preparing for his landing, and had mentioned no trouble. At 4:25 a.m. Flight 615 was cleared for the straight-in approach into Oakland.

This approach clearance was the last radio transmission with the flight. The plane crashed into mountainous terrain southeast of Oakland, careening into Tolman Peak and over its knoll, scattering on the downslope and into Dry Gulch Canyon below in a fiery explosion. All 50 persons on board perished.

After an investigation, it was determined that the pilot ignored the prescribed instrument landing procedures. The pilot instead relied on visual reference, using the copilot&#x27;s automatic direction finder (ADF). The ADF threw the plane off course and below the prescribed altitude of .

<text>Pope Donus II is a non-existent pope who was at one time shown in the Annuario Pontificio. He was mistakenly inserted after Pope Benedict VI.

<doc id="1330468" wikidata="Q593278" url="?curid=1330468" title="Captured Angel">
<text>Captured Angel is the third album by American singer-songwriter Dan Fogelberg, released in 1975. He promoted the album with a tour in support of Eagles.

The album peaked at No. 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It has sold more than a million copies. The album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on November 1, 1977.

==Production==
The album was produced by Fogelberg. He alone recorded all of the instrumental parts before being convinced by his label to allow for a few re-recordings and contributions by other musicians. The majority of the album was recorded at a studio in South Pekin, Illinois; Fogelberg had returned home to care for his ill father.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Stereo Review&quot; praised Fogelberg&#x27;s musicianship, but wrote that as a singer &quot;he sounds raw, unsure, and at times even amateurish, particularly when any emotionality is involved.&quot;

&quot;Cashbox Magazine&quot; wrote that Fogelberg &quot;has got a set of pipes that are a natural in the area of laidback&quot; and that it is this &quot;singing prowess that pervades the smooth flow of &quot;Captured Angel&quot; as the ease of his interpretation serves only to enhance the laidback of the situation&quot;. They singled out &quot;Old Tennessee&quot;, &quot;The Last Nail&quot; and &quot;Next Time&quot; as their top listens.

<doc id="1330470" wikidata="Q7510006" url="?curid=1330470" title="Siege of Fort Erie">
<text>The siege of Fort Erie, also known as the Battle of Erie, from 4 August to 21 September 1814, was one of the last engagements of the War of 1812, between British and American forces. It took place during the Niagara campaign, and the Americans successfully defended Fort Erie against a British army. During the siege, the British suffered high casualties in a failed storming attempt; they also suffered casualties from sickness and exposure in their rough encampments. Unaware that the British were about to abandon the siege, the American garrison launched a sortie to destroy the British siege batteries, during which both sides again suffered high losses.

After the British abandoned the siege, the reinforced American army followed up cautiously and forced a second retreat at Cook&#x27;s Mills but, with the onset of winter and shortage of supplies, they withdrew. They demolished Fort Erie before leaving the area. The attempted siege ended one of the last British offensives along the northern border, the other being the failed British assault on Plattsburgh.

==Background==
The Americans under Major General Jacob Brown had crossed the Niagara River and captured Fort Erie on 3 July 1814. After defeating a British force at the Battle of Chippawa, they advanced north but the British reinforced their troops in the Niagara peninsula. On 25 July, the bloody but indecisive Battle of Lundy&#x27;s Lane was fought, during which Brown was severely wounded.

Following the battle, the outnumbered American troops, now under the command of Brigadier General Eleazer Wheelock Ripley, withdrew to Fort Erie. Ripley advocated abandoning the fort and retreating across the Niagara, but Brown overruled him and summoned Brigadier General Edmund P. Gaines from Sackets Harbor to assume command.

The British, under the command of Lieutenant General Gordon Drummond (the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada), had suffered high casualties at Lundy&#x27;s Lane. Drummond nevertheless claimed that the Americans had been forced to retreat in disorder, and he intended to drive them from the Canadian side of the Niagara. His troops followed the Americans slowly and reached the fort on 4 August. Drummond&#x27;s division numbered 3,000, but Drummond complained about the quality of the troops and the degree to which the units were composed of mixed detachments and companies. His slow advance gave the Americans vitally needed time to reorganise and to reinforce their defences.

===Defences===
The original British fort consisted of two two-story barrack buildings, with fortified cannon bastions connected to them. The barracks were connected by a thick stone curtain with the main gate located in the centre. The rear of the fort (facing away from Lake Erie) consisted of an open terreplein, raised above the base of the dry ditch which surrounded the fort, with two redoubts located on the corner. The redoubts were incomplete and offered little protection. The front of the fort was protected by a large earth wall with a forward gun emplacement. The fort was also divided in half by an earth wall and ditch, but this too was incomplete. At least a third of the rear defenses were makeshift wooden walls or earthworks, some of which were only high. A gun emplacement was located in the centre redan (raised platform). The fort contained a total of six guns.

The dry ditch surrounding the fort had a high wooden wall in the centre. This wall was angled outwards and was sharpened to prevent any enemy from leaping into the ditch, which also had sharpened sticks placed up and down the walls to help impale or wound enemy soldiers. The ditch was used as a garbage dump and a sewer by the defenders, creating a slippery and smelly swamp at the base that would slow enemy attacks and likely cause disease in any wounds.

Since capturing the fort, the Americans had made significant improvements to its defenses under Brown&#x27;s direction and now redoubled their efforts to entrench themselves. Since the fort was too small to hold the entire American force, they extended the earth wall to the south for an additional to a rise made of sand, known as Snake Hill, where they constructed a gun battery. To protect the north end of the position, the Americans threw up an earth wall connecting the northeast bastion of the fort to the lake. On the shore was another fortified gun emplacement, known as the Douglass Battery from its commander, Lieutenant David Douglass of the U.S. Corps of Engineers. Abatis (obstacles made of felled trees) were placed in front of the earth walls.

By the close of the siege, the Americans had also built three log blockhouses in the rear of the fort and had strengthened the defences and redoubts.

==Preliminaries==

===Raid on Black Rock and Buffalo===
When the British force reached Fort Erie, Drummond&#x27;s first sent a force on 3 August across the Niagara in batteaux to raid Buffalo and Black Rock. He hoped to capture or destroy American supplies and provisions. The force consisted of two columns: one made up of the two flank companies and four of the centre companies of the 41st Foot under Lieutenant Colonel Evans of the 41st. The other was composed of the light companies of the 2nd Battalion, the 89th Foot and the 100th Foot, and the flank companies of the 104th (New Brunswick) Regiment of Foot, under Lieutenant Colonel William Drummond of Kelty, General Drummond&#x27;s nephew. With some artillerymen, the force numbered 600 men in total. The force was under the overall command of Lieutenant Colonel John Tucker, the senior Lieutenant Colonel of the 41st Foot.

The raid was a failure. On landing on the American side of the Niagara, Tucker found that the bridge over Conjocta Creek (now known as Scajaquada Creek) had been destroyed. The creek could not be forded, and an American detachment of 240 men of the 1st U.S. Rifle Regiment under Major Lodowick Morgan, with some volunteers, were defending the creek to prevent the bridge being repaired. The British casualties were 11 killed, 17 wounded, and 5 missing. The Americans took 6 prisoners, indicating that one of the British soldiers who had been recorded as &quot;killed&quot; had been captured. Tucker complained that the troops panicked and fled, though they subsequently rallied. The Americans lost 2 killed and 8 wounded. Major Morgan was killed a few days later in a clash between outposts.

===Preparations for the siege===
Drummond lost several vital subordinates during the next few days, forcing him to take personal charge of the siege. Major General Phineas Riall, the commander of the &quot;Right Division&quot; on the Niagara Peninsula, had been wounded and captured at Lundy&#x27;s Lane. His replacement, Major General Henry Conran, recently arrived from England, broke a leg in a fall from a horse and was incapacitated. Colonel Stewart of the Royal Scots was summoned from York to replace him, but fell ill with ague. Colonel Hercules Scott of the 103rd Foot requested permission to relinquish his command of a brigade and revert to command of his regiment.

===Capture of &quot;Ohio&quot; and &quot;Somers&quot;===
While the British constructed their siege lines and batteries, three American schooners anchored in the Niagara River harassed them with gunfire. At the time, three small craft from the British naval squadron on Lake Ontario were blockaded in the mouth of the Niagara River by three larger American vessels. Commander Alexander Dobbs, in command of the British vessels, and his sailors and Royal Marines dragged a gig and five other boats overland from below Niagara Falls and launched a boarding attack on the American schooners off Fort Erie on the night of 12 August. The crews of the schooners spotted and challenged them, but the British replied &quot;Provision boats&quot;, and deceived the Americans long enough to bring their boats alongside. They captured and . The crew of escaped by cutting their anchor cables before slipping away, but were accidentally fired upon by US artillery on the shore. The British lost 2 killed and 4 wounded in the engagement, while the Americans had 1 killed and 70 captured, of whom 8 were wounded. This victory raised British morale but Drummond mistakenly believed that it depressed American morale to the same extent. Some American deserters reported this, as well as saying that the defenders numbered only 1,500, when there were 2,200 troops.

==British assault==
On 13 August, Drummond opened fire on the fort with two light 24-pounder field guns and four 18-pounder or 24-pounder naval guns. Because the bombardment was fired from too long a range, it was ineffective against the fort&#x27;s walls. Drummond launched a three-pronged attack on the night of 15/16 August, with each arm of the attack aimed at one of the American batteries. The largest column, of 1,300 soldiers led by Lieutenant Colonel Victor Fischer would outflank the south end of the defenses at Snake Hill. Another column of 700 soldiers under Colonel Hercules Scott would attack the Douglass Battery and the north end of the defenses, and sweep into the U.S. camp, meeting Fischer&#x27;s column in the middle. Finally, a column of 360 soldiers, sailors and marines led by Lieutenant Colonel William Drummond would attack the fort once the other assaults were under way, with the objective of capturing the old British barrack buildings. A reserve of nearly 700 men (the 1st Battalion of the Royal Scots, the Glengarry Light Infantry, the Incorporated Militia of Upper Canada and those soldiers from the Regiment de Watteville who had not volunteered to take part in Fischer&#x27;s attack on the Snake Hill battery) was left in the siege lines under Lieutenant Colonel Tucker.

Colonel Scott and Lieutenant Colonel Drummond were both experienced soldiers and had little confidence in General Drummond&#x27;s plan. Both men arranged their affairs before heading into battle, sending their papers home to their wives. Drummond gave away his sword (a gift from Lloyd&#x27;s of London) to Surgeon William &quot;Tiger&quot; Dunlop of the 89th. Shortly before moving out, both men wished each other luck and bade farewell.

The columns moved out after dark, but the garrison at the fort had seen their preparations. Surprise would be nearly impossible to achieve. While Fischer&#x27;s column made its long march to the south of Snake Hill, Scott&#x27;s and Drummond&#x27;s columns waited in the pouring rain in a ravine a few hundred yards north of the fort. An hour before the assault began, the British bombardment of the fort ceased, having inflicted casualties on the garrison of 10 killed and 35 wounded.

===American preparations===
In the fort, General Gaines ordered his men to stand to. This produced rumblings from the troops forced to stand in their positions in heavy rain but would prove invaluable in the coming battle. He also ordered that the charges in all guns were to be drawn and replaced, ensuring the guns would not misfire through damp powder.

Brigadier General Ripley defended Snake Hill with the 21st and 23rd U.S. Infantry. The Hill was topped with a large gun emplacement containing six guns under the command of Captain Nathaniel Towson. The fort itself was defended by two companies of the 19th U.S. Infantry, and three guns under Captains Williams and Gookin. The wall between the fort and the Douglass Battery (which held one gun) was manned by the 9th U.S. Infantry, a company of volunteers from the New York and Pennsylvania state militias, the dismounted New York Volunteer Dragoons, and another gun.

The long wall between the fort and the Snake Hill, which was not attacked, was defended by Brigadier General Peter B. Porter with detachments of the 1st and 4th U.S. Rifle Regiments, the 5th Pennsylvania Volunteers, Swift&#x27;s Regiment of Detached New York Militia, and five guns. Finally, two companies of the 11th and 22nd U.S. Infantry and a detachment of the U.S. Light Dragoons were in reserve.

===Fischer&#x27;s attack===
Fischer&#x27;s column consisted of the light companies of the 2/89th Foot and the 100th Foot, the remnants of the 1st Battalion, 8th (King&#x27;s) Foot, which had suffered heavy casualties in earlier engagements, and volunteers from Fischer&#x27;s own regiment, the Regiment de Watteville. De Watteville&#x27;s nominally Swiss regiment was made up of men from all over Europe, many of them former prisoners of war or deserters from the armies of Napoleon Bonaparte, and the British commanders suspected their loyalty. On the approach march, the roll was called every hour to prevent desertion. Except for a few steady men, the entire column was ordered to remove their firearms&#x27; flints and take the enemy battery on the hill with the bayonet.

The column encountered an American picket from the defenses. Surprise was nearly achieved but because of the rainy weather, the British troops&#x27; advance was betrayed by the loud swishing sound made as they passed through high grass. The picket opened fire, alerting the garrison, before hastily retreating. The leading attackers rushed forward to the abatis. As they reached it, Towson opened fire. The rate of fire from his battery would earn it the nickname &quot;Towson&#x27;s Lighthouse&quot;. After several attempts to storm the battery, many attackers broke and fled in panic, sweeping away the steady soldiers to their rear. Those who did try to scale the defenses found that many of the siege ladders built for the attack had been made without taking the ditches into account and were as much as too short to get over the wall. The light company of De Watteville&#x27;s Regiment attempted to bypass the defenses by swimming in the Niagara River. The current proved to be too swift, and many of the men were swept away to their death; those who survived were quickly captured.

Some of the attackers charged the battery five times before retiring. Some units, such as the light company of the 8th, lost two thirds of their strength. De Watteville&#x27;s regiment had 144 casualties (although many were &quot;missing&quot; and actually hid in the woods before deserting the next morning). Ripley, commanding this section of the American defenses, reported taking 147 prisoners. His men suffered only a dozen casualties. Fischer&#x27;s column reeled back in confusion and it was decided another attempt was impossible.

===Scott&#x27;s attack===
Colonel Hercules Scott&#x27;s column consisted of his own 103rd Regiment, less its light company. He launched his attack as soon as firing was heard from Snake Hill. Surprise was quickly lost when American pickets detected them and fired muskets to alert the defenders. Once the British had moved close enough, the guns of the fort and the Douglass Battery (loaded with canister) and several hundred U.S. Infantry opened fire, causing horrific losses to the British who were jammed into a narrow front between an embankment and the lake. Colonel Scott was mortally wounded by a musket ball in the head early in the attack. His second in command, Major William Smelt, was also seriously wounded. At one point in the battle, a cry rose from the British forces of &quot;Stop firing, you&#x27;re shooting your own men!&quot;, and the fighting ceased for almost an entire minute until an American officer, unconvinced by the unfamiliarly accented appeal, shouted back &quot;To Hell with you!&quot; and the firing resumed. Scott&#x27;s shattered regiment fell back with 360 casualties (although some may later have joined Drummond&#x27;s attack against the fort). The Americans facing them reported no casualties from Scott&#x27;s attack.

===William Drummond&#x27;s attack===
Lieutenant Colonel William Drummond&#x27;s column consisted of a small detachment of gunners of the Royal Artillery, the flank companies of the 41st Foot and of the 104th Foot, fifty Royal Marines and ninety seamen of the Royal Navy under Commander Dobbs. The attack on the fort initially made little headway. Using the cover of darkness and the heavy smoke that hung over the field, Drummond then moved his men through the defensive ditch to assault the northeast bastion. The British caught the U.S. artillerymen there completely by surprise, and they quickly abandoned their guns and fled. Those under Captain John Williams and Lieutenant Patrick McDonogh who stood and fought were quickly killed as Drummond cried out &quot;Give no Quarter to the Damn Yankees!&quot; A group of soldiers from the 19th US Infantry (recruits from Ohio who had arrived late the previous evening under Major William Trimble) reorganized themselves in the parade square and poured fire into the bastion. It is believed that Drummond was killed in this barrage. According to one American soldier, in the thick of the fighting he saw a &quot;Red-coated demon, armed with a pike and screaming for his own death which we quickly obliged him to. He fell not far from our feet, no less than a musket&#x27;s length away&quot;.

The attackers twice charged through a gap wide between the two barrack buildings into the parade ground, but were unable to break into the barrack buildings and mess hall. The defenders in turn tried to recapture the northeast bastion but were driven back. General Drummond sent only two companies of the 1st Battalion of the Royal Scots to reinforce the attackers; they lost half their men and very few of them even reached the fort. After fighting swayed back and forth for nearly an hour, some Americans turned around an 18-pounder cannon on the rear redan and began to fire into the bastion less than away. The British responded by turning one of the captured cannons around and knocking the American 18-pounder off its carriage.

Shortly after the British began firing their captured gun, a large powder magazine in the bastion beneath their feet ignited. The explosion was immense, destroying the entire bastion and most of the attached barracks building. A two-ton cannon was thrown out of the fort. Between 150 and 250 men, mainly British and Canadians, were killed in the bastion. It was gruesomely reported that some attackers were blown from the walls of the fort to land on the bayonets of those still in the ditch. The explosion caused havoc for both sides, although the Americans in the fort were sheltered from the full force of the explosion by the barrack buildings. Lieutenant Douglass was nearly killed when a large piece of flaming timber crushed the man next to him. The surviving attackers were convinced that the entire fort was mined and they retreated in panic. Drummond&#x27;s column had been almost wiped out during the attack. When the 104th assembled the next day and roll was called, those who were still standing openly wept at the loss of over half of their men who had attacked.

Sergeant Richard Smith of the 104th was recommended for a commission for his gallantry in the assault, during which he was wounded five times and subsequently had to have his right arm amputated, but the commission was never awarded.

===Aftermath===
In total the British suffered 57 killed, 309 wounded and 537 missing (many of whom were killed in the explosion of the fort&#x27;s magazine). The journal of surgeon William Dunlop described working on the wounded for nearly 3 days without ceasing. The Americans reported capturing 360 prisoners, 174 of whom were wounded. General Gaines reported that 222 dead British troops were left in and around the fort. This would give a revised British loss of 222 killed, 309 wounded, 360 captured (of whom 174 were wounded) and 12 missing.

The garrison suffered 17 killed, 56 wounded and 11 missing.

==American sorties==
In addition to the heavy casualties from the assault, Lieutenant General Drummond&#x27;s force suffered severely from sickness and exposure. The British troops lacked tents and their crude huts and shelters made from bark and branches provided little cover. When the autumn rains began, the ground rapidly became inches deep in water. Drummond nevertheless was reinforced by the 6th and 82nd Regiments of Foot, both of them veterans of the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s army in the Peninsular War, and maintained the siege. Major General Louis de Watteville also joined him to take over the day-to-day conduct of the siege.

On 29 August a chance British shot severely wounded General Gaines and Brigadier General Ripley resumed command. Ripley&#x27;s opinion of the entire campaign was far from positive and he had even openly rumoured that the British would bring up further reinforcements and capture the fort. Major General Jacob Brown had only partly recovered from his wounds received at Lundy&#x27;s Lane, but he nevertheless returned to Fort Erie to replace the pessimistic Ripley in command. It was known that Drummond&#x27;s force was dwindling and there were strong arguments for simply waiting for Drummond to abandon the unsuccessful siege, but Brown was determined to attack.

===Action of 4 September===
On 4 September, a detachment of Brigadier General Peter B. Porter&#x27;s brigade of volunteers from the New York and Pennsylvania Militia was sent out to attack the British Battery No. 2. The action lasted for close to six hours before being brought to a halt by a &quot;tremendous rain and thunder storm&quot;. During the action, Colonel Joseph Willcocks of the Canadian Volunteers (a small unit of Canadians fighting against Britain) was shot in the chest and killed.

===Action of 17 September===
On 15 September, the British finally completed Battery No. 3 at the western end of their siege lines, which enfiladed most of the American defences. Brown planned to outflank the western end of Drummond&#x27;s siege lines, capture the batteries and spike the guns in them. Brigadier General Porter was entrusted with the main attack. His pioneers cleared a trail through the woods to a point behind the British Battery No. 3. Drummond&#x27;s troops and Natives, who were probably made lethargic by rain, sickness and shortage of rations, failed to report any of this activity. Although the British had constructed a blockhouse to cover the end of the entrenchments, the surrounding woods had not been cut back.

At noon on 17 September, Porter&#x27;s force of volunteers from the militia with the 23rd U.S. Infantry, numbering 1,600 in total, moved along the trail, covered by heavy rain. They completely surprised the remnants of De Watteville&#x27;s regiment, who were covering the end of the British siege works, and captured Battery No. 3. At the same moment, the recently promoted Brigadier General James Miller led detachments from the 9th, 11th and 19th U.S. Infantry along the ravine which had sheltered the British troops before their failed assault on August 15, and attacked the British centre. Attacked from both front and flank, Battery No. 2 was also captured.

By now, Drummond&#x27;s reserves were hurrying forward. Lieutenant Colonel Campbell was sent with the 82nd Regiment and part of the 6th Regiment to recapture Battery No. 2, while Lieutenant Colonel John Gordon was dispatched with the 1st Battalion of the Royal Scots and the 2/89th to recover Battery No. 3. There was severe fighting amid the British entrenchments but the Americans were unable to capture Battery No. 1 and were driven out of No. 2 and No. 3. Brown ordered his men back to the fort and sent Ripley forward to cover Porter&#x27;s and Miller&#x27;s withdrawal. Surgeon Dunlop recorded a horrifying incident during the recapture of Battery No. 2, when Major Pattison led two companies of the 82nd Regiment into the battery:
They poured a volley into the mass of the enemy, who were huddled together into so small a space that they could not return it. Pattison immediately sprung forward, and called out to the American officer in command to surrender, as resistance would only cause loss of life and could do no good. He did give an order to ground arms, and some of his men were in the act of doing so, when an American soldier raised his rifle and shot Pattison through the heart. In one moment a charge was made by the 82d into the battery, and every soul in it was put to the bayonet…&quot;.

Three of Drummond&#x27;s six siege guns were destroyed in Battery No. 3. The Americans had been unable to spike the guns in Battery No. 2 before they were driven out.

In this two-hour engagement, the Americans suffered 79 killed, 216 wounded and 216 missing. Porter, Miller and Ripley were all wounded. Of the 216 Americans who were marked down as &quot;missing&quot; in the official casualty return, 170 were captured, of whom some were wounded. The remaining 46 may have died in the massacre at Battery No. 2, since no Americans in the battery survived to report their comrades&#x27; fate.

The British official casualty return stated 115 killed, 178 wounded and 316 missing. The Americans took 382 prisoners (11 officers and 371 enlisted men), indicating that 66 of the British troops marked down as &quot;killed&quot; in the official casualty report were in fact captured. The thickly wooded nature of the battlefield may have led the compilers of the casualty return to assume that these men were lying dead among the trees and undergrowth. This gives a revised British loss of 49 killed, 178 wounded and 382 captured. Of the 11 officers who were taken prisoner, 2 were wounded.

===End of the siege===
Unknown to the Americans, Drummond had already decided on 16 September to lift the siege, and had given orders for his artillery to be moved to Fort George as soon as possible. Shortage of draught animals had delayed his departure. It was not until the night of 21 September that the British force finally withdrew to the Chippawa River. In a letter to Sir George Prevost, the British commander-in-chief in North America, Drummond cited the continual heavy rain, illness among his men and lack of camp equipment as his reasons for breaking off the siege. His force was reduced to 2,000 effectives and his camp had the appearance of &quot;a lake in the midst of a thick wood&quot;.

In the general siege operations from 1 August to 21 September (not including the engagement at Conjocta Creek on 3 August, the capture of the &quot;Ohio&quot; and the &quot;Somers&quot; on 12 August, the cannonade from 13 August to the early morning of 15 August, the assault on 15 August or the sortie of 17 September), the American garrison lost 104 killed and 250 wounded. All but 29 of these casualties came from the regular U.S. Army. The number of Americans captured or missing during this period is unknown. The overall British casualty figures for the siege also appear to be unknown.

==Evacuation==
In early September, Major General George Izard&#x27;s division had been ordered to march from Plattsburgh to Sackett&#x27;s Harbor, where they arrived on 17 September. On 21 September, the American naval squadron on Lake Ontario under Commodore Isaac Chauncey ferried the main part of the division to the Genesee River a few miles west of the Niagara, from where they marched to reinforce Brown. Since Izard was the senior officer, he assumed command of the combined American force. The Americans now numbered 6,300 (including 800 volunteers from the militia) and had a clear advantage in numbers over Drummond, who had only 2,500 men even after further British reinforcements (the 97th Regiment) had arrived. Brown wished to make an immediate all-out attack. Izard instead waited until 13 October before he began a cautious advance, by which time the British had recovered much of their health and morale, and had strongly fortified the line of the Chippawa Creek. After some indecisive exchanges of artillery fire at the mouth of the river and a minor success against a British outpost at Cook&#x27;s Mill on 19 October, Izard withdrew.

On 15 October, the British had launched the first-rate ship of the line on Lake Ontario, and Chauncey&#x27;s squadron promptly withdrew into Sackett&#x27;s Harbor. It was no longer possible for the Americans to move supplies to the Niagara front, except by crude roads which would be unusable during the late autumn and winter. At the same time, the British were able to reinforce and resupply their troops on the Niagara. Izard wrote to the Secretary of War (James Monroe) &quot;At the head of the most efficient army the United States have possessed during this war, much must be expected of me; and yet I can discern no object which can be achieved at this point worthy of the risk which will attend its attempt.&quot;

At Brown&#x27;s request, he and his division were transferred to Sackett&#x27;s Harbor to protect the vital naval base. (The British contemplated making an attack there, but could not transport the necessary troops up the St. Lawrence before winter set in.) Izard, who was short of supplies, decided to abandon Fort Erie and go into winter quarters in New York state with the remainder of the army. On 5 November, the Americans set mines and demolished the fort before retiring across the river. This allowed the British to go into winter quarters also, which spared them losses from the winter weather. Izard himself asked for sick leave and tendered his resignation, which was refused. Many officers (including Brown) accused Izard of cowardice, and he was nearly court martialled as a result, but because of his military expertise and excellent service record, he was moved to a civil position and was eventually made Governor of Arkansas.

When the British returned to the site of Fort Erie, they chose not to rebuild the fort due to lack of funds and merely constructed makeshift quarters until they completely abandoned the fort in 1821 and demolished it from 1823 onwards.

On several occasions, especially after his own failed assault on Fort Erie, General Drummond blamed his troops for lack of spirit or misbehaviour in action, but most historians consider that Drummond himself planned poorly and took insufficient care to maintain his troops&#x27; health and morale.

==Legacy==
Nine active regular infantry battalions of the United States Army (1-2 Inf, 2-2 Inf, 1-3 Inf, 2-3 Inf, 4-3 Inf, 1-5 Inf, 2-5 Inf, 1-6 Inf and 2-6 Inf) perpetuate the lineages of American units (the old 1st, 9th, 11th, 19th, 21st, 22nd, 23rd and 25th Infantry Regiments) that were present during the siege.

Eight line regiments of the British Army, the 6th, 8th (Kings), 41st, 82nd, 89th, 100th, 103rd and 104th (New Brunswick) Regiments of Foot, were awarded the &quot;Niagara&quot; Battle Honour, to commemorate service on the Niagara peninsula during the summer of 1814. The modern descendant units of the 6th, 8th (Kings), 41st, 82nd and 89th regiments within the British Army are, respectively: The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, the Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment (also the successor regiment to the 82nd Regiment), the Royal Welsh Regiment, and the Royal Irish Regiment. Within the Canadian Army, the Royal New Brunswick Regiment officially commemorates the 104th (New Brunswick) Regiment of Foot and also carries the &quot;Niagara&quot; Battle Honour.

The &quot;Niagara&quot; Battle Honour was also awarded to the Glengarry Light Infantry Fencibles, a unit of the British Army recruited in Upper Canada, and to the Battalion of Incorporated Militia of Upper Canada. Within the modern Canadian army, these units are commemorated and perpetuated, in the case of the Glengarry Fencibles, by the Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry Highlanders and, in the case of the Incorporated Militia Battalion, by four Ontario-based regiments: The Lincoln and Welland Regiment, the Queen&#x27;s York Rangers, the Brockville Rifles and the Princess of Wales Own Regiment.

<text>The A6182 is a dual carriageway in Doncaster that runs west and north from the former Doncaster Sheffield Airport to junction 3 of the M18 and then on to Hyde Park, an inner suburb of Doncaster.

The road is named &quot;White Rose Way&quot; north of the M18, and &quot;Great Yorkshire Way&quot; south of the M18.

The road&#x27;s purpose is to link the city centre with the M18, from which drivers can reach the A1 and M1, and the now-closed Doncaster Sheffield Airport.

==21st century extensions==
The upgrade of the part of the road from Lakeside Village Outlet to the M18 to dual carriageway was completed in June 2013.

===Great Yorkshire Way===

The Great Yorkshire Way (formerly Finningley and Rossington Regeneration Route Scheme (FARRRS)) is a new road scheme running between the M18 at Junction 3 and Doncaster Sheffield Airport, improving access primarily to the airport, Rossington and the new Doncaster iPort. Work started in 2013 and the first phase of the road between M18 junction 3 and the A638 road became operational in February 2016. Work on the second and final phase connecting the A638 and the airport began in June 2017 and was completed in June 2018.

==Industrial estates==
Due to the nature of the road, a large number of industrial estates line the A6182, as well as the Lakeside Village and the main Royal Mail sorting office for Doncaster and most of East Yorkshire. British Telecom, Royal Bank of Scotland, Tesco Insurance and Direct Line possess large call centres situated just off the road. There is a new iPort near Rossington.

<doc id="1330488" wikidata="Q7498050" url="?curid=1330488" title="Shippan Point">
<text>Shippan Point (or Shippan) is the southernmost neighborhood in Stamford, Connecticut, United States, located on a peninsula in Long Island Sound. Street names such as Ocean Drive West and Lighthouse Way reflect the neighborhood&#x27;s shoreline location. It is one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the city, with about 1100 homes (including condominiums).

Many of the community&#x27;s large homes overlook the water and have private beaches. Bordering Shippan Point to the northeast is the Shippan neighborhood of Stamford, and farther east the East Side neighborhood. To the west of Shippan Point, separated from it by a canal, is the South End neighborhood, which is currently in planning phases for a major redevelopment.

Running down the middle of the peninsula, Shippan Avenue is the main road of the community. Several of the cross streets end in private beaches owned by neighborhood associations.

Some local historians say &quot;Shippan&quot; means &quot;the shore where the sea begins.&quot; but others say the meaning of the Indian name is lost.

==Marion Castle==

A waterfront mansion known as Marion Castle (One Rogers Road) is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was built, owned and occupied by the family of Frank Marion until his death in 1963. The house was designed by the noted New York City based firm of Richard Howland Hunt and Joseph Howland Hunt, working as Hunt &amp; Hunt. The Hunt brothers were sons of the &quot;dean of American architecture&quot; Richard Morris Hunt. Marion&#x27;s Castle as it became known was designed in the style of a French chateau completed in either 1914 (according to an October 2, 2005, New York Times article) or in 1916 (&quot;completed in 1916,&quot; according to a July 2006 article in New Canaan/Darien Magazine) Frank J. Marion was a movie industry pioneer who with partners in the Kalem Company produced silent one-reelers shown at nickelodeons. Since 1998 the pile has been owned and occupied by Thomas L. Rich, a Stamford real estate developer well known in the area. Mr. Rich has allowed the usage of the home extensively for non-profit community events.

==The Hotel Chesterfield==
The house at 1404 Shippan Avenue, built around 1880, was operated as a hotel and/or rooming house (under the names Chesterfield Inn, The Shippan Point Inn and Chesterfield House) for more than a century. It was extensively renovated in 2005-2007 by Shippan Point resident John Ruddy. Ruddy opened the business as The Hotel Chesterfield in 2007 as a 9-room boutique hotel. He sold the business to Stamford developer and Shippan Point resident Thomas L. Rich in June 2008. Rich ran the hotel for two years but after being unable to secure a license to serve liquor at the property, Rich closed the hotel and sold it. In 2010 the building was sold as a single-family home.

==Organizations and businesses on Shippan Point==
Shippan Point is home to two yacht clubs, two restaurants, a marina, a private beach club, and a rock climbing gym. They are the Stamford Yacht Club; the Halloween Yacht Club; Brewer Yacht Haven East, a branch of the New England marina chain Brewer Yacht Yards and the Woodway Beach Club. 
Community groups include the Shippan Point Association, the Shippan Gourmet Club (which sponsors dinners at members&#x27; homes six times a year), the Shippan Point Garden Club, and West Beach Neighborhood Coalition.

Our Lady Star of the Sea Church (Roman Catholic) is located on Shippan Avenue. The church was established August 21, 1964, and the current building opened January 15, 1989. It formerly included a parochial school but portions of the school are now leased by Stamford Recreation for its Star Center. Programming includes a summer camp, after-school activities, and classes for kids and adults.

Shippan Point has three restaurants: Brennan&#x27;s, on Iroquois Road, a bar and casual restaurant, The New Olive Branch at 703 Shippan Avenue, and the Stamford Yacht club.

Other nearby restaurants include Café Silvium at 371 Shippan Avenue, an award-winning Italian Restaurant; and a larger Italian restaurant, Tomato Tomato, at 401 Shippan Avenue.

==&quot;Shippan Shuffle&quot;==
It is common for residents to move from one home to another in the neighborhood. The practice has been called the &quot;Shippan Shuffle.&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s not unusual for people to have lived in more than one house here,&quot; a near-lifelong resident said. &quot;In fact, there are probably 100 people here now who have done that.&quot;

==History==
===Up to the American Revolution===
Stamford, once known as Rippowam, was sold by the native Indians to the English settlers. One such deed of July 1, 1640, acknowledges the sale of land to Nathanael Turner of Quenepiocke in exchange for one dozen each of coats, hoes, hatchets, glasses, knives, two kettles and four &quot;fathom of white wampum.&quot; The deed bears the marks of Ponus Sagamore of Toquams, his son Owenoke Sagamore, as well as Wascussue Sagamore of Shippan.

For the next 50 years the English settlers tended to the corn fields, each being responsible for a five-rail fence. By the end of the 17th century, the land was divided into very precise quantities as determined by the landowners at their town meetings. Early settlers included the Ambers, Beldings, Hoyts, Jaggers, Pettits, Waterburys and Weeds.

Belding&#x27;s Bluff, at the southeastern tip of the peninsula, was once a farm of over . When Benjamin Belding died in 1741, his children sold off part of the farm to John Lloyd, a ship owner and operator of a general store at the mouth of the Mill River. Lloyd&#x27;s father owned the section of Long Island known as Lloyd&#x27;s Neck, which was occupied by the British during the American Revolution. On the night of September 5, 1779, Colonel Benjamin Tallmadge led a force of 130 men from Shippan Point to Lloyd&#x27;s Neck, where the surprised Tories surrendered. Several years later, Talmadge was told of a loyalist troop movement on eastern L.I. Talmadge wrote George Washington for permission to cut off the detachment. Once again Shippan was chosen as the site of embarkation, but two days of stormy winter weather thwarted the mission.

===Nineteenth century===
After the Revolutionary War, several large farms of or more flourished on Shippan. In 1799 Moses Rogers paid $8,000 for . In 1800 he purchased additional for $2,791. In 1806 he purchased the Waterbury farm for $10,000 bringing his land holdings to over and eventually owning the entire southern part of the point.

Rogers, a wealthy merchant, formed a partnership with William Walton Woolsey in 1792. Rogers was a director of the First Bank of the United States in 1793, governor of New York Hospital from 1792 to 1797, and a supporter of the New York Society for the Manumission of Slaves. In 1792, Moses Rogers married Sarah Woolsey, sister-in-law of one-time Yale College president Timothy Dwight. In 1812, Rogers built a European styled mansion on the east side of Shippan Avenue, a few hundred feet from where Ocean Drive East is today. A description of the estate can be found in Timothy Dwight&#x27;s &quot;Travels In New England And New York&quot; (1822):

Timothy Dwight, president of Yale College.

:Another is a peninsula on the east side of the harbor, mentioned above under the name of Shippan, the property of Moses Rogers, Esq., of the city of New York. This also is an elegant and fertile piece of ground. The surface slopes in every direction, and is encircled by a collection of exquisite scenery. The Sound, and Long Island beyond it, with a gracefully indented shore, are directly in front, and both stretch westward to a vast distance and eastward till the eye is lost. On each side also lies a harbor bounded by handsome points. A train of groves and bushy island, peculiarly pleasing in themselves, increase by their interruptions the beauty of these waters. The farm itself is a delightful object, with its fields neatly enclosed, its orchards, and its groves. Here Mr. Rogers has formed an avenue, a mile in length, reaching quite to the waters edge. At the same time, he has united plantations of fruit trees, a rich garden, and other interesting objects, so combined as to make this one of the pleasantest retreats in the United States.

Rogers brought in Royal L. Gay from Stafford Springs, CT, to manage the estate. Gay was Stafford&#x27;s selectman and treasurer for years and was also representative to the State Legislature. When Moses Rogers died in 1825, he left his estate to two sons, a daughter, and several grandchildren, brothers and nephews, who administered the estate until the end of the century. The mansion house and surrounding buildings were leased to Isaac Bragg for $400 a year. Bragg was told to protect the garden and specimen plantings, especially in the area south of the house, known as &quot;The Park.&quot; Bragg ran a boarding school on the estate until it fell into disrepair. New tenant S.E. Lawrence restored the property which became a popular picnic area in the summer months, peaking on a day in 1845 with over 500 people.

After the last surviving child of Moses Rogers died in 1866, the first of many public auctions of Shippan land took place. Sally Scofield placed the highest bid of $980 for in the middle of the peninsula. Hundreds of people attended the auctions, and in 1869, &quot;Harpers Weekly&quot; printed a few scenes of the area. A year later, the Rogers&#x27; estate distributed a booklet describing the property. In the 1870s the estate was divided into 400 lots and new streets were made. Two of the streets were named after Rogers&#x27; grandchildren: Van Rensselaer and Verplanck. It was not until 1913 that Rogers&#x27; own name was used as a street name.

In 1885 several large plots of land on the southeastern shore were sold for about $2,000 each. That same year Colonel Woolsey Rogers Hopkins, son of Sarah Elizabeth Hopkins, and grandson of Moses Rogers, paid $8,000 for several land parcels south of the Ocean House hotel. In 1887, Colonel Hopkins built the large mansion at 192 Ocean Drive East. As first president of the Stamford Historical Society, he often entertained its members at his &quot;Holiday House.&quot; Early in the 20th century the house was sold to the Andrus family, who continued to own it until the end of the century.
As part of the promotion of Shippan, a large hotel was built in 1870, called The Ocean House. It stood on Hobson Street, where the Woodway Beach Club is today. To encourage New York City residents to visit the area, a steamer, the &quot;Shippan&quot;, was built in 1866. The Panic of 1873 caused a collapse in the market, which did not recover until the 1880s. Another promotional scheme was the building of the Ocean House Hotel, where potential buyers could stay to get a feel for the area.
===Resort===
The late nineteenth century and early twentieth century were the heyday of Shippan as a summer resort, both for Stamford residents and others who owned or rented summer cottages or stayed at the Ocean House Hotel. &quot;When Michael McDevitt bought it, he renamed it &#x27;Shippan House&#x27;.&quot; By 1890, he had added a pavilion, bath houses, a casino, and a carousel from Asbury Park, New Jersey. It was situated at the spot where later the Woodway Beach Club was built. The Hotel was renovated in 1911 by Leonard Barsaghi.&quot;
In 1887 John Ennis bought land at the southwest end of the point and built a bathing pavilion over the water, where people could swim beneath a roof. He also put in ball fields, and a shed for 150 horses, which was too small to meet demand.

With Stamford Harbor on the west-side of the point, and Westcott Cove to the east, boats were plentiful in the summer months. The Rev. Henry Codman Potter&#x27;s yacht &quot;Pearl&quot; was one of the more impressive sights at Stamford Harbor. A new steamer ship, The &quot;Shippan&quot;, was built in 1866. Some of these vessels ferried passengers to the newly opened Shippan resorts of Ennis and McDeavitt. The racetrack at the northeast end of the peninsula brought even more visitors, so in 1892 the Stamford Street Railway began trolley service to Shippan.

The Stamford Yacht Club was formed in 1890, and the following year, William A. Lottimer was named its first Commodore. The on the western shore were developed by N.W. Barrett of Bridgeport. The club boasted the pleasures of yachting, bathing, tennis, croquet, concerts and receptions. A fire destroyed the original clubhouse in 1913, but within a year a new structure had taken its place.

===Early 20th century===

In 1887, John Ennis bought land at the southwest end of the point and erected a bathing pavilion in the water. Waders could enjoy the refreshing salt water without the worry of sunburn. Some of the grounds were cleared for playing fields, and the shed for 150 horses soon became inadequate for the number of people coming there. Between 1891 and 1893 many meetings for of Stamford Common Council were held to discuss the sale of Ennis&#x27; Park to the town. On Halloween night in 1906, Mayor Homer Cummings cast the deciding vote that turned the of land into a public park. The park, originally called Halloween Park, was developed by civil engineer George Stadel. In 1916 a nine-hole golf course was built there, and later it was renamed Cummings Park.

In 1899 the Moses Rogers house was purchased by the Fosdick Syndicate, later called the Shippan Manor Company. L.D. Marriott opened the Manor School there. A three-story dormitory was added in 1902, which later became home to the Stamford Military Academy. Years later it became the Massee School. A new building was built on the west side of Shippan Avenue, and in 1911 it became the school of Miss Low and Miss Heywood. At about this time Leonard Barsaghi bought and renovated the Shippan House and the casino on the eastern shore.
Real estate continued to flourish, and James Jenkins of the Shippan Land Company developed over of Shippan property. They brought in landfill, and in 1913 opened the new roads of Saddle Rock and Rogers. One year later, Frank J. Marion, a producer of the early &quot;one-reeler&quot; silent films, had a castle built at 1 Rogers Road. Marion Castle was designed by the architectural firm Hunt and Hunt of New York City. When Frank Marion died in 1963, at 96, the property was sold to Martha and David Cogan. Martha was renowned for saving many children from Hitler, and David was an inventor and leader in the development of radio and television, helping to develop the first color television tube for CBS. In 1978, Jay Kobrin and Gordon Micunis of Gordon Micunis Designs purchased Marion Castle. They were influential in placing it on the National Register of Historic Places.

The neighborhood continued to be developed in the early twentieth century. The Shippan Land Company developed over of the peninsula, including Saddle Rock and Rogers Roads in 1913. The Atlantic Realty Company held a large public auction of land in 1914 at Lanark, Auldwood, Downs, and Whittaker avenues. The company even offered three-minute airplane rides to attract prospective buyers. 
Shippan residents complained about city services (it wasn&#x27;t until 1931 that Shippan Avenue was paved) and zoning decisions, and the area once petitioned the state legislature to separate from Stamford and become its own town, although the petition was rejected.
===Off-shore wreck===
The &quot;Isabel,&quot; a wooden passenger steamship, ran aground off the point on 28 September 1915. There were no fatalities. Scattered wreckage remains in the -deep area. There are believed to be small parts of the ship, like windows, buried only a few feet below the sand at the beach at Stamford Yacht Club.

<text>Aomori Broadcasting Corporation (RAB, 青森放送株式会社, &quot;Aomori Hōsō Kabushiki Gaisha&quot;) is a television and radio broadcaster in Aomori, Japan. It is affiliated with [[Aomori Broadcasting Corporation|Japan Radio Network]] ([[Aomori Broadcasting Corporation|JRN]]), [[Aomori Broadcasting Corporation|National Radio Network]] ([[Aomori Broadcasting Corporation|NRN]]), [[Aomori Broadcasting Corporation|Nippon News Network]] ([[Aomori Broadcasting Corporation|NNN]]) and [[Aomori Broadcasting Corporation|Nippon Television Network System]] ([[Aomori Broadcasting Corporation|NNS]]).

As the prefecture doesn&#x27;t have an FNN/FNS affiliate, RAB alongside ATV &amp; ABA air certain Fuji TV programming.

==History==

=== Launch as radio broadcaster ===
There were initial attempts to establish a commercial broadcaster in the prefecture in December 1947, which was then supported with the passage of the &quot;Three Radio Laws&quot; (Radio Law, Broadcasting Law, and Radio Supervisory Committee Establishment Law) in 1950.

At that time, there were competition for private broadcasting license between Radio Tohoku (not related to the former name of Akita Broadcasting), an unnamed local newspaper in Aomori, and Tohoku Broadcasting. In April 1953, Tohoku Radio and Tohoku Broadcasting made a settlement, and Tohoku Broadcasting cancelled its application for a broadcasting license in Aomori Prefecture, and the two cooperated fully. In August of the same year, Radio Tohoku received its broadcasting license which was then renamed to Radio Aomori on September 26.

Radio Aomori was then established on September 30, 1953. A day before its establishment, they conducted trial radio broadcasts. On October 12, 1953, Radio Aomori officially started broadcasting. Upon its launch, Radio Aomori wasn&#x27;t receivable to southern parts of the prefecture. This was later resolved when the Hirosaki relay transmitter was opened in 1956. According to a survey conducted by the local government of Aomori Prefecture in 1957, Radio Aomori accounted for 76.2% in audience share compared to NHK Radio 1&#x27;s 21%.

=== Expansion to TV broadcasting and further developments on radio ===
Radio Aomori started preparing to broadcast on TV since August 1955, and obtained a TV broadcast license in October 1957. They conducted trial broadcasts on September 14, 1959, and officially started TV broadcasting on October 1 of the same year. RAB initially intended to join JNN. However, before it started broadcasting it was discovered that Nippon TV were the most favorable. In October 1961 to reflect the rapid development of their television broadcasting, Aomori Radio changed its name to Aomori Broadcasting. In 1965, RAB joined the JRN and NRN networks at the same time, avoiding costs of having another AM radio station in the prefecture.

RAB started color TV broadcasting in 1966 and expanded to uninterrupted sign-on to sign-off broadcasts in May 1970. On April 1, 1975, RAB started airing TV Asahi programming as it joined ANN after ATV withdrew from being an ANN affiliate. RAB then withdrew from airing ANN programming when Asahi Broadcasting Aomori opened on October 1, 1991, and continued to air Fuji TV programming.

In 1991, RAB won 7 awards in the 1991 Japan Commercial Broadcasters Association Award. Since Video Research started conducting rating surveys in Aomori on 1989, RAB continued to be number 1 in terms of TV rating.

<text>Stainforth () is a town and civil parish in the City of Doncaster, in South Yorkshire, England. It is around north-east of Doncaster, close to Hatfield and Thorne. It had a population of 6,342 in the 2001 census, reducing slightly to 6,282 at the 2011 census.

==Etymology==
The place-name means &#x27;stony ford&#x27; from Old English &quot;stanig&quot; &#x27;stony&#x27; and &quot;ford&quot; &#x27;ford&#x27;. Its name was recorded as &#x27;Stenforde&#x27; in the Domesday Book in 1086 and was later recorded as &#x27;Staneforde&#x27; in 1428.

==History==
Stainforth was established in the Anglo Saxon period and is recorded in the Domesday Book (1086), as a small settlement of 7 households. In 1066, it was under Earl Harold, but after the Norman Conquest it was given by William the Conqueror to William of (de) Warenne. In 1348, Stainforth received a Royal Charter, entitling it to hold a weekly market on Fridays and an annual ten-day fair. The town briefly thrived as a commercial centre and port and attracted traders from as far afield as the Isle of Axholme, but the market soon slumped as Bawtry grew in importance. 
George Porter (later Lord Porter of Luddenham), the Nobel prize winning chemist, was born in the town in 1920.

Stainforth railway station opened on 7 July 1856, and closed on 1 October 1866. The town is now served by Hatfield and Stainforth railway stations.

Speedway racing was staged at the Greyhound Stadium in the town in 1930. The original &quot;professional&quot; promotion failed, and a few meetings organised by a riders&#x27; co-operative were staged at the venue.
More recently, Stainforth was a mining village, with the Hatfield Main Colliery at its centre. The colliery was open for around 90 years, from when it entered full production in 1921 up to its closing in 2015. During the 1972 national strike, a miner from Hatfield Colliery, Freddie Matthews, was killed by a truck while picketing during the strike, which led to a huge crowd at his funeral.

The colliery began reopening in 2006 and resumed full production in January 2008. The colliery closed in June 2015, and the shafts were filled. As a result, the work that was due to begin on a new 900 MW coal-fired power station and industrial estate, Hatfield Power Park, is looking unlikely. The power station would have been linked by a 40-mile (60 km) pipeline to Barmston in the East Riding of Yorkshire, from where CO2 would have been released into porous layers beneath an impermeable bed of the North Sea as part of a carbon capture and storage scheme.

The colliery and the surrounding area have been used in a number of television series and films, most notably &quot;Dalziel and Pascoe&quot; and &quot;Brassed Off&quot;, and more recently &quot;Faith&quot;.

<doc id="1330507" wikidata="Q549760" url="?curid=1330507" title="Reedfish">
<text>The reedfish, ropefish (more commonly used in the United States), or snakefish, Erpetoichthys calabaricus, is a species of fish in the family Polypteridae alongside the bichirs. It is the only member of the genus Erpetoichthys. It is native to fresh and brackish waters in West and Central Africa. The reedfish possesses a pair of lungs in addition to gills, allowing it to survive in very oxygen-poor water. It is threatened by habitat loss through palm oil plantations, other agriculture, deforestation, and urban development.

==Description==
The largest confirmed reedfish museum specimen was long, and three studies where more than 2,000 wild reedfish were caught (using basket traps, meaning that only individuals longer than were retained) found none that exceeded . Although sometimes claimed to reach up to long, this is incorrect.

Body elongation in fishes, such as eels, usually happens through the addition of caudal (tail) vertebrae, but in bichirs it has happened through the addition of precaudal vertebrae. Reedfish have evolved a more snakelike body by having twice as many precaudal vertebrae as the members of its sister genus Polypterus, despite having the same number of tail vertebrae. Pelvic fins are absent, and the long dorsal fin consist of a series of well-separated spines, each supporting one or several articulated rays and a membrane. The reedfish possesses a pair of lungs, enabling it to breathe atmospheric air. This allows the species to survive in water with low dissolved oxygen content and to survive for an intermediate amount of time out of water. The sexes are very similar in both median and maximum length, but females average heavier than males of a similar length, and they can be reliably separated by the shape of their anal fin. Reedfish are dark above and on the sides, with lighter orangish or yellowish underparts. Males are generally more olive-green in colour, whereas females generally are more yellowish-brown. Larvae have conspicuous external gills, making them resemble salamander larvae.

The genus name derives from the Greek words &quot;erpeton&quot; (creeping thing) and &quot;ichthys&quot; (fish).

==Distribution and habitat==
The reedfish inhabits slow-moving or standing, fresh or brackish, relatively warm tropical water, and usually in places with reeds or other dense plant growth. It occurs in Benin, Cameroon and Nigeria, spanning the area from the Ouémé River to the Sanaga River. There are old records from the Chiloango River in DR Congo and Cabinda in Angola, but these are unconfirmed and questionable.

==Ecology==
The reedfish is nocturnal, and feeds on annelid worms, small crustaceans (such as shrimp), insects (both adults and their larvae), snails and small fish. When moving through water slowly, it tends to use its pectoral fins, and when moving quickly changes to an eel-like form of swimming (making more use of full-body movements and the caudal fin). Unlike their sister genus &quot;Polypterus&quot;, which does not leave water voluntarily, reedfish are known to explore land both in the wild and in captivity if given the opportunity, slithering along like a snake and also taking food items on land. Prey captured on land is brought back to the water.

Females repeatedly deposit small batches of eggs between the anal fins of the male, where they are fertilized. The male reedfish then scatters the eggs among aquatic vegetation, where they stick to plants and substrate. Larvae hatch rapidly (after 70 hours) but remain attached to vegetation; they become independent and start to feed after ~22 days, when the egg&#x27;s yolk sac has been consumed. 

==Conservation==
In coastal central Africa, the species is threatened by habitat loss driven by the development of oil palm plantations. Populations in western Africa are impacted by degradation and loss of habitat from wetland drainage for agricultural and urban developments. The reedfish is currently classified as Near Threatened by the IUCN. It is regarded as a good food fish and commonly caught in the local subsistence fishery. It is also regularly caught for the international aquarium fish trade. Overall, catch levels do not appear to represent a major threat to the species at present, but do need monitoring.

==In the aquarium==
Reedfish are sometimes displayed in aquaria. All aquarium fish are wild-caught; they have not yet been successfully bred in captivity. Spawning and hatching in captivity has been observed, but no hatchlings have been reported to survive to adulthood.

They are inquisitive, peaceful, and have some &quot;personality&quot;. Although nocturnal, reedfish will sometimes come out during the day. Since they have a peaceful nature, other fish may &quot;bully&quot; a reedfish, despite its large size, especially in competition for food or space. Some reedfish also have an inclination to stay close to the water surface, where they will be safe from other fish and will even allow most of their bodies to leave the water at times.

They can be difficult to keep; they will jump and enter pumps to escape tanks and frequently die as a result, and they can be sensitive to pH swings and nitrogen chemistry. They will often consume other smaller fish when given the opportunity. Often small feeder goldfish and minnows are eaten in place of bloodworms or nightcrawlers, and other commercially available live fish food.

<text>The A614 is a main road in England running through the counties of Nottinghamshire, South Yorkshire and the East Riding of Yorkshire.

==Route==
Beginning at Redhill, the northernmost point in the Nottingham suburb of Arnold in Nottinghamshire, the road meets the A60 and A6097 at Redhill roundabout then passes Bilsthorpe. At Rufford there is a Center Parcs resort and Rufford Country Park. This is near to Edwinstowe, famed for its connections with Robin Hood. The road meets several other roads on a small roundabout at Ollerton with fuel stations and fast food outlets. 

The road passes Clumber Park and goes past the entrance to the former Army Proteus training camp. The road passes over the River Poulter. At Apleyhead Wood, the road meets the A1 and A57. Major works were started on the Apleyhead junction in 2006 to convert the roundabout into a dual-grade junction (GSJ). This work was completed on 20 May 2008. The A614 overlaps the A1 for north.

At junction 34 of the A1(M) at Blyth, next to a large Moto service station, the road runs north to the settlement of Bawtry, passing to the south of a nearby colliery at Harworth. At Bawtry the road meets the A638, a Roman road which heads into Doncaster, passing under the East Coast Main Line here. At Finningley, the road passes around the runway of Robin Hood Airport Doncaster Sheffield, the former RAF Finningley. The road has a level crossing with the Doncaster-Lincoln railway line and the River Torne is crossed. Near Hatfield Woodhouse, the road passes a prison. The road meets the M180 and A18 at a roundabout at Thorne, the former terminus of the A18(M), the M18 at junction 6, follows the River Don for then crosses it where the river becomes the Dutch River.

From Goole, the road continues in a north-easterly direction, crosses the M62 and passes over the River Ouse on the iron-girder Boothferry Bridge before intersecting with the M62 at junction 36.

From here, the road becomes a trunk road running through the settlements of Howden, Holme-on-Spalding-Moor, Driffield, ending on the Yorkshire coast at Bridlington, where it joins the A165.

==History==
===Former route in Nottinghamshire===
The road used to continue south from the junction with the A60, next to the Little Chef, and overlap the A60. The north-west section of the Nottingham western bypass, up to the A52 junction, near the Queen&#x27;s Medical Centre (before the Clifton Boulevard was built) was the A614 for some time and is now the A6514. Before renumbering of Clifton Boulevard to the A52, concurrent with the numbering of the A614 to A6514, the section from the A52 to A606 was also A614.

===Former route in the East Riding of Yorkshire===
Originally, the A614 went from Thorne via Snaith to Selby. The current section from Goole through Rawcliffe was the A161 (from Gainsborough). From Goole to Holme-on-Spalding Moor, it was the A1041. From here through Market Weighton, to Driffield, it was the A163. From here to Bridlington, it used to be the A166 (which is the road from York). More recently, it finished at Holme-on-Spalding-Moor, then what is now the A614, carried on north as the A163 (from Selby), then as the A164 (from Beverley) just before Driffield.

===Fatal accident in February 2009===
On Friday, 13 February 2009 just after 23:00 six people were killed in a head-on collision on the road in Nottinghamshire between the Bilsthorpe crossroads and the Eakring turn-off. The victims were four teenagers in one car, and an elderly couple in the other.

The cause of the accident was concluded by the coroner as to have happened as a result of &quot;inappropriate overtaking&quot; by the driver of the teenagers&#x27; car.

<doc id="1330509" wikidata="Q2147537" url="?curid=1330509" title="USS Susquehanna (ID-3016)">
<text>USS &quot;Susquehanna&quot; (ID-3016) was a transport for the United States Navy during World War I. She was the second U.S. Navy ship to be named for the Susquehanna River. Before the war she operated at SS &quot;Rhein, an [[ocean liner]] for [[North German Lloyd]]. She was the [[lead ship]] of her class of three ocean liners. After the end of World War I, the ship operated briefly in passenger service asSS &quot;Susquehanna. Laid up in 1922, &quot;Susquehanna&quot; was sold to Japanese ship breakers in 1928 and scrapped.

== History ==
SS &quot;Rhein&quot; was launched on 20 September 1899 by Blohm &amp; Voss of Hamburg, Germany, for North German Lloyd. The ship was long between perpendiculars ( overall) was abeam, and had a draft of . The ship&#x27;s two quadruple-expansion steam engines turned her twin screw propellers that drove her at speeds of .

&quot;Rhein&quot; sailed from Bremen to New York on 9 December 1899 for her maiden voyage, and began regular Bremen–Baltimore service in May 1900. Later that same year, &quot;Rhein&quot; served as a transport carrying German Empire troops as part of the Eight-Nation Alliance intended to put down the Boxer Rebellion in China. From September to November 1901, &quot;Rhein&quot; sailed on a Bremen – Suez Canal – Australia route.
Returning to North Atlantic sailings at the end of 1901, &quot;Rhein&quot; sailed from Bremen variously to New York, Baltimore, or Philadelphia through 1914. She began what would become her last voyage for North German Lloyd on 16 July 1914 when she left Bremen bound for Baltimore, and was in that port when Germany declared war in early August. As a neutral in the war at that time, the United States interned the liner and her sister ship , which was also in Baltimore. The two sisters would remain idle in Baltimore for almost three years.
After the United States declared war on Germany on 6 April 1917, &quot;Rhein&quot;, along with all other German ships interned in American ports, was seized by U.S. authorities. Initially handed over to the United States Shipping Board (USSB), she was later transferred to the U.S. Navy to effect repairs caused by neglect and sabotage by her German crew. The ship was overhauled, reconditioned, fitted out as a transport, and commissioned as USS &quot;Susquehanna&quot; at Norfolk, Virginia, on 5 September 1917. USS &quot;Susquehanna&quot; sailed from New York on her first voyage with troops on 14 December 1917, under the command of Captain Zachariah H. Madison with Commander Allen B. Reed, executive officer. Subsequently, Commander Reed relieved Captain Madison of command on 22 August 1918. Both commanding officers were awarded the Navy Cross in 1920 for the hazardous duty of commanding the troop ship through waters that were mined and patrolled by German U-boats.

On 29 May 1918, &quot;Susquehanna&quot;, escorted by three American and one French destroyer, got underway from Brest, France, with troopships , and for the return voyage to the U.S. At sundown on 30 May 1918, having passed through the so-called &quot;danger zone&quot; of submarine activity, the destroyers left the convoy to proceed alone. At about 09:00 on 31 May 1918, , with Commander Percy Foote, in command, was struck by three torpedoes from the German submarine , and sank about 20 minutes later. Of the 715 people aboard, 26 men were lost with the ship, and a Lieutenant Edward Isaacs was taken aboard &quot;U-90&quot; as prisoner. Survivors were rescued from lifeboats late that night by destroyers and . They were taken to France, arriving at Brest on 2 June. at 33,000 tons, was the largest U.S. Naval vessel to be lost in World War I.

&quot;Susquehanna&quot; was attached to the Cruiser and Transport Force and made eight round trips to Europe before the Armistice, transporting 18,348 troops. After the Armistice, she made seven more voyages to France and returned 15,537 passengers to the United States. In addition to the initial voyage from New York, &quot;Susquehanna&quot;″s voyages were from Newport News, Virginia, to Brest, France, and to Saint-Nazaire, France. &quot;Susquehanna&quot; was placed out of commission on 27 August 1919 and turned over to the USSB.

The ship was chartered to the United States Mail Steamship Company (U.S. Mail Line) and began passenger service from New York to Bremen in August 1920. When the U.S. Mail Line ran into financial difficulties, SS &quot;Susquehanna&quot;, along with the other six former German vessels the company had chartered, was seized in April 1921 by the USSB, and later placed with the newly formed United States Lines. Beginning in April 1922, &quot;Susquehanna&quot; sailed on a New York – Plymouth – Cherbourg – Bremen route. Laid up in September 1922 after completing five roundtrips for United States Lines, the ship was sold in November 1928 to Japanese interests for scrapping.

<text>Keith Oliver Geddes (born 1947) is a professor emeritus in the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science within the Faculty of Mathematics at the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Ontario. He is a former director of the Symbolic Computation Group in the School of Computer Science. He received a BA in Mathematics at the University of Saskatchewan in 1968; he completed both his MSc and PhD in Computer Science at the University of Toronto.

Geddes is probably best known for co-founding the Maple computer algebra system, now in widespread academic use around the world. He is also the Scientific Director at the Ontario Research Centre for Computer Algebra, and is a member of the Association for Computing Machinery, as well as the American and Canadian Mathematical Societies.

== Research ==
Geddes&#x27; primary research interest is to develop algorithms for the mechanization of mathematics. More specifically, he is interested in the computational aspects of algebra and analysis. Currently, he is focusing on designing hybrid symbolic-numeric algorithms to perform definite integration and solve ordinary and partial differential equations.

Much of his work currently revolves around Maple.

== Teaching ==
Geddes retired from teaching in December 2008.
Geddes taught a mixture of both senior-level symbolic computation courses, at both the undergraduate and graduate level, as well as introductory courses on the principles of computer science.

<doc id="1330514" wikidata="Q2367412" url="?curid=1330514" title="Twin Sons of Different Mothers">
<text>Twin Sons of Different Mothers is a collaboration album by American singer-songwriter Dan Fogelberg and jazz flutist Tim Weisberg, released in 1978. It was the first of two collaborations between the pair; the second was &quot;No Resemblance Whatsoever&quot;. 

The album peaked at number 8 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;, and at number 7 on the &quot;Cashbox&quot; Top 100 Albums. The album was a double-platinum seller. The closing track of the album, &quot;The Power of Gold&quot;, was released as a single, reaching number 24 on the &quot;Billboard Hot 100&quot; and number 51 in Canada.

==Background==
American music journalist Paul Zollo wrote that after the success of Fogelberg&#x27;s album &quot;Nether Lands&quot;, he wanted to make his next album &quot;completely about music, without any commercial aspirations whatsoever&quot;. Having previously worked with Weisberg on &quot;Nether Lands&quot;, Fogelberg invited him to make the album a duet. At the time, they both had long hair and beards, so they decided to title the album &quot;Twin Sons Of Different Mothers&quot;. The single &quot;The Power of Gold&quot; was added to the album at the last minute, due to the initial track they had planned on, had the piano out of tune with the orchestra, and it would have to be redone. To avoid the cost of that endeavor, Fogelberg quickly penned &quot;Power of Gold&quot;, which was instead added to the album. Little did he know, Zollo opines, that the single would become one of the &quot;biggest hits of his career&quot;. 

Zollo also wrote that Fogelberg wasn&#x27;t really optimistic about the success of the duo&#x27;s album, and &quot;expected it to be savagely attacked by the critics&quot;, so he flew to Europe with some friends before the album was released. He was astounded when he received an &quot;excited call from his manager Irving Azoff informing him that the album had gone Top 20&quot;. Zollo goes on to say that Fogelberg figured &quot;there was no sense in fighting it&quot;, so he then returned to the United States, and &quot;went into the studio immediately to work on songs for his next album, &quot;Phoenix&quot;&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Cash Box Magazine&quot; said the album &quot;combines the talents of two performers in an experimental way&quot; and &quot;interestingly blends the folk-rock, guitar flavored elements of Fogelberg&#x27;s music with Weisberg&#x27;s more airy, free-spirited, flute laden sound&quot;. They pointed to &quot;Tell Me To My Face&quot; and &quot;The Power of Gold&quot; as &quot;standouts&quot; on the LP. Madeline Kind of &quot;The Jerusalem Post Magazine&quot;, was blunt in her assessment of the album, calling it &quot;rather boring&quot;. 

Author Dave DiMartino from &quot;Billboard Books&quot;, highlighted the &quot;extraordinary version&quot; of The Hollies &quot;Tell Me to My Face&quot;, that &quot;revealed an aspect of Fogelberg&#x27;s rock roots that hasn&#x27;t been on display since&quot;. In 2003, &quot;Blender Magazine&quot; rated &quot;Twin Sons of Different Mothers&quot; as the &quot;worst CD&quot; of Fogelberg&#x27;s, with Fogelberg additionally being listed number 19 on &quot;The 50 Worst Artists In Music History&quot;.

The &quot;San Francisco Bay Guardian&quot; said the album was &quot;generally satisfying&quot;, remarking that Fogelberg &quot;dominated most of the album&quot;, and praised the tracks &quot;Hurtwood Alley&quot; and &quot;The Power of Gold&quot; as &quot;especially propelling&quot;. They also noted that the album had an &quot;occasional tendency toward musical cliche&quot;. They criticized &quot;Guitar Etude No. 3&quot; as sounding like a &quot;warped version of &#x27;Girl From Ipanema&#x27;&quot;. 

American music critic Dave Marsh wrote in &quot;The Rolling Stone Record Guide&quot; that the album reminded him of &quot;smooth post-rock cocktail-lounge Muzak&quot;. He criticized Fogelberg for being &quot;bland&quot;, but said Weisberg made up for it in &quot;spades&quot;. He also said the &quot;combination ought to be marked as an insomnia cure&quot;.

<doc id="1330516" wikidata="Q1418568" url="?curid=1330516" title="Nowhere Man (song)">
<text>&quot;Nowhere Man&quot; is a song by the English rock band the Beatles. It was released in December 1965 on their album &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, except in the United States and Canada, where it was first issued as a single A-side in February 1966 before appearing on the album &quot;Yesterday and Today&quot;. The song was written by John Lennon and credited to the Lennon–McCartney partnership. In the U.S., the single peaked at number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 1 on the chart compiled by &quot;Record World&quot; magazine, as it did the &quot;RPM&quot; 100 chart in Canada and in Australia. The song was also released as a single in some countries where it had been included on &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, including Australia, where it topped the singles chart.

Recorded on 21 and 22 October 1965, &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; describes a man with no direction in his life and with no genuine worldview. It is one of the first Beatles songs to be entirely unrelated to romance or love, and marks a notable example of Lennon&#x27;s philosophically oriented songwriting. Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison sing the song in three-part harmony. The lead guitar solo was performed in unison by Harrison and Lennon. The pair played identical &quot;sonic blue&quot;-coloured Fender Stratocasters on the track. The song appears in the film &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;, where the Beatles sing it about the character Jeremy Hillary Boob after meeting him in the &quot;nowhere land&quot;. The song was also played throughout the Beatles&#x27; 1966 US tour and their 1966 tour of Germany, Japan and the Philippines.

==Background==
Towards the end of the production for &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, John Lennon had difficulties in coming up with a new song. He spent over five hours trying to come up with another song, and eventually decided to &quot;lay down&quot;. During his idling, Lennon suddenly thought of himself as being a &quot;Nowhere Man—sitting in his nowhere land&quot;. Lennon then shared the lyrics he had written with McCartney. McCartney said that Lennon wrote the song for himself, personally interpreting it to be about his marriage and described it as an &quot;anti-John song&quot;. Lennon had written the song in the third-person, deciding to end the song with the lyric &quot;Isn&#x27;t he a bit like you and me?&quot; The song is generally credited as being among the first Beatles&#x27; songs not pertaining to themes of romance or love. Lennon reflected in a 1980 &quot;Playboy&quot; interview that:

McCartney said of the song:

Reviewing the U.S. single release, &quot;Record World&quot; called it a &quot;meaningful song about what happens to a fellow afraid to be himself.&quot;

==Analysis==

The song as a whole is a 32-bar form, following the standard model of the Tin Pan Alley chorus, with a repeating 8-bar primary statement outlining the E-major chord, a third phrase (bars 17–24) forming a musical question (concluding on the dominant B), and a fourth phrase recapitulating the initial statement in E major. The primary statement begins with the chord of E (I tonic) on &quot;He&#x27;s a real&quot; and then involves a 5–4–3–2–1 pitch descent between the B (V dominant) chord on &quot;nowhere man&quot; and A (IV subdominant) chord on &quot;sitting in&quot;; a twist comes where Am (iv minor) replaces A in the final line (&quot;nowhere plans&quot;) and the simultaneous G note melody creates a dissonant AmM7. The bridge (a standard third-phrase &quot;B&quot; in the AABA form), which appears three times, seesaws on a G minor/A major (iii–IV) sequence before falling back on an F minor and leading back to the verse on a B7, as is typical of &quot;Tin-pan alley&quot; standard B sections.

==Other recordings==
A ukulele version of &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; by Tiny Tim was Harrison&#x27;s contribution to the Beatles&#x27; 1968 Christmas record. Distributed to members of the Beatles&#x27; fan club, the record differed from the band&#x27;s previous Christmas records by including separate contributions from the four bandmates, reflecting the disharmony within the group at the time. Beatles historian John Winn describes Tim&#x27;s version as the &quot;highlight of the disc&quot; and a &quot;timeless&quot; interpretation.

The song has attracted many other performers. There is a recording in the synth-pop style by Gershon Kingsley, a glam metal recording by Dokken and an easy-listening recording by Yanni. In his book on the legacy of &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, John Kruth expresses disappointment in the Carpenters&#x27; version, which was recorded in 1968 and released in 2001, following singer Karen Carpenter&#x27;s death (she died in 1983), with a &quot;ludicrous&quot; overdubbed string arrangement. He highlights a &quot;down-home take&quot; by Randy Travis for the 1995 &quot;Come Together&quot; Beatles tribute album for its &quot;sweet cascading pedal steel riff&quot;. The Paul Westerberg&#x27;s acoustic rendering in the soundtrack 2001 film &quot;I Am Sam&quot; transforming the song into a &quot;regretful lullaby&quot;. He also recognises former Ramones drummer Marky Ramone as the singer who made a &quot;balls-to-the-wall version&quot;, pointing out that in Ramone&#x27;s 1999 version, Ramone &quot;spits and sprays Lennon&#x27;s lyrics while guitars slash and grind&quot;.

==Personnel==
According to Ian MacDonald:
*John Lennon – double-tracked vocal, acoustic rhythm guitar
*Paul McCartney – harmony vocal, bass guitar
*George Harrison – harmony vocal, lead guitar
*Ringo Starr – drums

<text>Hieronim Radziejowski (1612 — 8 August 1667) was a Polish noble, politician, diplomat, scholar and a military commander. He was the governor of Sochaczew since 1643 and Vice-Chancellor of the Crown between 1650 and 1652. He also served as Marshal of the Sejm from 13 February to 27 March 1645 in Warsaw.

He came into conflict with King John II Casimir when he found out that his wife, Elżbieta Słuszka was the King&#x27;s mistress. Radziejowski started to conspire against the King with the enemies, and as a result was sentenced to infamy and banishment (exile) in 1652 by the Sejm Tribunal. He left Poland for Sweden, and convinced the Swedish to attack the Commonwealth. In 1655, Radziejowski accompanied the Swedish forces during their invasion of Poland in the course of The Deluge. He played an important role in persuading the militia (pospolite ruszenie) to surrender at Ujście. In 1662 he was pardoned by the Sejm. In 1667 he went on a diplomatic mission to the Ottoman Empire and died there.

He was the father of Michał Stefan Radziejowski.

==Early political career==
At the beginning of the seventeenth century he arrived at the court of King Władysław IV, where he quickly gained considerable influence, and most notably was appointed the &quot;starost&quot; of Sochaczew. In 1640, for the first time, he became a senator in the Sejm (parliament) despite a scandal (before the meeting of the parliament he was accused of rape). In 1645 he was appointed Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies. Afterwards, on behalf of the king, he was involved in secret negotiations with the Cossacks for their support of Poland in an expedition against the Turks. However in 1646, when the secret negotiations became public, the nobles and senators of the Sejm, opposed the campaign. At the same time Radziejowski gained influence at the court of the queen, appearing at the same parliament session to defend her royal interests. In 1648 he participated in the Battle of Piławce. Radziejowski was one of the noblemen accused of contributing to the escape of the Polish army during that battle. He then campaigned for the election of John II Casimir and supported his marriage to the widow of Władysław IV, Queen Marie Louise Gonzaga. In 1648 he was the elector of John II Casimir representing the city of Łomża. In May 1650, he married (his two previous wives died) the newly widowed Elżbieta Służka, an heir to a great fortune from her deceased husband, great magnate Adam Kazanowski. In the same year he was appointed the Vice-Chancellor of the Crown, which was accompanied by another scandal; during his speech in the parliament, while receiving the royal seal, the Grand Marshal of the Crown Prince Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski claimed that Radziejowski bought his position and post in the government.

==Conflict with King John II Casimir==
In 1651, during an expedition against the Cossacks, the king ordered the confiscation all belongings of Radziejowski for safe keeping. Among the most important was a letter to the Queen, in which Radziejowski heavily criticized John Casimir, for the conduct of the expedition and also suggested that the king was having an affair with his wife (who accompanied him in the expedition). After the king found out about the note, Vice-Chancellor Radziejowski was instantly and permanently removed from the Sejm. Radziejowski then, in revenge, spread rumors about the hostility of the king in relation to the nobility. However, before the Battle of Berestechko, Radziejowski reconciled with the monarch. Despite this, a conflict erupted again after the campaign. Working with Radziejowski was another nobleman, Marcin Dębicki, who headed the General Nobility Movement (the regional military council) and also accused the monarch of inept command and that the royal units allowed the Cossacks to retreat and escape during the counter-attack of the Polish army. Radziejowski himself proposed to dissolve the militia (known as pospolite ruszenie) and begin negotiations with the rebel army under the command of Bohdan Khmelnytsky, and when the council that he supported did not obey his demands, Radziejowski left the camp which led to a significant part of the nobility leaving the battlefield and not aiding the king.

==Divorce and family conflicts==
Meanwhile, his wife, after the disclosure of the contents of the letter left the camp, requested an immediate divorce. She then became a nun in a monastery (Radziejowski later attempted to kidnap his wife from the convent, but was stopped by the royal guards), demanded the help of her brother, Bogusław Słuszka, in the removal of Radziejowski from the property where she once lived which was now occupied by him. When Radziejowski refused to leave the estate, Słuszka challenged him to a duel. Again he refused and, in the absence of the host, Słuszka stormed and captured the palace using force. Radziejowski informed of the attack gathered the nobles and on 5 January 1652 tried to recapture the palace, but didn&#x27;t succeed.

==Trial and judgement==

The next day Radziejowski was accused, before the court marshal, of insulting the government by his preceding actions and by breaking the law (under the term subject to any armed incident in the four weeks preceding the Sejm sitting, on the members or dignitaries of state law, however, this policy was never used before) and safety violations of a royal residence. Radziejowski successfully hid from the envoys of the king, not allowing them to provide him with a lawsuit, so that later he claimed that he was not aware of the trial; he also accused Słuszka of insulting the Crown Court in Piotrków Trybunalski. Despite his excuses and the procedural difficulties, the Crown Court sentenced Radziejowski to death. However, few days later he was pardoned by the king and instead his sentence was commuted to exile. The court in this case – in the absence of Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski, who, as the Grand Marshal, was responsible for the protection of the king and his house but after a quarrel with Vice-Chancellor Słuszka he left the capital – was chaired by the Deputy Speaker of the court of the Crown Łukasz Opaliński, who greatly supported Radziejowski&#x27;s politics and policies. Greatly unhappy with the court&#x27;s decision, Opaliński held another trial, this time against Słuszka. The nobles blamed the royal court of provocation – previously Słuszka was provided the King&#x27;s patronage after he saved the monarch&#x27;s life, therefore he was protected by the Crown. Eventually, because the nobles and the magnates greatly supported Radziejowski, Słuszka was to be exiled and Radziejowski was to be freed. Despite this judgment, the king, furious about the nobles&#x27; and court&#x27;s decision, was not going to give up. The acquisition of the letters from Radziejowski addressed to enemies like Bohdan Khmelnytsky and Ivan Vyhovsky by the king and then revealing the content of those letters eventually discredited him in the eyes of the nobility. The monarch cleverly used this technique to turn the nobles against Radziejowski, a man that they previously supported. Following this Radziejowski received letters about a planned assassination attempt on his life. He then turned to the Polish Sejm for help and protection, but the displeased nobles and the furious and insulted royal government instantly refused. Worried for his life, he fled from Poland on 15 February. Upon the return of Prince Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski, the Sejm and the Crown Court recognized Radziejowski as a traitor and an enemy of the state.

==In Swedish service==
After his escape, he arrived in Vienna, where he was considered a political adventurer and was denied aid. In 1652 he came to Sweden, where he was accepted into the royal Stockholm court of Queen Christina. He was the co-author of an anti-Polish alliance between Sweden, the Cossacks and Transylvania. He then went to Hamburg, where he sustained correspondence with the new King of Sweden Charles Gustav. It was in this city that Radziejowski and Charles Gustav signed a pact where they both agreed to invade Poland if the Sejm demanded Radziejowski to return to be convicted.

His position at the side of the king has never been greatly influential, however, Radziejowski skillfully tried to make an impression on the nobility and later he asked for the protection from the Swedish parliament. His knowledge of &quot;Polish reality&quot; and military tactics was useful and was of great importance for Charles Gustav, trying to pacify the country. But already in autumn a new political and military situation decreased the influence of Radziejowski that he had on the king, and at the same time it increased the divergence between him and the Swedish king.

In 1656 he was unexpectedly arrested in the city of Elbląg by the Swedes and was imprisoned in the castle in Malbork. At the beginning of 1657 he was prosecuted for betraying the interests of Charles Gustav and imprisoned in the castle of Örebro in Sweden. This was primarily caused by Charles Gustav&#x27;s worries that Radziejowski could be a spy for Poland and especially create tensions between the two countries to cause war that would decrease Sweden&#x27;s power in the region. In 1660 he was released from captivity.

==Rehabilitation, later life and death==
After the &quot;Deluge&quot; (Great Northern War) in 1662, Radziejowski regained his former possessions and estates in Poland. The parliament, following some disputes, forgave him all the insults, but still claimed that the rehabilitation of honors and his titles would be to risky and cause damage to the current government. During the Lubomirski Rebellion he faithfully stood on the side of the Polish king. However, he did not fulfill the hope of regaining his former Deputy-Chancellor post. In his last years he planned to be ordained as a priest.

In 1667 Radziejowski died, probably of a contagious disease during his diplomatic mission to the Ottoman Empire.

<text>What is known today as the Tryon Resolves (entitled at the time the Tryon Declaration of Rights and Independence from British Tyranny) was a brief declaration adopted and signed by &quot;subscribers&quot; to the Tryon County Association that was formed in Tryon County, North Carolina in the early days of the American Revolution. In the Resolves—a modern name for the Association&#x27;s charter document—the county representatives vowed resistance to the increasingly coercive actions being enacted by the government of Great Britain against its North American colonies. The document was signed on August 14, 1775, but—like other similar declarations of the time—stopped short of calling for total independence from Britain.

==Background==
The &quot;Tryon Association&quot; was formed with the signing of the &quot;Tryon Declaration of Rights and Independence from British Tyranny&quot;. (This document only became known as &quot;The Tryon Resolves&quot; in the 20th-century.) The Association was formed in response to the April 19, 1775, Battle of Lexington. The Resolves was among the earliest of many local colonial declarations against the coercive policies that the British government had instituted in the colonies that were considered oppressive by the colonists. Other similar associations with signed &quot;declarations&quot; from the same period included the Mecklenburg Resolves (adopted in nearby Mecklenburg County, North Carolina) and the Suffolk Resolves (adopted in Suffolk County, Massachusetts). The Tryon Resolves predated the United States Declaration of Independence by almost 11 months, but stopped short of proscribing independence from Britain, instead supporting armed resistance until a resolution with England could be made.

As tensions between the North American colonies and the British government continued to increase, county residents began forming Committees of Safety to prepare militia companies for a potential war. On September 14, 1775, many of the signers of the Tryon Resolves formed the Tryon County Militia in preparation for British retaliation against American revolutionaries.

==Text summary and effect==

In the Tryon Resolves:
* The county residents refer to &quot;the painful necessity of having recourse to arms in defense of our National freedom and constitutional rights, against all invasions;
* Vow to take up arms and risk our lives and our fortunes in maintaining the freedom of our country...&quot;
* The colonists declare they will continue to follow the Continental Congress or Provincial Conventions in defiance of British declarations that these were illegal;
* The signers warn that force will be met with force until such a time as a &quot;reconciliation&quot; can be made between the colonies and Britain.
