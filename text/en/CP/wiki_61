<text>WWOR-TV (channel 9) is a television station licensed to Secaucus, New Jersey, United States, serving the New York metropolitan area as the flagship of the MyNetworkTV programming service. It is owned and operated by Fox Television Stations alongside Fox flagship WNYW (channel 5). The two stations share studios at the Fox Television Center on East 67th Street in Manhattan&#x27;s Lenox Hill neighborhood; WWOR-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located at One World Trade Center.

==History==
===WOR-TV (1949–1987)===
====Early history====
Channel 9 signed on the air on October 11, 1949, as WOR-TV. It was owned by the Bamberger Broadcasting Service (a division of R.H. Macy and Company and named after the Bamberger&#x27;s department store chain), which also operated WOR (710 AM) and WOR-FM (98.7 FM, now WEPN-FM). Exactly ten months earlier, Bamberger launched Washington, D.C.&#x27;s fourth television station, WOIC (now WUSA), also on channel 9. WOR-TV entered the New York market as the last of the city&#x27;s VHF stations to sign on, and one of three independents—the others being WPIX (channel 11) and Newark, New Jersey–based WATV (channel 13). On WOR-TV&#x27;s opening night, a welcome address was read by WOR radio&#x27;s morning host, John B. Gambling. However, the audio portion of the speech was not heard because of a technical glitch. The problem was fixed and Gambling repeated the message later that evening, prior to the station&#x27;s sign-off.

That first broadcast and other early WOR-TV shows emanated from the New Amsterdam Theatre&#x27;s Roof Garden, located west of Times Square. For a short time, the station&#x27;s transmitter operated from WOR TV Tower in North Bergen, New Jersey, and was later moved to the Empire State Building. At the start of 1950, Bamberger Broadcasting changed its name to General Teleradio. Later that year, WOIC was sold to a joint venture of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and CBS, who would change that station&#x27;s call sign to WTOP-TV. In 1951, the station moved uptown to the newly constructed &quot;9 Television Square&quot; facility at 101 West 67th Street. The West 67th Street studio was built from the ground up as a television facility. Initially built by the Robert Gless Co. for the Bamberger Broadcasting Service, the building itself was owned by the Macy&#x27;s employee pension fund, and it had been leased prior to completion to Thomas S. Lee Enterprises (a company that was later absorbed into RKO General). Lee, the son of the broadcasting pioneer Don Lee, owned several Mutual Network stations on the West Coast, and held a 25-year lease on the building running January 1952 to January 1977. Soon after the building was completed in 1952, Macy&#x27;s–Bamberger&#x27;s merged the WOR stations with the General Tire and Rubber Company, which already had broadcasting interests in three cities through two other subsidiaries: the regional Yankee Radio Network and WNAC AM–FM–TV in Boston; and the Don Lee Broadcasting System, which operated KHJ AM–FM–TV in Los Angeles and KFRC AM–FM in San Francisco. The subsidiaries were then brought together under the General Teleradio name. The main impetus for the merger was to give General Tire a controlling share in the Mutual Radio Network, which was affiliated with and partially owned by WOR and other stations. The merger also raised speculation that Mutual would launch a television network, plans that were discussed since before WOR-TV went on the air. However, shortly before the merger, in April 1950, plans for the proposed Mutual-branded network advanced far enough that, at the annual meeting of Mutual stockholders, network president Frank White made an official announcement of the planned creation of a limited five-station Mutual network (Boston, New York, Washington, D.C., Chicago, &amp; Los Angeles). At that same time Mutual radio station KQV in Pittsburgh, which was engaged in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to get a television license, was reportedly hoping for their station to be a Mutual television affiliate. &quot;Mutual Television Network&quot; ended up being the decided-on branding for the Mutual-branded network. However, the five-station Mutual network failed in short time. After a transitional period, WOR relocated TV operations to their headquarters at 1440 Broadway closer to its radio station sisters and to a new compact studio for news and special events programming located on the 83rd floor of the Empire State Building. In early 1954, RKO sublet the 67th Street facility (both building and TV equipment) to NBC for three years with options for extensions.

In 1955, General Tire purchased RKO Radio Pictures, giving the company&#x27;s TV stations access to RKO&#x27;s film library, and in 1959, General Tire&#x27;s broadcasting and film divisions were renamed as RKO General. During the 1950s and early 1960s, all three of New York&#x27;s independents struggled to find competitive and acceptable programming. The field would increase by one in 1956 when former DuMont flagship station WABD (channel 5) became an independent. During this era, WOR-TV&#x27;s programming was comparable to its rivals, with a blend of movies, children&#x27;s programs, cancelled TV series which had previously run on one of the networks and public affairs shows. In 1962, the field of independent stations was narrowed to three, as WOR-TV and its competition benefited from the sale of WNTA-TV (channel 13) to the non-profit Educational Broadcasting Corporation, who would convert the station to a non-commercial educational station.

For much of the 1960s, WOR-TV was a standard independent station with a schedule composed of some local public affairs shows, off-network programs, children&#x27;s shows such as &quot;The Friendly Giant&quot; (which later moved to WNDT) and &quot;Romper Room&quot; (which moved to the station from WNEW-TV in 1966), sporting events, and a large catalog of movies, some of which came from the RKO Radio Pictures film library. Until 1985, the station had a tradition of showing &quot;King Kong&quot;, &quot;Son of Kong&quot; and &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot; on Thanksgiving and &quot;Godzilla&quot; films the day after Thanksgiving.

In 1962, nostalgia maven Joe Franklin moved his daily talk program to WOR-TV, after a 12-year run on WABC-TV. &quot;The Joe Franklin Show&quot; ended on August 6, 1993, which, having run for 42 years, makes it one of the longest-running programs in television history, local or national. The long-running public affairs show &quot;Firing Line&quot; began on WOR-TV in 1966 and ran on the station until 1971, after which its host, William F. Buckley, Jr., moved the program to public television where the program aired until it ended in 1999. In 1968, the station continued to maintain offices at 1440 Broadway, while the station moved to new studio facilities two blocks north at 1481 Broadway.

====1970s====

By the early 1970s, WNEW-TV evolved into the leading station for cartoons and sitcoms, while WPIX aired a similar format though with more movies. In the early 1970s, WOR-TV had shows such as &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; and &quot;The Avengers&quot;. Beginning in 1971, the station began gradually seeking a different programming strategy—one that was more adult-oriented with a heavy emphasis on films, reruns of hour-long network dramas, game shows and sports. The station also gradually phased out most sitcoms and all children&#x27;s programming with the exception of &quot;Romper Room.&quot; It was also the first New York City station to have a 12 p.m. newscast on weekdays, in addition to producing several hours a day of local talk shows (such as &quot;The Joe Franklin Show&quot;, &quot;Straight Talk&quot; and public affairs shows such as &quot;Meet the Mayors&quot;, titles that were shared by other RKO General television stations). WOR-TV also aired Spanish-language telenovelas on weekdays in the early 1970s, such as the Argentinian-Peruvian co-production &quot;Nino, las cosas simples de la vida&quot;.

Later in the 1970s, WOR-TV looked towards the United Kingdom for alternative offerings. On September 6, 1976, WOR-TV offered a week of programs from Thames Television during prime time; many of these shows had never before been seen on American television, including the first U.S. telecasts of &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot;, the Quentin Crisp biographical film &quot;The Naked Civil Servant&quot;, and an airing of an episode of &quot;Man About the House&quot;, which would be adapted by ABC as &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; the following year. WOR-TV also aired episodes of the ITV musical drama &quot;Rock Follies&quot; and the BBC science-fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; during this period. On April 5, 1980, WOR-TV presented &quot;Japan Tonight!&quot;, a seven-hour block of programs from Japan&#x27;s Tokyo Broadcasting System, featuring shows that were either dubbed or subtitled in English. During this period, various sports telecasts aired on most nights in prime time, with feature films running on nights where sports did not air under the &quot;Million Dollar Movie&quot; banner.

In 1984, WOR-TV began moving classic sitcoms like &quot;Bewitched&quot;, &quot;Burns &amp; Allen&quot;, &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;, and others into its weekday lineup, focused slightly less on sports, and added more off network drama shows to the lineup. The station also pulled back religious programming as well, pushing it earlier in the morning. With the advent of cable and satellite-delivered television, independent stations were being uplinked for regional and national distribution, thus becoming &quot;superstations&quot;. In April 1979, Syracuse, New York-based Eastern Microwave, Inc. began distributing WOR-TV to cable and C-band satellite subscribers across the United States, joining WTBS (now WPCH-TV) in Atlanta and WGN-TV in Chicago as national superstations.

====Troubles with the FCC====
While WOR-TV was gaining national exposure, a battle for the station&#x27;s survival—and that of its owner—was well underway. In 1975, RKO applied for renewal of its license to operate WOR-TV. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) conditioned this renewal on that of its Boston sister station, WNAC-TV. In 1980, the FCC stripped RKO of WNAC-TV&#x27;s license due to a litany of offenses dating back to the 1960s, but ultimately because RKO had withheld evidence of corporate misconduct by General Tire. The decision meant that RKO lost WOR-TV&#x27;s license and that of Los Angeles sister station KHJ-TV. However, an appeals court ruled that the FCC had erred in tying WOR-TV and KHJ-TV&#x27;s renewals to WNAC-TV, and ordered new proceedings. RKO soon found itself under renewed pressure from the FCC, which began soliciting applications for all of the company&#x27;s broadcast licenses in February 1983.

====Move to New Jersey====

To buy itself some time, RKO (with the help of New Jersey senator Bill Bradley) persuaded the U.S. Congress to pass a law requiring the FCC to automatically renew the license of any VHF station that moved its license to a state not served by a commercial VHF station. New Jersey and Delaware were the only states not to be served by a commercial VHF station, and there were complaints for many years that New Jersey in particular had been &quot;underserved&quot; by VHF stations from the New York City and Philadelphia markets (New Jersey was left without any commercial VHF allocations located within the state due to the 1962 conversion of Newark&#x27;s channel 13 to a non-commercial outlet). Soon after this law took effect, RKO moved WOR-TV&#x27;s license to Secaucus, New Jersey ( west of Manhattan), on April 20, 1983. However, for all intents and purposes, it remained a New York City station. WOR radio had originally been licensed to Newark when it signed on in 1922; while it moved its studios across the Hudson River in 1926, it remained licensed in Newark until 1941.

One of the FCC&#x27;s conditions of renewing channel 9&#x27;s license required RKO to also move the station&#x27;s main studio to New Jersey. Three years after its city of license was moved to New Jersey, WOR-TV moved its operations to the newly built Nine Broadcast Plaza in Secaucus on January 13, 1986. The FCC also required channel 9 to increase its coverage of events on the New Jersey side of the market. One month later, the New Jersey State Senate petitioned the FCC to approve an extension of the channel 9 signal into southern New Jersey. Because of various other issues, one of which would be the fact that rights to most syndicated programs would interfere with the local broadcast rights to these shows on Philadelphia stations, the request was denied.

The move to New Jersey did little to relieve the regulatory pressure on RKO. Seeing the handwriting on the wall, RKO put channel 9 up for sale in 1985. Westinghouse Broadcasting, Chris-Craft Industries, and a joint venture of Cox Enterprises and MCA/Universal emerged as the leading suitors for WOR-TV; the station was sold to the Cox/MCA group in late 1986 for $387 million. Cox later withdrew the joint venture due to disagreements between the two firms on who would be responsible for running the station, leaving MCA to take sole ownership of WOR-TV on April 21, 1987. The sale came just in the nick of time for RKO: two months after MCA closed on the purchase, an administrative law judge recommended that RKO be forced out of broadcasting altogether due to a litany of misconduct. Eventually, WOR radio would be sold to Hartford, Connecticut-based Buckley Broadcasting, and WRKS-FM (now WEPN-FM) would go to Summit Broadcasting.

===As WWOR-TV (1987–present)===
====MCA/Pinelands/Chris-Craft/BHC era (1987–1995)====
Upon MCA taking control, channel 9 added an extra &quot;W&quot; to its call letters becoming WWOR-TV on April 29, 1987. MCA knew it had to change the call letters (due to FCC rules at the time that dictated that TV and radio stations in the same market, but with different ownership, had to use different call signs), but still wanted to trade on the 65-year heritage of the WOR calls in the New York area. Initially, the station&#x27;s programming stayed nearly the same, while the RKO-era &quot;dotted 9&quot; logo was replaced by a new &quot;red 9&quot;. MCA relaunched WWOR-TV that fall with a new, all-CGI look. The logo was replaced with a new &quot;Venetian-blinds 9&quot;; movie and special presentations were preceded by a new, more dramatic intro, while a new, three-pointed triangle was used in the main ident and in the first intro for &quot;The News at Ten&quot;, representing the Tri-State area. However, the RKO-era announcers stayed on, and all but six hours of programming per day remained the same. The station dropped most of its public affairs shows, &quot;Romper Room&quot; was cut back to a half-hour and moved to 6 am, all religious shows except for the Sunday Mass were dropped, cartoons were added to the station&#x27;s morning lineup and stronger syndicated shows were added in the early evenings. Late morning timeslots consisted of classic sitcoms and afternoons continued to consist of game shows, drama series and movies. Programs seen in both dayparts were largely those held over from the station&#x27;s final years under RKO ownership. Later that fall, in prime time, the &quot;Million Dollar Movie&quot; was relegated to weekends in favor of Morton Downey Jr.&#x27;s controversial new talk show, while the 8 p.m. newscast was moved to 10 p.m. and expanded to one hour (to emphasize this, it was briefly titled &quot;The News at Ten&quot;; this did not last long and by 1988, it became &quot;Channel 9 News&quot;).

The overhaul continued in 1988 and 1989, when it added the locally produced kids&#x27; show &quot;Steampipe Alley&quot;, and more evening sitcoms, including among others, reruns of top-rated sitcoms &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; and &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot;, as well as MCA/Universal-sourced programming including &quot;Kate &amp; Allie&quot;, &quot;The Munsters Today&quot;, &quot;My Secret Identity&quot;, and &quot;The New Lassie&quot;. WWOR-TV also borrowed program formats used on the Westinghouse stations: a short-lived version of &quot;Evening Magazine&quot; aired in prime time, and a locally produced talk show called &quot;People Are Talking&quot; ran at 11 am. That show would later change its title to &quot;9 Broadcast Plaza&quot; (named after the station&#x27;s Secaucus studio location), and then to &quot;The Richard Bey Show&quot; for syndication. During this time, the studios were a hotbed of production, including the aforementioned local shows, &quot;The Morton Downey Jr. Show&quot; (which was nationally syndicated by then-sister firm MCA TV), and &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; hosted by New York radio personality Howard Stern from 1990 to 1992. Because of this, the station&#x27;s newscasts had to be moved to the newsroom, and it would not return to having its own set until joining UPN.

In 1989, the FCC passed the &quot;Syndicated Exclusivity Rights&quot; rule (or &quot;SyndEx&quot;) into law—which required cable providers to black out certain syndicated programs on out-of-market stations where local broadcasters claim the rights to air in a particular market. To lighten the burden on cable providers as a result of this law, Eastern Microwave acquired the rights to programs to which no station owned exclusive in-market rights. It then broadcast this programming on WWOR&#x27;s national feed to replace programs that could not be aired nationally. Most of the programs came from the Universal and Quinn Martin libraries, along with some shows from &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;″s television service, as well as some holdover shows that had aired on the local New York feed before the SyndEx law&#x27;s passage. Eastern Microwave would eventually launch a separate feed for satellite and cable subscribers on January 1, 1990, called the &quot;WWOR EMI Service&quot;. By the early 1990s, WWOR and WPIX began to be replaced on many cable systems by the superstation feed of WGN-TV, which also launched an alternate feed for nationwide viewers in response to SyndEx regulations.

During autumn 1990, WWOR-TV began branding itself as &quot;Universal 9&quot; on-air, highlighting its association with the MCA/Universal entertainment empire. However, later that same autumn, MCA&#x27;s ownership of the station ended with the company&#x27;s purchase by Osaka, Japan–based Matsushita Electric (now Panasonic Corporation). Since FCC regulations do not allow foreign companies to own more than a 25 percent interest in a television station, MCA spun off the assets of WWOR-TV into a new company called Pinelands, Incorporated on January 1, 1991. Universal would re-enter the New York television market after it merged with NBC to form NBCUniversal in 2004, acquiring the network&#x27;s flagship station, WNBC, in the process. WWOR partnered with KCOP-TV and MCA TV Entertainment on a two night programming block, Hollywood Premiere Network starting in October 1990, the month before Matsushita&#x27;s purchase of MCA. Channel 9 also aired select episodes of the Australian soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot; from mid-June to mid-September 1991.

On March 30, 1992, Disney Studios agreed to sell KCAL-TV (the erstwhile KHJ-TV) to Pinelands, Inc. for a 45 percent ownership stake in Pinelands, so as to have interest in TV stations in the two largest markets, New York and Los Angeles, allowing for increased original programming. Instead, Pinelands agreed to an unsolicited bid in May from Chris-Craft Industries&#x27; BHC Communications subsidiary, thus ending the planned business merger with Disney&#x27;s KCAL, making WWOR a sister station to Chris-Craft/BHC&#x27;s KCOP in the process. Disney later acquired WABC-TV as part of its larger purchase of Capital Cities/ABC Inc. in 1996.

In 1993, BHC aligned its independent stations with the Prime Time Entertainment Network. WWOR carried Spelling Premiere Network at its launch in August 1994.

====UPN affiliation (1995–2006)====
In 1994, Chris-Craft and its broadcasting subsidiary, BHC Communications, and Viacom&#x27;s newly acquired subsidiary Paramount Pictures partnered to form the United Paramount Network (UPN), which debuted on January 16, 1995. In 1996, Viacom bought 50 percent of UPN from Chris-Craft. At the network&#x27;s launch, WWOR-TV was UPN&#x27;s &quot;flagship&quot; station. However, UPN did not allow WWOR&#x27;s superstation feed to carry the network&#x27;s programs nationally (in contrast, The WB allowed WGN-TV to air network programming on cable feed during that network&#x27;s first four years on the air). In the 1990s, the station continued with a large amount of younger-skewing talk shows, reality programming, some sitcoms in evenings, and syndicated cartoons during the morning hours.

On January 1, 1997, with only a month&#x27;s advance warning, Advance Entertainment Corporation, which had purchased the satellite distribution rights to WWOR from Eastern Microwave a few months earlier, stopped uplinking the national version. The EMI Service&#x27;s transponder space was sold to Discovery Communications for the then six-month-old Animal Planet. Amid outcries from satellite dish owners, National Programming Service, LLC uplinked the station again exclusively for satellite subscribers. The national feed was once again the same feed as the New York market feed. NPS dropped WWOR in 1999, in favor of Pax TV, but Dish Network still carries the New York feed of WWOR as part of its superstations package except in areas where the local UPN (and later, MyNetworkTV) affiliate invoked SyndEx to block the feed.

In 2000, Chris-Craft announced that it was selling its television stations. It was believed that Viacom, which had purchased Chris-Craft&#x27;s half of the network that year not long after buying CBS—gaining full control of UPN (and effectively stripping WWOR of its status as an owned-and-operated station of the network in the process), would buy the stations. However, Viacom lost its bid for the group to the Fox Television Stations subsidiary of News Corporation on August 12, 2000, in a $5.5 billion deal, making WWOR-TV a sister station to longtime rival WNYW—creating a unique situation in which the largest affiliate station of one network was owned by the operator of another network. While some cast doubt on UPN&#x27;s future, Fox quickly cut a new affiliation deal with UPN.

On September 11, 2001, the transmitter facilities of WWOR-TV and eight other New York City television stations and several radio stations were destroyed when two hijacked airplanes crashed into and destroyed the World Trade Center towers. With its broadcast signal shut down, WWOR fed its signal directly to cable and satellite systems, running wall-to-wall coverage of the attacks from CNN and later the Fox News Channel. The station&#x27;s website received unprecedented traffic but remained available, including streaming video of pre-recorded newscasts. Channel 9 resumed regular programming on September 17, 2001. The station installed a new transmitter at the Empire State Building (where the transmitter had been based prior to 1975) along with most of the other major New York City stations, until moving back to One World Trade Center in 2018. The attacks delayed the closing of the Chris-Craft deal for several days.

Fox began integrating the operations of its two stations soon afterwards. Also on September 17, 2001, the Fox Kids weekday afternoon block moved to WWOR-TV from WNYW, while the station also ran UPN&#x27;s &quot;Disney&#x27;s One Too&quot; during the morning hours. Channel 9 was New York City&#x27;s last remaining commercial station to air children&#x27;s programming on both weekday mornings and afternoons, an ironic twist from 20 years earlier; however, Fox later discontinued the Fox Kids weekday block in January 2002 while UPN ended its cartoon block in August 2003, WWOR then picked up syndicated cartoons in the fall of 2003 in the 7 to 9 a.m. slot (and later until 8 a.m.), before dropping them in 2006. This made WWOR-TV the last commercial station to run any cartoons on weekdays. This was the second time the station phased out cartoons in favor of mandated children&#x27;s programming which WWOR has aired in its early years. WNYW also placed several of its underperforming syndicated shows on WWOR, and cherry-picked channel 9&#x27;s stronger programs for broadcast on channel 5&#x27;s schedule. Currently, WWOR offers several &quot;double-runs&quot; of WNYW&#x27;s programs, but the two stations&#x27; individual schedules (outside of network programming) are much different.

In 2004, Fox Television Stations announced that it would shut down WWOR-TV&#x27;s Secaucus facilities and move its operations to WNYW&#x27;s facility at the Fox Television Center in Manhattan. WNYW had already been handling some of WWOR&#x27;s internal operations for some time before then. Fox planned to keep 9 Broadcast Plaza as a satellite relay station for WNYW and WWOR (the facility also performed master control operations for Baltimore&#x27;s MyNetworkTV affiliate WUTB until locally based Sinclair Broadcast Group purchased WUTB from Fox in 2013). While some office functions were merged, plans for a full move to Manhattan were scuttled later that year due to pressure from New Jersey Congressman Steve Rothman (whose congressional district included Secaucus) and Senator Frank Lautenberg. The two lawmakers contended that if WWOR moved its operations back across the Hudson, it would be violating its conditions of license. According to Rothman, WWOR&#x27;s license specifically required that its main studio be based in New Jersey. Even without this to consider, a full merger of WNYW and WWOR&#x27;s operations would have likely resulted in channel 9&#x27;s news department being downsized to the point that it would not be able to adequately cover news events focused on New Jersey, if not shut down altogether. As mentioned above, WWOR&#x27;s license requires it to emphasize coverage of events on the New Jersey side of the market.

====MyNetworkTV affiliation (2006–present)====
On February 22, 2006, News Corporation announced the launch of a new &quot;sixth&quot; network called MyNetworkTV, which would be operated by Fox Television Stations and its syndication division 20th Television. MyNetworkTV was created to compete against another upstart network that would launch at the same time that September, The CW (an amalgamated network that was originally consisted primarily of UPN and The WB&#x27;s higher-rated programs) as well as to give UPN and WB stations that were not mentioned as becoming CW affiliates another option besides converting to independent stations. WPIX, which had been a WB affiliate since 1995, was announced as The CW&#x27;s New York City area affiliate as part of a 10-year affiliation deal with channel 11&#x27;s parent company Tribune Broadcasting. The network&#x27;s officials were on record as preferring the &quot;strongest&quot; stations among The WB and UPN&#x27;s affiliates, none of which included any of Fox&#x27;s UPN-affiliated stations – locally, WPIX had been well ahead of WWOR-TV in overall viewership for some time.

The day after the announcement of The CW&#x27;s formation (January 25, 2006), Fox removed all network references from the on-air branding of its UPN affiliates, and stopped promoting UPN programs altogether. WWOR accordingly changed its branding from &quot;UPN 9&quot; to &quot;WWOR 9&quot; (although the station was referred to on-air as simply &quot;9&quot;), and altered its logo to only feature the boxed &quot;9&quot; with a small red strip on the left side. WWOR had just introduced a new graphics package for its newscasts and a revised logo almost three weeks prior, with UPN branding.

With the impending switch to MyNetworkTV, channel 9&#x27;s on-air branding was changed to &quot;My9&quot; beginning on April 4, with the new brand being introduced during Nets and Yankees game telecasts; two weeks later on April 17, WWOR incorporated the &quot;My9&quot; name into the station&#x27;s remaining branding elements, including news. On June 2, WWOR changed its logo again, this time adopting one similar to the MyNetworkTV logo presented at the launch announcement. Despite MyNetworkTV&#x27;s announcement that its launch date would be September 5, 2006, UPN continued to broadcast on stations across the country until September 15, 2006. While some UPN affiliates that switched to MyNetworkTV aired the final two weeks of UPN programming outside its regular prime time period, WWOR and the rest of the network&#x27;s Fox-owned affiliates dropped UPN&#x27;s programming entirely on August 31, 2006.

WWOR-TV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 9, at 11:59 p.m. on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The last program to air on analog was an episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 38, using virtual channel 9.

On October 15, 2010, News Corporation pulled WWOR, WNYW, WTXF (South Jersey only), Fox Business, Fox Deportes, and Nat Geo Wild from Cablevision systems in the New York City Tri-state area, due to a dispute between Fox and Cablevision in which Cablevision claimed that News Corporation demanded $150 million a year to renew its carriage of 12 Fox-owned channels. News Corporation responded to Cablevision&#x27;s claims. Cablevision offered to submit to binding arbitration on October 14, 2010, though News Corporation rejected Cablevision&#x27;s proposal, stating that it would &quot;reward Cablevision for refusing to negotiate fairly&quot;. WWOR, WNYW, WTXF and the three cable channels were restored on October 30, 2010, when Cablevision and News Corporation struck a new carriage deal.

On November 3, 2011, Fox Television Stations signed an affiliation agreement with Bounce TV, a subchannel network aimed at African American audiences, to carry the service on the second or third digital subchannels of its MyNetworkTV-affiliated stations.

On January 7, 2014, WWOR applied for a digital fill-in translator on channel 34 from the Armstrong Tower and licensed to Alpine, New Jersey, that will serve the northern viewing area.

=====2007–2014 license renewal and objections=====
Before August 2014, the station awaited renewal of its broadcast license since 2007, the same year that two petitions to deny the license&#x27;s renewal were submitted. According to claims from U.S. Senator Frank Lautenberg and media observers, who filed a complaint with the FCC in November 2009, WWOR-TV&#x27;s performance was &quot;clearly inadequate to meet its public interest obligations&quot; and he questioned the truthfulness of its application. The station was also accused of misrepresenting the number of station employees based in Secaucus, and failing to report a reduction in local news coverage.

On February 17, 2011, the FCC opened an investigation against then-WWOR parent News Corporation to determine whether the company misrepresented information about WWOR-TV&#x27;s news operations and programming during the station&#x27;s license review. News Corporation would have been stripped of its licenses to operate both WWOR-TV and sister station WNYW, as well as facing other penalties if found guilty of any wrongdoing (News Corporation spun off both stations and its other U.S. television properties to 21st Century Fox in June 2013). Legal representation hired by WWOR stated that the station had fulfilled its commitments. In December 2012, Lautenberg called for an investigation into the potential relaxing of FCC rules regarding ownership consolidation within media markets stating that News Corporation&#x27;s co-ownership of WNYW and the &quot;New York Post&quot; &quot;has not served New Jersey well&quot;. Following Lautenberg&#x27;s June 3, 2013, death and the subsequent announcement of the WWOR news department&#x27;s closure one month later, fellow New Jersey senator Robert Menendez took up the cause, saying it was increasingly critical with WWOR dropping their newscast and going with the outside &quot;Chasing New Jersey&quot; for coverage of state issues for the FCC to make a ruling on WWOR&#x27;s license and their fulfillment of their obligations. Rep. Frank Pallone also called for the revocation of WWOR&#x27;s license. In November 2013 the New Jersey Legislature passed a resolution urging the FCC to revoke the station&#x27;s license.

In March 2014, New Jersey&#x27;s senior United States senator, Bob Menendez, wrote to the FCC asking for swift action to determine if the station had been fulfilling its licensing requirements.

New Jersey is one of the most densely populated states in the country, but because of its location between New York City and Philadelphia, does not have a designated market area (DMA)...WWOR is required to fill this gap by operating in the state of New Jersey to the benefit of all residents. Unfortunately, concerns have mounted that the operations of WWOR have not fulfilled these requirements.

On August 8, 2014, the FCC renewed WWOR&#x27;s license, dismissing all of the objecting petitions, though the permanent waiver allowing Fox Television Stations to run both WNYW and WWOR along with 21st Century Fox&#x27;s shared ownership with the &quot;New York Post&quot; was denied; a temporary waiver was granted.

=====2018 license renewal and full consolidation with WNYW=====
In January 2018, Senators Menendez and Cory Booker said the station had &quot;failed to live up to its federal mandate&quot; to cover New Jersey news. Despite this, the station&#x27;s license was renewed by the FCC on July 12, 2018, for a new ten-year cycle without objection; Booker and Menendez have continued to push for revocation of the station&#x27;s license.

One month after the license renewal, Fox Television Stations sold 9 Broadcast Plaza back to Hartz Mountain Industries (which developed the Secaucus office park WWOR-TV&#x27;s facility was built in) for $4.05 million, several months after the repeal of the FCC&#x27;s Main Studio Rule which mandated continued operation of WWOR from Secaucus. Since that point, WWOR&#x27;s operations have been consolidated with WNYW in Manhattan, and the building, which remains standing as of 2024, has had all WWOR-related television equipment removed.

==Programming==
===Sports programming===
As an independent station, channel 9&#x27;s schedule was heavy on sports programming. Early in its history, WOR-TV established itself as the home of National League baseball in New York, carrying Brooklyn Dodgers (beginning in 1950) and New York Giants games (beginning in 1951) until both teams moved to California (Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively) following the 1957 season. From 1958 to 1961, the station aired a limited schedule of Philadelphia Phillies games, consisting of matchups against the Dodgers and Giants. In 1962, WOR-TV gained broadcast rights to the New York Mets, the National League&#x27;s new expansion team. The partnership between the station and the team would last through the 1998 season, after which the Mets moved their broadcasts to WPIX, replacing Yankee telecasts on the station.

Channel 9 acquired rights to the NHL&#x27;s New York Rangers and the NBA&#x27;s New York Knicks in 1965, holding onto both teams until 1989 (when the two teams&#x27; television rights moved exclusively to cable on the MSG Network). Other sports teams that have been broadcast on the station include the New York Islanders, New Jersey Devils, New York/New Jersey Nets, local college basketball, and the New York Cosmos. The station also carried syndicated professional wrestling programming from the WWWF/WWF, and later World Championship Wrestling.

Except for the Mets (for whom [W]WOR did cover a large number of home games), WWOR&#x27;s pro sports coverage mainly featured away games, although in the mid-1960s, the station taped a handful of Rangers&#x27; Saturday afternoon home games for broadcast that evening. One such game, on November 27, 1965, against the Chicago Blackhawks, is said to be the first NHL game to ever be broadcast in color.

WWOR-TV also broadcast an infamous interview between Mike Tyson and the station&#x27;s then-sports anchor Russ Salzberg in January 1999, whose intent was to discuss Tyson&#x27;s then comeback fight against Francois Botha; Tyson shouted several expletives, made threats and told the audience to switch the station off. This prompted Salzberg to abruptly end the interview, giving Tyson a half-hearted wish of luck on his upcoming fight. Tyson responded by telling Salzberg to &quot;fuck off&quot;.

In late September 2001, WWOR-TV aired several New York Yankees baseball games that were originally scheduled to air on WNYW. In 2005, channel 9 picked up Yankees games on a full-time basis, with the broadcasts being produced by the YES Network. In 2015, Yankees games moved back to WPIX after ending a ten-year deal.

WWOR has sometimes aired New York Giants pre-season games due to commitments by WNBC to air network coverage of the Summer Olympics as has occurred in 2012 and 2016. WWOR has also simulcast ESPN-produced &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; games in which the Giants or Jets were involved (WABC-TV holds right of first refusal on local &quot;MNF&quot; broadcasts as a corporate sibling to ESPN, but often exercises that right to air ABC&#x27;s &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;), as well as such games during the early existence of the NFL Network; WWOR was scheduled to be the local outlet for the December 30, 2007, Giants/Patriots game, but with the Patriots on the verge of an undefeated regular season, and NFL Network having minimal cable carriage at the time, the game ended up being simulcast nationally on CBS and NBC in addition to WWOR.

As a sister station to WNYW, WWOR has sometimes aired Fox sports programming while WNYW aired local programming. This was the case on September 11, 2021, when WNYW aired local 9/11 memorial programming while WWOR aired a nationally televised &quot;Fox College Football&quot; game. This was the case again on September 21, 2023, when WNYW aired a &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; game between the New York Giants and the San Francisco 49ers, while WWOR aired a locally televised &quot;Baseball Night in America&quot; game between the New York Mets and the Philadelphia Phillies (coincidentally, as previously mentioned, WWOR aired Mets games from 1962 to 1998).

Currently, WWOR airs select Brooklyn Nets games produced by YES Network whenever YES broadcasts a Yankees game during the same time period. In 2023, two New York Liberty games also aired on the station, including one broadcast nationally on ABC due to WABC-TV televising the NYC Pride March. On November 18, 2023, WWOR aired a Seton Hall men&#x27;s basketball game produced by &quot;Fox College Hoops&quot;.

On March 12, 2024, it was announced that WWOR and WNYW would become the new broadcast partner for the New York Liberty.

In February 2025, WWOR will air matches from the Coachella Valley Invitational preseason tournament featuring New York City FC and the New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer.

===Newscasts===

As most of New York&#x27;s independent stations were during the 1960s and 1970s, WOR-TV was a very minor player in the area of local news. Before 1971, the station did not carry any live news programming, but had an early morning audio-only newscast read by the on-duty staff announcer over the station logo. In 1971, WOR-TV launched its first live newscast, the &quot;News at Noon&quot;, which was also the first midday newscast in the New York City market. Tom Dunn, previously of WABC, was the lead anchor. In 1983, following the move to New Jersey, channel 9 launched a nightly 8 p.m. newscast called &quot;News 9: Primetime&quot;. After the MCA takeover in 1987, the 8 p.m. newscast was moved two hours later to 10 pm, and expanded to an hour (placing it in direct competition with newscasts in that timeslot airing on WPIX and eventual sister station WNYW). Dunn opted to leave WWOR that summer, with his last newscast for channel 9 airing on June 19; he was replaced as lead anchor by Van Hackett, formerly of KTRK-TV in Houston. The noon program, which was later merged into &quot;9 Broadcast Plaza&quot;, ended in 1993 and was replaced with &quot;The Ricki Lake Show&quot;.

Despite the presence of its sister station WNYW&#x27;s long-running and successful news program at 10 pm, WWOR-TV was able to compete in that same timeslot following Fox&#x27;s acquisition of channel 9 simply because both stations use separate studios. As opposed to the model of most television station duopolies, WWOR-TV and sister station WNYW operated news departments that were technically separate from one another: WWOR operated its news department from the station&#x27;s Secaucus studios, while WNYW runs theirs from the Fox Television Center in Manhattan, allowing the two stations to maintain their own on-air identities and offer individual local news programs simultaneously. However, the two stations shared a fairly significant amount in regards to news coverage, with some staffers having switched from one station to the other. Both stations maintained their own primary on-air personalities (such as news anchors and reporters) that only appeared on one station. WWOR&#x27;s newscasts also focused a larger proportion of their stories on New Jersey issues, a condition the station had adhered to since its license was transferred from New York City to Secaucus.

On July 13, 2009, the 10 p.m. newscast was moved to 11 p.m. and was shortened to a half-hour due to budget cuts. In addition, weekend newscasts and a Sunday night sports highlight program were canceled. On June 27, 2011, WWOR-TV returned the newscast to its previous 10 p.m. timeslot and retitled it &quot;The Ten O&#x27;Clock News&quot;; it remained a half-hour in length and continued to air on weeknights only. On September 10, 2012, WWOR-TV began broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition.

Sports director Russ Salzberg, anchor Brenda Blackmon, and reporter Brenda Flanagan were the station&#x27;s longest-tenured on-air personalities. Flanagan worked for the station starting in 1983, while Salzberg and Blackmon joined WWOR in 1988 and 1992, respectively. In areas of central New Jersey, where the New York and Philadelphia markets overlap with one another, both WWOR and WNYW shared resources with their Philadelphia sister station WTXF-TV. The stations shared reporters for stories occurring in New Jersey counties served by both markets.

The 10 p.m. newscast was canceled following its July 2, 2013, broadcast (ending 42 years of newscast production by channel 9 and 30 years of prime time newscasts); in its place, the station introduced &quot;Chasing New Jersey&quot; (which was later renamed to &quot;Chasing News&quot;), a nightly New Jersey-focused news magazine with a &quot;fast-paced&quot; format, on July 8. The program, which was produced by Fairfax Productions (a production company led by the vice president and general manager of Philadelphia sister station WTXF-TV) from a studio in Trenton and hosted by Bill Spadea, was also seen on WTXF as a lead-in to its morning newscast. With the end of WWOR&#x27;s newscast, Brenda Blackmon was reassigned to produce and host news specials for the station (although she would leave for WPIX in 2016, while other members of the on-air staff were offered new roles (including at WNYW). Despite the closure of WWOR&#x27;s news department, the station&#x27;s Secaucus facilities remained operational until 2018, when the repeal of the FCC Main Studio Rule allowed the full consolidation of WWOR&#x27;s operations with WNYW. &quot;Chasing News&quot; was canceled in June 2020, leaving WWOR without any news programs.

On August 12, 2024, WWOR began airing a weeknight rebroadcast of WNYW&#x27;s 6 p.m. news at 8 p.m.

<text>&quot;Menshen&quot;, or door gods, are divine guardians of doors and gates in Chinese folk religions, used to protect against evil influences or to encourage the entrance of positive ones. They began as the divine pair Shenshu () and Yulü () under the Han, but the deified generals Qin Shubao () and Yuchi Gong () have been more popular since the Tang. In cases where a door god is affixed to a single door, Wei Zheng or Zhong Kui is commonly used.

==History==
The gates and doors of Chinese houses have long received special ritual attention. Sacrifices to a door spirit are recorded as early as the &quot;Book of Rites&quot;. By the Han, this spirit had become the two gods Shenshu and Yulü, whose names or images were painted into peachwood and attached to doors. When the Emperor Taizong of the Tang was being plagued by nightmares, he ordered portraits of his generals Qin Shubao and Yuchi Gong to be affixed to gates. They eventually came to be considered divine protectors, replacing Shentu and Yulü and remaining the most common door gods to the present day. Qin and Yuchi, along with various other deified military leaders, make up a class of intended to ward off evil spirits and bad influences. A separate group of scholars make up a class of intended to attract blessings and good fortune. Some deities are also thought to have guardians who serve a similar role at their temples, such as Mazu&#x27;s companions Qianliyan and Shunfeng&#x27;er.

==Legends==
The 10th chapter of the Chinese novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot; includes an account of the origin of door gods. In it, the Dragon King of the Jing River disguised himself as a human to outsmart the fortune teller Yuan Shoucheng. Since he was able to control the weather, he made a bet with Yuan about Chang&#x27;an&#x27;s forecast for the next day. He was nonplussed, however, when he received an order from the Jade Emperor telling him to give the city precisely the weather Yuan had predicted. The Dragon King preferred to win the bet and disregarded the order, going to Yuan to gloat the next day. Yuan remained calm and revealed that he had known the Dragon King&#x27;s identity all along. Moreover, since the dragon had been so arrogant as to disregard an order from the Jade Emperor, his doom would be short in coming. The dragon was shocked to see his disobedience known and immediately pleaded with Yuan to save him. Yuan let him know that the Jade Emperor would send Wei Zheng—a senior minister from the court of the Emperor Taizong of the Tang—to execute him at noon the following day. He told him his best course of action was to ask Taizong for help and, taking pity on the Dragon King, the emperor agreed to save him. In order to do so, the emperor summoned Wei Zheng to play go with him in the morning. He endeavored to keep Wei from leaving until after noon, preventing him from carrying out the Jade Emperor&#x27;s order, and was delighted when Wei grew so tired with the long game that he fell asleep. A little while later, however, the Great Ancestor was told that a dragon&#x27;s head had fallen from the sky. Wei awoke and told him that his spirit had left his body during his nap and gone to Heaven to carry out the Jade Emperor&#x27;s order. The annoyed spirit of the Dragon King then haunted the Great Ancestor each night until his generals Qin Shubao and Yuchi Gong volunteered to stand guard at his door. The emperor enjoyed his peaceful sleep but did not want to continue bothering his two generals. In their place, he had artists paint their portraits and paste them to the doors. This was then copied by his subjects.

==Architecture==
In modern use, door gods are usually printed images which are pasted to paired doors. They are usually replaced every Chinese New Year. Occasionally, they are sculpted in relief or placed as statues to either side of a door. The figures should face each other; it is considered bad luck to place them back to back.

==Worship==
In ancient China, there was a ritual for a sacrifice to the door spirit of a wealthy home recorded in the &quot;Book of Rites&quot;. In modern China, door gods do not make up a formal element of Taoism and are included as traditional decorations or as nods to popular superstition. There are, however, some deities worshipped for other reasons—including the Azure Dragon, the White Tiger, and Mazu&#x27;s companions Qianliyan and Shunfeng&#x27;er—who also serve as door gods at Taoist temples.

=== Korea ===

Door gods are called Munsin in Korea.

==List==
The following persons, some of whom are mythological figures, are known to have been worshipped as door gods.

<text>Lewis Robert Wasserman (March 22, 1913 – June 3, 2002) was an American businessman and talent agent, described as &quot;the last of the legendary movie moguls&quot; and &quot;arguably the most powerful and influential Hollywood titan in the four decades after World War II&quot;. His career spanned nearly eight decades from the 1920s to the 2000s; he started working as a cinema usher before dropping out of high school, rose to become the president of MCA Inc. and led its takeover of Universal Pictures, during which time Wasserman &quot;brought about changes in virtually every aspect of show business&quot;. In 1995, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton. Several years later, he spoke of his ongoing work at Universal to &quot;Variety&quot;, saying, &quot;I am under contract here for the rest of my life, and I don&#x27;t think they would throw me out of my office—my name is on the building.&quot;

==Career==

===Early life===
Wasserman was born to a Jewish family in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of Isaac Wasserman and Minnie Chernick, both emigrants from Russia. He began his show business career as an usher in a Cleveland theater in 1933. He later became a booking agent for the Music Corporation of America (MCA), founded by Jules Stein.

===Hollywood career===

Under Wasserman, MCA branched out into representing actors and actresses in addition to musicians and in the process created the star system, which drove up prices for studios. MCA struggled to gain ground in Hollywood since major agencies like those belonging to Charles Feldman, Myron Selznick, and Leland Hayward had already grabbed up most of the major talent. However, in the mid-1940s, when it purchased Hayward&#x27;s agency, MCA finally gained bargaining leverage with the studios. As an agency, Wasserman&#x27;s MCA came to dominate Hollywood, representing such stars as Bette Davis and Ronald Reagan.

Wasserman was an influential player and fundraiser in the Democratic Party, but was also a lifelong and instrumental advocate, mentor, and close friend of Reagan&#x27;s. The Newsmeat Power Rankings identify Wasserman and his close friend Jack Valenti as two of the top five &quot;most famous and powerful Americans whose campaign contributions result most often in victory.&quot;

At MCA, Wasserman expanded upon a business practice known as film packaging, a process established by earlier agents like Feldman and Selznick. Since studios reduced output after World War II, they let more actors out of long-term contracts, and big agencies like MCA could then negotiate stronger terms for their clients. Agents like Wasserman would pitch packages, for example a writer client, director client, and actor or actress, to the studios who then needed only to finance it. Therefore, in some respects, agencies began to do the job previously done by the studios – namely, assembling films.

Wasserman expanded on practices established by earlier agents. For example, Feldman and Selznick realized in the late 1930s that an actor could pay much less tax by turning himself into a corporation. The corporation, which would employ the actor, would own part of a motion picture in which the actor appeared, and all monies would accrue to the corporation, which was taxed at a much lower rate than was personal income.

Wasserman used this tax avoidance scheme with actor James Stewart, beginning with the Anthony Mann western &quot;Winchester &#x27;73&quot; (1950). This marked the first time an onscreen talent ever received &quot;points in the film&quot; – a business tactic that skyrocketed after Wasserman&#x27;s negotiation and Stewart&#x27;s ensuing success.
Following the rising postwar popularity of television and the resulting near bankruptcy of many studios, Wasserman purchased Universal Studios and Decca Records in 1962 and merged them with MCA. In 1966, he singlehandedly installed Jack Valenti as head of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). Together they orchestrated and controlled much of how Hollywood operated, and was allowed to do business, for the next several decades. Wasserman ran the combined company for nearly 30 years before selling it to Japanese consumer electronics conglomerate Matsushita Electric in 1990. 

According to the 2003 book &quot;When Hollywood Had a King: The Reign of Lew Wasserman, Who Leveraged Talent into Power and Influence&quot;, Wasserman was interested in acquiring The Walt Disney Company in 1984, and this deal came within inches of actually happening:

As a tribute to the man who essentially built the park, the New York section of Universal Studios Florida possesses a statue of Wasserman with an accompanying plaque. It is routinely decorated for various events, such as Halloween Horror Nights, and is removed for the Macy&#x27;s Holiday Parade, as to not interfere with the various balloons.

==Political connections==

According to Dan Moldea&#x27;s survey &quot;Dark Victory: Ronald Reagan, MCA, and the Mob&quot; (which inspired Clara and Julia Kuperberg&#x27;s 2017 TV documentary &quot;Ronald Reagan: un Président Sur Mesure&quot;), Wasserman was the link between the Mafia, the Hollywood film industry and Reagan, who obtained very lucrative deals as an actor with Wasserman as his agent. By 1947, just after Al Capone died, and still with the help of his alliance with the underworld, Wasserman was instrumental in helping Reagan to become president of the Screen Actors Guild, which kicked-off Reagan&#x27;s rise to power. Reagan allowed MCA to work both as a producer as well as an agent, which enabled the Mafia to earn a huge income.

==Last years==
In 1993, Wasserman created Universal CityWalk and made numerous, substantial changes to the Universal City area. Wasserman pocketed an estimated $350 million from the sale of MCA and remained as manager, but with vastly diminished power and influence, until Seagram bought controlling interest in 1995, which then resulted in his role becoming even more marginalized. Wasserman served on the board of directors until 1998. On September 29, 1995, Wasserman was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton. In 1996, he was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.

Wasserman died of complications from a stroke in Beverly Hills in 2002 and was interred in Hillside Memorial Park in Culver City. He was honored posthumously with the 2,349th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on October 5, 2007.

==Personal life==
Wasserman was married to Edith &quot;Edie&quot; Beckerman, who was also Jewish. They had one child, a daughter, Lynne Kay Wasserman. Lynne married MCA agent Ron Leif with whom she had a daughter, Carol Ann Leif; they later divorced. In 1970, Lynne married stockbroker Jack Meyerowitz. They changed their name to Myers and had a son, Casey Wasserman. This marriage also ended in divorce. Casey carries on the family name in the agency business, the Wasserman Media Group (WMG), which he started in 1998. He is also acting president and chief executive officer of the Wasserman Foundation, a charitable organization founded by the Wassermans in 1952 in Beverly Hills. Actress Jamie Lee Curtis was his goddaughter.

Wasserman&#x27;s granddaughter, Carol Ann Leif, is a stand-up comedian.

Wasserman&#x27;s widow, Edie, died on August 18, 2011, at the age of 95.

==In popular culture==
Wasserman was portrayed by David Eisner in the CBS film &quot;Martin and Lewis&quot; (2002), by Stewart Bick in the TV film &quot;The Reagans&quot; (2003), and by Michael Stuhlbarg in &quot;Hitchcock&quot; (2012). Wasserman was also the subject of the biography film &quot;The Last Mogul&quot; (2005).

<text>Heredity is a 1985 album by Rational Youth, now down to singer Tracy Howe with numerous studio musicians. In retrospect, Howe was less than happy with the album, especially with the fact that it looked like he was using the Rational Youth name as a flag of convenience for a solo album. The use of the Rational Youth name was suggested by Capitol Records, to which Howe acquiesced. The album, while successful, appealed to a different audience than earlier Rational Youth fans, confusing the latter. To date, the album has never seen a CD release.

&quot;Heredity&quot; was produced by Howe together with former Klaatu member Dee Long assisted by Duran Duran producer John Jones

<doc id="1340201" wikidata="Q1288535" url="?curid=1340201" title="Storegga Slide">
<text>The three Storegga Slides () are amongst the largest known submarine landslides. They occurred at the edge of Norway&#x27;s continental shelf in the Norwegian Sea, approximately 6225–6170 BCE. The collapse involved an estimated length of coastal shelf, with a total volume of of debris, which caused a paleotsunami in the North Atlantic Ocean.

==Description==

Storegga (Norwegian: &quot;Great Edge&quot;) is located at the edge of Norway&#x27;s continental shelf in the Norwegian Sea, north-west of the Møre coast. In around 6200 BCE, structural failures of the shelf caused three underwater landslides, which triggered very large tsunamis in the North Atlantic Ocean. The collapses involved an estimated length of coastal shelf, with a total volume of of debris. 

Based on carbon dating of plant material recovered from sediment deposited by the tsunamis, the latest incident occurred around 6225–6170 BCE. In Scotland, traces of the subsequent tsunami have been recorded, with deposited sediment being discovered in Montrose Basin and the Firth of Forth up to inland and above current normal tide levels.

==Possible mechanism==
The triggering mechanism is thought to have been an earthquake that induced a catastrophic expansion of methane clathrate, a solid compound consisting of large amounts of methane suspended within a crystal water structure that forms in deep oceans under extremely high pressure. If removed from a high-pressure, low-temperature environment, one cubic metre of solid methane clathrate expands to 164 cubic metres of gaseous methane. If such an expansion occurred, it may have weakened the integrity of the surrounding rock sufficiently to trigger the slide.

A second theory states that over time, streams from melting glaciers had carried trillions of tons of sediment to the edge of the continental shelf, where it accumulated in many layers. In this case, a trigger such as an earthquake could have caused a large area of seafloor to collapse into the deep Norwegian sea, thus carrying the enormous volume of accumulated sediment along with it.

==Impact on human populations==

At, or shortly before, the time of the Second Storegga Slide, a land bridge known to archaeologists and geologists as Doggerland linked Britain, Denmark and the Netherlands across what is now the southern North Sea. This area is believed to have included a coastline of lagoons, marshes, mudflats and beaches, and to have been a rich hunting, fowling and fishing ground populated by Mesolithic human cultures.

Although Doggerland was permanently submerged through a gradual rise in sea level, it has been hypothesized that coastal areas of both Britain and mainland Europe, extending over areas which are now submerged, would have been temporarily inundated by a tsunami triggered by the Storegga Slide. This event would have had a catastrophic impact on the Mesolithic population at the time. It is estimated that up to a quarter of the Mesolithic population of Britain lost their lives.

A 2021 study found that about of Scotland&#x27;s northern and eastern coastline were affected, with water encroaching inland. With present-day populations and sea levels, a similar event today could devastate and destroy seafront and port areas of Arbroath, Stonehaven, Aberdeen, Inverness, Wick, and Montrose.

While the tsunami caused by the Second Storegga Slide would have been devastating for those within the run-in zone, ultimately the tsunami was neither universally catastrophic nor the reason behind the inundation of the last vestiges of Doggerland.

==Future slides==
Storegga has been thoroughly investigated as part of the preparation activities for the Ormen Lange gas field off the coast of Norway. The prevalent conclusion is that the slide was caused by glacial deposits left behind after the previous glacial period, making any recurrence only possible following a new glaciation. After facts and arguments supporting this conclusion were published in 2004, the development of the Ormen Lange gas field was considered unlikely to increase the risk of triggering a new slide.

<text>Misua (also spelled mee sua or miswa; ), also known as wheat vermicelli, is a very thin variety of salted noodles made from wheat flour. It originated in Fujian, China. The noodles differ from &quot;mifen&quot; (rice vermicelli) and cellophane noodles in that those varieties are made from rice and mung beans, respectively.

&quot;Misua&quot; is made from wheat flour. Cooking &quot;misua&quot; usually takes less than two minutes in boiling water, and sometimes significantly less.

== Types ==

In Taiwan, there are two forms of &quot;misua&quot;. The first is plain, while the second has been steamed at high heat, caramelizing it to a light brown colour. For birthdays, plain &quot;misua&quot; is usually served plain with pork hocks () in stewed broth as a Taiwanese birthday tradition. Brown &quot;misua&quot; can be cooked for prolonged periods without disintegrating in the cooking broth and is used in oyster vermicelli (), a dish popular in Taiwan.

==Culture==
&quot;Misua&quot; is cooked during important festivities, and eaten in China as well in Cambodia, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam, Brunei, Thailand, Myanmar, and particularly in both Taiwan and the Philippines.

&quot;Misua&quot; signifies long life in Chinese culture, and as such is a traditional birthday food. Because of this, it is often discouraged to chew or cut &quot;misua&quot; noodles. It is usually served with ingredients such as eggs, tofu, bell peppers, oysters, pig&#x27;s large intestine, sponge gourd (known as &quot;patola&quot; in the Philippines), shiitake mushroom, beef, shallots, or scallions, roasted nuts or fried fish.

<text>Eastertide (also known as Eastertime or the Easter season) or Paschaltide (also known as Paschaltime or the Paschal season) is a festal season in the liturgical year of Christianity that focuses on celebrating the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. Preceded by Lent, it begins on Easter Sunday, which initiates Easter Week in Western Christianity, and Bright Week in Eastern Christianity.

There are several Eastertide customs across the Christian world, including flowering the cross, sunrise services, the wearing of Easter bonnets by women, exclaiming the Paschal greeting, clipping the church, and decorating Easter eggs, a symbol of the empty tomb. Additional Eastertide traditions include egg hunting, eating special Easter foods and watching Easter parades. The Easter lily, a symbol of the resurrection in Christianity, traditionally decorates the chancel area of churches on this day and for the rest of Eastertide.

Traditionally lasting 40 days to commemorate the time the resurrected Jesus remained on earth before his Ascension, in some western churches Eastertide lasts 50 days to conclude on the day of Pentecost or Whitsunday.

==Western Christianity==
Easter time is the period of 50 days, spanning from Easter Sunday to Pentecost Sunday. It is celebrated as a single joyful feast, called the &quot;great Lord&#x27;s Day&quot;. Each Sunday of the season is treated as a Sunday of Easter. In some traditions, Easter Sunday is the first Sunday of Eastertide and the following Sunday (Low Sunday) is the second Sunday of Eastertide and so on.

Easter Sunday and Pentecost correspond to pre-existing Jewish feasts: The first day of Pesach (פסח) and the holiday of Shavu&#x27;ot (שבועות). In the Jewish tradition, the 49 days between these holidays are known as Counting of the Omer (ספירת העומר)‎.

The first eight days constitute the Octave of Easter and are celebrated as solemnities of the Lord.

Since 2000, the Second Sunday of Easter is also called Divine Mercy Sunday. The name &quot;Low Sunday&quot; for this Sunday, once common in English, is now used mainly in the Church of England.

The solemnity of the Ascension of the Lord is celebrated on the 40th day of Eastertide (a Thursday), except in countries where it is not a Holy Day of Obligation. In such countries it is celebrated on the following Sunday (the 43rd day of Eastertide). The nine days from that feast until the Saturday before Pentecost (inclusive) are days of preparation for the Holy Spirit the Paraclete, which inspired the form of prayer called a novena.

Before the 1969 revision of the calendar, the Sundays were called First Sunday &quot;after&quot; Easter, Second Sunday &quot;after&quot; Easter, etc. The Sunday preceding the feast of the Ascension of the Lord was sometimes, although not officially, called Rogation Sunday, and when the Ascension had an octave, the following Sunday was called Sunday within the Octave of the Ascension. When this octave was abolished in 1955, it was called Sunday after the Ascension. Pentecost was followed by an octave, which some reckoned as part of Eastertide.

When the Anglican and Lutheran churches implemented their own calendar and lectionary reforms in 1976, they adopted the same shortened definition of the Easter season as the Roman Catholic Church had promulgated six years earlier. In the Church of England, the Easter season begins with the Easter Vigil and ends after Evening Prayer (or Night Prayer) on the Day of Pentecost. Some Anglican provinces continue to label the Sundays between Easter and the Ascension &quot;Sundays After Easter&quot; rather than &quot;Sundays of Easter&quot;; others, such as the Church of England and ECUSA, use the term &quot;Sundays of Easter&quot;. Anglican provinces and dioceses which continue to use The Book of Common Prayer (1662) as their standard of doctrine and liturgy persist in having a traditional 40 day Eastertide which concludes on Ascension Day, also known as Holy Thursday.

The Te Deum and Gloria are recited every day even in the ferial Office. On Sundays the &quot;Asperges&quot; is replaced by the &quot;Vidi Aquam&quot; which recalls the solemn baptism of Easter eve. There is no feast day from Easter until Ascension. The Armenians during this period do away even with the abstinence on Fridays. Prayers are said standing, not kneeling. Instead of the &quot;Angelus&quot; the &quot;Regina Caeli&quot; is recited. From Easter to Ascension many churches, about the tenth century, said only one Nocturn at Matins; even some particular churches in the city of Rome adopted this custom from the Teutons (Bäumer, &quot;Gesch. des Breviers&quot;, 312).

Pope Gregory VII limited this privilege to the week of Easter and of Pentecost. Some dioceses in Germany retained it far into the nineteenth century for 40 days after Easter. In every Nocturn the three psalms are said under one antiphon. The Alleluia appears as an independent antiphon. An Alleluia is added to all the antiphons, responsories and versicles, except to the versicles of the preces at Prime and Compline. Instead of the &quot;suffragia sanctorum&quot; in the semidouble and ferial Offices, a commemoration of the Holy Cross is used. The iambic hymns have a special Easter doxology.

The feasts of the holy Apostles and martyrs have their own commune from Easter to Pentecost. At Mass the Alleluia is added to the Introit, Offertory and Communion; in place of the Gradual two Alleluias are sung followed by two verses, each with an Alleluia; there is also a special Preface for Paschal Time.

Paschal Tide was the period during which every member of the faithful who has attained the year of discretion was bound by the positive law of the Church to receive Holy Communion (Easter duty). During the early Middle Ages from the time of the Synod of Agde (508), it was customary to receive Holy Communion at least three times a year—Christmas, Easter and Pentecost. A positive precept was issued by the Fourth Lateran Council (1215) and confirmed by the Council of Trent (Sess. XIII, can. ix). According to these decrees the faithful of either sex, after coming to the age of discretion, must receive at least at Easter the Sacrament of the Eucharist (unless by the advice of the parish priest they abstain for a while). Otherwise during life they are to be prevented from entering the church and when dead are to be denied Christian burial. The paschal precept is to be fulfilled in one&#x27;s parish church.

Although the precept of the Fourth Lateran to confess to the parish priest fell into disuse and permission was given to confess anywhere, the precept of receiving Easter Communion in the parish church was still in force where there are canonically erected parishes.

The term Paschal Tide was usually interpreted to mean the two weeks between Palm and Low Sundays (Synod of Avignon, 1337). By St. Antonine of Florence it was restricted to Easter Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. By Angelo da Chiavasso it was defined as the period from Maundy Thursday to Low Sunday. Eugene IV, 8 July 1440, authoritatively interpreted it to mean the two weeks between Palm and Low Sundays.

In later centuries the time has been variously extended: at Naples from Palm Sunday to Ascension; at Palermo from Ash Wednesday to Low Sunday. In Germany, at an early date, the second Sunday after Easter terminated Paschal Tide, for which reason it was called &quot;Predigerkirchweih&quot;, because the hard Easter labour was over, or &quot;Buch Sunday&quot;, the obstinate sinners putting off the fulfillment of the precept to the last day. In the United States upon petition of the Fathers of the First Provincial Council of Baltimore Paschal Tide was extended by Pius VIII to the period from the first Sunday in Lent to Trinity Sunday (II Plen. Coun. Balt., n. 257); in Canada the duration of the Paschal Tide is the same as in the United States. In England it lasts from Ash Wednesday until Low Sunday; in Ireland from Ash Wednesday until the octave of SS. Peter and Paul, 6 July.

===Liturgical aspects===
Paschal Tide is a season of joy. The liturgical color is white (and sometimes gold), which is the color designated for feasts and festivals. The Paschal candle is lit on Easter and on Sundays during Eastertide. Eastertide ends on the Day of Pentecost. The Easter lily, a symbol of the resurrection, traditionally serve as the chancel flowers that decorate the chancel area of churches throughout Eastertide.

The Orthodox (Greek) Church celebrates on Friday of Easter Week the feast of Our Lady, the Living Fountain (shrine at Constantinople).

The Sundays from Easter to Ascension Day, besides being called the First, Second (etc.) Sunday in Easteride or after Easter Sunday, have their own peculiar titles.

====First Sunday====
====Second Sunday====

The Second Sunday of Easter is also known in Western Christianity as Divine Mercy Sunday, the Octave Day of Easter, White Sunday, Quasimodo Sunday, and Low Sunday. In Eastern Christianity, this day is known as Antipascha, New Sunday (or Renewal Sunday), and Thomas Sunday.

====Third Sunday====

Traditionally, the Third Sunday of Easter was also called Misericordia Sunday and Good Shepherd Sunday in Western Christianity. Subsequent to modern liturgical reforms, these names are often applied to the Fourth Sunday instead. In Greek Orthodoxy, this day is called the Sunday of the Myrrhbearers.

====Fourth Sunday====

Traditionally, the Fourth Sunday of Easter was also called Jubilate Sunday in Western Christianity. Subsequent to modern liturgical reforms, this name is often more appropriately applied to the Third Sunday instead. The Fourth Sunday of Easter is also known as Good Shepherd Sunday and Vocations Sunday. In Greek Orthodoxy, this day is called the Sunday of the Paralytic.

====Fifth Sunday====

The Asian Churches on Wednesday after the third Sunday celebrate with a very solemn Office and an octave, the Mesopentekoste, the completion of the first half of Paschal Tide; it is the feast of the manifestation of the Messiah; the Slav nations in this day have a solemn procession and benediction of their rivers.
The fifth Sunday is called Cantate Sunday; by the Orientals it is called Sunday of the Samaritan Woman.

====Sixth Sunday====

The sixth Sunday, &quot;Vocem jucunditatis&quot; in Asia, Sunday of the Man Born Blind. In the Latin Church follow the Rogation Days; in the Greek Church on Tuesday is kept the apodosis or conclusion of the feast of Easter. The Greeks sing the Canons of Easter up to this Tuesday in the same manner as during Easter Week, whilst in the Latin Church the specific Easter Office terminates on Saturday following the feast. Thursday is the feast of the Ascension. The Friday of this week, in Germany, is called &quot;Witterfreitag&quot;; the fields are blessed against frost and thunderstorms.

====Seventh Sunday====

Sunday within the octave of Ascension is called &quot;Exaudi&quot; from the Introit; in some dioceses it is called Feast of Our Lady, Queen of the Apostles (double major) or of the Cenacle (first class); in Rome it was called Sunday of the Roses (&quot;Pascha rosarum&quot; or &quot;rosatum&quot;), since in the Pantheon rose-leaves were thrown from the rotunda into the church; in the Greek and Russian Churches it is the feast of the 318 Fathers of the first Nicene Council; the Armenians call it the &quot;second feast of the flowers&quot;, a repetition of Palm Sunday.

By older liturgists the week before Pentecost is called &quot;Hebdomada expectationis&quot;, week of the expectation of the Holy Ghost. On the Vigil of Pentecost the baptismal water is blessed in the Latin Church. In the Oriental Churches, that Saturday is the psychosabbaton (All Soul&#x27;s Day), upon which the Greeks bless wheat cakes and hold processions to the cemeteries.

==Eastern Christianity==
===Byzantine Rite===
In the Eastern Orthodox Church, Pascha begins on Easter Sunday at Matins which is normally celebrated at midnight and continues for forty days through the ninth hour on the day before the Ascension.

===East Syriac Rite===
The East Syriac Rite refers to Eastertide as the &quot;Season of Resurrection&quot;, also known by the Syriac transliteration &quot;Qyamta&quot; and the season runs up to the feast of Pentecost.

In this rite, the following feasts are fixed to various days of the Season of Resurrection:
* Friday after Easter: All Saints&#x27; Day
* Fourth Sunday after Easter (&quot;Fifth Sunday of Resurrection&quot;): Mar Addai
* Sixth Thursday after Easter: Ascension of Our Lord

The Second Sunday of Resurrection is also known as &quot;New Sunday&quot; or &quot;St. Thomas Sunday&quot;.

<doc id="1340244" wikidata="Q2034641" url="?curid=1340244" title="Battle of Vedrosha">
<text>The Battle of [the] Vedrosha (; ) was fought near the Vedrosha river, close to Dorogobuzh (then in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, now in Russia) on 14 July 1500, during the Second Muscovite–Lithuanian War (1500–1503). 

In the battle of Vedrosha, Muscovite forces defeated outnumbered Lithuanian troops attacking them. The Battle of Vedrosha was the first major Muscovite victory over Lithuania in the war of 1500–1503. 

The Lithuanian geopolitical situation after the battle was desperate. Alexander of Lithuania unsuccessfully tried to even make the Crimean Khanate under Meñli I Giray and Moldavia under Stephen III begin hostilities against Muscovy, with which they were allied. The only help the Lithuanians received was the Livonian Order&#x27;s attack on Pskov, which failed due to dysentery.

The battle is mentioned in several Muscovite Chronicles, but these generally confuse details, for example, place names (e.g. Vyazma instead of Vedrosha) and the names of the military leaders.

== Background ==

=== Lithuanian–Muscovite &quot;Perpetual peace&quot; treaty in 1494 ===
At the turn of the 15th–16th centuries, the Prince of Moscow, openly interfered in the internal affairs of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Muscovites agitated the Grand Duchy&#x27;s Eastern Orthodox inhabitants against their Catholic rulers and tried to enflame to renounce Lithuania and join Muscovy. The First Lithuanian–Muscovite War (1487–1494) concluded with a perpetual peace treaty in 1494 between Grand Duke Alexander of Lithuania and Grand Duke Ivan III of Moscow (both descended from the Lithuanian dynasty of the Gediminids). 

The &quot;Perpetual Peace&quot; treaty with Moscow meant only a short respite for Lithuania, because Ivan III declared war to Lithuania once more on 3 May 1500 to join its eastern lands to Muscovy. The marriage of Alexander and Elena, daughter of Ivan III, in 1495 did not lead to peaceful Lithuanian-Muscovite relations or a common policy against the Tatars, as was hoped for by some. Alexander&#x27;s brothers John I Albert and Vladislaus II of Hungary could not help because they were at war with the Ottoman Empire.

=== Muscovy breaks peace agreement, declares war on Lithuania in 1500 ===
The official pretext for the Muscovite declaration of war was the escape of Duke Simeon Ivanovich Belsky to Moscow in 1499. Muscovites declared themselves defenders of the rights of the Eastern Orthodox in Lithuania, and, along with Bielski&#x27;s escape, provided alleged evidence about attempts of forcefully converting Elena, now Grand Duchess of Lithuania, to Catholicism. They also referred to the activities of Catholic missionaries in the eastern lands of Lithuania where many Orthodox lived. 

After the declaration of war, the princes of Chernigov and Novgorod-Seversk defected to Muscovy. The main object contested between Muscovy and Lithuania were the vast territories close to the Dnieper, which was strategically important for communication and trade.

=== Start of the war ===
In 1500, the war took place in three general areas: Novhorod-Siverskyi, Smolensk and Toropets. Muscovites quickly occupied the Severian lands and part of Chernihiv. The main fighting happened in the direction of Smolensk, which was the war&#x27;s second most strategically important front. 

After the Muscovites captured the Dorogobuzh fortress near the Dnieper, half of the Grand Ducal Lithuanian Army, which was a vanguard of about 3,500 horsemen, moved towards Smolensk and were joined the 500 horsemen of the regent of Smolensk, Stanisław Kiszka. 

== Battle ==
Confident in his strength and underestimating the enemy, the Grand Hetman of Lithuania Konstanty Ostrogski decided to attack first with the 4,000 Lithuanian soldiers. Some sources have doubts about this number of troops, considering it to be underestimated by several times. The Muscovite forces he was facing had at least 20,000 soldiers. The Lithuanians attacked the camp of the central Muscovites forces at a tributary of the Dnieper, the Vedrosha River, but were tricked into a well-organized ambush.

The vanguard of the Muscovite army lured the Lithuanian army into the main Muscovite forces of about 40,000 people, commanded by boyars Daniil Shchenya and , and was defeated. Little is known about the battle itself. The battle&#x27;s outcome was determined not only by the skillfully chosen tactics of the Muscovites but also by their numerical superiority. Muscovites employed similar tactics as those in the Battle of Kulikovo.

The entire Lithuanian military leadership was captured by Muscovite forces, namely the Grand Hetman of Lithuania Konstanty Ostrogski, the regent of Anykščiai , the regent of Naugardukas , , and other Lithuanian nobles. Ostrogski escaped from Moscow in 1507.

== Outcome ==
The defeat at Vedrosha greatly affected Lithuanian society. The Muscovites did not utilize the victory to the fullest strategically, meaning that the battle at Vedrosha had more political and moral significance. Although the road to Smolensk was open for the Muscovites after this battle, despite their proximity to Smolensk and a considerable, at least theoretical, chance of capturing it, the Muscovites limited themselves and did not take advantage of the opportunity. 

Meanwhile, the other part of the Lithuanian army, led by Alexander of Lithuania, was in Borisovsky district, about from Smolensk, too far away to quickly salvage the situation. Overall, the Grand Duke of Lithuania and the Lithuanian military leadership, especially Grand Hetman Ostrogski, received a painful lesson, which they did not repeat, to not divide limited forces for important operations and, on the contrary, concentrate them as much as possible.

<doc id="1340251" wikidata="Q1126839" url="?curid=1340251" title="Horner's syndrome">
<text>Horner&#x27;s syndrome, also known as oculosympathetic paresis, is a combination of symptoms that arises when a group of nerves known as the sympathetic trunk is damaged. The signs and symptoms occur on the same side (ipsilateral) as it is a lesion of the sympathetic trunk. It is characterized by miosis (a constricted pupil), partial ptosis (a weak, droopy eyelid), apparent anhidrosis (decreased sweating), with apparent enophthalmos (inset eyeball).

The nerves of the sympathetic trunk arise from the spinal cord in the chest, and from there ascend to the neck and face. The nerves are part of the sympathetic nervous system, a division of the autonomic (or involuntary) nervous system. Once the syndrome has been recognized, medical imaging and response to particular eye drops may be required to identify the location of the problem and the underlying cause.

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs that are found in people with Horner&#x27;s syndrome on the affected side of the face include the following:
* ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid)
* anhidrosis (decreased sweating)
* miosis (constriction of the pupil)
* Enophthalmos (sinking of the eyeball into the face)
* inability to completely close or open the eyelid
* facial flushing
* headaches
* loss of ciliospinal reflex
* bloodshot conjunctiva, depending on the site of lesion.
* unilateral straight hair (in congenital Horner&#x27;s syndrome); the hair on the affected side may be straight in some cases.
* heterochromia iridum (in congenital Horner&#x27;s syndrome)

Interruption of sympathetic pathways leads to several implications. It inactivates the dilator muscle and thereby produces miosis. It inactivates the superior tarsal muscle which produces ptosis. It reduces sweat secretion in the face. Patients may have apparent enophthalmos (affected eye looks to be slightly sunken in) but this is not always the case. The ptosis from inactivation of the superior tarsal muscle causes the eye to appear sunken in, but when actually measured, enophthalmos is not present. The phenomenon of enophthalmos is seen in Horner&#x27;s syndrome in cats, rats, and dogs.

Sometimes there is flushing on the affected side of the face due to dilation of blood vessels under the skin. The pupil&#x27;s light reflex is maintained as this is controlled via the parasympathetic nervous system.

In children, Horner&#x27;s syndrome sometimes leads to heterochromia, a difference in eye color between the two eyes. This happens because a lack of sympathetic stimulation in childhood interferes with melanin pigmentation of the melanocytes in the superficial stroma of the iris.

In veterinary medicine, signs can include partial closure of the third eyelid, or nictitating membrane.

==Causes==

Horner&#x27;s syndrome is usually acquired as a result of disease, but may also be congenital (inborn, associated with heterochromatic iris) or iatrogenic (caused by medical treatment). In rare cases, Horner&#x27;s syndrome may be the result of repeated, minor head trauma, such as being hit with a soccer ball. Although most causes are relatively benign, Horner&#x27;s syndrome may reflect serious disease in the neck or chest (such as a Pancoast tumor (tumor in the apex of the lung) or thyrocervical venous dilatation).

Causes can be divided according to the presence and location of anhidrosis:
* Central (anhidrosis of face, arm and trunk)
** Syringomyelia
** Multiple sclerosis
** Encephalitis
** Brain tumors
** Lateral medullary syndrome
* Preganglionic (anhidrosis of face)
** Cervical rib traction on stellate ganglion
** Thyroid carcinoma
** Thyroidectomy
** Goiter
** Bronchogenic carcinoma of the superior fissure (Pancoast tumor) on apex of lung
** Klumpke paralysis
** Trauma - base of neck, usually blunt trauma, sometimes surgery.
** As a complication of tube thoracostomy
** Thoracic aortic aneurysm
* Postganglionic (no anhidrosis)
** Cluster headache - combination termed Horton&#x27;s headache
** An episode of Horner&#x27;s syndrome may occur during a migraine attack and be relieved afterwards
** Cavernous sinus thrombosis
** Middle ear infection
* Sympathectomy
* Nerve blocks, such as cervical plexus block, stellate ganglion or interscalene block

== Pathophysiology ==
Horner syndrome is due to a deficiency of sympathetic activity.
The site of lesion to the sympathetic outflow is on the ipsilateral side of the symptoms.
The following are examples of conditions that cause the clinical appearance of Horner&#x27;s syndrome:
* First-order neuron disorder: Central lesions that involve the hypothalamospinal tract (e.g. transection of the cervical spinal cord).
* Second-order neuron disorder: Preganglionic lesions (e.g. compression of the sympathetic chain by a lung tumor) that releases acetylcholine.
* Third-order neuron disorder: Postganglionic lesions at the level of the internal carotid artery (e.g. a tumor in the cavernous sinus or a carotid artery dissection) that releases norepinephrine.
* Partial Horner&#x27;s syndrome: In case of a third-neuron disorder, anhidrosis is limited to the middle part of the forehead or can be absent, resulting in a partial Horner&#x27;s syndrome.

If patients have impaired sweating above the waist affecting only one side of the body, and they do not have clinically apparent Horner&#x27;s syndrome, then their lesions are just below the stellate ganglion in the sympathetic chain.

==Diagnosis==

Three tests are useful in confirming the presence and severity of Horner syndrome:
* Cocaine drop test: Cocaine eyedrops block the reuptake of post-ganglionic norepinephrine resulting in the dilation of a normal pupil from retention of norepinephrine in the synapse. However, in Horner&#x27;s syndrome the lack of norepinephrine in the synaptic cleft causes mydriatic failure. A more recently introduced approach that is more dependable and obviates the difficulties in obtaining cocaine is to apply the alpha-agonist apraclonidine to both eyes and observe the increased mydriatic effect (due to hypersensitivity) on the affected side of Horner syndrome (the opposite effect to what the cocaine test would produce in the presence of Horner&#x27;s).
* Paredrine test: This test helps to localize the cause of the miosis. If the third order neuron (the last of three neurons in the pathway which ultimately discharges norepinephrine into the synaptic cleft) is intact, then the amphetamine causes neurotransmitter vesicle release, thus releasing norepinephrine into the synaptic cleft and resulting in robust mydriasis of the affected pupil. If the lesion itself is of the third order neuron, then the amphetamine will have no effect and the pupil remains constricted. There is no pharmacological test to differentiate between a first and second order neuron lesion.
* Dilation lag test

It is important to distinguish the ptosis caused by Horner&#x27;s syndrome from the ptosis caused by a lesion to the oculomotor nerve. In the former, the ptosis occurs with a constricted pupil (due to a loss of sympathetics to the eye), whereas in the latter, the ptosis occurs with a dilated pupil (due to a loss of innervation to the sphincter pupillae). In a clinical setting, these two ptoses are fairly easy to distinguish. In addition to the blown pupil in a CNIII (oculomotor nerve) lesion, this ptosis is much more severe, occasionally occluding the whole eye. The ptosis of Horner syndrome can be quite mild or barely noticeable (partial ptosis).

When anisocoria occurs and the examiner is unsure whether the abnormal pupil is the constricted or dilated one, if a one-sided ptosis is present then the abnormally sized pupil can be presumed to be on the side of the ptosis.

==History==
The syndrome is named after Johann Friedrich Horner, the Swiss ophthalmologist who first described the syndrome in 1869. Several others had previously described cases, but &quot;Horner&#x27;s syndrome&quot; is most prevalent. In France and Italy, Claude Bernard is also eponymized with the condition (Claude Bernard–Horner syndrome, abbreviated CBH). In France, Francois Pourfour du Petit is also credited with describing this syndrome.

== Children ==
The most common causes in young children are birth trauma and a type of cancer called neuroblastoma. The cause of about a third of cases in children is unknown.

<doc id="1340254" wikidata="Q692825" url="?curid=1340254" title="Lanaudière">
<text>Lanaudière (, ) is one of the seventeen administrative regions of Quebec, Canada, situated immediately to the northeast of Montreal. It has a total population (2016 Census) of 494,796 inhabitants, an increase of 4.9% over the 2011 census.

==Geography==
The region of Lanaudière is part of central Quebec and is located between the Saint Lawrence River and the Laurentian Mountains, between Mauricie and the Laurentides. Lanaudière attracts a good deal of interest from vacationers. Lanaudière&#x27;s area of stretch northwest from a shoreline of on the Saint Lawrence River. Lanaudière is generally rural, while the urban areas are generally concentrated in the south of the region, such as Repentigny, Terrebonne and Berthierville. The altitude rises as one goes northwards; it is near the Saint Lawrence River to almost at the top of mountains near Saint-Donat and Saint-Zénon.

Lanaudière is made up of three distinct geographical groupings: the southern plain has cities and farming villages and includes many historical locations; the piedmont in the centre has become a vacation spot due to its numerous lakes and natural attractions, and the Laurentian Plateau in the far north in the forested country is known for its fishing and hiking.

The three main ports of entry for Lanaudière are all in the south: Terrebonne, Repentigny and Berthierville.

Lanaudière&#x27;s road network was developed according to three north-south axes (25-125, 31-131, 347), all of which have few links with the neighbouring regions. This internal network is almost exclusively composed of secondary roads. Lanaudière has two wildlife preserves, the Rouge-Matawin and the Mastigouche, as well as part of the Mont Tremblant park. Further to the north, about an hour away from Saint-Michel-des-Saints, there is the Atikamekw indian reserve of Manawan.

==History==
The region of Lanaudière owes its name to history - it perpetuates the memory of Marie-Charlotte de Lanaudière, daughter of the lord of Lavaltrie and wife of the businessman Barthélemy Joliette, descendant of the famous explorer Louis Jolliet. The name &quot;Lanaudière&quot; evokes the lineage of the lords De Lanaudière who contributed, over seven generations, to the defence and the development of the French colonies in America, of France and of the region.

==Administrative divisions==
===Regional county municipalities===
=== Nation Atikamekw ===

=== School districts ===
The 10 French-language districts have service by the two school service centres of the region and two districts by centres of Laurentides:

* Commission scolaire des Affluents; (L&#x27;Assomption, Les Moulins (except a district part of Terrebonne served by Commission scolaire de la Seigneurie-des-Mille-Îles))
* Commission scolaire des Samares (D&#x27;Autray, Montcalm, Joliette et Matawinie (except the district of Saint-Donat served by Centre de services scolaire des Laurentides)).

<doc id="1340258" wikidata="Q3275575" url="?curid=1340258" title="Tuen Mun Road">
<text>Tuen Mun Road is a major expressway in Hong Kong which connects Tuen Mun with Tsuen Wan, within the New Territories. It is part of Hong Kong&#x27;s Route 9, which circumnavigates the New Territories. Opened in 1978, it was once the major trunk route linking the northwest New Territories to urban Kowloon and is known for its frequent traffic jams and road accidents owing to its early design and heavy usage. As a result, speed limits have been enforced to due to geometric constraints.

==Alignment==

The highway leads off Yuen Long Highway at Lam Tei Interchange, where it also interchanges with Castle Peak Road and Tsing Lun Road. The next section (considered from west to east) is a dual 3 lane road through the town centre of Tuen Mun, but this section is not a statutorily designated (limited-access) expressway.

Expressway regulations apply from the junction with Wong Chu Road, where it widens to 3 lanes and climbs the hillside beside Sam Shing Hui. It then descends into So Kwun Wat, crossing the rural area on an embankment. The road then rises again before descending into Siu Lam Interchange, where it interchanges with Castle Peak Road.

From here, the highway crosses the mouth of Tai Lam Chung, and starts climbing the hillsides of Tai Lam through split level terraces (the lower one being the Tuen Mun bound carriageway). The two carriageways join before bypassing the village of Tsing Lung Tau to the north. This section of road is constructed upon various deep cuttings and high embankments. Afterwards, the road crosses over the village of Sham Tseng (situated in a valley) to Sham Tseng Interchange, where it interchanges once again with Castle Peak Road.

The road then climbs towards Ting Kau Interchange with its widest section (5+3 lanes). After this junction with Tsing Long Highway, the Highway crosses the valley of Ting Kau with various viaducts, with the Tsuen Wan bound carriageway climbing to meet the split level section into Tsuen Wan. This section is characterised by its tight bends and steep descent eastbound. The two carriageways join as the highway terminates and leads into Cheung Pei Shan Road, with slip roads connecting with Tsuen Wan Road and Castle Peak Road (Tsuen Wan Section).

==Interchanges==


==History and development==
Tuen Mun Road was one of Hong Kong&#x27;s first high speed roads, and the first expressway. Its construction proved to be a great challenge for the engineers. The road had to be built along the winding coastline, and the steep terrain encountered required the construction of numerous viaducts, culverts and cuttings. To save construction costs, the road was built with narrow carriageways and substandard geometry, causing frequent traffic accidents and subsequent congestion for a long period, and as a result speed limits reduced to . Another such measure was putting the construction work into phases.

Phase 1 of the road was built in 1977, being the present day Tsuen Wan bound carriageway. This section was officially opened on 5 May 1978 by Governor Murray MacLehose. Phase 2, which consists of the Tuen Mun bound carriageway between Sham Tseng and Tsuen Wan, was opened in 1981; the remaining Tuen Mun Bound carriageway was completed in 1983.

Since the road was opened, there have been various improvements carried out to meet the increasing traffic demand, such as the addition of uphill crawler lanes (Tsuen Wan Bound) at Sam Shing Hui, So Kwun Wat, Tai Lam Chung and Ting Kau. The Highways Department has plans to carry out extensive reconstruction works on Tuen Mun Road that will include widening traffic lanes, improving horizontal curvatures and sightlines, and the installation of noise barriers. These works commenced in October 2008 and completed at the end of 2015.

Tuen Mun Road remains one of the most heavily used roads in Hong Kong, as some drivers heading to Yuen Long shunpike Tai Lam Tunnel, and container trucks use it to access the River Trade Terminal in Tuen Mun.

To enhance the convenience of communicators travelling from New Territories to Kowloon or Hong Kong Island, Tuen Mun Road Bus-Bus Interchange had been under construction since 15 July 2010. The interchange on Kowloon bound side and that on Tuen Mun bound side were commissioned on 26 December 2012 and 27 July 2013 respectively.

==Major incidents==
===Bus accident near Ting Kau===
In the morning of 10 July 2003, a Neoplan Centroliner bus was running on route 265M of Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) towards Tin Shui Wai, Yuen Long. A lorry running in the middle lane lost control as the bus approached the junction with Tsing Long Highway. The two vehicles collided, knocking the bus towards the side of the viaduct. The bus broke through the parapet, and plunged into Ting Kau Village below, resulting in 21 deaths (including the driver) and 20 injured.

Rescue operations were described as being the most challenging encountered by the fire services since the fire at Garley Building. This was due to the constraints at the site (a rural village sited on a steep hillside with no direct road access), and the sheer volume of severely wounded casualties.

The bus was later lifted back onto Tuen Mun Road and transported to the vehicle compound at Siu Ho Wan. It was however written off.

After the incident, then-Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa visited the crash scene and pledged that the government would do all that it could to aid the survivors, to investigate the accident and prevent similar accidents from ever happening again.

The lorry driver was sentenced to 18 months in jail after being found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving. At the time, it was the most serious road accident in Hong Kong history. He later appealed the rulings, which were subsequently overturned. Tests have shown that the vehicle he was driving was defective (tending to veer to the side when braking), and he was then found guilty of a lesser charge, careless driving, and his sentence was shortened to five months and a two-year driving ban.

===Tyre burst incident near Yau Kom Tau===
On 1 December 2013, a screw that protruded out of the road surface caused the tyres of about 50 heavy vehicles, of which 36 were KMB buses, to burst. The incident caused a 3-hour traffic jam and a partial closure of the road. Hundreds of passengers were affected but no one was injured in the incident.

<doc id="1340260" wikidata="Q245491" url="?curid=1340260" title="6-meter band">
<text>The 6-meter band is the lowest portion of the very high frequency (VHF) radio spectrum (50.000-54.000 MHz) internationally allocated to amateur radio use. The term refers to the average signal wavelength of 6 meters.

Although located in the lower portion of the VHF band, it nonetheless occasionally displays propagation mechanisms characteristic of the high frequency (HF) bands. This normally occurs close to sunspot maximum, when solar activity increases ionization levels in the upper atmosphere. Worldwide 6-meter propagation occurred during the sunspot maximum of 2005, making 6 meter communications as good as or, in some cases and locations, better than HF frequencies. The prevalence of HF characteristics on this VHF band has inspired amateur operators to dub it the &quot;magic band&quot;.

In the northern hemisphere, activity peaks from May through early August, when regular sporadic E propagation enables long-distance contacts spanning up to for single-hop propagation. Multiple-hop sporadic E propagation allows intercontinental communications at distances of up to . In the southern hemisphere, sporadic E propagation is most common from November through early February.

The 6-meter band shares many characteristics with the neighboring 8-meter band, but it is somewhat higher in frequency.

== History ==
On October 10, 1924, the 5-meter band (56–64 MHz) was first made available to amateurs in the United States by the Third National Radio Conference. On October 4, 1927, the band was allocated on a worldwide basis by the International Radiotelegraph Conference in Washington, D.C. 56–60 MHz was allocated for amateur and experimental use. There was no change to this allocation at the 1932 International Radiotelegraph Conference in Madrid.

At the 1938 International Radiocommunication Conference in Cairo, television broadcasting was given priority in a portion of the 5- and 6-meter band in Europe. Television and low power stations, meaning those with less than 1 kW power, were allocated 56–58.5 MHz and amateurs, experimenters and low power stations were allocated 58.5–60 MHz in the European region. The conference maintained the 56–60 MHz allocation for other regions and allowed administrations in Europe latitude to allow amateurs to continue using 56–58.5 MHz.

Starting in 1938, the FCC created 6 MHz wide television channel allocations working around the 5-meter amateur band with channel 2 occupying 50–56 MHz. In 1940, television channel 2 was reallocated to 60 MHz and TV channel 1 was moved to 50–56 MHz maintaining a gap for the 5-meter amateur band. When the US entered World War II, transmissions by amateur radio stations were suspended for the duration of the war. After the war, the 5-meter band was briefly reopened to amateurs from 56–60 MHz until March 1, 1946. At that time the FCC moved television channel 2 down to 54–60 MHz and reallocated channel 1 down to 44–50 MHz opening a gap that would become the Amateur radio 6-meter band in the United States. FCC Order 130-C went into effect at 3 am Eastern Standard Time on March 1, 1946, and created the 6-meter band allocation for the amateur service as 50–54 MHz. Emission types A1, A2, A3 and A4 were allowed for the entire band and special emission for frequency modulation telephony was allowed from 52.5 to 54 MHz.

At the 1947 International Radio Conference in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the amateur service was allocated 50–54 MHz in ITU Region 2 and 3. Broadcasting was allocated from 41 to 68 MHz in ITU Region 1, but allowed exclusive amateur use of the 6-meter band (50–54 MHz) in a portion of southern Africa.

Amateurs in the United Kingdom remained in the 5-meter band (58.5–60 MHz) for a period of time following World War II, but lost the band to UK analogue television channel 4. They gained a 4-meter band in 1956 and eventually gained the 6 meter band from 50–52 MHz, when it was decided to terminate analogue television broadcasts on channel 2.

== Amateur radio ==
The Radio Regulations of the International Telecommunication Union allow amateur radio operations in the frequency range from 50.000–54.000 MHz in ITU Regions 2 and 3. At ITU level, Region 1 is allocated to broadcasting. However, in practice a large number of ITU Region 1 countries allow amateur use of at least some of the 6 meter band. Over the years portions have been vacated by VHF television broadcasting channels for one reason or another. In November 2015 the ITU World Radio Conference (WRC-15) agreed that for their next conference in 2019, Agenda Item 1.1 would study a future allocation of 50–54 MHz to amateur radio in Region 1.

===Frequency allocations===

6 meter frequency allocations for amateur radio are not universal worldwide. In the United States and Canada, the band ranges from 50-54 MHz. In some other countries, the band is restricted to military communications. Further, in a few nations, the frequency range is still used for television transmissions, although most countries have (re)assigned those television channels to higher frequencies (see TV channel 1).

For many years the International Telecommunication Union did not allocate 6 meter frequencies to amateurs in Europe. However the decline of VHF television broadcasts and commercial pressure on the lower VHF spectrum enabled most European countries to provide a 6 meter amateur allocation. Eventually in 2015, following a proposal by IARU to CEPT, the ITU adopted Agenda Item AI-1.1, which four years later led to a formal ITU Region-1 allocation at WRC-19 of 50-52 MHz, with some non-European countries allocating up to 50-54MHz. 

For example, the United Kingdom, has an allocation in the 6 meter band between 50 and 52 MHz, split as 50–51 MHz amateur primary, and the rest is secondary, with a lower power limit. A detailed bandplan can be obtained from the Radio Society of Great Britain (RSGB) website. this has 50.0-50.5 MHz for narrowband DX modes and propagation beacons, whilst wider bandwidth FM, repeaters and Digital modes can be used in 50.5-52 MHz, including experimental Digital-ATV. 

Many organizations promote regular competitions in this frequency range to promote its use and to familiarize operators to its quirks. For example, RSGB VHF Contest Committee has a large number of contests on 6 meters every year. 

Because of its peculiarity, there are a number of 6 meter band operator groups. These people monitor the status of the band between different paths and promote 6 meter band operations.

For a full list of countries using 6 meters, refer to the bandplan of the International Amateur Radio Union.

===Television interference===
Because the 6 meter band is just below the frequencies formerly allocated to the old VHF television Channel 2 in North America (54–60 MHz), television interference (TVI) to neighbors&#x27; sets was a common problem for amateurs operating in this band prior to June 2009, when analog television transmissions ended in the U.S.

==Equipment==

Beginning around the turn of the millennium, the availability of transceivers that include the 6 meter band has increased greatly. Many commercial HF transceivers now include the 6 meter band along with shortwave, as do a few handheld VHF/UHF transceivers. There are also a number of stand-alone 6 meter band transceivers, although commercial production of these has been relatively rare in recent years. Despite support in more available radios, however, the 6 meter band does not share the popularity of amateur radio&#x27;s 2-meter band. This is due, in large part, to the larger size of 6 meter antennas, power limitations in some countries outside the United States, and the 6 meter band&#x27;s greater susceptibility to local electrical interference.

As transceivers have become more available for the 6 meter band, it has quickly gained popularity. In many countries, including the United States, access is granted to entry-level license holders. Those without access to international HF frequencies often gain their first experience with truly long-distance communications on the 6 meter band. Many of these operators develop a real affection for the challenge of the band, and often continue to devote much time to it, even when they gain access to the HF frequencies after upgrading their licenses.

For antennas, horizontal polarization is used for 6 meter weak signal, SSB communications using tropospheric propagation, sporadic-E, and multi-hop sporadic-E, and for other propagation modes where polarization does not matter as much. Vertical polarization is customarily used for local FM communications, repeaters, radio control.

== Common uses ==

* AM simplex (direct, radio-to-radio communications)
* FM simplex (direct, radio-to-radio communications)
* FM repeater operation
* Earth-Moon-Earth communication
* Sporadic E propagation
* Aurora Borealis reflection
* WSJT digital modes
* Packet radio
* SSB voice operation
* Morse code (CW) operation
* DX
* Radio control

=== Radio control hobby use ===

In North America, especially in the United States and Canada, the 6-meter band may be used by licensed amateurs for the safe operation of radio-controlled (RC) aircraft and other types of radio control hobby miniatures. By general agreement among the amateur radio community, 200 kHz of the 6 meter band is reserved for the telecommand of models, by licensed amateurs using amateur frequencies. The sub-band reserved for this use is 50.79–50.99 MHz with ten &quot;specified&quot; frequencies, numbered &quot;00&quot; through &quot;09&quot;, spaced at 20 kHz apart from 50.800–50.980 MHz. The upper end of the band, starting at 53.0 MHz, and going upwards in 100 kHz steps to 53.8 MHz, used to be similarly reserved for RC modelers, but with the rise of amateur repeater stations operating above 53 MHz in the United States, and very few 53 MHz RC units in Canada, the move to the lower end of the 6 meter spectrum for radio-controlled model &quot;flying&quot; activities by amateur radio operators was undertaken in North America, starting in the early 1980s, and more-or-less completed by 1991. It is still completely legal for ground-level RC model operation (cars, boats, etc.) to be accomplished on any frequency within the band, above 50.1 MHz, by any licensed amateur operator in the United States; however, an indiscriminate choice of frequencies for RC operations is discouraged by the amateur radio community via its self-imposed band plan for 6 meters.

In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s (FCC) Part 97.215 rules regulate certain telecommand of model craft in the amateur service within the United States. It allows an unidentified maximum radiated RF power output of one watt for RC model operations of any type. IF higher power is used, then all applicable sections of Part 97 must be followed.

In Canada, Industry Canada&#x27;s RBR-4, Standards for the Operation of Radio Stations in the Amateur Radio Service, limits radio control of craft, for those models intended for use on any amateur radio-allocated frequency, to amateur service frequencies above 30 MHz.

<doc id="1340262" wikidata="Q16954325" url="?curid=1340262" title="The Cross-Wits">
<text>The Cross-Wits is an American television game show. Two contestants, each paired with two celebrities, competed to fill in words in a crossword puzzle. It premiered on December 15, 1975, and lasted for five seasons until its cancellation on September 12, 1980. The show was hosted by Jack Clark, with Jerri Fiala as hostess. Announcing duties were handled by John Harlan, Jay Stewart, and Jerry Bishop. The show was produced by Ralph Edwards Productions and distributed by Metromedia Producers Corporation.

A second version began airing on September 8, 1986, titled &quot;The All-New Crosswits&quot;, and was hosted by David Sparks with Michelle Roth as announcer. This version was produced by Crossedwits Productions in association with Outlet Communications, Inc., and distributed by ABR Entertainment.

Both versions were produced as daily shows, although the original &quot;Cross-Wits&quot; aired in many markets as either a once- or twice-weekly series.

==Main game==
Two teams, each consisting of two celebrities and one contestant, competed to solve clues to crossword puzzles. Each word in the puzzle was also a clue to a master puzzle.

===1975–80 version===

The category of the master puzzle was announced at the beginning of each round. The contestant captain of one team chose a word in the puzzle, by number and orientation (across or down), and designated one star to play it. After hearing a clue to the word, the star had seven seconds to guess it; if he/she failed to do, the captain could offer a guess. If the captain also failed to solve the word, control passed to the opposing team.

A correct answer awarded 10 points per letter in the word. The captain could then either choose a word for the other star on his/her team or try to guess the subject of the master puzzle. In the latter case, all three team members were given seven seconds to discuss the puzzle, after which the captain could guess. A correct solution awarded 100 points, while a miss gave control to the opponents. The trailing team at the end of any round had initial control for the next one.

Starting in 1976, contestants won a prize for solving each puzzle in addition to the 100-point bonus. From 1976 to 1979, the category of the master puzzle was not immediately revealed at the start of the first two rounds; any contestant who solved such a puzzle after the first word won a car. The host revealed the category if the puzzle was not solved at this point. In case a car was won in the first round, the category of the puzzle would be revealed for the second round. In 1979, the rules were changed to offer the car only during the second round, with no discussion between the stars and contestant, who was given five seconds to decide on a response. The team who solved the puzzle in the first round began the second one, a change intended to deter teams from deliberately losing the first round in order to have a better chance at winning the car.

The game continued until time was called, and the captain of the leading team won the game. Starting in 1979, a captain whose team scored 1,000 points also won a $1,000 bonus.

This version was taped before the era of computerized graphics and featured a manually operated game board that used back-lit tiles which illuminated to show the letters in each word. Hostess Fiala would use a long pointer to indicate the position of each word on the board, as the numbers on the squares were too small to be seen by home viewers.

===1986–87 version===
The game was played similarly to the 1975 version with modifications to the scoring format. Each word in the first puzzle scored 5 points per letter and solving the puzzle scored 50 points. These values doubled to 10/100 in the second round, and 20/200 in the third. The gameboard for this version was entirely computer-generated, and its coloration varied depending on the subject of the master puzzle (person, place, or thing).

==Crossfire round (both versions)==
The contestant with the most points at the end of the game played the Crossfire Round along with his/her choice of celebrity partner (a choice of all four in 1975-1976 &amp; 1986-1987 and only the winning player&#x27;s partners from 1976-1980). The team was shown one last crossword puzzle with ten words, none of which were clues to a master puzzle. The team called out words by number and the host read the clue for that word. If the team could solve all ten words in 60 seconds or less, the contestant won the grand prize.

In the 1975 version, each correct answer won increasingly valuable prizes, and if the contestant solved all ten they won the grand prize, which was usually a car, but sometimes a trip or a fur coat. In the 1986 version, contestants who solved all ten words won a trip and the opportunity to win a car. Contestants who failed to win the bonus round on the 1986 version won a consolation prize package.

===Car round (1986–87 version)===
The three celebrities who did not play the Crossfire Round were each given boxes with the name of one of three cars available. After choosing which car to play for, the contestant then chose a celebrity. If the model of the chosen car matched the card in the box held by the chosen celebrity, the contestant won the car. For a time, the fourth celebrity was also a participant in the car round, and a corresponding fourth box was added to the mix; if chosen, it was worth $1,000 to the contestant.

For the first two taped episodes, the car round was staged differently: rather than holding boxes containing the names of the three cars offered, the celebrities held the keys to each of the three cars. After choosing a celebrity, that celebrity attempted to unlock the chosen car&#x27;s driver&#x27;s door with his/her key.

==Episode status==
The original version is intact and held by Ralph Edwards Productions, but has not been rerun since its original airings. The revival was shown on The Family Channel from June 7 to August 27, 1993, and on the now-defunct American Independent Network from 1997 to 1998. On October 26, 2014, cable network GSN aired two episodes of the revived version, both from December 1986 featuring Rosie O&#x27;Donnell and Arsenio Hall, respectively.

<doc id="1340264" wikidata="Q1191132" url="?curid=1340264" title="Nagoya University">
<text>, abbreviated to or NU, is a Japanese national research university located in Chikusa-ku, Nagoya.

It was established in 1939 as the last of the nine Imperial Universities in the then Empire of Japan, and is now a Designated National University.

The university is the birthplace of the Sakata School of physics and the Hirata School of chemistry. As of 2021, seven Nobel Prize winners have been associated with Nagoya University, the third most in Japan and Asia behind Kyoto University and the University of Tokyo.

== History ==


Nagoya Imperial University was established as the last of the Imperial Universities in 1939 and was later renamed Nagoya University in 1947. Although relatively new as a university, it can trace its roots back to a Temporary Medical School/Public Hospital opened in 1871. Renowned for its contributions in physics and chemistry, the university has been the birthplace of notable scientific advancements such as the Sakata model, the PMNS matrix, the Okazaki fragment, Noyori asymmetric hydrogenation, and the Blue LED.

In March 2018, Nagoya University was chosen as one of the first five Designated National Universities. The Tokai National Higher Education and Research System, which became Japan&#x27;s largest national higher education corporation, was formed by Nagoya University and Gifu University in April 2020. Both universities are prominent institutions in the Tōkai region.

=== The Nobel Prizes ===
Nearly half of the Japanese Nobel laureates in Natural Sciences in the 21st century have ties to Nagoya University, either as alumni or researchers. Among the seven Nobel laureates associated with the university, four served as professors and three as alumni. The 2021 Nobel laureate in Physics, Syukuro Manabe, was a specially invited professor at Nagoya University from December 2007 to March 2014.

<text>The Catholic–Orthodox Joint Declaration of 1965 was read out on 7 December 1965, simultaneously at a public meeting of the Second Vatican Council in Rome, and at a special ceremony in Istanbul. It withdrew the exchange of excommunications between prominent ecclesiastics in the Holy See and the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, commonly known as the Great Schism of 1054. While it did not end the schism, it showed a desire for greater reconciliation between the two churches, represented by Pope Paul VI and Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I.

Metropolitan Philaret (Voznesensky) of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia openly challenged the Patriarch&#x27;s efforts at rapprochement with the Roman Catholic Church, claiming that it would inevitably lead to heresy, in his 1965 epistle to the Patriarch.

<doc id="1340304" wikidata="Q956208" url="?curid=1340304" title="Mick Jones (Foreigner guitarist)">
<text>Michael Leslie Jones (born 27 December 1944) is an English musician, songwriter and record producer, best known as the founder and leader of the British-American rock band Foreigner. Prior to Foreigner, he was in the band Spooky Tooth.

== Early life ==
Michael Leslie Jones was born on 27 December 1944 in Portsmouth, England. Jones started playing guitar at an early age, and decided to pursue a career in music.

== Career ==
He began his professional music career in the early 1960s as a member of the band Nero and the Gladiators, who scored two minor British hit singles in 1961. After the demise of Nero and the Gladiators, Jones worked as a songwriter and session musician in France for such artists as Françoise Hardy, Sylvie Vartan, and Johnny Hallyday, for whom he wrote many songs, including &quot;Je suis né dans la rue&quot; and &quot;À tout casser&quot; (which features Jimmy Page on guitar). When The Beatles toured France in 1964, they befriended Jones when Hallyday&#x27;s girlfriend and future wife, Sylvie Vartan, played on the same bill as they did. Between 1965 and 1971, Jones recorded in France with Tommy Brown (Thomas R. Browne) as State of Mickey &amp; Tommy, as well as under other session names, including the Blackburds, Nimrod, and the J&amp;B.

After leaving France to return to his home country, Jones joined Gary Wright, formerly of the band Spooky Tooth, to form Wonderwheel in 1971. In 1972, Jones and Wright reformed Spooky Tooth and, after that, Jones was a member of the Leslie West Band. He also played guitar on the albums &quot;Wind of Change&quot; (1972) for Peter Frampton, and &quot;Dark Horse&quot; (1974) for George Harrison.

In 1976, Jones formed Foreigner with Ian McDonald, and recruited lead singer Lou Gramm. Jones co-produced all of the band&#x27;s albums and co-wrote most of their songs with Gramm. Jones is credited with writing the band&#x27;s most successful single, &quot;I Want to Know What Love Is&quot;, by himself. Tensions developed within the band during the late 1980s, attributed to a difference in musical taste between Gramm, who favoured a more hard-edged rock, as opposed to Jones&#x27; interest in synthesisers. Gramm left the band in 1990 but returned in 1992. In 1989 Jones released his only solo album, titled &quot;Mick Jones&quot;, on the Atlantic Records label. Jones is the only member to play on every Foreigner album.

In between his Foreigner commitments, Jones also started a side career as a producer for such albums as Van Halen&#x27;s &quot;5150&quot; (1986), Bad Company&#x27;s &quot;Fame and Fortune&quot; (1986) and Billy Joel&#x27;s &quot;Storm Front&quot; (1989).

He co-wrote with Eric Clapton the song &quot;Bad Love&quot; on Clapton&#x27;s &quot;Journeyman&quot; album, and in 2002 co-wrote the song &quot;On Her Mind&quot; with Duncan Sheik. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, he played with Bill Wyman&#x27;s Rhythm Kings. In 2024, Jones was selected for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as a member of Foreigner.

== Personal life ==

Jones is married to socialite/writer/jewelry designer Ann Dexter-Jones, mother of Mark, Samantha and Charlotte Ronson. He and Dexter-Jones have two children, Annabelle Dexter-Jones and Alexander Dexter-Jones. Married for nearly 25 years (1983–2007), they divorced in 2007. In March 2017, the couple remarried. Jones also has two sons, Roman Jones and Christopher Jones, from previous relationships.

In February 2024, Jones revealed that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease years back, citing this as his reason for not touring with Foreigner since 2023.

== Album producer credits ==
In addition to the Foreigner albums, Jones has produced the following:
* &quot;5150&quot; – Van Halen (1986)
* &quot;Fame and Fortune&quot; – Bad Company (1986)
* &quot;Dead, White and Blue&quot; – Flesh &amp; Blood (1989)

<doc id="1340305" wikidata="Q26409" url="?curid=1340305" title="Centurion">
<text>In the Roman army during classical antiquity, a centurion (; , . ; , or ), was a commander, nominally of a century (), a military unit originally consisting of 100 legionaries. The size of the century changed over time; from the 1st century BC through most of the imperial era it was reduced to 80 men.

A centurion was promoted for being an exemplary soldier and was then expected to become a strict commander of his subordinates, to lead his troops by example, and coordinate his century&#x27;s actions. They were also responsible for handling logistics and supplies, as well as any discipline that was required. In a Roman legion, centuries were grouped into cohorts and commanded by a senior centurion. The prestigious first cohort (a formation of five double-strength centuries of 160 men each) was led by the &quot;primus pilus,&quot; who commanded the &quot;primi ordines&quot; who were the centurions of the first cohort.

A centurion&#x27;s symbol of office was the vine staff, with which they disciplined even Roman citizens, who were otherwise legally protected from corporal punishment by the Porcian laws. Centurions also served in the Roman navy. They were professional officers, analogous to modern non-commissioned officers in terms of pay-grade, prestige, and responsibilities. In late antiquity and the Middle Ages, the Byzantine army&#x27;s centurions were known by the name kentarch (Kentarches).

==Role==

In the Roman infantry, the centurions commanded a &quot;centuria&quot; or &quot;century&quot;. During the Mid-Republic these centuries were grouped in pairs to make up a maniple, each century consisting of 30–60 men. After the so-called &quot;Marian reforms&quot;, a century was typically composed of around 80 men, with six such centuries forming a cohort. Later, generals and emperors further manipulated these numbers with double and half-strength units. Julius Caesar, for instance, made the first cohort of five double strength centuries.

During the Imperial era, centurions gradually rose in seniority in their cohort, commanding centuries with higher precedence, until commanding the senior century and therefore the whole cohort. The best centurions were then promoted to the first cohort and known as the &quot;primi ordines&quot;, commanding one of the cohort&#x27;s five centuries and taking on a staff role. The most senior centurion of the legion was the &quot;primus pilus&quot; who commanded the first century of the first cohort. All centurions, however senior, had their own allocated century. There was little difference between the ranks of centurions except for the &quot;primus pilus&quot;, who also participated in war councils. The &quot;primus pilus&quot; was so called because his own century was the &quot;first file&quot; of the first (rightmost) cohort. Only eight officers in a fully officered legion outranked the &quot;primus pilus&quot;: the legate (&quot;legatus legionis&quot;), commanding the legion; the senior tribune (&quot;tribunus laticlavius&quot;), second-in-command of the legion; the camp prefect (&quot;praefectus castrorum&quot;); and the five other tribunes (&quot;tribuni angusticlavii&quot;) who served as senior staff officers to the legate.

Centurions received a much higher rate of pay than the average legionary. Veteran legionaries often worked as tenants of their former centurions. Centurions could be elected, appointed by the Senate, or promoted from the ranks for a variety of reasons. Julius Caesar is said to have promoted his centurions for displays of valour. Historians cite examples of them being the first over the enemy&#x27;s wall or through the breach. The various centurion grades may be loosely compared to modern junior and middle officer grades. Below the centurions were the &quot;optiones&quot;, seconds-in-command of centuries.

Centurions were held personally responsible for the training and discipline of the legionaries under their command, and they had a reputation for dealing out harsh punishment. Tacitus tells a story in &quot;The Annals&quot; of a centurion known as &quot;Cedo Alteram&quot;, which roughly translates to &quot;Fetch Me Another&quot;. &quot;The mutinous soldiers thrust out the tribunes and the camp-prefect; they plundered the baggage of the fugitives, and then killed a centurion, Lucilius, to whom, with soldier&#x27;s humour, they had given the nickname &#x27;Cedo Alteram&#x27;, because when he had broken one vine-stick across a soldier&#x27;s back, he would call in a loud voice for another… and another...and another!&quot; The vine-stick (&quot;vitis&quot;) was a symbol of the centurion&#x27;s authority and the implement with which he meted out punishment.

Unlike legionaries, centurions carried their swords on their left side as a sign of distinction and carried the pugio (dagger) on the right, as the sidearm. Centurions wore transverse crests on their helmets that would distinguish them from other legionaries. Centurions often had important social status and held powerful positions in society. They seem to have received their status according to their rank. On retirement, they could be eligible for employment as lictors.

===Seniority===

Each century had a precedence within the cohort. Centurions&#x27; seniority within the cohort and legion depended on the position within the legion of the century they were in charge of, which often took their name from their centurion. Centurions began by leading junior centuries before being promoted to leading a more senior one. Promotion usually came with experience, or at least length of service, but many still never made it as far as leading a first cohort. Yet for centurions who showed, say, particularly conspicuous bravery during battle, there was the opportunity to be promoted several grades at once. For example, Julius Caesar&#x27;s reward for a centurion who had greatly pleased him was to advance him eight grades.

The precedence during the times of the Republican manipular legion had each centurio command a centuria of sixty men within a manipulus (maniple) of two centuriae which was commanded by the senior centurio. Their order in decreasing seniority but opposite battle order;

Of the centuriae of a manipulus of Triarii;

#Pilus Prior
#Pilus Posterior

Of the centuriae of a manipulus of Principes;

#Princeps Prior
#Princeps Posterior

Of the centuriae of a manipulus of Hastati;

#Hastatus Prior
#Hastatus Posterior

For the Imperial and late Republican legion (post 107 BC) the first centuria of every cohors was its senior, with the first cohors following suit for the entire legion. There were five centuriae in the first cohors as opposed to the normal number of six, with each centuria having twice the number of legionaries of a normal centuria.

The six centuriae of a normal cohors, were, in order of decreasing seniority;

# The rear triarii (rear third line)
# The forward triarii (forward third line)
# The rear principes (rear principal line)
# The forward principes (forward principal line)
# The rear hastati (rear spears)
# The forward hastati (forward spears)

The titles of the centuriae and thus their respective centuriones are remnants from the manipular system of the Republic. In order of decreasing seniority;

1st Cohors, Centuriones known as the Primi Ordines

#1st Centuria Primus Pilus
#2nd Centuria Princeps Prior
#3rd Centuria Princeps Posterior
#4th Centuria Hastatus Prior
#5th Centuria Hastatus Posterior

2nd Cohors

#1st Centuria Pilus Prior
#2nd Centuria Pilus Posterior
#3rd Centuria Princeps Prior
#4th Centuria Princeps Posterior
#5th Centuria Hastatus Prior
#6th Centuria Hastatus Posterior

and so on.

Note that the Primi Ordines of the first cohors were senior to every centurio except for their Primus Pilus and the Pili Priori of the other first centuries.

==Qualities==
According to a 5th century text on the Roman military, a centurion was required to have numerous elite traits:

Centurions had to be at least 30 years of age, literate (to read written orders), have letters of recommendation, and have at least several years of military service. As a commander, a centurion had to be able to maintain his troops’ morale in peace and inspire his men in battle.

==In the New Testament==
Matthew&#x27;s Gospel and Luke&#x27;s Gospel relate an incident in which a servant of a centurion based in Capernaum was ill. In the Gospel of Luke, the centurion concerned had a good relationship with the elders of the local Jewish population and had funded the development of the synagogue in Capernaum, and when he heard that Jesus was in the locality, he asked the Jewish elders to request healing for his servant. In the Gospel of Matthew, the centurion makes direct contact with Jesus. The stories report that Jesus marveled at his faith and restored his servant to health.

In both the Gospels of Mark and Matthew, the centurion who is present at the Crucifixion said that Jesus was &quot;God&#x27;s Son&quot;. Accordingly, this centurion is considered by many to be the first Christian. In Luke&#x27;s Gospel, the centurion at the cross said that Jesus was &quot;innocent&quot;.

The Book of Acts tells of a centurion named Cornelius whose righteous and generous acts find favor with God. The apostle Simon Peter is told in a vision to visit Cornelius, a Gentile, with whom association was not permitted under Jewish law. The encounter leads Simon Peter to understand that God accepts non-Jews who believe in God and repent. After this revelation, the message of Jesus was evangelized to the Gentiles. Another centurion, Julius, is given custody of the apostle Paul for his journey from Caesarea to Rome in Acts 27.

<doc id="1340309" wikidata="Q45185" url="?curid=1340309" title="Eusebio Kino">
<text>Eusebio Francisco Kino, SJ (, ; 10 August 1645 – 15 March 1711), often referred to as Father Kino, was an Italian Jesuit, missionary, geographer, explorer, cartographer, mathematician and astronomer born in the Bishopric of Trent, Holy Roman Empire. 

For the last 24 years of his life he worked in the region then known as the Pimería Alta, modern-day Sonora in Mexico and southern Arizona in the United States. He explored the region and worked with the indigenous Native American population, including primarily the Tohono O&#x27;Odham, Sobaipuri and other Upper Piman groups. He proved that the Baja California Territory was not an island but a peninsula by leading an overland expedition there. By the time of his death he had established 24 missions and visitas (country chapels or visiting stations).

==Early life==
Kino was born Eusebio Chini (the spelling Kino was the version for use in Spanish-speaking domains) in the village of Segno, (now part of the municipality of Predaia), then in the sovereign Prince-bishopric of Trent, a part of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1665, after his recovery from an illness, as part of a vow fulfillment, he adopted Francesco as second name, for devotion to Saint Francis Xavier.

The name is sometimes found in its Latin version (Eusebius Franciscus Chinus) or even in its originally German form (Eusebius Franz Kühn).

His parents were Francesco Chini and Margherita Luchi who belonged to the local noble families. The exact date of his birth is unknown but he was baptized on 10 August 1645 in the parish church, located in Taio. Kino was educated at the college of the Jesuits in Hall in Tirol, Austria, and after recuperating from a serious illness, he joined the Society of Jesus on 20 November 1665. From 1664 to 1669, he received religious training as a member of the Society at Freiburg, Ingolstadt, and Landsberg, Bavaria. After completing a final stage of training in the Society, during which he taught mathematics in Ingolstadt, he received Holy Orders as a priest on 12 June 1677.

Although Kino wanted to go to the Orient, he was sent to New Spain. Due to travel delays while crossing Europe, he missed the ship on which he was to travel and had to wait a year for another ship. While waiting in Cádiz, Spain, he wrote some observations, done during late 1680 and early 1681, about his study of a comet (later known as Kirch&#x27;s comet), which he published as the &quot;Exposición astronómica de el cometa&quot;. This publication was later the subject of a sonnet by the noted colonial nun and poet of New Spain, Sor (Sister) Juana Inés de la Cruz, O.S.H.

==Mission in Baja California==

Kino&#x27;s first assignment was to lead the Atondo expedition to the Baja California peninsula of Las Californias Province of New Spain. In 1683, the expedition was forced to abandon an attempted settlement and mission at La Paz because of hostilities with the natives. Later that year, he established a second settlement at Misión San Bruno. After a prolonged drought there in 1685, Kino and the Jesuit missionaries were forced to abandon the mission and return to the viceregal capital of Mexico City.

==Missions in the Pimería Alta==
Father Kino began his career in the Pimería Alta on the morning of 14 March 1687, 24 years and one day before his death on 15 March 1711. This was the morning he left Cucurpe, a town once considered the &quot;Rim of Christendom.&quot;

Once Father Kino arrived in the Pimería Alta, at the request of the natives, he quickly established the first mission in a river valley in the mountains of Sonora. Subsequently, Kino traveled across northern Mexico, and to present day California and Arizona. He followed ancient trading routes established millennia prior by the natives. These trails were later expanded into roads. His many expeditions on horseback covered over , during which he mapped an area long and wide. Kino&#x27;s maps were the most accurate maps of the region for more than 150 years after his death. Many of today&#x27;s geographical features including the Colorado River were first named by Kino. 

An influential map created by Father Kino during his mission in the Pimería Alta was titled &quot;Paso por tierra a la California y sus confinantes nuevas Naciones y Misiones nuevas de la Compañía de JHS [Jesús] en la América Septentrional&quot; (&quot;Overland Passage to California and its Contiguous New Nations and New Missions of the Society of Jesus in Northern America&quot;). It was based on thirty years of exploration and mapping, and it put an end to the idea of California as an island rather than a peninsula. Originally, in 1695, it depicted California as a peninsula but based on the presence of blue abalone shells (most likely &quot;Haliotis fulgens&quot;) from the Pacific coast in the Pimería Alta, the information from natives, and his own travels and sightings (in 1698 he ascended Cerro del Pinacate), Father Kino redrew the map in 1701. The map was printed in 1707 in Hamburg and Leipzig and became one of the best-known maps of northern New Spain. A notable colleague of Father Kino who accompanied him on one of his major travels (in 1694) and acted as the intermediary in the publication of this map and dissemination of Father Kino&#x27;s knowledge in Europe was Carniolan priest . 

Father Kino was important in the economic growth of the area, working with the already agricultural indigenous native peoples and introducing them to European seed, fruits, herbs and grains. He also taught the natives to raise cattle, sheep and goats. His initial mission herd of twenty cattle imported to Pimería Alta grew during his period to 70,000. Historian Herbert Bolton referred to Kino as Arizona&#x27;s first rancher.

===Interaction with indigenous peoples===
In his travels in the Pimería Alta, Father Kino interacted with 16 different tribes. Some of these had land that bordered on the Pimería Alta, but there are many cases where tribal representatives crossed into the Piman lands to meet Kino. In other cases, Father Kino traveled into their lands to meet with them. The tribes Kino met with are the Cocopa, Eudeve, Hia C-ed O&#x27;odham (called Yumans by Kino), Kamia, Kavelchadon, Kiliwa, Maricopa, Mountain Pima, Opata, Quechan, Gila River Pima, Seri (Comcaac), Tohono O&#x27;odham, Sobaipuri, Western Apache, Yavapai, and the Yaqui (Yoeme).

===Interests===
Kino opposed the slavery and compulsory hard labor in the silver mines that the Spaniards forced on the native people. This also caused great controversy among his co-missionaries, many of whom acted according to the laws imposed by Spain on their territory.

Kino was also a writer, authoring books on religion, astronomy and cartography. He built missions extending from the present day states of Mexican Sonora, northeast for , into present-day Arizona, where the San Xavier del Bac mission, near Tucson, a popular National Historic Landmark, is still a functioning Franciscan parish church. Kino constructed nineteen rancherías (villages), which supplied cattle to new settlements.

Kino practiced other crafts and was reportedly an expert astronomer, mathematician and cartographer, who drew the first accurate maps of Pimería Alta, the Gulf of California, and Baja California. Father Kino enjoyed making model ships out of wood. His knowledge of maps and ships led him to believe that Mexican Indians could easily access California by sea, a view taken with skepticism by missionaries in Mexico City. When Kino proposed and began making a boat that would be pushed across the Sonoran Desert to the Mexican west coast, a controversy arose, as many of his co-missionaries began to question Kino&#x27;s faculties. Kino had an unusual amount of wealth for his vocation, which he used primarily to fund his missionary activities. His contemporaries reported on his wealth with suspicion.

==Death==
Kino remained among his missions until his death. He died from fever on 15 March 1711, aged 65, in what is now Magdalena de Kino, Sonora, Mexico. A team of anthropologists and historians discovered Kino&#x27;s grave on 19 May 1966. Kino lies buried next to Father Ignacio Iturmendi and Father Manuel González. The successful discovery ended nearly forty years of failures to identify the grave site. Kino&#x27;s skeletal remains can be viewed in his crypt, which is a national monument of Mexico.

==Legacy==

Kino has been honored both in Mexico and the United States, with various towns, streets, schools, monuments, and geographic features named after him. The copper silicate mineral Kinoite is named in his honor. In 1965, a statue of Kino sculpted by artist Susanne Silvercruys was donated to the United States Capitol&#x27;s National Statuary Hall collection, one of two statues representing Arizona. A copy of this statue has been in place in front of the Arizona History Museum in Tucson, Arizona since the 1970s. Another statue (sculpted by artist Julian Martinez Soto) of him stands above Kino Parkway, a major thoroughfare in Tucson. An equestrian statue featuring Kino, donated in 1967 by the Mexican state of Sonora, stands in Wesley Bolin Memorial Plaza across from the Arizona State Capitol in Phoenix. A time capsule is encapsuled in the base. Another equestrian statue also sculpted by artist Julian Martinez Soto stands next to the Cathedral in the city of Hermosillo, Sonora, México. The towns of Bahía Kino, and Magdalena de Kino in Sonora and Ejido Padre Kino in Baja California are named in his honor. A park with a statue of Kino resides in the city of Nogales, AZ. The largest statue of Kino is located along the US–Mexico border in Tijuana, Baja California. Also a wine is named after him (Padre Kino), produced by Pernod Ricard Mexico in Hermosillo, Sonora. In 2009, Mexican and American Jesuit provinces and Catholic dioceses, the Jesuit Refugee Service, and the Missionary Sisters of the Eucharist, founded the Kino Border Initiative, a binational migrant service and advocacy organization in Nogales, Arizona and Nogales, Sonora named in his honor. A monument to Kino was erected in 2015 in the garden of Piazza Dante, just outside the historic center of Trento, Italy. In 1963, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum.

===Beatification process===
On 11 July 2020, Pope Francis advanced the cause of Kino&#x27;s sainthood by recognizing his life of heroic virtue, and declaring him Venerable.

==Missions and visitas founded==
After the first voyage of Christopher Columbus, the Catholic Church awarded to the Spanish Crown the lands of &quot;New Spain.&quot; This grant was with the directive that the Crown would underwrite the efforts to convert the pagan inhabitants to Catholicism. The lands included the Caribbean, Mexico, and portions of what is now the Southwestern United States.

In its new lands, the Spanish Crown employed three major agencies to extend its borders and consolidate its colonial presence: the presidio (royal fort), pueblo (town), and the misión (mission). In addition, there were asistencias (sub-missions or contributing chapels) which were small-scale missions that regularly conducted Divine service on days of obligation, but lacked a resident priest. Visitas (visiting chapels or country chapels) also lacked a resident priest, and were often attended only sporadically. These different types of settlements were established such that each of the installations was no more than a long day&#x27;s ride by horse or boat (or three days on foot) from one another.
Each type of frontier station needed to be self-supporting, because supply lines (roads) were non-existent. There was no way to maintain a village from outside sources. To sustain a mission settlement, the Fathers needed either Spanish colonists or converted natives to cultivate crops and tend livestock in the volume needed to support a fair-sized Church establishment. Scarcity of imported materials and lack of skilled laborers compelled the Fathers to employ simple building materials and methods.

Although the Spanish hierarchy considered the missions temporary ventures, individual settlement development was not based simply on a priestly whim. The founding of a mission followed long-standing rules and procedures. The paperwork involved required months, sometimes years of correspondence, and demanded the attention of virtually every level of the Spanish bureaucracy.

Once empowered to erect a mission in a given area, the men assigned to it chose a specific site that featured a good water supply, plenty of wood for fires and building material, and ample fields for grazing herds and raising crops. The Fathers blessed the site, and with the aid of their military escort fashioned temporary shelters out of tree limbs roofed with thatch, reeds, or in Pimería Alta saguaro ribs or ocotillo branches topped with brush and mud. These simple huts would ultimately give way to the stone and adobe buildings that exist today.

The majority of structures, indeed whole villages, were oriented on a roughly east–west axis to take the best advantage of the sun&#x27;s position for interior illumination; the exact alignment depended on the geographic features of the particular site. Directives from Spain clearly stated that villages were to be sited on the west side of any valley so that the sun would shine in the homes first thing in the morning, discouraging slothful behavior on the part of the inhabitants.

When founding a mission compound, first the spot for the church itself was selected, its position marked and then the remainder of the mission complex would be laid out. Workshops, kitchens, living quarters, storerooms, and other ancillary chambers were usually grouped in a quadrangle, inside which religious celebrations and other festive events could take place.

===List of missions===
This listing of the sites founded by Kino is not complete. Also, since names have changed over time, there appears to be some duplication. They are: 

* Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe located near present-day La Paz, Baja California, was founded in April 1683 and abandoned four months later. Kino wrote in his astronomical treatise on comets that he dedicated his missionary life to Our Lady of Guadalupe. Kino, as the King&#x27;s cartographer and surveyor, led together with Admiral Atondo the attempt to colonize the Baja California peninsula of the Las Californias Province of New Spain.
* Mission San Bruno: founded October 1683 In September 1685, after a prolonged drought there, Kino and the colonists were forced to abandon the mission.
* Mission Nuestra Señora de los Dolores: founded on 13 March, 1687. This was the first Pimería Alta mission founded by Father Kino. By 1744, the mission was abandoned.
* Mission Nuestra Señora de los Remedios de Doagibubig was founded in 1687 and was abandoned by 1730. Nothing remains of this mission.
* Mission Nuestro Padre de San Ignacio de Cabórica was founded in 1687 and is located in San Ignacio, Sonora.
* Mission San Pedro y San Pablo del Tubutama was founded in 1687, in Tubutama, Sonora.
* Mission Santa Teresa de Atil was founded in 1687, in the small town of Atil, Sonora.
* Mission Santa María Magdalena was founded in 1687, located in Magdalena de Kino, Sonora. Kino&#x27;s grave is located here.
* Mission San José de Imuris was founded in 1687, in Imuris, Sonora.
* Mission Nuestra Señora del Pilar y Santiago de Cocóspera was founded in 1689. It is located in Cocóspera, Sonora.
* Mission San Antonio Paduano del Oquitoa was founded in 1689. It is located in Oquitoa, Sonora.
* Mission San Diego del Pitiquito was founded in 1689. It is located in Pitiquito, Sonora.
* Mission San Luis Bacoancos was founded in 1691, but was soon abandoned after Apache attacks.
* Mission San Cayetano del Tumacácori was founded in 1691 at a native Sobaipuri settlement. This was southern Arizona&#x27;s first mission and Arizona&#x27;s first Jesuit mission. Later a chapel was built. (San Cayetano de Calabasas was established in a different location much later, after Kino&#x27;s time.) Sometime after the 1751 Pima Revolt the settlement and mission were moved to the opposite side of the river and became San José de Tumacácori.
* Mission San José de Tumacácori, the presently known location that is a National Historic Park. The farming land around the mission was sold at auction in 1834 and the mission was abandoned by 1840. It is now a National Monument in Tumacácori National Historical Park in Southern Arizona.
* La Misión de San Gabriel de Guevavi was founded in 1691. It became a cabecera or head mission in 1701 with the establishment of what Kino described affectionately as a &quot;neat little house and church.&quot; Through the years its name changed many times so that now it is known by the generic name referencing many saints: Mission Los Santos Ángeles de Guevavi. The chapel was initially established in a native settlement, but then was destroyed by fire, probably during an indigenous uprising. The church rebuilt in new locations twice, the final and largest one being built in 1751. Its ruins are part of Tumacácori National Historical Park.
* Mission San Lázaro was founded in 1691, but was soon abandoned after Apache attacks.
* Mission San Xavier del Bac (O&#x27;odham [Sobaipuri-O&#x27;odham]: Wa:k), 16 mi south of Tucson, Arizona, founded as a missionary location in 1692. The present building, located 1 mi from the original Kino-period location, dates from 1785. The interior is richly decorated with ornaments showing a mixture of New Spain and Native American artistic motifs. It is still used by Tohono O&#x27;odham Nation members (Wa:k community members especially) and Yaqui tribal members.
* Mission San Cosme y Damián de Tucsón: founded 1692
* Mission San Ignacio de Sonoitac: a rancheria near Tumacacori, founded 1692.
* Mission San Martín de Aribac: a rancheria 25 miles west of Tumacacori, founded before 1695
* Mission La Purísima Concepción de Nuestra Señora de Caborca: founded 1693
* Mission Santa María Suamca: founded 1693
* Mission San Valentin del Bizani: founded 1693
* Mission Nuestra Señora de Loreto y San Marcelo de Sonoyta: founded 1693
* Mission Nuestra Señora de la Ascención de Opodepe: founded 1704
==Movies==
* &quot;Father Kino, Padre on Horseback&quot; (or &quot;Mission to Glory: A True Story&quot;) starring Richard Egan as Kino, was made in 1977. The movie is available in DVD format.
* &quot;Kino: La leyenda de Padre Negro&quot; (&quot;Kino: The Legend of the Black Robe Priest&quot;) starring Enrique Rocha as Kino, was made in 1993 and was awarded the Mexican Academy of Film&#x27;s Ariel award for best original score. The movie is available in DVD format.
* Through the Wilderness on Horseback – Scientist and Missionary: The Life of Eusebio Kino, S.J. (Fr. Christof Wolf SJ, Loyola Productions Munich, 2011)

==Literature==
* In John Steinbeck&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Pearl&quot;, the protagonist is named after the missionary. It is likely this was to emphasize the long lasting cultural impact of European colonization.
* In Philip Caputo&#x27;s 2017 novel &quot;Some Rise by Sin&quot;, there is a statue to Father Kino in a Mexican churchyard. The main character, an American missionary, reflects on Kino&#x27;s life in the context of the Mexican drug wars and the present state of the Catholic Church.
* In Don Rosa&#x27;s Scrooge McDuck adventure &quot;The Dutchman&#x27;s Secret&quot; (1999), Father Kino (referred to as Eusebio Francesco Chino) is the builder of what would have become the famed Lost Dutchman&#x27;s Gold Mine.

<doc id="1340318" wikidata="Q357310" url="?curid=1340318" title="Mick Jones (The Clash guitarist)">
<text>Michael Geoffrey Jones (born 26 June 1955) is a British musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer best known as co-founder and lead guitarist of punk rock band the Clash, until his dismissal by frontman Joe Strummer in 1983. In 1984, he formed Big Audio Dynamite with Don Letts. Jones has played with the band Carbon/Silicon along with Tony James (formerly of Generation X and Sigue Sigue Sputnik) since 2002 and was part of the Gorillaz live band for a world tour in 2010–2011. In late 2011, Jones collaborated with Pete Wylie and members of the Farm to form the Justice Tonight Band.

==Early life==
Michael Geoffrey Jones was born on 26 June 1955 in Wandsworth, London, England, to a Welsh father, Tommy Jones, and a Russian Jewish mother, Renee Zegansky. He spent much of his early life living with his maternal grandmother, Stella Class, who was born in 1899 to Jewish parents in Russia and escaped the Russian pogroms by migrating to the United Kingdom. Jones&#x27; cousin is Grant Shapps, the former Conservative MP for Welwyn Hatfield. Jones went to Strand School in south London, and the West London School of Art And Design, because &quot;[he] thought that&#x27;s how you get into bands and stuff&quot;.

He started gaining recognition as a guitarist in the early 1970s with his glam rock band, the Delinquents. A short time later, he met Tony James and formed the proto-punk band London SS. By 1976, that band had broken up and remaining members Jones, Paul Simonon and Keith Levene were seeking a new direction.

==The Clash==
When Jones was 21, he and Paul Simonon were introduced to Joe Strummer by Bernie Rhodes in a squat in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush. The band rehearsed in a former railway warehouse in Camden Town and the Clash was formed. Jones played lead guitar, sang, and co-wrote songs from the band&#x27;s inception until he was fired by Strummer and Simonon in 1983. One of the songs he wrote, &quot;Train in Vain&quot;, was allegedly about Jones&#x27; relationship with Viv Albertine, guitarist of the Slits. Jones&#x27; lack of punctuality played a major role in his dismissal from the band. Jones agreed to give a rare interview about the disintegration of the Clash and the reasons behind his dismissal from &#x27;his own band&#x27; in Danny Garcia&#x27;s 2012 documentary film and book &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Clash&quot;.

For his time with the Clash, Jones, along with the rest of the band, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003.

While promoting the band&#x27;s 2013 box set, &quot;Sound System&quot;, which Jones says will be the final time he works on Clash music, he discussed the band reuniting prior to Strummer&#x27;s death.There were a few moments at the time I was up for it (Hall of Fame reunion in 2003), Joe was up for it. Paul wasn&#x27;t. And neither, probably, was Topper Headon, who didn&#x27;t wind up even coming in the end. It didn&#x27;t look like a performance was going to happen anyway. I mean, you usually play at that ceremony when you get in. Joe had passed by that point, so we didn&#x27;t. We were never in agreement. It was never at a point where all of us wanted to do it at the same time. Most importantly for us, we became friends again after the group broke up, and continued that way for the rest of the time. That was more important to us than the band.

In an October 2013 interview with BBC Radio 6 Music, Jones confirmed that Strummer did have intentions of a Clash reunion and in fact new music was being written for a possible studio album. In the months prior to Strummer&#x27;s death, Jones and Strummer began working on new music for what he thought would be the next Mescaleros studio album. Jones said &quot;We wrote a batch – we didn&#x27;t use to write one, we used to write a batch at a time – like gumbo. The idea was he was going to go into the studio with the Mescaleros during the day and then send them all home. I&#x27;d come in all night and we&#x27;d all work all night.&quot; Jones said months had passed following their work together when he ran into Strummer at an event. Jones was curious as to what would become of the songs he and Strummer were working on and Strummer informed him that they were going to be used for the next Clash album.

==General Public==

After his expulsion from the Clash, Jones was a founding member of General Public, with vocalists Dave Wakeling and Ranking Roger of the Beat. Though he is listed in the credits of the band&#x27;s 1984 debut studio album, &quot;All the Rage&quot;, as a member, Jones left General Public part way through the recording process and was replaced by Kevin White. White&#x27;s picture appears on the back cover; Jones&#x27; picture does not. Jones did play guitar on many of the album&#x27;s tracks, however, including the North American top 40 single &quot;Tenderness&quot;.

==Big Audio Dynamite==

Leaving General Public behind, in 1984 Jones formed Big Audio Dynamite with film director Don Letts, who had directed various Clash music videos and later the Clash documentary &quot;Westway to the World&quot; (2000). The band&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;This Is Big Audio Dynamite&quot;, was released the following year, with the song &quot;E=MC²&quot; getting heavy rotation in dance clubs, and both singles, &quot;Medicine Show&quot; and &quot;E=MC2&quot;, charting in the UK.

For Big Audio Dynamite&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;No. 10, Upping St.&quot; (1986), Jones reunited with Strummer. Together, the two wrote several songs on the album, including &quot;Beyond the Pale&quot;, &quot;V. Thirteen&quot;, and &quot;Sightsee M.C!&quot;; Strummer also co-produced the album. Their reunion did not last long, and following that collaboration, the two did not work together again for some time.

Big Audio Dynamite&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Tighten Up, Vol. 88&quot; (1988), featured album cover art painted by ex-Clash bassist, Paul Simonon. Shortly following its release, Jones developed chickenpox and pneumonia, and spent several months in hospital. After his recovery, Jones released one more studio album with Big Audio Dynamite, &quot;Megatop Phoenix&quot; (1989), before reshuffling the line-up, renaming the band Big Audio Dynamite II and releasing &quot;The Globe&quot; (1991) album. The BAD II line-up had an international #1 hit with their song &quot;Rush&quot;, topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock charts in the US and singles charts in Australia and New Zealand.

In 1990, Jones was featured on Aztec Camera&#x27;s song &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot;, with Roddy Frame.

The band&#x27;s line-up was reshuffled again in 1994, and they released the studio album &quot;Higher Power&quot; (1994) under the name Big Audio. In 1995, a greatest hits album, &quot;Planet B.A.D.,&quot; was released as well as a studio album called &quot;F-Punk&quot; under the original Big Audio Dynamite name. A further studio album, &quot;Entering a New Ride&quot;, was recorded in 1997, but was only released on the internet because of a disagreement with Radioactive Records, their then record label. One more &quot;best of&quot; collection, called &quot;Super Hits&quot;, was released in 1999.

Jones announced the reuniting of Big Audio Dynamite in January 2011, and they performed at the Lollapalooza music festival in 2011.

==Recent projects==
===Carbon/Silicon===
In 2002, Jones teamed up with his former London SS colleague, Generation X and Sigue Sigue Sputnik member Tony James to form a new band named Carbon/Silicon. The band has toured the United Kingdom and the United States and has performed a number of anti-fascist benefit concerts; they have also recorded four studio albums: &quot;A.T.O.M&quot; (2006), &quot;Western Front&quot; (2006), &quot;The Crackup Suite&quot; (2007) and &quot;The Carbon Bubble&quot; (2009), which were available online for free. Their first physical CD release was &quot;The News EP&quot;. The band encourage their fans to share their music on P2P networks, and allow the audio and video taping of their shows. Their first song, &quot;MPFree&quot;, is an anthem for P2P file sharing.

Similar in many respects to Jones&#x27; earlier work in Big Audio Dynamite, Carbon/Silicon aims to break the traditional approach to rock and roll. The band was described by Alan McGee as &quot;...the Stones jamming with a laptop&quot;, and they make use of samples in their recordings and live shows. The formation of the band was catalysed by the internet and P2P file sharing. The first song written by Jones and James was entitled &quot;MPFree&quot;, in which they expressed their willingness to embrace the technology of the internet and file sharing, in the interest of spreading music, rather than profit.

On seven consecutive Friday nights in January and February 2008 Carbon/Silicon played a series of gigs at the Inn on the Green, right under the Westway in Thorpe Close, between Ladbroke Grove and Portobello Road, London. As well as Carbon/Silicon there were many special guests, including appearances by Sex Pistols&#x27; Paul Cook and Glen Matlock, former Clash drummer Topper Headon and multi-instrumentalist and former Mescalero Tymon Dogg.

===Producer===
Jones has also been an occasional producer. In 1981, he produced Ellen Foley&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;. Jones was in a relationship with Foley, and co-wrote songs for the album with Strummer and Tymon Dogg. Players on the album included members of the Blockheads, Tymon Dogg and all four members of the Clash.

In 1981, Jones co-produced Ian Hunter&#x27;s studio album &quot;Short Back &#x27;n&#x27; Sides&quot; with Mick Ronson. He also provided guitars and vocals for several songs on the release. In the same year, he produced Theatre of Hate&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Westworld&quot;, released in 1982 and written by Kirk Brandon. Jones also played guitar on the title track, &quot;Do You Believe in the Westworld&quot;. Jones would also record and produce &quot;Aria of the Devil&quot; in 1982 by Theatre of Hate at Wessex Studios, which did not get released until 1998, when the master tapes were found by Kirk Brandon.

Jones is also credited with contributing guitar and vocals to &quot;Mal Bicho&quot;, the lead track of Los Fabulosos Cadillacs&#x27; tenth studio album &quot;Rey Azucar&quot; (1995).

He produced the London-based band the Libertines&#x27; debut studio album, &quot;Up the Bracket&quot; (2002); Jones stayed on to produce the band&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;The Libertines&quot; (2004). He also produced &quot;Down in Albion&quot; (2005), the debut studio album of former Libertines lead vocalist and guitarist Pete Doherty&#x27;s subsequent band, Babyshambles.

He provided the score for Nick Mead&#x27;s television film, &quot;Dice Life – the Random Mind of Luke Rhinehart&quot; (2004), a contemporary dance film created by Nick Mead and Wayne McGregor, featuring Luke Rhinehart, author of &quot;The Dice Man&quot; (1971).

At the &quot;NME&quot; Shockwave 2007 awards, Jones took to the stage and performed &quot;(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais&quot; with Primal Scream.

In 2014, he produced sibling band Kitty, Daisy &amp; Lewis&#x27; third studio album, &quot;The Third&quot; (2015).

===Gorillaz===
Jones reunited with Simonon on the title track of Gorillaz&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Plastic Beach&quot; (2010): both of them performed in the Gorillaz live band supporting &quot;Plastic Beach&quot; (2010). The band headlined the 2010 Coachella Festival, Glastonbury Festival and Festival Internacional de Benicàssim. Jones later appeared on the Gorillaz&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;The Fall&quot; (2010), on the track &quot;Amarillo&quot;.

===The Justice Tonight Band===
In late 2011, Jones agreed to play songs by the Clash live again, collaborating with Pete Wylie and members of the Farm to form the Justice Tonight Band. The band formed with the aim of promoting awareness of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign. The Justice Tonight band have been joined onstage at different gigs by several other musicians sympathetic to the cause, including Billy Bragg and Paul Simonon. Shane MacGowan joined them onstage in Phoenix Park when the Justice Tonight Band supported the Stone Roses as part of their Reunion Tour on 5 July 2012.

===The Wallflowers===
Jones collaborated with alternative rock group the Wallflowers as a guitarist and backing vocals for two tracks on their sixth studio album, &quot;Glad All Over&quot; (2012).

===Rachid Taha===
Jones was a featured guest on Rachid Taha&#x27;s ninth and final studio album, &quot;Zoom&quot; (2013), together with Brian Eno, and toured with Taha as part of the Zoom project.

===The Flaming Lips===
Jones narrated the Flaming Lips&#x27; fifteenth studio album, &quot;King&#x27;s Mouth&quot;, released on 20 April 2019, which is Record Store Day. Jones is also featured on the album&#x27;s cover artwork. The Flaming Lips&#x27; lead vocalist, Wayne Coyne, said of Jones &quot;he&#x27;s on almost every song... it really is quite unbelievable.&quot;

===The Avalanches===
Jones was featured, along with Cola Boyy, on the Avalanches&#x27; single &quot;We Go On&quot; from their third studio album, &quot;We Will Always Love You&quot; (2020).

==Musical equipment==

Jones&#x27; first guitar was a Gibson Les Paul Junior with a P-90 pickup, which he bought because Johnny Thunders used one. The Junior was his main guitar up until late 1977 or early 1978, and after that as a backup and studio guitar. Around the same time he also owned another Les Paul Junior, all black (formerly red) with a black pickguard, which was smashed at a performance in 1977. He then switched to a Gibson Les Paul Standard and later to Gibson Les Paul Custom.

Jones also occasionally played an Olympic White Fender Stratocaster (for live versions of &quot;Straight to Hell&quot;) and several Bond Electraglide guitars that were donated to him by Andrew Bond, who made the guitars. For effects Jones mainly uses MXR pedals including a Phase 100, a flanger, an analog delay and a noise gate as well as a Roland chorus or Space Echo effect. During his days with the Clash, Jones used a Marshall Plexi amplifier and occasionally a Fender Twin with a 2x12 cabinet. He later changed to a Mesa/Boogie amplifier with two Marshall 4x12 cabinets that he used throughout the rest of his career with the Clash.

==Cameos==
During the karaoke club scene in the film &quot;Code 46&quot; (2003), Jones is seen singing the Clash song &quot;Should I Stay or Should I Go&quot;.

<text>Farah Damji (born 9 October 1966), also known as Farah Dan, is a Ugandan-born British convicted criminal with multiple convictions pertaining to fraud and stalking in the United States, South Africa, and United Kingdom. In 2016, Damji was described by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; as &quot;a notorious conwoman&quot;, and by some other newspapers as &quot;London&#x27;s most dangerous woman&quot; in 2021.

== Early life ==
Damji was born in Uganda in 1966 to a multi-millionaire property developer Amir Damji and moved with her family to London in 1970. She is the niece of journalist Yasmin Alibhai-Brown (Amir&#x27;s sister); who refers to her niece&#x27;s childhood in her autobiography &quot;No Place Like Home&quot;. Damji has a borderline personality disorder and suffered addictions to cocaine and alcohol. She is married and has two children.

== Life in the United States ==
Between 1993 and 1995 Damji ran an art gallery in Manhattan and East Hampton. At that time she rented an apartment for herself. She gave the landlord a cheque she had received for $20, which she had altered to $20,000; when the cheque bounced the landlord obtained an eviction order and seized her belongings. Damji then forged the signature of the judge assigned to the case and amended the order so that she could get her belongings back.

In October 1995 Damji was sentenced to six months in Rikers Island prison, in New York, for those crimes and other crimes related to her art gallery: five counts of grand larceny, possession of a forged instrument, and altering official records. She was also ordered to pay $72,000 to her major victims and given four years&#x27; probation.

During the time Damji was on probation she allegedly committed other crimes; when a warrant for her arrest was subsequently issued she fled the U.S.

Damji then went to South Africa; there, she committed further financial crimes, for which she was deported.
== Life in the United Kingdom ==
Damji then returned to the United Kingdom where, in 2002, she founded and became the publisher and editor of the lifestyle magazine &quot;Another Generation&quot; (originally named &quot;Indobrit&quot;). In a high court trademark dispute case she lost the use of name ‘Indobrit’, which had been coined and registered as a trademark by Dr. Anjoom Mukadam, and the magazine folded after nine issues. Dozens of writers, photographers, and other contributors to the magazine were either not paid for their work or given cheques that bounced. During this time she also wrote articles for mainstream and ethnic media, including a regular column in the &quot;Birmingham Post&quot;, an article in &quot;New Statesman&quot;, and an article in &quot;The Observer&quot;. In 2006 The Independent recalled her magazines as being &quot;smart, readable and award-winning&quot;.

In October 2002 Damji stole a credit card from her nanny; she then ran up a bill on the card totalling £3,903. She was arrested for that, and then released on bail. While out on bail she stole another credit card from her business assistant; she then ran up a bill on that card totalling £1,030. She was arrested for that, and then released on bail again. In 2004, while out on bail, she stole another credit card and ran up bills on the card; she also committed other thefts.

The trial for the crimes committed during 2002–2004 was originally scheduled to be held in February 2005. However, before the trial Damji telephoned the main prosecution witness and, pretending to be from the Crown Prosecution Service, she told the witness that he did not need to attend court; consequently the witness did not turn up and the trial had to be adjourned. While the trial was adjourned, Damji stole more credit cards and committed further crimes.

On 14 May 2005 Damji was arrested, and this time bail was refused. Afterwards, a trial was held, concluding on 13 October 2005. Damji pleaded guilty to six counts of theft, 11 counts of obtaining property or services by deception, and two counts of perverting the course of justice. The thefts totaled about £50,000. Damji was sentenced to three and a half years in prison. The judge in the trial described her as &quot;thoroughly dishonest and manipulative&quot;.

Damji was temporarily released from Downview Prison, on 22 July 2006 to attend a meeting with her Open University tutor, but did not return as required that same day. She was re-arrested by police five days later, on 27 July.

While Damji was in prison she began writing her autobiography; she finished the writing shortly after her release. The book was eventually published in July 2009 under the title &quot;Try Me&quot;. In the book, Damji claims to have been rehabilitated and put her criminal past behind her.

Weeks after she was released from prison, Damji began committing further frauds. In July 2009 Damji pleaded guilty to three counts of dishonestly making false representations to Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council, which included benefit frauds of £17,000; she additionally pleaded guilty to two counts of dishonestly making false representations to landlords, which included defrauding one landlord of £7,685. On 29 January 2010, Damji was sentenced to 15 months in prison. At the trial, the judge said &quot;The level of dishonesty at every conceivable juncture is so persistent it&#x27;s the type of case I have never come across before&quot;.

In March 2011 Damji founded the company Kazuri Properties. The company claimed to have established a &quot;heroes center&quot; to help former soldiers and servicemen who ended up in prison. An investigation by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; found that the center did not exist and concluded that Damji&#x27;s aim was &quot;to take advantage of [the government&#x27;s] fund for prisoner rehabilitation schemes&quot;. The company has since been dissolved.

In September 2013 Damji founded the company Coming Home (Cardiff); she claimed that the company would assist young women in finding employment. A letter announcing the launch of the company invited people to an event at Cardiff Castle, and said that the chairman of Mears Group would be attending the event. Investigation by Wales Online, however, found that the City of Cardiff Council, which owns the Castle, was unaware of the event and had received no booking for the Castle; additionally, the chairman of Mears Group said &quot;We have no financial dealings with Ms Damji or her organisation&quot;. Damji&#x27;s company was dissolved in April 2015.

On 19 August 2016 Damji was imprisoned for five years, after being found guilty of three counts of stalking. She had been originally charged with one count of stalking, on 9 January 2014. She was released on bail shortly thereafter. While out on bail, she committed two other counts of stalking: one with the same man as for the first count, and one with a different man. She had stalked under the name Farah Dan and other aliases. The stalking of the first victim included the following: sending over 180 hoax calls and texts to him; emailing the man&#x27;s business associates and friends; inventing and blogging about false allegations of domestic abuse of his wife; sending sexually explicit material to his 16-year-old son; making threats of sexual violence involving his six-year-old daughter. (Damji had been previously accused of stalking the writer William Dalrymple, in 2004. Dalrymple notified the British police, but no criminal charges could be made because the alleged stalking occurred when Damji followed Dalrymple to India, and so was outside British jurisdiction. During the late 1990s, when Damji lived in the U.S., she allegedly &quot;terrorized several ex-lovers with a &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;-like intensity&quot;.)

In September 2017, while imprisoned at Bronzefield Prison, Damji filed a Request for Information with the Ministry of Justice. The Request was for information relating to female prisoners under the supervision of a specified member of staff at the prison. The Ministry decided to reject the Request, on the basis that the Request was vexatious. In February 2018, Damji appealed the Ministry&#x27;s decision to the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office (ICO). On 6 June 2018, the ICO upheld the Ministry&#x27;s decision, and further noted that Damji&#x27;s &quot;abusive language aimed at a specific individual suggests that [Damji] has a personal issue with the individual named in her request&quot;. On 4 July 2018, Damji appealed the ICO decision to the First-tier Tribunal; on 27 November 2018, the Tribunal dismissed her appeal.

On 19 October 2018 Damji appeared in court accused of breaching a restraining order.

In June 2021 Damji commenced legal proceedings against the National Health Service, arguing that they had failed adequate mental health services to her while she was imprisoned.

== Extradition proceedings in Ireland ==
Facing trial in London for breaching a restraining order, Damji fled to Ireland in February 2020 where she was arrested in August 2020. The High Court (Ireland) ordered her extradition back to the UK in January 2022. Damji had argued that mental health services in UK prisons were &quot;inadequate&quot; for her needs and commenced an appeal against her extradition.

<text>Dr. Sebastian Poulter, who died in 1998, was a distinguished legal scholar, and an advocate of ethnic diversity and its recognition and warning against discrimination and islamophobia.

== Early work ==
After studying law at Oxford, he qualified in 1967 as a solicitor in London. Later in 1967, he was appointed as lecturer (and later senior lecturer) in law in the University of Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland located in Lesotho. The period from 1967 to 1971 saw the establishment of Sebastian&#x27;s reputation as a dedicated teacher and the start of his long and distinguished record of research and writing, leading to seven books and some 40 articles.

His early work was about the legal system of Lesotho, especially Lesotho family law. In 1971 Sebastian was appointed lecturer at the University of Sussex and then was reader in law at the University of Southampton, where he remained until 1998. In 1977 he contributed to the drafting of Lesotho&#x27;s legislation, directed a research project and acted again as Chairman of the Pardons Committee.

== Contributions ==
He influenced the development of law in Lesotho by contributing to the establishment of a legal structure and to the training of many local lawyers.

=== England ===
In England he studied the legal and social position of ethnic minorities, covering civil liberties, family law, criminal and employment law as well as philosophical and political aspects.

The focus on ethnic minority law led to many publications, to advice and expertise being sought by the Commission for Racial Equality and the Runnymede Trust. In 1996 he contributed to debates and discussions about extending the Race Relations Act to cover discrimination on grounds of religion. In 1997 he was co-author of a report of a Commission of the Runnymede Trust on discrimination resulting from unfounded hostility to Islam (&quot;Islamophobia&quot;).

About his views, he warned both against islamophobia and against &quot;multi-cultural tolerance&#x27;&quot;, seen as a shield for oppression and injustice within the minority communities themselves. He argued that the (British and other European/Western) states had to recognize ethnic diversity in the interests of social peace, albeit within the limits of the fundamental principles of the secular democracy. Poulter also strongly condemned all forms of female genital cutting as female genital mutilation.

Starting from the &#x27;70&#x27;s, Muslim organizations in the UK requested that Muslim personal law should be formally recognized as part of the British legal system. Poulter was asked for advice in this by the British authorities. He concluded that this would be impossible for several reasons, among others that it would severely jeopardize the equal rights of women.

<doc id="1340352" wikidata="Q149996" url="?curid=1340352" title="Brotherhood of Saint Mark">
<text>The Brotherhood of Saint Mark (, Marx brothers) was the name of an organization of German swordsmen in the 16th century. 

==History==
The brotherhood originated in the 15th century, but it is not known when exactly it was founded. Hans Talhoffer may have been an early member, or even one of the founders (the lion of St Mark appears in his coat of arms in a manuscript of 1459). The earliest certain attestation dates to 1474. The group held an annual meeting in Frankfurt, where they elected their captain (&quot;Hauptmann&quot;). In 1487, Frederick III granted them the monopoly on the title &quot;master of the long sword&quot; (&quot;Meister des langen Schwerts&quot;), effectively making them a fencers&#x27; guild. This title was relevant for the Landsknechts, because a certified &quot;master of the long sword&quot; wielding the Zweihänder was entitled to twice the pay of a normal soldier (Doppelsöldner).

The earliest reference to the brotherhood calls them the brotherhood of Our dear lady and pure Virgin Mary and the Holy and warlike heavenly prince Saint Mark (). After their recognition by Frederick, the brotherhood was usually referred to as &quot;Marxbrüder&quot;, &quot;Bruderschaft des heiligen Marren&quot; or &quot;Bruderschaft des St. Markus&quot; (&quot;Marx brothers&quot;, &quot;Brotherhood of St. Mark&quot;).

Anton Rast (captain in 1522) was a known member of the brotherhood. Woodcuts, some of them by Albrecht Dürer, and other references, show that more than just rapier use was taught by the Marxbrüder. They also taught the use of the Zweihänder (as mentioned above), the dussack, the spear, the quarterstaff and the longsword. The dussack, being primarily a practice weapon, was used to train the real-life use of single-edged swords like the langes Messer.

A second fencing brotherhood, the &quot;Federfechter&quot;, was founded in Prague in 1570, and recognized by the city of Frankfurt, in spite of protests by the Marx brothers, in 1575. From 1607 the two societies shared equal privileges, as in that year, the Federfechter received their first letter of privilege from Rudolph II, the Holy Roman Emperor.

A third guild may have been &quot;Lukasbrüder&quot; (brotherhood of Saint Luke). They had no official recognition, however, and were probably closer to a society of hooligans than to a proper guild.

Important centers of 16th century martial arts in Germany were Frankfurt, Augsburg and Nuremberg.

<text>SIMO TCI was a computer expo held every November in Madrid, Spain from 1961 to 2013. Its name stands for &quot;Salón Internacional de Mobiliario de Oficina / Tecnologías de la Comunicación e Información&quot; (International Trade Fair of Office Furniture / Information and Communication Technologies), due to its origin. From 1991, it took place in Madrid&#x27;s Exhibition Centre IFEMA.

== History ==
It was conceived as a trade fair devoted to office furniture and its first edition was held in 1961. In 1962 the IBM 1401 and Bull Gamma 60 where showcased, and as electronic, computer and telecommunications equipment were being introduced, the trade fair was gradually turned into a computer expo, to the extent that it would end up moving office furniture to a separate fair. Since 1969, there was more space devoted to computers that to office furniture, but until the late 1980s there was some exhibition space devoted to office furniture.

In its most successful years from late 1990s to early 2000s, it was considered the second largest computer fair in Europe after CeBIT, as more than 900 exhibitors were present, distributed in 65,000 m2 taking up eight IFEMA pavilions, and reaching up 300,000 visitors.

In the late 2000s the number of exhibitors started to decline. This led to the cancellation of the 2008 edition. In 2009 was resumed as &quot;SIMO Network&quot;, devoted exclusively to business-oriented computing and IT professionals, but this approach wasn&#x27;t successful and the last SIMO TCI took place in 2013.

Taking advantage of the name, &quot;SIMO Educación&quot; (SIMO Education) was started in 2014 by IFEMA, devoted only to educational technologies and a much smaller scope (taking up only one pavilion and reaching up about 10,000 visitors).

<doc id="1340356" wikidata="Q1008390" url="?curid=1340356" title="Nowy Korczyn">
<text>Nowy Korczyn is a small town in Busko County, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship, in southern Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Nowy Korczyn. It lies in Lesser Poland, approximately south of Busko-Zdrój and south of the regional capital Kielce. It is located close to the confluence of the Nida and the Vistula rivers.

==History==
The town was known as Nowe Miasto Korczyn (&quot;New Town Korczyn&quot;). During its existence, Nowy Korczyn was also known as &quot;Khadash&quot;, &quot;Nayshtut&quot;, &quot;Neustadt&quot;, &quot;Novi Kochin&quot;, and &quot;Novi Kortchin&quot;. It was established before 1258 by Boleslaus the Chaste, and used to be an important trade and political center. From the 15th century onwards the General Assembly of Lesser Poland was held there. In the 17th century the town began a decline, and lost its town status in 1869. Up until the Second World War, Nowy Korczyn, by now a village, had a large Jewish community, many of whose members were murdered in the Holocaust.

===Early history===
In the Middle Ages, Nowy Korczyn was a trade village, located on a junction of busy merchant roads from Kraków to Kievan Rus&#x27;, and from Kosice to Sandomierz. To distinguish it from the nearby village of Korczyn (now known as &quot;Stary Korczyn&quot;, &quot;Old Korczyn&quot;), Prince Boleslaus V the Chaste named the town &quot;Nowe Miasto Korczyn&quot; (&quot;New Town Korczyn&quot;), when he granted it Magdeburg rights (1258). In 1257, when the Duke stayed here with his wife Kinga of Poland, the pious couple decided to found a Franciscan abbey in Nowy Korczyn. The town quickly developed, due to its location, and proximity both to the Vistula waterway and the city of Kraków, where local princes resided during the fragmentation of Poland (see History of Poland during the Piast dynasty). It had a wooden castle, which, together with the town, was burned by the Rus warriors in 1300. New, stone castle was built here in the 1350s by King Casimir III the Great, and it quickly emerged as one of the major royal residences in Poland. A defensive wall was built around Nowy Korczyn, furthermore the town was protected by a man-made lake &quot;Czartoria&quot;.

Since Nowy Korczyn is located in the center of Lesser Poland, the town was frequently visited by Polish rulers. It was an important political and judicial center of the province, here Lesser Poland&#x27;s szlachta organized its meetings. In 1404, King Władysław Jagiełło called such a meeting, to discuss new taxes, needed for the planned purchase of the Dobrzyń Land from the Teutonic Knights. In 1438, also in Korczyn, the szlachta convened to discuss whether King Jagiełło should accept the Bohemian crown. On April 25 of the same year, powerful Cardinal Zbigniew Oleśnicki, who opposed Polish alliance with Czech Hussites, called a Confederation here. In 1439, Polish supporters of the Hussites gathered near Nowy Korczyn, under Spytek of Melsztyn. On 4 May 1439 the royal army under Oleśnicki defeated the Hussites in the Battle of Grotniki.

In the 15th century, several important meetings and events took place at the Nowy Korczyn castle. In 1461, King Casimir IV Jagiellon hosted here envoys of George of Poděbrady, the Crimean Khanate, and the Margraviate of Brandenburg, and in 1465, szlachta of both Lesser and Greater Poland gathered here to discuss finances needed to end the Thirteen Years&#x27; War. In 1470, Casimir IV Jagiellon met at the Nowy Korczyn castle with papal legate and envoy of Emperor Frederick III. On 9 October 1479 Martin Truchseß von Wetzhausen, Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, paid homage to the Polish king at Nowy Korczyn.

===Flourishing regional center===

In the Kingdom of Poland, Nowy Korczyn was one of the most important administrative centers of the vast province of Lesser Poland. Here Lesser Poland sejmiks took place, in which regional senators and deputies of the Sejm met to discuss and coordinate their policies. The Nowy Korczyn sejmiks included representatives from Kraków Voivodeship, Sandomierz Voivodeship, Lublin Voivodeship, Podole Voivodeship, and Volhynian Voivodeship. Furthermore, the town was the seat of a starosta (one of six &quot;starostas&quot; of Sandomierz Voivodeship), and the seat of court for the Wiślica and Pilzno counties.

In 1474 most of Nowy Korczyn burned in a fire, after which the town was released from its tax duties for 12 years. In 1549, King Sigismund II Augustus funded a hospital, and at that time, Korczyn was a major beer producer, with 19 small breweries. Furthermore, it had waterworks and baths, built in 1578 with permission of King Stephen Bathory. Eight times a year grain markets were organized, and the grain purchased in Nowy Korczyn was transported along the Vistula to Gdańsk. Korczyn had a number of granaries, in 1566 a new town hall was built, and in 1568 a canal was completed, which connected the man-made lake &quot;Czartoria&quot; with the Nida river. In 1589, a weapon manufacturer was opened in Nowy Korczyn, producing gunpowder, cannons and rifles.

===Decline and partisions===
The importance of the town diminished in the early 17th century, after the capital of the Commonwealth was moved from Kraków to Warsaw. In 1606, during the Zebrzydowski Rebellion, Korczyn was ransacked by the rebels, and in 1607, almost whole town with its 266 houses burned in a fire. Further and complete destruction came during the Swedish invasion of Poland, when in 1657 the town was burned to the ground, together with its extensive archives. In 1702, during the Great Northern War, Swedish troops destroyed Korczyn once again, and the town never recovered since then.

After the Partitions of Poland, Nowy Korczyn briefly belonged to the Austrian Empire. After the Polish victory in the Austro-Polish War of 1809, it became part of the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw, and after the duchy&#x27;s dissolution in 1815, it was part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland. Nowy Korczyn burned in 1811, 1855 and 1857, the town was also frequently flooded both by the Vistula and the Nida. In 1860, Nowy Korczyn had the population of 3,319, including 2,370 Jews. In 1869 Russian authorities stripped it of the town charter as punishment for the unsuccessful Polish January Uprising.

===20th century===
During World War I, in September 1914, Nowy Korczyn was the area where Polish Legions operated. Here the headquarters of Józef Piłsudski was briefly stationed, and after the war, the village belonged to Kielce Voivodeship. In the Second Polish Republic it remained a poor village, with a significant Jewish population.
Following the German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, it was occupied by Germany. In 1942, the Jews of Nowy Korczyn were deported to the Treblinka extermination camp and murdered. Concerning the deportation of the Jews of Nowy Korczyn, a witness stated the following: &quot;In the night of November 2. in 1942 Nowy Korczyn was surrounded by the German military and two Ukrainian units. The Jews of the town were chased to the town square - or rather a market place in the centre of the town. There could have been 2000 Jews or 3000 or more, I don&#x27;t know, different figures are mentioned. However, all the Jews of Nowy Korczyn were deported [...]&quot;. In 1944, during Operation Tempest, units of the Home Army attacked German police post in Nowy Korczyn. The synagogue of Nowy Korczyn has been under preservation since 2014.

==Transport==
Nowy Korczyn does not have a train station. The town is located at the intersection of National Road Nr 79 (Warsaw - Bytom), and local road nr. 973, which goes from Tarnów to Busko. The Borusowa Ferry, a reaction cable ferry, crosses the River Vistula between Borusowa and Nowy Korczyn.

<text>Best of the Beast was Iron Maiden&#x27;s first &quot;best of&quot; album, released in 1996 in three formats: a 34 track (four disc) vinyl, a 27 track (two disc) CD, a 16 track (single disc) CD and MiniDisc. The vinyl edition is, to date, the band&#x27;s longest record release, running for over three hours.

==Background==

The track listing differs slightly between the various editions of the compilation album, but consists mainly of the band&#x27;s singles and most well-known songs from their 1980–1995 albums. Also included are a new single, entitled &quot;Virus&quot;, as well as previously unreleased live versions of &quot;Afraid to Shoot Strangers&quot; and &quot;Revelations&quot; (the latter exclusive to the vinyl edition). Both &quot;Virus&quot; and &quot;Afraid to Shoot Strangers&quot; had promotional music videos created, the latter of which was filmed during The X Factour with new lead vocalist Blaze Bayley replacing Bruce Dickinson, who sang the original studio recording.

The two-CD edition contains two songs from the band&#x27;s 1979 demo tape/EP &quot;The Soundhouse Tapes&quot; (&quot;Iron Maiden&quot; and &quot;Strange World,&quot; of which the latter was previously unreleased). The 4-disc vinyl pressing, meanwhile, contains the entire &quot;Soundhouse Tapes&quot; EP on its final side, again with the addition of &quot;Strange World&quot; from the same sessions. The vinyl edition has become quite rare and has increased in value steadily over the years in music stores and on online auction sites. The standard edition&#x27;s value has not changed much although the Japanese pressings continue to rise in value.

&quot;Best of the Beast&quot; has long since been out of print and has been &quot;replaced&quot; by &quot;Edward the Great&quot; in most countries as a greatest hits package for the band.

The cover art was designed by Derek Riggs, known for having created most of Iron Maiden&#x27;s early album covers. It is an amalgamation of his most famous works with the band, featuring Eddies from the &quot;Piece of Mind&quot;, &quot;Powerslave&quot;, &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; and &quot;No Prayer for the Dying&quot; eras, as well as those from &quot;The Trooper&quot;, &quot;Live After Death&quot; and a redesign of the &quot;Killers&quot; album cover.

<doc id="1340376" wikidata="Q9026969" url="?curid=1340376" title="Mahavishnu">
<text>Mahavishnu () is an aspect of Vishnu, the principal deity in Vaishnavism. In his capacity as Mahavishnu, the deity is known as the Supreme Purusha, the absolute protector and sustainer of the universe, the one who is beyond human comprehension, and all attributes.

== Literature ==
The Bhagavata Purana, among the most revered texts among Vaishnavas, attributes the following qualities to Mahavishnu:

 According to Gaudiya tradition of Bhagavatam, Krishna is the Supreme Being, who expands first as Balarama, then into the first quadruple expansion of Sankarshana, Vasudeva, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha. Sankarshana expands into Narayana, then Narayana expands into the second quadruple expansion of Sankarshana, Vasudeva, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha, then Sankarshana expands into Karanodakasayi-Visnu (Maha-Vishnu), who reclines within the Mahat-Tattva, creating innumerable universes from the pores on his body. He then expands into each universe as Garbhodakasayi-Vishnu, from which Brahma emerges. Here, the first expansion Purusha is used interchangeably for Mahavishnu. From sattva emerges Vishnu (Garbhodakshayi), and from tamas arises Shankara. These are known as the guna avatars of Krishna.

== Role ==
Mahavishnu is said to lie in the Causal Ocean, or the Garbhodaka. According to Vaishnava cosmogony, he puts the seed of this material universe in Mahamaya by glancing at her. Mahamaya remains the ever obedient material energy of Vishnu. All the natural elements including sky, fire, water, air and land are created along with mind, intelligence and false ego.

After this, Mahavishnu enters each of the many universes so created (seeds emerging from the pores of His skin) as Garbhodaksayi Vishnu, who lays down in each and every of these individual material universes (Brahmanas). It can be interpreted that Garbodakshayi Vishnu is the collective soul of all souls in a particular material universe, and that Mahavishnu is the collective soul of all souls in all of the material universes.

From Garbhodaksayi Vishnu then emerges Brahmā, who is the secondary creator (due to his need to meditate to create planets in the material universe) of the planetary systems within this material universe (Brahmanda).

The Robot Hall of Fame describes the phrase as &quot;one of the most famous commands in science fiction&quot; and Frederick S. Clarke of &quot;Cinefantastique&quot; called it &quot;the most famous phrase ever spoken by an extraterrestrial.&quot;

==Usage in the film==
Edmund H. North, who wrote &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;, also created the alien language used in the film, including the phrase &quot;Klaatu barada nikto&quot;. The official spelling of the phrase comes directly from the script.

The phrase was never translated in the film and neither Edmund North nor 20th Century Fox ever released an official translation.

Near the end of the film, as Klaatu is pursued by the U.S. Armed Forces, he urges Helen Benson to memorize the phrase, saying &quot;There&#x27;s no limit to what he can do. He could destroy the Earth... If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort; you must say these words: &#x27;Klaatu barada nikto.&#x27; Please repeat that.&quot;

Shortly after, Klaatu is shot and killed. Knowing that Klaatu has died, Gort vaporizes the polymer cube encasing him and kills the two soldiers standing guard. Helen conveys Klaatu&#x27;s message. Gort takes her inside the spaceship, and then retrieves Klaatu&#x27;s lifeless body, which he revives.

In the 2008 remake, the line was added at Keanu Reeves&#x27; insistence. Klaatu uses it near the beginning of the film to shut down Gort, and again at the end, highly distorted and barely audible, when he stops the destruction of the Earth.

==Interpretation==
Because there is no official translation of the phrase, a few notable attempts have been made to determine the phrase&#x27;s meaning:

Philosophy professor Aeon J. Skoble speculates the phrase is part of a fail-safe feature used during diplomatic missions, whereby Gort&#x27;s deadly force can be deactivated in the event the robot is undesirably triggered into a defensive posture. Skoble observes that this theme has evolved into a &quot;staple of science fiction that the machines charged with protecting us from ourselves will misuse or abuse their power.&quot; In this interpretation the phrase apparently tells Gort that Klaatu considers escalation unnecessary (stand down and return home).

&quot;Fantastic Films&quot; explored the meaning of &quot;Klaatu barada nikto&quot; in the 1978 article &quot;The Language of Klaatu&quot;. In the article Tauna Le Marbe, the magazine&#x27;s Alien Linguistics Editor, attempts to translate all the alien words Klaatu used throughout the film. Le Marbe&#x27;s literal translation was &quot;Stop Barbarism, (I have) death, bind;&quot; the free translation was &quot;I die, repair me, do not retaliate.&quot;

The documentary &quot;Decoding &quot;Klaatu Barada Nikto&quot;: Science Fiction as Metaphor&quot; examined the phrase &quot;Klaatu barada nikto&quot; with some of the people involved with &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;. Robert Wise, director of the original, recalled a conversation he had with Edmund North, saying North told him, &quot;...it&#x27;s just something I kind of cooked up. I thought it sounded good.&quot;

Billy Gray, who played Bobby Benson in the film, said that &quot;barada nikto must mean... save Earth&quot;. Florence Blaustein, widow of the producer Julian Blaustein, said North had to pass a street called Baroda every day going to work and said, &quot;I think that&#x27;s how that was born.&quot; Film historian Steven Jay Rubin recalled an interview he had with North when he asked the question, &quot;What is the direct translation of &#x27;Klaatu barada nikto?&#x27; And Edmund North said to me, &#x27;There&#x27;s hope for Earth, if the scientists can be reached.&#x27;&quot;

In accepting the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1998, Director Robert Wise closed his remarks by saying, &quot;...I&#x27;d like to say &#x27;Klaatu barada nikto&#x27;, which, roughly translated tonight, means &#x27;Thank you very much from the bottom of my heart.&#x27;&quot;

==Popular culture references==

* In the 1983 film &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, one of Jabba the Hutt&#x27;s employees is &quot;Barada&quot;, a member of the &quot;Klatooinian&quot; species, both the character and the species being references to the phrase. In the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe, there is also a species called &quot;Nikto&quot;. Another of Jabba the Hutt&#x27;s employees is a character named &quot;Klaatu&quot;, himself a member of the &quot;Nikto&quot; species.
* In the 1984 stage play &quot;The Foreigner&quot;, the lead character is Charlie Baker, a science fiction proofreader on holiday. He mentions the phrase early in the play, and then during the climactic confrontation makes use of it as a way to sound otherworldly and threatening.
* In the 1987 animated series episode of &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; titled &quot;Invasion of the Turtle Snatchers,&quot; Donatello meets an alien family with the father&#x27;s name Klaatu, mother Barada, and son Nikto.
* In the 1992 film &quot;Army of Darkness&quot;, Ash Williams must correctly recite the phrase in order to safely retrieve the &quot;Necronomicon&quot;. Later in the film, he must precisely recite it again to travel back to his time period. Both times the pronunciation was mangled and resulted in unexpected outcomes
* Willie Nile uses the phrase in the bridge of his song &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; from his 2021 album of the same name.
* In the 2022 film &quot;Sonic the Hedghehog 2&quot;, Doctor Eggman recites the phrase before manually activating a trap that dispatches an alien visitor to facilitate his escape from a deserted planet.

<doc id="1340384" wikidata="Q2367710" url="?curid=1340384" title="Twins (The Matrix)">
<text>The Twins (played by identical twins: Neil and Adrian Rayment) are fictional characters in the 2003 film &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;. Henchmen of the Merovingian, they are &quot;Exiles&quot;, or rogue programs that have chosen to hide in the Matrix rather than face deletion. 

The Twins have the power of intangibility: they can take on a translucent state in which they pass through physical objects such as floors or gunfire, float through the air, and instantly reset any physical damage to their bodies or clothing. They are also the &#x27;ghosts&#x27; the Oracle explains while talking to Neo before the &#x27;Burly Brawl&#x27;. In other words, their abilities as programs were still usable in exile.

==Story==
The Twins are first seen with the Merovingian smoking a hookah in his restaurant in &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;. They smirk at the fact that neither Trinity, nor Morpheus, nor Neo appear to have the same intellect as does the Merovingian. The Twins rarely speak, but when they do so, it is with a slow-paced English accent, and when one speaks to the other, they usually say &quot;we&quot;, as opposed to &quot;I&quot;.

Later, when Morpheus and crew free the Keymaker, the Merovingian sends the Twins to kill the &#x27;Redpills&#x27; and recapture the Keymaker. They encounter Morpheus and Trinity in a parking garage and quickly demonstrate both their skill in hand-to-hand combat (using a straight razor) and their ability to become incorporeal, passing through bullets and walls harmlessly and healing injuries that they sustain while in corporeal form. Morpheus, Trinity, and the Keymaker flee in a Cadillac CTS, but they are pursued first by the Twins, then by police and by agents.

Eventually, after a long chase along the freeway and firing upon Morpheus and company with an HK UMP, the Twins are dispatched by Morpheus when he causes their Cadillac Escalade EXT to overturn and explode. The explosion sends them into the air and they are last seen turning intangible. They are not seen in &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;. Following Smith’s takeover of the Matrix, the Twins might have been assimilated by Smith along with everyone else in the Matrix, and after Neo sacrifices himself to get rid of Smith, and the machines rebooted the Matrix, the Twins most likely returned to their service of The Merovingian.

==Video game==
In the &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot; video game, which chronicles the events leading up to &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, the twins are shown attempting to stop Niobe and Ghost from escaping the Merovingian&#x27;s mansion via a car chase in the multi-leveled garage. In this incarnation of the characters they do not wear their trademark glasses. Their smoking, overturned vehicle can be briefly seen on an overpass at one point during the highway chase level.

==Online==
In &quot;The Matrix Online&quot;, synthesised cheat codes based on those drunk by the Unlimit officer Beirn allowed the Merovingian to retrieve and reforge the fragmented and heavily dissipated RSIs of the Twins. His operatives were tasked with finding the partially reconstructed pieces, which were successfully secured and combined, returning the Twins to fully functional states.

==Controversy==
At the time of the release of &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, there was some controversy from people who saw the Twins as emblematic of Hollywood&#x27;s negative portrayal of characters with albinism. Several major media outlets (e.g. &quot;USA Today&quot;, MSNBC) reported on the story, and it was mentioned in a joke by late-night talk show host Jay Leno: &quot;When is the establishment going to give the &quot;really&quot; white man a break?&quot; Film studio Warner Bros. responded to the controversy, with a spokesperson saying, &quot;It&#x27;s not our intention to single out any group of people as villains&quot;, and &quot;It was never our intention to position these characters as albinos&quot;, noting that the Twins have black eyebrows.

<doc id="1340391" wikidata="Q1753069" url="?curid=1340391" title="Edward the Great">
<text>Edward the Great: The Greatest Hits is Iron Maiden&#x27;s third &quot;best-of album&quot;, originally released on 4 November 2002. Unlike the band&#x27;s other works by the group collecting together songs from different albums, such as &quot;Best of the Beast&quot;, &quot;Edward the Great&quot; does not feature any material from the group&#x27;s first two albums, which featured Paul Di&#x27;Anno as vocalist, but does include material from Blaze Bayley&#x27;s five-year tenure with the band.

==Background==
According to Mick Wall, the collection was controversial amongst fans as it was released not long after previous compilations such as &quot;Best of the Beast&quot; and &quot;Ed Hunter&quot;. Bassist and founder member Steve Harris comments, &quot;We did get a bit of flak for the &quot;Edward the Great&quot; album but it wasn&#x27;t aimed at the hardcore fan, it was aimed at the peripheral people who&#x27;ve heard the name or seen the name on a T-shirt and wouldn&#x27;t know which record to pick up.&quot; To satisfy &quot;the real collector&quot;, the band released the &quot;Eddie&#x27;s Archive&quot; box set simultaneously.

In 2005, a revised edition was released in Europe, Asia and South America with an updated track-listing. The new version coincided with the release of &quot;The Essential Iron Maiden&quot; compilation, released solely in North America, and featured songs from the &quot;Dance of Death&quot; album as well as an alternate live version of &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot;. The updated CD also added the song &quot;Brave New World&quot; from the album of the same name and the booklet included a new foreword by Iron Maiden manager Rod Smallwood, replacing the original foreword by founding member Steve Harris. The album cover does not differentiate between the two editions.

<text>Suzanne Riccio-Major (born October 16, 1963), also known as Suzanne Riccio, is a former female boxer who fought two times for world titles. She also competed against many of women&#x27;s boxing top fighters.

Riccio-Major was born in Pittsfield, Massachusetts in 1963. She began her career in professional boxing at the age of twenty-six, when she and Andrea Buchanan drew (tied) after five rounds on November 1, 1989, at Bristol, Tennessee. Riccio Major obtained her first victory, a five-round decision win over Stacey Prestage, on her second bout, held on November 17, 1990, in Fort Myers, Florida.

For her third bout, held on February 25, 1991, also at Bristol, she met young rising star Christy Martin, who dealt Riccio her first loss, beating her by a five-round decision.

Riccio then took five years away from boxing, deciding to return during the dawn of the often called &quot;golden era of women&#x27;s boxing&quot;, when she took on Sue Chase on June 3, 1996, at Warrensville Heights, Ohio. The then thirty-three-year-old Riccio won by a five-round decision. On July 27, she lost to Theresa Arnold by an eight-round decision at Rochester, Washington.

On January 17, 1997, Riccio-Major earned her first, and only, professional boxing knockout win, when she defeated Patricia Simms in the first round, at Waukegan, Illinois.

After that victory, she was offered her first shot at a world championship, when she met Cheryl Robertson, on February 3, for the WIBF&#x27;s world bantamweight title. Riccio-Major lost by a ten-round decision, in New Orleans.

Immediately after that title shot, Riccio-Major was offered another world title try, when she fought with the IFBA world Flyweight champion. Yvonne Trevino, in Biloxi. Once again, she lost by a ten-round decision.

After that defeat, she scored three wins in a row, two against Karina Hernandez Gastelum. She suffered, however, a three fight losing streak after those three wins, being defeated by &quot;Downtown Leona Brown&quot; on points, by Trevino in a rematch which saw both women go down, by Tko in five rounds, when referee, the late Mitch Halpern stepped in for no apparent reason. a ref not wanted by the major team [ex Husband/Trainer, William Major] initially for his anti women boxing views. Trevino and her manager Jackie Kallen promised a rematch which never materialized and to Kathy Williams in her only fight abroad, on points. The fight with Williams was held in Canada.

On July 28, 2000, she got her last career win, beating Larissa Smith in Boston by a six-round decision. After losing to Jamillia Lawrence by knockout in two rounds on August 25 of that year in Saratoga Springs, New York, she retired from boxing in 2001.

Riccio-Major had 7 wins, 8 losses some controversial and one draw in professional boxing, with one win by knockout.

<text>Moneen (sometimes stylised as .moneen.) is a Canadian indie rock band from Brampton, Ontario.

==History==
Moneen formed in 1999 after the dissolution of another band, called Perfectly Normal. The founding members were singer/guitarist Kenny Bridges, bassist Mark Bowser, drummer Peter Krpan and singer/guitarist Chris Hughes.

The band recorded their first EP &quot;Smaller Chairs for the Early 1900s&quot; in Kenny&#x27;s basement. They then re-released it on Smallman Records with their second album &quot;The Theory of Harmonial Value&quot;, the band&#x27;s next release was &quot;Are We Really Happy with Who We Are Right Now&quot; in 2003. The album appeared on the !earshot National Top 50 chart in August, 2003.

Bowser was replaced by Chris Slorach (Nu Chris), who left the band after the release of &quot;The Theory of Harmonial Value&quot;. Erik Hughes (who played bass for the band on their first Canadian tour) later became the permanent bass player for the band.

In 2003 the band&#x27;s lineup was Bridges, Krpan, and Chris and Erik Hughes. That year they performed in Austin.

Moneen later signed to Vagrant Records. Smallman Records still distributes their albums in Canada. In 2005 they released a split EP with friends Alexisonfire on Dine Alone Records, on which each band covered two of the other&#x27;s songs, plus one original song.

In 2005, director Alex Liu followed the band through the recording process for &quot;The Red Tree&quot;, filming a documentary entitled &quot;The Start to This May Be the End to Another&quot;. &quot;The Red Tree&quot; was released on April 11, 2006, on CD and vinyl. The vinyl release of The Red Tree was limited to 300 copies. The band joined the 2006 Warped Tour to promote the album. The documentary was released as part of &quot;The Moneen DVD: It All Started with a Red Stripe&quot; on May 13, 2008. The DVD had been nominated for a Juno Award for Music DVD of The Year.

In March 2008, Moneen parted ways with their drummer Peter Krpan, who decided to start a solo project named One Grand Canyon; the band recruited drummer Steve Nunnaro as a permanent replacement.

Moneen began recording their fourth studio album &quot;The World I Want to Leave Behind&quot; in December 2008; it was released September 15, 2009 with Dine Alone Records. They released it on CD and vinyl. The vinyl release had a bonus track called &quot;Dark &amp; Ugly&quot;. The band went on tour in the United States to support the album, including a stop in Los Angeles at the Troubadour.

In 2010, Peter Krpan re-joined Moneen as the permanent drummer. The band opened for several dates on Alexisonfire&#x27;s farewell tour in December 2012, however the band had performed very little throughout 2012 and after 2013 were in hiatus. Krpan, along with Chris and Eric Hughes, formed a new band in 2013 named Seas, signed a deal with Black Box Music, and went out on tour. Bridges joined a band called Cunter, worked as the guitar tech for The Sheepdogs, toured with Say Anything on guitar, and released an EP in August 2015 &quot;Love and Hate&quot;.

In 2016, Moneen performed in Mississauga, Ontario at Cuchulainn&#x27;s Irish Pub.

In 2017 the band played a four-date tour leading up to the 10th anniversary of The Red Tree, held at Lee&#x27;s Palace in Toronto.

In January 2019, the band played three shows at the Phoenix Concert Theatre in Toronto to celebrate the 15th anniversary of &quot;Are We Really Happy with Who We Are Right Now&quot;. In April 2019, Alexisonfire announced that Moneen would be supporting then for one date in July 2019, describing Moneen as the &quot;Siegfried to Alexisonfire’s Roy&quot;.

In May 2023, Moneen announced an upcoming Canadian tour for the fall of 2023. The eight show tour is a 20th anniversary tour for Are We Really Happy With Who We Are Right Now and will be supported by Sparta who will be celebrating the 20th anniversary of their album Wiretap Scars.

<doc id="1340401" wikidata="Q631231" url="?curid=1340401" title="Margate, South Africa">
<text>Margate is a coastal resort town in the KwaZulu-Natal province, about 20 kilometres (12.4 mi) south-west of Port Shepstone and 127 kilometres (78.9 mi) south-west of Durban. The river which flows into the sea at Margate is called &quot;Nkhongweni&quot; &quot;(place of entreaty)&quot; as the original inhabitants of the area were reputed to be so mean resulting in travellers begging for hospitality.

Located on the Hibiscus Coast, part of the South Coast of KwaZulu-Natal, Margate is one of the major hubs for tourists who are looking to visit the eastern coastline of South Africa.

==History==
In 1908, Henry Richardson, an English surveyor laid out the town and named it Margate after another seaside resort on the northern coast of the county of Kent, in the United Kingdom.

Margate hit the world headlines in 1922 (although this date is often disputed and stated as 1924) when an enormous, white, furry creature (dubbed &quot;Trunko&quot; due to it having an elephantine trunk) was washed up on the beach. The &quot;Margate monster&quot; was too decomposed to be identified.

==Geography==
=== Topography ===
Margate&#x27;s terrain is relatively undulating, rising toward the west where Margate Airport, the town&#x27;s highest point, sits at an altitude of approximately 152 m (499 ft).

===Suburbs===
The 2011 census divided the urban area of Margate into 14 “sub places” including: 
*Beacon Rocks
*Lawrence Rocks
*Manaba Beach
*Margate (Proper) 
** also encompasses Margate Extensions 3 and 7, Gayridge Agricultural Holdings and the KwaMasinenge Informal Settlement
*Margate Beach
*Margate North Beach

Margate is primarily served by Hibiscus Mall, the town&#x27;s largest shopping centre, located on Wartski Drive. Other shopping options include Emoyeni Centre, Margate Centre, and Margate Mall (also known as Shoprite Centre). For a wider variety, residents often visit Shelly Beach, home to two of the South Coast&#x27;s largest malls: Shelly Centre and Southcoast Mall. 

===Tourism===
Margate is largely a tourist town, owing to its subtropical climate, beaches, and hospitality industry with the bulk of the town&#x27;s earnings coming from tourism. There is a wide range of holiday accommodation in the area including hotels such as Margate Hotel and Desroches Hotel, holiday apartments along the coast, self-contained units and holiday houses for rent. 

Margate is popularly known for its good beaches, especially its main beach, which is accredited with the international Blue Flag status. The Margate Central Business District (CBD) situated between the main road, Marine Drive and the main beach is a lively area filled with many restaurants, pubs, and nightclubs.

Margate is busiest during school and public holidays when inland residents travel to the coast. Christmas and Easter are especially busy times, with Marine Drive often clogged with heavy traffic during these times.

Margate is one of the most visited tourist destinations in South Africa and had the third highest inflow of new visitors in December 2019 in South Africa after Plettenberg Bay and Mossel Bay, both in the Western Cape Province meaning that Margate had the highest inflow of new visitors in December 2019 in the KwaZulu-Natal Province.

<text>archaeology 


The Vedavathi is a river in India. It originates from the Bababudanagiri Mountains of Western Ghats and flows through the states of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The Vedavathi is also called the Hagari in Bellary District of Karnataka and parts of Andhra Pradesh. Two rivers, the Veda and Avathi, arise in the eastern part of the Sahyadri Hill range in Bababudangiri mountain ranges, flow east, and join near Pura to form the Vedavathi River. From there the river flows through Kadur Taluk Of Chikkamagalur District. Then it enters Hosadurga Taluk, Hiriyur Taluk and Challakere Taluk of Chitradurga district, respectively.

On the banks of the Vedavathi, there is a famous temple devoted to Shri Anjaneya at Kellodu, Hosadurga Taluk.

The Vani Vilasa Saagara reservoir constructed across river Vedavathi in Hiriyur taluk dates back a century. Vanivilas sagar is also known as Marikanive and this was first dam built by Sir M Vishweswariah and known first natural reservoir built between two hills. There is also a famous temple dedicated to Goddessess Devi called &quot;Kanive Mariyamma&quot;. This temple is situated beside Dam Wall. Marikanive is a famous tourist attraction in Chitradurga District. There is a garden near the reservoir, which draws crowds on weekends.

A tributary called the Suvarnamukhi converges with Vedavathi at Koodalahalli, Hiriyur Taluk. It is considered to be a &#x27;Punya Bhumi&#x27; or &#x27;Sacred Land&#x27; by the locals. The Vedavathi river then flows from Hiriyur towards Narayanapura, Parashurampaura, Vrindavanahalli, where river flows circularly, hence village called Vrindavana Halli and then to Jajur (moodala jajur) Nagagondanahalli, Janamaddi and then enters Andhra Pradesh i.e. Bhairavani Thippa Dam (BT Project).
On the banks of Nagagondanahalli there is a famous mathematician named Chilumeswamy who was an avadhoot and there is a popular annual fair. On the other side of Vedvathi river there is a village Jajur. Main temples located in Jajur Kariyamma, Anjaneya, Shiva, Shri Kodanada Rama, Lakshmana, Sita, Anjenya, and Nagarakatte and shri Shankaracharya.

The river then flows down to the southeastern state of Andhra Pradesh in Anantapur District, where the river is called the &#x27;Hagari&#x27;. The river has a cultural significance, with the people along the belt of the Hagari depending entirely on the river for most of their needs. Bhairivani Tippa Reservoir is built across this river.

From there the river goes through Gundalaplli, Vepurala, Kanekallu and some drylands in Anantapur District. From Andhra Pradesh State, the river enters Bellary district. Then it flows through Bellary and Siruguppa Taluks. In Bellary Taluk, the river flows through Hagari and Moka Villages. Hence its name, Hagari River, as it flows through Hagari Village.

The Vedavathi River is a tributary to the Tungabhadra River, and finally joins the Tungabhadra River at Siddaragonde village in Siruguppa Taluk of Bellary District along its right bank. The total length of the Vedavathi River is 391 km from its origin to its confluence with the Tungabhadra River. It is a seasonal river and flows only in the rainy season and is dry for much of the year.

The state government has decided to rejuvenate the Vedavathi river in Chikmagalur district, which dries up during summer. In the last 20 years, the river has flowed in full splendour only during the rainy season. It remains dry in summer due to over exploitation of water resources and unplanned development. The plan includes construction of over 810 water-harvesting structures like percolation wells, injection wells and ponds.&lt;ref&gt;

<doc id="1340426" wikidata="Q389243" url="?curid=1340426" title="Pedro Fages">
<text>Pedro Fages (1734–1794) was a Spanish soldier, explorer, and first lieutenant governor of the province of the Californias under Gaspar de Portolá. Fages claimed the governorship after Portolá&#x27;s departure, acting as governor in opposition to the official governor Felipe de Barri, and later served officially as fifth (1782–91) governor of the Californias.

== Career ==
Fages was born in Guissona, Spain. In 1762 he entered the light infantry in Catalonia and joined Spain&#x27;s invasion of Portugal during the Seven Years&#x27; War. In May 1767 Fages, commissioned as a lieutenant in the newly formed Free Company of Volunteers of Catalonia, set sail from Cádiz along with a company of light infantry, voyaging to New Spain (Mexico). He and his men served under Domingo Elizondo in Sonora.

===Voyage from Baja California to San Diego===
In 1769, Fages was selected by &quot;visitador&quot; (Inspector general) José de Gálvez to lead a detachment of soldiers on one of the ships of the Gaspar de Portolá-led expedition to found San Diego, California. Lieutenant Fages sailed from Guaymas to the Baja California port of La Paz. On January 9, 1769, he boarded the galleon &quot;San Carlos&quot;, captained by Vicente Vila and bound for San Diego. Also on board were Franciscan friar Fernando Parrón, engineer and cartographer Miguel Costansó, surgeon Pedro Prat, and 25 soldiers under Fages&#x27; command along with a crew of sailors. After sailing nearly 200 miles (320 kilometers) beyond San Diego due to cartography errors, the &quot;San Carlos&quot; doubled back south. It finally arrived in San Diego Bay on April 29, with scurvy-ridden troops and crewmen.

===Interaction with Kumeyaay Indians===
Upon recovering from the ill effects of the voyage, Fages set about carrying out the instructions of José de Gálvez. Along with Miguel Costansó, he reconnoitered the port and inland areas of San Diego, exploring especially today&#x27;s Mission Valley. In his letter reporting to Gálvez, Fages observed of the local Kumeyaay Indians: &quot;…They appear to be docile and alert. We have made very good friends with them and we are never lacking some little rabbits, hares, and fish that they bring to us. We give them some glass beads. But they value very highly any kind of cloth — no matter how poor it might be — since in exchange for some that I had, I received some furs and nets.&quot; Costansó, while branding the Kumeyaay as &quot;lazy idlers,&quot; noted that &quot;they have bestowed great affection upon Don Pedro Fages and they also respect him very much. They have invited him at various times to be with their women, an expression of friendship that the rest have not merited. &quot;

Costansó recounts a demonstration Fages arranged to prove the superiority of Spanish firearms. Armed with bows and arrows tipped with &quot;very sharp flints,&quot; the Kumeyaay men initially viewed the Spaniards&#x27; guns as &quot;simple sticks.&quot; Fages ordered a leather target erected at a practical distance. The Indians fired their arrows, which had only a &quot;mild effect&quot; on the leather. Fages then ordered his best marksmen to shoot at the same target. &quot;Upon hearing the noise and seeing the destruction so close at hand, the Indians changed their expressions and some of the more timid ones left, giving very clear signs of their surprise and fear.&quot;

===Portolá expedition up the California coast===
On July 14, 1769, Fages set out from San Diego with a party of 74 men on the Portolá expedition to locate Monterey Bay. The party included Catalan volunteers, leather-jacketed soldiers, Christian Indians from Baja California, and friars Juan Crespí and Francisco Gómez, along with other military officers. During this time he was promoted to captain. Although the party failed to recognize Monterey Bay as they passed it, they explored all the way up the coast to San Francisco. The 74 men returned exhausted to San Diego on January 24, 1770, having had to slaughter and eat their mules on the return trek south.

===Second Portolá expedition to Monterey===
In the spring of 1770, Fages joined the second overland Portolá expedition from San Diego to Monterey, along with friar Juan Crespí, twelve Catalan volunteers, seven leather-jacketed soldiers, two muleteers, and five Baja Christian Indians — aiming to establish a Catholic mission in Monterey.

After Portolá left California in 1770, captain Pedro Fages was in charge of the Presidio of Monterey, as the somewhat independent lieutenant-governor of &quot;California Nueva&quot; (New California) — which, in 1770, became part of Las Californias, and was later split from Baja California to become Alta California. In March 1770 Felipe de Barri, in Baja California, was made governor of both Baja and Alta California (1770–75). But, since Monterey was far away, Fages had free rein to run Alta California as acting governor.

===Strict discipline to build Monterey presidio===
Taking charge of constructing the Spanish presidio (fort) in Monterey, Fages imposed strict discipline on his soldier-laborers. He decided the amount of work they had to do in a certain time, harshly punishing soldiers caught resting or rolling a cigarette. Heavy rains punctuated the winter and spring of 1770–1, but Fages permitted no let-up in the work. His soldiers had to trudge through mud to the forest to chop wood, then drag their mules out of the mud and head home. They had no chance to wash or mend their clothes during the six-day work week; Fages told them to do that on Sundays.

On Sundays, they had to carry a week&#x27;s supply of wood for Fages&#x27; kitchen and fetch their own water from the Carmel River some six miles away; clean their weapons; and pass inspection. This work regime lasted a year and a half. Fages&#x27; soldiers viewed him as a tyrant, until complaints by the soldiers persuaded padre president Junípero Serra to intervene. Serra told Fages that, as a Christian, he had to observe the sabbath and let his men rest on Sundays. The soldiers raped the Indian women and took them as concubines. At Serra&#x27;s urging, Fages punished some of the more excessive incidents of sexual abuse, but it did not stop. The two men did not get along and Serra soon made plans to move the mission across the peninsula to Carmel.

Weekly rations for the soldiers consisted of two gallons of corn, a pound of beans, a pound of pinole, half a pound of panocha, and four pounds of meat. The meat, delivered in barrels from the galleon &quot;San Antonio&quot;, often proved too putrid to eat. Weevils infested some of the corn and meal. The soldiers supplemented their diet by gathering wild herbs and hunting geese on Sundays. They also traded what goods they had such as ponchos, knives, daggers, and handkerchiefs for food from the Indians. News of the soldiers&#x27; harsh treatment and poor conditions gradually reached Mexico, and Alta California became an undesirable assignment.

In late June 1771, Fages wrote to viceroy Carlos de Croix in Mexico to inform him that the Monterey presidio had been built, sending along a simplified map. Fages had also started a large vegetable garden with an irrigation supply, and three plots dedicated to growing wheat, barley, rice and beans. He described the Indians of the Monterey/Carmel area as having well-proportioned bodies but feeble spirits. He also described their dress:

===Expeditions to San Francisco Bay===
In November 1770, Fages led an expedition from Monterey by land to San Francisco Bay. Rather than follow Portolá&#x27;s difficult trail around Monterey Bay to Santa Cruz and along the coast, Fages found an easier route through present-day Salinas and the Santa Clara Valley (today&#x27;s U.S. Route 101). Fages&#x27; new trail became the preferred route, and missions were later established along that road at Mission San Juan Bautista, Mission Santa Clara, and Mission San Jose.

From the southern end of the bay, Fages pushed on another day to the farthest camp used by Portolá&#x27;s scouts of the previous year, at San Lorenzo Creek in modern Hayward, on the eastern shore of the bay. From there, scouts ranged a few miles farther north, to a point where the view opened up, and they became the first Europeans to see the entrance to the great bay (although from the opposite side of the bay), a vantage on the slopes above the bay in modern Oakland.

Fages set out north from Monterey again in 1772. The expedition was accompanied again by friar Juan Crespí, who kept a daily journal. From his 1770 trail to the eastern shore of San Francisco Bay, Fages pushed on past his previous stopping point, seeing for himself the entrance to San Francisco Bay, now known as the Golden Gate. The party continued north along San Pablo Bay but was prevented from going farther north by the Carquinez Strait. Following the bay around to the east, Fages&#x27; group climbed the slopes of Mount Diablo and became the first Europeans to see the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, the Central Valley of California and the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Seeing that it was impossible to cross the wide river without boats, the party looped around to return to San Jose through today&#x27;s Contra Costa County (roughly following today&#x27;s I-680 highway).

Messengers from Monterey met the party during its return, informing Fages and Crespí of an emergency. The other Spanish colony, at San Diego, was suffering from severe food shortages. Crespí immediately set out with a pack train to deliver food, but this left Monterey also suffering. The Spaniards had not so far had much luck as hunters in California but, in desperation, Fages ordered that the soldiers set out in small parties to hunt the huge and fearsome California grizzly bear. Fages himself joined the hunt, and earned his nickname &quot;El Oso&quot; (&quot;the bear&quot;) while hunting bears near San Luis Obispo.

Fages&#x27; first tenure as commander in Monterey ended in 1774, after he quarreled with Father Junípero Serra, president of the Alta California missions. He was replaced as lieutenant-governor by another veteran of the Portolá expedition, Fernando Rivera y Moncada.

In 1777, Fages was posted to Sonora to fight the Apaches, where he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. In 1781 he successfully quelled the Quechan (Yuma) Indian revolt and temporarily reopened the Colorado River crossing of the Anza trail at Yuma, Arizona. The Quechan successfully re-closed the trail for the next 50+ years after Fages and his troops departed, ensuring that the two journeys led by Juan Bautista de Anza were the only Spanish expeditions ever to use the trail.

Pedro Fages returned to Monterey in 1777, appointed Governor of the Californias, replacing Felipe de Neve. Monterey replaced Loreto as the capital of the Californias in that year, the Loreto military governorship being replaced by a presidio commander and a civil administrator. In 1804, &quot;Las Californias&quot; was officially split into &quot;Alta California&quot; and &quot;Baja California&quot;.

During Fages&#x27; second tenure as governor, two missions were founded: Mission Santa Barbara (December 4, 1786) and La Purisima Mission (December 8, 1787). Reporting on the Carmel mission in 1787, Fages described the area&#x27;s Indians as the laziest, most brutish and least rational of all the natives discovered between San Diego and San Francisco. He reckoned those qualities — along with the foggy and windy climate, shortage of potable water, high death rate, and language barriers — accounted for the painfully slow progress of mission Carmel.

Concerned over the shortage of skilled artisans in his domain, governor Fages proposed in 1787 that artisans imprisoned in Mexico City and Guadalajara have their sentences commuted to exile in California — provided they serve out their terms at presidios or missions and then stay on as settlers. New Spain&#x27;s rulers did not act on Fages&#x27; proposal.
Fages was promoted to colonel in 1789, and resigned his governorship in 1791. Pedro Fages moved back to Mexico City, where he died in 1794.

==Tumultuous marriage==
Fages married Eulalia Francesca Josepha Callis on June 3, 1780, in Mexico City. Born October 4, 1758, in Barcelona, Spain, Eulalia was a full generation younger than Pedro Fages. She journeyed to Mexico City with her mother and brother to join her father Agustín Callis, captain of the Free Company of Volunteers of Catalonia formed to suppress rebellions by Pima and Seri Indians of Sonora. In 1781, Eulalia and Pedro traveled to Arizpe, Sonora, where Eulalia gave birth to her first child, Pedrito.

When Fages got reassigned to Alta California as governor in 1782, Eulalia and Pedrito remained in Sonora. Then they traveled to Baja California under military escort. Fages journeyed south to Loreto to pick them up. Departing Loreto in July, they arrived in Monterey in January 1783. In the spring of 1784 Pedro and Eulalia, now pregnant, traveled north — Eulalia being carried in a litter — to San Francisco. There they met up with padre president Junípero Serra.

Eulalia found the weather in San Francisco unpleasant and wanted to move to Santa Clara. Fages repeatedly asked the friars running mission Santa Clara to grant Eulalia hospitality there. The friars, feeling it improper for them to host the pregnant &quot;señora gobernadora&quot;, feigned ignorance of governor Fages&#x27; insistent requests. They referred the matter to Serra, who seconded their circumspect posture. So Eulalia&#x27;s second child, María del Carmen, was born in San Francisco in August 1784.

===&#x27;But let a woman in your life…&#x27;===
After Eulalia returned to Monterey from San Francisco, she kept pressing her husband to give up his career in California and return to Mexico. Fages wanted to stay on as governor. After a series of quarrels, Eulalia broke off relations with Pedro. When Pedro seemed unfazed by the separation, Eulalia accused him of consorting with an Indian maidservant of their household. Threatening divorce, Eulalia left the house. In February 1785, Fages sought the advice of the friars at Mission Carmel. Friar Matías de Santa Catalina Noriega concluded that Eulalia still had the obligation to live with her husband and tried to persuade her to reunite with Pedro. Eulalia refused, and appealed her case to the bishop. When Fages returned from a trip to Baja California — during which time Eulalia lived at mission Carmel — she finally agreed to move back into her husband&#x27;s house.

In August 1785, aging friar Francisco Palóu arrived at Monterey from mission Santa Clara, planning to return to Mexico and retire. Fages confided to Palóu that Eulalia still felt unhappy in his house and still wanted to return to Mexico. He asked Palóu to escort Eulalia as far as Guadalajara. Palóu objected that it would be improper for him, a missionary, to escort any woman, even the governor&#x27;s wife. Instead, Palóu spent a whole day trying to dissuade Eulalia from going to Mexico, pointing out all the hardships the trip would entail. Eulalia finally relented and agreed to stay in Monterey. Apparently dissatisfied with that resolution, Fages threw bureaucratic obstacles in the way of Palóu boarding the ship that would carry him to Mexico, delaying Palóu&#x27;s departure until November.

===Reconciliation===
In January 1787, Fages wrote a letter to padre Palóu, in which he reported: &quot;[About] six months ago Eulalia suddenly called me one morning with a thousand protests, tears, and humility and asked my pardon for all the past. She voluntarily confessed that everything had been a pretense and falsehood and that she herself had bribed the Indian girl to take part in the plot… Thank God we are now living in union and harmony.&quot;

==California Historical Landmark==
The place Fages entered in the San Joaquin Valley is a California Historical Landmark number 291 signed on June 27, 1938. The spot is now on California State Route 166, about 20 miles south of Bakersfield, California.
The California Historical Landmark reads:
:&quot;NO. 291 FAGES-ZALVIDEA CROSSING - In 1772, Don Pedro Fages, first recorded non-Indian to visit the southern San Joaquin Valley, crossed this spot on his way from San Diego to San Luis Obispo. Near this point crossed Father José María de Zalvidea in 1806, while accompanying the Ruiz expedition in search of mission sites.&quot;

== Fictional portrayals ==
The novel &quot;Mistress of Monterey: A Story of Lost Romance in Eighteenth Century California&quot; by Virginia Stivers Bartlett (1933, reprinted by Event Horizon Press) draws a psychological portrait of Eulalia Callis in her mercurial relationship with her husband Pedro Fages. Bartlett also sets the tensions between Eulalia and Pedro within the complex interplay between Spanish military officers and Franciscan missionaries in Alta California.

Pedro Fages appears as a minor character in the 1955 film &quot;Seven Cities of Gold&quot;, which presents a fanciful and historically inaccurate account of the founding of Spanish California. Lieutenant Fages is played by Mexican actor Victor Junco. In the credits, Fages&#x27; name is misspelled as &quot;Faces.&quot;

Governor Fages and his wife make a brief appearance in the Isabel Allende novel &quot;Zorro&quot;.
Pere Fages is the protagonist of the historical novel &quot;La última conquista&quot; (2005) by Ramón Vilaró and is a secondary character in &quot;Los acasos&quot; (2010) by Javier Pascual.

<doc id="1340430" wikidata="Q1928191" url="?curid=1340430" title="Emergency light">
<text>An emergency light is a battery-backed lighting device that switches on automatically when a building experiences a power outage. 

In the United States, emergency lights are standard in new commercial and high occupancy residential buildings, such as college dormitories, apartments, and hotels. Most building codes in the US require that they be installed in older buildings as well. Incandescent light bulbs were originally used in emergency lights, before fluorescent lights and later light-emitting diodes (LEDs) superseded them in the 21st century.

==History==
By the nature of the device, an emergency light is designed to come on when the power goes out. Every model, therefore, requires some sort of a battery or generator system that could provide electricity to the lights during a blackout. The earliest models were incandescent light bulbs which could dimly light an area during a blackout and perhaps provide enough light to solve the power problem or evacuate the building. It was quickly realized, however, that a more focused, brighter, and longer-lasting light was needed. Modern emergency floodlights provide a high-lumen, wide-coverage light that can illuminate an area quite well. Some lights are halogen, and provide a light source and intensity similar to that of an automobile headlight.

Early battery backup systems were huge, dwarfing the size of the lights for which they provided power. The systems normally used lead acid batteries to store a full 120 VDC charge. For comparison, an automobile uses a single lead acid battery as part of the ignition system. Simple transistor or relay technology was used to switch on the lights and battery supply in the event of a power failure. The size of these units, as well as the weight and cost, made them relatively rare installations. As technology developed further, the voltage requirements for lights dropped, and subsequently the size of the batteries was reduced as well. Modern lights are only as large as the bulbs themselves - the battery fits quite well in the base of the fixture.

==Modern installations==

In the United States, modern emergency lighting is installed in virtually every commercial and high occupancy residential building. The lights consist of one or more incandescent bulbs or one or more clusters of high-intensity light-emitting diodes (LED). The emergency lighting heads have usually been either incandescent PAR 36 sealed beams or wedge base lamps, but LED illumination is increasingly common. All units have some sort of a device to focus and intensify the light they produce. This can either be in the form of a plastic cover over the fixture, or a reflector placed behind the light source. Most individual light sources can be rotated and aimed for where light is needed most in an emergency, such as toward fire exits. 

Modern fixtures usually have a test button of some sort which simulates a power failure and causes the unit to switch on the lights and operate from battery power, even if the main power is still on. Modern systems are operated with relatively low voltage, usually from 6-12 VDC. This both reduces the size of the batteries required and reduces the load on the circuit to which the emergency light is wired. Modern fixtures include a small transformer in the base of the fixture which steps-down the voltage from main current to the low voltage required by the lights. Batteries are commonly made of lead-calcium, and can last for 10 years or more on continuous charge. US fire safety codes require a minimum of 90 minutes on battery power during a power outage along the path of egress.

==Compliance codes==
New York City requires emergency lights to carry a Calendar Number signifying approval for local installation, Chicago requires emergency lighting to have a metal face plate, and Los Angeles requires additional exit signs be installed within of the floor around doors to mark exits during a fire, as smoke rises and tends to block out higher installed units.

As there are strict requirements to provide an average of one foot candle of light along the path of egress, emergency lighting should be selected carefully to ensure codes are met.

In recent years, emergency lighting has made less use of the traditional two-head unit - with manufacturers stretching the concept of emergency lighting to accommodate and integrate emergency lighting into the architecture.

An emergency lighting installation may be either a central standby source such as a bank of lead acid batteries and control gear/chargers supplying slave fittings throughout the building, or may be constructed using self-contained emergency fittings which incorporate the lamp, battery, charger and control equipment.

Self-contained emergency lighting fittings may operate in &quot;Maintained&quot; mode (illuminated all the time or controlled by a switch) or &quot;Non-Maintained&quot; mode (illuminated only when the normal supply fails).

Some emergency lighting manufacturers offer dimming solutions for common area emergency lighting to allow energy savings for building owners when unoccupied using embedded sensors.

Another popular method for lighting designers, architects and contractors are battery backup ballasts that install within or adjacent to existing lighting fixtures. Upon sensing power loss, the ballasts switch into emergency mode turning the existing lighting into emergency lighting in order to meet both the NFPA&#x27;s Life Safety Code and the National Electric Code without the need of wiring separate circuits or external wall mounts.

Codes of practice for remote mounted emergency lighting generally mandate that wiring from the central power source to emergency luminaires be kept segregated from other wiring, and constructed in fire resistant cabling and wiring systems.

Codes of practice lay down minimum illumination levels in escape routes and open areas. Codes of practice also lay down requirements governing siting of emergency lighting fittings, for example the UK code of practice, BS5266, specifies that a fitting must be within horizontal distance of a fire alarm call point or location for fire fighting appliances.

The most recent codes of practice require the designer to allow for both failure of the supply to the building and the failure of an individual lighting circuit. BS5266 requires that when Non Maintained fittings are used, they must be supplied from the same final circuit as the main lighting circuit in the area.

== UK specific information ==
Emergency lights test, or emergency lighting compliance (ELC), is the process of ensuring that emergency lights are in working order and compliant with safety regulations. This typically involves monthly and annual tests, as well as regular maintenance and replacement of batteries and bulbs. emergency lights test is important to ensure that emergency lights will be able to provide adequate illumination in the event of a power outage or other emergency situation.

According to British fire safety law, an entire assessment of the system must be conducted yearly and “flick-tested” at least once a month. Emergency lighting serves multiple purposes: illuminating pathways for occupants to escape from hazardous situations, as well as helping individuals discover nearby fire-fighting equipment in case of emergencies.

== Types ==
For UK and Australian regulations, two types are distinguished:
* Maintained luminaires are permanently illuminated, and remain illuminated when power fails. They are used for tasks such as emergency exit lighting. In some cases they may be switched off deliberately, but are usually required to be active when a building is occupied, or when the public are admitted, such as for a theatre.
* Sustained or non-maintained luminaires may be switched on and off normally. If the power fails, they turn on automatically.

==Standards==
IEC 60598-2-22 Ed. 3.0: Luminaires - Part 2-22: Particular requirements - Luminaires for emergency lighting

IEC 60364-5-56 Ed. 2.0: Low-voltage electrical installations - Part 5-56: Selection and erection of electrical equipment - Safety services

<doc id="1340433" wikidata="Q1219" url="?curid=1340433" title="Alster">
<text>The Alster () is a right tributary of the Elbe river in Northern Germany. It has its source near Henstedt-Ulzburg, Schleswig-Holstein, flows somewhat southwards through much of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg and joins the Elbe in central Hamburg.

The Alster is Hamburg&#x27;s second most important river. While the Elbe river is a tidal navigation of international significance and prone to flooding, the Alster is a non-tidal, slow-flowing and in some places, seemingly untouched idyll of nature, in other places tamed and landscaped urban space. In the city center, the river forms two lakes, both prominent features in Hamburg&#x27;s cityscape.

== Geography ==

In total, the Alster is long and has an incline from 31 m to 4 m above sea level. Its drainage basin is about . Left tributaries to the Alster are: Rönne, Alte Alster, Sielbek, Ammersbek, Drosselbek, Bredenbek, Rodenbek, Lohbek, Saselbek, Osterbek, and Wandse (Eilbek); right tributaries to the Alster are: Mühlenau (or Mühlenbach), Diekbek, Mellingbek, Susebek, Tarpenbek, and Isebek.

=== Upper course ===
The source of the Alster is a small bog pool in the Timhagen Brook near Henstedt-Ulzburg, approximately north of Hamburg. The small brook makes a couple of curves before entering Hamburg territory at Duvenstedt and Wohldorf-Ohlstedt. At that point, the Alster has passed a couple of smaller locks and has been passed by 15 bridges. From here on, Hamburgers use the river for water sports, especially for canoe and kayak trips on the river, or hikes along its shores. At Wellingsbüttel, the Alster runs past Wellingsbüttel Manor. At Ohlsdorf the Alster reaches a weir, approximately at the height of the former Fuhlsbüttel Lock, the last water level regulation before reaching the inner city. From Fuhlsbüttel downstream, the Alster&#x27;s course, has been straightened on several locations, with old and new river beds occasionally forming parallel canal beds. Between city limits and the inner city&#x27;s first lake − the Außenalster − the river is crossed by 42 bridges.

=== Lower course ===
For Hamburg&#x27;s inner city, the river is a major geographical feature and greatly defines its cityscape. Through ponding of the river in the 13th century, two artificial lakes, the Außenalster (Outer Alster) and the smaller Binnenalster (Inner Alster) were created in central Hamburg. These two lakes and the surrounding parks serve as important recreational areas in the heart of the city. Binnenalster and the subsequent Kleine Alster form important urban spaces. The Alster&#x27;s final section between Kleine Alster and its mouth at Binnenhafen, is called Alsterfleet, as part of a network of inner-city canals, including Bleichenfleet, Herrengrabenfleet, Mönkedammfleet, Neuerwallfleet and Nikolaifleet. Alsterfleet is regulated by two locks at Rathaus/Rathausmarkt and Baumwall, the latter protecting it from the Elbe tide.

== History ==
Hamburg was founded at the mouth of the Alster river in the 9th century and used it as a port. The water was used to flood the moats of the fortifications. The Alster has been dammed since 1190, originally to power a watermill. In 1235 a further dam was built for a second mill, which changed the shape of the river to be like a lake.

In the 15th and 16th century, an Alster canal was built to connect Hamburg with Lübeck. The canal was about long and built from the Alster to the Beste, a tributary of the Trave river, at Sülfeld. Because of the difficulties in holding water, especially near marsh areas, the long waterway from Hamburg to Lübeck was navigable from 1529 to 1550 only. Hamburg expanded along the shores of the Alster, and several locks were constructed to make the river navigable. Until the 19th century water transport with barges were used up to the town of Kayhude. The barges—transporting building material, fuel, and foods—were staked or hauled.

== Economy ==

The Alster is navigatable some 9 km upstream from the mouth. Alster Touristik GmbH (ATG), a subsidiary of the Hamburger Hochbahn, provides public and touristic transport on a fleet of Alster ferries in the city of Hamburg. Along the entire course within Hamburg, rowing or paddle boats are available for rent.

== Ecology ==

In general, the Alster is assessed to be clean. Hamburg&#x27;s Alster and its lakes and canals are famous for its white swans, cared for out of public funds since the 16th century.

== Legacy ==
The Alster basin was an important model for the design of the Charles River basin, constructed in the early 20th century.

Throughout much of Germany, an Alsterwasser (literally: &quot;Alster&#x27;s water&quot;) is the name for a type of shandy, a concoction of equal parts of beer and lemonade. The river inspired the Hamburg-born composer Oscar Fetrás to compose the popular waltz &quot;Mondnacht auf der Alster&quot; (in English: &quot;Moonlit Night on the Alster&quot;). Hamburg&#x27;s largest aquatic center, the Alster-Schwimmhalle, is named after the river.

<text>Nyhamna is a small peninsula on the northeast side of the island of Gossa in Aukra Municipality in Møre og Romsdal county, Norway. It is located along the Julsundet strait, about northeast of the village of Varhaugvika and northeast of the village of Aukrasanden.

The area was once a whaling station, but is now an industrial area. Since 2002, it has been the landing place of the natural gas from the Ormen Lange gas field. At this facility, the gas enters a processing facility, the Nyhamna Gas Plant that is connected to the northern end of the Langeled pipeline which transports the gas under the sea to Easington in England. The processing facility at Nyhamna processes about per year.

<doc id="1340457" wikidata="Q7627081" url="?curid=1340457" title="Stuart Semple">
<text>&quot;Stuart Buchanan Semple&quot;&#x27;(born 12 September 1980) is a British artist and activist who works with sculpture and painting.

==Life and career==
Semple was born in Bournemouth, Dorset. He studied art and design at Bournemouth and Poole College, and painting and printmaking at Bretton Hall College in Yorkshire. He first wanted to become an artist after his mother took him to see Van Gogh&#x27;s Sunflowers at the age of 7. In 2000, after a life-threatening allergic reaction, he decided to pursue a career as an artist. He later referenced the electrocardiography flatline he experienced in a 2010 painting.

In 2002 he had his first major London solo exhibition, &quot;Stolen Language – the art of Nancyboy&quot;&quot;,&quot; at the A&amp;D Gallery. In 2009, he auctioned off Nancyboy-themed artworks to raise funds for the UK charity Mind, after his grandmother was diagnosed with schizophrenia. After the 2004 Momart warehouse fire, he was commissioned to create a memorial with the debris, titled &quot;Burn Baby Burn&quot;. In 2005, Semple produced an exhibition in East London, titled &quot;Post Pop Paradise&quot;. Also that year he placed a painting he created at the Saatchi Gallery, avoiding security in doing so, as a protest against comments Charles Saatchi made.

In 2006 Semple&#x27;s exhibition &quot;Epiphany&quot; at Martin Summers Fine Art in London questioned the role of religion in modern life in a series of in-your-face paintings that alluded to popular culture, graphic media, advertising and social issues.

Semple began posting drawings he created on eBay in 1999. In 2012, he published an extended play on iTunes featuring paintings and a short film. In 2013, he created Jump, a 10 by 10m bouncy cloud trampoline, for Australia&#x27;s Federation Square&#x27;s public art programme. In 2014, his exhibition &quot;Anxiety Generation&quot; was featured in Tatler magazine. That same year, he joined talent agency Next Management. He has also been featured on the BBC, and has spoken at the Institute of Contemporary Arts and Amnesty International. 

In 2004, art dealer Anthony d&#x27;Offay flew Semple&#x27;s portfolio to be shown in New York City. A 2007 solo exhibition saw $1 million sales within the first five minutes. In 2013, a London exhibition had presales to a charitable foundation of $1 million. That same year, he was featured in The Guardian&#x27;s list of Ten Best Art Auctions. In 2015, he created a colouring book for adults to raise funds for Mind.

=== Performance Art ===
In 2016, Semple came into conflict with the artist Anish Kapoor when Kapoor purchased exclusive artistic rights to the super-black material Vantablack. He released a paint titled &quot;PINK – the world&#x27;s pinkest pink paint&quot;, banning Kapoor from purchasing the paint. In June 2024, Semple officially changed his name to Anish Kapoor.

In 2021, Semple released a pigment called &quot;TIFF Blue&quot;, aiming to &quot;democratise&quot; Tiffany Blue, a shade of blue trademarked by Tiffany &amp; Co. The same year, he also released a pigment called Incredibly Kleinish Blue with a similar intention of democratising International Klein Blue, which is patented by Yves Klein. In 2023, Semple released a pigment called &quot;Pinkie&quot;, aiming to democratise Barbie Pink.
Freetone (or Sempletone) is an Adobe plugin, created by Semple in 2022 in response to the licensing fallout between Pantone and Adobe Inc. Freetone is a collection of 1,280 colours that mimic the Pantone colour palette with a similar set of number codes. Semple barred any employees and associates of Adobe or Pantone from buying, using or downloading Freetone.

==Activism==
Semple has supported Amnesty International and has created artworks for the Freedom of Expression Campaign. 

In 2011, Semple was made an ambassador for mental health charity Mind. He initiated the Creative Therapies fund within the organisation which he launched with Stephen Fry and Melvyn Bragg and curated the exhibition &quot;Mindful&quot;, which included works from Jake &amp; Dinos Chapman, Mat Collishaw, Tracey Emin, Mona Hatoum, Sarah Lucas and Sebastian Horsley. He has since launched a number of fundraising art projects for Mind. The Creative Therapies fund backs mental health projects in the United Kingdom.

He has also advocated for artists&#x27; rights in the United Kingdom, humanitarian aid, and world peace.

== Exhibitions ==

== Curatorial projects ==
In 2007, Semple co-curated and featured in the &#x27;Black Market&#x27; at the Anna Kustera gallery in New York with Just Another Rich Kid. Semple curated exhibitions &quot;Mash Ups, post pop fragments and détournements&quot; at The Kowalsky Gallery in 2008 for the Design and Artists Copyright Society and &#x27;London Loves The Way Things Fall Apart&#x27; (2009) and &quot;This Is England&quot; (2011) for Galleria Aus18, Milan.

Semple curated &quot;This Is England&quot; (2010) initially held at The Aubin Gallery (which he directed in association with Aubin &amp; Wills and Shoreditch House) featuring artists Sarah Maple, Nicky Carvell, David Hancock and Richard Galloway which then toured to Milan.

In 2011 Semple curated the Mindful exhibition in the Old Vic Tunnels featuring artists including Jake and Dinos Chapman, Tracey Emin, Mona Hatoum, Mat Collishaw, Sebastian Horsley, Sarah Lucas, Barney Bubbles, Liliane Lijn, Tessa Farmer and Semple. It coincided with a gala dinner at The Imperial War Museum hosted by Stephen Fry and Lord Melvyn Bragg to raise funds for the Mind creative therapies fund.

<text>(, literally European Standards for Model Railways, known in the UK as Normal European Modelling Standards (NEM Standards)) are standards for model railroads, issued by the MOROP.

==Standards==
The NEM standards are defined and maintained by the Technical Commission of the MOROP in collaboration with model railroad manufacturers.

The NEM standards define the model railroad scales and guide manufacturers in creating compatible products and assist modellers in constructing model railroad layouts that operate reliably. The standards cover areas like suggested grades, turnout radii, wheel profiles, coupling designs and Digital Command Control (DCC) and are mostly scale specific. A fundamental principle in NEM standards are compromises in the exact scale reduction ratio in order to favour operational reliability of model railroad systems. An example for this is wheel flanges which tend to be proportionally wider in smaller scales to ensure reliable operation.

The NEM standards cover areas similar to the standards and recommended practices defined by the National Model Railroad Association (NMRA) in the United States, but the two standards are not universally interchangeable. In recent years, MOROP and NMRA have been working more closely together to establish common standards for developments such as DCC. European model railroad manufacturers generally follow the NEM standards, while North American manufacturers generally follow NMRA standards.

<text>Cârța (; or &quot;Karcfalva&quot; ) is a commune in Romania, located in Harghita County. It lies in the Székely Land, an ethno-cultural region in eastern Transylvania.
The commune is composed of two villages: Cârța (&quot;Karcfalva&quot;) and Ineu (&quot;Csíkjenőfalva&quot;). Tomești has been an independent commune since 2004.

==History==
The village belonged to the Székely seat of Csíkszék, then from 1876 until 1918 to the Csík County in the Kingdom of Hungary. In the aftermath of World War I and the Hungarian–Romanian War of 1918–1919, it passed under Romanian administration; after the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, like the rest of Transylvania, it became part of the Kingdom of Romania. During the interwar period, the village fell within Ciuc County. In 1940, the Second Vienna Award granted Northern Transylvania to Hungary and the village was held by Hungary until 1944. After Soviet occupation, the Romanian administration returned and the village became officially part of Romania in March 1945. Between 1952 and 1960, the commune fell within the Magyar Autonomous Region, between 1960 and 1968 the Mureș-Magyar Autonomous Region. In 1968, the region was abolished, and since then, the commune has been part of Harghita County.

==Demographics==
At the 2011 census, the commune had a population of 2,709; out of them, 98% were Hungarian and 0.3% were Romanian. 97% of the commune population are Roman Catholic, 1% are Reformed and 0.4% are Orthodox.

== Landmarks ==
* Its Roman Catholic church dedicated to honour of Virgin Mary was built around 1448 by rebuilding an older church from donation of John Hunyadi. It was altered in 1720, 1796, and in 1922. Its fortified walls were built in the late 18th, early 19th centuries. The design of the defense corridors is unique in the Székely Land. The church tower was heightened in 1720 and covered with tin sheets in 1850. A great number of pagan ritual objects were found here in 1796 when the church was being altered.
* Madicsa, a village notable of its mineral water source, lies west of the village. There is a mineral water bath in the village.

<doc id="1340464" wikidata="Q2577030" url="?curid=1340464" title="The Clique (art group)">
<text>The Clique was a group of English artists formed by Richard Dadd in the late 1830s. Other members were Augustus Egg, Alfred Elmore, William Powell Frith, Henry Nelson O&#x27;Neil, John Phillip and Edward Matthew Ward.

They have been described as “the first group of British artists to combine for greater strength and to announce that the great backward-looking tradition of the Academy was not relevant to the requirements of contemporary art”.

==Foundation==

Information about the activities of The Clique derives mainly from the reminiscences of Frith and a short essay published in &quot;The Art Journal&quot; in 1898 by Gilbert Imray, a friend of the group. Both state that the group called themselves by this name at the time and that they formed a sketching club. Imray describes the aspirations of some members and explains that at their meetings they would all produce drawings on the same subject and ask non-artists such as Imray to judge the merits of the works.

They met together at the end of the 1830s and early 1840s. The group broke up in 1843 when Dadd was incarcerated after murdering his father. The others all became successful members of the Royal Academy of Arts (though O&#x27;Neil only became an associate member, not a full member). Their work was supported by the newly founded periodical &quot;The Art Journal&quot;.

==Ideas==
The Clique was characterised by their rejection of academic high art in favour of genre painting, following the precedents of William Hogarth and David Wilkie. This was in line with their view that art should be judged by the public, not by its conformity to academic ideals.

In the 1850s most members of the Clique became inveterate enemies of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, believing their art to be willfully eccentric and primitivist. Frith and O&#x27;Neil wrote many attacks on Pre-Raphaelite principles. However Egg became a friend and supporter of William Holman Hunt.

Portraits of members of the Clique were commissioned by Patrick Allan-Fraser for Hospitalfield House in Arbroath.

In the 1860s another group of artists with similar ideas became known as the St. John&#x27;s Wood Clique.

<doc id="1340465" wikidata="Q6972405" url="?curid=1340465" title="National Electricity Market">
<text>The National Electricity Market (NEM) is an arrangement in Australia&#x27;s electricity sector for the connection of the electricity transmission grids of the eastern and southern Australia states and territories to create a cross-state wholesale electricity market. The Australian Energy Market Commission develops and maintains the Australian National Electricity Rules (NER), which have the force of law in the states and territories participating in NEM. The Rules are enforced by the Australian Energy Regulator. The day-to-day management of NEM is performed by the Australian Energy Market Operator.

NEM operations began on 13 December 1998 and currently covers Queensland, New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia. Western Australia and the Northern Territory are not connected to the NEM. The NEM comprises five regions, with the ACT being in the NSW region. Tasmania joined the NEM in May 2005 and became fully operational on 29 April 2006 when the Basslink interconnector was fully activated. The Snowy region was abolished as a region on 1 July 2008 and the components split between New South Wales and Victoria. The Northern Territory has adopted parts of the National Electricity Law, with the Australian Energy Market Commission becoming the rule maker for the Territory for parts of the National Electricity Rules from 1 July 2016. Western Australia is also considering adopting parts of the NER.

The NEM operates one of the world’s longest interconnected power systems between Port Douglas, Queensland and Port Lincoln, South Australia, with an end-to-end distance of more than 5,000 kilometres, and 40,000 kilometres of high voltage transmissions line. During the 2017-18 financial year, 203 TWh of electricity with a market value of AU$17 billion was traded through the NEM, serving 9.7 million end-use consumers. Approximately 40% of NEM generation is consumed in New South Wales, while Victoria and Queensland consume approximately 25% each.

FY19/20 rooftop solar capacity was 10,696MW, NEM capacity 49,832MW, NEM demand 35,626MW 

==Operation of the market==
Exchange between electricity producers and electricity consumers is facilitated through a spot market where the output from all generators is aggregated and instantaneously scheduled to meet demand through a centrally-coordinated dispatch process. This process is operated by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) in accordance with the provisions of Australian National Electricity Law and Australian National Electricity Rules.

Scheduled generators submit offers every five minutes of every day. From all offers submitted, AEMO’s systems determine the generators required to produce electricity based on the principle of meeting prevailing demand in the most cost-efficient way (see also Economic dispatch). AEMO then dispatches these generators into production by sending automatic generation control (AGC) target signals to each generating unit.

A dispatch price is determined every five minutes (termed Dispatch Intervals, abbreviated as DI) to determine the spot price for each 5-minute trading interval abbreviated as TI. Before October 2021, six dispatch prices were averaged every half-hour. There are 5 trading regions for each of the regions of the NEM. AEMO uses the spot price as the basis for the settlement of financial transactions for all energy traded in the NEM.

There is a maximum price that generators can bid in at. Under the Rules, the AEMC adjusts this maximum spot price MPC (market price cap) by movements in the consumer price index by 28 February each year for the rate to commence on 1 July. For the 2020-2021 financial year the MPC was $15,000/MWh. There is a further limit on the price called the Cumulative Price Threshold, which is the sum of value of all the TI&#x27;s for the previous 7 days, calculated on a rolling basis. When this exceeds $224,600, AEMO caps the bids to a nominated value, currently $300/MWh. Whilst the price is capped in this manner, it is known as an Administered Price period. The process continues until the rolling average drops to allow normal trading without impinging the threshold too rapidly again.

Market Price Cap (MPC) – which was previously called the value of lost load (VoLL) – is the price automatically triggered when AEMO directs network service providers to interrupt customer supply in order to keep supply and demand in the system in balance. From 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2023 the MPC has been set to $15,500/MWh. From 1 October 2021 to 30 June 2022 was $15,100/MWh. The MPC for the 2020-2021 financial year was $15,000/MWh; $14,700/MWh in 2019-2020; and $14,500/MWh in 2018-2019. For the 2017-2018 financial year the MPC was $14,200/MWh and the Cumulative Price Threshold was $212,800. The maximum price was $14,000/MWh in 2016-2017, $13,800/MWh in 2015-2016, $13,500/MWh in 2014-2015, and $13,100/MWh in 2013-2014.

The Rules also set a minimum spot price of minus $1,000 per MWh which is the market floor price. This negative market floor price allows generators to pay to stay online when the cost of staying online is lower than the cost of shutting down and re-starting their plants. For a renewable generator, staying online may also cost less than what generators receive from support mechanisms like the Renewable Energy Target scheme, plus their own costs.

==Physical equipment==
===Generators===
For comprehensive information of generators in Australia, see List of power stations in Australia.

===Transmission network===
The transmission network service providers (TNSPs) are operators of the high voltage electricity transmission networks. There are five state-based TNSPs servicing each of the regions in the NEM, with crossborder interconnectors linking the state grids at state borders to allow electricity to flow from one state to another. Four of the networks form a wide area synchronous grid except for Tasmania which is linked via HVDC. The TNSPs link generators to the 13 major distribution networks that supply electricity to end-use customers.

The TNSPs are:


TNSPs participate in the Australian Energy Regulator&#x27;s (AER) revenue proposal process, where submissions of the TNSPs, the AER and other interested parties are used to set the maximum allowable revenue (MAR) for the TNSPs for a five-year period.

The crossborder interconnectors are:

* NSW-Queensland — Terranora interconnector (Directlink) (HVDC)
* NSW-Queensland — Queensland – New South Wales Interconnector (HV AC)
* Victoria to New South Wales Interconnector
* Victoria-Tasmania — Basslink (HVDC)
* Victoria-South Australia — Heywood interconnector (HV AC)
* Victoria-South Australia — Murraylink (HVDC)

==System reliability==
NEM reliability standards are established by the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) Reliability Panel. These standards currently require that unserved energy per year for each region must not exceed 0.002 percent of the total energy consumed in that region that year.

The NEM is required to operate with defined levels of reserve in order to meet the required standard of supply reliability. Under current standards, AEMO is required to ensure 850 megawatts of reserve is carried across the entire NEM.

The reliability safety net provisions of the National Electricity Rules provide that AEMO must procure sufficient reserve to ensure that the reliability of supply meets the reliability standard. When reserves acquired by AEMO are dispatched they are bid in at the MPC thus setting the spot price at the maximum level.

==Financial markets==
In addition to physical spot trading through the NEM, there is a separate financial trading market for electricity.

Prices in the spot market are highly volatile and the spot price can spike to several hundred times the average price for short periods. Therefore, buyers and sellers wish to lock in energy prices through financial hedging contracts. Under a “contract for differences” the purchaser (typically an electricity retailer) agrees to purchase a specified physical quantity of energy from the spot market at a set price (the “strike price”). If the actual price paid in the spot market by the purchaser is higher than the strike price, the counterparty to the contract (typically an electricity generator or a financial institution) pays the purchaser the difference in cost. Conversely, if the price paid is lower than the strike price, the purchaser pays the counterparty the difference.

There are numerous variations on the standard hedging contract available in the market, often containing complicated financial arrangements, for example one way option contracts, cap and collar contracts.

Hedging contracts are financial instruments. The financial market in electricity is conducted through over-the-counter trading and through exchange trading through the Sydney Futures Exchange (see Exchange-traded derivative contract).

The Sydney Futures Exchange lists eight standardised futures products based on Base Load and Peak-Period energy bought and sold over a calendar quarter in the NEM in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Queensland.

==Regulation==

===Institutions===
Three key bodies are the Australian Energy Market Commission, the Australian Energy Regulator and the Australian Energy Market Operator.

====Australian Energy Market Commission====
The Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) is currently responsible for determining rules and policy advice covering the NEM. The AEMC was established by the Australian Energy Market Commission Establishment Act 2004 (South Australia). Many of its statutory powers are derived from the National Electricity Law (NEL)

====Australian Energy Regulator====
The Australian Energy Regulator (AER) regulates the national electricity market. It is responsible for rule enforcement for the NEM as well as economic regulation of the electricity transmission and distribution networks in the NEM. It is also responsible for the economic regulation of gas transmission and distribution networks and enforcing the national gas law and national gas rules in all jurisdictions except Western Australia.

====Australian Energy Market Operator====
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) consists of six founding entities:
National Electricity Market Management Company (NEMMCO), Victorian Energy Networks Corporation (VENCorp), Electricity Supply Industry Planning Council (ESIPC), Retail Energy Market Company (REMCO), Gas Market Company (GMC), Gas Retail Market Operator (GRMO).

AEMO draws together the functions carried out by these organisations, incorporating management of the NEM and the retail and wholesale gas markets of eastern and southern Australia, and it oversees system security of the NEM electricity grid and the Victorian gas transmission network. In addition, it is responsible for national transmission planning and the establishment of a short term trading market for gas.

AEMO was established by the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) and developed under the guidance of the Ministerial Council on Energy (MCE). It is run by a skills-based board of nine non-executive directors and the chief executive officer.

===National Electricity Law===
Due to the process of cooperative federalism under which the NEM was established, the National Electricity Law (NEL) is contained in a Schedule to the &quot;National Electricity (South Australia) Act 1996&quot; (SA). The NEL is applied as law in each participating jurisdiction of the NEM by application statutes, for example the &quot;National Electricity (Victoria) Act 2005&quot;.

===National Electricity Rules===
The National Electricity Rules (NER) govern the operation of the National Electricity Market. The Rules have the force of law, and are made under the National Electricity Law. Up-to-date versions of the Australian National Electricity Rules can generally be found on the AEMC&#x27;s website.

==Terminology==

===Formal terminology===
Much of the terminology used in the National Electricity Market is derived from the National Electricity Law (NEL) and National Electricity Rules (NER).

====Scheduled Generator====
A generating unit generally non-intermittent units above 30MW. They are required to submit price/quantity bids specifying their generation
intentions, and must comply with dispatch instructions from AEMO.

====Semi-Scheduled Generator====
A generating unit which has a nameplate rating of 30 MW or greater (or is part of a group of generating units connected at a common connection point with a combined nameplate rating of 30 MW or greater), must be classified as a semi-scheduled generating unit where the output of the generating unit is intermittent unless AEMO approves its classification as a scheduled generating unit or a non-scheduled generating unit.

====Market Participant====
A person who is registered by AEMO as a Market Generator, Market Customer or Market Network Service Provider under Chapter 2 of the NER.

====Good faith bidding====
Scheduled Generators and Market Participants must make dispatch offers, dispatch bids and rebids in good faith (s.3.8.22A, NER).

===Informal terminology===

====Gentailer====
The term &#x27;gentailer&#x27; or gen-tailer is a portmanteau word combining the terms generator and retailer, i.e. gen-tailer. This is a reference to the vertical integration of companies operating in the NEM, where generators own a retail arm. Four companies in the Australian NEM commonly described as gentailers are EnergyAustralia, AGL Energy, Origin Energy and Snowy Hydro (Lumo and Red Energy being retailer brands). Additionally, ERM Power is a generator as well as small business retailer.

====Gentrader====

==Outcomes==
It has been argued that the reforms have delivered considerable economic benefits. A government review (December 2006) stated that the reforms have underpinned significant levels of investment in energy supply (approximately $7 billion in electricity generation and $4.4 billion in electricity transmission), improved productivity (particularly capital utilisation) and delivered internationally competitive electricity prices for Australian industry and households. In terms of the climate change impacts of the reforms, experts have concluded that the outcome is increased emissions with respect to business as usual scenarios. This is due to the lower cost of coal fired generation compared to other generators, reduced emphasis on energy efficiency from lower prices, the failure to price greenhouse gas emissions, combined with market design and regulation that favours incumbents.

==2017 pricing crisis==
On 16 October 2017, the ACCC published a preliminary report into the electricity market highlighting significant concerns about the operation of the National Electricity Market, which is leading to serious problems with affordability for consumers and businesses. ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said:

The ACCC estimates that in 2016-17, Queenslanders will be paying the most for their electricity, followed by South Australians and people living in New South Wales. Victorians will have the lowest electricity bills. On average across the NEM, a 2015-16 residential bill was $1,524 (excluding GST), made up of network costs (48%), wholesale costs (22%), environmental costs (7%), retail and other costs (16%) and retail margins (8%). The ACCC attributed the main reason for electricity price increases to higher network costs for all states other than South Australia, where generation costs represented the highest increase. &quot;The wholesale (generation) market is highly concentrated and this is likely to be contributing to higher wholesale electricity prices.&quot; The ACCC accused the network operators of &quot;over-investing&quot; in poles and wires and gaming rules around revenue. The ‘big three’ vertically integrated gentailers, AGL, Origin, and EnergyAustralia, continue to hold large retail market shares in most regions, and control in excess of 60% of generation capacity in NSW, South Australia, and Victoria making it difficult for smaller retailers to compete. Retail margins increased significantly in NSW, but decreased in others.

In the September 2017 quarter, the price of electricity increased nationally by 8.9%.

<text>The V.23 standard was an early modem standard first approved by ITU-T precursor CCITT in 1964.

It specifies audio frequency-shift keying (AFSK) to encode and transfer data at a rate of 1200 bits per second, full-duplex at 1200 baud (Mode 2), (or at a &quot;fallback rate&quot; of 600 baud, mode 1) for the forward data-transmission channel, and an optional 75 baud backward channel.

* V.23 Mode 1 AFSK uses a 1300 Hz tone (FZ) for &quot;mark&quot; (typically a binary &quot;1&quot;) and 1700 Hz (FA) for &quot;space&quot; (typically a binary &quot;0&quot;), and a 1500 Hz center frequency (F0).
* V.23 Mode 2 AFSK uses a 1300 Hz tone (FZ) for &quot;mark&quot; (typically a binary &quot;1&quot;) and 2100 Hz (FA) for &quot;space&quot; (typically a binary &quot;0&quot;), and a 1700 Hz center frequency (F0).
* V.23 backward channel AFSK uses a 390 Hz tone (FZ) for &quot;mark&quot; (typically a binary &quot;1&quot;) and a 450 Hz (FA) for &quot;space&quot; (typically a binary &quot;0&quot;).

In some European countries, (and perhaps elsewhere), V.23 Mode 2 AFSK modulation, (without the backward channel) is used to transmit Caller ID information over POTS lines in the public telephone network.

The 75 baud backward channel was originally envisioned for use in error correction schemes, but V.23 was also widely used in Videotex applications where the backward channel was used to send keyboard data in an asymmetrical full duplex scheme in devices such as the French Minitel service, or the British Prestel service.

<doc id="1340479" wikidata="Q10315777" url="?curid=1340479" title="Waste stabilization pond">
<text>Waste stabilization ponds (WSPs or stabilization ponds or waste stabilization lagoons) are ponds designed and built for wastewater treatment to reduce the organic content and remove pathogens from wastewater. They are man-made depressions confined by earthen structures. Wastewater or &quot;influent&quot; enters on one side of the waste stabilization pond and exits on the other side as &quot;effluent&quot;, after spending several days in the pond, during which treatment processes take place. 

Waste stabilization ponds are used worldwide for wastewater treatment and are especially suitable for developing countries that have warm climates. They are frequently used to treat sewage and industrial effluents, but may also be used for treatment of municipal run-off or stormwater. The system may consist of a single pond or several ponds in a series, each pond playing a different role in the removal of pollutants. After treatment, the effluent may be returned to surface water or reused as irrigation water (or reclaimed water) if the effluent meets the required effluent standards (e.g. sufficiently low levels of pathogens).

Waste stabilization ponds involve natural treatment processes which take time because removal rates are slow. Therefore, larger areas are required than for other treatment processes with external energy inputs. Waste stabilization ponds described here use no aerators. High-performance lagoon technology that does use aerators has much more in common with the activated sludge process. Such aerated lagoons use less area than is needed for traditional stabilization ponds and are also common in small towns.

==Fundamentals==

=== Concept of stabilization ===
Sewage and many types of industrial wastewaters contain organic matter. If wastewater is discharged untreated into surface water bodies (for instance, rivers and lakes), their organic matter serves as food for microorganisms living in the surface waters. These organisms use the organic matter for energy generation for their growth and reproduction. This is done via their respiration, in which they convert the organic matter into carbon dioxide and water. These stable components do not cause water pollution problems. Therefore this is frequently called &quot;stabilization&quot; of the organic matter.

However, these organisms use oxygen in their respiration, thus reducing the oxygen concentration in the surface waters. This is one of the main water pollution problems, which may affect the surface water biota, including fish. 

Waste stabilization ponds reproduce these biological phenomena before they take place in the receiving surface water and cause the pollution problems due to oxygen consumption. The ponds receive wastewater, and, by natural processes similar to those that take place in the surface waters, carry out stabilization of the organic matter inside them, as part of the treatment. This is why they received the name of waste stabilization ponds.

=== Microorganisms ===
The reactions take place by the joint participation of several microorganisms living within the pond. The organic matter is measured as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). BOD values in the pond effluent are lower than in the influent, reflecting the removal of organic matter. This pond biome uses organic matter from the wastewater as food.

Nutrients are converted to cell material and energy for life processes including reproduction and growth of living cells. Some of these living cells will be consumed by organisms at higher trophic levels within the pond. In ponds, the most important group of microorganisms are bacteria, which utilize most of the organic matter from the wastewater, but also consume oxygen. 

Algae are another essential group of microorganisms. They do not depend on the organic material from the influent. Instead, they undertake photosynthesis, in which they produce the organic matter for their own consumption and, very importantly here, they release oxygen. The excess oxygen released supports the respiration done by the aerobic organisms in the pond. Atmospheric oxygen is also dissolved into the liquid, which assists in maintaining an aerobic layer on the top of the pond surface.

=== Oxygen levels ===
The oxygen concentration varies in the liquid column: Close to the surface, concentrations are high and support the growth of aerobic organisms. Close to the pond bottom, sunlight penetration is low, and thus photosynthetic activity is reduced. This causes oxygen concentrations to be low there. Finally, inside the sediments in the bottom layer, there is no oxygen at all. Here, organic matter is removed by digestion undertaken by anaerobic organisms. 

=== Removal of pathogens ===
Pathogens can be efficiently removed in waste stabilization ponds. The process relies mostly on maturation ponds for removal of pathogens, although some removal also takes place in the other ponds of the system. The higher the number of ponds in the series, the more efficient the pathogen removal.

Removal of pathogenic bacteria and viruses occurs mainly by inactivation. Pathogens are inactivated as a result of a complex interaction of mechanisms that involve pH (the pH value in ponds is high because of algal photosynthesis), temperature, ultraviolet radiation present in the sunlight that reaches the pond surface and photooxidative reactions taking advantage of high dissolved oxygen concentrations.

Protozoan pathogens are present in the wastewater in the form of cysts or oocysts. Helminths (worms) are present in the form of eggs. The protozoan and helminth pathogens can be removed by the mechanism of sedimentation. Very high removal efficiencies may be achieved, especially if maturation ponds are part of the treatment system. In that case, the final pond effluent may be in compliance with World Health Organization guidelines for irrigating with treated wastewaster (or &quot;reclaimed water&quot;). However, sludge (sediment) from the ponds may be heavily contaminated with helminth eggs, which may survive even after several years of storing the sludge inside of the pond.

==Types==

Waste stabilization ponds consist of man-made basins comprising a single or several series of anaerobic, facultative or maturation ponds. The presence or absence of oxygen varies with the three different types of ponds, used in sequence. Anaerobic waste stabilization ponds have very little dissolved oxygen, thus anaerobic conditions prevail. The second type of pond, facultative stabilization ponds, sustain an aerobic surface habitat above an anaerobic benthic habitat. Maturation ponds offer aerobic conditions throughout, from the surface to the bottom.

The main configurations of pond systems are: 
* Facultative pond only;
* Anaerobic pond followed by a facultative pond;
* Facultative pond followed by maturation ponds in series;
* Anaerobic pond followed by a facultative pond followed by maturation ponds in series.

If an anaerobic pond is present, part of the suspended solids from the wastewater settles, thus removing the organic matter (BOD) contributed by these solids. Additionally, some of the dissolved organic matter is removed by anaerobic digestion. During the second stage in the facultative pond&quot;,&quot; most of the remaining BOD is removed mainly by the heterotrophic bacteria that receive oxygen from the photosynthesis undertaken by algae. The main function of the tertiary stage in maturation ponds is the removal of pathogens, although it may also assist in nutrient reduction (i.e. nitrogen). However, nitrogen fixation by algae living in stabilization pond systems may increase nitrogen levels in stabilization pond effluent.

===Anaerobic ponds===

Anaerobic ponds receive raw wastewater. They have a smaller surface area compared to facultative ponds and are also deeper (usually 3.0 to 5.0 m). The depth decreases the influence of oxygen production by photosynthesis, leading to anaerobic conditions. Depending on loading and climatic conditions, these ponds are able to remove between half to two thirds of the influent BOD. This significantly decreases the load of organic matter that goes to the facultative ponds, and thus decreases their required size. Anaerobic stabilization ponds have the disadvantage of potentially releasing malodorous gases. This especially includes hydrogen sulfide with an odor of rotten eggs, if the system has operational problems.

The first pond biome in a series of stabilization ponds digests the putrescible solids suspended in the wastewater being treated. Anaerobic ponds allow solids to settle down at the bottom as sludge. This settling removes a portion of the particulate organic material. A large fraction of the settled solids will accumulate close to the point where wastewater enters the pond. Therefore, anaerobic ponds must be designed to be far deeper than either aerobic or facultative ponds. The depth decreases the oxygen levels so anaerobic bacteria can efficiently digest the waste. Anaerobic ponds contain anaerobic organisms which are able to break down complex organic waste into basic compounds that are less harmful to the environment. Because anaerobic organisms can only thrive in warm temperatures, anaerobic ponds are not suitable in temperate or cold climates.

Sludge accumulates at the bottom of the anaerobic ponds and needs to be removed every few years.

===Facultative ponds===
Facultative stabilization ponds that receive raw wastewater are called primary facultative ponds. If they are receiving wastewater that has already been treated in anaerobic ponds, they are called secondary facultative ponds. Facultative stabilization ponds may also be used for treatment following other types of treatment processes such as upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors, oxidation ditches or aerated lagoons. Compared with anaerobic ponds, facultative ponds are shallower (1.5 to 2.5 m deep) and have much larger surface areas. The surface area is important because it allows atmospheric oxygen to dissolve and sunlight radiation to penetrate the water. This allows for photosynthetic activity to occur which produces more oxygen.

In most ponds both bacteria and algae are needed in order to maximize the decomposition of organic matter and the removal of other pollutants. Algae produce oxygen (photosynthesis) and also consume oxygen (respiration), but they leave an excess of oxygen that can then be used by aerobic bacteria for respiration and for the processes of oxidation (or stabilization) of the organic matter in the wastewater.

Several types of invertebrates are present in the ponds where they control the population of algae, which then settles to the bottom. Heavy algal growth may block sunlight from penetrating into the pond. This decreases the potential for photosynthesis to contribute oxygen to the pond. 

In the treatment of sewage, systems composed of anaerobic ponds followed by facultative ponds usually have overall BOD removal efficiencies between 75 and 85%. Higher efficiencies are difficult to achieve because the effluent contains high concentrations of particulate organic matter, in the form of algae, naturally produced during treatment.

The sludge comprising the sediment layer in the pond undergoes anaerobic digestion, and may accumulate for several years without needing removal.

===Maturation ponds===

Some additional removal of organic matter and other pollutants may be achieved in maturation ponds. These ponds are only included in the treatment line when high efficiencies of pathogen removal are required, either for discharge of the treated effluent in surface water bodies, or for use for irrigation or aquaculture. They are usually used after facultative ponds, but may also follow other treatment processes, such as upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors. They could also be placed after an activated sludge process. 

Maturation ponds must be shallow (around 1.0 m depth or less) with a great surface area so that more oxygen can dissolve into the water giving the bacteria enough oxygen to properly function. Shallow ponds benefit from high photosynthetic activity arising from the penetration of solar radiation. The pH values are high because of intense photosynthesis, and ultraviolet radiation penetration takes place in the upper layers. Both of these factors promote the removal of pathogenic bacteria and viruses. Given the high surface area of the maturation ponds, protozoan cysts and helminth eggs are also removed, with sedimentation as the main mechanism.

Sludge accumulation is very low in maturation ponds.

Very high pathogen removal efficiencies may be achieved, depending on several factors: temperature, hydraulic retention time (the amount of time the liquid remains in the system - from entrance to exit), the number of ponds in the series, the presence of baffles and the depth of ponds.

Maturation ponds may be used in combination with a rainwater reservoir to form an ecological, self-purifying irrigation reservoir.

== Application and suitability ==
Waste stabilization ponds are very efficient in their primary objective of removing organic matter and, under some conditions, pathogenic organisms. Their design criteria have changed very little over the years. Ponds are simple to design, build, operate and maintain, which is very important in remote areas and in developing countries where sophisticated equipment and highly skilled labor is not easily available. Construction may be done by local contractors in small towns.

Waste stabilization ponds work well in nearly all environments and can treat most types of wastewater. They are particularly well-suited for tropical and subtropical countries because the intensity of the sunlight and temperature are key factors for the efficiency of the removal processes. Ponds are used throughout the world. In many countries and regions ponds are the most widely used treatment process. For this reason, they are one of the processes recommended by WHO for the treatment of wastewater for reuse in agriculture and aquaculture, especially because of their effectiveness in removing nematodes (worms) and helminth eggs.

Ponds cannot achieve very high efficiencies in the removal of organic matter, and usually have low capacities for removing nitrogen and phosphorus. The effluent usually has high concentrations of suspended solids, resulting from algal production in the ponds. Therefore, ponds are not a suitable technology in areas where stringent discharge standards exist, unless additional stages of post treatment are included.

Since ponds require large areas, they may not be practical in proximity to towns where land is expensive. A suitable topography and a suitable soil structure are also desired, in order to reduce construction costs.

== Operation and maintenance ==

Regarding operation and maintenance, the tasks performed by the operational staff are very simple and do not require special skills. Additionally, there is no energy consumption for aeration, no need of heavy equipment maintenance and no frequent sludge removal, sludge treatment and disposal.

Ponds require very little maintenance, since there is no heavy electric or mechanical equipment that requires attention. The only routine maintenance needed is on the preliminary treatment (cleaning of screens and removal of sand), routine checking of pipes, weirs and other hydraulic structures, and removal of unwanted vegetation growth in embankments. 

=== Sludge removal ===
Sludge accumulates inside the ponds. It needs to be removed only in the interval of several years. This is an important advantage of the system. However, when removal is necessary, it is usually an expensive and labor-intensive operation. Removal is more frequent in anaerobic ponds (every few years), because of their smaller volume and lower capacity to store the sludge, compared with facultative ponds. In facultative ponds, sludge removal may be necessary only in intervals around 15 to 25 years. In maturation ponds, sludge accumulation is very low.

Sludge removal, also called desludging, may be done in two basic ways: (i) interrupting the operation of the pond for desludging or (ii) keeping the pond in operation while desludging. In the first case, the influent wastewater to the pond to be desludged is closed. Afterwards, the pond is drained and the bottom sludge is left for open drying for several weeks. During this period, the wastewater to be treated needs to be diverted to other ponds in the system. After the sludge has dried, its removal may be done manually (very laborious in large ponds) or mechanically using tractors or mechanical scrapers. In the second alternative, when the pond is left in operation during desludging, the removed sludge will be wet and will require further drying. This is undertaken outside the pond. Sludge removal can be by suction and pumping using vacuum trucks (only for small ponds), dredging, pumping from a raft or involving other mechanical equipment. In either case, the amount of sludge to be removed is very high, considering its accumulation over a period of years. This process is very laborious, expensive and requires careful planning.

== Costs ==
In the selection of a wastewater treatment process, besides the technical aspects that are relevant to each alternative, also cost factors play a very important role. The latter can be basically divided into (i) construction costs and (ii) operation and maintenance costs. Waste stabilization ponds are usually considered a cheap alternative in terms of construction costs. However, the final costs will depend essentially on the size of ponds, presence of maturation ponds in the process configuration, topography, soil conditions, groundwater level and land cost. 

Because all these elements are site-specific, it is difficult to generalize overall construction costs. In most cases these will be lower compared with other wastewater treatment alternatives. Depending on the specific situation of the area, construction costs can increase and level up with other technologies.

Waste stabilization ponds are one of the cheapest wastewater treatment processes in terms of operation and maintenance.

== Comparison with other infrastructure ==
The following types of water and wastewater infrastructure may superficially resemble waste stabilization ponds, but are not the same:
* Aerated lagoons rely upon mechanical aerators to provide oxygen to stabilize organic matter. Aerated lagoons may be used as the first stage in the treatment line instead of anaerobic ponds to limit release of malodorous gases, but with energy and maintenance requirements causing higher operating costs.
* Constructed wetlands are designed to improve water quality by supporting rooted vegetation arranged to physically remove solids and particulate material while removing soluble nutrients in the water by uptake into plant tissue and supplying oxygen to the water to reduce BOD.
* Retention basins are used to manage stormwater runoff to prevent flooding and downstream erosion, and improve water quality in an adjacent river, stream, lake or bay. Detention basins are similar but are &quot;dry ponds&quot; designed to temporarily hold runoff as a flood control measure.
* Infiltration basins are ponds designed to percolate their contents into underlying permeable soils.
* Settling basins are designed to separate solids from wastewaters without provision for treatment of those solids.

<text>Las Vegas Sands Corp. is an American casino and resort company with corporate headquarters in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States. It was founded by Sheldon G. Adelson and his partners out of the Sands Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. The Sands was demolished and redeveloped as The Venetian, opening in 1999. An adjacent resort, The Palazzo, opened in 2007. Both resorts were sold in 2022.

The company holds several resorts in Asia, including Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, which opened in 2010. Through its majority-owned subsidiary Sands China, the company owns several properties in Macau, including Sands Macao, The Londoner Macao, The Venetian Macao, and The Parisian Macao. As of 2020, it is the third-largest casino company worldwide by revenue.

==History==
===Development on the Las Vegas Strip===
Entrepreneur Sheldon G. Adelson and his partners Richard Katzeff, Irwin Chafetz, Ted Cutler, and Jordan Shapiro bought the Sands Hotel and Casino in 1989. Adelson and his partners financed their venture with investments in personal computers and trade shows, founding the computer trade show COMDEX in 1979. They opened the 1.2 million square foot Sands Expo and Convention Center, then the largest privately owned convention facility in the world, across from the hotel in 1990.

The Sands Hotel was unable to compete with newer resorts on the Las Vegas Strip and was demolished to make room for The Venetian. Construction of the Venetian began in 1997, funded by Adelson&#x27;s sale of COMDEX. Modeled on Venice, Italy, it joined the ranks of themed hotels such as Excalibur, New York-New York, and Paris Las Vegas on the Las Vegas Strip. In 2004, Las Vegas Sands, Inc. went public, and its name was changed to the Las Vegas Sands Corp.

Construction on The Palazzo began in 2005. The Palazzo and The Venetian make up the world&#x27;s largest hotel under one roof, at 7,000 all-suite rooms and 17 million square feet. The 43-story unfinished condominium skyscraper St. Regis Residences at the Venetian Palazzo is on the same campus. Construction halted in 2008 due to company financial issues.

The 2008 financial crisis forced Adelson to invest $1 billion of his own capital to keep the Las Vegas Sands in business, much of which the company spent developing event spaces and high-end retail stores in their properties By 2011, the Las Vegas Sands Corp.&#x27;s main profits came from renting convention space.

===Expansion into Asia===

The company soon recognized new commercial opportunities in Asia, specifically in Macau, the only Special Administrative Region of China where gambling is legal. Las Vegas Sands Corp., along with Wynn Resorts and Galaxy Entertainment Group, was one of the first to be granted a casino operating concession. Sands Macao resort, Macau&#x27;s first American-operated casino, opened in 2004.

Las Vegas Sands Corp.&#x27;s future Macau properties were largely in Cotai, a district of reclaimed land created through public works projects and designated for hotels and casinos. The Venetian Macao, the second-largest in the world at 550,000 square feet, opened in 2007.

In 2008, Las Vegas Sands opened a Four Seasons hotel adjacent to the Venetian Macao. It was followed by The Londoner Macao, originally branded Sands Cotai Central, and The Parisian Macao.

Development plans proceeded in 2010 for Marina Bay Sands resort in Singapore, at $5.6 billion the most expensive hotel and casino ever built. The resort was designed by Israeli-Canadian architect Moshe Safdie and is composed of three 57-story towers connected at the top by a 3-acre SkyPark(R). The integrated resort was the second built in Singapore after Resorts World Sentosa. Eight months after opening, Marina Bay Sands set a record for posting a $600 million operating profit.

In September 2012, the Las Vegas Sands Corp. announced that Madrid had been chosen as destination for a casino resort project dubbed EuroVegas in an attempt to expand outside of Asia. In February 2013, the company named the town of Alcorcón, on the outskirts of Madrid, as the site for the EuroVegas project. Plans included six casinos, twelve hotels, a convention center, three golf courses, shopping centers, bars, and restaurants, and was expected to take 10 years to build. In December 2013 the EuroVegas project was officially canceled.

===Recent history===

In 2015, the Las Vegas Sands Corp. and California-based co-developer California-based Majestic Realty Co. proposed a $1.2 billion 65,000-seat stadium located near The Strip for the Oakland Raiders football team. The proposal required $420 million from private investors and $780 million in public funding, primarily from tourism. Despite Las Vegas Sands withdrawing from the project, the Raiders eventually moved into the stadium after relocating from Oakland. 

The company&#x27;s 2018 annual report anticipated &quot;a significant and adverse effect&quot; from the &quot;proliferation of gaming venues, particularly in Southeast Asia.&quot;

In May 2019, the company sold Sands Bethlehem to the Poarch Band of Creek Indians for $1.3 billion, and it was renamed Wind Creek Bethlehem.

Las Vegas Sands is one of multiple bidders trying to open a commercial casino in Downstate New York. Las Vegas Sands has proposed building an integrated resort at the Nassau Coliseum site in Uniondale, New York. 

== Finances ==

The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the company&#x27;s finances with a 97.1% decrease in revenue and a second-quarter fiscal loss of $985 million. In March 2021, two months after Sheldon G. Adelson&#x27;s death, the company announced the sale of its Las Vegas properties to Vici Properties and its operations to Apollo Global Management. The sale was finalized in February 2022.

As of 2021, the Las Vegas Sands Corp. is headed by CEO Robert Glen Goldstein, and reported a 2020 annual revenue of $3.61 billion.

==Political contributions==
According to OpenSecrets, Las Vegas Sands donated $52.9 million to Republican candidates as the largest single contributor to federal campaigns during the 2012 election cycle. By comparison, Adelson Drug Clinic was the second-largest solely Republican contributor during the 2012 election cycle with $42.1 million donated. Since 1992, Las Vegas Sands has contributed $70.5 million to federal campaigns; since 1999 the company has spent $5.4 million on lobbying.

Miriam Adelson has been one of Donald Trump’s top donors during all three of his presidential campaigns. Adelson has also provided financial supporter to the Zionist Organization of America, the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum and memorial in Jerusalem, and multiple U.S. groups that fundraise for the Israeli military.

==Initiatives==

Las Vegas Sands has their own sustainability initiative roadmap called Sands ECO360, centered on identifying eco-friendly processes surrounding building development, resort management, and events.

One of the company&#x27;s initiatives encourages resort staff to report possible water- or energy-conservation concerns.

Two buildings in Singapore are LEED certified, and several in Macau have received awards for Energy Saving Activities.

==Properties==
Las Vegas Sands holds integrated resorts in Asia including Marina Bay Sands in Singapore and through its majority-owned subsidiary Sands China Ltd. (SCL) owns several integrated resorts in Macao including The Venetian Macao, Sands Macao, The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Hotel, The Londoner Macao and The Parisian Macao.

===Current properties===
=== Former properties ===
==Ownership and stock==

* December 2004: Las Vegas Sands completed its initial public offering with the ticker LVS on the New York Stock Exchange at a price of $29 per share. 6.8% of the company was put on the market. Adelson maintained 87.9% ownership of the company; management and directors owned the remaining 5.3%. 
* October 2007: the company&#x27;s market capitalization peaked at $52 billion at $144.56 a share.
* September 2008: Las Vegas Sands&#x27; stock plummeted to $36.11, prompting Adelson and his wife, Dr. Miriam Adelson, to invest $475 million in the company through a 6.5% convertible note in 2013.
* November 2008: The Adelson family again invested $525 million in Las Vegas Sands, with the company raising an additional $1 billion in a secondary offering. The Adelsons also purchased 5.25 million shares of preferred stock as well as warrants to purchase 87.5 million shares of common stock at an exercise price of $6 each.
* March 2009: market capitalization sinks to approximately $1 billion at less than $2 a share due to general market declines and concern for the short-term financial health of the gambling industry.
* November 2009: Las Vegas Sands completed an initial public offering of its subsidiary Sands China Ltd., which owns and operates its Macau properties. The company raised a total of $3.3 billion in equity capital by selling a 29% interest in Sands China Ltd.
* 2012: CEO Sheldon G. Adelson and his family owned approximately 53% of the company.

==Alleged anti-bribery violations==
In March 2013, the New York Times reported that the Las Vegas Sands Corp. had informed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that the company likely violated federal law against the bribery of foreign officials. The Company disputed these reports, stating in a press release:The company did not report any violations of the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA, and it said news reports stating otherwise, such as the headline in today&#x27;s New York Times which described the matter by saying &#x27;Casino Says it Likely Cheated,&#x27; are both inflammatory and defamatory...in [the Company&#x27;s] preliminary findings the company&#x27;s Audit Committee had advised that there were &#x27;likely violations&#x27; of the books and records and internal controls provisions (i.e. &#x27;accounting provisions&#x27;) of the FCPA. A potential violation of the accounting provisions could range anywhere from a single transaction recorded incorrectly to other errors in the accounting records. The company said it will vigorously defend itself against that type of uninformed and misleading reporting.

==Legal issues==
On May 31, 2016, Sands reached a financial settlement with former Sands China president Steve Jacobs, who sued the company in 2010 for breach of contract and wrongful termination. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed, but the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that the company paid Jacobs more than $75 million. Jacobs had claimed he was dismissed for &quot;blowing the whistle on improprieties&quot; in Macau, including Jacobs&#x27; allegations that Adelson had instructed him to investigate senior Macau officials&#x27; potentially damaging financial and business information to use as leverage in future regulatory discussions. Adelson denied these allegations, characterizing Jacobs as a disgruntled ex-employee.

On March 14, 2019, Sands reached a financial settlement with Hong Kong businessman Richard Suen for an undisclosed amount after having sued Las Vegas Sands for the third time, arguing he was owed $347 million by the Company, who countered with $3.76 million. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed, but Sands attorney Richard Sauber said the parties had reached an &quot;amicable settlement and resolution.&quot; Suen had successfully sued Sands twice in 2004 with the claim that he had been promised a $5 million success fee and 2% of Sands&#x27; profits from its operations in Macau in exchange for helping to obtain a Macau casino concession. The trials resulted in awards of $44 million and $70 million, respectively.

In June 2021, the Company was sued in a Macau court by Asian American Entertainment Corporation, who alleged entitlement to $70 million in Las Vegas Sands&#x27; profits in Macau as the company began operating there in 2002.

Prior to the November 2022 elections, Las Vegas Sands conducted a petition drive in Florida, spending $49.5 million to amend the State&#x27;s Constitution to expand casino gambling. The state of Florida is investigating evidence of potentially fraudulent signatures collected during this event.

<text>Spider and Web is a piece of interactive fiction written by Andrew Plotkin.

&quot;Spider and Web&quot; begins innocuously enough: the player&#x27;s character, an apparent tourist, has wandered into a blind alley. Upon trying to leave the alley, however, the character is confronted by a voice sneering that this is a lie and threatening dire consequences if the truth is not told. Gradually, the player pieces together that the main character is an unnamed spy who is being interrogated by an equally anonymous enemy. Through interruptions and prodding, the interrogator reveals that the spy was captured in the process of infiltrating an installation under the guise of a tourist.

Most of the commands the player gives are actually part of a story the character is telling to the interrogator. Any part of the story that the interrogator disputes is challenged; the player is executed after a number of these &quot;challenges&quot;. Thus, the player&#x27;s main goal is to tell the captors a plausible story to explain what they already know (or more precisely, what they &quot;think&quot; they already know).

On June 24, 2014 the author released the source code for educational purposes.

<doc id="1340505" wikidata="Q7894606" url="?curid=1340505" title="University College, Bristol">
<text>University College, Bristol was an educational institution which existed from 1876 to 1909. It was the predecessor institution to the University of Bristol, which gained a royal charter in 1909. During its time the college mainly served the middle classes of Bristol, and catered for young men who had entered a family business and needed a greater understanding of scientific topics.

==Origins==
The history of University College, Bristol and ultimately the University of Bristol can be traced as far back as 1872 and the attempts of John Percival, a local educationalist and headmaster of Clifton College, to press for the creation of a college. Percival was a supporter of the education of women, having founded an Association for the Promotion of the Higher Education of Women in 1868, and an Association for the Promotion of Evening Classes a year later. Percival&#x27;s strong Christian religious views (he later became a bishop) influenced his views on education, in that he believed that opportunities should be available to both males and females irrespective of their declared faith. He is credited with the initial idea that there should be a university in Bristol. Lewis Fry, a later influence on the college and the subsequent university, is quoted as saying that it was to Percival that they owed the foundation of the college.

In 1872 Percival wrote a letter to the Oxford colleges noting the lack of a university culture in the provinces. He also canvassed support when Bristol Medical School was looking for a new building and in 1873 he suggested to the Medical School Council that they both approach the Bristol Museum and Library Society to attempt to establish a college. This allowed the creation of a committee to promote the scheme led by the dean of Bristol, which contained prominent Bristol politicians from the Liberal and Conservative Parties and members representing local industry. It was in July 1876 that the medical school agreed to affiliate with the college in return for the promise that it would be supplied with additional space to expand, a promise which was eventually honoured three years later. This building now houses the University of Bristol&#x27;s Department of Geography.

In 1873 Percival wrote a pamphlet entitled &quot;The Connection of the Universities and the Great Towns&quot; which was met with a positive response from Benjamin Jowett, a connection of Percival, who at this time was the Master of Balliol College. His promise of sponsorship initially helped the project. It was Percival&#x27;s connections with the colleges of Oxford which helped in lobbying for the creation of the university. Percival was able to agree that the Master of Balliol College would subscribe £300 to the project, on the terms that adult education was catered for and that the college catered for the arts as well as the sciences.
On 11 June 1874 the Victoria Rooms hosted a meeting to promote what was described as a College of Science and Literature for the West of England and South Wales. The meeting was attended by the then president of the British Association and Sir William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin). This meeting has been described as a partial success, as it gained the support of Albert Fry and Lewis Fry, members of the influential Fry family (the Fry name being known for the chocolate business set up by their grandfather and developed by their father Joseph Storrs Fry). Lewis Fry was a Quaker, lawyer and later a Liberal and Unionist Member of Parliament from 1885 to 1892 and 1895 to 1890 for the constituency Bristol North. Albert Fry also gained distinction as the founder of the Bristol Wagon &amp; Carriage Works Co. However, the fact that the project attracted large numbers of Quakers, Non-Conformists and Liberals meant that the project was labelled as such an institution. Tories made some initial grants to the project but soon focused their interest on a rival institution through the Society of Merchant Venturers which was considered mostly Conservative in politics. Ironically, the Society of Merchant Venturers, which was to become a rival institution during much of the college&#x27;s history, made a gift of £1000 at this point.

Despite this initial donation, a lack of funds was to plague University College, Bristol up until the donations which allowed it to lobby for a royal charter. Initially the financial response to the meeting was disappointing, with the college gaining only £25,991 of the £40,000 funds which it asked for. It was at this stage that the Wills family became involved in the project with Henry Overton Wills donating £250 to the project. The lacklustre response to the call for funds had the immediate result of delaying the opening of the college until 1876, and meant that when it did open it was under the most stringent financial conditions. Shelborne notes that the setting up of the college struggled due to the fact that Bristol lacked a significant industry which saw benefit in the creation a college, an absence of the &quot;nouveaux riches&quot;, and no philanthropic industrialists who wished to highlight the importance of Bristol.

==Opening of University College, Bristol==
University College, Bristol opened on Tuesday 10 October 1876 at 9.00 a.m. with a mathematics lecture by W. R. Bousfield, who also lectured in higher maths an hour later. The charges for such a course were three guineas for two lectures each week during the Christmas and Easter terms; a student also had to pay 7s as an entrance fee to enroll. At its opening in 1876, two professors and five lecturers offered lectures in fifteen subject areas. The college was situated at 32 Park Row and was rented for £50 per annum. As requested by Jowett when giving money, the college was open to men and women on the same basis (except in medicine), The college offered scholarships, the most valuable of which was one in chemistry worth £25. General scholarships of £15 were also available. Despite the label of &#x27;University&#x27; however, the institution did not have the power to award degrees to its students. There were, however, links with the University of London which allowed the external sitting of these examinations and the Cambridge Local Higher Examinations useful for those who wished to become teachers.

During the first year 30 men and 69 women registered for classes, and there were 238 evening classes, which cost five shillings with a registration fee of one shilling. The buildings rented were used by the college as a deaf and dumb institute. In its early years the college was very poor. The college had raised £23,437, just short of the £25,000 that it was suggested was required at the Victoria Rooms meeting, but in reality this sum fell well short of what would be sufficient. Much of the college&#x27;s initial money was spent on acquiring land such as that beside Rifle Drill Hall, next to where Bristol Grammar School now stands.

Several lecturers at the college achieved reputations in their own subject fields, including Henry Selby Hele-Shaw (Engineering), Silvanus Thompson (Physics), and William Johnson Sollas (Geography). The college lacked any kind of formal syllabus. Students&#x27; reasons for entering the college were varied, with some, such as G. H. Leonard (who later became a professor at the University of Bristol), using their time there as preparation for the Cambridge scholarship examination. One female student is said to have attended &quot;in order to improve after dinner conversation&quot;. However, by the 1880s University College, Bristol could be said to be producing its first graduates.

Jowett&#x27;s connections with Alfred Marshall allowed him to pick Marshall as the first principal of the college. Marshall is now considered one of the most dominant figures in world economics at the beginning of the 20th century. Marshall came to Bristol as a result of his marriage to one of his students Mary Paley at St. John&#x27;s, which required his immediate resignation of his fellowship there in Moral Science. Marshall taught evening classes to young businessmen while his wife taught during the day to ladies. Her salary was deducted from his wages. Today Alfred Marshall has a building of the University of Bristol named after him in recognition of his early influence on the foundation of the university.

Marshall stated his intention to leave in 1879 and was talked out of resigning, but he eventually did so in 1881 during a period of acute financial struggle for the college. Marshall&#x27;s reasons for resignation were varied; he found the nature of the job left little time for the reflection needed to pursue his academic work, and he preferred academia to administration. The financial situation of the college played a part, and he found the need to &quot;beg&quot; to maintain the institution&#x27;s finances distasteful. There was an obvious successor to the position of principal, with chemistry professor William Ramsay replacing Marshall in the post.

Ramsay is said to have brought great energy to the talk of improving the college. He embarked on a round of after-dinner parties to promote the college, and in 1883 he was able to build a purpose-built laboratory. In 1884 the college came close to bankruptcy when the treasurer announced that funds would dry up within two months. The college survived, but two professors were given notice of dismissal and their departments were placed on a self-supporting notice. At this time Welsh colleges were able to receive financial support but not English ones, so English colleges therefore decided to lobby the Government for funding. The result was that English colleges would receive a grant of £15000, of which Bristol gained the modest share of £1,200. Ramsay resigned his post in 1887 after being appointed chair of chemistry at University College London. Although no longer principal, after his resignation he used his influence to lobby the college council to appoint his assistant Morris Travers to the chair of chemistry when the position became vacant. Travers is credited with pushing forward the Charter campaign during the beginning of the 20th century.

When Conwy Lloyd Morgan was appointed he was only given the lesser title of Dean of University College, Bristol, and it was only in 1891 when finances had improved that he was given the title of principal. Morgan had come to Bristol in 1884 from a post in Cape Town, South Africa. Today he is considered to be one of the first experimental psychologists, but he came to Bristol to replace the geology teacher William Johnson Sollas. He is considered to have coined much of the terminology regarding contemporary animal science. At Bristol he became fully involved in the campaign to gain the college a royal charter.

The financial problems of the college were based upon the fact that there had been a failure to find a &#x27;local Carnegie&#x27; – a business magnate who could finance the university by providing endowments and financing the payment of staff. The passing of the Technical Instruction Act empowered local authorities to level a rate for technical instruction. Bristol was able to apply for a further £2,000 in funds and a further £500 was gained in return for an agreement that free places would be made available to some students. This money was used to build an engineering block. A few months earlier the Medical School building had been finished and formally incorporated into the college. It was not until 1899 that the college began to receive any kind of state funding, leading one lecturer to joke that the motto of the college should be not &quot;Knowledge is power&quot; but &quot;College is poor&quot;; until this time the college was wholly dependent upon the student fees paid for the courses. However, the college was expanded as finances allowed during the 1890s after it had teetered on the edge of bankruptcy several times the decade before.

By 1897 some anxiety was caused by the opening of a Bristol Technical College which began to draw some of the students who would have attended University College, Bristol. However, it is argued that this threat was more imaginary than real as the University College was able to cater for more academic interests.

==Campaign for a royal charter==
At the turn of the century the chances of the college gaining a royal charter seemed a distant prospect. Many on the College Council were aware of the need to progress and achieve greater financial support including Lewis Fry. They were aware that was it not for the anonymous donations made to the college (by a Mr Fenwick Richards) during the last century there would have been bankruptcy. The establishment of the University Colston Society (named after one of Bristol&#x27;s great benefactors Edward Colston) was the impetus for the campaign to create a university for Bristol and the West of England. It was non-political and was aimed at shaking off the image that the college was a Liberal institution as it was recognised broad political support needed to be generated in order for the plan to become a university to succeed. The first Society Dinner was held on 7 December 1899 with the guest speaker James Bryce (later Viscount Bryce).

In 1900 a committee was set under the chairmanship of the Bishop of Bristol. However, the committee only ever had one meeting after the first resulted in the announcement that a report into the viability of a university for Bristol would require a Registrar at a cost of £1000 per annum. There was some debate as to whether an autonomous University should be formed for Bristol and the West of England or whether a federal organisation should be created which included University College, Bristol as well as Merchant Venturers&#x27; Technical College as possibly the colleges of Reading, Exeter and Southampton. Lord Haldane had proposed the idea of a federal university as a compromise but it failed to increase support.

Morris Travers who gained the post of lecture in chemistry at the college is generally credited with pushing forward the campaign to gain a charter by courting the local press and pressing for the support of the Fry brothers who held power on the City power continuously from 1882 and 1909. There is evidence that Marshall had told Travers to reject the compromise idea of a federal university and push for a Bristol university. Travers spoke to Lewis Fry head of the College Council on 1 February 1905 and was able to make Fry write to relatives to increase support. Lewis Fry was able to get the Conservative chairman of the City Education Committee to agree to the idea of setting up a university. Travers wrote pamphlets advocating the university and editorials were written for the &quot;Bristol Times&quot; supporting the university.

By 1905 it could be stated that the national government were supportive of the idea of setting up a university in Bristol. Here, two piece of fortune occurred. The Blind Asylum on Queen&#x27;s Road at the top of Park Street, where the Wills Memorial Building now stands, came up for sale. Travers picked up a telephone line which was shared with the Asylum and was able to eavesdrop and hear the conversation which stated that the trustees were preparing to sell. Although with a price of £40,000 for the land it seemed unlikely the college could afford to purchase the plot, on 11 January 1906, William Travers was told by Lewis Fry that he had been promised the money to purchase the plot by several members of the Fry family and Wills Family: his brother Joseph Storrs Fry (£10,000), cousin Francis Fry (£5,000), Sir William Henry Wills (£10,000) and Sir Fredrick Wills (£5,000). It was the Wills and Fry families who were the chief benefactors of what became the University of Bristol. Joseph Storrs Fry was a successful businessman but the wealth of the Fry family was small in relation to that of the Wills. Frederick Wills had sat on University College councils and between 1900 and 1906 was the sitting MP for Bristol North, the seat that was previously occupied by Lewis Fry. William Henry Wills was first chairman of Imperial Tobacco and his families personal estate was estimated to make the Wills family one of the richest families in the land.

The second fortunate event occurred in January 1906 when the Merchant Venturers&#x27; Technical College was destroyed by fire. The Merchant Venturers saw University College, Bristol as dominated by Liberals and therefore supported the Bristol Trade School instead. The fire made the organisation worried about its future and removed any objection which they would have to the creation of a university.
In 1906 a committee to promote the creation of the university was established. Lewis Fry was able to announce that £30,000 as an endowment fund was to be given by Lord Winterstoke (a member of the Wills Family). The Merchant Venturers had negotiations to join with the college but were unable to a complete amalgamation wanted to retain some autonomy. There was another setback when Travers left the project to work on the setting up of an Indian Research Institution in Bangalore. Travers can be credited with significantly moving forward the project but the issue of finances remained still remained.

On 14 January 1908 at the annual College Colston society dinner George Alfred Wills rose to his feet and dramatically announced the news that his father, Henry Overton, was to donate £100,000 to the cause promoting the creation of the university providing that a royal charter was obtained within two years. Records note that the room began to cheer after the announcement was made. This announcement caused further funds to be promised by those attending the university. The day ended with the university endowment fund standing at five times greater than it had at the start with the university scheme attracting more in 24-hours than it did in its entire history. The raising of such large firms meant that the Privy Council could not argue that the creation of what were then disparagingly known as &#x27;Lilliputian&#x27; Universities would in any way result in a decrease in the standard of British universities. H.O. Wills had little contact with the college apart from the fact that he had sent his son Harry to classes there. He died in 1911 after becoming the first chancellor of the University of Bristol. The Wills Memorial Building was built by his two surviving sons in memory at a cost of £500,000. The impact of the Wills family upon the university can also be founding in the naming of the H.H. Wills Physics Laboratory built by George in memory of his brother which cost some £200,000 and the building of Wills Hall, a hall of residence for the university in Stoke Bishop. Unlike many of the supporters of the university the Wills were not Liberals or Quakers but Congregationalists.

Later an agreement with the Merchant Venturers was made with the organisation being merged with the college&#x27;s engineering department to create a new faculty of engineering. All teaching was to take place in the Merchant Venturers Building. The principal Julius Wertheimer was left with little bargaining power after the destruction of his own institutions buildings. As government funding was linked to endowment this massive endowment created further wealth for the college. Later in 1908 a petition was presented to the Privy Council representing the views of the University Committee. On 24 May 1909 Bristol University, as it then became known, gained its royal charter allowing it to award degrees after the king in Privy Council assented to the creation of a university. Flags were flown from public buildings in Bristol and the city&#x27;s church bells hang out on receiving the news.

==Hodgson affair==
In 1916 the head of the head of the women&#x27;s secondary teacher training department, Geraldine Hodgson was dismissed for reasons that were not made clear. Hodgson had served since 1902 and she was a published author and a graduate. Jealousy of her achievements, her support for the suffrage movement and a dispute with the vice-chancellor, Isambard Owen, are possible factors. Hodgson ended her career at Ripon and Wakefield and Bradford Diocesan Training College.

<text>Storkyrkan (, ), also called Stockholms domkyrka (Stockholm Cathedral) and Sankt Nikolai kyrka (Church of Saint Nicholas), is the oldest church in Stockholm. Storkyrkan lies in the centre of Stockholm in Gamla stan, between Stockholm Palace and Stortorget, the old main square of Stockholm. It was consecrated to Saint Nicholas in 1306 but construction of the church probably started in the 13th century. Inside, Storkyrkan still maintains much of its late medieval appearance in the form of a hall church with a vaulted ceiling supported by brick pillars. The exterior of the church is however uniformly Baroque in appearance, the result of extensive changes made in the 18th century. The church played an important role during the Reformation in Sweden as the place where Mass was celebrated in Swedish for the first time. It currently serves as the seat of the Bishop of Stockholm within the Church of Sweden since the creation of the Diocese of Stockholm in 1942.

Storkyrkan was for a long time the only parish church of Stockholm, and from an early date it was connected with the Swedish royal family. It has been the scene of historical events on numerous occasions, and was used as a coronation church for centuries. More recently, the wedding between Crown Princess Victoria and Daniel Westling took place in the church in 2010. Military victories as well as national tragedies have been commemorated in Storkyrkan, and it is still used for funerals of public figures such as the writers Astrid Lindgren and Sara Danius.

The church contains several important works of art as well as elaborate furnishings, among these a late medieval sculpture of &quot;Saint George and the Dragon&quot; and Vädersolstavlan, a painting which shows one of the earliest images of Stockholm.

==Location and surroundings==

Storkyrkan is the oldest church in Stockholm and was originally the parish church of the entire city, and as such was built at the very centre of the medieval city. It lies at the highest point of Gamla stan, wedged between the Stock Exchange Building and Stockholm Palace. The church, together with the palace, Stortorget and the first town hall of Stockholm (located on the site of the present stock exchange building), formed the heart of the earliest urban development. While the interior of the church still retains much of its medieval appearance, the exterior of the church is largely the result of changes made in the 18th century. Together with the Royal Palace, the Axel Oxenstierna palace, Slottsbacken and its obelisk, and the Tessin Palace, it is part of a coherent ensemble of Baroque architecture. It has been described as an &quot;irreplaceable&quot; part of the cityscape of Stockholm.

Storkyrkan is surrounded on three sides by streets (Trångsund to the west, Storkyrkobrinken and Högvaktsterrassen to the north and Slottsbacken to the east). A courtyard is located immediately south of the church. On the opposite side the courtyard faces the back of the stock exchange buildings, and two small pavilions, designed by Erik Palmstedt as wings of the stock exchange, were actually built as the burial chapel and coach-house of the church. They were built in 1767. To the west and east the courtyard is limited by walls, with openings through wrought iron gates. The posts of both gates were originally decorated with allegorical statues, although only the couple on the west gate are still in place. These two statues probably depict Reason (on the south post) and Divine Love (on the north post), and were made by Peter Schultz in 1675. The statues formerly on the posts of the east gate depict females symbolising Caution and Hope. The pair was made in 1702 by .

Another statue, depicting the Swedish reformer Olaus Petri, stands adjacent to the east facade of the church. It faces Slottsbacken and forms part of the church ensemble even though it is not formally connected to Storkyrkan. It was inaugurated in 1898 and made by . In the pavement next to the east facade there are also lines which mark the former extent of a church choir, demolished during the reign of King Gustav Vasa.

==History of the building==
===Middle Ages===

The presence of a church in Stockholm was indicated for the first time in 1279. The consecration of the city church is furthermore mentioned in 1306, making Storkyrkan the oldest church in Stockholm. The earliest history of the church is thus somewhat unclear: Stockholm was founded in the middle of the 13th century and it has been considered unlikely that the city would not have a functioning church until 1306. Tradition also holds that Birger Jarl founded the church. It is therefore possible that the church inaugurated in 1306 was preceded by another church, or that it was under construction for a long time, or perhaps re-dedicated in 1306. Regardless, the oldest parts of the current building probably belong to the church which was inaugurated in 1306. During the entire Middle Ages, the main patron saint of the church was Saint Nicholas. Several churches in the Baltic region from the 13th century are dedicated to Saint Nicholas, especially in cities where the Hanseatic League had a presence, as was the case in Stockholm. The church was also dedicated to Saint Mary and Saint Eric. The church remained the only parish church of Stockholm, serving the entire city, until the 1590s. In general, the medieval history of the church building is complex and difficult to determine in detail. There are few written sources, and a lack of ornaments has made it difficult to draw any conclusions about the age of the different parts on stylistic grounds.

Originally, the church appears to have consisted of a nave with two aisles. It had a wooden ceiling supported by six pillars. The building material was brick. The main entrance was probably located to the west, though side entrances may have existed in the north and south walls. Stylistically, the church was part of a group of brick churches built in the area around Lake Mälaren at the time, including Strängnäs Cathedral, St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Sigtuna and . The church was successively rebuilt and enlarged during the 14th and 15th centuries. Embellishing the church was a way for both the monarchs of Sweden and the citizens of Stockholm to demonstrate their power and influence. 

A donation to the church in 1346 by King Magnus IV and his wife Blanche of Namur probably indicates that the first of a number of chapels had been added to the church. This chapel was originally dedicated to Saint Mary and was located at the south side of the east end of the church. The four bays that belonged to the chapel are still discernible in the interior of Storkyrkan. Similar chapels were built at approximately the same time at Visby Cathedral and St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Lübeck. The chapel was decorated with Early Gothic murals in a style unusual for Swedish churches (later heavily restored). A second chapel was added to the church sometime before 1361, and further chapels were built during the early 15th century. By the end of the Middle Ages, Storkyrkan contained more than 30 chapels or specifically dedicated altarpieces, an amount only comparable with the cathedrals of medieval Sweden. The church thus grew piecemeal by the addition of chapels. Another set of murals, painted by Albertus Pictor and decorating the south west vaults (the paintings are currently not visible from the floor of the church) was also added during the 15th century. Between 1474 and 1496, a major reconstruction of the church was carried out which then incorporated these chapels into a single, unified space and installed new vaults, creating a uniformly high ceiling. The church was at approximately the same time also substantially expanded toward the east, while a choir was also added. This was partially because the church had become too small for the growing population of the city. The choir was demolished during the 16th century. The tower was also built in the early 15th century and was originally intended mainly as a defensive tower. By the end of the 15th century Storkyrkan had acquired the basic shape and size that it still has.

===Reformation and later changes===
During the 16th century, the Reformation in Sweden led to important changes for the church. Catholicism was abandoned and Lutheranism was adopted. The state confiscated much of the property of the church, including large amounts of silver from the chapels and altars of Storkyrkan. Although Sweden as a whole did not suffer from any extensive outbreaks of iconoclasm during the Reformation, some of the formerly Catholic sculptures of the church were vandalised. When Christian II of Denmark resided in Stockholm in 1520, the church was fortified, a reflection of the political tensions which, among other things, led to the Stockholm Bloodbath in 1521. Adam van Düren was responsible for these works, and he also made an allegorical sculpture adorning the base of one of the pillars of the church. It depicts a male and a female lion and an eel, together with a satirical inscription of dubious meaning. Some further changes to the pillars, vaults and walls of the church were made during the reign of King John III in order to further harmonise the interior space.

===Changes during the 18th century===

During the 18th century, the facade of Storkyrkan underwent far-reaching changes. The medieval exterior was completely transformed into a Baroque exterior. Nicodemus Tessin the Younger had put forward a proposal to remake the facade in a more contemporary style. In 1736, Johan Eberhard Carlberg was employed to oversee repairs of the church tower. Relatively soon, the commission expanded to a complete overhaul of the exterior and a new tower spire. Both Carlberg and Carl Hårleman, who had succeeded Nicodemus Tessin the Younger as architect of the Royal Palace, instantly produced numerous proposals for a new tower spire, further indicating that the idea of modernising the exterior had been entertained for some time. Particularly Hårleman seems to have viewed the issue from the standpoint that the church should be stylistically incorporated in the palace surroundings. The two architects accused each other&#x27;s designs for the church spire to have technical problems. In the end, Carlberg&#x27;s fourth proposal for a new spire, which was a compromise between his own and Hårleman&#x27;s ideas, was adopted and Carlberg also designed the other changes to the facade. This transformation of the exterior of the church from a Gothic to a Baroque building was carried out between 1736 and 1745. The exterior seen today is still largely the result of Carlberg&#x27;s work.

Further changes were made later in the same century, when architect Erik Palmstedt in 1777 redesigned the south side of the church courtyard in connection with the building of the stock exchange building on Stortorget. At the same time, he also designed the stairwell attached to the south side of the tower, at the west end of the church; the stairwell was finished in 1778. These and some other additions, later demolished, further underlined the Classical appearance of the church and its surroundings, in contrast to its medieval roots. King Gustav III of Sweden wanted to go even further, demolish the entire church and replace it with a new church inspired by the Pantheon in Rome.

===Later history===
The windows were equipped with new, wrought-iron tracery in Neo-Gothic style in the 1860s. Some further changes, not least in order to increase the fire safety of the church, were carried out during the late 19th century. A more thorough renovation was done in 1903–1909 under the guidance of architect Ernst Stenhammar. Among other things, the whitewash which had covered the brick pillars and walls was removed, and the interior has been characterised by the exposed brick since then. It was done as an attempt to recreate a more &quot;medieval&quot; interior, but in fact the interior had probably always been whitewashed. Another comprehensive renovation was carried out 1952–54. The church was raised to the status of cathedral for the newly formed Diocese of Stockholm in 1942.

==Historical significance and royal connections==

Storkyrkan has been the venue of important events in the history of Sweden. The growing wealth and influence of Stockholm during the Middle Ages, and the church&#x27;s vicinity to the Royal Palace, attracted the attention of both the Archbishop of Uppsala and the monarchs of Sweden. The archbishop occasionally appointed a special representative to the church, and frequently intervened in local church matters. On at least one occasion, in 1338, a bishop (Hemming of Turku) was ordained in Storkyrkan.

The Reformation in Sweden was at least partly born in Storkyrkan: it was here that Lutheranism was publicly preached for the first time in Sweden and Storkyrkan was at the same time the first church in Sweden where Mass was celebrated in Swedish (instead of Latin), in 1525. One of the main advocates of the Reformation in Sweden, Olaus Petri, then served as a priest in Storkyrkan. As Storkyrkan from then on was used exclusively by the Swedish-speaking congregation of Stockholm, the sizeable German and Finnish-speaking congregations also moved out to the German Church and a chapel in the town hall, respectively.

The church has been used for the coronation of kings and queens of Sweden on several occasions. The first royal coronation that took place in Storkyrkan was the coronation of Magnus IV and Blanche of Namur in 1336. The coronation was conducted by , Bishop of Tartu, in the presence of all Swedish bishops. Most medieval coronations however took place in Uppsala Cathedral. The next time a coronation took place in Storkyrkan was in 1497, when King John was crowned King of Sweden there, during the Kalmar Union. His son Christian II of Denmark was crowned in Storkyrkan on 4 November 1521 in a ceremony designed to mark the submission of Sweden to the rule of King Christian. During the ceremony, representatives of Emperor Charles V presented the king with the Order of the Golden Fleece. Just a few days later, the Stockholm Bloodbath took place.

For some time it was then considered inauspicious for ruling monarchs to be crowned in Storkyrkan. However, the wedding between King Eric XIV of Sweden and Karin Månsdotter, as well as her coronation following the wedding, took place in Storkyrkan in 1568. Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg was also crowned as Queen of Sweden in Storkyrkan, following her marriage to King Gustavus Adolphus in 1620. The next ruling monarch to be crowned in Storkyrkan was, after a hiatus of 130 years, Queen Christina, in 1650. The coronation of the next two kings were in Uppsala, but King Charles XII again preferred Storkyrkan for his coronation in 1697. The coronation of King Frederick I was also conducted in Storkyrkan, in 1720. From then on the coronations of all Swedish monarchs, with the exception of Gustav IV Adolf, took place in Storkyrkan. The last coronation of a Swedish monarch was that of King Oscar II in 1873, which took place in Storkyrkan.

The church has been used for royal weddings on several occasions. Two of the daughters of King Gustav Vasa were married in Storkyrkan, as well as the son of King John III. The wedding between the future King Oscar I and Josephine of Leuchtenberg took place in Storkyrkan in 1823, and several other members of the royal family were married in the church during the 19th and 20th centuries. In 2010, Storkyrkan was the venue for the wedding of Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden, and Daniel Westling.

While Storkyrkan has rarely been used as a burial church for royalty (instead, Riddarholmen Church fulfilled that role until 1950), a number of high-profile funerals have taken place in Storkyrkan during the 20th century. After the bodies of the three members of the failed Andrée&#x27;s Arctic balloon expedition (Salomon August Andrée, Knut Frænkel and Nils Strindberg) were retrieved and returned to Stockholm in 1930, their funeral was held in Storkyrkan. More recently, the funerals of writer Astrid Lindgren (died 2002) and of the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy Sara Danius (died 2019) were also held in Storkyrkan. When MS &quot;Estonia&quot; sank in 1994 with the loss of many Swedish lives, a memorial service, attended by the royal family and the Prime Minister of Sweden, was held in Storkyrkan. Similarly, the church hosted an extra service after the assassination of foreign minister Anna Lindh in 2003.

Storkyrkan has also been used for other public events. Several military victories were publicly celebrated in the church during the time of the Swedish Empire. The most elaborate of these was probably the celebration of the victory at the Battle of Narva (1700). The victories at Pułtusk (1703), Thorn (1703) and Svensksund (1790) were also publicly celebrated in the church. During the time of the Riksdag of the Estates, the estate of the clergy usually held their meetings in Storkyrkan. Still today, a sermon in Storkyrkan traditionally marks the opening of the Riksdag every autumn. During the Middle Ages the church was also used for meetings of the city council of Stockholm.

==Architecture==

===Exterior===
The building material of the church is brick. The base of the church is strengthened with sandstone and granite. Storkyrkan is &quot;of modest proportions&quot;; it is long and wide. The exterior of the church is uniformly Baroque, and only the stairwell added by Palmstedt is in a slightly different style. The north and south facades are divided by buttresses treated as pilasters. Otherwise, the elements of the exterior are oriented horizontally rather than vertically. The tower and the gables of the church are decorated with pilasters and mouldings, in a simplified version of Carlberg&#x27;s original proposal. At the south east corner of the church, a sundial from the 16th century is attached to the wall. A large memorial plaque with an inscription in Latin is placed in the middle of the east wall of the church, commemorating the rebuilding of the church in the 18th century. 28 windows supply the interior with light. The main entrance is in the base of the tower at the west end of the church. Another entrance is located in the north wall, and there are two lesser entrances to the south.

===Interior===
Storkyrkan is a hall church, five bays wide and eight bays long. The plan is that of an irregular rectangle, as the form of the building had to be adapted to pre-existing adjacent streets. Brick vaults supported by pillars and richly articulated compound piers cover the entire interior. The eight central bays are covered with rib vaults of a complex and unusual design. The rest of the church has groin vaults. The interior space is divided by the central nave, with open benches on either side. The choir floor is three steps higher than the rest of the church and limited by wrought iron fences to the north and south. Three galleries are placed in the west of the interior, one of which contains the church organ. Most of the windows are clear, but the north westernmost window is decorated with stained glass made by Einar Forseth in the 20th century. The stained glass rose window in the east wall was donated to the church in 1858. It was made in France.

==Furnishings==
===Altarpiece===

The main altarpiece of Storkyrkan is the so-called silver altarpiece (). It was donated by Margareta Pedersdotter, widow of Johan Adler Salvius, in 1652. The altarpiece consists of a central part and two wings; the wings were made somewhat later than the middle section. The Baroque altarpiece was made in the workshop of Eustachius Erdmüller in Hamburg. It is made of ebony and silver. The central part is divided into three levels above a predella and surmounted by a statuette of the resurrected Christ. Each of the levels contains a panel with a silver relief. The reliefs depict, from bottom to top, the Crucifixion, the Entombment and Christ in realm of the dead. The relief on the predella depicts the Last Supper. The relief depicting the Crucifixion is the largest, and its composition may have been inspired by the painting &quot;Christ on the Cross&quot; by Peter Paul Rubens from 1620. Free-standing silver statuettes flank the central panels. Moses and John the Baptist flank the Crucifixion panel. The second and third panel are flanked by the Four Evangelists.

During the Middle Ages, the church possessed several additional altarpieces. Some of these have been preserved in other locations. The altarpiece currently in Boglösa Church in Uppland was made for Storkyrkan in the 15th century but sold sometime between 1478 and 1481. The altarpiece currently in Jäder Church in Södermanland originally also belonged to Storkyrkan. A third altarpiece, made in Lübeck in 1468, probably by Hermen Rode, is preserved in the Swedish History Museum. Another altarpiece was donated to Storkyrkan in 1629 by Carl Gyllenhielm, who had taken it as loot from Braniewo in present-day Poland. After the silver altarpiece was installed, Gyllenhielm&#x27;s altarpiece became redundant and was eventually given away. Only the central part of it still exists, and is today located in in Småland.

===Saint George and the Dragon===
North of the choir stands a large, late medieval equestrian statue depicting the legend of &quot;Saint George and the Dragon&quot;. It has been described as &quot;the most impressive medieval piece of art&quot; as well as &quot;the most curious memorial&quot; in Storkyrkan. The statue is around tall and depicts the saint on horseback, fighting the dragon. A subsidiary group shows the princess that the saint is rescuing from the dragon, accompanied by the symbolic Lamb of God. The plinth is furthermore decorated with scenes from the legend of Saint George.

It was commissioned by regent Sten Sture the Elder as a funerary monument for him and his wife, after his victory over Danish troops at the Battle of Brunkeberg in 1471. Sten Sture had prayed to the saint to protect the army during the battle. The sculpture was inaugurated in 1489. &quot;Saint George and the Dragon&quot; does not carry any signature, but is widely attributed to Bernt Notke, both on stylistic grounds and by deduction from archival sources. The sculpture has been interpreted, and was probably intended, as not only a religious work of art, but also as a political as well as a personal monument to Sten Sture and his victory over the Danish army.

===Other medieval furnishings===
The church is also in possession of a crucifix, possibly also made by Notke or an artist working in the same tradition. The crucifix is made of oak and has lost its earlier polychromy. It was probably made some time between 1475 and 1500. A rood cross made 1400 previously belonged to Storkyrkan but is today on display at the Museum of Medieval Stockholm.

The baptismal font of the church was made in 1514, according to an inscription on its side. It belongs to a group of baptismal fonts, similar in style, found in central and northern Sweden. It is made of limestone from Uppland.

A tall seven-branched bronze candelabrum, probably made at the end of the 15th century, belongs to the church. It is decorated with sculptures of lions at its foot, and with two human faces on the shaft. Such candelabra are unusual in Sweden (another example exists in Lund Cathedral) but more common in Germany, where it was probably made.

In 1564, the helmet and spurs of Saint Olaf, the oldest preserved war trophies taken by Swedish troops, were put on display in Storkyrkan. In the 1860s they were moved to the Swedish History Museum.

===Vädersolstavlan===
The oldest known depiction of Stockholm in colour is the so-called Vädersolstavlan (&quot;The sun dog painting&quot;), which was donated to the church in 1535 by Olaus Magnus. It was painted by Urban målare. The currently visible painting is however a copy from 1636, made by Jacob Heinrich Elbfas; judging from building details in the painting, it appears to be a faithful reproduction. The painting depicts Stockholm as it appeared in the early 16th century, and above it a sun dog, an atmospheric optical phenomenon, observed over Stockholm on 20 April 1535. The painting was restored in 1998–99.

===Other paintings===
Storkyrkan houses two monumental paintings by David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl, &quot;The Crucifixion&quot; and &quot;The Last Judgment&quot;, painted in 1695 and 1696 respectively. They were originally intended to be displayed in the Royal Chapel at Tre Kronor but were saved from the fire which destroyed the castle and instead put on display in Storkyrkan. &quot;The Crucifixion&quot; is tall, &quot;The Last Judgment&quot; more than .

Among the other paintings in the church, there is an epitaph taken as war loot from Frombork in 1626 and a 17th-century Russian icon of Saint Nicholas probably made in Moscow, which was seized by Swedish troops after a battle in 1703 and donated to the church by General .

===Royal pews and pulpit===

The pulpit of the church is attached to one of the pillars on the north side of the nave. It was designed and constructed by Burchard Precht between 1698 and 1702. It is made of gilt wood and decorated with mouldings and reliefs. One bay east of the pulpit are the two royal pews, one attached to the north and the other to the south pillar of the nave. They are made of two parts. The lower is a seating area closed in by a decorated wooden barrier. Originally a throne was placed in each of the pews. The upper part of each pew is a gilt wooden canopy in the form of an oversize royal crown carried by angelic sculptures against a background in the form of an imitated drapery. The royal pews, intended for the royal family, were designed by Nicodemus Tessin the Younger and constructed by Burchard Precht.

===Graves and funerary monuments===
Until the practice was abolished during the 19th century, burials within the church were considered prestigious and led to the church being crowded with graves. The church still contains a large number of decorated graves and other funerary monuments. Among these, the graves of the family of Jesper Mattson Cruus af Edeby and the grave of Johan Adler Salvius are among the most elaborate. There is also a profusion of memorial plaques attached to the walls; the one celebrating the memory of Nicodemus Tessin the Elder, Nicodemus Tessin the Younger and Carl Gustav Tessin is one of the more recent, made by sculptor Carl Milles.

===Votive ship===
One of the oldest votive ships in the world comes from Storkyrkan. It dates from the 17th century and is today kept in the Maritime Museum in Stockholm. A copy hangs in the church.

==Music==
The organ of Storkyrkan dates from 1960, and was made by Marcussen &amp; Søn in Denmark. The facade of the organ was designed in 1789 and is three bays wide.

The church has been used as a concert venue since the end of the 18th century. Today the church has four choirs. One of these, Storkyrkans Gosskör (&quot;Storkyrkan&#x27;s Boys Choir&quot;) traces its roots to the 17th century. At least three organists of Storkyrkan were also composers; Andreas Düben ( 1597/98–1662), Ferdinand Zellbell the Younger (1719–1780) and Harald Fryklöf (1882–1918).

<text>The Fawn River is a river in the north of the Unorganized Part of Kenora District in Northwestern Ontario, Canada. It is in the Hudson Bay drainage basin and is a right tributary of the Severn River. The Severn/Fawn basin is one of the last few remaining undammed and unregulated watersheds south of the 55th parallel in North America.

==Geography==
The river begins at an unnamed lake and flows northeast through Fawn Lake to Big Trout Lake, the location of the Kitchenuhmaykoosib Inninuwug First Nation (also called the Big Trout Lake First Nation). The river exits the lake at the east and flows north to Angling Lake, the location of the Wapekeka First Nation. The river heads northeast over Ashaway Falls and Crandall Falls, and takes in the right tributaries Little Otter River, Otter River and Fat River. It turns north, takes in the right tributary Pitticow River, then heads northwest. It receives the left tributaries Burning River and Poplar River, and reaches its mouth at the Severn River, which flows to Hudson Bay.

===Tributaries===
*Poplar River (left)
*Burning River (left)
*Pitticow River (right)
*Sugar Creek (right)
*Mink Creek (right)
*Stout Creek (right)
*Fat River (right)
*Otter River (right)
*Little Otter River (right)

== Fawn River Provincial Park ==
Fawn River Provincial Park is a linear waterway park that consists of 2 noncontiguous sections, protecting a wide strip of land on both sides of the Fawn River. The first section runs from its source to Big Trout Lake, and includes Fawn Lake. The second section runs downstream from Angling Lake at Wapekeka Reserve No. 2. It was established in May 1989.

The park is notable for its position on the transition zone between the boreal and sub-arctic forest.

It is a non-operating park without any facilities or services. The park can be used for recreational activities such as fishing, hunting, canoeing, camping and snowmobiling.

==Transportation==
The river can be accessed by air from Big Trout Lake Airport and Angling Lake/Wapekeka Airport.

<doc id="1340533" wikidata="Q161106" url="?curid=1340533" title="Grand Duke Konstantin Pavlovich of Russia">
<text>Konstantin Pavlovich (; ) was a grand duke of Russia and the second son of Emperor Paul I and Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg. He was the heir-presumptive for most of his elder brother Alexander I&#x27;s reign, but had secretly renounced his claim to the throne in 1823. For 25 days after the death of Alexander I, from 19 November (O.S.)/1 December 1825 to 14 December (O.S.)/26 December 1825 he was known as &quot;His Imperial Majesty Konstantin I Emperor and Sovereign of Russia&quot;, although he never reigned and never acceded to the throne. His younger brother Nicholas became tsar in 1825. The succession controversy became the pretext of the Decembrist revolt.

Konstantin was known to eschew court etiquette and to take frequent stands against the wishes of his brother Alexander I, for which he is remembered fondly in Russia, but in his capacity as the governor of Poland he is remembered as a hated ruler.

== Early life ==
Konstantin was born in Tsarskoye Selo on 27 April 1779, the second son of the Tsesarevich Paul Petrovich and his wife Maria Fyodorovna, daughter of Friedrich II Eugen, Duke of Württemberg. Of all Paul&#x27;s children, Konstantin most closely resembled his father both physically and mentally.

His paternal grandmother Catherine the Great named him after Constantine the Great, the founder of the Eastern Roman Empire. A medal with antique figures was struck to commemorate his birth; it bears the inscription &quot;Back to Byzantium&quot; which clearly alludes to Catherine&#x27;s Greek Plan. According to the British ambassador James Harris,


The direction of the boy&#x27;s upbringing was entirely in the hands of his grandmother, the empress Catherine II. As in the case of her eldest grandson (afterwards the emperor Alexander I), she regulated every detail of his physical and mental education; but in accordance with her usual custom, she left the carrying out of her views to the men who were in her confidence. Count Nikolai Saltykov was supposed to be the actual tutor, but he too in his turn transferred the burden to another, interfering personally only on exceptional occasions, and exercised no influence upon the character of the passionate, restless and headstrong boy. The only person who exerted a responsible influence was Cesar La Harpe, who was tutor-in-chief from 1783 to May 1795 and educated both the empress&#x27;s grandsons.

Catherine arranged Konstantin&#x27;s marriage as she had Alexander&#x27;s; Juliane of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, 14, and Konstantin, 16, were married on 26 February 1796. As Caroline Bauer recorded in her memoirs, &quot;The brutal Constantine treated his consort like a slave. So far did he forget all good manners and decency that, in the presence of his rough officers, he made demands on her, as his property, which will hardly bear being hinted of.&quot; Due to his violent treatment and suffering health problems as a result, Juliane separated from Konstantin in 1799; she eventually settled in Switzerland. An attempt by Konstantin in 1814 to convince her to return broke down in the face of her firm opposition.

Konstantin&#x27;s violent behaviour continued unabated. In 1802, he asked a close friend, General Karl Baur, to hand over his mistress, the wife of a Portuguese businessman, Madame Araujo. Baur agreed but Araujo refused to sleep with the Grand Duke. In retaliation, he had her kidnapped and brought to his Marble Palace where “he and his aides beat and gang-raped her, starting with generals, then officers and finally servants and guardsmen, breaking her legs and arms. She died soon afterwards.” Emperor Alexander I attempted to cover up the crime then, when General Kutuzov insisted on investigating, “announced a special commission which outrageously declared that Madame Araujo had died of a stroke”. Konstantin continued as the heir of the empire.

== Napoleonic Wars ==

During this time, Konstantin&#x27;s first campaign took place under the leadership of Suvorov. The battle of Bassignana was lost by Konstantin&#x27;s fault; but at Novi he distinguished himself by personal bravery, so that the emperor Paul bestowed on him the title of tsesarevich, which according to the fundamental law of the constitution belonged only to the heir to the throne. Though it cannot be proved that this action of the tsar denoted any far-reaching plan, it yet shows that Paul already distrusted the grand-duke Alexander.

Konstantin never tried to secure the throne. After his father&#x27;s death in 1801, he led a disorderly bachelor life. He abstained from politics, but remained faithful to his military inclinations, without manifesting anything more than a preference for the externalities of the service. In command of the Imperial Guards during the campaign of 1805, he had a share of the responsibility for the Russian defeat at the battle of Austerlitz, however he did capture the first French Imperial Eagle in the coalition&#x27;s history; while in 1807 neither his skill nor his fortune in war showed any improvement.
After the peace of Tilsit he became an ardent admirer of Napoleon and an upholder of the Russo-French alliance. He therefore lost the confidence of his brother Alexander; to the latter, the French alliance was merely a means to an end. This view was not held by Konstantin; even in 1812, after the fall of Moscow, he pressed for a speedy conclusion of peace with Napoleon, and, like field marshal Kutuzov, he too opposed the policy which carried the war across the Russian frontier to victorious conclusion upon French soil. His personal behaviour towards both his own men and French prisoners was eccentric and cruel.

During the campaign, Barclay de Tolly was twice obliged to send him away from the army due to his disorderly conduct. His share in the battles in Germany and France was insignificant. At Dresden, on 26 August, his military knowledge failed him at the decisive moment, but at La Fère-Champenoise he distinguished himself by personal bravery. In Paris the grand duke excited public ridicule by the manifestation of his petty military fads. His first visit was to the stables, and it was said that he had been marching and drilling even in his private rooms.

== Governor of the Kingdom of Poland ==
Konstantin&#x27;s importance in political history dates from when his brother, Tsar Alexander, installed him in Congress Poland as &quot;de facto&quot; viceroy (however, he was not the &quot;official viceroy&quot;, namestnik of the Kingdom of Poland), with a task of the militarization and discipline of Poland. In Congress Poland, he received the post of commander-in-chief of the forces of the kingdom to which was added in 1819 the command of the Lithuanian troops and of those of the Russian provinces that had belonged to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (so called Western Krai). During his rule, he was in charge of appointing all military leaders, including those in Poland. Each of these men were required to serve his goal of making the Polish Army a similar version of Russia&#x27;s supreme military.

Alexander&#x27;s policies were liberal by the standards of Restoration Europe. Classical liberals lapped up the freedoms of education, scholarship and economic development, but key deficiencies in Poland&#x27;s autonomy like lack of control over the budget, military, and trade left them hungry for more. The Kalisz Opposition, led by the brothers Bonawentura and Wincenty Niemojowski, pressed for reforms including more independence for the judiciary. Alexander, calling their actions an &quot;abuse&quot; of liberty, suspended the Polish parliament (Sejm) for five years and authorised Konstantin to maintain order in the kingdom by any means necessary.
Konstantin, attempting to execute his brother&#x27;s mandate to silence dissent, strengthened the secret police (Ochrana) and suppressed the Polish patriotic movements, leading to further popular discontent. Konstantin also harassed the liberal opposition, replaced Poles with Russians on important posts in local administration and the army and often insulted and assaulted his subordinates, which led to conflicts in the officer corps. The Sejm, until then mostly dominated by supporters of the personal union with Russia, saw his actions as disobedience of the very constitution of which he felt personally proud. That also led to him being mocked, which he did not help by sending his adjutants with threats to those &quot;guilty&quot; of it like Wirydianna Fiszerowa. Nevertheless, Konstantin was an ardent supporter of Polish musicians, such as Maria Agata Szymanowska and Frédéric Chopin.

After 19 years of separation, the marriage of Konstantin and Juliane was formally annulled on 20 March 1820. Two months later, on 27 May, Konstantin married the Polish Countess Joanna Grudzińska, who was given the title of &quot;Her Serene Highness Princess of Łowicz.&quot; Connected with that, he renounced any claim to the Russian succession, which was formally completed in 1822. After the marriage, he became increasingly attached to his new home of Poland.

== Succession crisis and Decembrist Uprising ==
When Alexander I died on 1 December 1825, Grand Duke Nicholas had Konstantin proclaimed emperor in Saint Petersburg. In Warsaw meanwhile, Konstantin abdicated the throne. When that became public knowledge, the Northern Society scrambled in secret meetings to convince regimental leaders not to swear allegiance to Nicholas. The efforts would culminate in the Decembrist revolt.

Under Nicholas I, Konstantin maintained his position in Poland. Differences soon arose between him and his brother because of the part taken by the Poles in the Decembrist conspiracy. Konstantin hindered the unveiling of the organized plotting for independence, which had been going on in Poland for many years, and held obstinately to the belief that the army and the bureaucracy were loyally devoted to the Russian Empire. The eastern policy of the Tsar and the Turkish War in 1828 to 1829 caused a fresh breach between them. The opposition of Konstantin made the Polish army take no part in the war.

== Failed assassination and November Uprising ==
An assassination attempt was made on the life of Grand Duke Konstantin, which precipitated the November 1830 insurrection in Warsaw (the November Uprising). After the attempt on Konstantin&#x27;s life, a secret court was set up to prosecute those who were responsible. &quot;It was learned that Nicholas had ordered the Grand Duke Konstantin ... to start an energetic investigation and court-martial the culprits ... the committee at its session of 27 November decided irrevocably to start the revolution on the evening of the 29th, at 6pm.&quot; Like the assassination, the recruitment of army units by the rebels failed; only two units joined them, and only the capture of the armory and the subsequent arming of the populace kept the revolt alive. Konstantin saw the revolt as a strictly Polish affair and refused to use troops, as he could have, because it was foolish politically. He could trust his Russian troops, but to use them might be considered a violation of the kingdom&#x27;s independence and even an act of war.

Because of that setback, he was limited to the resources around him. If he decided to intervene, it would require a different source of manpower. He was limited to the handful of Polish troops he could gather together. Constantin thus refused to send his troops against the revolutionaries: &quot;The Poles have started this disturbance, and it&#x27;s Poles that must stop it&quot;, and he left the suppression of the revolt in the hands of the Polish government.

Polish Prince Ksawery Lubecki, realizing that the insurgents had formed no government by midnight, assembled some members of the council and other prominent personalities on his own initiative. They sent a delegation to the grand duke, but when he stated again that he did not wish to intervene in any way, the committees decided to take matters into their own hands. Konstantin&#x27;s involvement remained minimal, showing considerable restraint in not wanting to use Russian troops to help put down the rebellion. The timid response that he did give was that he would not attack the city of Warsaw without giving it 48 hours&#x27; notice, that he would intercede between the emperor and the Polish Kingdom, and would not order Lithuanian troops to enter Poland. What he was trying to accomplish was to remain neutral at all costs, which led to a belief among his fellow Russians that he was more sensitive towards the Polish independence than to Russian dominance. The securing of neutrality from Konstantin gave the Polish government the feeling that Russia would not attack Poland and gave it the chance effectively to quash the uprising.

After ensuring Russian neutrality, Konstantin retreated behind Russian lines. That further confused the Polish government regarding its status with Russia because of a previous Russian promise to help put down the rebellion. The patriotic Poles could not have been more pleased. Konstantin, on 3 December, retreated toward Russia. Following the failure of the uprising, Konstantin expressed admiration for the valor of the Polish insurgents. The policy of neutrality at all costs has led to Konstantin being viewed two ways through the scope of history. Either he would be viewed by the Russian royal family as weak and sympathetic to the Poles, or he would be seen as a seed for the idea of a soon to be independent Poland, but he was effectively only trying to avoid a wider war.

== Death and legacy ==
Konstantin died of cholera in Vitebsk (now in Belarus) on 27 June 1831 and did not live to see the suppression of the revolution. His frequent stands against the wishes of the Imperial Family were perceived in Russia as brave, even gallant. In Poland, he was viewed as a tyrant, hated by the military and civilian population alike, and in Polish literature, Konstantin is portrayed as a cruel despot.

==Archives==
Konstantin&#x27;s letters to his grandfather, Frederick II Eugene, Duke of Württemberg, (together with letters from his siblings) written between 1795 and 1797, are preserved in the State Archive of Stuttgart (Hauptstaatsarchiv Stuttgart) in Stuttgart, Germany.

<doc id="1340538" wikidata="Q46815" url="?curid=1340538" title="Israel Museum">
<text>The Israel Museum (, &quot;Muze&#x27;on Yisrael&quot;, ) is an art and archaeology museum in Jerusalem. It was established in 1965 as Israel&#x27;s largest and foremost cultural institution, and one of the world&#x27;s leading encyclopaedic museums. It is situated on a hill in the Givat Ram neighborhood of Jerusalem, adjacent to the Bible Lands Museum, the National Campus for the Archaeology of Israel, the Knesset, the Israeli Supreme Court, and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

The Israel Museum houses a collection of approximately 500,000 items. Its holdings include the world&#x27;s most comprehensive collections of the archaeology of the Holy Land, and Jewish art and life, as well as significant and extensive holdings in the fine arts, the latter encompassing eleven separate departments: Israeli Art, European Art, Modern Art, Contemporary Art, Prints and Drawings, Photography, Design and Architecture, Asian Art, African Art, Oceanian Art, and Arts of the Americas. 

Among the unique objects on display are the Venus of Berekhat Ram, the interior of a 1736 Zedek ve Shalom synagogue from Suriname, necklaces worn by Jewish brides in Yemen, a mosaic Islamic prayer niche from 17th-century Persia, and a nail attesting to the practice of crucifixion in Jesus&#x27; time. An urn-shaped building in the grounds of the museum, the Shrine of the Book, houses the Dead Sea Scrolls and artifacts discovered at Masada. It is one of the largest museums in the region.

==History==
Jerusalem mayor Teddy Kollek was the driving spirit behind the establishment of the Israel Museum, one of the leading art and archaeology museums in the world. The museum houses works dating from prehistory to the present day in its Archaeology, Fine Arts, and Jewish Art and Life Wings and features extensive holdings of biblical and Land of Israel archaeology. Since its establishment in May 1965, the museum has built up a collection of nearly 500,000 objects, representing a broad sample of world material culture.

On October 25, 2017, Ido Bruno was appointed Director of the Israel Museum in Jerusalem as the Anne and Jerome Fisher Director. Bruno served as a professor in the Industrial Design Department of the Bezalel Academy of Arts &amp; Design, Jerusalem. He brings to the position decades of experience as a curator and designer of exhibitions presented in Israel and across the world with a focus on art, archeology, science, and history. He was unanimously elected by the museum&#x27;s board of directors, chaired by Isaac Molho, following an extensive search and review process of candidates from Israel and abroad. Bruno assumed his position at the museum in November 2017.

Denis Weil, formerly Dean of the Institute of Design at the Illinois Institute of Technology, became Museum Director in March 2020.
From 1965, the museum was housed in a series of masonry buildings designed by the Russian-born Israeli architect Alfred Mansfeld. A $100-million campaign to renovate the museum and double its gallery space was completed by Israeli architects Efrat-Kowalsky Architects who renovated the existing buildings in July 2010. The wings for archaeology, the fine arts, and Jewish art and life were completely rebuilt and the original buildings were linked through a new entrance pavilion. The passageways that connect between the buildings and five new pavilions were designed by James Carpenter.

==Archaeology Wing==
The Samuel and Saidye Bronfman Archaeology Wing tells the story of the ancient Land of Israel, home to peoples of different cultures and faiths, using unique examples from the museum&#x27;s collection of Holy Land archaeology, the foremost holding in the world. Organized chronologically, from prehistory through the Ottoman Empire, the transformed wing presents seven &quot;chapters&quot; of this archaeological narrative, weaving together momentous historical events, cultural achievements, and technological advances, while providing a glimpse into the everyday lives of the peoples of the region. This narrative is supplemented by thematic groupings highlighting aspects of ancient Israeli archaeology that are unique to the region&#x27;s history, among them Hebrew writing, glass, and coins. Treasures from neighboring cultures that have had a decisive impact on the Land of Israel – such as Egypt, the Near East, Greece and Italy, and the Islamic world – are on view in adjacent and connecting galleries. A special gallery at the entrance to the wing showcases new findings and other temporary exhibition displays.


Highlights on view include Pilate Stone, &quot;House of David&quot; inscription (9th century BCE), a comparative display of two shrines (8th–7th century BCE); the Heliodorus Stele (178 BCE), royal Herodian bathhouse (1st century BCE); Hadrian&#x27;s Triumph: inscription from a triumphal arch (136 CE), the Mosaic of Rehob (3rd century CE) and gold-glass bases from the Roman catacombs (4th century CE); and the Ossuary of Jesus son of Joseph.

==Shrine of the Book==
The Shrine of the Book houses the Dead Sea Scrolls, the oldest biblical manuscripts in the world, as well as rare early medieval biblical manuscripts. The scrolls were discovered in 1947–56 in 11 caves in and around the site of Qumran. An elaborate planning process of seven years led to the building&#x27;s eventual construction in 1965. This was funded by the family of David Samuel Gottesman, a Hungarian émigré, the philanthropist who had purchased the scrolls as a gift to the State of Israel.

The building consists of a white dome over a building located two-thirds below the ground. The dome is reflected in a pool of water that surrounds it. Across from the white dome is a black basalt wall. The colors and shapes of the building are based on the imagery of the scroll of the &quot;War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness&quot;; the white dome symbolizes the Sons of Light and the black wall symbolizes the Sons of Darkness. The interior of the shrine was designed to depict the environment in which the scrolls were found. There is also a permanent display on life in the Qumran, where the scrolls were written. The entire structure was designed to resemble a pot in which the scrolls were found. The shrine was designed by Armand Bartos and Frederick Kiesler, and was opened in 1965.

As the fragility of the scrolls makes it impossible to display them all on a continuous basis, a system of rotation is used. After a scroll has been exhibited for 3–6 months, it is removed from its showcase and placed temporarily in a special storeroom, where it &quot;rests&quot; from exposure. The museum also holds other rare ancient manuscripts and displays the Aleppo Codex, which is from the 10th-century and is believed to be the oldest Bible codex in Hebrew.

==Second Temple model==


Adjacent to the Shrine of the Book is the Model of Jerusalem in the Second Temple Period, which reconstructs the topography and architectural character of the city as it was prior to its destruction by the Romans in 70 CE and provides historical context to the Shrine&#x27;s presentation of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Originally constructed on the grounds of Jerusalem&#x27;s Holyland Hotel, the model, which includes a replica of Herod&#x27;s Temple, is now a permanent feature of the museum&#x27;s campus.

==Fine Arts Wing==
The Edmond and Lily Safra Fine Arts Wing reflects the wide-ranging, interdisciplinary nature of the museum&#x27;s collections, encompassing works of art from across the ages in Western and non-Western cultures. The wing has been reorganized to highlight connections among works from its diverse curatorial collections, which include European Art, Modern Art, Contemporary Art, Israeli Art, the Arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas, Asian Art, Photography, Design and Architecture and Prints and Drawings. Installations are organized to underscore visual affinities and shared themes and to inspire new insight into the arts of different times and places, as well as an appreciation of the common threads of human culture. The reconfigured wing includes the museum&#x27;s first permanent galleries for Israeli art, more than doubled gallery space for the museum&#x27;s extensive collections in modern art, providing meaningful connecting points between Western and non-Western holdings, and a full 2,200-square-meter (7,200-square-foot) gallery floor devoted to changing displays from the museum&#x27;s collection of contemporary art.

Highlights newly on view include The Noel and Harriette Levine Photography Collection, The Jacques Lipchitz Collection, Gustave Courbet, &quot;Jura Landscape with Shepherd and Donkey&quot; (c. 1866), Alberto Giacometti, Alfred Barye, &quot;Diego in the Studio&quot; (1952), Ohad Meromi, and &quot;The Boy from South Tel Aviv&quot; (2001).

=== European, Modern, and Israeli art ===
The Israel Museum holds a large collection of paintings representing a wide range of periods, styles, subjects, and regions of origin. Painters in the collection include such international figures as Rembrandt and Camille Pissarro as well as such Israeli and Jewish artists as Marc Chagall, Abel Pann, and Reuven Rubin.

The Israel Museum&#x27;s commitment to Israeli art is central to its mission. As the country&#x27;s national museum, it plays a major role in preserving Israel&#x27;s artistic heritage by collecting works by Israeli artists - in Israel and abroad – and by encouraging Israel&#x27;s artists to develop in their careers. The museum&#x27;s Israeli Art collection spans the late 19th century through today, and it reflects the evolution of Israel&#x27;s cultural history in the visual arts. The Information Center for Israeli Art provides scholars and the public with comprehensive archival information on several thousand Israeli artists, including biographical notes, press materials, videos, photographs, and other forms of documentation.

==Mandel Wing for Jewish Art and Life==
The holdings of the Jack, Joseph, and Morton Mandel Wing for Jewish Art and Life represent the religious and secular material culture of Jewish communities worldwide, spanning centuries from the Middle Ages to the present day. The collection reflects the depth and beauty of Jewish heritage and creativity as well as the aesthetic and stylistic influences of other cultures in places where Jews lived.

The origins of the collection can be traced to the early twentieth century with the establishment of the Bezalel National Museum under the directorship of Mordechai Narkiss, who expanded significantly the collection of ritual art objects through important treasures rescued between the two world wars and after the Holocaust. Later on, this treasure was integrated in the newly established Israel Museum in 1965 into the departments of Jewish Art and of Jewish Ethnography. In 1995 they were united into a new independent wing. Over the years, the wing&#x27;s holdings have been strengthened through gifts and acquisitions of individual objects, gifts of private collections, and fieldwork within communities in Israel and abroad. The wing&#x27;s prominent collections are the Stieglitz Collection and the Feuchtwanger Collection for Jewish ritual objects, Torah scroll ornaments, and life cycle objects, as well as the Schulmann Collection and Rathjens Collection for North African and Yemenite material culture, dress, jewelry and ritual objects.

The wing&#x27;s collection contains many unique treasures, among them, are rare manuscripts, four reconstructed synagogue interiors, a wide variety of ceremonial and ritual objects, as well as diverse material culture including dress, jewelry, and everyday artifacts.

In the new permanent display, important objects drawn from this extensive collection from the public and the private realm, are integrated into a multifaceted narrative. This comparative display explores the objects&#x27; history and the social context in which they were used while underscoring their aesthetic qualities and emotional resonance. It reflects a vivid cultural tapestry weaving together the individual and the communal, the sacred and the mundane, the heritage of the past and the creative innovations of the present.

Five principal themes unfold as you walk through the galleries:
*The Rhythm of Life: Birth, Marriage, Death – highlighting the coexistence of joy and sadness, life, and death, memory and hope at each of these junctures in the life cycle.
*Illuminating the Script – a display from our collection of rare medieval and Renaissance Hebrew manuscripts, shedding light on their history and revealing their artistry.
*The Synagogue Route: Holiness and Beauty – Four restored interiors of synagogues from Europe, Asia, and the Americas, along with Torah scroll ornaments, show the unity and diversity of Jewish religious architecture and ritual objects.
*The Cycle of the Jewish Year – The sanctity of the Sabbath and the traditional celebration of religious holidays, as well as the new commemoration of special days in the State of Israel, have given rise to a wealth of finely crafted objects and imaginative artworks.
*Costume and Jewelry: A Matter of Identity- Environment, custom, and religious law all play their role in creating the rich variety of Jewish dress and jewelry from East and West presented here.

===Isidore and Anne Falk Information Center for Jewish Art and Life===
The Information Center has a research library and a unique archival collection, constantly growing, of some twenty thousand photographs. Many of them are extremely rare, documenting the daily life of Jewish communities around the world, some no longer exist, including images of synagogues, cemeteries, ceremonial objects and many other subjects.

The information center offers access to resources of the collections as well as virtual tours in former exhibitions in order to broaden and deepen knowledge behind the objects in the wing&#x27;s collections.

==Art Garden==

The Billy Rose Art Garden is a 20-dunam garden featuring modern and abstract sculptures. The garden, designed for the original campus by Japanese American sculptor Isamu Noguchi, is counted among the finest outdoor sculpture settings of the 20th century. An Oriental landscape combined with an ancient Jerusalem hillside; the garden serves as the backdrop for the Israel Museum&#x27;s display of the evolution of the modern western sculptural tradition. On view are works by modern masters including Jacques Lipchitz, Henry Moore, Claes Oldenburg, Pablo Picasso, Auguste Rodin, and David Smith, together with more recent site-specific commissions by such artists as Magdalena Abakanowicz, Mark Dion, James Turrell, and Micha Ullman.

==Youth Wing==
The Ruth Youth Wing for Art Education was opened in 1966. It is unique in its size and scope of activities, presents a wide range of programming to more than 100,000 schoolchildren each year, and features exhibition galleries, art studios, classrooms, a library of illustrated children&#x27;s books, and a recycling room. Special programs foster intercultural understanding between Arab and Jewish students and reach out to the wide spectrum of Israel&#x27;s communities. The wing combines annual original artworks of Israeli and international artists, with educational activities. There are also a variety of workshops for children and adults.

==Rockefeller Archaeological Museum and the Ticho House==
In addition to the extensive programming offered on its main campus, the Israel Museum also operates two off-site locations: the Rockefeller Archaeological Museum that opened in 1938 for the display of artifacts unearthed mainly in the excavations conducted in Mandatory Palestine, in the 1920s and 1930s; and Ticho House, which offers an ongoing program of exhibitions by younger Israeli artists in a historic house and garden setting.

==Management==

===Funding===
The Israel Museum receives only 10% to 12% of its operating budget from state and municipal sources. The Israeli government provides varying amounts of funds each year. The institution must raise 88% of its yearly operating budget, all of its $200 million endowment and $100 million for its recent capital project, while paying 17.5% VAT as well as real-estate taxes on the campus property.

The most active of the international support groups of the museum, the American Friends of the Israel Museum, raised $270 million in cash, of which $47 million is in endowment funds, and donated $210 million in the art from 1972 to 2008. In 2009, the Israel Museum received $12 million from the Edmond J. Safra Philanthropic Foundation, towards the renovation, reinstallation, and endowment of its fine arts wing, which will be renamed after Edmond and Lily Safra.

===Attendance===
As of 2012, attendance was about 827,000 per year.

==Prizes awarded by the museum==
Among the prizes awarded by the museum is the Jesselson Prize for Contemporary Judaica Design, which recognizes outstanding design of Jewish ritual objects. Winners include Moshe Zabari (1990).

==Incidents==
On 5 October 2023, a 40-year-old Jewish-American tourist was arrested at the museum after hurling a marble head of the Greek goddess Athena and a statue of a griffin grasping the wheel of fate of the Roman god Nemesis into the floor, shattering the latter artefact. Police described him as a radical who considered the artefacts “to be idolatrous and contrary to the Torah”, while his lawyer claimed he was suffering from Jerusalem syndrome. The damaged artefacts, both of which dated from the Second Century CE, were placed under restoration.

<text> (; plural: ) is the Polish word for sabre.

The sabre was in widespread use in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth during the Early Modern period, especially by light cavalry in the 17th century. The sabre became widespread in Europe following the Thirty Years&#x27; War and was also adopted by infantry. In particular, it served as one of the symbols of the nobility and aristocracy (), who considered it to be one of the most important pieces of men&#x27;s traditional attire.

== Types ==
=== Hungarian-Polish szabla ===

The first type of szabla, the Hungarian-Polish (&quot;węgiersko-polska&quot;), was popularized among the szlachta during the reign of the Transylvanian-Hungarian King of Poland Stefan Batory in the late 16th century. It featured a large, open hilt with a cross-shaped guard formed from quillons and upper and lower langets and a heavy blade. The single edged blade was either straight or only slightly curved. Since the saber provided little to no hand protection, a chain was attached from the cross-guard to the pommel. Since a number of such weapons were made by order of the king himself during his reform of the army and were engraved with his portrait, this kind of sabre is also referred to as &quot;batorówka&quot; – after Batory&#x27;s name.

=== Armenian szabla ===

In the late 17th century, the first notable modification of the sabre appeared. Unlike the early &quot;Hungarian-Polish&quot; type, it featured a protected hilt and resembled the curved sabres of the East. It was hence called the Armenian sabre, possibly after Armenian merchants and master swordsmiths who formed a large part of arms makers of the Commonwealth at those times. In fact, the &quot;Armenian&quot; sabre developed into three almost completely distinct types of swords, each used for a different purpose. Their popularity and efficiency made the Polish nobles abandon the broadswords commonly used in Western Europe.

*Czeczuga was a curved sabre with a small cross-guard with an ornamented open hilt and a hood offering partial protection to the hand.
* Ordynka was a heavier weapon used by the cavalry. It resembled a mixture of all the features of the Czeczuga with a heavier and more durable hilt and blade of the short sword.
* Armenian karabela was the first example of a ceremonial sword used by the szlachta. It had both its blade and cross-guard curved, and had a short grip. It was engraved and decorated with precious stones and ivory. Used throughout the ages, in the 18th century it evolved into a standard karabela, used both as a part of attire and in combat.

=== Hussar szabla ===

The &quot;hussar&quot; sabre was the best-known type of szabla of its time, and was a precursor to many similar types of European swords. Introduced around 1630, it served as a Polish cavalry melee weapon, mostly used by heavy cavalry, or Polish Hussars. Much less curved than its Armenian predecessors, it was ideal for horseback fighting and allowed for much faster and stronger strikes. The heavier, almost fully closed hilt offered both good protection of the hand and much better control over the sabre during a skirmish. Two feather-shaped pieces of metal on both sides of the blade called moustache (&quot;wąsy&quot;) offered greater durability of the weapon by strengthening its weakest point: the joint between the blade and the hilt. The soldier fighting with such sabre could use it with his thumb extended along the back-strap of the grip for even greater control when &#x27;fencing&#x27; either on foot or with other experienced horsemen or, by using the thumb-ring, a small ring of steel or brass at the junction of the grip and the cross-guard through which the thumb is placed, could give forceful downward swinging cuts from the shoulder and elbow with a &#x27;locked&#x27; wrist against infantry and less experienced horsemen. This thumb ring also facilitated faster &#x27;recovery&#x27; of the weapon for the next cut. A typical hussar szabla was relatively long, with the average blade of in total. The tip of the blade, was usually long and in most cases was double-edged. Such sabres were extremely durable yet stable and were used in combat well into the 19th century.

The Polish and Hungarian szabla&#x27;s design influenced a number of other designs in other parts of Europe and led to the introduction of the sabre in Western Europe. An example that bears a considerable resemblance is the famous British 1796 pattern Light Cavalry Sabre, which was designed by Captain John Gaspard le Marchant after several visits to Central and Eastern Europe and research being conducted into those and other nations&#x27; cavalry tactics and weapons. Poland had ceased to exist as a separate nation, but Hungary was still an existing nation and was the source of all things &quot;Hussar&quot;, it was the Polish-Hungarian szable of 150 years earlier, rather than the oftened-quoted Indian tulwar, that was the main source of inspiration for the first &quot;mainly cutting&quot; sabre in the British Army. The same &quot;1796&quot; sabre was taken up by the King&#x27;s Hanoverian troops and also by the Prussians under General Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher, who attempted to give his name to the weapon, which is almost universally known as &quot;the 1796 Light Cavalry Sabre&quot; in the rest of Europe. This weapon also found its way into the cavalry of the newly-formed United States during the War of 1812.

=== Karabela szabla ===

The karabela entered service around 1670. 
A karabela was a type of &quot;szabla&quot; popular in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 1670s.

The word &quot;karabela&quot; does not have a well-established etymology, and different theories have been put forward. For example, Zygmunt Gloger suggests derivation from the name of the Iraqi city of Karbala, known for trade of this kind of sabre.

=== Other types ===

* &quot;Kosciuszkowska&quot;, a variant popularized during the Kościuszko Uprising;
* &quot;Szabla wz.34&quot; (&quot;pattern 34 szabla&quot;), a 20th-century variant produced from 1934 in the Second Polish Republic for Polish cavalry; just about 40,000 were made.

== Technique ==
=== Stance ===
There are many stances for the Szabla, such as Back-Weighted, Toes Forward, Even-Weighted, and Forward-Weighted.

Back-Weighted is a stance in which the back leg is bent, and put the weight onto. While the front leg is free to move with little weight in the case of an attack by the opponent.

Toes Forward is a stance in which weight is evenly distributed between each leg. The balls of the feet are planted on the ground while the toes are raised.

Even-Weighted is a stance in between Forward-weighted and Back-weighted.

Forward-Weighted is a stance in which most of the weight is on the front leg, allowing the back leg to move freely. This allows the person to lean into or away from the attacker.

=== Footwear ===
Proper footwear was also very important when it comes to stance. There are two main types of footwear used in Poland at the time, Polish Hussar Boots and Turkish footwear.

Polish Hussar Boots were used in the 17th century. They came in mostly yellow, gold, or maize coloring. They had a high heel and also allows for the ball of the foot to rest naturally on the ground.
Despite the name, Turkish footwear, was common in 17th century Poland. Like the Polish Hussar Boots, these boots had a high heel for attaching spurs, as well as allowing the ball of the foot to rest on the ground.

<text>The Shrine of the Book (, &quot;Heikhal HaSefer&quot;) is a wing of the Israel Museum in the Givat Ram neighborhood of Jerusalem that houses the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Aleppo Codex, among others.

==History==
The building was constructed in 1965, funded by the family of David Samuel Gottesman, a Hungarian-Jewish philanthropist. The building was designed by Armand Phillip Bartos, Frederick John Kiesler and Gezer Heller over a period of seven years.

The shrine is built as a white dome, covering a structure placed two-thirds below the ground, that is reflected in a pool of water that surrounds it. Across from the white dome is a black basalt wall. According to one interpretation, the colors and shapes of the building are based on the imagery of the Scroll of the War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness; the white dome symbolizes the Sons of Light and the black wall symbolizes the Sons of Darkness.

As the fragility of the scrolls makes it impossible to display all on a continuous basis, a system of rotation is used. After a scroll has been exhibited for 3–6 months, it is removed from its showcase and placed temporarily in a special storeroom, where it &quot;rests&quot; from exposure.

The shrine houses the Isaiah scroll, dating from the second century BCE, the most intact of the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the Aleppo Codex, dating from the 10th century CE, the oldest existing Hebrew Bible. A facsimile of the original Isaiah scroll is now on display in the Shrine of the Book.

In 2013, the Bank of Israel released an Israeli bullion coin dedicated to the Shrine of the Book.

<doc id="1340551" wikidata="Q143720" url="?curid=1340551" title="Crown (dental restoration)">
<text>In dentistry, a crown or a dental cap is a type of dental restoration that completely caps or encircles a tooth or dental implant. A crown may be needed when a large dental cavity threatens the health of a tooth. Some dentists will also finish root canal treatment by covering the exposed tooth with a crown. A crown is typically bonded to the tooth by dental cement. They can be made from various materials, which are usually fabricated using &quot;indirect methods&quot;. Crowns are used to improve the strength or appearance of teeth and to halt deterioration. While beneficial to dental health, the procedure and materials can be costly.

The most common method of crowning a tooth involves taking a dental impression of a tooth prepared by a dentist, then fabricating the crown outside of the mouth. The crown can then be inserted at a subsequent dental appointment. This &quot;indirect method&quot; of tooth restoration allows use of strong restorative material requiring time-consuming fabrication under intense heat, such as casting metal or firing porcelain, that would not be possible inside the mouth. Because of its compatible thermal expansion, relatively similar cost, and cosmetic difference, some patients choose to have their crown fabricated with gold.

Computer technology is increasingly employed for crown fabrication in CAD/CAM dentistry.

== Indications for dental crowns ==

Crowns are indicated to:
* Replace existing crowns which have failed.
* Restore the form, function and appearance of badly broken down, worn or fractured teeth, where other simpler forms of restorations are unsuitable or have been found to fail clinically.
* Improve the aesthetics of unsightly teeth which cannot be managed by simpler cosmetic and restorative procedures.
* Maintain the structural stability and reduce the risk of fractures of extensively restored teeth including those which have been endodontically treated.
* Restore the visible portion of a single dental implant.

=== Restoration of endodontically treated teeth ===

Traditionally, it has been proposed that teeth which have undergone root canal treatment are more likely to fracture and therefore require cuspal protection by providing occlusal coverage with an indirect restoration like crowns. This led to routine prescribing of crowns for root-treated teeth. However, recent review of literature reveals that there is no strong evidence to show that crowns are better than other routine restorations to restore root-filled teeth. The general advice is that dentists should use their clinical experience in view of the patient&#x27;s preferences when making the decision of using a crown. As a rule of thumb, the use of crowns and other indirect restorations for root treated teeth is justified when the surface area of the access cavity exceeds one third of the occlusal surface of the tooth, when the lingual or buccal walls are undermined or when the mesial and distal marginal ridges are missing.

== Clinical stages of dental crown provision ==

# Assessment
# Choice of restoration
# Tooth preparation
# Construction and fit of temporary restoration
# Tooth preparation impressions
# Fit of definitive restoration
# Short-term follow up
# Long-term follow up

== Assessment ==
In order to ensure optimum condition and longevity for the proposed crowns, several factors need to be explored by conducting a thorough and targeted patient history and clinical dental examination. These factors include:
* Patient factors
** Patient expectations
** Patient motivation to adhere to the treatment plan and maintain results
** Financial and time costs to the patient
* Biological factors
** Periodontal health status and periodontal disease risk
** Pulpal health and endodontic disease risk
** Caries and caries risk
** Occlusion and occlusal problems risk
* Mechanical factors
** Amount of remaining tooth structure
** Height and width of tooth to be prepared
** Attachment levels of the tooth to be prepared
** Root shape and length of the tooth to be prepared
* Aesthetic factors

== Choice of restoration ==

The choice(s) of crown restoration can be described by:
* The dimensions and percentage coverage of the natural crown
** Full crowns
** 3/4 and 7/8 crowns
* Material to be used
** Metal
** Metal-ceramic crowns
** Full ceramic crowns

=== 3/4 and 7/8 crowns ===
These restorations are a hybrid between an onlay and a full crown. They are named based on the estimated wall coverage of the walls of the tooth; e.g. the 3/4 crown aims to cover three out of the four walls, with the buccal wall being usually spared, thus reducing sound tooth tissue to be prepared. They are normally fabricated in gold. Grooves or boxes are normally added to the preparations as close to the unprepared wall as possible to increase retention of the crown. Despite its advantages of reducing sound tooth preparation, these crowns are not commonly prescribed in practice because they are technically difficult and have poor patient acceptability due to the metal showing through in their smile.

=== Full metal crowns ===
As the name suggests, these crowns are entirely cast in a metal alloy. There are a multitude of alloys available and the selection of a particular alloy over another depends on several factors including cost, handling, physical properties, biocompatibility. The American Dental Association categories alloys in three groups: high-noble, noble and base metal alloys.

====High-noble and noble alloys====
Noble and high-noble alloys used in casting crowns are generally based on alloys of gold. Gold is not used in its pure form as it is too soft and has poor mechanical strength. Other metals included in gold alloys are copper, platinum, palladium, zinc, indium and nickel. All types of gold casting alloys used in prosthodontics (Type I - IV) are categorised by their percentage content of gold and hardness, with Type I being the softest and Type IV the hardest. Generally, Type III and IV alloys (62 - 78% and 60 - 70% gold content respectively) are used in casting of full crowns, as these are hard enough to withstand occlusal forces. Gold crowns (also known as &quot;gold shell crowns&quot;) are generally indicated for posterior teeth due to aesthetic reasons. They are durable in function and strong in thin sections, therefore require minimal tooth preparation. They also have similar wear properties to enamel, so they are not likely to cause excessive wear to the opposing tooth. They have good dimensional accuracy when cast which minimises chair-side/appointment time and can be relatively easy to polish if any changes are required. Palladium based alloys are also used. These were introduced as a cheaper alternative to gold alloys in the 1970s. Palladium has a strong whitening effect giving most of its alloys a silverish appearance.

====Base-metal alloys====
Cast base-metal alloys are rarely used to make full metal crowns. They are more commonly used as part of metal-ceramic crowns as bonding alloys. When compared to high-noble and noble alloys, they are stronger and harder; they can be used in thinner sections (0.3mm as opposed to 0.5mm) however they are harder to adjust and are more likely to cause excessive wear on real opposing teeth. Furthermore, there may be problems with people who have a nickel allergy.

Common base-metal alloys used in dentistry are:
* Silver-palladium
* Silver-palladium-copper
* Nickel-chromium
* Nickel-chromium-beryllium
* Cobalt-chromium
* Titanium

====Titanium====
Titanium and titanium alloys are highly biocompatible. Its strength, rigidity and ductility are similar to that of other casting alloys used in dentistry. Titanium also readily forms an oxide layer on its surface which gives it anti-corrosive properties and allows it to bond to ceramics, a useful property in the manufacture of metal-ceramic crowns.

=== Full ceramic crowns ===
Dental ceramics or porcelains are used for crowns manufacture primarily for their aesthetic properties compared to all metal restorations. These materials are generally quite brittle and prone to fracture. Many classifications have been used to categorise dental ceramics, with the simplest, based on the material from which they are made, i.e. silica, alumina or zirconia.

====Silica====

Silica-based ceramics are highly aesthetic due to their high glass content and excellent optical properties due to the addition of filler particles which enhance opalescence, fluorescence which can mimic the colour of natural enamel and dentine. These ceramics, however, suffer from poor mechanical strength, and therefore often used for veneering stronger substructures.

Examples include aluminosilicate glass, e.g. feldspathic, synthetic porcelain, and leucite reinforced ceramics.

Mechanical properties can be improved by the addition of filler particles, e.g. lithium disilicate, and are therefore termed glass ceramics. Glass-ceramics can be used alone to make all-ceramic restorations either as a single form (termed uni-layered) or can act as a substructures for subsequent veneering (or layering) with weaker feldspathic porcelain (restorations termed bi-layered).

====Alumina====
Alumina (aluminium oxide) was introduced as a dental substructure (core) in 1989 when the material was slip cast, sintered, and infiltrated with glass. More recently, glass-infiltrated alumina cores are produced by electrophoretic deposition, a rapid nanofabrication process. During this process, particles of a slip are brought to the surface of a dental die by an electric current, thereby forming a precision-fitting core greenbody in seconds. Margins are then trimmed and the greenbody is sintered and infiltrated with glass. Glass-infiltrated alumina has significantly higher porcelain bond strength over CAD/CAM produced zirconia and alumina cores without glass.

Alumina cores without glass are produced by milling pre-sintered blocks of the material utilizing a CAD/CAM dentistry technique. Cores without glass must be oversized to compensate for shrinkage that occurs when the core is fully sintered. Milled cores are then sintered and shrink to the correct size.

All alumina cores are layered with tooth tissue-like feldspathic porcelain to make true-to-life color and shape. Dental artists called ceramists, can customize the &quot;look&quot; of these crowns to individual patient and dentist requirements. Alumina cores have better translucency than zirconia, but worse than lithium disilicate.

====Zirconia====

Yttria-stabilized zirconia, also known simply as zirconia, is a very hard ceramic that is used as a strong base material in some full ceramic restorations. Zirconia is relatively new in dentistry and the published clinical data is correspondingly limited. The zirconia used in dentistry is zirconium oxide (ZrO2) which has been stabilized with the addition of yttrium oxide. Yttria-stabilized zirconia is also known as YSZ.
The zirconia substructure (core) is usually designed on a digital representation of the patient&#x27;s mouth, which is captured with a three-dimensional digital scan of the patient, impression, or model. The core is then milled from a block of zirconia in a soft pre-sintered state. Once milled, the zirconia is sintered in a furnace where it shrinks by 20% and reaches its full strength of 850–1000 MPa. Recently, the strength of zirconia for dental restorations reaching 1200 MPa is reported. The zirconia core structure can be layered with tooth tissue-like feldspathic porcelain to create the final color and shape of the tooth. Because bond strength of layered porcelain fused to zirconia is not strong; chipping of the conventional veneering ceramic frequently occurs, crowns and bridges are nowadays increasingly made with monolithic zirconia crowns produced from a color and structure graded zirconia block, and coated with a thin layer of glaze stains. Esthetic prosthetic restorations, with natural reflection, color from within and color gradients influenced by the internal dentinal core anatomy can best be accomplished by veneered zirconia, rather than with crowns of monolithic zirconia. In the production of dental restorations specifically made for one patient, dental technicians with their problem-solving skills, dexterity and cognitive skills are until recently the only way to provide the required esthetics, individuality and artistry with porcelain. Fear for chipping of conventional mono glass component zirconia porcelains on the longer term and price pressure on manual application of porcelain, are possible drivers for the monolithic zirconia restorations. However, by the application of multi-glass component porcelain chipping is no longer an issue, especially with prosthetic mimetic restorations where the crown follows a model of the natural tooth in two layers: a histo-anatomic dentin layer mimicking the dentin shape of the dentition of the patient and an enamel layer. These restorations that mimic the structure of natural teeth by cognitive design of the dentin core present a new production paradigm to fabricate natural restorations of veneered zirconia using a high strength porcelain with CAD/CAM. These crowns are produced with a core of tooth-colored tetragonal zirconia, on which a high strength translucent porcelain layer has been applied and subsequently milled to size. In the subtle cooperation between the dentin-colored zirconia and the veneering porcelain, the zirconia shines through the translucent porcelain layer, all the more as the porcelain layer is thinner. This creates the natural color dynamics with color &quot;from the inside&quot; as found in natural elements, instead of color &quot;on the outside&quot;, with monolithic zirconia. As a result, the natural tooth, in terms of esthetics and hardness, is approached closer than crowns made from solid monolithic zirconia. This implies that the histo-anatomic dentin core is the key to esthetic crowns.

Zirconia is the hardest known ceramic in industry and the strongest material used in dentistry, it has to be fabricated using a CAD/CAM process but not the conventional manual dental technology. Because of this monolithic zirconia does not wear itself as the normal vertical wear of 25-75 microns of natural enamel and porcelain, there are no clinical data on the fact whether as a consequence too high zirconia crowns will damage opposing dentition on the longer term. Although in two body wear testing of monolithic, veneered and glazed zirconia and their corresponding enamel antagonists showed similar wear, at least twice as much extensive, and branched enamel microcracks were observed in the samples opposing monolithic zirconia.

====Monolithic zirconia====

Monolithic zirconia crowns tend to be opaque in appearance with a high value and they lack translucency and fluorescence. For the sake of appearance, many dentists will not use monolithic crowns on anterior (front) teeth. Monolithic zirconia crowns are produced from a color- and structure-graded zirconia block and coated with a thin layer of glaze stains which also provides some kind of fluorescence. The &quot;graded&quot; zirconia crown has a darker cervical area consisting of tetragonal zirconia, a main tooth color in the buccal area, and a translucent incisal edge consisting of cubic zirconia. The only thing a dental technician has to do is to use the proper height of the zirconia block so that the crown fits in all the different color zones. Although on the outside the color gradient mimics natural teeth, they are still far from the optical, physical, biomimetic and esthetic properties of natural teeth.

To a large extent, materials selection in dentistry determine the strength and appearance of a crown. Some monolithic zirconia materials produce the strongest crowns in dentistry (the registered strength for some zirconia crown materials is near 1200 MPa), but these crowns are not usually considered to be natural enough for use in the front of the mouth. Although not as strong, some of the newer zirconia materials are better in appearance but generally still not as good as porcelain-fused crowns. By contrast, when porcelain is fused to glass-infiltrated alumina, crowns are very natural-looking and very strong, though not as strong as monolithic zirconia crowns.

Zirconia crowns are said to be less abrasive to opposing teeth than metal-ceramic crowns.

Other crown material properties to be considered are thermal conductivity and radiolucency. Stability/looseness of fit on the prepared tooth and cement gap at the margin are sometimes related to materials selection, though these crown properties are also commonly related to system and fabricating procedures.

====Lithium-disilicate====
Another monolithic material, lithium disilicate, produces extremely translucent leucite-reinforced crowns that often appear to be too gray in the mouth. To overcome this, the light shade polyvalent colorants take on a distinctly unnatural, bright white appearance.

However, research has shown that the shade of the supporting tooth or abutment significantly influences the final appearance of lithium disilicate crowns. Discolored foundations can adversely affect the esthetics of the restoration. Utilizing opaque ceramic cores or liners has been suggested to mitigate this issue, improving the color match and overall appearance. 

=== Metal-ceramic crowns (P-F-M Crown)===
These are a hybrid of metal and ceramic crowns. The metal part is normally made of a base metal alloy (termed bonding alloy). The properties of the metal alloy chosen should match and complement that of the ceramic to be bonded otherwise problems like delamination or fracturing of the ceramic can occur. To obtain an aesthetic finish which is able to be functional with normal mastication activity, a minimal thickness of ceramic and metallic material is required, which should be planned for during tooth preparation stage.

Ceramic bonds to the metal framework by three methods:

* Compression fit (via ceramic shrinkage on firing)
* Micro-mechanical retention (via surface irregularities)
* Chemical union (via oxide formation)

== Tissue control and gingival retraction ==
Gingival retraction refers to the displacement of the free gingivae. For crowns with margins which are supragingival, there is no need for gingival retraction, provided there is good moisture control.

For crown preparations which have subgingival margins, tissue control is necessary at the preparation stage and impression stage to ensure visibility, good moisture control and ensure enough bulk of impression material can be placed to accurately record the marginal areas.

Options available are gingival retraction cord, Magic Foam cord, and ExpaSyl.

Another method to expose the margins of a subgingival preparation is to use electrosurgery or crown lengthening surgery.

== Tooth preparation ==
The design of a preparation for a tooth to accept a crown follows five basic principles:

# Retention and resistance
# Preservation of tooth structure
# Structural durability
# Marginal integrity
# Preservation of the periodontium

Aesthetics can also play a role in planning the design.

=== Retention and resistance ===
As there are currently no biologically compatible cements which are able to hold the crown in place solely through their adhesive properties, the geometric form of the preparation is vital in providing retention and resistance to hold the crown in place. Within the context of prosthodontics, &quot;retention&quot; refers to resistance of movement of a restoration along the path of insertion or along the long axis of the tooth. &quot;Resistance&quot; refers to the resistance of movement of the crown by forces applied apically or in an oblique direction which prevents movement under occlusal forces. Retention is determined by the relationship between opposing surfaces of the preparation (e.g. the relationship of the buccal and lingual walls).

====Taper====
Theoretically, the more parallel the opposing walls of a preparation, the more retention is achieved. However this is almost impossible to achieve clinically. It is standard for preparations for full coverage crowns to slightly taper or converge in an occlusal direction. This allows the preparation to be visually inspected, prevent undercuts, compensate for crown fabrication inaccuracies and allow, at the cementation stage, for excess cement to escape with the ultimate aim of optimising the seating of the crown on the preparation. Generally axial walls prepared using a long tapered high speed burs confer a 2 - 3° taper on each wall and an overall 4 - 6° taper to the preparation. As taper increases, retention decreases so taper should be kept to a minimum whilst ensuring elimination of undercuts. An overall taper of 16° is said to be clinically achievable and being able to fulfil the aforesaid requirements. Ideally, the taper should not exceed 20 degrees as will negatively impact retention.

====Length====
Occluso-gingival length or height of the crown preparation affects both resistance and retention. Generally, the taller the preparation, the greater the surface area is. For the crown to be retentive enough, the length of the preparation must be greater than the height formed by the arc of the cast pivoting around a point on the margin on the opposite side of the restoration. The arc is affected by the diameter of the tooth prepared, therefore the smaller the diameter, the shorter the length of the crown needs to be to resist removal. Retention of short-walled teeth with a wide diameter can be improved by placing grooves in the axial walls, which has the effect of reducing the size of the arc.

====Freedom of displacement====
Retention can be improved by geometrically limiting the number of paths along which the crown can be removed from the tooth presentation, with maximum retention being reached when only one path of displacement is present. Resistance can be improved by inserting components like grooves.

=== Preservation of tooth structure ===

Preparing a tooth to accept a full coverage crown is relatively destructive. The procedure can damage the pulp irreversibly, through mechanical, thermal and chemical trauma and making the pulp more susceptible to bacterial invasion. Therefore, preparations must be as conservative as possible, whilst producing a strong retentive restoration. Although it may be seen as contradictory to the previous statement, at times, sound tooth structure may need to be sacrificed in order to prevent further more substantial and uncontrolled loss of tooth structure.

=== Structural durability ===
In order to last, the crown must be made of enough material to withstand normal masticatory function and should be contained within the space created by the tooth preparation, otherwise problems may arise with aesthetics and occlusal stability (i.e. high restorations) and cause periodontal inflammation. Depending on the material used to create the crown, minimal occlusal and axial reductions are required to house the crown.

====Occlusal reduction====

For gold alloys there should be 1.5mm clearance, whilst metal-ceramic crowns and full ceramic crowns require 2.0 mm. The occlusal clearance should follow the natural outline of the tooth; otherwise there may be areas of the restorations where the material may be too thin.

====Functional cusp bevel====

For posterior teeth, a wide bevel is required on the functional cusps, palatal cusps for maxillary teeth and buccal cusps for mandibular teeth. If this functional cusp bevel is not present and the crown is cast to replicate the correct size of the tooth, bulk of material may be too little at this point to withstand occlusal surfaces.

====Axial reduction====
This should allow enough thickness for the material chosen. Depending on the type of crown to be fitted, there is a minimum preparation thickness. Generally, full metal crowns require at least 0.5mm, whist metal-ceramic and full ceramic crowns require at least 1.2mm

=== Marginal integrity ===
In order for the cast restoration to last in the oral environment and to protect the underlying tooth structure, the margins between cast and tooth preparation need to be as closely adapted. The marginal line design and position should facilitate plaque control, allow for adequate thickness of the restorative material chosen therefore providing enough strength for the crown at the margin. Several types of finish line configurations have been advocated, each having some advantages and disadvantages (see the table below). Chamfer finish are normally advocated for full metal margins and shoulders are generally required to provide enough bulk for metal-ceramic crowns and full ceramic crown margins. Some evidence suggests adding a bevel to margins, especially where these are heavy, to decrease the distance between the crown and the tooth tissue.
=== Preservation of the periodontium ===

Linked to marginal integrity, placement of the finish line can directly affect the ease of manufacturing the crown and health of the periodontium. Best results are achieved where the finish line is above the gum line as this is fully cleanable. They should also be placed on enamel as this creates a better seal. Where circumstances require the margins to be below the gum line, caution is required as several problems can arise. First, there might be issues in terms of capturing the margin when making impressions during the manufacturing process leading to inaccuracies. Secondly, the biologic width, the mandatory distance (roughly 2 mm) to be left between the height of the alveolar bone and the margin of the restoration; if this distance is violated, it can result in gingival inflammation with pocket formation, gingival recession and loss of alveolar bone crest height. In these cases, crown lengthening surgery should be considered.
=== Special considerations ===

==== Ferrule effect ====
Endodontically treated teeth, especially those with little sound tooth tissue, are prone to fractures. The successful clinical outcome for these teeth relies not only on adequate root canal treatment, but also on the type of restorative treatment used, including the use of a post and core system and the type of extra-coronal restoration selected. Some evidence advocates the use of a ferrule to optimise the bio-mechanical behaviour of root-filled teeth, especially where a post and core system needs to be used.

In dentistry, the ferrule effect is, as defined by Sorensen and Engelman (1990), a &quot;360° metal collar of the crown surrounding the parallel walls of the dentine extending coronal to the shoulder of the preparation&quot;. Like the ferrule of a pencil which encircles the junction between the rubber and the pencil shaft, the ferrule effect is believed to minimise the concentration of stresses at the junction of post and core, ultimately providing a protective effect against fractures. It also reduces stress transmission to the root due to non-axial forces applied by the post during placement or during normal function. The ferrule can also help preserve the hermetic seal of the luting cement. It has been suggested that protection acquired by the use of a ferrule occurs due to the ferrule resisting functional lever forces, wedging effect of tapered posts and lateral forces during post insertion. To make full use of the ferrule effect, the preparation needs to allow for a continuous band of dentine which should be at least 2 mm in height from the level of the preparation margin and with the band being at least 1 mm in thickness.

It has been shown, however, that whilst the absence of a 360° ferrule can increase the risk of fracture of root-filled teeth restored with fiber post and cores and crowns, having insufficient coronal walls poses an even greater one.

==== Stainless steel crowns for posterior primary dentition ====
Stainless steel preformed metal crowns are the treatment of choice for the restoration of posterior primary teeth. A systemic review found that it has the highest success rate (96.1%). In order to accept a stainless steel crown, the entire occlusal surface should be reduced by 1–1.5 mm and interproximally contacts should be cleared by cutting a thin mesial and distal portion or &quot;slice&quot; subgingivally by holding the tip of a thin high-speed bur at 15–20° relative to the long axis of the tooth, to avoid the creation of a shoulder. No preparation of the buccal or lingual/palatal surfaces is required. Stainless steel crowns can be made esthetic by veneering composite using the open face technique or composite veneering done after sand-blasting SSCs. Also, composite veneering can be done after preparing retentive grooves on the buccal surface of stainless steel crowns.

==== Hall technique ====
The Hall technique is a non-invasive treatment for decayed posterior primary teeth where caries are sealed under a preformed stainless steel crown. This technique requires no tooth preparation.

== Construction and fit of temporary crown restorations ==

It is very likely that once a tooth has been prepared and whilst waiting for the definitive restoration, the tooth preparation is fitted with a temporary crown.

=== Need for temporary restorations ===
Temporisation is important after tooth preparation in order to:
* Protect from and prevent bacterial invasion of newly exposed dentinal tubules, leading to pulpal inflammation and necrosis;
* Prevent gingival growth in the area created by the tooth preparation;
* Allow area to be cleaned more effectively, decreasing the incidence of bleeding and gingival inflammation at the time of fitting definitive restoration;
* Maintain occlusal and approximal contacts therefore preventing over-eruption, rotation and closing of spaces;
* Aesthetic reasons;
Temporary crowns can also play a diagnostic role in treatment planning where there is a need for occlusal, aesthetic or periodontal changes.

=== Types of temporary crowns ===
Temporary crowns can be described by:
* The expected or planned &quot;duration&quot; of temporisation:
** Short term
** Medium term
** Long term
* The &quot;way&quot; or the &quot;place&quot; the temporary restoration is made:
** Direct or chair-side
** Indirect or laboratory-made
* The aesthetics or look of the &quot;material&quot; of construction
** Metal
*** Cast
*** Preformed
** Tooth coloured
*** Plastic pre-formed (e.g. polycarboxylate and acrylic)
*** Resin composites

====Duration of temporisation====
Temporary crowns can be described as &quot;short-term&quot;, if used for a few days, &quot;medium-term&quot;, if their planned use for several weeks and &quot;long-term&quot; if their planned use is for several months. The choice in length of temporisation often relates to the complexity of restorative work planned. Short-term temporary crowns are generally appropriate for simple restorative cases whilst complex cases involving more than one tooth often require long-term temporary crowns.

====Direct vs. indirect restorations====
Temporary crowns can either be &quot;direct&quot;, if constructed by the dentist in the clinic, or &quot;indirect&quot; if they are made off-site, usually in a dental laboratory. Generally direct temporary crowns tend to be for short-term use. Where medium-term or long-term temporisation is required, the use of indirect temporary crowns should be considered.

====Temporary crown materials====
There are several materials that can be used to construct temporary crowns. Direct temporary crowns are either made using metal or plastic pre-formed crowns, chemically cured or light-cured resins or resin composites. Indirect restorations are either made of chemically cured acrylic, heat-cured acrylic or cast in metal.
=== Cementation of temporary crowns ===
The purpose of temporary luting agents is to fill the space between the crown preparation and the temporary restoration. Unlike cementation of definitive crowns, temporary crowns should be relatively easy to remove. Adhesive cements should not be used and softer cements are preferred to allow for the easy removal of both temporary cements and crowns. This is crucial as remnants of temporary cement left on the tooth surface can compromise gingival health and interfere with accurate seating of the final restoration and permanent cement attachment. Provisional cements should also be strong enough to avoid being deformed or fractured during the provisional period.

Zinc Oxide Eugenol (ZOE) temporary luting cements

These are commonly used because of their low tensile strength and lack of adhesion which provides ease of removal. These products should not be used when resin composite is to be planned for bonding the definitive crown as eugenol is able to infiltrate and diffuse through dentine; contaminating tooth surface and compromising bonding by inhibiting polymerisation of resin. Commercially available products include RelyX Temp E (3M ESPE), Temp-Bond (Kerr) and Flow Temp (Premier Dental Products).

Non-eugenol temporary luting cements

Non-eugenol cements replace eugenol with several types of carboxylic acids which do not inhibit definitive cementation. These cements are compatible with temporary resin materials and definitive resin cements and have increased retention when compared to ZOE containing cements. Examples of commercially available products include RelyX Temp NE (3M ESPE) and Temp-Bond NE (Kerr).

Polycarboxylate temporary luting cements

This hydrophilic cement has the benefit of minimal effects on temporary resin containing agents and weak adhesion to tooth tissue which increases ease of removal. This cement is the easiest to clean out of all the provisional cement types. Examples include Ultradent and Hy-Bond (Shofu Dental).

Resin temporary luting cements

The advantages of these cements include superior aesthetics, greater strength, superb retention and ease of cleaning. However, amongst the drawbacks of this cement is the higher rate of discolouration, microleakage and odour experienced. Commercially available examples of temporary resins cements include Systemp.link (Ivoclar Vivadent), Temp-Bond Clear (Kerr) and ImProv (Nobel Biocare).

== Tooth preparation impressions ==

Once the tooth in question has been prepared with acceptable dimensions, it is equally important to make an accurate and dimensionally stable record or impression of the preparation or dental implant, surrounding hard and soft tissues as well as the opposing dental arch so that the restoration created will conform to the required dimensions and ensure the fit is as close as possible without having to make many modifications chair-side.

Impressions can be made digitally or by conventional technique. With regards to conventional impression techniques, the materials selected should have appropriate physical properties and handling characteristics to allow enough detail reproduction and durability when casting a model, including the ability to withstand effective decontamination procedures. Generally, impressions of the arch where the preparation is made are in addition silicone using the &quot;wash impression&quot; technique; impressions of the opposing arch are made in alginate.

Digital impressions can be made using dedicated optical scanners. A review suggests that digital impressions provide the same accuracy as conventional impressions and are found to be more comfortable for patients and easier for dental practitioners.

== Crown manufacture using CAD/CAM ==
* CEREC

=== Chairside CAD/CAM dentistry ===
The CAD/CAM method of fabricating all-ceramic restorations is by electronically capturing and storing a photographic image of the prepared tooth and, using computer technology, crafting a 3D restoration design that conforms to all the necessary specifications of the proposed inlay, onlay or single-unit crown; there is no impression. After selecting the proper features and making various decisions on the computerized model, the dentist directs the computer to send the information to a local milling machine. This machine will then use its specially designed diamond burs to mill the restoration from a solid ingot of a ceramic of pre-determined shade to match the patient&#x27;s tooth. After about 20 minutes, the restoration is complete, and the dentist sections it from the remainder of the unmilled ingot and tries it in the mouth. If the restoration fits well, the dentist can cement the restoration immediately. A dental CAD/CAM machine costs roughly $100,000, with continued purchase of ceramic ingots and milling burs. Because of high costs, the usual and customary fee for making a CAD/CAM crown in the dentist&#x27;s office is often slightly higher than having the same crown made in a dental laboratory.

Typically, over 95% of the restorations made using dental CAD/CAM and Vita Mark I and Mark II blocks are still clinically successful after five years. Further, at least 90% of restorations still function successfully after 10 years. Advantages of the Mark II blocks over ceramic blocks include: they wear down as fast as natural teeth, their failure loads are very similar to those of natural teeth, and the wear pattern of Mark II against enamel is similar to that of enamel against enamel.

In recent years, the technological advances afforded by CAD/CAM dentistry offer viable alternatives to the traditional crown restoration in many cases. Where the traditional indirectly fabricated crown requires a tremendous amount of surface area to retain the normal crown, potentially resulting in the loss of healthy, natural tooth structure for this purpose, the all-porcelain CAD/CAM crown can be predictably used with significantly less surface area. As a matter of fact, the more enamel that is retained, the greater the likelihood of a successful outcome. As long as the thickness of porcelain on the top, chewing portion of the crown is 1.5mm thick or greater, the restoration can be expected to be successful. The side walls which are normally totally sacrificed in the traditional crown are generally left far more intact with the CAD/CAM option. In regards to post and core buildups, these are generally contraindicated in CAD/CAM crowns as the resin bonding materials do best bonding the etched porcelain interface to the etched enamel/dentin interfaces of the natural tooth itself. The crownlay is also an excellent alternative to the post and core buildup when restoring a root canal-treated tooth.

== Crown removal ==

At times it may be necessary to remove crown restorations to enable treatment of the tooth tissue underneath, especially to enable for non-surgical endodontic treatment of a necrotic or previously treated pulp. Several methods are available and the choice is guided normally by the nature and quality of the crown restoration., i.e., whether it is to be retained or to be replaced.

Factors to consider when deciding whether to retain or remove the crown include:
* Replacement cost (time and financial)
* Aesthetic
* Ease of removal
* Marginal integrity
* Planned restoration (including change from a crown to a bridge, or adapting the crown design to act as abutment for a partial denture)
* Access required to treat the tooth safely and effectively (especially with regards to access cavity design)

Temporary crowns are easy to remove and replace therefore do not pose problems.

Before removing definitive crown restorations it is important to plan for a provisional crown, especially if the crown to be removed is expected to be damaged in the process. This usually involves making an impression of the crown so a temporary can be fabricated chair-side or made by the dental laboratory. Several tools and methods are available, which can be classified by how conservative they are to the crown. Normally the tooth, if heavily damaged, should be restored prior to a new crown (whether temporary or definitive) is fitted.
=== Matrix bands ===
Application of a matrix band which is burnished into the undercuts and pulled vertically.

=== Ultrasonic ===
An ultrasonic tip can be applied to a cast metal crown to disrupt the cement lute. This method should be avoided with ceramic restorations as this may lead to fractures.

=== Forceps and crown tractors ===
Crown tractors and forceps can be used to grip the restoration and dislodge it from the tooth preparation. Crown tractors are designed to have rubber grips and powder on their beaks to reduce the risk of damaging ceramic restorations. Crown tractors are quite effective in removing crowns luted with temporary cements.

=== Sticky sweet method or Richwill crown and bridge remover ===
A thermoplastic pliable resin is softened in warm water then placed on the occlusal surface of the crown to be removed. The patient is then asked to bite down, compressing the resin block to two-thirds of its original thickness. The patient is then asked to open the mouth quickly, which should generate enough force to displace the restoration. This method however, is not very effective and has a risk of damaging restorations on or accidentally extracting the opposing tooth. Therefore, before using this method, it is important to look at the state of the opposing tooth.

=== Tapping and pneumatic tools ===
Sliding hammers work by using a tip to engage the crown margin and sliding the weight along the shaft and tapping this to loosen the restoration. Several versions are available. Some are weighted, others are spring loaded. This system is uncomfortable for the patient and is not always successful. It is also contraindicated for periodontically involved teeth, as it can cause unwanted extractions. This system can also damage the ceramic margins.

=== Wedging devices ===
A slot is cut using the side of a long tapered bur, normally on the buccal surface of the crown, all the way into the cement lute. A flat plastic instrument, straight Warrick James, Couplands elevators or dedicated systems such as the WamKey, is inserted into the slot created to wedge the crown apart from the tooth.

=== Metalift crown and bridge removal system ===
Based on the &quot;jack-screw&quot; principle, the Metalift system works by drilling a precision channel through the occlusal surface of a cast restoration, then with a special bur, the area around the periphery of the hole is undermined before a threaded screw is wound into the space. As the screw comes in contact with the core of the restoration, the continued rotation of the screw results in a jacking force that displaces the crown from the preparation. This system can be used to remove both all metal crowns and metal-ceramic crowns, although with metal-ceramic crowns care should be taken to remove enough ceramic from the area where the hole created to reduce the chances of fracture. The minimum thickness of metal required for the lifting action is approximately 0.5mm. The damage can repaired with a plastic filling material.

=== Burs ===
The crown can be simply sectioned using a bur.

== History ==
There is evidence of gold dental prosthesis dating back to the Etruscans. Ancient Roman dentists also adopted these tools.

<doc id="1340559" wikidata="Q815674" url="?curid=1340559" title="Bell character">
<text>A bell character (sometimes bell code) is a device control code originally sent to ring a small electromechanical bell on tickers and other teleprinters and teletypewriters to alert operators at the other end of the line, often of an incoming message. Though tickers punched the bell codes into their tapes, printers generally do not print a character when the bell code is received. Bell codes are usually represented by the label &quot;codice_1&quot;. They have been used since 1870 (initially in the Baudot code).

To maintain backward compatibility, video display terminals (VDTs) that replaced teletypewriters included speakers or buzzers to perform the same function, as did the personal computers that followed. Modern terminal emulators often integrate the warnings to the desktop environment (e.g., the macOS Terminal will play the system warning sound) and also often offer a silent &quot;visual bell&quot; feature that flashes the terminal window briefly.

== Representations ==
In ASCII the bell character&#x27;s value is 7 and is named &quot;BELL&quot; or &quot;BEL&quot;. Unicode does not give names to control characters but has assigned it the alias &quot;ALERT&quot; and abbreviation &quot;BEL.&quot; It can sometimes be typed as and displayed as in caret notation. Unicode also includes characters for the visual representation of the character: and .

In the 5-bit Baudot codes, BEL is represented by the number 11 (codice_2) when in &quot;figures&quot; mode. The code is used in EBCDIC.

In the programming language C (created in 1972), and in many languages influenced by it such as Python, the bell character can be placed in a string or character constant with codice_3. &#x27;a&#x27; stands for &quot;alert&quot; or &quot;audible&quot; and was chosen because codice_4 was already used for the backspace character.

== Usage ==

On Unix-like systems, or on MS-DOS or Windows, a user can cause the equivalent of ringing the bell to happen by typing at the command prompt the command:

 echo ^G

where the is produced by holding down and typing . On Unix the user may need to type + first to &quot;quote&quot; the .

On POSIX systems, one may also use:

 printf &#x27;\a&#x27;

and in the Bash shell, one may use ANSI-C quoting:

 echo $&#x27;\a&#x27;

An alternative is to use the tput command, which as a part of the ncurses library is available on most Unix/Linux operating systems:

 tput bel

A program can get the same result by printing the BEL character to a terminal.

On modern systems this may not make a noise; it may instead make a visual indication such as flashing the screen, or do nothing at all.

<doc id="1340560" wikidata="Q875512" url="?curid=1340560" title="Treaty of Turkmenchay">
<text>The Treaty of Turkmenchay (; ) was an agreement between Qajar Iran and the Russian Empire, which concluded the Russo-Persian War (1826–1828). It was second of the series of treaties (the first was the 1813 Treaty of Gulistan and the last, the 1881 Treaty of Akhal) signed between Qajar Iran and Imperial Russia that forced Persia to cede or recognize Russian influence over the territories that formerly were part of Iran. 

The treaty was signed on 22 February 1828 (5 Sha&#x27;ban 1243) in Torkamanchay (a village between Tabriz and Tehran). It made Persia cede the control of several areas in the South Caucasus to Russia: the Erivan Khanate, the Nakhchivan Khanate and the remainder of the Talysh Khanate. The boundary between Russia and Persia was set at the Aras River. These territories are now Armenia, the south of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Nakhchivan and Iğdır Province (now part of Turkey).

The treaty was signed for Persia by the Crown Prince Abbas Mirza and Allah-Yar Khan Asaf al-Daula, chancellor to Shah Fath Ali, and for Russia by General Ivan Paskievich. Similarly to the 1813 Treaty of Gulistan, the treaty was imposed on Persia following a Russian military victory. Paskievich threatened to occupy Tehran in five days unless the treaty was signed.

Following this treaty, as well as the Treaty of Gulistan, Russia completed its conquest of the Caucasian territories from Qajar Iran; what is now Dagestan, eastern Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia, all of which had formed part of its very concept for centuries. The areas north of the Aras River, such as the territory of the contemporary nations of Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia and the North Caucasian Republic of Dagestan, were Iranian until they were conquered by Russia during the 19th century.

Following the two treaties, the formerly Iranian territories came under Russian, and later Soviet control for approximately 180 years, where Dagestan remains a constituent republic within the Russian Federation to this day. Comprising most of the territory ceded in the Gulistan and Turkmenchay treaties, three separate nations would gain independence following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991: namely Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia.

==Terms==

The terms of the treaty are as follow

* Article 4: Persia ceded the Erivan Khanate (most of present-day central Armenia), the Nakhchivan Khanate (most of the present-day Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan), the Talysh Khanate (southeastern Azerbaijan), and the Ordubad and Mughan regions (now also part of Azerbaijan) and also reiterated the cessions made to Russia in the Treaty of Gulistan
* Article 6: Persia promised to pay Russia 10 &quot;korur&quot; in gold or 20 million silver rubles (in 1828 currency).
*Article 7: Russia promised to support Abbas Mirza as the heir to the throne of Persia on the death of Shah Fath Ali (the clause became moot when Abbas Mirza predeceased Shah Fath Ali).
*Article 8: Persian ships lost full rights to navigate all of the Caspian Sea and its coasts, which were given to Russia.
*Persia recognised capitulation rights for Russian subjects in Persia.
*Article 10: Russia gained the right to send consular envoys anywhere in Persia.
*Article 10: both parties accept commercial treaties with detailed conditions.
*Article 13: prisoners-of-war were exchanged.
*Persia officially apologised for breaking its promises made in the Treaty of Gulistan.
*Article 15: Shah Fath Ali Shah promised not to charge or persecute any inhabitant or official in the region of Iranian Azerbaijan for any deed carried out during the war or during the temporary control of the region by Russian troops. In addition, all inhabitants of the aforementioned district were given the right to move from Persian districts to Russian districts within one year.

Article 15 provided for the resettlement of Armenians from Iranian Azerbaijan to the Caucasus, which also included an outright liberation of Armenians taken captive by Persia since 1804 or 1795. This resettlement replaced the 20,000 Armenians who moved to Georgia between 1795 and 1827.

== Aftermath ==
According to Prof. Alexander Mikaberidze:
According to the &quot;Cambridge History of Iran&quot;: 

In combination with the 1813 Treaty of Gulistan, some authors have claimed that the two resulting Iranian territorial cessions separated the Azerbaijani people and the Talysh people from their brethren in Iran. Following the two treaties, the formerly Iranian territories came under the Russian, and later the Soviet control for approximately 180 years, and Dagestan remains a constituent republic within the Russian Federation to this day. Comprising most of the territory ceded in Gulistan and Turkmenchay treaties, three separate nations would gain independence following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991: Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia.

== Repatriation of Armenians ==
By virtue of the 15th term of the Treaty of Turkmenchay, Armenians from the Iranian Azerbaijan Province were given the freedom to emigrate to Russian-controlled territory north of the Aras River. In the period 1828–1831 following Russia&#x27;s annexation, 45,000 Armenians from Iran and 100,000 from the Ottoman Empire immigrated to Russian Armenia. Beginning in October 1829, 7,668 families immigrated to Russian Armenia; ultimately, 14,047 families consisting of 90,000–100,000 people had immigrated.

== Massacre at Russian embassy ==
In the aftermath of the war and the signing of the treaty, anti-Russian sentiment in Persia was rampant. On 11 February 1829, an angry mob stormed the Russian embassy in Tehran and killed almost everyone inside. Among those killed in the massacre was the newly-appointed ambassador to Persia, Aleksander Griboyedov, a celebrated Russian playwright. Griboyedov had played an active role in negotiating the terms of the treaty. As a sign of his apology for the murder of the Russian ambassador, the Shah of Iran gave the Russian Czar his most valuable crown jewel, the Shah Diamond.

<text>The Squeeze is a 1977 British gangster thriller directed by Michael Apted and starring Stacy Keach, Edward Fox, David Hemmings and Stephen Boyd. It was based on the 1974 novel &quot;Whose Little Girl Are You?&quot; by Bill James (as David Craig). The screenplay was by &quot;Minder&quot; creator Leon Griffiths.

==Plot summary==
Before the action depicted in the film begins, Jill had left Naboth who, despite his habitual overdrinking, had managed to keep custody of their two sons. He had lost his job as a police detective and become a private investigator. Jill had since married Foreman and lived with him and his daughter Christine.

In the film, Keith Unslaw leads a gang of criminals including Barry and Taf and their driver Des. They kidnap Jill and Christine, using them to blackmail Foreman into helping the gang raid his security van full of cash. Foreman employs Naboth to help him recover Jill and Christine without doing any damage to his business reputation which he highly prizes.

Naboth follows Foreman to a rendezvous and discovers that the gang leader, Keith, was someone he had successfully investigated when he was a police detective. He tracks the gang to Vic Smith’s house where he intends to rescue Jill and Christine but, instead, Keith recognises him and they beat him up, strip him naked, and send him home.

Jill and Christine are detained by Keith, Barry, Des and Taf in a flat. Christine is left in a room with toys and a bed and rarely features in the action. Jill complies with the men’s demands for her to keep them occupied with cooking and playing backgammon, but eventually they intimidate her into stripping naked in front of them, echoing the way Naboth had been humiliated at Vic’s house.

After the security van raid takes place, Jill and Christine are taken to be handed over to Foreman. Christine is released. Through circumstances, Vic’s daughter is also present and Naboth seizes her, threatening to shoot her if Jill is not released, and eventually she is. Naboth apprehends Vic.

The plot relies on the relationships between the main characters including Jill’s history with Naboth, Foreman valuing his business more than his wife, Naboth and Keith’s past conflict as detective and criminal, and a sub-plot involving Naboth’s relationship with his friend Teddy. It leaves open the possibility that Foreman was in on the kidnap plot as a means of stealing the company’s money and humiliating Jill.

==Cast==
* Stacy Keach as ex-detective Jim Naboth
* Freddie Starr as Naboth’s friend Teddy
* Carol White as Jill
* Alison Portes as Jill’s daughter Christine
* Edward Fox as Jill’s husband Foreman
===Kidnap gang===
* David Hemmings as Keith Unslaw
* Stephen Boyd as Vic Smith
* Roy Marsden as Barry
* Stewart Harwood as Des
* Alan Ford as Taff
===Other cast members===
* Hilary Gasson as Barbara
* Rod Beacham as Dr. Jenkins
* Leon Greene as commissionaire
* Lucinda Duckett as Sharon
* Marjie Lawrence as Beryl
* Steve Jones as extra

==Production==
The film was shot in London in October 1976. Keach said Apted was &quot;a wonderful and intelligent director&quot; who cast the actor on the basis of his appearance in &quot;Conduct Unbecoming&quot; (1975).

The producers of &quot;The Squeeze&quot; enlisted ex-gangster Bob Ramsey to act as a contact between the film unit and the local underworld to cut down on harassment, due to location shooting in rather undesirable areas where criminals were operating. Local people in the area were hired as extras. Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones accidentally became an extra in the film..

The classic Rolls-Royce driven by Stephen Boyd, is known as &quot; the most filmed individual Rolls-Royce motor car &quot;, seen in more than 35 films or TV series. Chassis no. SRH2971. Source www. imcdb.org

Apted called it an &quot;informed look at the British underworld&quot; and said Warner Bros considered the film &quot;too indigenous.&quot;

Keach said the film &quot;didn&#x27;t translate in America but it was well regarded and successful in England.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;The Squeeze&quot; is as neat and skilful a takeover bid as the English cinema has pulled off in a long time. Even if the plot tends to tie itself in knots working in all the emotional complexities, it provides action and moral ambiguity enough to stock a Don Siegel thriller, and a gallery of underworld types as sharply and fully delineated as anything this side of &quot;Performance&quot; [1970].&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;The best to be said for it is that it&#x27;s competently made. Keach suffers some nasty lumps and sundry humiliations, all in the cause of Edward Fox as a security firm exec whose wife and kid are hostages against a million-dollar-plus payoff. Carol White is the terrorized wife, with the complication that she&#x27;s also Keach&#x27;s former spouse. David Hemmings is one of the thugs, and Stephen Boyd turns up as the gang mastermind with a resonant Irish brogue. He&#x27;s an entertaining meanie and tackles the part with relish. The Leon Griffiths screenplay, however, doesn&#x27;t afford much latitude for the others, excepting Freddie Starr in for comic relief as a reformed hood trying to reform his idol, Keach. The latter should be sympathetic but isn&#x27;t – blame the character, not him ... pic has little in the way of style and no great surprises. It does, however, have a kind of gratuitous nasty tone.&quot;

Leon Hunt found &quot;The Squeeze&quot; to be &quot;a better sequel to &quot;Sweeney!&quot; (1977) than &quot;Sweeney 2&quot; (1978) ...[with] its &quot;superbly drawn and vividly played villains&quot;.

&quot;Sight and Sound&quot; said that Apted &quot;makes a fair fist of transferring the dirty cop thriller to Notting Hill&quot; with &quot;real world flair&quot;, but it found &quot;Stacey Keach&#x27;s problems as a drunken ex-copper... unengaging.&quot;

<doc id="1340569" wikidata="Q248902" url="?curid=1340569" title="Marillion.com">
<text>marillion.com is the eleventh studio album by the British neo-prog band Marillion, released on 18 October 1999 by their own label, Intact Records, and distributed by Castle Communications. 

==Background==
It was the last of the three recordings the band made on a contract with Castle between being dropped by EMI Records in 1995 and eventually becoming independent in the 2000s. Continuing Marillion&#x27;s decline in mainstream success, it became the first album to fail to reach UK Top 40, peaking at number 53 and staying in the charts for just one week. It was also the first album from which no singles were released officially. However, &quot;Deserve&quot; was used as a promo single, and &quot;Rich&quot; served as a radio single in Brazil.

Recorded at The Racket Club between December 1998 and August 1999, &quot;marillion.com&quot; was self-produced with additional production from Steven Wilson on five out of nine tracks. The tracks &quot;Tumble Down the Years&quot; and &quot;Interior Lulu&quot; were first recorded and mixed during the recording sessions for &quot;Radiation&quot; (1998), but it was decided not to include them on that album as the band thought the songs were incomplete, and re-recorded them to this album. 

The track &quot;House&quot; features a laid-back dub influence and had the working titles &quot;The Massive Attack Song&quot; and &quot;This House Aches&quot;. &quot;House&quot; was about the disintegration of Steve Hogarth&#x27;s marriage; he said, &quot;The house seemed to somehow ooze the pain we were in, even when nobody was there. There wasn’t a level to which I could turn up the hi-fi that drowned out the silence that was still there.&quot;

The title of the album is a reference to Marillion&#x27;s then-new approach in using the Internet to communicate with their fans and in particular to ensure the financing of projects that would later become known as &quot;crowdfunding&quot;. In 1997, fans had funded a North American tour, which the Red Ant label had been unable to support, by means of an Internet campaign, and the next album, &quot;Anoraknophobia&quot;, would be completely financed by pre-orders, making the band independent from record company support, except for distribution. The line &quot;Thank God for the Internet&quot; from the track &quot;Interior Lulu&quot; (although used ironically in the original context) can also be read as an allusion to Marillion&#x27;s internet activities, and was in fact used as a slogan later. 

While preparing the album, the band&#x27;s management invited fans to send them passport photographs and 732 of these were then used to make up the artwork for the slipcase. As the eleventh studio album, the number 11 can be seen in the &quot;LL&quot; of the name &quot;marillion&quot; on the cover. The front cover was taken at the intersection of Long Acre and the Garrick St looking at Great Newport St near the Palace Theatre.

In 2012, the independent label Madfish, a division of Snapper Music, re-released &quot;marillion.com&quot; as a deluxe edition packaged in a 36-page digibook format with an additional artwork designed by Carl Glover, and as a limited double 180gm heavyweight vinyl edition featuring a slightly modified track listing.

<text>Eero Einar Böök (9 February 1910 – 7 January 1990) was a Finnish chess player and engineer.

==Chess career==
A five-time Finnish champion who represented his country six times in the Chess Olympiad, Böök was awarded the International Master title in 1950 and became an honorary Grandmaster in 1984. His only significant international tournament victory was a tie for first place with Gösta Stoltz in the 1947 Nordic Championship in Helsinki. Perhaps his best tournament finish was sharing eleventh place in the category 14 interzonal, Saltsjöbaden 1948.

Böök played many of the world&#x27;s top players, and had a plus record against Miguel Najdorf (+1 −0 =2). He beat Max Euwe with the black pieces in Dubrovnik in 1950, as well as the Estonian chess player Paul Keres in the 1952 Helsinki Olympiad.

Böök also wrote several chess books.

<text>Prince Krzysztof Zbaraski (, , 1580 – 6 March 1627) was a Polish–Lithuanian member of the gentry social class (&quot;szlachta&quot;). During his life he was a Master of the Stables of the Crown (or &quot;koniuszy koronny&quot;), a member of special committee for Cossacks and tariffs, a skilled diplomat, and a politician of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. He was Starost of Kremenets, Wiślica, Hrubieszów and Bolesławiec.

Zbaraski served as Commonwealth ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1622 to 1624. His diplomatic mission&#x27;s entry to Constantinople was famous for its display of wealth. Zbaraski paid most of the mission&#x27;s costs. For 30,000 talars, the mission ransomed prisoners from battle of Cecora, including Stanisław Koniecpolski. The mission was described in 1633 in the diary of the mission&#x27;s secretary, Samuel Twardowski &quot;Przewazna legacja JO Ksiazecia Krzysztofa Zbaraskiego (&quot;The Important Mission of His Grace Duke Krzysztof Zbaraski&quot;).

Krzysztof Zbaraski was buried in Cracow.

Zbaraski was the brother of Jerzy Zbaraski (who died in 1631 as last of the Zbaraski family). He sponsored the Jesuit collegium in Vinnytsia.

<text>The Rockefeller Archeological Museum, formerly the Palestine Archaeological Museum (&quot;PAM&quot;; 1938–1967), is an archaeology museum located in East Jerusalem, next to Herod&#x27;s Gate, that houses a large collection of artifacts unearthed in the excavations conducted in the British-ruled Mandatory Palestine, mainly in the 1920s and 1930s.

The museum was established through a donation by John D. Rockefeller Jr. for the creation of a museum and research center in Cairo. Designed by British architect Austen Harrison, it blends Western architectural achievements with Eastern influences, using materials such as Turkish nut doors and Armenian ceramics. The foundation stone was laid in June 1930, and the museum opened in January 1938. Initially managed by an international body, it was nationalized by the Jordanians in 1966. During the Six-Day War in 1967, battles occurred in the area, and the museum came under Israeli control. Renamed the &quot;Rockefeller Museum,&quot; it is now managed by the Israel Museum and houses the head office of the Israel Antiquities Authority.

The Museum&#x27;s most prized collection, the Dead Sea Scrolls, were housed in the Museum from their discovery, in 1947, until 1967, when, following the Israeli capture of East Jerusalem, Israel relocated the scrolls to the Israel Museum, in West Jerusalem, with the ownership of these scrolls having been heavily contested ever since. A small part of the scrolls, including the Copper Scroll, had been taken to Amman, and is now part of the collection of The Jordan Museum.

==History==
===Background===
Prior to the establishment of the Museum, the British Mandate&#x27;s Department of Antiquities and British School of Archaeology were housed in an old building in Jerusalem with a small exhibition hall. The only other archaeological museum in Jerusalem at the time was the Franciscan Biblical Museum, built in 1902. Before the First World War, there had been an Ottoman Imperial Museum of Antiquities in Jerusalem (&quot;Müze-i Hümayun&quot;; 1901–1917), later known as the Palestine Archaeological Museum.

In 1919, British town planner Patrick Geddes proposed the establishment of an antiquities museum in Jerusalem. To further the project, the Mandate authorities proposed a special tourism tax in 1924.

Visiting Mandatory Palestine in 1925, James Henry Breasted, founder and director of the University of Chicago&#x27;s Oriental Institute, recognized the need for an archaeological museum in Jerusalem to house important regional finds. Encouraged by Lord Plumer, the British High Commissioner, Breasted approached American philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr., who agreed to donate two million dollars toward the project.

===Construction, Mandate-time museum (1930–1948)===
The museum was designed by Austen Harrison, chief architect of the Mandatory Department of Public Works, who drew up blueprints for a white limestone building integrating eastern and western architectural elements. The cornerstone of the new museum was laid on June 19, 1930, but construction was delayed due to the discovery of tombs dating to the fifth century B.C. at the building site. The museum features a stone bas-relief of the meeting of Asia and Africa above the main entrance together with ten stone reliefs illustrating different cultures and a gargoyle fountain in the inner courtyard carved in 1934 by the British sculptor Eric Gill (1882–1940). Gill also produced stone carved signage throughout the museum in English, Hebrew, and Arabic.

The Palestine Archaeological Museum opened to the public on January 13, 1938. The museum&#x27;s opening was overshadowed by the murder of British archaeologist James Leslie Starkey by local Arabs.

Until the final days of the Mandate period, the museum was administered by the British Palestine Government. On 1 April 1948, it was closed to the public.

===Jordanian period (1948–1967)===
On 20 April 1948, the High Commissioner appointed a council of international trustees to administer the museum. The council consisted of twelve members: two representing the High Commissioner, one from the British Academy, one from the British Museum, one from the French National Academy, one from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two from the Antiquities Departments of the Egyptian, Syrian, Lebanese, Iraqi or Transjordanian governments; one from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, one from the Royal Swedish Academy, one from the American Institute of Archaeology, and one from the American School of Oriental Research in Jerusalem. The board ran the museum until 1966. In the 1950s, controversies arose about objects removed both to Amman and to the Israeli side.

After the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the museum also became a secondary headquarters of the Jordanian Department of Antiquities, headed by Gerald Lankester Harding until 1956. In 1966, the museum was nationalized by King Hussein during the Jordanian annexation of the West Bank.

===Israeli period (since 1967)===
Seven months later, when the 1967 Six-Day War broke out, the museum was captured by an Israeli paratroop brigade. Its hexagonal tower was used as a lookout. Fierce fighting took place here between Israeli and Jordanian forces, culminating in an Israeli victory. The Museum was then officially renamed as the Rockefeller Museum.

The Museum&#x27;s most prized collection, the ancient Dead Sea Scrolls, were moved by Israel from the Museum to the Israel Museum, in West Jerusalem, with the ownership of the scrolls having been heavily contested ever since. Part of the scrolls, including the Copper Scroll, had been taken to the Jordan Museum in Amman.

Since 1967, the museum has been jointly managed by the Israel Museum and the Israel Department of Antiquities and Museums (later reorganized as the Israel Antiquities Authority).

==Collections==
The museum&#x27;s first curator was John H. Iliffe, who arranged the artifacts in chronological order, from two million years ago to 1700 AD. Among the museum&#x27;s prized possessions are 8th-century wooden panels from the Jami Al-Aqsa and 12th-century (Crusader-period) marble lintels from the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Most of the collection consists of finds from the 1920s and 1930s. On display are artifacts unearthed in Jerusalem, Megiddo, Ashkelon, Lachish, Sebastia, and Jericho. One of the Lachish letters is on permanent display at the museum, as are the statuary and stucco decorations from the Umayyad Hisham&#x27;s Palace.

Upon their discovery at Qumran between 1947 and 1956, the ancient Dead Sea Scrolls were housed in the Rockefeller Museum. In 1967, following the Israeli capture of East Jerusalem, Israel relocated the scrolls to the Shrine of the Book, a specially designed building on the grounds of the Israel Museum, in West Jerusalem, with the ownership of these scrolls having been heavily contested ever since. Part of the scrolls, including the Copper Scroll, had been taken to the Jordan Museum in Amman.

Currently, the Rockefeller Museum holds thousands of artifacts ranging from prehistoric times to the Ottoman period. It includes the largest of the Beisan steles (considered &quot;the most impressive find from Egypt&#x27;s rule over Canaan&quot;) a 9,000-year-old statue from Jericho (one of the oldest representations of a human figure ever found), as well as gold jewelry from the Bronze Age.

==Exhibitions==
The museum regularly hosts special exhibitions, such as the 2019/2021 exhibition of Armenian ceramics in Jerusalem. This year-long exhibition, titled “A Glimpse of Paradise,” was organized in collaboration with Yad Ben Zvi, the Ministry of Jerusalem and Heritage, the East Jerusalem Development Company, and the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem.

==Ancient pine tree==
Inside what was to have been the rear courtyard of the museum stood (until it died after nearly 300 years in 1998) one of the oldest pine trees in the country. According to Arab legend, on the site of this pine tree, Ezra the Scribe sat and wrote the Torah for Israel. The stump may still be seen behind the museum.

<text>Ángel Sanz-Briz (28 September 1910 – 11 June 1980) was a Spanish diplomat and humanitarian. Sanz - Briz is credited with saving more than 5,200 Jews in German-occupied Hungary from the Holocaust in the later stages of World War II.

For his actions, Sanz-Briz has been referred to as &quot;the Angel of Budapest&quot; and the &quot;Spanish Schindler&quot;.

==Early life==
Sanz-Briz was born on 28 September 1910 in Zaragoza, the youngest of four sons and one daughter of Felipe Sanz, a merchant, and Pilar Briz. He attended the Colegio Escuelas Pías in Zaragoza, then earned a degree in law at the Complutense University of Madrid.

In 1942, he married Adela Quijano y Secades, with whom he had five children.

==Diplomatic career==
Sanz Briz began his diplomatic career with the Spanish Foreign Ministry in 1933. His first diplomatic posting was to Cairo, Egypt.

At the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, Sanz volunteered for the Nationalists in opposition to the socialist government of Francisco Largo Caballero. Sanz served as a truck driver in the Cuerpo de Ejército Marroquí, a unit of Francisco Franco&#x27;s army created in 1937 and commanded by General Juan Yagüe. Unknowingly, Sanz was part of the same side of the Italian Giorgio Perlasca, who would be his main partner during World War II in Budapest.

On 1 April 1937, almost a year after the start of the Civil War, he was fired by the government of the Second Spanish Republic. However, he was reinstated on 19 August 1938.

==Actions in Hungary==
Sanz-Briz began his posting as the first secretary at the Spanish Embassy in Budapest, Hungary, in 1942.

In the summer of 1944, Sanz-Briz was appointed the embassy&#x27;s chargé d&#x27;affaires. Shortly after the persecution of Hungarian Jews began, he offered on behalf of the Spanish government to provide passports to Jews of Spanish origin, and to negotiate for their protection. He was authorised by his superiors to extend these rights to 200 Jews; however, Sanz-Briz extended his efforts to 200 Jewish families instead.

He lied to the Hungarian authorities and said that Spain, under the dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera, had given Spanish citizenship to descendants of Sephardic Jews expelled from Spain in 1492. Primo de Rivera had issued such a decree on 20 December 1924 but it had been canceled in 1930, a fact the Hungarian authorities were not aware of. Sanz Briz dutifully informed the Spanish Foreign Ministry of his actions, that were deliberately permitted by Madrid through administrative silence, a typical diplomatic procedure used to not compromise the chancellery.

In addition, Sanz-Briz rented buildings and apartments around Budapest at his own expense to shelter for the Jews to whom he had issued papers. He placed Spanish flags at these locations, which survivors referred to as the &quot;Spanish houses&quot; and posted notices indicating that they were offshore properties belonging to the Spanish embassy.

Between June and December 1944, according to Giorgio Perlasca, he and his assistants issued fake Spanish papers to 5,200 Jews, saving them from deportation to concentration camps.

The Spanish government ordered Sanz to leave Hungary in December 1944. In 1944, as the Red Army approached Budapest, he followed government orders to leave for Switzerland. He was replaced by the Italian Giorgio Perlasca, who pretended to be a Spanish consul and continued to issue Spanish visas and to patrol the safehouse system for Jews set up by Sanz Briz.

==Post-war and later life==
After the war, Sanz-Briz continued his diplomatic career, with much of his actions during the war unknown, even to his family. He was posted to San Francisco and Washington, D.C., Ambassador to Lima, Bern, Bayonne, Guatemala, The Hague, Brussels and China (1973, where he became the first Spanish Ambassador). In 1976 he was sent to Rome as Ambassador of Spain to the Holy See, where he died on 11 June 1980.

Sanz Briz himself tells how he was able to save the lives of so many Jews, in Federico Ysart&#x27;s book &quot;Los judíos en España&quot; (1973). He is also the subject of the 2011 Spanish television series &quot;El ángel de Budapest&quot;, based on Diego Carcedo&#x27;s book &quot;Un español frente al Holocausto&quot; (&quot;A Spaniard against the Holocaust&quot;).

==Recognition and legacy==
On 8 October 1966, Yad Vashem recognized Ángel Sanz-Briz as a Righteous Among the Nations.

In 1991, he was recognized by the Holocaust Museum Yad Vashem of the State of Israel, who gave his family the title of Righteous Among the Nations. In 1994 the Government of Hungary gave him the Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary.

In 2015, a street in Óbuda-Békásmegyer in Budapest was renamed Angel Sanz Briz Avenue. Sanz-Briz was also honored with a statue.

Sanz Briz has been caught up in modern Spain&#x27;s debate about the legacy of Francoist Spain and the regime&#x27;s actions during the Holocaust. In 2023, in the Spanish Senate rejected a proposal by far-right party Vox to commemorate Sanz Briz. Vox argued that Sanz Briz acted with the knowledge and direction of the Franco-led Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Left-wing parties, however, accused Vox of attempting to &quot;whitewash Francoism&quot; by associating Sanz Briz&#x27;s actions with the Franco regime.

<doc id="1340590" wikidata="Q2294382" url="?curid=1340590" title="George Newnes">
<text>Sir George Newnes, 1st Baronet (13 March 1851 – 9 June 1910) was a British publisher and editor and a founding figure in popular journalism. Newnes also served as a Liberal Party Member of Parliament for two decades. His company, George Newnes Ltd, was known for such periodicals as &quot;Tit-Bits&quot; and &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;; it continued publishing consumer magazines such as &quot;Nova&quot; long after his death.

==Background and education==
His father, Thomas Mold Newnes, was a Congregational church minister at the Glenorchy Chapel, Matlock. George Newnes was born in Matlock Bath, Derbyshire, and educated at Silcoates School and then at Shireland Hall, Warwickshire, and the City of London School. In 1875, he married Priscilla Hillyard. They had two sons; the eldest died at age eight (his death was said to have devastated his father), and Frank Newnes (born 1876).

==Career==

In 1867 he entered commerce in the &quot;fancy goods&quot; trade, working in London and Manchester.

He began his career in publishing in 1881 when he founded &quot;Tit-Bits&quot; as a direct response to the Elementary Education Act 1870 which introduced education for children aged 5–12 and hence produced a new young generation able to read.

The magazine was initially published in Manchester like a mini-encyclopedia, containing extracts from books and other publications, but principally a diverse range of tit-bits of information presented in an easy-to-read format. He funded the magazine by opening a vegetarian restaurant in Manchester. The addition of competitions increased the readership of the periodical, and in 1884 Newnes moved publication to London. He began to work with W. T. Stead, with whom he founded the &quot;Review of Reviews&quot; in 1890. &quot;Tit-Bits&quot; reached a circulation of 700,000 by the end of the 19th century. It paved the way for popular journalism – most significantly, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; was founded by Alfred Harmsworth, a contributor to &quot;Tit-Bits&quot;, and the &quot;Daily Express&quot; was launched by Arthur Pearson, who worked at &quot;Tit-Bits&quot; for five years after winning a competition to get a job on the magazine.

Arguably his best-known publication was &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;, begun in 1891, in which Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was first able to publish his Sherlock Holmes mystery series. He also founded other magazine titles, including &quot;The Wide World Magazine&quot; (1888), &quot;The Westminster Gazette&quot; (1893), and &quot;Country Life&quot; (1897).

Politically, Newnes was Liberal, and in 1885 he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for the newly created constituency of Eastern Cambridgeshire or Newmarket. He held the seat for ten years, before his defeat by the Conservative millionaire horse-breeder, Harry McCalmont in 1895. In addition, Newnes refounded &quot;The Westminster Gazette&quot; in 1893 to support the Liberal party when &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot; became a Unionist paper.

In 1895 he was created a baronet &quot;of Wildcroft, in the parish of Putney, in the county of London; of Hollerday Hill, in the parish of Lynton, and Hesketh House, in the borough of Torquay, both in the county of Devon.&quot; He paid for the new Putney Library, built in 1899. Around this time he became the main sponsor of the Southern Cross Expedition to Antarctica; part of his contribution was the purchase of a movie camera from Arthur S. Newman, who would later supply similar cameras to Herbert Ponting of Captain Scott&#x27;s 1910-3 Terra Nova Expedition and John Baptist Lucius Noel, photographer on the 1924 Mount Everest expedition.

He re-entered the Commons in 1900 as MP for Swansea, and held the seat until he retired at the January 1910 general election.

Newnes built a large home called Hollerday House in Lynton, North Devon. It was destroyed by fire in 1913. He played a major part in the development of the twin towns of Lynton and Lynmouth. He built an innovative cliff railway — the Lynton and Lynmouth Cliff Railway — to join the two towns, and also provided the town hall and other amenities. Largely as a result of Sir George&#x27;s efforts, the 19-mile Lynton and Barnstaple Railway opened in 1898 ostensibly to bring visitors from the mainline railways at Barnstaple. (He was also involved in funding the Bridgnorth Cliff Railway and the Clifton Rocks Railway, as well as the Lynton Village railway station and the Lynmouth Bay railway station.)

Newnes provided a silver cup for the Newnes Trophy series of chess matches between Great Britain and the United States, conducted over transatlantic cable from 1896 to 1911.

Newnes was involved in the creation of The Inambari Para-Rubber Estates, Limited and held 100,000 shares valued at £1 each. His son Frank became a director in the company, which exported rubber collected near the Inambari River in Peru.

He was chairman of the board of directors of Commonwealth Oil Corporation, and the abandoned oil shale mining site of Newnes, in Australia, was named after him.

Sir George Newnes died at his Lynton home in June 1910 aged 59, having suffered ill health from diabetes for some time. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son, Frank Newnes, who had served as MP for Bassetlaw, Nottinghamshire from 1906 to 1910.

==Publishing company==

In 1891 his publishing business was formed into a company that bore his name, George Newnes Ltd. The company was reconstructed in 1897 with a capital of 1,000,000 pounds, and began the publication of books. In 1896 Newnes founded the book series, The Penny Library of Famous Books.

After Newnes&#x27; death in 1910, his son Frank Newnes succeeded him as president of George Newnes Ltd. Decades after the proprietor&#x27;s death, George Newnes Ltd (and its imprint C. Arthur Pearson Ltd) continued into the 1960s as one of London&#x27;s three leading magazine publishers – along with Odhams Press and the Hulton Press – producing a diverse range of titles from &quot;Lady&#x27;s Companion&quot;, &quot;Woman&#x27;s Own&quot;, &quot;Nova&quot;, &quot;Rave&quot; and &quot;Flair&quot;, to &quot;Practical Mechanics&quot; and &quot;Practical Television&quot;.

In 1959, the company was purchased by Odhams, and in 1961, the company became part of the International Publishing Corporation.

Today, books under the Newnes imprint continue to be published by Elsevier.

<doc id="1340604" wikidata="Q41775" url="?curid=1340604" title="Poète maudit">
<text>A poète maudit is a poet living a life outside or against society. Insanity, crime, violence, abuse of alcohol or other drugs, and in general any societal sin, often resulting in an early death, are typical elements of the biography of a &quot;poète maudit&quot;.

==History of the term==
The phrase &quot;poète maudit&quot; (literally, &quot;accursed poet&quot;) was coined in the beginning of the 19th century by Alfred de Vigny in his 1832 novel &quot;Stello&quot;, in which he calls the poet &quot;&quot; (the race that will always be cursed by the powerful ones of the earth). Charles Baudelaire, Paul Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud are considered typical examples. Lautréamont or Alice de Chambrier are also considered as &quot;poètes maudits&quot;, as is the American 20th-century poet Hart Crane.

The term came into wider usage since Verlaine&#x27;s anthology. Originally it was used just for the writers in his book (see below), but then it became a name for writers (or even artists in general) whose lives and art are outside or against their society. For example, the poet and publisher Pierre Seghers published an anthology &quot;Poètes maudits d&#x27;aujourd&#x27;hui: 1946–1970&quot; (&quot;The accursed poets of today: 1946–1970&quot;) in Paris in 1972, collecting authors such as Antonin Artaud, Jean-Pierre Duprey and 10 others, some of whom (like Artaud) became very famous posthumously.

The term is also used outside France. Examples include American poet Delmore Schwartz, whom Mark Ford called &quot;America&#x27;s most genuine claimant to the title&quot;, Canadian poet Paul Potts, Czech poet Karel Hynek Mácha, the Polish poet Rafał Wojaczek and the Italian poet Salvatore Toma; Wojaczek and Toma committed suicide at an early age. Another notable example of poète maudit is Dino Campana, an Italian author famous for his only poetry collection, the &quot;Canti Orfici&quot;, who died in a psychiatric hospital at the age of forty-six.

== &quot;Les Poètes maudits&quot; ==
Les Poètes maudits is a work by Paul Verlaine that was published in 1884. The work is a homage to Tristan Corbière, Arthur Rimbaud, Stéphane Mallarmé, Marceline Desbordes-Valmore, Villiers de l&#x27;Isle-Adam and Pauvre Lélian (Paul Verlaine himself, the name being an anagram).

<doc id="1340611" wikidata="Q7648727" url="?curid=1340611" title="Susannah Lattin">
<text>Susannah Lattin (January 7, 1848 – August 27, 1868) was an American woman who died of a postpartum infection at an illegal maternity clinic at 6 Amity Place in New York City, operated by Henry Dyer Grindle. Her death led to an investigation which resulted in regulation of maternity clinics and adoptions in New York City in 1868.

==Early life==
Lattin was born in Farmingdale on Long Island. Around 1867, Lattin moved from Farmingdale to Williamsburg in Brooklyn, where she lived with her cousin Andrew Wood.

==Unplanned pregnancy==
Lattin became pregnant by George C. Houghton; he was a clerk at Whitehouse&#x27;s boot and shoe store on Fulton Street, Brooklyn. He paid $50 to Dr. J.C. Harrison to perform an abortion, but Lattin did not go through with it. She was still hoping that Houghton would marry her. Houghton then quit his job and moved to Philadelphia, to escape the situation. Lattin next went to her cousin, George H. Powell who worked as a butcher at the Washington Market to help her. He pretended to be her husband and arranged for her, as &quot;Mrs. Smith&quot;, to see Dr. Henry D. Grindle, who ran an unauthorized &quot;lying-in&quot; hospital that allowed pregnant woman to have their children and have them illegally adopted. The doctor wanted her to pay $150, but she could only pay $100 and he accepted it.
==Death and aftermath==
Lattin checked into the lying-in hospital on August 5, 1868, then a few weeks later she delivered a healthy baby boy who was adopted anonymously without any record kept of the adoptive parents. Around August 18, 1868, she developed a postpartum infection. The medical student who attended to her realized Susannah was in serious condition and was not likely to survive, and he persuaded her to tell him her real name so he could notify her family. The message got to her parents after she had died. Coroner Aaron B. Rollins investigated the death.
From: 6 Amity Place, Manhattan. To: Mr. Henry Lattin. Dear Sir: You daughter is at No. 6 Amity Place, very sick with typhoid fever, and I do not expect her to live twenty-four hours. She inquires about her mother frequently, and wants her to come immediately. Yours truly, E. Daun. P.S. take the Fulton Street cars at the ferry and they will take you to the house. E. Daun.
Susannah Lattin&#x27;s death led to an investigation that resulted in regulating maternity clinics and adoptions in New York City in 1868. 

===Inquest verdict===

Susannah Lattin came to death by metroperitonitis, the result of child-birth at D.H. Grindle&#x27;s establishment at No. 6 Amity Place on August 27, 1868. We further censure Dr. Grindle for the irregular method of operating his business, relative to taking in women to confine, and also the method of adopting children so delivered. We further recommend the Legislature to so enact a law whereby all such establishments shall be under the supervision of the Board of Health, or any other recognized authority. We further condemn the practice of any regular medical college recognizing students connected with any such establishments.

<text>Elena Vyacheslavovna Mukhina (; first name sometimes rendered &quot;Yelena&quot;, last name sometimes rendered &quot;Muchina&quot;; 1 June 196022 December 2006) was a Soviet gymnast who won the all-around title at the 1978 World Championships in Strasbourg, France. Her career was on the rise, and she was widely touted as the next great gymnastics star until 1979, when she broke a leg and missed several competitions. The rushed recovery from that injury, combined with pressure to master a dangerous and difficult tumbling move (the Thomas salto) caused her to break her neck two weeks before the opening of the 1980 Summer Olympics, leaving her permanently quadriplegic.

==Early life==
Elena Mukhina was born 1 June 1960, in Moscow, Russian SFSR. Both her parents died when she was five years old. She was raised by her grandmother, Anna Ivanovna.

==Career==
Mukhina took an interest in gymnastics and figure skating at an early age. When an athletic scout visited her school, she eagerly volunteered to try out for gymnastics. She later joined the CSKA Moscow (&quot;Central Sport’s Club of the Army&quot;) sports club. In recognition of her accomplishments, Mukhina was inducted into the CSKA Hall of Fame.

Up until 1975, Mukhina was an unremarkable gymnast, and Soviet coaches largely ignored her. Then, two separate incidents brought her skills to the forefront for the Soviet team: Romanian domination of the Soviet gymnastics machine at the 1976 Olympics (for which the director for Soviet women&#x27;s gymnastics, Larisa Latynina, was blamed; Latynina&#x27;s response was, &quot;it&#x27;s not my fault that Nadia Comăneci was born in Romania&quot;); and Mukhina&#x27;s transition to working with men&#x27;s coach , who transformed her into one of the most show-stopping gymnasts of her time. She burst onto the scene at the 1978 World Championships in Strasbourg, France. In one of the most stunning all-around performances in history, she won the gold medal, beating Olympic Champions Nadia Comăneci and top-ranked Soviet gymnast Nellie Kim, among others. She also tied for the gold medal in the floor exercise event final, as well as winning the silver in balance beam and uneven bars. She made history in this competition by unveiling her signature moves: a full-twisting layout Korbut flip on bars; a tucked double back salto dismount on beam (a move that is still being used over three decades later); and a full-twisting double back somersault on floor (still an E-rated move in the Code of Points) dubbed the &quot;Muchina&quot;. Yet, in spite of these innovations, Mukhina maintained the classic Soviet style, inspired by ballet movements and expressive lines. She quickly established herself as an athlete to watch for at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.

A documentary film of the Soviet national team (1978) features Mukhina talking with her coach, Mikhail Klimenko, and footage of her rigorous training regimen.

==Injury==
Mukhina&#x27;s floor exercise tumbling passes were considered revolutionary at the time because they included a never-before seen combination salto (the &quot;Muchina&quot;). In 1979, her coach wanted her to take it a step further and become one of the few female gymnasts to do an element taken from men&#x27;s gymnastics, the Thomas salto (a 1½ backflip with 1½ twists ending in a forward roll, perfected by American gymnast Kurt Thomas). Even though Mukhina won the All-Around title and floor exercises at the 1978 World Championship with daring bar routines, a revolutionary balance beam dismount, and a floor routine with its own signature move, she was pressured to add this element to her floor exercises by her own coach and other higher-ranking Soviet coaches.

Mukhina soon realized the Thomas salto was extremely dangerous because it depended on being able to get enough height and speed to make all the flips and mid-air twists and still land in-bounds with enough room to do the forward roll, and it took near-perfect timing to avoid either under-rotation (and landing on the chin) or over-rotation (and landing on the back of the head). In the 1991 documentary &quot;More than a Game&quot;, Mukhina spoke of trying to convince her coach that the Thomas salto was a dangerous element:

In 1979, while training for the 1979 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, Mukhina suffered a broken leg, which kept her out of the World Championships in Fort Worth, Texas, a competition in which the Soviet team suffered its first defeat at the hands of their arch-rivals from Romania, with only Nellie Kim and Stella Zakharova able to medal in apparatus and All-Around disciplines. With less than a year until the 1980 Summer Olympics to be held in Moscow, the pressure was on the Soviet team coaches and doctors to get the previous All-Around champion Mukhina back on her feet and ready for the games.

In an interview with &quot;Ogonyok&quot; magazine, Mukhina blamed the doctors at TsITO (Central Institute of Traumatology and Orthopedics), who were serving the National Team for attempting to rush her back into training too soon, saying she begged them not to remove her cast and discharge her because &quot;they&#x27;re dragging me from home to workouts,&quot; and she knew she was not yet healed. When doctors removed her cast against her wishes and had her try walking on the leg, she said that she knew she was walking &quot;crookedly,&quot; and that something was not right. The TsITO doctors X-rayed the leg, and discovered that the fracture had not healed properly. Mukhina was rushed into surgery that afternoon, but the damage had already been done to her reputation; one of the National Team coaches, she said in the &quot;Ogonyok&quot; interview, showed up at her bed the day after surgery, and outright stated that she &quot;wasn&#x27;t conscientious,&quot; and that she could still &quot;train in a cast.&quot; Once more against her wishes, the doctors removed her cast prematurely, and Mukhina returned to training for the Olympics while beginning a strenuous workout program at CSKA Moscow to lose the weight she had gained while laid up from surgery.

With lingering weakness in her leg, and mounting exhaustion from the grueling weight loss workouts, Mukhina had great difficulty coming back up to speed on what was to be the new end element of one of her floor exercise tumbling passes, the Thomas salto. Despite Mukhina&#x27;s warnings that the element was constantly causing minor injuries, and was dangerous enough to potentially cause major injuries, she was pushed to keep the element in her floor routine, and she continued to practice it, even knowing it was a dangerous element.

On 3 July 1980, while training at the Minsk Palace of Sport two weeks before the Moscow Olympics, Mukhina was practising the pass containing the Thomas salto when she under-rotated the salto and crash-landed on her chin, snapping her spine and leaving her quadriplegic. Her coach Klimenko was not present.

Following the injury, the Soviet Gymnastics Federation remained secretive about the events surrounding Mukhina&#x27;s injury, with information emerging only slowly. Initial rumors were that she had fallen on approach to the vault, then Soviet newspapers reported she had fallen during her dismount from the balance beam, and had a blackout, but then got back up to finish her floor exercise without knowing how badly she had been injured. Finally, word emerged that she had fallen catastrophically during the floor exercise.

Soviet team coach Yuri Titov deflected inquiries about whether Mukhina would be trying for a comeback in 1984, even blaming her &quot;injury&quot; on attempting a skill that she &quot;was not able to do but thought she needed to make the team [...] she suffered injury and missed her chance. [...] All the bad stories, they are not true.&quot;

The Soviet Union awarded her Order of the Badge of Honour in 1980 in response to her injury. In 1982 or 1983, IOC President Juan Samaranch awarded her the Silver Medal of the Olympic Order.

Mukhina became a recluse following the accident and rarely discussed it publicly. In one of her few interviews about the accident, published in &quot;Ogonyok&quot; magazine, she criticized the Soviet gymnastics program for deceiving the public about her injury, and for the system&#x27;s insatiable desire for gold medals and championships:

Despite this, Mukhina took some of the responsibility for not saying no to protect herself from further harm, and noted that her first thought as she lay on the floor with her neck severely broken was, &quot;Thank God, I won&#x27;t be going to the Olympics.&quot;

==Aftermath==
According to Larisa Latynina&#x27;s 2004 interview, Mukhina&#x27;s trainer, Mikhail Klimenko, was affected by her injury. Because of her devastating injury, Mukhina could not be added to the 1980 Soviet Olympic team roster. There was little doubt that the Soviet Olympic women&#x27;s gymnastics team would get the gold medal in the team competition at the 1980 Summer Olympics, as it had at all previous Olympics. Nevertheless, Klimenko had desperately wanted Mukhina to make the Olympic team roster because he wanted to become the &quot;Olympic champion&#x27;s trainer.&quot; Soon after Mukhina&#x27;s paralytic injury, Klimenko emigrated to Italy, where he lived with his children until his death from cancer on 14 November 2007, his 65th birthday.

After Mukhina&#x27;s paralysis and several other close calls with other Olympic-eligible female gymnasts, the Thomas salto was removed from the Code of Points as an allowed skill for women. It remained an allowed skill for men as of 2013, but as of the 2017–2020 quad, rollout skills were banned for both men and women.

Mukhina was a guest columnist for &quot;Moscow News&quot; in the late 1980s. Her injury was a featured topic in the 1991 A&amp;E documentary &quot;More Than a Game&quot;; and her World Championship performance is captured in the ABC Sports video &quot;Gymnastics&#x27; Greatest Stars&quot;. Mukhina took a keen interest in children and young gymnasts both before and after her injury. She also expressed a deep religious faith, and was fond of horses and animated cartoons.

Elena was cared for by her grandmother and, following her death, by Elena Gurina, the former gymnast.

In late July 2021, many people compared Mukhina with Simone Biles, in defense of Biles&#x27; decision to pull out of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics while citing health concerns.

==Death==
Mukhina died of apparent complications from quadriplegia on .

As a tribute, sports magazine &quot;Sovetsky Sport&quot; dedicated the cover of its Christmas 2006 issue to her.

<text>Jay Kenneth Katzen (August 23, 1936 – April 9, 2020) was an American diplomat, business consultant, state legislator, and government agency administrator, and former President of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation. He graduated from Princeton University (1958) and Yale University (1959) and served United States presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower through George H. W. Bush. His positions included White House translator and U.S. representative to the United Nations. From 1977 to 1979 he served chargé d&#x27;affairs ad interim to Congo (Brazzaville). He became active in Virginia politics when elected in 1993 to represent the 31st legislative district of the Virginia House of Delegates. In 2001, he was the Republican Party&#x27;s nominee for Lieutenant Governor of Virginia.

He received his B.A. (&quot;magna cum laude&quot;) in Political Science from Princeton University in 1958 and his M.A. in International Relations from Yale University the following year. He attended the National War College in 1977, was a visiting professor at the Boston College Graduate School of Management 1978-79, and was a member of advisory boards at the Duke University Primate Center in 1986 and the University of Kentucky’s Patterson School of Diplomacy and International Commerce in 1989.

Jay and his wife of 56 years, Paddy, were driving forces in the construction of the Victims of Communism Memorial in Washington, D.C. He was chairman of the Board of the Combat Wounded Veteran Challenge. The Katzens moved to Alaska in 2009, where he continued his service as a National Park Ranger.

==U.S. Government==
From 1959 to 1979, Jay Katzen served as a career Foreign Service Officer with the U.S. Department of State. His posts included Australia, Burundi, Congo (Kinshasa), communist Romania, Mali, the U.S. Mission to the United Nations in New York, and Congo (Brazzaville). He also was assigned to Washington D.C. – at the State Department and the White House. His responsibilities included consular affairs, promoting American business, political and economic reporting, labor affairs, multilateral negotiation and management. He served as Chargé d&#x27;Affaires at two posts, in one instance, opening and maintaining an embassy.

Katzen was trained at the U.S. State Department’s Foreign Service Institute to speak five languages: French, Romanian, Swahili, Lingala and Kirundi. 

In 1990, Katzen was appointed by President Reagan and confirmed by the U.S. Senate as Vice Chairman of the Board of the African Development Foundation, and served in that capacity for two years.

From February 2004 to January 2009, Katzen served as the U.S. Peace Corps’ Regional Director overseeing 19 programs in Europe, the Mediterranean area, and Asia. From August 2005 to May 2006, he served concurrently as Acting Chief of Staff/Chief of Operations of the Peace Corps.

In 2011, Katzen was a Park Ranger at the Talkeetna Ranger Station in Denali National Park, Alaska.

==Legislative experience==
Katzen was elected in 1993 to represent the 31st legislative district of Fauquier, Rappahannock, and Warren counties in Virginia&#x27;s House of Delegates. He was chosen freshman class president, a party whip, and co-patroned over 2,500 bills, including landmark legislation improving the quality of Virginia’s education, and reforming welfare and law enforcement. He served on the Finance, Education, and Agriculture Committees, on the Governor’s Blue Ribbon Commission on Champion Schools, and on the Council on Indians. He was re-elected twice.

Katzen was the Republican Party’s nominee for Lieutenant Governor in 2001 and for United States Congress in Virginia’s Ninth District in 2002.

==Private sector==

In 2003, Katzen was chosen in a national search to become CEO and President of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, charged by Congress and the White House—with bipartisan support—to erect a memorial in Washington to the 100 million victims of communism. The monument was unveiled and dedicated by the Foundation’s Honorary Chairman, President George W. Bush, in June 2007.

From 1979 to 1991, Katzen served as a senior advisor reporting directly to the chairmen and senior executives of corporations including Bechtel, Consolidated Gold Fields, Fluor, Kennecott, Newmont Mining, and Phelps Dodge, helping to steer those companies to successful investment opportunities abroad.

==Recognition==

He served as chairman of the Rappahannock River Basin Commission, and as a board member of the Jamestown-Yorktown Foundation. Katzen was named the Family Foundation’s Legislator of the Year, and is a recipient of a Martin Luther King Jr. award.
