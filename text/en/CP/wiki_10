<doc id="1314961" wikidata="Q1210771" url="?curid=1314961" title="The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.">
<text>The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T. is a 1953 American musical fantasy film about a boy who dreams himself into a fantasy world ruled by a diabolical piano teacher enslaving children to practice piano forever. It is the only non-documentary feature film written by Theodor Seuss Geisel (Dr. Seuss), who wrote the story, screenplay, and lyrics. It was directed by Roy Rowland, with many uncredited takes directed by producer Stanley Kramer. The film stars Peter Lind Hayes, Mary Healy, Hans Conried, and Tommy Rettig.

==Plot==
Young Bart Collins (Tommy Rettig) lives with his widowed mother Heloise (Mary Healy). The bane of Bart&#x27;s existence is the hated piano lessons he endures under the tutelage of the authoritarian Dr. Terwilliker (Hans Conried). Bart feels that his mother has fallen under Terwilliker&#x27;s influence, and gripes to their plumber, August Zabladowski (Peter Lind Hayes), without result. While hammering at his lessons, Bart dozes off and enters a musical dream.

In the dream, Bart is trapped at the surreal Terwilliker Institute, where the piano teacher is a madman dictator who has imprisoned non-piano-playing musicians. He built a piano so large that it requires Bart and 499 other boys (hence, 5,000 fingers) to play it. Bart&#x27;s mother has become Terwilliker&#x27;s hypnotized assistant and bride-to-be, and Bart must dodge the Institute&#x27;s guards as he scrambles to save his mother and himself. He tries to recruit Mr. Zabladowski, who was hired to install the Institute&#x27;s sinks ahead of a vital inspection, but only after skepticism and foot-dragging is Zabladowski convinced to help. Having convinced him, Bart and Zabladowski free Heloise and attempt to flee, but are captured. In the dungeon, the two construct a noise-sucking contraption which ruins the mega-piano&#x27;s opening concert. The enslaved boys run riot, and the &quot;atomic&quot; noise-sucker explodes in spectacular fashion, bringing Bart out from his dream.

The movie ends on a hopeful note for Bart, when Mr. Zabladowski notices Heloise and offers to drive her to town in his jeep. Bart escapes from the piano and runs down the street to play, with his dog Sport joyfully capering at his heels.

==Production==
In the wake of the success of &quot;Gerald McBoing-Boing&quot;, Geisel submitted a live-action storyline for &quot;The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.&quot; in 1951. Geisel followed it up with a 1200-page script, with &quot;themes of world dominance and oppression coming out of World War II.&quot; Geisel relocated from La Jolla, California, to Los Angeles during filming to &quot;enable him to be more involved in the production.&quot; His influence on set design and choreography is evident in the film.

Although Geisel was unaware of it at the time, his film production had landed in the middle of a bitter feud between film producer Stanley Kramer and the head of Columbia Pictures, Harry Cohn. Thus the shooting of the film was fraught from the start. Kramer had been forbidden from directing the movie himself by Cohn, and instead had appointed a studio journeyman, Roy Rowland. It also did not help that Cohn interfered constantly with the production by sending voluminous and unwanted notes to Kramer and Geisel.

Hans Conried was enthusiastic about the role, saying in retrospect, &quot;I had never had any such part before, never have since and probably never will again. We rehearsed for eight weeks before I was engaged to shoot for eight weeks, an extravagance that I as a bit player had never known ... If it had been a success, with my prominent part in the title role, it would have changed my life.&quot;

Prior to release, a &quot;preview version&quot; was received poorly by a test audience. That prompted heavy cuts by the studio and a week of reshoots, included a new opening scene. Of the original 20 musical numbers filmed in their entirety, nine were removed. The removed songs still survive with the complete musical soundtrack. The &quot;preview version&quot; featuring the removed footage is considered lost. Columbia Pictures released the film a second time in 1958 with the entire elevator scene cut, under the title &quot;Crazy Music&quot;.

==Musical score==
The score was composed by Frederick Hollander with lyrics by Dr. Seuss. It earned an Oscar nomination for &quot;Best Scoring of a Musical Picture&quot;.

The singing voice of Tommy Rettig was dubbed by Tony Butala, the founder of The Lettermen.

The pre-recorded piano parts were performed uncredited by veteran Hollywood studio session pianist Ray Turner (1903–1971), who was known to the public for his own recordings, and for his piano performance on the popular 1948 children&#x27;s album &quot;Sparky&#x27;s Magic Piano&quot;.

==Reception ==
At the Hollywood premiere, the first patrons began to trickle out after 15 minutes. After an hour it had become a tsunami. The leading man Hans Conried was quoted as saying by biographer Suzanne Gargiulo, &quot;At the end there was only one boy left and he was waiting for his mother to pick him up&quot;. At the time it was released, the film received negative reviews from critics. Bosley Crowther called the film &quot;strange and confused&quot; and said:
...this [film] is not only abstruse in its symbols and in its vast elaboration of reveries but [is] also dismally lacking in the humor or the enchantment such an item should contain.

Geisel regarded the film as a &quot;debaculous fiasco&quot; and omitted mention of it in his official biography. He even stated after the film &quot;Hollywood is not suited for me and I am not suited for it.&quot;

Hans Conried reflected on the film&#x27;s box office failure in a 1970 interview with Leonard Maltin: &quot;The picture never made its print money back. It was comparable only to &quot;Wilson&quot; as one of the great money-losers of all time; it would stop conversation for some years at any Hollywood social gathering.&quot;

===21st century===
The film may have fared better over the years; , it has a 82% positive Rotten Tomatoes rating.

The home media releases of the film have spawned many new reviews. In 2001, Glenn Erickson wrote that the film was &quot;another flop that has since gained the reputation of an artsy classic - a real cult film. It&#x27;s colorful, energetic, and indeed can boast fine work by a cadre of talented Hollywoodians. But it&#x27;s not very good.&quot; Later critics were more enthusiastic. In 2002, Peter Bradshaw said the film &quot;has charm, a riotous imagination, and some very weird dream-like sets by production designer Rudolph Sternad and art director Cary Odell&quot;; it&#x27;s &quot;surreal, disturbing, strong meat for young stomachs.&quot; In 2005, Violet Glaze of the &quot;Baltimore City Paper&quot; called the film &quot;refreshingly tart and defiant for a children&#x27;s film, its space-age-by-way-of-Caligari world parks right on the delicious side of creepy. Bring the kids, especially the smart ones.&quot; In 2008, Dennis Schwartz wrote that it was &quot;probably the best children&#x27;s fantasy film ever made by Hollywood—even if it&#x27;s rambling.&quot; Jello Biafra named it his all-time favourite movie in a 2013 interview.

The film has also inspired the name of an electronic duo, 5000 Fingers of Dr T, formed in Sydney, Australia in 1994.

==Home media==
The film was released by RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video in 1991. It was then re-released in 1995, as part of the Columbia Tristar family collection. It became available on DVD in 2001 by Columbia Tristar Home Entertainment. It featured the Gerald McBoing-Boing short, Gerald McBoing-Boing&#x27;s Symphony, as a bonus feature. Sony then re-released the DVD in 2008 as part of the Stanley Kramer collection. Finally, it was released as a region 1 Blu-Ray and DVD in 2016 by Mill Creek Entertainment, under licence from Sony.

==Soundtrack==
The music that was composed for the film, including material that was not used in the extant copies of the film itself, was released as a set of 3 CDs in 2010. In 2007, a soundtrack CD (ACMEM126CD) was released by Él Records in association with Cherry Red Records.

<text>Terri Minsky (born August 27, 1957) is an American television writer and producer who created &quot;The Geena Davis Show&quot;, &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot;, &quot;Less Than Perfect&quot;, and &quot;Andi Mack&quot;.

==Early and personal life==
Minsky grew up in Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania. A mother of two, Minsky published a reflection, &quot;The Mother Load,&quot; on balancing time between her work and family in &quot;Literary Mama&quot;. Minsky is Jewish.

==Career==
Minsky was a writer for the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, &quot;Premiere&quot;, &quot;New York&quot;, and &quot;Esquire&quot;.

Minsky&#x27;s first writing credits were for episodes of &quot;Doctor Doctor&quot; in 1989 and &quot;Flying Blind&quot; in 1992–1993. Minsky was the executive producer of &quot;Sherri&quot;, a Lifetime series that ran for one season in 2009. In 2014, Minsky co-wrote the pilot for MTV&#x27;s &quot;Finding Carter&quot;, which debuted on July 8, 2014, and was the show&#x27;s executive producer for its first season.

Minsky created and executive produced the GLAAD Award-winning Disney Channel series, &quot;Andi Mack&quot;, which began development in 2015, production in 2016, and aired from 2017 to 2019. It was also her second TV series for the Disney Channel following 2001&#x27;s &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot;.

Following the end of &quot;Andi Mack&quot;, in August 2019, it was announced that Minsky had signed a deal to create future series and films for Disney Channel and the upcoming Disney+ streaming service, as her first project under this deal being a revival of &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot;. Minsky exited her role as showrunner of the revival on January 9, 2020, after the first two episodes of the series had been filmed due to creative differences with Disney, and the revival has since been cancelled.

<doc id="1315049" wikidata="Q1253346" url="?curid=1315049" title="Downsampling (signal processing)">
<text>In digital signal processing, downsampling, compression, and decimation are terms associated with the process of &quot;resampling&quot; in a multi-rate digital signal processing system. Both &quot;downsampling&quot; and &quot;decimation&quot; can be synonymous with &quot;compression&quot;, or they can describe an entire process of bandwidth reduction (filtering) and sample-rate reduction. When the process is performed on a sequence of samples of a &quot;signal&quot; or a continuous function, it produces an approximation of the sequence that would have been obtained by sampling the signal at a lower rate (or density, as in the case of a photograph).

&quot;Decimation&quot; is a term that historically means the &quot;removal of every tenth one&quot;. But in signal processing, &quot;decimation by a factor of 10&quot; actually means &quot;keeping&quot; only every tenth sample. This factor multiplies the sampling interval or, equivalently, divides the sampling rate. For example, if compact disc audio at 44,100 samples/second is &quot;decimated&quot; by a factor of 5/4, the resulting sample rate is 35,280. A system component that performs decimation is called a &quot;decimator&quot;. Decimation by an integer factor is also called &quot;compression&quot;.

==Downsampling by an integer factor==
Rate reduction by an integer factor &quot;M&quot; can be explained as a two-step process, with an equivalent implementation that is more efficient:
# Reduce high-frequency signal components with a digital lowpass filter.
# &quot;Decimate&quot; the filtered signal by &quot;M&quot;; that is, keep only every &quot;M&quot;th sample.

Step 2 alone creates undesirable aliasing (i.e. high-frequency signal components will copy into the lower frequency band and be mistaken for lower frequencies). Step 1, when necessary, suppresses aliasing to an acceptable level. In this application, the filter is called an anti-aliasing filter, and its design is discussed below. Also see undersampling for information about decimating bandpass functions and signals.

When the anti-aliasing filter is an IIR design, it relies on feedback from output to input, prior to the second step. With FIR filtering, it is an easy matter to compute only every &quot;M&quot;th output. The calculation performed by a decimating FIR filter for the &quot;n&quot;th output sample is a dot product:

:formula_1

where the &quot;h&quot;[•] sequence is the impulse response, and &quot;K&quot; is its length.  &quot;x&quot;[•] represents the input sequence being downsampled. In a general purpose processor, after computing &quot;y&quot;[&quot;n&quot;], the easiest way to compute &quot;y&quot;[&quot;n&quot;+1] is to advance the starting index in the &quot;x&quot;[•] array by &quot;M&quot;, and recompute the dot product. In the case &quot;M&quot;=2, &quot;h&quot;[•] can be designed as a half-band filter, where almost half of the coefficients are zero and need not be included in the dot products.

Impulse response coefficients taken at intervals of &quot;M&quot; form a subsequence, and there are &quot;M&quot; such subsequences (phases) multiplexed together. The dot product is the sum of the dot products of each subsequence with the corresponding samples of the &quot;x&quot;[•] sequence. Furthermore, because of downsampling by &quot;M&quot;, the stream of &quot;x&quot;[•] samples involved in any one of the &quot;M&quot; dot products is never involved in the other dot products. Thus &quot;M&quot; low-order FIR filters are each filtering one of &quot;M&quot; multiplexed &quot;phases&quot; of the input stream, and the &quot;M&quot; outputs are being summed. This viewpoint offers a different implementation that might be advantageous in a multi-processor architecture. In other words, the input stream is demultiplexed and sent through a bank of M filters whose outputs are summed. When implemented that way, it is called a polyphase filter.

For completeness, we now mention that a possible, but unlikely, implementation of each phase is to replace the coefficients of the other phases with zeros in a copy of the &quot;h&quot;[•] array, process the original &quot;x&quot;[•] sequence at the input rate (which means multiplying by zeros), and decimate the output by a factor of &quot;M&quot;. The equivalence of this inefficient method and the implementation described above is known as the &quot;first Noble identity&quot;. It is sometimes used in derivations of the polyphase method.
===Anti-aliasing filter===

Let &quot;X&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) be the Fourier transform of any function, &quot;x&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), whose samples at some interval, &quot;T&quot;, equal the &quot;x&quot;[&quot;n&quot;] sequence. Then the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) is a Fourier series representation of a periodic summation of &quot;X&quot;(&quot;f&quot;):
:formula_2

When &quot;T&quot; has units of seconds, formula_3 has units of hertz. Replacing &quot;T&quot; with &quot;MT&quot; in the formulas above gives the DTFT of the decimated sequence, &quot;x&quot;[&quot;nM&quot;]:

:formula_4

The periodic summation has been reduced in amplitude and periodicity by a factor of &quot;M&quot;.  An example of both these distributions is depicted in the two traces of Fig 1.
Aliasing occurs when adjacent copies of &quot;X&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) overlap. The purpose of the anti-aliasing filter is to ensure that the reduced periodicity does not create overlap. The condition that ensures the copies of &quot;X&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) do not overlap each other is: formula_5 so that is the maximum cutoff frequency of an &quot;ideal&quot; anti-aliasing filter.

==By a rational factor==

Let &quot;M/L&quot; denote the decimation factor, where: 

#Increase (resample) the sequence by a factor of &quot;L&quot;. This is called Upsampling, or &quot;interpolation&quot;.
#Decimate by a factor of &quot;M&quot;

Step 1 requires a lowpass filter after increasing (&quot;expanding&quot;) the data rate, and step 2 requires a lowpass filter before decimation. Therefore, both operations can be accomplished by a single filter with the lower of the two cutoff frequencies. For the &quot;M&quot; &gt; &quot;L&quot; case, the anti-aliasing filter cutoff, formula_6 &quot;cycles per intermediate sample&quot;, is the lower frequency.

<text>Aleksander Korwin Gosiewski () &quot;de armis&quot; Ślepowron (b. – d. 1639), was a Polish nobleman, military commander and diplomat, Lithuanian Field-Quartermaster since 1630, Palatine-Governor of Smolensk from 1625, Lithuanian Great-Quartermaster since 1615, Speaker of the Parliament in 1613, Great-Secretary of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from 1610 and District-Governor of Wieliż, Puńsk, Kupise, Biel, and Markowa.

==Biography==

===Youth===
He came from the noble family Gosiewski of Zambrów powiat in the Łomża Land, a family entitled to use the coat of arms Ślepowron. He was a son of Jan Gosiewski who was married to Ewa (&quot;née&quot; Pac, the Chamberlain of Brest’s daughter).

Already in his youth, as Lew Sapieha’s courtier, he was involved in affairs of state. In 1600, as member of Lew Sapieha&#x27;s retinue, he played a significant role in the negotiations with the Tsardom of Russia, editing the planned alliance acts between Poland-Lithuania with the Russian state. In 1602 as District-Governor of Wieliż, he attended the drawing of the border between Poland-Lithuania and Moscovia and later became famous repelling a Russian attack on his own district. During the wars of Sigismund III Vasa against his uncle Charles IX of Sweden, the King of Sweden, he served in the Lithuanian army. In 1605, he fought at the Battle of Kircholm. In 1606, as a member of the retinue of Mikołaj Oleśnicki, he escorted Maryna Mniszchówna to Moscow, where he led negotiations for an alliance with False Dmitriy I.

===Military career===

He was an ardent supporter of Polish-Lithuanian military intervention in Russia during the Time of Troubles. In July 1609, he conducted his own expedition to Velikiye Luki. He became famous for using fire bombs during the siege of Smolensk. In 1610 he headed a large army to the north of Smolensk, whose objective was to capture Bely fortress. Subsequently, he reached Moscow, which, after the battle of Klushino was taken by Great-Commander Stanisław Żółkiewski. In 1610, he was appointed by Żółkiewski to lead the Polish-Lithuanian garrison in the Moscow Kremlin. In 1611 the Russians betrayed their Polish patrons, and the ensuing insurrection led to the great fire of Moscow. In the year 1612 he handed over command of the Polish-Lithuanian garrison to Mikołaj Struś and returned to Lithuania. Residents of the city under the leadership of a merchant Kuzma Minin and Prince Dmitry Pozharsky began to besiege the Kremlin. The commander of the Polish-Lithuanian garrison in the Kremlin, Strus, realizing that there would be no relief of the siege coming from the Polish king Sigismund III Vasa, surrendered on 4 November 1612. To commemorate the event tsar Mikhail Romanov instituted a holiday named &quot;Day of Moscow’s Liberation from Polish Invaders&quot; in 1613. In 2004 the public holiday became the Unity Day, which was first celebrated in 2005.

In 1612, he was the commander at Smolensk which he defended against numerous Russian attacks. In 1615, as Lithuanian Field-Quartermaster, he led a small army to block the new Russian army. In 1617 and 1618, Polish-Lithuanian troops participated in a failed expedition to Moscow led by Prince Wladyslaw. In 1618, he commanded the garrison during the siege of Smolensk. After the arrival of the king&#x27;s troops he camped together with the Commander Jan Karol Chodkiewicz’ troops besieging the city.

===Politics===

He was the Marshal of the Sejm which was held in Warsaw from 3 December to 24 December 1613. During the war with Sweden (1621–1625 war) and the (war 1626–1629) he fought in Livonia winning against the Swedish army at Kroppenhof, Lixna, Kreutzburg and Dyneburg. Due to his successes in fighting the Swedes that he was appointed Palatine-Governor of Smolensk region. Seeing the threat from Russia, Gosiewski immediately upon taking the governorate of Smolensk began to renovate the walls of the city. He personally oversaw the construction of Sigismund Fortress, which strengthened the eastern part of the stronghold. He intensively collected supplies of food and ammunition, and developed an intelligence network to gather valuable information about Moscow&#x27;s war preparations. In the spring of 1632, he reviewed the fortifications in Dorogobuzh and other frontier forts.

During the war with Russia, in the year 1632 and 1634, after a particularly famous defense of Smolensk – for ten months he defended the city against besieging forces led by Mikhail Shein, repelling all assaults, until the advent of the battle led by Prince Władysław, he fought at Vitebsk, Alder and Mstislav. He participated as a Commissioner in peace negotiations which concluded on 14 June 1634, in Treaty of Polanów.

For his services, he received numerous lands in the province of Smolensk. He founded the Jesuits’ College in Vitebsk and the female Monastery of the Holy Brigit at Brest-Litovsk. As Palatine-Governor, he commemorated the death of his longtime client – Jan Kunowski, who in 1640 wrote a series of poems dedicated to his late patron.

===Death===
He died on May 23, 1639.

==Family==
Aleksander Korwin Gosiewski came from the Ślepowron branch of the family.

He was married to Ewa Pac. They had one daughter, Zuzanna, and two sons; Wincenty and Krzysztof.

In the United States, a contractor may be a sole proprietor managing a project and performing labor or carpentry work, have a small staff, or may be a very large company managing billion dollar projects. Some builders build new homes, some are remodelers, some are developers.

==Description==
A general contractor is a construction manager employed by a client, usually upon the advice of the project&#x27;s architect or engineer. General Contractors are mainly responsible for the overall coordination of a project and may also act as building designer and construction foreman (a tradesman in charge of a crew).

A general contractor must first assess the project-specific documents (referred to as a bid, proposal, or tender documents). In the case of renovations, a site visit is required to get a better understanding of the project. Depending on the project delivery method, the general contractor will submit a fixed price proposal or bid, cost-plus price or an estimate. The general contractor considers the cost of home office overhead, general conditions, materials, and equipment, as well as the cost of labor, to provide the owner with a price for the project.

Contract documents may include drawings, project manuals (including general, supplementary, or special conditions and specifications), and addendum or modifications issued prior to proposal/bidding and prepared by a design professional, such as an architect.The general contractor may also assume the role of construction manager, responsible for overseeing the project while assuming financial and legal risks.There are several types of risks can occur include cost overruns, delays, and liabilities related to safety or contract breaches.

Prior to formal appointment, the selected general contractor to whom a client proposes to award a contract is often referred to as a &quot;preferred contractor&quot;.

==Responsibilities==
A general contractor is responsible for providing all of the material, labor, equipment (such as heavy equipment and tools) and services necessary for the construction of the project. A general contractor often hires specialized subcontractors to perform all or portions of the construction work. When using subcontractors, the general contractor is responsible for overseeing the quality of all work performed by any and all of the workers and subcontractors.

It is a best practice for general contractors to prioritize safety on the job site, and they are generally responsible for ensuring that work takes place following safe practices.

A general contractor&#x27;s responsibilities may include applying for building permits, advising the person they are hired by, securing the property, providing temporary utilities on site, managing personnel on site, providing site surveying and engineering, disposing or recycling of construction waste, monitoring schedules and cash flows, and maintaining accurate records.

The general contractor may be responsible for some part of the design, referred to as the &quot;contractor&#x27;s design portion&quot; (JCT terminology).

==United Kingdom, Commonwealth and Australia usage==
In the United Kingdom, Australia and some British Commonwealth countries, the term &#x27;general contractor&#x27; was gradually superseded by builders during the early twentieth century. This was the term used by major professional, trade, and consumer organizations when issuing contracts for construction work, and thus the term &#x27;general contractor&#x27; fell out of use except in large organizations where the main contractor is the top manager and a general contractor shares responsibilities with professional contractors.

General contractors who conduct work for government agencies are often referred to as &quot;builders&quot;. This term is also used in contexts where the customer&#x27;s immediate general contractor is permitted to sub-contract or circumstances are likely to involve sub-contracting to specialist operators e.g. in various public services.

== United States and Asia usage ==
In the United States and Asia, the terms general contractor (or simply &quot;contractor&quot;), prime contractor and main contractor are often interchangeable when referring to small local companies that perform residential work. These companies are represented by trade organizations such as the NAHB.

==Licensing requirements==
Licensing requirements to work legally on construction projects vary from locale to locale. In the United States, there are no federal licensing requirements to become a general contractor, but most US states require general contractors to obtain a local license to operate. It is the states&#x27; responsibility to define these requirements: for example, in the state of California, the requirements are stated as follows:

In every state that requires a license, a surety bond is required as part of the licensing process, with the exception of Louisiana, where bonding requirements may vary in different parishes. Not all states require General Contractor licenses - these include Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, among others.

==Licensing qualifications==
Some general contractors obtain bachelor&#x27;s degrees in construction science, building science, surveying, construction safety, or other disciplines.

General Contractors often learn about different aspects of construction, including masonry, carpentry, framing, and plumbing. Aspiring general contractors communicate with subcontractors and may learn the management skills they need to run their own company.

Experience in the construction industry as well as references from customers, business partners, or former employers are demanded. Some jurisdictions require candidates to provide proof of financing to own their own general contracting firm.

General Contractors often run their own business. They hire subcontractors to complete specialized construction work and may manage a team of plumbers, electricians, bricklayers, carpenters, iron workers, technicians, handymans, architects and roofers. General Contractors build their business by networking with potential clients, buying basic construction tools, and ensuring that their subcontractors complete high-quality work. General Contractors do not usually complete much construction work themselves, but they need to be familiar with construction techniques so they can manage workers effectively. Other reasons include access to specialist skills, flexible hiring and firing, and lower costs.

==General contractor example==
A property owner or real estate developer develops a program of their needs and selects a site (often with an architect). The architect assembles a design team of consulting engineers and other experts to design the building and specify the building systems. Today contractors frequently participate on the design team by providing pre-design services such as providing estimations of the budget and scheduling requirements to improve the economy of the project. In other cases, the general contractor is hired at the close of the design phase. The owner, architect, and general contractor work closely together to meet deadlines and budget. The general contractor works with subcontractors to ensure quality standards; subcontractors specialise in areas such as electrical wiring, plumbing, masonry, etc.

<doc id="1315081" wikidata="Q1202273" url="?curid=1315081" title="Hotfix">
<text>A hotfix is a software update that is released outside the normal update cycle or intended to be applied to a live system; often to fix a bug.

Originally, &quot;hotfix&quot; referred to patching a &quot;hot&quot; system a production server that is actively serving clients. For development, such a change usually must be designed quickly and outside normal development processes; at relatively high cost and disrupting other development effort. For the user, a hotfix is relatively risky since it is applied to a server without time for testing it. The risk of applying the hotfix must be weighed against the risk of &quot;not&quot; applying it. The problem to be fixed might be so critical that inaction is riskier than the potential loss of service.

Over time, the meaning has shifted to an update that is created with urgency or released outside the normal update cycle for the software.

Applying (installing) a hotfix generally involves the same process as any software update. Most modern operating systems and desktop applications can download and apply updates automatically. Network administrators may use software programs to automate and simplify applying updates to the machines they manage.

==Use by Microsoft==

Microsoft Corporation used the terms &quot;hotfix&quot; or &quot;quick-fix engineering update&quot; (QFE) but has stopped in favor of new terminology. Updates are either delivered in the &quot;general distribution release&quot; (GDR) channel or the &quot;limited distribution release&quot; (LDR) channel the latter synonymous with QFE. GDR updates receive extensive testing whereas LDR updates are meant to fix a certain problem in a small area and are not released to the general public. GDR updates may be received from the Windows Update service or the Microsoft Download Center but LDR updates must be received via Microsoft Support.

<doc id="1315091" wikidata="Q4166040" url="?curid=1315091" title="Judith Donath">
<text>Judith Stefania Donath (born May 7, 1962) is a fellow at Harvard&#x27;s Berkman Center, and the founder of the &quot;Sociable Media Group&quot; at the MIT Media Lab. She has written papers on various aspects of the Internet and its social impact, such as Internet society and community, interfaces, virtual identity issues, and other forms of collaboration that have become manifest with the advent of connected computing.

Her research work includes issues centered on &quot;identity and deception in online communities&quot; and the creation of multiple virtual personae. In 1999 she researched the presence of deception in the online identities of Usenet users, as well as the reconstruction of the personality of an individual using data gathered from both online and offline encounters.

==Career==
Donath obtained her bachelor&#x27;s degree in history from Yale and her master&#x27;s and Ph.D. degrees in media arts and sciences from MIT. Her work includes the design and development of educational software and experimental media.

On October 10, 1995, while still a Ph.D. candidate at MIT, she helped organize a celebration of the tenth anniversary of the MIT Media Lab by conceiving a mass online collaboration project which featured the construction of a large website by worldwide contributors. The event was named &quot;A Day in the Life of Cyberspace&quot; and is an early example of mass collaboration on the Internet.

Her pioneering work includes the first postcard service, named &quot;The Electric Postcard&quot;, and the first interactive art show, titled &quot;Portraits in Cyberspace&quot;.

Her recent work includes directing the exhibit &quot;Id/Entity&quot; which includes collaborative works on the subject of the transformation of portraiture through the use of modern computer technology.

In her 2000 book &quot;Being Real&quot;, Donath explores the problems of cognition arising from the online behavioral dynamics of the interaction between human and possibly automated avatars in a virtual world.

She has investigated the effect of online social media on society as regards the public display of the social interconnections between the members of the online communities as a sort of &quot;Public Displays of Connection&quot;. Her work on sociable media has applications in the field of semiotics.

On the subject of telerobotics, Donath argues that the remote manipulation afforded by the discipline may act as a desensitizing agent because the identity and human characteristics of the remote subjects of the telerobotic operation remain unseen by the human teleoperator of the robot. She has also researched the ethnography of online communities.

Her work includes the application of architectural principles to the design of the social interaction environment of online communities in a kind of virtual city.

She has investigated best practices for online communication and their relation to issues of embodiment, gender, sexuality and identity.

Donath has explored the use of artificial emotions in avatars and their potential use in online advertising. She predicts that artificial avatars will possess &quot;suites of emotions&quot; comparable to an emotional wardrobe, from which they can pick the emotion they need to &quot;wear&quot;, depending on the circumstances. That way they can be used in advertising campaigns to target their intended audience more effectively.

In her essay &quot;Mediated Faces&quot; she analyzes the role of facial representation and interpretation in an online communication environment, suggesting that there are wider possibilities for online facial representation through the use of computer-enhanced environments than a simple linear pictorial representation of the human face.

She has compared the anonymity of online flaming to the anonymity of vandalizing in real life.

Donath spoke on identity, anonymity, and the wiki at the August 2006 Wikimania conference. She returned as Fellow of Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University.

<text>Reginald Innes Pocock, (4 March 1863 – 9 August 1947) was a British zoologist.

Pocock was born in Clifton, Bristol, the fourth son of Rev. Nicholas Pocock and Edith Prichard. He began showing interest in natural history at St. Edward&#x27;s School, Oxford. He received tutoring in zoology from Sir Edward Poulton, and was allowed to explore comparative anatomy at the Oxford Museum. He studied biology and geology at University College, Bristol, under Conwy Lloyd Morgan and William Johnson Sollas. In 1885, he became an assistant at the Natural History Museum, and worked in the section of entomology for a year. He was put in charge of the collections of Arachnida and Myriapoda. He was also given the task to arrange the British birds collections, in the course of which he developed a lasting interest in ornithology. The 200 papers he published in his 18 years at the museum soon brought him recognition as an authority on Arachnida and Myriapoda; he described between 300 and 400 species of millipedes alone, and also described the scorpion genus &quot;Brachistosternus&quot;. In 1929, he proposed the family Nandiniidae, with the genus &quot;Nandinia&quot; as its sole member. He argued that it differs from the Aeluroidea by the structure and shape of its ear canal and mastoid part of the temporal bone.

In 1904, he left to become superintendent of the London Zoo, remaining so until his retirement in 1923. He then worked, as a voluntary researcher, in the British Museum, in the mammals department.
He described the leopon in a 1912 letter to &quot;The Field&quot;, based on examination of a skin sent to him by W. S. Millard, the secretary of the Bombay Natural History Society.

His brother Edward Innes Pocock played international rugby for Scotland and was part of Cecil Rhodes&#x27; Pioneer Column. His great grandfather was marine artist Captain Nicholas Pocock.

<doc id="1315169" wikidata="Q7048858" url="?curid=1315169" title="Non-broadcast multiple-access network">
<text>A non-broadcast multiple access network (NBMA) is a computer network to which multiple hosts are attached, but data is transmitted only directly from one computer to another single host over a virtual circuit or across a switched fabric.

== Examples of non broadcast technologies == 
* Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)
* Frame Relay
* X.25
* home power line networking
* Wireguard

== Replication broadcasts ==
Some NBMA network devices support multicast and broadcast traffic replication (pseudo-broadcasts).
This is done by send multiple copies of a broadcast packet, one through virtual circuit, so that the broadcast gets to all intended recipients.

== Power line networks ==
The ITU-T G.hn standard provides a specification for creating a high-speed (up to 1 Gigabit/s) local area network using existing home power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables.

Because of multipath propagation, power lines use frequency-selective channels. Channel frequency response is different for each pair of transmitter and receiver, so modulation parameters are unique for each transmitter and receiver pair. Since each pair of devices uses a different modulation scheme for communication, other devices may not be able to demodulate the information sent between them.

== Split horizon route advertisement ==
In NBMA networks a special technique called split horizon route advertisement must be disabled by distance-vector routing protocols in order to route traffic in a hub and spoke topology. The reason being is that split horizon dictates that a router cannot send a routing table update out of the same interface from which it received it. Thus eliminating the proper propagation from one location to another. This family of protocols relies on link layer broadcasting for route advertisement propagation, so when this feature is absent, it has to be emulated with a series of unicast transmissions, which may result in a receiver node sending a route advertisement back to the node it has just received it from.

In the early 19th century it was known for its farms, market gardens and orchards. Passengers and cargo travelled to the city by the launches and small ferries of the period.

In the mid 1960s it became the home of Auckland Prison, New Zealand&#x27;s main maximum security prison.

<doc id="1315212" wikidata="Q673321" url="?curid=1315212" title="Pacinian corpuscle">
<text>The Pacinian corpuscle (also lamellar corpuscle, or Vater-Pacini corpuscle) is a low-threshold mechanoreceptor responsive to vibration or pressure, found in the skin and other internal organs. In the skin it is one of the four main types of cutaneous receptors.

The corpuscles are present in skin notably on both surfaces of the hands and feet, arms, and neck. Pacinian corpuscles are also found on bone periosteum, joint capsules, the pancreas and other internal organs, the breast, genitals, and lymph nodes.

Pacinian corpuscles are rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors. As phasic receptors they respond quickly but briefly to a stimulus with the response diminishing even when the stimulus is maintained. They primarily respond to vibration, and deep pressure. They are especially sensitive to high-frequency vibrations. Groups of corpuscles sense pressure changes (such as on grasping or releasing an object). They are additionally crucially involved in proprioception. The vibrational role may be used for detecting surface texture, such as rough and smooth.

==Structure==
Pacinian corpuscles are larger and fewer in number than Meissner&#x27;s corpuscles, Merkel cells and Ruffini&#x27;s corpuscles. They may measure up to 2 mm in length, and nearly 1 mm in diameter. They are oval, spherical, or irregularly coiled in shape. Larger ones are visible to the naked eye. They have large receptive fields - as large as half of the palm. In the skin, the corpuscles are situated deep within the dermis.

=== Axon terminal ===
Each corpuscle is associated with a myelinated axon; these are some of the largest and fastest-conducting sensory axons arising from the skin.

Towards the center of the corpuscle, the axon loses its sheaths, ending as with a slight bulge at the center of the corpuscle. This axon terminal issues brief projections of unknown functional significance into gaps between the surrounding innermost lamellae; large mitochondria and small vessels aggregate near these projections.

=== Capsule ===
The capsule consists of 20-70 concentrically-arranged connective tissue lamellae around the axon terminal at its center, forming a structure much like an onion. The capsule consists of fibroblasts and fibrous connective tissue (mainly Type IV and Type II collagen network), separated by gelatinous material, more than 92% of which is water. It presents a whorled pattern on micrographs.

If the corpuscle&#x27;s capsule is experimentally removed, the divested axon terminal becomes slowly adapting. The capsule is therefore responsible for the corpuscle&#x27;s selectivity for low-frequency stimuli. This is a result of the slippery lamellae sliding past each other when the corpuscle is structurally deformed by external pressure so that effects of sustained pressure are soon dissipated by the lamellae, abolishing deformation of the central axon terminal itself. The capsule thus acts as a physiological high-pass filter.

==Function==

Pacinian corpuscles are rapidly adapting phasic receptors that detect gross pressure changes and vibrations in the skin. Pacinian corpuscles have a large receptive field on the skin&#x27;s surface with an especially sensitive center.

The corpuscles are especially sensitive to vibrations, which they can sense even centimeters away. Their optimal sensitivity is 250 Hz, and this is the frequency range generated upon fingertips by textures made of features smaller than 1 μm. Pacinian corpuscles respond when the skin is rapidly indented but not when the pressure is steady (due to the capsule). It is thought that they respond to high-velocity changes in joint position. They have also been implicated in detecting the location of touch sensations on handheld tools.

=== Sensory transduction ===
Pacinian corpuscles sense stimuli due to the deformation of their lamellae, which press on the membrane of the sensory neuron and causes it to bend or stretch. When the lamellae are deformed, due to either application or release of pressure, a generator or receptor potential is created as it physically deforms the plasma membrane of axon terminal, making it &quot;leak&quot; different cations through mechanosensitive channels which initiates the receptor potential. This initial receptor potential is potentiated by voltage-activated ion channels present in the inner-coreof the corpuscle. Finally, the receptor potential is modulated to neural spikes or action potential with the help of opening of sodium ion channels present at the first Ranvier&#x27;s Node of the axon.

Due to generation of receptor potential in the receptive area of the neurite (especially near the heminode or half-node of the axon) the potential at the first Ranvier&#x27;s node can reach certain threshold, triggering nerve impulses or action potentials at the first node of Ranvier. The first Ranvier&#x27;s node of the myelinated section of the neurite is often found inside the capsule. This impulse is then transferred along the axon from node to node with the use of sodium channels and sodium/potassium pumps in the axon membrane.

Once the receptive area of the neurite is depolarized, it will depolarize the first node of Ranvier; however, as it is a rapidly adapting fibre, this does not carry on indefinitely, and the signal propagation ceases. This is a graded response, meaning that the greater the deformation, the greater the generator potential. This information is encoded in the frequency of impulses, since a bigger or faster deformation induces a higher impulse frequency. Action potentials are formed when the skin is rapidly distorted but not when pressure is continuous because of the mechanical filtering of the stimulus in the lamellar structure. The frequencies of the impulses decrease quickly and soon stop due to the relaxation of the inner layers of connective tissue that cover the nerve ending.

=== Surface vibrations ===
The Pacinian corpuscles in elephant feet have been suggested to enable seismic communication. The Pacinian corpuscles in mice can detect taps on a branch 2.5 meters away.

== History ==
Pacinian corpuscles were the first cellular sensory receptor ever observed. They were first reported by German anatomist and botanist Abraham Vater and his student Johannes Gottlieb Lehmann in 1741, but ultimately named after Italian anatomist Filippo Pacini, who rediscovered them in 1835. John Shekleton, a curator of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, also discovered them before Pacini, but his results were published later. Similar to Pacinian corpuscles, Herbst corpuscles and Grandry corpuscles are found in bird species.

<doc id="1315218" wikidata="Q817157" url="?curid=1315218" title="Local Interstellar Cloud">
<text>The Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC), also known as the Local Fluff, is an interstellar cloud roughly across, through which the Solar System is moving. This feature overlaps with a region around the Sun referred to as the solar neighborhood. It is unknown whether the Sun is embedded in the Local Interstellar Cloud, or is in the region where the Local Interstellar Cloud is interacting with the neighboring G-Cloud. Like the G-Cloud and others, the LIC is part of the Very Local Interstellar Medium which begins where the heliosphere and interplanetary medium end, the furthest that probes have traveled.

==Structure==
The Solar System is located within a structure called the Local Bubble, a low-density region of the galactic interstellar medium. Within this region is the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC), an area of slightly higher hydrogen density. It is estimated that the Solar System entered the LIC within the past 10,000 years.
It is uncertain whether the Sun is still inside of the LIC or has already entered a transition zone between the LIC and the G cloud.
A recent analysis estimates the Sun will completely exit the LIC in no more than 1,900 years.

The cloud has a temperature of about , about the same temperature as the surface of the Sun. However, its specific heat capacity is very low because it is not very dense, with . This is less dense than the average for the interstellar medium in the Milky Way (), though six times denser than the gas in the hot, low-density Local Bubble () which surrounds the local cloud. In comparison, Earth&#x27;s atmosphere at the edge of space (i.e. 100 km above sea level) has around 1.2 molecules per cubic centimeter, dropping to around 50 million (5.0) at .

The cloud is flowing outwards from the Scorpius–Centaurus association, a stellar association that is a star-forming region, roughly perpendicular to the Sun&#x27;s own direction, if assumed to be two dimensional.

In 2019, researchers found interstellar iron-60 (60Fe) in Antarctica, which they relate to the Local Interstellar Cloud.

==Interaction with solar magnetic field==

In 2009, &quot;Voyager 2&quot; data suggested that the magnetic strength of the local interstellar medium was much stronger than expected (370 to 550 picoteslas (pT), against previous estimates of 180 to 250 pT). The fact that the Local Interstellar Cloud is strongly magnetized could explain its continued existence despite the pressures exerted upon it by the winds that blew out the Local Bubble.

The Local Interstellar Cloud&#x27;s potential effects on Earth are greatly diminished by the solar wind and the Sun&#x27;s magnetic field. This interaction with the heliosphere is under study by the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX), a NASA satellite mapping the boundary between the Solar System and interstellar space.

<text>A rail trail is a shared-use path on a railway right of way. Rail trails are typically constructed after a railway has been abandoned and the track has been removed but may also share the right of way with active railways, light rail, or streetcars (rails with trails), or with disused track. As shared-use paths, rail trails are primarily for non-motorized traffic including pedestrians, bicycles, horseback riders, skaters, and cross-country skiers, although snowmobiles and ATVs may be allowed. The characteristics of abandoned railways—gentle grades, well-engineered rights of way and structures (bridges and tunnels), and passage through historical areas—lend themselves to rail trails and account for their popularity. Many rail trails are long-distance trails, while some shorter rail trails are known as greenways or linear parks.

==Rail trails around the world==

===Americas===
====Bermuda====

The Bermuda Railway ceased to operate as such when the only carrier to exist in Bermuda folded in 1948. Some of the former right of way were converted for automobile traffic, and in 1984 18 miles were converted to a rail trail, reserved for pedestrian use and bicycles on paved portions. The rail bed spans the length of the island, and connected Hamilton to St. George&#x27;s and several villages, though several bridges are derelict, causing the trail to be fragmented.

====Canada====

The Kettle Valley Rail Trail in British Columbia uses a rail corridor that was originally built for the now-abandoned Kettle Valley Railway. The trail was developed during the 1990s after the Canadian Pacific Railway abandoned train service.

The longest rail trail in Canada is the Newfoundland T&#x27;Railway that covers a distance of . Protected as a linear park under the provincial park system, the T&#x27;Railway consists of the railbed of the historic Newfoundland Railway as transferred from its most recent owner, Canadian National Railway, to the provincial government after rail service was abandoned on the island of Newfoundland in 1988. The rail corridor stretches from Channel-Port aux Basques in the west to St. John&#x27;s in the east with branches to Stephenville, Lewisporte, Bonavista, Placentia and Carbonear.

Following the abandonment of the Prince Edward Island Railway in 1989, the government of Prince Edward Island purchased the right-of-way to the entire railway system. The Confederation Trail was developed as a tip-to-tip walking/cycling gravel rail trail which doubles as a monitored and groomed snowmobile trail during the winter months, operated by the PEI Snowmobile Association.

In Quebec, Le P&#x27;tit Train du Nord runs from Saint-Jérôme to Mont-Laurier.

In Toronto, there are two rail trails, the Beltline Trail and the West Toronto Railpath.

In central Ontario, the former Victoria Railway line, which runs from the town of Lindsay, Ontario, north to the village of Haliburton, in Haliburton County, serves as a public recreation trail. It can be used for cross country skiing, walking, and snowmobiling in the winter months, and walking, cycling, and horse riding from spring to autumn. The majority of the rail trail passes through sparsely populated areas of the Canadian Shield, with historic trestle bridges crossing several rivers. 
The old Sarnia Bridge in St. Marys, Ontario, was re-purposed as part of the Grand Trunk Trail. The former Grand Trunk Railway viaduct was purchased from Canadian National Railway in 1995. The Grand Trunk Trail was opened in 1998 with over of paved, accessible trail. In 2012, The re-purposing of the Sarnia Bridge was inducted into the North America Railway Hall of Fame.

A railroad between Gateway Road and Raleigh Street (i.e. streets immediately parallel to the railway on each side) in Winnipeg, Manitoba, was turned into a asphalt trail in 2007. It is called the Northeast Pioneers Greenway, and there are plans for expansion into East St. Paul, and eventually to Birds Hill Park.

In Nova Scotia, almost every section of the Trans Canada Trail and other walking trails are abandoned railways. A small railway line from Musquodoboit Harbour (Musquodoboit Trailway) to Dartmouth are nearly fully used by community members and tourists. Another extremely large section is used from Halifax to New Germany to Yarmouth to Grand Pre.

A considerable part of the Trans Canada Trail are repurposed defunct rail lines donated to provincial governments by CP and CN rail rebuilt as walking trails. The main section runs along the southern areas of Canada connecting most of Canada&#x27;s major cities and most populous areas. There is also a long northern arm which runs through Alberta to Edmonton and then up through northern British Columbia to Yukon. The trail is multi-use and depending on the section may allow hikers, bicyclists, horseback riders, cross country skiers and snowmobilers.

====United States====

In North America, the decades-long consolidation of the rail industry led to the closure of a number of uneconomical branch lines and redundant mainlines. Some were maintained as short line railways, but many others were abandoned. The first abandoned rail corridor in the United States converted into a recreational trail was the Elroy-Sparta State Trail in Wisconsin, which opened in 1967. The following year the Illinois Prairie Path opened. The conversion of rails to trails hastened with the federal government passing legislation promoting the use of railbanking for abandoned railroad corridors in 1983 which was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1990. This process preserves rail corridors for possible future rail use with interim use as a trail. By the 1970s, even main lines were being sold or abandoned. This was especially true when regional rail lines merged and streamlined their operations. As both the supply of potential trails increased and awareness of the possibilities rose, state governments, municipalities, conservation authorities, and private organizations bought the rail corridors to create, expand or link green spaces.

The longest developed rail trail is currently the Katy Trail in Missouri. When complete, the Cowboy Trail in Nebraska will become the second-longest, extending for , the longest being the Ohio to Erie Trail in Ohio at .

The BeltLine, in Atlanta, Georgia, is currently under construction. In 2030, its anticipated year of completion, it will be one of the longest continuous trails. The Atlanta BeltLine is a sustainable redevelopment project that will provide a network of public parks, multi-use trails and transit along a historic 22-mile railroad corridor circling downtown and connecting many neighborhoods directly to each other.

The Rails-to-Trails Conservancy is a nationwide nonprofit group that advocates for rail trails and has many documents and advice on building a rail trail. Per their records, the U.S. currently has 22,107 miles of rail trail complete. , Michigan has the most total mileage (2,381) of any state.
===Europe===
====Germany====
Germany has the largest number of rail trails in Europe, with 677 rail trails with a total length of (as at February 2015). 80 more projects are being planned or under construction. Some of the longest rail trails are in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. These are the Maare-Mosel-Radweg with on the old rail track, the Ruwer-Hochwald-Radweg with on the old rail track and the Schinderhannes-Radweg with on the old track of the Hunsrück Railway. Up to date, the 23 km long Nordbahntrasse in Wuppertal is still the rail trail with the highest standard in Germany and is a prime example of conversion of an abandoned railway track into a multiuser cycling path.

====United Kingdom====

With almost 150 lines in use, the United Kingdom has the second-largest network of rail trails in Europe after Germany. The development of rail trails in the United Kingdom grew after a major programme of railway line closures in the 1960s known as the Beeching cuts. The scheme, named after Dr. Richard Beeching, the then chairman of British Railways, decommissioned approximately of railway lines all over Great Britain. Many rural and suburban lines were closed along with selected main line trunk routes. Since then, approximately of disused railway lines in Britain have been converted to public leisure purposes, and today the majority of rail trails are maintained by either the local authority or charitable organisations such as Sustrans, the Railway Ramblers or Railway Paths. A section (between Braunton and Meeth) of the Tarka Trail in Devon is one of the longest of these. 

Many of these former railway lines form part of the British National Cycle Network, connecting with long-distance paths and towpaths along Britain&#x27;s extensive network of canals. For example, the Milton Keynes redway system runs throughout Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire, England, in parts using the former trackbed of the defunct Wolverton to Newport Pagnell Line (closed 1962) and the Grand Union Canal towpath. Together, these paths form part of the long-distance National Cycle Network Route 6 and Route 51. Other urban and suburban rail trails include the Fallowfield Loop Line in Manchester, the Middlewood Way in Cheshire and the Ebury Way in Watford. Notable rural rail trails include the Dava Way, running along the route of the former Highland Railway between Grantown and Forres in the Scottish Highlands, and the High Peak Trail in the English Peak District. In London, a more unusual scheme has been proposed to convert some disused London Underground tunnels into subterranean rail trails under the city, but this scheme has not been officially approved.
====Spain====
With more than 2,500 kilometers of rail trails (Via Verde) in a network of 117 cycling and walking itineraries, Spain ranks high in the European greenways scene. The trails are managed or coordinated by the Spanish Railways Foundation, an institution created in 1985. Many of the converted tracks were originally built for the mining industry, connecting remote mountain sites with port locations on the coast, now offering picturesque rides from wild interior landscapes to the seaside, following near-flat routes with long-spanning viaducts and bridges, plus a number of tunnels.

====Ireland====
Cuts to Ireland&#x27;s once expansive rail network in the mid 20th century left Ireland with a vast network of disused railways. While many lines were ripped up and the sections of the land acquired by private owners, a number of former railways do exist intact, thus providing the option for the development of many rail trails in the future.

The rail-trail on the former Westport to Achill Island line, known as the Great Western Greenway, was completed in 2011. Much progress has been made on the development of a rail-trail on the former Limerick to Tralee/Fenit line, in the form of the Great Southern Trail. As of 2013, a section from Rathkeale to Abbeyfeale has been completed.

Planning permission has been granted to redevelop the former Galway to Clifden railway into a greenway, but negotiations are still underway with landowners regarding its routing. A section of the Waterford, Limerick and Western Railway railway line, from Claremorris to Collooney has been touted for redevelopment as a greenway, but has met with some recent opposition from groups wishing for reestablishment of the railway itself.

====Belgium====
The RAVeL network in Belgium combines converted tracks, byways and towpaths, adding up to a total of , a significant figure considering the size of the country. The gradient is never more than six per cent, and the tracks are open to all forms of non-motorised travellers, including cyclists, horse-riders, hikers and even roller-bladers.

There is also the Vennbahn, which runs along an unusual border between Belgium and Germany.

====Finland====
Baana is an old cargo rail track in Helsinki converted into a pedestrian and bicycle trail.

===Oceania===
====Australia====
The development of rail trails in southeastern Australia can be traced to the gold rushes of the second half of the 19th century. Dozens of rail lines sprang up, aided by the overly enthusiastic &quot;Octopus Act&quot;, but soon became unprofitable as the gold ran out, leading to a decreased demand for timber in turn. Decades later, these easements found a new use as tourist drawcards, once converted to rail trails. Dozens exist in some form, like the Port Fairy to Warrnambool Rail Trail, but only a few – such as the Murray to the Mountains Rail Trail — have been fully developed. Progress is frequently hampered by trestle bridges in unsafe condition, easements that have been sold off to farmers, and lack of funds. Funding is typically contributed in roughly equal parts from federal, state, and local governments, with voluntary labour and in kind donations contributed by local groups.
The latest addition to the Rail Trail scene in Victoria is The Great Victorian Rail Trail which is the longest rail trail in Victoria covering . It has become popular with tourists as it meanders through steep valleys and open farm country. The Rail Trails Australia website is a good source of local information. about trails in Australia.

====New Zealand====

A number of rail trails have been established through New Zealand; the best known are the Hauraki Rail Trail (linking Thames, Paeroa, Te Aroha and Waikino/Waihi), Otago Central Rail Trail and the Little River Rail Trail. The New Zealand Cycle Trail project, a Government-led initiative, will greatly accelerate the establishment of new trails. The first seven projects (not all of them rail trails, though) were announced in July 2009 and will receive NZ$9 million in funding of the total project budget of NZ$50 million.

===Asia===
==== Singapore ====
On 24 May 2010, the Singapore and Malaysia governments agreed to move the Singapore terminus of the Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad (KTMB) from the Tanjong Pagar railway station in southern Singapore to Woodlands Train Checkpoint in northern Singapore. This resulted in the railway lines in Singapore becoming surplus as the Woodlands terminus is just over the border from Malaysia. Government agencies such as the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) have taken responsibility for developing and implementing ideas and activities for the former rail lands. The URA has a dedicated web site on Rail Corridor. An example of activities permitted include street art on a section of the disused railway, supported by the SLA, URA, Land Transport Authority and the National Arts Council.

The disused railway consists of the main line from the Tanjong Pagar railway station to Woodlands, extending either or , depending on the source. There is also the Jurong spur line, in length. The area occupied by the railways is at least , and up to when the land around the Tanjong Pagar Railway Station and other nodes are included. Given the location of the railway lands in land scarce Singapore, there was concern that the lands would be developed. Organisations such as the Nature Society Singapore developed comprehensive plans to maintain the rail lands for nature-related pursuits. The Green Corridor web site is a campaign website dedicated to preserving its natural form.

==Urban rail trail parks==
In a number of cities disused rail tracks have been converted into linear parks. One example is the High Line (also known as &quot;High Line Park&quot;), a elevated linear park created on an elevated section of a disused New York Central Railroad. Inspired by the (tree-lined walkway), a similar project in Paris completed in 1993, the High Line has been redesigned and planted as an aerial greenway and rails-to-trails park.

==Conversion issues==
Railroads in North America were often built with a mix of purchased land, government land grants, and easements. The land deeds can be over a hundred years old, land grants might be conditional upon continuous operation of the line, and easements may have expired, all expensive and difficult issues to determine at law.

Railroad property rights have often been poorly defined and sporadically enforced, with neighboring property owners intentionally or accidentally using land they do not own. Such encroachers often later oppose a rail to trail conversion. Even residents who are not encroaching on railway lands may oppose conversion on the grounds of increased traffic in the area and the possibility of a decline in personal security. Because linear corridors of land are only valuable if they are intact, special laws regulate the abandonment of a railroad corridor. In the United States, the Surface Transportation Board (STB) regulates railroads, and can allow a corridor to be &quot;Rail Banked&quot; or placed on hold for possible conversion back to active status when or if future need demands.

While many rail trails have been built, other proposals have been cancelled by community opposition. The stature of the conversion organization, community involvement, and government willingness are key factors.

On the other hand, there are a growing number of cases where existing rails and infrastructure, in service or not, are being called to be torn up for trails. Two cases of this are in New York State, against the Catskill Mountain Railroad in Kingston, New York, and the Adirondack Scenic Railroad in Old Forge, New York. In Connecticut, the not-in-service section of track on the Valley Railroad has been proposed by locals to be converted to trail. Though perceived by residents to be, as it has not carried a train since the 1960s, the railroad has never been formally abandoned. The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection acquired the line from Penn Central in 1969, and subsequently signed a long-term lease with the railroad. The railroad has been continually working to bring this section of the line back into service. Both Departments strongly support the preservation of the line, and have provided support to the railroad with property encroachment from abutters and the provision of railroad ties. All three of these examples are heritage railroads, which serve to protect the history of the railroad. Their primary revenue is tourist operations, so rail traffic is seasonal; though all three have been granted rights to carry freight, should customers show interest.
===Trails to rails===
Though rare, there are several cases in which trails convert back to active railroads. One example occurred in 2012 in Clarence, Pennsylvania, where the R.J. Corman Railroad Company received permission to rebuild of railbanked line to serve new industries. Conrail had ceased operating over the line in 1990, and was converted to the Snow Shoe Rails to Trails.

==Typical features==
Most original rail lines were surveyed for ease of transport and gentle (often less than 2%) grades. Therefore, the rail trails that succeeded them are often fairly straight and ideally suited to overcome steep or awkward terrain such as hills, escarpments, rivers, swamps, etc. Rail trails often share space with linear utilities such as pipelines, electrical transmission wires, and telephone lines.


Most purchase of railway land is dictated by the free market value of the land, so that land in urban and industrial cores is often impractical to purchase and convert. Therefore, rail trails may end on the fringes of urban areas or near industrial areas and resume later, as discontinuous portions of the same rail line, separated by unaffordable or inappropriate land.

A railroad right-of-way (easement) width varies based on the terrain, with a width being ample enough where little surface grading is required. The initial stretch of the Illinois Central Railroad is the most liberal in the world with a width of along the whole length of the line. Rail trails are often graded and covered in gravel or crushed stone, although some are paved with asphalt and others are left as dirt. Where rail bridges are incorporated into the trail, the only alterations (if any) tend to be adding solid walking areas on top of ties or trestles, though bridges in poorer condition do receive new guardrails, paint, and reinforcement. If paved, they are especially suitable for people who use wheelchairs.

Where applicable, the same trails used in the summer for walking, jogging, and inline skating can be used in the winter for Nordic skiing, snowshoeing, and sometimes snowmobiling.

==Rails with trails==
Rails with trails are a small subset of rail trails in which a railway right-of-way remains in use by trains yet also has a parallel recreational trail. Hundreds of kilometers of rails with trails exist in Canada, Europe, the United States, Australia, and the United Arab Emirates.

<text>USS &quot;Howorth&quot; (DD-592) was a built for the United States Navy during World War II.

==Namesake==
William L. Howorth was born on 16 July 1841 in Massachusetts. He was appointed Acting Master&#x27;s Mate on 29 April 1863. Attached to &quot;Monticello&quot;, a blockader off North Carolina, he accompanied Lieutenant William B. Cushing on a reconnaissance up the Cape Fear River to Wilmington, North Carolina 23–24 June 1864, gaining valuable information about Confederate defenses. Later in the year, he joined Cushing&#x27;s expedition up the Roanoke River to sink Confederate ram . The ram was destroyed 27 October, but the launch carrying the Union sailors was destroyed. Cushing and one other man escaped, while Howorth and others were captured. In his report Cushing noted: &quot;Acting Master&#x27;s Mate William L. Howorth, of the Monticello, showed, as usual conspicuous bravery.&quot; He was promoted to Acting Master and exchanged in February 1865. Honorably discharged in October, he reentered the Navy in 1866 and was appointed Ensign on 12 March 1868. He resigned from the Navy on 4 April 1869.

==Construction and commissioning==
She was laid down on 26 November 1941, launched on 10 January 1943, and commissioned on 3 April 1944 at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington. She was the 161st ship of her class.

==World War II service==
After a shakedown cruise, &quot;Howorth&quot; was assigned to Destroyer Squadron 21 (DesRon 21). The flotilla set sail on 22 July 1944, as part of the escort for a convoy carrying Marines to Pearl Harbor. The convoy arrived after seven days at sea, and &quot;Howorth&quot; remained in Hawaii until 25 August, at which point she sailed for Hollandia, along with the ammunition ship . &quot;Howorth&quot; was assigned to Destroyer Division 41 (DesDiv 41), of the 7th Fleet. Her first combat experience was in the Solomon Islands on anti-submarine and escort duty.

===The Philippines===
&quot;Howorth&quot; arrived off Leyte on 22 October, three days after the initial landings began. She guarded the transport anchorages during the Battle of Leyte Gulf, and did not see direct action during the battle. &quot;Howorth&quot; made several convoy trips to Kossol Roads, Guam, and Manus, before returning to the Philippines for the battle at Ormoc on 7 December 1944. &quot;Howorth&quot; also participated in the Battle of Mindoro, during which she was attacked by several kamikazes, one of which slightly damaged &quot;Howorth&quot;″s mast before the plane crashed into the sea.

On 9 January 1945, the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf began. &quot;Howorth&quot; arrived with the first reinforcement group four days later on the 13th, which came under kamikaze attacks while en route. &quot;Howorth&quot; provided fire support to the invasion forces, provided anti-aircraft support for the invasion fleet, and patrolled the flanks of the fleet.

===Iwo Jima===

&quot;Howorth&quot; also took part in the invasion of Iwo Jima, arriving on 19 February. &quot;Howorth&quot; again provided fire support and anti-aircraft protection during the invasion and subsequent fighting on Iwo Jima. On 14 March, &quot;Howorth&quot; departed Iwo Jima for a short rest at Ulithi.

===Okinawa===
&quot;Howorth&quot; was assigned to screen a convoy from Ulithi bound for Okinawa, arriving on 1 April. After arrival at Okinawa, she again provided fire support and anti-aircraft defense. On her first day off Okinawa, &quot;Howorth&quot; was moving to her station with the cruiser and destroyer , when she was attacked by eight kamikazes. One made it through the ships&#x27; anti-aircraft fire and struck &quot;Howorth&quot; in her superstructure, killing seven men and causing a fire that was quickly put out.

Following the damage sustained at Okinawa, &quot;Howorth&quot; returned to the United States for repairs. She arrived at Mare Island Naval Shipyard in California on 2 May 1945. Repairs were completed by early July, and after a brief shakedown cruise in July, she set sail for Pearl Harbor on 15 July. The ship was en route to Adak, Alaska on 15 August, when the news of the Japanese surrender reached the ship.

===Post-war===

&quot;Howorth&quot; arrived in Yokohama, Japan on 17 September, where she escorted convoys back from Japan. Her final trip from Japan was on 11 November, and arrived in San Francisco on the 28th of that month. The ship was decommissioned on 30 April 1946, and was placed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet. She remained in reserve until 8 March 1962 when she was sunk in the Pacific Ocean off San Clemente Island, California, as a torpedo target by the submarines and .

==Honors and awards==
&quot;Howorth&quot; received five battle stars for her service during World War II.

<text>The U.S. state of Washington has over of state highways maintained by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT). The highway system is defined through acts by the state legislature and is encoded in the Revised Code of Washington as State Routes (SR). It was created in 1964 to replace an earlier numbering scheme and ratified by the state legislature in 1970. The system&#x27;s 196 highways are almost entirely paved, with the exception of a gravel section on SR 165.

The state&#x27;s Interstate and U.S. Highways are also defined as part of the state route system, but are omitted from this list.

<text>The Stories of Vladimir Nabokov (in some British editions, The Collected Stories) is a posthumous collection of every known short story that Vladimir Nabokov ever wrote, with the exception of &quot;The Enchanter&quot;. In the current printing of this work, sixteen stories not previously published in English are translated by the author&#x27;s son, Dmitri Nabokov. The collection was first published in America by Alfred A. Knopf in 1995.

As initially published, the collection included 65 stories. Nabokov&#x27;s first collection of short stories, Nabokov&#x27;s Dozen, contained thirteen total stories, which made for the structure of all of his subsequent collections, four in his lifetime. In the introduction to the collection, Dmitri Nabokov explains that the newly translated stories were to be his father&#x27;s final collection. The stories are presented in as close to chronological order as they were able to piece together.

Three additional stories were discovered and translated after the first printing of this collection. They were incorporated in later printings of the U.S. paperback edition and in later printings of the hardback and paperback British editions of this work. The eighth part of the story &quot;The Potato Elf&quot; was accidentally omitted from the first five printings of the hardcover edition of this book.

<doc id="1315245" wikidata="Q7982868" url="?curid=1315245" title="Wenham Lake Ice Company">
<text>The Wenham Lake Ice Company, operating out of Wenham Lake in Wenham, Massachusetts, United States, harvested ice and exported it all around the world before the advent of factory-made ice. Wenham-lake ice was awarded a royal warrant from Queen Victoria.

==History==

The company was founded by Charles B. Lander and Henry T. Ropes.

In 1842-43, Charles Lander launched the construction of several ice houses around the Wenham Lake. According to Michael Faraday, the water of Wenham Lake was so pure from salts and air bubbles that it could withstand higher temperature than regular ice without melting. In November 1843, the town of Wenham granted Charles Lander the right to build a small network of railroads between the ice houses. In March 1844, Lander bought Peter&#x27;s Hill for $75 and could plan the expansion of its ice-house operations. However, Lander was facing financial shortages and sold part of the company to George Wheatland and Judge Joshua H. Ward
At the end of the 1840s, the ice from Wenham Lake became a luxurious commodity in London. The company opened offices all over Great Britain and Ireland. In large institutions for poor sick people, wrote Florence Nightingale (1859), Wenham Lake ice stopped the milk curdling in summer. By 1888 &quot;Mrs Beeton&quot; printed a cocktail recipe that used Lake Wenham ice; some Victorian households had iceboxes cooled with it. In 1866, Massey &amp; Son&#x27;s Biscuit, Ice &amp; Compote Book; Or, The Essence of Modern Confectionery advised wealthy entertainers to &quot;send a block of Wenham Lake ice to the turners to be turned into the form of an elegant vase&quot; to make an &quot;elegant and novel stand.&quot;

==Advertising==
The company opened a storefront at 125 in the Strand, London in the summer 1844. Every day, workers would put a large block of ice in the window, and none of the typical neighborhood residents had ever seen a block of ice anywhere before. As a gimmick, the workers would put a newspaper on the other side of the block of ice so that passers-by could read the print through the ice, from outside the store looking into the window.

The Ice Company advertised its product as &quot;suited for table use, for mixing with liquids, or placing in direct contact with provisions, jellies, etc.&quot;

<doc id="1315248" wikidata="Q83540" url="?curid=1315248" title="Full-text search">
<text>In text retrieval, full-text search refers to techniques for searching a single computer-stored document or a collection in a full-text database. Full-text search is distinguished from searches based on metadata or on parts of the original texts represented in databases (such as titles, abstracts, selected sections, or bibliographical references).

In a full-text search, a search engine examines all of the words in every stored document as it tries to match search criteria (for example, text specified by a user). Full-text-searching techniques appeared in the 1960s, for example IBM STAIRS from 1969, and became common in online bibliographic databases in the 1990s. Many websites and application programs (such as word processing software) provide full-text-search capabilities. Some web search engines, such as the former AltaVista, employ full-text-search techniques, while others index only a portion of the web pages examined by their indexing systems.

==Indexing==
When dealing with a small number of documents, it is possible for the full-text-search engine to directly scan the contents of the documents with each query, a strategy called &quot;serial scanning&quot;. This is what some tools, such as grep, do when searching.

However, when the number of documents to search is potentially large, or the quantity of search queries to perform is substantial, the problem of full-text search is often divided into two tasks: indexing and searching. The indexing stage will scan the text of all the documents and build a list of search terms (often called an index, but more correctly named a concordance). In the search stage, when performing a specific query, only the index is referenced, rather than the text of the original documents.

The indexer will make an entry in the index for each term or word found in a document, and possibly note its relative position within the document. Usually the indexer will ignore stop words (such as &quot;the&quot; and &quot;and&quot;) that are both common and insufficiently meaningful to be useful in searching. Some indexers also employ language-specific stemming on the words being indexed. For example, the words &quot;drives&quot;, &quot;drove&quot;, and &quot;driven&quot; will be recorded in the index under the single concept word &quot;drive&quot;.

==The precision vs. recall tradeoff==

Recall measures the quantity of relevant results returned by a search, while precision is the measure of the quality of the results returned. Recall is the ratio of relevant results returned to all relevant results. Precision is the ratio of the number of relevant results returned to the total number of results returned.

The diagram at right represents a low-precision, low-recall search. In the diagram the red and green dots represent the total population of potential search results for a given search. Red dots represent irrelevant results, and green dots represent relevant results. Relevancy is indicated by the proximity of search results to the center of the inner circle. Of all possible results shown, those that were actually returned by the search are shown on a light-blue background. In the example only 1 relevant result of 3 possible relevant results was returned, so the recall is a very low ratio of 1/3, or 33%. The precision for the example is a very low 1/4, or 25%, since only 1 of the 4 results returned was relevant.

Due to the ambiguities of natural language, full-text-search systems typically includes options like filtering to increase precision and stemming to increase recall. Controlled-vocabulary searching also helps alleviate low-precision issues by tagging documents in such a way that ambiguities are eliminated. The trade-off between precision and recall is simple: an increase in precision can lower overall recall, while an increase in recall lowers precision.

==False-positive problem==

Full-text searching is likely to retrieve many documents that are not relevant to the &quot;intended&quot; search question. Such documents are called &quot;false positives&quot; (see Type I error). The retrieval of irrelevant documents is often caused by the inherent ambiguity of natural language. In the sample diagram to the right, false positives are represented by the irrelevant results (red dots) that were returned by the search (on a light-blue background).

Clustering techniques based on Bayesian algorithms can help reduce false positives. For a search term of &quot;bank&quot;, clustering can be used to categorize the document/data universe into &quot;financial institution&quot;, &quot;place to sit&quot;, &quot;place to store&quot; etc. Depending on the occurrences of words relevant to the categories, search terms or a search result can be placed in one or more of the categories. This technique is being extensively deployed in the e-discovery domain.

==Performance improvements==

The deficiencies of full text searching have been addressed in two ways: By providing users with tools that enable them to express their search questions more precisely, and by developing new search algorithms that improve retrieval precision.

===Improved querying tools===

*Keywords. Document creators (or trained indexers) are asked to supply a list of words that describe the subject of the text, including synonyms of words that describe this subject. Keywords improve recall, particularly if the keyword list includes a search word that is not in the document text.
* Field-restricted search. Some search engines enable users to limit full text searches to a particular field within a stored data record, such as &quot;Title&quot; or &quot;Author.&quot;
* . Searches that use Boolean operators (for example, ) can dramatically increase the precision of a full text search. The operator says, in effect, &quot;Do not retrieve any document unless it contains both of these terms.&quot; The operator says, in effect, &quot;Do not retrieve any document that contains this word.&quot; If the retrieval list retrieves too few documents, the operator can be used to increase recall; consider, for example, . This search will retrieve documents about online encyclopedias that use the term &quot;Internet&quot; instead of &quot;online.&quot; This increase in precision is very commonly counter-productive since it usually comes with a dramatic loss of recall.
* Phrase search. A phrase search matches only those documents that contain a specified phrase, such as 
* Concept search. A search that is based on multi-word concepts, for example Compound term processing. This type of search is becoming popular in many e-discovery solutions.
* Concordance search. A concordance search produces an alphabetical list of all principal words that occur in a text with their immediate context.
* Proximity search. A phrase search matches only those documents that contain two or more words that are separated by a specified number of words; a search for would retrieve only those documents in which the words occur within two words of each other.
* Regular expression. A regular expression employs a complex but powerful querying syntax that can be used to specify retrieval conditions with precision.
* Fuzzy search will search for document that match the given terms and some variation around them (using for instance edit distance to threshold the multiple variation)
* Wildcard search. A search that substitutes one or more characters in a search query for a wildcard character such as an asterisk. For example, using the asterisk in a search query will find &quot;sin&quot;, &quot;son&quot;, &quot;sun&quot;, etc. in a text.

<doc id="1315270" wikidata="Q7980592" url="?curid=1315270" title="Welcome (Taproot album)">
<text>Welcome is the second major label album by American alternative metal band Taproot. It was released on October 15, 2002. &quot;Poem&quot; served as the album&#x27;s lead single and reached No. 5 on the Mainstream Rock chart, propelling the group to mainstream success. A follow-up single, &quot;Mine,&quot; was released and its video was directed by System of a Down bassist Shavo Odadjian. A third single and video was announced for &quot;Art,&quot; but curiously Atlantic pulled the plug soon after the announcement, further irking fans who claimed the label was holding Taproot back. &quot;Welcome&quot; remains Taproot&#x27;s most successful record, selling over 475,000 copies.

The band performed on the second part of Disturbed&#x27;s Music as a Weapon Tour in promotion of the album.

==Production==
During a break in their intense touring schedule in support of their debut album, &quot;Gift&quot;, Taproot went to Los Angeles to record several demos with Toby Wright. Those tracks were &quot;Poem to Self&quot;, &quot;Remain&quot;, &quot;Get Me&quot;, &quot;When&quot;, and &quot;Transparent&quot;. Bolstered by their new recordings, the band featured &quot;Poem to Self&quot;, &quot;Transparent&quot;, and &quot;Get Me&quot; on tour during 2001, with &quot;Poem to Self&quot; soon becoming one of their most popular songs.

During the early development of &quot;Welcome&quot;, Taproot had given producer Toby Wright roughly 40 complete songs. Wright said that while they were good, the songs were not up to the band&#x27;s potential, and he forced them to start from scratch. Several earlier tracks were reworked for the album, while the bulk of the material was discarded. Some of the demos include &quot;Can&#x27;t Believe&quot;, &quot;Poem to Self&quot;, &quot;Sumtimes&quot;, &quot;Remain&quot;, &quot;Strive&quot;, &quot;Free&quot;, &quot;Fort&quot;, &quot;Like&quot;, &quot;Promise&quot;, &quot;When&quot;, &quot;Transparent&quot;, &quot;Contradiction&quot;, &quot;Keep Your Head Up&quot;, &quot;Not a Quitter&quot;, &quot;Fault&quot;, &quot;Get Me&quot;, &quot;Can You&quot;, &quot;Indecisive&quot;, &quot;Myself&quot;, and &quot;Dreams&quot;. This was initially met with resentment from the band, but they ultimately wrote entirely new songs that they felt show greater maturity. One of the most prominent songs to survive the fresh batch was &quot;Poem,&quot; which had seen prior success after being debuted by the band during concerts, such as Ozzfest 2001, and went on to be arguably Taproot&#x27;s most well known single. Other songs that were refined with Toby Wright from earlier demos include &quot;When&quot;, &quot;Fault&quot;, &quot;Sumtimes&quot;, and &quot;Like&quot;. As with many Toby Wright productions, songs throughout &quot;Welcome&quot; are heavy on multi-tracked vocals and layered guitars.

While many of their early demos were not recorded for this effort, Taproot did re-record &quot;Remain&quot;, &quot;Transparent&quot;, and &quot;Free&quot; with Toby Wright. Some of these tracks were included on foreign releases of the album as a bonus track as well as the Poem single, and were later posted to the band&#x27;s official MySpace page. &quot;Remain&quot;, however, would remain unreleased until it was included in the band&#x27;s 2018 boxset &quot;Besides&quot;.

==Reception==

Critical response to &quot;Welcome&quot; was largely mixed. Various prominent media critics considered the album too mediocre to stand out among current alternative metal and nu metal acts. However, melodic improvements from Taproot&#x27;s prior effort were also cited. AllMusic&#x27;s Brian O&#x27;Neill also compared the band&#x27;s stylistic &quot;idolatry&quot; as a shift from Korn to Alice in Chains. Robert Cherry of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; cited the &quot;me, me, me&quot; lyrics as evidence of needed maturity but added that &quot;Welcome&quot; &quot;marks a self-preserving transition from new metal to art metal.&quot; The publication also cited Taproot as one of the &quot;Bands to Watch in 2002.&quot; &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; described the album as musically being a combination of Korn and Alice in Chains, and they also stated that Stephen Richards &quot;wears vocal inspirations of Mike Patton and Brandon Boyd proudly on his sleeve, reaching high pitches that often toe the line between passionate and whiny.&quot;

==Track listing==
According to the lyric booklet, there are also alternative titles to some of these tracks

The band also recorded three additional songs during the &quot;Welcome&quot; sessions. Two of them, &quot;Transparent&quot; (4:23) and &quot;Free&quot; (3:23), can both be found on the &quot;Poem&quot; CD single as B-sides and on the Japanese pressing of &quot;Welcome&quot; as bonus tracks. The lyrics to &quot;Free&quot; can still be found in the lyric booklet of &quot;Welcome&quot; The third track, &quot;Remain&quot;, would be released with the other two on the 2018 box set &quot;Besides&quot;.

<text>Dhundiraj Govind Phalke (Pronunciation: ), popularly known as Dadasaheb Phalke (30 April 1870 – 16 February 1944), was an Indian producer-director-screenwriter, known as &quot;the Father of Indian cinema&quot;. 

His debut film, &quot;Raja Harishchandra&quot;, was the first Indian movie released in 1913, and is now known as India&#x27;s first full-length mythological feature film. He made 94 feature-length films and 27 short films in his career, spanning 19 years until 1937, including his most noted works: &quot;Mohini Bhasmasur&quot; (1913), &quot;Satyavan Savitri&quot; (1914), &quot;Lanka Dahan&quot; (1917), &quot;Shri Krishna Janma&quot; (1918) and &quot;Kaliya Mardan&quot; (1919). In his honor, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award was instituted as highest honorary award under the National Film Awards by the Government of India.

==Early life and education==
Dhundiraj Phalke was born on 30 April 1870 at Trimbak, Bombay Presidency into a Marathi-speaking Chitpavan Brahmin family. His father, Govind Sadashiv Phalke alias Dajishastri, was a Sanskrit scholar and worked as a Hindu priest conducting religious ceremonies and his mother, Dwarkabai, was a housewife. The couple had seven children, three sons and four daughters. Shivrampant, the eldest, was twelve years older than Phalke and worked in Baroda. He briefly worked as the &quot;Dewan&quot; (Chief Administrator) of the princely state of Jawhar and died in 1921, at the age of 63. Phalke&#x27;s second brother Raghunathrao, also worked as a priest and died at a young age of 21. Dajishastri taught Phalke to conduct religious rituals like yajna and dispensing of medicines. When he was appointed as a professor of Sanskrit in the Wilson College, Bombay, the family shifted its base to Bombay. Phalke completed his primary education in Trimbakeshwar and matriculation was done in Bombay.

Phalke joined the Sir J. J. School of Art, Bombay in 1885 and completed a one-year course in drawing. At the beginning of 1886, he accompanied his elder brother, Shivrampant, to Baroda where he married a girl from Marathe family. Later, he joined Kala Bhavan, the Faculty of Fine Arts, at the Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda and completed a course in Oil painting and Watercolor painting in 1890. He also achieved proficiency in architecture and modelling. In the same year, Phalke bought a film camera and started experimenting with photography, processing, and printing. He was awarded a gold medal for creating a model of an ideal theatre at the 1892 Industrial Exhibition of Ahmedabad. While his work was much appreciated, one of his fans presented him a &quot;costly&quot; camera, used for still photography. In 1891, Phalke did a six-months course to learn the techniques of preparing half-tone blocks, photo-lithio, and three-colour ceramic photography. Principal Gajjar of Kala Bhavan sent Phalke to Ratlam to learn three-colour blockmaking, photolitho transfers, colotype and darkroom printing techniques under the guidance of Babulal Varuvalkar.

==Career==
===1893–1911: Early career===
In 1893, Gajjar allowed Phalke to use the photo studio and laboratory of Kala Bhavan where he started his work under the name of &quot;Shri Phalke&#x27;s Engraving and Photo Printing&quot;. Despite his proficiency in various skills, he did not have a stable family life and had difficulties in making a living. Thus, in 1895, he decided to become a professional photographer and relocated to Godhra for doing business. He was given free studio space to start his still photo studio by the prominent Desai family for whom he also shot their family photo albums. He lost his wife and a child in the 1900 plague epidemic and decided to move 
to a different city. Phalke returned to Baroda and started photography business. It did not run well because of the myth spread across the city that the camera sucks up the energy from a person&#x27;s body which leads to their death. He faced similar resistance from the Prince of Baroda who refused to take photographs with the assumptions that it would shorten his life. Though, the Prince was later convinced by Phalke who went on to advocate the benefits of photography in his court, it did not help Phalke&#x27;s business. He started the business of painting the stage curtains for the drama companies. This got him some basic training in drama production and fetched him a few minor roles in the plays.

Phalke learned magic tricks from a German magician who was on a tour in Baroda that time. This helped him use trick photography in his filmmaking. At the end of 1901, Phalke began to hold the public performances of magic using professional name of Professor Kelpha with letters of his last name in reverse order. In 1902, Phalke remarried to Girija Karandikar, niece of proprietor of Kirloskar Natak Mandali. Girija was renamed as Saraswati after the marriage. In 1903, he got a job as a photographer and draftsman at the Archaeological Survey of India. However, not satisfied with the job, Phalke resigned in 1906 and set up a printing press at Lonavla under the name of &quot;Phalke Engraving and Printing Works&quot; with R. G. Bhandarkar as a partner.

The press majorly worked for making photo-litho transfers for Ravi Verma Press, owned by painter Raja Ravi Varma. Later, it also started the work of halftone blockmaking and printing and tri-colour printing. With the growing business, the press was shifted to Dadar, Bombay. Later in 1908, Purushottam Mavji replaced Bhandarkar as a partner and the press was renamed as &quot;Laxmi Art Printing Works&quot;. Phalke went to Germany in 1909 to buy the necessary colour printing machinery. Though the printing business grew exponentially, the partners had increasing differences about the running of the press. Soon, Phalke decided to abandon the partnership, without availing any monetary benefits.

===1911–1917: Filmmaking struggle, debut, and success===
====Initial obstacles and London visit====
After quitting &quot;Laxmi Art Printing Works&quot;, Phalke received multiple offers from various financiers to start another printing press but he did not accept any offers. On 14 April 1911, Phalke with his elder son Bhalchandra went to see a film, &quot;Amazing Animals&quot;, at the America India Picture Palace, Girgaon, Bombay. Surprised at seeing animals on the screen, Bhalchandra informed his mother, Saraswatibai, about his experience earlier that day. None of the family members believed them, so Phalke took his family to see the film the next day. As it was Easter, the theatre screened a film about Jesus, &quot;The Life of Christ&quot; (1906) by the French director Alice Guy-Blaché instead. While watching Jesus on the screen, Phalke envisioned Hindu deities Rama and Krishna instead and decided to start in the business of &quot;moving pictures&quot;.

For the next one year, Phalke started collecting various film related material like catalogues, books, and movie making equipment from Europe. He bought a small film camera and reels and started showing movies at night, by focusing candle light on a lens and projecting the pictures on the wall. He watched movies every evening for four to five hours and was deprived of sleep. This put strain on his eyes and he developed cataract in both eyes. He continued working against the advice of taking rest and lost his sight completely. Ophthalmologist Dr. Prabhakar treated Phalke with the aid of three or four pairs of spectacles which helped him restore the eye sight. Phalke wished to go to London to get technical knowledge of filmmaking but had difficulties getting finances for his trip. With the help of Yashwantrao Nadkarni and Abasaheb Chitnis, he secured a sum of ten thousands by mortgaging his insurance policies worth twelve thousands. On 1 February 1912, he boarded a ship for London.

At London, Phalke saw a nameboard of &quot;Bioscope Cine-Weekly&quot; near Piccadilly Circus. He was a subscriber of the weekly in India. He met its editor, Mr. Cabourn, and explained the purpose of his visit. Cabourn advised Phalke against the idea of filmmaking in India based on the unsuccessful attempts in England and suggested that the Indian climate might not be suitable as well. However, he was impressed with Phalke&#x27;s dedication and introduced him to the film director, producer, and screenwriter Cecil Hepworth of Walton Studios. Hepworth allowed Phalke to visit all the departments of the studio and their workings along with the demonstration of filming. At the advice of Cabourn and Hepworth, he bought Williamson camera for fifty pounds and placed an order for Kodak raw film and a perforator. Phalke stayed in London for two months and returned to India on 1 April 1912. He founded the &quot;Phalke Films Company&quot; on the same day.

====Film debut with &quot;Raja Harishchandra&quot;====
After coming back from London, Phalke started looking for a spacious place for shooting the films. Soon, the family shifted from Ismail Building, Charni Road to Mathura Bhavan Bungalow, Dadar. He constructed a small glass room at the compound of the bungalow and prepared a dark room and arrangements for processing the film. Imported filmmaking equipment reached Bombay in May 1912 and Phalke set it up within four days with the help of sketch provided. He also taught his family to perforate and develop the film. To test the working of camera and projector, Phalke filmed the boys and girls in the surroundings to the satisfactory results. To demonstrate the filmmaking techniques and get financier for the feature film, Phalke decided to make a short film. He planted some peas in a pot and placed a camera in front of it. He shot one frame a day for over a month producing a film just over one minute, of the seed growing, sprouting, and changing into a climber. The short film titled &quot;Ankurachi Wadh&quot; (&quot;Growth of a Pea Plant&quot;) and showed selective individuals. Some of them, including Yashwantrao Nadkarni and Narayanrao Devhare, offered Phalke a loan.

Phalke decided to make a film based on the legends of Harishchandra and wrote the script for it. He published advertisements in various newspapers like &quot;Induprakash&quot; calling for the cast and crew required for the film. As no women were available to play female leads, male actors performed the female roles. Dattatraya Damodar Dabke played the lead role of King Harishchandra and Anna Salunke as Queen Taramati. Phalke&#x27;s elder son Bhalchandra was assigned the role, Rohidas, son of Harishchandra and Taramati. Phalke was in-charge of the scriptment, direction, production design, make-up, editing, and film processing and Trymbak B. Telang handled the camera. The filming was completed in six months and 27 days producing a film of , about four reels.

The film premiered at the Olympia Theatre, Bombay on 21 April 1913, and had its theatrical release on Saturday, 3 May 1913 at the Coronation Cinema, Girgaon, Bombay. It was a commercial success and laid the foundation for the film industry in the country. The film is often considered the first full-length Indian feature film with its status debated with historians considering Dadasaheb Torne&#x27;s silent film &quot;Shree Pundalik&quot;, released on 18 May 1912, the maiden Indian film. The Government of India recognises &quot;Raja Harischandra&quot; as the first Indian feature film.

After the success of &quot;Raja Harishchandra&quot;, Phalke relocated to Nashik. For his next film, he selected the mythological love story of Nala, a king of Nishadha Kingdom, and Damayanti, a princess of the Vidarbha Kingdom. In spite of completing the pre-production, the filming could not start so he started working on &quot;Mohini Bhasmasur&quot;, based on a mythological story of Mohini, female avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu, and Bhasmasura, an asura (demon). During the same time, a travelling drama company, &quot;Chittakarshak Natak Company&quot;, visited Nashik. Phalke requested its proprietor, Raghunathrao Gokhle, to allow two of their actresses to act in the film. Durgabai Kamat was cast as Parvati and her daughter Kamlabai Gokhale as Mohini and became first women to act in the Indian cinema. The film was long and was released on 2 January 1914 at the Olympia Theatre, Bombay. A short comedy film &quot;Pithache Panje&quot; (&quot;Paws of Flour&quot;) was released as a &quot;side attraction&quot; with the film. Phalke made his third film &quot;Satyavan Savitri&quot; based on the legends of Satyavan and Savitri. The film was long and was screened on 6 June 1914. Both the films were commercially successful like &quot;Raja Harishchandra&quot;.

====Second London visit, debt, and success with &quot;Lanka Dahan&quot;====
With the success of three films, Phalke was able to repay all his debts. There was huge demand for the film copies from various theater managers in the country. Considering the tremendous response to the films, he decided to buy electronic machinery worth around and left for London on 1 August 1914, taking with him his three films. Mr. Kepburn of &quot;Bioscope Cine-Weekly&quot;, who had helped Phalke during his first London visit, arranged some screenings of the films in London. The films were praised for their technical aspects. Various producers including Cecil Hepworth of Walton Studios requested Phalke to produce films in England. Hepworth placed an offer before Phalke to produce Indian films in England, bringing cast and crew from India whose expenses on travel, lodging and boarding, and salary would be paid by Hepworth. Phalke was offered a monthly salary of 300 pounds along with 20% of the profits. Phalke declined the offer and explained Hepworth that he would continue making films in India. Warner Brothers also offered to buy 200 film copies to which Phalke agreed. However, before the official agreements were to be signed, Phalke had to come back to India after the news about the worrisome condition of his studio.

On returning to India, Phalke noticed that the financial condition had worsened due to ongoing World War I. His investor had stopped advancing the capital and asked to shut down the studio. He approached Yashwantrao Nadkarni and Abasaheb Chitnis for the loan to bring the equipment bought in London. They offered to pay half of the amount on short term basic. With the ongoing World War, Phalke also faced the scarcity of the raw films and decided to make a few short films. He received a loan on the security of studio and started working on &quot;Raja Shreeyal&quot;. Though filming started, it could not be completed due to various reasons. To get capital for his next film, Phalke approached the leaders of the Swadeshi movement without any luck. He also published an advertisement in the newspapers and distributed handbills, appealing for the help assuring the repayment with interest. However, only three people responded to the advertisement. One of them published a letter in the newspaper, &quot;Dainik Sandesh&quot;, appealing to the leaders of the Indian Home Rule movement who wanted Phalke to join the movement before any loan could be granted. Indian nationalist Bal Gangadhar Tilak tried helping Phalke through Paisa Fund Glass Works but could not succeed. During 1916, Phalke undertook a tour to raise the capital. He screened his films at the princely states of Aundh, Gwalior, Indore, Jamkhandi, and Miraj. The King of Aundh granted and the Princess of Indore provided a loan of and as a payment of his shows.

While relocating from Bombay to Nashik, the negative film of &quot;Raja Harishchandra&quot; was lost, so Phalke filmed it again with &quot;almost the same script, cast and all other things&quot; and released it as &quot;Satyavadi Raja Harishchandra&quot;, a long film which was screened on 3 April 1917 at Aryan Cinema, Poona. He also made a documentary &quot;How Movies Are Made&quot; to demonstrate the filmmaking process to the financiers but it did not help. Phalke was invited for the session of the &quot;Bombay Provincial Congress Parishad&quot; held at Nashik in May 1917 where Lokmanya Tilak made an appeal to help him and also visited his studio at the request of G. S. Khaparde.

The appeal made by Tilak had desired effect and Phalke could collect sufficient capital to start a new film, &quot;Lanka Dahan&quot;. The film depicted the episode of the burning of Lanka in the &quot;Ramayana&quot; and was long, about three reels. It was screened on 17 September 1917 at the Aryan Cinema, Poona. Anna Salunke played the male as well as the female character of Rama and his wife Sita. Thus, credited with playing the first dual role in Indian cinema. When the film was screened at the West End Cinema, Bombay, the shows were held from 7 A.M. to 3 A.M. next morning and it collected in ten days. According to film historian Amrit Gangar, the coins collected from the ticket counters were transported in gunny bags on bullock carts. The film was commercially successful and Phalke could repay all of his debts with its earnings.

===1918–1922: Partnership and retirement===
====Hindustan Cinema Films Company====
After the success of &quot;Lanka Dahan&quot;, Phalke was approached by various businessmen for the partnership. Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Ratanji Tata, and Sheth Manmohandas Ramji collected the capital and approached Phalke to convert the &quot;Phalke Films Company&quot; into a limited company, valued at . Along with the additional investment of , it was decided that in the proposed company, Phalke would have shares worth and 75% share of the profit and remaining would be distributed among other shareholders. However, the scheme could not be finalised over one of the clauses of the partnership deed. Phalke also declined the offer made by actress Fatma Begum. Among all the received offers, Phalke accepted the proposal of five Bombay-based textile industrialists which included Waman Shreedhar Apte, Laxman Balwant Phatak, Mayashankar Bhatt, Madhavji Jesingh, and Gokuldas Damodar. On 1 January 1918, the &quot;Phalke Films Company&quot; was converted into the &quot;Hindustan Cinema Films Company&quot; where Apte was appointed as managing partner, Phalke as working partner and others as financial partners.

The debut film for the newly formed company was &quot;Shri Krishna Janma&quot; where Phalke&#x27;s six-year-old daughter Mandakini played the lead role of Krishna. The film was long, about six reels and was screened on 24 August 1918 at the Majestic Cinema, Bombay. It was commercially successful and collected . Phalke&#x27;s next film &quot;Kaliya Mardan&quot; depicted the episode of killing of poisonous snake, Kaliya, by Krishna. The film was released on 3 May 1919 at the Majestic Cinema, Bombay. It was commercially successful where it ran for ten months and was long, about six reels.

====Retirement====
Though both the films made by the &quot;Hindustan Cinema Films Company&quot; were commercially successful, the partners had increasing differences. Phalke did not appreciate their interference in film production and partners had concerns over the expenditure incurred and time spent by Phalke to get desired results. Phalke decided to leave the company but his advocate brought to attention the clauses from his agreement with the &quot;Hindustan Cinema Films Company&quot;. The agreement had a span of 15 years and if Phalke decided to leave the company, he would not be given his share of profit of and would have to pay to the company. After unsuccessful attempts to resolve the differences, the partners approached Phalke&#x27;s colleagues to take over his responsibilities, in case of his exit. All of them had been associated with Phalke since &quot;Raja Harishchandra&quot; (1913) and were trained by Phalke to handle various departments of filmmaking. With their consent, the partners signed the necessary agreements with Mama Shinde, Anna Salunke, Gajanan Sane, Trymbak B. Telang, Dattatreya Telang, and Nath Telang. With increasing dissensions developed, Phalke decided to leave the company and departed with his family for Kashi. He announced his retirement and expressed his views in an article published in &quot;Navyug&quot;.

====Playwriting with &quot;Rangbhoomi&quot;====
During his stay at Kashi, Phalke saw several Hindi plays by Kirloskar Natak Mandali, a travelling drama company. The professional associated with the company like Master Manhar Barve, his father Ganpatrao Barve, and its proprietor Shankar Bapuji Mujumdar and novelist Narayan Hari Apte were friends with Phalke. They had regular discussions about various aspects of drama, cinema, music, and literature. During one such meeting, Phalke expressed his desire to write a play. He completed writing a Marathi language play &quot;Rangbhoomi&quot; in about two and a half months. It was a satire on the then-contemporary theatre and stage conditions. Phalke also read out the play to Bal Gangadhar Tilak and G. S. Khaparde who were attending the All India Congress Committee&#x27;s session held at Kashi. Both were very appreciative of the play. Phalke also organised the rehearsals of the play at the Aryan Cinema, Poona for almost a year.

Various professional drama companies approached Phalke to stage &quot;Rangbhoomi&quot;, but he had it staged at the Baliwala Theater, Bombay in 1922. It was a seven-act play, so Phalke decided to split it into two parts; four acts staged at one night and the remaining three on the next night. The performances were held in only three cities, Bombay, Poona, and Nashik. Made with the budget of , the play had very lukewarm response and was rejected for being &quot;self-indulgent&quot;.

===1922–1937: Comeback and popularity decline===
====Reconciliation with Hindustan Cinema Films Company====
Various people tried convincing Phalke to rejoin the film industry. He declined the offer made by filmmaker Jamshedji Framji Madan to produce films under his film company Madan Theatre. Achyut Kolhatkar, editor of Marathi newspaper &quot;Sandesh&quot;, wrote to Phalke requesting to rethink his decision. Phalke replied: &quot;I am dead so far as the cinema industry is concerned and have no inclination to go back to it&quot;. Kolhatkar published Phalke&#x27;s letter under the heading, &quot;Dadasaheb Phalke is Dead&quot;. Several readers wrote to &quot;Sandesh&quot; requesting Phalke to make a comeback. All these letters were published in &quot;Sandesh&quot; and Kolhatkar sent all the issues of the newspaper to Phalke at Kashi. Reading these letters, Phalke decided to come back to Nashik.

After Phalke left the Hindustan Cinema Films Company, its financial condition worsened with the shutting down of the company&#x27;s Poona branch, Bharat Film Company. On hearing the news of Phalke&#x27;s return to Nashik, the managing partner of the company, Waman Apte, with the help of the proprietor of Aryan Cinema, Bapusaheb Pathak, invited Phalke to join back the company as a Production Chief and Technical Advisor. Phalke readily agreed to the request and joined as an employee of the company on the monthly salary of .

The first film Phalke directed after joining the Hindustan Cinema Films Company was &quot;Sant Namdeo&quot; which was released on 28 October 1922. Thereafter, he directed films for the company till 1929. However, none of these films achieved comparable success with his earlier films. Phalke continued to have differences with the company owners and he left it twice until 1929. When he returned for the first time, he was offered the monthly salary of . For the second time, it was reduced to . After rest four partners left the company, its responsibility fell on the shoulders of Waman Apte. Not satisfied with the restrictions imposed by the company, Phalke tried raising the capital for the next film by himself. As Apte did not allow Phalke to raise the capital while still in the service of the company, Phalke resigned from the job.

====Phalke Diamond Company and &quot;Setubandhan&quot;====
Phalke decided to form a new company, &quot;Phalke Diamond Company&quot;, and approached Mayashankar Bhatt, a former partner of the Hindustan Cinema Films Company. Bhatt agreed to provide the capital of but with the condition that the film should be completed within the stipulated budget. Phalke accepted the proposal and started working on &quot;Setubandhan&quot;. The outdoor shooting was completed at Hampi, Chennai (then Madras), Ratnagiri. However, the capital was exhausted before the film was complete. Bhatt refused to do any more investment. Phalke tried raising more capital with no success. Thus, the filming had to be stopped for the next one year.

When Waman Apte of the Hindustan Cinema Films Company saw the sets erected for the film, he was impressed and agreed to help Phalke. He proposed the merger of the Phalke Diamond Company with his company. Phalke joined the company again as a partner and shifted the shooting at Imperial Film Studio of Bombay under the banner of the Hindustan Cinema Films Company. &quot;Setubandhan&quot; took two years to complete. As fifteen-year agreement for the Hindustan Cinema Films Company was completed, Apte decided to dissolve the company. By that time, the sound films had screened in India with the release on &quot;Alam Ara&quot;the first sound film in the Indian cinema, on 14 March 1931. Being a silent film, &quot;Setubandhan&quot; faced difficulties in getting theaters with the competition from sound films. It was released in 1932. Ardeshir Irani, the director of &quot;Alam Ara&quot;, suggested Phalke to add sound to &quot;Setubandhan&quot;. Phalke agreed and dubbed the film in Hindi at Irani&#x27;s studio with the cost of . It was re-released in 1934 but was not commercially successful.

====&quot;Gangavataran&quot;: Last film and only talkie====
In December 1934, the Maharaja of the princely state of Kolhapur, Rajaram III, invited Phalke to produce a sound film for his film company &quot;Kolhapur Cinetone&quot;. Phalke declined the invitation but was again invited by the Maharaja. He accepted the invitation and was offered for writing the story and script and as his monthly expenses. Novelist Narayan Hari Apte helped Phalke for writing the script and dialogue. Vishwanath Jadhav composed the music for film and Phalke wrote the lyrics. The film, &quot;Gangavataran&quot;, was completed in two years at the cost of . It was released on 6 August 1937 at the Royal Opera House, Bombay. &quot;Gangavataran&quot; was the only sound film directed by Phalke. He retired from the films due to his old age.

===1938–1944: Last days===
The times changed and Phalke fell victim to the emerging technology of sound film. Unable to cope with the talkies, the man who had fathered the Indian film industry became obsolete. His last silent film &quot;Setubandhan&quot; was released in 1932 and later released with dubbing. During 1936–1938, he produced his last film, &quot;Gangavataran&quot; (1937), which was the only talking movie directed by Phalke, before retiring to Nashik, where he died on 16 February 1944.

<doc id="1315300" wikidata="Q1159115" url="?curid=1315300" title="Dan Majerle">
<text>Daniel Lewis Majerle (; born September 9, 1965), also known by the nickname &quot;Thunder Dan&quot;, is an American former professional basketball player and former coach of the Grand Canyon Antelopes. He played 14 years in the National Basketball Association (NBA) with the Phoenix Suns, Miami Heat, and Cleveland Cavaliers. He won a bronze medal with the U.S. national team at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, and a gold medal at the 1994 FIBA World Championship.

==Early years==
Born and raised in Traverse City, Michigan, Majerle starred for Traverse City High School (now Central) and Central Michigan University in Mount Pleasant, where he played for four years with averages of 21.8 points and 8.9 rebounds a game. In 1987, he helped lead the Chippewas to the NCAA Tournament. He held the school season record for points until Marcus Keene broke the mark in the 2016–17 season.

Majerle&#x27;s great-grandfather Frank Majerle Sr. emigrated to the United States in 1901 at age 20 from what is now Slovenia but was then part of Austria-Hungary. Frank Sr. settled in Haring, Michigan, and married American-born Anna Suhorepec (anglicized to Suhropetz) whose parents were also from Yugoslavia, more specifically Slovenia.

==NBA career==

===Phoenix Suns (1988–1995)===
The Suns selected Majerle with the 14th pick of the 1988 NBA draft, which the Suns acquired (along with Kevin Johnson) in a trade from the Cleveland Cavaliers for Larry Nance. During the draft, he was promptly booed when his name was announced over the public address system. Suns coach Cotton Fitzsimmons publicly chastised the Suns fans and told them &quot;you&#x27;ll be sorry you ever booed this young man&quot;. In his rookie season Majerle played in 54 games and started in 5, averaging 8.6 points as a bench player. The Suns won 55 games and made the playoffs, and Majerle increased his scoring average to 14.3 points a game as Phoenix advanced all the way to the Western Conference Finals before losing to the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers.

The young Majerle continued to be used as a backup for the next two seasons and became popular for his impressive jumping ability and &quot;thunderous&quot; slam dunk that would lead to his nickname &quot;Thunder Dan&quot;. During the 1989–90 season, he started in 23 games and increased his scoring average to 11 points a game as the Suns again advanced to the Western Conference Finals where this time they were eliminated by the Portland Trail Blazers. Despite another successful season for Majerle and the Suns in the 1990–91 season, they fell in the first round of the playoffs to the Utah Jazz. Majerle had become an effective three-point shooter and defensive specialist and was named to the 1990–91 NBA All-Defensive Second team at the conclusion of the season.

The 1992 season featured more improvement for Majerle, who had become an even more effective three-point shooter and defensive specialist. Despite starting in just 15 of the 82 games he played in, Majerle was selected to play in the 1992 NBA All-Star Game. The Suns again made the playoffs but lost in the conference semifinals to Portland. In the offseason, Phoenix managed to pull off a major step towards an NBA title, as they acquired superstar forward Charles Barkley in a trade with the Philadelphia 76ers.

====1993: Trip to the Finals====
The Suns had improved significantly with the addition of Barkley, while the trade itself which featured the departure of guard Jeff Hornacek meant that Majerle now served as the team&#x27;s starting shooting guard. The result was a 62-win season for Phoenix, with Barkley winning the Most Valuable Player Award and Majerle finishing second on the team in scoring while being named to his second NBA All-Defensive Second Team. Majerle also finished first in the NBA in three-point field goals made and attempted, and scored 18 points in the 1993 NBA All-Star Game. The Suns entered the playoffs as the number 1 seed in the Western Conference, and defeated the Lakers, the San Antonio Spurs and the Seattle SuperSonics to reach the NBA Finals with Majerle averaging 15 points in the playoffs and posting big games such as a 34-point performance in the 5th game against Seattle. In the Finals, the Suns faced the defending champion Chicago Bulls led by Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen. Despite having home court advantage the Suns could not beat the 2-time champions, who won in 6 games to win three championships in a row. Majerle performed well in the Suns win in game 3, scoring 28 points in the win in Chicago.

====Last years in Phoenix====
Majerle would again lead the league in three-point field goals and attempts in the 1993–94 season, as the Suns won 56 games and made the playoffs before losing to the eventual champion Houston Rockets in a 7-game semifinal series. He would then go on to play for Team USA and win in the World Championships in Canada. He would earn another selection to the All-Star game in the following season, scoring 10 points in the 1995 NBA All-Star Game which was held in Phoenix. Despite this, Majerle started in 46 games, playing small forward often as the team now featured Wesley Person at shooting guard and veteran A.C. Green at forward. The Suns again lost in the semifinals to Houston in 7 games, and Majerle was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the offseason.

===Cleveland Cavaliers (1995–1996)===
In Cleveland, Majerle was used as a reserve at small forward, starting in 15 of the 82 games behind Chris Mills and averaging 10.6 points a game. The Cavaliers won 47 games before losing to the New York Knicks in a 3-game sweep in the first round, with Majerle increasing his scoring to 16.7 (second on the team) during the series. In the offseason the Cavaliers released Majerle, and he would go on to sign with the Miami Heat.

===Miami Heat (1996–2001)===
The Heat were a team with a bright future, as they featured all-stars Alonzo Mourning and Tim Hardaway, and were coached by Pat Riley. Injuries limited Majerle to 36 games during the 1996–97 season, as the Heat managed to win a franchise-best 61 games and the Atlantic Division. During the regular season, on December 7, 1996, against the Chicago Bulls, Majerle made a three-pointer with one second remaining to win the game 83–80. In the playoffs, the veteran Majerle was in healthy shape, and the Heat beat the up-and-coming Orlando Magic in the first round before facing the Knicks in a grueling 7-game series in which Majerle scored 18 points in the sixth game. The Heat would eventually fall to the defending champion Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference Finals in 5 games.

Majerle would again play as the team&#x27;s backup small forward in the 1997–98 season, averaging 7 points a game as one of the team&#x27;s main three-point threats, and Miami would post another winning season before losing to New York in the first round of the playoffs. The 1998–99 season would be shortened to 50 games as a result of a league lockout, and with teammate Voshon Lenard hurt for much of the season, Majerle stepped in to start in 48 games. Miami won another Atlantic Division title, but again lost to New York in 5 games in the first round.

The team continued to use Majerle as a starter during the 1999–2000 season, as he started in 69 of 82 games and again averaged 7 points during the season. In the playoffs, Miami defeated the Detroit Pistons in the first round before facing the Knicks in another 7-game series in which New York again prevailed. Majerle averaged 9 points in the playoffs and led the team with 20 three-point field goals. In the 2000 offseason it was revealed that Alonzo Mourning would not play as a result of a kidney disease, and the 2000–01 season would feature new acquisitions such as Eddie Jones and Anthony Mason, and Majerle would serve as a reserve. The Heat would lose in the first round of the playoffs in a sweep to the Charlotte Hornets, and in the offseason Majerle would sign a deal returning to his original team in Phoenix.

===Return to Phoenix (2001–2002)===
In his return to the Suns, Majerle received much praise and applause from the hometown Suns fans, playing in 65 games and leading the team in three-point field goals made with 79. His NBA career finished on April 17, 2002, when he officially retired as a member of his original team.

<doc id="1315302" wikidata="Q6693219" url="?curid=1315302" title="Lowell High School (San Francisco)">
<text>Lowell High School (LHS) is a co-educational, magnet public high school in San Francisco, California, first established in 1856. It is a part of the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD). The school sits on the side of a hill near Parkmerced, overlooking the campus of San Francisco State University. Lakeshore Elementary School is located on the western portion of the campus.

LHS uses merit-based admissions, unlike other schools in the district, which use a lottery system or receive students from a specified attendance area. The admissions process requires submitting scores from standardized testing from the previous school year and a writing supplement. Previously an entrance exam was required, but after reports of racism in the admissions department and the COVID-19 pandemic, the exam was waived in 2021. However, because academic performance decreased, use of standardized test scores was reinstated.

== History ==

===1853–1893===

In 1853, Colonel Thomas J. Nevins, San Francisco&#x27;s first superintendent of schools, raised the idea of a free high school for boys and a seminary for girls. It took three years for Nevins to persuade the Board of Education, and a resolution was passed on July 10, 1856, to establish a San Francisco High School and Ladies&#x27; Seminary. Six days later, however, the resolution was rescinded on the grounds that a high school could not legally be part of the San Francisco Common Schools. A name change from the proposed &quot;San Francisco High School and Ladies&#x27; Seminary&quot; to the &quot;Union Grammar School&quot; appeased those who had opposed the creation of a high school.

The Union Grammar School first opened on August 25, 1856, in rented quarters at the Wesleyan Methodist Church on Powell Street, between Clay and Sacramento. In 1860, the church was purchased and reconstructed as a school at the same location. The new two-story school building had four classrooms, an assembly room, and two rooms for gymnastics exercises and calisthenics. Dedication ceremonies for the new structure took place on September 19, 1860. The school in the new building was already referred to as San Francisco High School because it was generally recognized that the course of study was on the secondary level.

In May 1864, the Board of Education decided to form separate schools for boys and girls. Boys remained at the same campus at the Boys&#x27; High School, while girls were moved to their own school at Bush and Stockton streets (Girls&#x27; High School), where they would remain until the return of coeducation (in practice) in the 1880s.

===1894–1962===
In 1894, because the name Boys&#x27; High School was not in accord with the growing number of girls taking its college-preparatory classes, the school was renamed to honor the distinguished poet James Russell Lowell, chiefly through the efforts of Pelham W. Ames, a member of the school board.

The school relocated in January 1913 to an entire block on Hayes Street between Ashbury and Masonic. Lowell remained there for 50 years as the city&#x27;s college preparatory high school. In 1952, the school sought a new location near Lake Merced and moved there (its present address) in 1962.

===1963 and after===
Until 1988, the Lowell mascot was the Indian. In 1988, School Superintendent Ramon Cortines ordered that the name be changed to something less offensive. Lowell was selected as one of the 44 San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) schools considered for renaming in 2020. The school&#x27;s selection, by a committee formed by the San Francisco Board of Education, was due to James Russell Lowell&#x27;s documented racist views. Opponents have said that evidence for Lowell&#x27;s anti-war beliefs and abolitionist views far outweigh the negatives, citing his lasting influence on Martin Luther King Jr. and within the NAACP.

Lowell was the first SFUSD school to be temporarily closed during the COVID-19 pandemic in San Francisco due to a report of respiratory illness by a student&#x27;s family member in March 2020.

The 2021 documentary film &quot;Try Harder!&quot; profiled Lowell students as they went through the college admission process.

In April 2022, Principal Joe Ryan Dominguez submitted his letter of resignation, which would go into effect at the end of the school year.

== Campus ==
Lowell is located north of Lake Merced, south of San Francisco&#x27;s Parkside District. The school spans several blocks between Sylvan Dr. in the west and 25th Ave. in the east, and Eucalyptus Drive in the north to Winston Drive and Lake Merced Blvd. in the south. The school is accessible via the San Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni) K, M, 18, 23, 28, 28R, 29, 57, and 58 lines. The campus is located next to Lakeshore Elementary School, a public school, and St. Stephen School, a private K–8 school.
The campus of what was called the New Lowell High School was opened in the early 1960s and replaced the old brick campus building on Masonic Street that is still used by the district for offices and an adult school. The &quot;new&quot; Lowell campus itself consists of a main three-story academic building with two extensions, the easternmost extension being a single-story science building, which was rebuilt and reopened on September 21, 2003, after the original building from the early 1960s was demolished because the labs were antiquated. The second extension consists of a single-story free-standing building that replaced temporary classrooms.

The original single-story visual and performing arts building is the westernmost extension of the main campus and remains with the 1,000-seat Carol Channing auditorium, named for the famous actress who was an alumna. The main entrance to the theater and the school is below street level on Eucalyptus Drive.

The campus includes a library, arts and music classrooms, six computer labs, a foreign language lab, an indoor gymnasium, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s locker rooms, a dance studio, a weight room, an American football field, a soccer/multipurpose field and baseball batting cage, ten tennis courts, eight basketball courts, four volleyball courts, and a all-weather running track. The campus has two parking lots, one for students and the other for faculty. There is also a central courtyard inside the school.

There is an ROTC (Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corp) facility built into the hill and located below the theater, accessed by a stairway down from the arts wing. The ROTC facility at one time included a rifle range where cadets practiced marksmanship with live ammunition.

== Academics and class structure ==

=== Academics ===
Lowell High School historically has test scores ranking among the Top 10 Public Schools in California, including Gretchen Whitney High School and Oxford Academy. Lowell has been named a California Distinguished School seven times and a National Blue Ribbon School four times. Lowell was named a California Distinguished School in 1986, 1990, 1992, 1994, 2001, 2009, and 2015 (as a California Gold Ribbon School), as well as a National Blue Ribbon School in 1983, 1994, 2001, 2012, and 2019. As of 2024, Lowell is ranked 74th by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in its &quot;Best High Schools in America&quot; and 7th best in California. Lowell was also ranked 49th by &quot;Newsweek&quot; America&#x27;s Best High Schools 2012 list and 66th by &quot;Newsweek&quot; 2013 list.

Students have the opportunity to choose from a large number of Advanced Placement courses. Lowell has a graduation rate of nearly 100%, and it is the largest feeder school to the University of California system, particularly to the Berkeley and Davis campuses.

=== Arena scheduling system ===
Lowell used an &quot;arena&quot; class scheduling system, up until 2020, in which students were given a time slot and directed to a website to choose their classes.

While scheduling classes for the 2006 spring semester, one of the students who had volunteered to assist the running of arena was caught abusing the scheduling system to use early scheduling privileges, granted to volunteers by the administration, to let friends schedule before others. Five of six department chairs and dozens of teachers at Lowell called to eliminate arena scheduling and to replace it with computerized scheduling used in all other SFUSD schools. Critics characterized arena scheduling as an antiquated and inefficient system, and creates weeks of unnecessary work for teachers and counselors.

Proponents of the arena argued that the system can prepare students for a similar selecting of courses in college.

After a student forum, committee meetings, several student petitions, and final deliberation by then-principal Paul Cheng and the administration, it was decided that arena would remain in place, with the modifications of the abolishment of early scheduling for Shield and Scroll and &quot;mini arena,&quot; which allowed people with incomplete schedules another chance to complete them by opening up all the classes again with a few slots.

Under pressure from faculty and students, in 2013, the Lowell administration decided on an &quot;online arena&quot;. In 2012, the Lowell administration began preliminary testing by requiring students to submit their proposed classes for the next school year through an online form, designed and maintained by a few students from the computer programming classes.

During the pandemic, Lowell&#x27;s arena system was finally terminated and has remained that way since.

== Admissions ==
Lowell is the only high school in the San Francisco Unified School District that was permitted to admit only students who met special admission requirements. The Lowell admission process was competitive and based on a combination of standardized test scores, GPA, a writing sample, and extracurricular activities.

=== &quot;San Francisco NAACP v. San Francisco Unified School District&quot; (1980s) ===
In 1983, the SFUSD attempted to ensure racial desegregation at Lowell and other schools by implementing a race-based admissions policy as a result of &quot;San Francisco NAACP v. San Francisco Unified School District&quot; and the 1983 Consent Decree settlement.

The demographics began to disproportionately impact Chinese Americans in the 80s and 90s. As a result of this policy, effective in 1985, Chinese-American freshman applicants needed to score 62 out of a possible total of 69 eligibility points; Caucasian and other East Asian candidates needed only 58 points, and others needed fewer points.

=== &quot;Ho v. San Francisco Unified School District&quot; (1990s) ===
In 1994, a group of Chinese-American community activists organized a lawsuit to challenge the 1983 Consent Decree race-based admissions policies used by SFUSD for its public schools. The lawsuit was led by Lowell alum Lee Cheng. In 1999, both parties agreed to a settlement that modified the 1983 Consent Decree to create a new &quot;diversity index&quot; system which substituted race as a factor for admissions with a variety of factors such as socioeconomic background, mother&#x27;s educational level, academic achievement, language spoken at home, and English Learner Status.

Critics of the diversity index created by &quot;Ho v. San Francisco Unified School District&quot; point out that many schools, including Lowell, have become even less racially diverse since it was enacted.

On November 15, 2005, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California denied a request to extend the Consent Decree, which was set to expire on December 31, 2005, after it had been extended once before to December 31, 2002. The ruling claimed &quot;since the settlement of the &quot;Ho&quot; litigation [resulting in the institution of the &quot;diversity index&quot;], the consent decree has proven to be ineffective, if not counterproductive, in achieving diversity in San Francisco public schools&quot; by making schools more racially segregated.

=== Lottery-based admissions ===
On October 20, 2020, the Board of Education voted unanimously to base 2021 freshman admittance to Lowell on a lottery rather than academic performance. Like other high schools in the district with lottery systems, priority would be given to applicants from census tracts with lower test scores, those with siblings at the school, and those who attended Willie L. Brown Jr. Middle School. On February 9, 2021, the Board, in a 5–2 vote, made that change to a lottery-based system permanent, citing &quot;pervasive systemic racism&quot; and the school&#x27;s lack of diversity as reasons. Christine Linnenbach and Lee Cheng, attorneys and Lowell alumni (class of 1989), founded the Friends of Lowell Foundation to contest the policy. On March 8, Linnenbach filed a Cure and Correct letter challenging the Board of Education&#x27;s adoption of lottery admissions.

The SFUSD did not rescind the vote, and the Friends of Lowell Foundation, Lowell Alumni Association, SF Taxpayers Association, and the Asian American Legal Foundation filed a complaint in the San Francisco Superior Court alleging that the SFUSD had violated the Ralph M. Brown Act when the Board of Education adopted lottery admissions. The school board had voted to make lottery admissions permanent; however, in November, Judge Ethan P. Schulman granted the petition challenging lawfulness of the adoption of lottery admissions and overturned that vote. The next month, the school board voted to extend the lottery system for one year, through 2022.

During the 2021–22 school year, the first in which the lottery system was in effect, nearly 25% of freshmen students reported D or F grades, compared to nearly 8% of freshmen from the previous academic year. Constituents petitioned for a recall election against three School Board Commissioners on February 15, 2022, who were ousted by voters in a landslide. Their replacements were named by Mayor London Breed. On June 22, despite SFUSD Superintendent Vincent Matthews recommending an extension of the lottery system, the Board opted to restore merit-based admissions for the 2023–24 school year in a 4–3 vote.

=== Current application process ===
After reverting to a merit-based system, the old admissions process using a bespoke entrance exam was considered outdated and was ruled incompatible with the California education codes. Starting in January 2025, the district decided to refer to a student&#x27;s grade point average and standardized test scores. The district uses STAR exams and requires an &quot;exceeding&quot; score of at least 1,093 for reading and 1,124 for writing.

==Demographics==

2021–2022, a survey of 2,652 students.

2008–2009 faculty demographics:
*147 certified staff; 49.6% male, 50.4% female
== Student activities ==
The Cardinals are one of the most active student bodies in San Francisco, with over 84 academic organizations, teams and student interest clubs. Lowell has academic teams that are exempt from volunteer hours in exchange for not being publicized as well as the clubs.

=== Mock Trial ===
The Mock Trial team represented San Francisco County at the State Competitions in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2007, 2012, 2014, and 2016. In 2007, 2012, and 2014; they finished in the top ten at the State Finals. In 2014, the Lowell High School Mock Trial team placed 6th at the Empire Mock Trial San Francisco International Competition and in both 2015 and 2017, they won 1st place, beating out 21 teams.

=== Lowell Forensic Society ===
The Lowell Forensic Society, founded in 1892, is one of the oldest high school speech and debate teams in the nation and the largest student organization on campus, with over 200 members. The team travels regularly to prestigious national invitationals, including Harvard, UC Berkeley, Stanford, CSU Long Beach, and the Tournament of Champions in Kentucky. Lowell Forensics has also competed in the National Speech and Debate Tournament under the National Forensic League for 40 years, making it one of the longest running national championship teams in the nation. Forensics alumni include Yale University President Richard Levin, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, California Governor Edmund G. &quot;Pat&quot; Brown, actress Carol Channing, actor Benjamin Bratt, writer Naomi Wolf, actor Bill Bixby, PG&amp;E CEO Frederick Mielke, author Daniel Handler of Series of Unfortunate Events fame and numerous academics, writers, and judges.

=== &quot;The Lowell&quot; ===
The student-run publication, &quot;The Lowell&quot;, has won the CSPA Gold and Silver Crown awards, the NSPA Pacemaker (1993, 2000, 2003, 2006, 2012) and the Northern California Society for Professional Journalists&#x27; James Madison Award, in recognition of their 2006–2007 school year battle to protect free speech. &quot;The Lowell&quot; received the All-American ranking, with five marks of distinction, from the NSPA, the highest award.

=== CardinalBotics ===
The Lowell Robotics team, CardinalBotics, which first competed in 2012, is a FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team. In both 2021 and 2022, they won the Chairman&#x27;s Award (now FIRST Impact Award), the most prestigious award in FRC, for promoting STEM among local youth and supporting the San Francisco Bay Area robotics community. CardinalBotics were regional finalists in 2013, 2018, and 2019. The team also won the Rookie All Star Award in 2012, the Judges Award in 2014, the Regional Engineering Inspiration Award in 2014, 2016, and 2024, the Game Design Challenge Finalist award in 2021, and two Gracious Professionalism Awards in 2023. In 2013, the team&#x27;s founder won the FIRST Dean&#x27;s List Award on the National Level, and in 2021 another member won the FIRST Dean&#x27;s List Finalist Award. CardinalBotics attempts to encourage more students, especially women and minority students, to pursue STEM college majors and careers. The team also supports local LGBTQ youth through events such as their pride month t-shirt fundraiser.

=== Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC) ===

Lowell has an Army Junior Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps battalion consisting of nine special competition units (Drum Corps, Exhibition Drill Teams (boys and girls), Color Guard, Drill Platoon, Brigade Best Squad, Lowell Raider Challenge Team, Academic Bowl, and the Lowell Leadership Symposium Team) and 5 companies (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Foxtrot). Echo was disbanded in 2018, then restored in 2022.

The Lowell Cadet Corps was founded in 1882 and later became known as Lowell Army JROTC when it adopted the national JROTC curriculum. A photo of the Lowell Battalion&#x27;s former rifle range, now converted into a classroom and indoor drill facility, was featured in the Army JROTC Cadet Reference Second Edition. William &quot;Bill&quot; Hewlett was the Lowell Army JROTC Battalion Commander in the 1929–1930 school year.

Every fall, the Lowell Drill Platoon, Color Guard, Best Guidon Bearer, and Brigade Best Squad compete in the Annual Fall Liberty Bell Competition. In addition, every spring, Lowell&#x27;s Exhibition Drill Teams, Flag Drill Teams, and Drum Corps participate in the Spring 91st Infantry Memorial Drill Competition. The Lowell Raider Challenge Team also competes in the San Francisco JROTC Brigade Raider Challenge, which consists of a physical fitness test, first aid obstacle course, land navigation, and a three kilometer run. Academic Bowl competes in two online competitions over the school year and a national competition in June in Washington, D.C.

Those who join JROTC will not be recruited into the army. The program offers leadership and team working opportunities through lessons related to first aid, money management, problem solving, and map reading. The program&#x27;s motto is &quot;to motivate young people to be better citizens.&quot;

=== Athletics ===
Lowell has competitive football, cross-country, soccer, tennis, volleyball, basketball, wrestling, badminton, dragonboat, softball, swimming, track and field, fencing, flag football, golf, cheerleading, and baseball teams.

In 2004, Lowell&#x27;s Boys Varsity Basketball team won its first AAA Championship since 1952. Following a runner-up finish in 2005, the 2006 squad went undefeated in league play and finished with a 30–3 record and a city championship. The 2007 squad also won the championships, while the 2008 squad finished high in the playoffs. The 2009 team once again won the 2009 AAA championships over Lincoln. The basketball team engages in an annual rivalry with Washington High School in a game commonly known to those in the city as the &quot;Battle of the Birds&quot; game, named after the teams&#x27; cardinal and eagle mascots.

Lowell&#x27;s Varsity Baseball team, led by coach John Donohue, won eight of ten championships from 1994 to 2004 while posting a regular season record of 185 wins and only 11 losses during that span. Coach Donohue won his 300th AAA league game on March 7, 2003, and tallied his 450th win overall just two weeks later on March 21, 2003.

In 2004, Lowell&#x27;s track and field and cross-country teams won the city championship in all four divisions for the seventh year in a row. The cross country team recently swept all three divisions at the city finals in Golden Gate Park, marking Lowell&#x27;s 26th overall championship win in a row. In recent years, the track and field team has attracted about 150 athletes each season, and the cross country Team has attracted nearly 100 runners each season.

Lowell&#x27;s Girls&#x27; Varsity Volleyball team has dominated the sport since its creation with the most city championships amongst other San Francisco public schools, and from November 1996 to November 2008, went on a record streak of 13 consecutive volleyball city championships. The girls&#x27; junior varsity volleyball team also owns 15 of the 18 city titles (as of November 2010). In November 2019, the girls&#x27; varsity volleyball team won the CIF State Division 3 Championship.

In April 2007, Lowell&#x27;s varsity swim team won their 11th consecutive AAA Championship title, with an undefeated season and an undefeated girls&#x27; title, ever since girls have been admitted on the team. The close rivalry between the Cardinals&#x27; and the Washington Eagles ended with Lowell coming out on top of all the other SFUSD high schools participating, which included Balboa High, Lincoln High, and Wallenberg High School.
In April 2008, Lowell&#x27;s varsity swim team won their 12th consecutive AAA Championship title, with an undefeated season yet again. The rivalry between the Cardinals&#x27; and the Washington Eagles ended with Lowell coming on top with the varsity boys scoring 170-49 and the girls 122–62. The JV girls also were able to defeat Washington with a score of 104–67. However, the JV boys lost to their counterpart from Lincoln 93–69.

In April 2007, Lowell&#x27;s dragonboat team competed in the California Dragonboat Association Youth Race at Lake Merced in San Francisco, California. They brought home three golds and two silvers. The Lowellitas, the girls&#x27; team, won their seventh consecutive gold medal. In the spring of 2010 the Lowell Dragonboat team won gold medals in the top division, breaking a five-year drought of golds for Lowell in the top division traced back to 2005.

, Lowell&#x27;s Varsity Girls&#x27; Soccer has won the AAA Championship title for the past 21 years in a row. In 2012, they ended their season without being scored on in league games, a record of 101–0. Their most recent defeat was two seasons ago, a forfeit to Balboa on April 6, 2010. Aside from forfeits, the girls have remained undefeated for the past 10 years in league play. There is no JV team.

Lowell&#x27;s JV Girls&#x27; Gymnastics team placed first in the NCVAL JV Gymnastics Finals from 2007 to 2010. At the CCS Varsity Finals, Lowell&#x27;s Varsity Girls&#x27; Gymnastics team placed third in 2009 and second in 2010. Lowell does not have a boys&#x27; gymnastics team.

The Lowell Varsity Cheer Squad placed 1st in stunts and received a runner up medal in dance in the 2009 AAA competition. They also went to USA Nationals (2010) and placed in the top half of their division (4 points away from 1st place). In 2015, Lowell Cheer attended USA Nationals and won 4th place in the Super Novice Show Cheer Division. Lowell Cheer also performs at school rallies for football and basketball games.

<text>The New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn (abbreviated NROOGD, commonly pronounced &quot;nuh-roog&#x27;d&quot;) is a Wiccan tradition founded in 1967. Despite its name, has little or nothing to do with the original Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.

== History ==

The NROOGD Tradition of the Craft originated in 1967 with a group of friends (including e.l.f. Silverlocke, Glen Turner, Judy Greenwood, and Aidan Kelly). e.l.f. Silverlocke was taking a class at San Francisco State College, which gave her the assignment of creating and leading a ritual. She came up with the idea of recreating a Witches&#x27; Sabbath, using published sources from Robert Graves, Margaret Murray and Gerald Gardner, a ritual was composed that has served as the basis of NROOGD practice ever since. After repeat performances of this rite yielded results on a number of occasions, a decision was made to create a group identity and train others in its performance.

The name New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn was coined since it was a wholly new Tradition, it was Orthodox since it took its beliefs from the ancients, and it was a Magical Order as was the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. They considered themselves in some sense the spiritual and magical successors of the Golden Dawn. Bonewits considers NROOGD to be the quintessential (and probably the first) &quot;California Eclectic&quot; Wiccan Tradition, near the &quot;liberal/heterodox&quot; end of his Wiccan spectrum of &quot;orthodoxy/heterodoxy.&quot;

The mother circle of NROOGD hived off daughter and granddaughter covens, which trace an unbroken line of initiation and share a common liturgy.

== Practices ==

Covens are autonomous and recognize one another&#x27;s initiates. The Tradition worships a triply aspected Goddess and various forms of the God derived from ancient Greek and British mythology.

Coven Esbats are usually held skyclad, (Some covens do choose to work robed.) and focus on the working of ethical magic and the celebration of the divinity of each participant.

In 1976, the governing body of the NROOGD called the Red Cord Council was dissolved, and a consensus decision to call the Order a Tradition was made. Since that time, those groups tracing their lines of initiation back to a member of the original group and who share certain forms of liturgy consider themselves part of the NROOGD tradition.

The core NROOGD ritual, is made of poetry and charms, and begins with a line dance in the form of a spiral inwards and then outwards, representing death and rebirth. Central to the public face of the Tradition is the celebration of the solar cycle, as observed through public Sabbats.

NROOGD public ritual is often known for a particularly poetic style of conjuration, the invocation of the Lord and the Lady (in her triple aspect), and the use of the Spiral Dance. Some have called NROOGD a &quot;bardic&quot; Tradition, because of its strong emphasis on poetic expression and the power of words and song.

Initially, the ritual performance required three priestesses and one priest, but now this form is usually reserved for large public rituals; the smaller coven meetings typically require only one of each. Although magical workings vary in form and content, they often include enchantments and simple verse. Mythic enactments corresponding to a needed transformation may also be performed.

NROOGD continues to hold large public ritual celebrations at each of the eight Sabbats for the benefit of the greater Pagan community, and periodic meetings of area covens are held to decide responsibilities for the coming year.

Esbats in NROOGD covens usually focus on the working of magic, or on celebration of the divinity of each participant, recognizing and greeting the force of a usually triply aspected Goddess and God. The magical workings vary in form and content, but often include charms and simple poetry. Poetic ritual writing is much encouraged by the tradition. Mythic enactments corresponding to a needed transformation may also be performed.

Sharing food and drink (called a Love Feast) usually wraps up the agenda, as all prepare themselves to reenter their daily reality. Gods, Demigods, or other spirits at each of the cardinal directions serve as Guardians of the Circle and of the Elements, and are usually different for each coven. Names of the Gods tend to be idiosyncratic to each group and some covens keep them secret nowadays.

During the late 1980s and 1990s, younger members expanded inherited liturgy by writing new poetry and songs for new rituals. This continues in the Tradition today. NROOGD encourages creative expression, and these new writings serve to keep the Tradition alive.

NROOGD covens in the San Francisco Bay Area cooperate to present public (clothed) ritual celebrations on most of the Sabbats, for the benefit of the greater Pagan community. Often in the fall, NROOGD enacts a ritual at the seaside inspired by and commemorating the Greater Eleusinian Mysteries of the Hellenic world.

== Geography ==

NROOGD member covens are primarily based in the San Francisco Bay Area, yet practitioners are found all over the State of California, The Southwest, the Pacific Northwest, the East Coast, Canada and the UK. There is neither central authority nor spokesperson for the tradition.

== Moral code ==

NROOGD Laws of the Craft:

* An it harm none, do as ye will.
* You may not alter another&#x27;s life/karma without his or her permission.
* Solve the problem, no more, no less.
* You must help your brothers and sisters in the Craft as best you can.
* If you stick your hand in a flame, you&#x27;ll get burned.

<text>Pankaj Kumar Mullick (10 May 1905 – 19 February 1978) was an Indian music composer, playback singer and actor, who was a pioneer of film music in Bengali cinema and Hindi cinema at the advent of playback singing, as well as an early exponent of Rabindra Sangeet.

He was awarded the Padma Shri in 1970, followed by the Dadasaheb Phalke Award (India&#x27;s highest award in cinema, given by the Government of India) in 1972 for lifetime contribution to Indian cinema.

==Early life and training==
Pankaj Kumar Mullick was born in Kolkata to Monimohan and Monomohini Mullick. His father Monimohan had a deep interest in traditional Bengali music. He started his early training in Indian classical music under the tutelage of Durgadas Bandyopadhyaya. He studied at the Scottish Church College of the University of Calcutta. An important turning point in his life came when, after finishing his studies, he came in contact with Dinendranath Tagore, who was Rabindranath Tagore&#x27;s grand-nephew. This led to Pankaj Mullick&#x27;s lasting interest in Rabindra Sangeet. Rabindranath Tagore, in turn, grew fond of him, and soon Mullick became known as one of the leading exponents of Tagore&#x27;s songs.

==Career==
Tagore&#x27;s song &quot;Nemecche Aaj Prothom Badal&quot; became his first commercial recording, with the Kolkata-based Videophone Company in 1926, at the age of twenty one. This was the first of many albums which made him a household name in Rabindra sangeet.

He started his career with the Indian Broadcasting Corporation in Calcutta in 1927, the forerunner of All India Radio (AIR), along with composer R. C. Boral, where he contributed as a music director and artist for nearly fifty years. Apart from composing songs for movies, he also composed the programme called Mahishashur Mardini. This program was based on the triumph Maa Durga over the demon Mahishashur. The programme included Chandi Path by Birendra Krishna Bhadra and agomoni songs by various singers. This programme gained such a huge popularity that till date, the recorded version of this programme is played by All India Radio on the day of Mahalaya at 4:00 am.

He contributed in various capacities to Bengali, Hindi, Urdu and Tamil language films for 38 years, starting in 1931. He worked as music director to artists like K.L. Saigal, S.D. Burman, Hemanta Mukherjee, Geeta Dutt and Asha Bhosle. He acted with famous film actors like K L Saigal, P.C. Barua and Kanan Devi. Along with Nitin Bose and his renowned sound engineer brother Mukul Bose, Mullick introduced playback singing in Indian cinema.

He worked with one of the early film studios, New Theatres Calcutta for 25 years.

==Legacy==

The Indian Postal Service released a postage stamp on his birth centenary in 2006 on 4 August, and on 10 May, Doordarshan, India&#x27;s state television channel, telecast a special music programme to commemorate the occasion. Five decades earlier, it was he and Bharatanatyam danseuse Vyjayanthimala who were lead performers at the nationwide launch of the channel in 1959.

<doc id="1315335" wikidata="Q5384351" url="?curid=1315335" title="Equestrian at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Individual eventing">
<text>The individual eventing event, part of the equestrian program at the 2004 Summer Olympics, was held from 15 to 18 August 2004 in the Olympic Equestrian Centre on the outskirts of Markopoulo in the Attica region of Greece. Like all other equestrian events, the eventing competition was mixed gender, with both male and female athletes competing in the same division.

For the first time, there were two rounds of jumping. Both rounds counted towards the individual results. After the first round, the final team placings were determined. Then the top 25 pairs ( limited to three per nation ) contested a second jumping round, the results from this were added to the riders scores to determine the final individual results.

==Medalists==
==Bettina Hoy==
The German Bettina Hoy was initially awarded first place. During the first jumping phase, she received 14 time penalty points in an otherwise flawless round. This put her in eighth place going into the final phase. The Germans appealed those points, noting that the time on which the points had been assigned (the time from when Hoy had first crossed the starting line) was not the same time as the time displayed on the stadium clock and which Hoy had thought was the official time. The clock had been reset and displayed the time from when Hoy had crossed the starting line the second time, which was when she began her jumps. These points were then rescinded by the Jury of Appeal, which put Hoy in second place only 2.20 points behind the then-leader. In the final jumping phase, Hoy moved into first place and was awarded the gold medal on 18 August. The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled on 21 August that the appeal had been incorrectly upheld and ordered that the 14 points be returned to Hoy&#x27;s score. This stripped her of her medal and put her in ninth place.

==Results==
The total score for each horse and rider was the sum of the total penalty points earned in the various phases of competitions. The pair with the lowest number of penalty points was victorious.

===Standings after Dressage===
For the dressage portion of the competition, horse and rider pairs performed series of movements that were evaluated by judges. Judges gave marks of 0 to 10 for each movement, subtracting points for errors. The score for each judge was represented by a percentage of marks possible that were gained. Scores from the three judges were averaged for an overall percentage. This was then subtracted from 100 and multiplied by 1.5 to determine the number of penalty points awarded for the round.

===Standings after Dressage and Cross-Country===
In the cross country phase, each pair had to traverse an obstacle course spread over a track of approximately 5.57 kilometres. The optimum time for the course was 9 minutes, 46 seconds. Pairs received .4 penalty points for every second beyond that time, up to a limit of 19 minutes and 32 seconds. Any pair that had not finished in that time was eliminated.

Penalty points were also assessed for disobedience faults at obstacles and for falls. Disobedience faults incurred 20 penalty points, rider falls incurred 65, and horse falls eliminated the pair. The total penalty points from cross country were added to those incurred in phase 1, dressage, for a two-round total.

===Standings after Show jumping round one===
In show jumping, pairs received 4 penalty points for each obstacle knocked down, 4 penalty points for the horse&#x27;s first disobedience, and 8 penalty points for the rider&#x27;s first fall. They also received 1 penalty point for each second over the optimum time.

They could be eliminated for a second disobedience, the rider&#x27;s second fall, the horse&#x27;s first fall, or taking more than twice the optimum time to finish the course. No pairs were eliminated in any of these fashions, though one team did not start and two more withdrew.

===Final results after Jumping final===
A second round of jumping was used to determine final rankings. 25 pairs of horses and riders qualified, but only three from each NOC were allowed to compete.

As before, pairs received 4 penalty points for each obstacle knocked down, 4 penalty points for the horse&#x27;s first disobedience, and 8 penalty points for the rider&#x27;s first fall. They also received 1 penalty point for each second over the optimum time.

They could be eliminated for a second disobedience, the rider&#x27;s second fall, the horse&#x27;s first fall, or taking more than twice the optimum time to finish the course.

==Final rankings==
Four pairs did not qualify for the final jumping because three other pairs from their team had already qualified. Those four pairs have their positions after phase three in parentheses.

<text>Rishi Kapoor (4 September 1952 – 30 April 2020) was an Indian actor, film director, and producer who worked in Hindi films. In a career spanning 50 years, he is regarded as one of the most successful and accomplished actors in Hindi cinema. Kapoor was the recipient of several accolades, including a National Film Award and four Filmfare Awards. 

Born into the Kapoor family, he made his debut, as an adolescent, in his father Raj Kapoor&#x27;s film &quot;Mera Naam Joker&quot;, for which he won the National Film Award for Best Child Artist. As an adult, his first lead role was opposite Dimple Kapadia in the teen romance &quot;Bobby&quot;, which won him the Filmfare Award for Best Actor. Between 1973 and 2000, Kapoor starred as the romantic lead in 92 films. He starred in several successful films from the mid-1970s to the 1990s, such as &quot;Kabhi Kabhie&quot;, &quot;Laila Majnu&quot;, &quot;Amar Akbar Anthony&quot;, &quot;Hum Kisise Kum Nahin&quot;, &quot;Sargam&quot;, &quot;Naseeb&quot;, &quot;Kaatilon Ke Kaatil&quot;, &quot;Prem Rog&quot;, &quot;Coolie&quot;, &quot;Nagina&quot;, &quot;Chandni&quot;, &quot;Henna&quot;, &quot;Deewana&quot;, &quot;Bol Radha Bol&quot; and &quot;Damini&quot;. He also received acclaim for his performances in &quot;Khel Khel Mein&quot;, &quot;Rafoo Chakkar&quot;, &quot;Barood&quot;, &quot;Naya Daur&quot;, &quot;Jhoota Kahin Ka&quot;, &quot;Karz&quot;, &quot;Yeh Vaada Raha&quot;, &quot;Bade Dilwala&quot;, &quot;Saagar&quot;, &quot;Tawaif&quot;, &quot;Ek Chadar Maili Si&quot; and &quot;Hathyar&quot;.

Since the 2000s, Kapoor played character roles to critical acclaim in films such as &quot;Hum Tum&quot;, &quot;Fanaa&quot;, &quot;Namastey London&quot;, &quot;Love Aaj Kal&quot;, &quot;Agneepath&quot;, &quot;Housefull 2&quot;, &quot;Aurangzeb&quot;, &quot;Shuddh Desi Romance&quot;, &quot;102 Not Out&quot; and &quot;Mulk&quot;. For his performance in &quot;Do Dooni Chaar&quot;, he won the Filmfare Award for Best Actor (Critics), and for his role in the ensemble family drama &quot;Kapoor &amp; Sons&quot;, he won the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor. He was honoured with the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award in 2008. His final film appearance was in &quot;Sharmaji Namkeen&quot;, which was released posthumously.

Kapoor met his wife, actress Neetu Singh, while working in films. They have 2 children, including the actor Ranbir Kapoor. He died of leukemia on 30 April 2020, aged 67.

== Early life and family ==

Kapoor was born on 4 September 1952 at his family&#x27;s home, Raj Kapoor Bungalow, in Matunga, South Bombay, in the then-Bombay State of India, into a Punjabi Hindu Khatri family of the Kapoor clan, from Peshawar and originally from Samundri, to parents Raj Kapoor and Krishna Malhotra. He attended Colonel Brown Cambridge School in Dehradun, Campion School in Bombay and Mayo College in Ajmer.

Part of the Kapoor family, he was the second son of legendary actor-director Raj Kapoor and Krishna Raj Kapoor (née Malhotra). Likewise, his family encompasses a successful line of actors, including brothers, Randhir and Rajiv Kapoor; paternal grandfather Prithviraj Kapoor; paternal granduncle Trilok Kapoor, maternal uncles Prem, Rajendra, and Narendra Nath, as well as Prem Chopra; paternal uncles Shashi Kapoor and Shammi Kapoor. Rishi Kapoor&#x27;s two sisters are late Ritu Nanda, who was an insurance agent, and Rima Jain. The actresses Karisma Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor, the actors Armaan Jain and Aadar Jain, and Nitasha Nanda and the businessman Nikhil Nanda are his nieces and nephews.

== Career ==

Around the age of three, Kapoor&#x27;s first on-screen appearance was a cameo in his father Raj Kapoor&#x27;s film &quot;Shree 420&quot; (1955), where he would appear in the musical sequence of &quot;Pyaar Hua, Iqraar Hua Hai&quot;. Likewise, Raj Kapoor would direct the film that provided Rishi his debut role, the 1970 film &quot;Mera Naam Joker&quot;, in which the actor would portray the young version of the lead character (played by Raj Kapoor). His performance in the film earned him the National Film Award for Best Child Artist.

Rishi Kapoor&#x27;s first leading role in adulthood came opposite Dimple Kapadia, in the 1973 teen romance &quot;Bobby&quot;, also directed by his father. &quot;Bobby&quot; went on to become one of the decade&#x27;s biggest hits in India, and earned him the Filmfare Award for Best Actor. Regarding the film, he would say in a 2012 interview: &quot;There was a misconception that the film was made to launch me as an actor. The film was actually made to pay the debts of &quot;Mera Naam Joker&quot;. Dad wanted to make a teenage love story and he did not have money to cast Rajesh Khanna in the film.&quot; Following &quot;Bobby&quot; (1973), he starred in several light-hearted comedies within that decade, including, among others: &quot;Khel Khel Mein&quot; (1975) and &quot;Rafoo Chakkar&quot; (1975) with Neetu Singh; &quot;Amar Akbar Anthony&quot; (1977) with Amitabh Bachchan and Vinod Khanna; and &quot;Hum Kisise Kum Naheen&quot; (1977) with Zeenat Aman.

Kapoor worked with actress Neetu Singh for the first time in &quot;Zahreela Insaan&quot; (1974). The two would go on to share screen space in multiple projects, including &quot;Kabhi Kabhie&quot; (1976) and &quot;Doosra Aadmi&quot; (1976), and would eventually marry in 1980. In 1980, Kapoor starred along with Tina Munim in Subhash Ghai&#x27;s musical reincarnation thriller &quot;Karz&quot; (1980), which went on to become a cult classic with a highly popular soundtrack. In a role considered one of his career-best works, Kapoor played an idealistic Devdhar in the 1982 musical romantic drama &quot;Prem Rog&quot;, a film based on the concept of widow remarriage, co-starring Padmini Kolhapure, which earned him his second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor. Another highlight of his career was the musical romantic drama &quot;Saagar&quot; (1985), directed by noted director Ramesh Sippy, which saw Kapoor reunite with Dimple Kapadia, 12 years after they made their debuts in &quot;Bobby&quot;. He appeared as the second lead in several multi-starrer films in the 1980s such as &quot;Naseeb&quot; (1981), &quot;Kaatilon Ke Kaatil&quot; (1981), &quot;Coolie&quot; (1983), &quot;Dosti Dushmani&quot; (1986), &quot;Ghar Ghar Ki Kahani&quot; (1988) and &quot;Gharana&quot; (1989). In the 1986 drama &quot;Ek Chadar Maili Si&quot;, adapted from Rajendra Singh Bedi&#x27;s novel of the same name, Kapoor would play a man forced by customs to marry his widowed sister-in-law, played by Hema Malini. He ended the decade on a high with Yash Chopra&#x27;s blockbuster romantic musical &quot;Chandni&quot; (1989) starring as Sridevi&#x27;s love interest, Rohit, a helpless romantic-turned-cripple, which earned him another nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor.

In 1991, Kapoor starred along with Pakistani actress Zeba Bakhtiyar in &quot;Henna&quot;, a tale of love across national borders, which was envisioned by his father, Raj Kapoor, and directed by his elder brother Randhir Kapoor. Henna was India&#x27;s submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Kapoor also had a leading role in the 1993 film &quot;Damini&quot;, co-starring Meenakshi Seshadri and Sunny Deol, that went on to be considered a classic socially-oriented film. Between 1973 and 2000, Kapoor&#x27;s other film roles (mainly as the romantic lead) include: &quot;Raaja&quot; (1975), &quot;Laila Majnu&quot; (1976), &quot;Sargam&quot; (1979), which earned him a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor, &quot;Bade Dil Wala&quot; (1983), &quot;Tawaif&quot; (1985), which earned him another nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor, &quot;Bol Radha Bol&quot; (1992), &quot;Deewana&quot; (1992) and &quot;&quot; (2000). Kapoor debuted as a director in &quot;Aa Ab Laut Chalen&quot; (1999) which starred Rajesh Khanna, Akshaye Khanna and Aishwarya Rai. This remained his sole directorial venture.

Kapoor successfully transitioned to character acting in the mid-2000s, going on to appear in several supporting roles, such as in &quot;Hum Tum&quot; (2004), &quot;Fanaa&quot; (2006), &quot;Namastey London&quot; (2007) and &quot;Love Aaj Kal&quot; (2009). In 2007, he appeared in Aditya Raj Kapoor&#x27;s British English-language films &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Dreaming&quot; and &quot;Sambar Salsa&quot;. 

In the 2010s, he played diverse roles such as the villain in &quot;Agneepath&quot; (2012), &quot;Aurangzeb&quot; (2013) and &quot;Kaanchi&quot; (2014); a gay dean in the coming-of-age romance &quot;Student of the Year&quot; (2012); and real-life mobster Dawood Ibrahim in the action thriller &quot;D–Day&quot; (2013). He appeared with his brother Randhir for the first time in the multi-starrer comedy &quot;Housefull 2&quot; (2012). He won the Filmfare Award for Best Actor (Critics) for his role in &quot;Do Dooni Chaar&quot; (2010), playing a middle-aged father trying to buy his own car, starring alongside his wife Neetu Singh. He also bagged the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor for his work in the ensemble family drama &quot;Kapoor &amp; Sons&quot; (2016). He also appeared in the action comedy &quot;Besharam&quot; (2013) along with his wife Neetu and son Ranbir Kapoor.

After two decades, he reunited on-screen with frequent co-star Amitabh Bachchan in &quot;102 Not Out&quot; (2018), in which the two play an old-aged father-son duo. In 2018, he appeared in the Netflix drama &quot;Rajma Chawal&quot; and received high critical acclaim for his portrayal of a Muslim in &quot;Mulk&quot;. In 2019, Kapoor had two releases: &quot;Jhootha Kahin Ka&quot;, a comedy-drama film directed by Smeep Kang; and &quot;The Body&quot;, co-starring Emraan Hashmi, a mystery-thriller written and directed by Jeethu Joseph. Released on 13 December 2019, &quot;The Body&quot; would be Kapoor&#x27;s last film to be released during his lifetime.

At the time of his death on 30 April 2020, Hitesh Bhatia&#x27;s &quot;Sharmaji Namkeen&quot; co-starring Juhi Chawla, was under production and a four-day schedule was pending at the time of Kapoor&#x27;s death. Producer Honey Trehan on 8 May 2020 confirmed that the film will be released in theatres. In January 2021, it was reported that Paresh Rawal is going to complete Kapoor&#x27;s unfinished portions of the film, and it was released on Amazon Prime Video on 31 March 2022.

== Personal life ==

Kapoor married actress Neetu Singh, from New Delhi, also of Punjabi Khatri descent, in 1980. The couple had two children — son, actor Ranbir Kapoor, and a daughter, Riddhima Kapoor. Kapoor&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Khullam Khulla: Rishi Kapoor Uncensored&quot;, was released on 15 January 2017. Kapoor wrote the book along with Meena Iyer, and the title was published under HarperCollins. 

Kapoor was known to make controversial socio-political comments. In March 2016, he criticized the Nehru–Gandhi family over naming of roads, buildings and national assets in the name of Gandhi and Nehru. In September 2017, he again took on the Gandhi family by slamming Rahul Gandhi over dynastic politics. In March 2020, he expressed anger and criticized the Indian Judiciary with the &quot;Tareekh Pe Tareekh&quot; dialogue of his film &quot;Damini&quot; over the delay in execution of the four perpetrators who were convicted in the &quot;Nirbhaya&quot; case due to loopholes in the laws.

<text>The Bell 206 is a family of two-bladed, single- and twin-engined helicopters, manufactured by Bell Helicopter at its Mirabel, Quebec, plant. Originally developed as the Bell YOH-4 for the United States Army&#x27;s Light Observation Helicopter program, it was not selected by the Army. Bell redesigned the airframe and successfully marketed the aircraft commercially as the five-place Bell 206A JetRanger. The new design was eventually selected by the Army as the OH-58 Kiowa.

Bell also developed a seven-place LongRanger, which was later offered with a twin-engined option as the TwinRanger, while Tridair Helicopters offers a similar conversion of the LongRanger called the Gemini ST. The ICAO-assigned model designation &quot;B06&quot; is used on flight plans for the JetRanger and LongRanger, and the designation &quot;B06T&quot; is used for the twin-engined TwinRangers.

==Development==

===Origins and JetRanger===
On October 14, 1960, the United States Navy solicited responses from 25 aircraft manufacturers to a request for proposals (RFP) on behalf of the Army for the Light Observation Helicopter (LOH). Bell entered the competition along with 12 other manufacturers, including Hiller Aircraft and Hughes Tool Co., Aircraft Division. Bell submitted the &quot;D-250&quot; design, which would be designated as the &quot;YHO-4&quot;. On May 19, 1961, Bell and Hiller were announced as winners of the design competition.

Bell developed the D-250 design into the Bell 206 aircraft, redesignated as YOH-4A in 1962, and produced five prototype aircraft for the Army&#x27;s test and evaluation phase. The first prototype flew on December 8, 1962. The YOH-4A also came to be known as &quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot; in comparison to the other contending aircraft. Following a fly-off of the Bell, Hughes and Fairchild-Hiller prototypes, the Hughes OH-6 was selected in May 1965.

When the YOH-4A was eliminated by the Army, Bell went about solving the problem of marketing the aircraft. In addition to the image problem, the helicopter lacked cargo space and only provided cramped seating for the planned three passengers. The solution was a redesigned fuselage, sleeker and aesthetically appealing, adding 16 ft3 (0.45 m3) of cargo space in the process. A Bell executive contributed to this redesign by drawing on a sketch two lines extending the fuselage to where it meets the tail. The redesign was designated Bell 206A, and Bell President Edwin J. Ducayet named it the JetRanger, denoting an evolution from the popular Model 47J Ranger.

Bell Helicopter ended production of the Bell 206B-3 version in 2010. In 2011, used 206B-3s sold for around $1.4 million depending upon the equipment and configuration. Bell intends for the Bell 505 Jet Ranger X to replace the 206 five-seat versions from around 2015 and compete with the Robinson R66.

===LongRanger===

The 206L LongRanger is a stretched variant with seating for seven. The fuselage, stretched a total of , adds two rear-facing seats between the front and rear seats. Since 1975, Bell has produced more than 1,700 LongRangers across all variant types. In 1981, a military version, the 206L TexasRanger was released. The original 206L used an Allison 250-C20B engine, and a series of model upgrades replaced this engine with more powerful versions; the 206L-1 used a 250-C28, and the 206L-3 and 206L-4 used the 250-C30P.

In both applications, the 250-C30P is derated from 650 hp for takeoff and 501 hp continuous. The 206L-3 is transmission-limited to 435 hp for take-off, and the 206L-4 is transmission-limited to 495 hp. The derating of the C30P produces an advantage in hot-day and high-altitude operations as it can produce the rated horsepower at higher altitudes and temperatures where applications that use the maximum rating of the engine at sea level suffer accelerated performance deterioration with increases in temperature and altitude. The 206L-3 and L-4 have not been offered in a twin configuration under those model designations.

In 2007, Bell announced an upgrade program for the 206L-1 and 206L-3 which is designed to modify the aircraft to the 206L-4 configuration; modified aircraft are designated 206L-1+ and 206L-3+. Modifications include strengthened airframe structural components (including a new tailboom), improved transmission, upgraded engine for the L-1, all of which result in a maximum gross weight increase of 300 pounds and increased performance.

Production of the 206L-4 ended in June 2017 with over 3,800 LongRangers built.

===Gemini ST and TwinRanger===
The &quot;TwinRanger&quot; name dates from the mid-1980s when Bell developed the &quot;Bell 400 TwinRanger&quot;, but it never entered production.

In 1989, Tridair Helicopters began developing a twin-engine conversion of the LongRanger, the &quot;Gemini ST&quot;. The prototype&#x27;s first flight was on January 16, 1991, while full FAA certification was awarded in November. Certification covers the conversion of LongRanger 206L-1s, L-3s and L-4s to Gemini ST configuration. In mid-1994 the Gemini ST was certificated as the first Single/Twin aircraft, allowing it to operate either as a single or twin engine aircraft throughout all phases of flight.

The &quot;Bell 206LT TwinRanger&quot; was a new-build production model equivalent to Tridair&#x27;s Gemini ST, and was based on the 206L-4. Thirteen 206LTs were built, the first being delivered in January 1994, and the last in 1997. The TwinRanger was replaced in Bell&#x27;s lineup by the mostly-new &quot;Bell 427&quot;.

==Operational history==
The first Bell 206A flew on January 10, 1966, and the aircraft was revealed later that month at the Helicopter Association of America (HAA) convention. On October 20, 1966, the JetRanger received FAA certification. Delivery of the JetRanger to customers began on January 13, 1967, with the first aircraft being purchased by Harry Holly, CEO of the Hollymatic Corporation and previous owner of a Bell Ranger. In 1968, the United States Navy selected the 206A as its primary trainer, the TH-57 Sea Ranger. The Army also eventually selected the 206A for a light observation helicopter as the OH-58 Kiowa.

The basic shape and design of the JetRanger remained unchanged since 1967, but Bell introduced the 206B JetRanger II in 1971. In 1977, the 206B-3 JetRanger III was introduced with its modified tail rotor and more powerful engine. The JetRanger is popular with news media for traffic and news reporting. The LongRanger is commonly used as an air ambulance and as a corporate transport. On September 1, 1982, pilots H. Ross Perot, Jr. and Jay Coburn departed Dallas, Texas in the &quot;Spirit of Texas&quot;, a Bell 206L-2 (N3911Z). They returned on 30 September, 29 days and 3 hours later, completing the first around-the-world helicopter flight.

The Bell 206B was first introduced to the Canadian market shortly after its certification in 1967. Its early adoption was driven by the booming resource industries of the time, particularly in oil and gas exploration, mining, and forestry. Its light weight, combined with the ability to land in rugged, remote locations, made it an ideal tool for transporting geologists, surveyors, and equipment to otherwise inaccessible areas of Canada&#x27;s vast wilderness.

In the 1970s and 1980s, the JetRanger became a critical part of exploration in northern Canada, including the Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Arctic regions, where harsh weather conditions and rough terrain demanded a helicopter that could perform in all environments. The Bell 206B&#x27;s durability and low operating cost also made it a favorite for these long, sometimes dangerous missions.

In 1983, Australian businessman Dick Smith became the first helicopter pilot to complete a solo trip around the world in 260 flight hours. During the trip, he landed his 206B-3 (S/N 3653; VH-DIK) on prepositioned container ships to refuel between Japan and the Aleutian Islands.

In 1993, the U.S. Army chose the Bell 206B-3 as the winner of the New Training Helicopter competition, to serve as its primary training helicopter, the TH-67 Creek. The number of TH-67s being divested by the Army is too small to impact civilian markets.

On July 22, 1994, Ron Bower landed his 206B-3 (N206AJ) at Hurst, Texas, setting a new record for around-the-world flight by a helicopter. Bower had departed on June 24 and returned 24 days, 4 hours, 36 minutes and 24 seconds later, averaging 35.62 knots (40.99 mph, 65.97 km/h). Bower had added a auxiliary fuel tank, which doubled the JetRanger III&#x27;s range.

== Notable accidents and incidents ==
On August 1, 1977, famous U-2 spy plane pilot Francis Gary Powers was piloting a helicopter for KNBC Channel 4 over West Los Angeles, California, when the aircraft crashed, killing him and cameraman George Spears. They had been video recording brush fires in Santa Barbara County in the station&#x27;s helicopter and were leaving the area.

On August 27, 1990, musician Stevie Ray Vaughan, pilot Jeff Brown, and three members of Eric Clapton&#x27;s crew, Bobby Brooks, Nigel Browne, and Colin Smythe, were killed in a 206B crash.

On October 25, 1991, a Bell 206 carrying rock music concert promoter Bill Graham, his girlfriend Melissa Gold, and pilot Steve Kahn crashed into a transmission tower west of Vallejo, California, killing everyone on board. The cause of the accident was determined to be the pilot&#x27;s intentional flight into known adverse weather conditions.

On January 12, 1994, an Agusta-Bell 206A-1 crashed while attempting to land at the helipad of the Central Command headquarters in Neve Yaakov, killing all four occupants on board, including IDF Major General Nehemiah Tamari.

On March 9, 2009, Bangladesh Army aviation unit Bell 206L flown by pilot Lt Col MD Shahidul Islam and co-pilot Major Saif crashed at Rouha in Kalihati sub-district. The helicopter was carrying General Officer Commanding of 55 Infantry Division and Jessore Area Commander Maj Gen Rafiqul Islam. Maj Gen Islam and pilot Lt Col Islam died in the crash while co-pilot Major Saif sustained serious injuries.

On August 20, 2014, Guatemala&#x27;s Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces Rudy Ortiz was killed when his Bell 206 crashed.

On February 11, 2019, Brazilian journalist Ricardo Boechat and the pilot were killed when Bell 206B, PT-HPG, crashed into a truck while attempting an emergency landing on a highway.

<doc id="1315343" wikidata="Q1076672" url="?curid=1315343" title="Chota, Ecuador">
<text>The upper valley of the Mira River, called the Chota River in its upstream portion, in northern Ecuador, and the small villages in it are usually referred to as &#x27;El Chota&#x27;, and it runs east–west between the two ranges of the Andes. It lies in the provinces of Imbabura, Carchi and (to the west) Esmeraldas. The river and its upper valley are situated about halfway between the equator and the Colombian border. Accessed off Route 35, the nearest major city is Quito, but Ibarra is the major market centre just south of the valley. It is reputed to be where the best soccer players in the country tend to come from.

In the only village actually named el Chota, Spanish-speaking black Creole villagers have a resident Catholic priest and community centers, but there are eleven other Afro-Ecuadorean villages with more than 100 inhabitants in the upper Chota (El Juncal, Piquiucho, Chalguayacu, et al.). The Quechua-speaking farmers and mestizo landowners live where there is rain for agriculture, more than 250 m. above the valley bottomlands higher up in the Andes mountains. All the &quot;parroquias&quot; (provincial administrative centers) presiding over the Valley —except Ambuquí— are at those elevations. Located beside the Chota River, the Chotans (&quot;choteños&quot;) live from growing sugar cane, making aguardiente (cane brandy) and a range of other irrigated crops (tomatoes, avocados and beans) and raising pigs and goats. The valley bottom lies at around 1700 metres but the Panamerican Highway to the north rises quickly to over 3000 metres high.

The majority of Chota Valley people are of African descent. Their ancestors were brought here as slaves during the colonial period, particularly when many of the great sugar estates were owned and organised by the Jesuits. According to research done in the 1960s, the Jesuit administrator in Panamá City purchased 100 slaves that were sent via the coast to work the cane fields after the lands were donated to the Society of Jesus, the previous &quot;encomendado&quot; having worked his native residents to death during a malaria outbreak. Oral history claims almost all the black residents of the valley descend from the named list of 74 survivors of the trek, who arrived in 1775. [Esmeraldas, to the west, is the main home of people of African descent in the country. These people are supposedly descendants of slaves escaping from wrecked slave ships, just as is the African descendant population of the Choco in Colombia.] Similar African descendant populations, occur in the hot valley south of Cuenca in southern Ecuador and, to the north in Colombia, in the Patía valley.

The Chota valley is somewhat culturally unique as a black settlement in Hispanic America located far from the lowlands. Afro-Bolivians of the Yungas are similarly located away from coastal areas. Because they have preserved some of their ancestral cultures and absorbed traditions of their predominately indigenous neighbors, rather than other Afro-Latino cultures, they are cultural isolates.

The climate in the upper Chota valley can be hot or cool, but is consistently dusty. The valley bottom is dry (around 100–250 mm. annually) and temperatures range between 16 and 29 degrees Celsius. The river valley descends towards the coast after leaving the Chota and passes through cloud forest into coastal ecology that is much more humid. Annual flooding and landslides are a dangerous problem in the rainy season. Homes are simple and most are one or two rooms only. They are now made of cinder blocks although some of the traditional wattle and daub of grass and reeds remain beside adobe houses. Plantain, reed and palm branch thatch were traditionally used for roofing. Modern houses may have roofs of galvanized iron sheets, &quot;tejas&quot; (curved ceramic tiles) or other materials.

The Chota valley has recently become the site of much community tourism, in which travelers can live with families and experience the valley&#x27;s culture, its unique Spanish and &quot;bomba&quot; music. The change in economy since 2000 has brought in many mestizo business-owners without providing much involvement or direct work for the traditional valley residents.

<text>Artvin Province (; Armenian: Արտվինի նահանգ &quot;Artvini nahang&quot;; , &quot;Artvinis p&#x27;rovintsia&quot;; Laz: ართვინიშ დობადონა &quot;Artvinish dobadona;&quot;) is a province in Turkey, on the Black Sea coast in the northeastern corner of the country, on the border with Georgia. Artvin also borders the Turkish provinces of Erzurum, Ardahan and Rize. Its area is 7,393 km2, and its population is 169,403 (2022). The provincial capital is the city of Artvin.

==Geography==

Artvin is an attractive area of steep valleys carved by the Çoruh River system, surrounded by high mountains of Kaçkar, Karçal and Yalnızçam (up to 3900 m) and forest with much national parkland including the Karagöl-Sahara, which contains the Şavşat and Borçka lakes. The weather in Artvin is very wet and mild at the coast, and as a result is heavily forested. This greenery runs from the top all the way down to the Black Sea coast. The rain turns to snow at higher altitudes, and the peaks are very cold in winter.

The forests are home to brown bears and wolves. The Çoruh is now being dammed in 11 places for hydro-electric power, including the 249 m Deriner Dam and others at Borçka and Muratlı.

Local industries include bee-keeping especially in Macahel region.

Artvin is traversed by the northeasterly line of equal latitude and longitude.

==Demographics==

In addition to the ethnic Turks, the province is home to communities of Laz people and Hemshin peoples. Autochthonous Muslim Georgians form the majority in parts of Artvin Province east of the Çoruh River. Immigrant groups of Georgian origins, found scattered in Turkey are known as Chveneburi. In particular, there is a prominent community of Chveneburi Georgians many of them descendants of Muslim families from Georgia who migrated during the struggles between the Ottoman Empire and Russian Empire during the 19th century. With such diverse peoples, Artvin has a rich variety of folk song and dance (see Arifana and Kochari for examples of folk culture).

<text>Neetu Kapoor (née Singh; born Harneet Kaur; 8 July 1958) is an Indian actress who is known for appearing in Hindi films throughout the late 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s. In 2012, Kapoor was inducted into the Walk of the Stars, an entertainment hall of fame at Bandra Bandstand in Mumbai. She is the recipient of several accolades, including two Filmfare Award nominations. 

Kapoor made her debut in the swashbuckler film &quot;Suraj&quot; (1966) and thereafter played a dual role in the romantic comedy &quot;Do Kaliyaan&quot; (1968). She began her transition to mature roles with the vigilante film &quot;Rickshawala&quot; (1973) and had her breakthrough with Nasir Hussain&#x27;s masala film &quot;Yaadon Ki Baaraat&quot; (1973), where she appeared as a dancer. She rose to prominence with roles in the crime drama film &quot;Deewaar&quot; (1975), the thriller film &quot;Khel Khel Mein&quot; (1975), the musical film &quot;Kabhi Kabhie&quot; (1976), the masala film &quot;Amar Akbar Anthony&quot; (1977) and the fantasy film &quot;Dharam Veer&quot; (1977). Her performances in the crime drama film &quot;Parvarish&quot; (1977), the horror film &quot;Jaani Dushman&quot; (1979), the disaster film &quot;Kaala Patthar&quot; (1979) and the musical film &quot;Yaarana&quot; (1981) were praised, and for &quot;Kaala Patthar&quot;, she was nominated for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress. 

In 1980, she married actor Rishi Kapoor, with whom she had two children, including the actor Ranbir Kapoor. She went on a hiatus after appearing in the thriller film &quot;Ganga Meri Maa&quot; (1983). Nearly three decades later, she made her acting comeback with a minor role in the romantic comedy &quot;Love Aaj Kal&quot; (2009). She has since led the comedy film &quot;Do Dooni Chaar&quot; (2010) which won her a Zee Cine Award, the action film &quot;Besharam&quot; (2013), made a guest appearance in the romantic drama &quot;Jab Tak Hai Jaan&quot; (2012) and starred in the film &quot;Jugjugg Jeeyo&quot; (2022), which earned her another nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress.

== Early life ==
Neetu Singh was born on 8 July 1958, as Harneet Kaur in New Delhi to Punjabi Sikh parents, Darshan Singh and Rajee Kaur Singh. She began acting as a child artist shortly after her father&#x27;s death.

==Career==

Singh entered films as an uncredited child artist in &quot;Suraj&quot; (1966) starring Vyjayanthimala and Rajendra Kumar. This was followed by appearances in other top-grossing films like &quot;Dus Lakh&quot; (1966), &quot;Do Kaliyaan&quot; (1968), &quot;Waris&quot; (1969), and &quot;Ghar Ghar Ki Kahani&quot; (1970). She was particularly appreciated for playing the double role of twin sisters in &quot;Do Kaliyaan&quot;. In most of these films, she was credited as Baby Sonia.

In 1973, she played her first lead role in &quot;Rickshawala&quot; opposite Randhir Kapoor. The film was a remake of the Tamil film &quot;Rickshawkaran&quot; (1971), but failed to match the success of this film. Later that year, however, Singh garnered mainstream attention for her appearance in a popular song &quot;Lekar Hum Deewana Dil&quot; from Nasir Hussain&#x27;s blockbuster film &quot;Yaadon Ki Baaraat&quot; (1973).

The romantic films &quot;Rafoo Chakkar&quot; (1975) and &quot;Khel Khel Mein&quot; (1975) established her and Rishi Kapoor as a popular on-screen pair, and they were subsequently cast in several more films together. &quot;Khel Khel Mein&quot; in particular was propelled by the success of R.D. Burman&#x27;s soundtrack. She gained further commercial success in &quot;Shankar Dada&quot; (1976) opposite Shashi Kapoor and (1976) opposite Rajesh Khanna.

Her two most prominent films in this time period were &quot;Deewaar&quot; (1975) and &quot;Kabhi Kabhie&quot; (1976), both ensemble films directed by leading filmmaker Yash Chopra. In the action drama &quot;Deewaar&quot;, she played the vivacious love interest to Shashi Kapoor. The ensemble musical romantic drama &quot;Kabhi Kabhie&quot;, which featured her as an adoptee determined to find her birth mother, was one of the most acclaimed films of that time and continues to be remembered today for its soundtrack by Khayyam and Sahir Ludhianvi.

Singh&#x27;s most successful release of 1977 was &quot;Amar Akbar Anthony&quot;, directed by veteran filmmaker Manmohan Desai, in which she played a young doctor in love with a singer played by Rishi Kapoor. In the same year, Desai also cast her in the adventure film &quot;Dharam Veer&quot; opposite Jeetendra and the crime drama &quot;Parvarish&quot; opposite Amitabh Bachchan. All three of these films ranked among the top five highest-grossing films of the year, with &quot;Amar Akbar Anthony&quot; taking the top spot.

For the next few years, Singh achieved success as the solo female lead in films like &quot;Priyatama&quot; (1977), &quot;Maha Badmaash&quot; (1977), &quot;Dhongee&quot; (1979), and &quot;Chorni&quot; (1982). She was also featured in a number of popular ensemble films like &quot;Adalat&quot; (1977), &quot;Kasme Vaade&quot; (1978), &quot;Jaani Dushman&quot; (1979), &quot;Kaala Patthar&quot; (1979), &quot;The Burning Train&quot; (1980), &quot;Yaarana&quot; (1981), and &quot;Teesri Aankh&quot; (1982). In these films, her most successful associations were with actors like Jeetendra, Amitabh Bachchan, and Randhir Kapoor. For Yash Chopra&#x27;s &quot;Kaala Patthar&quot;, she earned her first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress.

After her marriage in 1980, she retired from acting. Her last film to be released was &quot;Ganga Meri Maa&quot; (1983). 

After a 25-year hiatus, Singh made her comeback with a cameo appearance in Imtiaz Ali&#x27;s romantic comedy-drama &quot;Love Aaj Kal&quot; (2009), opposite her husband as the older version of his love interest in the film. 

Singh&#x27;s first lead role post-retirement was that of a middle-class Punjabi mother in Habib Faisal&#x27;s &quot;Do Dooni Chaar&quot; (2010), which won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi. She then made a special appearance in Yash Chopra&#x27;s swan song &quot;Jab Tak Hai Jaan&quot; (2012), and also co-starred with her son Ranbir Kapoor in the comedy &quot;Besharam&quot; (2013). After 9 years, she ended her hiatus by starring opposite Anil Kapoor in &quot;Jug Jugg Jeeyo&quot;. Her performance earned her second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress.

==Personal life==

During production of the film &quot;Kabhie Kabhie&quot;, Singh and actor Rishi Kapoor became romantically involved off-screen. The pair married on 22 January 1980. Their children are Riddhima Kapoor Sahni (born 15 September 1980) and Ranbir Kapoor (born 28 September 1982). Riddhima is a fashion designer who married Delhi-based industrialist Bharat Sahni on 25 January 2006. Their daughter is Samara Sahni (born 23 March 2011). Ranbir is an Indian actor who married actress Alia Bhatt on 14 April 2022. Their daughter is Raha Kapoor (born 6 November 2022).

Following a recurring battle with leukemia and treatment in New York City, Rishi Kapoor died on 30 April 2020. During the filming of &quot;Jug Jugg Jeeyo&quot;, she tested positive for COVID-19 in Chandigarh in December 2020. However, she recovered after an isolation period, returning to the film&#x27;s sets in early January 2021.

== Legacy ==
Singh is regarded as one of the most recognised actresses of Indian cinema. In 2022, she was placed in &quot;Outlook India&quot;″s &quot;75 Best Bollywood Actresses&quot; list. One of the highest paid actress of late 1970s, Singh appeared in &quot;Box Office India&quot;″s &quot;Top Actresses&quot; list 1975 and 1977. She was inducted into the Walk of the Stars, at Bandra Bandstand, where her hand print was preserved under her married name Neetu Kapoor.

<text>&quot;The Vane Sisters&quot; is a short story by Vladimir Nabokov, written in March 1951. It is famous for providing one of the most extreme examples of an unreliable narrator. It was first published in the Winter 1958 issue of &quot;The Hudson Review&quot; and then reprinted in &quot;Encounter&quot; during 1959. The story was included in &quot;Nabokov&#x27;s Quartet&quot; (1966), &quot;Nabokov&#x27;s Congeries&quot; (1968; reprinted as &quot;The Portable Nabokov&quot;, 1971), &quot;Tyrants Destroyed and Other Stories&quot; (1975), and &quot;The Stories of Vladimir Nabokov&quot; (1995).

The narrator, a professor, recounts his experiences with the two sisters, and meditates upon the possibility of intervention by ghosts into his reality.

==Plot summary==

On his usual Sunday afternoon stroll, the narrator, a French literature professor at a women&#x27;s college, watches icicles dripping from a nearby eave with intense meditation. He walks on, and is distracted by the reddish shadows cast by a parking meter and restaurant sign. He runs into D., a former colleague who casually informs him that Cynthia Vane, with whom the narrator had formerly had a short relationship, has died.

The narrator recounts his memories of Cynthia and her younger sister Sybil. The married D. had an affair with the narrator&#x27;s student Sybil. Cynthia first approaches the narrator in hopes of recruiting him to end the affair, instructing the narrator to tell D. that he should either divorce his wife or resign. He confronts D., who tells the narrator that he and his wife are moving to Albany, ending the affair.

The following day, the narrator gives his French literature class, which includes Sybil, an examination. When marking Sybil&#x27;s exam that night, he finds a suicide note. He calls Cynthia only to find that Sybil has committed suicide.

After Sybil&#x27;s death, the narrator begins seeing Cynthia and immerses himself in her philosophies of spiritualism and the occult. He attends parties along with Cynthia&#x27;s circle of believers, and listens keenly to her theory that the dead control events great and small. Unconvinced, the narrator ridicules Cynthia&#x27;s searches for acrostics, and playfully criticizes her party guests, to which Cynthia fiercely reacts by calling him a &quot;prig&quot; and &quot;snob.&quot; This ends their relationship.

The story returns to the narrator&#x27;s encounter with D. Having learnt of Cynthia&#x27;s death, he is suddenly frantic, fearful, and incapable of sleep, preoccupied with the idea of Cynthia&#x27;s ghost returning to haunt him as her philosophies suggested. He tries to fight her spirit by searching for acrostics in Shakespeare. His search fruitless, he falls asleep and awakens to find everything seemingly in order. He scoffs at the &quot;disappointing&quot; show, and the final paragraph reads:

==Acrostic==

At one point, the narrator alludes to a &quot;novel or short story (by some contemporary writer, I believe) in which, unknown to the author, the first letters of the words in its last paragraph formed, as &quot;Deciphered by Cynthia, a message from his dead mother.&quot;

When the final paragraph of the story is subjected to this technique, the result is as follows: &quot;Icicles by Cynthia. Meter from me Sybil.&quot; The icicles and meter are references to the story&#x27;s beginning where the narrator, who prides himself on his careful attention to detail, is transfixed by the minute effects of dripping icicles and shadows cast by a parking meter. Thus, this is the Nabokovian twist: at the end of the short story, the reader learns that the narrator is being unconsciously and mockingly influenced in both his writing and the events surrounding him by the dead sisters.

The very name of Sybil hints at the trick of the final paragraph, as the word &quot;acrostic&quot; was first applied to the prophecies of the Erythraean Sibyl, which were written on leaves and arranged so that the initial letters of the leaves always formed a word. Sybil Vane is also a character in Oscar Wilde&#x27;s only novel &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; (1890). She is an actress who commits suicide when Dorian rejects her, first causing the portrait to change and Dorian to notice the connection between him and the portrait.

==Literary significance==
The apparent uniqueness of this narrative approach has created fame for this story, and Nabokov himself described this device as something that &#x27;can only be tried once in a thousand years of fiction&#x27;. The trick ending of &quot;The Vane Sisters&quot; originally went unnoticed when the &quot;New Yorker&quot; rejected the story, and it was only revealed when Nabokov wrote a letter to the fiction editor, Katharine A. White, explaining the foundation of the story.

<doc id="1315380" wikidata="Q258596" url="?curid=1315380" title="Blue Train (album)">
<text>Blue Train is a studio album by the jazz saxophonist and composer John Coltrane. It was released through Blue Note Records in January 1958. It is Coltrane&#x27;s only session as leader for Blue Note. The recording took place at Rudy Van Gelder&#x27;s studio on September 15, 1957.

Coltrane wrote four of the record&#x27;s five tracks. His playing exhibits early elements of the signature style for which he later became known. &quot;Blue Train&quot; attained a gold sales certification by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2001.

==Background==

The album was recorded in the midst of Coltrane&#x27;s residency at the Five Spot as a member of the Thelonious Monk quartet. The personnel include Coltrane&#x27;s Miles Davis bandmates, Paul Chambers on bass and Philly Joe Jones on drums, both of whom had worked before with pianist Kenny Drew. Both trumpeter Lee Morgan and trombonist Curtis Fuller were up-and-coming jazz musicians, and both were members of Art Blakey&#x27;s Jazz Messengers in due course. Unlike his previous label, Blue Note paid the musicians to rehearse the music for a couple of days before the recording session.

=== Composition ===
All of the compositions were written by Coltrane, with the exception of the standard &quot;I&#x27;m Old Fashioned&quot;. Though at this point his compositions used conventional diatonic harmonies, they were set in unconventional ways. The title track is a bluesy song with a quasi-minor (Eb7#9) theme. &quot;Locomotion&quot; is also a blues riff tune, in forty-four-bar form. &quot;Lazy Bird&quot; is in part a transposition into the key of &quot;G&quot; of the Tadd Dameron composition &quot;Lady Bird&quot;.

=== Style ===
Coltrane&#x27;s playing exhibits the move toward what would become his signature style. His solos are more harmonic or &quot;vertical&quot; and lines arpeggiated. His timing was often apart from or over the beat, rather than playing on or behind it. During a 1960 interview, Coltrane described &quot;Blue Train&quot; as his favorite album of his own up to that point.

John Coltrane&#x27;s next major album, &quot;Giant Steps&quot;, recorded in 1959, would break new melodic and harmonic ground in jazz, whereas &quot;Blue Train&quot; adheres to the hard bop style of the era. Musicologist Lewis Porter has also demonstrated a harmonic relationship between Coltrane&#x27;s &quot;Lazy Bird&quot; and Tadd Dameron&#x27;s &quot;Lady Bird&quot;.

While on Joe Vella&#x27;s podcast &quot;Traneumentary&quot;, Michael Cuscuna, the reissue producer at Blue Note, commented:We’re listening to Blue Train, which to me is one of the most beautiful pieces on one of the most beautiful records that Coltrane recorded in the fifties. It’s his first real mature statement and he wrote all but one of the tunes on this album which was very rare in the fifties and each one is a gem, particularly the title tune Blue Train. And while it’s kind of easy to play the blues, this has a suspended and haunting kind of quality to it.

=== Reissues and certification ===
It had sold more than half a million copies by April 2001 and thus was certified with a gold sales certification by the Recording Industry Association of America the following year.

In 1997, &quot;The Ultimate Blue Train&quot; was released, adding two alternate takes and enhanced content, and in 1999 a 24bit 192 kHz DVD-Audio version was issued. In 2003, both a Super Audio Compact Disc version was released, as well as a remastered compact disc as part of Blue Note&#x27;s Rudy Van Gelder series.

In 2015, Blue Note/Universal released a Blu-ray audio edition of the album with four bonus tracks, one of which is a previously unreleased take of &quot;Lazy Bird&quot;. Alternate takes of &quot;Moment&#x27;s Notice&quot; were released on &quot;Blue Train: The Complete Masters&quot;, in 2022.

==Reception==
In 2000 it was voted number 339 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. He stated &quot;Coltrane may have made more important albums, but none swung as effectively as this one.

<doc id="1315408" wikidata="Q909396" url="?curid=1315408" title="New Fourth Army incident">
<text>The New Fourth Army Incident (), also known as the South Anhui Incident or Wannan Incident (), occurred in China in January 1941 during the Second Sino-Japanese War, during which the Chinese Civil War was in theory suspended, uniting the Communists and Nationalists under a United Front against the Japanese. It is significant as the end of real cooperation between the Nationalists and Communists. Today, ROC and PRC historians view the New Fourth Army Incident differently. From the ROC point of view, the Communists attacked first and it was a punishment for the Communist insubordination; from the PRC view, it was Nationalist treachery.

== Causes ==
=== ROC viewpoint ===
In the fall of 1940, the Communist New Fourth Army attacked Nationalist forces under Han Deqin. Also, Benton&#x27;s book &quot;New Fourth Army&quot; argues the Communists first attacked the Nationalists and the Nationalists fought back against the Communists. 

=== PRC viewpoint ===
For PRC historians the incident began in December 1940, when Chiang Kai-shek ordered Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army to withdraw from Anhui and Jiangsu to the north of the old Yellow River track in a month. In response, the Communist Party only agreed to move the New Fourth Army troops in Southern Anhui (Wannan) to the northern shore of the Yangtze River. On 4 January, the 9000-strong force started to move from Yunling Township in Jing County towards Jiangsu, planning to cross the river along three routes.

== Ambush ==
On January 5, the Communist forces were surrounded in Maolin Township by a Nationalist force of 80,000 led by Shangguan Yunxiang and attacked days later. After days of fighting, heavy losses – including many civilian workers who staffed the army&#x27;s political headquarters – were inflicted on the New Fourth Army due to the overwhelming numbers of Nationalist troops. On January 13, Ye Ting, wanting to save his men, went to Shangguan Yunxiang&#x27;s headquarters to negotiate terms. Upon arrival, Ye was detained. The New Fourth Army&#x27;s political commissar Xiang Ying was killed, and only 2,000 people, led by Huang Huoxing and Fu Qiutao, were able to break out.

== Aftermath ==
Chiang Kai-shek ordered the New Fourth Army disbanded on January 17, and sent Ye Ting to a military tribunal. However, on January 20, the Chinese Communist Party in Yan&#x27;an ordered the reorganization of the army. Chen Yi was the new army commander. Liu Shaoqi was the political commissar. The new headquarters was in Jiangsu, which was now the general headquarters for the New Fourth Army and the Eighth Route Army. Together, they comprised seven divisions and one independent brigade, totalling over 90,000 troops.

Because of this incident, according to the Chinese Communist Party, the Nationalist Party of China was criticized for creating internal strife when the Chinese were supposed to be united against the Japanese; the Chinese Communist Party, on the other hand, was seen as heroes at the vanguard of the fight against the Japanese and Nationalist treachery. Although as a result of this incident, the Communist Party lost possession of the lands south of Yangtze River, it drew the party support from the population, which strengthened their foundations north of Yangtze River.

According to the Nationalist Party, this incident was retribution to numerous occasions of treachery and harassment by the New Fourth Army.

The novelist Mao Dun&#x27;s story &quot;Fushi&quot; is about this incident.

<doc id="1315410" wikidata="Q7960569" url="?curid=1315410" title="Waiting for Lefty">
<text>Waiting for Lefty is a 1935 play by the American playwright Clifford Odets; it was his first play to be produced. Consisting of a series of related vignettes, the entire play is framed by a meeting of cab drivers who are planning a labor strike. The framing uses the audience as part of the meeting.

The play debuted on Sunday, January 6, 1935, at the Civic Repertory Theatre on 14th Street, as part of a benefit performance for &quot;New Theatre&quot; magazine. It premiered on Broadway at the Longacre Theatre on March 26, 1935, under the auspices of the Group Theatre, a New York City theatre company founded by Harold Clurman, Cheryl Crawford and Lee Strasberg, of which Odets was a member. The company was founded as a training ground for actors, and also to support new plays, especially those that expressed the social and political climate of the day. The play was requested by many theater and labor groups in numerous other cities around the United States. It premiered in London in 1936 at Unity Theatre, and was revived there most recently in 2013.

==Plot==
The play is composed of seven vignettes. The first takes place at a union meeting of taxi drivers, where union boss Harry Fatt tries to dissuade the men from striking. A few drivers ask of the whereabouts of Lefty, their elected chairman. Fatt reminds them their elected committee is already present, then lets Joe, one of the drivers, speak. Joe says that he is not a &quot;red boy&quot;, citing his status as a wounded war veteran, but complains that any driver who expresses dissatisfaction with working conditions is labelled a &quot;red&quot; (slang for communist) by the bosses. He says his wife has convinced him to strike for higher wages.

In the second vignette, set a week before that union meeting, Joe comes home to find that his furniture, not yet paid for, was repossessed. Joe&#x27;s wife Edna urges him to lead a strike and demand a living wage. Joe argues that strikes do not work and that he would lose money while on strike. Edna criticizes the union as benefitting only its leaders. Joe admits the union bosses are &quot;racketeers&quot; but refuses to stand up to them. Edna announces she is going back to her old boyfriend, since he earns a living. Joe protests, and Edna implores Joe to start a workers&#x27; union without the racketeers. Joe, swept up by her passion, tells her he is going to find Lefty Costello.

The next vignette features Fayette, an industrialist, and Miller, a lab assistant. Fayette raises Miller&#x27;s salary as a reward for his loyalty, and reassigns him to a new laboratory where Miller will help create poisonous gas for chemical warfare. Miller loses enthusiasm, but Fayette believes the world is on the brink of war, and that the U.S. must be ready. Miller grows distraught, reminiscing about his brother who died in the previous war. Fayette expects Miller to provide a weekly confidential report on the project&#x27;s leader Dr. Brenner. Miller refuses to do any &quot;spying&quot;, insisting he would rather lose his job than agree to such terms. Miller&#x27;s outrage grows and he punches Fayette in the mouth.

In the fourth vignette, Florence tells her brother Irv that she loves her boyfriend Sid. Irv urges her to break up with Sid, since he earns too little money as a taxi driver. Sid enters and Irv exits. Sid says he knows he is like &quot;rat poison&quot; to her family and knows that she is reconsidering whether to marry him. He laments their lowly status as &quot;dogs&quot; under the thumb of powerful rich men. He is upset that his brother, a college boy, has swallowed the &quot;money men&#x27;s&quot; propaganda and joined the navy to fight foreigners who are, ultimately, just like himself. Florence says she will follow Sid anywhere, but he tells her to be realistic.

Back at the union meeting, Fatt brings up Tom Clayton, who took part in an unsuccessful strike in Philadelphia. Clayton says that his experience taught him that Fatt is right about not striking. Clayton&#x27;s brother runs into the meeting and identifies Clayton as a company spy who has been breaking up various unions for years. Clayton leaves and his brother voices skepticism of Fatt&#x27;s claimed ignorance of Clayton&#x27;s true identity.

The next vignette occurs in the hospital office of the elderly Dr. Barnes. The younger Dr. Benjamin enters, upset that he has been replaced for surgery on a patient in the charity ward by an incompetent doctor named Leeds, the nephew of a senator. Barnes reveals that the hospital is shutting the charity ward because it is losing money. It is also firing some staff, including Benjamin. Though Benjamin has seniority, he is being fired because he is Jewish. Barnes takes a phone call and learns that the patient has died in surgery. Benjamin is furious, saying he was skeptical of the ideas of radicals until now, and vowing to fight on even if it means death.

A man named Agate talks to the taxi drivers, insulting their weakness and insulting Fatt. Fatt and his armed guard try to detain him, but Agate eludes them. Agate says that if &quot;we&#x27;re reds because we wanna strike, then we take over their salute too!&quot; He makes a Communist salute. Agate incites the drivers with fiery rhetoric about the rich killing them off. He tells them to &quot;unite and fight!&quot; and not to wait for Lefty, who may never arrive. A man runs in and reports that Lefty has just been found, shot dead. Agate yells to his fellow union men, &quot;Workers of the world... Our Bones and Blood!&quot; and leads them in a chorus of &quot;Strike!&quot;

==Sources==
The play&#x27;s strike and union meeting scenes were inspired by a forty-day strike of New York City cab drivers in 1934. Odets published the play in &quot;New Theatre&quot; magazine with the subtitle &quot;A Play in Six Scenes, Based on the New York City Taxi Strike of February 1934.&quot; The historic strike was led by Samuel Orner, after he was fired for failing to make enough money for the cab company on a particular night shift. According to Orner, Odets based the meeting scene on a real meeting in the Bronx where Orner had addressed his fellow cab drivers: &quot;He must have taken notes because so many lines in &quot;Waiting For Lefty&quot; were the same as in the meeting, almost word for word.&quot; 

In the play, the cabdrivers find Lefty dead at the end. In the 1934 strike, Orner was found drugged and unconscious on the night of the union meeting, but he was roused and taken there before the vote was called. He rallied the drivers to reject the owners&#x27; contract offer.

During the political attacks on communism and artists of the left in the 1950s in the United States, Odets distanced himself from having used the 1934 strike. In his 1950s testimony to the House Un-American Activities Committee, Odets denied that he had based his play on that strike or been to a union meeting of cab drivers. Odets said, &quot;It is just something I kind of made up...I didn&#x27;t know anything about a taxicab strike...I have never been near a strike in my life.&quot;

According to literary historian Christopher Herr, rather than trying to create a historical account, Odets used the strike as a symbol to attack what he saw as the larger issue: that in the middle of the Great Depression, the capitalist structures of the time had remained unaltered.

==Productions==
Odets&#x27; stage directions call for the play to be performed on a bare stage, with some actors planted in the audience to react to key moments. The characters often directly address the audience, in an effort to break the fourth wall and incite the viewer to action. In each scene the other characters continue to be dimly present in a circle around the current characters, illustrating their effect on the events unfolding before them. Odets claimed that he took this form from minstrel shows. Critics have suggested that it is more likely that Odets was inspired by agitprop productions, which were gaining popularity in the early 1930s.

&quot;Waiting For Lefty&quot; premiered on January 6, 1935, for an audience of 1,400 at the Civic Repertory Theatre, at a benefit for &quot;New Theatre&quot; magazine. The play cost about eight dollars to produce. The audience was greatly moved and met the play with acclaim; the cast that night took 28 curtain calls. 

The play opened on Broadway at the Longacre Theater on March 26, 1935, and continued for 144 performances. It was directed by Odets and Sanford Meisner, and its cast included Odets, Meisner, Elia Kazan and Lee J. Cobb. It moved to the Belasco Theater in September of that year for 24 performances in repertoire with Odets&#x27;s play &quot;Awake and Sing!&quot;, where its cast included Luther Adler.

Following the initial run, hundreds of theatre groups requested the rights to perform the piece. The play resonated with both the general public and the artistic community. Its simple staging allowed it to become an affordable and popular production for union halls and small theatres across the country. The play resulted in widespread praise and recognition for Odets. Such was Odets&#x27; fame that his next play to be produced, &quot;Awake and Sing!&quot;, was billed as a piece &quot;by the author of &quot;Waiting for Lefty&quot; &quot;.

During the opening performance of &quot;Waiting for Lefty&quot; in Boston in 1935, four cast members were placed under arrest due to Boston&#x27;s strict censorship laws.

&quot;Waiting for Lefty&quot; had its British premiere in 1936 at the Unity Theatre. The production so impressed a visiting contingent of the American Group Theatre that they gave Unity Theatre the British rights to the play.

In Australia, the New Theatre in Sydney and Melbourne&#x27;s New Theatre both staged the play in 1936.

In February and March 2013, a revival of the play was produced at the White Bear Theatre in Kennington. It was the first time in more than 30 years that the play had been performed in London.

==Critical reception==
Harold Clurman said of the performance:
The first scene of &quot;[Waiting for] Lefty&quot; had not played two minutes when a shock of delighted recognition struck the audience like a tidal wave. Deep laughter, hot assent, a kind of joyous fervor seemed to sweep the audience toward the stage. The actors no longer performed; they were being carried along as if by an exultancy of communication such as I had never witnessed in the theater before. Audience and actors had become one.
Only one Broadway reviewer was present at the premiere: Henry Senber, second-string drama critic for &quot;The Morning Telegraph&quot;. He wrote Odets&#x27; first Broadway review. 
&quot;One left the theatre Sunday evening with two convictions,&quot; Senber wrote. &quot;The first was that one had witnessed an event of historical importance in what is academically referred to as the drama of the contemporary American scene. The other was that a dramatist to be reckoned with had been discovered.&quot; He concluded, &quot;It has not been announced just where and when &quot;Waiting for Lefty&quot; will be presented again, but you can rest assured that it will be ... soon. A play like this does not die.&quot;

While the energy of the performance greatly stimulated the audience, theater critics reacted less positively to the archetypal characters and the play&#x27;s socialist leanings. Joseph Wood Krutch wrote:

The villains are mere caricatures and even the very human heroes occasionally freeze into stained-glass attitudes, as, for example, a certain lady secretary in one of the flashbacks does when she suddenly stops in her tracks to pay tribute to &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; and to urge its perusal upon all and sundry. No one, however, expects subtleties from a soap-box, and the interesting fact is that Mr. Odets has invented a form which turns out to be a very effective dramatic equivalent of soap-box oratory.

<text>John Michael Davison (born 9 May 1970) is a former Canadian professional cricketer who captained the national side in One Day Internationals. He was a hard-hitting right-handed batsman in the top or middle order, and also bowled right-arm off break.

Davison retired in March 2011, playing his last game against Australia at the 2011 World Cup.

==Early life==
He was born in Campbell River, British Columbia to Australian teachers on a one-year teaching exchange, Davison moved to Australia and attended school at St Ignatius&#x27; College, Riverview where he was a member of the 1st XI before playing grade cricket in Sydney for Gordon and Mosman and Melbourne and attending the Australian Cricket Academy in 1993. He was a member of the Victoria state squad for a number of years but was unable to hold down a regular place in the side.

==International career==
In 1999, Davison agreed to spend the Australian winters in Canada as a club player and coach. He quickly became involved with the Canadian national team, representing them in the 2001 ICC Trophy where Canada performed well to qualify for the 2003 Cricket World Cup in South Africa and Zimbabwe.

At the World Cup, Davison made an overnight name for himself, stunning the strong West Indies team with an aggressive innings of 111 (reaching 100 from 67 balls, then the quickest century in World Cup history at that time, and the first One Day International century for Canada), before making a half-century against New Zealand at the incredible strike rate of 200.

Continuing his form for Canada, Davison returned to the national line-up for the 2004 ICC Intercontinental Cup, and was named as captain. He was in inspirational form as Canada overcame rivals USA, top-scoring with 84 in Canada&#x27;s first innings and taking match figures of 17 for 137 (8 for 61 and 9 for 76), the best first-class match figures anywhere in the world since Jim Laker&#x27;s 19 for 90 during the 1956 Ashes.

Davison has continued to represent Canada internationally as captain of the team, and against Bermuda in 2006 he scored his only first-class century, 165 from 175 balls.

Retained as captain of Canada for the 2007 Cricket World Cup, Davison reached 50 against New Zealand from only 23 balls.

==Domestic career==
After his successes for the modest Canadian team at the 2003 World Cup, Davison returned to Australia and continued playing for South Australia, where he had played since 2002 after being released by Victoria.

His form at international level did not help in Australia though as in January 2005, Davison was dropped from the South Australia state squad. He continued to play cricket in Australia at a lower level during the Australian summer. In the 2006–07 season, he played for Mosman in Sydney Grade Cricket and has recently been appointed as a development coach with the Australian Cricket Academy.

==World Cup highlights==
* On 23 February 2003, against the West Indies, Davison scored 111 runs off 76 balls, the first 100 of which were scored off 67 balls – the fastest century in World Cup history at the time, and the fastest century by an associate player in ODI history. In his innings, he hit 6 sixes and 8 fours before eventually falling to a spectacular backwards-leaping catch at the boundary by Vasbert Drakes having attempted to score yet another six. The second-highest score for his team was just 19. He had been dropped on 50 and on 78, and more unusually, escaped when he played a ball onto the stumps without disturbing the bails. Despite his performance, Canada were convincingly beaten by the West Indies, who reached their target of 203 in just over 20 overs.
* On 3 March 2003, against New Zealand, Davison scored 75 runs off 62 balls, reaching his 50 from 25 balls. He also opened the bowling with his off-spin, and took three wickets.
* On 23 March 2007, against New Zealand, Davison reached 50 runs in 23 balls which was the third fastest fifty in World Cup history, behind only Brendon McCullum, who did it in 20 balls in the same match, and Mark Boucher, who took 21 balls six days previously. However, New Zealand went on to win the match by 114 runs.

==Coaching career ==

He was appointed to a new position as Australian spin coach for the 2013–14 Ashes series, particularly mentoring Nathan Lyon.

<doc id="1315426" wikidata="Q80167" url="?curid=1315426" title="List of circulating currencies">
<text>&lt;onlyinclude&gt; 
There are 180 currencies recognized as legal tender in United Nations (UN) member states, UN General Assembly non-member observer states, partially recognized or unrecognized states, and their dependencies. However, excluding the pegged (fixed exchange rate) currencies, there are only 130 currencies that are independent or pegged to a currency basket. Dependencies and unrecognized states are listed here only if another currency is used on their territory that is different from the one of the state that administers them or has jurisdiction over them.

==Criteria for inclusion==
A currency is a kind of money and medium of exchange. Currency includes paper, cotton, or polymer banknotes and metal coins. States generally have a monopoly on the issuing of currency, although some states share currencies with other states. For the purposes of this list, only currencies that are legal tender, including those used in actual commerce or issued for commemorative purposes, are considered &quot;circulating currencies&quot;. This includes fractional units that have no physical form but are recognized by the issuing state, such as the United States &quot;mill&quot;, the Egyptian &quot;millieme&quot;, and the Japanese &quot;rin&quot;.
Currencies used by non-state entities, like the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, scrips used by private entities, and other private, virtual, and alternative currencies are not included on this list.

<doc id="1315438" wikidata="Q5186695" url="?curid=1315438" title="Critical area (aeronautics)">
<text>In aviation, a critical area refers to a designated area of an airport that all aircraft, vehicles, persons or physical obstructions must remain clear of when one or more Instrument Landing Systems (ILS) are in use, to protect against signal interference or attenuation that may lead to navigation errors, or accident. Critical areas also protect the ILS system&#x27;s internal monitoring.

ILS technology delivers two main types of information to pilots. These types include the glideslope (vertical location relative to the designed glide path) and the localizer (lateral position relative to the designed approach course). Each type of information is broadcast using a separate antenna array and each type has a specific critical area:

* Localizer critical area – aircraft/vehicles/persons or physical obstructions are not authorized in or over the critical area when an arriving aircraft is between the ILS final approach fix and the airport.
* Glideslope critical area – aircraft/vehicles/persons or physical obstructions are not authorized in or over the critical area when an arriving aircraft is between the ILS final approach fix and the airport unless the aircraft has reported the airport in sight and is circling or sidestepping to land on a runway other than the ILS runway.

For practical purposes, these two areas are combined into the ILS critical area and identified by signs and pavement markings.

During times of reduced ceilings and visibility (800 ft/2 miles) &quot;or&quot; during ILS autoland (coupled) approaches pilots are expected to:

* Before takeoff – stop aircraft before entering the critical area while waiting for takeoff.
* After landing – move the aircraft out of the critical area before stopping to receive taxi instructions from the ground controller.

Much larger than the critical area is the sensitive area. Aircraft and vehicles are not allowed in this area when low visibility procedures are in force, since aircraft autoland during this time and therefore the accuracy of the guidance signals provided by the ILS is absolutely critical.

Multipathing is a potential error in the ILS system, which may affect the glideslope and/or the localizer. This occurs when the radio signals reaching the aircraft are distorted because a large metal object moves into the radiation zone of the transmitter, such as when an aircraft is flying ahead or a taxiing aircraft or truck enters the ILS critical area.</text><links>

<doc id="1315452" wikidata="Q1387449" url="?curid=1315452" title="Hippostratus">
<text>Hippostratus (, meaning &quot;army of horses&quot;) was an Indo-Greek king who ruled central and north-western Punjab and Pushkalavati. Bopearachchi dates Hippostratus to 65 to 55 BCE whereas R. C. Senior suggests 60 to 50 BCE.

==Rule==
In Bopearachchi&#x27;s reconstruction Hippostratus came to power as the successor to Apollodotus II, in the western part of his kingdom, while the weak Dionysius ascended to the throne in the eastern part. Senior assumes that the reigns of Apollodotus II and Hippostratos overlapped somewhat; in that case Hippostratus first ruled a kingdom situated to the west of Apollodotus&#x27; dominions.

Just like Apollodotus II, Hippostratus calls himself &quot;Soter&quot;, &quot;Saviour&quot;, on all his coins, and on some coins he also assumes the title &quot;Basileos Megas&quot;, &quot;Great King&quot;, which he inherited from Apollodotus II. This may support Senior&#x27;s scenario that Hippostratus extended his kingdom after Apollodotus&#x27; death. The relationship between these two kings remains uncertain due to lack of sources. Hippostratos did not, however, use the symbol of standing Athena Alkidemos, which was common to all other kings thought to be related to Apollodotus II. The two kings share only one monogram.

The quantity and quality of the coinage of Hippostratus indicate a quite powerful king. Hippostratus seems to have fought rather successfully against the Indo-Scythian invaders, led by the Scythian king Azes I, but was ultimately defeated and became the last western Indo-Greek king.

==Coinage==
Hippostratus issued silver coins with a diademed portrait on the obverse, and three reverses. The first is the image of a king on prancing horse, a common type which was most frequently used by the earlier kings Antimachus II and Philoxenus. The second reverse also portrays a king on horseback, but the horse is walking and the king making a benediction gesture - this type resembles a rare type of Apollodotus II. The third is a standing goddess, perhaps Tyche.

Hippostratus struck several bronzes of types used by several kings:
*Serpent-legged deity (as used by Telephus) / standing goddess.
*Apollo/tripod (Apollodotus II, several earlier kings)
*Sitting Zeus-Mithras / horse, reminiscent of coins of Hermaeus.

===Overstrikes===
Azes I overstruck several of Hippostratus&#x27; coins.

<doc id="1315459" wikidata="Q6477857" url="?curid=1315459" title="Lake Street/Midtown station">
<text>Lake Street/Midtown station, also referred locally as either the Lake Street station or Midtown station, is a Blue Line light rail stop in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. The station is located on a bridge over East Lake Street adjacent to Highway 55.

The station offers connections to buses on Lake Street which include Route 21. The future Metro B Line will have stations below the Blue Line station on Lake Street. An eastbound BRT station was built in 2015 and while the west station will be built in 2024 for an expected opening of the B Line in June 2025.

== Description ==
This elevated station spans over East Lake Street along the west side of Minnesota State Highway 55, which is known as Hiawatha Avenue along this stretch of road. This is a center-platform station. Along with the Franklin Avenue station, the Lake Street/Midtown station is one of the two above-grade stations on the Blue Line. Service began at this station when the Blue Line opened on June 26, 2004.

The Midtown Station is one of four stations immediately adjacent to Hiawatha Avenue. Others include 38th Street Station, 46th Street Station, and 50th Street Station. The Hiawatha Corridor features a wide variety of architecture including grain elevators, subsidized housing, and well-established neighborhoods, such as Longfellow and Corcoran.

Just north of the station, the Blue Line crosses over Hiawatha Avenue on a concrete box girder flyover before returning to grade level.

The seasonal Midtown Farmers&#x27; Market operates weekly on a space immediately adjacent to the station. The market features produce, meat, cheese, bread, eggs, flowers, crafts, hot food, music and family-oriented entertainment.

In July 2008, local residents teamed up with Metro Transit and Xcel Energy to decorate several electric boxes situated between the station and the park and ride lot. The murals painted on the structures depict grain stalks on a blue sky, and are intended to represent the Midtown Farmers&#x27; Market held adjacent to the station. Local residents also encouraged Metro Transit to install sidewalks and stairs along lines of bare dirt where riders frequently cut through a sloping grassy area. This improved station access and reduced erosion problems.

This station was planned to serve as the terminus of the Minneapolis Streetcar System&#x27;s Midtown Greenway Line.

==Park and Ride lot==
Upon opening, the station hosted a 170-space park and ride lot immediately southwest of the station, leased from Anishinabe Academy elementary school. The lot was only planned to exist temporarily and close when park and ride lots outside Minneapolis opened.

It was regularly filled beyond capacity, with parking overflowing into aisles and onto nearby streets. Residents have complained about the lack of parking (and specifically the overflow onto streets) at neighborhood meetings. Crime has also been an intermittent problem in the parking lot, with victims attributing the lot&#x27;s poor overhead lighting as a major contributing factor. Local residents and the neighborhood organization called upon Metro Transit to improve the lighting situation, but the process has been complicated by the fact that Metro Transit did not own the lot, but merely leased it from the public school district.

This lot was the only park and ride lot on the Blue Line within the city of Minneapolis. The lot closed March 7, 2015 for redevelopment. There are over 2,500 park and ride spaces at Fort Snelling station and 28th Avenue station at the southern end of the Blue Line.

== Bus connections and future bus rapid transit==
From the station, passengers go down one level to make direct connections to bus routes 21.

The station will be a stop on the Metro B Line, an under construction bus rapid transit line that will substantially replace Route 21 along Lake Street and Selby Avenue. Route 21 currently carries 10,000 passengers every weekday, while only making up 2% of traffic on Lake Street. Improvements would include specialized stations and buses and frequent all-day service. To speed up travel times, which usually slows to during rush hours, off-board fare collection, near-level boarding, and transit signal priority will be implemented.

When the line opens, it will provide a crosstown connection to Southwest LRT, Metro E Line, Orange Line, D Line, and A Line with the final terminus at Union Depot in downtown Saint Paul, Minnesota. The eastbound BRT station was constructed in 2015 and includes a distinct shelter and station marker, near-level boarding, heating and lighting, and infrastructure for off-board fare collection once the B Line begins operating. The B Line went through engineering in 2020, with construction starting in 2023, and passenger operations beginning in 2024.

==Future==
Since opening 20 years ago, the condition of the station has declined with frequent vandalism, shattered glass, broken elevators and escalators, and higher levels of crime. Since 2023 there have been security guards positioned at the station which transit officials say have been effective at reducing crime. There have been several high profile shootings and assaults at the station.

In 2024, the Metropolitan Council awarded a contract to redesign the station with construction potentially beginning in 2025. The light rail system in Minnesota is based on proof-of-payment but the Metropolitan Council is considering enclosing the station with faregates.

<text>Velike Lašče (; ) is a town in Slovenia. It is the seat of the Municipality of Velike Lašče. It is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included in the Central Slovenia Statistical Region.

==Name==
The name &quot;Velike Lašče&quot; literally means &#x27;big Lašče&#x27;, distinguishing the town from the neighboring village of &quot;Male Lašče&quot; (literally, &#x27;little Lašče&#x27;). The name of the settlements was first attested in written sources in 1145 as &quot;Lasis&quot; (and as &quot;Lasissa&quot; in 1251, and &quot;Lasitsch&quot; in 1256). The medieval transcriptions indicate that the name was originally &quot;*Lašiče&quot;, an accusative plural form of the patronymic &quot;Lašič&quot;, derived from the name &quot;Lah&quot;—thus meaning &#x27;the place where Lah&#x27;s people live&#x27;. The name &quot;Lah&quot; is derived from &quot;Vlah&quot; and originally referred to the Romanized Celtic population, and later to Romance speakers, including Italians and Uskoks. In the past the German name was &quot;Großlaschitz&quot;.

==Mass graves==

Velike Lašče is the site of two known mass graves associated with the Second World War. The Jamnik Woods Mass Grave () is located in the woods east of the train station. It contains the remains of civilians and local anti-communist militia members, who were allied with the Italian forces. The Train Station Mass Grave () is located in the woods northeast of the train station. It contains the remains of undetermined victims.

==Church==
The parish church in the settlement is dedicated to the Nativity of Mary and belongs to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ljubljana. It is a large Neo-Romanesque church built after the original building dating to the 13th century was destroyed by fire in 1856. Its double belfry is a dominant landmark on the local skyline. In front of the church is an obelisk monument to Fran Levstik, erected in 1889.

<text>The First National Bank of Dubuque was a bank headquartered in Dubuque, Iowa. First National was the oldest national bank to be located in Iowa. It was one of the few local banks to survive the Great Depression. After a series of mergers and acquisitions, the bank eventually became part of US Bancorp corporation.

In the early 1990s, First National changed its name to Hawkeye Bank of Dubuque when it merged with several other Iowa banking concerns. A few years later, the bank was merged into the Mercantile Bank corporation. Mercantile Bank was then acquired by Firstar Bank in 1999, which also had branches in Dubuque. When this happened, Firstar evaluated the local branches in Dubuque. It closed several branches, both from the Mercantile Bank chain and some existing Firstar Bank branches.

When Firstar merged with US Bancorp, the two banks became known as US Bank. What was once First National Bank of Dubuque is now known as US Bank.

<doc id="1315495" wikidata="Q1773215" url="?curid=1315495" title="Non-24-hour sleep–wake disorder">
<text>Non-24-hour sleep–wake disorder (non-24, N24SWD, or N24) is one of several chronic circadian rhythm sleep disorders (CRSDs). It is defined as a &quot;chronic steady pattern comprising [...] daily delays in sleep onset and wake times in an individual living in a society&quot;. Symptoms result when the non-entrained (free-running) endogenous circadian rhythm drifts out of alignment with the light–dark cycle in nature. Although this sleep disorder is more common in blind people, affecting up to 70% of the totally blind, it can also affect sighted people. Non-24 may also be comorbid with bipolar disorder, depression, and traumatic brain injury. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) has provided CRSD guidelines since 2007 with the latest update released in 2015.

People with non-24 experience daily shifts in the circadian rhythm such as peak time of alertness, body temperature minimum, metabolism and hormone secretion. These shifts do not align with the natural light–dark cycle. Non-24-hour sleep–wake disorder causes a person&#x27;s sleep–wake cycle to move around the clock every day, to a degree dependent on the length of the cycle. This is known as free-running sleep.

People with the disorder may have an especially hard time adjusting to changes in &quot;regular&quot; sleep–wake cycles, such as vacations, stress, evening activities, time changes like daylight saving time, travel to different time zones, illness, medications (especially stimulants or sedatives), changes in daylight hours in different seasons, and growth spurts, which are typically known to cause fatigue. They also show lower sleep propensity after total sleep deprivation than do normal sleepers.

Non-24 can begin at any age, not uncommonly in childhood. It is sometimes preceded by delayed sleep phase disorder.

Most people with this disorder find that it severely impairs their ability to function in school, in employment, and in their social lives. Typically, they are &quot;partially or totally unable to function in scheduled activities on a daily basis, and most cannot work at conventional jobs&quot;. Attempts to keep conventional hours by people with the disorder generally result in insomnia (which is not a normal feature of the disorder itself) and excessive sleepiness, to the point of falling into microsleeps, as well as myriad effects associated with acute and chronic sleep deprivation. People with non-24 who force themselves to live to a normal workday &quot;are not often successful and may develop physical and psychological complaints during waking hours, i.e. sleepiness, fatigue, headache, decreased appetite, or depressed mood. Patients often have difficulty maintaining ordinary social lives, and some of them lose their jobs or fail to attend school.&quot;

==In blind people==

It has been estimated that non-24 occurs in more than half of all people who are totally blind. The disorder can occur at any age, from birth onwards. It generally follows shortly after loss or removal of a person&#x27;s eyes, as the photosensitive ganglion cells in the retina are also removed.

Without light to the retina, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), located in the hypothalamus, is not cued each day to synchronize the circadian rhythm to the 24-hour social day, resulting in non-24 for many totally blind individuals. Non-24 is rare among visually impaired patients who retain at least some light perception. Researchers have found that even minimal light exposure at night can affect the body clock.

==Symptoms==

People with this disorder might find it difficult to follow a regular clock scheme, as their biological clock can shift so much that they are sleepy during the day and experience insomnia during night. Another common diagnostic feature is the cyclical nature of non-24: people will experience certain periods, whether they be weeks or months, of sleeping during the day (symptomatic periods) that alternate with periods of sleeping during normal nighttime hours (asymptomatic periods).

Symptoms reported by patients forced into a 24-hour schedule are similar to those of sleep deprivation and can include:
* Apraxia including ideational apraxia, ideomotor apraxia, kinetic apraxia, limb apraxia, verbal apraxia
* Cognitive dysfunction
* Difficulties concentrating
* Confusion
* Depressed mood
* Diarrhea
* Extreme nausea
* Extreme fatigue
* Hair loss
* Headaches

* Impaired balance
* Photosensitivity
* Joint pain
* Loss of muscle coordination (ataxia)
* Menstrual irregularities
* Muscle pain
* Suicidal thoughts
* Weight gain
* Hallucinations
==Causes==
The possible causes of non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder are 2-fold: (1), extrinsic: isolation from daily light cycles (such as working in an environment completely devoid of natural lighting); and (2), intrinsic: where some condition, such as blindness or malfunctioning biochemical response to light in the subject, prevent normal levels of light-activated melatonin release. Melatonin is responsible for sleep regulation, and its release is controlled by the amount of light entering the eyes.

===Sighted===
Sighted people with non-24 appear to be more rare than blind people with the disorder, and the etiology of their circadian disorder is less well understood. At least one case of a sighted person developing non-24 was preceded by head injury; another patient diagnosed with the disorder was later found to have a &quot;large pituitary adenoma that involved the optic chiasma&quot;. Thus the problem appears to be neurological. Specifically, it is thought to involve abnormal functioning of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus. Several other cases have been preceded by chronotherapy, a prescribed treatment for delayed sleep phase disorder. &quot;Studies in animals suggest that a hypernyctohemeral syndrome could occur as a physiologic aftereffect of lengthening the sleep–wake cycle with chronotherapy&quot;. According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), &quot;patients with free-running (FRD) rhythms are thought to reflect a failure of entrainment&quot;.

There have been several experimental studies of sighted people with the disorder. McArthur et al. reported treating a sighted patient who &quot;appeared to be subsensitive to bright light&quot;. In other words, the brain (or the retina) does not react normally to light (people with the disorder may or may not, however, be unusually &quot;subjectively&quot; sensitive to light; one study found that they were more sensitive than the control group). In 2002 Uchiyama et al. examined five sighted non-24 patients who showed, during the study, a sleep–wake cycle averaging 25.12 hours. That is appreciably longer than the 24.02-hour average shown by the control subjects in that study, which was near the average innate cycle for healthy adults of all ages: the 24.18 hours found by Charles Czeisler. The literature usually refers to a &quot;one- to two-hour&quot; delay per 24-hour day (i.e. a 25- to 26-hour cycle).

Uchiyama et al. had earlier determined that sighted non-24 patients&#x27; minimum core body temperature occurs much earlier in the sleep episode than the normal two hours before awakening. They suggest that the long interval between the temperature trough and awakening makes illumination upon awakening virtually ineffective, as per the phase response curve (PRC) for light.

In their clinical review in 2007, Okawa and Uchiyama reported that people with non-24 have a mean habitual sleep duration of nine to ten hours and that their circadian periods average 24.8 hours.

===Blind===
As stated above, the majority of patients with non-24 are totally blind. The failure of entrainment is explained by the loss of photic input to the circadian clock. Non-24 is rare among visually impaired patients who retain at least some light perception; even minimal light exposure can synchronize the body clock. A few cases have been described in which patients are subjectively blind, but are normally entrained and have an intact response to the suppressing effects of light on melatonin secretion, indicating preserved neural pathways between the retina and hypothalamus.

==Circadian rhythm==
All living animals have an internal clock, the circadian rhythm, which is close to 24 hours&#x27; duration. For humans, the average duration is 24 hours and 20 minutes, and individually some people have more or less than 24 hours. Everyday exposure to the morning light resets the circadian rhythm to 24 hours, so that there is no drifting.

However, people with non-24 have a circadian rhythm significantly longer (or, rarely, shorter) than 24 hours. This makes it difficult to reset to 24 hours daily, just like it is difficult for people with a rhythm close to 24 hours to try to reset to 25 hours daily. The majority of people with non-24 are totally blind, and the failure of entrainment is explained by an absence of light (photic) input to reset the circadian clock. Their brains may have normal circadian clocks that do not receive input from the eyes about environmental light levels, as the clocks require a functioning retina, optic nerve, and visual processing center. This makes the sleep pattern variable from one day to the next, with different wake-up time and bedtime every day.

People with a circadian rhythm that is quite near to 24 hours may be able to sleep on a conventional, socially acceptable schedule, that is, at night. Others, with a &quot;daily&quot; cycle upwards of 25 hours or more, may need to adopt a sleep pattern that is congruent with their free-running circadian clock: by daily shifts in their sleep times, which often results in satisfactory sleep but with negative social and occupational consequences.

The disorder also occurs in sighted people for reasons that are not well understood. Their circadian rhythms are not normal, often running to more than 25 hours. Their visual systems may function normally but their brains are incapable of making the large adjustment to a 24-hour schedule.

Though often referred to as non-24, for example by the FDA, the disorder is also known as: non-24-hour sleep–wake syndrome or disorder, free-running disorder (FRD), hypernychthemeral syndrome, hypernychthemeral sleep-wake cycle disturbance, circadian rhythm sleep disorder—free-running type or nonentrained type, non-24-hour circadian rhythm disorder. or just N24 for short in everyday speech.

The disorder is an invisible disability that can be &quot;extremely debilitating in that it is incompatible with most social and professional obligations&quot;.

==Mechanisms==
The internal circadian clock, located in the hypothalamus of the brain, generates a signal that normally is slightly longer (occasionally shorter) than 24 hours, on average 24 hours and 11 minutes. This slight deviation is, in almost everyone, corrected by exposure to environmental time cues, especially the light–dark cycle, which reset the clock and synchronize (entrain) it to the 24-hour day. Morning light exposure resets the clock earlier, and evening exposure resets it later, thereby bracketing the rhythm to an average 24-hour period. If people who do not have non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder are deprived of external time cues (living in a cave or artificial time-isolated environment with no light), their circadian rhythms will &quot;free-run&quot; with a cycle of a little more (occasionally less) than 24 hours, expressing the intrinsic period of each individual&#x27;s circadian clock. The circadian rhythms of individuals with non-24 can resemble those of experimental subjects living in a time-isolated environment even though they are living in normal society.

The circadian clock modulates many physiological rhythms. The most easily observed of these is the propensity for sleep and wake; thus, people with non-24 experience symptoms of insomnia and daytime sleepiness (similar to &quot;jet lag&quot;) when their endogenous circadian rhythms drift out of synchrony with the social/solar 24-hour day, but they conform to a conventional schedule. Eventually, their circadian rhythms will drift back into normal alignment, when symptoms temporarily resolve. Thus the overall pattern involves periodic symptoms on a weekly or monthly basis, depending on the length of the internal circadian cycle. For example, an individual with a circadian period of 24.5 hours would drift 30 minutes later each day and would be maximally misaligned every 48 days. If patients set their own schedule for sleep and wake, aligned to their endogenous non-24 period (as is the case for most sighted patients with this disorder), symptoms of insomnia and wake-time sleepiness are much reduced. However, such a schedule is incompatible with most occupations and social relationships.

The AASM suggests that non-24 might be different disorders in sighted and blind people, with different internal and external contributing factors—as these can affect treatment response, different treatments could be needed. Future studies should therefore try to identify and assess these factors.

==Diagnosis==
This disorder can have symptomatic periods, where &quot;the time of high sleep propensity gradually shifts, such that patients experience daytime hypersomnolence and nighttime insomnia&quot;.

In sighted people, the diagnosis is typically made based on a history of persistently delayed sleep onset that follows a non-24-hour pattern. Hayakawa et al. (2005) reported on the basis of 57 cases of sighted patients that the average day length was 24.9 ± 0.4 hours (with the range of 24.4–26.5).

==Medical classification==

International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD)

Since 2005, the disorder has been recognized by name in the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics and the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in their adaptation and extension of the WHO&#x27;s &quot;International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems&quot; (ICD):
* ICD-9-CM: Circadian rhythm sleep disorder, free-running type; code 327.34 became effective in October 2005. Prior to the introduction of this code, the nonspecific code 307.45, Circadian rhythm sleep disorder of non-organic origin, was available, and as of 2014 remains the code recommended by the DSM-5.
* ICD-10-CM: Circadian rhythm sleep disorder, free running type; code G47.24 was due to take effect October 1, 2014.

Since 2013, the disorder has been recognized by the American Psychiatric Association:
* DSM-5, 2013: Circadian rhythm sleep–wake disorders, Non-24-hour sleep–wake type; ICD-9-CM code 307.45 is recommended (no acknowledgement of 327.34 is made), and ICD-10-CM code G47.24 is recommended when it goes into effect.

==Treatment==

=== Tasimelteon ===
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved in January 2014 the melatonin agonist tasimelteon for the treatment of non-24 for blind people. This is the first FDA-approved drug for any circadian rhythm sleep disorder, since melatonin is unregulated. In the largest treatment study with non-24 patients, it was demonstrated that tasimelteon safely and effectively treated totally blind patients: occurred in 20% (8 of 40) of patients receiving the drug compared with 3% (1 of 38) receiving placebo. In a separate meta-analysis, melatonin supplementation achieved a 67% (12 of 18) entrainment rate. Studies directly comparing tasimelteon and melatonin have yet to be performed. Study authors noted that the lower rates of entrainment with tasimelteon may have been due to short duration of treatment.

=== Melatonin, light therapy and dark therapy ===

Melatonin administration 1 hour before bedtime is considered another treatment for non-24. However, it is important to note that melatonin may only treat the inability to sleep and may not help to improve the daytime sleepiness.

Light therapy, which involves a bright light exposure of thousands of lux of white light or about 400 lux of blue light on awakening to counteract the tendency for circadian rhythms to delay (similar to treatment for delayed sleep phase disorder and seasonal affective disorder), is not currently recommended until more studies appear, although it has been found to be effective in some cases. This can be combined with dark therapy (or scototherapy), which involves filtering blue light (using software, screen filters or (amber-color) glasses) and preferring red-colored lights with a low amount of lux in the few hours before bedtime to avoid melatonin suppression.

Both melatonin administration and light therapy work by shifting circadian rhythms according to a phase response curve (PRC), with the melatonin PRC being essentially the inverse of the light PRC. Furthermore, light can suppress melatonin secretion. Both have a duration of approximately 12 hours, in opposite phase: light PRC spikes at the beginning of the day and lowers throughout the day with a depression after 8 hours for the last 4 hours, whereas natural melatonin spikes at the start of the biological night and drops around the time of waking up or light perception. The first 8 hours are called the &quot;advance zone&quot; whereas the last few hours the &quot;delay zone&quot;. The change from advancement to delay zones is progressive, passing through a long area of no effect (a &quot;dead zone&quot;), but the change from delay to advancement is abrupt, occurring a few hours before wake-up time or bedtime for light or melatonin respectively. When melatonin supplementation is taken in the melatonin PRC advance zone (i.e., the last few hours before bedtime), it resets the clock earlier; when taken in the melatonin PRC delay zone (i.e., few hours before and after wake-up time), it shifts the clock later. In other words, melatonin has most effect when it is taken at times when natural melatonin is not normally present, thus during the day: when taken in the morning, melatonin causes phase delays (shifts to a later time), and when taken in the afternoon/evening it causes phase advances (shifts to an earlier time). However, for a sleep phase delayed person, the time of biological morning and biological afternoon/evening might differ depending on the circadian clock shift in the affected person. This means that if melatonin is taken during the usual bedtime and wake-up time (i.e., usual nighttime), it may have no effect. Therefore, successful entrainment depends on both the melatonin dosage and the appropriate timing of melatonin administration. The accuracy needed for successfully timing the administration of melatonin might require a period of trial and error, as does the dosage. However, entrainment was also observed when giving a dose of melatonin as low as 0.05 mg and without any timing, by just continuing melatonin administration at the same time every day until their circadian rhythm shifted enough to coincide with melatonin administration (which took from 1 to 2 months).

In addition to natural fluctuations within the circadian rhythm, seasonal changes including temperature, hours of daylight, light intensity and diet are likely to affect the efficacy of melatonin and light therapies since these exogenous zeitgebers would compete for hormonal homeostasis. Further to this, there are unforeseen disruptions to contend with even when a stabilized cycle is achieved, such as travel, exercise, stress, alcohol, or even the use of light-emitting technology close to a subjective evening/night.

==Prevalence==
There are an estimated 140,000 people with non-24—both sighted and blind—in the European Union, a total prevalence of approximately 3 per 10,000, or 0.03%. It is unknown how many individuals with this disorder do not seek medical attention, so incidence may be higher. The European portal for rare diseases, Orphanet, lists non-24 as a rare disease by their definition: fewer than 1 affected person for every 2000 population. The US National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) lists non-24 as a rare disease by its definition.

===Blind===
While both sighted and blind people are diagnosed with non-24, the disorder is believed to affect up to 70% of totally blind individuals. It is estimated by researchers that of the 1.3 million blind people in the U.S., 10% have no light perception at all. Of that group, it is estimated that approximately half to three-quarters, or 65,000 to 95,000 Americans, have non-24.

==History==
In the 1980s and 1990s, several trials of melatonin administration to totally blind individuals without light perception produced improvement in sleep patterns, but it was unclear at that time if the benefits were due to entrainment from light cues. The ability of melatonin administration to entrain free-running rhythms was first demonstrated by Redman, et al. in 1983 in rats who were maintained in a time-free environment. Then, using endogenous melatonin as a marker for circadian rhythms, several research groups showed that appropriately timed melatonin administration could entrain free-running rhythms in the totally blind: they found that 6 out of 7 patients treated with 10 mg melatonin at bedtime were normally entrained, and when the dose was gradually reduced to 0.5 mg in three of the subjects, entrainment persisted. Subsequently, it was observed that treatment initiated with the 0.5 mg dose could produce entrainment on some patients. Interestingly, one subject who failed to entrain at a higher dose was successfully entrained at a lower dose. A low dose produces melatonin blood levels that are similar to the concentrations naturally produced by nightly pineal secretion.

There has been a constant growth in the field of melatonin and melatonin receptor agonists since the 1980s. In 2005, ramelteon (trade name Rozerem) was the first melatonin agonist to be approved in the United States (US), indicated for insomnia treatment in adults. Melatonin in the form of prolonged release (trade name Circadin) was approved in 2007 in Europe (EU) for use as a short-term treatment, in patients 55 years and older, for primary insomnia. Tasimelteon (trade name Hetlioz) received FDA approval in January 2014 for blind persons diagnosed with non-24. TIK-301 (Tikvah Therapeutics, Atlanta, USA) has been in phase II clinical trial in the United States since 2002 and the FDA granted it orphan drug designation in May 2004, for use as a treatment for circadian rhythm sleep disorder in blind individuals without light perception as well as individuals with tardive dyskinesia.

The first report and description of a case of non-24, a man living on 26-hour days, who happened to be sighted, was &quot;A man with too long a day&quot; by Ann L. Eliott et al. in November 1970. The related and more common delayed sleep phase disorder was not described until 1981.

The first detailed study of non-24 in a blind subject was by Miles Le and his colleagues in 1977. The researchers reported on a 28-year-old male who had a 24.9-hour rhythm in sleep, plasma cortisol, and other parameters. Even while adhering to a typical 24-hour schedule for bedtime, rise time, work, and meals, the man&#x27;s body rhythms continued to shift.

==Research==

Not all totally blind individuals have free-running rhythms, and those that do often show relative coordination as their endogenous rhythms approximate normal timing. It has been suggested that there are non-photic time cues that are important for maintaining entrainment, but these cues are yet to be characterized.

Very preliminary research on light sensitivity suggest that not only insensitivity but also circadian hypersensitivity to light might be at play for patients with a delayed sleep phase disorder.

==Society==
NASA explored the potential impact on circadian rhythm and possible development of a sleep–wake disorder by human astronauts who would go on a mission to Mars, by assessing mission personnel who worked remotely on the Phoenix Mars Lander project and were asked to follow a Mars day of 24.65 hours for 78 days.

<doc id="1315496" wikidata="Q2279915" url="?curid=1315496" title="Shōrinjiryū Kenkōkan Karate">
<text>is a style of karate founded by Kōri Hisataka (Seiki Kudaka in Okinawan) (1907–1988) shortly after World War II in Japan.

It consists of the primary arts of Shōrinjiryū Kenkōkan Okinawan karate and Okinawan Kobudo, as taught to the founder by masters including Chotoku Kyan and Sanda Kanagusuku, as well as Judo, which Kori Hisataka studied at the Kodokan, obtaining the rank of 4th Dan after only 1 years training. Other component arts include Aikijutsu and Chinese Bajiquan, which the founder studied on his extensive tours of Japan, China and Asia.

The style is responsible for a number of innovations to karate training including:
* Use of the heel when kicking
* Whole body is put into action when executing a technique, using a follow through motion
* Use of the vertical fist (tate ken)
* Practice of yakusoku kumite
* Use of protective equipment to allow the karatedo student to test their techniques without having to hold back their power
* Practice of weapons (buki ho)

In some aspects, Shorinjiryu Karate has a strong resemblance to Japanese Koryu Budo, in that it has a great emphasis on pre-arranged two-person drills (yakusoku kumite). One person kata is an important practice, and the main kata taught in the style in its early days were versions of Naihanchin, Nijushiho, Sanchin, Chinto and Kusanku, as well as a Bō (6 ft staff) kata (Shishiryu no Bo), a Jo (4 ft staff) kata and a Sai (iron truncheon) kata (Nijushiho no Sai). Other kata were introduced later, mainly by the son of the founder, Masayuki Hisataka.

Following Kori Hisataka&#x27;s retirement in 1974, his son Masayuki Hisataka took over as head of the organization. He has expanded the reach of the style worldwide and trained karateka all over the world.

==Grading structure==
Like many styles of karate to date, the grading structure runs on a belt system, with 10 coloured belt levels (kyu) for non-black holders (mudansha) and 10 levels (dan) for black belt holders (yudansha). The following describes the grading structure utilised by the Shorinjiryu Kenkokan organisation and many of the descendant schools. Other descendant schools may utilise alternative structures, though all use ten levels for black belt holders.

The 10 levels of coloured belts used in Shorinjiryu Kenkokan and many descendent schools are:
* 10th kyu - White belt
* 9th kyu - Yellow/White stripe
* 8th kyu - Yellow belt
* 7th kyu - Orange/White Stripe
* 6th kyu - Orange belt
* 5th kyu - Green/White Stripe
* 4th kyu - Green belt
* 3rd kyu - Brown/White Stripe
* 2nd kyu - Brown belt
* 1st kyu - Black/White Stripe

Black belt holders (yudansha) all wear a black belt that may be embroidered with the holder&#x27;s name and style. There are ceremonial belts for high-ranking black belts, including the red and white panelled belt for holders of 6th, 7th and 8th Dan, and a red belt for 9th and 10th Dan masters. Some derivative schools of Shorinjiryu Kenkokan utilise additional ceremonial belts.

Masayuki Hisataka is currently the highest graded proponent of the Shorinjiryu Kenkokan organisation, holding the rank of 9th Dan and the title of &quot;Hanshi&quot;.

==International Mainline Branches==
The mainline Shorinjiryu Kenkokan Karate Do is represented around the world by its international branches directly affiliated to the Shorinjiryu Kenkokan Karate Hombu Dojo in Japan. Some of the major locations and the senior instructors include:
*Japan: Masayuki Hisataka 9th Dan, Hiroshi Hisataka 6th Dan, Masamitsu Kudaka 7th Dan, Masaki Enomoto 6th Dan
*Australia: Scott Brown 6th Dan
*USA: Mega Martinez 6th Dan
*Canada: Philippe Nadeau 7th Dan
*Germany: Olaf Lotze-Leoni 6th Dan
*New Zealand: Shaun O&#x27;Leary 5th Dan
*Switzerland: Mamadou Diallo 6th Dan
*Venezuela: Kunio Tanabe 6th Dan
*Spain: Luis Peres Santiago 5th Dan
*Netherlands: Peter Lerk 4th Dan

==Descendent Schools==
Over the years, a number of individuals and organisations have branched out to form new schools based on Shorinjiryu Kenkokan Karate. These may include individuals who were direct students of the founder, Kori Hisataka, or the current international head master, Masayuki Hisataka. As with the mainline Shorinjiryu Kenkokan school, each of these descendent schools, their founders and current chief instructors have continued to evolve organisationally, and in technique and teaching approaches. Some, such as the Shorinjiryu Kenyukai Watanabe-Ha school have &quot;carefully preserved the styles and principles taught&quot; by the founder, while others have introduced new techniques, forms and training approaches. These descendent schools include:
*USA: Shorinjiryu Kenyukai Watanaba-Ha: &#x27;Shunji Watanabe 9th Dan Hanshi (direct student of the Kori Hisataka)
*Shorinjiryu Genbukan: Shigeru Ishino 7th Dan (direct student of the Kori Hisataka)
*USA: Nanzenkai Tokyo Karate: Tamon Kashimoto (student of Kori Hisataka)
*USA: Nido Icho Shinto Ryu: Evan Marcus 7th dan (student of Ken Mack)
*USA: Shorinjiryu Kenryukan: Myron Lubitsch 9th Dan
*USA: Shorinjiryu Ake no Myojo Budo: Peter Hiltz, 6th Dan 
*Canada: Shorinjiryu Kentokukan: Wayne Donivan 9th Dan
*Canada: Shorinjiryu Shindo Budo Kwai: Michel Laurin 9th Dan
*Canada: Shorinjiryu Kudaka: Doug Roberts 9th Dan
*Canada: Shorinjiryu Kenshin: Manny Hawthorne 7th Dan (student of Masayuki Hisataka &amp; Wayne Donivan)
*Canada: Bubishido: Jeffrey Henderson, 7th Dan (student of Hanshi Hisataka &amp; Wayne Donivan)
*Canada: Shorinjiryu Ken Sei Kai: Tom Bellazzi, 7th Dan 
*Australia Shorinjiryu Koshinkai: Jim Griffin 7th Dan and Max Estens 7th Dan

The above organisations are independent of the mainline Shorinjiryu Kenkokan organisation, but largely base their teachings on that style as developed by the founder and/or the current headmaster.

==Other Schools Influenced by Shorinjiryu Kenkokan Karatedo==
Over the years, a number of practitioners of karatedo in particular, or budo in general, have been influenced by Shorinjiryu Kenkokan Karatedo, either directly from the founder, Kori Hisataka, current headmaster, Masayuki Hisataka or other senior practitioners of the style. Some of these individuals have gone on to found their own schools, and have integrated aspects of Shorinjiyru Kenkokan into their own school. As they have blended other significant components into the school, these have not been classified into the list of Descendent Schools (above), but are listed below to recognise the fact that they are unique schools based on the foundation of Shorinjiryu Kenkokan Karatedo.

*Canada/Iran: Kan Zen Ryu - Farhad Varasteh
*Australia: United Karate Brotherhood - Patrick McKean (student of Scott Brown)
*USA: &quot; Mouko-Ken &quot; (Fierce Tiger Fist) Shito-Ryu Karate-Do - John Gaddy 8th Dan

==Buki-Ho (Weapons)==
In its early days, Shorinjiryu Kenkokan Karatedo practice featured heavy use of a variety of Okinawan weapons, including the Bo (6 ft staff), jo (4 ft staff) and sai (iron truncheon) as the primary weapons, with other weapons including the yari (spear), kai (oar), bokken (wooden sword), tanbo (stick) and occasionally the katana (Japanese sword) also being practiced. The three primary weapons were emphasised as they represented short, medium and long range weapons.

In more recent times, the Shorinjiryu Kenkokan Karatedo So Hombu dojo (along with its various mainline branches) stresses the Bo, Sai and sword, with the sword effectively replacing the Jo as the primary mid-range weapon. Various descendent schools practice a combination of the original primary and support weapons.

The original weapons kata taught by Kori Hisataka, still taught in some of the mainline Kenkokan branches or descendent schools, include Shishiryu no Bo (also simply known as Bo no Kata), Nijushiho no Sai (also known as Sai no Kata, or occasionally Kudaka no Sai) and Jo no Kata (also known as Kudaka no Jo, or Shishiryu no Jo). There were also various 2 person pre-arranged forms, including Bo vs Bo, Bo vs Sai and the Shin Ken Shira Ha Dori (empty hand against sword).

Other weapons forms have been added to the mix over time, and include the Gorin no Bo series of kata (Shodan, Nidan and Sandan) and Gokyoku no Ken forms created by Masayuki Hisataka. Shorinjiryu Koshinkai Karatedo also practices the Ufuchiku no Jo form that has evolved from the teachings of Sanda &quot;Ufuchiku&quot; Kanagusuku, one of the weapons teachers of Kori Hisataka.

<text>38th Street station is a light rail station on the Blue Line in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

This station is located at the intersection of 38th Street and Minnesota State Highway 55 (Hiawatha Avenue), in Minneapolis. This is a center-platform station. Service began at this station when the Blue Line opened on June 26, 2004.

The city of Minneapolis has a station area plan to guide development in the area. The initial plan was adopted in 2006.

== Bus connections ==
From 38th Street Station, there are direct bus connections to Metro Transit routes 14, 22, and 23.

==Station changes since opening==
Metro Transit proposed building secure, covered bike storage for 53 bicycles in 2016. The structure would have required a Go-To Card to operate.

Metro Transit applied for federal grant money to modernize the station and build a transit-oriented development. The project would modify nearby intersections and stop lights to improve transit operations. The grant application was successful in 2022.

== Art at station and in popular culture ==

The interior of the shelters on the station platform have bronze miniatures of Sears Catalog kit houses. The adjacent neighborhoods have many bungalow houses built around the era of Sears Catalog kit houses.

The announcer for this station can be heard on the opening of &quot;Arthur&#x27;s Song&quot; by Atmosphere on the album &quot;Southsiders&quot;.

<doc id="1315510" wikidata="Q1143270" url="?curid=1315510" title="Upsampling">
<text>In digital signal processing, upsampling, expansion, and interpolation are terms associated with the process of resampling in a multi-rate digital signal processing system. &quot;Upsampling&quot; can be synonymous with &quot;expansion&quot;, or it can describe an entire process of &quot;expansion&quot; and filtering (&quot;interpolation&quot;). When upsampling is performed on a sequence of samples of a &quot;signal&quot; or other continuous function, it produces an approximation of the sequence that would have been obtained by sampling the signal at a higher rate (or density, as in the case of a photograph). For example, if compact disc audio at 44,100 samples/second is upsampled by a factor of 5/4, the resulting sample-rate is 55,125.
==Upsampling by an integer factor==

Rate increase by an integer factor formula_1 can be explained as a 2-step process, with an equivalent implementation that is more efficient:
#Expansion: Create a sequence, formula_2 comprising the original samples, formula_3 separated by formula_4 zeros.  A notation for this operation is:  formula_5
#Interpolation: Smooth out the discontinuities using a lowpass filter, which replaces the zeros.

In this application, the filter is called an interpolation filter, and its design is discussed below. When the interpolation filter is an FIR type, its efficiency can be improved, because the zeros contribute nothing to its dot product calculations. It is an easy matter to omit them from both the data stream and the calculations. The calculation performed by a multirate interpolating FIR filter for each output sample is a dot product:
where the formula_6 sequence is the impulse response of the interpolation filter, and formula_7 is the largest value of formula_8 for which formula_9 is non-zero. 

The interpolation filter output sequence is defined by a convolution:
:formula_10
The only terms for which formula_11 can be non-zero are those for which formula_12 is an integer multiple of formula_13  Thus:
formula_14  for integer values of formula_15  and the convolution can be rewritten as:
:formula_16

In the case formula_17  function formula_6 can be designed as a half-band filter, where almost half of the coefficients are zero and need not be included in the dot products. Impulse response coefficients taken at intervals of formula_1 form a subsequence, and there are formula_1 such subsequences (called phases) multiplexed together. Each of formula_1 phases of the impulse response is filtering the same sequential values of the formula_22 data stream and producing one of formula_1 sequential output values. In some multi-processor architectures, these dot products are performed simultaneously, in which case it is called a polyphase filter.

For completeness, we now mention that a possible, but unlikely, implementation of each phase is to replace the coefficients of the other phases with zeros in a copy of the formula_6 array, and process the formula_25  sequence at formula_1 times faster than the original input rate. Then formula_4 of every formula_1 outputs are zero. The desired formula_29 sequence is the sum of the phases, where formula_4 terms of the each sum are identically zero.  Computing formula_4 zeros between the useful outputs of a phase and adding them to a sum is effectively decimation. It&#x27;s the same result as not computing them at all. That equivalence is known as the &quot;second Noble identity&quot;. It is sometimes used in derivations of the polyphase method.

==Interpolation filter design==
Let formula_32 be the Fourier transform of any function, formula_33 whose samples at some interval, formula_34 equal the formula_35 sequence. Then the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) of the formula_35 sequence is the Fourier series representation of a periodic summation of formula_37
 = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} X\Bigl(f - \frac{k}{T}\Bigr).&lt;/math&gt;    

When formula_38 has units of seconds, formula_39 has units of hertz (Hz). Sampling formula_1 times faster (at interval formula_41) increases the periodicity by a factor of formula_42
which is also the desired result of interpolation. An example of both these distributions is depicted in the first and third graphs of Fig 2.  

When the additional samples are inserted zeros, they decrease the sample-interval to formula_43 Omitting the zero-valued terms of the Fourier series, it can be written as:

:formula_44

which is equivalent to regardless of the value of formula_13 That equivalence is depicted in the second graph of Fig.2. The only difference is that the available digital bandwidth is expanded to formula_46, which increases the number of periodic spectral images within the new bandwidth. Some authors describe that as new frequency components.  The second graph also depicts a lowpass filter and formula_47 resulting in the desired spectral distribution (third graph). The filter&#x27;s bandwidth is the Nyquist frequency of the original formula_35 sequence.  In units of Hz that value is formula_49  but filter design applications usually require normalized units. (see Fig 2, table)

==Upsampling by a fractional factor==

Let &quot;L&quot;/&quot;M&quot; denote the upsampling factor, where &quot;L&quot; &gt; &quot;M&quot;.

#Upsample by a factor of &quot;L&quot;
#Downsample by a factor of &quot;M&quot;

Upsampling requires a lowpass filter after increasing the data rate, and downsampling requires a lowpass filter before decimation. Therefore, both operations can be accomplished by a single filter with the lower of the two cutoff frequencies. For the &quot;L&quot; &gt; &quot;M&quot; case, the interpolation filter cutoff,  formula_50 &quot;cycles per intermediate sample&quot;, is the lower frequency.

<doc id="1315522" wikidata="Q1348747" url="?curid=1315522" title="Erdal İnönü">
<text>Erdal İnönü (6 June 1926 – 31 October 2007) was a Turkish theoretical physicist and politician who served as the interim prime minister of Turkey between 16 May and 25 June 1993. He also served as the deputy prime minister of Turkey from 1991 to 1993 and as the minister of foreign affairs from March to October 1995. He served as the leader of the Social Democracy Party (SODEP) from 1983 to 1985 and later the Social Democratic Populist Party (SHP) from 1986 to 1993. He was the son of the second president of Turkey, İsmet İnönü.

İnönü initially founded SODEP in 1983 with the intention of contesting the 1983 general election. However, the National Security Council, which had been established following the 1980 military coup, banned İnönü from standing for office. Standing down as chairman in order to be replaced by a politician that could seek office, İnönü was succeeded by Cezmi Kartay. However, SODEP was banned completely from contesting the election, resulting in İnönü taking over as leader for a second time shortly afterwards.

His party contested the 1984 local elections and came second with 23.4% of the vote. SODEP merged with the People&#x27;s Party in 1985 and İnönü became the leader of the new Social Democratic Populist Party (SHP) in 1986. In the 1986 parliamentary by-elections, the SHP came third with 22.7% of the vote and İnönü was elected as a member of Parliament for İzmir. He was the only successful SHP candidate.

Following the 1991 general election, the SHP formed a coalition with Süleyman Demirel&#x27;s True Path Party (DYP) and İnönü became Deputy Prime Minister. He briefly served as the acting prime minister in 1993 after Demirel was elected president. After the DYP elected Tansu Çiller as their leader and she formed a government, İnönü continued as deputy prime minister until he resigned as party leader in 1993. He later served as foreign minister in 1995 until he stepped down as an MP in the 1995 general election.

== Early life ==
Erdal İnönü was born in Ankara on June 6, 1926, as the third of four children of İsmet İnönü, the first Prime Minister and second President of Turkey, and Mevhibe İnönü. He graduated from the Physics Department of the Faculty of Sciences of Ankara University in 1947 and received his PhD from California Institute of Technology in 1951; with Eugene Wigner, he pioneered the study of group contractions. Upon his return to Turkey, İnönü worked at first as an assistant professor in Ankara University. Between 1964 and 1974, he was professor of physics and the first chairman of the Department of Theoretical Physics at the Middle East Technical University (1960–1966). He initiated research on neutron transport during that period. Between 1969 and 1971, he was the dean of the university&#x27;s Faculty of Art and Sciences. He served as president of METU between 1970 and 1971. In 1974, İnönü moved to Boğaziçi University in Istanbul and lectured there until his venture into politics when he founded the Social Democracy Party (SODEP) in 1983. While at Boğaziçi, he served as the dean of the Faculty of Art and Sciences between 1976 and 1982.

== Political career ==
Although the military government banned İnönü&#x27;s party in 1983 elections, SODEP managed to survive and became the second party in 1984 local elections. In November 1985 SODEP and another party named People&#x27;s Party (Halkçı Parti) formed a union, the Social Democratic Populist Party (SHP). According to consolidation agreement İnönü briefly lost his post. But he became the leader of SHP in May 1986. SHP was one of the parties which weighed the heaviest in Turkey&#x27;s political scene during the late 1980s and early 1990s. İnönü challenged the liberal conservative party of Turgut Özal, ANAP, both in 1987 and 1991 elections. One of the main reasons why SHP could not win an election was the division of the moderate left votes between SHP and DSP, the party of the former CHP leader Bülent Ecevit. Erdal İnönü was also a member of the Socialist International. He joined discussions as the deputy chairman of the organization.

Erdal İnönü was deputy prime minister in the two coalition governments formed between center-right DYP and SHP, which were led by Süleyman Demirel at first (from 1991 to 1993) and when Demirel became the president, by Tansu Çiller, in a unity largely caused by their resentment at the time against the outgoing Motherland Party. (See 49th government of Turkey and 50th government of Turkey)

==After resignation==

In the summer of 1993 he announced that he would not run for the leadership of the party in the coming congress. During the 4th general congress of the party on 11–12 September 1993, he resigned from the leadership of the party and consequently he also resigned from his post in the government. Murat Karayalçın replaced him in both posts. In February 1995, SHP and recently refounded Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP) merged. Upon Erdal İnönü&#x27;s suggestion the new party was named CHP. In CHP Erdal İnönü was given the title of &quot;honorary chairman&quot;. In 1995 he served as the minister of foreign affairs for about six months.

== Later life ==
He was the 2004 recipient of the Wigner medal, given by the Group Theory and Fundamental Physics Foundation, for his contributions to group contractions. İnönü was also known for his work on the history of science in the Republic of Turkey and the Ottoman Empire. He lectured at Sabancı University and the Feza Gürsey Institute from 2004 to 2007.

==Death==
Erdal İnönü died in Houston, Texas, United States, on 31 October 2007, where he was being treated for leukaemia. His body was flown to Turkey and was buried at the Zincirlikuyu Cemetery in Istanbul on 4 November 2007 following a state funeral held before the building of Turkish Grand National Assembly in Ankara the previous day and then an Islamic funeral in the Teşvikiye Mosque in Istanbul.

<text>Abbotsford is a suburb of the New Zealand city of Dunedin. It is located to the west of the city centre.

It is Immediately to the north of Green Island, and separated from it by and South Island Main Trunk Railway (opened to Green Island in 1874). Abbotsford is an entirely residential suburb with virtually no retail or service sector of its own – for these it relies on Green Island.

==The Abbotsford landslip==

On the night of 8 August 1979, a major landslide occurred in Abbotsford, resulting in the destruction or relocation of some 69 houses, and requiring the evacuation of over 600 people. No-one was killed. This remains the largest landslip to have occurred in an urban area of New Zealand.

==Sunnyvale==
In the southwest corner of Abbotsford, abutting the northwest corner of Green Island, is the Sunnyvale neighbourhood. Until the early 2000s, the main road route south out of Dunedin passed through Sunnyvale, but it and Fairfield, 2 km to the west, were bypassed by a motorway extension in 2002. The sports arena of Sunnyvale Park, serving Abbotsford and Green Island, is located in the suburb.

==Demographics==
Abbotsford covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Abbotsford had a population of 2,817 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 321 people (12.9%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 417 people (17.4%) since the 2006 census. There were 1,092 households, comprising 1,401 males and 1,413 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.99 males per female. The median age was 38.8 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 549 people (19.5%) aged under 15 years, 528 (18.7%) aged 15 to 29, 1,338 (47.5%) aged 30 to 64, and 405 (14.4%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 93.9% European/Pākehā, 9.1% Māori, 1.6% Pasifika, 2.8% Asian, and 1.3% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 7.8, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 65.0% had no religion, 26.2% were Christian, 0.1% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.2% were Hindu, 0.2% were Muslim, 0.1% were Buddhist and 1.4% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 276 (12.2%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 525 (23.1%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $36,200, compared with $31,800 nationally. 327 people (14.4%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 1,275 (56.2%) people were employed full-time, 339 (14.9%) were part-time, and 69 (3.0%) were unemployed.

==Education==
Abbotsford School is a state full primary school for Year 1 to 8 students, with a roll of students as of It was established in 1953.

<doc id="1315551" wikidata="Q3461617" url="?curid=1315551" title="EMC 1800 hp B-B">
<text>Electro-Motive Corporation (later Electro-Motive Division, General Motors) produced five 1800 hp B-B experimental passenger train-hauling diesel locomotives in 1935; two company-owned demonstrators, #511 and #512, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad&#x27;s #50, and two units for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, Diesel Locomotive #1. The twin engine power unit layout and multiple unit control systems developed with the B-B locomotives were soon adopted for other locomotives such as the Burlington Route&#x27;s &quot;Zephyr&quot; locomotives built by the Budd Company in 1936 and EMC&#x27;s own EMD E-units introduced in 1937. The B-B locomotives worked as proof-of-concept demonstrators for diesel power with the service loads of full size trains, breaking out of its niche powering the smaller custom Streamliners.

In 1935 EMC was starting its transition from a design and marketing company to a locomotive building company; development of regular production model locomotives was occurring before they had the capability to build locomotives. Construction of carbodies for EMC demonstrators #511 and #512, and B&amp;O #50 was contracted to General Electric&#x27;s Erie, Pennsylvania works, and AT&amp;SF #1 was contracted to St. Louis Car Company. Like most boxcabs, they initially had control cabs at both ends, a feature that would only rarely be repeated in future North American locomotives, although it would become common elsewhere. Power was provided by twin 12 cylinder Winton 201-A diesel engines in each power unit, exceeding by 50% the most power that could be attained with a single engine at that time. The added &quot;headroom&quot; in power extended the life of mechanical parts, which was a critical issue with early diesel engines in locomotives. The units were built with AAR type B two-axle trucks. As development design locomotives, modifications were frequently made to them to overcome various teething problems; the EMC demonstrators spent considerable time in aluminum paint substituting for the units under modification.

==EMC demonstrators 511 and 512==
The two EMC demonstrators, numbered 511 and 512, were built in August 1935 to demonstrate the future of passenger diesel power to potential customers. The boxy bodywork was not what EMC intended to sell, but it was an easy way to demonstrate the power units and hauling capacity, which would not be changed in the future E-units.

They were demonstrated both together and singly; the latter for shorter trains for local and less busy services, the former to replace larger steam locomotives on heavier trains. These units were highly significant in pioneering multiple unit connections which could be quickly connected and disconnected in the field, allowing units to be &quot;lashed up&quot; into more powerful combinations (operated by a single crew) at will, and allowing malfunctioning units to be replaced with fresh units with ease.

EMC #512, painted silver, was added to the ATSF locomotive #1 cab/booster pair to help pull the first regular run of the streamlined, Budd Company-built &quot;Super Chief&quot; on May 18, 1937, after the EMC E1 pair 2/2A built for the train burned out some of their traction motors on a record-breaking exhibition run days before.

In 1938, having outlived their usefulness, the two demonstrators were scrapped. Trucks and some other components were re-used for the two EMC NW4 switchers built for the Missouri Pacific Railroad.
==Baltimore &amp; Ohio 50==

Baltimore and Ohio Railroad #50 was fundamentally identical to demonstrators 511 and 512 when delivered. In this form, it hauled the first Diesel-powered &quot;Royal Blue&quot; until the introduction of the EMC EA/EB units in 1937.

Following that, it had a semi-streamlined &quot;shovel nose&quot; applied to one end, and transferred to the B&amp;O-owned Chicago and Alton Railroad to haul the &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;. When the Alton left B&amp;O control in the merger that created the Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad, #50 entered the GM&amp;O roster as #1200. After the Second World War, the shovel-nose treatment was removed, restoring the unit to its prior boxcab appearance. The locomotive was placed into local freight and passenger service until it was retired, upon which it was donated to the National Museum of Transportation, St. Louis, Missouri, where it remains.
==Santa Fe 1==

Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway #1 was a twin-unit set built by St. Louis Car Company in August 1935 to haul the Santa Fe&#x27;s new train, the &quot;Super Chief&quot;, for its first year of operation from May 12, 1936, until May 18 of the following year.

The Santa Fe Railway was an ideal railroad to be a dieselization pioneer; its long desert runs in the Southwest made the provision of water supplies for steam locomotives problematic. Santa Fe saw the potential for rapid dieselization of its southwestern passenger service so the railroad asked for two locomotives like the EMC demonstrators as proof of concept, letting the railroad gain some experience with diesel operation before production model diesel locomotives and the lightweight, streamlined trains they would haul were ready. The 2226.6 mile route that these units were intended to run, covering mountain and desert, was completely unprecedented, and exposed weaknesses in the design. Their working up period extended for about eight months before they were introduced into service, during which time modifications were continually made to them.

Santa Fe asked for some cosmetic &quot;dressing up&quot; of the locomotives, since they would be hauling a prestige passenger train, and EMC obliged with a treatment by Sterling McDonald&#x27;s GM styling department, which included large hooded air intakes at the front of the units and a striking paint scheme: Olive Green with Cobalt Blue and Sarasota Blue stripes separated by pinstripes of Crimson and Tuscan Red. This livery reduced the boxiness of the locomotives and gave them more of a look of speed.

The units were delivered with shrouding around their trucks, which was soon removed because the bearings on the trucks tended to run hot.
Engine cooling was another problem that needed to be addressed during the testing period. The second unit in particular had trouble getting enough air to cool the radiators; likely the stylish hood over the air intake contributed to this problem. A number of vents were added to the roofs in their first year of existence. Both units required larger steam generators, and a greater fuel and water supply.

Because they were always run coupled together, Santa Fe employees nicknamed the two units the &quot;One Spot Twins&quot; and &quot;Amos &amp; Andy&quot; (after the popular radio situation comedy). Both units shared a common road number and the operating department considered them a single locomotive. The mechanical department referred to them as &quot;Unit A&quot; (lead unit) and &quot;Unit B&quot; (trailing unit). While the pair substituted for a Super Chief E1 set with burned-out traction motors in 1937, the company leased EMC demonstrator #512 as a third unit called &quot;Unit C&quot;.

After new EMC E1s replaced the proof-of-concept #1 in 1937, the Santa Fe began to further modify the two locomotive units. The two units were rebuilt as single-ended locomotives in 1938 with a &quot;bulldog&quot; front end — a very high, raised cab above a rounded snub nose. The locomotives were painted in the &quot;Warbonnet&quot; paint scheme similar to the E1s. The trucks were replaced with three axle drop-equalizer trucks of unusual AAR wheel arrangement 1B configuration; the lead axle was unpowered, while the two rear axles were powered. The three-axle trucks were more stable at speed and lighter on the track with a lower axle loading. Roller bearings on the new trucks alleviated the overheating problem. &quot;Unit A&quot; retained road number 1 and &quot;Unit B&quot; was renumbered number 10, since it was now regarded as a separate locomotive. The revamped locomotives pulled the new Chicagoan (ATSF train) and Kansas Cityan named trainsets between Chicago and Wichita, KS, with the run soon extended to Oklahoma City.

In 1941, No. 10 had its cab removed, and became a booster unit numbered 1A. In 1948, AT&amp;SF rebuilt unit 1A into freight transfer locomotive No. 2611 running on EMD Blomberg B trucks; locomotive 1 remained unmodified from its 1938 rebuild as a passenger unit.

Both 1 and 2611 went to Electro-Motive Division as trade-ins on EMD E8 locomotives in 1953. Both emerged as booster units, numbered 83A and 84A, respectively.

<doc id="1315567" wikidata="Q2957848" url="?curid=1315567" title="Charity Organisation Society">
<text>The Charity Organisation Societies were founded in England in 1869 following the &#x27;Goschen Minute&#x27; that sought to severely restrict outdoor relief distributed by the Poor Law Guardians along the lines of the Elberfeld system. In the early 1870s, a handful of local societies were formed with the intention of restricting the distribution of outdoor relief to the elderly.
Also called the Associated Charities was a private charity that existed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a clearing house for information on the poor. The society was mainly concerned with distinction between the deserving poor and undeserving poor. The society believed that giving out charity without investigating the problems behind poverty created a class of citizens that would always be dependent on alms giving.

The society originated in Elberfeld, Germany and spread to Buffalo, New York around 1877. The conviction that relief promoted dependency was the basis for forming the Societies. Instead of offering direct relief, the societies addressed the cycle of poverty. Neighborhood charity visitors taught the values of hard work and thrift to individuals and families. The COS set up centralised records and administrative services and emphasised objective investigations and professional training. There was a strong scientific emphasis as the charity visitors organised their activities and learned principles of practice and techniques of intervention from one another. The result led to the origin of social casework. Gradually, over the ensuing years, volunteer visitors began to be supplanted by paid staff.

==Operations==
Charity Organisation Societies were made up of charitable groups that used scientific philanthropy to help poor, distressed or deviant persons. The Societies considered themselves more than just alms givers. Their ultimate goal was to restore as much self-sufficiency and responsibility as an individual could manage. Through their activities, the Societies tended to be aware of the range of social services available in their communities. They thus became the primary source of information and referral for all services. Through these referrals, a Society often became the central agency in the social services of its community. For instance, the Charity Organization Society of Denver, Colorado, the forerunner of the modern United Way of America, coordinated the charitable activities of local Jewish, Congregational and Catholic groups. Its work under the leadership of Frances Wisebart Jacobs ranged from work with tuberculosis patients to the care and education of young children and was funded in part by direct assistance from the city itself.

==Settlement House movement==
The Charity Organization Society can be compared to the settlement house movement which emphasised social reform rather than personal problems as the proper focus of charity.

== Efficacy and criticism ==
Despite its claims that private charity would be superior to public welfare because it improved the moral character of the recipients, records from the COS&#x27; Indianapolis branch show that only a minority of its relief recipients managed to become self-reliant, with the exit rate declining sharply the longer people were on relief. The exit rates are similar to those in late-20th-century public welfare programs, despite the fact that COS only granted relief only to recipients it deemed worthy and improvable. Furthermore, journals kept by the COS case workers and &quot;friendly visitors&quot; indicate that they were not on friendly terms with the relief recipients but described them in disparaging terms and interacted with them in an intrusive and presumptuous way.

The COS was resented by the poor for its harshness, and its acronym was rendered by critics as &quot;Cringe or Starve&quot;.

==Britain&#x27;s Charity Organisation Society==
In Britain, the Charity Organisation Society led by Helen Bosanquet and Octavia Hill was founded in London in 1869 and supported the concept of self-help and limited government intervention to deal with the effects of poverty. Alsager Hay Hill was prominent from its foundation, acting as honorary secretary of the council until July 1870, and as an active member of the council until 1880:

The organisation claimed to use &quot;scientific principles to root out scroungers and target relief where it was most needed&quot;. Annie Barnes joined the organisation and used her own background that people objected to accepting &quot;Charity&quot;. The Charity Organisation Society was renamed Family Welfare Association in 1946 and still operates today as Family Action, a registered family support charity.

<text>Stefan Postma (born 6 October 1976) is a Dutch former footballer who played as a goalkeeper. He is currently a goalkeeping coach at his last club, AGOVV Apeldoorn.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Postma started his professional career at FC Utrecht before moving to De Graafschap.

===Aston Villa===
Postma was signed by Aston Villa on 14 May 2002 for 1.5 million pounds, upon Peter Schmeichel&#x27;s transfer to Manchester City. Postma&#x27;s debut came as a substitute in a 0–1 defeat against Southampton on 21 October, following the dismissal of Peter Enckelman.

After newly appointed Villa manager David O&#x27;Leary purchased Danish keeper Thomas Sørensen, Postma became the club&#x27;s second choice goalkeeper at the club. He made two appearances in the 2003–04 season and three in 2004–05.

===Wolves===
Towards the end of his time at Villa, Postma was linked with transfers to several European clubs before going on loan to Wolverhampton Wanderers at the start of the 2005-06 season. In January 2006, he signed a contract to remain at Wolves until the end of the season. It was announced on 5 May that year that he would leave Wolves in the summer, and he returned to the Eredivisie with ADO Den Haag .

===Later career===
In August 2008, Postma rejoined former club De Graafschap on a six-month contract.

==Personal life==
In 2006, Postma became embroiled in a sex scandal when his ex-girlfriend posted a pornographic video featuring his partner penetrating him with a strapon on YouTube. The Mirror reported that Postma had &quot;originally managed to keep the video secret by buying it when his ex tried to sell it on eBay.&quot;

<text>Auki is the provincial capital of Malaita Province, Solomon Islands. It is situated on the northern end of Langa Langa Lagoon on the north-west coast of Malaita. It is one of the largest provincial towns in Solomon Islands. It was established as the administrative center for Malaita Province in 1909.

==Overview==

There are daily flights between the Solomon&#x27;s capital of Honiara (on Guadalcanal Island) and Auki. There are also regular shipping services between Honiara and Auki. The area is rich in culture and has become a central hub for many Malaitans who use the area to conduct a majority of trade and business in the province.

The town has electricity and the road is paved to the airport (approx. 11 km). The town has fruit, vegetables and fresh fish sold daily in the newly build market (built by Japanese Aid) located on the waterfront. Tourism is largely underdeveloped in Auki; it is immediately to the north of Langa Langa Lagoon, which provides opportunities for snorkeling, and the villagers provide shell making demonstrations.

The newly elected Member of Parliament in the 2010 elections for Auki-Langalanga constituency is Matthew Cooper Wale who was the former Minister of Education and Human Resources Development in the last government and is currently the Deputy Leader of Opposition. 
The fifth Anglican Bishop of Malaita, The Right Reverend Sam Sahu is based at the Diocesan office in Auki. He administers Malaita&#x27;s 42 parishes from Auki.

Correctional Services of Solomon Islands operates the Auki Correctional Centre in Auki.

<text>Westmont College is a private Christian liberal arts college in Montecito, California. It was founded in 1937.

==History==
Ruth Kerr, owner and CEO of the Kerr Glass Manufacturing Company, established the school as the Bible Missionary Institute in 1937 on the former Westlake School for Girls campus near Downtown Los Angeles. It was renamed the Western Bible College in 1939. During these early years, Kerr and the other founders decided that a liberal arts curriculum was the best direction for the school. In 1940 Wallace Emerson, the first president, renamed the school Westmont College, derived from a college in the west and in the mountains. He envisioned a Christian liberal arts college that would take its place among the best in the nation.

By 1944, Westmont College had outgrown its facilities in Los Angeles. After a failed attempt to move the campus to Altadena in early 1945, the desperate search for a new campus led Mrs. Kerr and the trustees to &quot;El Tejado&quot;, the former Dwight Murphy estate in Montecito. Westmont purchased this property and moved to the Santa Barbara area in the fall of 1945.

Set in the foothills of the Santa Ynez Mountains, Westmont&#x27;s wooded and scenic acres provide an environment for a residential college. The campus includes buildings and land from two former estates and the historic Deane School for Boys. The grounds still feature the pathways, stone bridges, and garden atmosphere typical of Montecito, a suburb of Santa Barbara.

While Westmont has sought to preserve and use the original structures, it has also built new facilities, including Voskuyl Library, the restored Westmont Art Center, the A. Nelson Science Building, the Murchison Gymnasium Complex, and the Ruth Kerr Memorial Student Center. In 2008 Westmont broke ground for the construction of the Winter Hall for Science and Mathematics and the Adams Center for the Visual Arts.

In 2006, Westmont received a gift pledge of $75 million from an anonymous donor, the second largest gift ever to a national liberal arts college at the time. In September 2009 Westmont was informed that the donor withdrew the pledged $75 million gift, which caused the college to put off construction of two new buildings.

=== Wildfires ===
Westmont is located in a high fire area with limited access via narrow winding roads. Campus buildings were burned in fires in 1964, 1977, and 2008, and the campus has been threatened or partially damaged by fires on multiple other occasions. The campus is routinely used as a staging area for firefighters when fires threaten the Montecito area. As a condition of approval of their Master Plan, Westmont agreed to a controversial &quot;shelter in place&quot; plan, also called &quot;stay and defend&quot; procedure, in case of a wildfire. The college has a comprehensive wildfire response plan in place.

==== Coyote Fire of 1964 ====
The Coyote Fire began on September 22, 1964, in a canyon near Westmont&#x27;s campus. The fire burned 75,000 acres and over 100 homes. Catherwood Hall, a men&#x27;s dorm on the Westmont campus, was destroyed.

==== Sycamore Canyon Fire of 1977 ====
The Sycamore Canyon Fire began on July 26, 1977, when a kite blew into power lines. Nearly 200 homes were burned, including several homes of Westmont employees, as well as 40 acres of undeveloped college property and part of an athletic field.

==== Tea Fire of 2008 ====
On November 13, 2008, the steep and wooded Westmont campus was heavily damaged in the Tea Fire, which started in the hills near Montecito. No injuries were reported on the campus. Numerous structures on the campus, including the Physics Lab, Psychology Building, Math Building, and 15 faculty homes were destroyed. The Clark residence hall was severely damaged. The Quonset Huts were also destroyed. Much of the campus&#x27;s landscaping, consisting of oaks, eucalyptus trees and semi-arid vegetation, was burned.

Flames were spotted above upper campus around 5:30 p.m. on November 13. Students were led to Murchison Gymnasium, where they remained until the situation outside was safe. Doors and openings were sealed with masking tape to prevent smoke entry and a ventilation system was activated. The American Red Cross provided blankets and pillows to the hundreds of Westmont students, neighbors, and Preview/Visiting students. In the early morning after the immediate danger had passed, students were allowed to access their cars in certain parking lots and leave the campus. Others remained in the gymnasium until they found a ride off campus. Friends, family, local churches, and other sources provided temporary housing to refugees.

Classes resumed December 1 with the semester ending, as originally planned, on December 19, 2008.

==== Thomas Fire of 2017 ====
The Westmont campus was evacuated in December 2017 due to the Thomas Fire. The last week of classes for the semester was cancelled, and final exams were administered as take-home exams. The campus was defended by a volunteer fire brigade, and it became one of the headquarters for CAL FIRE firefighting efforts. No campus buildings were destroyed, and students returned to start the spring semester as scheduled on January 8, 2018, only to evacuate again on January 10 because of the threat of mudslides following the fire. The combined risk of fire and mudslide led to a record five evacuations of campus during the 2017–2018 school year, but the campus ultimately suffered minimal damage.

==Campus==
Westmont College is located a few miles off of U.S. Route 101 just to the east of Santa Barbara. The city of Santa Barbara is on the central California coast and is 100 miles northwest of Los Angeles and 330 miles south of San Francisco.

The campus itself resides in the hills of Montecito and features of hills, gardens, and trees. A small creek runs through the campus, often dry during summer and autumn months and typically full during the rainy spring months. It has even flooded campus buildings in El Niño years.

The campus has six on-campus dorms and one off-campus residence hall. The two freshman dorms are Page Hall and Clark Hall, which are located at the upper corners of campus. Armington Hall, housing the largest number of students on campus, is at the lowest point on campus. Emerson Hall (formerly known as New Dorm and Everest), is at the top of campus and has ocean views in many of its rooms. Emerson Hall houses first-year students, transfer students, and second-year students. Van Kampen Hall is located in the center of the campus and was renovated and modernized in the summer of 2006. The Global Leadership Center is Westmont&#x27;s newest residence hall, consisting of three separate buildings, North and South residence halls and the center, which includes a classroom, seminar room, lounge, offices, and a coffee shop. Some upperclass students live in the Ocean View Apartments, a college-owned apartment building on the east side of Santa Barbara located three miles from campus.

==Academics==
Westmont was ranked 108th in the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; &quot;America&#x27;s Best Colleges 2019&quot; list of liberal arts colleges. In 2016 &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked Westmont No. 236 out of the 660 best private and public colleges and universities in America. The Templeton Foundation has recognized Westmont as one of the nation&#x27;s top 100 colleges committed to character development.
Westmont offers 26 majors and has a student/faculty ratio of 12 to 1 with 96 percent of tenured and tenure-track faculty having earned terminal degrees. The average class size is 18 students. The students come from 25 states, 11 countries, and 33 Christian denominations. The four-year graduation rate is 87 percent.

===Off-campus programs===
Off-campus programs are an important part of the Westmont experience with over 60 percent of students participating in a program at some point in their studies. Westmont offers a number of off-campus programs. These programs are run with a faculty member and include the Europe semester, England Semester, Westmont in Mexico, Westmont in the Middle East, and Westmont in San Francisco Urban program. A limited number of students may request a spot to participate in semester exchanges at one of the colleges in the Christian College Consortium, such as Gordon College, Houghton College, Seattle Pacific University, and Wheaton College (IL). Additionally, some students can apply to participate in other qualifying programs, including semesters in New Zealand, Belize, Washington DC, Chile, Italy, France, and Lithuania. 

Students receive transferable credit while they live and study abroad in these different programs. Some students work in internships while they are off campus, and many choose the Westmont in San Francisco program for this purpose.

==Student life==

===LGBT prohibition===
Westmont student policy forbids gay marriage and all sex or intimacy outside of heterosexual marriage. Students must agree to avoid &quot;homosexual practice&quot; which has at times been understood to forbid not only same-sex sexual activity and relationships but also coming out of the closet. Alumni have reported to outside media organizations they feared expulsion if their sexuality was discovered. Professors are allegedly forbidden from discussing homosexuality in front of students.

In May 2023, Westmont president Gaylee Bebee sent a letter to the United States Department of Education seeking assurance that Westmont could legally discriminate against students on the basis of sexual orientation. Westmont is exempt from certain sections of Title IX (meaning they can discriminate against certain students as they see fit), even though they claim otherwise of their website.

There is an &quot;official-unofficial&quot; group for LGBT students called Gradient. The group meets in secret to maintain confidentiality and is not officially recognized by the school.

===Spring Sing===
Westmont hosts a popular annual student event &quot;Spring Sing,&quot; which in past years has been held at the Santa Barbara County Bowl or UC Santa Barbara auditorium. This event is a competition between the dorms with eight-minute musical comedy skits.

The skits incorporate an average of four or five clips of popular songs with altered original lyrics and original choreography. The lyrics are usually changed to reflect a humorous progression of the skit&#x27;s main story. The dorm that wins has bragging rights for the next year.

===Potter&#x27;s Clay===
&quot;Potter&#x27;s Clay&quot; is a popular ministry program that occurs every year in Ensenada, Mexico, during Westmont&#x27;s spring break. Students interact with the local population and churches to help with construction, Vacation Bible School, and medical work.

==Media==
Westmont maintained a radio station named Spark Radio until 2010.

&quot;The Horizon&quot; is the on-campus student newspaper. 

==Athletics==

The Westmont athletic teams are called the Warriors. The college is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Golden State Athletic Conference (GSAC) for most of its sports since the 1986–87 academic year; while its women&#x27;s swimming team competes in the Pacific Collegiate Swim and Dive Conference (PCSC).

Westmont competes in 15 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, tennis and track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, swimming, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball.

===Move to NCAA Division II===
On July 14, 2022, Westmont College has been notified by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) that it has been accepted into the multi-year membership process for Division II, while subsequently joining the Pacific West Conference (PacWest), effective beginning the 2023–24 academic year.

<doc id="1315593" wikidata="Q246379" url="?curid=1315593" title="Mark Delaney (footballer)">
<text>Mark Anthony Delaney (born 13 May 1976) is a Welsh former professional footballer who manages Coventry City under-21s. He played for Carmarthen Town, Cardiff City and Aston Villa as a right-back. He is also a former member of the Wales national team, gaining 36 caps during his career. In doing so, he became the first player to progress from the Cymru Premier to the senior national side.

==Early life==
Delaney was raised in Goodwick, Pembrokeshire by his parents Mike and Angelina. He is of Italian descent, with his maternal grandparents having moved to Wales after World War II. He attended Ysgol Bro Gwaun (located in Fishguard). He is a fluent Welsh speaker.

==Club career==

===Carmarthen Town and Cardiff City===
As a youngster, Delaney played in the youth system at Manchester United but was released after he was deemed too small. After playing for local amateur side Goodwick United, Delaney joined League of Wales side Carmarthen Town in 1996, later becoming club captain at 20 years of age. He was spotted by Cardiff City manager Frank Burrows and joined the club on 1 June 1998 on a free transfer. He made 40 appearances in all competitions for Cardiff, scoring once in the FA Cup against Chester City on 14 November 1998, between his purchase and his sale to Aston Villa eight months later on 9 March 1999 for £500,000. Delaney had been travelling to an away match with Cardiff against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion when he was informed of the transfer by manager Frank Burrows on their arrival.

===Aston Villa===
The day after his transfer was completed, Delaney&#x27;s father drove him to Birmingham and he travelled with the first-team for their match against Derby County. One month later, Delaney was handed his Premier League debut by manager John Gregory, replacing Steve Stone in the final ten minutes of a 3–1 victory over Nottingham Forest on 24 April 1999. He made just one further appearance for the club during the final matches of the 1998–99 season, during a 1–0 defeat to Arsenal. After a full pre-season with Villa, Gregory promoted Delaney to first choice right-back ahead of Steve Watson at the start of the following season. Delaney credits Gregory with improving his performances during his early career with Villa, Gregory singling out Delaney during his seventh appearance for the side, describing him as &quot;playing like a tart&quot; during the half-time team talk. Delaney went on to score the only goal of the game in the second half of the match as his side defeated Watford 1–0.

During his first season at Villa Park, the club finished in sixth place in the league, reached the semi-final of the League Cup and the final of the FA Cup, Delaney playing the full match as Villa lost 1–0 to Chelsea. He made 193 first appearances for Aston Villa in all competitions, with two goals coming against Watford on 24 August 1999 and Everton on 26 December 2005. He has also gained 36 international caps with the Wales national team.

Delaney&#x27;s Aston Villa career was tempered with knee injuries, which he attributes to his willingness to fly into tackles as a youngster hoping to impress. Delaney travelled to see noted American knee specialist Richard Steadman in an attempt to end the injuries, but was informed by the surgeon that it was unlikely that Delaney would return to playing football following extensive surgery. Delaney was out of contract at Aston Villa in summer 2007 and was hoping to impress Martin O&#x27;Neill enough to win a new contract. However, on 15 August 2007, he announced his retirement from football due to his injury problems.

== Coaching career ==
On 5 September 2007, Delaney stated he was hoping to go into coaching, and in 2008, Delaney re-joined Aston Villa as a youth coach. In 2015, Delaney was named head coach of the Aston Villa F.C. Under-23s squad.

On 8 January 2021, Aston Villa were forced to name a squad full of academy players for an FA Cup third round tie against Liverpool due to a COVID-19 outbreak at Villa&#x27;s Bodymoor Heath Training Ground. First team coach Dean Smith was unable to attend as he had to self-isolate, so Delaney acted as first team coach for that game. Aston Villa lost the game 4–1, but were praised for the performance of their young, inexperienced side.

On 20 May 2022, it was announced that Delaney had left Aston Villa, after 14 years at the club in various coaching roles.

On 7 September 2023, Delaney was appointed lead professional development phase coach at Coventry City, who will take charge of the under 18s. On 9 August 2024, Delaney was appointed a first-team coach at the club along with under 21s coach John Dempster. On 30 November 2024, Delaney was appointed the club’s new senior professional development phase coach taking charge of the under-21s.

<text>Wacky Wheels is a kart racing video game released by Apogee Software for MS-DOS in 1994. The game strongly resembles &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; from the Super NES, but the karts are described as lawn mowers and the eight playable characters (panda, moose, pelican, raccoon, shark, camel, elephant and tiger) are animals from a zoo.

The game was re-released on GOG.com with support for Microsoft Windows, Linux, and macOS on August 20, 2014, then for Steam on May 6, 2015 as part of the &quot;3D Realms Anthology&quot;.

==Gameplay==

While racing, players can collect hedgehogs, bombs and other objects that can be used to shoot or distract opponents. The game features both single and multiplayer play, with split-screen, modem, or direct serial link. In multiplayer mode, two human players can either race against each other or battle in special arenas where the sole purpose is to hit the opponent a certain number of times with hedgehogs. This last gaming mode, called &quot;Wacky shoot-out&quot;, is similar to the classic deathmatch mode from first-person shooter games or the Battle Mode of &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot;.

The game was and still is distributed as shareware, with only a few characters and courses active. Registration is required to unlock the remaining characters and courses. It is also the first game to feature a Dopefish cameo appearance.

==Development==
Developers Andy Edwardson and Shaun Gadalla of &quot;Wacky Wheels&quot; were inspired by &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot;, and wished to create a similar experience on the personal computer. During development, he sent out a playable demo that included its source code to Copysoft to canvas interest in funding the project. They rejected it and instead Apogee began funding development. However, just prior to the release of &quot;Wacky Wheels&quot;, Copysoft released a similar game titled &quot;Skunny Kart&quot;. Edwardson and Gadalla accused Copysoft of copyright infringement, noting the similarity in the games, but no legal action was ever taken.

==Sequel==
In 2014 Cascadia Games acquired the rights to &quot;Wacky Wheels&quot; from Apogee and was working on a sequel/remake of the game. The game called &quot;Wacky Wheels HD&quot; was released on Steam and Itch.io in Fall 2016. It was later withdrawn from Steam, and is no longer available.

<doc id="1315616" wikidata="Q257913" url="?curid=1315616" title="Kōhaku Uta Gassen">
<text>, more commonly known simply as Kōhaku, is an annual New Year&#x27;s Eve television special produced by Japanese public broadcaster NHK. It is broadcast live simultaneously on television and radio, nationally and internationally by the NHK network and by some overseas (mainly cable) broadcasters who buy the program. The show ends shortly before midnight. Before the show began broadcasting on television in late 1953, the show was held on 3 January and only consisted of a radio broadcast.

The program divides the most popular music artists of the year into competing teams of red and white. The &quot;red&quot; team or is composed of all female artists (or groups with female vocals), while the &quot;white&quot; team or is all male (or groups with male vocals). At the end of the show, judges and the audience vote to decide which group performed better. The honor of performing on &quot;Kōhaku&quot; is strictly by invitation, so only the most successful singing acts in the Japanese entertainment industry can perform. In addition to the actual music performances, the costumes, hair-styles, makeup, dancing, and lighting are given focus. A performance on the show is regarded as a highlight in singers&#x27; careers due to the show&#x27;s wide reach.

==Song selection process==
The songs and performers are examined by a selection committee put together by NHK. The basis for selection are record sales and adaptability to the edition&#x27;s theme.

At the same time, a demographic survey is conducted regarding the most popular singers for each and what kind of music people want to hear. This and the song selection explain the of the musical genres and its artists.

There are, however, exceptions to the process. Momoe Yamaguchi chose to sing her favorite song &quot;Hito Natsu no Keiken&quot; (ひと夏の経験) with its suggestive lyrics during the 25th edition, despite NHK&#x27;s pick of a different song.

==Show==
When the show was first broadcast on radio in 1951, each team had a few performers, all of whom would perform within an hour. Since 1989, the program goes on for at least four hours as both teams, each having at least 25 performers, perform their songs.

At the end of the show, the audience and a panel of judges—notable celebrities who may or may not have a connection to the music industry—vote to select the winning team. In the past, the audience vote has been composed of a head count of the venue audience members, who could vote for either team (NHK Hall, which has been the venue for most &quot;Kōhaku&quot; editions since 1971, can seat 3,000 people). This counted as one vote.

As of the 54th (2003) and 55th editions (2004), viewers who watch the program through ISDB-S on NHK BS Hi-vision could vote by having their own head count in their respective households. Although it was still sketchy to determine in the 55th, the audience vote was counted as two votes: one for the venue audience and one for ISDB-S viewers.

The audience vote(s) are added to those of the judges who each have to vote for one team. The team with the most votes wins.

The above process was done differently for the 56th edition (2005). Instead, the NHK Hall head count, the vote count from cellphone users and the vote count from ISDB-S viewers each counted as one vote. As stated above, the team that got at least two votes won.

In the 57th edition (2006), aside from cellphone and ISDB-S viewers and the NHK Hall audience, 1seg users voted. Its format had been reverted to the ball voting system—from the audience head count and the judges&#x27; votes.

From the 58th edition (2007) to the 63rd edition (2012) and again in the 65th (2014), 66th (2015), and 68th (2017) through 70th editions (2019), the winner was determined through an overall head count, all from cellphone, ISDB-S viewers, 1seg users, and the NHK Hall Audience (including guests). Voting reverted temporarily to judges plus audience-unit votes in the 64th edition (2013) and 67th (2016) except that viewing audience votes (from internet, cellphone, digital TV, and 1seg voting) during halftime and end of show would each count as one vote and the NHK Hall head count as another single vote. The 71st edition (2020) featured off-venue voting only as there was no live audience in attendance due to concerns that arose from the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. The 71st edition also saw performances emanating from multiple venues within NHK&#x27;s studio premises with NHK Hall still the main staging area.

Aside from the performances, there are special performances where certain performers do their act together, the so-called &quot;Ring Show&quot; where performers from both teams take part in a &quot;singing exercise,&quot; as well as performances from non-competing artists both in Japan and abroad. At the end of the show, all the performers sing &quot;Hotaru no Hikari&quot; (蛍の光) together. The song is based on the Scottish &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; that is commonly sung at New Year parties in the west. In addition, the 50th edition of the show included a &quot;Countdown Special&quot; to welcome the year 2000.

==Popularity==
&quot;Kōhaku&quot; was once the most-watched show on Japanese television of the year. One major factor was that New Year&#x27;s Eve in Japan is a holiday traditionally spent at home (see Ōmisoka). Over the years, the annual event&#x27;s popularity has declined from an all-time high of an 81.4 rating in 1963 to a low of 30.6 in the Kantō region for the first part of the 2006 event. The 2021 &quot;Kōhaku&quot; program set a record low for the second portion of the show with a 34.3 viewership rating in the Kantō region. Despite the drop, &quot;Kōhaku&quot; is consistently the top-rated musical event each year.

Outside Japan, Taiwan also hosts a similar &quot;Kōhaku&quot; competition, &quot;Super Star&quot; (超級巨星紅白藝能大賞), which broadcasts on the eve of Chinese New Year. Similar to &quot;Kōhaku&quot;, the special is held at a live venue, Taipei Arena. Unlike &quot;Kōhaku&quot;, &quot;Super Star&quot; does not have gender-affiliated teams and the special is pre-recorded weeks before airing instead of being a live broadcast. The first special premiered on February 13, 2010, the eve of the 2010&#x27;s Chinese New Year. The most recent special was set to be broadcast on February 9, 2024.

<doc id="1315628" wikidata="Q432262" url="?curid=1315628" title="Until It Sleeps">
<text>&quot;Until It Sleeps&quot; is a song by American heavy metal band Metallica, released on May 20, 1996, as the lead single from their sixth studio album &quot;Load&quot;. &quot;Until It Sleeps&quot; reached number ten on the Billboard Hot 100 making it Metallica&#x27;s highest charting single and only top ten hit in the United States. The song was also their first number-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, peaked in the top five in the United Kingdom, and reached number-one in Australia, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, and Sweden. The song&#x27;s music video, directed by Samuel Bayer and inspired by the paintings of Hieronymus Bosch, won the Best Hard Rock Video award at the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards.

==Versions==
An early demo version of this song was entitled &quot;F.O.B.D.&quot; (recorded on December 8, 1995) because it reminded the band members of the Soundgarden song &quot;Fell on Black Days&quot;, in that the &quot;It grips you...It stains you...&quot; refrain is in the same 6/4 time signature that &quot;Fell on Black Days&quot; is in. The band can be heard saying &quot;Fell on Black Days&quot; on the fanclub-only Fancan 1 CD just prior to jamming on a portion of &quot;Until It Sleeps&quot;. The 10-inch vinyl version of the single is red in color. Moby, credited as &quot;Herman Melville&quot;, did an industrial-sounding remix used as a B-side.

&quot;Until It Sleeps&quot; became the first &quot;officially&quot; pirated MP3 when it was released by Compress &#x27;Da Audio (a piracy group and spinoff of the Warez scene) via an Internet Relay Chat network on August 10, 1996. An EFnet member on the #mpeg3 IRC channel named Coyote666 was responsible for creating the first mp3 ripping software.

Moby produced a remix of the song, titled &quot;Until It Sleeps (Herman Melville Mix)&quot;. The song was performed with orchestral accompaniment on the album &quot;S&amp;M&quot;.

==Lyrics==
The lyrics of the song, written by Hetfield, address his mother&#x27;s battle with cancer, to which the &quot;it&quot; in the title refers. They can be seen as either describing the emotional pain he feels for the loss, or the physical pain his mother was feeling while she was ill. Both of his parents were Christian Scientists, and did not believe in medicine. The lyrics are also interpreted as dealing with anger issues. Hetfield&#x27;s father, Virgil, died in late 1996, during Metallica&#x27;s Load tour.

==Music video==
The song also has a music video directed by Samuel Bayer (Nirvana, Green Day, The Smashing Pumpkins). It was shot in various locations around Los Angeles on May 6 and 7 in 1996. It was premiered by MTV on May 21. The video depicts surreal concepts dealing with the fall of man, taken from various paintings by Hieronymus Bosch. Apart from the general forms inspired from Bosch&#x27;s paintings, the prominent figures in the video are the human-eating monster from &quot;The Garden of Earthly Delights&quot;, the fall of Adam and Eve from &quot;Haywain&quot; and Christ in the &quot;Crucifige Eum&quot; (Crucify Him) scene of &quot;Ecce Homo&quot;. The video won the MTV Video Music Award for Best Rock Video in 1996.

==Awards==
The song won a 1996 Metal Edge Readers&#x27; Choice Award for Song of the Year.

<text>Pier Paolo Vergerio ( 1498 – 4 October 1565), the Younger, was an Italian papal nuncio and later Protestant reformer.

==Life==
He was born at Capodistria (Koper), Istria, then part of the Venetian Republic and studied jurisprudence in Padua, where he delivered lectures in 1522. He also practiced law in Verona, Padua, and Venice. In 1526, he married Diana Contarini, whose early death was at least a partial cause of his entering an ecclesiastical career.

===Papal nuncio===
His advancement was so rapid that as early as 1533 he was papal nuncio to King Ferdinand in Germany, and he was there again in 1535 on business connected with the council. The nuncio&#x27;s eagerness in the cause of the council brought him into a personal encounter with Martin Luther at Wittenberg.

Although Vergerio achieved little in the way of his appointed task, which was to induce the Protestants to send delegates to the council, Pope Paul III twice dispatched him across the Alps; and meanwhile rewarded him, first with the bishopric of Modruš in Croatia, and in the year 1536 with the bishopric of Capodistria. In the year 1540, Vergerio again entered active diplomatic service; he was at Worms at the religious conference as commissioner for King Francis I of France. It was in memory of the council that he dedicated the tract &quot;De unitate et pace ecclesiae&quot;. Like Cardinal Contarini, beside whom he also appeared at the religious conference of Regensburg in 1541, he was charged with having conceded too much to the Protestants. He then resolved to return to Capodistria and pursue thorough studies.

Vergerio had yet no thought of withdrawing from the Catholic Church, nor did he overstep the line of reformatory attempts within that Church, such as were espoused by Contarini and others. But suspicion was awakened such that on 13 December 1544, a denunciation of Vergerio was lodged with the Venetian Inquisition. Although, after due examination, Vergerio was released, Cardinal Marcello Cervini, later Pope Marcellus II, took advantage of the fact that Vergerio was not yet formally absolved to prevent his participation in the council for which he had laboured so many years.

Vergerio had to return from Riva and began a publishing activity which turned more and more against the Catholic Church. In connection with the death of Francesco Spiera and Vergerio&#x27;s summary of the circumstances of 7 December 1548, Vergerio directed a sharp reply to the bishop of Padua.

===Exile===
Instead of responding to a second summons by the Nuncio Della Casa to appear before the tribunal in Venice, on 1 May 1549, he left Italy forever. The experiences at Spiera&#x27;s sick-bed had brought Vergerio to a decision. The twelve treatises which he produced at Basel in 1550 supply information regarding his position. Meanwhile, the second trial had been conducted in Venice &quot;in absentia&quot; and was confirmed in Rome, 3 July 1549. Vergerio was convicted of heresy in 34 points, deposed from his episcopal dignity, and made subject to arrest.

At that time, however, he was in the Swiss Grisons and became active in a brisk round of polemics. His themes were the papacy, its origin and policy; the jubilees; saint and relic veneration, and the like. Vergerio continued in the Grisons till 1553 when he heeded a call from Duke Christopher of Württemberg to write and travel on behalf of Evangelical doctrine. 

Although at first opposed to Primož Trubar, the consolidator of Slovene as a language, he later supported him and was his mentor for some time. He also contributed to the development of Croatian literature. In 1554 and 1555 he talked Trubar to start the translation of the Bible into Slovene. This resulted in Trubar&#x27;s translation of the &quot;Gospel of Matthew&quot; in 1555, which was the first integral translation of a part of the Bible to this language, and later led to Trubar translating the entire New Testament into Slovene. A bust by Oreste Dequel was put on display in 1954 at Vergerio Square () in Koper, the main coastal port town of Slovenia.

While Vergerio never again set foot in Italy, in 1556 he made his way to Poland, and conferred with Duke Albrecht of Prussia. He was in Poland in 1559 with the two-fold object of meeting the moves of the Nuncio Alois Lipomano, and of working counter to Johannes a Lasco. He sought permission to take part in the religious conference at Poissy in 1560, but he was not allowed to appear at the Council of Trent as the duke&#x27;s delegate. During all these years he continued his polemical authorship and worked toward the publication of his &quot;Opera&quot;, though only the first volume appeared (1563). He died in Tübingen.

<text>The &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Theatre Awards, established in 1955, are the oldest theatrical awards ceremony in the United Kingdom. They are presented annually for outstanding achievements in London Theatre, and are organised by the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; newspaper. They are the West End&#x27;s equivalent to Broadway&#x27;s Drama Desk Awards.

==Trophies==
The trophies take the form of a modelled statuette, a figure representing Drama, designed by Frank Dobson RA, a former Professor of Sculpture at the Royal College of Art.

==Categories==
Three of the awards are given in the names of former &quot;Evening Standard&quot; notables:

*Arts editor Sydney Edwards (who conceived the awards, and died suddenly in July 1979) for the Best Director category.
*Editor Charles Wintour (who as deputy-editor in 1955, launched the awards after a nod from the proprietor, Lord Beaverbrook&#x27;) for Most Promising Playwright.
*Long-serving theatre critic Milton Shulman (for several years a key member of the judging panel) for the Outstanding Newcomer award.

In 2009, the Special Award was given in the name of Evgeny Lebedev, executive director of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;.

In 1980, noting the first use of the Special Award category, Shulman observed that &quot;In 1968 the judges felt that Alan Bennett&#x27;s work &quot;Forty Years On&quot; did not fit either the category of a Play or a Musical. But since they liked it so much they gave him the coveted Dobson statuette as a Special Award. In a quarter of a century, only in 1968 had no-one been designated as &#x27;Promising&#x27; although it could conceivably be argued that Alan Bennett&#x27;s Special Award was a reasonable substitute for this category.&quot;

The Special Award process came to a climax in 2004 when, in the 50th anniversary year, the category was used to signal peaks of accomplishment by the National Theatre (an institution), Harold Pinter (a playwright) and Dame Judi Dench (a performer).

The Patricia Rothermere Award, presented biennially from 1999 to 2005, was created to honour the memory of Patricia Harmsworth, Viscountess Rothermere, wife of Viscount Rothermere, chairman of the Daily Mail and General Trust, which formerly owned the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;. The two part award recognised those who had given outstanding support to young actors, while also providing a three-year scholarship award for a drama student.

Commencing in 2009, the Best Actress award was renamed in tribute to Natasha Richardson, who died after a skiing accident in Quebec in March 2009.

<text>The see-see partridge (Ammoperdix griseogularis) is a gamebird in the pheasant family Phasianidae of the order Galliformes, gallinaceous birds.

This partridge has its main native range from southeast Turkey through Syria and Iraq east to Iran and Pakistan. It is closely related and similar to its counterpart in Egypt and Arabia, the sand partridge, &quot;Ammoperdix heyi&quot;.

This 22–25 cm bird is a resident breeder in dry, open and often hilly country. It nests in a scantily lined ground scrape laying 8-16 eggs. The see-see partridge takes a wide variety of seeds and some insect food.

See-see partridge is a rotund bird, mainly sandy-brown with wavy white and brown flank stripes. The male has a grey head with a black stripe through the eye and a white cheek patch. The neck sides are speckled with white. The head pattern is the best distinction from sand partridge.

The female is a very washed-out version of the male, and is more difficult to distinguish from its relative due to the weak head pattern.

Usually it is seen in pairs or, at the most, in flocks of two to four birds. But flocks of more than fifty birds have also been seen.

When disturbed, see-see partridge prefers to run rather than fly, but if necessary it flies a short distance on rounded wings. The song is a whistled &quot;hwit-hwit-hwit&quot;.

<text>Michael Robert Green (22 February 1944 – 11 January 2010) was an English rock and roll guitarist who played with The Pirates (with and without Johnny Kidd), Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas, and Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers.

==Biography==
Born Michael Robert Green, in Matlock, Derbyshire, Green grew up in the same block of flats in Wimbledon, south-west London, as the future Pirates. He devoured skiffle and early rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll, and began his career in 1956 playing in a skiffle trio &quot;The Wayfaring Strangers&quot;, formed with his schoolmates Johnny Spence (on bass) and Frank Farley (on drums), which came second in a bands competition to The Quarrymen, an early incarnation of the Beatles. After a stint as the Ramrods, the trio then joined Red-E-Lewis and the Redcaps, who became the Redcaps, backing Cuddly Dudley, when Reddy Lewis left. In 1962, all three then joined Johnny Kidd and the Pirates – formed by Kidd during the 1950s – just after the band had scored a huge hit with Shakin&#x27; All Over, with Joe Moretti on lead guitar. Green left to join Billy J. Kramer with The Dakotas in 1964. His ability to play lead and rhythm guitar simultaneously influenced a number of British guitarists to follow, including Pete Townshend and Wilko Johnson, the original guitarist for Dr. Feelgood. Green&#x27;s song &quot;Oyeh!&quot; was on Dr. Feelgood&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Down by the Jetty&quot;; and a song he co-wrote, &quot;Going Back Home&quot; appeared on Dr. Feelgood&#x27;s 1975 &quot;Malpractice&quot; and the live album, &quot;Stupidity&quot; (1976). Green was also a member of the band Shanghai, which released two albums, in 1974 and 1976, other members included, Chuck Bedford (vocals, harmonica, 1974–1975), Pete Kircher (drums, vocals), Mike Le Main (bass, keyboards, 1974–1975), Cliff Bennett of Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers (vocals, 1975–1976), Brian Alterman (guitar, 1975–1976), Pat King (bass, 1975–1976).

Green reformed the Pirates with Farley and Spence in 1976 (Kidd having died in 1966). Over the next five years they became one of the hardest-gigging bands on the road and released four albums: &quot;Out of Their Skulls&quot; (1977), &quot;Skull Wars&quot; (1978), &quot;Happy Birthday Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll&quot; (1979) and the ten-inch &quot;A Fistful of Dubloons&quot; (1981). Green played the Fender Telecaster Custom produced in 1972 as his main guitar.

Green was also a member of the band Shanghai, which released two albums, in 1974 and 1976, and supported Status Quo on their &quot;Blue for You&quot; tour. Together with Quo member Alan Lancaster he wrote four songs recorded by Status Quo.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Green played with, amongst others, Bryan Ferry, Van Morrison, Paul McCartney, Robert Plant and Lemmy, as well as the Pirates, with whom he continued to gig well into the 2000s. His other notable gigs included playing guitar for Van Morrison on the Pyramid Stage at the Glastonbury Festival in 2005, and with David Gilmour and Paul McCartney at the latter&#x27;s return to the Cavern Club in support of his &quot;Run Devil Run&quot; album in 1999.

In his spare time he taught guitar privately, as well as at various local schools.

In 1990, Green played guitar with Lemmy and the Upsetters on their &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; / &quot;Paradise&quot; single. The A-side was originally recorded for a charity album, and Green wrote the B-side with Motorhead&#x27;s Lemmy Kilmister for this occasional Upsetters project.

From 1999 to 2008, Green performed regularly with the Van Morrison band. He played guitar on 1999&#x27;s &quot;Back on Top&quot; and he appeared on his other studio albums up until he was on five of the tracks on Van Morrison&#x27;s 2008 album, &quot;Keep It Simple&quot;.

In 2007, he recorded a six track mini-album, &quot;Cutthroat and Dangerous&quot; in Finland with the Finnish rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll trio, Doctor&#x27;s Order.

In February 2004, while on stage with Bryan Ferry in Auckland, New Zealand, Green suffered a cardiac arrest. His life was saved by two doctors in the crowd and following his return to England and recovery he carried on playing. He suffered kidney problems in February 2009, partly connected with his earlier heart problem.

==Death==
Mick Green died of heart failure on 11 January 2010 in King George Hospital, Ilford, Essex. His wife Karen, sons Lloyd and Brad and daughter-in-law Hannah were at his side. In light of his death, The Pirates disbanded.

On 27 November 2010, the Mick Green tribute gig was held at the 100 Club and featured the Animals and the Wilko Johnson Band. Fellow Pirate shipmate and close friend Johnny Spence closed the evening together with Mick&#x27;s two sons (Brad on guitar and Lloyd on bass) performing several of the Pirates&#x27; back catalogue. His son Lloyd Green now plays bass guitar in critically acclaimed Blues rock band The Milk Men.

<text>The State Route System in Alabama uses the standard numbering convention: odd numbers signify a north–south state route, and even numbers signify an east–west route. Often more than one route number shares the same roadway, so identifying which route the mile markers are for is often difficult.

In no case does a state route number mirror a U.S. Highway number. As such, the following state routes do not exist: 11, 29, 31, 43, 45, 72, 78, 80, 82, 84, 90, 98, 231, 278, 280, 331, 411, or 431.

<doc id="1315682" wikidata="Q960084" url="?curid=1315682" title="Eugene Fodor (violinist)">
<text>Eugene Nicholas Fodor, Jr. (March 5, 1950 – February 26, 2011) was an American classical violinist.

Fodor was born in Denver, Colorado. His first 10 years of study were with Harold Wippler, who taught him from 1958 until 1968. Wippler observed that &quot;It was very apparent that he had exceptional talent. Not just technical talent but a great, unusual understanding of music.&quot; He then studied at the Juilliard School in New York City, Indiana University Bloomington and the University of Southern California, where his teachers included Ivan Galamian, Josef Gingold and Jascha Heifetz, respectively.

Fodor made his solo debut with the Denver Symphony Orchestra at the age of 10, playing Max Bruch&#x27;s Violin Concerto No. 1, and began touring as a soloist while still a young teenager.

Fodor won numerous national contests before the age of 17, including First Prize in both the Merriweather Post Competition in Washington, D.C., and the Young Musicians Foundation Competition in Los Angeles.

Fodor went on to win first prize in the Paganini Competition in Italy in 1972, at the age of 22. It was this win that gained him widespread public attention. He achieved the highest prize awarded (second prize, shared with two other violinists since first prize was not awarded that year) in the International Tchaikovsky Competition in 1974 in Moscow, Russia. This award raised his profile further, as an American sharing the top Soviet prize during the height of the Cold War. He signed a recording contract with RCA Red Seal and was a frequent guest on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. Fodor was also awarded the European Soloist award &quot;Prix Europeen du Soliste&quot; in January 1999.

Fodor appeared on the television comedy program SCTV, broadcast on NBC on 20 November 1981 in a parody of the Joan Crawford movie &quot;Humoresque&quot; called &quot;New York Rhapsody&quot;.

Fodor&#x27;s career declined in the 1980s. An arrest for drug possession on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard in 1989 resulted in negative publicity. Though he continued concertizing until shortly before his death and made recordings through the 2000s, high-profile appearances such as he had made in the years following his Moscow win became a thing of the past. After years of battling alcohol and drug addiction, Fodor died from cirrhosis in Arlington County, Virginia, on February 26, 2011, at the age of 60. His first marriage was to Susan Davis in 1978. They divorced in 1986. His second marriage to Sally Swedlund, whom he married in 1996, also ended in divorce in 2009. He remarried Ms. Davis in November 2010. He and Susan had three children and two grandchildren.

<text>The Maitraka dynasty ruled the Kingdom of Valabhi in western India from approximately 475 to 776 from their capital at Vallabhi. With the sole exception of Dharapaṭṭa (the fifth king in the dynasty), who is associated with sun-worship, they were followers of Shaivism. Their origin is uncertain but they were probably Suryavanshi Kshatriyas.

Following the decline of the Gupta Empire, Maitraka dynasty was founded by &quot;Senapati&quot; (general) Bhaṭārka, who was a military governor of Saurashtra descanths of kanaksen In the under Gupta Empire, who had established himself as the independent around 475 CE. The first two Maitraka rulers Bhaṭārka and Dharasena I used only the title of &quot;Senapati&quot; (general). The third ruler Droṇasiṁha declared himself as the &quot;Maharaja&quot;. During the reign Dhruvasena I, Jain council at Vallabhi was probably held. The next ruler Dharapaṭṭa is the only ruler considered as a sun-worshipper. King Guhasena stopped using the term &quot;Paramabhattaraka Padanudhyata&quot; along his name like his predecessors, which denotes the cessation of displaying of the nominal allegiance to the Gupta overlords. He was succeeded by his son Dharasena II, who used the title of &quot;Mahadhiraja&quot;. His son, the next ruler Śilāditya I Dharmāditya was described by Hiuen Tsang, visited in 640 CE, as a &quot;monarch of great administrative ability and of rare kindness and compassion&quot;. Śilāditya I was succeeded by his younger brother Kharagraha I. Virdi copperplate grant (616 CE) of Kharagraha I proves that his territories included Ujjain. During the reign of the next ruler, Dharasena III, north Gujarat was included in this kingdom. Dharasena II was succeeded by another son of Kharagraha I, Dhruvasena II, Balāditya. He married the daughter of Harṣavardhana. His son Dharasena IV assumed the imperial titles of &quot;Paramabhattaraka Mahrajadhiraja Parameshvara Chakravartin&quot;. Sanskrit poet Bhatti was his court poet. The next powerful ruler of this dynasty was Śilāditya II. During the reign of Śilāditya V, Arabs probably invaded this kingdom. The last known ruler of this dynasty was Śilāditya VI.

Maitrakas set up a Vallabhi University which came to be known far and wide for its scholastic pursuits and was compared with the Nalanda University. They came under the rule of Harṣa of Vardhana dynasty in the mid-seventh century, but retained local autonomy, and regained their independence after Harṣa&#x27;s death. After repeated attacks by Arabs from the sea, the kingdom had weakened considerably. The dynasty ended by 783 CE. Apart from legendary accounts which connect fall of Vallabi with the Tajjika (Arab) invasions, no historical source mention how the dynasty ended.

More than hundred temples of this period are known, mostly located along the western coast of Saurashtra.

==Origin==

Early scholars like Fleet had misread copperplate grant and considered Maitrakas as some foreign tribe defeated by Bhaṭārka. Bhagwanlal Indraji believed that Maitrakas were foreign tribe while Bhaṭārka, who defeated them, belonged to the indigenous dynasty. Later readings corrected that Bhaṭārka was himself Maitraka who had succeeded in many battles and descanths of Kosala kingdom ( Solar dynasty). The earlier scholars had suggested the name Maitraka is derived from Mithra, the Sun or solar deity, and their supposed connection to Mihira and their sun-worshiping inclination.

Though Mitra and Mihira are synonyms for the sun, the Sanskrit literature does not use it in sense of sun-worshipers. Dharapaṭṭa is the fifth and the only king of all Maitraka kings connected with sun-worship. All other kings were followers of Shaivism.

The copperplate grants do not help in identifying their origin, they describe only that the dynasty was born from a war-like tribe whose capital was at Vallabhi and they were Shaivas. Chinese traveler Hieun-Tsang visited Vallabhi during the second quarter of the 7th century had described the ruler as a Kshatriya. Later Mahayana Buddhist work &quot;
Dr khemraj raghav &quot; had described them as 
Suryavanshi The records of mewar like Raj prahasti describes Śilāditya as the Suryavanshi of Solar race.

Dr.Randeep.singh concludes that Maitrakas were a Kshatriya of Solar race and their origin was probably from [{kosala kingdom (Ayodhya)|Solar dynasty]] which once ruled region around [{Ayodhya]] (now in Uttar Pradesh, India). Several scholars like Dr.Randeep Singh ,Dr khemraj Raghav and also mewar (udaipur )state accept that .

==Vallabhi==
The Maitrakas ruled from their capital at Vallabhi. They came under the rule of Harṣa in the mid-7th century, but retained local autonomy, and regained their independence after Harṣa&#x27;s death.

When I-Tsing, another Chinese traveller, visited Vallabhi in the last quarter of the seventh century, he found Vallabhi as a great center of learning including Buddhism. Gunamati and Sthiramati were two famous Buddhist scholars of Vallabhi in the middle of the seventh century. Vallabhi was famous for its liberalism and the students from all over the country, including the Brahmana boys, visited it to have higher education in secular and religious subjects. We are told that the graduates of Valabhi were given higher executive posts.

The Charanas of the region connect themselves with the last Maitraka ruler Śilāditya VI. Goddess Khodiyar is considered a contemporary figure of the period when the Vallabhi kingdom declined in the 8th century AD.

==Religion==
The Maitrakas were follower of the Shiva except Dhruvasena I who was Vaiṣnava and Dharapaṭṭa who was sun-worshiper. They all used title of &quot;parama-maheshwara&quot; before the names of king except those two. It is evident from the use of symbols like Nandi, the Bull and Trishula, the trident in their coins and inscriptions. There were presence of Vaishnavism and Goddess worship under their rule. There were large number of Buddhist Viharas in the Maitraka kingdom. Jains held their important Valabhi council here. The Maitrakas were tolerant to all religions and made donations and grants to all of them without partiality.
