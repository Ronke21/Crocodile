<text>The resplendent quetzal (Pharomachrus mocinno) is a small bird found in Central America and southern Mexico that lives in tropical forests, particularly montane cloud forests. They are part of the family Trogonidae and have two recognized subspecies, &quot;P. m. mocinno&quot; and &quot;P. m. costaricensis&quot;. Like other quetzals, the resplendent is mostly omnivorous; its diet mainly consists of fruits of plants in the laurel family, Lauraceae, but it occasionally also preys on insects, lizards, frogs and snails.

The species is well known for its colorful and complex plumage that differs substantially between sexes. Males have iridescent green plumes, a red lower breast and belly, black innerwings and a white undertail, whilst females are duller and have a shorter tail. Grey lower breasts, bellies, and bills, along with bronze-green heads are characteristic of females. These birds hollow holes in decaying trees or use ones already made by woodpeckers as a nest site. They are known to take turns while incubating, males throughout the day and females at night. The female usually lays one to three eggs, which hatch in 17 to 19 days. The quetzal is an altitudinal migrant, migrating from the slopes to the canopy of the forest. This occurs during the breeding season, which varies depending on the location, but usually commences in March and extends as far as August.

The resplendent quetzal is considered near threatened on the IUCN Red List, with habitat destruction being the main threat. It has an important role in Mesoamerican mythology, and is closely associated with Quetzalcoatl, a deity. It is the national animal of Guatemala, being pictured on the flag and coat of arms; it also gives its name to the country&#x27;s currency, the Guatemalan quetzal.

==Taxonomy==
The resplendent quetzal was first described by Mexican naturalist Pablo de La Llave in 1832. It is one of five species of the genus &quot;Pharomachrus&quot;, commonly known as quetzals. Quetzal is usually specifically used to refer to the resplendent, but it typically applies to all members of the genera &quot;Pharomachrus&quot; and &quot;Euptilotis&quot;. Some scholars label the crested quetzal as a very close relative of the resplendent, and either suggest the crested quetzal to be a subspecies of the resplendent or the two form a superspecies. The quetzal clade is thought to have spread out from where it emerged in the Andes, the resplendent quetzal being the youngest species. The name of the genus, &quot;Pharomachrus&quot;, refers to the physical characteristics of the bird, with &quot;pharos&quot; meaning &quot; and &quot;makros&quot; meaning &#x27;long&#x27; in Ancient Greek. The word &#x27;quetzal&#x27; came from Nahuatl (Aztec), where &quot;quetzalli&quot; (from the root &quot;quetza&quot;, meaning &#x27;stand&#x27;) means &#x27;tall upstanding plume&#x27; and then &#x27;quetzal tail feather&#x27;; from that, Nahuatl &quot;quetzaltotōtl&quot; means &#x27;quetzal-feather bird&#x27; and thus &#x27;quetzal&#x27;.

Two subspecies are recognized, &quot;P. m. mocinno&quot; and &quot;P. m. costaricensis&quot;, although there is an ongoing debate about whether &quot;costaricensis&quot; should be recognized as a distinct species. The specific epithet &quot;mocinno&quot; is a Latinization of the name of the biologist José Mariano M. Mociño, a mentor of his.

==Description==

The resplendent quetzal is the largest trogon. It is long; in the nominate subspecies, the tail streamers measure between and , with the median being for males. The nominate subspecies weighs about , while the subspecies &quot;costaricensis&quot; is slightly smaller than the nominate race, with shorter wings and bills. The tail plumes are shorter and narrower, measuring between and , with the median being .

Resplendent quetzals have a green body (showing iridescence from green-gold to blue-violet) and a red lower breast and belly. Depending on the light, quetzal feathers can shine in a variant of colors: from green, cobalt, lime, and yellow to ultramarine. Their green upper hide their tails and are particularly splendid in breeding males, being longer than the rest of the body. Though the quetzal&#x27;s plumage appears green, they are actually brown due to the pigment melanin. The primary wing coverts are also unusually long and have a fringed appearance. The male has a helmet-like crest. The bill, which is partly covered by green filamentous feathers, is yellow in mature males and grey in females. Their iridescent feathers, which cause them to appear shiny and green like the canopy leaves, are a camouflage adaptation to hide within the canopy during rainy weather. The quetzal&#x27;s skin is very thin and easily torn, so it has evolved thick plumage to protect its skin. It has large eyes, adapted to see in the dim light of the forest. Their song is an array of full-toned, mellow, slurred notes in plain patterns and is often remarkably melodious: &quot;keow&quot;, &quot;kowee&quot;, &quot;keow&quot;, &quot;k&#x27;loo&quot;, &quot;keeloo&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
This species inhabits amidst lush vegetation, in specially moist rainforests at high elevations (). They populate trees that make up the canopy and subcanopy of the rainforest, though they can also be found in ravines and cliffs. It prefers to live in decaying trees, stumps, and abandoned woodpecker hollows. The vivid colors of the quetzal are disguised by the rainforest. The resplendent quetzal can be found from southern Mexico (southernmost Oaxaca and Chiapas) to western Panama (Chiriquí). The ranges of the two subspecies differ: &quot;P. m. mocinno&quot; is found in southern Mexico, northern El Salvador, and northwestern Nicaragua, Guatemala and Honduras, while &quot;P. m. costaricensis&quot; is found in Costa Rica and western Panama. The geographical isolation between the two subspecies is caused by the Nicaraguan depression, a wide, long bottomland that contains the two largest lakes in Central America, Lake Managua and Lake Nicaragua, and the deficiency of the breeding habitats in regions adjoining to. The quetzal migrates from its breeding areas in the lower montane rainforest to the pre-montane rainforest on the Pacific slopes for three to four months (July–October), after which they move across the continental divide to the Atlantic slopes.

Quetzal&#x27;s abundance in its mating areas is correlated with the total number of fruiting species, although the correlation between quetzal abundance and the number of fruiting Lauraceae species is only marginal.

==Behavior==
Resplendent quetzals generally display shy and quiet behaviour to elude predators. In contrast, they are rather vocal during the mating season and their behavior is designated to exhibit and attract mates. Their known predators include the ornate hawk-eagle, golden eagle, and other hawks and owls as adults, along with emerald toucanets, brown jays, long-tailed weasels, squirrels, and kinkajous as nestlings or eggs. The resplendent quetzal plays an important ecological role in the cloud forests, helping disseminate the seeds of at least 32 tree species.

===Feeding===
Resplendent quetzals are considered specialized fruit-eaters, feeding on 41 to 43 species, although they also feed on insects (primarily wasps, ants, and larvae), frogs, lizards, and snails. Particularly important are the &quot;Symplococarpon purpusii&quot; and wild avocados, as well as other fruits of the laurel family, which the birds swallow whole before regurgitating the pits, which helps to disperse these trees. Quetzals feed more frequently in the midday hours. The adults eat a more fruit-based diet than the chicks, who eat insects primarily and some fruits. Over fifty percent of the fruit they eat are laurels. Quetzals use the methods of &quot;hovering&quot; and &quot;stalling&quot; in order to selectively pick the fruit from near the tips of the branches.

===Breeding===
Resplendent quetzals create their nests over up in the air and court in the air with specific calls. Six specific vocal calls have been recorded: the two-note whistle, &quot;gee-gee&quot;, &quot;wahc-ah-wahc&quot;, &quot;wec-wec&quot;, whistle, &quot;coouee&quot;, &quot;uwac&quot;, chatter, and buzzing. The first call is related to male territorial behavior, while the &quot;coouee&quot; whistle is a mating call. Resplendent quetzals usually live alone when not breeding. They are monogamous territorial breeders, with the size of their territory in Guatemala being . They are also seasonal breeders, with the breeding season lasting from March to April in Mexico, May to June in El Salvador, and March to May in Guatemala. When breeding, females lay one to three pale blue eggs with a mean of x in a nest placed in a hole which they carve in a rotten tree. Resplendent quetzals tend to lay two clutches per year and are known to have a high rate of nest failure, 67-78%. One of the most important factors when choosing a nest location for the quetzal is that the tree must be in a stage of decomposition and decay. They often reuse their previous sites. The height of nest stubs is and the nest holes .

Both parents take turns at incubating, with their long tail coverts folded forwards over out of the hole, giving them the appearance of a bunch of fern growing out of the hole. The incubation period lasts about 17 to 19 days, during which the male generally incubates the eggs during the day while the female incubates them at night. When the eggs hatch, both parents take care of the young, feeding them entire fruits, such as berries and avocados, as early as the second day. However, chicks are primarily fed insects, lizards, snails and small frogs. It was observed that males generally give more food, namely insects, than females. Nestlings are often neglected and even abandoned by females near the end of the rearing period, leaving it up to the male to continue caring for the offspring until they are ready to survive on their own. During the incubation period, parents land and rotate their heads side to side before entering the nest, a process known as &quot;bowing in&quot;. This process ends when the chicks hatch. Young quetzals begin flying after a month, but the distinctive long tail feathers can take three years to develop in males.

==Conservation status==

The population trend varies between subpopulations but is generally decreasing although certain populations may be increasing or are at least stable. It is classified as being near threatened on the IUCN Red List, with an estimated population of 20,000–49,999 individuals. Due to the remote habitat of the quetzal, more monitoring is required to confirm the rate of decline, and depending on the results it could lead to it moving to a higher threat category. In 2001, the quetzal survived only in 11 small, isolated patches of forest. Its biggest threats are habitat loss because of deforestation, forest fragmentation, and agricultural clearing. The quetzal is also sometimes hunted for food and trapped for illegal trading. Cloud forests, the resplendent quetzal&#x27;s habitat, are one of the most threatened ecosystems in the world, but the species occurs in several protected areas and is a sought-after species for birdwatchers and ecotourists.

It was thought that the resplendent quetzal could not be bred or held for a long time in captivity, and was noted for usually dying soon after being captured or caged as a result of assimilation of iron through water ingestion, with this now understood they are now given tannic acid and iron is avoided in their diet. For this reason, it is a traditional symbol of liberty. The national anthem of Guatemala even includes the verse &quot;&quot; (Be rather dead than a slave). However, the scientific discovery about the bird&#x27;s susceptibility to iron has allowed some zoos, including Miguel Álvarez del Toro Zoo in Tuxtla Gutiérrez, Chiapas, to keep this species. Breeding in captivity was announced in 2004.

==In culture==

The resplendent quetzal is of great importance to Guatemalan culture, being present in various legends and myths. It was considered divine and associated with Quetzalcoatl, a feathered serpent and god of life, light, knowledge and the winds, by pre-Columbian Mesoamerican civilizations. Its scintillating green tail feathers, symbolizes spring plant sprout, were venerated by the Aztec and Maya. The Maya also regarded the quetzal as representative of freedom and wealth on account of quetzals dying in captivity and the worth of their feathers along with jade, correspondingly. Mesoamerican rulers and some high ranked nobles wore diadems created from quetzal feathers, symbolically linking them to Quetzalcoatl. Since the killing of quetzals was forbidden under the Mayas and Aztec criminal law, the bird was merely seized, its prolonged tail feathers deplumed, and was set loose. In ancient Mayan culture, the quetzal feathers were considered so precious that they were even used as a medium of exchange. Thus the name of the Guatemala currency, the quetzal. In various Mesoamerican languages, the word &quot;quetzal&quot; can as well mean &quot;precious&quot;, &quot;sacred&quot;, or &quot;king&quot;, &quot;warrior&quot;, &quot;prince&quot;.

One Mayan legend has it that a resplendent quetzal accompanied the hero, Tecún Umán, prince of the Quiché (K&#x27;iche&#x27;) Maya, during his battle against Spanish conquistador Pedro de Alvarado. Tecún, equipped with just an arrow and bow, nevertheless is able to incapacitate Alvarado&#x27;s horse on the first strike. Alvarado was then given a second horse and counter-charged against Tecún, running his chest through with a spear. A quetzal flew down and alighted on Tecún&#x27;s body, drenching its chest in his blood. It was then that the species, which used to be completely green, obtained its characteristic red chest feathers. Additionally, from that day on, the quetzal, which sang delightfully before the Spanish conquest, has been mute ever since; it will sing anew solely when the land is fully liberated.

<text>Jacek Małachowski, of the Nałęcz coat-of-arms (1737–1821) was a Polish nobleman, politician and administrator as well as Polish chancellor.

He was Crown Deputy Master of the Pantry since 1764. Referendary of the Crown in 1764–1780, Deputy Chancellor the Crown since 1780 and Grand Chancellor of the Crown since 1786. Starost of Piotrków, Radom, Stary Sącz and Gródek.
Marshal of the Coronation Sejm in 3–20 December 1764 in Warsaw.

He was a supporter of the Russian faction. During the Great Sejm of 1788-1792 he supported tentative reforms such as strengthening of the executive and army, but also maintaining ties with Russia. He was among the opponents of the Constitution of 3 May and eventually joined the Targowica Confederation that overthrew it.

In 1804 he founded a manufactory that was one of the origins of the Ćmielów Porcelain Factory.

<doc id="1320275" wikidata="Q535146" url="?curid=1320275" title="Angelique (video game series)">
<text>is a Japanese otome game series and media franchise. There are various OVAs, Drama CDs, Music CDs and Anime series, developed along with the base game, or broadcast on TV channels, etc. The series began in 1994 and has continued since. The latest entry in the series is &quot;Angelique Luminarise&quot;, released in 2021.

The first game was released in 1994 on Super Famicom. This is the first otome game (dating sim for women) known in the world. The &quot;Angelique&quot; series is also the first otome game series of the &quot;Neo Romance&quot; series by Ruby Party. Currently, the games in this series are only published in Japanese.

==Plot==
The basic lore of the series is built around a Queen who fairly and wisely rules a Universe. By balancing elemental forces with the help of nine Guardians, she keeps the various planets in her domain stable and her people content. However, the powers of the Queen and the Guardians fade over time, and successors must be appointed. In the first game &quot;Angelique&quot;, the protagonist is a 17-year-old girl named Angelique Limoges who has been chosen by the current Queen and her aide Dia as one of two candidates from the Royal Smallney Girls&#x27; Academy to become the next Queen. She is transported to the Flying City to begin her final examination.

Each of the candidates is given a land to populate. Whoever finishes populating their land first wins and becomes the next Queen. It is done with the help of nine Guardians who use their powers to make the people of the candidate&#x27;s land happy, or to devastate their rival&#x27;s lands. Along the way, the candidates become friends with the Guardians and can fall in love. If they choose love, they forfeit their chance to become Queen, but will live happily ever after.

The story expands in later titles, but most entries in the series feature a girl named Angelique or a variant thereof (Enju or Ange) as the protagonist, with ever larger casts of characters. The roster of potential love interests swells to 19 characters in later titles (in &quot;Angelique Trois&quot; and &quot;Angelique Etoile&quot;).

==Gameplay==
Through the &quot;Angelique&quot; series games, the story begins with some crisis of the Universe, or some troubles in the Universe. To resolve a crisis or troubles, one girl is selected to become a savior of these crisis or troubles.

The player takes on the role of this girl. In the first game, &quot;Angelique&quot;, the player becomes a candidate for the new queen who will be the savior of the universal crisis. The player is asked to complete her mission or task during the course of the game. If the player completes her mission in the scheduled period, before her rival candidate completes the mission, the player will win and become the new queen.

But while trying to complete the given mission or task, the player necessarily needs some help from the nine guardians, who know and control the spiritual powers of the universe. The player needs to win their favor. If they do not favor a player, they will not provide assistance to that player. To win favor from the guardians, the player should properly work in her mission. Thus, the guardians may favor her.

And when the player wins favor of the guardians and the male characters, she will be able to better perform her task, and at the same time, she is capable of establishing romantic relations with some of the male characters. At this point, there are two options for her. Working best in her mission with the help of the guardians, she can defeat her rival, and become the new queen. The other option is for her to fall in love with one of her favourite male characters. If her love is fulfilled, her rival will become the new queen instead, but she may win the love.

These are two main types of endings to this game.
# Queen ending
# Love ending

In the other games of this series, there is no rival, and the player should perform her mission alone. While trying to complete her mission or task, the same situations take place. To perform her task, the player needs the help of the guardians and other male characters, and she should win their favor. In this case, there are typically two endings, as in the first game:
# Mission complete ending
# Love fulfilled ending
# Other ending

There are many candidates for romance. Typically, the nine guardians are all possible targets of the player&#x27;s love. There are at least ten main endings, but there are other endings as well, where the mission and/or the romance may be broken. The number of endings ranges between 10 and 30.

The most interesting and difficult points of this game series are that there are many combinations of how to win favor from the guardians and how to complete the task. Sometimes the former and the latter are contradictory, yet the player needs them both to achieve good endings.

<doc id="1320279" wikidata="Q4791252" url="?curid=1320279" title="Arizona Bay">
<text>Arizona Bay is an album by American stand-up comedian and satirist Bill Hicks, posthumously released in 1997. Both this album and a similar album of new material, &quot;Rant in E-Minor&quot;, were released posthumously by Rykodisc on February 25, 1997, marking three years since Hicks&#x27; death.

The album&#x27;s title refers to the hope that Los Angeles will one day fall into the ocean due to a major earthquake. Hicks contends that the world will be better off in L.A.&#x27;s absence:

On April 28, 2015, Comedy Dynamics released a new version of the album in the digital format called &quot;Arizona Bay Extended&quot;, featuring &quot;a raw and uncut show that comprised the original &quot;Arizona Bay&quot; album.&quot;

==Musical content==
Several of Hicks&#x27;s albums are unique in that they feature background music, meant to enhance the album&#x27;s mood. Such additions were made well after the initial recordings and are the product of Hicks&#x27;s own musicianship.

According to Kevin Booth, in the BBC documentary &quot;Dark Poet&quot;, it was during the early recording sessions for &quot;Arizona Bay&quot;, around Christmas 1992, that Hicks first started suffering from the pains in his side, which would later be diagnosed as pancreatic cancer. Upon learning that he had developed cancer, Hicks used his time to mix music into &quot;Rant in E-Minor&quot; and &quot;Arizona Bay&quot;, calling it his &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;.

== Legacy ==
In 1996, one year prior to the release of Hicks&#x27; &quot;Arizona Bay&quot; album, American rock band Tool released the album &quot;Ænima&quot;, which contains several references to Hicks. The title song of the album echoes the theme of Los Angeles being submerged in the ocean and includes the lyrics, &quot;Learn to swim, see you down in Arizona Bay.&quot; Additionally, there is artwork inside the album booklet showing a map of California before and after the earthquake, as well as a caricature of Hicks himself, cited as &quot;another dead hero&quot;.

The song &quot;Third Eye&quot; also contains references to several Hicks routines:

:Who&#x27;s that talking at the start of &quot;Third Eye&quot;? - That would be the aforementioned Bill Hicks; those are snips of comedy routines of his, from &quot;The War on Drugs&quot; (off his CD &quot;Dangerous&quot;) and &quot;Drugs Have Done Good Things&quot; (off &quot;Relentless&quot;). In fact, on his CD &quot;Rant in E-Minor&quot;, he refers to the power that heavy doses of hallucinogens have to &quot;squeegee his third eye.&quot;

<doc id="1320289" wikidata="Q556466" url="?curid=1320289" title="Steam reforming">
<text>Steam reforming or steam methane reforming (SMR) is a method for producing syngas (hydrogen and carbon monoxide) by reaction of hydrocarbons with water. Commonly, natural gas is the feedstock. The main purpose of this technology is often hydrogen production, although syngas has multiple other uses such as production of ammonia or methanol. The reaction is represented by this equilibrium:

:&lt;chem&gt;CH4 + H2O &lt;=&gt; CO + 3 H2&lt;/chem&gt;

The reaction is strongly endothermic (Δ&quot;H&quot;SR = 206 kJ/mol).

Hydrogen produced by steam reforming is termed as &#x27;grey&#x27; hydrogen when the waste carbon dioxide is released to the atmosphere and &#x27;blue&#x27; hydrogen when the carbon dioxide is (mostly) captured and stored geologically—see carbon capture and storage. Zero carbon &#x27;green&#x27; hydrogen is produced by thermochemical water splitting, using solar thermal, low- or zero-carbon electricity or waste heat, or electrolysis, using low- or zero-carbon electricity. Zero carbon emissions &#x27;turquoise&#x27; hydrogen is produced by one-step methane pyrolysis of natural gas.

Steam reforming of the natural gas produces most of the world&#x27;s hydrogen. Hydrogen is used in the industrial synthesis of ammonia and other chemicals.

== Reactions ==
Steam reforming reaction kinetics, in particular using nickel-alumina catalysts, have been studied in detail since the 1950s.

=== Pre-reforming ===

The purpose of pre-reforming is to break down higher hydrocarbons such as propane, butane or naphtha into methane (CH4), which allows for more efficient reforming downstream.

=== Steam reforming ===
The name-giving reaction is the steam reforming (SR) reaction and is expressed by the equation:

formula_1

Via the water-gas shift reaction (WGSR), additional hydrogen is released by reaction of water with the carbon monoxide generated according to equation [1]:

formula_2

Some additional reactions occurring within steam reforming processes have been studied. Commonly the direct steam reforming (DSR) reaction is also included:

formula_3

As these reactions by themselves are highly endothermic (apart from WGSR, which is mildly exothermic), a large amount of heat needs to be added to the reactor to keep a constant temperature. Optimal SMR reactor operating conditions lie within a temperature range of 800 °C to 900 °C at medium pressures of 20-30 bar. High excess of steam is required, expressed by the (molar) steam-to-carbon (S/C) ratio. Typical S/C ratio values lie within the range 2.5:1 - 3:1.

== Industrial practice==

The reaction is conducted in multitubular packed bed reactors, a subtype of the plug flow reactor category. These reactors consist of an array of long and narrow tubes which are situated within the combustion chamber of a large industrial furnace, providing the necessary energy to keep the reactor at a constant temperature during operation. Furnace designs vary, depending on the burner configuration they are typically categorized into: top-fired, bottom-fired, and side-fired. A notable design is the Foster-Wheeler terrace wall reformer.

Inside the tubes, a mixture of steam and methane are put into contact with a nickel catalyst. Catalysts with high surface-area-to-volume ratio are preferred because of diffusion limitations due to high operating temperature. Examples of catalyst shapes used are spoked wheels, gear wheels, and rings with holes (&quot;see:&quot; &quot;Raschig rings&quot;). Additionally, these shapes have a low pressure drop which is advantageous for this application.

Steam reforming of natural gas is 65–75% efficient.

The United States produces 9–10 million tons of hydrogen per year, mostly with steam reforming of natural gas. The worldwide ammonia production, using hydrogen derived from steam reforming, was 144 million tonnes in 2018. The energy consumption has been reduced from 100 GJ/tonne of ammonia in 1920 to 27 GJ by 2019.

Globally, almost 50% of hydrogen is produced via steam reforming. It is currently the least expensive method for hydrogen production available in terms of its capital cost.

In an effort to decarbonise hydrogen production, carbon capture and storage (CCS) methods are being implemented within the industry, which have the potential to remove up to 90% of CO2 produced from the process. Despite this, implementation of this technology remains problematic, costly, and increases the price of the produced hydrogen significantly.

== Autothermal reforming ==
Autothermal reforming (ATR) uses oxygen and carbon dioxide or steam in a reaction with methane to form syngas. The reaction takes place in a single chamber where the methane is partially oxidized. The reaction is exothermic. When the ATR uses carbon dioxide, the H2:CO ratio produced is 1:1; when the ATR uses steam, the H2:CO ratio produced is 2.5:1. The outlet temperature of the syngas is between 950–1100 °C and outlet pressure can be as high as 100 bar.

In addition to reactions [1] – [3], ATR introduces the following reaction:

formula_4

The main difference between SMR and ATR is that SMR only uses air for combustion as a heat source to create steam, while ATR uses purified oxygen. The advantage of ATR is that the H2:CO ratio can be varied, which can be useful for producing specialty products. Due to the exothermic nature of some of the additional reactions occurring within ATR, the process can essentially be performed at a net enthalpy of zero (Δ&quot;H&quot; = 0).

== Partial oxidation ==

Partial oxidation (POX) occurs when a sub-stoichiometric fuel-air mixture is partially combusted in a reformer creating hydrogen-rich syngas. POX is typically much faster than steam reforming and requires a smaller reactor vessel. POX produces less hydrogen per unit of the input fuel than steam reforming of the same fuel.

==Steam reforming at small scale==
The capital cost of steam reforming plants is considered prohibitive for small to medium size applications. The costs for these elaborate facilities do not scale down well. Conventional steam reforming plants operate at pressures between 200 and 600 psi (14–40 bar) with outlet temperatures in the range of 815 to 925 °C.

===For combustion engines ===
Flared gas and vented volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are known problems in the offshore industry and in the on-shore oil and gas industry, since both release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Reforming for combustion engines utilizes steam reforming technology for converting waste gases into a source of energy.

Reforming for combustion engines is based on steam reforming, where non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) of low quality gases are converted to synthesis gas (H2 + CO) and finally to methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen (H2) - thereby improving the fuel gas quality (methane number).

===For fuel cells===
There is also interest in the development of much smaller units based on similar technology to produce hydrogen as a feedstock for fuel cells. Small-scale steam reforming units to supply fuel cells are currently the subject of research and development, typically involving the reforming of methanol, but other fuels are also being considered such as propane, gasoline, autogas, diesel fuel, and ethanol.

====Disadvantages====
The reformer– the fuel-cell system is still being researched but in the near term, systems would continue to run on existing fuels, such as natural gas or gasoline or diesel. However, there is an active debate about whether using these fuels to make hydrogen is beneficial while global warming is an issue. Fossil fuel reforming does not eliminate carbon dioxide release into the atmosphere but reduces the carbon dioxide emissions and nearly eliminates carbon monoxide emissions as compared to the burning of conventional fuels due to increased efficiency and fuel cell characteristics. However, by turning the release of carbon dioxide into a point source rather than distributed release, carbon capture and storage becomes a possibility, which would prevent the release of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, while adding to the cost of the process.

The cost of hydrogen production by reforming fossil fuels depends on the scale at which it is done, the capital cost of the reformer, and the efficiency of the unit, so that whilst it may cost only a few dollars per kilogram of hydrogen at an industrial scale, it could be more expensive at the smaller scale needed for fuel cells.

====Challenges with reformers supplying fuel cells====
There are several challenges associated with this technology:
* The reforming reaction takes place at high temperatures, making it slow to start up and requiring costly high-temperature materials.
* Sulfur compounds in the fuel will poison certain catalysts, making it difficult to run this type of system from ordinary gasoline. Some new technologies have overcome this challenge with sulfur-tolerant catalysts.
* Coking would be another cause of catalyst deactivation during steam reforming. High reaction temperatures, low steam-to-carbon ratio (S/C), and the complex nature of sulfur-containing commercial hydrocarbon fuels make coking especially favorable. Olefins, typically ethylene, and aromatics are well-known carbon-precursors, hence their formation must be reduced during steam reforming. Additionally, catalysts with lower acidity were reported to be less prone to coking by suppressing dehydrogenation reactions. H2S, the main product in the reforming of organic sulfur, can bind to all transition metal catalysts to form metal–sulfur bonds and subsequently reduce catalyst activity by inhibiting the chemisorption of reforming reactants. Meanwhile, the adsorbed sulfur species increases the catalyst acidity, and hence indirectly promotes coking. Precious metal catalysts such as Rh and Pt have lower tendencies to form bulk sulfides than other metal catalysts such as Ni. Rh and Pt are less prone to sulfur poisoning by only chemisorbing sulfur rather than forming metal sulfides.
* Low temperature polymer fuel cell membranes can be poisoned by the carbon monoxide (CO) produced by the reactor, making it necessary to include complex CO-removal systems. Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) and molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC) do not have this problem, but operate at higher temperatures, slowing start-up time, and requiring costly materials and bulky insulation.
* The thermodynamic efficiency of the process is between 70% and 85% (LHV basis) depending on the purity of the hydrogen product.

<text>Smyslovye Gallyutsinatsii () is a Russian rock band which has won the &quot;Golden Gramophone&quot; award twice.

The name of the band may be translated as &quot;meaningful hallucinations&quot; or &quot;semantic hallucinations.&quot; This is not a medical term; it was produced as a slip of the tongue and stuck. The band is also known under a much shorter name &quot;Glyuki&quot; (), a slang term, which means basically the same: glitches in your brain.

==Biography==
The band was formed in Sverdlovsk in 1989. In 1990, they became part of the Sverdlovsk rock club, and they were the last group accepted to it before the club was closed down.

For a decade the group had many problems, split a few times, and had problems getting a contract.

Their breakthrough came in 2000 when two of their songs, &quot;Rozovye Ochki&quot; (&quot;Rose Colored Glasses&quot;) and &quot;Vechno Molodoy&quot; (&quot;Forever Young&quot;) were featured on the soundtrack of the &quot;Brother 2&quot; movie. During this year the band also released their debut album, &quot;3000&quot;.

In 2001, the band released their second album, &quot;Lyod 9&quot; (&quot;Ice 9&quot;). Two songs from the album, &quot;Zachem Toptat&#x27; Moyu Liubov&quot; (&quot;Why Tread Upon My Love&quot;) and &quot;Razum Kogda-Nibud&#x27; Pobedit&quot; (&quot;Reason Will Triumph Someday&quot;) received the most prestigious Russian musical award, the &quot;Golden Gramophone&quot;.

<text>MPI Media Group is an American producer, distributor and licensor of theatrical film and home entertainment. MPI&#x27;s subsidiaries include MPI Pictures, MPI Home Video, Gorgon Video, and the horror film distributor Dark Sky Films. The company is located in Orland Park, Illinois, and was founded in 1976 by brothers Malik &amp; Waleed Ali.

MPI also owns the stock footage archive WPA Film Library, which offers one of the industry&#x27;s largest collections of music performances, newsreels, political coverage and pop culture footage and the British Pathe Newsreel Archive. The company was originally started in 1976 as Maljack Productions, Inc.

The company branched out into video distribution in 1983. One of the first titles, The Beatles&#x27; movie &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, which honored the movie&#x27;s 20th anniversary was an instant best seller on the Billboard Videocassette Top 40. Maljack had branched out into the vintage TV show genre with &quot;The Prisoner&quot; serving as one of the first titles to come out of the MPI Home Video label. They eventually became a leader in the vintage television show industry, along with Paramount Home Video.

In 1984, Maljack introduced the Gorgon Video line. In 1985, Maljack released a series of videocassettes featuring the lost episodes of the vintage Jackie Gleason TV show &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;. Maljack also released shows via licensing agreements with such distributors like ITC Entertainment, as well as &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;. In 1986, Maljack Productions, Inc. (MPI) released the David Selznick-produced Ronald Reagan documentary &quot;Reagan&#x27;s Way&quot;, which was originally commissioned for French TV.

Also, in 1986, Doc Projects Inc. had signed a deal with Maljack Productions in order to release its first documentary, &quot;Great Crimes of the Century&quot;. In 1987, Maljack Productions, Inc. was officially shortened to MPI. In 1987, Frank Zappa&#x27;s Honker Home Video had signed a distribution deal with MPI in order to release their titles on videocassette.

<text>Count Stanisław Małachowski, of the Nałęcz coat-of-arms (; 1736–1809) was a Polish statesman, the first Prime Minister of Poland, a member of the Polish government&#x27;s Permanent Council (Rada Nieustająca) (1776–1780), Marshal of the Crown Courts of Justice from 1774, Crown Grand Referendary (1780–1792) and Marshal of the Four-Year Sejm (1788–1792).

The son of Jan Małachowski, the royal grand chancellor, Małachowski was named marshal (speaker) of the Sejm (Diet) in 1788. He was the prime force behind a constitution, adopted in 1791, that embodied such modern western European reforms as majority rule in parliament, separation of powers, and enfranchisement of the middle classes; this constitution was abrogated at the Second Partition of Poland in 1792. In 1807–09 Małachowski served as president of the senate (government) of the Duchy of Warsaw, promoted by Napoleon Bonaparte.

==Biography==

Born on 24 August 1736, Stanisław Małachowski came from a wealthy, powerful and influential noble family and was the son of statesman and nobleman Jan Małachowski. He studied law and was elected provincial deputy to the Sejm in 1764 . In 1771 he was appointed clerk of the United Polish crown. As a member of the House of Deputies in the Sejm, he earned great respect. He belonged to a member of the Permanent Council of the Government and was appointed Marshal (President) of the Four-year Sejm (1788-1792). In this capacity he was one of the main authors of the Constitution of 3 May 1791. He signed, as Marshal of the Sejm in 1790, the treaty of alliance with Prussia with the aim to protect Poland from foreign domination.

In 1792 he negotiated in vain with a Saxon delegation on the introduction of the hereditary transmission of the Polish crown to the King of Saxony. Małachowski was stricter than patriot opponents of the Russian party, whose main proponents scored his brother Hyacinth Małachowski. During the Russo-Polish war of 1792, he provided substantial funds and large quantities of food for the Polish troops available from his own resources. But since he could not prevent the pro-Russian Targowica Confederation, he fled abroad. He did not take part in the Kościuszko Uprising of 1794. In 1799, he was nevertheless arrested in Warsaw and imprisoned for a year in Kraków as a state prisoner, being accused of responsibility for a meeting of the Polish Sejm in Milan. After the founding of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw in 1807, he was first chairman of a provisional government commission and soon became President of the Senate.

Małachowski died on 28 December 1809 and his tomb is located in the Holy Cross Church in Warsaw.

==Legacy==
From his youth Małachowski laboured zealously for the good of his country, and as president of the royal court of justice won the honourable title of the &quot;Polish Aristides&quot;. He was first elected a deputy to the Coronation Diet of 1764, and the great Four-Years Sejm unanimously elected him its speaker at the beginning of its session in 1788. Accurately gauging the situation, Małachowski speedily gathered round him all those who were striving to uphold the falling Commonwealth and warmly supported every promising project of reform. He was one of the framers of the constitution of 3 May 1791, exceeding in liberality all his colleagues and advocating the extension of the franchise to the towns and the emancipation of the serfs. He was the first to enter his name as a citizen of Warsaw in the civic register and to open negotiations with his own peasantry for their complete liberation. Disappointed in his hopes by the overthrow of the constitution, he resigned office and left the country in 1792, going first to Italy and subsequently to his estates in Galicia, where he was imprisoned for a time on a false suspicion of conspiracy.

In 1807, Małachowski was placed at the head of the executive committee appointed at Warsaw after its evacuation by the Prussians, and when the grand duchy of Warsaw was created Małachowski became president of the senate under King Frederick Augustus I of Saxony. In the negotiations with the Austrian government concerning the Galician salt-mines, Małachowski came to the assistance of the depleted treasury by hypothesising all his estates as an additional guarantee. His death was regarded as a public calamity. In all the other towns of the grand duchy funeral services were held simultaneously as a tribute of the respect and gratitude of the Polish nation.

==Remembrance==
He is one of the figures immortalized in Jan Matejko&#x27;s 1891 painting, &quot;Constitution of 3 May 1791.&quot; A monument in his honor has been proposed in the Polish city of Płock on the grounds of the school which bears his name.

<doc id="1320336" wikidata="Q383629" url="?curid=1320336" title="Parallax mapping">
<text>Parallax mapping (also called offset mapping or virtual displacement mapping) is an enhancement of the bump mapping or normal mapping techniques applied to textures in 3D rendering applications such as video games. To the end user, this means that textures such as stone walls will have more apparent depth and thus greater realism with less of an influence on the performance of the simulation. Parallax mapping was introduced by Tomomichi Kaneko et al., in 2001.

Parallax mapping is essentially a method by which rough or uneven surfaces on a 2D texture can be &quot;pulled out&quot; to take on the appearance of a 3D surface. Technically, this is implemented by displacing the texture coordinates at a point on the rendered polygon by a function of the view angle in tangent space (the angle relative to the surface normal) and the value of the height map at that point. At steeper view-angles, the texture coordinates are displaced more, giving the illusion of depth due to parallax effects as the view changes. This effect is commonly used for rendering windows in order to fake 3D interiors for example.

Parallax mapping, as described by Kaneko et al., is a single step process that does not account for occlusion. Subsequent enhancements have been made to the algorithm incorporating iterative approaches to allow for occlusion and accurate silhouette rendering.

==Steep parallax mapping==
Steep parallax mapping is one name for the class of algorithms that trace rays against heightfields. The idea is to walk along a ray that has entered the heightfield&#x27;s volume, finding the intersection point of the ray with the heightfield. This closest intersection is what part of the heightfield is truly visible. Relief mapping and parallax occlusion mapping are other common names for these techniques.

Interval mapping improves on the usual binary search done in relief mapping by creating a line between known inside and outside points and choosing the next sample point by intersecting this line with a ray, rather than using the midpoint as in a traditional binary search.

<doc id="1320350" wikidata="Q294685" url="?curid=1320350" title="AMC Eagle">
<text>The AMC Eagle is a compact four-wheel drive passenger vehicle manufactured and marketed in a single generation by American Motors Corporation (AMC) for model years 1980 through 1987 and continued by Chrysler Corporation following its acquisition of AMC in 1987, for the 1988 model year.

Introduced in August 1979 for the 1980 model year, the coupe, sedan, and station wagon body styles were based on the AMC Concord. In 1981, the two-door subcompact-sized AMC Spirit-based models, the SX/4 and Kammback, joined the Eagle line aimed at both first-time buyers and fleet sales.

A Sundancer convertible conversion for the larger Eagle two-door model was available during 1981 and 1982. By 1984, only sedan and station wagon versions were available. For 1988, its final model year, only a station wagon was offered, marketed as the &quot;Eagle Wagon&quot;. However, the name continued to be used by Chrysler Corporation as the Eagle brand of cars through 1998.

The AMC Eagles were the only four-wheel drive passenger cars produced in the United States at the time. All models featured &quot;passenger-car comfort, plus 4WD security for all-weather security.&quot; Marketing materials of the time refer to the Eagle as a &quot;vehicle,&quot; &quot;automobile,&quot; &quot;car,&quot; or “sport machine.” Although the description was not in use at the time, the AMC Eagle is widely recognized as the first crossover vehicle.

==History==

===The concept===



Fuel-thirsty vehicles built for rugged off-road were on the market, but AMC &quot;predicted that consumers would embrace a vehicle with the comfort of an automobile, but the ride height and foul-weather capabilities of a four-wheel drive utility vehicle.&quot; The objective was an affordable car with comfortable ride and handling on the road and superior traction in &quot;light&quot; off-road use.

The initial proposal for production of what would become the AMC Eagle came from Roy Lunn, the chief design engineer for AMC Jeep. &quot;Project 8001 plus Four&quot; was Lunn&#x27;s code name for a new &quot;line of four-wheel drive vehicles with the ride and handling conventions of a standard rear-wheel drive car&quot; built on a unibody platform. In February 1977, AMC contracted FF Developments to build a prototype vehicle based on a production V8-powered AMC Hornet with drive torque split 33% front and 66% rear. Testing and further development proved the feasibility of a vehicle with greater ground clearance, larger 15-inch wheels, and a torque split closer to 50% – 50%, with Lunn recommending using the AMC straight-six engine coupled to an automatic transmission.

Thus, the AMC Eagle came about when Jeep&#x27;s chief engineer joined a Concord body with a four-wheel drive system. Such a vehicle was a logical step for AMC, according to the CEO Gerald C. Meyers. A second energy crisis had hit in 1979. Sales of AMC&#x27;s highly profitable truck-based Jeep line dropped due in part to their low fuel efficiency. This forced AMC into a precarious financial position. The Eagle provided a low-cost way of bridging the gap between AMC&#x27;s solid and economical, but aging, passenger-car line and its well-regarded, but decidedly off-road focused, Jeep line, as the Eagle used the existing Concord (and later, Spirit) automobile platform.

The Eagle also bridged the sizable price gap between the low-end imported four-wheel drive (4WD) Subaru and the large-sized domestic 4WD vehicles such as the Jeep Wagoneer. The Eagle models provided the most significant new boost to the automaker&#x27;s profit mix. Sales were brisk since Day One, with the manufacturer&#x27;s suggested retail price (MSRP) for the basic two-door model starting at $6,999 (US$ in dollars) and the 4-door station wagon at $7,549 (US$ in dollars). The Eagle represented a &quot;burst of AMC&#x27;s genetic creativity...quickly captured the attention of many American drivers who found its unique union of four-wheel drive safety and security with the comfort of an automobile.&quot;

The early AMC Eagles had a full-time automatic system that operated in permanent all-wheel drive (AWD). The drivetrain added about to the Eagle&#x27;s curb weight. The AMC Eagles were also the first mass-produced U.S. 4WD automobiles with an independent front suspension. The 1963 Jeep Wagoneer and Gladiator pickups featured an independent front suspension with 4WD as well as the revised for 1980 truck-based Ford Bronco and F-Series vehicles.

The AMC Eagle&#x27;s central differential behind its TorqueFlite automatic transmission was a single-speed (without a low-range option). It featured a viscous fluid coupling for the quiet and smooth power transfer to the axle with the most traction on wet or dry pavement. The central unit consisted of closely spaced, wavy clutch plates operating in a &quot;honey-like silicone fluid&quot; performing a &quot;limited-slip function&quot; between the front and rear drives, as well as under adverse driving conditions sending torque to the axle with the most traction.

Designed as &quot;reasonably size[d] passenger cars&quot; offering a comfortable ride and handling on pavement, the AMC Eagles &quot;behave more like mountain goats&quot; when off the road. The value of 4WD in the AMC Eagle was apparent when driving in slippery conditions. They served in America&#x27;s first ice-driving school. The Eagle models provided the comfort and appointments expected of passenger models, combined with off-road technology offering an extra margin of safety and traction. The Eagle was designed for customers who &quot;must get through regardless of road or weather conditions (doctors, police, emergency personnel, and so on)&quot; as well as those living areas of bad weather or roads, and adventurous hunters and fishermen. The AMC Eagle did not compete with traditional, rudimentary 4WD vehicles. The company did not design the Eagle as an off-pavement recreation vehicle, but rather as a passenger car that offers added benefits. Not built for off-road performance as a Chevrolet Blazer or a Jeep Cherokee, the Eagle &quot;will overcome mud, sand, snow, and obstacles that would stop ordinary sedans cold.&quot;

The AMC Eagle was one of the first production cars to use an AWD system. Other 4WD automobile-type vehicles – the Subaru DL/GL (1972 for the Japanese domestic market and two years later in the U.S.), and much later the Toyota Tercel SR5 Wagon (1983) - only had part-time 4WD systems that could not be engaged on dry pavement. The Eagle was also years ahead of Subaru&#x27;s simplistic, part-time front-drive/4WD system, due to Roy Lunn&#x27;s creativity and Jeep&#x27;s experience producing 4WD vehicles. Another feature was the Eagle&#x27;s independent front suspension, accomplished by mounting the front differential to the engine block with universal joints and half shafts to drive the front wheels.

As the first mass-produced American passenger car with 4WD of any type, automotive industry analysts were taken by surprise at the fact that AMC, a company most had deemed past its ability to produce competitive vehicles, turned the best of what they had into a revolutionary, novel, and all-around competent vehicle. In doing so, the small American manufacturer was seen as having cleverly pioneered a new market segment – one that would grow wildly over the next 25 years and beyond, as evinced by &quot;Four Wheeler&quot; magazine&#x27;s conclusion in 1980 that the new AMC Eagle was, indeed, &quot;The beginning of a new generation of cars.&quot; Even as the automaker was struggling financially, &quot;AMC&#x27;s reputation for developing vehicles on the cheap is only exceeded by its legacy of midwifing the SUV&quot;, including the Eagle to be the precursor to one of the most popular vehicle types on the market. Indeed, the Eagle&#x27;s basic concept - that of a station wagon with AWD, raised ground clearance, full range of power options, and automatic transmissions, as well as the rough-road capability - has inspired vehicles such as the Subaru Outback and Forester lines, the Audi Allroad, the Volkswagen Passat Alltrack, the Volvo XC range, and many others. Similarly, motoring journalist Marty Padgett described AMC&#x27;s car-based 1980 Eagle, combining all-weather capability with better gas mileage, as &quot;the first crossover,&quot; that was succeeded by whole generations of Subaru vehicles and other models.

A long-term road test conducted in 2009 of a new Suzuki crossover vehicle described the original AMC Eagle as &quot;combined two disparate personalities – rugged, childlike playfulness and staunch paternal responsibility – in a way that few thought possible in 1980. And for all the Eagle&#x27;s lowly heritage, it has set a lasting standard for utility and a friendly, innovative spirit that has eluded most of the compact crossovers on the market today.&quot; An article in a series about innovations and icons, the BBC wrote, &quot;the Eagle was, in essence, the kind of segment-busting product that engineers and marketers spend entire careers trying to create.&quot;

===Model years===

====1980====

Based on the AMC Concord, the 1980 AMC Eagle was introduced in August 1979 and available as a four-door sedan and station wagon, as well as a coupe. Standard equipment included power steering and power front disc and rear drum brakes, as well as 15-inch road wheels with fiberglass-belted radial whitewall tires. The Eagle came base and upscale Limited trims, both of which carried the same features as the Concord DL and Limited, respectively. A sports package was available only on the two-door and wagon models featuring in addition to &quot;Sport&quot; emblems the following items: Durham Plaid fabric seat trim, leather-wrapped sport steering wheel, P195/75R15 Goodyear Tiempo steel-belted radial tires (which were the first tires made to meet standards for winter tires but intended for year-round use), sport fog lamps, halogen high beam headlamps, dual black remote mirrors, 4X4 sport graphics, black bumpers with nerf strips, black lower body moldings, blackout grille, taillamp paint treatment, side tape stripes, and black moldings on the windshield, rear window, door frames, and B-pillar.

All Eagles came with &quot;Ziebart Factory Rust Protection&quot; that included a five-year &quot;No Rust Thru&quot; transferable warranty. The cars were built using aluminized trim screws, plastic inner fender liners, and galvanized steel in every exterior body panel, and the body went through an epoxy-based primer bath (up to the window line). Eagles were backed by the AMC Buyer Protection Plan, a 12-month/ warranty on everything except the tires.

The drivetrain consisted of one engine, the straight-six, in conjunction with a three-speed automatic transmission (a version of Chrysler&#x27;s A998), with Dana 30 and Dana 35 differentials. All 1980 Eagles came standard with a permanent 4WD system that employed a New Process 119 transfer case with a viscous fluid coupling that allowed the drive system to operate on wet or dry pavement without causing undue suspension and drivetrain wear. Due to its rugged undercarriage, two trailer-towing packages were available for handling trailers weighing up to . The top package included a weight distributing (equalizing) tow hitch, seven-connector wiring harness, wiring, auxiliary transmission oil cooler, 3.54 axle ratio, and also required both the optional heavy-duty battery and automatic load-leveling air shocks.

The 1980 Eagle&#x27;s appearance differed from the Concord&#x27;s in that the bodies were raised further off their suspension to afford better ground clearance. To fill in the increased visual space between the tires and wheel wells, AMC used durable Kraton (polymer) plastic wheel arch flares that flowed into rocker panel extensions. The grille was similar to the 1980 Concord&#x27;s, with horizontal bars spaced slightly further apart and the Eagle emblem mounted to the left side. Because coupes and sedans carried Concord DL equipment as standard, they also carried the Concord DL coupe and sedan roof treatments, featuring vinyl roof coverings and opera windows. However, bumpers were mounted closer to the body than those fitted on Concords due to the Eagle having been classified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency as a light truck. This made Eagles exempt from regular passenger-car regulations that mandated both front and rear bumpers sustain a impact with no damage. As on the Concord, black plastic end caps were featured on the 1980 model year Eagle bumpers.

Demand for the innovative 4WD models caused AMC to discontinue the slow-selling Pacer in December 1979, to allow for increased Eagle production capacity at its assembly facility in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The 4WD components beneath a conventional car made the Eagle popular in regions with snow, and AMC made the Jeep connection explicit creating &quot;an early crossover&quot; vehicle. Production for the 1980 model was: 9,956 four-door sedans, 10,616 two-door sedans, and 25,807 station wagons, for a total of 45,379 units. The Eagle models helped AMC increase total car production to 199,613 units, or 18% higher than the previous year.

====1981====

Changes to the standard (Series 30) Eagle lineup for the 1981 model year were significant. The General Motors- sourced &quot;Iron Duke&quot; inline-four engine became standard equipment, as AMC&#x27;s I6 became optional. The I4 engine was only available with the manual transmission in the Eagle sedans and wagons. The AMC inline-six was redesigned to produce more low-end torque, as well as made smoother running, more economical, and required less maintenance. The engineering improvements to the venerable AMC engine also reduced its weight by to , thus making it &quot;the lightest in-line Six in the domestic industry&quot;.

All Eagles took on a new plastic egg-crate-style grille divided into 24 squares at the front. The Eagle emblem was relocated to the grille header bar. Bumpers were updated so their end caps flowed smoothly into the Kraton plastic wheel arches and rocker panel trim. The Sport package, carried over from 1980 on all three body styles, used the Spirit&#x27;s hood and grille header bar trims starting with the 1981 model year. At , the Series 30 Eagle was also three inches (76 mm) shorter than the previous year.

Two smaller subcompact models, the AMC Eagle Kammback, based on the AMC Spirit sedan (née Gremlin), and the sporty Eagle SX/4, based on the Spirit liftback, debuted as &quot;Eagle Series 50&quot; models. The Kammback and SX/4 came standard with GM&#x27;s &quot;Iron Duke&quot; four-cylinder engine, four-speed manual transmission, and power steering. The Series 50 Eagles reflected the styling updates that the larger Series 30 models showed for 1981. The SX/4 model was available with a Sport package, as well. &quot;Billed as &#x27;the sports car that doesn&#x27;t always need a road&#x27;, the SX/4 two-door hatchback had a sporty look, but hardly qualified as a sports car.&quot; The SX/4 has also been reviewed as &quot;a car decades ahead of its time, it offered a sports car body with increased ground clearance and a four-wheel drive powertrain, creating an entirely new automotive genre overnight.&quot;

At the beginning of the model year, all Eagles carried over the new-for-1980 permanent all-wheel drive system with a viscous fluid coupling that protected the suspension or driveline components from wear during dry pavement use. A &quot;Select Drive&quot; option, which allowed the Eagle to run in two-wheel-drive (RWD) mode and be switched to four-wheel-drive via a dashboard switch, was offered as a mid-year fuel economy measure. The Select Drive system required the vehicle to be stationary when switching between two-wheel and four-wheel-drive.

Road tests by Gary Witzenburg in &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; described the 1981 &quot;Sport&quot; model station wagon as &quot;Snowbird Supreme&quot; after driving it in Detroit&#x27;s worst winter weather and noting the numerous improvements that were incorporated for the new model year building on the AMC Eagle&#x27;s &quot;soundness of design and originality of its concept.&quot;

A road test by &quot;Car and Driver&quot; of the new Eagle SX/4 Sport reported that since it goes where most cars find impossible, it &quot;doesn&#x27;t require pavement to be fun.&quot;

Marketing of the new SX/4 highlighted experiencing what lies beyond the sports car. The advertising was about how the car looked, and with the four-wheel-drive feature, AMC&#x27;s objective was to establish a new market niche: the off-road sports car. Given AMC&#x27;s meager advertising budget, most owners purchased them not as sports cars, but to allow them to go through mud and snow. Reviews in the early 2020s have described it as a &quot;sporty crossover hatchback, built 25 years ahead of its time&quot;. The new model was yet another response to the &quot;many times the odds were stacked against this bold, little automaker from Kenosha, Wisconsin, and how they just kept coming up with new attempts to do things in a novel way.&quot; The SX/4&#x27;s design has been described as simply attractive and successful because it had no polarizing features.

Production for the 1981 model year was 5,603 Kammbacks, 17,340 Liftbacks, 2,378 two-door sedans, 1,737 four-door sedans, and 10,371 station wagons for a total of 37,429 units.

====1982====
New low-drag disc brakes were featured as standard equipment. A five-speed manual transmission joined the options list. The optional automatic transmission received wider gear ratios for better fuel economy. All received as standard equipment the &quot;Select Drive&quot; system that could be changed between all-wheel drive and two-wheel drive for a potential increase in fuel economy. The system put the front axle and prop shaft into the gas-saving freewheeling mode from the driver&#x27;s seat. The Series 30 sedan was no longer available with the Sport package.

Even with the choice of two wheelbase versions and five body styles, the most popular model was the wagon with 20,899 built out of total Eagle production of 37,923 for the 1982 model year. Production of the other available body designs were: 520 Kammbacks, 10,445 Liftbacks, 1,968 two-door sedans, and 4,091 four-door sedans.

====1983====

Few changes were seen for the 1983 model year. The Series 50 Eagle Kammback and Series 30 Eagle two-door sedans were both dropped from the line, due to slow sales. The Series 30 Eagle sedan was no longer available in the Limited trim, leaving only the base model in the Eagle sedan line. The Series 50 SX/4 and Series 30 wagon continued unchanged. These measures reduced costs by streamlining their processes reducing production variations, and therefore, complexity.

Starting in February 1983, the AMC I4 theoretically replaced the GM Iron Duke 151 in the Eagle as the standard engine, though the installation rate is unknown. The I6 was improved for better performance by increasing the compression ratio to 9.2 to 1 (from the previous 8.2 to 1), as well as a fuel feedback system, a knock sensor, and the CEC; thus allowing the continuing use of regular-grade fuel.

A long-term road test by &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; began with the editors describing that the &quot;Eagle is best when working hard&quot; and &quot;you can feel the tremendous traction&quot; of its big all-weather tires in four-wheel drive giving &quot;a great feeling of security.&quot;

Production was: 2,259 Liftbacks, 3,093 four-door sedans, and 12,378 station wagons for a total of 17,730 units in 1983.

====1984====
The Series 50 SX/4 was no longer available with the 1984 model year. The lineup now consisted of the base Series 30 Eagle sedan and wagon as well as the Limited wagon. The base wagon was available with the Sport option trim package.

For 1984, the popular I6 was optional in place of the AMC I4. The four-cylinder engine was installed in only 147 Eagles, but this still allowed AMC to advertise its fuel economy of city and highway with the four-speed transmission and with the five-speed on the highway. The Select Drive system was redesigned to allow Shift on the Fly. (Prior model-year Eagles required two hands to operate the shifting switch, making it difficult, if not impossible, to change while the car was in motion.)

All Eagle models were now assembled in AMC&#x27;s original factory in Brampton, Ontario, Canada because the automaker&#x27;s main Kenosha plant was used for the Renault Alliance and Encore models.

Production for the 1984 model year was: 4,241 four-door sedans and 21,294 station wagons totaling 25,535.

====1985====
Exterior styling was slightly revised as all models used the &quot;power bulge&quot; hood, seen previously on the 1981 through 1983 Eagle Series 50 models. The grille header bar and hood ornament/trim strip were deleted in the process. &quot;Shift-on-the-Fly&quot; capability was added to the Select Drive 4-wheel-drive system as standard equipment. A new key-fob-activated infrared remote keyless system with power locks was newly available as an option. A digitally tuned AM/FM/cassette radio with a built-in power amplifier and four coaxial speakers was also introduced.

The standard powertrain was now the previously optional five-speed manual, with the wide-ratio three-speed automatic transmission as a popular option. The AMC 258 I6 became standard. However, Eagle sales began to drop as AMC was no longer promoting the models. Advertising was limited to dealer signage and even the 1985 sales brochure noted the Eagle&#x27;s history highlighting the introduction in 1980 of the full-time 4WD and the 1982 premiere of the &quot;Select Drivee&quot; system.

American Motors was no longer aggressively marketing the Eagle line and production for the 1985 model year decreased to 2,655 four-door sedans and 13,335 station wagons, for a total of 16,990 units.

====1986====
American Motors introduced the open differential Model 128 transfer case for the Eagle. The automatic transmission no longer had a lockup torque converter. Eagle sales would drop beneath the 10,000 annual unit mark for the first time after the 1986 model year production (and would slide further for its remaining two seasons on the market), as the car was aging due to its seven-season life atop a platform that debuted for 1970.

Production was: 1,274 four-door sedans and 6,943 station wagons, for a total of 8,217 units. The Eagles were now built in AMC&#x27;s Brampton Assembly in Canada alongside AMC&#x27;s new Jeep Wrangler.

====1987====
Though AMC debuted its new fuel-injected I6 engine for 1987 Jeep vehicles, the new engine did not make it under the venerable Eagle&#x27;s hood. The I6 remained the sole engine available in the eight-season-old Eagle sedan and wagon. No major changes were seen on the 1987 Eagle, as American Motors turned its attention to the debut of the imported Renault Medallion. The buyout of the company by Chrysler Corporation took effect officially on 5 August 1987.

Production for the 1987 model year was: 454 four-door sedans, and 5,468 or 4,564 (varies with source) station wagons, for a total of 5,018 to 5,922 (varies with source) units.

====1988====

Chrysler took over AMC, but the production of the Eagles continued for the 1988 model year. The car&#x27;s name was officially changed from AMC Eagle to Eagle Wagon. However, all of the AMC badges, build sheets, and door plaques were carried over. The VIN was no different under the new corporate owner, other than the digit for the year. Although the paperwork that came with the 1988 Eagles continued to indicate that American Motors Canada, Ltd. built them, the company as named ceased to exist, since it became a subsidiary of Chrysler in the buyout, as did all AMC properties. The final car rolled out of AMC&#x27;s original Brampton Assembly Plant in Brampton, Ontario on 14 December 1987. In its place, production was increased of the Jeep Wrangler that was built there.

The sedan and Limited wagon models were discontinued, leaving the wagon as the only available version in 1988, its final season, and now under Chrysler&#x27;s ownership. The standard and only I6 engine was rated at and came with either a 5-speed manual or automatic transmission with AMC&#x27;s Select-Drive system. Standard equipment in 1988 that was previously optional included air conditioning system, rear window defroster, halogen headlamps, AM/FM stereo radio, light group (glove box, dome, and engine lights), and adjustable steering wheel. The following remained optional equipment for the 1988 production: power windows, power seats, power mirrors, radio with cassette player, cruise control, rear window wiper, wood grain side panels, floor mats, headlamp warning buzzer, intermittent wipers, wire wheel covers, and a cold climate group.

Total 1988 model year production was 2,306 units, all station wagons.

==Sundancer convertibles==

Not only is the AMC Eagle described as &quot;the first-ever crossover,&quot; but the model line included a convertible body style. In 1980, AMC entered into an agreement with the Griffith Company for a convertible version of its newly introduced Eagle and a prototype version was developed. The cars were marketed during the 1981 and 1982 model years as the Sundancer.

The Eagle&#x27;s monocoque (unibody) body was reinforced and a steel targa roll bar was welded to the door pillars for passenger compartment protection. The front portion of the roof was a removable lightweight fiberglass hatch, while the rear section of polyvinyl material and the back window folded down and had a boot cover when in the down position. While the convertible versions used standard Eagle components the flexible back section of the top is a custom part.

The conversions were approved by AMC with the cars ordered through select AMC dealers in the customer&#x27;s selection of options and exterior colors. They were available in the top &quot;Limited&quot; trim level that included leather upholstery. The conversion cost approximately $3,000 and the dealer&#x27;s list price was $3,750. The conversion was performed by Griffith, which was originally established to build race cars based on the English TVR sports car. Headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the cars were shipped from Kenosha for the conversion and then to the ordering AMC dealer. The model did not achieve significant sales and was dropped for the 1983 model year as AMC expanded the Eagle range with the introduction of the sub-compact SX/4 and Kammback versions.

Griffith was also responsible for the similar &quot;Sunchaser&quot; Toyota Celica convertible. These conversions are considered coach convertibles.

==Turbo diesel==
Another factory-approved conversion was the 1980 turbo-diesel. The engines producing and of torque were supplied by VM Motori. Only about seven are thought to have been manufactured. Two are accounted for in one of the AMC Eagle clubs.

The marketing literature for the conversions noted the cars are equipped with larger fuel tanks, which together with diesel economy and an optional overdrive transmission, would give the cars up to range. However, the $9,000 price tag for the conversion limited the car&#x27;s market appeal and the turbo-diesel option was discontinued.

==Racing==
The AMC Eagle was campaigned in the SCCA ProRally racing series, organized by the Sports Car Club of America, a sanctioning body supporting road racing, rallying, and autocross events across the U.S.

===1981 ProRally series===
Drivers Guy Light and Jim Brandt finished the 1981 Northern Lights rally just three minutes behind first place in the Production Class &quot;despite nailing a tree dead center with their brand new AMC Eagle SX/4.&quot; Two weeks later at the Chisum Trail rally, the Light and Brandt SX/4 captured fifth place overall, as well as won first in the Production Class, &quot;only the second rally for the Michigan team in their new Eagle.&quot; The next event was the Susquehannock Trail rally that saw the first-place winner face &quot;a stiff challenge&quot; from Light and Brandt&#x27;s SX/4 that captured second less than a minute later. At the Centennial rally held in Monument, Colorado, the Light and Brandt team in their AMC Eagle SX/4 placed third in the Production class and seventh overall. There were three entries with AMC Eagle SX/4s in the Sunriser 400 rally. Light and Brandt won the Production Class and finished seventh overall, followed by drivers Gene Henderson and Jim Kloosterman placing fourth in Production and eleventh overall, but Steve Dorr and Bob Lyle did not complete the race. With only 33 cars finishing out of 71 that entered, the grueling Press-on-Regardless Rally held in Michigan. Light and Brandt placed their SX/4 just two minutes behind the winning team in the Production Class.

The AMC Eagle SX/4 cars captured both second and third place in the 1981 Sno*Drift Production Class rally held on Michigan&#x27;s snow-covered gravel surface roads in January. Second in the Production Class and sixth overall were Henderson and Kloosterman. &quot;They were robbed of a nearly certain win in the class when the route was blocked on the 12th stage by John Woolf ... [who] was in second place when the car slid on the ice and went straight into a bank tearing off the right front strut and setting the car straight across the road. Henderson was blocked and had to help clear the car from the road before he could continue. They lost two minutes, two places, and a win in the class.&quot; Third place Production and seventh overall in this two-day race in Grayling, Michigan, went to Guy Light and Jim Brandt. The finale of the 1981 SCCA ProRally season was held in Reno, Nevada. This is where Light and Brandt drove their AMC Eagle SX/4 to an eight-minute victory over the second-place finisher in the Production Class, as well as placing tenth overall.

The Light and Brandt team ended 1981 with second place in total points for both driver and co-driver, as well as helping put AMC third in the Production Manufacturer standings for the ProRally season.

===1982 ProRally series===
The first event of 1982 was the Big Bend Bash rally in Alpine, Texas, with Gene Henderson and Jim Kloosterman taking Production Class in their AMC Eagle SX/4, &quot;but even that car&#x27;s four-wheel-drive couldn&#x27;t save it from trouble in the deep water... They got stuck in the middle of a water-filled wash on stage four and had to be pushed and pulled out.&quot; The next event, the 100 Acre Wood rally saw &quot;the Production Class battle was as exciting as the Overall warfare with four Production Class cars finishing in the top ten, all within a minute and a half, after a full night of rallying.&quot; The Henderson and Kloosterman team placed their SX/4 third in the Production Class and ninth overall. The AMC Eagle of Henderson and Kloosterman &quot;in the lead ... but that didn&#x27;t last... On stage 10 the car rolled, ending wheels up on the stage&quot; at the Olympus rally in Tumwater, Washington. At the next event, the Northern Lights rally, the Henderson and Kloosterman SX/4 ended in sixth place in Production and tenth overall. The Budweiser Forest rally held in Circleville, Ohio, put the Henderson and Kloosterman SX/4 in second place for production cars and eighth overall. The Centennial rally was held in Colorado with of many of the rally&#x27;s stages at a altitude, but the Henderson and Kloosterman AMC Eagle SX/4 was just a minute and a half behind the winner with a turbocharged engine in the Production Class and placed seventh overall. The next event, the Tour de Forest rally in Washington State saw the SX/4 of Henderson and Kloosterman finish in fourth place for Production and eighth overall. The SX/4 took second place driven by Henderson and Kloosterman in the 1982 Sno*Drift Production Class in Michigan. &quot;Henderson and his AMC Eagle used the car&#x27;s 4wd to good advantage and chipped away at [the] lead[er] after the rains started early Sunday morning. The rally ended, however, before Henderson could pull it off&quot; just 24 seconds behind first place.

American Motors was awarded third place among Production Manufacturers for the season.

===1983 ProRally series===
The 100 Acre Wood rally in Salem, Missouri, started the season with Gene Henderson and Jim Kloosterman placing their SX/4 second in the Production Class and seventh overall. At the Budweiser Forest rally in Chillicothe, Ohio, &quot;Henderson was the leader in the class in his AMC Eagle SX/4 through the first two-thirds of the 12-hour rally... Some seven stages from the end, Henderson&#x27;s Eagle began to have engine trouble and lost one cylinder&quot;. The Nor&#x27;wester rally held in Tumwater, Washington, had perfect weather (cold, rain, and 11 stages covered with more than six inches of snow) that &quot;helped Production Class winners [and fourth place overall] Gene Henderson and Jim Kloosterman since, &quot;It was perfect conditions for our 4wd (AMC) Eagle. We love that slop&quot;. At the next event, the Olympus International, Henderson and Kloosterman was an early leader, but retired with a blown engine in his AMC Eagle SX/4; however, Gene&#x27;s son, Garry Henderson, in another SX/4 with co-driver Mike Van Leo, placed second in the Production Class and sixth overall. The inaugural three-day Michigan International rally should have been easy for the AMC Eagle SX/4, but &quot;several of the very sandy stages that would have been to Henderson&#x27;s advantage were canceled&quot; so with co-driver Jon Wickens, the team finished second in the Production Class and tenth overall. The next event with the SX/4 was the Manistee Trails rally in Michigan, where Henderson and Kloosterman won the Production class and finished fifth overall. At the November Press-on-Regardless rally, Henderson was &quot;dominating things in the early going until a big rock took a bite out of the AMC Eagle&#x27;s transfer case putting it out of the rally.&quot; The Henderson and Kloosterman team finished the 1983 Sno*Drift in third place for Production Class and sixth overall.

For the 1983 season, Henderson and Kloosterman ranked second as drivers, while AMC was third among the Production Manufacturers.

===1984 ProRally series===
There were two AMC Eagle SX/4 entries in the 1984 Press-on-Regardless rally with Gene Henderson and Mike VanLoo&#x27;s car finishing in third place. At the next event, the Oregon Trail rally in Beaverton, Oregon, also had two AMC Eagles with the SX/4 driven by Gene Henderson and Doug Foster finishing in tenth position.

===1985 ProRally series===
The team of Daniel and Betty-Ann Gilliland took their SX/4 to tenth place, while Bob Lyle and Dan Way in an AMC Eagle finished 37th in the Susquehannock Trail rally held in Wellsboro, Pennsylvania. The Gillilands then went on to finish in seventh place, one of two AMC Eagles that were entered in the Dodge ProRally event in Battle Creek, Michigan. In the next event, the Sunriser 400 Forest rally in Chillicothe, Ohio, where the Gilliland&#x27;s finished in eighth place.

===1986 ProRally series===
The opening event of 1986, the Tulip 200 Forest rally, had four AMC Eagles racing, with Daniel and Betty-Ann Gilliland driving their SX/4 to fifth place overall, while Dave Sampson and Mike Puffenberger finished in 33rd. The Susquehannock Trail rally included three AMC Eagles, with Wayne and Karl Scheible finishing 32nd overall, while Bob Lyle and Dan Way completed the race in 43rd, both running in the Production Class. The Dave Sampson and Mike Puffenberger team drove their SX/4 to 34th finish in the Sunriser 400 Forest rally.

===1988 ProRally series===
The Susquehannock Trail rally in 1988 saw Bob Lyle and Art Mendolia in their AMC Eagle finish in 29th place overall.

==International markets==
===Germany===
AMC Eagles were imported into Germany by Allrad Schmitt in Höchberg, Würzburg in Bavaria which had been the sole importer of AMC Jeeps since 1977. The company specialized in off-road vehicles and thus the Eagle was imported starting in 1980.

===Japan===
AMC Eagles were imported into Japan, in their original left-hand drive, from 1985 to 1989 under the country&#x27;s new &quot;Action Plan of 1985&quot; which was implemented to simplify Japan&#x27;s importation processes including motor vehicles. Kintetsu Shibaura Automotive Maintenance Company Ltd. began importing the AMC Eagle Wagon and XJ-generation Jeep Cherokee. The company was absorbed into Kintetsu Motors in 1986 which continued to import the Eagle and the Cherokee until 1989.

===Switzerland===
The Eagle and other AMC models and Jeeps were imported to Switzerland by J.H. Keller in Zurich. During the 1970s until around 1986, AMC&#x27;s International Operations exported Pacers, Javelins, Concords as well as Jeep CJs and Wagoneers that were built in the US or Canada.

==Legacy==
The AMC Eagle &quot;was arguably a decade ahead of its time.&quot; It was a passenger car that &quot;pioneered the crossover SUV&quot; category. Introduced in late 1979 for the 1980 model year, it &quot;was unlike anything on the market&quot; and in the 2000s &quot;the somewhat traditional SUV has given way to the &#x27;crossover utility vehicle&#x27; ... the market has become saturated with these new crossovers that provide a car-like driving experience with the security of a little more ground clearance and all-wheel drive&quot; making the AMC Eagle &quot;about 30 years ahead of the curve.&quot;

The Eagle had character and survival skills and gained a loyal following. They were a precursor to today&#x27;s crossover models and the &quot;vehicles worked well and sold well.&quot; Total production was 197,449 units in one generation.

Although the original AMC Eagle was not produced after 1988, the Eagle brand, as part of the newly formed Jeep-Eagle division of the Chrysler Corporation, would soldier on.

After buying out AMC, Chrysler gained the lucrative Jeep operation, but it was also &quot;saddled with a largely unsuccessful assortment of cars AMC was bringing in from French affiliate and part owner&quot; Renault. The new Jeep-Eagle division included a combination of the Renault-based vehicles, the imported Eagle Medallion and the North American built Eagle Premier, as well as re-trimmed Japanese Mitsubishi models: Eagle Summit, Eagle Summit Wagon, Eagle Talon, Eagle 2000GTX (Canada only), and Eagle Vista (Canada only). A Chrysler-designed vehicle, the Eagle Vision, was added in 1993.

After the AMC-based 4-wheel-drive Eagle wagon was dropped, Chrysler and Eagle officials were busy figuring out which type of vehicles would be best for the new division. The four-wheel-drive sporty Eagle concept would continue in spirit by offering all-wheel-drive optionally on the Mitsubishi-based 1990–98 Eagle Talon, the Canadian-market 1989–91 Eagle Vista wagon, and 1992–96 Eagle Summit Wagon. However, the &quot;Eagle car lineup for &#x27;90 differed significantly from the one that bowed in 1987, on the heels of Chrysler&#x27;s buyout of AMC.&quot;

The brand included vehicles from different companies with various characteristics that included economy, sportiness, and luxury. Due to poor marketing, sales never met expectations. Chrysler discontinued the Eagle brand after the 1998 model year.

<doc id="1320356" wikidata="Q469059" url="?curid=1320356" title="Mary Sidney">
<text>Mary Herbert, Countess of Pembroke ( Sidney, 27 October 1561 – 25 September 1621) was among the first Englishwomen to gain notice for her poetry and her literary patronage. By the age of 39, she was listed with her brother Philip Sidney and with Edmund Spenser and William Shakespeare among the notable authors of the day in John Bodenham&#x27;s verse miscellany &quot;Belvidere&quot;. Her play &quot;Antonius&quot; (a translation of Robert Garnier&#x27;s &quot;Marc Antoine&quot;) is widely seen as reviving interest in soliloquy based on classical models and as a likely source of Samuel Daniel&#x27;s closet drama &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1594) and of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; (1607). She was also known for translating Petrarch&#x27;s &quot;Triumph of Death&quot;, for the poetry anthology &quot;Triumphs&quot;, and above all for a lyrical, metrical translation of the Psalms.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Mary Sidney was born on 27 October 1561 at Tickenhill Palace in the parish of Bewdley, Worcestershire. She was one of the seven children – three sons and four daughters – of Sir Henry Sidney and wife Mary Dudley. Their eldest son was Sir Philip Sidney (1554–1586), and their second son Robert Sidney (1563–1626), who later became Earl of Leicester. As a child, she spent much time at court where her mother was a gentlewoman of the Privy Chamber and a close confidante of Queen Elizabeth I. Like her brother Philip, she received a humanist education which included music, needlework, and Latin, French and Italian. After the death of Sidney&#x27;s youngest sister, Ambrosia, in 1575, the Queen requested that Mary return to court to join the royal entourage.

===Marriage and children===

In 1577, Mary Sidney married Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (1538–1601), a close ally of the family. The marriage was arranged by her father in concert with her uncle, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester. After her marriage, Mary became responsible with her husband for the management of a number of estates which he owned including Ramsbury, Ivychurch, Wilton House, and Baynard&#x27;s Castle in London, where it is known that they entertained Queen Elizabeth to dinner. She had four children by her husband:
*William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke (1580–1630), was the eldest son and heir.
*Katherine Herbert (1581–1584) died as an infant.
*Anne Herbert (born 1583 – after 1603) was thought also to have been a writer and a storyteller.
*Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke (1584–1650), succeeded his brother in 1630. Philip and his older brother William were the &quot;incomparable pair of brethren&quot; to whom the First Folio of Shakespeare&#x27;s collected works was dedicated in 1623.

Mary Sidney was an aunt to the poet Mary Wroth, daughter of her brother Robert.

===Later life===
The death of Sidney&#x27;s husband in 1601 left her with less financial support than she might have expected, though views on its adequacy vary; at the time the majority of an estate was left to the eldest son.

In addition to the arts, Sidney had a range of interests. She had a chemistry laboratory at Wilton House, where she developed medicines and invisible ink. From 1609 to 1615, Mary Sidney probably spent most of her time at Crosby Hall in London.

She travelled with her doctor, Matthew Lister, to Spa, Belgium in 1616. Dudley Carleton met her in the company of Helene de Melun, &quot;Countess of Berlaymont&quot;, wife of Florent de Berlaymont the governor of Luxembourg. The two women amused themselves with pistol shooting. Sir John Throckmorton heard she went on to Amiens. There is conjecture that she married Lister, but no evidence of this.

She died of smallpox on 25 September 1621, aged 59, at her townhouse in Aldersgate Street in London, shortly after King James I had visited her at the newly completed Houghton House in Bedfordshire. After a grand funeral in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, her body was buried in Salisbury Cathedral, next to that of her late husband in the Herbert family vault, under the steps leading to the choir stalls, where the mural monument still stands.

==Literary career==
===Wilton House===

Mary Sidney turned Wilton House into a &quot;paradise for poets&quot;, known as the &quot;Wilton Circle,&quot; a salon-type literary group sustained by her hospitality, which included Edmund Spenser, Samuel Daniel, Michael Drayton, Ben Jonson, and Sir John Davies. John Aubrey wrote, &quot;Wilton House was like a college, there were so many learned and ingenious persons. She was the greatest patroness of wit and learning of any lady in her time.&quot; It has been suggested that the premiere of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;As You Like It&quot; was at Wilton during her life.

Sidney received more dedications than any other woman of non-royal status. By some accounts, King James I visited Wilton on his way to his coronation in 1603 and stayed again at Wilton following the coronation to avoid the plague. She was regarded as a muse by Daniel in his sonnet cycle &quot;Delia&quot;, an anagram for ideal.

Her brother, Philip Sidney, wrote much of his &quot;Arcadia&quot; in her presence, at Wilton House. He also probably began preparing his English lyric version of the Book of Psalms at Wilton as well.

===Sidney psalter===
Philip Sidney had completed translating 43 of the 150 Psalms at the time of his death on a military campaign against the Spanish in the Netherlands in 1586. She finished his translation, composing Psalms 44 through to 150 in a dazzling array of verse forms, using the 1560 Geneva Bible and commentaries by John Calvin and Theodore Beza. Hallett Smith has called the psalter a &quot;School of English Versification&quot; , of 171 poems (Psalm 119 is a gathering of 22 separate ones). A copy of the completed psalter was prepared for Queen Elizabeth I in 1599, in anticipation of a royal visit to Wilton, but Elizabeth cancelled her planned visit. This work is usually referred to as The Sidney Psalms or The Sidney-Pembroke Psalter and regarded as a major influence on the development of English religious lyric poetry in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. John Donne wrote a poem celebrating the verse psalter and claiming he could &quot;scarce&quot; call the English Church reformed until its psalter had been modelled after the poetic transcriptions of Philip Sidney and Mary Herbert.

Although the psalms were not printed in her lifetime, they were extensively distributed in manuscript. There are 17 manuscripts extant today. A later engraving of Herbert shows her holding them. Her literary influence can be seen in literary patronage, in publishing her brother&#x27;s works and in her own verse forms, dramas, and translations. Contemporary poets who commended Herbert&#x27;s psalms include Samuel Daniel, Sir John Davies, John Donne, Michael Drayton, Sir John Harington, Ben Jonson, Emilia Lanier and Thomas Moffet. The importance of these is evident in the devotional lyrics of Barnabe Barnes, Nicholas Breton, Henry Constable, Francis Davison, Giles Fletcher, and Abraham Fraunce. Their influence on the later religious poetry of Donne, George Herbert, Henry Vaughan, and John Milton has been critically recognized since Louis Martz placed it at the start of a developing tradition of 17th-century devotional lyricism.

Sidney was instrumental in bringing her brother&#x27;s &quot;An Apology for Poetry&quot; or &quot;Defence of Poesy&quot; into print. She circulated the Sidney–Pembroke Psalter in manuscript at about the same time. This suggests a common purpose in their design. Both argued, in formally different ways, for the ethical recuperation of poetry as an instrument for moral instruction — particularly religious instruction. Sidney also took on editing and publishing her brother&#x27;s &quot;Arcadia&quot;, which he claimed to have written in her presence as &quot;The Countesse of Pembroke&#x27;s Arcadia&quot;.

===Other works===
Sidney&#x27;s closet drama &quot;Antonius&quot; is a translation of a French play, &quot;Marc-Antoine&quot; (1578) by Robert Garnier. Mary is known to have translated two other works: &quot;A Discourse of Life and Death&quot; by Philippe de Mornay, published with &quot;Antonius&quot; in 1592, and Petrarch&#x27;s &quot;The Triumph of Death,&quot; circulated in manuscript. Her original poems include the pastoral &quot;A Dialogue betweene Two Shepheards, Thenot and Piers, in praise of Astrea,&quot; and two dedicatory addresses, one to Elizabeth I and one to her own brother Philip, contained in the Tixall manuscript copy of her verse psalter. An elegy for Philip, &quot;The dolefull lay of Clorinda&quot;, was published in &quot;Colin Clouts Come Home Againe&quot; (1595) and attributed to Spenser and to Mary Herbert, but Pamela Coren attributes it to Spenser, though also saying that Mary&#x27;s poetic reputation does not suffer from loss of the attribution.

By at least 1591, the Pembrokes were providing patronage to a playing company, Pembroke&#x27;s Men, one of the early companies to perform works of Shakespeare. According to one account, Shakespeare&#x27;s company &quot;The King&#x27;s Men&quot; performed at Wilton at this time.

June and Paul Schlueter published an article in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; of 23 July 2010 describing a manuscript of newly discovered works by Mary Sidney Herbert.

Her poetic epitaph, ascribed to Ben Jonson but more likely to have been written in an earlier form by the poets William Browne and her son William, summarizes how she was regarded in her own day:
&lt;poem style=&quot;padding:0 8em;&quot;&gt;Underneath this sable hearse,
Lies the subject of all verse,
Sidney&#x27;s sister, Pembroke&#x27;s mother.
Death, ere thou hast slain another
Fair and learned and good as she,
Time shall throw a dart at thee.&lt;/poem&gt;

Her literary talents and aforementioned family connections to Shakespeare has caused her to be nominated as one of the many claimants named as the true author of the works of William Shakespeare in the Shakespeare authorship question.

==In popular culture==
Mary Sidney appears as a character in Deborah Harkness&#x27;s novel &quot;Shadow of Night&quot;, which is the second instalment of her &quot;All Souls&quot; trilogy. Sidney is portrayed by Amanda Hale in the second season of the television adaptation of the book.

<doc id="1320360" wikidata="Q1967557" url="?curid=1320360" title="Spectral power distribution">
<text>In radiometry, photometry, and color science, a spectral power distribution (SPD) measurement describes the power per unit area per unit wavelength of an illumination (radiant exitance). More generally, the term &quot;spectral power distribution&quot; can refer to the concentration, as a function of wavelength, of any radiometric or photometric quantity (e.g. radiant energy, radiant flux, radiant intensity, radiance, irradiance, radiant exitance, radiosity, luminance, luminous flux, luminous intensity, illuminance, luminous emittance).

Knowledge of the SPD is crucial for optical-sensor system applications. Optical properties such as transmittance, reflectivity, and absorbance as well as the sensor response are typically dependent on the incident wavelength.

== Physics ==

Mathematically, for the spectral power distribution of a radiant exitance or irradiance one may write:
: formula_1
where &quot;M&quot;(&quot;λ&quot;) is the spectral irradiance (or exitance) of the light (SI units: W/m2 = kg·m−1·s−3); &quot;Φ&quot; is the radiant flux of the source (SI unit: watt, W); &quot;A&quot; is the area over which the radiant flux is integrated (SI unit: square meter, m2); and &quot;λ&quot; is the wavelength (SI unit: meter, m). (Note that it is more convenient to express the wavelength of light in terms of nanometers; spectral exitance would then be expressed in units of W·m−2·nm−1.) The approximation is valid when the area and wavelength interval are small.

==Relative SPD==
The ratio of spectral concentration (irradiance or exitance) at a given wavelength to the concentration of a reference wavelength provides the relative SPD. This can be written as:
: formula_2
For instance, the luminance of lighting fixtures and other light sources are handled separately, a spectral power distribution may be normalized in some manner, often to unity at 555 or 560 nanometers, coinciding with the peak of the eye&#x27;s luminosity function.

==Responsivity==
The SPD can be used to determine the response of a sensor at a specified wavelength. This compares the output power of the sensor to the input power as a function of wavelength. This can be generalized in the following formula:
: formula_3
Knowing the responsitivity is beneficial for determination of illumination, interactive material components, and optical components to optimize performance of a system&#x27;s design.

==Source SPD and matter==
The spectral power distribution over the visible spectrum from a source can have varying concentrations of relative SPDs. The interactions between light and matter affect the absorption and reflectance properties of materials and subsequently produces a color that varies with source illumination.

For example, the relative spectral power distribution of the sun produces a white appearance if observed directly, but when the sunlight illuminates the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere the sky appears blue under normal daylight conditions. This stems from the optical phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering which produces a concentration of shorter wavelengths and hence the blue color appearance.

==Source SPD and color appearance==
The human visual response relies on trichromacy to process color appearance. While the human visual response integrates over all wavelengths, the relative spectral power distribution will provide color appearance modeling information as the concentration of wavelength band(s) will become the primary contributors to the perceived color.

This becomes useful in photometry and colorimetry as the perceived color changes with source illumination and spectral distribution and coincides with metamerisms where an object&#x27;s color appearance changes.

The spectral makeup of the source can also coincide with color temperature producing differences in color appearance due to the source&#x27;s temperature.

Cheney is the elder daughter of former vice president Dick Cheney and second lady Lynne Cheney. She held several positions in the U.S. State Department during the George W. Bush administration. She promoted regime change in Iran while chairing the Iran Syria Policy and Operations Group with Elliott Abrams. In 2009, Cheney and Bill Kristol founded Keep America Safe, a nonprofit organization concerned with national security issues that supported the Bush–Cheney administration&#x27;s positions. In 2014 she was briefly a candidate for the U.S. Senate in Wyoming, challenging incumbent Mike Enzi before withdrawing. She was elected to the House of Representatives in 2016, holding the same seat her father had held from 1979 to 1989.

Regarded as a leading ideological neoconservative in the Bush–Cheney tradition as well as representative of the Republican establishment, Cheney is known for her pro-business stances and hawkish foreign policy views. She was critical of the foreign policy of the Donald Trump administration while consistently voting in favor of Trump&#x27;s overall agenda.

Cheney supported the second impeachment of Donald Trump following the 2021 storming of the U.S. Capitol. Her impeachment vote and criticism of Donald Trump led to her eventual removal from Republican leadership in May 2021. In July 2021, Speaker Nancy Pelosi appointed Cheney to the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack. Two months later, she was made vice chair of the committee. Her role on the committee resulted in the Wyoming Republican Party revoking Cheney&#x27;s membership in November 2021 as well as censure from the Republican National Committee in February 2022.

In 2022, Cheney lost renomination in Wyoming&#x27;s Republican primary to Trump-endorsed Harriet Hageman in a landslide, garnering just 28.9% of the vote. Cheney has said that she intends to be &quot;the leader, one of the leaders, in a fight to help to restore&quot; the Republican Party. She later endorsed and campaigned for Kamala Harris&#x27;s unsuccessful run in the 2024 presidential election. In 2025 she was awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal and pardoned from potential future prosecution by President Joe Biden.

==Early life and education==
Elizabeth Lynne Cheney was born on July 28, 1966, in Madison, Wisconsin. She is the elder of two daughters of former vice president Dick Cheney and former second lady Lynne Cheney (née Vincent). At the time of her birth, her parents were studying at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Her younger sister, Mary Cheney, was also born in Madison. Cheney attended part of sixth and seventh grade in Casper, Wyoming, while her father campaigned for Congress. The family divided its time between Casper and Washington, D.C., in the 1970s through the 1980s, following her father&#x27;s election to Congress. In 1984 Cheney graduated from McLean High School in suburban Washington, D.C., where she was a cheerleader. She received her BA from Colorado College, her mother&#x27;s alma mater, where she wrote a senior thesis entitled &quot;The Evolution of Presidential War Powers.&quot; She received her JD from the University of Chicago Law School in 1996. While there, she also took courses in Middle Eastern history at the Oriental Institute.

==Early career==
Before attending law school, Cheney worked for the State Department for five years and the United States Agency for International Development between 1989 and 1993. After 1993, she took a job at Armitage Associates LLP, the consulting firm founded by Richard Armitage, then a former Defense Department official and later the deputy secretary of state.

After graduation from law school, Cheney practiced law at the law firm of White &amp; Case and as an international law attorney and consultant at the International Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank Group. She was also special assistant to the deputy secretary of state for assistance to the former Soviet Union, and a USAID officer in U.S. embassies in Budapest and Warsaw.

==State Department==

===Deputy assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs===
In 2002, Cheney was appointed deputy assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, a preexisting vacant post with an &quot;economic portfolio&quot;, a mandate to promote investment in the region. Amid reports, including a &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed piece by Paul Krugman, that the job was created especially for her, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said that she had come recommended by then-Secretary of State Colin Powell. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported that Cheney&#x27;s appointment was &quot;the most intriguing sign that America is getting serious about Middle East reform&quot; and &quot;a measure of the seriousness with which the administration was taking Middle East programmes for literacy, education, and reform.&quot; The appointment followed publicized policy divisions between the vice president&#x27;s office and the State Department on Middle East policy. In that position, she was given control of the Middle East Partnership Initiative, designed to &quot;foster increased democracy and economic progress in a troubled region&quot;. The program spent $29 million in 2002, increased to $129 million in the following year. Cheney&#x27;s task was to channel money to prescreened groups, some of which were not identified publicly for fear of retaliations from extant governments they sought to undermine. For the budget year 2004, the project sought $145 million.

===2004 Bush–Cheney reelection campaign===

After two years, Cheney left her State Department post in 2003 to work for the Bush–Cheney 2004 reelection campaign. She participated in the campaign&#x27;s &quot;W Stands for Women&quot; initiative to target female voters.

===Principal deputy assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs===
On February 14, 2005, she returned to the U.S. State Department and was appointed principal deputy assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs and coordinator for broader Middle East and North Africa initiatives. In this position, Cheney supported the assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, C. David Welch, and coordinated multilateral efforts to promote and support democracy and expand education and economic opportunities in the Middle East and North Africa. Cheney oversaw the launch of two semi-independent foundations, the Fund of the Future (worth $100 million), to provide capital for small businesses, and the Foundation of the Future (worth $55 million), to promote freedom of the press and democracy. In that capacity, Cheney endorsed a draft of a new Iraqi constitution.

===Iran Syria Policy and Operations Group===
Cheney also headed the Iran Syria Policy and Operations Group (ISOG), established in March 2006, a unit within the State Department&#x27;s Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs.

In April 2006, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a story that was critical of Cheney&#x27;s work, particularly with respect to Iran. The International Republican Institute, a grants program administered by Cheney&#x27;s unit in collaboration with a Republican-affiliated foundation, received particular scrutiny. Shortly before the ISOG group was dissolved, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice initiated a major effort to engage Iran and Syria in efforts to stabilize Iraq.

==Post–State Department career==
In June 2007 Cheney signed on as one of three national co-chairs of Fred Thompson&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign. The others were Spencer Abraham and George Allen. In a press release issued at the beginning of his campaign, Thompson said he was &quot;very pleased to announce that former senators Abraham and Allen, as well as Liz Cheney, will serve as co-chairs of my national leadership team&quot;. He added: &quot;These distinguished individuals bring wise counsel and invaluable experience to my campaign leadership team, and they will play a critical role in helping spread my consistent conservative message across America.&quot; After Thompson dropped out of the race, Cheney joined Mitt Romney&#x27;s presidential campaign as a senior foreign policy advisor.

In October 2009, Liz Cheney, William Kristol, and Deborah Burlingame launched, as board members, the nonprofit 501(c)(4) organization Keep America Safe. The group&#x27;s stated purpose is to &quot;provide information for concerned Americans about critical national security issues&quot;. It drew strong criticism from conservative lawyers, many of whom had worked for the Bush administration, after its campaign against &quot;The Al Qaeda 7&quot;, seven Justice Department lawyers in the Obama administration who previously had worked as defense lawyers for Guantanamo detainees. Shortly after, all information about the organization disappeared from the Internet.

In January 2012, Cheney was hired as a contributor for Fox News. She guest-hosted programs such as &quot;Hannity&quot; and &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot;. The network terminated her contract in July 2013 after she started her 2014 bid for the Senate in Wyoming.

==2014 U.S. Senate bid==
On July 16, 2013, Cheney launched a run for the Senate in 2014 from Wyoming as a Republican, challenging incumbent Republican senator Mike Enzi. The National Republican Senatorial Committee said it would back Enzi, as was policy. Cheney was expected to receive strong fundraising, but was subject to public perceptions of carpetbagging, having lived in Wyoming only a few years as a child before purchasing a home there in 2012. When she launched her 2014 Senate campaign, she did it with a Facebook post geotagged to McLean, Virginia, her primary residence at the time. During that campaign, &quot;The New Republic&quot; columnist Jon Ward wrote, &quot;she talked up her Wyoming roots and dressed in boots. But when I chatted with her at one stop, her jeans were so new that her hands were stained blue from touching them.&quot; In the video she noted that the Cheney family first came to Wyoming in 1852. Her father represented Wyoming in the House from 1979 to 1989.

In her first campaign appearance in Cheyenne, Cheney said, &quot;We have to not be afraid of being called obstructionists. Obstructing President Obama&#x27;s policies and his agenda isn&#x27;t actually obstruction; it&#x27;s patriotism.&quot; Cheney claimed that Obama had &quot;literally declared war&quot; on the First and Second amendments to the United States Constitution as well as the interests of Wyoming ranchers and energy workers who faced regulations from the United States Environmental Protection Agency.

Cheney&#x27;s campaign was marred by criticism from her championing of &quot;hawkish&quot; foreign policy positions to a public spat with her sister over her opposition to same-sex marriage. Enzi&#x27;s continuing popularity made it difficult for Cheney to make inroads with Wyoming Republicans. On January 6, 2014, Cheney withdrew from the race, citing family health issues.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
====2016====
After Wyoming congresswoman Cynthia Lummis retired in the fall of 2015, Cheney launched a campaign for her House seat on February 1, 2016. She was widely considered the front-runner, and a poll commissioned by the &quot;Casper Star-Tribune&quot; and Wyoming PBS showed her leading in the Republican primarythe real contest in this heavily Republican state. She won a crowded Republican primary with 38% of the vote, and went on to win the general election.

====2018====

In the November 6 general election, Cheney was reelected to the House with 127,951 votes, defeating Democrat Greg Hunter (59,898 votes), Libertarian Richard Brubaker (6,918) and Constitution Party candidate Daniel Clyde Cummings (6,069). Cheney won 21 of 23 counties, losing Albany and Teton Counties to Hunter. On November 14, the Republican membership elected Cheney chair of the House Republican Conference for the 116th Congress. In this post, she was the third-ranking Republican in the chamber, behind Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Minority Whip Steve Scalise.

====2020====

Cheney defeated Blake Stanley in the Republican primary with 73% of the vote, and Democrat Lynnette Grey Bull in the general election with 69% of the vote.

====2022====
Cheney lost the August 16, 2022, Republican primary to pro-Trump candidate Harriet Hageman, with 28.9% of the vote to Hageman&#x27;s 66.3%. Her margin of defeat was the second-worst for a House incumbent in the last 60 years, behind that of South Carolina Republican Bob Inglis in a 2010 primary runoff.

===Tenure===
Cheney was sworn into office on January 3, 2017. Donald Trump became president that same month, and an analysis by FiveThirtyEight found Cheney supported Trump&#x27;s position in 92.9% of House votes.

She co-sponsored legislation that would end protection for gray wolves in the Endangered Species Act.

In May 2019, Cheney said that Peter Strzok and another FBI agent who sent personal text messages in which they disparaged various politicians (including Trump) sounded as if they were planning a &quot;coup&quot; and may be guilty of &quot;treason&quot;.
In June 2019, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez compared the holding centers for illegal immigrants at the Mexico–United States border to &quot;concentration camps&quot;. Cheney criticized her words, saying they showed &quot;disrespect&quot; for Holocaust victims.

Speaking as chairwoman at a House Republican Conference in August 2019, Cheney said that the successful litigation (&quot;Crow Tribe et al v. Zinke&quot;) by Native tribes and environmentalists to return the grizzly bear in Greater Yellowstone to the Endangered Species Act &quot;was not based on science or facts&quot; but motivated by plaintiffs&#x27; &quot;intent on destroying our Western way of life&quot;. Her statements drew comments from indigenous tribal nations and environmentalists. Tribal nations hold the grizzly sacred, and environmentalists have voiced concerns about trophy hunts, livestock and logging interests, and the gas, coal, and oil extraction industries.

Cheney condemned the Turkish invasion of the Kurdish areas in Syria, which was made possible by Trump&#x27;s decision to withdraw U.S. military forces that served as a buffer between Turkey and the Kurdish areas in Syria, saying, &quot;The U.S. is abandoning our ally the Kurds, who fought ISIS on the ground and helped protect the U.S. homeland. This decision aids America&#x27;s adversaries, Russia, Iran, and Turkey, and paves the way for a resurgence of ISIS.&quot; Cheney partly blamed the Democratic Party and the impeachment inquiry into Trump for Turkey&#x27;s actions, saying, &quot;It was not an accident that the Turks chose this moment to roll across the border.&quot; A spokesperson for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Cheney&#x27;s claim about the impact of U.S. presidential impeachment proceedings on the invasion &quot;delusional&quot;.

At a House Republican Conference in July 2020, some Republicans, including Jim Jordan of Ohio and Andy Biggs of Arizona, criticized Cheney for defending Dr. Fauci amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and for previously endorsing Kentucky Congressman Thomas Massie&#x27;s primary opponent.
In September 2020, Cheney asked the Justice Department to investigate environmental groups such as the NRDC, Sea Change, and the Sierra Club, saying that &quot;robust political and judicial activismcombined with the fact that these groups often espouse views that align with those of our adversariesmakes it all the more critical that the Department is aware of any potential foreign influence within or targeting these groups. I urge the Department to investigate Chinese and Russian attempts to influence environmental and energy policy in the United States&quot;.

Beginning during his time as a Dublin, California city councilman, Eric Swalwell was targeted by a Chinese woman believed to be an undercover officer of China&#x27;s Ministry of State Security. Swalwell&#x27;s general relationship with a suspected Chinese agent has been characterized as problematic, particularly given his high-profile role as a member of the House Intelligence Committee. Cheney signed a letter demanding Swalwell&#x27;s removal from the House Intelligence Committee. She also said, &quot;the extent to which [the Chinese Communist Party] caused COVID-19] to be spread around the world has really shone a spotlight on the nature of that regime, and has really focused the attention of not just people in the United States but our allies around the world on the threat that they pose and how important it is we protect ourselves by moving supply chains, by ending our dependence on the Chinese government&quot;.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, Cheney voted against the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, but for the PPP Extension Act.

====Voting record====
From 2017 to 2021, Cheney voted in line with Trump&#x27;s position around 93% of the time, supporting him more consistently in House votes than many House Republican members, even his former chief of staff Mark Meadows. In 2019, according to the &quot;New York Times,&quot; Cheney publicly feuded with Rand Paul over who was &quot;Trumpier&quot;. According to &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, she was a &quot;loyal Trumpist&quot; and helped build &quot;the party of Trump&quot; at that time.

====First and second impeachments of Donald Trump====

Cheney voted against impeaching Trump on both articles during Trump&#x27;s first impeachment on December 18, 2019. On January 12, 2021, following the January 6 United States Capitol attack during the certification process for President-elect Joe Biden, Cheney said during Trump&#x27;s second impeachment that she would vote to impeach Trump for his role in inciting the attack. Cheney said that Trump &quot;lit the flame&quot; of the riot and did nothing to stop it. Saying, &quot;there has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath&quot;, she supported impeachment. Nine other Republicans joined her in doing so on January 13. She was then the third-ranking Republican in the House. Jim Jordan (one of 139 House members, and 8 senators, who voted for — or supported — the objections to the Electoral College count) called for her removal from Republican Party leadership. Andy Biggs took offense specifically with the wording of Cheney&#x27;s remark, saying: &quot;She puts out a statement saying that what this president did is maybe one of the most heinous things in the history of the US presidency. Her words were used over and over again when the Democrats were making their speeches on the floor of the House. And they will be used again when the Senate opens up another bogus trial in the Senate. That is what the problem is.&quot;

Former president George W. Bush&#x27;s spokesman said on January 30 that Bush supported Cheney&#x27;s actions and intended to call his former vice president, Dick Cheney, to &quot;thank him for his daughter&#x27;s service&quot;. Days later, Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell said, &quot;Liz Cheney is a leader with deep convictions and the courage to act on them. She is an important leader in our party and in our nation. I am grateful for her service and look forward to continuing to work with her on the crucial issues facing our nation&quot;. McConnell also condemned Trump supporters&#x27; &quot;loony lies&quot;. Senator Lindsey Graham said Cheney &quot;is one of the strongest and most reliable conservative voices in the Republican Party. She is a fiscal and social conservative, and no one works harder to ensure that our military is well prepared&quot;.

Trump supporters were angered by Cheney&#x27;s vote to impeach. On February 3, 2021, the House Republican Conference held a closed-door, secret-ballot vote on whether to remove her from her position in the Republican House leadership. She held her position by a 145–61 vote, with one member voting present. After the vote, Cheney said, &quot;we&#x27;re not going to be divided and that we&#x27;re not going to be in a situation where people can pick off any member of leadership&quot;. On February 6, the Wyoming Republican Party censured Cheney for her vote to impeach Trump. Cheney responded, &quot;My vote to impeach was compelled by the oath I swore to the Constitution. Wyoming citizens know that this oath does not bend or yield to politics or partisanship. I will always fight for Wyoming values and stand up for our Western way of life.&quot; She rejected the Wyoming party&#x27;s demands that she step down and noted the censure incorrectly asserted that the Capitol attack was instigated by antifa and Black Lives Matter.

Cheney raised the possibility of a criminal investigation of Trump for provoking violence and said he &quot;does not have a role as a leader of our party going forward&quot;. In April 2021, she said she would not vote for him if he were the Republican nominee for president in 2024. In May 2021, she said: &quot;I will do everything I can to ensure that [Trump] never again gets anywhere near the Oval Office&quot; and &quot;we cannot let the former president drag us backward and make us complicit in his efforts to unravel our democracy.&quot;

In his first speech since the Capitol attack, Trump attacked the Bush administration for launching the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, and described Liz Cheney as a &quot;warmonger&quot; and &quot;a person that loves seeing our troops fighting&quot; for her support for the Bush administration&#x27;s foreign policy.

In March 2021 former Republican speaker Paul Ryan stated his support for Cheney. &quot;Salon&quot; wrote that although Cheney is &quot;arch-conservative&quot;, she is &quot;now considered too liberal for some GOP extremists&quot;. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan said &quot;Liz Cheney is a solid conservative Republican&quot; who &quot;just stood up and told the truth&quot; in May 2021.

In March 2022, in an interview on Meet The Press, Cheney said she didn&#x27;t regret her vote against impeaching Trump during his first impeachment for his role in the Trump–Ukraine scandal, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

===Removal as conference chair===
In response to rising calls from House Republicans for her to be removed from her position as House Republican Conference chair after her ongoing criticism of Trump, Cheney wrote an opinion article, &quot;The GOP is at a turning point. History is watching us&quot;, published in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; on May 5, 2021. In it, she reiterated her positions on adhering to the principles of the U.S. Constitution, upholding the law, and defending &quot;the basic principles that underpin and protect our freedom and our democratic process&quot;. Senator Joni Ernst criticized the GOP&#x27;s efforts to remove Cheney from party leadership, comparing it to cancel culture.

On the eve of a House Republican vote to remove her, Cheney made after her colleagues had left the chamber, saying in part:
Today we face a threat America has never seen before. A former president, who provoked a violent attack on this Capitol in an effort to steal the election, has resumed his aggressive effort to convince Americans that the election was stolen from him. He risks inciting further violence. Millions of Americans have been misled by the former president. They have heard only his words, but not the truth, as he continues to undermine our democratic process, sowing seeds of doubt about whether democracy really works at all. I am a conservative Republican and the most conservative of conservative principles is reverence for the rule of law. The Electoral College has voted. More than sixty state and federal courts, including multiple judges he appointed, have rejected the former president&#x27;s claims. The Department of Justice in his administration investigated the former president&#x27;s claims of widespread fraud and found no evidence to support them. The election is over. That is the rule of law. That is our constitutional process. Those who refuse to accept the rulings of our courts are at war with the Constitution.

Cheney was formally removed by voice vote at a closed-door House Republican Conference meeting on May 12, 2021, and was replaced by Elise Stefanik. Five GOP representatives requested a recorded vote, but McCarthy chose to decide the matter by voice vote. As it was a voice vote conducted behind closed doors, it was unclear which lawmakers supported her ouster.

After her battles with Republican leadership, Cheney spent $58,000 on a private security detail.

=== United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack ===

On July 1, 2021, Cheney was appointed by House speaker Nancy Pelosi to the United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack. Cheney served as vice chair of the committee.

While addressing the committee in June 2022, Cheney &quot;offered a stark message to members of her party who continue to support former president Donald Trump and downplay the events of Jan. 6. &#x27;Tonight, I say this to my Republican colleagues who are defending the indefensible: There will come a day when Donald Trump is gone, but your dishonor will remain&#x27;, she said&quot;.

On January 20, 2025, just hours before he left office, President Biden preemptively pardoned the January 6th Committee members in an extraordinary use of executive power against future prosecution. The President said that &quot;the issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that any individual engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense. Our nation owes these public servants a debt of gratitude for their tireless commitment to our country.&quot; On January 2, 2025, citing her work on the committee and record of public service, Cheney was awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal by Biden, who described Cheney and fellow recipient Bennie Thompson as &quot;elected officials who served in difficult times with honor, decency, and ensure our democracy delivers&quot;.

=== Removal from Wyoming Republican Party ===
On November 13, 2021, the Wyoming GOP Central Committee voted 31–29 to no longer recognize Cheney as a member of the party. The resolution reiterated the general complaint for which it had censured her the previous February, saying that Cheney had never provided &quot;quantifiable and or undisputed evidence&quot; for why she had voted in favor of impeachment. There had been similar votes by two Wyoming counties three months earlier to remove her from the party.

===Censure by Republican National Committee===
On February 4, 2022, the Republican National Committee called the events of January 6, 2021 &quot;legitimate political discourse&quot; and overwhelmingly voted to censure Cheney and Representative Adam Kinzinger by voice vote for taking part in the House investigation of the Capitol assault.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Armed Services
** Subcommittee on Intelligence and Special Operations
** Subcommittee on Strategic Forces
* United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack (Vice Chair)

=== Caucus memberships ===
* Congressional Western Caucus

==Political positions==
Cheney has described herself as a conservative Republican. Lawrence R. Jacobs has said, &quot;Cheney is an arch-conservative. She&#x27;s a hard-edged, small government, lower taxes figure and a leading voice on national defense.&quot; Jake Bernstein argued that &quot;Liz Cheney is a true conservative in every sense of the word and she&#x27;s only a moderate in relation to the radicalism that has seized the Republican party.&quot; &quot;Politico&quot; called her the &quot;face of the anti-Trump GOP and a relic of the Republican Party before the dominance of Trump.&quot;

Cheney has several times been described as &quot;Republican royalty&quot;. &quot;The National Interest&quot; called her the &quot;heiress to a neoconservative throne&quot;. &quot;Salon&quot; called her &quot;arch-conservative&quot;. The Brookings Institution argued that Cheney has a long-term strategy to become the leader of the Republican Party in the post-Trump era, and that &quot;she&#x27;s a real conservative—Democrats who like her opposition to Trump will never like her politics.&quot;

Conservative Republican John Bolton has described Cheney as &quot;a person of integrity and character&quot; who is involved in politics for philosophical reasons rather than self-interest, and who shares the determination of her father.

===Continuing opposition to Donald Trump===
In May 2021, Cheney said that she intended to be &quot;the leader, one of the leaders, in a fight to help to restore our party&quot;. 
Following her primary defeat in August 2022, Cheney filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission creating a leadership political action committee (PAC) named The Great Task. The PAC&#x27;s name comes from the Gettysburg Address: Lincoln spoke of the &quot;great task remaining before us&quot;. In September 2022, Cheney stated &quot;if [Donald Trump] is the nominee, I won&#x27;t be a Republican.&quot; The following May, The Great Task ran an ad in New Hampshire advising Republican primary voters not to support Trump&#x27;s 2024 presidential campaign. As recently as June 2023, Cheney declined to rule out a presidential bid in 2024.

Beginning in 2021, Cheney repeatedly expressed an openness to potentially running for president in 2024. On September 4, 2024, Cheney told a group of students at Duke University that she would be voting for Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, stating that, &quot;As a conservative and someone who believes in and cares about the Constitution ... I will be voting for Kamala Harris.”

During the 2022 midterm elections, Cheney said she would campaign against Republican candidates who denied or questioned the results of the 2020 presidential election. Her political action committee, the Great Task, ran TV ads imploring Republican voters in Arizona to vote against Kari Lake and Mark Finchem, the Republican nominees for governor and secretary of state, respectively. (Both lost.) In October 2022, she endorsed Democratic congresswoman Elissa Slotkin for reelection over Republican nominee Tom Barrett, a Michigan state senator who questioned the results of the 2020 election. According to Cheney, her endorsement of Slotkin was her first ever of a Democrat. Cheney also expressed support for Ohio Democrat Tim Ryan in his U.S. Senate campaign against Republican JD Vance; Vance supported false claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. Cheney also endorsed Democratic congresswomen Abigail Spanberger over her Republican opponent, Yesli Vega, who Cheney said promoted conspiracy theories.

On December 5, 2023, Cheney released a memoir, titled &quot;Oath and Honor: A Memoir and a Warning&quot;, in which she recounted her experience before, during, and after January 6, as well as her time serving as Vice Chair of the January 6th Committee, and admonished many of her Republican colleagues, including former House speaker Kevin McCarthy and current speaker Mike Johnson. The book quickly sold out and became a bestseller.

In a speech at the Democracy Summit at Dartmouth College on January 5, Cheney urged voters to reject Donald Trump as the Republican presidential nominee in the 2024 election, saying, &quot;Show the world that we will defeat the plague of cowardice sweeping through the Republican Party.&quot; The next day, Cheney posted a tweet, criticizing comments by Trump on the American Civil War, in which he said, &quot;I&#x27;m so attracted to seeing it, so many mistakes were made...There was something that could&#x27;ve been negotiated.&quot; Cheney wrote, &quot;Question for members of the GOP—the party of Lincoln—who have endorsed Donald Trump: How can you possibly defend this?&quot;

On April 22, 2024, Cheney published an essay in &quot;The New York Times&quot; urging the Supreme Court of the United States to quickly decide on presidential immunity to allow the legal proceedings of former President Trump to overturn the 2020 election to proceed in a timely manner.

In September 2024, Cheney said in an interview with Madison, Wisconsin&#x27;s &quot;The Capital Times&quot; that Trump has &quot;so corrupted&quot; the Republican Party during his nine years there that it&#x27;s causing the Republican Party to die and possibly become unsalvageable and that traditional conservatives such as herself may have to start a new conservative party to revive pre-Trump style conservatism.

===Drug legislation===
Cheney has supported bills to further restrict opioids in the face of the opioid epidemic. She voted against the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act of 2019/2020 (H.R. 3884), which, among other things, would have removed cannabis from the list of scheduled substances regulated by the Controlled Substances Act and establish a process to expunge criminal convictions for cannabis.

=== Foreign policy ===
Cheney has largely been considered a neoconservative and an interventionist. She opposed proposals to withdraw from Afghanistan. Cheney has criticized what she has called the &quot;Putin wing&quot; of the Republican Party.

When working in the United States Department of State as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, Cheney supported the Iraq War, as promoted by her father, Dick Cheney.

According to &quot;Mother Jones&quot;, Cheney insists &quot;that one of the main lies of the Bush-Cheney fraudulent case for war—that there had been a significant connection between al-Qaeda and Iraq—was true.&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist Maureen Dowd has commented that Cheney used &quot;her patronage perch in the State Department during the Bush-Cheney years ... [and] bolstered her father&#x27;s trumped-up case for an invasion of Iraq&quot; while cheering &quot;on her dad as he spread fear, propaganda and warped intelligence&quot;.

Cheney is a strong supporter of Israel and has expressed support for Israeli plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank. She signed a letter to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu that reaffirms &quot;the unshakeable alliance between the United States and Israel&quot;.

In 2015, Cheney and her father expressed opposition to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, saying that it would &quot;lead to a nuclear-armed Iran&quot;. On June 21, 2019, after Trump called off military strikes against Iran for allegedly downing an American drone, Cheney compared Trump not attacking Iran to Barack Obama not attacking Syria in 2013. On September 18, 2019, she called for the United States to consider a &quot;proportional military response&quot; against Iran after it was attacking oil bases in the Saudi regions of Abqaiq and Khurais.

On June 17, 2021, Cheney was one of 160 House Republicans to vote against repealing the 2002 AUMF, which granted the Bush administration the authority to wage war with Iraq. She said that repealing the resolution &quot;would send a message of weakness to our adversaries and allies alike&quot;.

=== Military ===
Cheney opposes the no-first-use nuclear policy. After the second round of the 2020 Democratic Party presidential debates, Cheney criticized Elizabeth Warren when she advocated the policy. Cheney voted to include provisions to draft women in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2022.

Cheney has supported the use of torture. In 2009, she defended the use of waterboarding during the George W. Bush administration, comparing it to SERE training. In 2014, she criticized President Barack Obama after he said, &quot;we tortured some folks&quot;. Also that year, she criticized Nancy Pelosi for calling out her father for his support of using torture.

In 2018, when U.S. senator John McCain criticized CIA director nominee Gina Haspel, Cheney again defended the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques, saying that they &quot;saved lives, prevented attacks, and produced intel that led to Osama bin Laden&quot;. Cheney&#x27;s remarks were criticized by Meghan McCain, who responded that her father—who was tortured as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War—&quot;doesn&#x27;t need torture explained to him&quot;.

On September 26, 2021, during an interview with Lesley Stahl on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, Cheney reaffirmed her support for waterboarding, saying that it is not torture.

=== January 6 commission ===
Cheney was one of 35 Republicans who joined all Democrats in voting to approve legislation to establish the January 6 commission meant to investigate the storming of the U.S. Capitol. Before the vote, she was one of few Republican lawmakers who openly expressed support for the commission.

On October 21, 2021, Cheney was one of nine House Republicans who voted to hold Steve Bannon in contempt of Congress.

===Same-sex marriage===
In 2013, during her Senate bid, Cheney voiced her opposition to same-sex marriage. This caused a public falling-out with her sister, Mary Cheney, who is gay and wrote in a Facebook post, &quot;Either [y]ou think all families should be treated equally or you don&#x27;t. Liz&#x27;s position is to treat my family as second class citizens.&quot; Mary declared she would not support Liz&#x27;s 2014 Senate candidacy. The family spat becoming a focus of media attention was cited as one of the reasons Cheney ended her Senate campaign.

On September 26, 2021, during an interview with Lesley Stahl on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, Cheney expressed regret for not supporting same-sex marriage. She was one of 47 Republicans to vote for the Respect for Marriage Act of 2022, which would codify same-sex marriage into federal law, and passed the House, 267–157.

===Contraception===
In 2022, Cheney voted for H.R. 8373 (&quot;The Right to Contraception Act&quot;), a bill designed to protect access to contraceptives and health care providers&#x27; ability to provide contraceptives and information about contraception.

===Abortion===
Cheney, stating she had, &quot;always been strongly pro-life&quot; spoke in praise of the Supreme Court&#x27;s overturn of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; as part of their &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; ruling. Cheney&#x27;s opposition to abortion has earned her a 0% approval rating from the Planned Parenthood action fund, and a 93% approval rating from the National Right to Life Committee.

===Conspiracy theories===
Bud Goodall in 2010 called Cheney a &quot;conspiracy propagandist&quot;.

In 2009, Cheney refused to denounce adherents of Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories (birtherism) on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, saying that the birtherism movement existed because &quot;people are uncomfortable with a president who is reluctant to defend the nation overseas&quot;. According to &quot;Mother Jones&quot;, the Obama citizenship conspiracy theory was an &quot;odious lie that Liz Cheney also defended&quot;. In 2009, Cheney gave the keynote address at a dinner hosted by the Center for Security Policy, an anti-Muslim think tank deemed a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center and known for promoting the false claim that Obama is a Muslim.

Cheney has denounced the far-right conspiracy theory QAnon, saying, &quot;QAnon is a dangerous lunacy that should have no place in American politics&quot;.

===2024 United States elections===
On September 4, 2024, Liz Cheney announced at Duke University that she is supporting Kamala Harris for president. &quot;And as a conservative, as someone who believes in and cares about the Constitution, I have thought deeply about this, and because of the danger that Donald Trump poses, not only am I not voting for Donald Trump, but I will be voting for Kamala Harris&quot; she said. On September 6, 2024, her father Dick Cheney announced that he is supporting Kamala Harris and the Democratic ticket for president of the United States and that Trump is a &quot;threat to our republic&quot; and a &quot;coward&quot; and that &quot;he tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him.&quot; In response, Donald Trump texted on his Trump Social platform that &quot;Dick Cheney is an irrelevant RINO, along with his daughter&quot;.

At an Arizona rally on November 1, 2024, Trump called Cheney a &quot;war hawk&quot; and said &quot;Let&#x27;s put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her. OK? Let&#x27;s see how she feels about it, you know when the guns are trained on her face. They&#x27;re all war hawks when they&#x27;re sitting in Washington in a nice building saying, &#x27;Oh, gee, well let&#x27;s send 10,000 troops right into the mouth of the enemy.&#x27;&quot; Cheney responded by saying, &quot;This is how dictators destroy free nations. They threaten those who speak against them with death.&quot; Following Trump&#x27;s remarks, Kris Mayes, the Arizona Attorney General, launched an investigation into whether Trump&#x27;s statement qualified as a prosecutable death threat under Arizona law.

Kamala Harris&#x27; campaign welcomed Cheney&#x27;s support, a move criticized by Ilhan Omar, &quot;The Nation&quot;, and &quot;Newsweek&quot; as ineffective due to her bipartisan unpopularity.

==Awards and recognition==
Cheney was selected for the inaugural 2021 &quot;Forbes&quot; 50 Over 50, a list of notable entrepreneurs, leaders, scientists, and creators older than age 50. She was also included in the 2021 &quot;Time&quot; 100, &quot;Time&quot;″s annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world.

On April 22, 2022, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation named Cheney a Profile in Courage Award recipient for &quot;defending democracy&quot;. The foundation said that Cheney had been a &quot;consistent and courageous voice in defense of democracy&quot; and that she had &quot;refused to take the politically expedient course that most of her party embraced.&quot; The award was presented in person on May 22.

Cheney was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws from Dartmouth College in June 9, 2024.

On January 2, 2025, Cheney was awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal by President Joe Biden, who described Cheney and fellow recipient Bennie Thompson as &quot;elected officials who served in difficult times with honor, decency, and ensure our democracy delivers&quot;.

She was nominated for the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize for &quot;her defense of freedom and democracy,&quot; along with the other members of the January 6th Committee.

== Personal life ==
Cheney is a United Methodist. She is married to Philip Perry, a partner at Latham &amp; Watkins. They were married in Wyoming in 1993. They have five children. In 2012, Cheney moved to Wyoming.

<text>The Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame (PWHF) and Museum was an American professional wrestling hall of fame and museum located in Wichita Falls, Texas; following the postponement of its 19th induction ceremony, planned for May 2020, and an announced temporary closure to expand the museum, its status was changed to &quot;closed due to water leaks&quot; in 2021, and never re-opened.

The museum was founded by Tony Vellano in 1999, and was previously in Amsterdam, New York and Schenectady, New York. Its purpose was to &quot;preserve and promote the dignified history of professional wrestling and to enshrine and pay tribute to professional wrestlers who have advanced this national pastime in terms of athletics and entertainment.&quot; It was not affiliated with any professional wrestling promotion.

<doc id="1320370" wikidata="Q6475029" url="?curid=1320370" title="Lake Bomoseen">
<text>Lake Bomoseen ( ) is a freshwater lake in the western part of the U.S. state of Vermont in the towns of Castleton and Hubbardton in Rutland County. It is the largest lake that lies entirely within the state&#x27;s boundaries, with a surface area of approximately . The lake was formed by glaciation and has an average and maximum depth of and , respectively. It drains a watershed, has five major inlets, and empties to the Castleton River, a tributary of the Poultney River, which in turn flows west to East Bay at the southern end of Lake Champlain.

Bomoseen State Park occupies a portion of the lake&#x27;s western shoreline. Most of the remaining area around the lake is privately owned. The lake has such recreational accommodations as a public beach, marinas, and public boat launches, in addition to the state park. There are approximately 1,000 residences around the lake, as well as restaurants and other commercial facilities.

==History==

Millions of years ago, clays that accumulated on the ocean floor compressed into shale. When the ocean floor uplifted to form the Taconic Mountains, heat and pressure metamorphosed the shale into much harder slate. Lake Bomoseen nestles in a valley surrounded by some of the lower hills on the western side of the range. The Taconics are the slate-producing region of Vermont, and the area&#x27;s history parallels the rise and fall of Vermont&#x27;s slate industry.

Bomoseen State Park has several quarry holes and adjacent colorful slate rubble piles. These quarries provided slate for the West Castleton Railroad and Slate Company, a complex of sixty to seventy buildings that stood between Glen Lake and Lake Bomoseen. Several slate buildings and foundations remain in the park, and a self-guided Slate History Trail brochure is available at the contact station.

In the 1920s, literary critic Alexander Woollcott owned Neshobe Island, which served as a retreat and playground for members of the Algonquin Round Table. Visitors from that group included Harpo Marx. Wollcott created another group called the Neshobe Island Club. This group of visitors included Laurence Olivier, Helen Hayes, Vivien Leigh, Ring Lardner, Dorothy Parker, Noël Coward, Thornton Wilder, and Walt Disney.

==Activities at Lake Bomoseen==

*Boating, water skiing, wakeboarding, scuba diving, wind surfing, swimming, fishing, camping, and hunting
*Ice fishing and cross country skiing in winter
*Crystal Beach: volleyball, swimming, playground, picnicking, basketball
*Bomoseen State Park: camping, swimming, volleyball, hiking
*Fishing: bass, panfish, bullhead, brown trout, yellow perch, smelt, and northern pike
*Prospect Point Golf Club, 9-hole public golf course

==Conservation==

Ospreys were virtually wiped out in Vermont and most of the United States by pesticides decades ago. DDT got into the food chain, and osprey populations plummeted as the chemical made their eggshells thin and brittle. Central Vermont Public Service has worked on osprey restoration efforts with the state for over 15 years, installing platforms at hydroelectric facilities, creating buffer zones and educating Vermonters on the birds&#x27; need for space. A platform is under consideration at Lake Bomoseen. There have been occasional osprey sightings on Lake Bomoseen over the last few years.

Bald eagles were also victims of the pesticide use of the 1950s and -60s. In recent years, there has been a bald eagle nesting site on Neshobe Island, in the center of Lake Bomoseen, where the eagles feed on trout, bass and other fish species that are plentiful in the lake.

==Controversy==

Lake Bomoseen has had a long history of invasive weed problems. By the early 1980s, Eurasian watermilfoil (&quot;Myriophyllum spicatum&quot;) was the dominant weed species in the lake. Eurasian watermilfoil is an introduced species that is difficult to control due to its ability to survive in various environmental conditions. At one point the watermilfoil covered of the lake, impairing its recreational and commercial uses.

Researchers from Middlebury College working under contract for the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation introduced a native aquatic weevil (&quot;Euhrychiopsis lecontei&quot;) to help combat the problem. Other treatments such as the aquatic herbicide Sonar have been used at other lakes.

In recent years, zebra mussels have entered Lake Bomoseen after many years of attempted prevention.

<text>Resolute or Resolute Bay () is an Inuit hamlet on Cornwallis Island in Nunavut, Canada. It is at the northern end of Resolute Bay and the Northwest Passage and is part of the Qikiqtaaluk Region.

Resolute is one of Canada&#x27;s northernmost communities and is second only to Grise Fiord on Ellesmere Island (Alert and Eureka are more northerly but are not considered towns; rather, military outposts and weather stations). It is also one of the coldest inhabited places in the world, with an average yearly temperature of . As in most other northern communities, the roads and most of the terrain are all gravel. It is also the closest transit location to Devon Island, the largest uninhabited island in the world, which contains the best-preserved crater on Earth – the Haughton impact crater, formed about 31 million years ago.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Canadian census conducted by Statistics Canada, Resolute had a population of 183 living in 66 of its 89 total private dwellings, a change of − from its 2016 population of 198. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Settlement==

The area shows evidence of being occupied sporadically by the Dorset culture (Tuniit) and later the Thule people from as early as 1500 BCE until 1000 CE. However, modern Inuit did not occupy or use the area until the 1953 High Arctic relocation.

In 1947, Canada and the United States built a weather station, Resolute Weather Station, and an airstrip as part of the Joint Arctic Weather Stations: known today as the High Arctic Weather Stations. This was followed in 1949 by a Royal Canadian Air Force base, RCAF Station Resolute Bay. At that time, the population was made up of military personnel and specialists, such as meteorologists, from the south. Today, the base serves as one of the potential starting points for Arctic research and access to both the North Pole and the north magnetic pole.

Named after the Arctic exploration vessel , the community of Resolute got its start in 1953 as part of the High Arctic relocation. Efforts to assert Canadian sovereignty in the High Arctic during the Cold War, because of the area&#x27;s strategic geopolitical position, led the Government of Canada to forcibly relocate Inuit from Nunavik (northern Quebec) to Resolute (and to Grise Fiord).

The first group of people, which included one Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer, Ross Gibson, who was also to become the community&#x27;s first teacher, were relocated in 1953, along with a second group in 1955, from Inukjuak (then known as Port Harrison), Quebec, and from Pond Inlet, Nunavut (then the Northwest Territories). They were promised homes and game to hunt, but the relocated people discovered no buildings and very little familiar wildlife. They also had to endure weeks of 24-hour darkness during the winter, and 24-hour sunlight during the summer: something that does not occur in northern Quebec.

They were told that they would be returned home after a year if they wished, but this offer was later withdrawn as it would have damaged Canada&#x27;s claims to sovereignty in the area and the Inuit were forced to stay. Eventually, the Inuit learned the local beluga whale migration routes and were able to survive in the area, hunting over a range of each year.

In 1993, the Canadian government held hearings to investigate the relocation program, and the following year the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples issued a report entitled &quot;The High Arctic Relocation: A Report on the 1953–55 Relocation&quot;. The government paid $10 million CAD to the survivors and their families and gave a formal apology in 2008.

The community was originally built from the base but, by the 1970s, the number of research people arriving in Resolute was causing problems. Between 1974 and 1975 the community was moved to a location allowing better municipal services, but poorly-sited for hunting purposes.

Contrary to popular stereotypes, people in this remote community have a low unemployment rate. Most citizens are employed at least part of the year; however, with 2010s changes to American policy toward polar bear hunting, the local economy is at risk as many Inuit cater to American sport hunters seeking polar bear trophies.

==Facilities==
The Tudjaat Co-op, part of the Arctic Co-operatives, runs a grocery/retail store.

The town has two hotels – South Camp Inn, and the Airport Hotel (Narwhal), which are operated by Atco Frontec Ltd – which have fewer than 60 rooms each, and several self contained apartments. The hotels are also equipped with WiFi internet and gym spaces. Other facilities include a Royal Canadian Mounted Police Detachment, a school (which provides education from kindergarten to Grade 12) and a gym. There is also a remote campus of Nunavut Arctic College.

There is the Resolute Bay Health Centre/Nursing Station, staffed by nurses with a doctor visiting several times a year. Patients may be flown to the Qikiqtani General Hospital in Iqaluit or Ottawa.

Unlike a lot of Arctic communities there is only one church, the Resolute Bay Anglican Church.

=== Broadband communications ===

The community has been served by the Qiniq network since 2005. The Qiniq network is designed and operated by SSi Canada. In 2017, the network was upgraded to 4G LTE technology, and 2G-GSM for mobile voice.

=== Military presence ===

On August 8, 2007, CBC News reported that Canadian Armed Forces documents showed plans to build an army training centre in the community along with a $60 million deep water port at Nanisivik to the southeast.

On August 10, 2007, then-Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, announced the construction of a pair of multimillion-dollar military facilities within the contested waters of Canada&#x27;s Arctic territory. The facilities consist of a new army training centre at Resolute, and a deep-sea port at Nanisivik Naval Facility. A statement issued by the Prime Minister said, &quot;The Training Centre will be a year-round multi-purpose facility supporting Arctic training and operations, accommodating up to 100 personnel. Training equipment and vehicles stationed at the site will also provide an increased capability and faster response time in support of regional military or civilian emergency operations.&quot;

On August 16, 2013, the Arctic Training Facility opened in Resolute.

On February 23, 2016, in response to an increase in Russian military presence in the Arctic, it was announced that the military training facility would be expanded. This would include, &quot;more storage, more capacity to get more equipment in, prepositioning more equipment so we don&#x27;t spend a fortune on airlift or chartered aircraft&quot;, said Lieutenant-colonel Luc St-Denis. Incinerators were also said to be proposed to minimize the environmental impact on the area.

=== Government of Canada facilities ===
The government of Canada has several buildings around the community; namely, the Martin Bergmann Complex, named for Martin Bergmann, which houses the Polar Continental Shelf Program from Natural Resources Canada, enabling Arctic Science Research.

The Polar Continental Shelf Project (PCSP), a Government of Canada organization created in 1958. The centre may host up to 40 scientists as a starting location before they go to their field research. The PCSP provides researchers with efficient and safe logistics and, as part of the Arctic policy of Canada, strengthens Canadian sovereignty in the area. It brings together scientists from diverse organizations, including many Geological Survey of Canada researchers, for interdisciplinary studies of the Canadian Arctic.

==Climate==
Resolute has a tundra climate or ET, a polar climate sub-type under the Köppen climate classification, with long cold winters and short cool summers. The average high for the year is while the average low for the year is . Resolute has a very dry climate with an average precipitation of a year, most of it falling as snow from September to November. The record high for Resolute is on July 2, 2012 and the record low for Resolute is on January 7, 1966.

Resolute has never experienced an above-freezing temperature between October 20 and May 6.

Between around April 30 and August 13, Resolute experiences midnight sun; whilst between around November 7 and February 4 there is polar night. Between late November and mid-January, the sun is so low that there is not even civil twilight, with the only exception from complete darkness being a deeper-blue sky called &quot;nautical twilight&quot; at noon, but there is no true experience of 24 hours of pitch black darkness around noon. For about two weeks before and after the midnight sun in Resolute, the nights are still quite bright since it does not get any darker than civil twilight (this is the twilight where surrounding objects are still visible and outdoor activities can go on without the need for artificial lighting). Resolute, however, does not experience night (the phase of day) from about March 14 to September 29.

Resolute does experience thunderstorms during the summer, but they are typically rare in the region.
==Economy==

Besides hunting guides and hotels Resolute has mixed and small sized employers:

* Resolute Bay School
* Hamlet of Resolute Council
* RCMP Resolute Detachment
* Resolute Bay Airport
* Tudjaat Co-op store

==Transportation==
Although not as busy as it once was, Resolute Bay Airport is still the core of the area, serving as an aviation hub for exploration in the region and connected by direct service to Iqaluit. On August 20, 2011, First Air Flight 6560 crashed into a hill while attempting to land at the airport. Of the fifteen people on board, twelve were killed and the remaining three were severely injured.

Within the community, most travel is by snowmobile and walking. Cars are limited. There are no taxis or public transit, but hotels offer shuttle service.

==Notable people==
Joseph Idlout, grandfather of singer Lucie Idlout and father of Leah Idlout, the community&#x27;s second teacher, moved to Resolute in 1955 from Pond Inlet. Idlout, an Inuk hunter who was the subject of two National Film Board of Canada documentaries: &quot;Land of the Long Day&quot;, filmed in 1952 in Pond Inlet, and &quot;Between Two Worlds&quot; in 1990. He was for a time one of the most well-known Inuit and was shown on the back of the Canadian two-dollar bill. Celina Kalluk, notable performer of Inuit throat singing and children&#x27;s author, was born here.

==Racing==
Resolute is the starting point for both the Polar Race and the Polar Challenge, in which teams race the to the north magnetic pole.

In 2007, the British television show &quot;Top Gear&quot; aired the Top Gear: Polar Special, which embarked from Resolute. The show was framed as a race to the north magnetic pole between hosts Jeremy Clarkson and James May driving a 2007 Toyota Hilux 3.0 litre diesel versus a team of sled dogs driven by American explorer Matty McNair with host Richard Hammond riding along. Clarkson and May successfully reached their destination, becoming the first in history to drive to the north magnetic pole; Hammond and McNair did not finish.

<doc id="1320415" wikidata="Q1437095" url="?curid=1320415" title="Fore people">
<text>The Fore () people live in the Okapa District of the Eastern Highlands Province, Papua New Guinea. There are approximately 20,000 Fore who are separated by the Wanevinti Mountains into the North Fore and South Fore regions. Their main form of subsistence is slash-and-burn farming. The Fore language has three distinct dialects and is the southernmost member of the East Central Family, East New Guinea Highlands Stock, Trans–New Guinea phylum of Papuan languages.

In the 1950s the neurological disease kuru was discovered in the South Fore. The local tradition of ritual cannibalism of their dead had led to an epidemic, with approximately 2,700 deaths from 1957 to 2005.

==History==
Until the 1950s, the Fore people had minimal direct contact with outsiders who were at the time colonizing Papua New Guinea. A small number of prospectors crossed through their territory in the 1930s and at least one plane crashed there during World War II. New diseases such as influenza reached them before significant contact with colonial people occurred.

In the late 1940s, colonial government patrols reached further and further into Fore territory. The patrol officers, called kiaps by the Fore, tried to conduct a census in each village they passed through and lectured the villagers on the importance of hygiene and road construction. They encouraged the people to give up village warfare, traditional beliefs and cannibalism as well. These officers attempted to recruit local &#x27;big men&#x27; to represent the colonial authorities as headmen (&quot;luluais&quot;) or as deputies (&quot;tultuls&quot;).

In 1951, a police post was set up at Okapa (then known as Moke) among the North Fore. A patrol officer, John R. McArthur, was stationed there from 1954 when the &quot;rough track&quot; from Kainantu opened to traffic. Transportation in the region improved to such a degree that it was possible to drive a Land Rover or motorbike to Purosa among the South Fore by 1957. At this time, colonial authorities estimated that there were at least 12,000 Fore living in the region.

In addition to government officers, other outsiders began to enter Fore territory. Anthropologists Ronald and Catherine Berndt spent time with the North Fore in 1953, while missionaries and traders penetrated further south. The Fore underwent considerable cultural change as a result of this contact: they traded with the outsiders, began growing coffee, and started to adopt a money-based economy. Gordon T. Linsley, a patrol officer stationed at Okapa, noted the rapid pace of social change among the Fore in a 1951 report. He observed that village warfare had declined considerably, the young Fore men seemingly glad to have an excuse to quit fighting. The region was already under the control of the Australian government and some villages were relocating from the high ridges down to their gardens. Rest houses were present in the larger villages and separate men&#x27;s houses remained only in the more isolated villages. Many people regularly used the &#x27;rough track&#x27; to travel to Kainantu and were able to see the latest fashions and hear Pidgin spoken. Broad paths linked communities together; however, Linsley noted inter-district fighting persisted and accusations of sorcery were still common in Purosa.

== Geography ==

The Fore people live in the Okapa District: a mountainous region in south-eastern Papua New Guinea. Combined, the 20,000 members of the North and South Fore live on approximately 400 square miles of land, almost all of which is steep mountain. Of these 400 square miles, the majority belongs to the region belonging to the South Fore, who make up the majority of the population. In this mountainous region, there is an average of over 90 inches of rainfall per year, much of which falls in the &quot;rainy season&quot;, lasting from December to March.

Much of the landscape the Fore reside on is untouched forest. Areas of grassland or clearings in the forest appear only in locations of present or past agricultural cultivation. The settlements of the Fore people, usually consisting of a cluster of larger buildings, occur near tracts of land cleared for cultivation, and are frequently demolished and rebuilt elsewhere as new land is acquired for cultivation. These reside almost exclusively on mountainsides, with the majority of Fore hamlets being established between 4,500 and 7,000 ft above sea level (compared to valleys which descend close to 1,000 ft above sea level). The Lamari and Yani rivers are the two largest in the Fore region. Both are tributaries to the larger Purari river to the south.

== Language ==
The Fore language is spoken in the Okapa District in the Eastern Highlands Province of Papua New Guinea. It is part of the East New Guinea Highlands Stock, and the Trans-New Guinea Phylum. It is spoken in three dialects: Northern (which is the prestige dialect), Central, and Southern.

== Diet ==
The Fore diet consists of pigs, small animals, insects, wild plants, and root vegetables such as taro. Root vegetables are cultivated on land cleared by slash-and-burn farming. After the introduction of the sweet potato roughly 150 years ago, food production increased, as the crop could be grown in harsher conditions than existing root vegetables. Around the same time, the Fore began domesticating pigs, replacing the need to hunt wild ones. The sweet potato not only became a staple food, but was used as feed for domesticated pigs.

In their analysis of a 1957 study, Hamilton-Reid and Gajdusek determined that the Fore people have an unusually rich and varied diet especially when compared to other civilizations in the New Guinea highland regions. In addition to growing sweet potato, ebia, sugarcane, and pitpit in their large and productive gardens, the Fore supplement their diet with pigs, rodents, and adult insects. The quality of their diet is so high that, in the 1957 study, no evidence of clinical malnutrition was found in the general population despite lacking access to any modern nutritional or medical services.

== Societal structure ==
There is very little hierarchical structure in Fore society; there are no clear chiefs and no strict hierarchy of power. Women are generally considered inferior to men, but age and gender are not necessarily an aspect of the power structure; the only distinction made is between children and adults.

Fore society is traditionally organized into kinship groups, although these groups are not always strictly familial. A kinship group is made up of a male lineage, but may include other members, such as refugees or distant relatives, that migrated from other Fore kinship groups and became fully integrated into the group, taking on the same privileges and responsibilities as the biologically related members. Men from the same patriarchal lineage are not accorded any benefits over other non-related men in the group; in fact, it is considered beneficial and a strength to the village to bring in men from other kinship groups by offering them land to integrate them.

Generally, each kinship group lives in a village with several small offshoots, each consisting of a single house for the men and boys and several small surrounding houses for the women and children. These hamlets are established when gardening land surrounding the current settlement is exhausted and it is necessary to move outwards and clear more areas of woodland for growing crops. Each cluster of villages and hamlets consists of 50–400 people, with an average of 185.

Land is passed down through the male lineage; Fore culture is heavily patrilineal. Boys marry and remain on the land on which their fathers lived. Daughters of one clan typically marry into many different clans, but these marriage alliances often do not last long. Conflict often arises over unused land for expansion of farming and grazing, and villages or kinship groups will often band together to defend territory. Generally, these battles are fought with bows and arrows as the primary weapon. Settlements are temporary; a group will flee when they lose a battle over their land and will take refuge with other groups of friends or relatives.

Males born at the same time or in the same childbirth hut are considered agemates, or Nagaiya. Throughout his lifetime, a man&#x27;s Nagaiya remains a significant part of his life; for example, agemates will hunt and battle together. The ties among Nagaiya are considered as strong as family ties.

=== Nagaiya ===
Nagaiya, or age mates, are individuals bonded together for life in a manner similar to siblings, though not necessarily blood relations. Two individuals can become nagaiya if they are born at the same time or if their mothers are isolated in the birthing hut at the same time. Boys have a second opportunity to become nagaiya if they go through the manhood initiation ceremony together. (This ceremony consists of living isolated in the forest for a month, receiving a new name, getting piercings, and playing music with sacred flutes.) Women can become nagaiya, but it is not as important for them as it is for men.

Nagaiyas help each other through difficult and dangerous times such as hunting in dangerous forests. During times of war, they are expected to help by giving food and lodging. Sometimes, if there is a conflict between a husband and his wife, the nagaiya will help resolve it. The husband and his nagaiya will slather themselves in mud and ash (symbols of mourning), hit the wife, and consume one of her pigs and one of her sweet potato gardens. To express her displeasure at her husband&#x27;s actions, the wife will hold a banquet with the women in the clan near her husband&#x27;s meal. Later, after the wife gives her husband a small reparation, the conflict between them will be resolved.

Nagaiyas provide support when normal kinsmen would not be able to. For example, when a man consummates his marriage, he does not tell his kinsmen as to do so would be shameful (admitting that he is contaminated from sexual contact with a woman). However, he can freely tell his nagaiya without shame as his nagaiya are obligated to share the burden with him. Additionally, when his wife first menstruates (as menstruation is thought to be dangerous to men), a man stops eating pork, rats, possums, and spinach-like vegetables until his wife gives birth to his first child (to protect himself). The nagaiyas share these diet restrictions in order to show their support.

When a man dies, his nagaiya are obligated to attend his funeral where his family will give them &quot;anonkaiyambu&quot; or &quot;head pay&quot;. The nagaiya are then duty bound to avenge the death of their age mate. Thus, elderly men whose nagaiya are all dead fear that they will be killed by an enemy sorcerer as there is no one left to avenge them. After a man&#x27;s death, his nagaiya and brothers become potential husbands for the widowed wife (the wife decides who she will marry). This creates stress on the relationship between a wife and her husband&#x27;s nagaiya, as the nagaiyas are both friends and potential husbands.

The bond between nagaiya is extremely close. Sometimes younger men jokingly use the term nagaiya to describe elders with which they have a very close bond. Due to this bond, it is a sin punishable by death to abandon or betray one&#x27;s nagaiya.

== Religious beliefs and practices ==
According to traditional Fore beliefs, the land they live in (or &quot;bagina&quot;) is alive, and it created the world. The &quot;bagina&quot; also created the ancestor guardians, &quot;amani&quot;, from which the Fore are descended. The Fore believe a person has five souls: the &quot;auma&quot;, the &quot;ama&quot;, the &quot;aona&quot;, the &quot;yesegi&quot;, and the &quot;kwela&quot;. When a person dies, the Fore conduct mortuary rituals to ensure that each soul reaches its proper destination. Upon death, the &quot;auma&quot;, or good aspects of a person, travels to &quot;kwelanandamundi&quot;, the land of the dead. To help the &quot;auma&quot; reach &quot;kwelanandamundi&quot;, the deceased&#x27;s family members leave food with the body. Two to three days after death, the body may be buried, entombed, or cooked and consumed. If consumed, the deceased&#x27;s &quot;ama&quot; was thought to bless those who ate. The &quot;aona&quot;, or special abilities of a person, passed on to the deceased&#x27;s preferred child, while the &quot;yesegi&quot;, or ancestral power of a person, passed on to all the deceased&#x27;s children. Purification rituals during and after consumption of the body aim to ensure that the &quot;kwela&quot; (or the pollution of a dead body) does not taint those who eat it. Through such rituals, the Fore were assured that the deceased&#x27;s positive aspects remain in the tribe, while the &quot;auma&quot;, &quot;ama&quot;, and &quot;kwela&quot; reach &quot;kwelanandamundi&quot;.

=== Sorcery ===
Another notable aspect of the traditional Fore belief system is a belief in sorcery. The Fore view sorcery as a chaotic force that works to uproot the status quo, though not necessarily as an instrument of evil. It is seen as a source of power and wealth and a valid way to defend against other kinship groups. Battles and migrations among the Fore have often been caused by accusations of sorcery. Problems within a kinship group may be blamed on sorcery, although there is a dichotomy between the North and South Fore in this belief. The North Fore tend to fear attacks from other villages or kinship groups, while among the South Fore the fear is more of sorcery attacks from within family groups, possibly due to bribes given to sorcerers by enemy groups. To protect against attacks by enemy villages, the Fore make an effort to keep outside sorcerers from being able to access leavings or water holes.

Sorcerers within a kinship group were originally seen as defenders of the village, but the kuru epidemic caused this view to shift. Sorcery attacks by insiders were thought to be the cause of the disease. This led to community meetings at which the unknown sorcerers were begged to cease the attacks.

Many Fore people converted to Christianity after contact with missionaries from 1957 onwards, and have denied the efficacy of sorcery.

== Nokoti in folklore ==
&quot;Nokoti&quot; is a forest spirit common in Fore folklore. A nokoti is portrayed as a tall masculine man carrying a small axe or small bag that contains his magical power. A nokoti would live in an isolated mysterious part of the forest, such as an unusual rock formation or misshaped tree. The area in which nokoti live (&quot;ples masalai&quot; in Melanesian) is considered sacred and should not be disturbed. Any person that intrudes would be afflicted with illnesses caused by the Nokoti kionei (Nikoti&#x27;s poison). For example, if a family with a child slept overnight in the ples masalai, the nokoti would steal and hide a lock of the child&#x27;s hair. If the hair was not found, then the child would die from illness. Adults would not die, but their genitalia would become inflamed.

Nokoti were not always harmful—they would bless individuals with superior hunting skills or increased fertility. One common tale of this benevolence recounts the life of a hunter who discovers a unique rock formation while hunting. He climbs to the top and finds a nokoti named Walusubo, sitting on sugar cane leaves. The man asks for Walusubo&#x27;s bag. Walusubo agrees to give him the bag in the future and tells him to eat the sugar leaves in the meantime. He then gives the hunter instructions that vastly improve his hunting abilities. After the hunter dies, his kin return to the rock, but Walusubo has died with the hunter (they were nagaiya). Although the magic bag vanished with the nokoti, the kin gain the strength to vanquish many foes when they eat the sugar leaves on that rock formation. Since then the rock formation is known as &quot;Walusubo Yaba,&quot; or Walusubo&#x27;s stone. 

When Papua New Guinea was colonized, the nokoti changed to become less of a benefactor and more of a criminal. The appearance of nokoti became lankier, sometimes maimed if the nokoti was injured during his earlier crimes. This change in nokoti folklore reflects the shift from the indigenous hunting culture to the capitalist culture of the colonies. One of these new tales tells of a nokoti entering a village and stealing a woman&#x27;s skirt and her shells and beads. He then returns to the forest where he dresses a tree with his stolen clothes. A hunter spots him and returns to the village to collect the other men, but when they return to capture the thief, the nokoti is not there and the stolen traditional valuables cannot be reclaimed. Another tale describes a nokoti who was captured and sent to Australia while robbing a local store. Other tales tell of the nokoti stealing the money that a &quot;kiap&quot; (a patrol officer) was using to pay his employees or attacking huts and members of the patrol.

In modern days, the nokoti is part of the Fore cultural heritage. The government of the Eastern Highlands declared the nokoti a symbol of unity in 1997 and gave it a prominent position in the center of the Eastern Highlands’ flag. The nokoti is now viewed as a mischievous benefactor.

== Precolonial marriage ==
A Fore girl becomes eligible for marriage when she first menstruates. When she marries, she leaves her home with the women to go live with her husband. If her husband is in a different clan, then she must leave all her family and old friends behind (including any nagaiya). During a marriage ceremony, the husband&#x27;s family pays the bride&#x27;s family a marriage fee. This money is thrown on the bride&#x27;s head as &quot;head pay.&quot; Then, the husband and bride attend separate feasts. The groom is often pierced in the nose as piercings are thought to increase a man&#x27;s strength.

== Military and warfare ==
Prior to contact with colonial forces and patrols, the Fore people often engaged in warfare amongst themselves. This warfare occurred between local Fore tribes, usually started by one tribe as a means of retribution or as a preemptive measure to strategically consolidate power in the region. Oftentimes, tribes created alliances with other tribes and were expected to aid their allies in the war effort with food, prayer, and troops. Warfare amongst the Fore led either directly or indirectly to the mortalities of approximately 0.6% of the population, most of whom were younger males.

Despite being consistently engaged in warfare, the Fore were characterized by their tempered disdain for warfare and preference for peace. The Fore predominantly viewed warfare as an undesirable last resort, so they often resolved conflicts peacefully or ended wars at the earliest feasible opportunity.

=== Causes of warfare ===
Warfare amongst the Fore people was almost exclusively initiated by the larger, more powerful Fore clans, such as the &quot;Mugayamuti&quot; and &quot;Ketabe&quot; clans. War was predominantly a means of retaliation over perceived slights or a preemptive measure to ensure dominance in the region. Even wars that began under the guise of retaliation were sometimes strategic in nature; larger clans would call for warfare against smaller groups if they were in desirable trade locations, or in order to increase their might and military numbers. One such example is a war that occurred between the &quot;Weneru&quot; group in the &quot;Wanitabe&quot; clan, which had allied itself with the &quot;Mugayamuti&quot;. After word spread that the &quot;Weneru&quot; had harvested a large amount of &quot;taro&quot;, a vegetable commonly grown in the region, the &quot;Ketabe&quot; ambushed them under the guise of sorcery allegations in order to take this harvest. The &quot;Ketabe&quot; had been afraid that, with the excess of harvest, the &quot;Mugayamuti&quot; would be able to extend their alliances and thus consolidate more power in the region.

Warfare also was commonly initiated as a result of suspicions of acts of sorcery or theft committed by other groups. Physical markings of a sorcery attack included skin-damage, swelling, psychotic behavior, and fainting. If a member of a tribe fell ill and displayed these symptoms, then sorcery was typically suspected. Clans, by default, typically presumed innocence for their own members. Thus, suspects of sorcery and theft were normally members of rival clans.

Since the Fore did not have established mechanisms for jurisprudence, guilt was often determined through the use of rituals. One such ritual was placing hunted animals in bamboo vessels, each vessel representing the name of an accused person or tribe responsible. These vessels would then be put over a fire. After some time upon the fire, the animals would be removed and their livers would then be extracted. A fully cooked liver was considered proof of innocence, and conversely, an uncooked or partially cooked liver was considered conclusive evidence of guilt for the person or group associated with the vessel that contained the incriminating animal.

=== Fore warfare ===
The Fore had not been exposed to firearms and other advanced weaponry prior to colonial contact and thus resorted to archery-based warfare in the form of open-field fighting and ambushes. War was typically initiated after one group, upon determining that war was necessary against another group, exacted a secret raid on the enemy. These raids were normally performed by a small group of skilled warriors, targeting enemy homes, civilians, and gardens. After being attacked, groups typically rounded up the able-bodied men amongst them and met the initiating group in the open field for battle. Coordination of war location and logistics was typically done through messengers carried by &quot;pako&quot;, peaceful envoys who went to enemy territory alone and unarmed. Pako were typically respected older men or women who were visibly incapable of fighting. Often, &quot;pako&quot; had some sort of tie to both groups, and kept tallies of the deaths on both sides. Although the Fore did not have formal written agreements to grant immunity to &quot;pako&quot; messengers, Fore tribes generally respected them and granted them safe passage in and out of their territories.

In open-field battles, quarreling sides met on either side of the field, generally after sunrise. Intimidation tactics such as profuse chanting, singing, dancing, sudden advancements, and yelling profane insults were commonly used. The standard battle formation of a group normally had a defensive front line of men carrying wooden shields to protect themselves and their fellow men from falling arrows. Behind them were men armed with bows and arrows. Shots would be taken sporadically, as arrows were not made in abundance due to the lack of mass-production techniques in Fore society. As a result of this and the capability of fighters to dodge or block incoming arrows, deaths were minimal though common in these battles. In the rare occasion that more than a few people died in one battle, the tribe that suffered those deaths would commonly avenge them with ambush attacks on enemy villages. In the afternoon, fighting normally ended, to be continued after the following sunrise. Fore wars were relatively short, lasting anywhere from a few months to 2–3 years.

=== Peacemaking prior to contact ===
Even prior to colonial contact, the Fore had established rituals for peacemaking between groups that were either at war or in tense relations. These rituals were typically initiated after a &quot;pako&quot; brokered an agreement of peace between the hostile forces, based on the damages exacted by both groups. Pigs were used as remuneration for fatalities, damaged crops, and damaged property. After peace terms were mutually agreed upon, the now-allied groups would hold a ceremony of peace at the battlefield upon which they had fought. At the ceremony, an elderly woman from both sides would place the leaves of a &quot;daka&quot; plant and some sugarcane at the center of the battlefield as gifts for the other group. These plants symbolized calm, coolness, and healing in Fore culture, and thus were often used to indicate times of rejoice and peace. After the plants were placed, an elderly man from both groups would go to the center and chew on the sugarcane, symbolizing acceptance for the gifts. After this, singing and cheering would often ensue. Speeches lauding the warriors of both sides and flattering the new allies were commonly delivered by both sides as well.

Fore clans also placed significant emphasis on keeping strong relations with allied clans, often inviting them to extravagant pork feasts. This, in part, led to durable alliances between some clans and helped keep the peace once the fighting had ceased.

=== Colonial influence on warfare ===
After contact with Australian colonial forces in the late 1940s and early 1950s, violence between clans abruptly came to an end. Colonial forces brought a centralized, overarching power to the Fore region, establishing judicial systems and and cooperation. Colonial forces and patrol officers also brought new goods to the region, which the Fore called mono’ana and valued greatly. The decreased competition over resources and power in the region led to the relative dissolution of rivalries. Quarrels were typically resolved by the &quot;lululai&quot;, respected natives who were chartered by Australian forces to be local representatives of the Australian government. Australian patrol forces, called &quot;kiaps&quot;, also helped keep the peace by enforcing punishments on aggressors. The Australian Colonial Administration referred to this project of ending violence and establishing control in the Fore region as the &quot;pacification project.&quot; They established the Court of Native Affairs, which featured both native and Australian representatives responsible for the resolution of civil disputes amongst the Fore.

At first, the Fore distrusted and feared the colonial forces. Rituals were performed as a precaution after coming into contact with colonial forces, for fear that they may be evil spirits. However, as time went on, it became a position of social privilege for the Fore to be associated with patrol officers and colonials. Despite this, there are many accounts of natives who were treated poorly by patrol officers. Fore assistants were often overworked and under-compensated, and were sometimes subject to verbal attacks by patrol officers. Despite these transgressions, disagreements between patrol officers and natives were sporadic.

The mixture of Australian hegemony in the region, a centralized governance, an established court, incoming wealth, and the already present desire of the Fore to stop warfare led to a lasting peace in the region.

== Foreign influence on Fore culture ==
Foreign influence brought much change to the culture of the Fore, both directly and indirectly. Throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, foreign presence in the Fore region was common. Along with Australian colonial forces, scientists studying local diseases and Christian missionaries frequented the region.

The native religion of the Fore was slowly replaced with Christianity, due to the establishment of missions and influence of missionaries. This change is partially responsible for the halting of the Fore ritual of consuming deceased relatives, which was a primary agent in the rise of the kuru disease. Furthermore, the rigidity of clans and clan alliances began to dissolve, due to the halting of warfare and abundance of resources. Men and women began to mix more freely, as did people of different clans. Trade networks were vastly expanded due to the introduction of roads and more advanced transportation technology. Foreign crops and technology were embraced by Fore society, such as coffee beans and steel tools. Additionally, foreign influence and resources led to the establishment of clinics in the region, which helped decrease Fore mortality rates and bring modern health practices to the Fore.

== Influence of kuru and other diseases ==
Kuru and other diseases such as dysentery and whooping cough had a significant influence on Fore culture. Oftentimes, these diseases represented the physical manifestations of sorcery to the Fore people, which contributed to warfare and the development of religious rituals against sorcery. Furthermore, kuru predominantly affected women, as women more commonly partook in cannibalistic religious rituals. Because of this, there was a significant sex imbalance in Fore society. By some accounts, this gender imbalance reached a 3:1 male to female ratio at its worst. This affected the family structure of the Fore, as it became commonplace for children to be raised and cared for only by their fathers.

Additionally, some accredit the continued foreign interest in the Fore to the scientific phenomenon that was the kuru disease. The consistent presence of scientists and medical professionals to study kuru was one of the reasons foreign infrastructure, technology, and cultural practices was able to disperse through the region as quickly as it did, supercharging the speed of cultural change in the region.

==Kuru among the South Fore==
Kuru is a rare, orally transmitted, incurable neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by prions. The disease reached its peak prevalence in the 1950s and 1960s. It is characterized by the loss of coordination and control over muscle movement that ultimately leads to death.

Kuru first attested around the turn of the 20th century in the Uwami village of the Keiagana people, and spread to the Awande in the North Fore. By the 1930s it had spread to the South Fore. It was around this time that Ted Eubank, a European gold prospector, first noticed the neurodegenerative disease, but it was not documented until 1957, by anthropologists Berndt and Berndt, and reported to Western medicine until 1957 by D.C. Gadjusek and Vincent Zigas. According to Gajdusek, who also observed kuru in the 1950s, the hypothesis that the disease was spread via the endocannibalistic rituals of the Fore people was extremely apparent. However, Shirley Lindenbaum and Robert Glasse were the first to formally publish the hypothesis that kuru spread through cannibalism.

Women and children would most often consume the brains of the deceased, which were the most likely body part to contain the infectious prion agent, while the men preferentially consumed muscle tissue. As a result, the vast majority of victims among the South Fore were women. In fact, eight times more women than men contracted the disease. It later affected small children and the elderly at a high rate as well.

The incidence of kuru increased in the 1940s and 1950s and mortality rate began to approach close to 35/1,000 in a population of 12,000 Fore people. The mortality rate distorted the female:male ratio, which reached 1:2, or even 1:3 among South Fore. The prevalence of the kuru epidemic has been on a steady decline since the 1950s, but has lingered into the 21st century due its incubation period which can last as long as 50 years.

Though the Fore people also dispose of their dead in other ways, the most common method up to the 1960s was transumption, or consumption of their dead. Transumption not only expressed love and grief, but also recycled the deceased&#x27;s abilities within the family and quarantined the &quot;kwela&quot;, which was dangerous if not disposed of properly. It was believed that women&#x27;s wombs were best for containing the &quot;kwela&quot;.

When an individual died, after grieving for two to three days, the Fore women cut up, divided, shared, and consumed the body. The men rarely partook in the dismemberment and consumption of the corpse. They took great care to consume all parts, even drying and crushing the bones and all used cooking utensils and mixing it in with vegetables so that nothing was missed. A series of purification rituals meant to cleanse the body of &quot;kwela&quot; then took place over several weeks. Finally, there were feasts and rituals that simultaneously compensated the women for housing the &quot;kwela&quot;, acted as the final step in cleansing the body of &quot;kwela&quot;, and sent all remaining parts of the soul to the land of the dead.

This practice of transumption only amplified the spread of kuru within Fore communities. Following the outbreak, the Australian government forbade and rigorously controlled the practice, and transumption ceased almost immediately. It is now widely believed that kuru transmission through transumption had ceased by the 1960s, though it continued longer in the south than in the north.

Fore women consumed the brain more than men and children did. Because of this and their primary role in transumption, they had a much higher mortality rate of kuru than men, which spurred a demographic emergency. Men took on the roles and duties of the mother in addition to that of the father, healers were consulted and pilgrimages organized, bride prices were withheld until the bride produced a child, and many feared extinction. The Fore people believe that ailments and misfortunes stem from sorcery and witchcraft, so naturally they scrambled to find the sorcerers responsible for kuru. Today, they no longer attribute kuru to witchcraft. However, they have not adopted modern medicine nor abandoned their belief in sorcery.

<text>The Republic of West Papua (), alternatively known as the Federal Republic of West Papua (, RFPB) is a proposed state consisting of the Western New Guinea region, which is currently part of Indonesia on the continent of Oceania. The region has been part of Indonesia since 1 May 1963 under several names in the following order, West Irian, Irian Jaya, and Papua. Today the region comprises six Indonesian provinces: Papua, Central Papua, Highland Papua, South Papua, West Papua, and Southwest Papua.

The proposal is supported by the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu with the Parliament of Vanuatu passing the Wantok Blong Yumi Bill (Our Close Friends) in 2010, officially declaring that Vanuatu&#x27;s foreign policy is to support the achievement of the independence of West Papua. The parliament has proposed requesting that West Papua be granted observer status at the Melanesian Spearhead Group and Pacific Islands Forum.

The Republic of West Papua has been a member state of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) since the organization&#x27;s founding in 1991.

==History==
The region was previously mostly unclaimed, with the coastal regions and surrounding islands having a trading relationship with both the Sultanate of Tidore and the Sultanate of Ternate. Under the 1660 treaty between the Sultanate of Tidore and the Sultanate of Ternate which was under Dutch colony the Papuan people are recognized as subjects of Tidore sultanate. Under the 1872 treaty, the Sultanate of Tidore recognized Dutch control over its entire territory, which was used by the Kingdom of the Netherlands to establish West Papua as a formal colony part of the Dutch East Indies. For most of the colonial rule, there was no distinction made between Moluccans and Papuan. With parts of New Guinea is ruled administratively under Residentie Amboina. In 1922, Residentie Ternate was combined with Residentie Amboina and renamed Residentie Molukken. In 1935 the Residentie was renamed Gouvernement Molukken until the creation of Gouvernement Groote Oost in 1938, in which Gouvernement Molukken became residentie again. Under Dutch colonialism, West New Guinea is separated into two afdeeling, Afdeeling Nieuw-Guinea, and Afdeeling Zuid Nieuw-Guinea.

In 1949 after the Round Table conference, Netherlands kept part of its colony with the West New Guinea region known as Dutch New Guinea. The Dutch planned to settle most of its mixed population from Dutch East Indies in West New Guinea. When that plan failed, the Dutch had planned to withdraw by 1970 and began &quot;Papuanization&quot; to prepare for independence. In February 1961, the Dutch organised elections for the New Guinea Council a Papuan representative body to advise the Governor. The Council appointed a National Committee to prepare a political manifesto for the future state. On 1 December 1961, an inauguration ceremony was held for the Morning Star flag raised outside the Council building in the presence of the Governor, also the national anthem &quot;Hai Tanahku Papua&quot;, the birds of paradise coat of arms, motto and the name of Papua Barat (West Papua) for the proposed new state. The Dutch had accepted the Manifesto except the denomination of the flag recognizing it as a territorial flag not a national flag.

The Dutch continued the formation of a council on October 19, 1961 which drafted the Manifesto for Independence and Self-Government, the national flag (the Morning Star Flag), the national stamp, the birds of paradise coat of arms, motto and the name of Papua Barat (West Papua), chose &quot;Hai Tanahku Papua&quot; as the national anthem, and asked people to be recognized as Papuans. The Dutch recognized this flag and song on November 18, 1961 and these regulations came into force on December 1, 1961. The Dutch stated that they had accepted the Manifesto except for the denomination of the flag recognizing it as a territorial flag, not a national flag.

On 1 July 1971, Brigadier General Seth Jafeth Rumkorem, a former member of Indonesian military cadet and son of an Indonesian military officer, defected and became the leader of the militant independence movement Free Papua Movement (), proclaimed unilaterally West Papua as an independent democratic republic. The Morning Star flag was declared as a national flag.

On 14 December 1988, Thom Wainggai unilaterally proclaimed the Republic of West Melanesia using the Melanesian identity of the West Papuan people the name. The West Melanesia flag featured 14 stars with three colored bars of black, red and white.

On 19 October 2011, Forkorus Yaboisembut, the head of the West Papua National Authority (WPNA), proclaimed the Federal Republic of West Papua () with the Mambruk pigeon as the symbol of state.

In December 2014, all West Papuan independence movement groups were united under a single umbrella organization the United Liberation Movement for West Papua (ULMWP). The organization is chaired by Benny Wenda. In July 2019, the ULMWP claimed to have earlier in May united all West Papuan military factions under the one command forming the West Papua Army, including the West Papua National Liberation Army (TPNPB), that would be under &quot;the political leadership of the ULMWP&quot;. The TPNPB released a statement in response denying that it had merged and called for a retraction and apology and said it had withdrawn from the ULMWP following a ULMWP summit in Vanuatu in 2017. On 1 December 2020, the ULMWP announced it was forming a provisional government for the Republic of West Papua with a provisional constitution and with Benny Wenda as interim president.

<text>Anthony Doerr is an American author of novels and short stories. He gained widespread recognition for his 2014 novel &quot;All the Light We Cannot See&quot;, which won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.

== Early life and education==
Raised in Cleveland, Ohio, Doerr attended the nearby University School, graduating in 1991. He then majored in history at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, graduating in 1995. He earned an MFA from Bowling Green State University.

==Career==
Doerr&#x27;s first book was a collection of short stories called &quot;The Shell Collector&quot; (2002). His first novel, &quot;About Grace&quot;, was released in 2004. His memoir, &quot;Four Seasons in Rome&quot;, was published in 2007, and his second collection of short stories, &quot;Memory Wall,&quot; was published in 2010.

Doerr&#x27;s second novel, &quot;All the Light We Cannot See&quot;, is set in occupied France during World War II and was published in 2014. It received significant critical acclaim and was a finalist for the National Book Award for Fiction. The book was a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller, and was named by the newspaper as a notable book of 2014. It won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2015.

<doc id="1320482" wikidata="Q285261" url="?curid=1320482" title="Pat Morris Neff">
<text>Pat Morris Neff (November 26, 1871 – January 20, 1952) was an American politician, educator and administrator, and the 28th Governor of Texas from 1921 to 1925, ninth President of Baylor University from 1932 to 1947, and twenty-fifth president of the Southern Baptist Convention from 1944 to 1946. He served as Grand Master of Masons in Texas in 1946.

==Early life==
Born on his family ranch near the Eagle Springs community in Coryell County, Texas, to Isabella Neff and her husband Noah, Pat Neff grew up on the Texas frontier and attended local schools. He graduated from McGregor High School. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Baylor University in Waco.

He worked for the next two years teaching at Southwestern Academy in Magnolia, Arkansas, to earn money to go to law school. Among his students was Harvey C. Couch, who would later become a successful entrepreneur in Arkansas.

Upon returning to Texas, Neff studied and received his law degree from the University of Texas School of Law in Austin. There, he developed a close friendship with Tom Connally and Morris Sheppard of Texas, who both became politicians and were later elected as U.S. senators from the state.

After receiving his law degree and passing the bar, on May 31, 1899, Neff married Baylor classmate Myrtle Mainer in her hometown of Lovelady. In 1901, they had a daughter, whom they named Hallie Maude. They also had a son, Pat M. Neff, Jr.

==Public office in Texas==
Neff joined the Democratic Party and entered politics, being elected in 1898 to the Texas House of Representatives, and serving from 1899 to 1905. He was elected to one term as Speaker. After returning to his law practice in Waco, Neff served for six years as the assistant county attorney and then as county attorney for McLennan County.

Considered a progressive Democrat, Neff defeated former U.S. Senator Joseph Weldon Bailey, a former populist, in the party primary for governor in 1920. This defeat effectively ended Bailey&#x27;s political career. Neff handily won the general election and started his term in 1921. During his tenure, a number of reforms were carried out such as new labor laws, the organization of cooperative marketing associations to assist farmers with selling their commodities, and higher funding for vocational and rural schools. 

Neff received criticism during his time as governor for vetoing a minimum wage act. This was introduced to replace a previous minimum wage law that had been repealed by the Texas Legislature. Much of Neff’s opposition to the measure, however, was directed to the fact that it excluded several categories of workers from its provisions, and in his veto message stated that his veto should not be interpreted as meaning that he did not believe in the possibility of a “just and entirely workable” minimum wage bill.

Neff was a strong supporter of prohibition. He was instrumental in the development of the Texas State Parks Board. Neff and his mother, Isabella Neff, donated the land which would become the first state park in Texas. It was named Mother Neff State Park. During the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan during his administration, Neff was criticized for not taking a stronger stance. Neff is notable for his pardon of folk singer Lead Belly in his last days as governor.

Neff was reelected in 1922 but did not seek a third term in 1924. At the time, it was &quot;understood&quot; that no governor should run for a third term, although Texas did not have official term limits for the office.

In 1924 Miriam Wallace &quot;Ma&quot; Ferguson, wife of controversial former Governor James E. Ferguson, won the general election. The Republican nominee, George C. Butte, an American jurist who had opposed James Ferguson&#x27;s line item veto of the 1917 University of Texas appropriations bill, had a stronger than usual showing. Many voters crossed party lines to vote for him, as they were unhappy with the corruption associated with &quot;Pa&quot; Ferguson.

Neff served as a member of the Railroad Commission of Texas from 1929 to 1933.

==President of Baylor University==
After the death of Samuel Palmer Brooks, Neff was nominated to replace him as President of Baylor University. He resigned the post of President of the Board of Trustees, a position that he had held since it was vacated by B. H. Carroll in 1907, upon the nomination as President. In 1947, Neff was asked to stay on as the President by the staff at Baylor University.


==President of the Southern Baptist Convention==
Neff was president of the Southern Baptist Convention from 1944 to 1946.

==Legacy==
Pat Neff Elementary School in Houston and Pat Neff Middle School of San Antonio (Northside Independent School District) are named for Neff, as is Pat Neff Hall at Baylor.

Neff died in Waco and is interred there at Oakwood Cemetery. His papers, including those from his time as governor, are housed in The Texas Collection at Baylor University.

<doc id="1320492" wikidata="Q1546616" url="?curid=1320492" title="Mount Moran">
<text>Mount Moran () is a mountain in Grand Teton National Park of western Wyoming, USA. The mountain is named for Thomas Moran, an American western frontier landscape artist. Mount Moran dominates the northern section of the Teton Range rising above Jackson Lake. Several active glaciers exist on the mountain with Skillet Glacier plainly visible on the monolithic east face. Like the Middle Teton in the same range, Mount Moran&#x27;s face is marked by a distinctive basalt intrusion known as the Black Dike.

==Climbing==
Mount Moran is a massive and impressive mountain which would make it attractive to mountaineers. However, the comparative difficulty of the approach to the climbs makes it a much less popular climb than the Grand Teton and other peaks to the south. No trails to Mount Moran have been maintained for over twenty years, and any approach overland requires a great deal of bushwhacking through vegetation, deadfalls, and bogs along the perimeter of Leigh Lake. Instead, most climbers choose to canoe from String Lake, across Leigh Lake and then pick their way to their respective route; but even this may require some overland route finding. As a result, most climbs on Mount Moran tend to take several days even when the technical portion of the climb is comparatively brief.

The first ascent of Mount Moran was made on July 22, 1922 by LeGrand Hardy, Bennet McNulty, and Ben C. Rich of the Chicago Mountaineering Club, via the Skillet Glacier route. It still provides perhaps the easiest and most direct route to the summit, and is rated 5.4. As the name implies, most of the climb is on the steep snow and ice of Skillet Glacier, thus an ice axe and crampons are used during the ascent.

The most popular route up Mount Moran is the CMC route, named for the Chicago Mountaineering Club. The CMC is rated 5.5, and ascends the east face just south of the Black Dike. The CMC climbs good rock and is essentially free of snow and ice. It also has the advantage of a good camp high on the flank of the mountain.

The Direct South Buttress, a grade IV claim rated from 5.7 A3 to 5.9 C1, is a technical route suited for aid and Alpine climbing. It has a vertical gain of approximately , and features 11 pitches. This route is featured in the historic climbing text &quot;Fifty Classic Climbs of North America&quot;, and was first ascended by Richard Emerson, Don Decker, and Leigh Ortenburger, August 30–31, 1953.

==Climate==
==History==
On November 21, 1950, a DC-3C cargo plane owned by the New Tribes Mission crashed on Mount Moran during a storm, killing all 21 on board. A rescue party organized by Paul Petzoldt located the wreckage on November 25, but the extreme location of the crash made it impossible to recover the plane or the bodies. The wreckage remains on the mountain today, but the Park Service discourages climbs to the site.

<text>Jlloyd Tafari Samuel ( , 29 March 1981 – 15 May 2018) was a professional footballer who played as a defender and midfielder. Born in Trinidad and Tobago, he was raised in England and played for England up to under-21 level. He played 3 seasons for Iranian Esteghlal of the Persian Gulf Pro League. He played two full international matches for Trinidad and Tobago in 2009.

Samuel played as a youth for the London-based junior team Senrab and was in the academies of West Ham United and Charlton Athletic before joining Aston Villa&#x27;s youth team in 1997 as a trainee. He made a total of 198 appearances for Villa before moving to fellow Premier League club Bolton Wanderers in 2007, where he spent a further four years including a brief spell on loan at Cardiff City in the Championship. Samuel spent the last four years of his professional career in the Iran Pro League, representing Esteghlal and Paykan. He won a Hazfi Cup and a league title with Esteghlal.

After returning to England from Iran, he became player-manager of Cheshire-based amateur team Egerton. He died on 15 May 2018 in a collision between two vehicles, at the age of 37.

==Club career==
===Aston Villa===
Born in San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago, Samuel grew up in London and as a youth he played for Sunday league team Senrab, lining up in 1994 alongside future England internationals John Terry and Jermain Defoe. He was released from West Ham United on the same day as Paul Konchesky, Bobby Zamora (both of whom later returned to the Hammers) and Fitz Hall.

He signed for Aston Villa in July 1997 as a youth training scheme trainee, spending the 1997–98 and 1998–99 seasons in their youth team. Samuel&#x27;s Aston Villa debut came in a second-round second-leg League Cup match against Chester City on 21 September 1999, which finished 5–0 in Aston Villa&#x27;s favour. He replaced Gareth Barry after 51 minutes at Villa Park. On 25 March 2000, due to an injury to England international Gareth Southgate, he made his league debut in a 2–0 home win over Derby County, playing in central defence.

Samuel was loaned to First Division club Gillingham, where he made seven full appearances and one substitute appearance between 25 October and 3 December 2001. After he returned to Villa, the team&#x27;s starting right-back, Mark Delaney, suffered an injury and Samuel filled his position; after the Welshman returned, Samuel was given a favoured left-back position. He reflected in a 2013 interview that his versatility helped him become a regular starter: &quot;If you&#x27;re just in one position and you&#x27;re out of favour, you won&#x27;t play. But if you can play in a variety of roles, it widens your options&quot;.

In the 2003–04 season, Samuel played every minute as Villa came 6th in the Premier League. He scored his first professional goal on 20 September 2003 against his former club Charlton, from 19 yards to give Villa a 2–1 victory. He scored again in the reverse fixture at The Valley on 27 March 2004, which the Villans won by the same score. That season he also scored on 27 January in a 2–0 League Cup semi-final second leg win over his future club Bolton Wanderers, who advanced 5–4 on aggregate.

Towards the end of his time at the Birmingham-based club, Samuel lost his place in the team as managers David O&#x27;Leary and Martin O&#x27;Neill opted for the Dutchman Wilfred Bouma to play in his position.

===Bolton Wanderers===

Samuel signed a four-year contract with Bolton Wanderers on 1 July 2007, Sammy Lee&#x27;s first signing as Bolton manager. He played in every Bolton match in the 2008–09 season, and 71 matches in total during his time at the club.

On 24 March 2011, Samuel joined Football League Championship side Cardiff City on loan until the end of the season wearing shirt number 21, as cover for the injured Mark Hudson. He had not played a game for Wanderers&#x27; during the 2010–11 season due to injury, and was released at the end of the season, bringing his four years at the club to an end.

===Trials===
Samuel joined Leeds United, managed by his former Aston Villa teammate Simon Grayson, on trial on 19 July 2011. He was included in the squad against Rochdale the same evening. He came off the bench at the start of the second half in a match Leeds won by a single first half goal from Max Gradel. Samuel was released from the trial after picking up an injury. On 30 July 2011, Samuel played for 79 minutes on trial for West Ham United in their final pre-season game against Real Zaragoza which West Ham won 2–0. However, West Ham decided against offering him a permanent contract.

===Iran===
On 31 December 2011, Samuel joined Iran Pro League side, Esteghlal, where he was welcomed with the local custom of sacrificing a sheep. He was re-united with his former Bolton teammate Andranik Teymourian. Samuel played in midfield in Iran, and told Aston Villa&#x27;s official website that he was enjoying being able to move forward and score goals. His team won the Hazfi Cup in his first season and the Iran Pro League a year later. Esteghlal reached the semi-finals of the 2013 AFC Champions League, in which he scored a goal in the second leg of the semi-finals at home to FC Seoul in a 2–2 draw (4–2 aggregate loss).

Samuel extended his contract with Esteghlal on 12 July 2013, keeping him at the club until 2014. He left the club in June 2014, citing a five-month pay dispute with the club. He remained in Tehran and signed a two-year contract with newly promoted Paykan on 23 June 2014, effective 1 July.

===Egerton===
After returning to England, Samuel trained with Egerton, a Cheshire League One (12th tier) club who had fellow ex-Premier League players Emile Heskey, Danny Webber, Emmerson Boyce and Nathan Ellington training with them. Despite offers to play abroad, he chose Egerton so that he could remain close to his family, and the chairman appointed him player-manager for the 2017–18 season.

When speaking to the BBC following Samuel&#x27;s death, Ellington mentioned that his teammate had been involved in a large-scale regeneration project in The Gambia in his final years.

==International career==
Samuel was called up for England in March 2004 whilst enjoying a spell of good form for Aston Villa and could have made his debut in the 1–0 friendly loss to Sweden if Sven-Göran Eriksson had selected him. He had previously represented England at U-18, U-20 and U-21 level.

Later on, Samuuel wanted to represent Trinidad and Tobago in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, but the application was rejected by FIFA. The rules in place at the time said that only players under the age of 21 could change their international allegiances.

On 7 August 2009, it was revealed that Bobby Zamora and Samuel had received Trinidad and Tobago passports, making them eligible to play for the Soca Warriors. He made his debut for Trinidad and Tobago on 5 September in a 4–1 loss away to Honduras in World Cup qualification and appeared for the second and last time four days later, receiving a yellow card in a 1–0 home loss to the United States.

==Death==
Samuel was travelling home after taking his children to school on the morning of 15 May 2018 when his Range Rover collided with a van in High Legh, Cheshire. He died at the scene and the driver of the other vehicle was seriously injured. At the inquest in November 2019, it was revealed that Samuel was twice the drink-driving limit and that his car had strayed onto the wrong side of the road, causing a head-on crash.

Aston Villa wore black armbands for their Championship play-off match against Middlesbrough that night. His club at the time of his death, Egerton FC, cancelled all the remaining games that week as a mark of respect.

Samuel&#x27;s body was burned so badly that he could only be identified by dental records and a blood sample that matched the DNA on his hairbrush. Before the inquest, his sister had accused his widow of faking his death, adding that the samples were not released for her to check against her own DNA. The coroner said that the samples remain the property of Samuel&#x27;s widow.

==Personal life==
Jlloyd Samuel was married to Emma and had three children with her, as well as a child from a previous relationship. His son Lakyle, born in 2006, is part of Manchester City&#x27;s academy and captained England at the 2023 FIFA U-17 World Cup. Samuel&#x27;s life and death were covered in the 2022 ITVBe documentary &quot;The Footballer, His Wife, and the Crash&quot;. The documentary claimed he had a secret second wife in Iran, fashion designer Helia Sahimi, and that he had converted to Islam to marry her.

<text>New Haven Union Station is the main railroad passenger station in New Haven, Connecticut. It is the third such station in the city of New Haven, preceded by both an 1848 built station in a different location, and an 1879 built station near the current station&#x27;s location. Designed by noted American architect Cass Gilbert, the present beaux-arts Union Station was completed and opened in 1920 after the previous Union Station (which was located at the foot of Meadow Street, near the site of the current Union Station parking garage) was destroyed by fire. It served the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad for the next five decades, but fell into decline following World War II along with the United States railroad industry as a whole.

The New Haven Railroad went bankrupt in 1961, and the station was transferred to the Penn Central Transportation Company along with the rest of the New Haven Railroad on January 1, 1969. Penn Central itself went bankrupt the next year, and the station building was closed in 1973 to cut costs, leaving only the under-track &#x27;subway&#x27; open for passengers. The station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 3, 1975, but it was almost demolished before being saved by the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project in 1979, which began work to rehabilitate the station building. Reopened after extensive renovations in early 1985, it is now the most important transportation hub in New Haven. In the 21st century, it is the busiest train station in the state of Connecticut by passengers served, as well as one of the most used stations in Amtrak&#x27;s entire network.

The property is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as New Haven Railroad Station. Its significance is partly as an example of the work of Cass Gilbert, who also designed the Woolworth Building in New York and the U.S. Supreme Court Building. The restored building features interior limestone walls, ornate ceilings, chandeliers and striking stainless steel ceilings in the tunnels to the trains. The large waiting room is thirty-five feet high and features models of NYNH&amp;HRR trains on the benches.

Located at the intersection of the Northeast Corridor and the New Haven–Springfield Line, the station serves a variety of train services, including Amtrak, CT Rail, and Metro-North.

== Station layout ==

The station has four high-level island platforms, which are used for service in both directions. The New Haven Line has nine tracks at the station. The northern platform is adjacent to Tracks 1 and 3 is usually served by Amtrak and can accommodate 8-car trains. The second platform from the north, adjacent to Tracks 2 and 4, is usually served by Amtrak and is 9 cars long. The second platform from the south is adjacent to Tracks 8 and 10, served by Metro-North, Shore Line East, and the Hartford Line, and can fit 7-car trains. The southern platform is adjacent to Tracks 12 and 14, usually serves Metro-North and Shore Line East, and can accommodate 8-car trains. Track 6, not adjacent to any platform in the center of the station, is used only by through trains or idling Shore Line East consists. There are no tracks 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13.

All tracks are connected by the stainless-steel tunnel with elevators and staircases leading onto the platforms, as well as escalators, a staircase, and an elevator leading to the tunnel itself. In 2015, LCD displays replaced a mechanical split-flap display departure board made by Solari di Udine. The split-flap display was donated to the Danbury Railway Museum in Danbury, Connecticut, to eventually be put on display.

On either side of the station, the Northeast Corridor merges into four tracks.

==Services==
===Amtrak===

Amtrak runs frequent service through Union Station along the electrified Northeast Corridor rail line. Most Amtrak trains are trains or trains operating between , and Boston.

 trains run to Springfield, Massachusetts via and trains travel along the same route but continue on to , Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=&quot;vermonter/valley flyer schedule&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these trains connect with &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; trains; other &quot;Northeast Regional&quot;s run through to Springfield from New York or vice versa. These through trains must change locomotives at New Haven, as the track north to Springfield is not electrified, unlike the Northeast Corridor. The locomotive change is from a Siemens ACS-64 for the electrified territory to a General Electric P40DC or P42DC for the non-electrified territory, or vice versa. Prior to 2000, when the Northeast Corridor was electrified all the way to Boston, all trains continuing north of Union Station had to change from diesel to electric power.

Additionally, the provides through service from Washington, D.C., beyond Springfield to , Vermont. At New Haven, the Vermonter also has a P42DC diesel-electric locomotive added to the train.

Amtrak operates a yard on the west side of the tracks, next to the station building.

Because of United Airlines code sharing on select Amtrak trains between Union Station and its hub at Newark Liberty International Airport in the New York City area, Union Station is assigned the IATA airport code of ZVE.

New Haven Union Station is the busiest Amtrak station in Connecticut. The station is the tenth busiest Amtrak station in the country, boarding or detraining nearly two thousand passengers daily.

In March 2020, &quot;Vermonter&quot; service north of the station was suspended indefinitely as part of a reduced service plan due to the coronavirus pandemic. The &quot;Vermonter&quot; resumed its normal service on July 19, 2021.

===Metro-North===

Metro-North Railroad operates its New Haven Line from Union Station to Grand Central Terminal in New York City. The service is well patronized by commuters, despite the travel time of about two hours. Shore Line East and Metro-North work together on schedules to provide quick transfers of trains for commuters traveling from the Shoreline to Grand Central Terminal or .

Metro-North operates New Haven Yard on the east side of the tracks, opposite Amtrak&#x27;s yard. Work is done here, as well as the storing of train cars and locomotives. Smaller yards are located in Bridgeport and Stamford.

A select number of trains start or end their run two minutes to the east at .

===CT Rail===
Two rail services run by the Connecticut Department of Transportation under the CT Rail brand are based at New Haven. Shore Line East runs between New Haven and on the Northeast Corridor, with limited peak-hour service west of New Haven. The Hartford Line runs between New Haven and on the New Haven–Springfield Line. Service launched on June 16, 2018.

On April 20, 2020, the station became the indefinite western terminus for Shore Line East service, running on a limited schedule due to the coronavirus pandemic. Through service to Stamford resumed on October 7, 2024.

===Buses and shuttles===
CTtransit&#x27;s New Haven Division provides bus service to the station on four routes. One is a free shuttle that connects Union Station to downtown and the New Haven Green for connections to the remainder of the CTTransit New Haven routes, only running on weekdays. Route 271 on the Kimberly Avenue route to Savin Rock and Milford also serves the station. Route 272 serves Union Station from downtown New Haven via South Church Street and returns to downtown New Haven. Route 278 is the Commuter Connection only on afternoon times connecting Shore Line East.

Other providers at Union Station are Greyhound, Megabus, Peter Pan, and the Yale University Shuttle.

== History ==
The current Union Station is the third such station to exist in New Haven; the first station, designed by Henry Austin, was opened in 1848 by the New York and New Haven Railroad. It was replaced by a new station in a different part of the city in 1879, under the auspices of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. This station served passengers in the city until it burned down in May 1918. In 1920, the New Haven Railroad opened the present station near the site of the previous station.
=== Decline ===
Following the Second World War, railroads faced increasing competition from airlines and automobiles, and passenger train service declined. The New Haven Railroad began to neglect the station&#x27;s maintenance due to its own financial troubles. In 1973, the station was purchased from New Haven Railroad successor Penn Central by the Connecticut Department of Transportation. That same year, the station building was closed to passengers as a means of reducing expenses, leaving only the station platforms and the connecting tunnels in use.

=== Revival ===
In 1982, the city of New Haven and the New Haven Parking Authority signed an agreement with the state of Connecticut to rehabilitate and reopen the station, along with improvements such as building a parking garage. A $28 million rehabilitation project began on March 28, 1983, with a combination of state and federal funding. Restoration included repairing the station&#x27;s marble furnishings, repairing the large globe lights that hung from the ceiling, cleaning the walls and ceiling, and repairing and installing new wooden benches. With rehabilitation complete, the station building reopened to passengers in 1985. Since then, the station has been operated by the New Haven Parking Authority and leased to the city of New Haven by the state government.

<doc id="1320511" wikidata="Q254866" url="?curid=1320511" title="Schuhplattler">
<text>The Schuhplattler is a traditional style of folk dance popular in the Eastern Alps, specifically originating in Upper Bavaria, Tyrol, and Salzburg. In this dance, the performers stomp, clap, and strike the soles of their shoes (&quot;Schuhe&quot;), thighs, and knees with their hands held flat (&quot;platt&quot;). The more than 150 basic Schuhplattlers, as well as marches and acrobatic feats, are often interspersed with the basic dance in performance. They may be seen today in Europe and in German-immigrant communities around the world. While the Schuhplattler is still largely performed by adults, it has become increasingly popular with youngsters, who love its colorful costumes and its bouncing, leaping, kicking, and choreographed horseplay. 
== History and style ==

One of the earliest accounts of the Schuhplattler may date from 1030 AD, when a monk in the Tegernsee Abbey of Bavaria described a village dance containing leaps and hand gestures. Over the centuries, the form gradually evolved as farmers, hunters, and woodsmen practiced it in the isolated towns and villages of the Bavarian and Tyrolean Alps. Sometimes, it was performed as a partner dance, with couples doing a &quot;Ländler&quot; and then splitting up so the girls could twirl in their colorful &quot;Dirndln&quot; as the boys showed off their . At other times, just the boys were onstage, arranged in a circle, square, or line, ing wildly for the audience. These two approaches are sometimes distinguished as the Schuhplattlertanz and Schuhplattler proper, but the &quot;boys&#x27; dance&quot; is at the core of both forms and is most often described.

The immediate precursors of today&#x27;s Schuhplatter were the 18th-century minuet, quadrille, and Française, but unlike these courtly and highly stylized dances, the early of the common folk were free of rules. The young men improvised their leaps, stomps, and acrobatic figures &quot;as it struck their fancy.&quot; Acrobatics were an important part of the dance at least by the 1820s, when boys began balancing on the shoulders of their partners and stamping their feet rhythmically on the ceiling!

Early Schuhplattlers often highlighted the towns where they were invented or imitated the various professions of the performers, such as the (miller&#x27;s dance), the (wood cutter), and the (bell dance). The music was generally in three-quarter time, like the &quot;Ländler&quot;, and was performed on the zither or the guitar, and by 1830s, the accordion or concertina.

In 1838, the Empress of Russia was honored with a Schuhplattler by the residents of the bath town of Wildbad Kreuth, and the aristocracy, fascinated by the strange costumes and quaint pursuits of the common folk, began taking an interest in the dance. Many consider the real birth of the modern Schuhplattler, however, to be King Maximilian II of Bavaria&#x27;s excursion through the Alps in 1858, when locals performed the dance for him, and he fell in love with it.

In 1886, French traveler Hugues Krafft wrote of the Schuhplattler:

On Sundays and holidays one sees couples dancing to music on larger town squares everywhere—preferably the Ländler, a leisurely waltz popular among girls and boys. The biggest attraction, however, even for the local farmers, is always the Schuhplatter. It ... begins with forming a circle. Then, while the girl is briefly separated from her partner and continues to follow waltz steps, the boy must perform a number of difficult movements to the beat of the music. He turns around on his axis, slaps his thighs and legs, falls to his knees, jumps in the air and throws his hat as he lets out a joyful whoop... Those who master the dance are cheered with vigorous applause.

By the late 19th century, traditional costume clubs () were being established throughout Bavaria and Tyrol, and soon these groups spread to German communities in America and elsewhere. Since the mission of these clubs was to preserve the age-old customs, lore, and dress of the German and Austrian Alps, the Schuhplattler became a central part of their programs. The were often strict and exacting about how the dance was to be performed and how club members were to dress, although new Schuhplattler groups sprang up after the second world war that were less tied to the older forms.

== Costume ==
For the Schuhplattler, lederhosen and dirndls are a must. These range from the simple, practical styles that have been worn in Bavaria and Tyrol for generations to the finest ornate varieties that can cost a thousand dollars or more. (knickers) are worn by some Schuhplatter groups, but they can be uncomfortable to dance in, especially in warm weather. More common are short lederhosen, which range from the knee-length version favored by traditionalist groups and Munich Oktoberfest visitors to the much shorter variety worn in South Tyrol. While European scouts have always worn lederhosen without suspenders, costume and dance groups wear either standard narrow H-bar suspenders or the wider, heavily embroidered, fancy-dress variety. Socks are knee length in solid gray, green or white. -style socks are ankle-length and have a separate band that goes around the calf.

The dirndl emerged during the 18th century as a plain, practical servant&#x27;s dress with a long skirt, bodice, blouse, and apron. In the wintertime, it was made of heavy cotton, linen, or wool with long sleeves, and in summer, it was short-sleeved and of lighter material. In the second half of the 19th century, as the Schuhplattler and lederhosen became fashionable amongst the nobility, dirndls evolved into stylish attire made of silk or satin for the very rich. Their popularity has risen and fallen over the years, but like lederhosen, the dirndl has lately had something of a resurgence in Germany and Austria.

== The Schuhplattler today ==
Traditionalist around the world still perform the Schuhplattler as a partner dance, with the women spinning across the stage in their dirndls, offering color and graceful movement to counterbalance the leaping and slapping of the . The newer dance groups, on the other hand, are often composed entirely of . They, too, perform the standard Schuhplattlers, but they do so with a contemporary energy and excitement that draws in the crowds.

Among these contemporary groups are some top-notch children&#x27;s clubs like the Oberbairing Kinder and the Jungen Wimberger, that are often associated with adult clubs but perform in festivals and competitions on their own. Like their adult counterparts, they dance not only with precision but also with a zest and enthusiasm that can leave audiences cheering.

== Expression ==
* Schuhplattler diplomacy () is a saying for Bavarian foreign policy—self-assertive, sometimes rumbling, and always engaging.

== Russian folk dance ==
A similar dance technique exists in the Russian folk dance, only that in Russian dance the male dancers stomp, clap and strike in addition to sole, front of the foot, thighs, knees also the chest. It is made at a faster pace in Russian folk dance.

<text>The 50th Grey Cup, also nicknamed the Fog Bowl, was the 1962 Grey Cup Canadian Football League championship game played between the Winnipeg Blue Bombers and the Hamilton Tiger-Cats on December 1, 1962, at Toronto&#x27;s Exhibition Stadium. It remains the only Grey Cup game ever suspended during play, and the first to be finished on a Sunday. The game was won by the Blue Bombers with the score of 28–27, and is considered to be one of the greatest Grey Cup games of all time.

==Fog Bowl==
The game started on Saturday, December 1. However, by the second quarter, a thick fog started to roll in over the field, a combination of cold, moist, humid air from Lake Ontario. The fog was thick enough that fans could not see the action on the field, receivers lost sight of the ball after it left the quarterbacks&#x27; hand, and punt returners could not find punts until they hit the ground.

The fog became worse as the afternoon wore on, and with 9 minutes and 29 seconds left in the fourth quarter, the game was suspended with Winnipeg leading 28–27. The game continued the following afternoon, but there was no further scoring, thus securing the Bomber win.

==Game summary==

Thick advection fog rolled in prior to halftime. The dense fog restricted visibility to all the fans present. Players could also not see and find the ball during passes and punts. The reduced visibility made it difficult for the referees to properly officiate. Paul Dojack, the referee, stopped the game with Winnipeg leading 28–27. After a 20-minute delay, CFL commissioner Syd Halter decided that the remainder of the game would be played the following afternoon.

The Tiger-Cats drew first blood in the opening quarter when Garney Henley took advantage of some good blocking and sprinted 74 yards for a major. The convert by Don Sutherin was no good, his first of three key errors in the game. A 41-yard run by Kenny Ploen set up a Leo Lewis touchdown to begin a wild second quarter, giving Winnipeg a 7–6 lead. Lewis struck again when he took a handoff, ran wide and threw a 15-yard pass to Charlie Shepard in the end zone.

Hamilton cut the deficit to 14–12, first on a goal-line leap by Bobby Kuntz, then on an 18-yard touchdown run by Henley following a Winnipeg fumble. Sutherin was only good on one convert however, giving the Ticats a 19–14 advantage. Winnipeg regained the lead before halftime when Lewis caught a lateral pass by Funston and ran 30 yards for another major. The Blue Bombers led 21–19 at intermission.

Hamilton quarterback Joe Zuger came out throwing in the third quarter, completing a 53-yard strike to Henley, then a 36-yard touchdown throw to Dave Viti. But Shepard responded with his second major of the game, giving Winnipeg the lead for good. Gerry James added his fourth convert for good measure. The Ticats had an opportunity to regain the lead before the end of the third quarter, but Sutherin missed on a 30-yard field goal, giving Hamilton just a single point. Both teams were held pointless in the final quarter (spread over two days) as the Bombers held on to a 28–27 lead to win their fourth title in five years.

==Trivia==
Afternoon fog in Toronto is a rare occurrence, but the Fog Bowl was just one of several weather disasters to occur at Exhibition Stadium. The stadium&#x27;s proximity to Lake Ontario made it susceptible to rapid weather changes and extreme conditions. It remains the site of the only Major League Baseball game to be played with snow on the field (the Toronto Blue Jays&#x27; inaugural game on April 7, 1977), and the only major league baseball game to be suspended due to high wind. The 1982 Grey Cup (the Rain Bowl) was played in a driving rain. The limitations of Exhibition Stadium eventually led to the construction of the retractable-roof SkyDome, now known as Rogers Centre. During its life as a professional sports stadium, local press and Torontonians often referred to Exhibition Stadium under the moniker &quot;Mistake by the Lake&quot;.

The 1962 Grey Cup was the first CFL contest to be broadcast by an American TV network, when ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; carried the game in the United States. (The game, which was shown live on the CBC starting at 12:30pm in Toronto, was shown on ABC via tape delay beginning at 4:00 Eastern time. The end of the contest the next day was carried by the CBC but not ABC.) It would be the only CFL game to air on a US network until 1980, when the nascent ESPN cable network acquired American broadcast rights to the league. The first CFL game seen on ESPN was on July 9, 1980, when the Montreal defeated Toronto, 18-11.

==Aftermath==
The following year, the CFL adopted a new rule in case play in the Grey Cup game had to be suspended. If a suspension occurred before the end of the third quarter, it would be resumed at the same point the next day, as was done in 1962. But if the fourth quarter had already begun, the CFL commissioner would choose between two options: (a) if he considered that one team had a big lead, he would declare the game over; or (b) if the commissioner thought if the game was still close, the score would carry over to the following day -- but instead of play resuming at the point where it was left off, two ten-minute halves would be played, each starting with a kickoff.

Eventually, the CFL adopted a more complex set of rules for weather postponements.

<text>In genetics, a missense mutation is a point mutation in which a single nucleotide change results in a codon that codes for a different amino acid. It is a type of nonsynonymous substitution.

==Substitution of protein from DNA mutations==
Missense mutation refers to a change in one amino acid in a protein, made up of multiple amimo acids, arising from a point mutation in a single nucleotide. Missense mutations are a type of nonsynonymous substitution in a DNA sequence. Two other types of nonsynonymous substitution are the nonsense mutations, in which a codon is changed to a premature stop codon that results in the resulting protein being cut short, and the nonstop mutations, in which a stop codon deletion results in a longer but nonfunctional protein.

Missense mutations can render the resulting protein nonfunctional, and these mutations are responsible for human diseases such as Epidermolysis bullosa, sickle-cell disease, SOD1 mediated ALS, and a substantial number of cancers.

In the most common variant of sickle-cell disease, the 20th nucleotide of the gene for the beta chain of hemoglobin is altered from the codon GAG to GTG. Thus, the 6th amino acid glutamic acid is substituted by valine—notated as an &quot;E6V&quot; mutation—and the protein is sufficiently altered to cause the sickle-cell disease.

Not all missense mutations lead to appreciable protein changes. An amino acid may be replaced by an amino acid of very similar chemical properties, in which case, the protein may still function normally; this is termed a neutral, &quot;quiet&quot;, &quot;silent&quot; or conservative mutation. Alternatively, the amino acid substitution could occur in a region of the protein which does not significantly affect the protein secondary structure or function. When an amino acid may be encoded by more than one codon (so-called &quot;degenerate coding&quot;) a mutation in a codon may not produce any change in translation; this would be a synonymous substitution and not a missense mutation.

== Examples ==

=== LMNA Missense Mutation ===

 DNA: 5&#x27; - AAC AGC CTG CGT ACG GCT CTC - 3&#x27;
 3&#x27; - TTG TCG GAC GCA TGC CGA GAG - 5&#x27;
 mRNA: 5&#x27; - AAC AGC CUG CGU ACG GCU CUC - 3&#x27;
 Protein: Asn Ser Leu Arg Thr Ala Leu

LMNA missense mutation (c.1580G&gt;T) introduced at LMNA gene – position 1580 (nt) in the DNA sequence (CGT) causing the guanine to be replaced with the thymine, yielding CTT in the DNA sequence. This results at the protein level in the replacement of the arginine by the leucine at the position 527. This leads to destruction of salt bridge and structure destabilization. At phenotype level this manifests with overlapping mandibuloacral dysplasia and progeria syndrome.

The resulting transcript and protein product is:

 DNA: 5&#x27; - AAC AGC CTG CTT ACG GCT CTC - 3&#x27;
 3&#x27; - TTG TCG GAC GAA TGC CGA GAG - 5&#x27;
 mRNA: 5&#x27; - AAC AGC CUG CUU ACG GCU CUC - 3&#x27;
 Protein: Asn Ser Leu Leu Thr Ala Leu

=== Rett Syndrome ===
Missense mutations in the MeCP2 protein can cause Rett syndrome, otherwise known as the RTT phenotype. T158M, R306C and R133C are the most common missense mutations causing RTT. T158M is a mutation of an adenine being substituted for a guanine causing the threonine at amino acid position 158 being substituted with a methionine. R133C is a mutation of a cytosine at base position 417 in the gene encoding the MeCP2 protein being substituted for a thymine, causing an amino acid substitution at position 133 in the protein of arginine with cysteine.

== Identification ==

Cancer associated missense mutations can lead to drastic destabilisation of the resulting protein. A method to screen for such changes was proposed in 2012, namely fast parallel proteolysis (FASTpp).

<text>Sheraton Hotels and Resorts is an American international hotel chain owned by Marriott International. As of June 30, 2020, Sheraton operates 446 hotels with 155,617 rooms globally, including locations in North America, Africa, Asia Pacific, Central and South America, Europe, the Middle East and the Caribbean, in addition to 84 hotels with 23,092 rooms in the pipeline.

==History==

===Early years===
The origins of Sheraton Hotels date to 1933, when Harvard classmates Ernest Henderson and Robert Moore purchased the Continental Hotel in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

In 1937, Henderson and Moore purchased the Standard Investing Corporation and the International Equities Corporation, combining them into the Standard Equities Corporation, the company through which they would run their hotels. Also in 1937, they purchased their second hotel, and the first as part of the new company, the Stonehaven Hotel in Springfield, Massachusetts, a converted apartment building. Sheraton dates its founding to that year and considers that property its first hotel.

The chain got its name from the third hotel the pair acquired, in Boston, in 1939. It had a large lighted sign on the roof saying &quot;Sheraton Hotel,&quot; which was too expensive to change. Instead, Henderson and Moore decided to call all of their hotels by that name.

Henderson and Moore purchased Boston&#x27;s famed Copley Plaza Hotel in 1941, and continued expanding rapidly, buying existing properties along the East Coast from Maine to Florida.

In 1946, the Standard Equities Corporation merged with the United States Realty and Improvement Corporation, forming the Sheraton Corporation of America, which became the first hotel chain to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1947.

===Expansion===
In 1949, Sheraton expanded internationally, buying the Ford Hotels chain, with three properties in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal. They quickly resold the Toronto and Ottawa properties to finance their continued Canadian expansion in 1950, paying $4.8 million to purchase Cardy Hotels, a chain of six properties in Ontario and Quebec. In April 1951, the Park Sheraton Hotel in New York City would host the 1951 NBA draft, which was the second ever draft under the NBA name and fifth overall NBA draft in existence by that time.

In 1956, Sheraton paid $30 million to buy the Eppley Hotel Company, which was then the largest privately held hotel business in the United States, with 22 properties across six Midwestern states. Sheraton retained ten of the largest hotels and immediately resold the other twelve. That same year, Sheraton acquired its first motels, purchasing two properties in the suburbs of Syracuse, New York. In 1957, Sheraton, which had previously focused on acquiring existing hotels, opened its first newly built hotel, the Philadelphia Sheraton Hotel. In 1958, Sheraton became the first hotel chain to centralize and computerize its reservations when it introduced &quot;Reservatron&quot;, the hotel industry&#x27;s first automatic electronic reservations system.

In 1959, Sheraton acquired its first properties outside North America, purchasing four hotels owned by the Matson Lines on Waikiki Beach in Honolulu, Hawaii - the Moana Hotel, the Royal Hawaiian Hotel, the SurfRider Hotel, and the Princess Kaiulani Hotel. That same year Sheraton opened its first newly built motel, marketed as a &quot;Highway Hotel,&quot; the Sheraton Inn, located in Binghamton, New York.

The early 1960s saw the arrival of the first Sheraton hotels outside the US and Canada, with the opening of the Sheraton-Tel Aviv Hotel in Israel in March 1961 and two Caribbean properties in 1962 - the Sheraton-Kingston Hotel in Jamaica and the British Colonial Hilton Nassau in Nassau, Bahamas.

In 1962, Sheraton created a franchise division, primarily to operate Sheraton Motor Inns, large highway motels providing free parking. In 1963 Sheraton opened its first hotel in South America, the Macuto-Sheraton Hotel, outside Caracas, Venezuela. In 1965 the 100th Sheraton property, the Sheraton-Boston Hotel, opened. In 1966 Sheraton opened its first hotel in an Arab country, the Kuwait-Sheraton Hotel. In 1967 Sheraton unveiled &quot;Reservatron II&quot;, a computer system for personalized reservations. That same year, Sheraton opened its first hotel in Asia, the Sheraton-Philippines Hotel in Manila; its first hotel in Europe, the Sheraton-Du Cap Hotel on the island of Corsica in France; and its first hotels in Australia, two Sheraton Motor Hotels in Melbourne and Sydney.

===Purchase by ITT===
In 1968, the multinational conglomerate ITT Corporation purchased the chain and immediately sold eighteen aging Sheraton properties. Under ITT&#x27;s ownership, Sheraton quickly moved away from ownership and operation of its properties to a new model of franchising and management, as the chain expanded greatly both in the US and abroad.

In late 1969, Sheraton introduced the hotel industry&#x27;s first nationwide toll-free number, which displaced two hundred local Sheraton reservation numbers. The radio jingle for &quot;Eight-Oh-Oh, Three-Two-Five, Three-Five Three-Five&quot; &quot;ran throughout the decade and into the eighties&quot; but the jingle&#x27;s lifespan went even beyond.

In 1970, Sheraton introduced the Sheraton Towers concept, a line of luxury &quot;hotel-within-a-hotel&quot; facilities designed for business travelers and located within Sheraton&#x27;s largest and most exclusive hotels. The first Sheraton Towers to open was in the chain&#x27;s flagship Sheraton-Boston Hotel. That same year, Sheraton opened its first hotel in North Africa, the Cario-Sheraton Hotel &amp; Casino. In 1971 Sheraton opened its first hotels in Continental Europe, the Sheraton Stockholm Hotel and the Sheraton-Copenhagen Hotel. In 1972, Sheraton opened its first hotel in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Sheraton-Mont Febe Palace in Yaounde, Cameroon. From 1977 to 1997 the company was headquartered at 60 State Street in Boston.

In 1985, Sheraton became the first western chain to operate a hotel bearing the name of an international company in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, when it assumed management of the Great Wall Hotel in Beijing, a financially troubled two-year-old Chinese-American joint venture, which became the Great Wall Sheraton.

By 1987, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;50 years old, the world&#x27;s largest hotel chain, and consumer-driven.&quot;

On October 24, 1989, Sheraton was officially rebranded as ITT Sheraton.

===Development in the 1990s===
On January 13, 1992, ITT Sheraton designated 28 of its premier hotels and 33 of the Sheraton Towers as the ITT Sheraton Luxury Collection. The flagship of the division was The St Regis in New York City.

In 1994, ITT Sheraton purchased a controlling interest in the Italian CIGA chain, the Compagnia Italiana Grandi Alberghi, or Italian Grand Hotels Company. The chain had begun by operating hotels in Italy, but over-expanded across Europe just as a recession hit, and had been seized from its previous owner, the Aga Khan, by its creditors. The majority of these hotels were placed in the ITT Sheraton Luxury Collection, though a few were placed in the Sheraton division.

In April 1995, ITT Sheraton introduced a new, mid-range hotel brand, Four Points by Sheraton, to replace the designation of certain hotels as Sheraton Inns.

===Purchase by Starwood===
In 1998, Starwood acquired ITT Sheraton for $13.3 billion, topping an offer by rival Hilton. Under Starwood&#x27;s leadership, Sheraton began renovating many hotels and expanding the brand&#x27;s footprint. Starwood also began marketing The Luxury Collection as a completely separate brand, even though it contained a large number of hotels still named Sheraton. Most of those properties have since been renamed. Only three such hotels remain today - Sheraton Addis in (Addis Ababa, Ethiopia), Sheraton Grande Sukhumvit in (Bangkok, Thailand), and Sheraton Kuwait in (Kuwait City, Kuwait). Also in 1998, Sheraton joined with the Arabella Hospitality Group in Germany to create ArabellaSheraton, a joint venture under which 14 Arabella Hotels in Germany, Switzerland and Spain were rebranded as ArabellaSheraton Hotels.

In 1999, Sheraton bought the outstanding shares in CIGA, giving it complete ownership.

In 2015, Starwood introduced the &quot;Sheraton Grand&quot; brand, higher-end Sheraton properties located in urban or resort destinations.

===Takeover by Marriott===
In 2016, Marriott International purchased Starwood Hotels, and the newly merged company again became the world&#x27;s largest hotel and resort company. Although the Sheraton brand expresses quality in Asia, aging properties have made the US market more problematic.

In 2023, Marriott announced a new spinoff brand of Four Points by Sheraton, called Four Points Express by Sheraton, targeting the mid-range market in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Its first property opened in Nilüfer, Bursa, Turkey that fall. In 2024, the brand was renamed Four Points Flex by Sheraton.

<doc id="1320563" wikidata="Q1199128" url="?curid=1320563" title="Shall We Dance? (1996 film)">
<text>is a 1996 Japanese romantic comedy-drama film directed by Masayuki Suo. Its title refers to the song &quot;Shall We Dance?&quot; which comes from Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;The King and I&quot;. It inspired the 2004 English-language remake of the same name.

==Plot==
The film begins with a close-up of the inscription above the stage in the ballroom of the Blackpool Tower: &quot;Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear&quot;, from the poem &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; by William Shakespeare. As the camera pans around the ballroom giving a view of the dancers, a voice-over explains that in Japan, ballroom dancing is treated with suspicion.

Successful &quot;salaryman&quot; Shohei Sugiyama (Kōji Yakusho) has a house in the suburbs, a devoted wife, Masako (Hideko Hara), and a teenage daughter, Chikage (Ayano Nakamura). He works as an accountant for a firm in Tokyo. Despite these external signs of success, however, Sugiyama begins to feel as if his life has lost direction and meaning and falls into depression.

One night, while coming home on the Seibu Ikebukuro Line, he spots an slender woman with a melancholic expression looking out from the window of a dance studio. He doesn&#x27;t know it, but she is Mai Kishikawa (Tamiyo Kusakari), a well-known figure on the Western ballroom dance circuit. Infatuated, he decides on a whim to take dance lessons.

Sugiyama’s life changes once his classes begin. Rather than Mai, his teacher is an older woman, Tamako Tamura (Reiko Kusamura), who becomes an important mentor to him. He meets his classmates: Tōkichi Hattori (Yu Tokui) who joined to impress his wife, and Masahiro Tanaka (Hiromasa Taguchi) who joined to lose weight. He also meets Toyoko Takahashi (Eriko Watanabe), another student. He further discovers that one of his colleagues from work, Tomio Aoki (Naoto Takenaka), frequents the dance studio. Tomio, who is balding and mocked at work for his rigid ways, is revealed to be secretly a long-haired (via a wig) ballroom dancer. Though distant from her, the classes increase his infatuation with Mai. His secret thus becomes twofold: not only must he hide the lessons from his wife, he must also hide them from his friends and colleagues as it is considered embarrassing according to traditional Japanese customs to participate in Western ballroom dance.

Later, after being rebuffed by Mai, Sugiyama discovers to his surprise that his passion for ballroom dance has survived her rejection. Indeed, dance, rather than Mai, has given Sugiyama the meaning in life that he was looking for.

Masako, noticing his odd behavior, believes he is having an affair, prompting her to hire a private detective to follow him. Meanwhile, along with his classmates, Sugiyama enters an amateur competition, only to find out that his wife, having finally learned the truth from the detective (who has now become a devoted fan of ballroom dancing), is in the audience. Surprised by this, he stumbles and nearly knocks his dance partner to the floor. Though he successfully catches her, he accidentally rips the skirt of her dress off. Both leave the contest. Sugiyama later learns that Aoki was disqualified. When Aoki is ridiculed at work after his colleagues read of his failure in the newspaper, Sugiyama stands up and tells them not to mock something they don&#x27;t understand.

At home, Sugiyama tells his family that he has given up dance. A little while later, he is visited by Toyoko and Aoki, who try to get him to return and tell him to come to a farewell party for Mai, who is leaving for Blackpool. They hand him a letter from Mai in which she explains her own past failure at Blackpool, attributing it to her dancing alone and not truly trusting her partner and how working with Sugiyama and Toyoko reinspired her to try again. Sugiyama at last has a real conversation with Masako about what happened, but angrily tells her he is through with dance, even when she asks him to teach her. But he gives in and they reconcile when his daughter Chikage pushes them together and he teaches her some steps. On the way home the next day, he looks out of the train window and sees a sign in the dance studio window “Shall we dance, Mr. Sugiyama”. He changes his mind and heads to the party, arriving in time for the last dance, where Mai will choose her partner. Mai approaches him and asks him “Shall we dance?&quot;.

==Cast==
==Release==
&quot;Shall We Dance?&quot; was released on January 27, 1996, in Japan, where it was distributed by Toho. It was released in the United States by Miramax. The Miramax version was cut to 118 minutes and released on July 4, 1997.

==Reception==
===Box office===
In Japan, the film was a surprise hit and became a social phenomenon, attracting audiences who had not attended the cinema for many years, demonstrating that Japanese films could appeal to a wider audience than just under-12s and over-50s. It earned a distribution income (rentals) of in 1996, making it the second top-grossing Japanese film of the year, after &quot;Godzilla vs. Destoroyah&quot;. &quot;Shall We Dance?&quot; grossed a total Japanese box office revenue of ().

The film performed strongly in American theaters, grossing during its US release. Outside of the United States, the film grossed $33,287,618 internationally in other territories (including Japan), for a worldwide total of .

===Critical response===
Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 90% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 52 reviews. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Elegantly told by director Masayuki Suo and warmly performed, &quot;Shall We Dance?&quot; is a delightful celebration of stepping out of one&#x27;s comfort zone and cutting a rug.&quot; Roger Ebert awarded the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, stating in the &quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot; that &quot;Shall We Dance?&quot; is &quot;one of the more completely entertaining movies I&#x27;ve seen in a while—a well-crafted character study that, like a Hollywood movie with a skillful script, manipulates us but makes us like it.&quot; Critic Paul Tatara noted that &quot;It isn&#x27;t really fair to suggest that the movie&#x27;s main subject is dance, though. As much as anything else, it&#x27;s about the healing powers (and poetry) of simple self-expression.&quot;

===Awards===
Despite claiming unprecedented success in box office and critical acclaim, the movie did not represent Japan in the Academy Awards - it went to &quot;Gakko II&quot;, which ended up failing to secure nomination.

At the Japanese Academy Awards it won 14 awards: Best Film, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Director, Best Editing, Best Lighting, Best Music Score, Best Screenplay, Best Sound, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress, and Newcomer of the Year.

The National Board of Review gave it the award for Best Foreign Language Film.

==Foreign remakes==
&quot;Shall We Dance?&quot; was remade in English by Miramax in 2004 as &quot;Shall We Dance?&quot;, starring Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez in the Yakusho and Kusakari roles respectively. The 2004 remake itself inspired another foreign remake. In 2006, an Egyptian film titled &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; () was released, starring Yousra in Richard Gere&#x27;s role.

<text>Ib Andersen (born 14 December 1954) is a Danish ballet dancer and choreographer. He was principal dancer for the Royal Danish Ballet 1975-1980, for the New York City Ballet 1980-1990, freelancing ballet master 1990-2000 and artistic director of Ballet Arizona 2000-2024.

== Biography ==
===Early days===
Born in Copenhagen, Andersen was first exposed to dance through ballroom dancing. At age 7, he was accepted into the Royal Danish Ballet School, which is attached to the Royal Danish Ballet. There he studied with Kirsten Ralov, Hans Brenaa, Flemming Ryberg, and Vera Volkova. He also studied in Germany, France, and the United States, where he took classes at the School of American Ballet. In 1972, at the age 18, he graduated from the Copenhagen school and was accepted by the Royal Danish Ballet as an apprentice.

===Royal Danish Ballet===
After a year as apprentice at the Royal Danish Ballet, Andersen was in 1973 accepted into its &quot;corps de ballet&quot; and was promoted to principal dancer in 1975, at the age of 20, which made him the youngest principal in the company&#x27;s history.

At the Royal Danish Ballet, Andersen appeared in leading roles in ballets of the 19th century Danish ballet master August Bournonville, such as &quot;Napoli&quot;, &quot;Flower Festival in Genzano&quot;, &quot;Far from Denmark&quot;, &quot;The Kermesse in Bruges&quot; and &quot;A Folk Tale&quot;, as well as in classic ballets such as &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, &quot;Coppélia&quot; and &quot;Giselle&quot;. He also performed in many modern ballets, creating the role of the Boy in the 1976 revival of Rudi van Dantzig&#x27;s &quot;Monument for a Dead Boy&quot; and dancing the part of The Chosen in Glen Tetley&#x27;s radical interpretation of Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Le Sacre du Printemps&quot; in 1978.

===New York City Ballet===
In 1980, George Balanchine invited him to join the New York City Ballet and he had to learn 35 ballets within the first three months of his tenure. Roles that were created for him by Balanchine included &quot;Ballade&quot; (1980), &quot;Robert Schumann&#x27;s Davidsbündlertänze&quot; (1980), and &quot;Mozartiana&quot; (1981). Peter Martins and Jerome Robbins also created roles for him in several works.

After suffering a hip injury in 1988, Andersen returned to the stage but eventually decided to retire from New York City Ballet in 1990, giving his final NYCB performance on 29 June 1990 in Balanchine&#x27;s 1928 &quot;Apollo&quot;. Altogether, Andersen appeared in some sixty ballets during his ten years with the company.

=== Balanchine répétiteur===
After his departure from NYCB, Andersen staged works by Balanchine for ballet companies around the world, having been appointed an accredited Balanchine répétiteur by the George Balanchine Trust. He also staged ballets by August Bournonville, Jerome Robbins and others. In 1999 he staged Giselle for Les Grands Ballets Canadiens, and in 2013 he created a new production of The Kermesse in Bruges for the Royal Danish Ballet.

===Ballet Arizona===
In 2000, after a brief period as ballet master for Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre, Andersen was appointed artistic director of Ballet Arizona, where he for more than 24 years oversaw a repertory of classical and contemporary ballets and also staged many works by Balanchine. He also created a number of original works for the company. In 2024 he stepped down from the role as artistic director and was appointed Artistic Director Emeritus for the company.

===Choreographer===
In 1987, while Andersen was still with NYCB, the Royal Danish Ballet gave him his first choreographic commission, for which he created &quot;1-2-3—1-2&quot;. This was followed by other works for a.o. the New York City Ballet, the Slovenian National Theatre Ballet, the Royal Ballet of Flanders, Les Grands Ballets Canadiens and Pacific Northwest Ballet. From 2000 Andersen created a large number of works for Ballet Arizona.

<doc id="1320624" wikidata="Q313207" url="?curid=1320624" title="Martin Laursen">
<text>Martin Laursen (; born 26 July 1977) is a Danish former professional footballer who played in the centre-back position. He played three seasons for Italian club A.C. Milan, with whom he won the 2003 UEFA Champions League and the 2004 Serie A championship. He also played for Italian clubs Hellas Verona and Parma, and was the team captain of English club Aston Villa. He was most recently the manager of Søllerød-Vedbæk.

Laursen was capped 53 times and scored two goals for the Denmark national team from 2000 to 2008, and he was named 2008 Danish Football Player of the Year. He represented Denmark at the 2000 European Championship, 2002 FIFA World Cup, and 2004 European Championship tournaments.

==Club career==

===Youth career and Silkeborg===
Born in Fårvang near Silkeborg, Laursen started playing football with local amateur club Horn/Fårvang. He started his senior career with nearby top-flight club Silkeborg in the Danish Superliga championship. Laursen made his Silkeborg debut in October 1995, under Silkeborg manager Preben Elkjær. Laursen helped steer Silkeborg to second place in the 1997–98 Superliga season, under new Silkeborg manager Sepp Piontek, as he played 22 games and scored one goal during that season. Laursen played 35 games and scored one goal for Silkeborg in the Superliga from his debut until his last game in June 1998.

===Verona===
After three seasons at Silkeborg, Laursen moved to Italy in August 1998, to play for Hellas Verona in the second-tier Serie B league. The contact with Verona was mediated by former Verona player and Silkeborg manager Preben Elkjær. Laursen was plagued by a knee injury for the majority of his first season at Verona, where the club won promotion to the top-flight Serie A championship. Laursen established himself in the Verona starting lineup during his second season in Italy. He became known as Lionheart Laursen among the Verona fans, describing his courage and great ability to time his headers.

Seeking a high-profile move, Parma made a successful bid of 9,000 million Italian lire (€4,648,112) to sign half of the registration rights of Laursen in June 2000, in a deal including Parma-owned player Anthony Šerić remaining at Verona on loan. Laursen played a further season with Verona. After the 2000–01 Serie A season, Laursen moved to join Parma who acquired the remaining 50% of his registration rights for another 9,000 million Italian lire (€4,648,112), while Šerić in turn made a co-ownership deal with Verona in June 2001, for 2,500 million lire (€1,291,142). Following only three weeks of training at the club, Parma loaned Laursen out before he would play any games for the club.

===A.C. Milan===
In July 2001, Laursen was loaned out to Serie A rivals A.C. Milan, who needed depth in their squad. He started out strong for his new club, scoring two goals in the first four rounds of the 2001–02 Serie A season, and played 22 league games in his first season with Milan. Milan decided to buy him in the middle of the season for a fee of 21.5 billion lire (€11,103,823). In the summer 2002, Milan bought Italian international defender Alessandro Nesta, and Laursen&#x27;s playing time diminished to a combined 20 league games in the next two seasons.

Though winning silverware with Milan in 2003, Laursen did not play in the UEFA Champions League final. He won the Coppa Italia, UEFA Champions League and European Super Cup in 2003, and the 2004 Serie A championship. Due to the presence of Paolo Maldini and Alessandro Nesta, Laursen failed to establish himself in Milan&#x27;s first team in the long run. When Milan bought Dutch international defender Jaap Stam in May 2004, Laursen left the club shortly thereafter.

===Aston Villa===
On 21 May 2004, Laursen was bought by FA Premier League side Aston Villa for a fee of £3 million, on a four-year contract. His debut with Villa came against Southampton on 14 August, a match which ended 2–0 in Villa&#x27;s favour. Laursen&#x27;s time at Villa initially proved frustrating. He put in a few encouraging performances on and off, during the 2004–05 season, but the knee injury that plagued him earlier in his career returned and kept Laursen at playing only one Premier League game for Aston Villa during the 2005–06 season. After a re-occurrence of the knee injury during the summer 2006 off-season, his playing future at club and international level was seen to be in doubt.
He underwent a full rehabilitation in Bologna, and returned to the Villa side in August 2006. Villa hired Martin O&#x27;Neill as manager in August 2006, and he and Laursen came to an understanding of giving Laursen the freedom to train as he wanted, which helped prevent further injuries. Laursen became an integral part of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s plans, and the physical English playing style proved to suit Laursen perfectly. Laursen became an effective goalscorer for Villa during the 2007–08 season, scoring six goals from his position of centre-back. This included three goals against Tottenham Hotspur, two of which came in a thrilling 4–4 draw at White Hart Lane, the other coming in a 2–1 home victory. Laursen agreed terms on a new two-and-a-half-year deal with Aston Villa in January 2008. He played all Villa&#x27;s matches, except for League Cup games, during the 2007–08 season and he was voted the Supporters&#x27; Player of the Year in 2008.

Laursen replaced Gareth Barry as club captain for Villa on a permanent basis for the 2008–09 season. In Aston Villa&#x27;s first game of the 2008–09 season, Laursen captained the side in the UEFA Intertoto Cup, and continued his goal-scoring record from set pieces by scoring Villa&#x27;s second goal in the 2–2 draw against Danish team Odense. Laursen also managed to get onto the scoresheet in a UEFA Cup match with Hafnarfjörður, and against Stoke City in the Premiership. On 23 October 2008, Laursen gave Aston Villa the lead in the UEFA Cup game against Ajax with a header from close-range. Villa went on to win the match 2–1. He was named 2008 Danish Football Player of the Year in November 2008.

In December 2008, Laursen was injured again. He returned for the game against West Bromwich Albion in January 2009, but suffered an injury relapse. In April 2009, O&#x27;Neill expressed his fears that Laursen&#x27;s career might be over due to the injuries which, even if treated, would require ten months of reconvalescence. In May 2009, Laursen announced his decision to retire from football rather than undergo major surgery. 24 May saw Aston Villa&#x27;s final game of the season at home to Newcastle United. Prior to kick-off, Laursen appeared in front of the Villa Park crowd and gave a speech where he thanked the fans and wish them well for the future. Following this, he was inducted into the &quot;Villa Legends&quot; section of Aston Villa&#x27;s official website.

==International career==

While playing for Silkeborg, Laursen played one game for the Denmark under-19 national team in December 1996. He was called up for the Denmark under-21 national team in February 1997, and went on to play 14 games for the under-21s until June 1999. Laursen made his debut for the senior Denmark national team in a friendly match against Portugal in March 2000. He was a part of the Denmark squad at the UEFA Euro 2000, though he did not play a single game at the tournament due to injury.

Laursen&#x27;s breakthrough with the national team came at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, when he played full-time in all four Denmark games before elimination. Laursen scored his first goal for his country in September 2003, in the UEFA Euro 2004 qualification, an all-important goal in injury time of the penultimate qualification match. His goal levelled the game with Romania to 2–2, and kept Denmark in the race for a place at the final competition. Laursen and the Denmark team secured qualification when they drew the last game, thus winning their qualification group. Laursen played full-time in Denmark&#x27;s four games at the tournament, playing impressively.

After the March 2005 game against Kazakhstan, Laursen&#x27;s national team career went on a hiatus, due to a knee injury. After his absence from the Danish national team for more than one and a half years, he was called up in November 2006, but had to withdraw from the team before the game due to yet another knee injury. In June 2007, Laursen returned to Denmark&#x27;s starting line-up in a 2–0 win against Latvia. He played his last international game on 11 October 2008 against Malta. In January 2009, Laursen announced his retirement from international football, as he found it physically straining to play for both club and country.

==Retirement==
Laursen returned to Denmark following his retirement, settling in Vedbæk. He worked as a football pundit for Sky Sports briefly, and also as a co-commentator for Danish broadcaster TV2. The former defender told the website of previous club Aston Villa that his primary focus was to spend time with his family; a career in the football media allows him to remain active in the game whilst not taking up too much time. However, he refused to rule out a career in coaching or management in the future.

==Managerial career==
In September 2011, Martin Laursen took the job as head coach of Søllerød-Vedbæk in the Danish 2nd Divisions in order to start a managing career. He resigned on 14 June 2012 after steering the club clear of relegation.

<text>The Buriganga (, &quot;Buŗigônga&quot;, ) is a river in Bangladesh which flows past the southwest outskirts of the capital city, Dhaka. It ranks among the most polluted rivers in the country.

== Importance ==
The Buriganga is economically very important to Dhaka. Launches and country boats provide connection to other parts of Bangladesh, a largely riverine country.

== Pollution ==

In the 20th century the water table and river became polluted by polyethene waste and other hazardous substances from demolished buildings near the river banks.

The Buriganga river now ranks among the most polluted rivers in the country. The chemical waste of mills and factories, household waste, medical waste, sewage, dead animals, plastics, and oil are some of the Buriganga&#x27;s many pollutants. The city of Dhaka discharges about 4,500 tons of solid waste every day, and most of it is released into the Buriganga. According to the Bangladesh Department of Environment, of toxic waste are released into the river by the tanneries every day. Experts identified nine industrial areas in and around the capital city as the primary sources of river pollution: Tongi, Tejgaon, Hazaribagh, Tarabo, Narayanganj, Savar, Gazipur, Dhaka Export Processing Zone and Ghorashal. Most of the industrial units of these areas have no industrial wastewater treatment plants of their own.

According to the Dhaka Water and Sewerage Authority (WASA), about of untreated wastewater are released into the lake from Tejgaon, Badda and Mohakhali industrial areas every day. The wastewater mostly comes from garment washing and dyeing plants. Textile industries annually discharge as much as 56 million tonnes of waste and 0.5 million tonnes of sludge. Sewage is also released into the Buriganga.

Because of Dhaka&#x27;s heavy reliance on river transport for goods, including food, the Buriganga receives especially high amounts of food waste since unusable or rotting portions of fruits, vegetables, and fish are thrown into the river.

==History==

According to R. C. Majumdar, in the distant past, a course of the Ganges river probably used to reach the Bay of Bengal through the Dhaleshwari River. The Buriganga originated from the Dhaleshwari in the south of Savar, near Dhaka 

When the Mughals made Dhaka their capital in 1610, the banks of the Buriganga were already a prime location for trade. The river was also the city&#x27;s main source of drinking water.

<doc id="1320650" wikidata="Q181555" url="?curid=1320650" title="Crimes and Misdemeanors">
<text>Crimes and Misdemeanors is a 1989 American existential comedy drama film written and directed by Woody Allen, who stars alongside Martin Landau, Mia Farrow, Anjelica Huston, Jerry Orbach, Alan Alda, Sam Waterston, and Joanna Gleason.

The film was met with critical acclaim, receiving three Academy Award nominations: Allen, for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay, and Landau, for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Several publications have ranked &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot; as one of Allen&#x27;s greatest films.

==Plot==
The story follows two main characters: Judah Rosenthal, a successful and reputable ophthalmologist, and Clifford Stern, a small-time documentary filmmaker.

Judah, an upper class respected family man, is having an affair with flight attendant Dolores Paley. After it becomes clear to her that Judah will not end his marriage, Dolores threatens to disclose the affair to Judah&#x27;s wife, Miriam. She is also aware of some questionable financial deals Judah made before becoming a wealthy ophthalmologist, which adds to his stress. He confides in a patient, Ben, a rabbi who is rapidly losing his eyesight. Ben advises openness and honesty between Judah and his wife, but Judah does not wish to imperil his marriage. Desperate, Judah turns to his brother, Jack, a gangster, who hires a hitman to kill Dolores. Before her corpse is discovered, Judah retrieves letters and other items from her apartment in order to cover his tracks. Stricken with guilt, Judah turns to the religious teachings he had rejected, believing for the first time that a just God is watching him and passing judgment.

Cliff, meanwhile, has been hired by his pompous brother-in-law, Lester, a successful television producer, to make a documentary celebrating Lester&#x27;s life and work. Cliff grows to despise him. While filming and mocking the subject, Cliff falls in love with Lester&#x27;s associate producer, Halley Reed. Despondent over his failing marriage to Lester&#x27;s sister Wendy, he woos Halley, showing her footage from his ongoing documentary about Professor Louis Levy, a renowned philosopher. He ensures Halley is aware that he is shooting Lester&#x27;s documentary merely for the money so he can finish his more meaningful project with Levy.

Cliff learns that Professor Levy, whom he had been profiling for a documentary centered on his philosophical views and the strength of his celebration of life, has committed suicide, leaving a curt note that only says: &quot;I&#x27;ve gone out the window&quot;. When Halley visits to comfort him, he makes a pass at her, which she gently rebuffs, telling him she is not ready for another romance. Cliff&#x27;s dislike for Lester becomes evident during the first screening of the film. Cliff has maliciously edited the film, which juxtaposes footage of Lester with clownish poses of Benito Mussolini addressing a throng of supporters from a balcony. It also shows Lester yelling at his employees and clumsily making a pass at an attractive young actress. Lester fires him.

Adding to Cliff&#x27;s burdens, Halley leaves for London for a Producer position. When she returns several months later, Cliff is astounded to discover that she and Lester are engaged. Hearing that Lester sent Halley white roses &quot;round the clock, for days&quot; when he unexpectedly met her in London, Cliff is crestfallen as Halley falling for Lester is his “worst fear realized.” His last romantic gesture to Halley had been a love letter which he had mostly plagiarized from James Joyce, including references to Dublin.

Judah and Cliff meet by happenstance at the wedding of the daughter of Rabbi Ben, who is Cliff&#x27;s brother-in-law and Judah&#x27;s patient. Judah has worked through his guilt and is enjoying life once more; the murder had been blamed on a drifter with a criminal record. He draws Cliff into a supposedly hypothetical discussion that draws upon his moral quandary. Judah says that with time, any crisis will pass; but Cliff morosely claims that “very few guys could live with that on their conscience.” Judah cheerfully leaves the wedding party with his wife, and Cliff is left sitting alone, dejected.

The wedding party continues. Rabbi Ben, who is now blind, shares a dance with his daughter while the voice of Professor Levy is heard, saying that the universe is a dark and indifferent place which human beings fill with love, in the hope that “future generations will understand more.”

==Production==
After viewing the first cut of the film, Allen decided to throw out the first act, call back actors for reshoots, and focus on what turned out to be the central story.

===Music===
Allen makes use of classical and jazz music in many of the film&#x27;s scenes. The soundtrack includes Franz Schubert&#x27;s String Quartet No. 15 (a recording by the Juilliard String Quartet), which is used in the scenes leading up to Dolores&#x27; death, and Judah discovering her body.

===Influences===
The outline of Judah&#x27;s moral dilemma—whether a person can continue everyday life with the knowledge of having committed murder—evokes the pivotal idea of Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; (1866), despite suggesting a resolution nearly opposite to that of the novel. Allen would revisit the theme in his films &quot;Match Point&quot;, &quot;Cassandra&#x27;s Dream&quot;, and &quot;Irrational Man&quot;.

Though normally a fierce critic of Allen&#x27;s work, John Simon of &quot;National Review&quot; declared the film to be &quot;Allen&#x27;s first successful blending of drama and comedy, plot and subplot&quot;, and added: &quot;Variety&quot; gave the film a more mixed review, however, writing, &quot;Woody Allen ambitiously mixes his two favoured strains of cinema, melodrama and comedy, with mixed results in &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanours&quot;.&quot;

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for three Academy Awards: Allen for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay, and Martin Landau for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.

In &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2008 poll of &quot;The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot;, &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot; was ranked number 267. In 2010, it was the first film to win the 20/20 Award for Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay (Allen), and Best Supporting Actor (Landau). It also received three additional nominations, for Best Director (Woody Allen), Best Supporting Actor (Jerry Orbach) and Best Supporting Actress (Huston). In a 2016 &quot;Time Out&quot; contributors&#x27; poll, it ranked second only to &quot;Annie Hall&quot; among Allen&#x27;s efforts, with Dave Calhoun praising it as &quot;the film in which Woody&#x27;s comic and serious sides most comfortably align&quot;. The film achieved the same rank in a 2016 article by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; critics Robbie Collin and Tim Robey, who wrote, &quot;Here [Allen is] thinking deeply about moral choice, the question of whether guilt in your own eyes or the eyes of the world matters more. This bubblingly wise film, rich with beautifully dovetailing metaphors about blindness and conscience and the perils of self-knowledge, [...] is Allen on soaring form, gliding so elegantly through its maze of ideas it&#x27;s as if the spirit of Fred Astaire gave it lift-off.&quot; &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot; was also named Allen&#x27;s second best by Chris Nashawaty of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; and Barbara VanDenbergh of &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot;, third by Darian Lusk of CBS News, and fourth by Zachary Wigon of &quot;Nerve&quot;. In a 2015 BBC critics&#x27; poll, it was voted the 57th greatest American film ever made.

In October 2013, the film was voted by &quot;The Guardian&quot; readers as the third best film directed by Allen.

<doc id="1320659" wikidata="Q2059219" url="?curid=1320659" title="O Rappa">
<text>O Rappa was a Brazilian reggae rock band from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Combining many styles such as rock, reggae, funk, hip hop and samba, Many of O Rappa&#x27;s songs contain sharp protests against the social problems in Brazil and the members of the band themselves are supporters of numerous social projects.

==History==
In 1993, reggae artist Papa Winnie came to Brazil but had no band to play shows with him. He immediately picked four people: Nelson Meirelles, Marcelo Lobato, Alexandre Menezes and Marcelo Yuka as the band. After Papa Winnie&#x27;s shows, the four decided to stay together picking Falcão as the 5th member and vocalist.

In 1994, they released their first album, on WEA, &quot;O Rappa&quot;. It was initially only known to small groups within the working class suburbs of Rio de Janeiro. In 1996 the album &quot;Rappa Mundi&quot; was released. Most of the music was a success, especially the cover of &quot;Hey Joe&quot;, a song made famous by The Jimi Hendrix Experience.

However it was not until the third album &quot;Lado B Lado A&quot; in 1999, that O Rappa gained widespread fame selling over 150 000 copies of that album. Their video clip for their song Minha Alma (&quot;My Soul&quot;) was also held in high regard winning many MTV Brasil&#x27;s Vídeo Music Awards.

In November 2000, drummer Marcelo Yuka was shot during a robbery. He tried to avoid the assault by slamming his car against the bandits. The incident left him a paraplegic and he was forced to leave the band. He was replaced by Marcelo Lobato.

In August 2001, the group released its first live album, &quot;Instinto Coletivo ao Vivo&quot;. It featured a couple of tracks recorded in the studio with the participation of Sepultura and Asian Dub Foundation.

On 7 July 2007, O Rappa performed at the Brazilian leg of Live Earth in Rio de Janeiro.

In 2008 they released &quot;7 Vezes&quot;. In 2010, was released their third live album and third DVD, &quot;Ao Vivo na Rocinha&quot;, which was recorded during a concert at Rocinha, Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s largest favela. The album featured the band&#x27;s biggest hits as well as many b-side tracks.

Considered by many as the most iconic and respected contemporary Brazilian band, they&#x27;re consistent on their work. Capable of bringing many rhythms together and combining it into unique melodies that are impossible to label. Their rock and reggae influences are clear but other elements added to the melodies give the band the status of pioneers.

On May 3, 2017, the group announced on Facebook that after the end of their tour in February 2018, it will pause with no current plans to return.

<text>Yosef Shlomo Kahaneman (; ; , known also as the Ponevezher Rav), was an Orthodox rabbi and rosh yeshiva (dean) of the Ponevezh Yeshiva. He was also a member of the Council of Torah Sages of Agudath Israel.

== Biography ==

Kahaneman was born 13 May 1886 in Kuliai, Kovno Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Lithuania), a town of about 300, of whom about a third were Jewish.

As a child he attended the yeshiva in Plungė led by Rabbi Chaim Yitzchak Bloch Hacohen. At the age of 14 he went to study Talmud at the Telshe yeshiva, where he studied Torah until he was twenty, under rabbis Eliezer Gordon and Shimon Shkop. He then spent half a year in Novardok yeshiva, after which he spent three years in Raduń Yeshiva studying under the Chofetz Chaim and Rabbi Naftoli Trop.

He married the daughter of the rabbi of Vidzh, and became rabbi there at the end of 1911, when his father-in-law became the rabbi of Vilkomir (Ukmergė). His nephew was Daniel Kahneman, a psychologist and economist.

After Rabbi Yitzhak Yaakov Rabinovich died in 1919 Kahaneman was appointed the new rabbi of Ponevezh. He built three yeshivas there, as well as a school and an orphanage. All of these institutions were destroyed, and many of his students and family killed, during World War II.

He was elected to the Lithuanian parliament. He was also a member of the autonomous National Council of Lithuanian Jewry and an active member and leader of Agudat Yisrael.

The outbreak of World War II caught him during his visit to the British Mandate of Palestine, after which he was intending to visit the United States. Learning about the Red Army&#x27;s occupation of Lithuania, he decided to stay in Palestine. He continued, from a distance, to oversee the Ponevezh Yeshiva. After the entrance of the Nazis in Ponevezh, the yeshiva was destroyed and all students were murdered. A few years later, in 1944, Kahaneman succeeded in re-establishing the Ponevezh Yeshiva in Bnei Brak. After unsuccessful attempts to save European Jews, Kahaneman focused on developing communities in Palestine, building &quot;Kiryat Ha-Yeshiva&quot; (&quot;Town of the Yeshiva&quot;) in Bnei Brak and &quot;Batei Avot&quot; orphanages. He also traveled widely in the diaspora to secure financial support for the yeshiva, which he constantly improved and extended. With the help of longtime friend Rav Moshe Okun, Kahaneman succeeded in turning the re-established Ponevezh yeshiva into one of the largest in the world- a leading one among the Litvishe.

He sought to take care of many orphans, especially the &quot;Yaldei Tehran&quot; (&quot;Children of Tehran&quot;) – children who escaped from Nazi Europe by walking across Europe to Tehran - as well as other refugees, among them Biala Rebbe – Rabbi Ben Zion Rabinowitz.

Kahaneman died on 3 September 1969 in Bnei Brak, Israel. After his death the Ponevezh Yeshiva community divided into two over the conflict on leadership.

Kahaneman wrote Talmudic commentaries and an exegesis on the Passover Haggadah, though these - together with transcripts of his lessons - were published only after his death.

=== Opinion on State of Israel and Zionism ===
In contrast to the prevalent Haredi opposition to Zionism, Kahaneman showed signs of support for the State of Israel. He considered the establishment of the State of Israel to have religious significance, especially after the experience of the Holocaust, believing it was God&#x27;s plan. He is known for insisting that the flag of Israel be flown outside of the Ponevezh Yeshiva on Israel&#x27;s Independence Day. He also refrained from saying the Tachanun prayer - a daily prayer of penitence - on that day, as a sign of celebration.

He said in an article that Israel&#x27;s military victories during the Six Day War &quot;obvious miracles&quot;, and that &quot;even blind people can sense palpable miracles... the miracles, wonders, salvations... the comforts and battles&quot;. Kahaneman opposed the idolization of the Israeli warrior, seen as tough in contrast to Holocaust victims seen as enfeebled.

<doc id="1320665" wikidata="Q614610" url="?curid=1320665" title="Good Bye, Lenin! (soundtrack)">
<text>Good Bye, Lenin! is the original soundtrack album of the film of the same title starring Daniel Brühl and Katrin Sass.
The music is composed by Yann Tiersen, with the exception of the non-instrumental version of &quot;Summer 78&quot; sung by Claire Pichet.
This album has been released with the Copy Control protection system in some regions.

==Analysis==
Parts of the soundtrack are reminiscent of Yann Tiersen&#x27;s best known film work, the &quot;soundtrack for Amélie&quot;, which was in turn strongly influenced by French music. In fact, one of the songs on &quot;Amélie&quot;, &quot;Comptine d&#x27;un autre été : L&#x27;après-midi&quot;, was also used on &quot;Good bye, Lenin!&quot; during the scene of the family&#x27;s first East-West Berlin outing, although it does not appear on the soundtrack album.

<doc id="1320680" wikidata="Q5570634" url="?curid=1320680" title="Global Analyst Research Settlements">
<text>The Global Analyst Research Settlement was an enforcement agreement reached in the United States on April 28, 2003, between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (NASD), New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), and ten of the United States&#x27;s largest investment firms to address issues of conflict of interest within their businesses in relation to recommendations made by financial analyst departments of those firms.

== Decision ==

The central issue at hand that had been judged in court was the conflict of interest between the investment banking and analysis departments of ten of the largest investment firms in the United States. The investment firms involved in the settlement had all engaged in actions and practices that had allowed the inappropriate influence of their research analysts by their investment bankers seeking lucrative fees. A typical violation addressed by the settlement was the case of CSFB and Salomon Smith Barney, which were alleged to have engaged in inappropriate spinning of &quot;hot&quot; initial public offerings (IPOs) and issued fraudulent research reports in violation of various sections within the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Similarly, UBS Warburg and Piper Jaffray were alleged to have received payments for investment research without disclosing such payments in violation of the Securities Act of 1933.

== Enforcement actions ==

As part of the settlement decision published on December 20, 2002, several regulations designed to prevent the abuse stemming from pressure by investment bankers on analysts to provide &quot;favorable&quot; appraisals were instantiated. Namely, these firms would have to literally insulate their banking and analysis departments from each other physically and with Chinese walls. Additionally, budget allocation via management in research departments will be independent of investment departments. Research analysts will also be prohibited from going on pitches and roadshows with bankers during advertising and promotion of IPOs. Similarly, the Global Settlement also increased the IPO &quot;quiet period&quot; from 25 days to 40 days. Finally, research analyst&#x27;s historical ratings must be disclosed and made available.

Other than these regulatory actions, the firms involved in the settlement have been required to pay fines to their investors, to fund investor education, and to pay for independent third-party market research. A total fine of $1.435 billion was assessed and is described in the table below.

<doc id="1320700" wikidata="Q4908796" url="?curid=1320700" title="County State-Aid Highway 12 (Cook County, Minnesota)">
<text>County State-Aid Highway 12 (CSAH 12), also known as the Gunflint Trail, or County Road 12 (CR 12), is a paved roadway and National Scenic Byway in Cook County, Minnesota, that begins in Grand Marais and ends at Saganaga Lake in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW), near the U.S. border with Ontario. It provides access to many of the entry points in the BWCAW.

==Route description==
Originally a footpath for travelers from inland lakes to Lake Superior, the trail was eventually widened into a roadway, and designated as County Road 12 (CR 12). It now serves as a route to lodges, outfitters, hiking trails and the lakes and rivers of the BWCA. A small number of people, numbering in the hundreds, have full-time residences or businesses along the road, though thousands have cabins or other part-time residential properties.

The route begins at Highway 61 in Grand Marais. It travels generally northward until Northern Light Lake, where it turns northwestward, following the Brule River. It crosses the Brule and continues north-northwest along Swamper Creek, gradually arcing westward and running along the northern shore of Poplar Lake. The road continues west past several lakes including Birch, Mayhew, and Loon before reaching the access roads to Gunflint Lake. The route turns north near Round Lake and travels several miles to Sea Gull Lake, where it turns west again to its terminus at Saganaga Lake.

==History==
The footpath was improved into a dirt road by Cook County in the 1890s to support the Paulson Mine. In the 1920s, local business owners paid for some improvements to the road; by 1957, it was paved from Grand Marais to Hungry Jack Lake. The last gravel section, south of Sea Gull Lake, was paved in 1979.

The road was designated a National Scenic Byway in 2009.

===Ham Lake Fire===
The Ham Lake Fire of spring 2007 severely impacted the Upper Gunflint Trail, burning over in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area and Ontario&#x27;s Quetico Provincial Park. The fire lasted several weeks and claimed almost 200 structures, although no one was seriously injured or killed. It was started accidentally by an unattended campfire at a campsite on Ham Lake. The fire drew national attention and a visit from Governor Tim Pawlenty, who inspected the damage first-hand. Despite the significant damage to the forest, most outfitters and commercial businesses have reopened and access to the region&#x27;s lakes has resumed.

===The Old Gunflint Trail Post Office===

Located along a portion of the &quot;Old Gunflint Trail&quot;, the post office was originally located in the Voyagers Inn and run by its first postmaster George Stapleton. It was later purchased by Lawrence F. Wooding (Gus) in the early 1950s and came to be known as &quot;Woody&#x27;s Place&quot;.

==Geography and tourism==
Glaciers created the area&#x27;s geographical features, forming basins running east to west with the region&#x27;s bedrock, and when they retreated, lakes formed. The Ojibwa and French explorers found chert, which produces sparks, at Gunflint Lake and gave the trail its name. In contemporary times, both fire and wind put stress on the area.

The Ojibwa built a village that is now Grand Marais, which became a trading post and a center for logging and commercial fishing. The town today is home to artists and artisans, and tourists who visit for the Gunflint Trail&#x27;s canoe routes, hiking, fishing and of trails for cross-country skiing.

==Flora and Fauna==
Grouse, white-tailed deer, black bear, moose, fox, snowshoe hares, wolves, lynx and pine marten inhabit the surrounding forest which comprises spruces, fir, pines, birch and aspen. Lake trout, walleye, northern pike, and bass inhabit the many lakes along the Gunflint Trail.

<text>Seatoun is an eastern suburb of Wellington, the capital city of New Zealand and lies on the east coast of the Miramar Peninsula, close to the entrance to Wellington Harbour (Port Nicholson).

== Geography ==
The suburb sits on an exposed promontory close to Barrett Reef, a dangerous area of rocky shallows upon which many ships have foundered.

Seatoun as a suburb looks out on to Steeple Rock/Te Aroaro-o-Kupe, a large rock at the west of the Wellington Harbour entrance, rising above sea level.

== History ==
The traditional Māori name for the Seatoun area is &quot;.&quot; It is where the mythical Polynesian navigator, Kupe, is said to have first set ashore on his voyage to New Zealand, around 1000–1300 BC. Kupe is also said to have named the foreshore &quot;,&quot; after the rattling and rumbling caused by the waves disturbing gravel on the beach.

The first settlement of the surrounding area was by Māori, led by the semi-mythical explorer Tara, or more fully Tara-Ika i Nohu, who also gave his name to what&#x27;s now Wellington (as &quot;Te Whanganui a Tara&quot;, or The Harbour of Tara) and the iwi Ngāi Tara. Tara settled Matiu/Soames Island around 1100-1300 AD with an estimated 200 people. The group was broken into two, with one of these establishing a pā, named &quot;Te Whetū Kairangi&quot;, which takes its name from &#x27;whetū&#x27; (meaning star) and &#x27;kairangi&#x27; (meaning exalted or high status), overlooking Worser Bay.

Much of what now comprises Seatoun did not exist as accessible land when first settled by Māori, which along with defense helps to explain why early pā in the area occupy hillside or hilltop sites. At the time, what is now the Miramar Peninsula was disconnected to the mainland and existed as a separate island within the harbour, known after the first pā as &quot;Te Motu Kairangi&quot; (or &quot;The Exhaulted Island&quot;). Much of modern Seatoun then emerged, and the island was connected to the land, when lifted from the sea by the Horowhenua earthquake of 1460.

A second pā was constructed in the area during the 1700s, on headland at the entrance to the harbour, in what is now the Oruaiti Reserve. Tradition records that it was built by Te Rerewa of the Rangitane iwi, and that it was once attacked by Māori from Whanganui with some 500 being routed and killed at nearby Worser Bay. The site is site is marked today by a 17-metre long sculpture of a &#x27;waka&#x27; (traditional canoe), constructed in 2013.

The modern name &quot;Seatoun&quot;, originally &quot;Seatown&quot;, comes from a settlement in Forfarshire, Scotland, linked with the family history of James Coutts Crawford, the suburb&#x27;s founder. Coutts Crawford was amongst the first permanent European settlers in Wellington. He arrived in September 1839 and set up a farm on the Miramar Peninsula. He named his holdings Overtoun and Seatoun, after family holdings of the Crawford family in Scotland. The area between Nevay and Karaka Bay roads and the old hilltop pa site was first called the Township of Overton.

Amongst the first people to settle the coastline area at what is now Seatoun was James Heberley. Heberley lived with his family at what became Worser Bay. He became pilot at the request of Colonel William Wakefield, who references him in his book &quot;Adventures in New Zealand&quot;, piloted the ‘Tory’ into Wellington and drowned at Picton in 1899. The bay was originally called Young&#x27;s Bay, after a whaler, George Young, who lived in the area around 1834/5. It became Worser Bay after the nickname of Heberley. There are two origin stories for his nickname ‘Worser’. The first is that the correct spelling of his name was Hebley and that he changed it after sending £50 to pay for a brother to come out from England only to find another unwanted, &#x27;worser&#x27;, brother sent in his place. The second is that Heberley, as a pilot, was known for always stating that the weather was getting ‘worser and worser’.

The first school in the district was opened in 1897 in the Church Hall in Beach Road, with a roll of sixteen students. Seatoun School was established in 1921, separated from Worser Bay to accommodate growing demand.

European settlement properly began in Seatoun around 1899, although still constrained at that point by the fact that the area was accessible only by boat. A tunnel was constructed between 1906 and 1907, linking the settlement to nearby Strathmore Park and Miramar. This enabled the expansion of the suburb by connecting it to the city centre by electric tram. The tunnel measured 144m (470 feet) long, and 8.2m (27 feet) wide. At the time it opened it was said to be ‘the widest tunnel in Australasia’. The historian John Struthers established that the population of Seatoun was less than 1,000 at the time. 

In 1911, shortly after the suburb became accessible by tunnel, Fort Dorset, a military base, was built to protect the entrance to Wellington Harbour. This followed construction of a two-gun battery on the top of the ridge at Point Dorset in 1908. It would operate for almost a century before being closed in 1991 and largely demolished in 1998. What remained was used in 1999 as the set for the town of ‘Bree’ and ‘The Prancing Pony Inn’ for the several night shots in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; before final redevelopment as Seatoun Primary School in 2002.

In 1917, &quot;The New Zealand Index&quot; proclaimed Seatoun to be:

“A suburb of Wellington, at the Heads. Six miles southeast by daily ferry steamer (8 pence return) or by electric car (tram) from Welington . It is part of the Miramar borough. A favourite seaside resort. No hotel, but good boarding accommodation, stores, tearooms, post and telephone office. One mile from Worser Bay. Electric car opened to Seatoun on December 18, 1907. Nearby is the site of the Oruaiti pa, famous in Māori history. Favourite picnic resort is Breaker Bay, a few minutes walk from here.”

By 1926, Seatoun was still in need of investment. Residents complained about open drains, said the streets had not been maintained since they were built and pointed out a third of the houses in were without proper roads or footpaths.

The settlement&#x27;s first church service was organized in 1910 in a room at a butcher&#x27;s shop on Worser Bay. This continued until 1913 when a group of 14 local residents raised funds for the construction of a Presbyterian church on Ventnor Street. That original building now serves as Seatoun Village Hall. It was replaced in 1932 by a new church, St Christopher&#x27;s, designed by William Fielding, which was opened by the Governor General, Lord Bledisloe. The church contains the &#x27;Wahine Cross&#x27;, made from wood salvaged from the wreck of the TEV Wahine. The parish was closed in 2013 and the building sold in 2015 to local benefactors who now operate it as a community facility.

The Anglican church of St George was established on Ferry Street in 1946, with the current building, containing striking floral stained-glass windows, constructed in 1957.

The suburb played an important role in the sinking of the inter-island ferry TEV Wahine in 1968, when the ship foundered off the shoreline. Only the four starboard lifeboats could be launched. One lifeboat was swamped shortly after leaving the sinking ship and its occupants were tossed into the sea. Of the other three, one landed at Eastbourne and two at Seatoun. Churchill Park in Seatoun contains a memorial to the disaster. The memorial is formed from one of the Wahine&#x27;s anchor and chains, with each link in the chain representing the victims of the tragedy. The area also contains replica ship ventilators and visible to the east is Steeple Rock, only a few hundred metres from shore, where the Wahine capsized and sank.

<text>The AXE telephone exchange is a product line of circuit switched digital telephone exchanges manufactured by Ericsson, a Swedish telecom company. It was developed in 1974 by Ellemtel, a research and development subsidiary of Ericsson and Televerket. The first system was deployed in 1976. AXE is not an acronym, but an Ericsson product code.

The AXE is the digital successor to the AKE analogue telephone exchange and ARF/ARM family of crossbar switches. The design is modular with an APZ dual processor running in sync mode, an APT switching part and an APG I/O part. It is used for connecting local landlines, operating mobile networks (TDMA, GSM, CDMA, W-CDMA, PDC), international telephony traffic and signaling.

AXE based equipment are being used as BSC/TRC, MSC, HLR, SCP, FNR, TSC, STP and wireline nodes.

The brain of the AXE system is a dual processor system called APZ. It runs in parallel sync mode making it fault redundant. The family of APZs started with APZ 210 03 in 1976; the latest one is APZ 214 03. The parallel sync mode was partly abandoned in the APZ 212 40 and subsequent models and has been replaced with a warm standby scheme.

The latest APZ type is 214 03 which is used as MSC, TSC and HLR Blade in AXE. The latest implementation of AXE is on a blade cluster system capable of handling up to 8 million subscribers.

The core of the switching part was the Group Switch, initially a time-space-time multiplexer capable of switching up to 64K positions or connections. This Group Switch later evolved to a Distributed Group Switch using Time-Space switching technique with a maximum capacity of 512K.

AXE nodes have evolved as a traffic controller, having the new Media Gateway node running on CPP platform handle the payload traffic.

Ericsson AXE telephone exchanges support lawful intercepts via the remote-control equipment subsystem (RES), which carries out the tap, and the interception management system (IMS), software used for initiating the tap, which adds the tap to the RES database. In a fully operating lawful interception system the RES and IMS both create logs of all numbers being tapped so that system administrators can perform audits to find unauthorized taps.

Code is written in PLEX (a proprietary programming language tied to the AXE hardware, designed by Göran Hemdahl), SDL and ASA210C programming languages. Code for Regional Processors (controlling hardware Extension Modules) is written in ASA210R.

AXE switches used in the United Kingdom are sometimes referred to as System Y as they were the first competitive alternative to the domestically developed System X digital switching system.

<text>István Dobi (; 31 December 1898 – 24 November 1968) was a Hungarian communist politician who was Prime Minister of Hungary from 1948 to 1952 and Chairman of the Presidential Council of the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic from 1952 to 1967.

==Early life==
Dobi originated from a poor peasant family and was born in Szőny, in the Komárom County of the Kingdom of Hungary. He completed only six years of primary school and started working as a day laborer from an early age. In 1916 he came into contact with the agricultural workers&#x27; movement. After having fought in the First World War, he supported the Hungarian Soviet Republic. During the Hungarian–Romanian War of 1919 he was captured by the Romanians.

Upon his release, he worked as a casual laborer and became active in the agricultural workers&#x27; union as well as in the Social Democratic Party of Hungary from the early 1920s. For this, he was put under police surveillance. In 1936 he switched to the Independent Smallholders&#x27; Party and became a functionary in the Kisalföld Chamber of Agriculture. Although he was not a member of the Communist Party, he was arrested several times during the regency of Miklós Horthy.

==World War II==
During the war he became one of the leaders of the Hungarian resistance until he was called up for duty, returning in the summer of 1945.

==Post war==
By the end of World War II he had become a leading member of the Smallholders Party, which achieved a majority in the 1945 general elections. Dobi was a member of the left-wing faction of that party, and advocated cooperation with the communists.

With the Smallholders being a part of Hungary&#x27;s post-war coalition government, Dobi served as Minister of Agriculture from February 1946 to November 1946 (under prime minister Ferenc Nagy) and again from April 1948 to December 1948 (under Lajos Dinnyés). As a leading member of the Smallholders&#x27; left wing, Dobi contributed some much needed legitimacy to a government that was increasingly dominated by Communists. After several splits and the expulsion, arrest or exile of anti-communist members (&quot;salami tactics&quot;), Dobi was elected chairman of the Smallholders Party in June 1947. The party concluded an alliance with the communists, social democrats and National Peasant Party for the rigged 1947 parliamentary election.

Due in part to his support for the Communists, he replaced fellow Smallholder Lajos Dinnyés as prime minister in December 1948, helping preside over the final stage of the Communists&#x27; complete takeover of the country. In short order, Dobi removed those elements of his party who were unwilling to do the Communists&#x27; bidding, leaving the party in the hands of fellow travelers like himself. This process was also repeated with the other non-Communist parties.

Thus, by the time of the 1949 elections, Hungary was effectively a one-party state. The 1949 elections formalized this status, with voters only having the option of approving or rejecting a Communist-dominated list. One of the first acts of the newly elected National Assembly was to approve a Soviet-style constitution, formally marking the onset of total Communist rule in Hungary. The Smallholders&#x27; Party was effectively disbanded.

In terms of allegations of collaboration with the party, the New Hungarian Encyclopedia summed up Dobi&#x27;s role in the Communist takeover in this way: &quot;Following the ousting of the Smallholders Party right wing elements, he was selected to be president. Under his direction the party was cleansed of its reactionary elements and it became part of the program for building a people&#x27;s democracy with the Communists.&quot;

==Presidency of the People&#x27;s Republic==
In 1952, he gave up the prime ministership because Communist Party leader Mátyás Rákosi wanted that post for himself. Dobi was then promoted to Chairman of the Presidential Council, a post equivalent to that of president. He held this post until his retirement in April 1967. While the presidency was largely a ceremonial post, he took on numerous other high-profile roles to eventually become the second or third most powerful man in Hungary. He supported the crushing of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Having been a &quot;crypto-communist&quot; for many years, Dobi formally joined the Hungarian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party in 1959. He was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize in 1962. He died in Budapest in 1968.

<doc id="1320748" wikidata="Q636636" url="?curid=1320748" title="Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val">
<text>Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val (; , before 1962: &quot;Saint-Antonin&quot;) is a commune in the Tarn-et-Garonne department in the Occitanie region in southern France.

Having played an influential and somewhat bellicose role in the history of the region from the 12th to the 17th centuries, it then declined economically and as a result has preserved largely the medieval core which has many listed buildings and is now a major tourist attraction. Its Sunday market is extensive and draws visitors and locals alike. It is a member of the Cittaslow movement.

==Geography==
Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val is situated in the gorge of the Aveyron river at the confluence of the Bonnette, overlooked by the limestone cliffs of the Roc d&#x27;Anglars. It is located at the edge of Rouergue where the Albigeois lands border with Quercy, to the north of the forest of Grésigne. It lies on one of the ancient pilgrim routes to Santiago de Compostela.

==History==
The area has been occupied for over 10,000 years, as evidenced by the archaeological discoveries at the nearby Upper Palaeolithic (Magdalenian) site of Fontalès.

The town is named after Antoninus of Pamiers, who brought Christianity to the Rouergue. He was martyred c. 305 when, following this success, he then tried to convert Pamiers, his home town in the Pyrenees. His remains were believed to have been interred on the site of the town, an abbey was founded in the 8th century by Festus, the local ruler of what was then known as &quot;Vallis Nobilis&quot;.
The abbey was expanded by the Benedictines in the 11th century, and it was finished around 1150. By the end of the 12th century it passed into the control of Augustinian Canons Regular. The monastery was destroyed in 1570 during the wars of religion when the church was burned down, the exercise of the Catholic religion was outlawed, and the city became one of the strongholds of the reformists. Today there are only a few surviving fragments, but corbels possibly from the former abbey&#x27;s collegiate church adorn several buildings.
Saint-Antonin had one of the first hospitals in the region, founded by the 8th century. Reformists also burned down that building in 1575.

From the 9th century, Saint-Antonin was ruled by one of the first nobles in the area to hold the title of viscount. They were powerful lords of Rouergue, but vassals of the count of Toulouse. The last independent viscount ceded all his rights to the King of France in 1249.

Saint-Antonin reputably has the oldest town hall in France. The first recorded mention of the &quot;New House&quot; - which served as a lordly residence and court house - dates from 1155. In 1212 it was bought by the consuls (town councillors) and referred to as &quot;La Maio del Cossolat&quot;. The consuls had vacated it by 1791 and it now houses a local museum.

The former castle of Vallette (&quot;castrum vallatum&quot;) was built in 1180 by Fortuné de Valletta, son of viscount Archambauld, who died in the Holy Land in 1190. This castle was located on top of a steep cliff overlooking the Aveyron, its ruins were still visible in the nineteenth century, when it was also known as the &quot;Château de Bône&quot;. (The Vallette family gave their name to the Maltese capital Valletta, which was founded by the Grand Master of the Order of Malta, Jean Parisot de Valette.)

The Canal du Bessarel was constructed in the 13th century to service a water-mill and other industries such as the tannery, whose site remains.

===The Albigensian Crusade===

In 1209, the viscounts of Saint-Antonin embraced Catharism. Pope Innocent III authorised a crusade against the Cathars, and the bishop of Puy placed Saint-Antonin under siege. The inhabitants resisted for some time, but were finally forced to capitulate and pay a considerable ransom. The Cathars took control again a short time later, but in 1211 Simon de Montfort seized it again. A little later, Sant-Antonin and nearby Guépie sought the protection of the count of Toulouse, sponsor of the Albigeois, who installed Adhemar de Jourdain as governor. Montfort, indignant at these frequent infidelities, marched to Saint-Antonin from Albi, determined to retake it permanently. The bishop of Albi, who led the vanguard of the army, arrived before him and urged the inhabitants to submit. Montfort set up camp outside the town and was attacked that evening by the inhabitants. The sergeants of his army repelled them and attacked the town, without the participation of their generals. After an hour&#x27;s fighting, they had taken three small outer towers. The inhabitants started to flee through a gate opposite the camp. The crusaders pursued them and helped themselves to everything they came across. At midnight, viscount Pons, judging that the town would inevitably be taken the next day, sent Montfort a conditional offer to surrender, which was refused. The crusaders entered the town early next morning and sacked the place. Pons, the governor and several other knights were taken to Carcassonne, and locked in a tiny cell.

Louis VIII resolved to march in person against the Cathars in 1226, and sent Hebrard, a knight templar, to take possession of the town on his behalf and receive the oath of allegiance of the inhabitants. The oath was sworn by the twelve consuls, the prior and all residents over fifteen years old. After taking the oath, they begged Sir Hébrard not to tell anyone, lest the count of Toulouse find out before the arrival of the King and come to ravage their lands. They also asked him to intercede for them with the cardinal legate, who accompanied the King, to remove the interdict over the town. The King, the following January, sent letters of guarantee to Paris confirming the town&#x27;s customs and privileges.

In 1229, when Louis IX made peace with Raymond VII of Toulouse, he wrote to the various lords of Rouergue, who had sworn fealty to his father, and ordained them to take an oath of loyalty to &quot;his dearest cousin and vassal Raimond, count of Toulouse&quot;, thus ending the conflict.

===The Hundred Years War===

During the Hundred Years&#x27; War the Plantagenets first seized Saint-Antonin in about 1345, but the count of Armagnac, governor of the Languedoc drove them out. In 1352, the Plantagenets took the town again, and from here ravaged the area of Toulouse.

Armagnac undertook the reconquest of Saint-Antonin, but his enemy the Count of Foix made raids into the lands of Armagnac and forced him to give up for a time. He resumed the siege in the following February, and as it dragged on he entrusted it to Arnaud de Pressac, marshal of his forces, so that he could travel to Najac where he had summoned the representatives of the towns in the Languedoc to raise funds. The steward of Carcassonne pledged ten sous per hearth, which was worth 72,000 livres, Beaucaire also provided 24,000 deniers d&#x27;or à l’écu, and the town of Nîmes gave 400 gold crowns, provided that the number of its consuls could be increased to six.

These funds, combined with those of the stewards of Rouergue and Quercy who also contributed, formed a much larger sum than was necessary for this enterprise. Armagnac immediately positioned himself before Saint-Antonin, resolved to make every effort to drive out the English. He ignored a six-month truce agreed between France and England with effect from 1 March 1353. But all his efforts, and the funds he had raised in the lands under his control, became useless, because of the peace negotiated between the two courts, and the English remained masters of Saint-Antonin for the next several years.

In 1382, Toulouse and several other towns, including Saint-Antonin, revolted against the duke of Berri, the King&#x27;s commander in Languedoc. Immediately the capitouls of Toulouse sent Saint-Antonin an armed garrison under the pretext of defending them against the English, who still occupied nearby Laguépie. The King&#x27;s troops laid siege to the town once again; but in 1388, they paid 240 francs in gold to avoid punishment for joining with the rebel communities.

===The French Wars of Religion===

When religious fanaticism rekindled in Rouergue in the 16th century, as a result of the new doctrines of Luther and Calvin, Saint-Antonin was one of the first to declare for the Protestants, and it quickly became one of their main bastions. It was at the center of their meetings, of their deputations to the King, and of their leadership. If an expedition were to be undertaken against Catholics in the neighbourhood, it was the Protestants of Saint-Antonin who directed and executed the enterprise.

When 70 or so Protestants of nearby Gaillac assembled in 1561 for the Lord&#x27;s Supper, the inhabitants of the district of Orme, backed by a company of regular troops, took them prisoner. They took them to the terraces of Saint-Michel Abbey, above the banks of the Tarn, where a labourer named Cabrol, dressed in the cloak and hat of a local judge and assisted by a lawyer named Pousson, condemned them to be thrown down from the terrace into the river, telling them to eat fish since they had not fasted during Lent. Boatmen in the river battered to death those who were able to swim. In the meantime, the remaining Protestants in the town were massacred. In 1568 Protestants from Saint-Antonin resolved to take revenge. They gathered their brothers from Millau and Montauban, and seized Gaillac, looting and killing indiscriminately, and setting fire to the neighbourhood where Catholics were taking refuge. Cabrol was taken to the rocky terrace of the abbey and thrown into the river and they hanged Pousson. This is just an example of the excesses that were committed in these times of fanaticism, during which Saint-Antonin felt the effects more than once.

The collegiate church was destroyed sometime after 1614, and Saint-Antonin was again besieged in 1621 by Louis XIII in person. He was camped outside Montauban, which was controlled by Protestants, when he learned that Saint-Antonin was sending 1,200 men to rescue the town. He arrived at Saint-Antonin on 13 June and forced it to surrender. Twelve inhabitants were put to death, all the fortifications and walls were destroyed, and the town was ordered to pay a sum of 50,000 crowns to avoid being pillaged.

===Subsequent developments===

Louis XIV renamed the town Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val and financed major improvements. It became an important supplier of leather and linen. In 1681, Protestants were excluded from politics and the town council, but the town still has a Protestant &quot;temple&quot;. After this period, the town gradually lost its privileges and its influence declined. For a while after the French Revolution, the town was renamed Libre-Val, but soon reverted to Saint-Antonin.

On the creation of the French departments, Saint-Antonin was incorporated into the Department of Aveyron, but was seconded to the Tarn-et-Garonne Department in 1808 by Napoleon. In 1962, &quot;Noble-Val&quot; was appended to the town&#x27;s name once more.

Today, Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val still has an authentically medieval layout, the streets and many facades of the town centre having hardly changed over 800 years. It features a range of stone arched and half-timbered houses and covered walkways listed in the French national heritage records.

===Civil monuments===

* The Old Town Hall (&quot;Maison des Consuls&quot;), built in 1125 for Archambault and subsequently the residence of the ruling viscounts before becoming the seat of the consuls in 1313. The facade features two carvings of very high quality; Adam and Eve with the serpent under the tree of knowledge, and the Emperor Justinian as law-giver, bearing a staff surmounted by the Imperial Eagle and holding an inscription which reads: &quot;it is meet that his Imperial Majesty should be empowered not just by force of arms but also by the power of Justice&quot;. Eugène Viollet-le-Duc undertook its restoration in 1846 with the help of the architect Théodore Olivier. It now houses Saint-Antonin&#x27;s charming old-fashioned museum.
* In addition to the Old Town Hall, several houses are designated as Monument historique:
** The Caserne des Anglais (&quot;English Barracks&quot;) house, rue Guilhem-Peyré, was a base for English troops from 1352 to 1354, and eventually became a royal barracks. In 1685, dragoons were based here. After the Revolution, it was converted into a town house. The building has two stone levels topped by a third of half-timbered brick. The street facade is pierced by two entrances; the pointed arch on the left dates from the 13th or 14th century, and the simple moulded arch to the right features a 17th-century wooden door. Three mullioned windows illuminate the first floor (end 15th - early 16th century). Wooden galleries crown the top floor.
** The Muratet house is an interesting example of medieval civil construction. Partly built in the early 13th century and enlarged in the 15th, the original building was probably a farmhouse. The façade, despite changes in the 19th century, retains its ashlar dressing and all the elements needed to understand its original order: three levels bordered by projecting moulded string courses (the first string based on a series of carved corbels); a series of arches on the lowest level (ground floor shops); two rows of four double windows in a pointed arch, connected by transom strings. At the end of the 15th century, the pointed arcades on the ground floor were replaced by segmental arches and a door lintel decorated with an ogee arch. Most double casement windows were transformed into quads. The elevation facing the courtyard was rebuilt with rubble at the end of the 15th century. The first floor consisted of two rooms separated by a wood-framed cob wall, supported by a central masonry pillar. Important remnants of a mural depicting griffins on interlaced medallions and an upper frieze of heraldic knights, dating to the first half of the 13th century are preserved on this wall. A spiral staircase with load-bearing core is built into an oval shell half protruding through the side façade, starting from the street. With its ogee-arched front door and various openings, its construction can be dated to the late 14th or early 15th century. It is considered to be one of the first examples of the spiral staircases which gradually replaced older square staircases of wood or stone in Saint-Antonin.
** The Le Maréchal house, rue Cayssac: is a 13th-century building which gives an insight to the layout of a medieval residence. It consists of two structures at right angles to each other, with a wine cellar, two residential floors and an attic. Originally the house spanned an alley. On the first floor is a double window which is decorated with plants and false masonry and has window seats. Indentations indicate the position of ropes that supported curtains to divide the room.
** The Leris house, place de la Halle, is an interesting example of a 15th-century commercial building façade. At street level it has a door and wide low and moulded arches. In courtyard, the façade has two doors and the stone work is adorned with abundant mouldings and carved pinnacles. In the courtyard, another door is surmounted by a shield supported by two monsters with human heads and griffins&#x27; feet, and surrounded by a garland.
** The Ave Maria house, rue des Carmes, was the seat of the Brotherhood of the Virgin. The front door has an inscription engraved on pilasters up to the horizontal mullion: &quot;Ave Mar. Gra. Pln. Na&quot;. It has an intact suite of four windows forming the first floor gallery. These cross-mullioned windows are separated by pilasters with pseudo corinthian capitals.
** The Amour house appears to date from the 14th century. It has a ground floor built of stone, topped by a three-storey brick-filled timber frame slightly jettied from the ground floor. The ground floor is broken by three bays. The front door is flanked by two low arches corresponding to former shops. The one on the right has a two-headed keystone of a man and woman kissing. This house was a brothel in the Middle Ages, which no doubt links to the sign.
** The Nut Oil Mill, in place Bessarel, is a much altered 15th century stone and half-timbered building. The ground floor has a 19th-century vertical stone mill wheel which crushed the nuts. Pivoting on a bed of stone, powered by a donkey or a horse, this granite millstone created a paste. This was then heated over low heat in a copper cauldron and then passed under a press consisting of a beam of about five metres, fixed to a frame, having its axis of rotation at one end and a screw capstan the other end, and producing a pressure of approximately 30 tons for 20 kg of nuts under the third of the beam near the axis of rotation.
* Other houses not registered or classified as historical monuments that are of architectural interest:
** the house known as the King&#x27;s (&quot;Maison du roy)&quot;, in place de la Jogaria
** the 13th century stone house at 14 rue Guilhem-Peyre
** the wood-framed house at 53 rue Droite
** houses in the street of Porte de Rodanèze
** an inn or passage house (L&#x27;Auberge du Lion D&#x27;Or) situated in the Rue de Bombecul / Rue Basse Des Carmes
** the Sonnets house
* Market hall
* Bridge over the Aveyron
* Former spa building
* &quot;Le Querlys&quot; Cinema
Of the former tanneries that were situated along the Bonnette river, there are only a few buildings.

<text>Ngaio (, colloquially ,) is an inner suburb of Wellington, the capital city of New Zealand. It is situated on the slopes of Mount Kaukau, 3500 metres north of the city&#x27;s CBD. It was settled in the 1840s and many of its streets are named after early settler families. Ngaio was originally a logging community known first as &quot;Upper Kaiwarra&quot;, then as &quot;Crofton&quot; until 1908. The area was administratively part of a separate local authority called the Onslow Borough Council which amalgamated with Wellington City in 1919.

Ngaio takes its name from a New Zealand native tree, the ngaio.

==Facilities==
Ngaio contains a library, multi-purpose hall, pharmacy, petrol station, two cafés, Plunket rooms, dentist, medical centre, tennis courts and a variety of small shops.

Ngaio&#x27;s dwellings are a mix of ages and styles, including original colonial buildings built in the 1860s, railway cottages and bungalows built in the 1920s and 30s, and 1960s weatherboard houses. The Tarikaka Settlement is a small area of former railway cottages built in 1928 on Tarikaka Street, Bombay Street, Carroll Street, Khandallah Road, Ngata Street, Raihania Lane and Pomare Street.

===Library===
Wellington City Libraries operates Cummings Park Library which is situated at the south entrance of Cummings Park on Ottawa Road. Opened in 1989, and refurbished in 2008, the library&#x27;s entrance is paved with 850 tiles made by local potters Paul Winspear and Paul Wotherspoon and decorated by children from Ngaio and Chartwell Schools.

The library&#x27;s Māori name is Korimako, named after the Korimako stream that runs through Ngaio.

The library offers internet access, free Wi-Fi, word processing, printing and faxing. The library collection includes a special collection of local oral history, detailing the memories of prominent Ngaio locals.

Regular preschool and educational programs are run during the week including Baby Rock &amp; Rhyme for babies (aged 0 to 2 years), storytime for children aged 3 – 4 and Kōhunga Kōrero: Pakiwaitara i roto i te reo Māori – monthly storytime in te reo Māori for children aged 2–6 years old.

===Town hall===

The Ngaio town hall offers a venue for community services, sports, performances, cultural and private events. The hall contains a stage, kitchen, drop in centre and the Ngaio toy library. The hall has a capacity of 300 people and has an accessible entry ramp at the front. The hall was opened in 1924 and was renovated in 1989.

Groups that regularly use the hall include:
*Bodh Gaya Buddhist Centre
*Ngaio Badminton Club
*Ngaio Drop In Centre
*Ngaio Toy Library
*Onslow Table Tennis Club
There is also occasionally a book sale there, organised by the Blue Dragon Children&#x27;s Foundation, a non-governmental organisation.

===Parks and reserves===

Trelissick Park runs from the bottom of the Ngaio Gorge road and runs across the borders of nearby Wadestown and Crofton Downs. The area acts as an ecological corridor between the Harbour and the northern suburbs. The park has historic gunpowder magazines built in the 1870s. While the park contains areas of original forest remnant, it is also under on-going restoration work led by the Trelissick Park Group that was set up in 1991. Since then, over 80,000 trees have been planted in the area, along with weed management, trapping and bridge building.

Orleans Makererua reserve runs from Makererua street to Orleans street and has remnants of the native bush that was originally throughout Ngaio.

Cummings park is off Ottawa road and has a children&#x27;s playground and dog exercise area.

==Transport==
The suburb is served by the Johnsonville Branch commuter railway which connects it to the central city. There are two railway stations in Ngaio; Ngaio railway station and Awarua Street railway station.

Buses operate two bus routes through Ngaio; numbers 25 and 26. Route 22 is operated by NZ Bus

===Ngaio Gorge===

Ngaio Gorge is the main road between Ngaio and Wellington city and is a key transport route in the event of an earthquake. The road is described as a &quot;primary access road for the Onslow area&quot; and a &quot;critical escape route from the city should Ngauranga Gorge become impassable&quot; by Onslow-Western Ward Councillor, Simon Woolf. Heavy rains in July 2017 resulted in a large landslide, with boulders and rubble completely covering the road. In the following weeks, 3500 cubic metres of rubble were cleared and a temporary 42 metre long shipping container wall was installed to protect the road from further slips. A temporary road next to Trelissick Park was created to handle uphill traffic when the main road was reduced to one lane. The Wellington City Council planned to extend the shipping container wall in preparation for construction of a permanent solution in late 2019.

Also the Onslow Community Church which has a recently built modern hall in Ngatoto Street near the Ngaio/Khandallah boundary.

==History==

===Pre 1840: Tarikākā===
The area that modern day Ngaio occupies was originally called &#x27;Tarikākā&#x27; by Māori, which means &#x27;nest of the kākā&#x27;, named after the noisy parrot that lived in the area. The area was not occupied by Māori, but many Māori tracks ran through the area, including what became the Old Porirua Road. And a track to the ancient Ohariu Pā on Mākara Beach, from today&#x27;s Awarua Street.

===1840–1858: Upper Kaiwharawhara ===
The area was named Upper Kaiwharawhara or Upper Kaiwarra in the 1840s by Captain Edward Daniell who purchased 2,500 acres from the NZ company after selling his commission. In 1845, Daniell built a house in the area near the current Trelissick Crescent and called it &quot;Trelissick&quot; after his old family property in England. Daniell built the &#x27;Bridle Trail&#x27; (now part of the Old Porirua Road, the original road north) from his property down through current Kaiwharawhara to the harbour. An agreement was made between Daniell and four sawyers in 1842 to allow them to build the Kaiwara saw mill on his property. The mill was built close to the present day junction of Crofton Road and Kenya Street. A recent subdivision built off Old Porirua road honoured Daniell by naming the road leading to it &#x27;Captain Edward Daniell Drive&#x27;.

The mill was described by Edward Jerningham Wakefield in his book, &quot;Adventure in New Zealand from 1839 to 1844: With Some Account of the Beginning of the British Colonization of the Islands&quot;:

&quot;In the bottom of a thickly wooded valley, only accessible over a steep ridge, a natural fall in the narrow rocky gully of the stream afforded great facilities for erecting a dam. A platform and rough shed extended from side to side of the gully over the dam-head; the wheel and machinery were working underneath; and two or three circular saws were kept in constant employment. The open sides of the workshop displayed this curious work of art in the midst of nature&#x27;s wildest scenery... The stern craggy sides of the gully might be imagined to frown upon so strange a neighbor as the fretting wheel. Two or three log-huts under the forest sent up their curl of smoke; while the neat housewives, with their flaxen-haired children, stood at the doors to receive with joyful pride the praises bestowed by visitors on the untiring industry of their husbands.&quot;

The mill was taken over by John Chew in 1863, who built a cottage made of local tōtara, rimu and kauri. Chew Cottage still stands today at 19 Ottawa Road which is the now the main road in Ngaio after starting life as the track for John Chew&#x27;s timber.

===1858: Crofton===
In 1858, the area was renamed Crofton, after the house built by Sir William Fox on Kenya Street (at the time called Daniell street). Sir William Fox eventually became New Zealand Premier on three separate occasions. The land and house owned by Fox were sold in 1862 to Charles Abraham, Bishop of Wellington. It was then sold to an Anglican minister Henry Woodford St Hill, and was converted into an Anglican boarding school called Crofton College, with Hill as its first headmaster. The college drew pupils from leading Wellington families and the southern half of the North Island. The school closed around 1875. The college was later sold to Wilson Littlejohn, who would eventually become mayor of Onslow Borough Council. The building that was Crofton College is still occupied at 21 Kenya Street, having survived two fires.

===1886: the railway arrives ===
The opening of the railway to Wellington in 1886 (see Johnsonville Branch) enabled people to commute into Wellington, and the line was electrified with more frequent and faster trains in 1938.

===1870–1890: Toll gate dispute===
The Kaiwara Road (also known as the Ngaio Gorge Road and Kaiwharawhara Road) was built in 1850 to allow for bullock trains to transport wool and wood. In the mid 1870s, the Hutt City Council constructed a toll gate at the harbor end of road, which was the only road in or out of the area. Funds collected from the gate – one shilling for vehicles and half for saddled horses, were supposed to be used to repair the road, however residents believed the toll was being used to pay for roads further north, such as the Rimutaka road, due to the poor condition of Kaiwarra road.

The toll dispute started when a group of firemen were forced to pay the toll when returning from a fire. A petition was signed by 150 people, and a number of people ended up in court after refusing to pay the toll. The toll gate was destroyed twice by angry mobs until 1890 when the residents broke away from the Hutt City Council to form Onslow Borough Council, made up of Kaiwarra, Khandallah, Wadestown and Ngaio.

===1890: Onslow Borough===
Ngaio was part of the new Onslow Borough from 1890 until 1919, when the borough was amalgamated with Wellington City following a referendum on 31 March 1919. The Borough was named after Lord William Hillier Onslow, who was Governor of New Zealand of the time. This was to placate his family who were appalled with the city&#x27;s sanitation after his young son Cranley caught typhoid shortly after moving to Wellington. The Borough included the townships of Kaiwarra, Khandallah, Crofton, and Wadestown. In 1896, the Borough had an estimated area of 2,870 acres, a population of 1,530 and 276 dwellings.

=== 1908–present ===
As a suburb in Marton was already called &quot;Crofton&quot;, the suburb&#x27;s name was changed to &#x27;Ngaio&#x27; in August 1908. It is possible that Ngaio was chosen as the ngaio tree was the symbol used by the local Kilmister family for their wool bales.

Ngaio school was first opened in 1908 above the Ngaio railway station. It was subsequently moved to Heke Street in 1911 and finally its present site in 1928.

The opening of the railway to Wellington in 1886 (now the Johnsonville Branch) enabled people to commute into Wellington, and the line was electrified with more frequent and faster trains in 1938.

The population of Ngaio increased from 905 in 1916 to 2,280 in 1938. In 1940 state houses were built over Casey&#x27;s dairy farm in Cockayne Road.

<doc id="1320780" wikidata="Q3039697" url="?curid=1320780" title="Vratnica">
<text>Vratnica () is a small village and community located in the Jegunovce Municipality of North Macedonia. Vratnica lies in the north-west, and is 22 km away from the city of Tetovo and 5 km away from Jažince - the border crossing point with Kosovo. Prior to 2003 Vratnica was the centre of the now disestablished Vratnica municipality.

It is situated in the upper part of the Polog plain, at the foothills of northern part of Šar Mountain, under the Ljuboten peak. The village lies at 700–760 meters above the sea level.

==History==
Vratnica was mentioned for the first time in Ottoman defters (tax registry and land cadastre) dating back to the 15th century. It was recorded that there were about 59 families living in Vratnica. In the defter labeled 4 for the years 1467/68 the number of houses had increased to 66, while in 1545 there is a record of 76 houses, and in 1568 there were 84 houses registered.

The village underwent migrations and settlement until the 18th century, and in the 20th century, there was extensive chain migration to the United States. In 1914/1916, the total population of Vratnica was 1,131 with 131 houses; in 1948, there were 1,299 inhabitants and 197 houses; in 1953, there were 1,387 inhabitants and 214 houses; in 1961, the respective numbers were 1,384 and 227; in 1968, 1,240 and 225; and, in 1971, 1,082 inhabitants and 266 houses.

During the 2001 War between Albanian insurgents and the Macedonian state, Vratnica was besieged by the NLA. In 2005 Albanians opened fire on the local police station.

==Demographics==
Vratnica consists of mainly Macedonians and some Serbs.

The South Slavic-speaking community is divided between Macedonian and Serbian ethnic identification, although the majority identify as ethnic Macedonians, as indicated in the most recent censuses. Most of the Vratnicani who consider themselves to be Serbian reside in the United States; however, there are still many Vratnicani in the United States who are Macedonian. Although all practice Orthodox traditions, the Vratnicani who consider themselves as Serbian in the United States identify as members of the Serbian Orthodox Church, while Vratnicani who are Macedonian identify with the Macedonian Orthodox Church.

In statistics gathered by Vasil Kanchov in 1900, the village of Vratnica was inhabited by 780 Orthodox Bulgarians.

In 1961, there were 1,384 inhabitants living in Vratnica. However, by 1994 the population had decreased to 572, of which 522 were Macedonians, 33 were Serbs, and 17 others.

According to the Macedonian census 2002, the ethnic groups in the village are:
*Macedonians 482
*Serbs 20
*others 3

==Notable people==
Notable people of Vratnican descent.
*Ane Mihailovich, footballer
*Sasho Cirovski, football coach
*Slavko Milosavlevski, sociologist
*Ed Jovanovski, NHL hockey player

==Regular Events==
* Traditional Mayday Tournament &quot;VRATNICA&quot; - (May 1). One of the biggest sport events in the Polog region. The tournament includes football and streetball (basketball) competition. In the past handball was also played.

<doc id="1320782" wikidata="Q5083499" url="?curid=1320782" title="Charles Whitehead">
<text>Charles Whitehead (1804 – 5 July 1862) was an English poet, novelist and dramatist.

Whitehead was born in London, the eldest son of a wine merchant. His most popular works were: &quot;The Solitary&quot; (1831), a poem, &quot;The Autobiography of Jack Ketch&quot; (1834), a novel, &quot;The Cavalier&quot; (1836), a play in blank verse, &quot;Richard Savage&quot; (1842), perhaps his finest novel; and &quot;The Earl of Essex&quot;, an historical romance (1843).

Whitehead recommended Charles Dickens for the writing of the letterpress for Robert Seymour&#x27;s drawings, which ultimately developed into &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;.

Whitehead had problems with alcohol and decided to travel to Melbourne, Australia, hoping for fresh start, arriving in 1857. He already was acquainted with Richard Henry Horne, he befriended James Smith and James Neild and wrote a little for the local press. He applied for admission to the Melbourne Benevolent Asylum in February 1862 in vain; a few months later he was picked up exhausted in a street and taken to the Melbourne hospital, where he died on 5 July 1862 of hepatitis and bronchitis and was buried in a pauper&#x27;s grave.

Mackenzie Bell wrote a tribute to Whitehead, published in 1884 by T. F. Unwin, and also in the same year by Elliot Stock, &quot;Forgotten Genius. Charles Whitehead, a critical monograph&quot;, then a new edition, with added material and an appreciation by Hall Caine, &quot;Charles Whitehead: a Forgotten Genius&quot; (1894), published by Ward, Lock &amp; Co.

<doc id="1320789" wikidata="Q6056204" url="?curid=1320789" title="Interorbital Systems">
<text>Interorbital Systems (IOS) is an American space development company based in Mojave, California. It was established in 1996 by Roderick and Randa Milliron. As of October 2023, the company is in development stage for three orbital launch vehicles: NEPTUNE, TRITON, and TRITON HEAVY. 

Interorbital Systems has participated in the development of a launch vehicle for the Google Lunar X Prize Team Synergy Moon and has provided suborbital commercial launch services. For Orbital launch they have used ISRO and Jaxa. Additionally, the company participated as a competitor in the Ansari X Prize and America&#x27;s Space Prize competitions.

==NEPTUNE Launch Vehicle: General==
The NEPTUNE rocket, a two-stage vehicle design from Interorbital Systems, would use high-performance liquid oxygen and densified propane propellants. The first stage would be equipped with four stationary throttleable ablatively cooled liquid rocket engines, each capable of generating 4,500 pounds of thrust. Throttling of these engines allows for precise control of pitch, yaw, and roll during flight. 

The second stage of the NEPTUNE rocket is proposed to be powered by a single stationary ablatively cooled liquid rocket engine that generates 3,000 pounds of thrust. During the second stage engine burn and while in orbit, pitch, yaw, and roll control would be provided by cold-gas thrusters.

==NEPTUNE Launch Vehicle: Pressure-fed Propulsion System==
The NEPTUNE liquid rocket engines of Interorbital Systems would be fed propellants through a proprietary pressurant system. As a result, the weight of the propellant tank/pressurant system would be equivalent to a traditional propellant tank/pressurant system/pump-fed system.

By removing the propellant pump and the associated heavy electric or gas-generator pump-drive system, Interorbital Systems proposes to significantly reduce both the overall rocket development cost and the manufacturing time. This streamlined approach to the propulsion system is touted as leading to cost savings and improved efficiency in the manufacturing process.

==NEPTUNE Launch Vehicle: Exclusive Ocean-based Launch==
All Interorbital Systems (IOS) rockets are described as being launchable from an ocean barge equipped with motion compensation technology. Initially, IOS plans to conduct orbital flights from the Pacific Ocean southwest of Los Angeles.

In 2006, IOS held an active launch license from the Office of Commercial Space Transportation for Tachyon, a sounding rocket designed for suborbital flights reaching an apogee of 120 miles.

===Preliminary design concepts===
Solaris was a suborbital rocket design developed by IOS in the early 2000s. The intention behind the Solaris project was to compete for the Ansari X Prize. However, the rocket was not completed in time, and it was surpassed by Scaled Composites&#x27; SpaceShipOne, which successfully claimed the prize.

=== Milestones ===
The main engine of the Common Propulsion Module (CPM) underwent its first successful static engine firing on October 28, 2012. This composite chambered engine generated 7,500 pounds of thrust and used nitric acid and turpentine propellants.

The Common Propulsion Module Test Vehicle (CPM TV) completed its inaugural test flight on March 29, 2014, achieving a maximum altitude of 10,000 feet. The payloads on board included two CubeSats, a payload from Synergy Moon, and a music CD titled &quot;ENCLOSURE&quot; by John Frusciante, former guitarist of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The CPM TV will be reused for future test flights, and all payloads were successfully recovered without damage.

=== Satellite kits ===
The CubeSat Personal Satellite Kit is available in two configurations: a standard 1 kg (2.2 lb) version and a non-standard 1.33 kg (2.93 lb) version. These kits are constructed using an aluminum frame and are designed for conducting simple experiments, as well as for receiving and transmitting radio signals. They may also be used for personal purposes.

The TubeSat Personal Satellite Kit offers an alternative to CubeSats. These kits are constructed entirely from printed circuit boards.

According to their claims, the kits will be launched into self-decaying orbits at an altitude of 310 km (192 mi), eventually burning up in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The company has a significant number of launches planned for both types of satellites.

== Google Lunar XPrize ==
Interorbital Systems became a member and launch provider for Team Synergy Moon in the Google Lunar X Prize competition in June 2016. The team proposed using a modified version of the NEPTUNE rocket consisting of 36 modules to transport their lunar rover to the surface of the Moon.

<doc id="1320795" wikidata="Q4704680" url="?curid=1320795" title="Al Rantel">
<text>Alfred Anthony Quarantello Jr. (born October 14, 1955), better known by his professional name Al Rantel, is an American conservative talk show host. Rantel&#x27;s most recent contract was with KABC radio, Los Angeles, California. He retired for medical reasons in June, 2009. He worked in Florida for many years prior to moving to KABC, and has appeared as a pundit on television news and discussion programs. Rantel received the opportunity to work in Los Angeles at radio station KABC due to the encouragement of another East Coast transplanted talk host, Tom Leykis. Rantel previously worked for Los Angeles station KNX and Florida stations WINZ, WNWS, and WFTL.

==Guests==
Rantel frequently features guests on his program, coordinating a weekly simulcast with British talkSport host Mike Mendoza (despite the fact that Mendoza has compared homosexuality to pedophilia) and often conversing with conservative author Ann Coulter. When Coulter appears, she usually does so in the first segment of the evening program. Democratic strategist Bob Mulholland, Republican strategist Michael Wissot, public-relations guru Michael Levine, and columnists John Leboutillier, Gustavo Arellano and Bruce Bialosky often appear on the program; former California governors Jerry Brown, Gray Davis, and Pete Wilson have made occasional appearances. Despite the numerous appearances of conservatives such as Ann Coulter, the program often features guests with very different opinions than the host. In addition, many guests are authors or leaders of a particular organization.

On the morning program, Newsmax Media writers often appear to discuss various issues with Rantel. Prior to February 27, 2006, his evening show usually ended with a brief conversation with Mr. KABC; this tradition ended with the expanded syndication of Mark Levin on KABC and WABC.

During the 2003 California gubernatorial recall election, Rantel referred to then-Governor Gray Davis as &quot;Governor Lowbeam.&quot; He has since not described Davis by that name; Rantel has also remarked that he respects Davis as a former statesman and values his commentary.

When Rantel is absent, Carol Platt Liebau, Rob Nelson or a KABC colleague hosts the program. Rantel, for his part, occasionally hosted &quot;The Larry Elder Show&quot; when Elder was absent.

==Health issues==
On Jan 23, 2008, Larry Elder read a statement from Al Rantel on the air at 6:30 PM announcing to his listeners that he has been diagnosed with lymphoma and undergoing chemotherapy for it. Al&#x27;s fill-in host Tammy Bruce also made the same announcement in her segment of the show. On May 27, 2008, Rantel returned to the air on KABC.

Rantel suffered another health emergency in August 2008 when he slipped and fell in the parking structure of his apartment building, necessitating hip and shoulder replacement. After yet another extended hiatus from the airways, on Wednesday, June 24, 2009, it was announced, Rantel would be retiring from KABC at his doctor&#x27;s request. On Doug McIntyre&#x27;s morning show, Al shared that he would be moving temporarily to Vancouver, Canada, to rest and recuperate.

==Other information==
Rantel had supported College Republican groups by coordinating live broadcasts on college campuses in Southern California. He was formerly an Advisory Board member of the Bruin Alumni Association, resigning after expressing displeasure with the direction of the group.

On the night of the 2008 presidential election, Rantel announced that he had voted for Democrat Barack Obama, citing his anger with the Republican party and its nominee John McCain as the reason for doing so. Shortly after the announcement, fellow KABC talk show host Larry Elder has referred to Rantel as one half of the Marx Brothers, stating that he believed Rantel didn&#x27;t believe in the conservative principles he professed and that by voting for Obama, he demonstrated more Marxist leanings.

==Controversy==
During a discussion on US airport security on September 10, 2007, Rantel allegedly said that if his mother had to take her shoes off during a security screening, &quot;... then why shouldn&#x27;t a Sikh be required to take off the hat that looks like a diaper ...?&quot; The alleged remark angered the Sikh community, which reportedly planned some public protests.

<doc id="1320802" wikidata="Q3275337" url="?curid=1320802" title="Iodinated contrast">
<text>Iodinated contrast is a form of water-soluble, intravenous radiocontrast agent containing iodine, which enhances the visibility of vascular structures and organs during radiographic procedures. Some pathologies, such as cancer, have particularly improved visibility with iodinated contrast.

The radiodensity of iodinated contrast is 25–30 Hounsfield units (HU) per milligram of iodine per milliliter at a tube voltage of 100–120 kVp.

==Types==
Iodine-based contrast media are usually classified as ionic or nonionic. Both types are used most commonly in radiology due to their relatively harmless interaction with the body and their solubility. Contrast media are primarily used to visualize vessels and changes in tissues on radiography and CT (computerized tomography). Contrast media can also be used for tests of the urinary tract, uterus and fallopian tubes. It may cause the patient to feel as if they have had urinary incontinence. It also puts a metallic taste in the mouth of the patient.

The iodine may be bound either in an organic (nonionic) compound or an ionic compound. Ionic agents were developed first and are still in widespread use depending on the requirements but may result in additional complications due to the high concentration of ions (hyperosmolality). Organic agents which covalently bind the iodine have fewer side effects as they do not dissociate into component molecules. Many of the side effects are due to the hyperosmolar solution being injected. i.e. they deliver more iodine atoms per molecule. The more iodine, the more &quot;dense&quot; the X-ray effect.

Organic iodine molecules used for contrast include iohexol, iodixanol, and ioversol.
Iodine-based contrast media used nowadays are water-soluble. These contrast agents are sold as clear, colorless water solutions, with the concentration usually expressed as mg I/ml. Modern iodinated contrast agents can be used almost anywhere in the body. Most often they are used intravenously, but for various purposes they can also be used intra-arterially, intrathecally (as in diskography of the spine) and intra-abdominally – just about any body cavity or potential space.

Heating non-ionic contrast agent to human body temperature reduces its viscosity.

The amount of iodine administered in children in the United States in 2010 was 272 to 740 mg/kg for CT scan.

Iodine contrast agents are used for the following:
* Contrast CTs
* Angiography (&quot;arterial investigations&quot;)
* Venography (&quot;venous investigations&quot;)
* VCUG (&quot;voiding cystourethrography&quot;)
* HSG (&quot;hysterosalpingogram&quot;)
* IVU (&quot;intravenous urography&quot;)

==Adverse effects==
Iodinated contrast agents may cause allergic reactions, contrast-induced nephropathy, hyperthyroidism and possibly metformin accumulation. However, there are no absolute contraindications to iodinated contrast, so the benefits needs to be weighted against the risks.

Hypersensitivity towards iodinated contrast agent is associated with increase in histamine and tryptase concentration in blood. Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) 50 mg orally or intravenously one hour before contrast administration can reduce the risk of urticaria, angioedema, and respiratory symptoms.

An observational study conducted across 133,331 patients concluded that iodinated contrast injected through veins has more hypersensitivity reactions than when injected through arteries. However, the cause for this phenomenon is unknown.

In people with myasthenia gravis, older forms of iodinated contrast have caused an increased risk of exacerbation of the disease, but modern (low-osmolar) forms have no immediate increased risk.

===Hypersensitivity reactions===
Anaphylactoid reactions occur rarely, but can occur in response to injected as well as oral and rectal contrast and even retrograde pyelography.
They are similar in presentation to anaphylactic reactions, but are not caused by an IgE-mediated immune response. Patients with a history of contrast reactions, however, are at increased risk of anaphylactoid reactions.
Pretreatment with corticosteroids has been shown to decrease the incidence of adverse reactions.

Anaphylactoid reactions range from urticaria and itching, to bronchospasm and facial and laryngeal edema. For simple cases of urticaria and itching, an oral or intravenous antihistamine such as diphenhydramine is appropriate. For more severe reactions, including bronchospasm and facial or neck edema, albuterol inhaler, or subcutaneous or IV epinephrine, plus diphenhydramine may be needed. If respiration is compromised, an airway must be established prior to medical management.

Anaphylaxis to ionic (high osmolar) contrast agent injections occurred in two clusters of reactions on two occasions (1983 and 1987) in a single radiology clinic in London, Ontario. On each occasion, these anaphylactic reactions were associated with contamination of the injection by natural rubber components (disposable plastic syringes in the first case and rubber ampoule seals in the second case). The allergenic-toxic rubber leachate was MBT (mercaptobenzothiazole). This is a known allergen that becomes bound to plasma proteins, creating a hapten-protein complex – a signature mechanism in true IgE drug allergy and true anaphylactic reactions (not &quot;anaphylactoid&quot; reactions).

A Japanese syringe manufacturer, Terumo, implicated in syringe-related toxic laboratory cell culture effects in Australia in 1981, was instrumental in pro-actively making Japanese disposable syringes and ampoule seals free of natural rubber. Katayama&#x27;s 1990 article in &quot;Radiology&quot; showed that a new type of nonionic (low osmolar) contrast agent was associated with significantly fewer severe life-threatening reactions than the older ionic (high osmolar) contrast agents. By merchandizing the Katayama series reprints, manufacturers persuaded users worldwide to switch to the almost exclusive use of the expensive nonionic agents.

What was unknown to the Katayama researchers was that the ampoule seals of the &quot;safer&quot; nonionic contrast agents were made from artificial rubber, whereas the ionic agents were sealed with natural rubber. In 1987, it was the leaching of allergenic MBT from the rubber seals of ionic ampoules that caused a series of allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis) in a radiology office in Canada. The worldwide hazard of MBT contamination of injections was unknown then and, as the World Health Organization reported it remains as an unknown hazard still – after three decades.

The most significant study, proving that injections of ionic (high osmolar) agents are at least as safe as the newer, very expensive nonionic agents was published in &quot;Radiology&quot; in 1997. Lasser did not comment that the marked drop in the incidence of severe reactions with ionic agents was related to the removal of natural rubber contamination from ionic ampoule seals.

====Contribution of seafood and other allergies====
The term &quot;iodine allergy&quot; should be omitted because this kind of allergy does not exist. Seafood &quot;allergy&quot; is not a contraindication for the use of iodinated contrast materials, because in seafood allergy the immune system is directed against the muscle protein tropomyosin. While iodine levels in seafood are higher than in non-seafood items, the consumption of the latter exceeds that of the former by far and there is no evidence that the iodine content of seafood is related to reactions to seafood. Available data suggest that seafood allergy increases the risk of a contrast-mediated reaction by approximately the same amount as allergies to fruits or those with asthma. In addition, those with an intolerance to alcohol should avoid use of this product due to chemical breakdown similar to ethyl alcohol. Studies show that B.A.C. has been shown to increase exponentially for up to 72 hours after contrast is administered, resulting in altered results of urine, blood, and breath alcohol screens. Those with history of severe contrast reaction will have six-fold increase risk of adverse reaction. Those with history of asthma will have six-fold increased risk to low-osmolar contrast media and 10-fold increased risk to high-osmolar contrast media.

Over 85% of patients with seafood allergies will not have an adverse reaction to iodinated contrast. Finally, there is no evidence that adverse skin reactions to iodine-containing topical antiseptics (e.g., povidone-iodine) are of any specific relevance to administration of I.V. contrast material.

IL-2 medication poses no risk for the acquisition of adverse events by radiocontrast agents.

===Contrast-induced nephropathy===

Contrast-induced nephropathy is defined as either a greater than 25% increase of serum creatinine or an absolute increase in serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL. Iodinated contrast may be toxic to the kidneys, especially when given via the arteries prior to studies such as catheter coronary angiography. Nonionic contrast agents, which are almost exclusively used in CT scans, have not been shown to cause CIN when given intravenously at doses needed for CT studies.

===Effects on thyroid function===

Iodinated contrast media exposure can potentially cause incident hyperthyroidism and incident overt hypothyroidism.&quot; Hyperthyroidism is the effect of iodine being a substrate of thyroid hormones, and is then called the Jod-Basedow phenomenon. The risk is higher in those with an underlying thyroid disease, such as toxic multinodular goiter, Graves&#x27; disease, or Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis, where thyroid monitoring is indicated. Otherwise, for the general population, routine screening with thyroid function tests is generally not feasible.

===Drug interactions===
It has been recommended that metformin, an oral antidiabetic agent, be stopped for 48 hours following the intravascular administration of contrast media and that the use of metformin not be resumed until kidney function has been shown to be normal. The reasoning is that if the contrast medium causes kidney failure (as happens rarely) and the person continues to take metformin (which is normally excreted by the kidneys), there may be a toxic accumulation of metformin, increasing the risk of lactic acidosis, a dangerous complication.

However, guidelines published by the American College of Radiologists suggest this is not as important for patients who have normal kidney function and no evidence of acute kidney injury. If kidney impairment is found before administration of the contrast, metformin should be withheld for 48 hours following the procedure and until kidney function has returned to normal.

Contrast exposure may interfere with subsequent radioiodine treatment, causing unwanted delays in the management of thyroid cancer.

Previously, beta blockers have been assumed as risk factor for the acquisition of contrast medium-induced adverse reactions/hypersensitivity reactions. Due to recent investigations it became clear that beta blockers do not increase the frequency of adverse reactions in concert with radiocontrast agents.

===Pregnancy===
Iodinated contrast in medical imaging in pregnancy, when orally administered, is harmless. Intravenous administration of iodinated radiocontrast agents can cross the placenta and enter the fetal circulation, but animal studies have reported no teratogenic or mutagenic effects from its use. There have been theoretical concerns about potential harm of free iodide on the fetal thyroid gland, but multiple studies have shown that a single dose of intravenously administered iodinated contrast medium to a pregnant mother has no effect on neonatal thyroid function. Nevertheless, it generally is recommended that radiocontrast only be used if absolutely required to obtain additional diagnostic information that will improve the care of the fetus or mother.

===Breastfeeding===
American College of Radiology (ACR) guidelines state that iodinated contrast administration to a breastfeeding mother is considered safe for both the mother and child. Still, mothers who remain concerned about any potential adverse effects to the child are recommended to have the option of abstaining from breastfeeding for 24 hours, with continued milk extraction such as by a breast pump during that period. Mothers that opt for this for non-emergent exams may also use a breast pump to obtain milk before the exam in order to feed the child during the 24-hour abstinence period. What is also important, breastfeeding women should be asked whether they want to take a break from breastfeeding after CM administration.

<text>William Wilkie (5 October 1721 – 10 October 1772) was a Scottish Church of Scotland minister and Professor of Natural Philosophy. Primarily remembered as a poet nicknamed Potato Willie, known more respectfully as the &quot;Scottish Homer&quot;, he contributed to Scotland&#x27;s 18th Century Vernacular Revival. The son of a farmer, he was born in West Lothian and educated at Edinburgh. In 1757 he produced the &quot;Epigoniad&quot;, dealing with the Epigoni, sons of seven heroes who fought against Thebes. He also wrote &quot;Moral Fables in Verse&quot;.

==Life==
The son of James Wilkie, a farmer, he was born at Echline Farm, in the parish of Dalmeny, West Lothian. He was educated at Dalmeny parish school and then studied at the University of Edinburgh, having among his college contemporaries John Home, David Hume, William Robertson, and Adam Smith. His father dying during his student days, he succeeded to the unexpired lease on a farm at Fishers&#x27; Tryste, near Edinburgh. This he carried on to support his three sisters and himself, at the same time continuing his studies for the ministry of the Church of Scotland.

Licensed as a Church of Scotland minister by the Presbytery of Linlithgow on 29 May 1745, he combined writing and agriculture with waiting for a congregation. On 17 May 1753 he was appointed under the patronage of the Earl of Lauderdale as assistant to Rev John Guthrie, parish minister of Ratho, Midlothian, on whose death in February 1756 he became sole incumbent. Eccentricity – his occasionally omitting, for instance, to take off his hat before entering the pulpit – somewhat marred the success of his pastorate.

In November 1759 he was appointed Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of St Andrews, where he devoted his leisure to experiments in moorland farming. In 1766 the university conferred on Wilkie the honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity. He died of ague on 10 October 1772. Robert Fergusson, one of his students, eulogised him in a memorial eclogue.

==Works and reputation==
In 1757 Wilkie published in nine books &quot;The Epigoniad&quot;, based on the fourth book of the &quot;Iliad&quot; and written in heroic couplets like Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;Homer&quot;. To a second edition in 1759 he appended an ingenious apologetic &quot;Dream in the manner of Spenser&quot;. This edition gained warm praise for &quot;The Epigoniad&quot; from David Hume, in a letter to &quot;The Critical Review&quot;, complaining that the journal had unduly depreciated the poem when first published. He gains a mention from a character in Tobias Smollett&#x27;s epistolary novel &quot;The Expedition of Humphry Clinker&quot; as one of Scotland&#x27;s &quot;many authors of the first distinction... as agreeable in conversation as they are instructive and entertaining in their writings.&quot; In 1768 Wilkie published a small volume of 16 fables in iambic tetrameter reminiscent of John Gay, with a &quot;Dialogue between the Author and a Friend&quot; in heroics. The 16th, &quot;The Hare and the Partan&quot; (i. e. crab), is in Midlothian Scots.

Seen by contemporaries as very able, Wilkie impressed and shocked them. On meeting him at Alexander Carlyle&#x27;s in 1759, Charles Townshend commented that no man of his acquaintance &quot;approached so near the two extremes of a god and a brute.&quot; Credited with parsimony, Wilkie said he had learned economy by having &quot;shaken hands with poverty up to the very elbow.&quot; On his death he left an estate worth £3,000.

<text>Sir Charles Hanbury Williams, KB (8 December 1708 – 2 November 1759) was a British politician, diplomat and writer. He was a Member of Parliament from 1734 until his death.

==Early life==
Hanbury was the son of a Welsh ironmaster and Member of Parliament, John Hanbury, and his second wife, Bridget Ayscough, eldest daughter of Sir Edward Ayscough of Stallingborough and South Kelsey. With his father&#x27;s marriage to Bridget came a fortune of £10,000 and connections with established political families. His mother was a close friend of Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough.

Charles went to Eton, where he befriended the novelist Henry Fielding.
In 1720, he assumed the name of Williams, under the terms of a bequest from his godfather, Charles Williams of Caerleon.

==Career==

Williams entered Parliament in 1734, representing the Monmouthshire constituency as a supporter of Robert Walpole, and held the seat until 1747. In 1754 he was returned to the commons as member for Leominster, holding the seat until his death.

From 1747 to 1750, Williams served as the British Ambassador in Dresden. In 1748 he had the same function in Poland and witnessed a Polish Sejm, where he met members of the influential Czartoryski family (August Aleksander Czartoryski). When the future King of Poland, Stanisław Poniatowski, was receiving medical treatment in Berlin, Sir Charles met him when sent there as Ambassador (1750–1751). He entered into Polish and Russian history in Saint Petersburg in 1755 by introducing Stanisław Poniatowski to the Russian Grand Duchess Catherine Alexeyevna (the future Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia), from which a famous romance developed between the Polish aristocrat and the wife of the Russian heir-apparent.

In 1739, Williams gave support for the establishment of the Foundling Hospital and served as one of its founding governors. Williams&#x27;s father bought the Coldbrook Park estate near Abergavenny for him from his godfather&#x27;s bequest. There he added a nine-bay, two-storey Georgian façade in 1746.

===Seven Years&#x27; War===

Williams played a major role as a British envoy (1752-1759) at the court in Russia during the Seven Years&#x27; War of 1756-1763. Although Russia went to war (1756-1762) against Britain&#x27;s ally Prussia, Russia and Britain remained at peace.

===Poet===
Hanbury Williams became known as one of the prominent wits about town, and following in the tradition of Alexander Pope (1688-1744) he wrote a great deal of satirical light verse, including &quot;Isabella, or the Morning&quot; (1740), satires on Ruth Darlington and Pulleney (1741–1742), &quot;The Country Girl&quot; (1742), &quot;Lessons for the Day&quot; (1742), and &quot;Letter to Mr Dodsley&quot; (1743). Collections of his poems appeared in 1763 and of his &quot;Works&quot; in 1822.
Horace Walpole praised the wit of his poetry and wrote of his &quot;biting satire&quot;.

==Personal life==

On 1 July 1732, he married Lady Frances Coningsby (1707/8–1781) at St James, Westminster, London. Lady Frances was a daughter of Thomas Coningsby, 1st Earl Coningsby and Lady Frances Jones (second daughter and sole heiress of Richard Jones, 1st Earl of Ranelagh and the Hon. Frances Willoughby, a daughter and heiress of Francis Willoughby, 5th Baron Willoughby). Together, they had two daughters:
*Frances Hanbury-Williams (c. 1735–1759), who married William Capel, 4th Earl of Essex, the son of William Capell, 3rd Earl of Essex and Lady Elizabeth Russell (a daughter of Wriothesley Russell, 2nd Duke of Bedford).
*Charlotte Hanbury-Williams (1738–1790), who married Robert Boyle-Walsingham, the fifth and youngest son of Henry Boyle, 1st Earl of Shannon, in 1759. He was lost aboard HMS &quot;Thunderer&quot; in a West Indian hurricane.

Charles Hanbury Williams died insane in 1759 and the Coldbrook estate passed to his brother George. His widow died on 31 December 1781 and was buried at Westminster Abbey.

===Descendants===
Through his eldest daughter Frances, he was grandfather to Elizabeth Capel (wife of John Monson, 3rd Baron Monson) and George Capel-Coningsby, 5th Earl of Essex, who married Sarah Bazett, and after her death, Catherine Stephens).

Through his second daughter Charlotte, he was grandfather to Richard Boyle-Walsingham (1762–1788), who died unmarried, and Charlotte Boyle-Walsingham, later &quot;suo jure&quot; Baroness de Ros, who married Lord Henry FitzGerald, fourth son of James FitzGerald, 1st Duke of Leinster and Lady Emily Lennox, Duchess of Leinster.

===Legacy===
Williams inspired the character Charles Edaston in the 1913 George Bernard Shaw play &quot;Great Catherine&quot;, which recounts the story of a British envoy to Catherine&#x27;s court. It was filmed starring Peter O&#x27;Toole in 1968. Williams also left poems said to be &quot;witty but licentious&quot;.

<doc id="1320813" wikidata="Q1443310" url="?curid=1320813" title="Oriental Bay">
<text>Oriental Bay is a bay and suburb of Wellington, the capital city of New Zealand. Known for being both a popular beach and an opulent centre of affluence in the city, it is located close to the central business district on Wellington Harbour.

It has the closest beach to the central city and is thus a popular destination for locals, who swarm here especially in the warmer months (December to March). Painted ladies and other historic houses, such as those in distinctly Wellingtonian streamline moderne style, are prominent alongside and up into the hills that face the bay. Situated against the northern slope of Mount Victoria, the suburb lies southeast of the city centre, at the start of a coastal route which continues around into Evans Bay. Oriental Bay was originally named Duppa Bay, after its sole original resident George Duppa, but in 1843 he renamed it after the &quot;Oriental,&quot; one of the first ships to bring settlers to Wellington. Originally described as a remote &quot;dreary-looking spot&quot; of rocks lying between cliffs and the sea used primarily for quarantining foreigners, it has undergone considerable changes since the early stages of European settlement. 

Many landmarks were built during the 20th century, including grand streamlined moderne houses like the Olympus Building and the Anscombe Apartments, and the modernist Freyberg Pool built in the 1960s. However, the beach&#x27;s greatest renovation came in 2004, when 22,000 tonnes of sand was shipped from Golden Bay to rebuild the beach, which had become worn down over many years.

The Carter Fountain is a distinctive feature in the bay, as is a wooden pontoon which is often covered in swimmers. A small section of the bay that lies beside Freyberg Pool is known as Freyberg Beach, after Lord Freyberg.

==History==

=== 19th century ===
Oriental Bay was originally known as Duppa Bay, after the first and only resident at the time, George Duppa, who later renamed the area Oriental Bay after the ship that he arrived in New Zealand on in 1840. The area was originally farm land and was used as a quarantine station with a nurse and tent on the beach, and by whalers, which resulted in a pungent odour from the boiled whale blubber.

David Wilkinson from Ayrshire, Scotland, was an early Wellington resident and gardener who lived at Grass Street, Oriental Bay in a house named Roseneath Cottage. He opened Wilkinson&#x27;s Tea Gardens at the bay in 1850. The tea gardens was a fashionable place to visit for many years until it closed in the early 20th century. Visitors would walk along the waterfront to enjoy tea and music in the tea rooms, wander around the garden and take away a posy of flowers. The &#x27;Roseneath Estate&#x27; began to be developed in 1886 and probably took its name from Wilkinson&#x27;s business. Walking access from Oriental Bay to Roseneath begins at the top of Grass Street outside Wilkinson&#x27;s house, now 13 Grass Street, at the foot of Wilkinson Street.

Wilkinson also grew grapes commercially and operated a plant nursery, until at least 1891. Wilkinson died in 1902 but his son was still growing grapes in hothouses at Oriental Bay in 1913. Wilkinson junior died in 1919 and the tea garden property was divided up for housing in 1923.

The first public baths at Oriental Bay was an open-air saltwater pool opened in 1864 where the Clyde Quay boat harbour is now. The baths was operated for many years by Henry and Matilda Meech, and known as Te Aro Baths, Clyde Quay Baths or Meech&#x27;s Baths. The original pool was 130 ft by 72 ft, but it was enlarged in 1877. An 1897 description stated that &quot;the baths are securely protected from the visits of sea monsters&quot;. Around the pool there were 34 dressing rooms and rooms for refreshments. 

From the 1870s a quarry existed near the base of Carlton Gore Road. A temporary railway line was built in the 1880s to take spoil from the quarry for the Te Aro reclamation. The former quarry was developed into a small park in the early 1900s.

Settlement of the area increased in the 1880s and residents and landowners began petitioning Wellington Harbour Board and Wellington City Council, asking that the bay not be used for industrial purposes such as ship repairs, that the road be improved and a promenade built, and that the bay should be kept clean of all the refuse and dead animals that swept up along the waterfront.

=== 20th century ===

Public amenities developed further in the early 1900s included public transport, improvements to Te Aro baths, road improvements, construction of the promenade, installation of the band rotunda, opening of a tea kiosk, and planting of trees.

In 1901 Meech&#x27;s Baths were demolished and Wellington City Council built new public baths with men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sections, known as Te Aro Baths, further along the waterfront at the site of today&#x27;s Freyberg Pool. The baths were enlarged in 1909. Schools held swimming lessons at the baths, and swimming competitions took place there too. By the 1960s the baths were in disrepair: in 1962 a storm carried away a section of the wall and dressing rooms. The baths were replaced by Freyberg Pool, which opened in 1963.

Trams began running along Oriental Parade in September 1904. They were replaced by buses in 1950.

In 1911, Wellington City Council began building a sea wall along Oriental Bay from the Te Aro Baths to Point Jerningham. The work was done in stages as funding allowed, and was completed as far as the tea kiosk at Point Jerningham by 1924. Gaps behind the sea wall were filled in and a promenade created. The sea wall is heritage-listed by Wellington City Council.

Construction of the sea wall decreased the size of the rocky beach, and there were calls for sand to be brought in to enlarge and improve the area. A big boost to the beach came during World War 2, when ships from England brought sand as ballast which was then dumped at Oriental Bay. Almost 20,000 tons of sand was deposited on the beach during 1944-1945.

The Oriental Bay Tea Kiosk opened in April 1913 on the site of a former quarry and industrial store at what is now 370 Oriental Bay, at the base of Carlton Gore Road. The ground floor held a large tea rooms and on the second storey was a dance hall with a sprung floor and glassed-in balcony around it. In 1916 dancing had &quot;gone out of fashion&quot; so the upper level was converted into a 31-room private hotel. From about 1921 until the 1940s the building became the Oriental Private Hotel (or Orient Private Hotel). From then until 1957 the building was a YWCA hostel, and from 1957 it was a Labour Department hostel for civil servants, especially young people newly arrived in Wellington for training courses or new careers. Around 1980 the building was demolished and replaced by a Park Royal hotel, which became Raffaele Hotel and was then sold in 2003 and converted into apartments.

The Carter Fountain was installed in the bay in 1973.

===21st century===
In the early 2000s Freyberg Beach, the area of Oriental Bay next to Freyberg Pool, was redeveloped in a project costing $7.5 million. A grassed picnic area was enlarged, sand was brought in to extend the beach, and a pier, toilet block and multi-level sea platform were built. The project was awarded the George Malcolm Supreme Award in the Rural/Park/Recreational category of the New Zealand Institute of Landscape Architects in 2004. 22,000 tonnes of sand from Wainui Bay in Golden Bay was brought in to expand both Oriental and Freyberg Beach. Wind and waves cause the sand to shift, so twice a year Wellington City Council moves the sand around to maintain the beaches. In 2019 this was stated to cost about $70,000 per year. The sand needs to be topped up every ten to twelve years, so in 2015 the Council imported 2400 tonnes of sand from Dunedin. The sand at Oriental Bay is quite coarse-grained, to minimise loss to wind. Special soft sand is brought in for volleyball matches.

Oriental Bay is a site for topless sunbathing. In December 2016, a Free The Nipple Beach Day was held there.

Oriental Parade has been used for cycling and running races on a course around the coast since the nineteenth century. The Round the Bays fun run has taken place since the 1970s and is the third-largest mass-participation event in New Zealand. Runners and walkers begin in the CBD, usually at Frank Kitts Park, and travel around the coastline, along Oriental Bay and around past Evans Bay to Kilbirnie. More than 10,000 people took part in 2023.

== Points of interest ==

=== Norfolk pines ===
Norfolk pines are a distinctive feature of the promenade along Oriental Bay. The first seedlings were planted in 1921, and planting continued for several years. The mature trees, some up to 15 m tall, line most of Oriental Parade and are listed as heritage trees by Wellington City Council. In 2017 there were fears that kākā were damaging the trees. Many of the trees are illuminated at night with strings of lights along their branches.

=== St Gerard&#x27;s church and monastery ===

St Gerard&#x27;s is a brick church and monastery built on a promontory (Fitzgerald Point) overlooking Oriental Bay. The church was built in 1908 and the monastery in 1932. Together they form a distinctive landmark above the bay.

=== Band rotunda ===
The band rotunda in the middle of the beach at Oriental Bay is listed as a Historic Place Category 2 by Heritage New Zealand. It was built in 1936 to replace an earlier wooden band rotunda that stood on a concrete platform on the site. The Moderne-style concrete building opened on 1 May 1937 as a one-storey pavilion with changing rooms for swimmers and an open-air viewing platform on top. By the late 1970s it was not used much by bathers, so Wellington City Council called for ideas to repurpose the building. The original level was put into use for community meeting rooms and public toilets, and a new storey was built on top. This became a restaurant, opened in 1985, and a new open-air roof level open to the public was created above the restaurant. The community rooms were closed in 2012 due to earthquake risk. In 2016 the Kaikōura earthquake caused a crack in the rotunda&#x27;s foundation, which meant that the bottom floor could no longer bear the weight of the restaurant floor above it. Long exposure to the salty marine environment had also caused ‘concrete cancer’, corrosion of the metal reinforcing within the concrete structure.

A contract to redevelop the building was signed in 2019 but progress was delayed by the Covid pandemic. In July 2022 the developer of the site paused construction because he had not found a tenant for the building, and in 2024 the developer and Wellington City Council terminated their agreement as no tenant had been found. In December 2024 the council announced that the building would be restored and redeveloped as a restaurant and bar on the top floor, with a day spa and bathhouse beneath it. Public access to the rooftop would be retained.

=== Carter Fountain ===

The Carter Fountain was donated to the city in 1973 by local businessman Hugh Carter, in memory of his parents. The fountain spouts water into the air, and is illuminated at night. The band rotunda holds the land-based electrical components for the fountain. During events such as arts festivals, images have been projected onto the spray from the fountain.

=== Freyberg Pool ===

Freyberg Pool is an indoor public swimming pool built out into Oriental Bay. It was opened in 1963 near the site of the former Te Aro Baths, an outdoor saltwater pool. Freyberg Pool is named after Bernard Freyberg, a former governor-general of New Zealand. Freyberg was a keen swimmer and had trained at the Te Aro Baths. He died in 1963 so the new pool was named after him. The building is classified as a &quot;Category I&quot; (&quot;places of &#x27;special or outstanding historical or cultural heritage significance or value&#x27;&quot;) historic place by Heritage New Zealand.

=== Tug boat restaurant ===
A former tug boat is permanently moored in the lagoon next to Freyberg Pool. The ship, originally called &quot;Aucklander&quot;, was built in Scotland in 1958 and served as a tug boat in Auckland until 1986. It was sold and brought to Wellington in October 1986. The engines and other parts were removed and after refurbishment the tug was renamed &quot;Tapuhi II&quot; and moved to Oriental Bay where it opened as a restaurant and function centre in February 1992. The business was initially known as Tugboat on the Bay, and later Skippers Seafood Restaurant, then Boat Cafe.

=== Heritage-listed buildings ===
Apart from the band rotunda, Oriental Bay is the location of several other heritage-listed buildings:

* Tram Shelter (Former) built in 1904
* Anscombe Flats, an art deco apartment block
* Apartment building at 300 Oriental Parade
* Inverleith Flats, an apartment building at 306 Oriental Parade

==St Martin&#x27;s Church, Fenny Stratford==

Between 1724 and 1730, Browne Willis built St. Martin&#x27;s Church on the site of the old Chantry Chapel of St. Margaret and St. Catherine at Fenny Stratford. He erected the church as a memorial to his grandfather Dr. Thomas Willis, a famous physician who lived in St. Martin&#x27;s Lane in the parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields in London and died on St. Martin&#x27;s Day, 11 November 1675.

===The Fenny Poppers===
Browne Willis arranged for a sermon to be preached in his memory at St. Martin&#x27;s Church every St. Martin&#x27;s Day, for which a fee was payable. He celebrated the occasion with a dinner for local clergy and gentry. The firing of the &quot;Fenny Poppers&quot;, six small cannon, dates from this period, although there is no record of their first use. In 1740 Browne Willis bought a house in Aylesbury Street, Fenny Stratford and the rent from this was used to pay for the sermon and gunpowder for the Fenny Poppers. The traditions were continued after Willis&#x27;s death in 1760.

The six poppers were re-cast in 1859 after one of them burst. They are still in use today.

Many sites have been used for this battery. These include; the Canal Wharf, land behind the Church, St, Martin&#x27;s Hall, the Churchyard and now the Leon Recreation Ground, which was once part of the lands belonging to the Chantry.

The poppers each weigh about . The bore, will take up to of gunpowder, which is plugged with well-rammed newspaper. They are fired three times on St. Martin&#x27;s Day: noon, 2pm and 4pm. There is no connection with Remembrance Day, which is also on 11 November.

The poppers are also fired to mark special occasions, including the death of Queen Victoria, the start of the second millennium, the 100th birthday of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, and the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II.

<text>Rev. James Wills (1 January 1790 – 23 November 1868) was an Irish writer, poet, and Anglican clergyman.

==Early life and education==

Wills was born in County Roscommon, the younger son of landowner Thomas Wills of Willsgrove, and his second wife, a daughter of Capt. James Browne of Moyne, Co. Roscommon. The Wills family were landed gentry in Roscommon. His grandfather Col. Godfrey Wills was an amateur architect.

His father died when he was 2 and was succeeded by his eldest son from his first marriage, William Robert Wills, who married Mary Grey Sanford, the niece and co-heiress of Henry Sandford, 1st Baron Mount Sandford of Castlerea House. He assumed the name and arms of Sandford in 1847.

James was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, and studied law in the Middle Temple, London but was forced to abandon his legal career after his mentally unstable brother Thomas (born 1788) squandered his inheritance. In 1829, Thomas Wills, after being discharged from a mental asylum, sold the remainder of the estate for £30,000 (). He sailed for America but disappeared, and his family suspected he was murdered by his valet. 

James&#x27; older half-brother, now known as William Robert Wills, offered him the family estate of Willsgrove, but he declined because of the ongoing costs, and instead entered the church.

==Career==

From 1822 to 1838, Wills lived in Dublin and wrote in the &quot;Dublin University Magazine&quot;, &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and other periodicals. He supported the Reverend Caesar Otway in building up the &quot;Irish Quarterly Review&quot;. 

In 1831, he published &quot;The Disembodied and other Poems&quot;. &quot;The Philosophy of Unbelief&quot; (1835) attracted much attention. He actually wrote the famous poem &quot;The Universe&quot;, even though it was published in 1821 under the name of Charles Maturin. He was editor of the &quot;Dublin University Magazine&quot; in 1841 and 1842. 

His largest work was &quot;Lives of Illustrious and Distinguished Irishmen&quot;, published in six volumes (1840–1847), and his last publication &quot;The Idolatress&quot; (1868). In all his writings gave evidence of a powerful personality. His poems are spirited, and in some cases show considerable dramatic qualities. 

In 1841, Wills was appointed curate of Pollrone, Co. Kilkenny, and became the vicar five years later. In 1848, he years later he was promoted to the living of Kilmacow, and in 1861 ultimately to Attanagh.

He was appointed Donnellan lecturer at Trinity College Dublin in 1855–56. In 1860, he gave a series of lectures on Christianity at TCD, where he &quot;delighted the students&quot; with his delivery.

==Family==

In 1822, Wills married Katherine Gorman, daughter of the Rev. W. Gorman and niece of the chief justice Charles Kendal Bushe. They had three sons and a daughter, Elizabeth. His middle son was the dramatist and painter William Gorman Wills. His other two sons entered the church: The eldest, Rev. Thomas Bushe Wills, was curate of Attanagh under his father and the youngest, the Rev. Freeman Crofts Wills (1837–1913), was vicar of St Agatha&#x27;s. 

He died in Attanagh, County Laois.

<text>William Gorman Wills (28 January 182813 December 1891), usually known as W. G. Wills, was an Irish dramatist, novelist and painter.

==Early life and career==
Wills was born at Blackwell lodge in Kilmurry, near Thomastown in County Kilkenny, Ireland, the son of the Reverend James Wills (1790–1868), author of &quot;Lives of Illustrious and Distinguished Irishmen&quot;, and his wife Katherine Gorman Wills. As a young man, he was educated at Waterford Grammar School and later went to Trinity College, Dublin where he took no degree, but was awarded the Vice-Chancellor&#x27;s Medal for his poem &quot;Poland.&quot; He later left the university and enrolled at the Royal Hibernian Academy in Dublin where he studied painting.

Though he had originally planned to study law, Wills preferred the arts. His first novel was &quot;Old Times&quot;, for which he also drew and engraved the illustrations. After publishing &quot;Old Times&quot; in an Irish magazine, he travelled to London, and for some time wrote for periodicals without much success. A second novel, &quot;The Wife&#x27;s Evidence&quot; was dramatised with some success. Wills then chose to live a bohemian lifestyle, lodging at the Arundel Club. He later joined the Garrick Club.
For a period, he attempted to make a career as an artist. He set up as a portrait-painter in 1868. He had some success, despite limited artistic training, but his disorderly lifestyle and reputation for missing appointments undermined his career. He also painted narrative works.

==Drama==
He found his true vein in drama, and produced over 30 plays, after having his first major success with &quot;The Man of Airlie&quot; (1867), which was shown in London and New York. In 1872 he was engaged by the Lyceum Theatre with an annual salary. Some of his most notable works there were &quot;Medea in Corinth&quot;, &quot;Eugene Aram&quot;, &quot;Jane Shore&quot;, &quot;Buckingham&quot;, and &quot;Olivia&quot;, a dramatisation of The Vicar of Wakefield, which had great success. Wills&#x27; plays were typically in verse, participating in the revival of verse drama at the time. From this time until 1887 his plays were rarely absent from the London stage.

Many of his plays were based on historical events. &quot;Charles I&quot;, about the life of the English king, was one of his major successes, running for 200 nights at the Lyceum in 1872–3.
Other historical dramas include &quot;Mary Queen of Scots&quot; and &quot;England in the Days of Charles II&quot;.
These works have been strongly criticised for their freedom with historical fact. Harold Child in &quot;The Cambridge History of English and American Literature&quot; commented,

Richard Cordell described &quot;Charles I&quot; as &quot;an amazing picture of Charles as the guileless prince yoked to a perfect queen, with Cromwell as the heavy villain.&quot;

Other plays include &quot;Hinko&quot;, &quot;Juana&quot;, &quot;Ninon&quot; (which ran for eight months at the Adelphi), &quot;Claudian&quot;, and his adaptation of &quot;Faust&quot;, which ran for 188 nights in 1885 followed by another long run in 1887–8.

Wills worked regularly with Henry Irving. Irving produced his &quot;Vanderdecken&quot; in 1878, a version of the Flying Dutchman story. In 1880 he created a revised version of Henrik Hertz&#x27;s play &quot;King René&#x27;s Daughter&quot; under the title &quot;Iolanthe&quot;. Irving commissioned &quot;King Arthur&quot; in 1890, but it remained unproduced as Irving was unhappy with the work. He asked J. Comyns Carr to rewrite it. Irving also commissioned a version of &quot;Don Quixote&quot; but did not produce it.

In 1887 his mother, whom he had supported for many years, died. After that time, Wills seemed to have less incentive for work, and died four years later.

==Other works==
He wrote several novels after &quot;The Wife&#x27;s Evidence&quot;, including &quot;Notice to Quit&quot; (1863) and &quot;The Love That Kills&quot; (1867), both of which deal with the aftermath of the Great Famine of Ireland. He also published &quot;Life&#x27;s Foreshadowings&quot; and &quot;David Chantrey&quot;.

Wills&#x27; long blank verse narrative poem &quot;Melchior&quot;, in the manner of Browning, was strongly recommended by Oscar Wilde. It tells the story of a German composer inspired by a young woman whom he imagines to be Saint Cecilia. He also wrote many song lyrics.

==Reputation==
His biography, &quot;W. G. Wills: Dramatist and Painter&quot;, was written by his brother Freeman Wills in 1898. However, even by then Wills&#x27; reputation was in decline. His works were very rarely revived or read after his death and have been subject to some scathing criticism. Richard Cordell described &quot;Broken Spells&quot; as &quot;a flatulent Napoleonic piece&quot;, adding that Wills &quot;wavered between uninspired verse plays and noisy melodrama&quot;. Peter Thomson calls &quot;Eugene Aram&quot; &quot;semi poetic drivel&quot;.

James Joyce alludes to him and to his play &quot;A Royal Divorce&quot; (concerning Napoleon&#x27;s divorce from Joséphine) many times in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;.

<text>Purgi, Burig, &quot;Purki&quot;, &quot;Purik&quot;, &quot;Purigi&quot; or &quot;Puriki&quot; (Tibetan script: , Nastaʿlīq script: ) is a Tibetic language closely related to the Ladakhi-Balti language. Purgi is natively spoken by the Purigpa people in Ladakh region of India and Baltistan region of Pakistan. There are about 94,000 native speakers of the language in India.

Most of the Purigpas are Shia Muslims, although a significant number of them follow Noorbakhshi and Sunni Islam, and a small minority of Buddhists and Bön followers reside in areas like Fokar valley, Mulbekh, Wakha. Like the Baltis, they speak an archaic Tibetan dialect closely related to Balti and Ladakhi. Purigi is more closely related to Balti than Ladakhi, so there are different opinions among linguists in considering Purigi and Balti as different languages or simply different varieties of the same language.

<text>Sir Daniel Wilson FSA (Scot) FRSE LLD (January 5, 1816 – August 6, 1892) was a Scottish-born Canadian archaeologist, ethnologist and author.

==Life==

Wilson was born at 55 Potterow in Edinburgh on 3 January 1816, the son of Archibald Wilson and his wife, Janet Aitken. His father is listed in directories as a book-binder, but some records state he was a wine-dealer. He was educated at the Royal High School. He was apprenticed as an engraver around 1830 then went to London, and worked in the studio of J. M. W. Turner. His skills as a water-colour painter came back into play much later in his career.

Wilson returned to Edinburgh in 1842, and was appointed Secretary of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland in 1845. He corresponded with Christian Jürgensen Thomsen and J. J. A. Worsaae, who had established the exhibition of the prehistoric material in the Danish national museum in Copenhagen in terms of the Three-age system – the succession of a Stone Age by a Bronze Age and an Iron Age. He organized the display of the Society&#x27;s museum after the same chronological scheme, the first to emulate the Copenhagen museum.

In 1845 he is listed as a &quot;printseller and artist&#x27;s colourman&quot; with premises at 25 Hanover Street and living at 32 Broughton Place.

In 1848 Wilson published &quot;Memorials of Edinburgh in the Olden Time&quot;, of which the chief value lies in the numerous illustrations, done by himself It was an important record of the many historic buildings that were at risk or were being lost in the rapid development of central Edinburgh. In 1851 he published &quot;The Archaeology and Prehistoric Annals of Scotland&quot;, which introduced the word &quot;prehistoric&quot; into the English archaeological vocabulary – he probably translated it from the Danish word &quot;forhistorie&quot; as used by Thomsen and Worsaae.

His final years in Edinburgh were spent at 17 Archibald Place, near George Heriot&#x27;s School.

In 1853 Wilson left Scotland to take up the post of Professor of History and English Literature in Toronto. In addition to his teaching duties, he kept up his interests in natural history, geology, and was very interested in the ethnography of the indigenous groups that he encountered on his vacation treks. Many of his watercolour sketches of landscapes and encampments of hunter-gatherer groups are now in the Canadian national archives in Ottawa. His brother George Wilson had become the first director of a new national museum in Edinburgh (now the National Museums of Scotland), and Daniel Wilson actively collected ethnographic material for the museum by means of an extensive network of contacts. He was the author of &quot;Civilisation in the Old and the New World&quot;, and a number of other books, for example, a study on Thomas Chatterton, and &quot;Caliban, the Missing Link&quot;. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1861.

In 1875 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Sir George Frederick Harvey, John Hutton Balfour, Sir Andrew Douglas Maclagan and Sir Robert Christison. He served as president of the Canadian Institute (later the Royal Canadian Institute) from 1878-1881.

Daniel Wilson also served as president of University College, Toronto from 1880 to 1892, and as the first president of the federated University of Toronto from 1890–1892. He asserted their claims against the sectarian universities of the province which denounced the provincial university as godless, and against the private medical schools in Toronto. He advocated what he called &quot;the maintenance of a national system of university education in opposition to sectarian or denominational colleges&quot;. He opposed the federation of colleges, particularly that of Victoria College, as a &quot;Methodist plot&quot;.

In 1888 Wilson was knighted by Queen Victoria for his services to education in Canada, and in 1891 given the Freedom of the City of Edinburgh. 

He died in Toronto on August 6, 1892. He is buried in St. James Cemetery in Toronto.

==Family==

His older brother was George Wilson FRSE (1818–1859).

In 1840, he married Margaret Mackay.

His sister Jessie Aitken Wilson married the biologist James Sime.

==Recognition==

The Sir Daniel J. Wilson Residence at the University College in University of Toronto is named in his honour.

<text>Major Theodore Woolsey Winthrop (September 22, 1828 – June 10, 1861) was a writer, lawyer, and world traveller. He was one of the first Union officers killed in the American Civil War.

==Biography==
Winthrop was born in New Haven, Connecticut, and is a descendant of several prominent Colonial families. Through his father, he was descended from Governor John Winthrop, and through his mother, from theologian Jonathan Edwards, as well as early settlers George (Joris) Woolsey and Thomas Cornell.

He graduated in 1848 from Yale University, where his uncle Theodore Dwight Woolsey was President, and he was a member of the Phi chapter of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. He traveled for a year in Great Britain and Europe and then through the United States, settling in Staten Island in the 1850s. After contributing to periodicals, short sketches, and stories, which attracted little attention, Winthrop enlisted in the 7th Regiment, New York State Militia, an early volunteer unit of the Federal Army that answered President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s call for troops in 1861. He wrote a popular essay about the experience titled &quot;Our March to Washington.&quot; He was appointed Major and soon became an aide-de-camp to Major General Benjamin Butler, commander of the Department of Virginia headquartered at Fort Monroe. Winthrop had long been an abolitionist, along with his younger brother William Winthrop, who later became the nation&#x27;s leading authority on military law. Butler credited Winthrop with first formulating the policy that automatically conferred freedmen status on escaped slaves who entered into Union Army-held territory.

==Battle of Big Bethel==
At the Battle of Big Bethel on June 10, 1861, he volunteered for General Ebenezer W. Peirce&#x27;s staff and drew up a crude plan of battle. After a Federal attack to the enemy right flank was foiled, Winthrop led an ill-fated assault on the Confederate left held by four companies of the 1st Regiment North Carolina Infantry, under the command of Colonel (later Lieutenant General) Daniel Harvey Hill.

In the heat of battle, Major Winthrop leapt onto the trunk of a fallen tree and reportedly yelled, &quot;One more charge boys, and the day is ours.&quot; Soon thereafter, he was killed by a musket ball to the heart and became the first casualty of rank for the Northern side in what history regards as the first pitched land battle of the Civil War. Ironically, ardent abolitionist Winthrop may have been shot by the African-American slave of a Confederate officer in the 1st North Carolina Infantry. (Three different soldiers, as well as this slave, referred to in the records only as &quot;Sam,&quot; claimed to have killed him.)

==Author==
Winthrop&#x27;s novels, for which he had failed to find a publisher during his lifetime, appeared posthumously. They include &quot;John Brent&quot;, founded on his experiences in the far West, and &quot;Edwin Brothertoft&quot;, a story of the American Revolution. &quot;Cecil Dreeme&quot;, his most important work, was a semi-autobiographical novel dealing with social mores and gender roles set at New York University, where Winthrop had once been a lodger. Other works include &quot;The Canoe and the Saddle&quot; and &quot;Life in the Open Air&quot;. His sister, Laura Winthrop Johnson, assembled a collection of his poems and prose organized by the time period of his life &quot;Life and Poems of Theodore Winthrop&quot;.

Works published during Winthrop&#x27;s lifetime include a pamphlet accompanying the painting The Heart of the Andes by his friend Frederic Edwin Church, distributed in 1859. After Winthrop&#x27;s death in 1861, the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; published sketches of the military campaigns in Virginia based on his own experiences.

<text>Heath &quot;Heathcliff&quot; Slocumb (born June 7, 1966) is an American former Major League Baseball (MLB) relief pitcher. He batted and threw right-handed.

==Early life and amateur career==
As a child, Slocumb was nicknamed &quot;Heathcliff&quot; after the comic strip cat of the same name.

Slocumb did not play Little League or even sandlot baseball as a child. According to his high school coach, he first played baseball when he showed up to tryouts as a junior at John Bowne High School in Flushing, Queens without a glove. According to a scout, his high school coach told him Slocumb was a football player who had tried out for every team at the school. Despite a strong arm, Slocumb had poor pitching mechanics and was not selected in the 1984 MLB draft. Slocumb caught the attention of a New York Mets scout who put him on an amateur team until July 17, 1984 when the Mets signed him for $5,000 ().

==Professional career==
In a 10-year career, Slocumb played with the Chicago Cubs, Cleveland Indians, Philadelphia Phillies, Boston Red Sox, Seattle Mariners, Baltimore Orioles, St. Louis Cardinals, and San Diego Padres.

An All-Star selection in , Slocumb compiled a career 28–37 record with 513 strikeouts and a 4.08 ERA in 631 innings. He collected 98 saves, including 32 for the Phillies in 1995 and 31 with Boston in 1996.

Slocumb was traded in mid-1997 from Boston to Seattle for pitcher Derek Lowe and catcher Jason Varitek, in what is often cited in retrospect as one of the most one-sided trades in baseball history. At the time, Lowe had pitched in only 12 major-league games with an ERA of nearly 7, and Varitek had never played in the majors. However, Lowe and Varitek both went on to make multiple All-Star teams and were major contributors to the 2004 World Series Champion Red Sox, and were inducted into the team&#x27;s Hall of Fame after their careers. In 2005, Varitek was named captain of the Red Sox. Although Slocumb helped the Mariners make the playoffs in 1997, his career had dissipated significantly by 1998 and he was never effective again.

==Personal life==
Slocumb married and had two daughters with his high school sweetheart, Deborah, before she died of breast cancer in 1992. The daughters lived with their maternal grandmother in Richmond Hill, Queens during his playing career.

<text>Claudio Maria Veggio (born c. 1510) was an Italian composer of the Renaissance, principally of secular music.

He was born in Piacenza, and must have spent most of his life there. Little is known about his life except for a brief period during the 1540s, when he was employed as a composer and harpsichordist for Count Federico Anguissola of Piacenza, at the Castell&#x27;Arquato. After this period of activity he vanishes from history; nothing further is known about him.

Veggio was an early composer of madrigals, of which two books have survived, published in Venice in 1540 (the first to formally feature note nere under the name &quot;misura breve&quot;) and 1544, for four and eight voices respectively. He was also a prolific keyboard composer of &quot;ricercars&quot; which alternate contrapuntal and highly ornamented passages. Stylistically they represent an intermediate stage between the early keyboard style of Marco Antonio Cavazzoni and the style of his son Girolamo Cavazzoni, who composed &quot;ricercars&quot; in the more modern sense of the word — i.e., as a series of imitative sections.

Of greatest significance to musicologists is a manuscript by Veggio which survived in the archives of Castell&#x27;Arquato. It appears to be a rough copy of his draft compositions, containing numerous sketches, strikeouts and revisions; it is one of the earliest such music manuscripts to survive, and provides a rare window into compositional procedures of the time. Many of the compositions are transcriptions for keyboard of vocal compositions, now lost, probably by other composers.

<text>John Wolcot (baptised 9 May 1738 – 14 January 1819) was an English satirist, who wrote under the pseudonym of &quot;Peter Pindar&quot;.

==Life==
Wolcot was baptised at Dodbrooke, near Kingsbridge, Devon. In the parish register, his surname was spelled &quot;Woolcot&quot;. It is not known where he was born. He was educated by an uncle, and received his M.D. from Aberdeen University. In 1767 he went as physician to Sir William Trelawny, Governor of Jamaica. He was offered the lucrative living of St. Anne&#x27;s, where the current parson was seriously ill. Wolcott went back to England and took holy orders in 1769. He returned to Jamaica to find the parson of St. Anne&#x27;s had recovered and Wolcott was instead offered the less lucrative living of Vere. Sir William died in 1772; Wolcot came home and, abandoning the Church, resumed his medical career. He settled in practice at Truro, where he discovered the talents of John Opie, and assisted him.

In 1780 Wolcot went to London and began writing satires. The first objects of his attentions were the members of the Royal Academy. These attempts being well received, he soon began to fly at higher game, the King and Queen being the most frequent marks for his satirical shafts. Between 1785 and 1796 he published &quot;The Lousiad: a Heroi-Comic Poem&quot; in five cantos, which took its name from a legend that a louse had once appeared on the King&#x27;s dinner plate. In London Wolcot became an important figure in the art world as patron of both John Opie and later, Richard Morton Paye.

Other objects of his attack were James Boswell, the biographer of Samuel Johnson; James Bruce, the Abyssinian traveller; Hannah More, former bluestocking and playwright and Bishop Porteus. Wolcot had a remarkable vein of humour and wit, which, while intensely comic to persons not involved, stung its subjects to the quick. He had likewise strong intelligence, and a power of coining effective phrases. In other kinds of composition, as in some ballads which he wrote, an unexpected touch of gentleness and even tenderness appears. Among these are &quot;The Beggar Man&quot; and &quot;Lord Gregory&quot;. Much that he wrote has now lost all interest owing to the circumstances referred to being forgotten, but enough still retains its peculiar relish to account for his contemporary reputation.

The Austrian composer Joseph Haydn drew on Wolcot&#x27;s ode &quot;To My Candle&quot; for his cantata &quot;Der Sturm&quot;, composed during his visit to London in 1791–1792. In 1811 Wolcot wrote a satirical poem &quot;The Carlton House Fete&quot; in response to the costly and elaborate Carlton House Fête held to celebrate the beginning of the Regency era.

He died at his home in Latham Place (now part of Churchway), Somers Town, London on 14 January 1819, and was buried in a vault in the churchyard of St Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden.

<text>Ellen Price (17 January 1814 – 10 February 1887), better known as Mrs. Henry Wood, was an English novelist. She is best remembered for her 1861 novel &quot;East Lynne&quot;. Many of her books sold well internationally and were widely read in the United States. In her time, she surpassed Charles Dickens in fame in Australia.

==Life==
Price was born in Worcester, on 17 January 1814. In 1836 she married Henry Wood, who worked in the banking and shipping trade in Dauphiné in the south of France, where they lived for 20 years. On the failure of Wood&#x27;s business, the family (including four children) returned to England and settled in Upper Norwood near London, where Ellen Wood turned to writing. This supported the family. Henry Wood died in 1866. She wrote over 30 novels, many of which (especially &quot;East Lynne&quot;) enjoyed remarkable popularity. Among the best known are &quot;Danesbury House&quot;, &quot;Oswald Cray&quot;, &quot;Mrs. Halliburton&#x27;s Troubles&quot;, &quot;The Channings&quot;, &quot;Lord Oakburn&#x27;s Daughters&quot; and &quot;The Shadow of Ashlydyat&quot;. Her writing tone would be described as &quot;conservative and Christian,&quot; occasionally expressing religious rhetoric.

In 1867, Wood purchased the English magazine &quot;Argosy&quot;, which had been founded by Alexander Strahan in 1865. She wrote much of the magazine herself, but other contributors included Hesba Stretton, Julia Kavanagh, Christina Rossetti, Sarah Doudney and Rosa Nouchette Carey. Wood continued as its editor until her death in 1887, when her son Charles Wood took over.

Wood&#x27;s works were translated into many languages, including French and Russian. Leo Tolstoy, in a 9 March 1872 letter to his older brother Sergei, noted that he was &quot;reading Mrs. Wood&#x27;s wonderful novel &quot;In the Maze&quot;&quot;.

Wood wrote several works of supernatural fiction, including &quot;The Ghost&quot; (1867) and the oft-anthologized &quot;Reality or Delusion?&quot; (1868).

She died of bronchitis.

<text>John George Wood, or Reverend J. G. Wood, (21 July 1827 – 3 March 1889), was an English writer who popularised natural history with his writings. His son Theodore Wood (1863–1923) was also a canon and naturalist.

==Life and work==

===Early life and ordination===

John George Wood was born in London, son of the surgeon John Freeman Wood and his German-born wife Juliana Lisetta Arntz. His parents moved with him to Oxford the following year, and he was educated at home, at Ashbourne Grammar School and Merton College, Oxford (B.A., 1848, M.A., 1851), and then at Christ Church, where he worked for some time in the anatomical museum under Sir Henry Acland. In 1852 he became curate of the parish of St Thomas the Martyr, Oxford, and in 1854 was ordained priest; he also took up the post of chaplain to the Boatmen&#x27;s Floating Chapel at Oxford. Among other benefices which he held, he was for a time chaplain to St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital. In 1878 Wood settled in Upper Norwood, where he lived until his death.

===Parson-naturalist===

In 1854, Wood gave up his curacy to devote himself to writing on natural history, becoming a well-known parson-naturalist of the Victorian era. However, he continued to take on priestly work, as in 1858 he accepted a readership at Christ Church, Newgate Street, and was assistant-chaplain to St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital, London, from 1856 until 1862. Between 1868 and 1876 he was precentor to the Canterbury Diocesan Choral Union.

After 1876 he devoted himself to the production of books and lecturing on zoology, which he illustrated by drawing on a black-board or on large sheets of white paper with coloured crayons. These &quot;sketch lectures,&quot; as he called them, were very popular, and made his name widely known both in Great Britain and in the United States.

Wood gave occasional lectures from 1856. In 1879, however, he began lecturing as a second profession, and continued to lecture steadily until 1888 in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. He delivered the Lowell Lectures in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1883-4.

==Natural history populariser==
Wood was a prolific and successful natural history writer, though rather as a populariser than as a scientist. For example, his book &quot;Common Objects of the Country&quot; sold 100,000 copies in a week. Among his works are &quot;Common Objects of the Microscope&quot;; &quot;Illustrated Natural History&quot; (1853); &quot;Animal Traits and Characteristics&quot; (1860); &quot;Common Objects of the Sea Shore&quot; (1857); &quot;The Uncivilized Races, or Natural History of Man&quot; (1868) (to which Mark Twain refers in his humorous work &quot;Roughing It&quot;); &quot;Out of Doors&quot; (1874) (a book that was quoted by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in his Sherlock Holmes story &quot;The Adventure of the Lion&#x27;s Mane&quot;); &quot;Field Naturalist&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (with his son Theodore Wood) (1879–80); books on gymnastics and sport; and an edition of Gilbert White&#x27;s &quot;Natural History of Selborne&quot;. He also edited &quot;The Boys Own Magazine&quot;.

Wood died at Coventry on 3 March 1889.

<text>Brooklyn is a suburb of Wellington, the capital city of New Zealand, under the governance of Wellington City Council. It lies 3 km south of Wellington&#x27;s central business district on the eastern slopes of the hills above Happy Valley. It is located to the south of Aro Valley and Highbury, west of Mount Cook, north of Vogeltown, Mornington and Ōwhiro Bay and east of Kowhai Park, Panorama Heights, Mitchelltown and Karori.

It was named after the district of Brooklyn, New York which in turn was named after the village of Breukelen, Utrecht, the Netherlands.

== History ==

=== Māori history ===
In pre-European times, Māori knew the Brooklyn hills as Turanga-rere, translated as &quot;the waving plumes of the war-party&quot;. The historian James Cowan, in investigating the original Māori names for places in and around Wellington City, suggested this referred to how the tall trees moved in the wind, as &quot;when the warriors stood up to dance... all their feather hair-adornments would wave to and fro&quot;.

The small Te Atiawa village of Moera, or Moe-i-te-Ra (&quot;Sleeping in the sun&quot;) was sited in the area now covered by Maarama Crescent. (The name was later transferred to the suburb of Moera in Lower Hutt.) The Omaroro kūmara gardens were situated where Connaught Terrace is today.

Brooklyn and the wider Wellington region then and hosted a number of &quot;iwi&quot;, or tribes, all represented through a Charter of Understanding with Wellington Regional Council signed in July 2000 (and replacing the original Charter of Understanding of 1993):

* Ngāti Kahungunu ki Wairarapa 
* Te Atiawa/ Taranaki Whānui ki te Upoko o te Ika
* Ngāti Toa Rangātira
* Te Ati Awa ki Whakarongotai
* Ngāti Raukawa ki te Tonga
* Rangitāne o Wairarapa
In 2013, a Memorandum of Partnership was agreed between the tangata whenua of Te Upoko o te Ika a Maui, or tangata whenua of the region, and the Wellington Regional Council. This built on and replaced the Charter of Understanding.

=== European settlement ===
European settlement began in the area during the 1840s. In January 1842 the New Zealand Company ship &quot;London&quot; commanded by Captain Attwood set sail for its second voyage to Wellington from Gravesend in Kent. It carried 700 tons of cargo, 137 adults and 39 children. On 1 May 1842 the ship arrived in Wellington, with John and Louisa Fitchett and their seven children amongst the passengers.

The New Zealand Company divided the new settlement into 100-acre blocks. The district of Ohiro developed in the early 1840s from three of these blocks (Ohiro Sections 11,12 and 13) on the land surrounding Port Nicholson (officially renamed Wellington Harbour in 1980). Settlers could access the new district only via the steep Ohiro Road from present-day Aro Street. In 1847, John Fitchett purchased Section 11 and established a dairy farm called Ohiro Farm, known also as Fitchett&#x27;s Farm. A township named Fitchett Town formed in the 1860s; it gained its new name &quot;Brooklyn&quot; in 1888 when the then land-owners, Ashton B. Fitchett (son of John Fitchett d.1875) and R.B. Todman, offered the main subdivision for sale. The offer included 208 lots of Fitchett&#x27;s Farm next to Brooklyn.

In 1899, after the sale, a further subdivision took place, and the main roads of Mitchell and Todman Streets took form. These were then intersected with Reuben, Bruce, Laura and Charlotte Avenues, Tanera Crescent, Apuka Street and Sugar Loaf Road (the site of the War Memorial). In 1902 Brooklyn was extended further up the Brooklyn Hills when Ashton B. Fitchett sold additional lots of land. Both Karepa and Apuka Streets were extended onto this newly available land. Brooklyn was connected with the city water supply on 24 October 1907, with the pumping station situated on Epuni Street.

A new tramway route opened in May 1906. Unlike the existing route to Brooklyn via Aro Street and Ohiro Road which had excessively steep gradients, the new route was cut through the town belt by Central Park. This route later became today&#x27;s Brooklyn Road. On 3 May 1907, a tram crashed on the Brooklyn hill due to brake failure and one passenger was killed. The tramway closed in 1957, and the City - Brooklyn route is now served by numbers 7 and 17 buses. The number 7 (City - Brooklyn - Kingston) route was electrified as part of the Wellington City trolley bus service which then was terminated in 2017.

Brooklyn takes its name from the borough in New York City, which in turn recalls the Dutch city Breukelen.

== Demographics ==
Brooklyn, comprising the statistical areas of Brooklyn North, Brooklyn East and Brooklyn South, covers . It had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Brooklyn had a population of 6,708 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 201 people (3.1%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 585 people (9.6%) since the 2006 census. There were 2,544 households, comprising 3,276 males and 3,438 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.95 males per female, with 1,116 people (16.6%) aged under 15 years, 1,722 (25.7%) aged 15 to 29, 3,354 (50.0%) aged 30 to 64, and 525 (7.8%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 81.3% European/Pākehā, 7.2% Māori, 3.4% Pasifika, 13.9% Asian, and 4.2% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 29.7, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 61.2% had no religion, 24.6% were Christian, 0.4% had Māori religious beliefs, 3.4% were Hindu, 0.9% were Muslim, 1.0% were Buddhist and 3.1% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 2,916 (52.1%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 270 (4.8%) people had no formal qualifications. 1,938 people (34.7%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 3,483 (62.3%) people were employed full-time, 804 (14.4%) were part-time, and 246 (4.4%) were unemployed.

== Politics ==
Brooklyn is within the Wellington City Council&#x27;s Paekawakawa/Southern General Ward and is currently represented on the council by two councillors: Laurie Foon and Nureddin Abdurahman.

Brooklyn was a parliamentary electorate from 1946 to 1954. For general elections today, most of Brooklyn is located within the Wellington Central general and Te Tai Tonga Māori parliamentary electorates. Since the 2008 New Zealand general election, the Wellington Central electorate has been represented by Grant Robertson, while Tākuta Ferris has been the Member of Parliament for Te Tai Tonga since 2023.

== Landmarks and features ==

=== Parks and Town Belt ===

* Central Park. Named after the area of the same name in New York, it separates Brooklyn from the city. Established in 1913 on Town Belt land, and opened on Labour Day, 27 October 1913, the park features a set of wrought-iron gates at its main entrance: the then Mayor, John Pearce Luke donated them in 1920. During World War II, American forces established a military camp in the park between 1942 and 1944. In October 1942 building work started with an initial requirement to accommodate 416 men of the US Marine Corps. The partly built camp could accept some occupants by 22 November 1942, and by July 1943 it could accommodate 540 personnel. The US Marines requested a further expansion of the camp, but the improving military situation precluded the expansion.
* Tanera Park. Lies to the north and north-west of Central Park on the opposite side of Ohiro Road. The park has sports facilities, including soccer, cricket, and artificial surfaces as well as changing-rooms. In 1991 the Wellington City Council set aside some of the park as trial to help low-income families and community-organisations to grow their own vegetables. The gardens, including 33 plots, have become known as the Tanera Community Gardens; the Mokai Kainga Trust manages them.
* Elliott Park. Lies on the western side of Brooklyn, adjacent to Mitchell Street and Karepa Street. The park used to have a children&#x27;s play-ground, however the play-ground has been removed by the Wellington City Council and not replaced. The park was donated by Mr Elliott who used to have his farm in this place. There are still also wild pigs and goats that live on the bottom of the hills.

=== Brooklyn Hill ===
Brooklyn Hill is high.

=== Hawkins Hill ===
Hawkins Hill is 495 metres (1,624 ft) high. It is the highest point on Wellington&#x27;s southern hills and the site of a white radar dome that can be seen from many parts of the city.

=== Wind turbine ===
The Electricity Corporation of New Zealand installed the Brooklyn wind turbine on Polhill above north-western Brooklyn in March 1993 as part of a research project into wind-power generation. The Corporation chose the Brooklyn site due to Wellington&#x27;s &quot;higher than normal&quot; wind patterns and to gain maximum exposure in the viewshed of Wellingtonians. The turbine, visible from many parts of the city, stands 299 metres above sea level. It became the oldest operating wind turbine in New Zealand 

The original turbine was decommissioned in 2015 due to age, and replaced in 2016 with a larger version. The original turbine, a Vestas Wind Systems A/S turbine, was a relatively small machine compared with other turbines installed in New Zealand, such as those at Te Āpiti Wind Farm, with an installed capacity of 225 kW. The present turbine, a German Enercon E-44, has a capacity of 900 kW, enough to power around 490 homes, with the power generated going into the local network for general distribution. The tower hub is 44m high and the blades are 20.8m long.

Meridian Energy has managed the turbine since its formation as a company in 1999 with the deregulation of the New Zealand electricity market.

=== War memorial ===

Brooklyn&#x27;s World War I war memorial overlooks northern Brooklyn from the top of Sugarloaf Hill. It lists the names of the 48 Brooklyn soldiers who died in that war.

Soon after the war ended in 1918 a movement to build a memorial began, with the funds raised in two years. The Brooklyn Returned Services Association (RSA) chose as a monument a carved marble statue depicting a soldier with hat in hand, looking towards the harbour heads through which sailed the troopships bearing those who would not return. The foundation stone was laid on 25 April 1922 by Colonel George Mitchell D.S.O. MP, and the memorial was unveiled by Governor-General Viscount Jellicoe on 23 September 1923.

For around 16 years, a board of trustees maintained the memorial, before passing it over to Wellington City Council. In 2003 a nine-month restoration took place, which involved re-securing the structure to the concrete pads that it stands on as well as cleaning, restoring plasterwork, removal of rust and replacing parts that had gone missing.

The inscription on the pedestal reads:

&quot;The motherland called and they went and these men died for their country.&quot;

==== Polhill gun emplacements ====
The well-preserved Polhill anti-aircraft gun emplacements date from March 1942: built for the capital&#x27;s defence in response to fears of Japanese air-raids or invasion. Once completed the battery had accommodation for 109 army personnel.

The battery stands slightly north of the wind turbine within Panorama Heights subdivision, on a site allocated as reserve land. The site backs on to the firebreak running around the Zealandia wildlife sanctuary.

Street names

When a syndicate led by J.F.E. Wright (a Wellington Provincial Councillor between 1861 and 1863, and then for Karori and Mākara between 1873 and 1876) subdivided Brooklyn, it named a number of its streets after former US Presidents:

* Grover Cleveland (in office: 1885-1889 and 1893–1897) - Cleveland Street
* Calvin Coolidge (in office: 1923–1929) - Coolidge Street
* James Garfield - Garfield Street
* William Henry Harrison - Harrison Street
* Herbert Hoover (in office: 1929–1933) - Hoover Street
* Thomas Jefferson - Jefferson Street
* Abraham Lincoln - Lincoln Street
* William McKinley - McKinley Crescent
* William Taft - Taft Street
* George Washington - Washington Avenue
Street names with connections to the Fitchett family include Bruce Avenue (named after Bruce Fitchett, grandson of John Fitchett), Laura Avenue (after Laura Walters, who married Ashton B.Fitchett) and Helen Street (after Helen Fitchett, daughter of Ashton B.Fitchett). Reuben Avenue was named after Reuben Short, a long-time employee of John Fitchett. Karepa Street, Apuka Street and Tanera Crescent were named after local Māori who were also employed by John Fitchett. Bretby Street was named after John Fitchett&#x27;s birthplace in Derbyshire.

== Notable buildings and sites ==

=== Architectural styles ===
Brooklyn features a number of different styles of buildings, although very few of the older cottage style remain. One of the oldest recorded in the general area stands in Nairn Street in the neighbouring suburb of Mount Cook. It dates from 1858, and hosts The Colonial Cottage Museum. Brooklyn itself contains examples of many building styles including:

* Villa (Simple villas) - from c. 1895
* Bay villa - from c. 1910
* California bungalow - from c. 1920
* State Housing - between 1930 and 1940
* Bungalow - from c. 1960

==== Villa (Simple villas) ====
The Simple Villa, a style of home built from around 1895, often appears in the form of structures larger than the cottages and Victorian style properties built prior to this time. They generally consisted of a hallway with two rooms off each side and an indoor bathroom at the end. Often a &quot;lean-to&quot; attached to the back of the house would allow for a storage area that might include a wash-house. With the design of the property having the chimney within the house (as opposed to attached to an exterior side wall) fireplaces in the sitting room and kitchen could both use the same chimney — a configuration known as &quot;back-to-back&quot;. Brooklynites built these homes from timber — with most of the period features (including architraves, skirting-boards, doors and windows) purchasable as standard items from timber merchants.

=== Buildings of special interest ===

* The Sutch House, designed by Ernst Plischke and built between 1953 and 1956, stands on Todman Street. The house shows influences of the Austrian Neues Bauen (New Construction) movement to which Plischke had belonged in the 1930s. Wellington architect Alistair Luke restored the Sutch House during 2003 and the restoration project later received the 2004 New Zealand Institute of Architects Resene Award for Enduring Architecture.
* Tower Studio (located on Karepa Street), a purpose-built five-level Tuscan tower, takes its inspiration from the towers of San Gimignano in Tuscany. It overlooks the native bush reserve in Brooklyn with an open belvedere offering 360° views.
* Brick houses in Tanera Crescent: in 1903, Ashton B. Fitchett built a brickworks in Tanera Crescent. The brickyard chimney was demolished in 1926. Some of the houses and a number of walls in that area are built with bricks from the Brooklyn Brickworks.
* The Cornerstore is the wedge-shaped building on the corner of the intersection of Ohiro Road and Todman Street. It was probably built (along with other buildings in the nearby area) by William and Frederick Ferkins in around 1903 and sold to George Goldstein for £750. The ground floor was later divided into shops which from 1909 onwards included a bootmaker, fishmongers, butchers and confectioners. In 1988, Lois Daish converted the shops into the Brooklyn Café and Grill which became a popular local restaurant. Several other restaurants followed in the same building after Lois Daish sold the Brooklyn Café, and today it is the site of the Salty Pidgin.
* The Old Post Office at 22 Cleveland Street was the Brooklyn Post Office for 75 years. Parkin Brothers won the contract to build the new Post Office which opened some time before May 1914. (Up until then, the post office formed part of the general store run by Mrs Ferkins on the corner of Ohiro Road and Cleveland Street.) The mailroom and telephone exchange were on the ground floor and the top storey formed living quarters for the postmaster. There were two doors opening onto Cleveland Street as one allowed access to the private mailboxes while the other led to the public area and service counter. Along with many other small post offices, the Brooklyn Post Office closed in 1989 when the New Zealand Post Office became a state owned enterprise, and it was then turned into a private residence.
* Central Park Hospital on Ohiro Rd (originally called the Benevolent Home, and later the Ohiro Home) was established in 1892 on land that had been part of the Town Belt. In the 1930s, it came under the administration of the Wellington Hospital Board. It closed in 1977 and was demolished in 1977.

=== House prices ===
Between 2017 and 2021 the median house sale price in Brooklyn increased from $690,000 to $1.1 million. As of 2021, the median rental in Brooklyn is $685.

== Facilities and amenities ==

=== Cinema ===
Brooklyn hosts the Penthouse Cinema, located on Ohiro Road just south of Cleveland Street. Constructed for the Ranish family in the art deco style, it opened on 15 June 1939 as the Vogue Theatre. The Ranish family ran the cinema until 1951, when the Vogue Company Limited took over. The Vogue Company turned the cinema into a television studio where TV commercials were shot. The building was renamed the Penthouse Cinema when it was bought by Merv and Carol Kisby in 1975. Since then additional screens have been added, as well as refurbishment of the interior in keeping with its original style.

=== Library ===
Brooklyn has a branch library, opened on 16 February 1905 at 22 Harrison Street as the second branch library of the main Central Library. It opened with 350 books and for 9 hours per week; the Librarian lived in a flat at the rear of the building. In 1960 the library moved to the present building on the corner of Harrison and Cleveland Streets. The original entrance was in Harrison Street, but in 1992 this was closed and ramp access provided in Cleveland Street, enabling pushchairs to enter easily. The original building is now the Brooklyn Playcentre.

=== Fire station ===
The Brooklyn Fire Station on Cleveland Street was opened by Sir Māui Pōmare on 10 July 1928. This replaced the earlier fire service which operated with a handcart and pump, and later a horse and cart, in a building where the Scout Hall now stands on Harrison Street.

=== Sporting facilities ===
The Wellington Renouf Tennis Centre on Brooklyn Rd, near Central Park, is named after Frank Renouf, a Wellington businessman and keen supporter and follower of tennis.

=== Playgrounds ===
Playgrounds include the Central Park play area, the Harrison Street play area and the Mitchell Street play area.

=== Brooklyn Community Centre ===
The Brooklyn Community Centre is owned, managed and maintained by the Brooklyn Community Association which marked its 75th anniversary in 2022.

=== Churches ===
* Wellington Korean Church: 184 Ohiro Road, Brooklyn, Wellington (Wellington Christ&#x27;s Letter Church At the Korean Presbyterian Church of Jesus in Daeyangju (Gosin Overseas)). This was formerly Brooklyn Baptist Church, which opened on 10 July 1910, with morning and evening services preached by Rev. A. Dewdney. It closed for Baptist services in April 2002.
* Reformed Church of Wellington: 36 Harrison Street, Brooklyn, Wellington (evangelical in approach, and reformed in theology)
* Anglican/Two Todman: 2 Todman Street, Brooklyn, Wellington - Two Todman is run by the Brooklyn Anglicans. Its four spaces include a Co-Working Office, Community Space, Chapel and Op-Shop.
* CLOSED - St Matthew&#x27;s Anglican/Joint Parish (St Matthew&#x27;s combined Anglican, Methodist and Presbyterian groups in the 1970s), 96 Washington Avenue, Brooklyn, Wellington. The site was sold by the Anglican church and has been developed into a multi unit residential development.
* CLOSED - St Bernard&#x27;s Church (Catholic), 37 Taft Street, Brooklyn, Wellington closed in 2021 in the face of a shrinking congregation and the costs of maintenance and repairs.

=== Malaysian High Commission ===
The Malaysian High Commission occupies the corner of Washington Avenue and Brooklyn Road.

== Transportation ==

Brooklyn is served by routes 7, 17 and 29 on the Metlink network. On a number of occasions, buses have become stuck on the narrow corners of Brooklyn roads. In 2023, a bus was halted on a narrow street until local residents moved their parked cars.

In 2021, a trial bike/scooter lane was installed on the uphill section of Brooklyn hill from Nairn Street to Ohiro Road.

==Education==

=== Brooklyn School ===

Brooklyn School is a co-educational state school (primary through to intermediate) for Year 1 to 8 students (6 to 12 year olds), with a roll of as of .

The first school in the area opened in Vogeltown on 3 September 1883. In 1898, the School Board bought some land in Brooklyn between Washington Avenue and Harrison Street and the school building was moved to that site. The school opened in October 1898. The head teacher was Mr John Hopkirk and Miss Jessie Fitchett was the infant mistress. More classrooms were added over the following years. A new Infant Block was opened on 14 August 1930. Miss Jessie Fitchett retired in 1929 and Mr John Hopkirk retired in 1931.

=== St Bernard&#x27;s School ===

St Bernard&#x27;s School is a co-educational state-integrated Catholic primary school for Year 1 to 8 students, with a roll of as of .

The school started in 1935 when the Sisters of Mercy provided two sisters, Boniface and Fabian. It opened on 5 February of that year as St Anthony&#x27;s School Brooklyn, in the church on Jefferson Street - the church itself opened in June 1911. At the time the school opened 44 Catholic children attended the local state school, 43 of whom transferred to St Anthony&#x27;s on opening day. By the end of the year the roll had risen to 69.

The building remained as one large church hall, installing a temporary partition during the week to create a second classroom. On Fridays after school had finished the partition and desks were removed and replaced with pews for the Mass on Sunday, after which the desks and partition were put back ready for school on Monday morning.

In 1949 the then Parish Priest Father Paul Kane procured land at the site on Taft Street. The parish re-located the church and had a new school built. However, in 1961 the parish and the school changed their name: the Priest who enacted this bore the name &quot;Bernard&quot;. The Sisters of Mercy continued to run the school until 1973 when Doreen Barry became the first lay Principal.

=== Early childhood education services ===
Local early childhood education providers include Brooklyn Playcentre, Brooklyn Kindergarten and Brooklyn Kids Early Childhood Education.

== Notable people ==
