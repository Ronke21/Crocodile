<text>The Nature Coast is an informal, unofficial region of the U.S. state of Florida. The broadest definition of the Nature Coast includes the eight counties which abut the Gulf of Mexico along the Big Bend Coast as defined by geologists. From west to east the counties are Wakulla, Jefferson, Taylor, Dixie, Levy, Citrus, Hernando, and Pasco. (Note that the Big Bend Coast differs from the Big Bend region of Florida.) The name &quot;Nature Coast&quot; was originally devised as part of a marketing campaign to promote tourism in Levy, Citrus, Hernando, and parts of Marion and Pasco counties.

Many businesses and organizations incorporate &quot;Nature Coast&quot; in their names, but most of them do not explicitly define the region, or define a smaller region. For instance, the Nature Coast State Trail, which is officially designated as part of Florida’s Statewide System of Greenways and Trails is located in Dixie, Gilchrist and Levy counties. The Nature Coast Aquatic Preserve includes of coastal water in Citrus, Hernando and Pasco counties. The Nature Coaster website covers only Citrus, Hernando, and Pasco counties.

The lower southern end (Pasco, Hernando, and Citrus County) are often considered part of the Tampa Bay Area.

Activities common in this area include hunting, fishing, boating, bird watching and nature hiking. Snorkeling spots are found in the rivers along the Nature Coast. Diving and manatee tours are available, predominantly in areas such as Crystal River, Homosassa and Homosassa Springs. The Nature Coast is home to wildlife including deer, wild pigs, roseate spoonbills, alligators, raccoons, opossums, snakes, great blue herons, egrets, turtles and at least 19 endangered species.

There are 50 golf courses in the area.

<doc id="1332806" wikidata="Q7830899" url="?curid=1332806" title="Toyota UZ engine">
<text>The [[Toyota]] UZ engine family is a gasoline fueled 32-valve quad-camshaft V8 piston engine series used in Toyota&#x27;s luxury offerings and sport utility vehicles. Three variants have been produced: the 1UZ-FE, 2UZ-FE, and 3UZ-FE. Production spanned 24 years, from 1989 to mid 2013, ending with the final production of the 3UZ-FE-powered Toyota Crown Majesta I-FOUR. Toyota&#x27;s UZ engine family was replaced by the UR engine family.


==1UZ-FE==
The all-alloy 1UZ-FE debuted in 1989 in the first generation Lexus LS 400/Toyota Celsior and the engine was progressively released across a number of other models in the Toyota/Lexus range. The engine is oversquare by design, with a bore and stroke size of . It has proven to be a strong, reliable and smooth powerplant with features such as 6-bolt main bearings and belt-driven quad-camshafts. The water pump is also driven by the timing/cam belt. The connecting rods and crankshaft are constructed of steel. The pistons are hypereutectic.

The FV2400-2TC derivative is one of the few road-going engines that is FAA approved for use in an airplane.

Its resemblance to a race engine platform (6 bolt cross mains and over square configuration) was confirmed in 2007 by David Currier (in an interview with v-eight.com), vice president of TRD USA, stating that the 1UZ platform was based on CART/IRL engine design. It was planned to be used on GT500 vehicles, however its subsequent use in the Daytona Prototype use had not been planned.

In its original, Japanese domestic market trim with 10.0:1 compression, power output is , torque of . The European-market version produces a claimed .

The engine was slightly revised in 1995 with lighter connecting rods and pistons and an increased compression ratio to 10.4:1 resulting in peak power of at 5,400 rpm and torque of at 4,400 rpm.

In 1997, Toyota&#x27;s VVT-i variable valve timing technology was introduced along with a further compression ratio increase to 10.5:1, bumping power and torque to at 5,900 rpm and at 4,100 rpm. For the GS 400, output was rated at at 6,000 rpm and at 4,000 rpm.

The 1UZ-FE was voted to the Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines list for 1998 through 2000.

Applications (calendar years):
* 1989–2000 Lexus LS 400/Toyota Celsior
* 1989–2002 Toyota Crown/Toyota Crown Majesta
* 1989–2004 Toyota HiAce HiMedic Ambulance (Japan only)

* 1995–1997 SARD MC8/MC8-R
* 2006–2012 Mooncraft Shiden MC/RT-16 (non-production)

==2UZ-FE==
The 2UZ-FE was a version built in Tahara, Aichi, Japan and at Toyota Motor Manufacturing Alabama. Unlike its other UZ counterparts, this version uses a cast iron block to increase durability, as it was designed for low-revving, high-torque pickup and SUV applications. Its bore and stroke is . Output varies by implementation, but one VVT-i variant produces at 4800 rpm with of torque at 3400 rpm. JDM versions produce at 4800 rpm and at 3600 rpm, while Australian models produce at 4800 rpm and at 3600 rpm.

Like the 1UZ-FE, it has aluminum DOHC cylinder heads, multi-port fuel injection, 4 valves per cylinder with bucket tappets, one-piece cast camshafts, and a cast aluminum intake manifold. For 2010, it was replaced by the 1UR-FE or 3UR-FE, depending on the country.

Applications (calendar years):
* 2002–2004 Lexus GX 470
* 1998–2005 Lexus LX 470
* 1998–2005 Toyota Land Cruiser
* 2002–2004 Toyota 4Runner
* 1999–2004 Toyota Tundra
* 2000–2004 Toyota Sequoia

Toyota Racing Development offered a bolt-on supercharger kit for the 2000–2003 Tundra/Sequoia and the 1998–2003 LX 470.

Another 2UZ-FE variation adds VVT-i, electronic throttle control, and a plastic intake manifold.

Applications (calendar years):
* 2004–2009 Lexus GX 470
* 2005–2007 Lexus LX 470
* 2005–2009 Toyota 4Runner

* 2005–2009 Toyota Tundra
* 2004–2009 Toyota Sequoia
* 2007–2012 Lexus LX 470 (Hong Kong only)

==3UZ-FE==
The 3UZ-FE is a version built in Japan. Bore and stroke is 
. Output is at 5600 rpm with of torque at 3400 rpm. The engine block and heads are aluminum. It has a DOHC valvetrain with 4 valves per cylinder and VVT-i. It uses SEFI fuel injection. In 2003, the engine was paired with a six-speed automatic transmission, resulting in improved fuel economy over the previous five-speed automatic. The maximum engine speed is 6,500 RPM.

A 4.5 L version replaced the 3S-GTE as the engine used in Toyota&#x27;s Super GT race cars up to 2009 and a 5.0 L version was used in the Grand American Road Racing (Grand Am) Series.

Applications (calendar years):
* Lexus LS 430 (2000–2006)
* Lexus GS 430 (2000–2007)
* Lexus SC 430/Toyota Soarer (2001–2010)

==Derivatives==

===FV2400-2TC===
In 1997, the US Federal Aviation Administration granted production certification for the FV2400-2TC, a twin-turbocharged airplane powerplant based on the 1UZ-FE. The FV2400 was developed in partnership with Hamilton Standard, which provided the digital engine-control system. The goal was to produce a four-seat propeller aircraft.

===VT300i===
In 1998, a marine derivative of the UZ powerplant was produced for boating applications. The 4.0 L VT300i engine, producing at 6000 rpm and at 4200 rpm, used the same block as the UZ engine on the Lexus SC 400, GS 400, and LS 400.

Applications (calendar years):
*1998 Toyota Epic S21
* 1999–2001 Toyota Epic S22/SX22

<text>Hyères (), Provençal Occitan: &quot;Ieras&quot; in classical norm, or &quot;Iero&quot; in Mistralian norm) is a commune in the Var department in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur region in southeastern France.

The old town lies from the sea clustered around the Castle of Saint Bernard, which is set on a hill. Between the old town and the sea lies the pine-covered hill of Costebelle, which overlooks the peninsula of Giens. Hyères is the oldest resort on the French Riviera.

==History==

===Hellenic Olbia===
The Hellenic city of &quot;Olbia&quot; () was refounded on the Phoenician settlement that dated to the fourth century BC; Olbia is mentioned by the geographer Strabo (IV.1.5) as a city of the Massiliotes that was fortified &quot;against the tribe of the Salyes and against those Ligures who live in the Alps&quot;. Greek and Roman antiquities have been found in the area.

===Middle Ages===
The first reference to the town Hyères dates from 963. Originally a possession of the Viscount of Marseilles, it was later transferred to Charles of Anjou. Louis IX King of France (often known as &quot;St Louis&quot;) landed at Hyères in 1254 when returning from the crusades.

A commandry of the Knights Templar was based at the town in the 12th century, outside the town walls. The remaining remnant is the tower Saint-Blaise.

===20th century===
After defecting from Soviet intelligence in 1937, Walter Krivitsky hid in Hyères (one of the farthest points in France from his operational base in Paris).

===World War II===
As part of Operation Dragoon on 15 August 1944, the First Special Service Force came ashore off the coast of Hyères to take the islands of Port-Cros and Levant. The small German garrisons offered little resistance and the whole eastern part of Port-Cros was secured by 06:30. All fighting was over on Levant by the evening, but, on Port-Cros, the Germans withdrew into old thick-walled forts. It was only when naval guns were brought to bear that they realised that further resistance was useless.

An intense naval barrage on 18 August 1944 heralded the next phase of the operation—the assault on the largest of the Hyères islands, Porquerolles. French forces—naval units and colonial formations, including Senegalese infantry—became involved on 22 August and subsequently occupied the island. A US–Canadian Special Forces landing at the eastern end of Porquerolles took large numbers of prisoners, the Germans preferring not to surrender to the Senegalese.

==Geography==
Its position facing the Mediterranean to the south makes it popular with tourists in the winter and makes it ideal for the cultivation of palm trees. About 100,000 trees are exported from the area each year. As a result, the town is frequently referred to as Hyères-les-Palmiers (&quot;palmiers&quot; meaning palm trees).

The three islands of the Îles d&#x27;Hyères (namely, Porquerolles, Port-Cros, and the Île du Levant) are just offshore. Porquerolles and Port-Cros form the Port-Cros National Park.

The commune has a land area of .

===Climate===

The city of Hyères has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;) and it is one of the warmest cities in France. Winters are relatively mild and summers are hot, with maximum temperatures often surpassing . It is also one of the driest cities in France, with barely 57 rainy days per year and almost rainless summers.
Hyères is located on the Côte d&#x27;Azur and enjoys a Mediterranean climate with hot and dry summers and mild and relatively humid winters. The harbor can be subjected to strong winds, with a record set at 183.3 km/h on 3 March 1995. The mistral blows there, although the municipality is sheltered to the north by the Massif des Maures (the mistral coming from the west, and swaying to the east, south of the Rhône Valley therefore reaches it). It is sometimes exposed to the east (or &quot;east wind&quot;) that rushes into the harbor between the island of Port-Cros and Cape Bénat but is protected dusirocco by the island of Porquerolles and the peninsula of Giens. On an annual average, the temperature stands at 15.9 °C with a maximum average of 20.1 °C and a minimum of 11.8 °C. The maximum and minimum nominal temperatures recorded are 29 °C in July–August and 6 °C in January and February, mild values thanks to the presence of the Mediterranean and the Toulon agglomeration. Frost days are quite rare but on 10 February 1986 the temperature was raised by −7.5 °C. Conversely, on 7 July 1982 a temperature of 40.1 °C set a record. The average sunshine is 2,899.3 hours per year with a peak of 373.8 hours in July. Another important value, characteristic of the Mediterranean climate, rainfall totals 665 millimeters in Hyères over the year, a relatively low value compared to other municipalities around the Mediterranean and especially the rains are very unevenly distributed with less than seven millimeters in July and nearly ninety-four millimeters in October. The record rainfall recorded in twenty-four hours was 156 millimetres on 16 January 1978; as of 15 June 2010 it now stands at 200 millimetres.


&lt;br&gt;
==Population==

==British and Americans in Hyères, 18th to early 20th centuries==

Lord Albemarle, the British ambassador, stayed in Hyères during the winter 1767–1768, and Prince Augustus, sixth son of George III, stayed there in the winter of 1788 for health reasons. The English agronomist Arthur Young visited Hyères on the advice of Lady Craven on 10 September 1789. He mentioned the many British living there in his book &quot;Travels in France&quot;. The London-born and Eton-educated Anglo-Grison Charles de Salis died in Hyères in July 1781, aged 45, and was buried in the Convent des Cordeliers.

In 1791, Charlotte Turner Smith published her novel &quot;Celestina&quot;, which is set in Hyères. During the period of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, the British left the area, but they returned after 1815. Joseph Conrad, who lived for a while in Hyères, wrote his novel &quot;The Rover&quot;, which is set in Hyères, during those years.

William FitzRoy, 6th Duke of Grafton, spent the winter and spring each year at Hyères because he and his wife suffered from ill health. Edwin Lee M.D. published in 1857 a book on the virtues of the climate of Hyères for the recovery of pulmonary consumption and in November 1880 Adolphe Smith first published &quot;The Garden of Hyères&quot;, which is still in print, (see Hachette edition of 2012).

In 1883, Robert Louis Stevenson came to Hyères and for about two years lived first at the Grand Hotel (the building still stands in the Avenue des Iles d&#x27;Or), and then in a chalet called &quot;Solitude&quot; in the present rue Victor-Basch. He wrote then: &quot;That spot our garden and our view are sub-celestial. I sing daily with Bunian, that great bard. I dwell next door to Heaven!&quot; In later years, he wrote from his retreat in Valima: &quot;Happy (said I); I was only happy once; that was at Hyères&quot;.

In 1884, Elisabeth Douglas, daughter of Alfred, Lord Douglas, had a small &quot;cottage&quot;, as she called it, built on the Costebelle hill by the architect Thomas Donaldson, who used to spend his winters in Hyères during those years.

Lord Arthur Somerset, formerly of the Royal Horse Guards and head of the stables to the future King Edward VII fled to Europe in 1889 to escape arrest after being associated with the Cleveland Street scandal. He spent his final 37 years living with his partner in a villa in Hyères.

The British presence culminated in the winter of 1892 (21 March – 25 April) when Queen Victoria came for a stay of three weeks at the Albion Hotel. At that time, the British influence was so strong that shop signs were in both French and English. There was an English butcher, a chemist, two banks, and two golf courses. There were also two English churches (plus one at the Grand Hôtel in Costebelle), whose buildings still exist: All Saints&#x27; Church at Costebelle and Saint Paul&#x27;s English Church, Avenue Beauregard.

Some signs of this English presence have vanished, like the small dell in the cemetery where there were once some hundred graves. Some of these, such as those of Lord Arthur Somerset or Richard John Meade, bore testimony to the aristocratic nature of the community. Other vestiges remain, like the fountain near the new public library in a square shaded by a plane tree. The inscription reads: &quot;In loving memory of Marianne Stewart who died on 18 August 1900. She laboured many years in the cause of mercy to animals. Her last wish was that a drinking fountain should be set up for them in Hyères&quot;.

Many wounded British soldiers were sent to the town to convalesce during World War I.

The American novelist Edith Wharton wintered in Hyères annually from 1919 until her death in 1937. The garden of her villa, Castel Sainte-Claire, is open to the public. The villa previously belonged to Olivier Voutier, a French naval officer, whose grave is in the garden; it was Voutier who discovered the Venus de Milo in 1820 on the Aegean island of Milos.

==Transportation==
The railway station Gare d&#x27;Hyères offers connections with Toulon, Marseille, Paris, and several regional destinations.

The airport, which is known officially as the Toulon–Hyères International Airport, is to the southeast of the town centre, on a sandy plain close to the seashore. The area was first used by private aircraft at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1920, after the marsh had been drained, French naval aircraft used the field, and, in 1925, it became an official base of the French Fleet Air Arm (Aéronavale). It has been a commercial airport since 1966, but the navy maintains a significant facility for helicopters and fixed wing aircraft within the perimeter.

There are currently (2009) scheduled flights to and from Stockholm, Bristol, Ajaccio, Paris, London, Brest, Brussels, and Rotterdam.

== People ==
Hyères was the birthplace of Jean Baptiste Massillon (1663–1742), churchman and preacher as well as Marius Gueit (1808– 1862), blind composer, organist and cellist.

The author Jean-Marie-Edmond Sabran (1908–1994), who wrote under the pseudonyms Paul Berna (children&#x27;s fiction), Bernard Deleuse and Paul Gerradwas (adult fiction), and Joel Audrenn (crime novels), was born in Hyères as well as François Coupry (born 1947), winner of the 1970 edition of the Prix des Deux Magots.

The French historian Jules Michelet frequently spent the winter at Hyères. He died from a heart attack at Hyères on 9 February 1874. He was interred at Hyères. Following his widow&#x27;s request, a Paris court granted permission for his body to be exhumed on 13 May 1876.

The Member of Parliament Édith Audibert was born in Hyères.

==Twin towns==
Hyères is twinned with Rottweil, Germany and with Koekelberg, Belgium.

==Culture==
Hyères is home to the Hyères International Fashion and Photography Festival, a huge fashion and art photography event that has taken place annually at the end of April since 1985. This festival was among the first to recognize the talents of Viktor &amp; Rolf.

The city also plays host to the annual MIDI French Riviera Festival in July, a music festival now into its sixth episode. 2010&#x27;s MIDI saw around 15 acts play at the Villa Noailles complex and brought the new &#x27;MIDI Night&#x27; event to Almanarre Beach in the early hours of Sunday morning.

There is a football club called Hyères FC. Football stadiums include the Stade Perruc, Stade Gaby Robert and the Stade Jean Berteau, which was commissioned in 1978 and has a capacity of 600.

<text>NZB is an XML-based file format for retrieving posts from NNTP (Usenet) servers. The format was conceived by the developers of the Newzbin.com Usenet Index. NZB is effective when used with search-capable websites. These websites create NZB files out of what is needed to be downloaded. Using this concept, headers would not be downloaded hence the NZB method is quicker and more bandwidth-efficient than traditional methods.

Each Usenet message has a unique identifier called the &quot;Message-ID&quot;. When a large file is posted to a Usenet newsgroup, it is usually divided into multiple messages (called segments or parts) each having its own Message-ID. An NZB-capable Usenet client will read all needed Message-IDs from the NZB file, download them and decode the messages back into a binary file (usually using yEnc or Uuencode).

<doc id="1332848" wikidata="Q1580339" url="?curid=1332848" title="Père Noël">
<text>Père Noël (), &quot;Father Christmas&quot;, sometimes called &#x27;Papa Noël&#x27; (&quot;Dad Christmas&quot;), is a legendary gift-bringer at Christmas in France and other French-speaking areas, identified with the Father Christmas and/or Santa Claus of English-speaking territories. Though they were traditionally different, all of them are now the same character, with different names, and the shared characteristics of a red outfit, workshop at the North Pole/Lapland, and a team of reindeer.

According to tradition, on Christmas Eve children leave their shoes by the fireplace filled with carrots and treats for Père Noël&#x27;s donkey, Gui (French for &quot;Mistletoe&quot;) before they go to bed. Père Noël takes the offerings and, if the child has been good, leaves presents in their place. Presents are traditionally small enough to fit in the shoes; candy, money or small toys.

Père Noël is sometimes confused with another, older character. In Eastern France (Alsace and Lorraine regions), in the Netherlands, in Belgium, in Germany, in Switzerland and in Eastern Europe (and nowadays also in the eastern states of the US) there is a parallel tradition to celebrate &quot;Saint Nicolas&quot; or &quot;Sinterklaas&quot; on December 5 or 6. He is followed by &quot;Le Père Fouettard&quot;, who exists also in different parts of Germany (&quot;Knecht Ruprecht&quot; or &quot;Belsnickel&quot;), Austria (&quot;Krampus&quot;), the Netherlands and Belgium (&quot;Zwarte Piet&quot; in Dutch, &quot;Le Père Fouettard&quot; in French). &quot;Le Père Fouettard&quot; is a sinister figure dressed in black who accompanies &quot;Saint Nicolas&quot; and spanks children who have behaved badly.

In Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil, due to the influence of French culture in the 19th century, the name of Papá Noel/Papai Noel was adopted, opposing for example the name of Pai Natal in Portugal. In Turkey there is Noel Baba.

In Louisiana Cajun culture, a version of Papa Noël is modeled after Santa Claus, in which he arrives at homes in a pirogue towed by eight alligators. In some families, his visit is followed by the arrival of a figure called &quot;La Christine&quot; on New Year&#x27;s Eve bearing sweets and nuts; in others, La Christine is simply another designation for Santa Claus.

<text>[[Count]] Mikhail Fedotovich Kamensky (; 19 May 1738 – 12 August 1809) was a Russian nobleman, a noted Field Marshal who distinguished himself in the Catherinian wars and the Napoleonic campaigns.

== Biography ==
Mikhail Kamensky served as a volunteer in the French army in 1758-1759. He then took part in the Seven Years&#x27; War. In 1783, Kamensky was appointed Governor General of Ryazan and Tambov guberniyas. During the war with Turkey, in 1788, he defeated the Turks at the Moldavian settlement of Gangur. In the previous war with the Turks, he had helped Alexander Suvorov, who had earned a reputation as one of Russia&#x27;s great generals, to win the victory at Kozludzha, which ended the war. When prince Potemkin fell ill and entrusted his command of the army to Mikhail Kakhovsky, Kamensky refused to subordinate himself, referring to his seniority. For this, he was discharged from military service.

On 5 April 1797, Emperor Paul I granted Kamensky the title of Count in the Russian Empire and made him retire. In 1806, Nicholas I of Russia appointed him commander-in-chief of the Russian army in Prussia, which had been fighting the French armies of Napoleon. After six days of being in command, on the eve of the battle of Pułtusk, he transferred the command to Friedrich Wilhelm Graf von Buxhoeveden under pretence of illness and left for his estate near Oryol.

==Death==
Kamensky was notorious for his maltreatment of his serfs, and he was killed by one of them on 12 August 1809, at the age of 71. His death occasioned a sentimental poem by Vasily Andreyevich Zhukovsky, Russian poet of the 1810s and a leading figure in Russian literature in the first half of the 19th century.

==Descendants==
He was married to Princess Anna Pavlovna Shcherbatova (1749-1826), the daughter of Prince Pavel Nikolaevich Shcherbatov (1722-1781) and his wife, Princess Maria Feodorovna Golitsyna (1709-1769). He was the father of two Russian Generals: Sergei Mikhailovich Kamensky and Nikolai Mikhailovich Kamensky. Through his son Sergei, British actress and Academy Awards winner, Helen Mirren, DBE and her cousin, Tania Mallet, an actress, model and former Bond girl are also among his direct descendants.

<text>Joseph &quot;Sandy&quot; Saddler (June 23, 1926 – September 18, 2001) was an American professional boxer. He was a two-time featherweight world champion, having also held the super featherweight title. Over his twelve-year career (1944–56), Saddler scored 104 knockouts and was stopped only once himself, in his second professional fight, by Jock Leslie. Considered to be one of the hardest hitting featherweights, Saddler was ranked number five on &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;100 Greatest Punchers of All Time&quot;. His nephew is Grandmaster Flash.

==Professional career==

Saddler is best known for his four-bout series with Willie Pep. However, he had 93 fights prior to facing Pep.

=== Early career ===
Saddler turned Pro at Bantamweight winning his pro-debut &amp; losing his second fight, he fought 10 more times at Bantamweight &amp; had a record of 85-6-2 prior to facing Willie Pep, Saddler record included a loss to Phil Terranova &amp; a Draw with Jimmy Carter

=== Facing Willie Pep ===
The two first faced off on October 29, 1948. Pep was the reigning featherweight champion of the world, and coming into the fight boasted a record of 134-1-1 (43 KO). Saddler was the underdog &amp; captured the title by knocking Pep down four times en route to a four-round knockout victory. This was only the second time that Pep was beaten, Sammy Angott beat him in 1943, and first time he was ever stopped in 137 bouts.

Pep then recaptured the crown on February 11, 1949, by outpointing Saddler over 15 rounds. Saddler regained the crown on September 8, 1950, by a TKO in the eighth round. Pep quit after dislocating his shoulder. The pair fought their last fight on September 26, 1951. In one of the dirtiest championship fights ever fought, Saddler won when the fight was stopped in the tenth round.

Saddler fought several other notable opponents during his career. He knocked out future lightweight champion Joe Brown, as well as lightweight champions Lauro Salas and Paddy DeMarco. Saddler beat lightweight champion Jimmy Carter, knocked out future junior lightweight champion Gabriel &quot;Flash&quot; Elorde, and lost to Larry Boardman.

<doc id="1332896" wikidata="Q1267134" url="?curid=1332896" title="Ferhat Pasha Mosque (Banja Luka)">
<text>Ferhat Pasha Mosque (, ), also known as the Ferhadija Mosque, is a mosque in the city of Banja Luka and one of the greatest achievements of Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s 16th century Ottoman Islamic architecture. The mosque was demolished in 1993 at the order of the authorities of Republika Srpska as a part of an ethnic cleansing campaign, and was rebuilt and opened on 7 May 2016.

Commissioned by the Bosnian Sanjak-bey Ferhad Pasha Sokolović, the mosque was built in 1579 with money that, as tradition has it, were paid by the Auersperg family for the severed head of the Habsburg general Herbard VIII von Auersperg and the ransom for the general&#x27;s son after a battle at the Croatian border in 1575, where Ferhad Pasha was triumphant.

The mosque, with its classical Ottoman architecture, was most probably designed by a pupil of Mimar Sinan. There is no written data about the builders who erected the mosque, but from analysing its architecture it appears that the foreman of the works was from Sinan&#x27;s school since the mosque shows obvious similarities with Sinan&#x27;s Muradiye Mosque in Manisa, which dates from 1586.

==Architectural ensemble==
The ensemble of the Ferhadija mosque consisted of the mosque itself, the courtyard, a graveyard, the fountain, 3 mausoleums (&quot;turbes&quot;) and the surrounding wall with the gate. The original canopied wall was pulled down after 1884 and a more massive wall partly of masonry and wrought iron was built with a new gate and a drinking fountain. In the courtyard there was an ablutions fountain (&quot;&quot;šadrvan&quot;&quot;) with a stone basin and twelve pipes. The water for the fountain was brought from a spring that is still known as &quot;Šadrvan&quot;. Above the stone basin was a decorative wrought iron trellis, and in the 19th century a wooden baldaquin and dome and painted attic in the so-called Turkish baroque style was added which was demolished in 1955. One of three small adjacent mausoleums - Ferhad Pasha Turbe - contained the tombs of Ferhad Pasha Sokolović, the others were for his granddaughter Safi-kaduna, and his ensign. A clock tower (&quot;Sahat kula&quot;) was added later.

Like most buildings of this type in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the mosque was on a modest scale: wide, long and high at the top of the main dome. The minaret was high. According to legend, when the mosque was completed in 1579, Ferhad Pasha had the masons locked inside this minaret, sentencing them to death so they could never make anything so beautiful, but one night they made wings and flew away.

Ferhadija was listed as a Bosnia and Herzegovina cultural heritage site in 1950. It was subsequently protected by UNESCO until its destruction in 1993. Today the site, with the mosque&#x27;s remains, is listed by the Commission to preserve National Monuments of Bosnia and Herzegovina (&quot;KONS&quot;) as a National monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

==Destruction==

The mosque was one of 16 destroyed in the city of Banja Luka during the Bosnian War between 1992 and 1995.

The Ferhadija and Arnaudija mosques were destroyed on the night of 6–7 May 1993 within 15 minutes of each other. May 6 is the date of the Serbian Orthodox holiday of Đurđevdan (Saint George&#x27;s day). The almost simultaneous destruction of the two mosques required large quantities of explosives and extensive coordination. This probably would not have been possible without the involvement of Banja Luka and Republika Srpska authorities.

The minaret of Ferhadija Mosque survived the first explosion, but was then razed to the ground.

Most of the debris was taken to a secret dump site; some stone, and ornamental details, were crushed for use as landfill or taken to a secret dump site. The leveled site was turned into a parking lot. Though Bosnian notables begged the Serb militia to keep the rubble, their pleas were denied. UN officials who tried to salvage pieces of the demolished mosque were detained by the Serb militia. Several weeks after the destruction of Ferhadija the nearby Sahat Kula, one of the oldest Ottoman clock towers in Europe, was also destroyed.

At the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, a Serb leader from Banja Luka, Radoslav Brđanin, was convicted for his part in organizing the destruction of Muslim property including mosques, and also in the ethnic cleansing of non-Serbs. He was sentenced to a single prison term of 32 years.

The Brđanin case proved that the destruction of the mosques was orchestrated as part of an ethnic cleansing campaign. In addition, the Bosnian side in the Bosnian genocide case at the International Court of Justice has cited the destruction of Ferhadija Mosque as one of the elements of ethnic cleansing and genocide employed by the RS authorities during the Bosnian War.

==Reconstruction==
In 2001, a building permit was granted to the Islamic Community of Banja Luka to reconstruct the mosque. On May 7, Serb nationalists attacked about 300 Bosniaks attending the ceremony to mark the laying of the cornerstone. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that about 1,000 Orthodox Christian Serbs participated in the attack and threw rocks and burned vehicles, a bakery, Muslim prayer rugs, and the flag on the Islamic center, where they hoisted the Bosnian Serb flag; drove a pig onto the site of the mosque as an insult to Muslims; and trapped 250 people in the Islamic center including the head of the UN in Bosnia, the ambassadors from Great Britain, Sweden and Pakistan, and other international and local officials. Bosnian Serb police eventually released them. More than 30 Bosniaks were injured and at least eight were taken to the Banja Luka hospital. One died later from head injuries. The disrupted ceremony took place on the 8th anniversary of the mosque&#x27;s destruction, a date subsequently chosen as Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s official Day of the Mosques. A few days later, in secret and under heavy security, the ceremony was performed successfully. But because of the earlier attack, reconstruction was not undertaken.

Although most of the mosques destroyed in Banja Luka in the Bosnian War have been reconstructed since 2001, Ferhadija is still a contentious issue. Work was delayed by the complexities involved in rebuilding it authentically. The Sarajevo School of Architecture&#x27;s Design and Research Center had prepared preliminary studies, and the cost of reconstruction was estimated at 12 million KM (around $8 million). A local magistrate ruled that the authorities of Banja Luka, which is Bosnian Serb-controlled, must pay $42 million to its Islamic community for the 16 local mosques (including Ferhadija Mosque) that were destroyed during the 1992-1995 Bosnian War. However, this ruling was subsequently overturned by the highest court in Sarajevo when the Serb Republic objected to paying for the damage caused by individual people.

The site, with its original architectural remains, is listed as a National Monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina. By Ruling of the &quot;KONS&quot; the building was placed under state protection and entered in the register of cultural monuments. The Regional Plan for Bosnia and Herzegovina to 2002 listed the Ferhat Pasha Mosque in Banja Luka as a Category I building under serial no. 38.

In June 2007, repairs were completed on the foundations that survived the destruction, and reconstruction of the masonry and the rest of the building was completed over the next nine years, with the mosque reopening on 7 May 2016.

==Notes and references==
Notes:

1&quot;The ICTY Trial Chamber is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt both that the expulsions and forcible removals were systematic throughout the Autonomous Region of Krajina (ARK), in which and from where tens of thousands of Bosniaks and Bosnian Croats were permanently displaced, and that this mass forcible displacement was intended to ensure the ethnic cleansing of the region. These people were left with no option but to escape. Those who were not expelled and did not manage to escape were subjected to intolerable living conditions imposed by the Serb authorities, which made it impossible for them to continue living there and forced them to seek permission to leave. Bosniaks and Bosnian Croats were subjected to movement restrictions, as well as to perilous living conditions; they were required to pledge their loyalty to the Serb authorities and in at least one case, to wear white armbands. They were dismissed from their jobs and stripped of their health insurance. Campaigns of intimidation specifically targeting Bosniaks and Bosnian Croats were undertaken.&quot;

2&quot;This process of ethnic cleansing was sometimes camouflaged as a process of resettlement of populations. In Banja Luka, the Agency for Population Movement and the Exchange of Material Wealth for the ARK (&quot;Agency&quot;), which was established on 12 June 1992 pursuant to a decision of the ARK Crisis Staff, aided in the implementation of both the exchange of flats and the resettlement of populations. The Agency was popularly known variously as &quot;Perka&#x27;s Agency&quot; or as &quot;Brđanin&#x27;s Agency&quot;. The ICTY Trial Chamber is of the view that although this Agency was set up for the exchange of flats and the resettlement of populations, this was nothing else but an integral part of the ethnic cleansing plan.&quot;

<doc id="1332901" wikidata="Q1098140" url="?curid=1332901" title="Hollow Man">
<text>Hollow Man is a 2000 science fiction horror thriller film directed by Paul Verhoeven, written by Andrew W. Marlowe, and starring Elisabeth Shue, Kevin Bacon, Josh Brolin, Kim Dickens, Greg Grunberg, Joey Slotnick, Mary Randle, and William Devane. The film is about Sebastian Caine, a scientist who volunteers to be the first human test subject for a serum that renders the user invisible. When his fellow scientists are unable to restore him back to normal, he becomes increasingly unstable and eventually goes on a killing spree. The film grossed $190 million worldwide but was not well received by critics. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects in 2001, losing to &quot;Gladiator&quot;.

A direct-to-video stand-alone sequel called &quot;Hollow Man 2&quot;, starring Christian Slater and Peter Facinelli, was released in 2006.

==Plot==
Brilliant but narcissistic scientist Sebastian Caine has developed a serum for the military that can make a subject invisible. His team includes ex-girlfriend Linda McKay, Matt Kensington, Sarah Kennedy, Janice Walton, Carter Abbey, and Frank Chase. The team succeeds in reversing the procedure, returning an invisible gorilla to visibility. Sebastian becomes infatuated with Linda again, but, unbeknownst to him, she has become involved with Matt.

Instead of reporting his success to the military, Sebastian lies to an oversight committee, which includes his mentor Howard Kramer, telling them he is close but needs more time. He convinces part of the team to go into human testing without military authorization, keeping the rest in the dark. The procedure is successful, and Sebastian turns completely invisible. He enjoys sneaking around the lab in order to scare and play pranks on his fellow co-workers, one of which involves molesting Sarah. The team becomes concerned that Sebastian is taking these pranks too far. The procedure to return him to visibility fails, and he is almost killed.

Sebastian is quarantined in the laboratory due to his condition, and the other researchers construct a latex mask for him to wear around the lab. With the constant testing done to him and being unable to cope with the isolation, he defies instructions, leaves the building and returns to his apartment. Once there, he quickly returns to his old habit of spying on his neighbor as she undresses - but this time realizes that he has the power and the freedom to take his voyeurism to the next step. Stripping naked, he sneaks into the woman&#x27;s apartment after she takes a shower. Sebastian follows her to the bedroom, where he disrobes and rapes her. Linda warns Sebastian that if he leaves again, she and Matt will tell the committee about the experiment. Ignoring their threat, Sebastian assembles a device that runs a video loop of his heat signature in his quarters. He leaves the lab again and spies on Linda and Matt, becoming enraged when he sees them about to have sex. He then smashes their bedroom window, and though the two lovers almost immediately suspect Caine as the culprit, the looped video feed immediately diverts any suspicion from him. Becoming increasingly unstable, Sebastian later kills a dog being used as a lab animal in a fit of rage.

The team discovers they have been watching a recording, and Sebastian has been leaving the lab without their knowledge. Linda and Matt go to Kramer&#x27;s house and confess their experiments. After they leave, Kramer attempts to alert the Army. Having followed Linda and Matt to the house, Sebastian cuts off Kramer&#x27;s phone connection, then drowns him in his swimming pool. The next day, Sebastian waits until the whole team is inside the lab before he disables the phones and elevator codes except for his own. The rest of the team congregates and decides to hunt Sebastian down and subdue him. At the same time, he begins to murder the team members one by one, with Janice being his first victim after falling behind the others.

Linda and the others hide in the lab, while Matt and Carter take tranquilizer guns to hunt for Sebastian using thermography goggles. Sebastian mortally wounds Carter before getting into a fight with Matt. Linda saves Matt. Sebastian then kills Sarah and Frank, and locks an injured Matt and Linda in the freezer, leaving them to die. Linda constructs an electromagnet using a defibrillator to open the door, then gathers materials to assemble a flamethrower. Meanwhile, Sebastian builds a makeshift bomb that will destroy the facility after he leaves using explosive chemicals and a centrifuge; he destroys the keyboard so that nobody can stop the machine.

Just as Sebastian enters the elevator, Linda fires the flamethrower at him. Badly burned but still alive, Sebastian escapes and the two fight. Before Sebastian can kill Linda, Matt strikes him with a crowbar. Sebastian recovers and approaches Matt and Linda from behind with the crowbar, but Matt deflects the blow, throwing Sebastian into a nearby circuit box, shocking him and rendering him partially visible. Linda and Matt find the bomb, but cannot stop it. They attempt to climb a ladder in the elevator shaft to escape as the bomb explodes. Despite his injuries, Sebastian grabs Linda&#x27;s ankle. He pulls her off the ladder and onto the top of the elevator. Sebastian asks Linda for one last kiss for old times sake, so while they kiss, Linda disconnects the elevator cables, causing the partially visible Sebastian to fall to his death down the shaft. Linda and Matt emerge from the burning lab and emergency personnel take them away in an ambulance.

==Production==
===Development===
Following the multi-layered and controversial &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; (1997), Paul Verhoeven wanted to tone down the levels of sex and violence in his next film, aiming to make a more &quot;conventionally commercial blockbuster&quot;. Approximately $50 million of the film&#x27;s $95 million budget was reserved for visual effects work, which was primarily worked on by Sony Pictures Imageworks (SPI) and Tippett Studio. Of the 560 visual effects shots in the film, approximately two-thirds were worked on by SPI and the remaining third by Tippett Studio. Verhoeven also storyboarded most of the film, as he had done with all of his American films after experiencing trouble coordinating the action of &quot;Flesh+Blood&quot; (1985). He maintains that over 90% of the film is how he storyboarded it, as it was expensive (costing up to $300,000) if he decided to change a camera movement.

William Goldman says he was sent the script which he thought was &quot;terrible... But I thought if the special effects worked, it could be a very, very exciting and different movie, and I’d never done special effects so I thought that could be interesting.&quot; He met with Verhoeven and realised the director liked the script but the studio wanted Goldman to rewrite it; the director said he would ignore anything Goldman did. &quot;So, basically, I started rewriting for a director, knowing he wouldn’t like anything that I was rewriting,&quot; said Goldman in 2000. &quot;I haven’t seen the movie, but I gather it sucks although the special effects are terrific. I’ll never know if it could have been saved.&quot;

===Filming===
The film was shot in chronological order, partially due to the fact that the laboratory set would be physically blown up near the end of the story, a sequence that was captured by 14 cameras at various angles. Principal photography began on April 16, 1999. Six weeks into filming, Elisabeth Shue tore her Achilles tendon, which shut down production on June 25 for over seven weeks. At one point, producers considered replacing her; however, shooting resumed on August 18, 1999, and ran until February 4, 2000 following her recovery.

&quot;Hollow Man&quot; was one of very few films allowed to shoot directly in front of The Pentagon building, with Verhoeven expressing surprise that the script was approved, because of the themes of the United States Government commissioning scientific experiments into making living beings invisible. Many of the location scenes were shot in and around Washington, D.C., with a restaurant set also being constructed in a building overlooking the U.S. Capitol. The laboratory scenes were shot at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California; the elevator shaft used in the film&#x27;s climax was built onto the side of the studio&#x27;s parking garage.

A thermal imaging camera was employed for scenes showing &quot;invisible&quot; animals (most notably Isabelle the gorilla) or Sebastian following his transformation and the unsuccessful attempt to restore him to visibility; the same technique was used for characters when they look through thermal goggles. As Isabelle was played in part by a man in a gorilla suit, crew members had to stand by and warm the suit with hair dryers in order for the thermal camera to accurately emulate an actual gorilla&#x27;s warmth.

Despite assumptions that Bacon would not be needed on set except when his character Sebastian is visible, Verhoeven and the crew realized after test footage was shot that he would need to be present to interact with the cast, as &quot;the other actors were stranded in empty space, and the scenes looked stiff, inorganic and unconvincing&quot; without him. Guy Pearce and Edward Norton were also considered for the role of Sebastian before Bacon was chosen, in part for his &quot;ability to be both charming and diabolical&quot;. At the time of &quot;Hollow Man&quot;″s release, Bacon recounted a &quot;bad morning&quot; on which, among other mishaps, he read a story in the press that suggested Robert Downey Jr. had been offered the film&#x27;s title role.

===Special effects===
To achieve the effects of Sebastian being invisible, Bacon was digitally removed from the footage and each scene was shot twice: once with the actors and once without, for the background to be able to be seen through Sebastian&#x27;s body. The crew used a motion-control camera, to ensure the same movements were achieved and the shots were then composited in post-production. For scenes where Sebastian was outlined in smoke, water and blood, Bacon wore a latex body suit, face mask, contact lenses and a dental plate all of one color; green was used for blood, blue for smoke, and black for water. Visual effects supervisor Craig Hayes then replaced Bacon with a digital clone to form an outline of his performance. To make the clone appear more like Bacon, information about &quot;every aspect&quot; of his body was recorded and the entirety of his body, including his genitals, was scanned into a computer. Their work earned Hayes and the effects team a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, which they lost to &quot;Gladiator&quot;.
Inspired after his daughter bought him books on the subject of écorchés at La Specola in Florence, Verhoeven enlisted special effects supervisor Scott Anderson to create a three-dimensional digital model of the inside of Bacon&#x27;s body, to create the &quot;transformation scene&quot; where Sebastian becomes invisible. New volume-rendering software was required just to replicate the inside of Bacon&#x27;s body. The scene depicts Sebastian disappearing in stages; first, his skin, followed by his muscles, organs (including his lungs and heart) and finally, his skeleton. Bacon detailed the complications of his role in a diary he kept while filming and believed the &quot;sense of isolation, anger and suffering&quot; that he felt while wearing the mask and body suit helped his performance.

The scene of an invisible Sebastian raping a woman in a neighboring apartment was shot in two versions, with the second showing her screaming as she is raped. The first was used when preview audiences reacted with disdain, deeming it &quot;painful&quot; and feeling it alienated them from Sebastian too early. Although excising certain shots from the version he called &quot;stronger[,] harsher and at the same time more relevant [for Sebastian Caine]&quot;, Verhoeven did not actually intend to show the rape, claiming &quot;a woman being raped by an invisible man would look silly and that&#x27;s the last thing we&#x27;d want to do. [...] It wouldn&#x27;t express in any way the severity of the violence happening at that moment.&quot; Regardless, it was Verhoeven&#x27;s first film he did not have to recut and resubmit to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) in order to achieve an R rating.

==Themes==
Professor of film and literature at California Polytechnic State University Douglas Keesey wrote in his illustrated book on the life and films of Verhoeven that the camera often adopts Sebastian&#x27;s point of view, &quot;tempting us to become voyeurs along with him, to get off on our ability to see without being seen&quot;. Elisabeth Shue categorized the film as a &quot;story of the dark, seductive nature of evil&quot; and also pointed out its voyeuristic qualities. Verhoeven commented: &quot;&quot;Hollow Man&quot; leads you by the hand and takes you with Sebastian into teasing behaviour, naughty behaviour and then really bad and ultimately evil behaviour. At what point do you abandon him? I&#x27;m thinking when he rapes the woman would probably be the moment that people decide, &#x27;This is not exactly my type of hero&#x27;, though I must say a lot of viewers follow him further than you would expect.&quot;

==Music==

The soundtrack for &quot;Hollow Man&quot; was composed by Jerry Goldsmith, his third collaboration with Verhoeven after &quot;Total Recall&quot; (1990) and &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; (1992). Varèse Sarabande released it on CD on July 25, 2000.

Filmtracks.com found there to be two distinct motifs: the &quot;transitional motif&quot; of &quot;bass thumping and [an] array of prickling electronic effects that slowly increase their pace and volume as the scenes [of invisibility] progress&quot;, heard in &quot;Isabelle Comes Back&quot; and &quot;This Is Science&quot;; and the &quot;rambling piano and bass-element ostinato heard for the violent chasing&quot; in both &quot;The Elevator&quot; and &quot;The Big Climb&quot;. The site pointed out &quot;the pulsating piano, woodwind, and electronic rhythm from [&quot;Basic Instinct&quot;] underneath a meandering, disembodied theme for high strings not much unlike [&quot;The Haunting&quot;]&quot;, and judged that the &quot;action bursts, especially with the drum pad and synthesizer combos&quot; were akin to Goldsmith&#x27;s use of those elements in &quot;Total Recall&quot;. Overall, the site felt the score was &quot;over the top&quot;, calling it &quot;pieced together from other Goldsmith scores&quot; and derivative while citing the first and second tracks as highlights.

==Release==
Despite a negative response from critics, &quot;Hollow Man&quot; debuted at #1 ahead of &quot;Nutty Professor II: The Klumps&quot; with $26.4 million in its opening weekend. During this time, the film achieved the second-highest August opening weekend, behind &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; (1999). It was the first film since &quot;&quot; to top the box office for multiple weeks. After fifteen weeks of release, &quot;Hollow Man&quot; had grossed in excess of $73.2 million in North America and just over $117 million elsewhere, making a total of $190.2 million worldwide, against its $95 million production budget. It was Verhoeven&#x27;s biggest hit since &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; (1992).

==Reception==

=== Critical response ===
 Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

While some critics criticized the plot and acting, with some claiming it contains hallmarks of slasher films and misogynistic undertones, most critics praised the visual effects employed in making Kevin Bacon appear to be invisible, which earned the film a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 2001 Academy Awards.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film two stars out of four, and complained that Verhoeven wasted potential by taking an invisible man and doing nothing more than having him go berserk. While ultimately feeling that the film is merely a slasher film with a science gimmick, Ebert praised the special effects, calling them &quot;intriguing&quot; and &quot;astonishing&quot;, but felt the film lacked the &quot;imagination and wit&quot; of Verhoeven&#x27;s best films.

The film received three nominations at the 2000 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards: Worst On-Screen Group (the scientists), Worst Screenplay for a Film That Grossed over $100 Million Using Hollywood Math and Most Unintentionally Funny Movie, but lost to &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot; and &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot;, respectively. The film was also nominated for both Best Science Fiction Film and Best Music at the Saturn Awards and won Best Special Effects.

A fake review attributed to David Manning was revealed in late 2001 as a hoax, created by Sony to fake publicity for the film.

=== Director&#x27;s response ===

Verhoeven was not happy with the movie. In 2013, he told &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;: He reiterates his statement in 2014: &quot;It is very boring. I felt that I failed to transform it. What I had made was an on-demand studio movie. I decided I did not want to do that again.&quot;

, &quot;Hollow Man&quot; is Verhoeven&#x27;s final film produced by a major American production company.

==Home media==
&quot;Hollow Man&quot; was released on DVD and VHS in North America by Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment on January 2, 2001. It was released with its widescreen theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1 and included various special features, including two audio commentaries—one with Verhoeven, writer Andrew W. Marlowe and Kevin Bacon, and another with composer Jerry Goldsmith and the isolated score of the film; the HBO making-of featurette &quot;&quot;Hollow Man&quot;: Anatomy of a Thriller&quot;; 15 mini-featurettes on the making of the film, several detailing storyboards of progress shots with commentary; three deleted scenes with commentary by Verhoeven; visual effects picture-in-picture comparisons of the raw footage with the final scene; cast and crew biographies; a teaser and a theatrical trailer. In the years that followed, both a deluxe Superbit edition was made, as well as a director&#x27;s cut of the film, which restored nearly seven minutes of footage—primarily extended cuts of existing scenes including Linda and Matthew in bed, the rape scene, Sebastian killing the dog and the aftermath of Sarah being suspicious of Sebastian.

The director&#x27;s cut version of the film was released on Blu-ray October 16, 2007 in 1080p. Although lacking any commentaries, it restores most other special features. A two-disc double pack including the stand-alone sequel &quot;Hollow Man 2&quot; was released on DVD in 2006 while Mill Creek Entertainment released the Blu-ray version on March 26, 2013. Mill Creek also released the director&#x27;s cut in their Dark Passengers 8 movie DVD collection on October 1, 2013, 24 Horror DVD collection on March 7, 2017, and The 6 Degrees Blu-ray collection on April 3, 2018. On July 8, 2019, both films were released on Blu-ray Collector&#x27;s Edition by 88 Films, including the theatrical cut of the first film.

<doc id="1332907" wikidata="Q4862849" url="?curid=1332907" title="Baron Sydney">
<text>Baron Sydney (an alternative spelling of the surname Sidney) was a title that was created three times in British history. The title was later elevated twice into a viscounty, and from there, once more into an earldom.

==First creation (1603)==
The first creation came in the Peerage of England in 1603 when Robert Sidney was made Baron Sydney, of Penshurst. In 1618, he was also granted the recreated title of Earl of Leicester.

=== List of Barons Sydney (first creation) ===
*Robert Sidney, 1st Earl of Leicester (1563–1626)
*Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester (1595–1677)
*Philip Sidney, 3rd Earl of Leicester (1619–1698)

In 1689, the barony was elevated to a viscountcy and granted to Henry Sydney, 1st Earl of Romney (younger brother of the 3rd Earl of Leicester).

==Second creation (1768)==
The second creation came in 1768 when Dudley Cosby (–1774), Minister Plenipotentiary to Denmark between 1763 and 1765, was made Baron Sydney, of Stradbally in the Queen&#x27;s County, in the Peerage of Ireland. He was the grandson and namesake of Dudley Cosby, who represented the Queen&#x27;s County in the Irish House of Commons, and the great-nephew of William Cosby. This creation, however, soon became extinct on Sydney&#x27;s death in 1774.

==Third creation (1783)==
The third creation came on 6 March 1783 when Thomas Townshend was created Baron Sydney, of Chiselhurst in the County of Kent, in the Peerage of Great Britain, and entered the House of Lords. He was soon elevated to Viscount Sydney of Chislehurst on 11 June 1789, and his grandson was eventually created Earl Sydney in 1874.

<text>David Bezmozgis (; born 1973) is a Latvian-born Canadian writer and filmmaker, currently the head of Humber College&#x27;s School for Writers.

==Life and career==

===Educational background===
Born in Riga, Latvia, he came to Canada with his family when he was six. He graduated with a B.A. in English literature from McGill University. Bezmozgis received an M.F.A. from the University of Southern California&#x27;s School of Cinema-Television.

===Short stories===
His short story &quot;Natasha&quot;, which originally appeared in &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, was included in the &quot;Best American Short Stories 2005&quot; collection. His short story &quot;The Train of Their Departure&quot;, which &quot;The New Yorker&quot; featured in its August 2010 issue, is actually an excerpt from his first novel &quot;The Free World&quot;, released on April 4, 2011, to wide acclaim. His short stories &quot;Tapka&quot; and &quot;The Russian Riviera&quot; were also published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. His short stories &quot;The Second Strongest Man&quot; and &quot;A New Gravestone for an Old Grave&quot; have been published in &quot;Zoetrope All-Story&quot;. &quot;A New Gravestone for an Old Grave&quot; was also included in the &quot;Best American Short Stories 2006&quot; collection.

His short story &quot;Minyan&quot; was published in the Winter 2002 issue of &quot;Prairie Fire&quot; and won the Silver Medal in the 2003 National Magazine Award for Fiction. His short story &quot;An Animal to the Memory&quot; was also published in Vol. 5, No. 2 (2002) of &quot;paperplates&quot;. His short story &quot;Rome, 1978&quot; was published in the April 2011 issue of &quot;The Walrus&quot;.

His short story collection, &quot;Immigrant City&quot;, was published in 2019.

===Books===
His first published book is &quot;Natasha and Other Stories&quot; (2004). Stories from that collection first appeared in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Zoetrope All-Story&quot;. &quot;Natasha and Other Stories&quot; was chosen for inclusion in &quot;Canada Reads 2007&quot;, where it was championed by Steven Page.

Bezmozgis&#x27; first novel &quot;The Free World&quot; (2011) was published in 2011. Set in Italy in 1978, Bezmozgis&#x27; novel chronicles the experience of Jewish refugees from the USSR. Critics in North America and in Europe have suggested that in this novel Berzmozgis presented through a fictional lens what another Jewish-Soviet immigrant Maxim D. Shrayer had described in his book &quot;Waiting for America&quot; (2007). It was subsequently nominated and shortlisted for the Giller Prize, the Governor General&#x27;s Literary Award for English-language fiction, the Amazon.ca First Novel Award, and for the Governor General&#x27;s Awards.

Bezmozgis&#x27; second novel, &quot;The Betrayers&quot; (2014) is about a famous Russian Jewish dissident who, after the fall of the Soviet Union, meets the man who denounced him. He also worked on the novel during a New York Public Library Cullman Center fellowship that he received. The novel was published in 2014 by Little, Brown and Company.

===Films===

====Short films and documentaries====
In 1999, while still a film student at the USC School of Cinematic Arts, Bezmozgis directed and wrote his first film, a short 25-minute documentary called &quot;L.A. Mohel&quot;, which won a major award for student filmmakers. In 2001, Bezmozgis wrote and directed a narrative short film entitled &quot;The Diamond Nose&quot; (2001), which starred Paul Lieber. In 2003, Bezmozgis directed a documentary entitled &quot;Genuine Article: The First Trial&quot; (2003), about the recruitment system for hiring law student interns used by Canadian law firms.

====Feature films====
In 2008 he completed his first narrative feature film, &quot;Victoria Day&quot; (2009), which he wrote and directed. The film stars Mark Rendall as a high-school hockey star dealing with emerging adulthood pressures and the expectations of his Russian-speaking parents. The film also had its world premiere at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival, where it was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize in the &quot;World Cinema - Dramatic&quot; category. It was also nominated for a Best Screenplay award at the 2010 Genie Awards. The film has also screened at the Shanghai International Film Festival, the Moscow International Film Festival, the Hamptons International Film Festival, the Athens International Film Festival, the Seoul International Youth Film Festival, the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival, and the Toronto Jewish Film Festival.

In 2015, Bezmozgis wrote and directed his second narrative feature film, &quot;Natasha&quot; (2015), based on his award-winning short story of the same name. The film stars Alex Ozerov and Sasha K. Gordon. &quot;Natasha&quot; was released theatrically in Canada by Mongrel Films in 2016. In 2017 the film received Canadian Screen Award nominations for Best Actress (Gordon) and Best Adapted Screenplay at the 5th Canadian Screen Awards.

Bezmozgis and Erik Rutherford cowrote the screenplay for the 2021 film &quot;Charlotte&quot;, for which they received a Canadian Screen Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay at the 10th Canadian Screen Awards in 2022, and a Writers Guild of Canada nomination for Best Feature at the 26th WGC Screenwriting Awards.

<text>A laser line level is a tool combining a spirit level and/or plumb bob with a laser to display an accurately horizontal or vertical illuminated line on a surface the laser line level is laid against. Laser line levels are used wherever accurate verticals and horizontals are required, typically in the construction and cabinetry industries. Some models are inexpensive enough for do-it-yourself applications.

The laser beam is fanned to produce a thin plane beam accurately horizontal or vertical, rather than a pinpoint beam. The axis of the laser is offset from the wall, so that a pinpoint beam would be parallel to and offset from the wall, and would not illuminate it; the fanned beam will intersect the wall, creating an accurately horizontal (or vertical) illuminated line along it.

The machine is set up using the built-in spirit level or plumb bob, and the line along the surface is then guaranteed to be accurately horizontal or vertical to within a certain tolerance, specified either in millimetres per metre or fractions of an inch over a specified distance in feet. A more advanced device may be accurate to within 0.3 mm/m; while lower-end models may be closer to 1.5 mm/m.

The illuminated line is necessarily absolutely straight, so that the line level can be used as a straightedge; for example, to see if a shelf is warped, even if not horizontal.

<doc id="1332945" wikidata="Q3284225" url="?curid=1332945" title="Red Alarm">
<text>is a 1995 shoot &#x27;em up video game developed by T&amp;E Soft and published by Nintendo. Released as a Virtual Boy launch game, it requires the player to pilot a space fighter and defeat the army of a malevolent artificial intelligence called KAOS. The game takes inspiration from the 1993 title &quot;Star Fox&quot;, and it is one of the few third-party titles for the Virtual Boy. Unlike most of the console&#x27;s games, &quot;Red Alarm&quot; features three-dimensional (3D) polygonal graphics. However, hardware constraints limited the visuals to bare wire-frame models, similar to those of the 1980 arcade game &quot;Battlezone&quot;. Reviewers characterized &quot;Red Alarm&quot;″s graphics as confusing, but certain publications praised it as one of the most enjoyable Virtual Boy titles.

==Gameplay and plot==

&quot;Red Alarm&quot; is a shoot &#x27;em up that takes place in a three-dimensional (3D) graphical environment. As a Virtual Boy game, it features a red-and-black color palette and stereoscopic 3D visuals, the depth of which may be adjusted by the player. The game is set during the 21st century, in the aftermath of a 70-year world war that led to the establishment of a utopian society without weapons. An artificial intelligence defense system called KAOS, which had been used to end the war, becomes sentient and builds an army to wipe out humanity.

Assuming control of a &quot;Tech-Wing&quot; space fighter, the player seeks to destroy KAOS&#x27;s forces and finally its mainframe. The game is broken up into six levels, each of which culminates in a boss fight. The player uses the Tech-Wing&#x27;s laser cannons to attack, and its guided missiles to destroy armored enemies. Shields on the craft offer limited protection from enemy fire; evasion is critical. The Tech-Wing may be maneuvered in any direction, and certain levels contain branching corridors and dead ends that force players to retrace their paths. Four camera angles—three third-person viewpoints and the first-person &quot;cockpit view&quot;—are available. When a level is completed, the player may watch a replay of their performance from multiple perspectives.
==Development and release==

&quot;Red Alarm&quot; was published by Nintendo and developed by T&amp;E Soft, one of the few third-party companies approached to develop for the Virtual Boy. According to the console&#x27;s creator, Gunpei Yokoi, Nintendo tried to &quot;maintain as much control as possible&quot; over Virtual Boy game development so that low-quality releases by outside companies could be avoided. Although T&amp;E Soft was known for golf video games, the design of &quot;Red Alarm&quot; was inspired by that of &quot;Star Fox&quot;, a rail shooter for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. This decision was considered by Patrick Kolan of IGN to be &quot;a departure for the team&quot;. Unlike many Virtual Boy games, &quot;Red Alarm&quot; features an engine that displays 3D graphics: the game world is rendered in wire-frame polygonal visuals similar to those of the 1980 arcade game &quot;Battlezone&quot;. Because of the console&#x27;s limited technology, solid 3D graphics were not viable.

&quot;Red Alarm&quot; debuted in North America at the 1995 Winter Consumer Electronics Show, and it was confirmed as a launch game for the Virtual Boy at that year&#x27;s Electronic Entertainment Expo. Later that year, &quot;Red Alarm&quot; and several other titles were released alongside the console, which debuted on July 21 in Japan and August 14 in the United States.
==Reception==

Writing for &quot;Weekly Famicom Tsūshin&quot;, Isabella Nagano called &quot;Red Alarm&quot;″s stereoscopic visuals &quot;amazing&quot;, and Sawada Noda recommended the game to all owners of the Virtual Boy. In a more negative review, the publication&#x27;s Mizu Pin characterized the wire-frame graphics as confusing and frustrating, a criticism echoed by the four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;. A &quot;GamePro&quot; writer under the pseudonym &quot;Slo Mo&quot; found the visuals confusing as well, but felt that players could adjust to them. Slo Mo and &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s Danyon Carpenter and Al Manuel praised the title&#x27;s control scheme, and the latter magazine&#x27;s Andrew Baran summarized &quot;Red Alarm&quot; as &quot;a nifty show-off game&quot;.

The reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; saw significant promise in &quot;Red Alarm&quot;, and believed that its elements should add up to &quot;a fantastic game&quot;; but the writer panned the final product as a wasted opportunity. Similarly, Danny Wallace of &quot;Total!&quot; wrote, &quot;On the one hand, it&#x27;s a pretty impressive 3D spacey shoot-em-up, with a real grip on the Virtual world and all those fancy techniques, and on the other it&#x27;s an often visually confusing, headache-inducing attempt at being something it&#x27;s quite obviously not.&quot; However, Dave Halverson of &quot;DieHard GameFan&quot; called &quot;Red Alarm&quot; &quot;a great shooter&quot; with excellent graphics. Co-reviewer Nicholas Barres hailed it as a &quot;masterpiece&quot;, and he considered it to be &quot;the one and only reason to buy a Virtual Boy&quot;.

A retrospective feature by Australian video game talk show Good Game highlighted &quot;Red Alarm&quot; as one of the Virtual Boy&#x27;s most visually impressive games due to its polygonal graphics. The outlet praised it as one of the most entertaining titles on the console. In 2008, Kolan called it &quot;a really competent shooter&quot; with strong visuals and gameplay. The following year, Damien McFerran of &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; summarized &quot;Red Alarm&quot; as &quot;pretty good fun to play&quot;, although inferior to &quot;Star Fox&quot;. &quot;Wired&quot;″s Chris Kohler later opined that the game &quot;kind of sucked&quot;.

<doc id="1332947" wikidata="Q1257411" url="?curid=1332947" title="European Nuclear Disarmament">
<text>European Nuclear Disarmament (END) was a Europe-wide movement for a &quot;nuclear-free Europe from Poland to Portugal” that put on annual European Nuclear Disarmament conventions from 1982 to 1991.

== Origins ==
The founding statement of END was the European Nuclear Disarmament Appeal issued in April 1980 and circulated by the Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation (http://www.russfound.org). It was provoked by NATO&#x27;s decision in December 1979 to respond to a Soviet upgrading of intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe with its own nuclear modernisation – cruise and Pershing II missiles to be deployed in Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Italy.

The appeal began:

We are entering the most dangerous decade in human history. A third world war is not merely possible but increasingly likely . . . In Europe, the main geographical stage for the East-West confrontation, new generations of ever more deadly nuclear weapons are appearing.

The document was notable for two things in particular. First, it resolutely refused to take sides in the Cold War:

We do not wish to apportion guilt between the military leaders of East and West. Guilt lies squarely upon both parties. Both parties have adopted menacing postures and committed aggressive actions in different parts of the world. . .

Secondly, it argued not just for disarmament (a nuclear-free Europe &quot;from Poland to Portugal”) but also for the destruction of the bloc system that had divided Europe since 1945 – a goal it envisaged being achieved by a novel strategy of “détente from below”:

The remedy lies in our own hands . . . We must commence to act as if a united, neutral and pacific Europe already exists. We must learn to be loyal, not to ‘East’ or ‘West’, but to each other, and we must disregard the prohibitions and limitations imposed by any national state . . . We must resist any attempt by the statesmen of East and west to manipulate this movement to their own advantage. . .

The main authors of the appeal were British – E. P. Thompson, Mary Kaldor, Dan Smith and Ken Coates – and it was launched at a press conference in the House of Commons. But their intention was to create a Europe-wide movement, and by summer 1980 it had been endorsed by an impressive list of supporters, mainly in western Europe but with a smattering from the Soviet bloc, among them former Hungarian prime minister András Hegedüs and Russian dissident Roy Medvedev. Several other East European intellectuals signed later.

== The END Conventions ==
With movements for nuclear disarmament emerging throughout western Europe and gaining support from social democratic and Euro-communist parties, the Russell Foundation, centred on Ken Coates, consulted about organising a massive conference to bring together everyone involved. The first European Nuclear Disarmament Convention subsequently took place in Brussels, Belgium, in 1982. According to historian Lawrence Wittner (1993) END was &quot;the very heart and soul of the massive antinuclear campaign&quot; (p. 234).

Most participants considered the convention a success, and Coates&#x27;s ad hoc conference organising committee became a semi-permanent END Liaison Committee, with members from the main west European peace movement organisations and most west European social-democratic and Euro-communist parties, which organised further END Conventions in Berlin (1983), Perugia, Italy (1984), Amsterdam (1985), Évry, France (1986), Coventry, UK (1987), Lund, Sweden (1988), Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain (1989), Helsinki, Finland/Tallinn, Estonia (1990) and finally Moscow (1991).

During these conventions, especially in Perugia and Amsterdam, there was an intensive cooperation with the Dutch Interchurch Peace Council (IKV) and their secretary-general Mient Jan Faber and Wim Bartels. Bartels was also the president of the International Peace Coordination Centre (IPCC), a cooperation of &#x27;like-minded&#x27; movements, which linked their commitment of the struggle against nuclear weapons and the support of independent, dissident peace-initiatives in Eastern-Europe. Despite this intensive cooperation there also existed some kind of rivalry between the END network and the IPCC. Since most peace movements were present in both, it seemed both networks were doing very similar work.

== END in the UK ==
Thompson, Kaldor and others in the END group in the UK disagreed with Coates&#x27;s interest in winning the support of political parties and trade union leaders, and in 1983 there was a parting of the ways: Coates and his Nottingham-based Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation concentrated on the Convention process, leaving Thompson and Kaldor as dominant figures in the UK END group. From then on, the UK END group was very much a separate entity from the conventions, although it took part in them and was represented on the Liaison Committee.

Nationally, END only became a membership organisation in 1985, when the nuclear disarmament movement was ebbing, when it recruited only 500 members. However, when the nuclear disarmament first grew in 1980 and 1981, in some localities local nuclear disarmament groups were founded as &#x27;END groups&#x27;: Hull END, for example, had hundreds of members throughout the first half of the 1980s. Nationally END played a major role in the British peace movement of the 1980s. END supporters, most notably Thompson and Kaldor, were the most prominent intellectuals of the movement, constantly in demand for public meetings and for opinion pieces in newspapers and magazines (&quot;The Guardian&quot;, the &quot;New Statesman&quot; and &quot;Tribune&quot; were always particularly keen). END also provided the main peace movement organisation, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), with much of its leadership: (Bruce Kent, Joan Ruddock, Dan Smith and Meg Beresford were all END supporters).

END&#x27;s insistence on criticising Soviet militarism made it highly controversial in CND, where communists and pro-Soviet Labour leftists were a vocal though small minority – but it meant that it was taken much more seriously by the Labour Party, which had adopted a non-nuclear defence policy in 1980. More than 60 Labour MPs signed the END Appeal in 1980, and END supporters, among them Kaldor and Smith, served on Labour advisory committees on defence. END also had significant support among Liberals opposed to nuclear arms (although not among their allies in the Social Democratic Party) as well as among members of the nascent Green party. Even a few daring dissident members of the Conservative and Communist parties lent their support.

END also organised regular speaking tours and conferences on various disarmament-related themes.

== END Publications ==
The END Bulletin and ENDPapers series were published by the Russell Foundation, beginning in 1980. Subsequently, British END published a series of pamphlets through Merlin Press and a bi-monthly magazine, &quot;European Nuclear Disarmament Journal&quot;, which was edited by Mary Kaldor. It was published from 1983 to 1988.

== Détente from below ==
What END was probably best known for, however, was its work with dissidents in the Soviet Union and its east-central European satellite states. Although the END Appeal had won some support from dissidents in the Soviet bloc at its launch, most were hesitant about the western peace movements, which they felt were parroting Soviet slogans and had no sympathy for people living under communist dictatorship. Václav Havel expressed this view forcefully in his essay “An Anatomy of a Reticence” (1985).

Nevertheless, thanks largely to the persistence of END and like-minded activists from other countries, who kept up a constant stream of correspondence with dissidents in the Soviet bloc and visited them whenever they could, by the mid-1980s a fruitful dialogue had been established. END had working groups for each Soviet bloc country. The Czechoslovakia group exchanged views with and visited Havel and his colleagues in Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia; the Hungary group did the same with György Konrád, Miklos Haraszti and a small group of young peace activists in Hungary; the Poland group the same with Adam Michnik, Jacek Kuron and many younger activists; the East Germany group the same with Bärbel Bohley and others who were later to be the core of Neues Forum.

== The end of END ==
Both the END Conventions and the UK END group went into decline in the late 1980s after the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty removed the weapons that had given the European peace movement its raison d’etre – though the conventions continued until 1991 (in Moscow) and END in the UK turned itself in 1989 into European Dialogue, a pressure group for encouraging the development of democracy and civil society, which is still going.

The Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation launched END Info (European Nuclear Disarmament Information) in March 2019 in response to the collapse of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty and attendant nuclear risks. The Russell Foundation worked with others across Europe to launch a &#x27;Nuke Free Europe&#x27; network that campaigns to rid the continent of all nuclear weapons.

<doc id="1332964" wikidata="Q1190526" url="?curid=1332964" title="Washington Diplomats">
<text>The Washington Diplomats were an American soccer club representing Washington, D.C. Throughout their playing existence, the club played their home games at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium and indoor home matches at the neighboring D.C. Armory. Founded as an expansion franchise in 1974, the Diplomats competed in the now-defunct North American Soccer League, then the top-tier soccer league of the American soccer pyramid.

Plagued with mediocrity in their first few seasons of existence, the Diplomats did not qualify for the playoffs until 1976, their third year in the league. The Diplomats were knocked out by the New York Cosmos in the first round. That season, the club played their home matches in Northern Virginia at W.T. Woodson High School, before going back to RFK Stadium in 1977. During the next three seasons, the Diplomats achieved more regular season success and reached the postseason every year from 1978 until 1980. Consequently, the club experienced a spike in average attendance, nearing 20,000 fans a game by the 1980 season, although a significant number of tickets were &quot;comps&quot; or &quot;papered&quot; by the team&#x27;s front office staff.

Following the end of the 1980 season, the original Diplomats club folded when then owner, the Madison Square Garden Corp., had accumulated losses of $6 million and team president Steve Danzansky could not gather enough money to keep the team alive. However, that same season the Detroit Express NASL franchise relocated to the Washington metropolitan area, renaming themselves the &quot;Diplomats&quot; due to perceived familiarity of the moniker to the area. However, a regression of attendance and a lack of field success sounded the death knell of the franchise, and the Diplomats folded following the 1981 season.

==History==

===Before the Dips===
The &quot;Washington Whips&quot; were a soccer team based in Washington, D.C. that played in the United Soccer Association. The league was made up of teams imported from foreign leagues. The Washington club was actually Aberdeen F.C. from Scotland.

Following the 1967 season, the USA merged with the National Professional Soccer League to form the North American Soccer League with the teams from the former USA having to create their rosters from scratch. Their home field was RFK Stadium. The team&#x27;s owner was Earl Foreman, later owner of the Virginia Squires of the American Basketball Association and commissioner of the original Major Indoor Soccer League. Edward T. Reynolds was the booth announcer for the club prior to the merger.

===Original NASL franchise===
The original Washington Diplomats first came into being when in 1974 when the North American Soccer League (NASL) granted a franchise to a Washington, D.C.–based business group. The team played all their home games at RFK Stadium in 1974, but in 1975 and 1976 they played most of their games at W.T. Woodson High School in Northern Virginia, including all of their 1976 games. They played indoor home matches at the neighboring D.C. Armory. After a lackluster beginning to the franchise, the Diplomats qualified for the playoffs and increased average game attendance in each of their last three years of existence. Additionally, in their final year, the Diplomats were able to sign the future European Player of the Century Johan Cruyff. After the 1980 season the Diplomats folded when then owner, the Madison Square Garden Corp., had accumulated losses of $6 million and team president Steve Danzansky could not gather enough money to keep the team alive.

The cheerleaders for the original Diplomats were known as the Honeydips until 1980 when their name was changed to the Sidekicks. The team also ran ad campaigns calling themselves &quot;the Dips.&quot;

===Express relocate to Washington===
After the original Diplomats folded following the 1980 season, the Detroit Express moved to Washington to become the new Diplomats. This team only lasted for one season.

===Rivalries===
The Diplomats&#x27; greatest rivalry was with the New York Cosmos. This was especially true when Johan Cruyff was playing in DC and the Cosmos had Pelé, Franz Beckenbauer and Giorgio Chinaglia. When the Cosmos came to RFK the stadium was close to capacity even though the Diplomats usually lost. However, they were always competitive games.

==Year-by-year==


==Players==

A number of high-profile soccer players lined out for the Washington Diplomats. Arguably the most famous were the Dutch pair of Johan Cruyff and Wim Jansen who had over 100 caps for the Netherlands between them and who represented the &quot;Dips&quot; between 1979 and 1981. Other international players to play for Washington included Tommy McConville who was capped 6 times by Ireland and Windsor del Llano who played 30 times for Bolivia. Future Real Madrid and Netherlands coach, Guus Hiddink also played for the Diplomats.

==Coaches==
* Dennis Viollet (1974–1977)

==Staff &amp; ownership==
* Stephen Danzansky 1975–1978
* Sonny Werblin 1979–1980

<doc id="1332971" wikidata="Q3242551" url="?curid=1332971" title="International direct dialing">
<text>International direct dialing (IDD) or international subscriber dialling (ISD) is placing an international telephone call, dialed directly by a telephone subscriber, rather than by a telephone operator. Subscriber dialing of international calls typically requires an [[List of international call prefixes|international call prefix]] (international dial-out code, international direct dial code, IDD code) to be dialed before the country code.

The term &quot;international subscriber dialling&quot; was used in the United Kingdom and Australia until the terminology was changed to &quot;international direct dialling&quot;. Since the late 20th century, most international calls are dialed directly.

Calls are initiated by dialing the international call prefix for the originating country, followed by the country calling code for the destination country, and finally the national telephone number of the destination. For example, a landline subscriber in the UK wishing to call Australia would first dial the following sequence: &quot;00&quot; (the call prefix used in the UK to access the international service), followed by &quot;61&quot; (the country calling code for Australia), followed by the national subscriber number (without the trunk prefix &quot;0&quot; used for dialing within Australia).

==International call prefix==

An &quot;international call prefix&quot;, &quot;international dial-out code&quot; or &quot;international direct dial code&quot; (IDD code) is a trunk prefix that indicates an international phone call. In the dialling sequence, the prefix precedes the country calling code (and, further, the carrier code, if any, and the destination telephone number).

The international call prefix is defined in the telephone numbering plan of every country or telephone administration.
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) recommendation E.164 specifies the sequence &quot;00&quot; as a standard for the international call prefix and this has been implemented by the majority of countries. Member countries of the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) use &quot;011&quot;. Certain post-Soviet states continue to use &quot;810&quot; which was the universal IDD code across the Soviet Union. Other prefixes (&quot;000&quot;, &quot;001&quot;, &quot;0011&quot;, &quot;119&quot;, etc.) are also in use in a small number of countries.

Some countries require that the prefix &quot;00&quot; is followed immediately by the so-called carrier selection code, i.e., a numeric code that routes the call via a specific provider for international connectivity. Some countries may require that any carrier selection codes precede the international call prefix.

Some countries also offer simplified dialling arrangements for calls to neighbouring countries, usually by removing the need of dialling an international call prefix and the country code.

To avoid confusion especially in international context, a plus sign (+) is often used as a graphic symbol of the international access code; it informs the caller to replace it with the prefix code appropriate for their country. Additionally, the GSM mobile telephony standard allows the use of the plus sign as the international call prefix, which makes it easier to store telephone numbers in a uniform format that works from anywhere in the world.

==Example==
The fictitious number &quot;(02) 3456 7890&quot; in Sydney, Australia, is published in the form &quot;+61 2 3456 7890&quot; for international use. In countries participating in the North American Numbering Plan, such as the United States, Canada, and some Caribbean nations, this number is dialed as &quot;011 61 2 3456 7890&quot;, with &quot;011&quot; being the international call prefix for the NANP and &quot;61&quot; being the country calling code of Australia. From most of the rest of the world, the international access code is &quot;00&quot;, so that the call is dialed as &quot;00 61 2 3456 7890&quot;, as recommended by the regulations of the ITU. (For Australians who wish to dial international numbers, the international access code when calling from Australia is &quot;0011&quot;.)

<text>The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) is an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The FNS is the federal agency responsible for administering the nation’s domestic nutrition assistance programs. The service helps to address the issue of hunger in the United States.

FNS administers the programs through its headquarters in Alexandria, VA; regional offices in San Francisco, Denver, Dallas, Chicago, Atlanta, Boston, and Robbinsville (NJ); and field offices throughout the US. While its staff number is among the USDA&#x27;s fewest, its budget is by far the largest.

The Food and Nutrition Service is funded under the umbrella of United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) through the annual Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. In 2019, $27 billion was allocated for discretionary funding for USDA, which is spread out over many services including WIC, food safety, and other services. Of the expected people to be served in 2019, the estimate for SNAP recipients is 40.8 million, 30 million to have received school lunches, 15 million to have received school breakfast, 6.6 million participating in WIC, and 690,000 elderly people receiving Commodity Supplemental Food Program.

==History==
Several FNS programs pre-date the creation of the agency and trace their roots back to Depression-era programs.
FNS was established on August 8, 1969 as an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The first administrator was Edward J. Hekman, former president of the Keebler Company, who served until the end of the Ford administration. 

In 2018, 11.1% of the US population were deemed as being &#x27;food insecure&#x27;. This is a 0.07% decrease from 2017. Food insecurity is deemed as a household not having enough resources or insufficient funds to provide for everyone in their family. This equates to 37.2 million people affected by food insecurity. Non-white ethnicity groups are most impacted, while groups such as poverty stricken (with an income-to-poverty ratio under 1.00) and single women with children lead with higher percentages of households affected. States with an affected food security average of 15% or more that were polled within 2016-2018 are New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Alabama, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia, and North Carolina.

<doc id="1332984" wikidata="Q670603" url="?curid=1332984" title="Chicago Sting">
<text>The Chicago Sting (1974–1988) was an American professional soccer team representing Chicago. The Sting played in the North American Soccer League from 1975 to 1984 and in the Major Indoor Soccer League in the 1982–83 season and again from 1984 to 1988. They were North American Soccer League champions in 1981 and 1984, one of only two NASL teams (the New York Cosmos) to win the championship twice.

The Sting were founded in 1974 by Lee Stern of Chicago and competed in the NASL for the first time in the 1975 season. A few years after founding the Sting, Stern brought Willy Roy on as head coach. Roy coached the Sting for the remainder of their outdoor existence.

The team was named in reference to the popular 1973 film, &quot;The Sting&quot;, whose action was set in Chicago of the 1930s.

The club played at various venues. The outdoor team spread their home games at Soldier Field, Wrigley Field, and Comiskey Park. In 1976 the indoor squad called the International Amphitheatre home, before subsequently using Chicago Stadium and the Rosemont Horizon (now the Allstate Arena).

== Stern, Foulkes, Hill and May ==

1974–75: The Chicago Sting were the dream child of Lee Stern, a leading Chicago commodities broker, who in 1974 took an expensive gamble that his hometown would accept soccer as a major league sport. Stern turned to England for a coach in the shape of &#x27;Busby Babe&#x27; Bill Foulkes, the former Manchester United defender.

Foulkes built a team of predominantly British players (there were 10 in the 1975 squad and 11 in 1976 and 1977) including Gordon Hill and Eddie May. Hill would later win 6 England caps and play over a hundred games for Manchester United including the 1976 FA Cup Final. In Chicago he hit six goals in the Sting&#x27;s inaugural season and firmly established himself as a fan&#x27;s favorite as did May who despite playing all of his career in the UK as a central defender, was used by Foulkes as a target man scoring 7 times in 18 games which included the winner on his debut in Sting&#x27;s 1–0 victory over Los Angeles Aztecs, just 24 hours after arriving into Chicago from Welsh club Wrexham.

In the summer of 1975 a sparse crowd of 4,500 watched the Sting&#x27;s very first home game and as it began so it continued with an average that year of around the 4,000 mark – although close to 14,000 did turn out to see the Sting take on the 1974 Polish World Cup team in a friendly.

The Sting missed out on the playoffs by a single point losing the final game of the season in a penalty shoot-out (Hill missing his attempt).

== Cosmos doubled, Willie Morgan, Foulkes quits ==

1976: The Sting&#x27;s second season saw the arrival of more players from the British Isles and the return to Chicago of Polish striker Janusz Kowalik. Kowalik had hit the heights with the Chicago Mustangs eight years earlier scoring 30 goals in 28 appearances in the Mustangs one and only season in the NASL.

Although the British incomers were less well known – John James (from Tranmere Rovers), John Lowey (from Manchester United&#x27;s youth team), Lammie Robertson (Exeter City) and Alan Waldron (Bolton Wanderers &amp; Blackpool) – the side were good enough to win the club its first honor in the form of the Northern Division title.

Although the team were unable to make it past the first round of the playoffs, bowing out to the Toronto Blizzard, they had doubled the star studded New York Cosmos in regular season play, winning two-nil in New York, and in front of 28,000 home fans had beaten Pelé, Giorgio Chinaglia and company in a 4–1 romp.

1977: Head coach Bill Foulkes headed for Britain yet again before the 1977 season to sign a player who would prove to be one of the most successful and popular players in the NASL&#x27;s history – Willie Morgan, the Scottish international midfielder. Morgan, who arrived on loan from Bolton Wanderers had played over 500 games in the Football League for Bolton Wanderers, Burnley and Manchester United.

Also arriving from the UK was Ronnie Moore a prolific striker from Tranmere Rovers, but despite these additions the Sting had a very poor year and Foulkes resigned halfway through the season leaving Willy Roy, his assistant, as interim coach.

Roy, a German by birth who had arrived with his family in Chicago at the age of six, was a veteran of the early years of the NASL and its forerunner the NPSL. The Sting finished the season with a 10 win 16 loss record. Unsurprisingly attendances were not improving, and a dramatic drop seemed likely when the Sting started the 1978 season by losing its first ten games.

== Musgrove disaster, Karl-Heinz Granitza signs ==

1978: At the beginning of the 1978 NASL season the Sting set a much unwanted record when the team lost its first ten matches. This was not the start that owner Lee Stern had anticipated when he brought in Clive Toye as new club president who in turn had hired Malcolm Musgrove as the team&#x27;s new head coach. Toye had been one of the men behind the success of the NASL&#x27;s leading light the New York Cosmos, while Musgrove, a former left-winger with West Ham United was a coach with a growing reputation.

Musgrove had made expensive forays into the transfer market bringing in four new players in the shape of Karl-Heinz Granitza (from Hertha Berlin), Arno Steffenhagen (from FC St. Pauli), Horst Blankenburg (who had played in the great Ajax side of the early 1970s alongside Johan Cruyff, and company) and Jørgen Kristensen (another former Hertha Berlin man).

Swift action was needed and out went Musgrove as Willy Roy was recalled as coach. The effect was immediate – ten wins were recorded in the last fourteen regular season games – and the Sting moved up from last place to second place in the Central Division to win a playoff berth.

Although eliminated from the playoffs by the Tampa Bay Rowdies the Sting (or Der Sting as they would later become known with the shift from British staff to German) won plaudits around the league for their attacking style of play scoring thirty-eight goals in those final fourteen games.

== Willy Roy appointed coach, On the brink ==

1979: At the end of the 1978 NASL season Willy Roy was appointed head coach. The Sting were on their way to becoming one of the best sides in the league and to ensure continued success Roy brought in four new players who would all play their part in the franchises best season yet: Wim van Hanegem arrived from Dutch side AZ, Luigi Martini from SS Lazio, Thomas Sjoberg from Malmö FF along with former Feyenoord man Peter Ressel.

All number of club records were broken as the Sting scored 70 goals – Karl-Heinz Granitza weighing in with 20 – and the average home attendance increased to a respectable 8,000, 21,000 plus turning out at Wrigley Field to see the New York Cosmos defeated 3–1. The Fort Lauderdale Strikers were beaten in the first round of the playoffs (the Sting winning the best of three series by two wins to none) but the San Diego Sockers proved to be too strong for Chicago and booked a place in the American Conference Finals with a 2–0 win in California followed by a 1–0 victory at Wrigley Field.

1980: Phil Parkes, the former Wolverhampton Wanderers &#x27;keeper, became the Sting&#x27;s number 1, moving to Chicago from the Vancouver Whitecaps where he had played for the past three seasons and established himself as the NASL&#x27;s top glovesman. Also joining the Sting line-up were Ingo Peter (once of Borussia Dortmund) and Frantz Mathieu, a Haitian defender, who joined from FC St. Pauli.

The Sting took the Central Division title with a 21–11 record, 16 of those wins coming in their first 19 games. Karl-Heinz Granitza was again leading marksman with 19 goals and 26 assists, while Arno Steffenhagen took second place with 15 strikes and 15 assists from midfield.

The 1980 campaign, and the 1980–81 Indoor Season that followed (the Sting&#x27;s first foray into the world of the indoor game), were major turning points as far as the Chicago public were concerned and the club started to attract large crowds on a regular basis. 26,468 saw the Sting take on the Tampa Bay Rowdies at Wrigley Field, 18,112 watched the Washington Diplomats home fixture, and two other matches drew crowds in excess of 16,000, while indoors 16,257 packed the Chicago Stadium for one game as the Sting&#x27;s reached – but lost – the NASL Championship finals.

== 1981 Championship Season ==

1981: The addition of Pato Margetic to the Sting front line – Margetic had joined from the Detroit Express – showed coach Will Roy&#x27;s attacking intent for the coming campaign, indeed the club would finish as the NASL leading scorers with 81 goals.

The turning point in the season came at the end of the June when a new club record crowd of 30,501 turned out at Wrigley Field to see the Sting beat the New York Cosmos 6–5 after a shootout. This signalled the start of an eight-game winning streak.

The Central Division title was confirmed as the Sting completed the regular season with three straight home wins. The Dallas Tornado were beaten 3–1, the Ft. Lauderdale Strikers by a 7–2 margin and the Tulsa Roughnecks 5–4 to end the campaign with a 23 wins and 9 defeats.

In the first round of the playoffs the Seattle Sounders were beaten by two games to one and the Sting advanced to round two and a date with the Montreal Manic. A record soccer crowd of 58,542 in Montreal&#x27;s Olympic Stadium saw the Manic take the first game 3–2, but the Sting bounced back to win games two and three both by a 4–2 margin, game three being won despite being 2–1 down with nine minutes left to play.

The San Diego Sockers now stood between the Sting and a first Soccer Bowl appearance. Two late goals by the Californian side gave them first blood and a 2–1 win, but the Sting won game two by the same scoreline in front of 21,760 at Comiskey Park. Five days later 39,623 Chicagoans saw the Sting take the series with a 1–0 overtime victory at the same venue. The Sting were heading for a Soccer Bowl showdown with the New York Cosmos.

== Soccer Bowl &#x27;81 ==

Eighteen years without a major sporting honor ended for the city of Chicago as the Sting won the NASL Championship to give the Windy City its first professional sports title since the Chicago Bears had won the NFL Championship Game in 1963. On that occasion the Bears had beaten the New York Giants and the Sting&#x27;s triumph would be earned against another New York team, the Cosmos.

A crowd of 36,971 – including some 6,000 from Chicago – were on hand at Toronto&#x27;s Exhibition Stadium and they could have been forgiven for expecting a high scoring game as the two previous meetings between the Sting and the Cosmos that year had produced fifteen goals. So it was very much against the odds – after the normal 90 minutes and a further 15 minutes of sudden death overtime – that this game would end goalless.

Each side had plenty of scoring opportunities though, the closest of which came from the Sting&#x27;s Pato Margetic whose strike was saved by a fully extended Hubert Birkenmeier in the Cosmos goal, teammate Ingo Peter&#x27;s saw his header strike the crossbar and then the upright, and an overhead kick by Giorgio Chinaglia went just wide of the Sting goal.

Despite that effort, Chinaglia, the NASL&#x27;s all-time leading scorer, was marshaled well by the defensive partnership of Frantz Mathieu and Paul Hahn, supply from the flanks by the Cosmos wingers was kept to a minimum by Dave Huson and Derek Spalding, the Sting&#x27;s two fullbacks, while in goal Dieter Ferner put in another exemplary shift. At the other end the Cosmos backline, aided by Birkenmeier, was just as effective.

Twice in regular season play the Sting had needed extra time to beat the Cosmos and the same would be the case in Toronto. New York took the lead after three rounds through Vladislav Bogicevic, Karl-Heinz Granitza then leveled things up before Ferner made a great save to keep out Ivan Buljan&#x27;s chipped shot. Rudy Glenn then stepped up to beat Birkenmeier to become the first native North American to score a winning goal in a Soccer Bowl.

Joint captains Ingo Peter and Spalding proudly accepted the Championship Trophy from NASL Commissioner Phil Woosnam to confirm the Sting as the North American Soccer League champions for 1981.

== Sting set US indoor attendance record ==

1981–82 (Indoor): A dramatic and high scoring season saw the club top the Central Division pipping the Tampa Bay Rowdies to the title in the final game of the regular season. A then record attendance for an indoor soccer game in North America of 19,398 saw the Sting come from 8–4 down to beat the Rowdies 10–9 in sudden death overtime.

Chicago had topped the division for most of the season and remained undefeated in regular season play at the Chicago Stadium. Highlights en route to the title included the 10–3 defeat of the Montreal Manic, a 10–4 victory over the Tulsa Roughnecks and a 6–3 win against the New York Cosmos at home while on the road impressive 6–3 and 6–5 wins were recorded against, respectively, the Toronto Blizzard and Jacksonville Teamen.

Even more impressive were the growing attendances at the Chicago Stadium where the Sting were outdrawing the Chicago Bulls (NBA) and fast catching up with the crowds pulled in by the Chicago Blackhawks (NHL). Besides the record crowd of 19,398 for the Tampa Bay Rowdies game, 18,374 saw the New York Cosmos game, 13,000 turned out for the regular season game against the Tulsa Roughnecks while 16,000 attended the playoff game against the Oklahoma side.

It was against the Roughnecks that the Sting made an unexpected and early exit from the playoffs having been widely tipped to add the indoor crown to the Soccer Bowl trophy won the previous summer. The Sting lost the best of three game opener in Tulsa 5–4 but in a dramatic return at the Chicago Stadium the Sting turned a 6–1 deficit into a 7–6 victory, Karl-Heinz Granitza scoring the winner five minutes into sudden death overtime.

With the series tied at one game each a 15-minute mini-game followed. The Roughnecks took a three-goal lead, the Sting pulled a goal back but there was to be no dramatic comeback in this game as the Roughnecks advanced into round two of the playoffs with a 3–1 win to take the series by two games to one.

Karl-Heinz Granitza finished the season as the league&#x27;s second highest scorer (behind Julie Veee of the San Diego Sockers) with 35 goals and 36 assists. In the home game against the New York Cosmos on January 30 he scored a hat-trick, as the Sting won 5–3, extending his indoor scoring streak to 35 consecutive games. Three games earlier he had beaten the league&#x27;s existing record of 32 in the 6–5 overtime win against the Jacksonville Teamen.

== Defending champions fail to make playoffs ==

1982 (Outdoor): The possibility that the Sting would become the first defending champions to fail to make the playoffs since the Soccer Bowl&#x27;s inauguration in 1975 was certainly far from anyone&#x27;s minds when Chicago resumed NASL outdoor action in April. However, four straight losses in the opening month set the trend for what would become a topsy-turvy campaign.

The players had had little time to rest after a tough indoor season and the team and its management also had to adjust to a number of rule changes. First, the league had agreed to FIFA&#x27;s demands that offside rule should apply from the half-way line and not the NASL&#x27;s 35-yard line as had been the case since the league&#x27;s inception. Second, the league insisted that clubs have at least four North Americans on the field at any one time. The Sting had sufficient players to do so but was left with a surfeit of foreign stars and David Huson and John Tyma – who had both played their part in the 1981 success – were traded to other teams.

The first win of the season came against the Tulsa Roughnecks at Wrigley Field on May 1 but that was just a brief respite as the Sting slumped to a further four defeats to end the month with a 1–7 record. Then remarkably Frantz Mathieu – a firm fan favourite – was traded to the Montreal Manic, with Gordon Hill coming the other way, making his return to Chicago after a seven-year absence.

A break from league action saw the Sting take part in the Trans-Atlantic Challenge Cup. After holding Nacional of Uruguay to a 0–0 tie and defeating Italian Seria A side Napoli 3–1 they lifted the trophy with a 4–3 victory against the New York Cosmos in front of 36,904 at Giants Stadium, New Jersey. But after winning the prestigious trophy it was back to NASL action and another defeat in a 3–0 reverse at the Seattle Sounders.

Defensive mistakes, poor officiating and continuing injury problems dogged the remainder of the season although the Chicagoans did manage a run of three straight wins to briefly keep alive hopes of making the playoffs. The Edmonton Drillers were beaten 3–2 at the start of July, followed by the Fort Launderdale Strikers 3–0 and a 2–1 shootout victory against the Tampa Bay Rowdies.

Those slim hopes finally came to end with a 3–1 loss at the New York Cosmos, followed, ironically, by two excellent performances that saw the Sting defeat the Toronto Blizzard 3–1 and the Montreal Manic 2–1, both at Comiskey Park, to close out the season, leaving the Sting with the worst win–loss record (13–19) in its history.

== Sting debut in MISL ==

1982–83 (Indoor): In the fall of 1982 agreement was reached between the NASL and the MISL to allow three franchises – the San Diego Sockers, the San Jose Earthquakes and the Chicago Sting – to join the MISL for the upcoming 1982–83 indoor season. With a regular season stretching from November to mid-April and comprising 48 games per team (compared to just 18 games in the NASL Indoor League the previous season) the Chicagoans had effectively signed up to play two full seasons a year, of two very different types of soccer.

Even so, the Sting, who were assigned to the Eastern Division, acquitted themselves well taking place in a three-way race for the division title, with the veteran Cleveland Force and the Baltimore Blast, eventually finishing third, two games behind the Blast in first place, and one behind the Force in second place, with a 28–20 record.

In the first round of the playoffs experience was a telling factor at Cleveland eased into the next round winning the best-of-three series 5–9, 5–4 and 7–5.

== Financial problems mount for NASL ==

1983 (Outdoor): An ongoing salary war between the NASL and the Major Indoor Soccer League was continuing to cause financial problems across the two leagues, and losses continued to pile up as the 1983 outdoor season got underway with just twelve teams (three down on 1982).

An improved Sting side completed the season with a 15 win 15 loss record to take second place in the Eastern Conference – behind the New York Cosmos – and a place in the playoffs for the first time in two seasons. It would be a short lived playoff campaign, however, as the Sting went out at the first round stage losing the best-of-three series with the Golden Bay Earthquakes (formerly the San Jose Earthquakes) 6–1, 0–1 and 5–2.

Karl-Heinz Granitza was once again top scorer for the Sting – and the league&#x27;s second highest scorer behind Roberto Cabanas of the New York Cosmos – with 15 goals and 18 assists (48 points), Ricardo Alonso was second with 16 goals and 15 assists (47 points) and Pato Margetic third with 12 goals and 8 assists (32 points).

Home attendances averaged 10,937, an improvement of 1,600 fans per game over the previous season, although still below the NASL average of just over 13,000 per fixture.

== 1984 NASL championship and departure ==

Earlier in the year Sting ownership had requested a one-year leave of absence from the NASL, and were denied. With only a few games remaining in the season and still trying to qualify for the playoffs, Lee Stern announced that 1984 would be the Chicago Sting&#x27;s NASL swan song. They, along with three other teams had been granted full admittance to the MISL. Not only were they able to make the playoffs, but they defeated Vancouver in a three-game semifinal, to face Toronto for the title.

The Blizzard, who were now being run by former Sting President Clive Toye, were one of the franchises fighting to keep the NASL afloat. Though it was a battle, Chicago took game one of the series at Comiskey Park, 2–1 on a late goal by Manny Rojas. This gave the Roy&#x27;s Sting the unique opportunity to earn a second league title in the same city as their first. This time they would be playing at the more intimate Varsity Stadium instead of Exhibition Stadium, the site of the Soccer Bowl &#x27;81 triumph. After 68 minutes Chicago had built a 2–0 lead on goals by Mark Simanton and Pato Margetic. Toronto stormed back by scoring two goals in a 1:30 span to level the match in the 73rd minute. With 8:27 remaining in regulation Margetic notched his 6th goal of the playoffs off a pass from Rojas. Chicago goalkeeper Victor Nogueira was impressive in both matches, especially in the final minutes and the Sting held on to win their second title in four years. Margetic, with three of Chicago&#x27;s five goals, was named the MVP of the finals.

In the immediate aftermath of the victory, Blizzard chairman Toye&#x27;s actions were those of a sore loser. He refused to honor the long-standing tradition of entering the winning locker room to congratulate the victors. Toye followed that up by taking verbal jabs at Roy and Granitza in the press, referring to them as &quot;cheats&quot; and the Sting as &quot;unworthy champions&quot; among other things. He also said that Toronto did not deserve to lose. Not surprisingly Granitza responded in-kind. In the end the lack of sportsmanship mattered little, as Chicago walked off into the sunset with the trophy and the NASL ceased operations the following year with Toye as its interim president.

== Off-field antics overshadow Sting&#x27;s worst ever indoor season ==

1985–86 (Indoor): The season kicked off with the Chicago Sting able to boast that they were the oldest existing professional soccer franchise in the United States. When it concluded it did so with a 23–29 win–loss record for the Sting, the worst in the club&#x27;s indoor history.

After six indoor seasons at the Chicago Stadium the club had moved to the Rosemont Horizon, a stadium in the northern Chicago suburbs, in a bid to attract more fans. It however had the opposite effect with average attendance falling by almost 1,500 to an all-time low 5,879.

Personnel issues also played their part in a poor season. Head Coach Willy Roy, who had led the Sting to two NASL titles, was replaced by his assistant Eric Geyer in late December, and Karl-Heinz Granitza, the club&#x27;s all-time leading goalscorer, who at the beginning of the season had seen his annual salary cut by $100,000 to $65,000, was suspended indefinitely on March 21 after an argument with owner Lee Stern.

While results picked up after Geyer&#x27;s appointment – despite the decision on January 12 to trade leading scorer for the season so far, Drago Dumbovic, to the Baltimore Blast – it was not enough to overcome a very poor start and the Sting failed to make the playoffs for the second season running.

Meanwhile, owner Lee Stern entered discussions with representatives of Halo Advertising Specialties that would see them initially become a minor shareholder but have a controlling interest in the franchise within two years, although this ultimately came to nothing.

== The Nickel Man (Joseph Vitell) ==
In 1988, Lee Stern stated after a leading 7-2 and finishing out on the bottom of the score card with a 8–7 loss against Kansas City that he would sell the team for a nickel. Joseph Vitell at the time 48 years old and an attorney took him up on the offer. Vitell gave Stern a nickel during the half time of the next game and sent a 5-cent check to the Stings office. Joseph Vitell has the record for cheapest professional sports team purchase.

== Sting withdraw from MISL ==

The Sting were experiencing financial challenges through the 1987–88 MISL season. In the spring of 1988, the owners explored the possibility of moving to Denver.

A few weeks after the end of the 1987–88 season, in July 1988, owner Lee Stern announced that the Sting had withdrawn from the MISL, citing falling attendances, failure to find new investors and concerns that the league was on the verge of collapse. Occurring the same week that the USA were awarded the 1994 World Cup Finals, Stern stated &quot;Soccer will be back. With the World Cup coming to this country in 1994, interest will be high. The Sting will be involved somehow, some way&quot;.

== Potential Relaunch Of The Chicago Sting ==

Chicago Sting trademarks have been filed by soccer agent Scott Michaels for utilization in his newly established professional league, the National Soccer League. Concurrently, a fundraising endeavor is set to commence on Wefunder, a crowdfunding platform.

<text>The Monkey World Ape Rescue Centre is a ape and monkey sanctuary, rescue centre and primatarium near Wool, Dorset, England.

==History==

Set up in 1987 by Jim Cronin with assistance from both Jeremy Keeling and later operated by both Cronin and his wife Alison along with a team of care staff led by Keeling, Monkey World was originally intended to provide a home for abused chimpanzees used as props by Spanish beach photographers, but is now home to many different species of primates. 

Monkey World&#x27;s first resident was a female Bornean orangutan named Amy, who had been hand-reared by Keeling. Amy was later paired with a male orangutan named Banghi, who was given to Monkey World on loan from Chester Zoo. In 1997, Amy and Banghi had a son together named Gordon before Banghi died in 1998. On 13 July 1987, Monkey World&#x27;s first chimpanzees Paddy (d. 2016), Busta, Jimmy (d. 2021), Micky, Sammy (d.2022), Taffy (d. 1989), Beth, Cindy and Zoe (d.2021) arrived at the park. In April 1998, Monkey World rescued a young female chimpanzee named Trudy, who had been filmed being beaten by Mary Chipperfield. Chipperfield was later charged with 12 counts of animal cruelty.

On Saturday 17 March 2007 Jim Cronin died in a New York hospital aged 55 years from liver cancer. His widow Alison Cronin and the staff at Monkey World have continued to run the centre.

Monkey World works with foreign governments to stop the illegal smuggling of wild primates. In January 2008 the group performed what &quot;The Guardian&quot; called &quot;the world&#x27;s biggest rescue mission of its kind,&quot; when it saved 88 capuchin monkeys from a laboratory in Santiago, Chile, where some of the animals had been kept in solitary cages for up to twenty years. The operation was carried out at the request of the laboratory, and with help from the Chilean Air Force, who flew the animals to Bournemouth airport with special permission from the British government.

In August 2010 Monkey World rescued a Bornean orangutan called Oshine from Johannesburg, South Africa.
On 7 December 2010 Monkey World rescued an orphan baby Sumatran orangutan called Silvestre from a zoo in Spain. In January 2011, Monkey World rescued a chimpanzee named Kiki from Lebanon.

In September 2018, Monkey World rescued a female chimpanzee named Toprish (d. 2023), who had been stolen from the wild for the illegal pet trade before being left at a zoo in Turkey. In October that same year, Monkey World rescued another female chimpanzee named Naree, whom Alison Cronin first encountered with Jim in 2003.

In February 2020, Monkey World rescued a 37-year-old chimpanzee named Kalu, who had been kept as a pet on a stud farm in South Africa until her owner&#x27;s death.

During Storm Eunice in February 2022, a very rare woolly monkey was unexpectedly born, only to be followed by another in March. The park also suffered during the storm, with lots of trees being felled and fences being damaged.

==Overview==
Monkey World features the largest group of chimpanzees outside of Africa which are housed in four different social groups. Many of its animals are rescued from the black market pet trade, laboratories and from abuse as tourist photographer props. The park also features three groups of orangutans, including two different species (Bornean and Sumatran). It is host to Europe&#x27;s only orangutan crèche which raises all orphaned or abandoned orangutans in Europe. Whilst open to housing gorillas, the park has not yet come across any which require rescue or rehabilitation at the park. Additionally, the park houses five different species of gibbon (agile gibbon, lar gibbon, Müller&#x27;s gibbon, siamang and golden-cheeked gibbon) and 14 species of monkey/prosimian (capuchins, common marmosets, Geoffrey&#x27;s marmosets, cotton-top tamarins, patas monkeys, red-bellied guenons, ring-tailed lemurs, white-faced saki, slow loris, spider monkeys, squirrel monkeys, stump-tailed macaques and woolly monkeys).

==Dao Tien Rescue Centre==

In 2008, Monkey World along with the Pingtung Rescue Centre, Cat Tien National Park and the Forestry Protection Department worked together to create the Dao Tien Rescue centre in South Vietnam to save gibbons and other primates from the pet trade, smuggling, theme parks and restaurants. Since opening, Dao Tien has confiscated and/or rescued over 50 endangered primates including golden-cheeked gibbons, pygmy slow loris, black-shanked douc, grey-shanked douc, southern white-cheeked gibbon, northern buffed-cheeked gibbon, white-faced saki and silvered langur. 27 of these primates have been rehabilitated and released into native habitats. After release they are tracked using radio collars. Dao Tien is run by the charity Endangered Asian Species Trust (EAST), who rescue and rehabilitate endangered Vietnamese primates. The work of Dr. Marina Kenyon and her team has been documented in the &quot;Monkey Life&quot; TV series since Series 2.

==Television appearances==

The TV documentary &quot;Monkey Business&quot; ran for 9 seasons between 1998 and 2006. Its successor &quot;Monkey Life&quot;, began in 2008 and 16 seasons have been shown as of 2024, with the 17th season in production.

<doc id="1333012" wikidata="Q1347170" url="?curid=1333012" title="Epimanikia">
<text>Epimanikia (singular &quot;epimanikion&quot;) are liturgical vestments of the Eastern Orthodox Church and Eastern Catholic Churches. They are cuffs (Russian: &quot;нарука́вницы, по́ручи, нарука́вники - narukávnitsy, póruchi, narukávniki&quot;) made of thickened fabric, usually brocade, that lace onto the wrists of a bishop, priest, or deacon. There is usually a cross embroidered or appliquéd to the center.

Bishops and priests attach the epimanikia to the sleeves of the sticharion. Since the deacon wears a more elaborate sticharion as an outer garment, its large winged sleeves are not bound by epimanikia; rather he wears the epimanikia underneath, tied to his &quot;endorrason&quot; (inner cassock) (Russian: подрясник, &quot;podryasnik&quot;)

Among most ethnic groups, the epimanikia will be worn by bishops and priests only when they vest fully for the Divine Liturgy. However, among stricter Russian Orthodox clergy a bishop or priest will wear the epimanikia any time he wears the epitrachelion. Deacons always wear the epimanikia whenever they vest.

In the Armenian Orthodox usage, the epimanikia is called &quot;baspan&quot;. It is like the garments worn in Byzantine tradition.

The Syriac &quot;zende&quot; are similar to the epimanikia, but extend to cover the entire forearm.

They are roughly analogous to the maniple used in the Western Christianity.

== Vesting prayer ==

* right hand:

Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power:

thy right hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.

And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee. (Exodus 15: 6-7)

* left hand:

Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: O give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments. (Psalm 119: 73)

<text>Richard Malden Heckstall-Smith (26 September 1934 – 17 December 2004) was an English jazz and blues saxophonist. He played with some of the most influential English blues rock and jazz fusion bands of the 1960s and 1970s. He is known for primarily playing tenor, soprano, and baritone saxophones, as well as piano, clarinet and alto saxophone.

==Early years==
Heckstall-Smith was born in the Royal Free Hospital, in Ludlow, Shropshire, England, and was raised in Knighton, Radnorshire, learning to play piano, clarinet and alto saxophone in childhood. He attended a York boarding school but refused a second term there, instead enrolling in Gordonstoun, where his father had accepted a job as headmaster of the local grammar school.

Heckstall-Smith completed his education at Dartington Hall School, before reading agriculture – and co-leading the university jazz band – at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge (1953–1956). Aged 15, he had taken up the soprano sax while at Dartington, captivated by the sound of Sidney Bechet. Then Lester Young and tenor saxophonist bebop jazzman Wardell Gray proved to be major influences for him.

==Musical career==
Heckstall-Smith was an active member of the London jazz scene from the late 1950s (including a six-month stint from December 1957 with the band led by clarinettist Sandy Brown). He joined Blues Incorporated, Alexis Korner&#x27;s groundbreaking blues group, in 1962, recording the album &quot;R&amp;B from the Marquee&quot;. The following year, he was a founding member of that band&#x27;s breakaway unit, The Graham Bond Organisation. In 1967, Heckstall-Smith became a member of guitarist-vocalist John Mayall&#x27;s blues rock band, Bluesbreakers. That jazz-skewed edition of the band also included drummer Jon Hiseman, bassist Tony Reeves, and future Rolling Stones guitarist Mick Taylor. They released the album &quot;Bare Wires&quot; in 1968.

From 1968 to 1971, Heckstall-Smith, Hiseman, and Reeves were members of the pioneering UK jazz-rock band Colosseum. The band afforded Heckstall-Smith an opportunity to showcase his writing and instrumental virtuosity, playing two saxophones simultaneously. During that period, he also worked with the New Jazz Orchestra and played on Jack Bruce&#x27;s album &quot;Things We Like&quot;.

When Colosseum broke up in October 1971, Heckstall-Smith recorded solo albums (1972&#x27;s &quot;A Story Ended&quot; featuring lyrics by Pete Brown) and fronted and played in several other fusion units, including Manchild, Sweet Pain, Big Chief, Tough Tenors, The Famous Bluesblasters, Mainsqueeze, and DHSS. Collaborating musicians common to many of these outfits included Victor Brox, Keith Tillman and harp player John O&#x27;Leary, a founder member of Savoy Brown. In the 1980s, in his Electric Dream ensemble Heckstall-Smith also worked with the South African percussionist Julian Bahula. From 1983 to 1986, Heckstall-Smith was a member of 3-Space with John James (guitar), fellow Mainsqueeze member Dave Moore (keys), and Chris Billings (bass), with Paul Harris on keys for one tour. Apart from tenor and soprano sax, Heckstall-Smith also played baritone sax in 3-Space.

Heckstall-Smith participated in a 1994 reunion of the original Colosseum lineup and played in the hard-working Hamburg Blues Band. In 2001, he recorded the all-star project &quot;Blues and Beyond&quot;, which reunited him with Mayall, Bruce, Taylor, ex-Mayall and Fleetwood Mac guitarist Peter Green.

Described as a &quot;witty&quot; writer, Heckstall-Smith published his memoirs, &quot;The Safest Place in the World&quot;, in 1984; an expanded version, retitled &quot;Blowing the Blues&quot;, was published in 2004. He died aged 70 in 2004, as a result of acute liver failure.

<text>Panayiotis Varotsos (; born November 28, 1947 in Patras) is a Greek physicist and former professor in the Department of Physics of the University of Athens, notable for his VAN method to predict earthquakes.

His group claims the ability to identify electromagnetic signals that are precursors to earthquakes. They suggest the precursors are generated by electricity from piezo-stimulated effects in rocks being stressed just prior to the earthquake rupture. Onassis Foundation Laureate for the Environment (1995). Also awarded by the Academy of Athens (1978) and Empeirikion Foundation (1986). In 2016 the Union of Greek Physicists honoured him for his work with a prize delivered by the President of Greece.

<doc id="1333027" wikidata="Q1011125" url="?curid=1333027" title="Duitama">
<text>Duitama () is a city and municipality in the department of Boyacá. It&#x27;s the capital of the Tundama Province. Duitama is located northeast of Bogotá, the capital of Colombia and northeast of Tunja, the capital of Boyacá. In 2023 Duitama had an estimated population of 131,591.

== Etymology ==
Duitama has existed since pre-Columbian times, when the Muisca inhabited the hills surrounding a former lake in the valley. The original name of Duitama was &quot;Tundama&quot;, named after &quot;cacique&quot; Tundama.

The name of Duitama means &quot;to me the tribute&quot; in muyskkubun (Muisca language). In its beginnings, Duitama corresponded to a Muisca village ruled by the cacique Tundama, a word that changed for Duitama, absolute and powerful lord that he had as bosses tributaries to the Onzaga, Soatá, Chitagoto, Susacón or Cabita, Icabuco, Lupachoque, Sátiva, Tutazá and Cerinza caciques. The natives lived in bohíos, looking for the heights of the plain of the Indians, Tigua, today hills of La Milagrosa, Cargua, La Tolosa, San José (La Alacranera) and Tocogua.

Duitama is known as &quot;The Pearl of Boyacá&quot;.

== Geography ==
Duitama, situated on the Altiplano Cundiboyacense is bounded to the north by the department of Santander; Charalá and Encino, to the south by the Boyacá municipalities of Tibasosa and Paipa, to the east with the municipalities of Santa Rosa de Viterbo and Floresta.

== Climate ==
The elevation of the city is about above sea level and the average temperature is 15 °C.

Duitama&#x27;s climate is subtropical oceanic highland being cool and overcast over the course of the year. The temperature typically varies from 7 °C (45 °F) to 19 °C (67 °F) and is rarely below 4 °C (39 °F) or above 21 °C (70 °F). Sometimes Duitama has reached sub-zero temperatures such as -2,7 °C (27 °F).

== History ==

Duitama in the times before the Spanish conquest was called Tundama.

=== Conquest of Duitama ===

Before the Spanish conquest, the Muisca were organized in a loose Muisca Confederation. The confederation was composed of four main political and religious leaders, from south to north; the &quot;zipa&quot; based in Bacatá, the &quot;zaque&quot; of Hunza, the &quot;iraca&quot; of Sugamuxi and the &quot;Tundama&quot; of Duitama, then called Tundama. Additionally, more independent &quot;caciques&quot; governed other villages.

The &quot;Tundama&quot; ruled over the villages of Onzaga, Soatá, Chitagoto, Susacón, Icabuco, Lupachoque, Sátiva, Tutazá and Cerinza. The &quot;Tundama&quot; lived on the hill currently called &quot;La Tolosa&quot;.

In 1536, Spanish conquistador Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada set foot from the Caribbean coastal city of Santa Marta towards the inner highlands of then unexplored Colombia with an army of 800 men. After conquering the southern areas of the Muisca, accessed from the shores of the Magdalena River he and a reduced number of troops marched towards the northern Muisca territories. He first submitted Hunza, the seat of the &quot;zaque&quot; and in September 1537 he arrived in Sugamuxi, sacred City of the Sun where his soldiers burned the Sun Temple.

The &quot;cacique&quot; Tundama heard about the invading foreigners and tried to win time while hiding his treasures from the Spanish. One of his men proposed to surrender to the soldiers armed with superior weapons, and Tundama cut off his ears and left hand.

At the end of 1539, another Spanish conquistador who proved himself in the Kingdom of Quito and Peru, Baltasar Maldonado, entered the Tundama territories and after several battles Tundama surrendered to the Spanish rule. Tundama was killed by a hammer of Maldonado in late December 1539.

==== Tundama in Muisca history ====
=== Colonial period ===
During the colonial period of the newly established state New Kingdom of Granada, Duitama was converted to catholicism by friars of Santo Domingo, arriving in 1556. They held their positions until 1775.

Modern Duitama was not founded until 1819, before Simón Bolívar liberated the later state of Gran Colombia from the Spanish rule.

=== Modern age ===
Duitama was an agricultural community that grew after the installation of the train station in 1923 and the connection with the Colombian capital via highway. From 1950 onwards the city hosted more industry.

== International events ==
In 1995, Duitama was the second city in Latin America to host the UCI Road World Championships. The first city to host that event was San Cristóbal, Venezuela in 1977.

== Tourism ==
In Duitama the touristic village &quot;Pueblito Boyacense&quot; is a popular destination. The village is composed of colonial houses.

== Born in Duitama ==
* Camila Pinzón, model and Miss World Colombia 2022
* Alberto Camargo, former professional cyclist
* Édgar Fonseca, professional cyclist
* Daniel Rincón, former professional cyclist
* Oliverio Rincón, former professional cyclist
* Francisco Rodríguez Maldonado, former professional cyclist

<doc id="1333050" wikidata="Q11327044" url="?curid=1333050" title="Howard McNear">
<text>Howard Terbell McNear (January 27, 1905 – January 3, 1969) was an American stage, screen, and radio character actor. McNear is best remembered as the original voice of Doc Adams in the radio version of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; and as Floyd Lawson (Floyd the Barber) on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; (1961–1967).

==Career==
McNear studied at the Oatman School of Theater and later joined a stock company in San Diego. McNear also worked in radio from the late 1930s, including in the 1937–1940 radio serial &quot;Speed Gibson of the International Secret Police&quot; as ace operator Clint Barlow. McNear could be effective in such authoritative roles, but he gravitated more toward character roles, often comic. 

He enlisted as a private in the United States Army Air Corps on November 17, 1942, during World War II.
He created the role of Doc Charles Adams on CBS Radio&#x27;s &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (1952–1961). Before and during the run, he was featured in many other CBS radio programs, such as frequent roles on the popular radio detective series &quot;Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar&quot; between 1955 and 1960. Other radio credits included appearances on the anthologies &quot;Escape&quot; and &quot;Suspense&quot;.

McNear made his film debut in an uncredited role in the 1953 film &quot;Escape from Fort Bravo&quot;. In 1956, he appeared in the episode “The Pest Hole” (S1E24) in the TV version of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. In a 1958 episode of &quot;Leave it to Beaver&quot;, McNear made a TV appearance as a barber named &quot;Andy&quot;, who gave Wally his first shave. Over the course of his career, he would appear in over one hundred film and television guest spots. In 1959, McNear portrayed Dr. Dompierre in the film &quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot;, who testified about collecting evidence of a rape. In a 1960 episode of &quot;Peter Gunn&quot;, titled &quot;A Slight Touch of Homicide&quot;, McNear used the mannerisms he later developed as Floyd the barber to play Barnaby, a vigilante chemist who killed 15 mobsters with explosives.

In 1961, McNear was cast as the vague, chatty barber Floyd Lawson on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;. In 1963, he suffered a stroke that rendered most of the left side of his body paralyzed. He left the series for nearly a year and a half to recover. Andy Griffith asked McNear to return to the series. McNear agreed despite being unable to walk or stand, and the production crew accommodated him accordingly. Floyd was subsequently seen onscreen either seated or standing with support. Many scenes were shot with him sitting on a bench outside the barber shop, as opposed to trimming hair as before. In most of his post-stroke scenes, McNear&#x27;s left hand would be holding a newspaper or resting in his lap, while he moved his right arm and hand as he spoke his lines. In a 1964 episode, &quot;Otis Sues the County&quot;, McNear&#x27;s character is heard, but not seen, walking into the courthouse; the next scene shows Floyd already seated in a chair. 

In the seventh season finale of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, &quot;Goober&#x27;s Contest&quot;, in which Floyd Lawson makes his final appearance, McNear is speaking from his parked car but an obvious double is shot from the back while driving the car away. According to Jack Dodson, who played Howard Sprague on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, McNear began having difficulty remembering his lines and became anxious and frustrated during his last season. He left the series after the seventh season in 1967; the series would only remain for another year and Lawson&#x27;s barber shop and position in the show was loosely replaced by Emmett Clark, a repairman with a fix-it shop (located where the barbershop used to be) played by Paul Hartman (who continued the role in &quot;Mayberry R.F.D.&quot;). In the eighth season episode, &quot;Goober the Executive,&quot; Andy addresses the replacement by saying &quot;Floyd decides he&#x27;s got enough money and wants to retire, Emmett moves right in.&quot;

Earlier in 1961, McNear was uncredited in the animated title role of the AT&amp;T instructional film, &quot;Mr. Digit and the Battle of Bubbling Brook&quot;, who taught Ethel (Peg Lynch) of Ethel and Albert about the advantages of all-number calling. Alan Bunce, who played Albert, also reprised his role in that video. 

In 1962 he made a guest appearance on &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; in the episode &quot;Hocus Pocus and Frisby&quot;. In 1964, McNear also took a role on &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, playing Dodge City&#x27;s general store owner in “Aunt Thede” (S10E13).

==Death==
On January 3, 1969, McNear died at San Fernando Valley Veterans Hospital in California at the age of 63 of complications from pneumonia caused by a stroke. He was survived by his wife Helen and his son Christopher.

<doc id="1333086" wikidata="Q2562299" url="?curid=1333086" title="T-tree">
<text>In computer science a T-tree is a type of binary tree data structure that is used by main-memory databases, such as Datablitz, eXtremeDB, MySQL Cluster, Oracle TimesTen and MobileLite.

A T-tree is a balanced index tree data structure optimized for cases
where both the index and the actual data are fully kept in memory, just as a B-tree is an index structure optimized for storage on block oriented secondary storage devices like hard disks. T-trees seek to gain the performance benefits of in-memory tree structures such as AVL trees while avoiding the large storage space overhead which is common to them.

T-trees do not keep copies of the indexed data fields within the index tree nodes themselves. Instead, they take advantage of the fact that the actual data is always in main memory together with the index so that they just contain pointers to the actual data fields.

The &#x27;T&#x27; in T-tree refers to the shape of the node data structures in the original paper which first described this type of index.

==Node structures==
A T-tree node usually consists of pointers to the parent node, the left and right child node, an ordered array of data pointers and some extra control data. Nodes with two subtrees are called &quot;internal nodes&quot;, nodes without subtrees are called &quot;leaf nodes&quot; and nodes with only one subtree are named &quot;half-leaf&quot; nodes. A node is called the &quot;bounding node&quot; for a value if the value is between the node&#x27;s current minimum and maximum value, inclusively.

For each internal node, leaf or half leaf nodes exist that contain the predecessor of its smallest data value (called the &quot;greatest lower bound&quot;) and one that contains the successor of its largest data value (called the &quot;least upper bound&quot;). Leaf and half-leaf nodes can contain any number of data elements from one to the maximum size of the data array. Internal nodes keep their occupancy between predefined minimum and maximum numbers of elements

==Algorithms==
===Search===
* Search starts at the root node
* If the current node is the bounding node for the search value then search its data array. Search fails if the value is not found in the data array.
* If the search value is less than the minimum value of the current node then continue search in its left subtree. Search fails if there is no left subtree.
* If the search value is greater than the maximum value of the current node then continue search in its right subtree. Search fails if there is no right subtree.

===Insertion===
* Search for a bounding node for the new value. If such a node exists then:
** check whether there is still space in its data array, if so then insert the new value and finish
** if no space is available then remove the minimum value from the node&#x27;s data array and insert the new value. Now proceed to the node holding the greatest lower bound for the node that the new value was inserted to. If the removed minimum value still fits in there then add it as the new maximum value of the node, else create a new right subnode for this node.
* If no bounding node was found then insert the value into the last node searched if it still fits into it. In this case the new value will either become the new minimum or maximum value. If the value doesn&#x27;t fit anymore then create a new left or right subtree.

If a new node was added then the tree might need to be rebalanced, as described below.

===Deletion===
* Search for bounding node of the value to be deleted. If no bounding node is found then finish.
* If the bounding node does not contain the value then finish.
* delete the value from the node&#x27;s data array

Now we have to distinguish by node type:

* Internal node:

If the node&#x27;s data array now has less than the minimum number of elements then move the greatest lower bound value of this node to its data value. Proceed with one of the following two steps for the half leaf or leaf node the value was removed from.

* Leaf node:

If this was the only element in the data array then delete the node. Rebalance the tree if needed.

* Half leaf node:

If the node&#x27;s data array can be merged with its leaf&#x27;s data array without overflow then do so and remove the leaf node. Rebalance the tree if needed.

===Rotation and balancing===
A T-tree is implemented on top of an underlying self-balancing binary search tree. Specifically, Lehman and Carey&#x27;s article describes a T-tree balanced like an AVL tree: it becomes out of balance when a node&#x27;s child trees differ in height by at least two levels. This can happen after an insertion or deletion of a node. After an insertion or deletion, the tree is scanned from the leaf to the root. If an imbalance is found, one tree rotation or pair of rotations is performed, which is guaranteed to balance the whole tree.

When the rotation results in an internal node having fewer than the minimum number of items, items from the node&#x27;s new child(ren) are moved into the internal node.

==Performance and Storage==
Although T-trees were once widely used for main-memory databases because of performance benefits, recent trends for very large main-memory databases put more emphasis on provisioning cost. With modern NOSQL database systems often storing trillions of records, the memory cost to store even a single index that includes actual values can exceed tens or even hundreds of terabytes.

<text>Mendy and the Golem, originally written by Leibel Estrin and later by Matt Brandstein, is the name of two American comic book series featuring Jewish characters. It was personally approved by the Lubavitcher Rebbe.

The original was a slapstick comedy aimed primarily at children. The second series straddles a variety of genres, including swashbuckling adventures with elements of fantasy, mystery, and science fiction, while retaining slapstick humor offset by dashes of satire and political and cultural commentary. The second more modern version had artwork in the style of Archie Comics by former Archie artist Stan Goldberg.

==Publication history==
The first &quot;Mendy and the Golem&quot; series followed the exploits of Mendy Klein, who found a Golem in their father&#x27;s synagogue. The Klein siblings and their Golem (named Sholem) get into all sorts of scrapes, and walk out of them with a moral based on Jewish texts.

In the second series, the Kleins have created a modern-day Golem with the assistance of the venerable Reb Zushe, an aging Rabbinical scholar. This version of the characters originated as a series of comic strips, &quot;Mendy&#x27;s Fun Page&quot; that ran weekly in Jewish newspapers in North America and Australia, beginning in 1997.

===1981 series===
Billed as &quot;The World&#x27;s Only Kosher Comic Book&quot;, Mendy Enterprises&#x27; &quot;Mendy and the Golem&quot; first appeared in 1981 available for $1.00. Written by Leibel Estrin and drawn by Dovid Sears, the comic book featured the offbeat misadventures of Mendy, an Orthodox Jewish boy, and his pet Golem. Other characters include Mendy&#x27;s parents, Rabbi Yaakov and Sara Klein; Mendy&#x27;s sister, Rivky; and a host of colorful supporting characters such as Moshe the Mayven; the Lone Stranger and his faithful friend Toronto; Captain Video; Dr. Hardheart and his evil robot Oy Vayder; and Professor Nemo.

The artists and creators also frequently break the fourth wall and make various appearance&#x27;s, sometimes to explain Hebrew words, explain/add to the joke, or react to something that was said, most notably in Vol 16 War and Peace which starts off with 6 pages of the editors, publishers, and artists talking about creating that very issue.

Twenty issues were made, but only nineteen issues were produced and printed.

<text>In architecture, a hypostyle () hall has a roof which is supported by columns.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;hypostyle&quot; comes from the ancient Greek ὑπόστυλος &quot;hypóstȳlos&quot; meaning &quot;under columns&quot; (where ὑπό &quot;hypó&quot; means below or underneath and στῦλος &quot;stŷlos&quot; means column).

==Technical options==
The roof may be constructed with bridging lintels of stone, wood or other rigid material such as cast iron, steel or reinforced concrete. There may be a ceiling. The columns may be all the same height or, as in the case of the Great Hypostyle Hall at Karnak, the columns flanking the central space may be of greater height rather than those of the side aisles, allowing openings in the wall above the smaller columns, through which light is admitted over the aisle roof, through clerestory windows.

===Applications===
The architectural form has many applications, occurring in the &quot;cella&quot; of ancient Greek temples and in many Asian buildings, particularly of wood construction.

===Mosques===

With a combination of columns and arches, the hypostyle hall became one of the two main types of mosque construction. In many mosques, especially the early congregational mosques, the prayer hall has the hypostyle form. One of the finest examples of the hypostyle-plan mosques is the Great Mosque of Kairouan (also called the Mosque of Uqba) in the city of Kairouan, Tunisia.

<doc id="1333120" wikidata="Q5529206" url="?curid=1333120" title="Gazumping">
<text>Gazumping occurs when a seller (especially of property) accepts a verbal offer (a promise to purchase) on the property from one potential buyer, but then accepts a higher offer from someone else. This can happen at any point before the sale is legally finalised. It can also refer to the seller raising the asking price or asking for more money at the last minute, after previously verbally agreeing to a lower one. In either case, the original buyer is left in a bad situation, and either has to offer a higher price or lose the purchase. The term &quot;gazumping&quot; is most commonly used in the United Kingdom and Ireland, although similar practices can be found in some other jurisdictions.

== England and Wales ==
With buoyant property prices in the British residential property market of the late 1980s, gazumping became commonplace in England and Wales, because a buyer&#x27;s offer is not legally binding even after acceptance of the offer by the vendor. A contract for the sale of land must be in writing, a requirement of English law that dates back to the Statute of Frauds of 1677 and is restated by s.2 of the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989. This requirement was originally intended to promote good faith and certainty in land transactions and to prevent dishonesty.

When the owner accepts the offer on a property, the buyer will usually not yet have commissioned a building survey nor will the buyer have yet had the opportunity to perform recommended legal checks. The offer to purchase is made &quot;subject to contract&quot; and thus, until &quot;written&quot; contracts are exchanged, either party can pull out at any time. It can take as long as 10–12 weeks for formalities to be completed, and if the seller is tempted by a higher offer during this period, it leaves the buyer disappointed and out-of-pocket. Asking price has no impact on whether a property will be &quot;gazumped&quot;, but location does: it is more common in London and the North East. Accepting any offer over a previous offer is known as gazumping.

When property prices are in decline, the practice of gazumping becomes rare. The term &#x27;gazundering&#x27; has been coined for the opposite practice, whereby the buyer waits until everybody is poised to exchange contracts before lowering the offer on the property, threatening the collapse of a whole chain of house sales waiting for the deal to go through. &#x27;Gazanging&#x27; describes a similar situation, wherein a seller pulls out of a sale entirely, expecting to get a better asking price or offer once the market improves.

The term may be derived from the Yiddish word &#x27;gezumph&#x27;, meaning to overcharge or cheat.

==Scotland==
Scots law and practice makes the problem of gazumping a rarity in Scotland. In the Scottish system of conveyancing, buyers either obtain a survey prior to making a bid to the seller&#x27;s solicitor or make an offer &quot;subject to survey&quot;. Sellers normally set a closing date for written offers, then provide written acceptance of the chosen bid. The agreement becomes binding when a seller&#x27;s solicitor delivers a signed written acceptance of a buyer&#x27;s offer. Should the seller attempt to accept a higher bid after the contracts have been legally finalised by a written offer and acceptance, their solicitor will refuse to act for them, as this, according to the Law Society of Scotland code of practice, would be professional misconduct. As in England, all contracts for the sale of land must be evidenced in writing, signed by or on behalf of each party. In Scotland, the parties&#x27; solicitors sign on their behalf, unlike in England, where buyer and seller both sign a contract which has been produced in duplicate form, with the duplicates then being exchanged to effect a binding contract. It is often wrongly claimed that gazumping is a rarity in Scotland because it is said that an oral agreement on a property deal is legally binding; while the law on contract differs from the law in England, the rarity is due to the different system of conveyancing.

In Scotland, however, an estate agent, acting on behalf of the seller, can initiate instances of another form of gazumping. Once a closing date for written offers has been reached and an estate agent has given an oral acceptance of the chosen bid, the estate agent can then attempt to induce a bidding war between the successful buyer and a rival, who may be fictional, in an attempt to increase the offer made by each party. In such circumstance, there is little recourse for a successful buyer who, despite having been informed orally that their offer has been accepted, is then informed orally that their offer has been rejected in favour of a higher bid. Such situations only occur at an early stage of the conveyancing process, prior to any written acceptance of an offer being given by the seller&#x27;s solicitor. Often they result from the legal requirement on the part of estate agents to advise a seller of any higher offer received prior to written confirmation of an orally accepted offer being given, including those received after a closing date.

In Scotland, gazundering is possible where the buyer has insufficient assets to be worth suing, but is not common.

==United States==
The term &quot;gazumping&quot; is not used in the United States as once a house sale and price are agreed verbally it is binding in law. Every state has different laws and traditions, but buyers typically make a written offer that, when accepted (signed) by the seller, is in most localities binding on the seller. This is known as a &quot;purchase and sale&quot; contract, which may have conditions. U.S. residential purchase contracts typically contain an inspection clause, a short period during which the buyer can inspect the property and back out of the contract with the full return of the earnest money, if the property does not pass the buyer&#x27;s inspections. The seller, however, cannot, except in some states, back out during the inspection period. New Jersey is one state where the seller has a &quot;legal review&quot; period, during which they can back out of an accepted contract.

==Gazundering==
&quot;Gazundering&quot; is where a prospective buyer (especially of a property) offers to buy the property at an agreed price but subsequently threatens to withdraw the offer unless the seller agrees to a lower price. If the seller does not agree with the change in price, the deal may fall through. 
Gazundering became widespread in the 1980s due to the decade&#x27;s housing market deregulation, skyrocketing house prices and buyers having a legal advantage over sellers.
There are two circumstances where this happens:
* In a falling market, where the value of the property has fallen significantly in the period between the initial agreement and the expected sale date.
* Just before formal contracts are signed, when the buyer believes the seller is in a weak position (a practice is generally perceived as unethical). The seller could be in a weak position, having entered into other commitments such as a chain and would be very reluctant to pull out.

<doc id="1333125" wikidata="Q975931" url="?curid=1333125" title="Józef Dowbor-Muśnicki">
<text>Józef Dowbor-Muśnicki (Iosif Romanovich while in the Russian military; sometimes also Dowbór-Muśnicki; ; 25 October 1867 – 26 October 1937) was a Polish general, serving with the Imperial Russian and then Polish armies. He was also the military commander of the Greater Poland Uprising.

==Early life==
Dowbor-Muśnicki was born in the Garbów (near Sandomierz) in an estate in the Radom Governorate of Congress Poland, the part of Poland that was then a part of the Russian Empire. His father was Roman Muśnicki, the owner of Garbów, descended from the Lithuanian Dowborów (Daubor) family (Przyjaciel coat of arms), who settled in Sandomierz during the 17th century. Józef was the younger brother of Konstanty, also a lieutenant general. Their mother was Antonina née Wierzbicki. 

His family traced its roots to medieval Polish nobility of evangelical reformed denomination. Dowbor received his basic education in the Nikolayevskiy Cadet Corps (Saint Petersburg). 

== Service in the Russian Military (1884–1914) ==
In 1884 he joined the Russian military and graduated from the 2nd &quot;Konstantinovskoye&quot; Military School (Saint Petersburg) in 1888. After serving in the Fanagorisky Grenadiers regiment, he studied at the General Staff Academy and graduated in 1902. He served in Manchuria during the Russo-Japanese War as a staff officer with the First Siberian Corps. On 11 September 1906 he was appointed a senior staff adjutant of the Irkutsk Military District and on 2 March 1908, a staff officer of the Xth Corps. On 9 November 1910 he became chief of staff of the 10th Infantry Division and on 21 April 1912 he was appointed to the same position with the 7th Infantry Division.

==World War I (1914–1917)==
At the beginning of World War I, Dowbor-Muśnicki was put in command of the 14th Siberian Infantry Regiment. On 3 September 1915 Dowbor-Muśnicki, by then a general, was assigned to the staff of the Russian 1st Army. On 25 February 1916 he was put in charge of the 123rd Infantry Division and on 7 November 1916 of the 38th Infantry Division. He was temporarily put in charge of the staff of the Russian 1st Army on 17 January 1917, 5 weeks before the February Revolution that overthrew Tsar Nicholas II.

==1917 Revolution==
In the immediate aftermath of the February Revolution, Dowbor-Muśnicki continued his military career and was appointed commander of the XXXVIIIth Corps on 28 April 1917 and made Lieutenant General on 5 May 1917. In the meantime, however, the Russian Provisional Government&#x27;s obvious weakness, its half-hearted declaration of the right of nations to self-determination and Germany&#x27;s promises of autonomy in occupied Poland stirred up long suppressed nationalist feelings among ethnic Poles living within the Russian Empire. Roughly 700,000 of them were serving in the Russian military by 1917 and they began forming a Polish army to fight for a &quot;united and free Poland&quot; with the assent of the Provisional Government. In August, the newly formed Main Polish Military Executive Committee appointed Dowbor-Muśnicki Commissar of the Petrograd Military District and on August 23 (Old Style) he was appointed commander of the newly formed Polish 1st Corps in Russia. The reorganization process was complicated by the October Revolution of 1917, which brought Bolsheviks to power, but Dowbor-Muśnicki was able to take advantage of the new government&#x27;s weakness and general anarchy to form 3 divisions in Belarus by January 1918.

==Against the Bolsheviks (1918)==

On , Dowbor-Muśnicki refused an order by the Soviet government to disband the Corps, which quickly led to clashes with the newly formed Red Army and Red Latvian riflemen under Jukums Vācietis. After sporadic fighting in late January, on January 31 Dowbor-Muśnicki&#x27;s Corps had to retreat to Bobruisk and Slutsk, where he was surrounded by German forces. After the temporary breakdown of the Brest-Litovsk peace negotiations on February 10, Dowbor-Muśnicki joined the German offensive against the Bolsheviks on February 18 and took Minsk. After the signing of the Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaty, which gave all of Poland and Belarus to Germany, Dowbor-Muśnicki&#x27;s corps remained in Belarus for 3 months, regrouping and performing police duties under German occupation authorities. In May 1918, Dowbor-Muśnicki was forced to sign an agreement with Germany that led to the disarmament and effective dissolution of the Corps by July 1918, at which point he moved to Poland. The agreement was criticized by some pro-independence Polish politicians, but it preserved the core of the Polish military, which proved decisive later that year.

==Against the Germans==
After the armistice that ended World War I in November 1918, Dowbor-Muśnicki helped organize a new Polish army around the disbanded 1st Corps and its officers. On 6 January 1919 he was nominated by the Supreme People&#x27;s Council, the temporary ruling body of the province of Greater Poland, as the new commanding officer of all the Polish forces in the area. Two days later he arrived to Poznań and on January 16 he officially assumed his post, replacing Major Stanisław Taczak during the Greater Poland Uprising against Germany in the disputed region.

During his service as the commander in chief of the Uprising, Dowbor-Muśnicki was responsible for almost complete reorganization of what was started as a para-military partisan force. He introduced conscription and mobilized eleven classes of recruits and reformed the partisans into divisions. During his command, the Greater Polish Army grew from merely 20,000 to over 100,000 soldiers, well-armed and well-equipped. After the Battle of Ławica in which the Poles managed to capture the airfield, the Greater Polish Army was the fourth force in the world in number of aeroplanes available. Dowbor-Muśnicki focused also on political matters and strived for political neutrality of the forces under his command, which made him demobilize some of the leftist and rightist officers. He also disbanded the leftist &quot;soldiers&#x27; councils&quot;.

To some extent Dowbor-Muśnicki was conflicted with the Polish General Staff. Due to difficult diplomatic situation of Poland during the early stages of the Paris Peace Conference, the forces of the Greater Poland Uprising were separated from the Polish Army and were thought of as a separate entity. Because of that, he opposed drafting Poles from Greater Poland into the Polish Army and sending them to the fronts of the Polish-Ukrainian War and the Polish-Bolshevik War. Instead, he envisioned an offensive towards north which would spread the Uprising to the lands of Pomerania. However, after the area was peacefully transferred to Poland, his plans were made obsolete. Despite the conflict, on 19 March 1919 he was promoted to the rank of Generał broni, the highest rank of the Polish forces at that time. Finally, after the end of hostilities, on 19 October 1919 the Dowbor-Muśnicki&#x27;s forces were merged with Józef Haller&#x27;s Blue Army and the Polish Army while at the same time the lands of Greater Poland were officially incorporated into Poland.

==Retirement==
Józef Dowbor-Muśnicki remained the commander of the so-called Greater Poland Front until the outbreak of the Polish-Bolshevik War, after which he resigned his post and applied to Józef Piłsudski for a new assignment. After General Stanisław Szeptycki declined to take the post of the commanding officer of the Ukrainian Front from General Wacław Iwaszkiewicz, the post was offered to Dowbor-Muśnicki, who refused. Having no further assignments, in March 1920 he resigned all his posts in the army and settled in Lusowo and then in Batorowo near Poznań. Opposing Piłsudski&#x27;s Coup d&#x27;État of 1926, he did not rejoin the army during the internal struggle. Instead, he focused on writing his memoirs, &quot;Moje wspomnienia&quot; (&quot;My Memoirs&quot;). He suffered a heart attack on 26 October 1937 and was buried at the family tomb at the local cemetery.

== Family ==
Dowbor-Muśnicki had two sons, Giedymin and Olgierd, and two daughters, Janina and Agnieszka. Olgierd committed suicide before World War II, Giedymin emigrated to France in the 1930s, while both daughters were executed during World War II. Agnieszka, who was an active member of the Polish resistance, was arrested by the German occupiers, tortured in the Pawiak prison in Warsaw and then executed in the Palmiry mass murder site, while Janina Lewandowska was the only woman murdered by the Soviet NKVD during the Katyn massacre.

<doc id="1333137" wikidata="Q2580416" url="?curid=1333137" title="William Rothenstein">
<text>Sir William Rothenstein (29 January 1872 – 14 February 1945) was an English painter, printmaker, draughtsman, lecturer, and writer on art. Though he covered many subjects – ranging from landscapes in France to representations of Jewish synagogues in London – he is perhaps best known for his work as a war artist in both world wars, his portraits, and his popular memoirs, written in the 1930s. More than two hundred of Rothenstein&#x27;s portraits of famous people can be found in the National Portrait Gallery collection. The Tate Gallery also holds a large collection of his paintings, prints and drawings. Rothenstein served as Principal at the Royal College of Art from 1920 to 1935. He was knighted in 1931 for his services to art. In March 2015 &#x27;From Bradford to Benares: the Art of Sir William Rothenstein&#x27;, the first major exhibition of Rothenstein&#x27;s work for over forty years, opened at Bradford&#x27;s Cartwright Hall Gallery, touring to the Ben Uri in London later that year.

==Personal life==

William Rothenstein was born into a German-Jewish family in Bradford, West Riding of Yorkshire where he was educated at Bradford Grammar School. His father, Moritz, emigrated from Germany in 1859 to work in Bradford&#x27;s burgeoning textile industry. Soon afterwards he married Bertha Dux and they had six children, of whom William was the fifth.

William&#x27;s two brothers, Charles and Albert, were also heavily involved in the arts. Charles (1866–1927), who followed his father into the wool trade, was an important collector – and left his entire collection to Manchester Art Gallery in 1925. Albert (1881–1953) was a painter, illustrator and costume designer. Both brothers changed their surname to Rutherston during the First World War.

He married Alice Knewstub in 1899 with whom he had four children: John, Betty, Rachel and Michael. John Rothenstein later gained fame as an art historian and art administrator (he was Director of the Tate Gallery from 1938 to 1964 and was knighted in 1952). Michael Rothenstein was a talented printmaker.

==Education==
Rothenstein left Bradford Grammar School at the age of sixteen to study at the Slade School of Art, London (1888–93), where he was taught by Alphonse Legros, and the Académie Julian in Paris (1889–1893), where he met and was encouraged by James McNeill Whistler, Edgar Degas and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. While in Paris he also befriended the Anglo-Australian artist Charles Conder, with whom he shared a studio in Montmartre.

==Career==

===Artist===
In 1893 Rothenstein returned to Britain to work on &quot;Oxford Characters&quot; a series of lithographic portraits, eventually published in 1896 Other portrait collections by the artist include &quot;English Portraits&quot; (1898), &quot;Twelve Portraits&quot; (1929) and &quot;Contemporaries&quot; (1937). In Oxford he met and became a close friend of the caricaturist and parodist Max Beerbohm, who later immortalised him in the short story Enoch Soames (1919). During the 1890s Rothenstein exhibited with the New English Art Club and contributed drawings to &quot;The Yellow Book&quot; and &quot;The Savoy&quot;.

In 1898–99 he co-founded the Carfax Gallery (or Carfax &amp; Co) in St. James&#x27; Piccadilly with John Fothergill (later innkeeper of the Spread Eagle in Thame). During its early years the gallery was closely associated with artists Charles Conder, Philip Wilson Steer, Charles Ricketts and Augustus John. It also exhibited the work of Auguste Rodin, whose growing reputation in England owed much to Rothenstein&#x27;s friendship. Rothenstein&#x27;s role as artistic manager of the gallery was abandoned in 1901, whereupon the firm came under the management of his close friend Robert Ross. Ross left in 1908, leaving the gallery in the hands of longtime financial manager Arthur Clifton. Under Clifton the gallery was the home for all three exhibitions of the Camden Town Group, led by Rothenstein&#x27;s friend and close contemporary Walter Sickert.

In 1900 Rothenstein won a silver medal for his painting &quot;The Doll&#x27;s House&quot; at the Exposition Universelle. This painting continues to be one of his best-known and most critically acclaimed works, and was the subject of a recent in-depth study published by the Tate Gallery.

The style and subject of Rothenstein&#x27;s paintings varies, though certain themes reappear, in particular an interest in &#x27;weighty&#x27; or &#x27;essential&#x27; subjects tackled in a restrained manner. Good examples include &quot;Parting at Morning&quot; (1891), &quot;Mother and Child&quot; (1903) and &quot;Jews Mourning at a Synagogue&quot; (1907) – all of which are owned by the Tate Gallery.

Between 1902 and 1912 Rothenstein lived in Hampstead, London, where his social circle included H. G. Wells, Joseph Conrad and the artist Augustus John. Amongst the young artists to visit Rothenstein in Hampstead were Wyndham Lewis, Mark Gertler and Paul Nash. During this period Rothenstein worked on a series of important paintings in the predominantly Jewish East End of London, some of which were included in the influential 1906 exhibition of Jewish Art and Antiquaries at the Whitechapel Gallery.

Another feature of this period are the celebrated interiors he painted, the most famous of which is &quot;The Browning Readers&quot; (1900), now owned by Cartwright Hall gallery, Bradford. Most of Rothenstein&#x27;s interiors feature members of his family, especially his wife Alice. Reminiscent of Dutch painting (particularly Vermeer and Rembrandt), they are similar in style to contemporary works by William Orpen, who became Rothenstein&#x27;s brother-in-law in 1901, marrying Alice&#x27;s sister Grace. Other notable interiors include &quot;Spring, The Morning Room&quot; (c.1910) and &quot;Mother and Child, Candlight&quot; (c.1909).

Rothenstein maintained a lifelong fascination for Indian sculpture and painting, and in 1910 set out on a seminal tour of the subcontinent&#x27;s major artistic and religious sites. This began with a visit to the ancient Buddhist caves of Ajanta, where he observed Lady Christiana Herringham and Nandalal Bose making watercolour copies of the ancient frescoes. He subsequently contributed a chapter on their importance to the published edition. The trip ended with a stay in Calcutta, where he witnessed the attempts of Abanindranath Tagore to revive the techniques and aesthetics of traditional Indian painting.

He was a member of the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers.

===Royal College of Art===

Rothenstein was principal of the Royal College of Art from 1920 to 1935, where he encouraged figures including Edward Burra, Evelyn Dunbar, U Ba Nyan and Henry Moore. Moore was later to write that Rothenstein &quot;gave me the feeling that there was no barrier, no limit to what a young provincial student could get to be and do&quot;. Rothenstein was a master of lobbying and advocacy for his students, notably when, thanks to his efforts, Edward Bawden and Eric Ravilious were commissioned to paint a mural in the dining room of Morley College. After being appointed, he introduced greater informality and was permitted to appoint practising artists, including Paul Nash and Edward Johnston as visiting lecturers. In due course, those students who built successful careers were invited back to the college to lecture.

===Writer===
Rothenstein wrote several critical books and pamphlets, including &quot;Goya&quot; (1900; the first English monograph on the artist), &quot;A Plea for a Wider Use of Artists &amp; Craftsmen&quot; (1916) and &quot;Whither Painting&quot; (1932). During the 1930s he published three volumes of memoirs: &quot;Men and Memories, Vol I and II&quot; and &quot;Since Fifty&quot;. &quot;Men and Memories Volume I&quot; includes anecdotes about Oscar Wilde and many other friends of Rothenstein&#x27;s, including Max Beerbohm, James Whistler, Paul Verlaine, Edgar Degas, and John Singer Sargent.

==Recognition==
Rothenstein was knighted in the New Year Honours in 1931. Rabindranath Tagore dedicated his Nobel Prize winner poetry collection &quot;Gitanjali&quot; to William Rothenstein.

In 2011 the BBC and the Public Catalogue Foundation began cataloguing all of his paintings in public ownership online.

<text>Henry Noel Brailsford (25 December 1873 – 23 March 1958) was an English journalist and writer, considered one of the most prolific left-wing journalists of the first half of the 20th century. A founding member of the Men&#x27;s League for Women&#x27;s Suffrage in 1907, he resigned from his job at &quot;The Daily News&quot; in 1909 when it supported the force-feeding of suffragettes on hunger strike.

==Early life==
The son of a Wesleyan Methodist minister, Brailsford was born in the West Riding of Yorkshire and educated at the High School of Dundee in Scotland.

==Career in journalism==
Brailsford abandoned an academic career to become a journalist, rising to prominence in the 1890s as a foreign correspondent for &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, specialising in the Balkans, France and Egypt.

In 1899 he moved to London, working for the &quot;Morning Leader&quot; and then &quot;The Daily News&quot;. He led a British relief mission to Macedonia in 1903, publishing a book, &quot;Macedonia: Its Races and Their Future&quot;, on his return. In the book, Brailsford took a pro-Bulgarian stance.

In 1905 he was convicted of conspiring to obtain a British passport in the name of one person for another person to travel to Russia.

The Men&#x27;s League for Women&#x27;s Suffrage was formed in 1907 in London by Brailsford, Charles Corbett, Henry Nevinson, Laurence Housman, C. E. M. Joad, Hugh Franklin, Henry Harben, Gerald Gould, Charles Mansell-Moullin, Israel Zangwill and 32 others. Brailsford joined the Independent Labour Party in 1907 and resigned from &quot;The Daily News&quot; in 1909 when it supported force-feeding of suffragette prisoners. He co-authored with Dr Jessie Murray, a psychologist and suffragette, a report &quot;The Treatment of Women&#x27;s Deputations by the Metropolitan Police&quot;, over the violence of the Metropolitan Police during the Black Friday demonstration (18 November 1910). Over the next decade he wrote several books, among them &quot;Adventures in Prose&quot; (1911), &quot;Shelley, Godwin and their Circle&quot; (1913), &quot;War of Steel and Gold&quot; (1914), &quot;Origins of the Great War&quot; (1914), &quot;Belgium and the Scrap of Paper&quot; (1915) and &quot;A League of Nations&quot; (1917).

In 1913–14 Brailsford was a member of the international commission sent by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace to investigate the conduct of the Balkan Wars of 1912–13. He co-authored its report.

He was a prominent member of the Union of Democratic Control during the First World War and stood unsuccessfully as a Labour Party candidate in the 1918 general election. He subsequently toured central Europe and his graphic accounts of life in the defeated countries appeared in his books &quot;Across the Blockade&quot; (1919) and &quot;After the Peace&quot; (1920).

Brailsford went to Soviet Russia in 1920 and again to the USSR in 1926, publishing two books on the subject. He was editor of the &quot;New Leader&quot;, the ILP newspaper, from 1922 to 1926. He left the ILP in 1932 and through the 1930s was a regular contributor to &quot;Reynold&#x27;s News&quot; and the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. Brailsford was an outspoken critic of Mussolini&#x27;s Italy and Hitler&#x27;s Germany.

His books in the 1930s include the anti-colonialist classic &quot;Rebel India&quot; (1931) and the anti-militarist &quot;Property or Peace?&quot; (1934). In the late 1930s, he was one of the few writers associated with the Left Book Club, the &quot;New Statesman&quot; and &quot;Tribune&quot; who was consistently critical of the Soviet show trials.

Following the Soviet invasion of Finland, Brailsford published a hostile essay about Stalin in the left-wing &quot;Reynold&#x27;s News&quot;:

Stalin ... has compelled us to pass the judgement we had hitherto refused to register. His Russia is a totalitarian state, like another, as brutal towards the rights of others, as careless of its plighted word. If this man ever understood the international creed of socialism, he long ago forgot it. In this land the absolute power has wrought its customary effects of corruption.

During the Second World War, Brailsford penned a weekly column in &quot;Reynold&#x27;s News&quot;. He also continued to write books, the most important being &quot;Subject India&quot; (1943) and &quot;Our Settlement with Germany&quot; (1944). After his retirement from journalism in 1946, he wrote a history of the Levellers, which was unfinished at the time of his death.

Paul Foot described Brailsford as &quot;perhaps the best socialist writer in Britain at the time&quot;.

==Personal life==

He married a former student, the women&#x27;s activist Jane Esdon Malloch in 1898. She denied him children and regarded the marriage as demeaning. They separated but she refused him a divorce.

In 1928 he met the artist Clare Leighton and they lived together for several years. His wife died in 1937 after years of drinking, and whereas this removed any legal obstacle to the couple being married, Brailsford, consumed by guilt, suffered an emotional breakdown, effectively destroying his relationship with Leighton who left for the US in 1939.

In 1944 he married Evamaria Perlmann, a refugee from Germany, 40 years his junior.

Brailsford was an advocate of animal rights and was a vegetarian. In opposition to G. K. Chesterton he defended the practice of vegetarianism in &quot;The Daily News&quot;. His fondness for animals was a lifelong trait and he found it easier to show affection to animals as they did not betray or disappoint him. He opposed blood sports and several of his essays allude to his friendship with cats.

<doc id="1333161" wikidata="Q3441395" url="?curid=1333161" title="Laser level">
<text>In surveying and construction, the laser level is a control tool consisting of a rotating laser beam projector that can be affixed to a tripod. The tool is leveled according to the accuracy of the device and projects a fixed red or green beam in a plane about the horizontal and/or vertical axis.

==Development==
The concept of a laser level has been around since at least the early 1970s, the original spinning-mirror design laser plane and line level was patented by the late 1980s, and the compact lens-based laser line level (as produced by many tool manufacturers today) was patented in the late 1990s. It was invented by Oscar Soliz in the late 1960s, who later sold the rights to it.

==Rotary laser level==
A rotary laser level is a more advanced laser level in that it spins the beam of light fast enough to give the effect of a complete 360 degree horizontal or vertical plane, thus illuminating not just a fixed line, but a horizontal plane. The laser beam projector employs a rotating head with a mirror for sweeping the laser beam about a vertical axis. If the mirror is not self-leveling, it is provided with visually readable level vials and manually adjustable screws for orienting the projector. A staff carried by the operator is equipped with a movable sensor, which can detect the laser beam and gives a signal when the sensor is in line with the beam (usually an audible beep). The position of the sensor on the graduated staff, also known as a grade rod, or story pole, allows comparison of elevations between different points on the terrain. Most laser levels are used in the construction industry.

== Tower-mounted laser level ==
A tower-mounted laser level is used in combination with a sensor on a wheel tractor-scraper in the process of land laser leveling to bring land (for example, an agricultural field) to near-flatness with a slight grade for drainage.

Nomicos, authors of the 1981 papers describing it – measures low frequency electric signals, termed &quot;seismic electric signals&quot; (SES), by which Varotsos and several colleagues claimed to have successfully predicted earthquakes in Greece. Both the method itself and the manner by which successful predictions were claimed have been severely criticized. Supporters of VAN have responded to the criticism but the critics have not retracted their views.

Since 2001, the VAN group has introduced a concept they call &quot;natural time&quot;, applied to the analysis of their precursors. Initially it is applied on SES to distinguish them from noise and relate them to a possible impending earthquake. In case of verification (classification as &quot;SES activity&quot;), natural time analysis is additionally applied to the general subsequent seismicity of the area associated with the SES activity, in order to improve the time parameter of the prediction. The method treats earthquake onset as a critical phenomenon.

After 2006, VAN say that all alarms related to SES activity have been made public by posting at arxiv.org. One such report was posted on Feb. 1, 2008, two weeks before the strongest earthquake in Greece during the period 1983-2011. This earthquake occurred on February 14, 2008, with magnitude (Mw) 6.9. VAN&#x27;s report was also described in an article in the newspaper Ethnos on Feb. 10, 2008. However, Gerassimos Papadopoulos complained that the VAN reports were confusing and ambiguous, and that &quot;none of the claims for successful VAN predictions is justified&quot;, but this complaint was answered on the same issue.

== Description of the VAN method ==

Prediction of earthquakes with this method is based on the detection, recording and evaluation of seismic electric signals or SES. These electrical signals have a fundamental frequency component of 1 Hz or less and an amplitude the logarithm of which scales with the magnitude of the earthquake. According to VAN proponents, SES are emitted by rocks under stresses caused by plate-tectonic forces. There are three types of reported electric signal:

*Electric signals that occur shortly before a major earthquake. Signals of this type were recorded 6.5 hours before the 1995 Kobe earthquake in Japan, for example.
*Electric signals that occur some time before a major earthquake.
*A gradual variation in the Earth&#x27;s electric field some time before an earthquake.

Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain SES:
*Stress-related phenomena: Seismic electric signals are perhaps attributed to the piezoelectric behaviour of some minerals, especially quartz, or to effects related to the behavior of crystallographic defects under stress or strain. Series of SES, termed SES activities (which are recorded before major earthquakes), may appear a few weeks to a few months before an earthquake when the mechanical stress reaches a critical value. The generation of electric signals by minerals under high stress leading to fracture has been confirmed with laboratory experiments.
*Thermoelectric phenomena: Alternately, Chinese researchers proposed a mechanism which relies on the thermoelectric effect in magnetite.
*Groundwater phenomena: Three mechanisms have been proposed relying on the presence of groundwater in generating SES. The electrokinetic effect is associated with the motion of groundwater during a change in pore pressure. The seismic dynamo effect is associated with the motion of ions in groundwater relative to the geomagnetic field as a seismic wave creates displacement. Circular polarization would be characteristic of the seismic dynamo effect, and this has been observed both for artificial and natural seismic events. A radon ionization effect, caused by radon release and then subsequent ionization of material in groundwater, may also be active. The main isotope of radon is radioactive with a half-life of 3.9 days, and the nuclear decay of radon is known to have an ionizing effect on air. Many publications have reported increased radon concentration in the vicinity of some active tectonic faults a few weeks prior to strong seismic events. However, a strong correlation between radon anomalies and seismic events has not been demonstrated.

While the electrokinetic effect may be consistent with signal detection tens or hundreds of kilometers away, the other mechanisms require a second mechanism to account for propagation:
*Signal transmission along faults: In one model, seismic electric signals propagate with relatively low attenuation along tectonic faults, due to the increased electrical conductivity caused either by the intrusion of ground water into the fault zone(s) or by the ionic characteristics of the minerals.
*Rock circuit: In the defect model, the presence of charge carriers and holes can be modeled as making an extensive circuit.

Seismic electric signals are detected at stations which consist of pairs of electrodes (oriented NS and EW) inserted into the ground, with amplifiers and filters. The signals are then transmitted to the VAN scientists in Athens where they are recorded and evaluated. Currently the VAN team operates 9 stations, while in the past (until 1989) they could afford up to 17.

The VAN team claimed that they were able to predict earthquakes of magnitude larger than 5, with an uncertainty of 0.7 units of magnitude, within a radius of 100 km, and in time window ranging from several hours to a few weeks. Several papers confirmed this success rate, leading to statistically significant conclusion. For example, there were eight M ≥ 5.5 earthquakes in Greece from January 1, 1984 through September 10, 1995, and the VAN network forecast six of these.

The VAN method has also been used in Japan, but in early attempts success comparable to that achieved in Greece was &quot;difficult&quot; to attain. A preliminary investigation of seismic electric signals in France led to encouraging results.

== Earthquake prediction using &quot;natural time&quot; analysis ==

Since 2001 the VAN team has attempted to improve the accuracy of the estimation of the time of the forthcoming earthquake. To that end, they introduced the concept of &quot;natural time&quot;, a time series analysis technique which puts weight on a process based on the ordering of events. Two terms characterize each event, the &quot;natural time&quot; , and the energy . is defined as , where &quot;k&quot; is an integer (the -th event) and is the total number of events in the time sequence of data. A related term, , is the ratio , which describes the fractional energy released. They introduce a critical term , the &quot;variance in natural time&quot;, which puts extra weight on the energy term :

:formula_1

:where formula_2 and formula_3

Their current method deems SES valid when = 0.070. Once the SES are deemed valid, a second analysis is started in which the subsequent seismic (rather than electric) events are noted, and the region is divided up as a Venn diagram with at least two seismic events per overlapping rectangle. When the distribution of for the rectangular regions has its maximum at = 0.070, a critical seismic event is imminent, i.e. it will occur in a few days to one week or so, and a report is issued.

=== Results ===

The VAN team claim that out of seven mainshocks with magnitude Mw&gt;=6.0 from 2001 through 2010 in the region of latitude N 36° to N 41° and longitude E 19° to E 27°, all but one could be classified with relevant SES activity identified and reported in advance through natural time analysis. Additionally, they assert that the occurrence time of four of these mainshocks with magnitude Mw&gt;=6.4 were identified to within &quot;a narrow range, a few days to around one week or so.&quot; These reports are inserted in papers housed in arXiv, and new reports are made and uploaded there. For example, a report preceding the strongest earthquake in Greece during the period 1983-2011, which occurred on February 14, 2008, with magnitude (Mw) 6.9, was publicized in arXiv almost two weeks before, on February 1, 2008. A description of the updated VAN method was collected in a book published by Springer in 2011, titled &quot;Natural Time Analysis: The New View of Time.&quot;

Natural time analysis also claims that the physical connection of SES activities with earthquakes is as follows: Taking the view that the earthquake occurrence is a phase-change (critical phenomenon), where the new phase is the mainshock occurrence, the above-mentioned variance term κ is the corresponding order parameter. The κ value calculated for a window comprising a number of seismic events comparable to the average number of earthquakes occurring within a few months, fluctuates when the window is sliding through a seismic catalogue. The VAN team claims that these κ fluctuations exhibit a minimum a few months before a mainshock occurrence and in addition this minimum occurs simultaneously with the initiation of the corresponding SES activity, and that this is the first time in the literature that such a simultaneous appearance of two precursory phenomena in independent datasets of different geophysical observables (electrical measurements, seismicity) has been observed. Furthermore, the VAN team claims that their natural time analysis of the seismic catalogue of Japan during the period from January 1, 1984 until the occurrence of the magnitude 9.0 Tohoku earthquake on March 11, 2011, revealed that such clear minima of the κ fluctuations appeared before all major earthquakes with magnitude 7.6 or larger. The deepest of these minima was said to occur on January 5, 2011, i.e., almost two months before the Tohoku earthquake occurrence. Finally, by dividing the Japanese region into small areas, the VAN team states that some small areas show minimum of the κ fluctuations almost simultaneously with the large area covering the whole Japan and such small areas clustered within a few hundred kilometers from the actual epicenter of the impending major earthquake.

== Criticisms of VAN ==

Historically, the usefulness of the VAN method for prediction of earthquakes had been a matter of debate. Both positive and negative criticism on an older conception of the VAN method is summarized in the 1996 book &quot;A Critical Review of VAN&quot;, edited by Sir James Lighthill. A critical review of the statistical methodology was published by Y. Y. Kagan of UCLA in 1997. Note that these criticisms predate the time series analysis methods introduced by the VAN group in 2001. The main points of the criticism were:

=== Predictive success ===

Critics say that the VAN method is hindered by a lack of statistical testing of the validity of the hypothesis because the researchers keep changing the parameters (the moving the goalposts technique).

VAN has claimed to have observed at a recording station in Athens a perfect record of a one-to-one correlation between SESs and earthquake of magnitude ≥ 2.9 which occurred 7 hours later in all of Greece. However, Max Wyss said that the list of earthquake used for the correlation was false. Although VAN stated in their article that the list of earthquakes was that of the Bulletin of the National Observatory of Athens (NOA), Wyss found that 37% of the earthquakes actually listed in the bulletin, including the largest one, were not in the list used by VAN for issuing their claim. In addition, 40% of the earthquake which VAN claimed had occurred were not in the NOA bulletin. Examining the probability of chance correlation of another set of 22 claims of successful predictions by VAN of M &gt; 4.0 from January 1, 1987 through November 30, 1989 it was found that 74% were false, 9% correlated by chance, and for 14% the correlation was uncertain. No single event correlated at a probability greater than 85%, whereas the level required in statistics for accepting a hypothesis test as positive would more commonly be 95%.

In response to Wyss&#x27; analysis of the NOA findings, VAN said that the criticisms were based on misunderstandings. VAN said that the calculations suggested by Wyss would lead to a paradox, i.e., to probability values larger than unity, when applied to an ideal earthquake prediction method. Other independent evaluations said that VAN obtained statistically significant results.

Mainstream seismologists remain unconvinced by any of VAN&#x27;s rebuttals. In 2011 the ICEF concluded that the optimistic prediction capability claimed by VAN could not be validated. Most seismologists consider VAN to have been &quot;resoundingly debunked&quot;.

Uyeda and others in 2011, however, supported the use of the technique. In 2018, the statistical significance of the method was revisited by the VAN group employing modern techniques, such as event coincidence analysis (ECA) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC), which they interpreted to show that SES exhibit precursory information far beyond chance.

=== Proposed SES propagation mechanism ===

An analysis of the propagation properties of SES in the Earth’s crust showed that it is impossible that signals with the amplitude reported by VAN could have been generated by small earthquakes and transmitted over the several hundred kilometers between the epicenter and the receiving station. In effect, if the mechanism is based on piezoelectricity or electrical charging of crystal deformations with the signal traveling along faults, then none of the earthquakes which VAN claimed were preceded by SES generated an SES themselves. VAN answered that such an analysis of the SES propagation properties is based on a simplified model of horizontally layered Earth and that this differs greatly from the real situation since Earth&#x27;s crust contains inhomogeneities. When the latter are taken into account, for example by considering that the faults are electrically appreciably more conductive than the surrounding medium, VAN believes that electric signals transmitted at distances of the order of one hundred kilometers between the epicenter and the receiving station have amplitudes comparable to those reported by VAN.

=== Electromagnetic compatibility issues ===

VAN’s publications are further weakened by failure to address the problem of eliminating the many and strong sources of change in the magneto-electric field measured by them, such as telluric currents from weather, and electromagnetic interference (EMI) from man-made signals. One critical paper (Pham et al 1998) clearly correlates an SES used by the VAN group with digital radio transmissions made from a military base. In a subsequent paper, VAN said that such noise coming from digital radio transmitters of the military database has been clearly distinguished from true SES by following the criteria developed by VAN. Further work in Greece by Pham et al in 2002 has tracked SES-like &quot;anomalous transient electric signals&quot; back to specific human sources, and found that such signals are not excluded by the criteria used by VAN to identify SES.

In 2003, modern methods of statistical physics, i.e., detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), multifractal DFA and wavelet transform revealed that SES are clearly distinguished from those produced by human sources, since the former signals exhibit very strong long range correlations, while the latter signals do not. A work published in 2020 examined the statistical significance of the minima of the fluctuations of the order parameter κ1 of seismicity by event coincidence analysis as a possible precursor to strong earthquakes in both regional and global level. The results show that these minima are indeed statistically significant earthquake precursors. In particular, in the regional studies the time lag was found to be fully compatible with the finding that these mimima are simultaneous with the initiation of SES activities, thus the distinction of the latter precursory signals from those produced by human sources is evident.

=== Public policy ===

Finally, one requirement for any earthquake prediction method is that, in order for any prediction to be useful, it must predict a forthcoming earthquake within a reasonable time-frame, epicenter and magnitude. If the prediction is too vague, no feasible decision (such as to evacuate the population of a certain area for a given period of time) can be made. In practice, the VAN group issued a series of telegrams in the 1980s. During the same time frame, the technique also missed major earthquakes, in the sense that &quot;&quot;for earthquakes with Mb≥5.0, the ratio of the predicted to the total number of earthquakes is 6/12 (50%) and the success rate of the prediction is also 6/12 (50%) with the probability gain of a factor of 4. With a confidence level of 99.8%, the possibility of this success rate being explained by a random model of earthquake occurrence taking into account the regional factor which includes high seismicity in the prediction area, can be rejected&quot;. This study concludes that &quot;the statistical examination of the SES predictions proved high rates of success prediction and predicted events with high probability gain. This suggests a physical connection between SES and subsequent earthquakes, at least for an event of magnitude of Ms≥5&quot;&quot;. Predictions from the early VAN method led to public criticism and the cost associated with false alarms generated ill will. In 2016 the Union of Greek Physicists honored P. Varotsos for his work on VAN with a prize delivered by the President of Greece.

=== Updated VAN method ===
A review of the updated VAN method in 2020 says that it suffers from an abundance of false positives and is therefore not usable as a prediction protocol. VAN group answered by pinpointing misunderstandings in the specific reasoning.

<text>David Michael Dellucci (born October 31, 1973) is an American former professional baseball outfielder, who played 13 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for seven teams.

==High school==
Dellucci graduated from Catholic High School in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in 1991. He earned the team&#x27;s Most Valuable Player honors in both baseball and football, and All-State honors for baseball. He was also awarded the Catholic High Man of the Year award as a senior in 1991. During the winter of 2001, he was inducted into the Catholic High School Hall of Fame as a Grizzly Great.

==College==
Dellucci played four seasons at the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss), where he was an All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) selection in both 1994 and 1995 and earned All-American status in 1995, setting 10 school records and winning the SEC batting title in hitting. He was named Athlete of the Year at Ole Miss in 1995. Dellucci was elected into the Ole Miss &quot;M Club&quot; Athletic Hall of Fame in 2010 and was named as one of the 50 Greatest Athletes in Ole Miss history. He was selected by the Minnesota Twins in the 11th round (295th overall) of the 1994 Major League Baseball draft, but chose to remain at Ole Miss.

==Career==
In spite of playing well and racking up solid statistics as a college player, Dellucci was viewed by MLB Central Scouting as a utility outfielder when compared to the thick talent pool of other players in the 1995 Major League Baseball draft. As a result, he did not rate as a high pick, and he was eventually selected by the Baltimore Orioles in the 10th round (276th overall). 

Dellucci made his major league debut with Baltimore on June 3, , going 0-for-4 with a walk in a 7–5 win over the New York Yankees. On June 11, he recorded his first major league hit, an RBI single off Boston Red Sox pitcher Tom Gordon, which hit off of the Green Monster in Fenway Park. Dellucci hit his first major league home run on June 25 in a road game against Cal Eldred of the Milwaukee Brewers. In 17 games with the Orioles, he batted .222 with a home run and 3 RBI.

While playing in the Arizona Fall League during the offseason, Dellucci was selected by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the 1997-98 Major League Baseball expansion draft. He played for Arizona from the team&#x27;s inaugural season in 1998 to 2003, and was a member of the World Series-winning squad in 2001.

As a rookie in , Dellucci finished the season batting .260 with five home runs and 51 RBI in 124 games. He also led the National League in triples (12).

Dellucci got off to a hot start in , posting a batting average of .394 with 27 runs, seven doubles, a triple, a home run and 15 RBI in 63 games. However, his season was cut short in late July when he was diagnosed with a degenerative bone disease in his left wrist, known as Kienböck&#x27;s disease. He underwent reconstructive surgery on his left wrist on July 28. In honor of Dellucci, each Diamondback player and coach displayed his number on the side of their caps. Initially, the injury was thought to be potentially career-ending, but after the successful surgery and extensive rehabilitation, he returned to the team during spring training the next year. Dellucci hit .300 (15-for-50) with 2 RBI in 34 games with Arizona in .

In 115 games during the season, Dellucci hit .276 with 10 home runs and 40 RBI in just 217 at bats. Six of the home runs came as a utility player and pinch hitter. In the 2001 postseason, Dellucci appeared in six games, mainly as a pinch hitter, and recorded two hits in four at bats while scoring one run. The Diamondbacks went on to defeat the New York Yankees in Game 7 of the 2001 World Series, giving Dellucci his first World Series ring.

On July 29, , Dellucci was traded to the New York Yankees along with pitcher Bret Prinz and catcher John Sprowl, in exchange for outfielder Raúl Mondesí. He finished the 2003 season as a member of the American League champion Yankees and appeared in the 2003 World Series against the Florida Marlins. Dellucci recorded one hit in five at bats, while scoring three runs in eight playoff games. The Yankees lost the series to the Marlins in six games. On December 19, Dellucci was non-tendered by the Yankees, making him a free agent.

In December 2003, Dellucci signed a one-year, $750,000 contract with the Texas Rangers. For the season, Dellucci, in 331 at bats, hit .242 with 17 home runs and 61 RBI in 107 games. On September 23, with the Rangers looking to stay alive in the playoff race, Dellucci hit a walk-off two-run double to beat the Oakland Athletics 5–4 and keep the Rangers&#x27; playoff hopes alive. The Rangers went on to miss the postseason, but Dellucci&#x27;s double has been described as one of the most memorable plays in Rangers franchise history. After the season, Dellucci agreed to a two-year, $1.8 million contract to remain with the Rangers on December 20. 

In , Dellucci had one of his best years as a professional. He hit .251 in 128 games, and recorded a season high in total at bats (435), home runs (29) and RBI (65). He is tied for second in Rangers history with four leadoff home runs.

On April 1, , Dellucci was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for pitcher Robinson Tejeda and minor league outfielder Jake Blalock. Until the trade of Bobby Abreu, Dellucci was used mostly as a pinch hitter/reserve outfielder, but still hit .292 with 13 home runs and 39 RBI in 264 at bats.

Dellucci signed a three-year, $11.5 million contract with the Cleveland Indians on December 6, 2006. On June 19, , while running to first base, Dellucci tore his left hamstring tendon while running to first base, which required surgery and a trip to the disabled list. He was activated on September 6. Dellucci played in 56 games in his first season with Cleveland, batting .230 with four home runs and 20 RBI. In , he appeared in 113 games and hit .238 with 11 home runs and 47 RBI.

Dellucci missed time early in Spring Training due to a surgically repaired thumb after smashing it in the tailgate of his trailer. He started the 2009 season on the disabled list with a strained left calf. While hitting .275 with an RBI in 40 at bats, he was designated for assignment by the Indians on May 29, and after clearing waivers, was released on June 1.

On June 10, 2009, Dellucci agreed to terms on a minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays. He was assigned to the Las Vegas 51&#x27;s of the Pacific Coast League, where he hit .317 with three home runs and 9 RBI in 16 games. This led to the Blue Jays purchasing Dellucci&#x27;s contract, on July 3. After a brief stint with the big league club in Toronto, he was designated for assignment on July 24, 2009 after recording one hit in 25 at bats (.040) as a Blue Jay. Electing not to accept his designation, he was released on July 31. Dellucci did not return to playing, and chose to retire.

==Career after baseball==

Dellucci currently works as a color analyst for SEC Network and ESPN. He is also on the National Wildlife Federation&#x27;s Vanishing Paradise advisory board.

In 2011, Dellucci was inducted into the Louisiana American Italian Hall of Fame.

In 2022, Dellucci was inducted into the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame.

==Charity==

Dellucci has worked with several charities, such as Easter Seals, Special Olympics, Children with AIDS Foundation, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation. He is also on the Board of Directors for the Miracle League of Baton Rouge.

In 2005, after hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Dellucci formed his own charity called Catch 22 for Blue, in which he raised and personally distributed money for individuals, groups and schools which were affected by the tragedy along from Southeast Texas to Gulfport, Mississippi. He received a Commendation from the Louisiana House of Representatives and was recognized by the state Senate for his efforts. The foundation&#x27;s name was later changed to the Dream Foundation in 2008, with new goals of supporting military families, sports and education camps for developing youth, and the restoration of parks and playgrounds throughout Cleveland and the state of Louisiana.

==Personal life==
Dellucci is married to &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; model Rachel Reynolds and has appeared on four episodes of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; with her; the first was for an engagement episode in 2010 in which he modeled a tuxedo, the second announcing the couple&#x27;s first pregnancy on September 24, 2012, and the third in February 2018 for Valentine&#x27;s Day. The couple welcomed their first child, Ruby Rey, on February 13, 2013, right on their third wedding anniversary. On June 6, 2023, the family appeared on &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, commemorating Rachel&#x27;s 20th anniversary on the popular game show.

<doc id="1333236" wikidata="Q726208" url="?curid=1333236" title="Ray Nitschke">
<text>Raymond Ernest Nitschke (December 29, 1936 – March 8, 1998) was an American professional football player who spent his entire 15-year career as a linebacker in the National Football League (NFL) with the Green Bay Packers. Enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in , he was the anchor of the defense for head coach Vince Lombardi in the 1960s, leading the Packers to five NFL championships and victories in the first two Super Bowls.

==Early life==
Nitschke was born in Elmwood Park, Illinois, the youngest of three sons to Robert and Anna Nitschke. His father was killed in a car accident in 1940, and his mother died of a blood clot when Ray was 13. Older brothers Robert Jr. (age 21) and Richard (age 17) decided they would raise Ray on their own.

Nitschke entered Proviso Township High School in Maywood shortly before his mother&#x27;s death. The loss of both parents enraged Nitschke, and the lack of a parental disciplinarian to quell his rage caused him to engage in fights with other kids in the neighborhood. During his freshman year at Proviso, he played fullback on one of the school&#x27;s three football teams. He was a poor student and his grades eventually caught up with him as he was declared academically ineligible to play sports his sophomore year. He would lament this embarrassment for the rest of his life.

He succeeded in raising his grades enough in his sophomore year to allow him to play sports his junior year, when he had grown significantly (to six feet tall). He starred on the varsity football team, playing quarterback on offense and safety on defense for coach Andy Puplis. He played varsity basketball and was a pitcher and left fielder for the varsity baseball team. His baseball skills brought him an offer from the professional St. Louis Browns with a $3,000 signing bonus. Nitschke was also offered scholarships from college football programs around the country. Puplis advised him to accept a football scholarship. Wanting to play at a Big Ten university, with a chance to appear in the Rose Bowl, he accepted a football scholarship to the University of Illinois in 1954.

==College career==
While at Illinois, Nitschke smoked, drank heavily, and fought at the drop of a hat. Never a good student in high school, his grades suffered at college. In his sophomore year in 1955, due to a depletion of players in the offensive backfield, Illini head coach Ray Eliot moved Nitschke from quarterback to fullback, shattering his childhood dream of quarterbacking a team to a victory in the Rose Bowl. At this time, college football had reverted to primarily single-platoon football, meaning those players that were on offense had to switch to defense, and vice versa, when ball possession changed. On defense, Nitschke played linebacker. He proved to be a very skilled player and tackler as a linebacker, so much so that, by his senior year, Paul Brown considered him the best linebacker in college football.

In his junior year in 1956 Nitschke lost his four front teeth on the opening kick-off against Ohio State. Nitschke never wore a face mask and one of the Buckeye&#x27;s player&#x27;s helmets hit him in the mouth knocking out two teeth initially; the other two were hanging by the roots. He played the rest of the game.

==Professional career==
Growing up in the outskirts of Chicago, Nitschke had idolized the Bears and he hoped to be chosen by them in the 1958 NFL draft, held on December 2, 1957. However, he was chosen by the Green Bay Packers late in the third round (36th overall) of what is considered the greatest draft in the franchise&#x27;s history. It included three other significant Packers of the 1960s, linebacker Dan Currie of Michigan State (3rd overall), fullback Jim Taylor of LSU (15th overall) and right guard Jerry Kramer of Idaho (39th overall). Their rookie season in 1958 under first-year head coach Ray &quot;Scooter&quot; McLean was dismal, with just one win and one tie for the worst record in the 12-team league. Nitschke wore number 33 in 1958 and 66 the rest of his career with the Packers.
A month after the 1958 season ended, Vince Lombardi was hired as head coach. Nitschke became a full-time starter in 1962, the anchor of a disciplined defense that helped win five NFL titles and the first two Super Bowls in the 1960s. He was the MVP of the 1962 NFL Championship Game, accepting the prize of a 1963 Chevrolet Corvette. In the game, Nitschke recovered two fumbles and deflected a pass that was intercepted. The Packers won and finished the season with a In Super Bowl I, Nitschke contributed six tackles and a sack. In Super Bowl II, Nitschke led Green Bay&#x27;s defense with nine tackles.

Nitschke remained a starter through the 1970 season, but in 1971 he was benched by new coach Dan Devine and became a reserve to Jim Carter. At the end of the 1972 season, the Packers traveled to New Orleans to play the Saints on December 17 at Tulane Stadium, which turned out to be Nitschke&#x27;s last regular season game. He recorded the only pass reception of his career, a 34-yard gain after a blocked Packer field goal attempt, and they won to finish , their best regular season record Green Bay had clinched the NFC Central division title the week before at Minnesota for their first playoff berth in In the divisional round of the playoffs on Christmas Eve, Green Bay lost Nitschke returned for a 16th training camp in 1973, then retired in 

Nitschke was known for his strength and toughness, exhibited prior to his third season in 1960. On the Packers&#x27; practice field on September 1, a steel coaching tower was blown over by a strong gust of wind, on top 
(It was erroneously first reported as Lombardi ran over to see what had happened, but when told it had fallen on Nitschke, said, &quot;He&#x27;ll be fine. Get back to work!&quot; According to Nitschke&#x27;s biography, a spike was driven into his helmet, but did not injure him. The helmet (with the hole) is currently on display in the Packer Hall of Fame in Green Bay. Although Nitschke was known for his hard hitting, he was an athletic all-around linebacker who also intercepted 25 passes over his career.

==Personal life==
Nitschke was married on June 26, 1961, to Jackie Forchette. Jackie was unable to have children, so they adopted three: John in 1963, Richard in 1966, and Amy in 1972. Ray and Jackie had a winter home in Naples, Florida. Lombardi gave partial credit for Nitschke&#x27;s success to Nitschke&#x27;s wife, whose calming influence helped Ray focus on his career. Nitschke remained popular in Green Bay after retiring, even having his phone number and home address published in the Green Bay phone book.

In 1973, &quot;Mean on Sunday: The Autobiography of Ray Nitschke&quot; (&quot;as told to Robert W. Wells&quot;) was published by Doubleday. The review in &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; concluded, &quot;This lacks the wider appeal of, say, an &quot;Instant Replay&quot; and it&#x27;s antithetical to the juicy &quot;Ball Four&quot; genre. But Packer fans and others around the league who admired Nitschke&#x27;s professional skills might pick this up as a reminder of the man beneath the armor.&quot;

In the late 1980s, Nitschke owned an automobile dealership in Green Bay. He performed several of his own TV commercials in which he brought out his dog, &quot;Butkus&quot;, named in honor of his Chicago Bears nemesis, Dick Butkus (who like Nitschke, grew up in the Chicago area and played for the Illinois Fighting Illini). He appeared in the comic film &quot;Head&quot;, starring The Monkees, as a football player who repeatedly tackles Peter Tork in a mock war movie sequence. His character is listed in the credits as &quot;Private One&quot; because his jersey is emblazoned with the number &quot;1&quot;. Nitschke also appeared in the 1974 football comedy &quot;The Longest Yard&quot; as Guard Bogdanski.

Nitschke died of a heart attack in Venice, Florida at the age of 61 in 1998. He had been driving to the home of a family friend, according to his daughter, Amy Klaas, who was with him when he was stricken. He was pronounced dead at Venice Hospital.

==Honors==

His No. 66 was retired in 1983, the fourth of six numbers retired by the Packers. The only other Lombardi-era player to have his number retired is quarterback Bart Starr, whose number 15 was retired in 1973. Also, the team has named one of its two outdoor practice fields &quot;Ray Nitschke Field&quot;. Prior to its retirement, number 66 had remained in circulation and was last worn in 1983 by offensive lineman Lawrence Pfohl, who would go on to fame as a professional wrestler under the ring name Lex Luger.

In 1969, he was named the NFL&#x27;s all-time top Linebacker by the NFL in honor of the NFL&#x27;s 50th Anniversary. Thus he is the only linebacker to have made both the NFL&#x27;s 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams.

He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1978. Every year, the Pro Football Hall of Fame has a luncheon the day before its induction ceremony, attended by most of the living members and honoring the new inductees. Nitschke always spoke at this luncheon, telling the new inductees what a great honor they were receiving, and that they were now members of the greatest team of them all. Following his death, the Hall named the luncheon after him. He was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1981. He was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in 1978.

Upon the election of former teammate Henry Jordan to the Pro Football Hall of Fame on the eve of Super Bowl XXIX in Miami Gardens, Florida, Nitschke flew down to Florida to participate in the game&#x27;s coin-toss ceremonies, joining three other 75th Anniversary Team representatives--Otto Graham (1950s), Mean Joe Greene (1970s) and Gale Sayers (1960s), all three of whom had been announced as representatives of their respective decades in the ceremony months prior to the PFHOF election—as well as three of Jordan&#x27;s fellow Class of 1995 newcomers, all of whom represented the 1980s: Kellen Winslow, Lee Roy Selmon, and then-U.S. Congressman Steve Largent, who ended the pregame ceremonies by flipping the coin.

In 1999, he was ranked number 18 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Football Players, making him the highest-ranked player coached by Vince Lombardi, second among Packers behind Don Hutson, and third among linebackers behind Lawrence Taylor and Dick Butkus.

The Ray Nitschke Memorial Bridge, a twin-leaf bascule bridge over the Fox River on Main Street (US 141) in Green Bay, was named in honor of Nitschke. The bridge was constructed in 1998 to replace the former Main Street Bridge built in 1923.

<doc id="1333246" wikidata="Q21492205" url="?curid=1333246" title="Gilchrist (surname)">
<text>Gilchrist is a surname of Gaelic language origins. In many cases it is derived from a Scottish Gaelic name, &quot;Gille Chrìost&quot;, &quot;Gille Chriosd&quot;, meaning &quot;servant of Christ&quot; (i.e. &quot;gilla&quot; &quot;servant&quot;, &quot;chriosd&quot; &quot;Christ&quot;). Surnames of similar origins include MacGilchrist and McGilchrist, which are usually derived from &quot;Mac Giolla Chriosd&quot; or, literally, &quot;son of the servant of Christ&quot;. Early, semi-anglicised versions of the surname, recorded include Geilchreist, Gilchryst, Gillchreist, Gillcryst, Mcillchreist and Mylchrest.

In Orkneyinga saga, chapter 63, Haraldr Gilli Magnússon, king of Norway from 1130–1136, is first introduced under the name of Gilli-kristr, obviously a Norse version of Gilchrist.

In many, perhaps most, cases, people with these surnames are descendants of the Scottish Clan Gilchrist, a sept of Clan MacLachlan.

<doc id="1333249" wikidata="Q5579194" url="?curid=1333249" title="Golden Beach (Hong Kong)">
<text>Golden Beach () is located at miles of Castle Peak Road in So Kwun Wat, New Territories, Hong Kong. It is contiguous with the adjacent Cafeteria New Beach and to its northwest. 

Golden Beach is the largest public beach in Tuen Mun District with a total area of and a length of . The water quality is usually classified as Grade 2 (Fair). Tropical trees, like coconut, and flowers of various species are planted on both sides of a promenade running parallel to the beach. Refreshment kiosks, a hotel, and a shopping centre are located adjacent to the beach.

There is a volleyball court at the beach, which is a unique feature amongst the beaches of Hong Kong. The Hong Kong national beach volleyball team occasionally practise on Golden Beach.

==History==
Golden Beach was one of the first artificial beaches constructed in Hong Kong, following the private beach at Tai Pak in Discovery Bay. It was built in 1994 using about of sand. It opened to the public in 1995, originally under the management of the Regional Council.

In 2000, management of the beach was transferred to the newly formed Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD).

==Features==

* Changing rooms and showers
* Dolphin Square
* Restaurant
* Seaside promenade
* Toilets
* Tuck shop

==Patronage==
Golden Beach is the busiest of the six gazetted beaches in Tuen Mun District. In 2016, according to the LCSD, it had an average attendance of 1,941 on weekdays, 4,438 on weekends and holidays, and 670,350 during the bathing season. This makes it one of the most well-attended beaches in Hong Kong, behind only Repulse Bay, Shek O, and Clear Water Bay Second beaches.

==Environmental issues==
===Marine refuse===
Like many other beaches in Hong Kong, Golden Beach suffers from a worsening problem with marine refuse. On occasion, vast amounts of garbage suddenly wash up on the beach. The rubbish often bears Simplified Chinese characters, leading citizens to suspect that it originates from Mainland Chinese ships. On 1 August 2017, more than 18 lorry-loads worth of rubbish washed up on the beach in one 24-hour period.

===Sand loss===

The beach suffers from serious loss of sand, and has shrunk significantly over the past two decades. The bases of several lookout towers, which were once set well back from the water line, are now exposed to the sea. In April 1999, the beach was replenished with about 7,900 cubic metres of sand.

The Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD) and Halcrow Group analysed aerial imagery taken from 2001 to 2008 and found that Golden Beach eroded by up to two metres per year, affecting its recreational value. The study found that the high rate of sand loss is driven by the fact that Golden Beach is situated oblique to the prevailing wave direction. This has caused sand to migrate north, in an anti-clockwise direction, such that the southern end of the beach has completely been eroded.

The LCSD had to close part of the beach in 2008 as the problem worsened. After Typhoon Hagupit hit Hong Kong in September 2008, the LCSD hired the CEDD to conduct remedial works at Golden Beach, at a cost of HK$7.2 million. This included replenishment of sand, construction of gabion walls, and construction of groynes. These improvements were made from 2009 to 2011. Still, Golden Beach is smaller than its original size and length.

===Water quality===
The Environmental Protection Department conducts water quality testing at Golden Beach at least three times per month, year-round. The department uses a four-point grading system to reflect water quality, where Grade 1 (Good) reflects the best quality. During the 1990s, the water quality at Golden Beach consistently ranked as Grade 3 (Poor). Various sewerage infrastructure improvements have helped boost the quality to an average of Grade 2 (Fair) since the turn of the millennium.

During the 2016 swimming season, the water quality ranked Grade 2 (Fair) for about 85 per cent of tests, and Grade 1 (Good) about 15 per cent of the time.

<doc id="1333250" wikidata="Q910459" url="?curid=1333250" title="Bury Your Dead">
<text>Bury Your Dead is an American metalcore band from Boston, Massachusetts, formed in 2001. The current lineup is guitarist Chris Towning, lead vocalist Mat Bruso, drummer Mark Castillo, and bassist Aaron Patrick. To date, they have had eight releases: one EP (&quot;Bury Your Dead&quot;), one live DVD (&quot;Alive&quot;), and six studio albums (&quot;You Had Me at Hello&quot;, &quot;Cover Your Tracks&quot;, &quot;Beauty and the Breakdown&quot;, &quot;Bury Your Dead&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Nothing Personal&quot; and &quot;Mosh N&#x27; Roll&quot;).

==History==
===&quot;You Had Me at Hello&quot; (2001–2002)===
In 2001, Bury Your Dead began as a side project of the band Hamartia featuring drummer Mark Castillo and guitarist Brendan &quot;Slim&quot; MacDonald. With the metalcore sound of Hamartia growing tiresome to both of them, they started writing less technical songs in their free time. They recruited Steve Kent to play bass, second guitarist Jesse Viens, and Joe Krewko as vocalist and began playing shows in Massachusetts and Connecticut under the name Bury Your Dead. News of their unbridled energy and destructive live show spread immediately around the East Coast hardcore scenes and the band was courted by Alveran/Eulogy.

The band recorded and released their debut album titled &quot;You Had Me at Hello&quot; in 2002, borrowed a van, then toured in support of it. After several successful tours, Bury Your Dead decided to go their separate ways. Castillo moved back to Philadelphia and began touring with Between the Buried and Me, bassist Rich Casey went back to running his own screen-printing business and MacDonald began playing guitar in the band Blood Has Been Shed.

===&quot;Cover Your Tracks&quot; (2002–2005)===
After several months had passed, Casey contacted MacDonald and expressed his interest in reforming Bury Your Dead. They rounded up some of their old lineup, with a few others to fill in, and played some shows before heading down to Florida to play the annual Gainesville Fest. After acquiring vocalist Mat Bruso, they ran into their old drummer, Mark, who was touring with Between the Buried and Me, and they discussed their desire to make Bury Your Dead a serious band again. Castillo agreed, and the band did a few short tours as well as appearances at hardcore festivals including Hellfest and The New England Metal and Hardcore Festival.

With their lineup in place Bury Your Dead was approached by Victory Records in July 2003 and they signed a deal with the label the following spring, while on tour with Walls of Jericho and Martyr AD. Bury Your Dead spent the next several months touring and when summer approached they holed up in Massachusetts and did nothing but eat, sleep, and breathe the new Bury Your Dead songs, which would comprise their Victory Records debut titled &quot;Cover Your Tracks&quot;. &quot;The whole writing process this time around was a lot different than the last&quot;, said MacDonald. &quot;We had so many ideas floating around in our heads, so we decided to shut out the outside world and do nothing but get these ideas put together into songs. Literally, for two weeks, we did nothing else but write &quot;Cover Your Tracks&quot;.&quot; They entered the studio in June 2004, choosing to record at Q-Division studios in Somerville, MA with producer Matthew Ellard. &quot;Recording with Matthew was great, he added so much to the record&quot;, noted MacDonald. &quot;It was also nice that Matthew already knew Mark from his days in Between The Buried And Me, so it was a really comfortable feeling in the studio right off the bat.&quot;

&quot;Cover Your Tracks&quot; was released October 19, 2004. The band toured heavily in support of the album and on May 10, 2005, filmed a live DVD/CD combo at Chain Reaction in Anaheim, California. The DualDisc-format release, titled &quot;Alive&quot;, hit shelves on July 12, 2005, while the band was touring with As I Lay Dying, Rob Zombie, Arch Enemy, It Dies Today and many other bands on the second-stage of that year&#x27;s Ozzfest.

On July 24, 2005, actor/rapper Will Smith and his wife Jada Pinkett Smith, who fronts Wicked Wisdom, rapped/jammed with Bury Your Dead during the last song of the band&#x27;s set at Ozzfest 2005 at the Nissan Pavilion in Bristow, Virginia.

===&quot;Beauty and the Breakdown&quot; (2006–2007)===
In July 2006 Bury Your Dead released &quot;Beauty and the Breakdown,&quot; which was produced by Jason Suecof (Trivium, God Forbid). Prior to the making of the album, Aaron &quot;Bubble&quot; Patrick replaced Casey on bass. Around this time the quintet could be found on artist Derek Hess&#x27; nationwide Strhess Tour, alongside acts like Shadows Fall, Poison the Well, and Throwdown. In the fall, Bury Your Dead participated in the 2006 Family Values Tour as well as a few co-headlining off-dates with Walls of Jericho.

In January 2007, after a tour with Killswitch Engage and Hatebreed, vocalist Mat Bruso left the band to focus on &quot;more important things like going back to school to become a teacher.&quot;

In March 2007 Michael Crafter, former vocalist of I Killed the Prom Queen and Carpathian, briefly took over vocal duties for the &quot;Don&#x27;t Call It A Comeback Tour&quot;. In May 2007 he left mid-tour and returned to Australia, citing homesickness at the time. Crafter later revealed that the &quot;chaos&quot; and &quot;psycho&quot; environment that surrounded the band contributed to his departure. He said there were &quot;crazy, big fights every night&quot; at the band&#x27;s shows, and that the band members also regularly got into fights, including with each other. The frontman added that the tense and violent gang culture that surrounded the band and their associates, who were all heavily armed, made touring &quot;awkward&quot;.

Following Crafter&#x27;s departure Bury Your Dead quickly appointed Myke Terry, previously of hardcore band Cassius, to perform vocals.

===&quot;Bury Your Dead&quot; (2008-2009)===
The band soon announced that Terry had become the permanent vocalist of Bury Your Dead. The band entered on tour with Nonpoint, Machine Head, and Hellyeah on the &quot;More Balls, More Volume, More Strength Tour&quot;. After a February 16, 2008 show on the tour, guitarist Eric Ellis was attacked and beaten by six gang members in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Ellis received 19 stitches on his head and Bury Your Dead&#x27;s tour was postponed. The scuffle reportedly occurred after the attackers held up Ellis at gunpoint and stole what was described in the police report as &quot;a bag of jewelry.&quot;

On March 18, Bury Your Dead released their self-titled album. It was the first album to feature Myke Terry on vocals. The album featured Alter Bridge guitarist Mark Tremonti, who contributed a guest solo to the track &quot;Year One&quot;.

Bury Your Dead opened up for Parkway Drive on a European Tour in the Spring of 2008. Suicide Silence &amp; To Kill also joined on the lineup.

Ellis then left the band due to &quot;medical reasons and personality differences.&quot; Later, in 2012, he was sentenced to 20 years in a federal prison for his involvement in a Jacksonville gang responsible for numerous crimes. In 2013, he released a solo album. Chris Towning, who has been filling in for several months, was announced as his replacement.

On September 24, 2008, Bury Your Dead was involved in a van accident in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Bassist Aaron Patrick was driving the vehicle, which rolled several times before ending up in a ditch. Guitarist Brendan MacDonald had reportedly undergone surgery to repair lacerations to his leg while Patrick suffered a broken arm and singer Myke Terry broke his hand. Police subsequently charged Patrick with &quot;failing to drive in a marked lane.&quot;

===&quot;It&#x27;s Nothing Personal&quot; (2009–2010)===
Prior to the May 26 release of Bury Your Dead&#x27;s fifth studio album, titled &quot;It&#x27;s Nothing Personal&quot;, on April 28 they released their new single, &quot;Hurting Not Helping&quot;, which became available over iTunes. Weeks later they released another single, &quot;Broken Body&quot;. The album has been described by some as having a more melodic feel than the band&#x27;s previous efforts and was recorded/engineered by Shane Frisby and Peter Rutcho who have worked with acts such as Widow Sunday, Hell Within, and Corpus Christi.

In support of the new album, Bury Your Dead embarked on a few nationwide tours, including Disturbed&#x27;s Music as a Weapon IV tour (along with bands like Killswitch Engage and Suicide Silence) and The Deathless Tour with Throwdown, For Today, Abacabb, and The World We Knew. A few months prior to The Deathless Tour, Patrick left Bury Your Dead. He was replaced with Chris Cain, the former guitarist of For the Fallen Dreams and Elysia.

On November 24, 2010, Mark Castillo was announced as the new drummer for Crossfade. In January 2012, Castillo left the group and joined Emmure.

===&quot;Mosh &amp; Roll&quot; and potential next album (2011–present)===
On January 17, 2011, it was announced that Myke Terry was leaving the band to pursue a solo career, as former vocalist Mat Bruso rejoined the band. In a recent interview, Terry seemed to indicate that his leaving the band was not necessarily all by choice, stating that &quot;I never thought someone who hadn&#x27;t sweat, bled, or cried with us would have the power to dictate the inner workings of our band.&quot; It was confirmed by Mediaskare Records that Mark Castillo had recorded drums for the new album, but as of their first returning show (NEHMF, April 15) Mark was noted to have left the band and Mat announced that Dustin Schoenhofer, previously of Walls of Jericho, has taken over on drums. In addition, Aaron &quot;Bubble&quot; Patrick rejoined the band to replace bassist Chris Cain, although his absence on the Over the Limit Tour with Evergreen Terrace and For the Fallen Dreams has yet to be explained. Sean Chamilian of Betrayal filled in for him. The band posted new songs on the official Mediaskare YouTube channel, entitled &quot;Slaughterhouse 5&quot;, &quot;Bluebeard&quot; and &quot;Deadeye Dick&quot; prior to the release of &quot;Mosh N&#x27; Roll&quot; on August 2, 2011.

In early 2013, it was announced that guitarist Chris Towning officially joined Devildriver as their permanent bassist. No indication has been made in regards to his current or future associations with Bury Your Dead.

In January 2016, Bury Your Dead announced that they will be playing shows in 2016, with Aaron Patrick and Mark Castillo re-joining the band.

On March 22, 2019, Bury Your Dead released a new single titled, &quot;Collateral&quot;, along with the announce of the sign with a new label, Stay Sick Recordings.

On October 11, 2019, Bury Your Dead released a new EP titled &quot;We Are Bury Your Dead&quot;. The album features 5 tracks named after Tom Cruise films.

During the band&#x27;s set at FurnaceFest 2024, vocalist Mat Bruso announced that it would be his final performance with Bury Your Dead.

<text>Cetraria islandica, also known as true Iceland lichen or Iceland moss, is an Arctic-alpine lichen whose erect or upright, leaflike habit gives it the appearance of a moss, where its name likely comes from.

==Description==

It is often of a pale chestnut color, but varies considerably, being sometimes almost entirely grayish-white; and grows to a height of from , the branches being channeled into flattened lobes with fringed edges.

=== Chemistry ===
In commerce it is a light-gray harsh cartilaginous body, almost colorless, and tastes slightly bitter. It contains about 70% of lichenin or lichen-starch, a polymeric carbohydrate compound isomeric with common starch. It also yields a peculiar modification of chlorophyll (called &quot;thallochlor&quot;), fumaric acid, lichenostearic acid, and cetraric acid (which gives it the bitter taste). It also contains lichesterinic acid and protolichesterinic acids.

==Distribution and habitat==
It grows abundantly in the mountainous regions of northern countries, and it is specially characteristic of the lava slopes and plains of the west and north of Iceland. It is found on the mountains of north Wales, northern England, Scotland and south-west Ireland. In North America its range extends through Arctic regions, from Alaska to Newfoundland, and south in the Rocky Mountains to Colorado, and to the Appalachian Mountains of New England.

==Ecology==
&quot;Cetraria islandica&quot; is a known host to the lichenicolous fungus species &quot;Lichenopeltella cetrariicola&quot;, which is known from Europe and Iceland.

==Uses==
All parts of the lichen are edible. It may be dry in winter but can be soaked. Boiling reduces the bitterness. It can be added as a thickener to milk or grains or dried and stored.

It is not in great demand, and even in Iceland it is only occasionally used to make folk medicines and in a few traditional dishes. In earlier times, it was much more widely used in breads, porridges, soups, etc. It forms a nutritious and easily digested amylaceous food, being used in place of starch in some preparations of hot chocolate. Cetraric acid or cetrarin, a white micro-crystalline powder with a bitter taste, is readily soluble in alcohol, and slightly soluble in water and ether. It has been recommended for medicinal use by alternative medicine sites, in doses of 2 to 4 grains (0.1 to 0.25 grams), as a bitter tonic and aperient. It is traditionally used to relieve chest ailments, irritation of the oral and pharyngeal mucous membranes and to suppress dry cough.

<doc id="1333302" wikidata="Q1574664" url="?curid=1333302" title="Seasons End">
<text>Seasons End is the fifth studio album by British neo-prog band Marillion, released in 1989. The album was the first to feature current lead vocalist Steve Hogarth, following the departure of former vocalist Fish in late 1988. It reached number 7 on the UK Albums Chart.

==Overview==
Following the departure of Fish, Marillion started to audition singers while writing the new album, and they eventually chose Steve Hogarth. The music for &quot;Seasons End&quot; was mostly written before Hogarth joined Marillion, and only a couple of songs on it actually have some pieces written by him, these being &quot;Easter&quot; and &quot;The Space&quot;. A number of the lyrics were written by John Helmer, who the band had commissioned before Hogarth joined. Helmer would continue to contribute lyrics throughout the 1990s. &quot;The Space&quot; was partly recycled from an unreleased song by Hogarth&#x27;s old band How We Live titled &quot;Wrapped in the Flag&quot;.

The bonus disc of the 1999 re-issue of &quot;Clutching at Straws&quot; contains a number of nascent versions of songs that would end up on &quot;Seasons End&quot; with vocals and lyrics by Fish, these demos having been produced during the writing sessions for the ill-fated fifth studio album with Fish. (A number of the lyrical concepts from these demos, such as &quot;The Voice in the Crowd&quot;, would later resurface on Fish&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors&quot;.)

The album was produced jointly by Marillion and Nick Davis (who would go on to work with Genesis and associated acts). On 28 April 1989 the band went to Outside Studios at Hook End Manor, Stoke Row, Oxfordshire to record the album.

==Singles==
As with Marillion&#x27;s previous two studio albums, three singles were released from &quot;Seasons End&quot;. The first single was &quot;Hooks in You&quot; in August 1989, followed by &quot;The Uninvited Guest&quot; in November and &quot;Easter&quot; in March 1990.

==Cover art==
Mark Wilkinson, who had designed all previous Marillion covers, had been asked to provide the artwork but declined, as the band wanted to have a landscape painting, which wasn&#x27;t his style. Wilkinson would continue to collaborate with Fish, designing the album covers for almost all his solo albums. Therefore, the album also marked a turning point in the band&#x27;s visual style, towards a more &quot;modern&quot;, photographic look created by Bill Smith Studio (including Carl Glover, who would continue working with Marillion after leaving the studio). The four square fields dominating the cover symbolise the four classical elements, earth, air, water and fire (clockwise from top left). At the same time, the cover contained some references to the past: It used the band&#x27;s original logo, which had been replaced with a &quot;modernised&quot; version on the previous album &quot;Clutching at Straws&quot; and related releases as well as on &quot;B&#x27;Sides Themselves&quot; (although the 1988 live retrospective &quot;The Thieving Magpie&quot; also used it). The feather in the &quot;desert&quot; square is a reference to the image of the &quot;magpie&quot; found on &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot; (1985) and &quot;Fugazi&quot;, the &quot;sky&quot; square contains a fragment of the &quot;Jester&#x27;s&quot; dress introduced on &quot;Script for a Jester&#x27;s Tear&quot; (1983), the chameleon in the &quot;fire&quot; square appears on &quot;Script for a Jester&#x27;s Tear&quot;, &quot;Fugazi&quot; (1984) and &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot;; the painting with the clown&#x27;s face falling into the water upside-down is taken from the &quot;Fugazi&quot; cover. Also, the vinyl version returned to the gatefold format that had been abandoned on the previous studio album.

==Lyrics==
The lyrics on &quot;Seasons End&quot;, unlike those of the two previous albums, are not tied together by a common storyline. The opener, &quot;The King of Sunset Town&quot;, in John Helmer&#x27;s original version, was about poverty; however, Hogarth modified it under the impression of the brutal oppression of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 by the Chinese government; the line &quot;And everyone assembled here / Remembers how it used to be / Before the 27th came&quot; refers to the 27th Army involved in the massacre. &quot;Easter&quot; addresses The Troubles of Northern Ireland (a topic Fish had previously explored in &quot;Forgotten Sons&quot; on 1983&#x27;s &quot;Script for a Jester&#x27;s Tear&quot;); more indirectly, this also goes for &quot;Holloway Girl&quot;, which refers to the imprisonment of Judith Ward in Holloway Prison for IRA bombings. &quot;Seasons End&quot; addresses climate change (a topic to which Marillion would return in 1998 and 2007) – the spelling of the title is intentional, referring not to the end of a season (which would be &quot;Season&#x27;s End&quot;), but the end of all seasons as a result of global warming eliminating winter altogether. &quot;Berlin&quot; describes the situation in the divided city of Berlin, where Marillion had recorded &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot;; the Berlin Wall would eventually come down just weeks after the release of &quot;Seasons End&quot;.

Regarding &quot;The Space&quot;, Steve Hogarth has said that &quot;this song kind of started life in Amsterdam. When I was quite young I saw a tram come down the road and someone had parked a car too close to the tram line. It came down the road and it just tore the side off this car because it couldn&#x27;t do anything else. It made the most fantastic noise as it did so. Fortunately there was nobody in the car and fortunately the trams in Amsterdam are very thick so I&#x27;m not sure the driver even noticed it happen. Years later when I was feeling a bit more like a rock star than I did when I saw it happen, I was thinking about my life. It occurred to me that I was a bit like that tram when I probably ripped the side of a few things I hadn&#x27;t even felt and I hadn&#x27;t slowed down either and I probably hadn&#x27;t noticed. So the words to this song came from that realization. It was one of the first songs we put together when we met in January of 1989.&quot;

==Critical reception==
Mick Wall, writing in &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, stated, &quot;Vocally and lyrically, of course, we find ourselves on new ground. Hogarth&#x27;s certainly got a voice, smooth as glass and emotive as hell. And, in common with his more famous predecessor, it&#x27;s a very un-American voice, the vowel sounds are all Queen&#x27;s English. But there the comparisons end. Steve Hogarth is no Fish clone. He&#x27;s no Peter Gabriel nor Phil Collins apologist, either. He doesn&#x27;t need to be. He&#x27;s got a voice of his own – and when you listen to it on tracks like &#x27;Easter&#x27;, and &#x27;Seasons End&#x27; or &#x27;After Me&#x27;, you can almost forget the band ever had another singer.&quot;

==Track listing==
==Formats and re-issues==
The album was originally released on CD, Cassette, vinyl LP and 12&quot; Picture Disc. &quot;After Me&quot;, the b-side of &quot;Hooks in You&quot;, was included as a bonus track on the original CD and cassette versions.
In 1997, as part of a series of Marillion&#x27;s first eight studio albums, EMI re-released &quot;Seasons End&quot; with remastered sound and a second disc containing bonus material. The bonus disc contained the extended 12&quot; version of the album&#x27;s second single, &quot;The Uninvited Guest&quot;, that single&#x27;s b-side &quot;The Bell in the Sea&quot;, the third single &quot;Easter&quot;&#x27;s b-side, &quot;The Release&quot;, and six demo versions. The remastered edition was later also made available without the bonus disc.

A new 180 gram vinyl pressing was released in February 2012 by EMI. It was identical to the original vinyl release from 1989, so &quot;After Me&quot; was not included.

<text>Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. Maven can also be used to build and manage projects written in C#, Ruby, Scala, and other languages. The Maven project is hosted by The Apache Software Foundation, where it was formerly part of the Jakarta Project.

Maven addresses two aspects of building software: how software is built and its dependencies. Unlike earlier tools like Apache Ant, it uses conventions for the build procedure. Only exceptions need to be specified. An XML file describes the software project being built, its dependencies on other external modules and components, the build order, directories, and required plug-ins. It comes with pre-defined targets for performing certain well-defined tasks such as compilation of code and its packaging. Maven dynamically downloads Java libraries and Maven plug-ins from one or more repositories such as the Maven 2 Central Repository, and stores them in a local cache. This local cache of downloaded artifacts can also be updated with artifacts created by local projects. Public repositories can also be updated.

Maven is built using a plugin-based architecture that allows it to make use of any application controllable through standard input. A C/C++ native plugin is maintained for Maven 2.

Alternative technologies like Gradle and sbt as build tools do not rely on XML, but keep the key concepts Maven introduced. With Apache Ivy, a dedicated dependency manager was developed as well that also supports Maven repositories.

Apache Maven has support for reproducible builds.

== History ==
Maven was created by Jason van Zyl in 2002 and began as a sub-project of Apache Turbine. In 2003 Maven was accepted as a top level Apache Software Foundation project.

Version history:

* &quot;Version 1&quot; - July 2004 - first critical milestone release (now at end of life).
* &quot;Version 2&quot; - October 2005 - after about six months in beta cycles (now at end of life).
* &quot;Version 3&quot; - October 2010 - remains mostly backwards compatible with Maven 2 projects. Changes included re-working core Project Builder and support for parallel builds. The re-working of the core decoupled file-based and in-memory representation and allowed add-ons to leverage non-XML based project definition files. Languages suggested include Ruby (already in private prototype by Jason van Zyl), YAML, and Groovy. The parallel build feature leverages a configurable number of cores on a multi-core machine and especially suited for large multi-module projects.
* &quot;Version 4&quot; - currently in beta development (as of May 2024).

== Syntax ==
Maven projects are configured using a Project Object Model (POM) in a codice_1 file.

Example file:
&lt;project&gt;
 &lt;!-- model version is always 4.0.0 for Maven 2.x POMs --&gt;
 &lt;modelVersion&gt;4.0.0&lt;/modelVersion&gt;
 &lt;!-- project coordinates, i.e. a group of values which uniquely identify this project --&gt;
 &lt;groupId&gt;com.mycompany.app&lt;/groupId&gt;
 &lt;artifactId&gt;my-app&lt;/artifactId&gt;
 &lt;version&gt;1.0&lt;/version&gt;

 &lt;!-- library dependencies --&gt;
 &lt;dependencies&gt;

 &lt;!-- The coordinates of a required library.
 The scope is &#x27;test&#x27; to indicate the library
 is only used for running tests. --&gt;
 &lt;dependency&gt;
 &lt;groupId&gt;org.junit.jupiter&lt;/groupId&gt;
 &lt;artifactId&gt;junit-jupiter-engine&lt;/artifactId&gt;
 &lt;version&gt;5.9.1&lt;/version&gt;
 &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
 &lt;/dependency&gt;

 &lt;/dependencies&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;
This POM defines a unique identifier for the project (&quot;coordinates&quot;) and a single dependency on the JUnit library. However, that is already enough for building the project and running the unit tests associated with the project. Maven accomplishes this by embracing the idea of Convention over Configuration, that is, Maven provides default values for the project&#x27;s configuration.

The directory structure of a normal idiomatic Maven project has the following directory entries:

The command codice_2 will compile all the Java files, run any tests, and package the deliverable code and resources into codice_3 (assuming the artifactId is my-app and the version is 1.0.)

Using Maven, the user provides only configuration for the project, while the configurable plug-ins do the actual work of compiling the project, cleaning target directories, running unit tests, generating API documentation and so on. In general, users should not have to write plugins themselves. Contrast this with Ant and make, in which one writes imperative procedures for doing the aforementioned tasks.

== Design ==

=== Project Object Model ===
A Project Object Model (POM) provides all the configuration for a single project. General configuration covers the project&#x27;s name, its owner and its dependencies on other projects. One can also configure individual phases of the build process, which are implemented as plugins. For example, one can configure the compiler-plugin to use Java version 1.5 for compilation, or specify packaging the project even if some unit tests fail.

Larger projects should be divided into several modules, or sub-projects, each with its own POM. One can then write a root POM through which one can compile all the modules with a single command. POMs can also inherit configuration from other POMs. All POMs inherit from the Super POM by default. The Super POM provides default configuration, such as default source directories, default plugins, and so on.

=== Plug-ins ===
Most of Maven&#x27;s functionality is in plug-ins. A plugin provides a set of goals that can be executed using the command codice_4. For example, a Java project can be compiled with the compiler-plugin&#x27;s compile-goal by running codice_5.

There are Maven plugins for building, testing, source control management, running a web server, generating Eclipse project files, and much more. Plugins are introduced and configured in a &lt;plugins&gt;-section of a codice_1 file. Some basic plugins are included in every project by default, and they have sensible default settings.

However, it would be cumbersome if the archetypal build sequence of building, testing and packaging a software project required running each respective goal manually:

* codice_5
* codice_8
* codice_9

Maven&#x27;s lifecycle concept handles this issue.

Plugins are the primary way to extend Maven. Developing a Maven plugin can be done by extending the org.apache.maven.plugin.AbstractMojo class. Example code and explanation for a Maven plugin to create a cloud-based virtual machine running an application server is given in the article &quot;Automate development and management of cloud virtual machines&quot;.

=== Build lifecycles ===
The build lifecycle is a list of named &quot;phases&quot; that can be used to give order to goal execution. One of Maven&#x27;s three standard lifecycles is the &quot;default lifecycle&quot;, which includes the following phases, performed in the order listed:

* validate
* generate-sources
* process-sources
* generate-resources
* process-resources
* compile
* process-test-sources
* process-test-resources
* test-compile
* test
* package
* install
* deploy

Goals provided by plugins can be associated with different phases of the lifecycle. For example, by default, the goal codice_10 is associated with the codice_11 phase, while the goal codice_12 is associated with the codice_13 phase. When the codice_14 command is executed, Maven runs all goals associated with each of the phases up to and including the codice_13 phase. In such a case, Maven runs the codice_16 goal associated with the codice_17 phase, then codice_10, and so on until it finally runs the codice_12 goal.

Maven also has standard phases for cleaning the project and for generating a project site. If cleaning were part of the default lifecycle, the project would be cleaned every time it was built. This is clearly undesirable, so cleaning has been given its own lifecycle.

Standard lifecycles enable users new to a project the ability to accurately build, test and install every Maven project by issuing the single command codice_20. By default, Maven packages the POM file in generated JAR and WAR files. Tools like diet4j can use this information to recursively resolve and run Maven modules at run-time without requiring an &quot;uber&quot;-jar that contains all project code.

=== Dependencies ===
A central feature in Maven is dependency management. Maven&#x27;s dependency-handling mechanism is organized around a coordinate system identifying individual artifacts such as software libraries or modules. The POM example above references the JUnit coordinates as a direct dependency of the project. A project that needs, say, the Hibernate library simply has to declare Hibernate&#x27;s project coordinates in its POM. Maven will automatically download the dependency and the dependencies that Hibernate itself needs (called transitive dependencies) and store them in the user&#x27;s local repository. Maven 2 Central Repository is used by default to search for libraries, but one can configure the repositories to be used (e.g., company-private repositories) within the POM.

The fundamental difference between Maven and Ant is that Maven&#x27;s design regards all projects as having a certain structure and a set of supported task work-flows (e.g., getting resources from source control, compiling the project, unit testing, etc.). While most software projects in effect support these operations and actually do have a well-defined structure, Maven requires that this structure and the operation implementation details be defined in the POM file. Thus, Maven relies on a convention on how to define projects and on the list of work-flows that are generally supported in all projects.

There are search engines such as The Central Repository Search Engine, which can be used to find out coordinates for different open-source libraries and frameworks.

Projects developed on a single machine can depend on each other through the local repository. The local repository is a simple folder structure that acts both as a cache for downloaded dependencies and as a centralized storage place for locally built artifacts. The Maven command codice_20 builds a project and places its binaries in the local repository. Then, other projects can utilize this project by specifying its coordinates in their POMs.

== Interoperability ==
Add-ons to several popular integrated development environments (IDE) targeting the Java programming language exist to provide integration of Maven with the IDE&#x27;s build mechanism and source editing tools, allowing Maven to compile projects from within the IDE, and also to set the classpath for code completion, highlighting compiler errors, etc.

Examples of popular IDEs supporting development with Maven include:

* Eclipse
* NetBeans
* IntelliJ IDEA
* JBuilder
* JDeveloper (version 11.1.2)
* MyEclipse
* Visual Studio Code

These add-ons also provide the ability to edit the POM or use the POM to determine a project&#x27;s complete set of dependencies directly within the IDE.

Some built-in features of IDEs are forfeited when the IDE no longer performs compilation. For example, Eclipse&#x27;s JDT has the ability to recompile a single Java source file after it has been edited. Many IDEs work with a flat set of projects instead of the hierarchy of folders preferred by Maven. This complicates the use of SCM systems in IDEs when using Maven.

<doc id="1333335" wikidata="Q1321906" url="?curid=1333335" title="Open problem">
<text>In science and mathematics, an open problem or an open question is a known problem which can be accurately stated, and which is assumed to have an objective and verifiable solution, but which has not yet been solved (i.e., no solution for it is known).

In the history of science, some of these supposed open problems were &quot;solved&quot; by means of showing that they were not well-defined. 
In mathematics, many open problems are concerned with the question of whether a certain definition is or is not consistent.

Two notable examples in mathematics that have been solved and &quot;closed&quot; by researchers in the late twentieth century are Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem and the four-color theorem. An important open mathematics problem solved in the early 21st century is the Poincaré conjecture.

Open problems exist in all scientific fields. 
For example, one of the most important open problems in biochemistry is the protein structure prediction problem – how to predict a protein&#x27;s structure from its sequence.

<text>St Pauls (also written St Paul&#x27;s) is an inner suburb of Bristol, England, lying just northeast of the city centre and west of the M32. It is bounded by the A38 (Stokes Croft), the B4051 (Ashley Road), the A4032 (Newfoundland Way) and the A4044 (Newfoundland Street), although the River Frome was traditionally the eastern boundary before the A4032 was constructed. St Pauls was laid out in the early 18th century as one of Bristol&#x27;s first suburbs.

==History==

In the 1870s, the Brooks Dye Works opened on the edge of St Paul&#x27;s and became a major local employer, leading to the construction of terraced houses. Together with migration to Bristol, both from overseas and within Britain, this led to St Paul&#x27;s becoming a densely populated suburb by the Victorian era.

The area was bomb damaged during World War II. Rebuilding and investment was focused on new housing estates such as Hartcliffe and Southmead rather than St Paul&#x27;s, and this contributed to a decline in the quality of the area. During the large-scale immigration of the 1950s, many people moved from Jamaica and Ireland, and settled in St Paul&#x27;s.

In 1963 St Paul&#x27;s became the focus of attention when members of the British African-Caribbean community organised the Bristol Bus Boycott to protest against the racist employment policy of the Bristol Omnibus Company which operated a colour bar, refusing employment to non-white workers as bus crews. This policy was overturned in August of that year after sixty days of protest and the action helped establish the Race Relations Act 1968.

A riot followed a police raid on the Black and White Café in St Paul&#x27;s on 2 April 1980. The St Paul&#x27;s riot started when the police entered the café, knowing that the premises was being used for drug dealing. A customer had his trousers ripped and demanded compensation, which the police refused. A crowd outside then refused to allow the police to leave, and when back-up was called a riot started. The riots were quickly blamed on race, but both white and black youths from both Irish and Jamaican backgrounds and some English fought against the police and the problems are thought to have been linked instead to poverty and perceived social injustices, predominantly the Sus law and anti-Irish feelings from IRA activity on the mainland.

In 1990, St Paul&#x27;s politician Kuomba Balogun, chairman of the Bristol West Labour Party, was reported in the &quot;Bristol Evening Post&quot; of 2 February, as saying: &quot;We make a public plea to the IRA to consider ways of strongly giving some assistance to the armed wing of the ANC in the same light as Colonel Gaddafi sought to assist in the liberation of the people of Ireland.&quot; An early day motion was presented in Parliament calling on him to be expelled from the Labour Party.

This area of the city has also suffered from gun violence, reaching a high point in the early 2000s decade when rival Jamaican Yardie and drug gangs such as the British Aggi Crew fought turf wars over territory. The drugs war between the feuding factions was extinguished following en masse arrests of members of the Yardies and the Aggi Crew, with many of the foreign drug dealers being deported back to Jamaica.

The Black and White Café was closed in March 2005, and has been demolished to make way for houses after a compulsory purchase order. Now the area is experiencing a positive urban renewal with the St Paul&#x27;s Unlimited scheme.

==Community==
St Paul&#x27;s has a large African-Caribbean population. The relative poverty of the area has created a strong community spirit which is shown in the St Pauls Carnival, similar to the Notting Hill Carnival in London. It has been run annually since 1967 except for a hiatus in 2015–2017, and by 2006 attracted an average of 40,000 people each year. The event is a vibrant parade with local primary schools and community groups joining in.

===Parks===
The main parks are St Agnes Park and St Paul&#x27;s Park, together with Portland and Brunswick squares. Other green spaces include Grosvenor Road Triangle and Dalrymple Road Park. A footbridge over the A4032 allows access to nearby Riverside Park, alongside the Frome.

==Architecture==

Many of the buildings in St Paul&#x27;s are from the Georgian period. Portland Square and St Paul&#x27;s Church (completed in 1794) are fine examples of Georgian architecture; both were designed by Daniel Hague. The church fell into disuse in 1988, and in 2005 was converted for its present role as the home of Circomedia, a circus school. Edward William Godwin (1833–1886), a famous architect, lived in Portland Square.

== Redevelopment plans ==

In May 2007, proposals were announced to build about net of homes, offices and businesses, in the St Paul&#x27;s area. The development, if approved, may include a , 40-storey, tower next to the M32 motorway as a new entrance to the city. The tower would be a similar shape to the Swiss Re &quot;gherkin&quot; tower in London.

As of October 2022, updated plans for the Dove Lane site in St Pauls were unanimously approved by Bristol City Council. The approved development includes 358 new homes, with 20% designated as affordable housing, as well as retail units and workspace.

==Politics==
St Pauls is part of the Ashley ward of Bristol City Council, along with St Agnes, St Andrews, Montpelier and St Werburghs. Ashley ward is represented by three elected councillors.

<doc id="1333386" wikidata="Q1364205" url="?curid=1333386" title="Hervey Allen">
<text>William Hervey Allen Jr. (December 8, 1889 – December 28, 1949) was an American educator, poet, and writer. He is best known for his work &quot;Anthony Adverse&quot; (made into a 1936 movie of the same name), regarded by many critics &quot;as the model and precursor of the contemporary American historical novel.&quot;

== Early life==
Allen was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on December 8, 1889, to William Hervey Allen and Helen Ebey Myers. He graduated from Shady Side Academy in 1909. He was a midshipman with the United States Navy from 1909 to 1910, and attended the United States Naval Academy from 1910 to 1911 when he was honorably discharged due to a track and field injury.

Allen received a BS in economics from the University of Pittsburgh in 1915 where he contributed to the humor magazine &quot;The Pitt Panther&quot;. While at college, he also became a member of the Sigma Chi Fraternity.

Allen served as a 2nd lieutenant in the 18th Pennsylvania Infantry on the Mexican border in 1916 during the Pancho Villa Expedition. That year he published a collection of poems, &quot;Ballads of the Border&quot;. He also served as a lieutenant, and later a company commander of Company &quot;B&quot; of the 1st Battalion, 111th Infantry Regiment of the 28th (keystone) Division, United States Army during World War I and fought in the Aisne-Marne offensive July–August 1918. He was wounded in action at Fismes in August 1918. He also taught English to French soldiers at Favernay.

==Academic career==
Allen became a Professor of English at the University of Pittsburgh. For a period of time, he taught at the Porter Military Academy in Charleston, South Carolina. He also taught English at Charleston High School which at that time, although public, was only for boys (girls went to Memminger High School.) There he met and befriended DuBose Heyward. They collaborated on a volume of poems, &quot;Carolina Chansons&quot; (1922).

In 1925, he lectured on American Literature at Columbia University. From 1926 to 1927, he was a lecturer on modern poetry at Vassar College, where he met his future wife.

== Writing career ==
He wrote &quot;Toward the Flame&quot; (1926), a nonfictional account of his experiences in the war. His book, &quot;Wampum and Old Gold&quot;, was awarded the Yale Younger Poets Prize. Allen is best known for his work &quot;Anthony Adverse&quot;. The book sold well and the royalties supported Allen and his family for the rest of his life.

Allen greatly admired Thomas Jefferson. &quot;Interest in American history and in a sort of American utopianism would characterize most of his later works.&quot; He planned a series of novels about colonial America called &quot;The Disinherited&quot;. He completed three works in the series: &quot;The Forest and the Fort&quot; (1943), &quot;Bedford Village&quot; (1944), and &quot;Toward the Morning&quot; (1948). The novels tell the story of Salathiel Albine, a frontiersman kidnapped as a boy by Shawnee Indians in the 1750s. All three works were collected and published as the &quot;City in the Dawn&quot;. Allen also wrote &quot;Israfel&quot; (1926), a biography of American writer Edgar Allan Poe.

In the 1940s, he co-edited the Rivers of America Series with Carl Carmer. Allen was a good friend of Marjory Stoneman Douglas and instigated her writing &quot;The Everglades: River of Grass&quot;. Allen was also close friends with Robert Frost and Ogden Nash.

== Personal life ==
He married Ann Andrews on June 30, 1927. The marriage to his much younger former student was viewed as somewhat scandalous, and the couple took up residence in Bermuda. They had three children: Marcia, Mary Ann and Richard.

== Death and legacy ==
Allen died at his home, called &quot;the Glades&quot;, in Coconut Grove, Florida, at the age of 60, from a heart attack, and was found by his wife. He is buried in section 3 GN 1730C in Arlington National Cemetery.

<text>Holidays in Eden is the sixth studio album by the British neo-prog band Marillion, released in 1991. Recorded at Hook End Manor in Oxfordshire and Westside Studios in London, it was the band&#x27;s second album with vocalist Steve Hogarth and the first completely written without previous lead singer Fish.

Partly due to producer Christopher Neil, many of the songs feature a mainstream pop rock sound as opposed to progressive rock of previous works, and Hogarth has described &quot;Holidays in Eden&quot; as &quot;Marillion&#x27;s &#x27;pop&#x27;est album ever&quot;. It reached number 7 in the UK Albums Chart.

==Background==
Hogarth said in 2012:

==Release==
&quot;Holidays in Eden&quot; was released in Europe on 24 June 1991 by EMI Records on CD, LP and cassette. It peaked at number 7 in the UK, spending 7 weeks in the charts, and became Marillion&#x27;s first studio album not to gain any sales certification. The album reached number 7 in the Netherlands and number 10 in Germany.

In the U.S., &quot;Holidays in Eden&quot; was issued on 25 February 1992 by the I.R.S. Records label on CD and cassette. The American edition featured two new tracks, &quot;A Collection&quot; and &quot;How Can It Hurt&quot;, which were the B-sides of the original &quot;No One Can&quot; and &quot;Cover My Eyes (Pain and Heaven)&quot; singles, respectively. In addition, the track order was rearranged and the title for &quot;No One Can&quot; was lengthened by adding &quot;… Take You Away from Me&quot;. Finally, slightly different cover art was used, featuring the original cover overlaid with the new &quot;MAR&quot; &quot;ILL&quot; &quot;ION&quot; logo and the album title in the middle left of the cover in a straight line, rather than the original circle around the moon at the centre top.

As part of a series of Marillion&#x27;s first eight studio albums, EMI Records re-released &quot;Holidays in Eden&quot; on 23 February 1998 with 24-bit digital remastered sound and a second disc containing bonus tracks. A new 180g heavy weight vinyl pressing identical to the original 1991 edition was released in 2012.

Three singles, &quot;Cover My Eyes (Pain and Heaven)&quot;, &quot;No One Can&quot; and &quot;Dry Land&quot; were released, with the first preceding the album. &quot;Cover My Eyes (Pain and Heaven)&quot; was a re-write of Hogarth&#x27;s earlier band How We Live&#x27;s song &quot;Simon&#x27;s Car&quot;. &quot;Dry Land&quot; had previously been the title track of How We Live&#x27;s only album released in 1987. Each of the three singles were minor hits in the UK attaining Top 40 spots.

At the Marillion Weekend 2011, the band performed the entire album with a slightly revised track order (&quot;Waiting to Happen&quot; moved to the fifth spot), the two additional tracks from the US CD and two unrelated songs as encores. This was released as part of the DVD/Blu-Ray set &quot;Holidays in Zélande&quot;, but also as a standalone CD &quot;Holidays in Eden 2011&quot;.

==Cover art==
As with the previous release, &quot;Seasons End&quot;, the cover art was designed by Bill Smith Studio using a monochromatic painting by illustrator Sarah Ball showing various stylised animals, a tree with a snake around it at the centre, and dominated by a darkish blue colour for the front cover. &quot;Holidays in Eden&quot; was Marillion&#x27;s first album not to feature their original logo in any recognisable form, using the band name in a normal typeface instead.

<text>Tubas (; , &quot;Tûbâs&quot;) is a Palestinian city in the northeastern West Bank, located northeast of Nablus, west of the Jordan Valley. A city of over 21,000 inhabitants, it serves as the economic and administrative center of the Tubas Governorate of the State of Palestine. Its urban area consists of 2,271 dunams (227 hectares). It is governed by a municipal council of 15 members and most of its working inhabitants are employed in agriculture or public services.

Tubas has been identified as the ancient town of Thebez (), a Canaanite town famous for revolting against King Abimelech. In the late 19th century, during Ottoman rule in Palestine, Arab clans living in the Jordan Valley came to live in Tubas, which became a major town in the District of Nablus, particularly known for its timber and cheese making. It came under the British Mandate of Palestine in 1922, was annexed by Jordan after their capture of the town in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and then occupied by Israel since the 1967 Six-Day War. The Palestinian National Authority has had control of Tubas since the city was transferred to its jurisdiction in 1995.

==History==
===Biblical Thebez===
Edward Robinson thought Tubas to be identical with the Canaanite/Israelite town of &quot;Thebez&quot; () mentioned in the Hebrew Bible in the Book of Judges. It is the namesake of the titular woman of Thebez. Besides the Biblical story, nothing is known about Thebez before or after the revolt.

===Roman and Byzantine periods===
Archaeological remains such as cemeteries and olive presses indicate that Tubas was inhabited during the Roman period.

Eusebius mentioned Thebez being 13 Roman miles east of Neapolis (Nablus), which led to it being identified with Tubas, which is 16 km (10 mi.) east of Neapolis Nablus.

===Ottoman period===
====Late 16th century====
In 1596 it appeared in the Ottoman tax registers as &quot;Tubas&quot;, in the &quot;nahiya&quot; of Jabal Sami in the &quot;liwa&quot; of Nablus. It had a population of 41 households and 16 bachelors, all Muslim. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 33.3% on wheat, barley, summer crops, olive trees, occasional revenues, goats, beehives, and a press for olives or grapes; a total of 11,704 akçe.

====Late 19th century====
In the late 19th century, with Palestine still being Ottoman rule, groups of Arabs belonging to the Daraghmeh clan—mostly shepherds and farmers who lived in the Jordan Valley—migrated northward to the site because of its fertile ground, proximity to several springs, and its high elevation compared to the Jordan Valley and Wadi al-Far&#x27;a plain; Mount Gerizim was visible from the area. The Daraghmeh clan had lived in the Jordan Valley since the 15th century and in addition to Tubas, they founded or inhabited the nearby hamlets of Kardala, al-Farisiya, Khirbet al-Malih, Kishda, Yarza, and Ras al-Far&#x27;a. Soon after being established in Tubas, Arabs from Najd, Syria, Transjordan, Hebron and nearby Nablus came to settle in the area. During this period, Tubas became the site of clashes between the &#x27;Abd al-Hadi and Tuqan families of Nablus and suffered incursions by Bedouins from areas east of the city. The Jarrar family did not inhabit, but administered Tubas, as it was located within the &quot;nahiya&quot; (&quot;subdistrict&quot;) of Mashariq al-Jarrar.

Tubas was one of the largest villages in the District of Nablus. Most of the inhabitants resided in mud-built houses or tents in order to work on their distant lands in the Jordan Valley and to graze their sheep and goat flocks. According to traveler Herbert Rix, compared to other towns of its size in Samaria, Tubas was &quot;well-to-do&quot; and had abundant amounts of timber, which was harvested for firewood. Tubas, unlike the villages in the rest of the district, depended on livestock and not olives for income. Livestock products included cheese, clarified butter, woolen rugs, tents, ropes, and cloth bags. In 1882 a boys&#x27; school was established in the town.

In 1877, Lieutenant Kitchener of the Palestine Exploration Fund (PEF) survey team, reported uncovering an Arabic inscription buried in the wall of the village mosque recording its building and dedication. He also wrote that the villagers had paid a bribe of £100 in gold to the Pasha of Nablus to avoid their young men being conscripted into the Turkish army fighting in Crimea. He noted that they would probably have to repeat the payment.

The PEF noted that the Samaritans believed that the tomb of Asher, known locally as Nabi Tota (&quot;the good prophet&quot;), was located in Tubas. The tomb served as a shrine in local Muslim tradition.

===British Mandate===
In 1917, the British captured Palestine from the Ottomans. After rule under a military government, it was reorganized in 1922–23 Tubas was incorporated into the British Mandate of Palestine.

In the 1922 census of Palestine, Tubas had a population of 3,449 (3,441 Muslims and 7 Orthodox Christians). In the 1931 census, Tubas, (including Kashda and Jabagia) had 773 occupied houses and a population of 4,097 (4,068 Muslims and 29 Christians).

In Sami Hadawi&#x27;s 1945 statistics, a land and population survey, Tubas and nearby Bardala had a combined population of 5,530 (5,470 Muslims and 60 Christians), with 313,123 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 18,498 dunams were used for plantations and irrigable land, 98,518 dunams for cereals, while 204 dunams were built-up (urban) land.

In 1947, the United Nations drew up a partition plan to divide Palestine into Jewish and Arab states; Tubas and the surrounding villages and hamlets were to be included in the Arab state. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Fawzi al-Qawuqji led 750 Arab Liberation Army (ALA) soldiers to Tubas from Transjordan and set up base there; Tubas would serve as the ALA&#x27;s headquarters in central Palestine throughout the war.

===Jordanian annexation===
In the wake of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and after the 1949 Armistice Agreements, Tubas became a part of Jordan.

In 1955 the first girls&#x27; school was opened.

In 1961, the population was 5,709, while in 1964, Tubas alone had a population of 5,880.

===Post-1967===

Since the Six-Day War in 1967, Tubas has been under Israeli occupation.

Tubas was transferred to Palestinian National Authority (PNA) control in 1995 under the Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. During the Jordanian and Israeli periods, the city was under the administration of the Nablus Governorate, but in 1996, the PNA declared Tubas and the immediate area to be an electoral district, and later, an independent administrative area—the Tubas Governorate.

Tubas has not seen as much violence in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict as nearby Nablus and Jenin, but a number of incidents occurred during the Second Intifada, which began in 2000. In April 2002, the Israeli forces (IDF) killed six active Hamas members in the town, including Ashraf Tamza Daraghmeh—the chief Hamas commander in Tubas and the surrounding area. On August 31, 2002, an Israeli Apache helicopter fired four Hellfire missiles at a civilian car suspected of carrying a local al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades commander and a nearby home. The strike instead killed five civilians, including two children, two teenagers and a 29-year-old Fatah activist accused of being a member of the al-Aqsa Brigades. The Israeli Defense Minister, Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, issued a statement expressing &quot;regret&quot; over &quot;harming&quot; civilians in Tubas. Ben-Eliezer described the raid in Tubas as a &quot;mistake&quot;, and promised that the army would investigate the incident. On August 21, 2009, a clash between the Sawafta clan and another city clan left a member of the former dead and 38 others injured. Five homes were also burnt and Palestinian Security Forces arrested five people in connection to the death.

On 27 August 2024, the IDF invaded Tubas along with Nablus, Jenin and Tulkarm as part of their &quot;Summer Camp&quot; offensive.

==Geography==
Tubas is located in the northern West Bank with an elevation of above sea level, whereas most of the Tubas Governorate is located within the Jordan Valley to the south. In a 1945 land survey, Tubas along with nearby Bardala and Kardala consisted of 313,123 dunams (31,312 hectares) of which 220,594 was Arab-owned and the remainder being public property. , its total land area consists of 295,123 dunams (29,512 hectares), of which 2,271 is classified as built-up, roughly 150,000 used for agricultural purposes and about 180,000 has been expropriated by Israel for military bases and buffer zone.

Tubas is located to the northeast of Nablus, and west of the Jordan Valley. Nearby localities include the town of Aqqaba to the north, Tayasir and Aqabah villages to the northeast, Ras al-Far&#x27;a to the southwest, the Palestinian refugee camp of Far&#x27;a to the south and the al-Bikai&#x27;a village cluster to the southeast.

It has a moderate climate; the summer is hot and dry, and the winter is cold and wet. The average annual temperature is , and the average annual humidity rate is 56%.

==Demographics==

About 1,100 residents fled Tubas after the 1967 Six-Day War mostly to the Souf refugee camp in Jordan, while 260 immigrated there and in 1981 its population was 5,300.

In the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics&#x27; (PCBS) first official census in 1997, Tubas had a population of 11,760 inhabitants. The gender make-up was 50.8% male and 49.2% female. Tubas has an overwhelmingly young population with 52.7% of the city&#x27;s residents below the age of 20. People between the ages of 20 and 34 constitute 24.7%, 17.7% between the ages of 35 and 64, while people above the age of 64 constituted 4.9% of the population. The census also revealed that refugees made up 6.1% of the total residents.

In the 2007 census by the PCBS, Tubas had a population of 16,154, increasing around 33% from 1997. The city represents roughly a third (33.4%) of the Tubas Governorate&#x27;s total population. The city&#x27;s modern-era founders, the Daraghmeh clan, constitute 70% of Tubas&#x27; inhabitants. The clan has several smaller branches, including the Mslamany, Abd al-Razeq and Abu Khazaran families. The Sawafta family make up 25%, the Husheh make up 3% and the Fuquha represent the remaining 2%. Residents of the village trace their origins to various places, including Hebron and Nazareth (the Zuabis). Some are Bedouins.

The inhabitants of Tubas are predominantly Muslims, but there is a community of approximately 60 Palestinian Christians, all belonging to the Greek Orthodox Church. The Christian community worships at the Holy Trinity Church in the city and is serviced by a priest from nearby Zababdeh.

According to the 2017 census by the PCBS, the population of Tubas was 21,431.

==Economy==
The economical situation Tubas during the 1993–99 period was prosperous, however since the start of the Second Intifada in 2000–01, Tubas&#x27; income level has decreased by roughly 40%. Prior to the Intifada, the average household income was 2,500 NIS; it has since receded to about 1,500 NIS. A major factor that has resulted from the conflict was the confiscation of agricultural land located within the city&#x27;s or its governorate&#x27;s jurisdiction by Israeli settlements or military authorities. According to the PCBS, in 1999, approximately 52% of the citizens were within the working age (15-64). Of the city&#x27;s labor force, 48% are females. The unemployment rate increased dramatically from 20% in 1999 to 70% after the year 2000. Prior to the Intifada, 35% of the total labor force worked in Israel.

Currently, agriculture constitutes 60% of Tubas&#x27; economic activity, public services comprise 17%, trade is 10%, Israeli labor is 8%, construction and industry make-up the remaining 5%. In the city, there are 240 shops and stores, 70 service institutions and one big ready mix concrete factory 30 small ones.

The main economic sector in Tubas is agriculture. There is a total of 150,000 dunams of arable land, of which 124,450 dunams are covered by forests and 10,604 dunams cultivated. Although the land is fertile, there is a lack of water for irrigation. The only spring used is in nearby Ein Far&#x27;a. Field crops account for 49% of the cultivable land, while fruit orchards account for 40% and vegetables make-up 11%. Israeli trenches around the neighboring villages of Ras al-Ahmar and Khirbet al-&#x27;Atuf prevent access to nearly 40% of Tubas&#x27; arable lands.

Many Tubas residents keep livestock, mostly sheep; in 2005, there was a total 6,670 sheep. Other livestock owned include 96 heads of cattle, 880 goats and 126,500 poultry. In addition, 123 beehives were kept. In 2006 the Golden Sheep Dairy factory was founded in Tubas with help from UCODEP, an Italian NGO. The factory specializes in the production of Italian cheese and primarily targets cosmopolitan consumers in Ramallah, Bethlehem and Jerusalem as well as international workers and diplomats living in the West Bank.

==Government==
Tubas serves as the &quot;muhfaza&quot; (&quot;capital&quot; or &quot;seat&quot;) of the Tubas Governorate. Since 1995, Tubas has been located in Area A, giving the PNA full control over its security, administration and civilian affairs.

Tubas has been governed by a municipal council since 1953, when it was granted permission to do so by Jordanian authorities who controlled the West Bank at the time. The council is made up of 15 members including the mayor, and is headquartered in the municipal hall in the center of the town. The municipality has over 60 employees. Responsibilities of the municipality include civil administration, urban planning and development, social development services, distribution of social services, the issuing of building permits and infrastructural maintenance: water, electricity and solid waste collection.

Husam Daraghmeh was succeeded, an independent candidate, elected in the 2022 Palestinian municipal elections. During the elections, women won two seats, and though Tubas is normally a Fatah stronghold, all seats were won by independent political lists.

==Education==
In 2004–05, Tubas had twelve schools; four for males, three for females and five co-educational. There were 4,924 students and 191 teachers. In addition, six kindergartens are located in the city, and have a total of 620 pupils. In 1997, the literacy rate was 86%; females comprised 78.3% of the illiterate population. Of the literate population, 25.7% completed elementary education, 23.3% completed preparatory education and 22.1% completed secondary or higher education. Many students throughout the Jordan Valley receive their education in Tubas. The Al-Quds Open University, based in Jerusalem, has a campus in Tubas known as Al-Quds Open University-Tubas Educational Region. In 2006, 1,789 students were enrolled in the university, it had 90 professors and 24 other employees.

==Local infrastructure==
Tubas contains six mosques. The main mosques are the Abd ar-Rahan Mosque, the al-Tawled Mosque, Umar ibn al-Khattab Mosque, and Shaheed Mosque.

<text>Spider Jerusalem is a fictional character and the protagonist of the comic book &quot;Transmetropolitan&quot;, created by writer Warren Ellis and artist Darick Robertson, introduced under the now-defunct Helix imprint of DC Comics before being moved to the Vertigo imprint.

He is a sarcastic, drug-addicted, foul-mouthed, troubled, bitter, but brilliant gonzo journalist with a deep-seated hatred of authority, political corruption, and dogs. Spider is almost always drawn wearing a set of stereoscopic sunglasses with one lens red and the other green, and he is most often compared to the real-life figure Hunter S. Thompson.

IGN named him 45th of the &#x27;Top 100 Comic Book Heroes&#x27;.

==Background==
Spider is a renegade gonzo journalist forced to return to the City after having exhausted a substantial advance from a publisher without completing the books required by contract. After five years of effective retirement as a long-haired hermit at a compound in the mountains, he returns to the City to complete his books, takes up work for an urban newspaper to support his writing, and finds himself battling political corruption at the highest level.

One of Spider&#x27;s most apparent character traits is his heavy drug use, which he makes no attempt to conceal. In addition to being a chain smoker and heavy drinker, Spider uses an extensive variety of drugs ranging from mild stimulants, intellect enhancers, and mood-altering drugs to cocaine, heroin and rare, exotic, futuristic drugs. As is common in his society, Spider is resistant or immune to many forms of drug addiction, as well as lung cancer. Spider is well known for his foul language, especially when combining the word &quot;fuck&quot; with other words to make new and amusing insults. Spider is easily angered, his displays of temper ranging from mild verbal outbursts to violent physical assault, but despite his temper and contempt for the City as a whole, Spider is often seen to treat innocents (particularly children) with kindness and care.

Spider&#x27;s past is not well known, though characters like Mitchell Royce and Spider himself have referred to past memorable incidents such as the &quot;enfant terrible&quot; (a French child assassin from the Anglo/Franco war) and the Prague telephone incident (in which Spider caused six politicians to commit suicide using just a phone). There are also hints at his childhood, which seems to have been extremely turbulent—somewhere between a victim of urban blight and a child soldier—and his early ambitions—&quot;I wanted to be a sniper when I grew up. Didn&#x27;t everyone?&quot;—as well as his parents&#x27; growing madness.

He claims to have worked as a prostitute at some point in the past, and as a stripper at 8 years old. He grew up on the City&#x27;s docks with drunken parents as an only child. His father drove a city bus and his mother was a housewife who cooked lizards for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day. He returned to the docks as an adult to see that everyone was gone and the docks were abandoned, before vowing to never forget his childhood there.

==Philosophy==
Spider is a firm believer in the truth and delivering it to his readers in the most direct and blunt manner possible, often capitalising it as &quot;The Truth&quot; in his writing for emphasis. This is most notable in one story, when Spider&#x27;s editor recounts the tale of how Spider submitted an article on the election of the Richard Nixon-analogue &quot;The Beast&quot;, which consisted of the word &quot;fuck&quot; repeated eight thousand times (from &quot;Transmetropolitan&quot; #1). His approach to journalism has been encapsulated by Spider as &quot;The truth...no matter what&quot; and his appraisal of others rises if they feel the same way.

The primary focus of conflict within Spider&#x27;s psyche, over the course of the series, is a combination of concern for his delivery of &#x27;The Truth&#x27; and misanthropy towards his public. Spider hates and struggles against authority figures who oppress others, but he is also bitter toward the uninvolved public who give the authority its power. Likewise, he struggles to convince the public to listen to The Truth, but is disgusted by those who blindly accept what he reports. In addition, Spider&#x27;s talents earn him unwanted fame and adoration, which clouds his ability to &quot;get at The Truth&quot;, often resulting in him experiencing writer&#x27;s block and depression. His editor, Mitchell Royce, opines that Spider needs to be hated in order to function as a writer and journalist.

Despite his absolute disdain for those around him, Spider is quite loyal to those few who he considers friends and is equally quick to hurt those who would betray him. Indeed, much of Spider&#x27;s motivation in the second half of the series was dedicated to bringing the President to justice for ordering the murder of Vita Severn, whom Spider had befriended.

Although he opposed The Beast, Spider is not loyal to any political party or organization, and his initial support of The Smiler was tinged with contempt at his cynical attitude and false altruism. He is also an avowed, often virulent atheist who opposes all organized religion, which he sees as little more than unworthy authority figures that exploit their members.

==Weapons==
Spider proudly claims to be &quot;always armed&quot;, and is shown with several firearms, at least one of which, called &quot;The Upper Hand&quot;, can blow up a vehicle. He has also possessed a rocket launcher, which he used to blow up a bar at the base of his mountain home. He was accidentally given a bandolier of grenades at a party, which he took as a sign that &quot;There is a God&quot;.

Spider&#x27;s weapon of choice for most of the series is a &quot;bowel disruptor&quot;, which causes instant and painful loss of bowel control, with settings that allow him to vary the level of pain and discomfort, ranging from simple loose, watery diarrhea to complete rectal prolapse. Most of the time the victim has a bowel movement so dramatic and agonizing that it induces unconsciousness. At least three times it is revealed through dialogue that the gun can be set to &#x27;Fatal Intestinal Maelstrom&#x27;. Spider prefers this weapon because, despite being illegal, it is (usually) non-lethal and its effects are untraceable. His assistants, Channon and Yelena, have also been armed with bowel disruptors during &quot;The Cure&quot; arc.

On a few occasions, he has been known to carry lethal firearms, though according to Spider, he only carries such weapons in emergency cases. He has, in at least one case, used a handgun to kill two would-be assassins (a third was beaten to death). In issue #38, he is revealed to be a competent gunfighter, having learned his skills in &quot;places you never want to go&quot;. It is also revealed in issue #38 that he has killed sixteen people, all but one in self-defence; he never specifies how or why (although it could be inferred that he means Vita Severn, as Spider feels responsible for her death).

Regardless of whether or not he is armed, Spider is shown to be a surprisingly capable, though not invincible, fighter. He frequently lashes out violently at those who threaten or aggravate him, and his ferocity often allows him to defeat opponents who are well-trained or much more imposing physically. He is also not averse to brutalizing people in order to get crucial information (as is shown in his Year Five assault on Fred Christ). Like Channon, he had also gained experience in firearms while in school, though unlike Channon, he and his classmates had had to &quot;make&quot; their own arms—to prevent the teachers having an unfair advantage. He often uses improvised weapons to gain the upper hand—for example, putting his cigarette out in the eye of a guard or beating Fred Christ with a broken chair leg, which he dubbed &quot;The Chair Leg of Truth&quot;.

==Appearance==
Initially, Spider is shown with a huge amount of muddy brown, shaggy hair and a long unkempt beard, claiming he has hair in places that his once and future editor/friend Mitchell Royce doesn&#x27;t even know he owns. On his return to the City, nearly all his hair is removed by a malfunctioning cleaning unit in his first apartment&#x27;s bathroom. For the rest of the series, he is portrayed as virtually hairless, the exception being his eyebrows and a small amount of pubic hair. Spider is a small, slight figure with a long nose and slightly crooked teeth. His body is covered with black tattoos, combining geometric tribal designs and other more Western images (his right buttock is marked &quot;kiss here&quot;), including a small spider on his upper forehead. He is also said to have a tattoo on his penis, though this is never shown.

Although he prefers not to wear clothes much of the time, when in public his primary mode of dress is typically a &quot;black linen suit, urban weight, generous cut&quot; (jacket and pants, no shirt under the jacket) with a pair of heavy black leather boots, although during the winter he is sometimes seen wearing a black jumper under his jacket; also, on the rare occasions when modesty is required of him he will wear knee-length boxer shorts. He also wears a pair of &#x27;live-shades&#x27;, sunglasses with built-in still-photography capabilities; the right lens is green and rectangular, whilst the left one is red and circular (the AI that created them was on drugs at the time). The first pair he owns have gold rims around the lenses, while the ones he obtains during the second part of the &quot;Dirge&quot; arc have no rims. This appearance, and the comic&#x27;s futuristic setting, has made Spider Jerusalem a cult (albeit fictional) character among rivet heads, in a similar manner to Tank Girl.

==Influences==
Spider Jerusalem is reminiscent of previous &quot;muck-raking&quot; or &quot;Gonzo&quot; journalists such as H. L. Mencken and Hunter S. Thompson.

Hunter S. Thompson is perhaps the most obvious inspiration for the character of Spider Jerusalem, and the fictional reporter&#x27;s fondness for weaponry and spectacular consumption of drugs both indicate a resemblance toward the American gonzo journalist. In &quot;Transmetropolitan&quot; #13, page 5, a book by Thompson is clearly visible amongst the objects strewn across the table in Spider&#x27;s apartment. A book entitled &quot;FEAR AND LOATHING&quot; is also visible in Issue #1, Page 1, Panel 3, in the lower left-hand corner of the panel.

Visually, Spider Jerusalem is based on Darick Robertson&#x27;s friend Andre Ricciardi.

==&quot;Planetary&quot;==
One of Ellis&#x27;s other titles, &quot;Planetary&quot;, features a character in its seventh issue named Jack Carter, who is a thinly-veiled pastiche of John Constantine, being essentially identical in appearance, role, abilities and diction. The issue is essentially a retrospective commentary on the genre of grim, British-penned comics of the anti-Thatcherite 1980s milieu, of which the Carter character is positioned as the apotheosis. Having faked his own death, Carter reappears in a dramatically altered form with a shaved head and long black coat which he later opens to reveal a bare chest featuring identical tattoos to Spider Jerusalem. Lacking only the spider tattoo on the head and the trademark shades, this former Constantine-cipher has become the spitting image of Jerusalem and departs with the words: &quot;The Eighties are long over. Time to Move on. Time to be someone else&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Wizard&quot; magazine ranked Spider Jerusalem as the 38th-greatest comic book character of all time. Spider Jerusalem was also ranked as the 12th-greatest comic book character of all time by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine quoting that &quot;Spider is a true one-off, a character so fearless and vibrant and nonchalantly cool that Patrick Stewart is his biggest fan. And if that&#x27;s not a recommendation, we don&#x27;t know what is&quot;. IGN also ranked Spider Jerusalem as the 45th-greatest comic book hero of all time stating that Spider Jerusalem isn&#x27;t quite a role model for the kids but over the course of the series&#x27; long life, readers came to know the true Spider Jerusalem and revel in his ultimate victory.

<doc id="1333436" wikidata="Q5024291" url="?curid=1333436" title="Calves, Portugal">
<text>Calves is a hamlet in Póvoa de Varzim, Portugal. It is divided between the parishes of Argivai and Beiriz and in the 2001 census it had 138 inhabitants.

==Tapetes de Beiriz==
The factory of (&quot;Beiriz Carpets&quot;) is also located there. The operation began in the early 20th century as an idea from Hilda d&#x27;Almeida Brandão Rodrigues Miranda, a Portuguese-Brazilian (1892 in Salvador da Bahia – 1949 in Beiriz), who built a small workshop and later a factory together with an assistant, Rita Conceição. They invented the (&quot;Beiriz knot&quot;).

==Countryside estates==
Calves is noted as a beauty spot for its countryside estates (), namely Quinta de Calves and Quinta de Beiriz. Santa Clara Aqueduct is located in Calves.

Quinta de Beiriz is the more notable of the estates. It is a beauty spot realised by Alfredo de Almeida Brandão, a diplomat and a lover of fine arts. The estate includes gardens with two lakes and a park covered by trees, water fountains and mythical statues in the style of André Le Nôtre. The small manor house on the estate was built at the beginning of the 20th century, but several buildings date from the 18th.

In 1956, the chapel was practically destroyed due to vandalism and the woodcarvings were sold, as the owners feared robbery. From 1972, the public rooms and D. Hilda Chapel underwent improvement with Portuguese-Baroque woodcarving, to imitate the 16th- and 17th-century sanctuaries of the Minho region. Azulejos include hunting and countryside motifs. The chapel was reconsecrated in 1993.</text><links>

<text>The Pentagon&#x27;s New Map: War and Peace in the Twenty-First Century is a 2004 book by Thomas P.M. Barnett based around an earlier article he wrote for &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine. It outlines a new grand strategy for American foreign policy. It is an iteration of a PowerPoint presentation that Barnett has been making for years that is known simply as &quot;The Brief.&quot; Interested parties include the public and private sectors, encompassing military organizations and foreign governments.

At least two versions of Barnett&#x27;s presentation have aired on C-SPAN as of 2005. In December 2004, the network broadcast one of Barnett&#x27;s recent presentations followed with a live call-in program in which Barnett discussed his book and its effects. See the article on Barnett for an outline of his ideas.

Barnett was asked by the United States Air Force to give the presentation to every new officer who attained the rank of general.

In late 2004, Barnett&#x27;s employer (the Naval War College) gave him the choice of either writing the second book or retaining his job. He chose the former, and wrote Blueprint for Action: A Future Worth Creating. Barnett also continues to write articles as a contributing editor at Esquire and consult on global security issues as a senior managing director at Enterra Solutions. He is currently in the planning stages of a third book on Resiliency with co-author Stephen DeAngelis, founder of Enterra Solutions.

==Key ideas==
# Systems of rules called Rule-sets reduce violent conflict. Violence decreases as rules are established (e.g., the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding) for dealing with international conflicts.
# The world can be roughly divided into two groups: the Functioning Core, characterized by economic interdependence, and the Non-Integrated Gap, characterized by unstable leadership and absence from international trade. The Core can be sub-divided into Old Core (North America, Europe, Japan, Australia) and New Core (China, India, South Africa, Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Russia). The Disconnected Gap includes the Middle East, South Asia (except India), most of Africa, Southeast Asia, and northwest South America.
# Integration of the Gap countries into the global economy will provide opportunities for individuals living in the Gap to improve their lives, thereby presenting a desirable alternative to violence and terrorism. The US military is the only force capable of providing the military support to facilitate this integration by serving as the last-ditch rule-enforcer. Barnett argues that it has been doing so for over 20 years by &quot;exporting&quot; security (US spends about half of the world&#x27;s total in military spending).
# To be successful the US military must stop thinking of war in the context of war but war in the context of &quot;everything else&quot;, i.e. demographics, energy, investment, security, politics, trade, immigration, etc.
# In recognition of its dual role, the US military should organize itself according to two functions, the &quot;Leviathan&quot; and the &quot;System Administrator.&quot;
#* Leviathan&#x27;s purpose is the use of overwhelming force in order to end violence quickly. It will take out governments, defend Core countries, and generally do the deterrence work that the US military has been doing since the end of WWII. The Leviathan force is primarily staffed by young aggressive personnel and is overwhelmingly American. 
#* The SysAdmin&#x27;s purpose is to wage peace: peacekeeping, nation building, strengthening weak governments, etc. The SysAdmin force is primarily staffed by older, more experienced personnel, though not entirely (he would put the Marines in SysAdmin as the &quot; Mini-me Leviathan&quot;). The sys Admin force would work best as a Core-wide phenomenon.
# By exporting security, the US and the rest of the Core benefit from increased trade, increased international investment, and other benefits.

<text>The 1794 Greater Poland Uprising (Polish: &quot;Powstanie wielkopolskie 1794 roku&quot;) was a military insurrection by Poles in Wielkopolska (Greater Poland) against Kingdom of Prussia which had taken possession of this territory after the 1793 Second Partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

== Origins ==
The outbreak of Kościuszko Uprising in central Poland in March 1794 served as the spark for the formation of Polish military units in the Prussian partition, as Poles in Wielkopolska hoped to liberate their region. Initially, Tadeusz Kościuszko, who had initiated the fight against Russians in central Poland did not want to support the Greater Poland Uprising in the hope of avoiding a two front war (at the time, Kingdom of Prussia was nominally in an alliance with Poland against Russia). As a result, the planned insurrection in Wielkopolska almost ended before it could start. However, the situation changed in June 1794 when the Prussians declared their support for Tsarist Russia and offered them military support in suppressing Kościuszko (after his victory at the Battle of Racławice). As a result, the Supreme National Council issued a proclamation &quot;To the Citizens of Greater Poland&quot; calling them to arms.

The initial center of the uprising was the Kujawy region. The command was given to Józef Niemojewski, although many of the units in the field operated independently. Initial clashes took place on 20 August. On 22 August the insurrectionists took Gniezno and General Paweł Skórzewski took Konin and other towns in the area soon after. As a result, the King of Prussia, Frederick William II was forced to withdraw some of his forces from central Poland which were besieging Warsaw.

A Polish corps under Jan Henryk Dąbrowski captured Bydgoszcz on 2 October and entered Pomerania almost unopposed. Dąbrowski planned to winter in Bydgoszcz and then move through Toruń, but because of Kościuszko&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Maciejowice he decided instead to evacuate Wielkopolska and make his way into central Poland. Although thanks to the mobility of his forces he evaded being encircled by a much less mobile Prussian army, the Prussians recaptured most of the gains made by the insurrectionists in the previous few months.

Dąbrowski unsuccessfully tried to convince Kościuszko&#x27;s successor, Tomasz Wawrzecki to move the insurrection from central Poland to the Prussian partition. On 17 November 1794, the last Polish units in central Poland capitulated to the Russians at Radoszyce. In Wielkopolska sporadic guerrilla fighting continued until mid-December. The uprising almost got a second life when a hero of the fighting in Warsaw and one of Kościuszko&#x27;s colonels, the shoemaker Jan Kiliński (who had been born in Trzemeszno), arrived in Wielkopolska to try to reorganize the Polish forces. However, he was soon captured by the Prussians and handed over to the Russians.

With the end of the uprising, Dąbrowski was offered commissions in the Russian and Prussian armies but turned these down and emigrated abroad. He went on to organize the Polish Legions in Italy which fought alongside Napoleon in subsequent wars. Niemojewski also emigrated to France and served in Napoleon&#x27;s army where he eventually attained the rank of Brigadier General.

<text>Earth (stylised as &quot;earth&quot;) is the first official solo album by the Greek artist Vangelis, released in 1973. In contrast to &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; (1975) and some soundtracks by Vangelis from this period, &quot;Earth&quot; was not released on compact disc in the 1980s — it was not until 1996 that a CD version was made available, and then only in Greece.

The album was promoted by a concert, held in Paris, at the Olympia Theatre in February 1974.

In 1974 two left-over tracks from the recording sessions for &quot;Earth&quot; were issued as a single, on the WWA label: &quot;Who&quot;, written by Fitoussi and Dassin on the A-side and featuring vocals by the former, and the instrumental &quot;Sad Face&quot;, by Vangelis himself, on the B-side.

==Instruments==
Vangelis plays keyboards (Hammond L100 organ, Elka Tornado reed organ, Selmer Clavioline), percussion, various ethnic instruments (flute, tabla) and provides background vocals. Most of the synthetic organic sounds on the album came from his Hammond L100 Organ put through a Binson Echorec and some other effects. Collaborating artists are Vangelis&#x27; former Aphrodite&#x27;s Child bandmate Anargyros Koulouris (guitars, background vocals, and lute) and Robert Fitoussi (bass guitar and lead vocals on tracks 1, 4, 6, and 8). The latter became better known in the 1980s as &quot;F. R. David&quot; when he recorded the hit single &quot;Words (Don&#x27;t Come Easy)&quot;. Warren Shapovitch provided the narration on the tracks &quot;We Were All Uprooted&quot; and &quot;A Song&quot;.

<doc id="1333461" wikidata="Q2438814" url="?curid=1333461" title="Togwotee Pass">
<text>Togwotee Pass (pronounced TOH-guh-tee) is a high mountain pass in the western United States, at an elevation of above sea level. On the Continental Divide in the Absaroka Mountains of northwestern Wyoming in Teton County, it is between Dubois and Moran Junction in the Jackson Hole valley.

U.S. Highways 287 and 26 traverse the pass, which is approximately east of Moran Junction. The pass provides the most direct access to Grand Teton National Park from eastern Wyoming. Located between Two Ocean Mountain and Breccia Peak, sweeping vistas of the Teton Range are visible from the western slopes of the pass. A ski run (mainly a traverse) at the Jackson Hole ski resort is also named Togwotee Pass. 
Located in the Bridger-Teton National Forest and adjacent to Shoshone National Forest, the pass receives heavy winter snowfall and is a top destination for snowmobiling, backcountry skiing and cross-country skiing. Annual snowfall at the pass often exceeds (reports of over of snow are also known) in any given winter and the road can be shut down for days at a time during blizzards. The Continental Divide Snowmobile Trail passes through the immediate area.

== History ==
The pass is named for Togwotee, a subchief under Chief Washakie of the Sheepeater tribe, a branch of the Shoshones. Togwotee led The Jones Expedition over this pass in 1873.
Before the expedition, the pass was reported to be an important trade route for native tribes. 

==Climate==

According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Togwotee Pass has a dry-summer subarctic climate, abbreviated &quot;Dsc&quot; on climate maps. The hottest temperature recorded at Togwotee Pass was on June 24, 1988 and July 13, 2002, while the coldest temperature recorded was on December 23, 1983.

<doc id="1333462" wikidata="Q7574391" url="?curid=1333462" title="Spearman's hypothesis">
<text>Spearman&#x27;s hypothesis has two formulations. The original formulation was that the magnitudes of the black-white differences on tests of cognitive ability positively correlate with the tests&#x27; g-loading. The subsequent formulation was that the magnitude of the black-white difference on tests of cognitive ability is entirely or mainly a function of the extent to which a test measures general mental ability, or &quot;g&quot;.

Spearman&#x27;s hypothesis has been criticized on methodological and empirical grounds. It has also been used to support scientific racism.

== Description ==
The hypothesis, first formalized by Arthur Jensen in the 1980s based on Charles Spearman&#x27;s earlier comments on the topic, stated that the magnitude of the differences is directly related to the magnitude of the g-loadings of a test. Jensen devised the &quot;method of correlated vectors&quot; (MCV) to study this hypothesis and published his research in his paper, &quot;The nature of the black–white difference on various psychometric tests: Spearman&#x27;s hypothesis&quot;, a paper which elicited 29 comments from experts in the field. Jensen went on to argue that the finding of a positive correlation between group differences and g-loadings would support the hypothesis that the group differences were largely in general mental ability—the later formulation of Spearman&#x27;s hypothesis. The validity of this inference has been much debated.

== Related hypotheses ==
===Group differences===
Closely related to Spearman&#x27;s hypothesis is the hypothesis that the magnitude of certain group differences correlates with within-group heritability estimates. Arthur Jensen and J. Phillippe Rushton, for example, reported in 2010 that the found psychometric meta-analytic correlation between g-loadings and heritability estimates was 1. 

The international data, though, has challenged this finding: a study from Japan published in 2014 did find a correlation between g-loading and heritability, but only a third of that found by Jensen &amp; Rushton; one from 2015 covering Korea that found no clear link between heritability and g-loadings of IQ subtests; and one from 2016 by Voronin, Te Nijenhuis, and Malykh found negative correlations between g-loadings and heritability in two samples of Russian twins.
== Criticism ==

Spearman&#x27;s hypothesis has often been taken to imply natural differences in Black-White general intelligence, a conclusion that is rejected by a strong consensus within the scientific community. It has been used to justify pseudo-scientific racist theories.

Spearman&#x27;s hypothesis and the arguments that invoke it have received multiple criticisms, including criticisms of Jensen&#x27;s method of correlated vectors, of the inference that the first formulation of Spearman&#x27;s hypothesis supports the second, and of genetic and biological arguments made on the basis of Spearman&#x27;s hypothesis.

First, Jensen&#x27;s MCV has been criticized with regards to the original formulation of Spearman&#x27;s hypothesis. Peter Schönemann and others argue that MCV produces tautological results; Schönemann further notes that Jensen&#x27;s summary of Spearman&#x27;s hypothesis is vaguely-defined and essentially presents two contradictory interpretations. Dolan and Lubke (2001) find Schönemann&#x27;s argument that the correlations are positive by mathematical necessity unconvincing; however, they agree with his broader concern about whether his correlations are a good test of the role of &quot;g&quot; in racial intelligence differences. Ashton and Lee (2005) argue that MCV can produce spurious results.

Second, Jensen&#x27;s MCV has been criticized with regards to the claim that it supports the later formulation of Spearman&#x27;s hypothesis. Dolan et al. (2004) argue that MCV lacks specificity: that is, that instances not including &quot;g&quot; differences could create a positive correlation between the magnitude of the group differences and the &quot;g&quot;-loadings. Dolan et al. (2004) note that they are specifically criticizing MCV as a way of proving that group differences largely or totally represent g differences; they don&#x27;t argue against Spearman&#x27;s hypothesis as originally formulated and they do not argue that the larger body of evidence does not support Spearman&#x27;s hypothesis as later formulated. Hunt and Carlson summarize criticism:
 However, Rushton and Jensen (2010) argued that this criticism misses the point because there was no absolute claim that &quot;g&quot; had been proven—only that the results were what would have been expected if a &quot;g&quot; difference did in fact exist. 

Third, arguments based on Spearman&#x27;s hypothesis have been criticized. Some have argued that culturally caused differences could produce a correlation between g-loadings and group differences. Flynn (2010) has criticized the basic assumption that confirmation of Spearman&#x27;s hypothesis would support a partially genetic explanation for IQ differences. He argues that environmental causes for average group IQ differences would cause the differences to be greater for more complex tasks.

<text>The Cradle of Coaches is a nickname given to Miami University in Oxford, Ohio for its history of producing successful sports coaches, especially in football. Bob Kurz, a former Miami sports communications worker, popularized the term in a 1983 book, though the school&#x27;s association with the nickname goes as far back as the early 1960s. Miami frequently inducts former coaches into the Cradle of Coaching Association for their feats as alumni.

== Personnel ==
The program&#x27;s largest cohort are football coaches Earl Blaik, Paul Brown, Woody Hayes, Bill Arnsparger, George Little, Weeb Ewbank, Sid Gillman, Ara Parseghian, Bo Schembechler, John Pont, Carmen Cozza, Bill Mallory, Joe Novak, Ron Zook, Dick Crum, Paul Dietzel, Bill Narduzzi, Randy Walker, John Harbaugh, Nobby Wirkowski, Gary Moeller, Larry Smith, Dick Tomey, Terry Hoeppner, and Sean McVay.

Miami has also produced notable basketball coaches Darrell Hedric, Randy Ayers, Herb Sendek, Thad Matta and Sean Miller. Hedric, currently a scout for the Toronto Raptors, is an Ohio and Cincinnati Basketball Hall of Famer and holds the record for Miami victories. Ayers was a four-year starter for Miami, leading the team to back-to-back NCAA appearances in 1977 and 1978, and later served as a head coach for Ohio State and assistant coach in the National Basketball Association. Sendek began his head coaching career at Miami and led the RedHawks to the postseason in each of his three seasons. Matta, formerly the head coach at Ohio State, was an assistant under Sendek for one memorable year that included a regular season MAC championship and NCAA tournament appearance, and also for one year under then-head coach Charlie Coles. University of Tennessee basketball coach Ray Mears is also a graduate of Miami.

Baseball Hall of Fame manager Walter Alston is also a graduate of Miami. Additionally, hockey coach George Gwozdecky served as head coach at Miami prior to leaving for Denver, where he won two national championships.

The Cradle of Coaches also was the subject of sports documentary film that aired on Time Warner Cable SportsChannel (Ohio) in 2015. The film captured the story of John Harbaugh&#x27;s induction as well as perspective from other members.


== Cradle of Coaches - Super Bowl Champions ==
Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, is known as the &quot;Cradle of Coaches.&quot; The phrase was coined by former Miami (Ohio) sports information director Bob Kurz. 

The success of coaches with Miami ties is well documented. Recently, Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh and LA Rams head coach Sean McVay, both Miami graduates, have coached Super Bowl champions. Three N.F.L. head coaches, who are also Miami University graduates, have coached their teams to victories on the sports biggest stage. 

Harbaugh coached the Ravens to the World Championship on February 3, 2013, a 34-31 win over the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XLVII.

McVay coached the Rams to the World Championship on February 13, 2022, a 23-20 win over the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl LVI. 

Weeb Ewbank (Miami, 1924) coached the New York Jets to the World Championship on January 12, 1969, a 16-7 win over the Baltimore Colts.
==Cradle of Coaches Association inductees==
Super Bowl winning former head coach John Harbaugh was inducted in their Hall of Fame in 2014.

== The Mother of Coaches ==
The McGuffey Reader, the Mother of Fraternities, The Miami Triad (Beta Theta Pi, Phi Delta Theta, Sigma Chi)..all these were attributed to Miami University (founded in 1809) in Oxford, Ohio.

In the fall of 1959, Bob Kurz, Sports Information Director and a recent graduate (1958) recounted that several Miami graduates were making history on the football field. Louisiana State University under Paul Dietzel (1948), was listed as number 1 in the country. Northwestern University under Ara Parseghian (1948) was number 2; Earl (Red) Blaik (1918) was leading Army to an undefeated season while Paul Brown (1930) was guiding the Cleveland Browns and Weeb Eubank (1928) was leading the Baltimore Colts. Both pro teams were on top of their divisions.

It was a short leap from the ‘mother’ moniker to a cradle: The next day Kurz wrote the phrase that has become synonymous with Miami University football, Miami of Ohio, the Cradle of Coaches. His book on the history of Miami&#x27;s coaches was written in 1983.
==&quot;The Cradle of Coaches&quot; sculpture group==
A sculptural group called &quot;The Cradle of Coaches&quot;, by sculptor Kristen Visbal, was erected at Miami University between 2009 and 2011, with one addition in 2014. It consists of ten 120% lifesize statues of Earl Blaik, Paul Brown, Carm Cozza, Paul Dietzel, Weeb Ewbank, John Harbaugh, Ara Parseghian, John Pont, Bo Schembechler, Thomas Van Voorhis, and Sean McVay.

<doc id="1333489" wikidata="Q7704524" url="?curid=1333489" title="Terry Hoeppner">
<text>Terry Lee Hoeppner (August 19, 1947 – June 19, 2007) was an American college football coach who served as head coach of the Miami RedHawks from 1999 to 2004 and the Indiana Hoosiers from 2005 to 2006. Shortly after announcing that he would be on medical leave for the 2007 season, he died of brain cancer.

Hoeppner was a 1969 graduate of Franklin College, where he was a member of the Phi Delta Theta international fraternity. He played for the Indiana Caps of the Midwest Football League, and Detroit Wheels and Charlotte Hornets of the World Football League. He owned a 57–39 overall record as a collegiate head coach. He is a member of the Indiana Football Hall of Fame.

==Family==
Terry and Jane Hoeppner had three children: Drew Hoeppner, Amy Fox, and Allison Hoeppner. Allison was killed in an automobile accident on September 24, 2016.

==Professional career==
Hoepper signed with the St. Louis Cardinals of the National Football League as an undrafted free agent in May 1969. He left the team during training camp due to an injury. He played for the Indiana Caps of the Midwest Football League in 1972. Hoeppner signed with the Green Bay Packers of the NFL in 1973, but they released him before the season on August 28, 1973. He played for the Detroit Wheels of the World Football League in 1974. The Wheels folded after the 1974 season, and Hoeppner was selected by the Charlotte Hornets in a WFL dispersal draft in October 1974.

==High school coach==
Hoeppner was a head coach of Eastbrook High School in Marion, Indiana (1970–1972), Pinson Valley High School in Pinson, Alabama (1973–1976), Mullins High School in Mullins, South Carolina (1976–1978) and East Noble High School in Kendallville, Indiana (1979).

==College assistant coach==
Hoeppner&#x27;s first job as an assistant coach was at his alma mater, Franklin College, where he served as defensive coordinator. He spent six years there before moving to Miami University as a linebacker coach in 1986. After 12 years, Hoeppner worked his way up to assistant head coach and defensive coordinator. He was also able to retain his positions after head coach Tim Rose was replaced prior to the 1990 season by the late Randy Walker. Hoeppner was instrumental in the development of several NFL players, including JoJuan Armour, Dustin Cohen, and Sheldon White.

==College head coach==
===Miami University===
After spending 13 years as an assistant at Miami, Hoeppner became the RedHawks&#x27; 31st head coach in 1999. He succeeded Walker, who was named head coach at Northwestern. Hoeppner&#x27;s first game at Miami was against Walker and the Wildcats, which resulted in a 28–3 Miami victory. Despite the win, his first year was considered by some to be a disappointment. The RedHawks were coming off a 10–1 season, and returned several starters including record-breaking running back Travis Prentice, but were only able to post a 7–4 record. The dropoff was attributed in part to Hoeppner&#x27;s installation of an open passing attack, rather than the running game Walker had used in the past. The change ended up paying dividends later, as Miami earned a 48–25 overall record under Hoeppner and finished among the top three in the Mid-American Conference East in each of his six years at the helm. While at Miami, Hoeppner recruited and signed Ben Roethlisberger by promising to play him at quarterback, whereas other programs were recruiting Roethlisberger as a wide receiver or a tight end. Roethlisberger went on to achieve great success in the National Football League (NFL) as quarterback of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Hoeppner&#x27;s best season was 2003 when Miami, quarterbacked by Roethlisberger, went 13–1 and finished No. 10 in the final AP Poll..

===Indiana===
During his first year as head coach at Indiana University, Hoeppner tried to resurrect life into the program through his campaign entitled &quot;Coach Hoeppner wants you.&quot; Hoeppner and the Hoosiers began the season 4–1 before losing their last six games. After the season, Hoeppner was diagnosed with a brain tumor The following year, the Hoosiers once again started strong, but eventually fell one game short of Hoeppner&#x27;s goal of reaching a college bowl berth. His oft quoted mantra was &quot;Play 13.&quot; In 2007, the inspired Hoosiers succeeded in Hoeppner&#x27;s goal and became eligible to participate in the Insight Bowl.

In September 2006, Hoeppner required additional brain surgery, causing him to miss two weeks of the regular season. He returned to the team to coach against Wisconsin.

==Death==
On March 18, 2007, it was revealed that he would sit out the 2007 spring practices for health reasons. IU announced in June 2007 that Hoeppner would be on a medical leave of absence for the entire 2007 season and that assistant coach Bill Lynch would serve as head coach. Shortly after the announcement, Hoeppner died from complications from his brain cancer.

<doc id="1333491" wikidata="Q705962" url="?curid=1333491" title="Greater Poland Uprising (1806)">
<text>Greater Poland uprising of 1806 was a Polish military insurrection which occurred in the region of Wielkopolska, also known as Greater Poland, against the occupying Prussian forces after the Partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1772–1795).

The uprising was organized by General Jan Henryk Dąbrowski to help advancing French forces under Napoleon in liberating Poland from Prussian occupation. The Wielkopolska Uprising was a decisive factor that allowed the formation of the Duchy of Warsaw (1807) and the inclusion of Wielkopolska in the Duchy of Warsaw.

==Historical background==
While the Kingdom of Prussia already possessed a large Polish population in Upper Silesia, it gained additional Polish citizens during the partitions of Poland. From the beginnings of Prussian rule Poles were subject to a series of measures aimed against them and their culture, notably the Polish language was abolished in favour of German.

The War of the Fourth Coalition between Napoleonic France and the Kingdom of Prussia gave hope to the Polish inhabitants of Greater Poland of recovering their independence and ending oppressive Prussian rule.

Napoleon, counting on the benefits of gaining control over lands on the other side of Prussia, sent a group of emissaries to South Prussia to collect information about the situation in the province and the sympathies of the Polish citizens. On 20 September 1806 the emperor issued orders to form a new division from Polish deserters from the Prussian army. There were so many that two days later, Napoleon decided to form a second division.

The open conflict between France and Prussia ensured that Prussia could only maintain a small number of troops in Greater Poland. Moreover, a large portion of those soldiers were Polish nationals. This caused a great deal of trouble for Prussian commanders; for instance, between 1 November and 20 December, 3000 Polish troops (1/7th) deserted from the Toruń Corps.

==Mission of General Dąbrowski==
In order to organize a diversion on the back of Prussians, Napoleon chose General Jan Henryk Dąbrowski, who was staying in Italy. Dąbrowski was chosen for this mission because he had a great respect in Greater Poland from his military leadership during the uprising of 1794.

Napoleon sent a message to Dąbrowski on 5 October 1806, and on 22 October the General met with the Emperor at Dessau. During this audience, Napoleon ordered Dąbrowski to go to Poznań and organize regular Polish troops. After four days of preparation, Dąbrowski proposed to the French Emperor his plan of forming a Polish army of 40,000 soldiers. To realize this plan, Dąbrowski asked to have Polish officers from other Napoleonic units sent to him, and on his special request, Józef Wybicki was designated to become the future head of the civilian authorities. This group heard from Napoleon, who was already in Berlin, that &quot;[Poles] have to deserve independence&quot; and, when asked whether he would create a Polish State, Napoleon answered: &quot;I will see whether the Poles are worthy of being a nation&quot;.

==Uprising==
Dąbrowski sent emissaries before him to Poznań, to evaluate the situation. After they returned to the General with the news that the whole &quot;region is full of patriotic spirit and joy about the success of the French Army&quot;, Dąbrowski and Wybicki entered the city on 3 November 1806 leading the first units of the French army. Their arrival became a large Polish patriotic demonstration. On this same day, Dąbrowski called Poles to stand with arms on Napoleon&#x27;s side and fight against Prussian occupation. Dąbrowski and Wybicki created &quot;Voivodship Commissions&quot; (Komisja wojewódzka) whose tasks were to take administrative control and keep the area quiet, preventing fights about social and economical issues.

Dąbrowski&#x27;s and Wybicki&#x27;s proclamation was enthusiastically adopted by the bourgeoisie but with reserve by the szlachta. Therefore, in the newly created Poznań Department, Polish units were formed mostly in large urban areas like Poznań, and in the countryside, mobilisation was very slow.

In the Kalisz Department, a special Proclamation for this area was announced on 9 November. Large centers of uprising fighters formed in Kalisz and Konin. On 10 November, Polish fighters engaged in battles against Prussian troops near Ostrzeszów and Kępno; then, on 13 November the uprising spread to the area around Sieradz.

Poles had the most difficult fighting in the Bydgoszcz Department. As Commander of the newly created Polish units in this region, General Amilkar Kosiński had to fight against the largest Prussian troops in Greater Poland on one side and with an uncooperative French intendent on the other one, using troops with very little training or experience.

Meanwhile, Dąbrowski was already creating a regular army, mobilising one man from each ten cottages, and on 3 December appointed the pospolite ruszenie as auxiliaries to the regular troops. These regular Army units, alongside some irregular uprising troops, cleaned Greater Poland of some pockets of remaining Prussian units. An uprising spread in other regions, and on 19 November, fighters took control over the Jasna Góra fortress.

== Advance on Masovia and Warsaw ==
In the same time, the Russian army under command of Bennigsen, invited by the Prussian King, captured Warsaw on 2 November and created a bridgehead on the left bank of the Vistula river.

Meanwhile, the French helped the insurgents and liberated Kłodawa on 17 November. Then, they marched east and fought for the first time near Bolimowo, where they finally defeated the Russians in two skirmishes on the 22 November. After that, Murat&#x27;s Corps fought another battle near Sochaczew four days later and approached near Warsaw. Bennigsen evacuated the garrison on 27 November and burned the bridge, then he ordered to murder Polish citizens in the city right-bank district Praga (like 12 years earlier). The French captured the city just a few hours later. Joachim Murat entered Warsaw welcomed as liberator.

The combined Franco-Polish maneuver cut the enemy country in half and isolated about 30,000 Prussian soldiers in Silesia.

Mainly due to the action of Wybicki at the beginning of January 1807, the regular Polish army, organised like other Napoleon&#x27;s armies, had 23,000 soldiers (20,000 of them were from the Poznań and Kalisz Departments). The French Emperor stayed in Poznań between 27 November and 12 December 1806.

Napoleon himself arrived at Warsaw four days later, when he created a new plan called &quot;Pultusk operation&quot;. The Emperor wanted the cross the Vistula river and Destroy Bennigsen&#x27;s forces. The French maneuver started on 23 December, when &quot;Le&quot; &quot;Grande Armée&quot; attacked the Russian rearguard which withdrew after a few hours. Napoleon finally engaged Bennigsen in two big battles at Pułtusk and Gołymin on a Christmas Day two days later. However, despite achieving a tactical victory, the Russians withdrew. The French now controlled the right bank of the Vistula and attempted to destroy Bennigsen&#x27;s army. This situation ultimately led to the bloody battle of Eylau on 7-8 February 1807.

==Pomeranian Campaign==
On 1 January 1807, Dąbrowski was near Łowicz, where he received from the hands of Wincenty Krasiński a bulawa of hetman Stefan Czarniecki. The great merits of Dąbrowski and his popularity among soldiers weren&#x27;t given much consideration, in the appointment of the Chief of the War Office in the Ruling Commission (szef Dyrekcji Wojny w Komisji Rządzącej). Józef Poniatowski, who was unfavourable to Dąbrowski, was appointed instead. Napoleon chose him because he wanted to guarantee the cooperation of the Polish aristocracy. A large difference between Dąbrowski and Poniatowski was exemplified during the writing of the Polish Army Code. Poniatowski wanted to keep corporal punishment, but Dąbrowski loudly opposed against it. To avoid this conflict, Napoleon decided that Polish Army would adopt the French code.

On 3 January, French marshal Louis-Alexandre Berthier gave the order to existing units of planned divisions of Poznań and Kalisz Departments to form one brigade from each Department. The Commander of the Poznań Brigade was General Wincenty Axamitowski and the Kalisz Brigade was commanded by General Stanisław Fiszer. Both brigades of infantry formed a division commanded by general Dąbrowski. Brigades were strengthened by 300 Polish cavalry units, in addition to the unit from the Warsaw Department, that were both transformed in a unique regiment of cavalry commanded by the son of Jan Henryk Dąbrowski – Lt. Col. Jan Michał Dąbrowski. All the units of the new division, that started their march on 7 January, had to meet in Bydgoszcz.

Meanwhile, the units commanded by Amilkar Kosiński, which had been fighting against regular Prussian troops since December, won the battle of Koronowo and marched to Świecie, forcing the enemy to leave the town and securing this place of concentration for the newly created division.

Before the beginning of the new campaign, the main Polish troops were strengthened and reorganized into three divisions: Poznań Division commanded by J. H. Dąbrowski, Kalisz Division commanded by Józef Zajączek and Warsaw Division commanded by Józef Poniatowski. Kalisz Division was sent to the siege of Grudziądz and the Warsaw Division moved northwards with the whole French Army in the direction of Danzig. At this time, 6000 soldiers of the Poznań Division stayed near Bydgoszcz and later advanced on Gniezno and Dirschau. Both towns were captured, but the Poles were forced to retreat by Prussian troops. Later on, Poniatowski ordered a part of the pospolite ruszenie that weakened the Poznań Division to disband, which were returned as reinforcements in February 1807. After that, only the troops of Gen. Kosiński were fighting in this area.

After a reorganization, Poznań Division was composed of 6 battalions of infantry, 3 squadrons of cavalry and 2,000 pospolite ruszenie commanded by Gen. Michał Sokolnicki. On 15 February, cavalry again captured Dirschau, but was once again forced to retreat. 8 days later, on 23 February, the whole division attacked the town which was defended by a strong Prussian garrison. After 7 hours of battle, Poles captured Dirschau, but Gen. Dąbrowski was wounded, forcing him to leave his division for a while, and his son was badly injured as well. Therefore, J. M. Dąbrowski was promoted to the rank of Brigade General and moved to the Invalide Corps. After the battle, Gen. Kosiński became the new division commander.

Earlier, in January 1807, Dąbrowski had formed from the Poznań troops, a Division group commanded by Col. Garczyński. This unit captured Schneidemühl, Deutsch Krone and Wieluń. February 1807, Garczyński&#x27;s group was subordinated to Gen. Kosiński and later, with some troops of pospolite ruszenie, was sent to fight near Neustettin. At this time, the troops of Sokolnicki captured Stolp in Pommern and, later on, took part in the siege of Danzig, which surrendered in May. Also in May, Poznań Division, renamed as 3rd Polish Division, returned under the command of Gen. J. H. Dąbrowski. After the capture of Danzig, Polish troops fought also in Masuria, including the battle of Friedland.

==Aftermath==
The Pomeranian Campaign was ended by the capitulation of Königsberg on 15 June 1807, the later treaties of Tilsit and the recognition of the Duchy of Warsaw by the Kingdom of Prussia.

However, there was a more immediate effect. By the time of the uprising, the Prussian army, previously thought among the strongest of Europe, had been fought to almost the point of total liquidation. Napoleon had destroyed the majority of the Prussian army only months after the declaration of war, and the only significant force loyal to the Prussian regime left was garrisoning Prussian Poland. These troops were expected to reinforce the Russians and continue fighting the French. With this Polish uprising supported by French military operations, this was no longer possible for the simple reason that outside a handful of Prussian units who managed to escape and join the Russians, the Prussian army had been completely and systematically wiped out. Russia would face France alone.

<text>A Singles Collection (released as Six of One, Half-Dozen of the Other in the U.S.) is a compilation album of Marillion singles from both the Fish era and the Steve Hogarth era, celebrating the band&#x27;s ten-year jubilee (taking 1982, when their debut single was released, as the starting point). It includes the band&#x27;s six most successful singles of the Fish era, plus all six Steve Hogarth singles up to that year.

The tracks on it are not ordered chronologically, unlike on the later compilations &quot;The Best of Both Worlds&quot; (1997) and &quot;The Best of Marillion&quot; (2003) that likewise cover both vocalists&#x27; eras. Additionally, it contains two new recordings with Hogarth on vocals, &quot;I Will Walk on Water&quot; and a cover version of the Rare Bird song &quot;Sympathy&quot;. This was also released as a single, which peaked at no. 16 in the UK Singles Chart (May 1992), making it the band&#x27;s highest-charting single between 1987 and 2004. In August 1992, &quot;No One Can&quot;, a re-packaged version of the August 1991 single from &quot;Holidays in Eden&quot;, was released as the second single, peaking at no. 26 (original version no. 33).

<doc id="1333512" wikidata="Q421570" url="?curid=1333512" title="T-2 mycotoxin">
<text>T-2 mycotoxin is a trichothecene mycotoxin. It is a naturally occurring mold byproduct of &quot;Fusarium&quot; spp. fungus which is toxic to humans and other animals. The clinical condition it causes is &quot;alimentary toxic aleukia&quot; and a host of symptoms related to organs as diverse as the skin, airway, and stomach. Ingestion may come from consumption of moldy whole grains. T-2 can be absorbed through human skin. Although no significant systemic effects are expected after dermal contact in normal agricultural or residential environments, local skin effects can not be excluded. Hence, skin contact with T-2 should be limited.

==History==
Alimentary toxic aleukia (ATA), a disease which is caused by trichothecenes like T-2 mycotoxin, killed many thousands of USSR citizens in the Orenburg District in the 1940s. It was reported that the mortality rate was 10% of the entire population in that area. During the 1970s it was proposed that the consumption of contaminated food was the cause of this mass poisoning. Because of World War II, harvesting of grains was delayed and food was scarce in Russia. This resulted in the consumption of grain that was contaminated with &quot;Fusarium&quot; molds, which produce T-2 mycotoxin.

In 1981, the United States Secretary of State Alexander Haig and his successor George P. Shultz accused the Soviet Union of using T-2 mycotoxin as a chemical weapon known as &quot;yellow rain&quot; in Laos (1975–81), Kampuchea (1979–81), and Afghanistan (1979–81), where it allegedly caused thousands of casualties. Although several US chemical weapons experts claim to have identified &quot;yellow rain&quot; samples from Laos as trichothecenes, other experts believe that this exposure was due to naturally occurring T-2 mycotoxin in contaminated foods. Another alternative theory was developed by Harvard biologist Matthew Meselson, who proposed that the &quot;yellow rain&quot; found in Southeast Asia originated from the excrement of jungle bees. The first indication for this theory came from finding high levels of pollen in the collected samples, giving the substance its yellow color. It was also found that jungle bees in this area fly collectively in great numbers, at altitudes too high to be easily seen, producing showers of feces that could have been mistaken for sprays from aircraft. Further testing later determined that the oily liquid was, in fact, the pollen-filled feces of jungle bees. A similar case in China was brought to light, and in this instance the cause of the phenomenon had also been bee excrement. Despite this conclusive analysis, the United States has not withdrawn its allegations and declares that the issue has not been fully resolved.

T-2 mycotoxin is also thought to be a cause of Gulf War syndrome. US troops suffered from mycotoxicosis-like symptoms after an Iraqi missile detonated in a US military camp in Saudi Arabia during Operation Desert Storm in the Persian Gulf War, in 1991. It has been shown that Iraq researched trichothecene mycotoxins, among other substances, and thus was capable of its possession and employment in chemical warfare. Nevertheless, much of the key information from these incidents remains classified, leaving these matters still unresolved.

== Chemical properties ==
This compound has a tetracyclic sesquiterpenoid 12,13-epoxytrichothene ring system, which relates it to the trichothecenes. These compounds are generally very stable and are not degraded during storage/milling and cooking/processing of food. They do not degrade at high temperatures either. This compound has an epoxide ring, and several acetyl and hydroxyl groups on its side chains. These features are mainly responsible for the biological activity of the compound and make it highly toxic. T-2 mycotoxin is able to inhibit DNA and RNA synthesis in vivo and in vitro and can induce apoptosis. However, in vivo the compound rapidly metabolizes to HT-2 mycotoxin (a major metabolite).

==Mechanism of action==
The toxicity of T-2 toxin is due to its 12,13-epoxy ring. Epoxides are in general toxic compounds; these react with nucleophiles and then undergo further enzymatic reactions. The reactivity of epoxides can lead to reactions with endogenous compounds and cellular constituents like DNA bases and proteins. 
These reactions could be the reason for the noticed actions and effects of T-2 mycotoxin. The toxic compound influences the metabolism of membrane phospholipids, leads to an increase of liver lipid peroxidases and has an inhibiting effect on DNA and RNA synthesis. In addition it can bind to an integral part of the 60s ribosomal subunit, peptidyltransferase, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis.
These effects are thought to be the explanation for T-2 toxin inducing apoptosis (cell death) in different tissues as the immune system, the gastrointestinal tissue and also fetal tissue. With regard to apoptosis there has been noticed that the level of the pro-apoptotic factor Bas (Bcl-2-associated X protein) was increased and the level of Bcl-xl, an anti-apoptotic factor, was decreased in human chrondocytes (cartilage cells). When exposed to T-2 mycotoxin. Furthermore, the level of Fas, an apoptosis-related cell-surface antigen and p53, a protein regulating the cell cycle, were increased.

==Synthesis==
T-2 mycotoxin is produced naturally by Fusarium fungi of which the most important species are: &quot;F. sporotrichioides&quot;, &quot;F. langsethiae&quot;, &quot;F. acuminatum&quot; and &quot;F. poae&quot;. These fungi are found in grains such as barley, wheat and oats. The production of this compound for research and commercial purposes is generally accomplished by cultivating some strain of T-2 mycotoxin producing fungi on agar plates. On these agar plates the fungi appear powdery and can yield substantial amounts of T-2 mycotoxin. For the isolation of the compound high pressure liquid chromatography is commonly used (HPLC).

In the &quot;Fusarium&quot; species, biosynthesis of the T-2 mycotoxin often starts with trichodiene, and many of the species share a common route of oxidizations and cyclizations. As an example, from the &quot;F. sporotrichioides&quot; species, the important oxidation steps that occur start from trichodiene and goes to isotrichodiol. From there, the eleventh carbon atom is oxidized to form isotrichotriol. The ninth carbon is then oxidized, and trichotriol is formed, which then cyclizes to make isotrichodermol. After that, the fifteenth carbon is oxidized to form didecalonectrin, which leads to the fourth carbon being oxidized, and diacetoxyscirpenol is formed. The second to last step is the oxidation of the eighth carbon to make neosolaniol, which then undergoes slight modification to create the T-2 toxin.

==Toxicity==

=== ADME properties ===

==== Absorption and exposure ====
Humans and animals are generally exposed to T-2 mycotoxins through food. Certain grains can contain the toxin which makes it a threat to human health and an economic burden. Unlike most biological toxins T-2 mycotoxin can be absorbed through intact skin. The compound can be delivered via food, water, droplets, aerosols and smoke from various dispersal systems. This makes it a potential biological weapon, however large amounts of the compound are required for a lethal dose. T-2 mycotoxin has an of approximately 1 milligram per kilogram of body weight.

The EFSA estimates that the mean exposure of T-2 in the EU lies between 12 and 43 ng/kg bw/day. This range is below the TDI of 100 ng/ kg body weight for the sum of HT-2 and T-2 toxins which is used by the EFSA.

==== Distribution ====

T-2 mycotoxin is distributed uniformly throughout the body without preference to a specific organ or site. In rodents, plasma concentration levels peak around roughly thirty minutes after exposure, and in one study, the half-life of the T-2 toxin was seen to be less than twenty minutes. In a different study involving pigs, the distribution after four hours of IV injection was seen to be 15–24% in the GI tract and 4.7–5.2% in various other tissues.

==== Metabolism ====
Once absorbed and distributed to various tissues, the T-2 mycotoxin goes through various metabolic reactions before it gets excreted. In vivo studies showed that the most occurring reactions are ester hydrolysis and hydroxylation of the isovaleryl group. Deepoxidation and glucuronide conjugation do also occur. Ht-2 is the main metabolite. For the hydroxylation, the cytochrome p450 enzyme complex is suggested to be involved. T-2 triol and T-2 tetraol are most likely to be formed via acetylcholine esterases. Some of the metabolic reactions of the mycotoxin are performed by the microflora in the gut. The formed metabolites in these reactions are species- and pH-dependent. The ester cleavages are however performed by the mammal itself and not by the microflora. In red blood cells T-2 mycotoxin is metabolized to neosolaniol, and, in white blood cells, to HT-2 via hydrolysis catalyzed by carboxylesterases.

==== Excretion ====
Following absorption, distribution, and metabolism, T-2 mycotoxin is excreted fairly quickly, where 80–90% of it is excreted within 48 hours. The main methods of excretion seem to be from the urine and feces, where excretion through bile contributes heavily to the feces route of excretion. There is also very little of the parent T-2 mycotoxin in the excretions, meaning most of the initial compound is metabolized beforehand.

=== Toxic effects ===
T-2 is highly toxic when inhaled. Acute toxic symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, skin irritation, itching, rash, blisters, bleeding and dyspnea. If the individual is exposed to T-2 over a longer period alimentary toxic aleukia (ATA) develops.

At first the patient experiences a burning sensation in the mouth, throat and stomach. After a few days the person will suffer from an acute gastroenteritis that will last for 3 to 9 days. Within 9 weeks the bone marrow will slowly degenerate. Also the skin starts bleeding and the total number of leukocytes decreases. Problems with the nervous system can occur.

In the end the following symptoms might occur: a high fever, petechial haemorrhage, necrosis of muscles and skin, bacterial infections of the necrotic tissue, enlarged lymph nodes. There is the possibility of asphyxiation because of laryngeal oedema and stenosis of the glottis. The lack of oxygen is then the cause of death. Otherwise the patient will die of bronchial pneumonia and lung bleeding.

=== Effects on animals ===
T-2 mycotoxin is also toxic to animals. The compound is known for having lethal and sub-lethal effects on farm animals. It is often found in contaminated cereal grains that are fed to these animals. Most of the toxic effects are shared between humans and animals. After exposing zebra fish embryos to a concentration of 20 μmol/L or higher malformation and mortality rates increased. The malformations included tail deformities, cardiovascular defects and changes in behavior in early stages of life. This is the result of an increase in the amount of epoxides, which causes cell apoptosis. Other studies have shown that T-2-toxin causes lipid peroxidation in rats after feeding it to them. As the effect of T-2 toxin, elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were observed in several mammalian species. However, in spite of the general harmful effects caused by the toxin, in a study carried out in different chicken derived hepatic cell culture models, no alterations were found in the redox status of the cells.

The compound also seems to reduce the fertility of ewes and heifers. Research has shown that a high dose of T-2 delays the ovulation due to a delayed follicle maturation. This possibly retards the following luteinisation, which makes it impossible for female animals to conceive.

T-2 also has an effect on the fertility of bulls. In 1998 it was discovered that moldy hay influenced the quality of semen of bulls. Analysis of the moldy hay showed that T-2 was present. The compound decreased sperm motility and testosterone levels and increased the frequency of morphological abnormalities in the sperm cells.

The liver is another target for the mycotoxin. It is one of the first organs where the compound passes through after ingestion. Here it causes a reduced expression of CYP1A proteins in rabbits, pigs and rats. CYP3A activity decreases in pigs too. These enzymes help metabolize drugs that pass through the liver. Decrease in the activity could lead to an increase of unmetabolized drugs in the plasma. This can have a dangerous effect on an animal&#x27;s health.

All of the mentioned effects happen when T-2 is ingested in high doses. Animals are able to metabolize the compound with enzymes from the CYP3A family, just like humans.

== Treatments ==
At the moment, there is no specific therapy for T-2 mycotoxin poisonings. Exposure of the mycotoxin is typically followed by standardized treatment for toxic compounds in order to reduce the effect of the toxin. This includes using activated charcoal, which has a high binding capacity of 0.48 mg of T-2 mycotoxin to 1 mg of charcoal. For dermal contact, soap and water is used to reduce the dermal effects. As a kind of prophylaxis, antioxidants are believed to have properties that may provide benefits.

== Application ==
There are currently no applications, aside from war, for T-2 mycotoxins; however, there are some plausible therapeutic uses. Due to their abilities, research shows possible uses for the mycotoxin as growth promoters, antibiotics, antivirals, as an antileukemic, and as an antimalarial.

<text>The first USS &quot;Ammen&quot; (DD-35) was a in the United States Navy during World War I and later in the United States Coast Guard, designated as CG-8. She was named for Rear Admiral Daniel Ammen.

==Construction==
&quot;Ammen&quot; was laid down on 29 March 1910 by the New York Shipbuilding Company, Camden, New Jersey; launched on 20 September 1910; sponsored by Miss Ethel C. Andrews; and commissioned at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 23 May 1911. Construction cost $655,075.13 (hull and machinery).

==World War I==
Following commissioning, &quot;Ammen&quot; was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet. She operated with the Torpedo Flotilla along the east coast. Upon the outbreak of World War I in Europe in 1914, &quot;Ammen&quot; began neutrality patrols and escort duty along the east coast. After the United States entered the conflict in April 1917, &quot;Ammen&quot; sailed for the Bahamas on a reconnaissance mission. When she returned to the United States, the destroyer entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 6 May to be fitted out for overseas service. &quot;Ammen&quot; was assigned to Division 9, Destroyer Force, and sailed on 18 June for St. Nazaire, France.

After the arrival of the convoy at St. Nazaire on 2 July, &quot;Ammen&quot; proceeded to Queenstown, Ireland, and was attached to American naval forces based there. The ship carried out convoy escort duty between Ireland and France, patrolled off the Irish coast for enemy submarines, and went to the aid of vessels in distress. &quot;Ammen&quot; returned to the United States in January 1919. She made a cruise to the Gulf of Mexico before going out of commission at Philadelphia on 11 December 1919. The vessel was designated DD-35 on 17 July 1920.

==Inter-war period==
&quot;Ammen&quot; remained at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania until 28 April 1924, when she was transferred to the Coast Guard, in whose hands she was redesignated CG-8. &quot;Ammen&quot; was one of 20 destroyers that formed the Coast Guard Offshore Patrol Force, established to help suppress bootlegging.

On 22 May 1931, &quot;Ammen&quot; was returned to the Navy, but she performed no further active service. Her name was dropped on 1 July 1933, and thereafter she was referred to as DD-35. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 5 July 1934 and sold to Michael Flynn, Inc, Brooklyn, New York.
