<text>Fruit salad is a dish consisting of various kinds of fruit, sometimes served in a liquid, either their juices or a syrup. In different forms, fruit salad can be served as an appetizer or a side as a salad. A fruit salad is sometimes known as a fruit cocktail (often connoting a canned product), or fruit cup (when served in a small container).

There are many types of fruit salad, ranging from the basic (no nuts, marshmallows, or dressing) to the moderately sweet (Waldorf salad) to the sweet (ambrosia salad). Another &quot;salad&quot; containing fruit is a jello salad, with its many variations. A fruit cocktail is well-defined in the US to mean a well-distributed mixture of small diced pieces of (from highest percentage to lowest) peaches, pears, pineapple, grapes, and cherry halves. Fruit salad may also be canned (with larger pieces of fruit than a cocktail).

==Description==

There are several home recipes for fruit salads that contains different kinds of fruit, or that use a different kind of sauce other than the fruit&#x27;s juice or syrup. Common ingredients used in fruit salads include strawberries, pineapple, honeydew, watermelon, grapes, and kiwifruit. Various recipes may call for the addition of nuts, fruit juices, certain vegetables, yogurt, or other ingredients.

One variation is a Waldorf-style fruit salad, which uses a mayonnaise-based sauce. Other recipes use sour cream (such as in ambrosia), yogurt, or even custard as the primary sauce ingredient. A variation on fruit salad uses whipped cream mixed in with many varieties of fruits (usually a mixture of berries), and also often includes miniature marshmallows. Rojak, a Malaysian fruit salad, uses a spicy sauce with peanuts and shrimp paste. In the Philippines, fruit salads are popular party and holiday fare, usually made with &quot;buko&quot;, or young coconut, and condensed milk in addition to other canned or fresh fruit. In Hawaii by influence of Cantonese immigrants during the sugar plantation days,&quot;almond float&quot; was introduced, where almond flavored gelatin is prepared, cubed, and typically mixed with canned fruit cocktail and canned lychee. Sicilian orange salad is a typical dish of Sicily (Italy) and Spain in which orange slices are dressed with olive oil, salt, and black pepper.

Mexico has a popular variation of the fruit salad called Bionico which consists of various fruits drenched in condensed milk and sour cream mix. Guacamole may also be considered a fruit salad, consisting predominantly of various fruits and fruit juices such as avocados, lemon and/or lime juice, tomatoes, chili peppers, and black peppercorns.

There is also an extended variety of fruit salads in Moroccan cuisine, often as part of a kemia, a selection of appetizers or small dishes analogous to Spanish tapas or eastern Mediterranean mezze.

A fruit salad ice cream is also commonly manufactured, with small pieces of real fruit embedded, flavored either with juices from concentrate, fruit extracts, or artificial chemicals.

==Fruit cocktail==

&quot;Fruit cocktail&quot; is often sold canned and is a staple of cafeterias, but can also be made fresh. The use of the word &quot;cocktail&quot; in the name does not mean that it contains alcohol, but refers to the secondary definition: &quot; an appetizer made by combining pieces of food, such as fruit or seafood&quot;.

In the United States, the USDA stipulates that canned &quot;fruit cocktail&quot; must contain a certain percentage distribution of pears, grapes, cherries, peaches, and pineapples to be marketed as fruit cocktail. It must contain fruits in the following range of percentages:
*30% to 50% diced peaches, any yellow variety
*25% to 45% diced pears, any variety
*6% to 16% diced pineapple, any variety
*6% to 20% whole grapes, any seedless variety
*2% to 6% cherry halves, any light sweet or artificially colored red variety (like maraschino cherries)

Both William Vere Cruess of the University of California, Berkeley and Herbert Gray of the Barron-Gray Packing Company of San Jose, California, have been credited with the invention of fruit cocktails. Barron–Gray was the first company to sell fruit cocktail commercially, beginning in 1930, and California Packing Corporation began selling it under its Del Monte brand a few years later.

Canned fruit cocktails and canned fruit salad are similar, but fruit salad contains larger fruit while fruit cocktail is diced. Commercially, the fruit used was healthy but cosmetically damaged, such as a peach or pear that was bruised on one side. The bruised parts would be cut away and discarded, and the rest would be diced into small pieces.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Fruit Salad&quot; (also known as &quot;Fruit Salad Yummy Yummy&quot;) is the name of a song by Australian children&#x27;s band the Wiggles.

&quot;Fruit-salad&quot; is also a slang term used for medals on a soldier&#x27;s uniform, e.g. &quot;Look at the fruit-salad on that colonel.&quot; The term refers to the bright colors of a high percentage of the ribbons that usually go with medals.

&quot;Fruit salad&quot; is an alternative name for the party game Fruit Basket Turnover.

<text>Jackie Guerrido (born September 24, 1970), is a Puerto Rican television weather presenter and journalist for &quot;Primer Impacto&quot; on Univision. She also is a TV host for &quot;Despierta America en Domingo&quot;.

==Early years==
Guerrido was born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where she received her primary and secondary education. According to Guerrido, her mother was mistreated by her father, therefore Guerrido and her sister had to seek shelter together with their mother at the &quot;Casa Protegida Julia de Burgos&quot;, a domestic violence shelter in San Juan, when she was seven years old. After graduating from high school, she moved with her family to The Bronx borough of New York City.

==Career==
Before Guerrido worked in the media, she had shown interest in other areas of work.

Guerrido was offered a position on WSKQ&#x27;s morning show, &quot;El Vacilon de la Mañana&quot; (&quot;Good times in the morning&quot;), by a producer who heard her doing a voice-over. She soon received an offer from WRMA (106.7) in Miami, which she accepted.

Guerrido settled down in Miami and she joined the HBC Radio Company, after working at &quot;Romance&quot; for a year. There she was given the opportunity to co-host a radio program with the duties of broadcasting news and traffic conditions. Eventually, she was given her own music show at WRTO (98.3). She also landed a job in television as a traffic reporter for WSCV, Miami&#x27;s Telemundo affiliate, working for both the radio and television at the same time.

===Weather forecaster===
Univision took notice of Guerrido and made her an offer to become the weather presenter for &quot;Al Amanacer de Noticias 23&quot; (&quot;Morning News at Channel 23&quot;), the then-morning show for Univision flagship WLTV. She studied meteorology at the University of Miami.

For several years, Guerrido presented the weather on &quot;Despierta America&quot; (&quot;Wake Up America&quot;), which is one of the most popular television programs among the Hispanic community in the United States. She also did the weather forecast for Univision&#x27;s afternoon newsmagazine show &quot;Primer Impacto&quot; (&quot;First Impact&quot;) with Barbara Bermudo. She studied journalism at the University of Florida. As of January 9, 2017, she is co-anchor of &quot;Primer Impacto&quot; alongside Pamela Silva Conde, replacing longtime anchor Barbara Bermudo.

===Mira Quien Baila! (2010)===
In 2004, Guerrido was named the &quot;Good Will Ambassador&quot; of the Puerto Rican Day Parade celebrated in New York City. She is the mother of two teenagers, Thomas and Adieny. On April 19, 2008, Jackie married reggaeton singer Don Omar in Puerto Rico. In 2010, Guerrido participated in Mira Quien Baila!, a reality show, which aired on Univision in the United States and is the American/Spanish-Speaking version of &quot;Dancing with the Stars.&quot; The show&#x27;s finale was on November 21, 2010 and Guerrido came in 2nd place, by popular vote, to Vadhir Derbez. Guerrido was awarded $10,000 (US) which she donated to the &quot;Casa Protegida Julia de Burgos&quot;, a domestic violence shelter.

===Filmography===
In 2014, Guerrido would portray the role of a detective in the movie AWOL-72.

<doc id="1310921" wikidata="Q7411240" url="?curid=1310921" title="Samuel Davidson">
<text>Samuel Davidson (September 18061 April 1898) was an Irish biblical scholar.

==Life==
He was born at Kellswater, County Antrim, the son of Abraham Davidson, into a Scots-Irish presbyterian. He was educated at the village school, under James Darragh, and then in Ballymena till 1824; and then became a student at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution, destined for the presbyterian ministry. His college course included periods in Londonderry and Liverpool, and was completed in 1832.

In November 1833 Davidson was licensed to preach by the Ballymena presbytery. In 1835 the Synod of Ulster made him the first professor of biblical criticism at Belfast College, and he held the post till 1841.

==Congregationalist==
Becoming a Congregationalist, Davidson accepted in 1842 the chair of biblical criticism, literature and oriental languages at the Lancashire Independent College, in Manchester.

In the summer of 1844 Davidson paid the first of a series of visits to Germany, and made the acquaintance of August Neander, Hermann Hupfeld, August Tholuck and others. He made lifelong friendships. A result of this trip was the translation of two volumes of Johann Karl Ludwig Gieseler&#x27;s &quot;Compendium of Ecclesiastical History&quot; (Edinburgh, 1846-7). In 1847 the congregational lecture in London was delivered by Davidson and published in 1848 as the &quot;Ecclesiastical Polity of the New Testament.&quot; It was reprinted in 1854, contrary to the author&#x27;s wish. His views had undergone changes, but he was not able to rewrite it.

Davidson was obliged to resign in 1857, clashing with the college authorities over the publication of an introduction to the Old Testament, &quot;The Text of the Old Testament, and the Interpretation of the Bible, written for a new edition of Horne&#x27;s Introduction to the Sacred Scripture&quot;. The work began with an approach by Messrs. Longman, in 1854, for help with a reissue of Thomas Hartwell Horne&#x27;s well-known &quot;Introduction to the Sacred Scriptures&quot;. Davidson undertook to rewrite the introduction to the Old Testament, and suggested Samuel Prideaux Tregelles should deal with the New Testament. Davidson&#x27;s work appeared in October 1856 as part of vol. ii. of the tenth edition of Horne&#x27;s &quot;Introduction&quot;, as &quot;The Text of the Old Testament Considered; with a Treatise on Sacred Interpretation, and a brief Introduction to the Old Testament Books and the Apocrypha.&quot; The reception was hostile. Davidson never lost the feeling that he had from then been treated unjustly.

At the November meeting of the Lancashire College committee it was stated that alarm had been taken in many quarters at the views expressed by Davidson in the new &quot;Introduction&quot;. A sub-committee was therefore appointed to report. The committee, in February 1857, requested Davidson to prepare &quot;an explanation&quot; of parts of his book deemed objectionable, and to &quot;make concession where concession may be justly due&quot;. In May his pamphlet &quot;Facts, Statements, and Explanations&quot;, was in print. The committee declared those explanations &quot;far from satisfactory&quot;, and after correspondence Davidson resigned his post.

Controversy ensued: Davidson was accused of doctrinal unsoundness, and also charged with plagiarism from German writers. A anonymous pamphlet of October 1857, &quot;Dr. Davidson: his Heresies, Contradictions, and Plagiarisms. By Two Graduates.&quot;, along those lines, was by Enoch Mellor, of the Square Chapel, Halifax, who also engaged in the contemporary &quot;Rivulet&quot; controversy and James Guinness Rogers, of Albion Chapel, Ashton-Under-Lyne. Mellor and Rogers, who were close friends, were students from the first intake of the College. Rogers was on the College&#x27;s committee, and is thought to have followed the lead of the conservative Thomas Raffles on Davidson&#x27;s reprimand and removal. Alexander Gordon writing in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; stated that &quot;Nothing contributed more to the expulsion of Davidson from his chair in the Lancashire Independent College than [the pamphlet].&quot;

On the other side appeared &quot;Dr. Davidson&#x27;s Removal from the Professorship of Biblical Literature in the Lancashire Independent College, Manchester, on account of alleged Error in Doctrine&quot;, London, 1860, by Thomas Nicholas. At the end of this pamphlet Connop Thirlwall, Henry Alford and William Cureton were quoted in Davidson&#x27;s favour. An account of the whole proceedings was in Davidson&#x27;s &quot;Autobiography&quot;, written by James Allanson Picton.

==Later life==
In 1862 Davidson moved to London to become scripture examiner in the University of London, and he spent the rest of his life in literary work.

Davidson is sometimes mistakenly listed as a member of the &quot;Old Testament Revision Committee&quot; for the Revised Version of 1881. The confusion is based on his sharing a surname with Andrew Bruce Davidson, D. D., Professor of Hebrew, Free Church College, Edinburgh, of that committee.

==Works==
Among his principal works are:

* &quot;Sacred Hermeneutics Developed and Applied&quot; (1843), rewritten and republished as &quot;A Treatise on Biblical Criticism&quot; (1852)
* &quot;Lectures on Ecclesiastical Polity&quot; (1848)
* &quot;An Introduction to the New Testament&quot; (1848), Samuel Bagster [publishing], Google eBook full read
* &quot;The Hebrew Text of the Old Testament Revised&quot; (1855)
* &quot;Introduction to the Old Testament&quot; (1862)
* &quot;On a Fresh Revision of the Old Testament&quot; (1873)
* &quot;The Canon of the Bible&quot; (1877)
* &quot;The Doctrine of Last Things in the New Testament&quot; (1883)

Also translations of the New Testament from Tischendorf&#x27;s text, Gieseler&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; (1846), and Fürst&#x27;s &quot;Hebrew and Chaldee Lexicon&quot;.

<doc id="1310926" wikidata="Q5052027" url="?curid=1310926" title="Cathal Coughlan (musician)">
<text>Cathal Coughlan (16 December 1960 – 18 May 2022) was an Irish singer and songwriter from Cork, best known as the frontman of the band Microdisney, formed with Sean O&#x27;Hagan in 1980. Their second album &quot;The Clock Comes Down the Stairs&quot; reached number one in the UK Indie Chart. They developed cult followings in the Irish and UK indie music scenes before breaking up in 1988.

Coughlan went on to lead the harder-edged The Fatima Mansions, who found critical success with their aggressive live shows and five consistent albums, but broke up in 1995.

In the following years Coughlan released intermittent solo material with musicians such as O&#x27;Hagan, Jonathan Fell and Nick Allum. His solo career and reputation peaked in 2021 with the well received album &quot;Song of Co-Aklan&quot; (composed from the point of view of his alter ego &quot;Co Aklan&quot;) which was released to critical acclaim fifteen years after his previous solo album &quot;Foburg&quot; (2006).

==Career==
=== Microdisney ===

Born in the village of Glounthaune, just outside of Cork city, Coughlan was active on the local Cork scene in the late 1970s, and after meeting Sean O&#x27;Hagan formed Microdisney as a duo in 1980. Following early local success, they moved to London, and recorded for the independent record label Rough Trade and, later and unsuccessfully, for the major label Virgin Records.

His lyrics with Microdisney focus on politics, relationships and the interplay between the two, and incorporate surreal imagery and literary and historical references. His voice on these records has been compared to Scott Walker, whom Coughlan considered a major influence. They broke up in 1988, after which O&#x27;Hagan and Coughlan formed separate bands, the High Llamas and the Fatima Mansions.

Microdisney reunited after three decades and performed together in London, Dublin and Cork in 2018 and 2019. In 2018, Coughlan and his bandmates received the IMRO/NCH Trailblazer Award, given to &quot;culturally important&quot; Irish albums (in this instance, for the 1985 album &quot;The Clock Comes Down the Stairs&quot;).

===The Fatima Mansions===
Coughlan formed the Fatima Mansions in 1988, naming the band after the large public housing complex in the working class area of Rialto in Dublin&#x27;s inner city. They became known for their aggressive music and song titles, including the early tracks &quot;Blues for Ceausescu&quot; and &quot;Bugs Fucking Bunny&quot;. Their 1989 debut album was &quot;Against Nature&quot; followed by &quot;Viva Dead Ponies&quot; in 1990 and the 1991 EP &quot;Bertie&#x27;s Brochures&quot; and the acclaimed albums &quot;Valhalla Avenue&quot; (1992) and &quot;Lost in the Former West&quot; (1994). Due to intra-band tension and contractual difficulties with Virgin Records, Fatima Mansions broke up in 1995.

===Solo work and collaborations===
Contractual issues prevented Coughlan from performing in the aftermath of break up of the Fatima Mansions. His following album was released in August 2010 with the single &quot;Rancho Tetrahedron&quot;, credited to &quot;Cathal Coughlan and the Grand Necropolitan Quartet&quot;. He later admitted that the supporting live performances were aggressive &quot;because there was just all this business nonsense going on and I wasn&#x27;t able to perform new stuff in public at all because I was in certain contractual difficulties&quot;. Reviewing the album, &quot;The Irish Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Coughlan&#x27;s mixture of acerbity and dark lyricism is sustained on his fifth solo album, that there is a subtle Latin influence on the music, and Coughlan&#x27;s Scott Walker inflected voice has never sounded better.&quot;

He recorded with comedian Sean Hughes, High Llamas drummer Rob Allum (under the name of his alter-ego &quot;Cod&quot;), and Paul Jarvis of SLAB! as &quot;Bubonique&quot;, releasing a number of CDs parodying current musical trends, including the albums &quot;20 Golden Showers&quot; and &quot;Trance Arse Volume 3&quot;. He collaborated in 2011 with the British The Auteurs and Black Box Recorder vocalist Luke Haines on the song/speech show &quot;The North Sea Scrolls&quot; which premiering at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2011. The studio recording of &quot;The North Sea Scrolls&quot; was released on 19 November 2012.

Coughlan&#x27;s last album &quot;Song of Co-Aklan&quot; was completed at the end of 2019 in collaboration with Nick Allum, Aindrias O&#x27;Gruama, Jon Fell, Luke Haines, Audrey Riley, James Woodrow and Rhodri Marsden. It was preceded by the single &quot;Song of Co-Aklan&quot; and released in March 2021 on Dimple Discs. He formed the duo Telefís with US-based Irish producer and musician Jacknife Lee with whom he released the album &quot;A hAon&quot; in 2022. and a further release, &quot;A Dó&quot;, in October 2022.

<text>Joyce Cooling is an American jazz guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter. She has performed with Joe Henderson, Stan Getz, Mark Murphy, Al Jarreau, and Charlie Byrd.

==Music career==
Cooling was born into a musical family. Her mother, a music teacher, was a classical music aficionado. After moving to California from New York in the early 1980s, Cooling began sitting in on the percussion classes of Ghanaian drummer C. K. Ladzekpo. Integrating the polyrhythms of West African music with her passion for melody and harmony, Cooling focused her attention on guitar and taught herself to play by ear.

She met keyboardist Jay Wagner on San Francisco&#x27;s Brazilian jazz circuit. Wagner was an original member of the San Francisco-based group Viva Brasil. She joined Viva Brasil part-time in 1988 as a guitarist and background vocalist. Cooling&#x27;s and Wagner&#x27;s chemistry and passion for songwriting resulted in their first collaboration, &quot;Cameo&quot; (1989), recorded with members of Viva Brasil.

Cooling and Wagner formed a band in 1990, performing and recording for the next six years. By 1996 they had completed their second self-produced album, &quot;Person2Person&quot;. The album came to the attention of Heads Up International, which signed the duo to a two-record deal. They added four additional tracks and renamed the album &quot;Playing It Cool&quot;. The album was released internationally in the fall of 1997. Cooling&#x27;s second Heads Up album, &quot;Keeping Cool&quot;, was released in the spring of 1999. In 2000, Cooling and Wagner signed with GRP/Verve Music Group and released their fourth album, &quot;Third Wish&quot;, on September 11, 2001. In October 2001, Cooling recorded &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; with Lee Ritenour for the 2001 GRP holiday compilation &quot;Making Spirits Bright&quot;. Cooling and Wagner&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;This Girl&#x27;s Got to Play&quot;, was released by Narada.

Cooling&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;Revolving Door&quot;, was released by Narada Jazz when it merged with Blue Note in 2006. Although Cooling had been a member of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), she became a national advocate for the organization with &quot;Revolving Door&quot;. She has performed at NAMI national and regional events across the country. She and Wagner donate a portion of the proceeds from the sale of their albums to NAMI.

They released their song &quot;It&#x27;s Feeling Like Christmas&quot; in 2008 with an accompanying music video produced by Progressive Pulse.

<text>David Charles Davies (11 May 182626 September 1891) was a Welsh Nonconformist minister.

==Life==
He was born at Aberystwyth, his father being a merchant and a pioneer of Welsh Methodism, and his mother a niece of Thomas Charles of Bala. He was educated in his native town by a noted schoolmaster, John Evans, at Bala College, and at University College, London, where he graduated B.A. in 1847 and M.A. (in mathematics) in 1849. He had already begun to preach, and after an evangelistic tour in South Wales supplied the pulpit of the English presbyterian church at Newtown for six months, and settled as pastor of the bilingual church at Builth in 1851. He returned to this charge after a pastorate at Liverpool (1853–1856), left it again in 1858 for Newtown, and went in May 1859 to the Welsh church at Jewin Crescent, London. Here he remained until 1876, and from that date till 1882, although living at Bangor for reasons of health, had the chief oversight of the church.

In 1888 he accepted the principalship of the Calvinistic Methodist College at Trefeca in Brecknockshire. His work here was successful, but short; he died at Bangor in 1891, and was buried at Aberystwyth.

Though Davies stood somewhat apart from the main currents of thought both without and within his church, and was largely unknown to English audiences or readers, he exercised a strong influence on Welsh life and thought in the 19th century. He was a serious student, especially of anti-theistic positions, a good speaker, and a frequent contributor to Welsh theological journals. Several of his articles have been collected and published, the most noteworthy being expositions on the &quot;First Epistle of John&quot; (1889), &quot;Ephesians&quot; (2 vols., 1896, 1901), &quot;Psalms&quot; (1897), &quot;Romans&quot; (1902); and &quot;The Atonement and Intercession of Christ&quot; (1899, English trans. by D. E. Jenkins, 1901).

<text>Douglas MacLeod Gourlay (born December 1, 1929) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1977 to 1986, and was a cabinet minister in the government of Sterling Lyon.

Gourlay was born in 1929 in Brandon, Manitoba. The son of Andrew Jackson Gourlay and Catherine Macleod Rammage, he was educated at the University of Manitoba (receiving a Bachelor of Science degree in 1952), the University of Arizona and the University of Colorado. He served as with the Federal Department of Citizenship and Immigration from 1952 to 1956, and later worked as an agrologist. In 1952, Gourlay married Audrey May Porter.

Gourlay served as a councillor for the Town of Swan River in mid-northern Manitoba between 1972 and 1975, and was its Mayor from 1975 to 1977. He was also a member of the Manitoba Institute of Agrologists during this period.

He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1977, narrowly defeating New Democratic Party candidate Leonard Harapiak in Swan River. He was not initially called to serve in Lyon&#x27;s cabinet, but was named Minister of Municipal Affairs and Minister of Northern Affairs, with responsibility for the Communities Economic Development Fund on November 15, 1979.

The Tories were defeated in the 1981 provincial election, although Gourlay again defeated Harapiak by a narrow margin. He narrowly lost to Harapiak by 65 votes in their third encounter, in the provincial election of 1986. He has not sought a return to politics since this time.

In 1995, Gourlay became president and CEO of Montex Holding Company.

<text>Richard Davies (c. 15057 November 1581) was a Welsh bishop and scholar.

==Life==
He was born in north Wales, and was educated at New Inn Hall, Oxford, becoming vicar of Maids Moreton in Buckinghamshire in 1549, and then Burnham, Buckinghamshire, in 1550.

Being a reformer he took refuge at Geneva during the reign of Mary, returning to England and to parochial work after the accession of Elizabeth in 1558. His connection with Wales was renewed almost at once; for, after serving on a commission which visited the Welsh dioceses, he was, in January 1560, consecrated bishop of St Asaph, whence he was translated, early in 1561, to the bishopric of St David&#x27;s. As a bishop, Davies was an earnest reformer, very industrious, active and liberal, but not very scrupulous with regard to the property of the church.

He was a member of the Council of Wales and the Marches, was very friendly with Matthew Parker, archbishop of Canterbury, and was regarded both by Parker and by William Cecil, Lord Burghley, as a trustworthy adviser on Welsh concerns. Famous for his oratory abilities, he was renowned for having an embarrassing speech impediment which earned him the affectionate nickname of Biffe.The nickname Biffe derived from the ancient Celtic word for fool from which we now take the word buffoon. Another of the bishops friends was Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex. Assisting William Salesbury, Davies took part in translating the New Testament into Welsh, and also did some work on the Welsh translation of the Book of Common Prayer. He helped to revise the Bishops&#x27; Bible of 1568, being himself responsible for the book of Deuteronomy, and the second book of Samuel. He died in November 1581, and was buried in Abergwili church.

<text>Franklin Avenue station is a light rail station on the Blue Line in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

This station is a bridge above Franklin Avenue along Minnesota State Highway 55, in Minneapolis. This is a center-platform station. Along with the Lake Street station, Franklin Avenue is one of the two above-grade stations on the Blue Line. The station is home to the marquee of the New Franklin theater, located nearby. Service began at this station when the Blue Line opened on June 26, 2004.

The maintenance base of the line is just to the north, between this stop and Cedar-Riverside. When train operators begin and end their shifts, they used to make an extra stop there to take on the new driver. The driver now boards and departs the train at Franklin Avenue station.

A transit-oriented development master plan for the station and Cedar-Riverside was released in 2002.

In September 2022, unarmed private security hired by the Metropolitan Council began patrolling the station. The station was chosen because of high police activity and because it is a location where train operators get on and off trains. Allied Universal was hired in March 2023 to patrol the station 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Franklin Avenue is one of four stations that Metro Transit is analyzing in a several million dollar study to determine if turnstiles can improve fare payment compliance and safety.

==Bus connections==
From Franklin Avenue Station, there is a direct connection to routes 2, 9, and 67. Route 22 stops just a block away.

<doc id="1310952" wikidata="Q3122789" url="?curid=1310952" title="The Sundays">
<text>The Sundays were an English alternative rock band, formed in Bristol. The band&#x27;s lineup consisted of lead vocalist Harriet Wheeler, guitarist David Gavurin, bassist Paul Brindley, and drummer Patrick Hannan. Percussionist Lindsay Jamieson was a member from 1990 until 1992, and played on the band&#x27;s first two albums. 

Having met while attending Bristol University, Wheeler and Gavurin formed the band in 1988. Wheeler had played gigs with Cruel Shoes, an early incarnation of the band Jim Jiminee. The duo soon augmented the band with bassist Paul Brindley and drummer Patrick Hannan.

The Sundays secured a recording contract with Rough Trade Records. Their debut single was &quot;Can&#x27;t Be Sure&quot;. Their first album, &quot;Reading, Writing and Arithmetic&quot;, was released in 1990 and became a UK top 5 hit. The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Here&#x27;s Where the Story Ends&quot; was a number one hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart in the United States.

With Rough Trade&#x27;s financial troubles and the band&#x27;s decision to manage themselves, the Sundays&#x27; next single, &quot;Goodbye&quot;, did not emerge until 1992. Their next album, &quot;Blind&quot;, arrived the same year, reaching the UK top 15. The single &quot;Love&quot; reached number 2 on the US Modern Rock charts. The band toured in support of these recordings.

In 1997, their third album, &quot;Static &amp; Silence&quot;, was followed by the release of their most successful single, &quot;Summertime&quot;, which made the UK top 15. The album itself reached the UK top 10. However, the band has been on a lengthy hiatus since those releases, with Wheeler and Gavurin focusing on raising their two children; Wheeler and Gavurin married after the band breakup. Since their disbandment, the band have gained a cult following. 

==History==
===1988: Formation===
Vocalist Harriet Wheeler and guitarist David Gavurin met as students at Bristol University in the mid-1980s. Wheeler was from Reading, the daughter of an architect and a teacher, and studied English literature. Gavurin was from Wembley and actively pursued a degree in the Romance languages, particularly French and Spanish. The two fell in love and began living together. Following graduation they wrote music in their free time while collecting unemployment benefits. Except for Wheeler&#x27;s vocal duties in a band called Jim Jiminee, the couple had no musical background. Commenting on his desire to compose, Gavurin said, &quot;It was something I&#x27;d always wanted to do, although I never wanted to be in a band when I was younger, like many kids do. It just dawned on me gradually.&quot; Wheeler displayed similar feelings: &quot;There was never a time I wanted to be incredibly famous, or in a pop group,&quot; she said. &quot;It just seemed a great thing to do to spend time working on something that&#x27;s your own.&quot;

After the couple completed several songs – and migrated to London – they enlisted the support of bassist Paul Brindley and drummer Patrick Hannan, who had also attended Bristol University. Hannan&#x27;s brother, Nick, had also been a member of Jim Jiminee, which briefly featured Wheeler as vocalist (see paragraph above). The band chose the name &quot;The Sundays&quot; as it was the only one everyone could agree upon. Demo tapes were sent out to several London clubs after the group felt energized by their efforts; Gavurin stated in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview that &quot;by the end of the year we were thinking, &#x27;Hang on a minute, some of this [music] is good!&#x27;&quot; Responses to the tape were enthusiastic and an employee at Vertigo Club offered the band an opening slot for an upcoming show in August 1988. &quot;By chance there were three reviewers from the top music papers there,&quot; said Wheeler. &quot;They were supposed to review the main band, but instead they wrote about us.&quot; The group subsequently became the focus of a record label bidding war. They eventually signed with Rough Trade Records and had a distribution deal signed for the United States with DGC Records.

===1989–1990: &quot;Reading, Writing and Arithmetic&quot;===
The Sundays released their first single &quot;Can&#x27;t Be Sure&quot; in January 1989. It topped the British indie charts and received acclaim as one of the best singles of 1989. The group performed three songs in a session with popular disc jockey John Peel. These songs would later turn up on their debut album, &quot;Reading, Writing and Arithmetic&quot;. The group worked on their debut for over a year. &quot;A lot of bands who get signed, who have been playing the circuit for years, have 30 songs for the first album,&quot; said Gavurin. &quot;But we didn&#x27;t have enough for our first album, let alone our second. We can&#x27;t write to deadline. You can&#x27;t force a whole load of songs out quickly.&quot; Asked whether the band felt pressured when working on the album, Wheeler responded, &quot;No, because to start off with, we&#x27;re far more critical of ourselves than anyone else, and that&#x27;s more a concern to us than what the press think.&quot; Gavurin also commented: &quot;The main pressure we felt was with the single, and even then, we thought, well, they&#x27;re either going to like it or they&#x27;re not, and there&#x27;s not much we can do to influence that.&quot;

&quot;Reading, Writing and Arithmetic&quot; was released in January 1990 and became a commercial success, reaching number 4 on the UK charts and peaking at number 39 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the United States. It went on to sell over half a million copies worldwide. Its distinct Englishness in lyrics, augmented by Harriet Wheeler&#x27;s accent, alongside their lighter-than-air guitar pop, influenced the nascent Britpop scene, notably impacting bands like Sleeper. The hit single &quot;Here&#x27;s Where the Story Ends&quot; also gained considerable success in the USA, propelled by extensive radio play and MTV rotation. The Sundays devoted nearly a year to an &quot;exhausting&quot; promotional tour, which encompassed America, Europe, and Japan. The tour was considered successful, although it was not without some mishaps; a London show had to be rescheduled due to Wheeler losing her voice and the group experienced some amusement when a Dallas, Texas, show was advertised with the slogan &quot;See The Sundays on Sunday with ice-cream sundaes&quot;.

===1991–1993: &quot;Blind&quot;===
The band experienced some hardships leading up to the recording of their second album. In 1991 Rough Trade Records went bankrupt, which caused the band to sign with Parlophone Records in the UK. Their debut went out of print in the UK and would stay that way until 1996. Constant touring coupled with their decision to manage themselves hampered the group&#x27;s creative output, which was already slow due to Gavurin and Wheeler, the main songwriters, &quot;being chained by pokiness and perfectionism when it [came] to writing and recording music.&quot; Additionally, the band kept a &quot;low public profile&quot;, which fuelled rumours that the group had disbanded. The Sundays eventually released a new single, &quot;Goodbye&quot;, a minor hit, in Autumn 1992. The release came almost three years after their last UK show. The &quot;Goodbye&quot; B-side, a cover of The Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Wild Horses&quot;, also appeared on the US release of &quot;Blind&quot; as well as in the movie &quot;Fear&quot; (1996), on the 1999 soundtrack album for the popular television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, and in the episode 01x01 of the series &quot;Friends from College&quot; (2017).

Their next album, entitled &quot;Blind,&quot; was finally released in October 1992. The album experienced commercial success similar to their debut when it peaked at number 103 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and sold nearly half a million copies. Critical reception was also positive, but some critics thought the album lacked the quality songwriting of its predecessor. Despite &quot;Blind&#x27;s&quot; initial appeal with audiences, it drifted off the charts by the summer of 1993. The Sundays toured Britain in the winter of 1992. The shows were &quot;rapturously received by fans starved of fresh product or gigs.&quot; An American tour was greeted with sold-out shows. Gavurin explained that they weren&#x27;t necessarily attempting to promote the new album: &quot;A lot of people didn&#x27;t see us the first time we played over here, and they want to hear earlier material. So we&#x27;re playing half and half.&quot; In the end the tour was cut short in light of exhaustion and homesickness.

===1994–1997: &quot;Static and Silence&quot;===
The band holidayed in Thailand and, upon returning to England, &quot;put their music career on the back burner for a time.&quot; During this time the only appearance of the band was their cover of &quot;Wild Horses&quot; by The Rolling Stones appearing in a 1994 American Budweiser television commercial. Gavurin and Wheeler expressed a desire to settle down. Wheeler gave birth to the couple&#x27;s daughter, Billie, in March 1995. They also built a recording studio in their home, not only to save on the cost of renting a studio, but also to expand their creative freedoms. Their third, and most recent album, &quot;Static &amp; Silence&quot;, was released to mixed reviews in September 1997, a full five years after &quot;Blind&quot;. Although the band retained much of the same sound that they developed on previous albums, they added horns to a number of tracks for &quot;Static &amp; Silence&quot;. The album was not as successful as &quot;Reading, Writing and Arithmetic&quot;; however, the single &quot;Summertime&quot; became their most successful hit to date on the UK chart and achieved a top 10 spot on the US Alternative Rock chart. It was The Sundays&#x27; third most successful single in the US, behind &quot;Here&#x27;s Where the Story Ends&quot; (which made it to number 1 on the US Alternative Rock chart) and &quot;Love&quot; (which made it to number 2).

===2014: Possible return===
In April 2014, Adam Pitluk, the editor of American Airlines&#x27; magazine &quot;American Way&quot;, tracked down and conducted an interview with Wheeler and Gavurin in which he put forward the idea of a reunion. They responded, &quot;First let&#x27;s see if the music we’re currently writing ever sees the light of day, and then we can get on to the enjoyable globe-trotting-meets-concert-planning stage.&quot;

On 10 October 2014, during an interview on BBC Radio 6 Music&#x27;s &quot;Radcliffe &amp; Maconie&quot; radio programme, David Baddiel described Dave Gavurin as his &quot;oldest mate&quot; and stated that &quot;they [Dave and Harriet] are doing music, but whether they ever put that out there, I’ve no idea. They&#x27;re the most paranoid people about actually putting stuff out there&quot;.

In an interview with the C86 Show Podcast released on August 18, 2020, Patrick Hannan revealed that Wheeler and Gavurin had &quot;never stopped making music&quot; and that he had played drums on a number of their tracks. Hannan added that these recordings may never be released.

<doc id="1310954" wikidata="Q748410" url="?curid=1310954" title="Texas horned lizard">
<text>The Texas horned lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum) is one of about 21 North American species of spikey-bodied reptiles called horned lizards, all belonging the genus &quot;Phrynosoma&quot;. It occurs in south-central regions of the US and northeastern Mexico, as well as several isolated introduced records and populations from Southern United States. Though some populations are stable, severe population declines have occurred in many areas of Texas and Oklahoma. The Texas spiny lizard (&quot;Sceloporus olivaceus&quot;) may be confused for a Texas horned lizard due to its appearance and overlapping habitat. Because the Texas horned lizard is listed as a threatened species in the state, it is illegal to pick up, touch, or possess them in Texas.

==Etymology==

The horned lizard is popularly called a &quot;horned toad&quot;, &quot;horny toad&quot;, or &quot;horned frog&quot;, but it is neither a toad nor a frog. The popular names come from the lizard&#x27;s rounded body and blunt snout, which give it a decidedly batrachian appearance. &quot;Phrynosoma&quot; literally means &quot;toad-bodied&quot; and &quot;cornutum&quot; means &quot;horned&quot;. The lizard&#x27;s horns are extensions of its cranium and contain true bone.

==Description==
The Texas horned lizard is the largest-bodied and most widely distributed of the roughly 21 species of horned lizards in the western United States and Mexico. The Texas horned lizard exhibits sexual dimorphism, with the females being larger with a snout-vent length of around , whereas the males reach around . &quot;Phrynosoma cornutum&quot; has characteristic horns spanning across its body with the two largest crowning its head, two more on its brows and jawline respectively, as well as lines of spikes spanning the lateral parts of torso and dorsal ridges of the back. Coloration varies depending on the environment in order to blend in with the color of the ground, ranging from a yellow or reddish-brown for deserts to a tannish brown for prairies. They also 
have dark lines that span from the eyes to the tip of the horns and a characteristic solid white line with a few black circular splotches on either side.

==Distribution==
The Texas horned lizard, like all members of the genus &quot;Phrynosoma&quot;, is endemic to North America where it occurs in south-central regions of the US and northeastern Mexico. Its natural distribution includes southeast Colorado, central and southern areas of Kansas, central and western areas of Oklahoma and Texas, southeast New Mexico, and extreme southeast Arizona. In Mexico it occurs in extreme eastern Sonora, most of Chihuahua, northeast Durango, northern Zacatecas and San Luis Potosí, and throughout most of Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas. It is known from barrier islands on the Gulf Coast of Texas and Tamaulipas at sea level, up to about 1,830 meters elevation. It is absent for higher elevations within its range, where other species of the genus may occur (e.g. Sierra Madre Oriental). Ecological associations include the southern Great Plains, Edwards Plateau, Tamaulipan mezquital, Chihuahua Desert, Llanos el Salado, and many peripheral and marginal areas of these ecoregions. The eastern distributional limit of the Texas horned lizard in the piney woods region of east Texas and western Louisiana, and the Ozark Mountain forests of western Arkansas, and Missouri likely represent introductions however, some have argued these records reflect natural relic populations.

Many records of introductions from areas beyond its natural range have been reported as a result of released and escaped individuals from the pet trade in the early and mid-twentieth century, including: Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wyoming, although these do not represent established, breeding populations. However, a few stable populations, some known for over 50 years, occur in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, but these do not seem to be dispersing or spreading.

==Behavior==
 Despite the fierce appearance, Texas horned lizards are extremely docile creatures. The Texas horned lizard is a sunbather, and requires bright sunlight to produce vitamin D. Deprived of sunlight, the animal is unable to produce vitamin D and can suffer from vitamin deficiency. So, horned lizards are most often found along the side of roads or other open, rocky areas, where they can lounge and take in sunlight. At night, the lizard buries itself in sand. Although they prefer to move very little, horned lizards can move quite fast if they feel a predator is in the area, and dart into thick grass and foliage to escape. Horned lizards are also excellent diggers, and can quickly burrow underground to escape threats. Horned lizards are often found near harvester ant colonies which are a major part of their diet. Their daily movement is averaged at . They hibernate in burrows averaging in depth at and often have them face south/southwest for maximum sun exposure.

Although its coloration generally serves as camouflage against predation, when threatened by a predator, a horned lizard puffs up and appears very fat, which causes its body scales to protrude, making it difficult to swallow. The Texas horned lizard, along with at least three other species of the genus &quot;Phrynosoma&quot;, also has the ability to squirt an aimed stream of blood from the corners of the eyes and sometimes from its mouth at a distance up to . They do this by restricting the blood flow leaving the head, thereby increasing blood pressure and rupturing tiny vessels around the eyelids. This not only confuses would-be predators, but also the blood is mixed with a chemical that is foul-tasting to canine predators such as wolves, coyotes, and domestic dogs. This novel behavior is generally observed to be very effective in defense; however, it appears to have no effect against predatory birds. They can lose up to 6 percent of their body weight when performing this.

==Diet and decline==

About 70% of the Texas horned lizard&#x27;s diet is made up of harvester ants, though they supplement these with termites, beetles, and grasshoppers. Texas horned lizards possess a blood plasma factor that neutralizes harvester ant venom and are known to produce copious amounts of mucus in the esophagus and pharynx which function to embed and incapacitate swallowed ants. In recent years, the species has declined by about 30% of its range, though it may be making a comeback. The decline is usually blamed on overuse of pesticides and the spread of nonnative, highly aggressive and fiercely territorial red imported fire ants. Both eradicate harvester ant colonies, destroying the lizard&#x27;s principal source of food. The Texas horned lizard is now a protected species, and, in Texas, it is illegal to take, possess, transport or sell them without a special permit.

A University of Texas publication notes that horned lizard populations continue to disappear throughout the southwest despite protective legislation. The Texas horned lizard has disappeared from almost half of its geographic range. Population declines are attributed to loss of habitat, human eradication of the ant populations upon which the lizards prey, displacement of native ant populations by invading fire ants (aided by synergistic effects of native ant eradication), and predation by domestic dogs and cats.

In 2014, the Center for Biological Diversity in Tucson, Arizona petitioned the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation to have the Texas horned lizard put on the endangered species list due to the massive decline of its population in Oklahoma, where it was once plentiful. The Center said it may later seek protection for the animal on a Federal level; it also said that reptiles in general are dying off at up to 10,000 times their historic extinction rate, greatly due to human influences.

In Texas, the creature has been declared threatened and a breeding and reintroduction program has been started by the Fort Worth Zoo. Hatchlings are bred and released in targeted areas in the hope that with a large number of animals, enough will survive to grow the population in the wild. Typically in such reptile reintroduction programs, fewer than one percent of a female&#x27;s offspring will survive in the wild to adulthood.

==Current research==
Horned lizards are studied by researchers at Texas Christian University, the nearby Fort Worth Zoo, and Dallas Zoo with raw data and fieldwork done by state employees. Since 2010, the Dallas Zoo has been conducting a mark-and-recapture study on Texas horned lizards on the Rolling Plains Quail Research Ranch, a preserve located in Fisher County, Texas. Dallas Zoo researchers capture animals, tag them, collect data, and release them. The project&#x27;s goals are aimed at shedding light on the life history, population density, and determining ecological conditions best suited for this threatened species. Further research toward their preservation is funded by sale of horned lizard &quot;Keep Texas Wild&quot; license plates.

In addition, the Dallas Zoo and Houston Zoo are working to establish a captive colony of animals with several key reproductive successes taking place in 2015.

==In Native American religion and art==
Some Native American people regard horned lizards as sacred. The animal is a common motif in Native American art in the Southwestern United States and Mexico.

==In popular culture==
The Texas horned lizard is the state reptile of Texas and, as the &quot;horned frog&quot;, is the mascot of Texas Christian University and can be seen in the university&#x27;s seal.

<text>Harry Edward Graham (December 26, 1921 in Foxwarren, Manitoba – September 21, 2006 in Russell, Manitoba) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served as a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1969 to 1986.

The son of George Malcolm Graham and Margaret Leckie, he was educated at the University of Manitoba, and worked as a farmer after his graduation. Graham served as Vice-Chairman of the Russell District Hospital, and was also the President of the Progressive Conservative Association in the federal riding of Marquette. In 1951, he married Velma Louise Murdoch.

He first entered politics while helping a friend, Dr. Vern Rosnoski, who was a dentist, run for office. After Rosnoski couldn&#x27;t find a dentist to take over his practice who could use left-handed tools, Graham ran in his place.

He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in a by-election on February 20, 1969, defeating Liberal Edward Shust in the riding of Birtle-Russell. The riding had previously been held by the Liberals, and Graham&#x27;s victory provided an impetus for Progressive Conservative Premier Walter Weir to call a general election later in the year.

The Tories lost government to the New Democratic Party in this election, and Graham nearly lost his own seat to NDP candidate Donald Kostesky. He was re-elected again by a slightly greater margin in the 1973 election, which the NDP also won.

The Progressive Conservatives returned to power in the 1977 election under Sterling Lyon, as Graham again narrowly increased his margin of victory in Birtle-Russell. He was not appointed to cabinet, but rather served as the Speaker of the legislature from November 24, 1977 until 1981.

In 1980, Graham presided over the temporary expulsion from the legislature of Robert Wilson, who had been convicted of a criminal offence. Wilson was permanently expelled in 1981.

Graham won the easiest re-election victory of his career in the election of 1981, running in the redistributed riding of Virden. Ironically, this occurred as the PCs lost government to the NDP. Graham served as an opposition member of the Legislative Assembly for the next five years, and did not seek re-election in 1986.

He died at Russell District Hospital after a lengthy illness.

<text>Andrew Jackson Davis (August 11, 1826January 13, 1910) was an American Spiritualist, born in Blooming Grove, New York.

== Early years ==
Davis was the son of a shoemaker and had little education. From age 14, Davis claimed to be able to diagnose illness via clairvoyance. In 1843 he heard lectures in Poughkeepsie on animal magnetism, the precursor of hypnotism, and came to perceive himself as having remarkable clairvoyant powers. In the following year he received, he said, spiritual messages telling him of his life work. He described himself as &quot;the Poughkeepsie Seer&quot;.

== Work ==
For the next three years (1844–1847) he practiced magnetic healing, a form of therapy regarded as pseudoscience, and in 1847 he published &quot;The Principles of Nature, Her Divine Revelations, and a Voice to Mankind&quot;, which in 1845 he had dictated while in a trance to his scribe, William Fishbough. He lectured with little success and returned to writing books, publishing about 30 in all, including
* &quot;The Principles of Nature, Her Divine Revelations, and a Voice to Mankind.&quot; (1847).
* &quot;The Great Harmonia&quot; (1850–1861), an encyclopaedia in six volumes;
* &quot;The Philosophy of Special Providences&quot; (1850), which with its evident rehash of old arguments against special providences and miracles would seem to show that Davis&#x27;s inspiration was literary;
* &quot;The Philosophy of Spiritual Intercourse; Being an Explanation of Modern Mysteries.&quot; (1851).
* &quot;The Present Age and Inner Life; a Sequel to Spiritual Intercourse, Modern Mysteries Classified and Explained.&quot; (1853).
* &quot;The Penetralia; Being Harmonial Answers to Important Questions&quot; (1856), which allegedly predicted the development of the automobile, road systems, typewriter, and other modern technology years if not decades before they were developed, and claimed the speed of light was 200,000 miles per second 94 years before it was scientifically calculated by Louis Essen showing the true speed was 186,000 miles per second. 
* &quot;The Magic Staff: An Autobiography&quot; (1857), which was supplemented by &quot;Arabula: or, The Divine Guest. Containing a New Collection of New Gospels&quot; (1867), the gospels being those according to St. Confucius, St. John (John Greenleaf Whittier), St. Gabriel (Gabriel Derzhavin), St. Octavius (Octavius Frothingham), St. Gerrit (Gerrit Smith), St. Emma (Emma Harding), St. Ralph (Ralph Waldo Emerson), St. Selden (Selden J. Finney), St. Theodore (Theodore Parker), and others;
* &quot;A Stellar Key to the Summer Land&quot; (1868);
* &quot;Tale of a Physician, or, The Seeds and Fruits of Crime&quot; (1869) 
* &quot;The Fountain with Jets of New Meanings&quot; (1870)
* &quot;Views of Our Heavenly Home&quot; (1878)

== Influences and legacy ==
Davis was much influenced by Swedenborg and by the Shakers, who reprinted his panegyric praising Ann Lee in the official work &quot;Sketch of Shakers and Shakerism&quot; (1884).

In writing his 1845 short story &quot;The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar&quot;, Edgar Allan Poe was informed by Davis&#x27;s early work after having attended one of his lectures on mesmerism.

Davis&#x27;s complete library is now housed within the Edgar Cayce Library.

Davis described the concept of Summerland as an undefined location where souls go after death, the secular nature of which was attractive to some non-religious spiritualists.

==Critical reception==
In 1855, Davis&#x27; spiritualism received an extensive critical analysis by theologian Asa Mahan: &quot;Modern Mysteries Explained and Exposed. In Four Parts. I. Clairvoyant Revelations of A. J. Davis...&quot; A defender of Davis published an 80-page pamphlet attacking Mahan&#x27;s analysis.

Regarding Davis&#x27; book &quot;The Principles of Nature&quot;, Joseph McCabe has noted &quot;There is no need to examine the book seriously. The scientific errors and crudities of it release any person from considering whether there was any element of revelation in it... Moreover, Davis was a palpable cheat. He maintained that up to that date he had read only one book in his life, and that book was a novel. We know from his admirers that this was not true, and any person can recognize in his pages a very crude and badly digested mess of early scientific literature.&quot; Davis also plagiarised long passages from Swedenborg in &quot;The Principles of Nature&quot;, which some of Davis&#x27;s believers take as proof that Davis was inhabited by Swedenborg.

Physician James Joseph Walsh was unconvinced Davis was a genuine clairvoyant. Walsh wrote that although Davis stated that he had only ever read one novel, this was not true as he had read &quot;Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation&quot; and there was evidence he had read books on sociology.

The spiritualist writings of Davis have been criticized by scientists and skeptics for containing inaccuracies and false information. For example, in one case, Davis seemed unaware that water is a compound of oxygen and hydrogen. Researcher Georgess McHargue pointed out that the supposed &quot;scientific&quot; passages from his writings are filled with &quot;gobbledegook as to put it in the class with the most imaginative vintage science fantasy.&quot;

<doc id="1310964" wikidata="Q684712" url="?curid=1310964" title="John S. Battle">
<text>John Stewart Battle (July 11, 1890 – April 9, 1972) was an American lawyer and politician who served in both houses of the Virginia General Assembly and as the 56th Governor of Virginia (from 1950 to 1954).

==Early and family life==
Battle was born in 1890 in New Bern, Craven County, North Carolina to Rev. Henry Battle and his wife. His paternal grandfather, Alabama lawyer and former Confederate General Cullen Battle, moved to North Carolina when John was a boy and became a newspaper editor as well the mayor of New Bern. He also lectured concerning his wartime experiences and the Lost Cause at various locations in North Carolina and Virginia. General Battle moved in with his son&#x27;s family after his wife died. Rev. Battle moved his family several times during John&#x27;s childhood, including to Petersburg, Virginia. After graduating from high school, John Battle traveled to Asheville, North Carolina and earned an associate&#x27;s degree from Mars Hill College (then a junior college). He then earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Wake Forest University (then a college) and a law degree from the University of Virginia.

==Political career==

Battle won election to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1929, and was re-elected twice to the part-time position. A member of the Byrd Organization, Battle began serving in the Virginia State Senate in 1934, and that part-time service continued until 1949, when he resigned upon winning the gubernatorial election.

With the assistance of Virginia Beach boss Sidney Kellam, Battle defeated &quot;anti&quot; Byrd Organization leader Francis Pickens Miller in the Democratic primary, by depicting him as a liberal and controlled by labor unions, and nearly ignoring his other opponents (Horace Edwards and Petersburg businessman Remmie Arnold). Prominent Republican Henry Wise of the Virginia Eastern Shore even urged his supporters to vote for Battle in the Democratic Party to repel the &quot;invasion by aliens.&quot; Battle won 43% of the vote; Miller 35%, Edwards 15% and Arnold 7%

During his gubernatorial term, Virginia&#x27;s General Assembly approved $45 million for school construction, which barely kept pace with population increases. Per pupil expenditures and teacher salaries remained below national averages, and the state ranked last nationally in percentage of high school age children actually attending high school, and next-to-last in college age children going to college. Virginia also ranked 40th in appropriations to care for the mentally ill.

Battle was a Delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1948, 1952, 1956, 1960, and 1968. When the Virginia delegation was threatened with expulsion at the 1952 Democratic Party national convention for refusing to sign a loyalty oath to whomever the party nominated (U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd often disagreeing with President Harry S Truman), Battle delivered a speech to the convention that forestalled expulsion and helped prevent a split like the Democrats experienced in 1948. In 1956, Battle became the Dixiecrat candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, eventually losing in floor voting to former Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson.

After his term ended in 1954, Battle went into semi retirement in Charlottesville, Virginia, although he continued to practice law, including representing the Albemarle County public schools, who faced a desegregation lawsuit by the NAACP.

Battle&#x27;s political ambitions continued, despite the national spotlight on Virginia and the Massive Resistance declarations by incumbent Senator Harry F. Byrd Sr. after the U.S. Supreme Court decisions in 1954 and 1955 in Brown v. Board of Education. Battle was prepared to run for the U.S. Senate in 1958 if Senator Byrd chose not to run for reelection. Former Governor (and then Congressman) William Tuck had similar ambitions and even more fiery rhetoric, and Byrd chose to run again to avoid the political infighting that would result from a Battle-Tuck primary fight.

In 1959, President Eisenhower called on Battle to serve on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, citing his moderate history on racism.

==Death and legacy==
Battle died in 1972, at the age of 81, and was buried in Monticello Memorial Park in Charlottesville.

His two sons became lawyers and continued their father&#x27;s public involvement: William C. Battle, (1920–2008) became United States Ambassador to Australia and president of the United States Golf Association, as well as the Democratic candidate for Governor of Virginia in 1969. John S. Battle, Jr. (1919–1997) became a Founding Trustee of the Thomas Jefferson Center for Free Expression, as well as served two terms on the Board of Visitors at the University of Virginia (1982–1990).

John S. Battle High School in Washington County, Virginia, built in 1959, bears his name. Battle Hall at the Virginia School for the Deaf and the Blind is also named for the former governor.

==Election==

1949; Battle was elected Governor of Virginia with 70.43% of the vote, defeating Republican Walter Johnson and Social Democrat Clark T. Robb.

<text>The National Liaison Committee for International Students in Australia (NLC) was first formed in 1986 in an attempt to combat the Australian Government&#x27;s introduction of the full-fee paying international students program. Formerly a member of the National Union of Students (Australia), .

==Organisational history==

NLC was formed in 1986, in response to the need for a unified body to voice international students&#x27; concerns especially over the introduction of the user-pay system for international students tuition fee by the Australian government. NLC was the peak representative body in Australia for all international students. It stood for quality education, equitable welfare and multicultural understanding. Until 2009, it was recognised as the national representative body for international students by the Australia Federal Government. In 2009 the leadership of the NLC was expelled from the NUS. This in turn caused the NLC to lose recognition from peak education bodies (Universities Australia, ACPET, TAFE Directors Australia, and English Australia), Federal and State Governments and education providers.

NLC was officially incorporated in 1998 and its official legal name is National Liaison Committee for International Students in Australia Inc. Until 2009 the NLC worked in conjunction with National Union of Students of Australia and fulfilled its role as a peak representative organisation by taking the role of the International Students Committee of the National Union of Students of Australia (NUS).

The NLC had developed strong relationships with many stakeholders in the international education industry. These included, Australian Education International (AEI), IDP Education Australia, State Government Education Departments, International Student Adviser Network Australia (ISANA), all four OSHC providers, National Tertiary Education Union, Australian Vice-Chancellors&#x27; Committee, IELTS, English Australia, and most international education departments throughout Australian Universities. Since 2009 many of these relationships have been fundamentally compromised.

The NLC had helped to achieve changes in the international education industry over between 1986 and 2009. These included the deregulation of the overseas student health cover industry, contributions to the ESOS Act reviews in 2006, 2000, 2004 and in 1996, changes to immigration regulations, such as extensions of sunset clauses on permanent residency changes. In 2008 the NLC was currently working on re introducing public transport concession for international students in NSW and Victoria and ensuring quality education.

The NLC had 42 affiliated university campus international student organisations, from 31 public and 2 private universities, and drew its membership primarily from university students, claiming a representation of 303,000 international students in Australia. It contributed to Federal and State Government inquiries and processes into changing and improving international education in Australia.

However, as of 2013, New South Wales Premier along with New South Wales Police Department, 11 universities and NSW Museum issues a warning regards NLC and its OSA activities. They have been accused of collecting personal data from student which is considered illegal. Their current website have been taken down as a result.

== Stance ==

The NLC has been critical of increasing exploitation of full fee paying international students, describing the current international student issues as having begun in 1986 with the introduction of full fees, and claiming that students are exploited in abusive visa schemes which do not result in real educational benefits. The NLC has also criticised the formation of student ghettos due to the poor integration of international and domestic students in Universities and the lack of welfare support for international students causing the development of in-group peer reliance structures. According to Eric Pang in 2008, then the president of the NLC, many international students had claimed &quot;There&#x27;s not much international students can learn from Australia in terms of culture, or in terms of English. After all, the standard of English of Australian students is not high anyway.&quot;

===2009===

In 2009 the NLC was accused of bullying, was forcibly disaffiliated from the NUS, and recognition has been refused by the University of New South Wales and the University of Sydney. Later in 2009 other international student groups, the Australian Federation of International Students and the Federation of Indian Students of Australia claimed that the NLC had made legal threats regarding their operation in Victoria.

===2013===

In 2013, NSW Premier issued warning regards NLC and its sub group OSA, stating that they have been involved taking private data from student illegally. NSW Office of Fair Trading has also launched an investigation about the bogus &quot;SafetyCard&quot; issued by NLC, about the non-existent discount in public services and extra protection from police. As a result, their website, which contain the infringed NSW government logo and NSW Police logo have been taken down.

<text>Ólafur Ingi Skúlason (born 1 April 1983) is an Icelandic former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. He is the manager of Iceland national under-19 football team and the Iceland national under-15 women&#x27;s team.

==Club career==
Ólafur was born in Reykjavík, Iceland, where he played for Fylkir. After the Icelandic season had come to a close, he was looking for new employment, and found it with Arsenal on 1 July 2001. Ólafur was loaned back to Fylkir over a part of the 2003 season, and was voted the best young player in the Icelandic league 2003.

His Arsenal debut came on 2 December 2003 in a 5–1 defeat of Wolverhampton Wanderers, replacing Justin Hoyte after 55 minutes of the match. Ólafur was released by Arsenal on 28 May 2005. He signed for Brentford on 22 June 2005. Upon his arrival at Brentford, the club&#x27;s website quoted him as saying: &quot;I look at this as a very important move for my career, knowing that manager Martin Allen had been interested in signing me for a while was a huge compliment for me.&quot;

In the second game of the 2005–06 season, Ólafur suffered a cruciate and medial ligament injury resulting from a tackle with Chesterfield&#x27;s Derek Niven, which ruled him out for the rest of the season. He was passed fit for the start of the 2006–07 season and completed his comeback by scoring the winner in a 1–0 win over Blackpool, the first game of the season. He signed for Helsingborgs IF on 21 February 2007. After three successful years in Helsingborg, Ólafur turned down a new contract offer and signed for Danish team SønderjyskE on 6 December 2009.

A year later Ólafur signed for Zulte Waregem in Belgium and stayed there for four years. He then plied his trade in Turkey for a few years before returning to Fylkir.

Ólafur returned to former club Fylkir in 2018.

==International career==
Ólafur earned his first cap for Iceland in a friendly against Mexico on 20 November 2003 as a substitute, replacing Veigar Páll Gunnarsson. He has also captained their U21 team.

Although playing almost 30 international games for over ten years, Ólafur never quite managed to become a regular first team member of the Icelandic team. He was, however, a useful squad member and played three games as a substitute in Iceland&#x27;s successful qualification for Euro 2016, including Iceland&#x27;s famous win over the Netherlands in Amsterdam. He was not selected for Iceland&#x27;s Euro 2016 team.

In May 2018 he was named in Iceland&#x27;s 23-man squad for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.

<text>A reciprocating compressor or piston compressor is a positive-displacement compressor that uses pistons driven by a crankshaft to deliver gases at high pressure. Pressures of up to 5,000 psig are commonly produced by multistage reciprocating compressors.

The intake gas enters the suction manifold, then flows into the compression cylinder where it gets compressed by a piston driven in a reciprocating motion via a crankshaft, and is then discharged. Applications include railway and road vehicle air brake systems oil refineries, gas pipelines, oil and gas production drilling and well services, air and nitrogen injection, offshore platforms, chemical plants, natural gas processing plants, air conditioning, and refrigeration plants. One specialty application is the blowing of plastic bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET).

<doc id="1310973" wikidata="Q1657393" url="?curid=1310973" title="Electroejaculation">
<text>Electroejaculation is a procedure used to obtain semen samples from sexually mature male mammals. The procedure is used for breeding programs and research purposes in various species, as well as in the treatment of ejaculatory dysfunction in human males. This procedure is used frequently with large mammals, particularly bulls and some domestic animals, as well as humans who have certain types of anejaculation. Electroejaculation has also been used for the cryoconservation of animal genetic resources, where semen is stored in low temperatures with the intent of conserving genetic material and future revival.

In the practice of veterinary medicine and animal science, it is common to collect semen from domestic ruminants using electro-ejaculation without sedation or anesthesia. Only in goats is mild sedation sometimes used. Because of the significant skeletal muscle contractions it causes, electroejaculation is not used in stallions — except in rare cases, under general anesthesia.

In humans, electroejaculation is usually carried out under a general anesthetic. An electric probe is inserted into the rectum adjacent to the prostate gland. The probe delivers an AC voltage, usually 12–24 volts sine wave at a frequency of 60 Hz, with a current limited to usually 500 mA, although some devices can generate currents of up to 1 A. The probe is activated for 1–2 seconds, referred to as a stimulus cycle. Ejaculation usually occurs after 2–3 stimulus cycles. Care must be taken when using currents greater than 500 mA, as tissue burns may result due to heating of the probe. The electric current stimulates nearby nerves, resulting in contraction of the pelvic muscles and ejaculation.

==Variant names==
* Rectal electroejaculation (REE)
* Trans-rectal electro-ejaculation (TREE)

== Application to endangered species conservation ==
The procedure has been adopted and modified as an assisted reproduction technique for managing endangered species, to ensure the production of offspring from incompatible pairs of animals where artificial insemination is feasible. 

== Other uses ==
Electroejaculation may also be used for posthumous sperm retrieval in brain-dead humans.

<text>Charles Harold Davis (7 January 1856 – 5 August 1933) was an American landscape painter.

==Biography==
He was born at Amesbury, Massachusetts. A pupil of the schools of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, he was sent to Paris in 1880. Having studied at the Académie Julian under Jules Joseph Lefebvre and Gustave Boulanger, he went to Barbizon and painted much in the forest of Fontainebleau under the traditions of the men of thirty.
In 1890, Davis returned to the U.S., settling in Mystic, Connecticut. He shifted to Impressionism in his style, and took up the cloudscapes for which he became best-known. He eventually became a leading figure in the art colony that had developed in Mystic, and founded the Mystic Art Association in 1913.

He became a full member of the National Academy of Design in 1906, and received many awards, including a silver medal at the Paris Exhibition of 1889.

He is represented by important works in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington; the Pennsylvania Academy, Philadelphia, and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.

<doc id="1310982" wikidata="Q746046" url="?curid=1310982" title="Assyriska FF">
<text>Assyriska Fotbollsföreningen, also known simply as Assyriska FF, is a Swedish football club based in Södertälje, Stockholm County. The club, formed in 1974 by Assyrian immigrants, has advanced through the league system and is currently playing in the fourth highest Swedish league, Division 2. They played in the highest Swedish football league Allsvenskan in 2005 where their games were broadcast in over 80 countries. The club has also played a final in Svenska Cupen, which was lost against IF Elfsborg in 2003.

Assyriska is often viewed as a substitute national team by the Assyrian people.

The club has a fan base from all over the world and has also their own pop song which is called &quot;My Assyrian team – the team of my dream&quot;. A documentary film about Assyriska called &quot;Assyriska: A National Team Without A Nation&quot; was also made in 2006 by Nuri Kino and Erik Sandberg. The success of the documentary film made it possible to win the Golden Palm Award at the Beverly Hills Film Festival.

==History==

Assyriska Föreningen in Södertälje was founded in 1971 by ethnic Assyrian refugees from Turkey who belonged to the Syriac Orthodox Church. Three years later, a football team was started and played its first season in the lowest league in 1975. They advanced through the divisions and reached the second highest league, Division 1 (today replaced by Superettan), in 1992, as the first immigrant team ever. The team was however relegated in 1993, and the next few years, the club played every second year in Division 1 before managing to stay there for more than one season in 1997.

In 2003 Assyriska made it to the final in Svenska Cupen, where they lost with 0–2 against IF Elfsborg. On the way to the final, they won against IFK Göteborg with 4–1 and Djurgårdens IF with 0–4.

They lost a promotion play-off against Örebro SK in 1999, but five years later, in 2004, Assyriska was promoted to Allsvenskan, the highest league, for the first time as Örebro SK was relegated due to economical problems. Assyriska&#x27;s debut in Allsvenskan went well in the beginning and they had a couple of notable wins against big clubs as IFK Göteborg with 0–3 and against IF Elfsborg with 1–3. However Assyriska were relegated after only one season in the Allsvenskan, where they finished last. Since then Assyriska had fallen into Division 1 North, but enjoyed a strong season in 2007 to finish champions and were promoted back into the Superettan.

At the close of the 2009 season Assyriska, having held off the challenge of rivals Syrianska FC to finish third in the Superettan table, faced Djurgårdens IF in a play-off for a place in the Allsvenskan in 2010. Assyriska won the first match at home 2–0 but were overcome 3–0 after extra time in the repeat. In season 2010, Assyriska finished 4th in the Superettan. But 2010 was a season in which football became irrelevant for Assyriska after the murder of player Eddie Moussa.

Since then, the team has made a series of mid-table finishes and remains in the Superettan for the 2013 season.

==Stadium==

Assyriska Föreningen&#x27;s primary stadium since 2006 is Södertälje Fotbollsarena. Until 2006, the team played at the old stadium Bårsta IP.

==Supporters==

Assyriska Föreningen&#x27;s official fan club is called Zelge Fans. They were first started 1993 by a group of Assyriska supporters in Södertälje. They were known as Neshre, which means eagle (or eagles) in Syriac. Three months after they launched, the club changed its name to Zelge Fans, Zelge meaning &quot;sun rays&quot; in Syriac. The sun rays are a symbol of the Assyrian flag, which is where the idea to name the fan club Zelge Fans came from. Most of the members are Assyrians, but the Zelge fan club also has many Swedish members.

Assyriska&#x27;s fans are also growing in numbers as a result of the internet. During its early years, Assyriska did not have the mass means of communication to be able to spread their team information consistently to other mass Assyrian areas (Chicago, New Jersey, California, Toronto, Sydney, etc.). With the tech age, Assyriska has been able to spread its fan base outside of Södertälje and become known in over 80 countries. Acting as their national team, Assyriska represents the entire population of Assyrians throughout the world.

Assyriska has become a true symbol for Assyrians traveling to Sweden. Many make it their goal to watch an Assyriska match at least once when they travel to Sweden.

<doc id="1310997" wikidata="Q5255045" url="?curid=1310997" title="Demand paging">
<text>In computer operating systems, demand paging (as opposed to anticipatory paging) is a method of virtual memory management. In a system that uses demand paging, the operating system copies a disk page into physical memory only when an attempt is made to access it and that page is not already in memory (&quot;i.e.&quot;, if a page fault occurs). It follows that a process begins execution with none of its pages in physical memory, and triggers many page faults until most of its working set of pages are present in physical memory. This is an example of a lazy loading technique.

==Basic concept==
Demand paging only brings pages into memory when an executing process demands them. This is often referred to as lazy loading, as only those pages demanded by the process are swapped from secondary storage to main memory. Contrast this to pure swapping, where all memory for a process is swapped from secondary storage to main memory when the process starts up or resumes execution.

Commonly, to achieve this process a memory management unit is used. The memory management unit maps logical memory to physical memory. Entries in the memory management unit include a bit that indicates whether a page is valid or invalid. A valid page is one that currently resides in main memory. An invalid page is one that currently resides in secondary memory. When a process tries to access a page, the following steps are generally followed:
* Attempt to access page.
* If page is valid (in memory) then continue processing instruction as normal.
* If page is invalid then a page-fault trap occurs.
* Check if the memory reference is a valid reference to a location on secondary memory. If not, the process is terminated (illegal memory access). Otherwise, we have to page in the required page.
* Schedule disk operation to read the desired page into main memory.
* Restart the instruction that was interrupted by the operating system trap.

==Advantages==
Demand paging, as opposed to loading all pages immediately:
* Only loads pages that are demanded by the executing process.
* As there is more space in main memory, more processes can be loaded, reducing the context switching time, which utilizes large amounts of resources.
* Less loading latency occurs at program startup, as less information is accessed from secondary storage and less information is brought into main memory.
* As main memory is expensive compared to secondary memory, this technique helps significantly reduce the bill of material (BOM) cost in smart phones for example. Symbian OS had this feature.

==Disadvantages==
* Individual programs face extra latency when they access a page for the first time.
* Low-cost, low-power embedded systems may not have a memory management unit that supports page replacement.
* Memory management with page replacement algorithms becomes slightly more complex.
* Possible security risks, including vulnerability to timing attacks; see (specifically the virtual memory attack in section 2).
*Thrashing which may occur due to repeated page faults.

<text>Michael William Jordan (born 7 April 1986) is an English retired football goalkeeper born in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. He made seven appearances in the Football League for Chesterfield, having started his career as a trainee at Arsenal. He is currently the goalkeeper coach of Boreham Wood.

==Career==

===Club career===
Jordan signed for Arsenal as a scholar in 2002, turning professional on 1 November 2004 after making impressive performances for the youth team. However, he never played for the Arsenal first team; the closest he came was appearing on the bench for a League Cup match on 9 November 2004 against Everton, a match Arsenal won 3–1.

After trials at Doncaster Rovers, and AFC Bournemouth, Jordan signed for Yeovil Town on 9 March 2006 on a month&#x27;s loan as goalkeeping cover during an injury crisis. The loan was later extended until the end of the season, at which time Yeovil declined to make the deal permanent and the player returned to Arsenal. On 30 June 2006, Arsenal released Jordan.

In July 2006, Jordan was invited for a week&#x27;s trial at League One side Chesterfield by manager Roy McFarland. The trial became a permanent deal, with Jordan playing six times for Chesterfield in the following twelve months. At the end of the 2006–07 season, Jordan signed a contract for a further year, but on 7 March 2008 he left Chesterfield by mutual consent after learning he would not be offered a new contract at the end of the season. He subsequently signed for Conference South side Lewes, and helped them to the league title and automatic promotion to the Conference National.

Following a trial with Stevenage Borough, Jordan spent some weeks with the club but was released without playing for the first team. He joined fellow Conference National club Eastbourne Borough on 29 January 2009 to provide cover for their first-choice goalkeeper. On 5 February, Michael was released from his contract with the Conference club, later joining Southern Premier League team Farnborough. He appeared 64 times in competitive games for them (54 of them in the league), before moving on to join Conference South club Boreham Wood in the summer of 2011. The following summer he was signed by Concord Rangers of Isthmian League Premier Division.

===International career===
Jordan has represented England at under-17 and under-19 levels.

==Coaching career==
He joined Ebbsfleet United as the club&#x27;s goalkeeping coach in the summer of 2016, and later registered as a player in case of emergencies. On 16 November 2018 the club announced, that Jordan had left the club.

On 1 March 2019 it was announced, that Jordan had returned to Boreham Wood, this time as a goalkeeper coach.

<doc id="1311010" wikidata="Q7572477" url="?curid=1311010" title="Space Rogue">
<text>Space Rogue is a space flight simulation video game developed by Origin Systems and published by Origin Systems, Wave Brain, and Night Dive Studios. The game was released in 1989 for Apple II and Commodore 64; the series was later ported to DOS, Macintosh, Amiga, and Atari ST. The game was also released in the Japanese language for PC-9801, X68000, and FM Towns. The FM Towns version had its intro remade with slight animations and new illustrations, along with scrolling Japanese text, and exclusive CD quality background music. Taking place within the Far Arm of the Milky Way galaxy, &quot;Space Rogue&quot;″s main story revolves around the player character″s efforts to pursue a career and undertake long-range goals beyond his immediate mission.

The game features elements of a role-playing game, like the much later &quot;X Rebirth&quot; and &quot;Elite Dangerous&quot;. It is notable for being the first game designed for Origin by Paul Neurath, who went on to found Blue Sky Productions (later renamed Looking Glass Studios).

&quot;Space Rogue&quot; can be considered as the spiritual predecessor to Origin&#x27;s &quot;Wing Commander&quot; series. The press release for &quot;Space Rogue&quot; stated that it is &quot;the first of its kind in science-fiction/3D space flight simulation. An ORIGIN Cinematic Experience&quot;, implying that &quot;Space Rogue&quot; was originally meant to be a series of its own (&#x27;Ultima in Space&#x27;), before later on Origin turned to the &quot;Wing Commander&quot; series instead. In 2016, Night Dive Studios reacquired the rights and re-released it.

== Plot ==
The player takes on the role of a crew member aboard the Princess Blue, who was sent by his captain to investigate a small derelict spacecraft, the Sunracer class Jolly Roger. While he is on board the Jolly Roger, a group of aliens called the Manchis attack the Princess Blue using their Vulture class ships, destroying it.

Left only with the Jolly Roger, little money, and no ties to anyone, the player can decide his fate from there. He could engage in piracy, hunt bounties, become an interstellar merchant, or become embroiled in the interplanetary politics.

== Gameplay ==
The game is played switching back and forth between a traditional top-down style role-playing game (e.g. &quot;Ultima&quot;) and a 3D space combat simulator (e.g. &quot;Elite&quot;). Visiting starships, space stations, outposts, planets, and so on. The player is able to travel from one solar system to another using the ancient Malir Gates&#x27; wormhole, a form of &#x27;Star Gate&#x27;. A minigame of travelling through rings must be successfully completed before the player can reach his intended system; a failed minigame will cause an aborted interstellar travel.

During the 3D space flight part of the game, the game offers 3 points of view: first person, third-person, and cinematic.

There is also an arcade game called &quot;Hive!&quot; in the bars, that can be played by the player. The gameplay is a 2D top-down shooter, with the player moving on foot, attacking the incoming Manchis. The ship in the arcade game resembled the Sunracer class ship featured in the manual that came with &quot;Space Rogue&quot;. After completing five levels, the player can win money which can then be spent in the rest of &quot;Space Rogue&quot;.

== Reception ==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; called &quot;Space Rogue&quot; an &quot;interesting&quot; blend of arcade action, role-playing interaction and economic strategy.

In the January 1990 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot;, Patricia Hartley and Kirk Lesser called it a refreshing science-fiction game with crisp graphics that gives the players the feeling of flying in space. They concluded by giving it a rating of 3.5 out of 5, saying that it was an enjoyable adventure that offers a lot of action for a minimal investment.

&quot;Compute!&quot; stated that &quot;the best of flight simulation and role-playing come together in &quot;Space Rogue&quot; ... believably and with style&quot;.

One reviewer for &quot;Zzap64&quot; in 1990 wrote: &quot;I thought &quot;Elite&quot; could never be beaten as the greatest ever space game, but after playing &quot;Space Rogue&quot; for hours on end I&#x27;ve changed my mind. This totally outclasses &quot;Elite&quot; and is the best Space Game for any machine!&quot;

In the June 1990 edition of &quot;Games International&quot;, Mike Siggins was very disappointed in this game, calling it &quot;an almost exact lift of &quot;Elite&quot;&quot;. He concluded by giving it a very poor rating of 2 out of 10, saying that the players should save the money and stick with the original.

<doc id="1311015" wikidata="Q278910" url="?curid=1311015" title="Gates of Heaven">
<text>Gates of Heaven is a 1978 American independent documentary film produced, directed, and edited by Errol Morris about the pet cemetery business. It was made when Morris was unknown and did much to launch his career.

== Production ==
After a trip to Florida where he tried and failed to make a film about the residents of the town of Vernon, Errol Morris read a &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; article with the headline: &quot;450 Dead Pets Going to Napa Valley.&quot; This story about dead pets being exhumed from one pet cemetery and reburied in another became the basis for &quot;Gates of Heaven.&quot; For financing Morris borrowed money from family and friends, and the film was shot throughout the spring and summer of 1977, with the total budget estimated at $125,000. Production was difficult at times, with Morris frequently clashing with his cinematographer over the film&#x27;s visual style. Morris ultimately ended up firing three cinematographers before finally settling on Ned Burgess, with whom he would work again on his second film &quot;Vernon, Florida&quot;. Morris had a falling out with his sound-woman when one of his subjects, Florence Rasmussen, said &quot;Here today, gone tomorrow, right?&quot; and she said &quot;Wrong.&quot; Morris couldn&#x27;t decide which had offended him more, that his sound-woman had interrupted Rasmussen or that she had said she was &quot;Wrong.&quot;

== Release ==
&quot;Gates of Heaven&quot; had its premiere at the 1978 New York Film Festival, and would play at various other festivals around the world before being picked up for a limited theatrical run by New Yorker Films in 1981.

== Synopsis ==
The film, like Morris&#x27;s other works, is unnarrated and the stories are told purely through interviews. It is divided into two main sections. The first concerns Floyd &quot;Mac&quot; McClure and his lifelong quest to allow pets to have a graceful burial. McClure&#x27;s business associates and his competitor, a manager of a rendering plant, are interviewed. Morris reveals that McClure&#x27;s business has failed. Dividing the two sections is an interview with Florence Rasmussen, an elderly woman whose home overlooked the cemetery. After this, Morris follows the 450 dead pets to the Bubbling Well Pet Memorial Park. This operation is run by John &quot;Cal&quot; Harberts and his two sons, Dan and Phil. This business is far more successful, and continues to operate today, run by Cal&#x27;s son Dan Harberts. Throughout the film, the speakers touch on philosophical themes, as when McClure says &quot;Death is for the living and not for the dead so much&quot; or a grieving pet owner says &quot;There&#x27;s your dog, your dog&#x27;s dead. But where&#x27;s the thing that made it move? It had to be &quot;something&quot;, didn&#x27;t it?&quot;

== Reception and legacy ==
Noted director Werner Herzog pledged that he would eat the shoe he was wearing if Morris&#x27;s film on this improbable subject was completed and shown in a public theater. When the film was released, Herzog lived up to his wager and the consumption of his footwear was made into the short film &quot;Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe&quot;. At a seminar at the Telluride Film Festival, Herzog praised &quot;Gates of Heaven&quot; as &quot;a very, very fine film, and it was made with no money, only guts.&quot; Morris recalls showing a rough cut of the movie to Wim Wenders, who called it a masterpiece. It also aired as an episode of &quot;P.O.V.&quot;

In an interview on the Criterion DVD, Morris recalls that he showed &quot;Gates of Heaven&quot; to Douglas Sirk at the Berlin Film Festival. Sirk warned Morris that &quot;There&#x27;s a danger that somebody might find this movie to be ironic.&quot; People are often unsure of the film&#x27;s tone: is it sincere or satirical? Morris says he &quot;loves the absurd&quot; and that &quot;to love the absurdity of people is not to ridicule them, it&#x27;s to embrace, on some level, how desperate life is for each and every one of us, including me.&quot;

&quot;Gates of Heaven&quot; launched Morris&#x27;s career and is now considered a classic. In 1991, film critic Roger Ebert named it one of the ten best films ever made in his list for the &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; poll. Ebert&#x27;s television partner Gene Siskel shared his enthusiasm for the film. Ebert wrote that the film is an &quot;underground legend,&quot; and in 1997 put it in his list of The Great Movies. Ebert wrote that &quot;Gates of Heaven&quot; &quot;is surrounded by layer upon layer of comedy, pathos, irony, and human nature. I have seen this film perhaps 30 times, and am still not anywhere near the bottom of it: All I know is, it&#x27;s about a lot more than pet cemeteries.&quot;

== Home media ==
The film was initially released on DVD by MGM in 2005. In 2015 The Criterion Collection made it available as part of a new special edition DVD and Blu-Ray that also included Morris&#x27;s second film &quot;Vernon, Florida&quot;.

<text>Ivar Asbjørn Følling (23 August 1888 – 24 January 1973) was a Norwegian physician and biochemist. He first described the disease commonly known as Følling&#x27;s disease or phenylketonuria (PKU).

==Early life and education==
He was born on 23 August 1888 at Kvam (in the present-day Steinkjer Municipality in Trøndelag county, Norway). Følling studied chemistry at the Norwegian Institute of Technology in Trondheim and graduated in 1916. He then went to the University of Kristiania (now the University of Oslo), graduating in medicine in 1922. 

He received his cand.med. in 1929 after doing postgraduate work in Norway and abroad in Denmark, England, Vienna and the U.S. Starting in 1932, Følling occupied a series of medical posts in Oslo, culminating in his being Professor of Biochemistry and Physician-in-Chief at the central laboratory at the Norwegian national research hospital Oslo University Hospital. Følling was a professor of biochemistry at the University of Oslo for more than 30 years. He retired in 1958.

==Career==
===Discovery===
In 1934 at Oslo University Hospital, Følling saw a young woman named Borgny Egeland. She had two children, Liv and Dag, who had been normal at birth but subsequently developed mental retardation. When Dag was about a year old, the mother noticed a strong smell in his urine. Følling obtained urine samples from the children and, after many tests, found that the substance causing the odor in the urine was phenylpyruvic acid. The children, he concluded, had excess phenylpyruvic acid in the urine, the condition which came to be called phenylketonuria (PKU).
This abnormal condition reflects an inability to break down the amino acid phenylalanine due to a hereditary deficiency of the necessary enzyme which is called phenylalanine hydroxylase.

===Perspective===
Følling&#x27;s discovery provided the basis for the so-called metabolic screening of newborns. Today a screening blood test for PKU is done on newborns to detect the disease. With a special diet low in phenylalanine, PKU newborns can grow and develop into normal children and adults. Følling&#x27;s work was too late to save Liv and Dag from severe progressive mental retardation (and in Dag&#x27;s case, death) but it has saved thousands of children since then. It has been said that: &quot;Følling is by many considered the most important medical scientist not to receive the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine&quot;.

<doc id="1311048" wikidata="Q2623147" url="?curid=1311048" title="The Bard (The Twilight Zone)">
<text>&quot;The Bard&quot; is an episode of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. It was the final episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; to be one hour long. A direct satire of the American television industry, the episode features a parody of Marlon Brando by Burt Reynolds, and concerns an inept screenwriter, who through the use of black magic, employs William Shakespeare as his ghostwriter.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
A bumbling screenwriter, Julius K. Moomer, is becoming desperate for a sale after years of working on unproduced scripts. When his agent mentions that he is submitting another writer&#x27;s pitch for a television series about black magic, Julius pleads to be allowed to be given first crack at the series. Knowing nothing about the subject, he attempts some research, but turns up only an actual book of black magic. While experimenting with the book, he accidentally conjures William Shakespeare, who says he is at the service of the conjurer. Deciding not to waste Shakespeare&#x27;s talent on a television pilot, Julius directs him to write a film.

The producers decide that Shakespeare&#x27;s script, &quot;The Tragic Cycle&quot;, though archaic to the point of being almost incomprehensible, has potential. His task finished, Shakespeare proposes to leave. Julius argues that if he stops writing now, Shakespeare will lose his chance at Hollywood fame and become forgotten. Shakespeare at last says he will attend a rehearsal for the film and stay on if it does justice to his script. At the rehearsal, he is so horrified at the revisions by the sponsor that he assaults the leading man and storms out. Julius&#x27;s next assignment, a TV special on American history, seems doomed to failure until he remembers his book on black magic, and uses it to conjure up Robert E. Lee, Ulysses S. Grant, Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Pocahontas, Daniel Boone, Benjamin Franklin, and Theodore Roosevelt to act as consultants.

==Closing narration==
==Cast==
* Jack Weston as Julius Moomer 
* John Williams as William Shakespeare
* Burt Reynolds as Rocky Rhodes 
* Henry Lascoe as Gerald Hugo
* John McGiver as Mr. Shannon
* Howard McNear as Bramhoff
* Judy Strangis as Cora 
* Marge Redmond as Secretary
* Doro Merande as Sadie
* William Lanteau as Dolan
* Clegg Hoyt as Bus driver
* John Newton as TV interviewer 
* John Bose as Daniel Boone (uncredited)
* Rudy Bowman as Robert E. Lee (uncredited)

Notes: Weston and McGiver appeared in the other episodes, &quot;The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street&quot; and &quot;Sounds and Silences&quot;.

==Production history==
The episode was likely written by Rod Serling as a reaction to the advertising executives with whom he dealt regularly while producing for television. In the book &quot;The Twilight Zone Companion&quot;, Serling is quoted as saying that things were so bad with the overcautious executives that &quot;one could not ford a river if Chevy was the sponsor.&quot;

The actor portrayed by Burt Reynolds satirizes Marlon Brando&#x27;s style of method acting, augmented by the close physical resemblance between Reynolds and Brando during that period.

The episode was also featured in the final episode of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, in 2007, &quot;Made in America&quot;. Tony Soprano, the protagonist of the series, is seen watching this episode while in hiding from his enemies in a safe house.

<text>The Charles Paddock Zoo is a community zoo located in San Luis Obispo County, California, in the City of Atascadero on the Central Coast. It is home to an endangered male Malayan tiger named Menderu.

Accredited since 1991, the zoo is one of the smallest zoos accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).

==History==

The Charles Paddock Zoo was started by Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Paddock, a county park ranger, in the county animal shelter in 1955. Paddock would nurse wild animals back to health, and by 1959 his menagerie contained over 125 birds and mammals. In 1963 the animals were moved to the current location adjacent to the Atascadero Lake Park, just off State Route 41, and the new zoo was named Atascadero Children&#x27;s Zoo.

In 1979, the City of Atascadero took over management of the zoo after it was incorporated. The name was changed to Charles Paddock Zoo in honor of its founder in 1980.

In 2010, while the zoo was under review for re-accreditation, it started a series of renovations and maintenance updates including new roofs, repaving, new public fencing, and a long list of other smaller projects. A new entrance to the zoo was opened on 9 November 2010. In April 2019, the zoo opened the Thelma Vetter Red Panda Experience, home to red pandas, Asian ratsnakes, and various birds.

==Exhibits and animals==

The zoo is home to more than 100 animals representing 45 species.

;Birds

Birds at the zoo include black-necked stilt, Inca tern, Mandarin duck, ring-necked parakeet, ringed teal, roseate spoonbill, scarlet ibis, Sulawesi ground dove, and white-faced whistling duck in the aviary, blue and gold macaw, double yellow-headed amazon parrot, salmon-crested cockatoo, and scarlet macaw at the Parrot Pond, as well as burrowing owl, Caribbean flamingo, emu, great horned owl, and helmeted guineafowl.

;Mammals

Mammals at the zoo include Jacob&#x27;s sheep in the barnyard, titi monkey in the South American exhibit, and African crested porcupine, Bennett&#x27;s wallaby, black-handed spider monkey, Channel Island fox, fossa, Malayan tiger, mara (Patagonia cavy), prehensile-tailed porcupine, Prevost&#x27;s squirrel, red river hog, red ruffed lemur, slender-tailed meerkat, and white-fronted marmoset.

;Reptiles and amphibians
Reptiles and amphibians at the zoo include Aldabra giant tortoise, Burmese python, carpet python, desert tortoise, European pond turtle, giant Asian hill tortoise, Gila monster, South American red-footed tortoise, and African bullfrog (burrowing frog).

==The Central Coast Zoo Society==

The Central Coast Zoo Society, originally formed in 1962 as the Children&#x27;s Zoo Friendship Society, has formed partnerships with both the City of Atascadero and the Zoo Director to &quot;support and promote the Charles Paddock Zoo, its exhibits, the educational and scientific programs, and the conservation and preservation of wildlife.&quot;

==Projects==

Plans for the future include a new fisher exhibit and a new Indo-Burma exhibit to include a tiger, red pandas, and a reptile house for Komodo dragons.

<text>Pupa&#x27;s Window is a lo-fi singer/songwriter pseudonym from Baltimore, Maryland.

==History==
In 1994, singer/songwriter Michael Nestor formed Pupa&#x27;s Window in Eldersburg, Maryland-mostly as a vehicle to document the recording process and produce lo-fi cassette recordings. In the early-to-mid 1990s, Pupa&#x27;s Window recorded music at the advent of cassette-based, lo-fi indie pop. The project had some early success on college radio-typically charting in the CMJ New Music Report. After 2002, Pupa&#x27;s Window records began to become more orchestrated, and involve other musicians. Shortly after joining The Beechfields Record Label in Baltimore, Maryland, Pupa&#x27;s Window began to be regarded as one of the &quot;best-kept indie-pop songwriter secrets&quot; in Baltimore. The band&#x27;s music draws comparison to Lou Barlow, Bill Callahan and Elliott Smith and has been described as, &quot;a stripped-down, folky type of indie-pop with a freak factor provided by plenty of echoey production, a few odd instruments and sounds, and tape-loop tinkering.&quot; Between 1994 and 2008, Pupa&#x27;s Window released over eighteen records on both cassette and compact disc, and collaborated with Baltimore-based artist Private Eleanor. Concurrently with this project, from 1998 to 2001, Nestor played in a shoegaze band, called Lowell. Work on both Pupa&#x27;s Window and Lowell were instrumental in Nestor joining the alt-rock group The Seldon Plan. Recording as Pupa&#x27;s Window contributed to The Seldon Plan&#x27;s role in the Baltimore indie and DIY movement that experienced a revitalization across the late 1990s through the mid 2000s.

The lo-fi indie DIY ethos had a significant impact on Nestor and his work with Pupa&#x27;s Window helped in his development of The Beechfields Record Label. In 2003, he founded The Beechfields. Nestor notes in an interview with Baltimore City Paper, the goal was to maintain an artist-centered approach to releasing records based on Virginia label Simple Machines founded by Jenny Toomey. In 2004, Baltimore musician Austin Stahl began working at The Beechfields with Nestor to develop the label&#x27;s roster while playing percussion for Pupa&#x27;s Window. Asked about the potential for too much emphasis on an inward-looking and diary-esque approach within lo-fi indie pop in general and Pupa&#x27;s Window specifically, Nestor has said, &quot;I&#x27;m really afraid of the self-indulgent aspect of this music...what I try to remember, is to keep things in the service of the song, that if something isn&#x27;t working for the song--the lyrics, a drum loop, whatever--to rethink it.&quot;

<text>The Clark Sisters are an American gospel vocal group originally consisting of five sisters: Jacky Clark Chisholm (born 1948), Denise &quot;Niecy&quot; Clark-Bradford (born 1953), Elbernita &quot;Twinkie&quot; Clark (born 1954), Dorinda Clark-Cole (born 1957), and Karen Clark Sheard (born 1960). The Clark Sisters are the daughters of gospel musician and choral director Dr. Mattie Moss Clark. They are credited for helping to bring gospel music to the mainstream and are considered pioneers of contemporary gospel.

Their biggest hits include &quot;Is My Living in Vain&quot;, &quot;Praise the Lord (Hallelujah)&quot;, &quot;I Can Do All Things Through Christ That Strengthens Me&quot;, &quot;A Praying Spirit&quot;, &quot;Nothing to Lose, All to Gain&quot;, &quot;Endow Me&quot;, &quot;Jesus Is a Love Song&quot;, &quot;Ha-Ya (Eternal Life)&quot;, &quot;Pure Gold&quot;, &quot;Expect Your Miracle&quot;, and their biggest, mainstream crossover hit, &quot;You Brought the Sunshine&quot;.

As a group, the Clark Sisters have won two Grammy Awards and are the highest-selling female gospel group in history. In 2020, the Clark Sisters were honored with the James Cleveland Lifetime Achievement Award at the 35th Annual Stellar Awards. In 2022, the group was inducted into the Black Music &amp; Entertainment Walk of Fame. In 2024, the group (including Denise Clark-Bradford) was honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, becoming the fifth gospel act to receive the award, after Mahalia Jackson, The Staple Singers, The Blind Boys of Alabama, and Shirley Caesar.

==History==
===Early years===
The Clark Sisters were born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, to gospel choir director and musician Dr. Mattie Moss Clark. Dr. Clark was married twice: her first marriage in 1945 to Leo H. Cullum, Sr. produced two children, Leo, Jr. and Jacqueline (Jacky). After her divorce, she met and later married Pastor Elbert Clark in 1952. This marriage produced four daughters: Denise, Elbernita (Twinkie), Dorinda, and Karen. They each began singing at an early age in the choir at their father&#x27;s Church of God in Christ, and by the late 1960s they were all performing together in church services, usually singing songs written and arranged by their mother. Shortly after the Clarks&#x27; divorce in 1973, Dr. Clark formally created &quot;the Clark Sisters&quot; and the sisters recorded their first album, &quot;Jesus Has a Lot to Give&quot;, on their uncle (their mother&#x27;s younger brother) Bill Moss&#x27; local label Billesse Records. The first television appearance of the Clark Sisters was on &quot;TV Gospel Time&quot;.

The following year, &quot;Dr. Mattie Moss Clark Presents the Clark Sisters&quot; was released and people around Detroit began to take notice of the group. The Clark Sisters signed to Sound of Gospel Records in 1974. Under this association, the group released albums such as &quot;Unworthy&quot;, &quot;Count It All Joy&quot;, and &quot;He Gave Me Nothing to Lose&quot;, which hit the top 20 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Spiritual LPs chart. By this point, Dr. Clark had turned over control of the group to Twinkie, who continued to write, arrange, conduct, and produce all of the Clark Sisters&#x27; recordings. Their popularity soared with the release of the live recording &quot;Is My Living in Vain&quot;, in 1980. Their debut live recording was first ranked on the 1981 &quot;Billboard&quot; Spiritual Albums year-end chart at number 21, before topping the year-end Spiritual Albums chart of 1982. Opening with the bluesy title track, each sister vocally declares that their dedication to Christ is not a useless effort. The innovative &quot;Ha-Ya (Eternal Life)&quot; was funky enough to find its way into a Tonex-produced track over two decades later. Karen Clark&#x27;s lead on &quot;Speak Lord&quot; expresses deep faith while the call to worship is raised on &quot;Now Is the Time&quot;. Another hit from this release, &quot;Expect Your Miracle&quot;, is still a staple in African American churches across the country.

===Mainstream success (1981-1984)===
Their next release, &quot;You Brought the Sunshine&quot; (1981), became successful due to its title track. Reminiscent of Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Master Blaster (Jammin&#x27;)&quot;, the song became a hit in churches and on dance floors across the country, including New York&#x27;s Studio 54. &quot;You Brought the Sunshine (Into My Life)&quot; was picked up from its original independent gospel record label Sound of Gospel and distributed by both Westbound Records and Elektra Records. In 1983, the song peaked at number 16 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Black Singles, number 27 on Dance Club Songs and in 2020 – the &quot;&quot; (2007) recording – hit number 11 on the Hot Gospel Songs chart. The album was also a commercial success, peaking at number nine on the US Top Gospel Albums chart and also appeared on both the 1983 and 1984 year-end charts at number two and 25 respectively. Furthermore, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked The Clark Sisters as the number-four Top Gospel Albums Artist of 1982 and number-one Top Gospel Albums Artist of 1983.

The sisters delivered another album in 1982, &quot;Sincerely&quot;, which included &quot;Name It, Claim It&quot; and the politically charged &quot;World&quot;. Though its success was overshadowed by &quot;You Brought the Sunshine&quot;, the sisters received their first Grammy Award nomination for Best Soul Gospel Performance by a Duo or Group for the album at the 26th Annual Grammy Awards. Shortly after winning the Grammy nomination, the Clark Sisters won the NAACP Image Award for best gospel group for 1983. After receiving a second Grammy nomination in the Best Soul Gospel Performance by a Duo or Group category for the song, &quot;He&#x27;ll Turn Your Scars into Stars&quot; – later included on the album &quot;Heart &amp; Soul&quot; (1986) – the sisters were invited to perform live on the following 27th Annual Grammy Awards in 1985, alongside their mother, where they performed &quot;Hallelujah&quot; as part of a medley with the year&#x27;s fellow gospel nominees.

===Denise&#x27;s departure and subsequent projects (1986-1994)===
In 1986, after a four-year gap between releases, the sisters Jacky, Twinkie, Dorinda, and Karen (sister Denise left the group earlier that year) continued to release music, signing with Rejoice Records, a division of Word. This new deal yielded the Grammy-nominated &quot;Heart &amp; Soul&quot;, featuring the mainstream single &quot;Time Out&quot;. This project made a top-five debut on Billboard&#x27;s Gospel Charts and garnered the group a Dove Award. It featured the original versions of &quot;Jesus Is a Love Song&quot;, &quot;There Is a Balm in Gilead&quot;, and &quot;Pray for the USA&quot;, all of which have been re-recorded several times. Although not pictured, Denise had contributed to the album before her departure but was later removed from the album. The music took on a more contemporary sound with programmed drums and synthesizers. Also included on this album were &quot;Smile, God Loves You&quot;, &quot;I Am Blessed&quot;, and the funky &quot;He&#x27;ll Turn Your Scars into Stars&quot;.

In 1988, The Clark Sisters released their &quot;Billboard&quot; chart-topping and critically acclaimed album &quot;Conqueror&quot;. It featured a bolder, more intense sound, with synthesizers, drum machines, and more funk-oriented beats. &quot;Conqueror&quot; quickly became a fan favorite with hits like &quot;The Darkest Hour Is Just Before the Day&quot;, &quot;Take Me Higher&quot;, &quot;For the Love of the People&quot;, &quot;Computers Rule the World&quot;, and the original studio version of &quot;Jesus Forevermore&quot;.

In 1989, The Clark Sisters released their live album, &quot;Bringing It Back Home&quot;, recorded in their home town of Detroit. It was the last recording from The Clark Sisters on Word Records&#x27; Rejoice imprint and the last group album with Twinkie just before the launch of her solo career. The album included both previous hits and new material. It also featured guest appearances from Rance Allen and backing choir vocals from the Michigan State Choir under the direction of their mother, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark.

In 1994, The Clark Sisters (Jacky, Dorinda, and Karen) released their last studio album of the decade, &quot;Miracle&quot;, which was the first album recorded without the songwriting and vocals of sister Twinkie. Produced by BeBe Winans and Michael J. Powell, this disc featured a commercialized version of the Clark Sisters classic &quot;Expect Your Miracle&quot; (now titled &quot;Miracle&quot;) and a remake of &quot;Jesus Is the Best Thing&quot;. Dorinda made her songwriting debut on a Clark Sisters recording with &quot;Work to Do&quot;. The album, although it fared well in sales, did not match the success of previous albums due to the Clark Sisters not being able to tour and promote the project due to the illness of their mother, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark, who died in September 1994 from diabetes complications.

===Solo careers (1995-2006)===
Following their last Word Records release, Twinkie resumed her calling as a minister and her solo career. She had previously released two solo albums under the Sound of Gospel Record label: 1979&#x27;s &quot;Praise Belongs to God&quot; and 1981&#x27;s &quot;Ye Shall Receive Power&quot;. In 1992 she recorded her independent solo album &quot;Comin&#x27; Home&quot;. She re-appeared in 1996 with a pair of albums to her credit: the solo studio release &quot;The Masterpiece&quot; for Ben Tankard&#x27;s Tribute Records label and the live project &quot;Twinkie Clark-Terrell Presents the Florida A&amp;M University Gospel Choir&quot;. She later released the following albums: &quot;Twinkie Clark &amp; Friends: Live in Charlotte&quot; in 2002, &quot;Home Once Again: Live in Detroit&quot; in 2004, &quot;With Humility&quot; in 2011, &quot;Live &amp; Unplugged&quot; in 2015, and with her nephew Larry Clark (her sister Denise&#x27;s oldest son) &quot;The Generations&quot; in 2020.

Karen delivered her solo debut &quot;Finally Karen&quot; in 1997. The album, featuring The Clark Sisters, Faith Evans, and daughter Kierra Sheard, was nominated for a Grammy Award, in addition to winning a Soul Train Lady of Soul Award. She has since released five more solo albums: &quot;2nd Chance&quot;, &quot;The Heavens Are Telling&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Not Over&quot;, &quot;All in One&quot;, and &quot;Destined to Win&quot;.

Dorinda released her self-titled debut solo album, &quot;Dorinda Clark-Cole&quot; in 2002, earning her two Stellar Awards, and a Soul Train Lady of Soul award. She has since released four more solo albums: &quot;Live in Houston&quot; and &quot;Take It Back&quot;, each of which have earned her the award for Female Vocalist of the Year at the Stellar Awards; &quot;I Survived&quot; in 2011, and in 2015, she released her fifth solo album, &quot;Living It&quot;, which was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Gospel Album.

Jacky released her first solo project, &quot;Expectancy&quot;, in 2005, which features The Clark Sisters on the track &quot;Blessing Me&quot;. In 2014, she released an urban-inspired single, &quot;My Season&quot;, followed by singles &quot;Cover Me&quot; and &quot;Shout&quot;. In February 2020, she released a single &quot;Feel Good&quot;, featuring Mary J. Blige and rapper Tia P.

The Clark Sisters have all contributed in various capacities to each other&#x27;s albums, whether they sang or wrote lyrics.

===&quot;Live...One Last Time&quot; and Grammy recognition (2007-2009)===
On July 8, 2006, The Clark Sisters (Jacky, Twinkie, Dorinda, and Karen) recorded a live album in Houston, Texas, entitled &quot;Live...One Last Time&quot;. The recording was directed and produced by Donald Lawrence and was released as a CD on April 10, 2007 on EMI Gospel, followed by a CD/DVD Special Edition release on June 19, 2007. In support of the reunion album, the Clark Sisters embarked on a 25-city concert tour beginning October 4, 2007 in Nashville, Tennessee. Though they had been thrice nominated previously for the Best Soul Gospel Performance by a Duo or Group Grammy with 1982&#x27;s &quot;Sincerely&quot;, 1986&#x27;s &quot;Heart &amp; Soul&quot;, and 1988&#x27;s &quot;Conqueror&quot; without a win, the group was nominated for two Grammys in 2008. &quot;Live...One Last Time&quot; won the award for Best Traditional Gospel Album. Its album track &quot;Blessed &amp; Highly Favored&quot; won the award for Best Gospel Performance, and as songwriter of &quot;Blessed &amp; Highly Favored,&quot; sister Karen Clark Sheard won the individual award for Best Gospel Song. Additionally, at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony featuring a gospel segment with Aretha Franklin, BeBe Winans, Israel &amp; New Breed, and Trin-i-tee 5:7, the Clark Sisters performed a snippet of their signature hit &quot;You Brought the Sunshine&quot; when the ceremony was broadcast on February 10 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.

Following the group&#x27;s resurgence in popularity, Rhino Entertainment released a greatest-hits collection including material from three albums recorded for Word Records from the mid-1980s through the early 1990s, including the Grammy-nominated &quot;Heart &amp; Soul&quot;. The album, &quot;Encore: The Best of the Clark Sisters&quot;, was released on February 12, 2008. In December of that year, TV One&#x27;s popular hour-long music documentary series &quot;Unsung&quot; featured the Clark Sisters in its second episode. The episode, which highlighted the group&#x27;s role in breaking down barriers in gospel music, featured interviews with each sister except sister Denise Clark-Bradford, who since leaving the group, had relocated to California and had begun a ministry.

In 2009, the Clark Sisters released their second Christmas album, entitled &quot;The Clark Sisters&#x27; Family Christmas&quot;, which featured special appearances by Karen&#x27;s daughter Kierra Sheard, and their cousins Bill Moss, Jr. and James Moss (known as J. Moss). The album was produced by Karen&#x27;s son, J. Drew Sheard, II.

===Lifetime movie and &quot;The Return&quot; (2018-present)===
On November 11, 2018, it was reported that The Clark Sisters would have a television biopic, &quot;The Clark Sisters: First Ladies of Gospel&quot;. The film aired on Lifetime on April 11, 2020, and netted a viewership of 2.7 million, giving the network its highest rated original movie in four years. The film was executive produced by Queen Latifah, Missy Elliott, and Mary J. Blige, and starred Aunjanue Ellis as Dr. Mattie Moss Clark, Angela Birchett as Jacky Clark Chisholm, Raven Goodwin as Denise Clark-Bradford, Christina Bell as Twinkie Clark, Sheléa Frazier as Dorinda Clark Cole, and Kierra Sheard as her mother, Karen Clark Sheard. The movie was directed by Christine Swanson, the story was by Camille Tucker, with a teleplay by Sylvia L. Jones and Camille Tucker.

On October 18, 2019, the Clark Sisters debuted their new single &quot;Victory&quot; on Erica Campbell&#x27;s radio show &quot;Get Up Erica&quot;. The single was later released on November 15, 2019, through Karew/Motown Gospel/Capitol CMG On March 13, 2020, the Clark Sisters released their seventeenth album, &quot;The Return&quot;. Their first release in over a decade, it featured production from J. Drew Sheard, II, Warryn Campell, Rodney Jerkins, Jermaine Dupri, Mano Hines, and Kurt Carr, with a special feature by Snoop Dogg on the track, &quot;His Love&quot;.

In September 2023, the Clark Sisters embarked on the Reunion Tour with Kirk Franklin, Tye Tribbett, Israel Houghton, and Tamela Mann. The tour spanned 29 shows across North America and ended in Dallas, Texas on November 24, 2023.

In January 2024, it was announced that the Clark Sisters would be honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

==Artistry==
===&quot;The Clark Sound&quot;===
Since early in the group&#x27;s development, Twinkie has been the chief songwriter, vocal arranger, and producer for the group. The Clark Sisters as a whole are renowned for their group style, dubbed as &quot;the Clark Sound&quot;. They incorporate high and fast melismas, acrobatic trills and riffs, and deep, soulful growls or &quot;squalls&quot;. While they have been praised for their precise harmonies, The Clark Sisters are also known for their individual, distinctive vocal styles, and while there is no single lead vocalist in the group, each sister has led a handful of songs over the years.

The Clark Sisters have cited Aretha Franklin, who also grew up in Detroit, as a major musical influence. When Franklin died of pancreatic cancer in 2018, the Clark Sisters sang one of their signature songs, &quot;Is My Living in Vain&quot;, at her funeral service.

===Group timeline and structure===

===Influence and covers===
The Clark Sisters are credited as vocal inspirations to Faith Evans, Beyoncé, Kelly Price, Missy Elliott, Mary Mary, Queen Latifah, Kelly Rowland, Mary J. Blige, Yebba and Mariah Carey. Their musical influence has been celebrated through covers and interpolations from both religious and secular artists alike.

<text>Harry Hamilton Laughlin (March 11, 1880 – January 26, 1943) was an American educator and eugenicist. He served as the superintendent of the Eugenics Record Office from its inception in 1910 to its closure in 1939, and was among the most active individuals influencing American eugenics policy, especially compulsory sterilization legislation.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Harry Hamilton Laughlin was born March 11, 1880, in Oskaloosa, Iowa. He graduated from the First District Normal School (now Truman State University) in Kirksville, Missouri. In 1917, he earned a Doctor of Science degree from Princeton University in the field of cytology.

===Career===
==== Eugenics Record Office ====
He worked as a high school teacher and principal before his interest turned to eugenics. This led to his correspondence with Charles Davenport, an early researcher into Mendelian inheritance in the United States. In 1910, Davenport asked Laughlin to move to Long Island, New York, to serve as the superintendent of his new research office.

The Eugenics Record Office (ERO) was founded at Cold Spring Harbor, New York, by Davenport with initial support from Mary Williamson Averell (Mrs. E. H. Harriman) and John Harvey Kellogg, and later by the Carnegie Institution of Washington. Laughlin was appointed as managing director and pursued the goals of the institution, even co-writing a &quot;eugenical comedy in four acts&quot; for performance at the ERO for the amusement of field workers being trained. He regularly lectured to groups around the United States.

Laughlin provided extensive statistical testimony to the United States Congress in support of the Johnson-Reed Immigration Act of 1924. Part of his testimony dealt with &quot;excessive&quot; insanity among immigrants from southern Europe and eastern Europe. He also argued that most Jews were born feeble-minded. Bacterial geneticist Herbert Spencer Jennings, condemned Laughlin&#x27;s statistics as invalid because they compared recent immigrants to more settled immigrants. Economist Joseph M. Gillman criticized the statistical analysis and research methodology of Laughlin&#x27;s work, arguing that there were rudimentary statistics errors, as well as selection bias. For instance, Laughlin asserted that various forms of &quot;degeneracy&quot; were innate to certain racial groups of recent immigrants by looking at populations in asylums and homes for the disabled. However, he failed to account for the fact that racial groups of older immigrant communities were more likely to take care of their disabled at home rather than place them in institutions, which was not the case for smaller recent immigrant groups who may not have family in the country to take care of them.

He was eventually appointed as an &quot;expert eugenics agent&quot; to the Committee on Immigration and Naturalization (the 1924 law applied national-origin quotas on immigrants, which stopped the large Italian and Russian influx of the early 1900s). 

In 1927, the Eugenics Research Association, of which Laughlin was an officer, began a study of the heritage of U.S. Senators. Some senators were enthusiastic while others reluctantly complied, and Senator William Cabell Bruce questioned whether eugenics was even a science and refused to participate. Laughlin wrote to Bruce&#x27;s hometown newspaper in an attempt to gain the information.

==== Sterilization laws ====
One of Laughlin&#x27;s interests was to encourage the proliferation of compulsory sterilization legislation in the United States, to sterilize the &quot;unfit&quot; members of the population. By 1914, twelve states had already passed sterilization laws, beginning with Indiana in 1907 and Connecticut in 1909. However, the laws were not employed with significant vigor, with the exception of California. In his study of this, Laughlin deduced that much of the state sterilization legislation was poorly worded, leaving it open to questions of constitutionality and confusion over bureaucratic responsibility. As a result, Laughlin drafted the &quot;Model Eugenical Sterilization Law&quot;, a model act for compulsory sterilization, intended to obviate these difficulties. He published the proposal in his 1922 study of American sterilization policy, &quot;Eugenical Sterilization in the United States.&quot; It included as subjects for eugenic sterilization: the feeble-minded, the insane, criminals, epileptics, alcoholics, blind persons, deaf persons, deformed persons, and indigent persons. An additional eighteen states passed laws based on Laughlin&#x27;s model, including Virginia in 1924.

The first person ordered sterilized in Virginia under the new law was Carrie Buck, on the grounds that she was a &quot;probable potential parent of socially inadequate offspring.&quot; A lawsuit ensued and Laughlin, who had never met Buck, gave a deposition endorsing her suitability for sterilization, calling the family members of Buck &quot;the shiftless, ignorant, and worthless class of anti-social whites of the South&quot;. Other scientists from the ERO testified in person. The state won the case, which was appealed to the United States Supreme Court in 1927. The resulting case, &quot;Buck v. Bell,&quot; upheld the constitutionality of the laws that Laughlin helped write. Five months after the court confirmed the law, Carrie Buck was sterilized. A law allowing for the sterilization of repeat criminals was overturned in 1942, in &quot;Skinner v. Oklahoma,&quot; but sterilizations of mental patients continued into the 1970s. Altogether more than 60,000 Americans were sterilized. Virginia repealed its sterilization law in 1974. Laughlin also supported the passage of Virginia&#x27;s Racial Integrity Act, which outlawed miscegenation. In 1967, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned that law in &quot;Loving v. Virginia.&quot;

==== Association with German eugenics ====
The Reichstag of Nazi Germany passed the Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring in 1933, closely based on Laughlin&#x27;s model. Between 35,000 and 80,000 persons were sterilized in the first full year alone (it is now known that over 350,000 persons were sterilized). Laughlin was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Heidelberg in 1936 for his work on behalf of the &quot;science of racial cleansing.&quot; However, reports about the extensive use of compulsory sterilization in Germany began to appear in US newspapers. By the end of the decade, eugenics had become associated with Nazism and poor science. Support for groups like the American Eugenics Society began to fade. In 1935, a review panel convened by the Carnegie Institute concluded that the ERO&#x27;s research did not have scientific merit. By 1939, the institute withdrew funding for the ERO, which was forced to close.

Laughlin was a founding member of the Pioneer Fund, and was its first president, serving from 1937 to 1941. The Pioneer Fund was created by Wickliffe Draper in order to promote the &quot;betterment of the race&quot; through eugenics. Draper had been supporting the Eugenics Research Association and its &quot;Eugenical News&quot; since 1932. One of the first projects that Laughlin pursued for the Fund was the distribution of two films from Germany depicting the success of eugenics programs in that country.

Laughlin lobbied to keep immigration barriers enforced during the Nazi Holocaust, preventing Jews from reaching safety in the United States. A biographer has described Laughlin as &quot;among the most racist and anti-Semitic of early twentieth-century eugenicists.&quot;

==== World government ====
As well as his interest in eugenics, Laughlin was fascinated by the idea of establishing a world government. He worked on his plans for this throughout his adult life. The world government model that he devised was loosely based on the U.S. Constitution and the League of Nations. The allotment of representation in the body was heavily biased in favor of Europe and North America, particularly the United Kingdom and the United States. Laughlin believed that his world government model would promote the eugenicist aim of preventing the intermixing of different races. Many leading internationalists expressed interest in Laughlin&#x27;s world government plan; these included Edward M. House, Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s foreign policy adviser.

===Retirement and death===
Laughlin and his wife Pansy married in 1902; the couple did not have children. Laughlin was pressured into retirement by Vannevar Bush in 1939, after a series of severe seizures. These seizures may have been due to hereditary epilepsy. After his retirement from the Eugenics Record Office, the couple returned to Kirksville in December 1939. Laughlin died January 26, 1943, and was buried near his father and mother in Highland Park Cemetery in Kirksville.

<doc id="1311096" wikidata="Q2321196" url="?curid=1311096" title="Principles of Islamic jurisprudence">
<text>Principles of Islamic jurisprudence () are traditional methodological principles used in Islamic jurisprudence (&quot;fiqh&quot;) for deriving the rulings of Islamic law (&quot;sharia&quot;).

Traditional theory of Islamic jurisprudence elaborates how the scriptures (Quran and hadith) should be interpreted from the standpoint of linguistics and rhetoric. It also comprises methods for establishing authenticity of hadith and for determining when the legal force of a scriptural passage is abrogated by a passage revealed at a later date. In addition to the Quran and hadith, the classical theory of Sunni jurisprudence recognizes secondary sources of law: juristic consensus (&quot;ijmaʿ&quot;) and analogical reasoning (&quot;qiyas&quot;). It therefore studies the application and limits of analogy, as well as the value and limits of consensus, along with other methodological principles, some of which are accepted by only certain legal schools (&quot;madhahib&quot;). This interpretive apparatus is brought together under the rubric of ijtihad, which refers to a jurist&#x27;s exertion in an attempt to arrive at a ruling on a particular question. The theory of Twelver Shia jurisprudence parallels that of Sunni schools with some differences, such as recognition of reason (&quot;ʿaql&quot;) as a source of law in place of &quot;qiyās&quot; and extension of the notions of hadith and sunnah to include traditions of the imams.

==Etymology==
&quot;Uṣūl al-fiqh&quot; is a genitive construction with two Arabic terms, &quot;uṣūl&quot; and &quot;fiqh&quot;. &quot;Uṣūl&quot; means roots or basis. Some says, &quot;Uṣūl&quot;, the plural form of &quot;Aṣl&quot;, means &quot;Rājih&quot; (preponderant). It also signifies &quot;Qā’idah&quot; (rules), which is the real-world application of the word. For example: &quot;every sentence must contain a verb&quot; is a rule of Grammar. &quot;Fiqh&quot; linguistically refers to knowledge, deep understanding or comprehension. In the context of Islamic law, it refers to traditional Islamic jurisprudence.

==Overview==
Classical jurists held that human reason is a gift from God which should be exercised to its fullest capacity. However, they believed that use of reason alone is insufficient to distinguish right from wrong, and that rational argumentation must draw its content from the body of transcendental knowledge revealed in the Quran and through the sunnah of Muhammad.

===Sources of sharia===

====Primary sources====
=====Quran=====

In Islam, the Quran is considered to be the most sacred source of law. Classical jurists held its textual integrity to be beyond doubt on account of it having been handed down by many people in each generation, which is known as &quot;recurrence&quot; or &quot;concurrent transmission&quot; (&quot;tawātur&quot;). Only several hundred verses of the Quran have direct legal relevance, and they are concentrated in a few specific areas such as inheritance, though other passages have been used as a source for general principles whose legal ramifications were elaborated by other means.

=====Hadith=====

The body of hadith provides more detailed and practical legal guidance, but it was recognized early on that not all of them were authentic. Early Islamic scholars developed a methodology for evaluating their authenticity by assessing trustworthiness of the individuals listed in their transmission chains. These criteria narrowed down the vast corpus of prophetic traditions to several thousand &quot;sound&quot; hadiths, which were collected in several canonical compilations. The hadiths which enjoyed concurrent transmission were deemed unquestionably authentic; however, the vast majority of hadiths were handed down by only one or a few transmitters and were therefore seen to yield only probable knowledge. The uncertainty was further compounded by ambiguity of the language contained in some hadiths and Quranic passages. Disagreements on the relative merits and interpretation of the textual sources allowed legal scholars considerable leeway in formulating alternative rulings.

====Secondary sources====

===== Ijmā&#x27; (consensus) =====

Consensus (&quot;ijma&quot;) could in principle elevate a ruling based on probable evidence to absolute certainty. This classical doctrine drew its authority from a series of hadiths stating that the Islamic community could never agree on an error. This form of consensus was technically defined as agreement of all competent jurists in any particular generation, acting as representatives of the community. However, the practical difficulty of obtaining and ascertaining such an agreement meant that it had little impact on legal development. A more pragmatic form of consensus, which could be determined by consulting works of prominent jurists, was used to confirm a ruling so that it could not be reopened for further discussion. The cases for which there was a consensus account for less than 1 percent of the body of classical jurisprudence.

===== Qiyās (analogical reasoning) and &#x27;aql (reason) =====

Analogical reasoning (&quot;qiyas&quot;) is used to derive a ruling for a situation not addressed in the scripture by analogy with a scripturally-based rule. In a classic example, the Quranic prohibition of drinking wine is extended to all intoxicating substances, on the basis of the &quot;cause&quot; (&quot;ʿilla&quot;) shared by these situations, which in this case is identified to be intoxication. Since the cause of a rule may not be apparent, its selection commonly occasioned controversy and extensive debate. Twelver Shia jurisprudence does not recognize the use of qiyās, but relies on reason (&quot;ʿaql&quot;) in its place.

=== Ijtihād ===

The classical process of &quot;ijtihād&quot; combined these generally recognized principles with other methods, which were not adopted by all legal schools, such as &quot;istiḥsān&quot; (juristic preference), &quot;istiṣlāḥ&quot; (consideration of public interest) and &quot;istiṣḥāb&quot; (presumption of continuity). A jurist who is qualified to practice ijtihad is known as a &quot;mujtahid&quot;. The use of independent reasoning to arrive at a ruling is contrasted with &quot;taqlīd&quot; (imitation), which refers to following the rulings of a mujtahid. By the beginning of the 10th century, development of Sunni jurisprudence prompted leading jurists to state that the main legal questions had been addressed and the scope of ijtihad was gradually restricted. From the 18th century on, leading Muslim reformers began calling for abandonment of taqlid and renewed emphasis on ijtihad, which they saw as a return to the vitality of early Islamic jurisprudence.

===Decision types (&quot;aḥkām&quot;)===

Sharia rulings fall into one of five categories known as &quot;the five rulings&quot; (&quot;al-aḥkām al-khamsa&quot;): mandatory (&quot;farḍ&quot; or &quot;wājib&quot;), recommended (&quot;mandūb&quot; or &quot;mustaḥabb&quot;), neutral (&quot;mubāḥ&quot;), reprehensible (&quot;makrūh&quot;), and forbidden (&quot;ḥarām&quot;). It is a sin or a crime to perform a forbidden action or not to perform a mandatory action. Reprehensible acts should be avoided, but they are not considered to be sinful or punishable in court. Avoiding reprehensible acts and performing recommended acts is held to be subject of reward in the afterlife, while neutral actions entail no judgement from God. Jurists disagree on whether the term &quot;ḥalāl&quot; covers the first three or the first four categories. The legal and moral verdict depends on whether the action is committed out of necessity (&quot;ḍarūra&quot;).

===Aims of sharia and public interest===

&quot;Maqāṣid&quot; (aims or purposes) of sharia and &quot;maṣlaḥa&quot; (welfare or public interest) are two related classical doctrines which have come to play an increasingly prominent role in modern times. They were first clearly articulated by al-Ghazali (d. 1111 C.E/ 505 A.H), who argued that &quot;maslaha&quot; was God&#x27;s general purpose in revealing the divine law, and that its specific aim was preservation of five essentials of human well-being: religion, life, intellect, offspring, and property. Although most classical-era jurists recognized &quot;maslaha&quot; and &quot;maqāsid&quot; as important legal principles, they held different views regarding the role they should play in Islamic law. Some jurists viewed them as auxiliary rationales constrained by scriptural sources and analogical reasoning. Others regarded them as an independent source of law, whose general principles could override specific inferences based on the letter of scripture. While the latter view was held by a minority of classical jurists, in modern times it came to be championed in different forms by prominent scholars who sought to adapt Islamic law to changing social conditions by drawing on the intellectual heritage of traditional jurisprudence. These scholars expanded the inventory of &quot;maqāsid&quot; to include such aims of sharia as reform and women&#x27;s rights (Rashid Rida); justice and freedom (Mohammed al-Ghazali); and human dignity and rights (Yusuf al-Qaradawi).

==Schools of law==

The main Sunni schools of law (&quot;madhhabs&quot;) are the Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi&#x27;i and Hanbali madhhabs. They grew out of differences of opinion and methodology between the sahāba and each generation of students after them. Initially there were hundreds of schools of thought which eventually contracted into the prominent four. These four schools recognize each other&#x27;s validity and they have interacted in legal debate over the centuries. Rulings of these schools are followed across the Muslim world without exclusive regional restrictions, but they each came to dominate in different parts of the world. For example, the Maliki school is predominant in North and West Africa; the Hanafi school in South and Central Asia; the Shafi&#x27;i school in Lower Egypt, East Africa, and Southeast Asia; and the Hanbali school in North and Central Arabia.

The first centuries of Islam also witnessed a number of short-lived Sunni madhhabs. The Zahiri school, which is commonly identified as extinct, continues to exert influence over legal thought. The development of Shia legal schools occurred along the lines of theological differences and resulted in formation of the Twelver, Zaidi and Ismaili madhhabs, whose differences from Sunni legal schools are roughly of the same order as the differences among Sunni schools. The Ibadi legal school, distinct from Sunni and Shia madhhabs, is predominant in Oman.

The transformations of Islamic legal institutions in the modern era have had profound implications for the madhhab system. Legal practice in most of the Muslim world has come to be controlled by government policy and state law, so that the influence of the madhhabs beyond personal ritual practice depends on the status accorded to them within the national legal system. State law codification commonly used the methods of &quot;takhayyur&quot; (selection of rulings without restriction to a particular madhhab) and &quot;talfiq&quot; (combining parts of different rulings on the same question). Legal professionals trained in modern law schools have largely replaced traditional ulema as interpreters of the resulting laws. Global Islamic movements have at times drawn on different madhhabs and at other times placed greater focus on the scriptural sources rather than classical jurisprudence. The Hanbali school, with its particularly strict adherence to the Quran and hadith, has inspired conservative currents of direct scriptural interpretation by the Salafi and Wahhabi movements. 

Liberal interpretations of Islamic law include Indonesian ulema and Islamic scholars residing in Muslim-minority countries.

==Principles within Sunni Islam==
Islamic scholar Sayyid Rashid Rida (1865 – 1935 C.E) lists the four basic principles of Islamic law, agreed upon by all Sunni Muslims:&quot;the [well-known] sources of legislation in Islam are four: the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot;, the &quot;Sunnah&quot;, the consensus of the &quot;ummah&quot; and &quot;ijtihad&quot; undertaken by competent jurists&quot;

===The contribution of al-Shafi&#x27;i===
Al-Shafi&#x27;i documented a systematized set of principles, developing a cohesive procedure for legal derivation of verdicts. His approach contrasted with the Hanafite methodology that determined the sources from the sayings and rulings of the companions and successors. Furthermore, he raised the Sunnah to a place of prominence and restricted its legal use. According to Shafi&#x27;i, only practices directly passed down from Muhammad were valid, eliminating the legitimacy of practices of Muhammad&#x27;s followers. Prior to Shafi&#x27;i, legal reasoning included personal reasoning thus suffering from inconsistency. Shafi&#x27;i is probably best known for writing al-Risala, a prime example of applying logic and order to Islamic jurisprudence.

===Evolution of methods===
Between Shāfi&#x27;i&#x27;s &quot;Al-Risala&quot; and the next attested works of &quot;Usul al-Fiqh&quot; is a gap of several hundred years. These later works were significantly different from Shafi&#x27;is book, likely due to the insertion of Mu&#x27;tazilite and Ash&#x27;arite theology into works of jurisprudence. The difference between Shafi&#x27;i&#x27;s work and these later works in terms of both content and the large chronological gap between which they were all composed is so great that modern scholarship has questioned the status of Shafi&#x27;i as the founder of Islamic jurisprudence.

Indeed, even the division of the sources of Sunni law into four Qur&#x27;an, prophetic tradition, consensus and analogical reason was not present in Shafi&#x27;is books at all, despite Muslim scholarship generally attributing this division to him. According to Qadi al-Nu&#x27;man, one of the earliest jurists to write about usul after Shafi&#x27;i did – perhaps during Shafi&#x27;is lifetime – was Abū &#x27;Ubaid al-Qāsim b. Sallām, who actually considered the sources of law to consist of only three the Qur&#x27;an, the prophetic tradition, and consensus consisting of either scholarly consensus or consensus of the early generations. This division into four sources is most often attributed to later jurists upon whose work most Sunni jurisprudence has been modeled such as Baqillani and Abd al-Jabbar ibn Ahmad, of the Ash&#x27;arite and Mu&#x27;tazilite schools respectively. Thus, the four main sources often attributed to Shafi&#x27;i evolved into popular usage long after his death.

===Application of sources===
Even after this evolution, there are still some disputes among Sunni jurists regarding these four sources and their application. Malik ibn Anas, Ahmad ibn Hanbal and in particular Dawud al-Zahiri rejected all forms of analogical reason in authentic narrations from them, yet the later Malikites and Hanbalites and in some cases, even Zahirites gravitated toward the acceptance of varying levels of analogical reason already accepted by Shafi&#x27;ites and Hanafites. Malik and Abu Hanifa both accepted pure reason as a source of law; Ahmad and Shafi&#x27;i did not, and Shafi&#x27;i was especially hostile to juristic preference as implemented by Abu Hanifa, yet pure reason later found its way into all Sunni schools of law.

The question of consensus has evolved considerably. Abu Hanifa, Ahmad and Zahiri only accepted the consensus of the first generation of Muslims, while Malik was willing to accept the consensus of the first generation in general or the consensus of later generations within the community of Medina. Shafi&#x27;i insinuated that consensus was not practically possible to confirm. Later scholars of all schools eventually followed the views of Al-Ghazali and Ibn Taymiyyah in expanding the definition of accepted consensus to include scholarly consensus and silent consensus as well.

==Principles within Shia Islam==
In Shi&#x27;a legal theory, analogical reason is not recognised as a source of law; pure reason is, however. Shi&#x27;ites may differ in the exact application of principles depending on whether they follow the Ja&#x27;fari, Ismaili or Zaidi subdivisions of Shi&#x27;ism.

===Ja&#x27;fari principles===
There are two interpretations of what constitutes sources of law among jurists of the Ja&#x27;fari school.

*According to the Akhbari view, the only sources of law are the Quran and the Hadith, and any case not explicitly covered by one of these must be regarded as not having been provided for.
*According to the majority Usuli view, it is legitimate to seek general principles by induction, to provide for cases not expressly provided for. This process is known as ijtihad, and the intellect is recognised as a source of law. It differs from the Sunni qiyas in that it does not simply extend existing laws on a test of factual resemblance: it is necessary to formulate a general principle that can be rationally supported.

Javadi Amoli wrote about source of revelation in Shiism:
# The most important source in Shiite law is the Quran itself, which interprets itself
# The other source is the tradition of the &quot;infallibles&quot; (the family of Muhammad), according to the successive tradition (Saqalain) passed down by the family of Muhammad as well as according to the Quran itself: to accept one without the other is equivalent to rejecting both of them.
# A third source is theoretical wisdom where it is impossible to conceive the contrary, which proves the existence of God and the necessity of his unity, eternity, pre-existence, power, will and other exalted attributes: this cannot be denied with any verse.
# Although we cannot impose science upon the Quran, we can use verified scientific, experimental, historical, artistic, logical and other evidence to interpret the subject addressed in a given passage, rather than through another verse.

In doubtful cases the law is often derived not from substantive principles induced from existing rules, but from procedural presumptions (&quot;usul &#x27;amaliyyah&quot;) concerning factual probability. An example is the presumption of continuity: if one knows that a given state of affairs, such as ritual purity, existed at some point in the past but one has no evidence one way or the other whether it exists now, one can presume that the situation has not changed.

The analysis of probability forms a large part of the Shiite science of &quot;usul al-fiqh&quot;, and was developed by Muhammad Baqir Behbahani (1706–1792) and Shaykh Murtada al-Ansari (died 1864). The only primary text on Shi&#x27;ite principles of jurisprudence in English is the translation of Muhammad Baqir as-Sadr&#x27;s &quot;Durus fi &#x27;Ilm al-&#x27;Usul&quot;.

====Parts of the Shiite Uṣūl al-Fiqh====
Discussions of this science are presented in various parts in the works of uṣūl al-fiqh. However, the best division is presented by al-Muhaqqiq al-Isfahani (d. 1940) in his last course of teaching (as narrated by his great student Muhammad Rida al-Muzaffar in his Uṣūl al-Fiqh, p. 11) according to which all uṣūlī topics are discussed in the four following parts: Discussions of &quot;terms,&quot; of &quot;intellectual implications,&quot; of &quot;the authority,&quot; and of &quot;practical principles.&quot;
Discussions of terms deal with denotations and appearances of terms from a general aspect, such as appearance of the imperative in the obligation, that of the prohibition in the unlawfulness, and the like.
Discussions of intellectual implications survey implications of precepts even though such precepts may not be inferred from terms, such as discussing truthfulness of mutual implication of intellectual judgments and juristic precepts, of obligation of something necessitating obligation of its preliminaries (known as &quot;the problem of preliminary of the mandatory act&quot;), of obligation of something necessitating unlawfulness of its opposite (known as &quot;the problem of the opposite&quot;), of possibility of conjunction of the command and the prohibition, and so on.
Discussions of the authority investigate whether some specific thing is juristically treated as a proof; for instance, whether report of a single transmitter, appearances, appearances of the Quran, Sunna, consensus, intellect, and the like are authoritative proofs.
Discussions of practical principles deal with what the jurist refers to when he cannot find a persuasive proof, such as the principle of clearance from obligation, that of precaution, and so forth.

===Ismaili principles===
Most early Ismaili works within the field of the principles of jurisprudence were actually responses to Sunni works on the topic. Qadi al-Nu&#x27;man&#x27;s &quot;Differences Among the Schools of Law&quot; is most likely the first of such written responses.

<text>Short Circuit 2 is a 1988 American science fiction comedy film, the sequel to the 1986 film &quot;Short Circuit&quot;. It was directed by Kenneth Johnson and starred Fisher Stevens as Ben Jahveri, Michael McKean as Fred Ritter, Cynthia Gibb as Sandy Banatoni, and Tim Blaney as the voice of Johnny 5 (the main character – a friendly, naive, self-aware robot).

==Plot==
After being fired from Nova Robotics after the events of the first movie, Benjamin Jahveri (nee Jabituya) starts up his own business, &quot;Titanic Toy Corporation&quot;, which specializes in making sophisticated toy robots that he builds by hand from the back of his truck. For two days, Ben has been in an unspecified U.S. metropolis peddling his toy robots on the street corners. One robot wanders away from his stand and ends up in the office of Sandy Banatoni, an assistant buyer for Simpsons&#x27; toy department. Sandy tracks Ben down and orders 1,000 of his toys. Overhearing this offer is con artist Fred Ritter, who smooth-talks his way into brokering the transaction between Ben and Sandy, becoming Ben&#x27;s business partner in the deal, and later acquires the funding Ben needs from a loan shark.

Ben and Fred hire some workers and move into a derelict warehouse which, unknown to them, is the base of operations for thieves who are tunneling into a bank vault across the street to steal a set of jewels known as the Vanderveer Collection. The thieves (Saunders and Jones) assault Ben and Fred and destroy their equipment, causing the new workers to flee and preventing them from completing Sandy&#x27;s order. However, Ben&#x27;s friends Stephanie Speck and Newton Crosby have sent Johnny 5, a robot who became sentient after being struck by lightning whom Ben helped to create. When Saunders and Jones return, Johnny fends them off, then sets up self-defense mechanisms should they try to break in again. Johnny sets to work mass-producing the toys to meet Sandy&#x27;s deadline but later leaves to explore the city. He runs afoul of many people, who are rude and unfriendly to him. He befriends one man, Oscar Baldwin, who works at the bank across the street from Ben and Fred&#x27;s warehouse.

Fred, having learned that Johnny is worth $11 million, tries to sell him. Discovering this, Johnny escapes into the city, is taken into police custody, and is placed in the stolen goods warehouse, where he is claimed by Ben. Johnny uses his robotic abilities to help Ben court Sandy.

It is revealed that Oscar is the mastermind of the heist with Saunders and Jones under his employ. With time running out before the Vanderveer Collection is moved from the bank, Oscar has Saunders and Jones lock Ben and Fred in the freezer of a Chinese restaurant, while he tricks Johnny into finishing the tunnel leading to the vault. Ben and Fred get Sandy to save them, using polyphonic renditions of songs that Ben learned on his date with her as clues to their location. Discovering the Vanderveer Collection and Oscar&#x27;s true intentions, Johnny is severely damaged by Saunders and Jones per Oscar’s orders. As Ben, Fred and Sandy return to the warehouse, the police arrest Ben and Sandy as suspects in the bank vault break-in. Fred eludes capture and later finds the disheveled Johnny in an alley and informs him of Ben&#x27;s arrest.

Fred attempts to repair Johnny by breaking into a Radio Shack and following Johnny&#x27;s guidance, but with limited success. Ben and Sandy are cleared of any charges for the break-in and persuade the police to help locate Johnny. An enraged Johnny vows revenge for Oscar’s betrayal, and with Fred’s help, tracks down Oscar and his accomplices. Saunders and Jones are caught by Fred and Johnny and later arrested. However, Oscar attacks Fred and attempts to flee on a boat. Johnny gives chase and, as his backup battery dwindles, uses a crane to swing Tarzan-style to capture Oscar, who is then apprehended by police. Ben, Fred, and Sandy arrive and tend to an exhausted Johnny while the last of his power supply depletes, and is on the verge of &quot;death&quot;. Ben revives Johnny with a defibrillator.

Johnny is fully repaired and becomes a celebrity, while Ben, Fred, and Sandy start a new company called &quot;Input Inc.&quot; with Johnny as its mascot. Johnny and Ben later take the Oath of Allegiance to become United States citizens. After the ceremony, when questioned by reporters about his thoughts on becoming the country&#x27;s first robotic citizen, a gold-plated Johnny leaps into the air and exclaims &quot;I feel alive!&quot;

==Production==
&quot;Short Circuit 2&quot; had initially been developed with original film&#x27;s director John Badham, but Badham dropped out in order to do &quot;Stakeout&quot;, and was replaced by Kenneth Johnson, best known as the creator/producer of the 1970s TV series&#x27; &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot;, &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; as well as the science fiction franchise &quot;V&quot;.

Principal photography of the film took place between September 13 and December 1987 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Despite the film taking place in an American metropolis, much of the shots throughout the film featured prominent downtown Toronto landmarks. Five robots were used for filming the &quot;Johnny 5&quot; character. Reported complications arose with their hydraulic and electrical systems due to rainy and cold weather during production. The film&#x27;s budget was reportedly $15 million.

The movie was originally titled &quot;Short Circuit 2: More Input&quot;, as seen on much of the promotional material.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Short Circuit 2&quot; received mixed reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 43% based on reviews from 14 critics, with an average rating of 4.6/10. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave it a grade A−.

Vincent Canby, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, gave &quot;Short Circuit 2&quot; a negative review. He wrote: &quot;For anyone over the age of 6, the film is as much fun as wearing wet sneakers&quot;. Rita Kempley, for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, gave it a mixed review (6/10) saying: &quot;&quot;Short Circuit 2&quot; is unabashedly mawkish and sophomoric, and the actors support the technology. But if you&#x27;re a kid, or an adult with an Erector Set, you might just enjoy this summer-weight caper&quot;. Most of the positive reviews were accepting of the film&#x27;s flaws. &quot;Variety&quot; added: &quot;Mild and meek, &quot;Short Circuit 2&quot; has an uncomplicated sweetness as a successful follow-up to the original robot kiddie comedy&quot;.

Siskel &amp; Ebert, having disliked the first film, gave &quot;Short Circuit 2&quot; &quot;two thumbs up&quot;. Roger Ebert said the movie &quot;will probably seem better the younger you are&quot; but that it was &quot;pleasant&quot; and &quot;entertaining&quot;. Gene Siskel called it &quot;better than the original&quot;, said the dialogue made him &quot;laugh out loud&quot; and argued that &quot;the movie works&quot; because he &quot;felt bad&quot; when the robot was being attacked. A review in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted that &quot;Wilson and Maddock have improved considerably here. They&#x27;re just as derivative and glib, but more thoughtful. Their construction is more deft, their dialogue is better, and they make Number Five come more alive.&quot;

===Box office===
At the box office, &quot;Short Circuit 2&quot; placed 7th on its first weekend making $3,843,067. It finished with $21,630,088, down almost half from what the first &quot;Short Circuit&quot; film made. It ranked 45th at the U.S. box office in 1988.

===Accolades===
* Honored with the Winsor McCay Award [for career achievement]

The film was nominated at Saturn Awards in the categories Best Science Fiction Film and Best Special Effects (Eric Allard, Jeff Jarvis).

==Home media==
&quot;Short Circuit 2&quot; was released on August 7, 2001, and re-released on DVD on April 24, 2007, which included a &quot;making-of featurette&quot; on actor Fisher Stevens. In 2010, the film was released once again with alternative cover art. A Blu-ray disc of the film was released in April 2011, though no extras were included.

In 2021, a Blu-ray release of the movie was released in the United Kingdom, with several extras including commentary by Kenneth Johnson.

<doc id="1311110" wikidata="Q6052851" url="?curid=1311110" title="International School (Bellevue, Washington)">
<text>International School (IS) is a school for students in grades 6th–12th in the Bellevue School District. The school follows a seven by seven curriculum wherein students pursue studies in seven core academic areas for seven years of attendance. The seven core subjects included are: English, Science, Math, Social Studies, Physical Education, Fine Arts, and French.

==Admission==

Admission to International School is based on a lottery system. All students living within Bellevue School District (BSD) boundaries are eligible to enter a lottery in 5th grade, for admittance beginning in 6th grade. Lottery information can be found on www.bsd405.org. Siblings of students already enrolled get priority, and then names are drawn from the general pool for the remaining spots. International School is not affiliated with the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association (WIAA), and if students want to participate in high school sports, they can do so at their &quot;home school&quot; (the Bellevue School District high school that corresponds with their area of residence). Sports for middle school students are offered through the school and through the same partner as the other middle schools within BSD.

==History==

International School was founded in 1991 by Bellevue teachers. It was funded with a competitive $300,000 grant from the &quot;Schools for the 21st Century&quot; Commission. International School opened with 150 sixth and seventh graders in the fall of 1991, housed in an old elementary school. Later, the school was moved to its current location in an unused junior high in the Wilburton neighborhood.

==Academics==
Bellevue International offers a seven-year, seven-subject curriculum, in which students take seven years of humanities (language arts), international studies, math, science, physical education/health and fine arts. Additionally, students study French for 6–7 years, with the intention of achieving fluency, and ultimately studying subjects such as literature, history, and the Francophone world. Upper-year high school students may slightly adjust their course schedules to include Python, AP Computer Science, and/or AP Computer Science Principles.

Advanced Placement (AP) courses are available to all students, a few of which are mandatory. These include: AP English Language, English Literature, Calculus AB, Calculus BC, World History, US History, American/Comparative Government, Physics 1, Physics C, Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Science, French Language, Computer Science, Computer Science Principles, and Studio Art (Drawing).

==World Languages Program==
All students at IS are required to take 6–7 years of French. In the past, German was offered, but due to budget and personnel issues, German was gradually phased out from 2009 to 2014. Historically, about two-thirds of incoming students had taken French and one-third had participated in the German Language Program. Both programs had co-existed successfully since the founding of the International School,

Each year, students at the school put their language skills to use during the optional two-week French exchange with the Saint-Stanislas school in Nantes, available to 10th graders and up. In addition to the language programs, IS has a long-standing partnership with the Amity Institute which places native French speakers with an undergraduate degree and a career goal in education in the school as French language teaching assistants.

==Titan Robotics Club==
International School participates in FIRST programs through Titan Robotics Club. IS is home to FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team 492, FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) teams 3543 and 6541 (although team 6541 is currently retired), and FIRST Lego League (FLL) teams 2200, 2201, and 12320. The club was founded in 2000 as a way for students at IS to gain experience with Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math (STEAM) as the school offers few engineering-related classes, and it participated in its first competition in the 2001 season.

==Achievements==
The International School has been ranked 9th in the nation on &quot;Newsweek&quot; Magazine&#x27;s list of the best high schools, and currently is first. International School was also selected as a Blue Ribbon National School of Excellence in 2004 by the U.S. Department of Education.

Bellevue&#x27;s International School has received a top grade in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; Gold Medal Schools list. The weekly American news magazine ranked high schools nationwide based on college readiness and quality-adjusted exams per test taker. The International School is ranked as the 18th best high school in the country.

==Demographics==

In the 2017–2018 school year, the total student enrollment for the high school section (grades 9-12) was 312. The racial demographics are: 44% Asian, 2% Hispanic, 12% Multiracial and 41% White. 26% of students speak another first language besides English. 5% receive special education services, and 4% are eligible for free/reduced price meals.

In the 2017–2018 school year, the total student enrollment for the middle school section (grades 6-8) was 266. The racial demographics are: 1% African American, 43% Asian, 4% Hispanic, 9% Multiracial and 42% White. 29% of students speak another first language besides English. 5% receive special education services and 9% qualify for free/reduced price meals.

<text>Philip Chenier (born October 30, 1950) is an American former professional basketball player who was a shooting guard in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for ten seasons. He was also a television sports broadcaster for the NBA&#x27;s Washington Wizards.

==Early years==
Born and raised in Berkeley, California, Chenier graduated from Berkeley High School and played college basketball at the University of California in Berkeley.

==NBA playing career==
Chenier was selected fourth in the 1971 NBA Hardship Draft by the Baltimore Bullets (as well as the Carolina Cougars in the 1971 ABA Special Circumstances Draft, the Virginia Squires in the 1973 ABA Senior Draft, and the New York Nets in the 1974 ABA Draft of NBA Players), and played for the Bullets for eight seasons, from 1971 to 1979. The franchise moved from Baltimore to Washington in 1973, after his second season. He was one of the better shooting guards in the NBA for the first six seasons in his career, but he suffered a back injury early in the 1977–78 season and had season-ending surgery. The Bullets went on to win the NBA title with Kevin Grevey as the shooting guard. Chenier was never the same player after that; he came back from his surgery late the next season, but never could crack the Bullets&#x27; starting lineup again.

Chenier was released by the Bullets after the 1978–79 season, and played briefly for the Indiana Pacers and Golden State Warriors and retired after the 1980–81 season.

Chenier, who was a 1972 NBA All-Rookie Team selection, averaged 17.2 points per game for his career, and was named to three NBA All-Star teams.

In 2017, the Wizards announced that they would retire Chenier&#x27;s number 45 jersey. On March 23, 2018, Chenier&#x27;s jersey was retired.

==Broadcasting career==
Chenier, who got his start in television sports broadcasting with Home Team Sports back in 1985, has announced black college games alongside broadcasters Charlie Neil and James Brown for Black Entertainment Television. He was the color analyst for the Washington Bullets and Washington Wizards games on television from 1987 to 2017, with a final pairing for NBC Sports Washington alongside play-by-play commentator, Steve Buckhantz.

<doc id="1311117" wikidata="Q2963768" url="?curid=1311117" title="Chinese Odyssey 2002">
<text>Chinese Odyssey 2002 is a 2002 Hong Kong mo lei tau musical film written and directed by Jeffrey Lau and produced by Wong Kar-wai. It stars Tony Leung Chiu-Wai, Faye Wong, Zhao Wei and Chang Chen. It is a parody of the 1959 Huangmei opera film &quot;The Kingdom and the Beauty&quot;, with virtually the same characters. It was released during the Chinese New Year, following the practice of the Hong Kong movie industry to boost comedy ticket sales during the holiday season.

==Plot==
The film is set in Ming Dynasty, China. Li Yilong (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) is the town bully, known for his boorish manners and reckless attitude which have endeared him to no one, save his sister Feng (Vicki Zhao) who has a curious penchant for cross-dressing. It is apparent early on that both these siblings are such misfits they have virtually no prospect of marriage.

Faye Wong is cast as a runaway princess who is dressed as a man, a disguise which fools both Long and Feng. Long immediately decides that he likes his new-found friend so much that he will entrust his sister&#x27;s hand in marriage to &quot;him&quot;. The princess, of course, cannot marry another woman and tried to fend off Long&#x27;s suggestions of a match; but also, she is attracted to Long.

Emperor Zheng De (Chang Chen) also leaves his palace temporarily to search for his missing sister. He dresses like a commoner and by a twist of fate meets Feng. He is smitten with Feng, and begins to court her, while keeping his imperial identity secret from her. His motives for leaving the palace also included the fact that he is unhappy and lonely at court and wants to escape the smothering influence of the Empress Dowager (Rebecca Pan), his mother, who plays a dictatorial role in the actions of her son. A convoy of imperial guards try to protect him while he is out in town and bring the Emperor back to the palace, but unsuccessfully.

The Princess is also assisted by her &quot;fairy godmother&quot; (Athena Chu) in marrying her match. The Empress Dowager hears of her wayward children and storms Long&#x27;s house, where her children are holed up, only to hear that they wish to marry two commoners with unwholesome and eccentric tendencies. The Emperor is adamant about marrying Feng and the Empress Dowager relents, but Long is unable to pass a &quot;ring test&quot; to prove he is the destined one and the Empress Dowager forbids his marriage to her daughter.

All ends well, however. After a separation, Long is enlightened by the &quot;fairy godmother&quot; and passes the &quot;ring test&quot;. He is reunited with the Princess, the Empress Dowager accepts him, and happiness reigns.

<doc id="1311119" wikidata="Q4184856" url="?curid=1311119" title="Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act">
<text>The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA) is a 235-page Act of Congress, signed by President George W. Bush, that broadly affects United States federal terrorism laws. The act comprises several separate titles with varying subject issues. It was enacted in response to the terror attacks of September 11, 2001.

==Overview==
This act established the position of Director of National Intelligence (DNI), the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), and the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board.

The IRTPA requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to take over the conducting of pre-flight comparisons of airline passenger information to Federal Government watch lists for international and domestic flights. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) developed the Secure Flight program and issued rulemaking to implement this congressional mandate. Airline personnel will have the right to demand government-issued ID be shown if ordered by the TSA to do so, but those orders are to remain confidential, so there is no oversight as to when the airline has been ordered to request ID and when they are requesting it on their own imperative.

== Background ==
The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 was originally introduced in the Senate in response to the findings of the 9/11 Commission. The commission, established to prepare a report on the circumstances surrounding the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, published its final report in July 2004 including a list of recommendations to overhaul United States intelligence agencies and practices. S. 2845 was developed as a response to the commission&#x27;s findings and implemented some of its major recommendations.

== Legislative History ==
S. 2845 was introduced by U.S. Senator Susan M. Collins of Maine on September 23, 2004. The Senate approved the bill, 96–2, on October 6 of the same year and it was sent to the House. After debate, the House approved the bill, 282-134, with an amendment and passed it on October 16. The bill was sent to a conference to merge the House and Senate versions and the Conference Report was agreed to on December 8 (House 336-75, Senate 89-2). President George W. Bush signed the bill into law on December 17, 2004.

=== Senate Floor ===
Debate on S. 2845 began on September 27, 2004. As many as 300 amendments were proposed, though most were negotiated by the bill sponsors and the amendment proposers behind the scenes to convince them to withdraw or ruled out of order.

==== Notable Floor Actions ====

* The Senate voted 93-4 to table a Specter amendment that would have given the DNI a 10-year fixed term. The idea was that not having a fixed term would increase the position&#x27;s independence from the president.
* The Senate voted 78-19 to table a Specter amendment intended to give the DNI more power over intelligence agency operations, including the Pentagon&#x27;s day-to-day activities.
* The Senate voted 62-29 to table a Byrd amendment that would have restricted the DNI&#x27;s budget authority and the power to transfer personnel and funds.
* The Senate voted 55-37 to table a Stevens amendment that would have deleted language requiring disclosure of the overall intelligence budget from the bill.
* The Senate agreed to the McCain amendment 97-0, adding Title VII of S. 2774 to increase transportation security.
* The Senate agreed to the Hutchison amendment 96-0 to provide for air cargo safety.
* The Senate agreed to the Roberts amendment 98-0 to maintain the applicability of section 504 of the National Security Act of 1947 in relation to fund appropriations for United States intelligence and intelligence-related activities.
* The Senate agreed 96-2 to the bill on October 6, 2004.

=== House Floor ===
Speaker of the House J. Dennis Hastert introduced H.R. 10 to the floor as the House version of the intelligence overhaul bill on October 7, 2004 to be considered alongside S. 2845. H.R. 10 was passed 282-134 on October 8.

==== Notable Floor Actions ====

* On October 16, 2004, the House struck the enacting clause from S. 2845 and inserted H.R. 10, passing the bill the same day.

=== Conference ===
The bill was sent to conference on October 16, 2004 per the House&#x27;s request. Appointed conferees from both chambers met to negotiate the two versions of the bill, but discussions broke down over the budgetary authority of the DNI. The conference lasted for weeks with no progress until Senators Collins and Lieberman proposed language—in particular, the word &quot;abrogate&quot;—that softened the DNI&#x27;s budgetary powers, to which House conferees agreed. The conference report was filed on December 7, 2004 and agreed to in the House on the same day, with the Senate agreeing a day later.

=== Enactment ===
The bill was sent from the Senate to President Bush on December 15, 2004. It was signed on December 17 to become public law.

== Support ==
The Senate plan was backed by the 9/11 Commission, families of the 9/11 victims, a bipartisan coalition of senators and some House members, and the majority of the White House. The House plan was backed by the Pentagon camp, led by notably House Republicans, the Pentagon, the House and Senate Armed Services committees, and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Richard B. Myers. The final bill was supported by a bipartisan House and Senate, the White House, and the general public, including the families of the 9/11 victims.

== Provisions ==
This act established the position of Director of National Intelligence (DNI), the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), the National Counter-Proliferation Center, and the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board. It allowed for the establishment of additional national intelligence centers at the discretion of the Director of National Intelligence.

The act is formally divided into eight titles:

# &quot;Reform of the intelligence community&quot;, also known as the National Security Intelligence Reform Act of 2004
# &quot;Federal Bureau of Investigation&quot;
# &quot;Security clearances&quot;
# &quot;Transportation security&quot;
# &quot;Border protection, immigration, and visa matters&quot;
# &quot;Terrorism prevention&quot;
# &quot;Implementation of 9/11 Commission recommendations&quot;, also known as the 9/11 Commission Implementation Act of 2004
# &quot;Other matters&quot;

===Title I: National Security Intelligence Reform Act of 2004===
Title I established the position of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), the National Counterterrorism Center, and the National Counter-Proliferation Center.

==== Director of National Intelligence (DNI) ====
The Director of National Intelligence is responsible for heading the United States intelligence community. The DNI acts as the principal intelligence advisor to the president, Homeland Security, and the National Security Council, as well as direct the National Intelligence Program. The position&#x27;s duties include intelligence sharing between government branches and federal agencies, managing the national intelligence budget, and managing intelligence personnel.

==== National Counterterrorism Center ====
The National Counterterrorism Center&#x27;s objectives are to act as a centralized government organization for terrorism and counterterrorism intelligence, conduct strategic planning, and share information between intelligence agencies.

==== National Counter-Proliferation Center ====
The National Counter-Proliferation Center was established to analyze and integrate intelligence regarding proliferation, share intelligence across agencies, create a central repository of proliferation activity intelligence, and coordinate and conduct counter-proliferation activities.

=== Title II: Federal Bureau of Investigation ===
The FBI was required to create a career path for domestic intelligence work within the agency to promote collection and analysis of intelligence. The title also developed a Reserve Service of former FBI agents to be called upon in case of a national emergency under the discretion of the FBI director.

=== Title III: Security clearances ===
The president was required to denote a single department or agency to be responsible for overseeing security clearances, which could be transferred between agencies to reduce repetitive processing.

===Title IV: Transportation security===
Title IV authorizes new airport security programs including screening carry-on luggage for explosives, training foreign air marshals, creating blast-resistant cargo holds, and increased screening of airport workers. Homeland Security is required to deploy biometric screening systems at airports to obtain biological information to be used to identify individual travelers. The TSA was required to test new passenger screening systems to cross-reference &quot;no fly&quot; lists with an integrated terrorist watch list.

The title also gives Homeland Security the authority to create a terrorist watch list for cruise ships.

===Title V: Border protection, immigration, and visa matters===
Title V requires states to follow national standards for drivers license eligibility, requires visa applicants to be interviewed, offers provisions for immigrants who have received training from terrorist organizations to be deported, authorized an additional 10,000 border patrol agents to be added over five years, authorized the use of unmanned aerial vehicles to monitor the Canadian border, and created 8,000 new beds in the Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s detention center to house illegal aliens and terrorist suspects.

=== Title VI: Terrorism prevention ===
Title VI allows the FBI to conduct surveillance on individual terrorists not connected to a foreign power. The law requires that terrorist subjects be denied bail and held in jail until their trial unless they can prove they are not dangerous or flight risks. Conveying false or misleading information on a terrorist attack, actual or possible, was criminalized and made an imprisonable offense. Using the mail or any postal-like service as a means of attack with weapons of mass destruction was also specified as a criminal offense, and criminal penalties were expanded for the production, possession, and use of dirty bombs and the variola virus.

=== Title VII: Implementation of the 9/11 Commission Recommendations ===
Title VII included foreign policy provisions to improve U.S. diplomatic relations internationally. These include identification of terrorist sanctuaries, regulation of exports to state sponsors of terrorism and terrorist sanctuaries, U.S. support for democracy in Afghanistan and stability in Pakistan, strategic diplomatic efforts in Saudi Arabia, Muslim outreach, support of the UN Human Rights Commission, and free press promotion in the Muslim world

===Title VIII: Other matters===
Title VIII authorizes the DNI to establish a formal relationship between the intelligence community and the National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center, created the Office of Geospatial Management within the Department of Homeland Security, authorizes the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security to designate a senior staffer to manage civil rights and civil liberties cases for the department, requires the FBI to continually maintain and update enterprise and technology architecture and infrastructure, and requires the Office of Government ethics to submit financial disclosure reports to Congress.

== Controversy ==
The Pentagon and its supporters in the House were against the bill. They opposed giving the DNI authority over the Pentagon&#x27;s intelligence agencies and their budgets, saying the idea was troubling. The Pentagon camp, led by House Conferee Duncan Hunter, R-CA, was labeled &quot;obstructionist&quot; by supporters of the Senate version of the bill. Hunter denied this claim, arguing that they wanted a reform bill that did not damage the relationship between the secretary of defense and defense agencies.

Advocacy groups for families of the 9/11 victims blamed President Bush and House Republicans for the intelligence bill being stalled in Congress. They accused Bush of allowing members of the Republican party to derail the legislative process and named Speaker of the House J. Dennis Hastert as a responsible party for the bill&#x27;s stagnation. The Family Steering Committee released a statement saying they were &quot;angry and saddened that the opportunity for significant reform of our country&#x27;s intelligence structure has been squandered.&quot; The group Families of September 11 also came out saying that the legislators not helping to push the legislation through the House would be held accountable by voters in the upcoming election.

== Response ==
Upon the IRTPA&#x27;s passage in the Senate, President Bush released a statement calling it a historic piece of legislation that would defend America and help to protect its people from terrorism. The public response was also positive, particularly from the families of 9/11 victims who had supported the bill, however some members of Congress remained skeptical. The two senators who had voted against passing the bill, Robert C. Byrd (D-WV) and James M. Inhofe (R-OK), came out against it, expressing their regret that it had passed so quickly and without stricter provisions against illegal immigration.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation objected to Act&#x27;s potential effects on civil liberties.

<text>William Philip Cathcart Davies (6 August 1928 – 25 January 2018) played rugby union at centre for Evesham RUFC, Cheltenham RUFC, Cambridge University, Harlequins, England and the British Lions (South Africa 1955).

Davies was born at Abberley, Worcestershire. He was educated at Denstone College, Staffordshire. Phil was a member of the Cambridge University RFC tour to Japan in 1953, the first one by Cambridge after the Second World War. It took place after Oxford had toured in the previous year. He was widely considered to be an excellent centre of great physical power, and achieved a measure of celebrity in his time.

From 1953 to 1959 he taught biology at Christ&#x27;s Hospital school in Horsham, Sussex. The school gave him special leave for the British Lions tour of South Africa, which overlapped with the start of the school year. He left to become a preparatory school headmaster, first at Smallwood Manor, Uttoxeter, Staffordshire, then at Cheltenham College Junior School, Gloucestershire, and served in that post from 1964 to 1986.

A memorial service was held for him in Cheltenham College Chapel on 22 September 2018. It was attended by Steve Boyle on behalf of the British Lions.

<doc id="1311126" wikidata="Q35461" url="?curid=1311126" title="Eteocretan language">
<text>Eteocretan ( from , lit. &quot;true Cretans&quot;, itself composed from ἐτεός &quot;eteós&quot; &quot;true&quot; and Κρής &quot;Krḗs&quot; &quot;Cretan&quot;) is the pre-Greek language attested in a few alphabetic inscriptions of ancient Crete.

In eastern Crete, about half a dozen inscriptions have been found, which, though written in Greek alphabets, are clearly not Greek. These inscriptions date from the late 7th or early 6th century down to the 3rd century BC. The language, which so far cannot be translated, is probably a survival of a language spoken on Crete before the arrival of the proto-Greek language and is probably derived from the Minoan language preserved in the Linear A inscriptions of a millennium earlier. Since that language remains undeciphered, it is not certain that Eteocretan and Minoan are related, although this is very likely.

Ancient testimony suggests that the language is that of the Eteocretans (meaning &#x27;true Cretans&#x27;). The term &quot;Eteocretan&quot; is sometimes applied to the Minoan language (or languages) written more than a millennium earlier in so-called Cretan &#x27;hieroglyphics&#x27; (almost certainly a syllabary) and in the Linear A script. Yves Duhoux, a leading authority on Eteocretan, has stated that &quot;it is essential to rigorously separate the study of Eteocretan from that of the &#x27;hieroglyphic&#x27; and Linear A inscriptions&quot;.

== Ancient Greek sources ==
Odysseus, after returning home and pretending to be a grandson of Minos, tells his wife Penelope about his alleged homeland of Crete:
In the first century AD the geographer Strabo noted the following about the settlement of the different &#x27;tribes&#x27; of Crete:

Indeed, more than half the known Eteocretan texts are from Praisos (Strabo&#x27;s Πρᾶσος); the others were found at Dreros (modern Driros).

== Inscriptions ==
There are five inscriptions which are clearly Eteocretan, two of them bilingual with Greek. Three more fragments may be Eteocretan. The Eteocretan corpus is documented and discussed in Duhoux&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Étéocrétois: les textes—la langue&quot;.

=== Dreros ===
The two bilingual inscriptions, together with six other Greek inscriptions, were found in the western part of the large Hellenistic cistern next to the east wall of the Delphinion (temple of Apollo Delphinios) in Dreros, at a depth between three and four metres. The texts are all written in the archaic Cretan alphabet and date from the late seventh or early sixth century BC. They record official religious and political decisions and probably came from the east wall of the Delphinion; they were published by Henri Van Effenterre in 1937 and 1946 and were kept in the museum at Neapolis.

The longer of these two inscriptions was found in the autumn of 1936 but not published until 1946. The Greek part of the text is very worn and could not easily be read. Almost certainly with modern technology the Greek part would yield more but the inscription was lost during the occupation of the island in World War II. Despite searches over 70 years, it has not been found.

The other Dreros inscription was also published by Van Effenterre in 1946. The Eteocretan part of the text has disappeared, only the fragment τυπρμηριηια (&quot;tuprmēriēia&quot;) remaining.

=== Praisos (&quot;or&quot; Praesos) ===
The other three certain Eteocretan inscriptions were published by Margherita Guarducci in the third volume of &quot;Inscriptiones Creticae, Tituli Cretae Orientalis&quot;, in 1942. The inscriptions are archived in the Archeological Museum at Heraklion. Raymond A. Brown, who examined these inscriptions in the summer of 1976, has published them online with slightly different transcriptions than those given by Guarducci.

The earliest of these inscriptions is, like the Dreros one, written in the archaic Cretan alphabet and likewise dates from the late 7th or early 6th century BC. The second of the Praisos inscriptions is written in the standard Ionic alphabet, except for &quot;lambda&quot; which is still written in the archaic Cretan style; it probably dates from the 4th century BC. The third inscription, dating probably from the 3rd century BC, is written in the standard Ionic alphabet with the addition of &quot;digamma&quot; or &quot;wau&quot;.

=== Psychro ===
Some publications also list the Psychro or Epioi inscription as Eteocretan, but some scholars deem it to be a modern forgery. They base their assessment on the fact that the inscription has five words, which bear no obvious resemblance to the language of the Dreros and Praisos inscriptions, apparently written in the Ionic alphabet of the third century BC, with the addition of three symbols which resemble the Linear A script of more than a millennium earlier. Their reasoning has since been challenged as unsubstantiated.

=== Other possible fragmentary inscriptions ===
Guarducci included three other fragmentary inscriptions; two of these fragments were also discussed by Yves Duhoux. The latter also discussed several other fragmentary inscriptions which might be Eteocretan. All these inscriptions, however, are so very fragmentary that it really is not possible to state with any certainty that they may not be Greek.

== Description ==
The inscriptions are too few to give much information about the language.

=== Lexicon ===
The early inscriptions written in the archaic Cretan alphabet do mark word division; the same goes for the two longer inscriptions from the fourth and third centuries BC.

From the Dreros inscriptions are the following words: &quot;et isalabre komn men inai isaluria lmo tuprmēriēia&quot;. &quot;Komn&quot; and &quot;lmo&quot; seem to show that /n/ and /l/ could be syllabic. As to the meanings of the words, nothing can be said with any certainty. Van Effenterre suggested:
* &quot;inai&quot; = Dorian Cretan ἔϝαδε (= classical Greek ἅδε, third singular aorist of ἅνδάνω) &quot;it pleased [the council, the people]&quot;, i. e. &quot;it was decided [that …]&quot;. The word ἔϝαδε occurs in the Greek part of the bilingual text, and all but one of the other Greek texts from the Delphinion in Dreros.
* &quot;tuprmēriēia&quot; = καθαρὸν γένοιτο in the Greek part of the inscription, i. e. &quot;may it become pure&quot;.

Also, Van Effenterree noted that the word τυρό(ν) (&quot;cheese&quot;) seems to occur twice in the Greek part of the first Dreros bilingual and suggested the text concerned the offering of goat cheese to Leto, the mother goddess of the Delphinion triad, and that the words &quot;isalabre&quot; and &quot;isaluria&quot; were related words with the meaning of &quot;(goat) cheese&quot;.

The only clearly complete word on the earliest Praisos inscription is &quot;barze&quot;, and there is no indication of its meaning.

The other two Praisos inscriptions do not show word breaks. It has, however, been noted that in the second line of the fourth century inscription is &quot;phraisoi inai&quot; (φραισοι ιναι), and it has been suggested that it means &quot;it pleased the Praisians&quot; (ἔϝαδε Πραισίοις).

=== Classification ===
Though meager, the inscriptions show a language that bears no obvious kinship to Indo-European or Semitic languages; the language appears to have no obvious relation to any other known ancient language of the Aegean or Asia Minor. Raymond A. Brown, after listing a number of words of pre-Greek origin from Crete suggests a relation between Eteocretan, Lemnian (Pelasgian), Minoan, and Tyrrhenian, coining the name &quot;Aegeo-Asianic&quot; for the proposed language family. This proposed group of languages is supported by G.M. Facchetti and S. Yatsemirsky, and was suggested to have a link to the pre-Indo-European languages of Anatolia by archaeologist James Mellaart. In whichever case, unless further inscriptions, especially bilingual ones, are found, the Eteocretan language must remain &#x27;unclassified.&#x27;

While Eteocretan is possibly descended from the Minoan language of the Linear A inscriptions of a millennium earlier, until there is an accepted decipherment of Linear A, that language must also remain unclassified and the question of a relationship between the two remains speculative, especially as there seem to have been other non-Greek languages spoken in Crete.

<text>Ruth Carter Stapleton (&quot;née&quot; Carter; August 7, 1929 – September 26, 1983) was an American Christian evangelist. She was the younger sister of United States President Jimmy Carter and Rosalynn Carter’s best friend.

==Early life and family==
Ruth Carter Stapleton was born on August 7, 1929, in Plains, Georgia, the third of the four children in the family of James Earl Carter, Sr. and Lillian Gordy Carter.

Besides the former president, Stapleton had an older sister, Gloria (1926–1990), and a younger brother, Billy (1937–1988). All three of them died of pancreatic cancer, as did their father.

==Education, career, and family==
Stapleton attended Georgia State College for Women, earned her bachelor&#x27;s in English from Methodist University, and her master&#x27;s in psychology from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Stapleton married Robert Thome Stapleton (1925–2014), a veterinarian, in 1948 and they had four children: Gloria Lynn (born May 31, 1950), Sydney Scott (December 23, 1951 – December 13, 2019), Patricia Gordy (born May 29, 1954) and Robert Michael (born November 5, 1958). Stapleton suffered from chronic depression, and was involved in a car accident that nearly killed her during the time immediately following her children&#x27;s births. She said she was later cured of depression at a &quot;Christ-centered camp&quot;.

In 1977, she became friends with pornographer Larry Flynt and managed to briefly convert him to Christianity. She was portrayed during this portion of Flynt&#x27;s life by Donna Hanover in the film &quot;The People vs. Larry Flynt&quot;.

Stapleton was also known for her involvement in the faith-healing ministry, especially in healing memories. Her books &quot;The Gift of Inner Healing&quot;, &quot;The Experience of Inner Healing&quot;, and &quot;In His Footsteps: The Healing Ministry of Jesus, Then and Now&quot;, illustrate her beliefs about inner healing, which involved healing memories, in which one would go over one&#x27;s memories and bring Jesus into the memory to help one forgive or be comforted as required by Jesus.

==Death==
Stapleton died of pancreatic cancer on September 26, 1983, aged 54. One month after her death, her mother died of breast cancer, aged 85.

<text>:&quot;Note that this is an article about the 1994 Norwegian remake of the original. See The Julekalender for information about the original Danish series, or The Joulukalenteri for the Finnish remake.&quot;

The Julekalender (Christmas calendar) is a Norwegian Christmas season television series produced by and starring Travellin&#x27; Strawberries (Ivar Gafseth, Tore Johansen, Erling Mylius) in collaboration with Saks Film and Entertainment and TV 2 (Norway), 1994. Around 400,000 viewers followed the series in December 1994, and it has since been broadcast in reruns later years. It was based on the Danish series &quot;The Julekalender&quot; from 1991, which also inspired a Finnish version in 1997. The original concept and script of the series, as well as its numerous songs came from the Danish trio of De Nattergale (Carsten Knudsen, Uffe Rødbæk Madsen and Viggo Sommer).

The characters spoke Norwenglish, a pidgin of English and Norwegian.
The series consisted of 24 episodes (for each day until Christmas), and its production crew came from Trondheim, Norway.

==Characters==
* Nisses – mischievous Christmas gnomes/elves.
** Good old gammel nok (Arve Opsahl) – literally &quot;good old old enough,&quot; the oldest and wisest nisse, who will die unless someone finds the winding key to the &quot;play dåse&quot;, a music box.
** Hansi, Fritz and Günther (Travellin&#x27; Strawberrys) – the three bravest nisses, who undertake this quest.
* Nåså – greedy vampires wearing business suits and obsessed with money and wealth, they look human until they drink alcohol and reveal their real form, huge glasses and sharp teeth.
** Benny Jensen – a travelling salesman (or so he claims) who turns out to be a nåså. There is also a large clash between the two different ways of life (as Benny comes to move in with Olaf and Gjertrud in episode 5, as his car runs out of petrol, punctures, breaks down completely, and then gets stolen, supposedly by &quot;Polish mafia&quot;).
* Olaf and Gjertrud Sand – a couple of highly stereotypical Trøndere (People from Trøndelag) that the same three actors also play: Olaf and Gjertrud Sand, a country bumpkin couple that live and work on a potato farm with their dog Kvikk. Olaf and Gjertrud speak with a broad rural (Trønder) accent, often leading to Benny misunderstanding what they say.

==Plot==
A long time ago, in ancient Trøndelag, the nisses lived merrily in their caves, unknown to the human populace of Trondheim.

One day, the wicked nåsås arrived. The nåsås killed many nisses and drove them out of their caves. The nisses in the only cave the nåsås missed hid &quot;Den Store Kloke Boken&quot; (the big wise book). If nåsås ever possess the book, they will discover the secret to increasing tax rate up to 100% and infiltrate all positions of bureaucracy and rule the world.

&quot;Good Old Gammel Nok&quot;, the surviving leader of the nisses, sent the three bravest nisses, Hansi, Fritz and Günther, on a quest to find the winding key of the &quot;play dåse&quot;, a musical box playing his life-tune. &quot;Good Old Gammel Nok&quot; warned our heroes of the dangers of the nåsås and gave them &#x27;Den Store Kloke Boken&#x27; to consult for wisdom.

<doc id="1311134" wikidata="Q190454" url="?curid=1311134" title="Cerebral salt-wasting syndrome">
<text>Cerebral salt-wasting syndrome (CSWS), also written cerebral salt wasting syndrome, is a rare endocrine condition featuring a low blood sodium concentration and dehydration in response to injury (trauma) or the presence of tumors in or surrounding the brain. In this condition, the kidney is functioning normally but excreting excessive sodium. The condition was initially described in 1950. Its cause and management remain controversial. In the current literature across several fields, including neurology, neurosurgery, nephrology, and critical care medicine, there is controversy over whether CSWS is a distinct condition, or a special form of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms of CSWS include large amounts of urination (polyuria, defined as over three liters of urine output over 24 hours in an adult), high amounts of sodium in the urine, low blood sodium concentration, excessive thirst (polydipsia), extreme salt cravings, dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system (dysautonomia), and dehydration. Patients often self-medicate by consuming high amounts of sodium and by dramatically increasing their water intake. Advanced symptoms include muscle cramps, lightheadedness, dizziness or vertigo, feelings of anxiety or panic, increased heart rate or slowed heart rate, low blood pressure and orthostatic hypotension which can result in fainting. Other symptoms frequently associated with dysautonomia include headaches, pallor, malaise, facial flushing, constipation or diarrhea, nausea, acid reflux, visual disturbances, numbness, nerve pain, trouble breathing, chest pain, loss of consciousness, and seizures.

==Causes==
Although the pathophysiology of CSWS is not fully understood, it is usually caused by neurological injury, most commonly aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. It is also reported after surgery for pituitary tumor, acoustic neuroma, calvarial remodeling, glioma and with infections including tuberculous meningitis, viral meningitis, metastatic carcinoma, and cranial trauma.

==Diagnosis==
CSWS is a diagnosis of exclusion and may be difficult to distinguish from the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), which develops under similar circumstances and also presents with hyponatremia. The main clinical difference is that of total fluid status of the patient: CSWS leads to a relative or overt low blood volume whereas SIADH is consistent with a normal or high blood volume (due to water reabsorption via the V2 receptor). If blood-sodium levels increase when fluids are restricted, SIADH is more likely. Additionally, urine output is classically low in SIADH and elevated in CSWS.

==Treatment==
While CSWS usually appears within the first week after brain injury and spontaneously resolves in 2–4 weeks, it can sometimes last for months or years. In contrast to the use of fluid restriction to treat SIADH, CSWS is treated by replacing the urinary losses of water and sodium with hydration and sodium replacement. The mineralocorticoid medication fludrocortisone can also improve the low sodium level.

==History==
In 1858, Claude Bernard first raised the possibility of a direct relationship between the central nervous system and renal excretion of osmotically active solutes. He found that a unilateral lesion in the reticular substance at the floor of the fourth ventricle produced a diuresis of chloride, but not glucose. Bernard reproduced this syndrome through renal denervation. Through medullary lesioning in animals, Jungmann and Meyer from Germany induced polyuria and increased urinary salt excretion in 1913. Water intake restriction did not stop the polyuria, and salt continued to be excreted in the urine despite. In 1936, McCance defined the consequences of salt depletion in normal human. Patients with extra-renal salt losses complicated by hyponatremia were found to be common-place, and consistent with McCance&#x27;s description, they excreted urine virtually free of sodium.

Shortly after World War II, the flame photometer was developed. The availability of the flame photometer made clinical determinations of the serum sodium concentration possible. Berry, Barnes and Richardson shared the production of this new device to measure sodium and potassium in solution of biological materials by means of the flame photometer in 1945. Yale was one of the first medical centers to have that new device, the flame photometer, so some of the first published observations about hyponatremia came from Yale.

Almost a century after the pioneering work of Bernard in animals, Peters et al., in 1950, reported three patients seen at Yale New Haven Hospital with hyponatremia associated with varying cerebral pathologies and severe dehydration. In each patient, urine sodium losses persisted despite hyponatremia and a high-salt diet. All three patients were unable to prevent urinary sodium loss despite low serum sodium levels and no evidence of extrarenal sodium loss. Their hyponatremia responded to salt therapy. They postulated that this provided evidence of an extra-pituitary cerebral structure mediating normal sodium metabolism but were unsure of its location or mechanism of action. A subsequent paper from the group at Yale attributed hyponatremia in neurologic disease to SIADH.

The normal regulatory mechanism of renal adjustment of salt and water balance was better understood in 1950s. The responsibility for the maintenance of a normal volume and tonicity of the body fluids devolves on the kidneys. This modern concept of renal physiology described the transformation of a large volume of glomerular filtrate to a much smaller volume of bladder urine which has been altered. The proximal portion of renal tubule is largely responsible for the decrease in volume of the filtrate and, to less extent, for alterations in composition. However, it is in the distal tubule that induced fine adjustment of water and sodium balance. In 1953, Leaf et al., demonstrated that exogenous administration of the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin resulted in hyponatremia and a natriuresis dependent on water retention and weight gain. This was not &quot;salt wasting&quot;; it was a physiologic response to an expanded intravascular volume. Vasopressin-ADH administration to normal humans was shown to result in water retention and urinary loss of electrolytes (primarily sodium) in other studies at the time.

The term &quot;cerebral salt wasting&quot; (CSW) was coined by Cort in 1954. The title of a paper by Cort describing a patient with a thalamic glioma resulting in hydrocephalus and raised intracranial pressure (although it is prudent to note that the earlier-described work by Peters, Welt and colleagues in 1950 was presented in a paper entitled &quot;A salt-wasting syndrome associated with cerebral disease&quot;). This patient was hyponatremic and clinically dehydrated with initial salt therapy not reversing this. Salt restriction resulted in ongoing natriuria. Recommencement of salt therapy subsequently increased serum sodium. Treatment with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and deoxycortone acetate (having potent mineralocorticoid activity) had no effect. The author postulated an external influence on renal function not adrenal or pituitary in origin. Unfortunately, the patient died three and a half weeks later in &quot;circulatory failure with terminal shock&quot;. At autopsy, the pituitary and adrenal glands were normal. Given Bernard&#x27;s ability to create a chloride diuresis without glycosuria though renal denervation, Cort postulated the existence of a neuronal connection between the hypothalamus and proximal tubule of the kidney influencing electrolyte reabsorption. In all above-described cases, there was evidence of hyponatremia and dehydration. In the ensuing years, however, hyponatremia in cerebral pathology was described without clinical or laboratory evidence of dehydration. Renal and adrenal function appeared intact, but, unlike in the earlier case of &quot;cerebral salt wasting&quot; described by Cort, an increase in renal absorption and plasma concentration of sodium occurred with administration of ACTH and deoxycortone acetate. A study on a 5-month-old female infant with diffuse cerebral damage and hyponatremia in 1957 suggested that on normal fluid intakes the child was unable to excrete solute-free water in a normal manner. This may represent the result of damage to the cerebral osmoreceptors as part of generalized brain damage. The data do not support the concept that the hyponatremia resulted from true salt-wasting, either cerebral or renal in mediation. If correction of such a state is desirable, the most useful therapeutic measure would appear to be limitation of the intake of fluid to slightly more than the amount needed to cover water expenditure from insensible losses, obligatory urine volume and growth requirements.

The term &quot;cerebral hyponatremia&quot; was suggested in the work of Epstein, et al. 1961. Inappropriate release of endogenous vasopressin is probably responsible for hyponatremia in tuberculous meningitis. Inability to excrete water normally is also a feature of the salt wasting of certain hyponatremic patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Similarly, it has been suggested that inappropriate release of vasopressin is the cause of hyponatremia and renal salt wasting in certain diseases, including bronchogenic carcinoma, cerebral injuries, and malformations.

In 1981, Nelson et al. studied hyponatremia in neurosurgical patients, primarily subarachnoid hemorrhage, and found that isotopically measured blood volumes were contracted; he attributed this finding to cerebral salt wasting (CSW). Following these publications, the term &quot;CSW&quot; vanished from the literature for over two decades with hyponatremia in patients with cerebral pathology assumed to result from SIADH. Then, in 1981, a study of twelve neurosurgical patients mainly with SAH found ten to have decreased red blood cell mass, plasma volume, and total blood volume despite &quot;fulfilling laboratory criteria&quot; for SIADH. Other authors associated hyponatremia in subarachnoid hemorrhage with increased levels of natriuretic peptides, negative sodium balance, and low central venous pressure.

A valid diagnosis of &quot;salt wasting&quot; requires evidence of inappropriate urinary salt losses and a reduced &quot;effective arterial blood volume&quot;. Unfortunately, there is no gold standard to define inappropriate urinary sodium excretion. &quot;Effective arterial blood volume&quot; is a concept, not a measurable variable; in fact, we often define it clinically by looking at urine sodium excretion.

William Schwartz (1922–2009) attended Duke University after serving in the US Army in World War II. He observed that sulfanilamide increased excretion of sodium in patients with heart failure. This observation was the basis for the discovery and development of modern diuretic drugs. Frederic Bartter (1914–1983) worked on hormones affecting the kidney that led to the discovery of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) in 1957 and Bartter syndrome in 1963. Schwartz-Bartter syndrome is named after these two scientists. The first reports of hyponatremia and renal sodium loss corrected by fluid restriction in patients with bronchogenic carcinoma were published by Bartter. At that time, no direct measurement of vasopressin was done.

<text>Harry Gordon Frankfurt (May 29, 1929 – July 16, 2023) was an American philosopher. He was a professor emeritus of philosophy at Princeton University, where he taught from 1990 until 2002. Frankfurt also taught at Yale University, Rockefeller University, and Ohio State University.

Frankfurt made significant contributions to such fields as ethics and philosophy of mind. The attitude of caring played a central role in his philosophy. To care about something means to see it as important and reflects the person&#x27;s character. According to Frankfurt, a person is someone who has second-order volitions or who cares about what desires he or she has. He contrasts persons with wantons. Wantons are beings that have desires but do not care about which of their desires is translated into action. In the field of ethics, Frankfurt gave various influential counterexamples, so-called Frankfurt cases, against the principle that moral responsibility depends on the ability to do otherwise. His most popular book is &quot;On Bullshit&quot;, which discusses the distinction between bullshitting and lying.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Frankfurt was born David Bernard Stern at a home for unwed mothers in Langhorne, Pennsylvania, on May 29, 1929, and did not know his biological parents. Shortly after his birth, he was adopted by a middle-class Jewish family and given a new name, Harry Gordon Frankfurt. His adoptive parents, Bertha (née Gordon) and Nathan Frankfurt, a piano teacher and a bookkeeper, respectively, raised him in Brooklyn and Baltimore. He attended Johns Hopkins University, where he obtained his Bachelor of Arts in 1949 and Doctor of Philosophy in 1954, both in philosophy.

===Career===
Frankfurt was professor emeritus of philosophy at Princeton University.
He previously taught at Ohio State University (1956–1962), SUNY Binghamton (1962–1963), Rockefeller University (from 1963 until the philosophy department was closed in 1976), Yale University (from 1976, where he served as chair of the philosophy department 1978–1987), and then Princeton University (1990–2002).

His major areas of interest included moral philosophy, philosophy of mind and action, and 17th-century rationalism. His 2005 book &quot;On Bullshit&quot;, originally published in 1986 as a paper on the concept of &quot;bullshit&quot;, unexpectedly became a bestseller, which led to his making media appearances such as on Jon Stewart&#x27;s late-night television program, &quot;The Daily Show&quot;. In this work he explains how bullshitting is different from lying, in that it is an act that has no regard for the truth. He argues that &quot;It is impossible for someone to lie unless he thinks he knows the truth. Producing bullshit requires no such conviction.&quot; In 2006, he followed up with &quot;On Truth&quot;, a companion book in which he explored the dwindling appreciation in society for truth.

Among philosophers, he was for a time best known for his interpretation of Descartes&#x27;s rationalism. His most influential work, however, is on freedom of the will (on which he wrote numerous important papers) based on his concept of higher-order volitions and for developing &quot;Frankfurt cases&quot; (also known as &quot;Frankfurt counter-examples&quot;, which are thought experiments designed to demonstrate the possibility of situations in which a person could not have done other than he/she did, but in which our intuition is to say nonetheless that this feature of the situation does not prevent that person from being morally responsible). Frankfurt&#x27;s view of compatibilism is perhaps the most influential version of compatibilism, developing the view that to be free is to have one&#x27;s actions conform to one&#x27;s more reflective desires. Frankfurt&#x27;s version of compatibilism is the subject of a substantial number of citations. In 2004, he published a book on love and caring, &quot;The Reasons of Love&quot;.

Frankfurt was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1995. He was a Visiting Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford University; he served as president, Eastern Division, American Philosophical Association; and he received grants and fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, the Andrew Mellon Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities.

== Philosophy ==
=== Caring and importance ===
According to Frankfurt, a lot of the philosophical discourse concerns either the domain of epistemology, which asks what we should believe, or ethics, which asks how we should act. He argues that there is another branch of inquiry that has received less attention, namely the question of what has importance or what we should care about. An agent cares about something if he/she has a certain attitude of the will: He/she sees the entity in question as important to them. For Frankfurt, what we care about reflects our personal character or who we are. This also affects the person on the practical level concerning how he/she acts and leads his/her life.

In the academic literature, caring is often understood as a subjective attitude in contrast to importance as an objective factor. On this view, the importance of something determines whether it is appropriate to care about it: people should care about important things but not about unimportant ones. Frankfurt defends a different perspective on this issue by arguing that caring about something makes this thing important. So when a person starts caring about something, this thing becomes important to them even if it was unimportant to them before. Frankfurt explains this in terms of needs: the caring attitude brings with it a need. Because of this need, the cared-for thing can affect the person&#x27;s well-being and has thereby become important to them. Yitzhak Benbaji terms this relation between caring and importance &quot;Frankfurt&#x27;s Care-Importance Principle&quot;. He rejects it based on the claim that at least some cases of the caring attitude are misguided. This usually involves situations in which the agent has a wrong belief that the object of their caring would affect their well-being. In one example, the agent follows a charlatan&#x27;s health advice to avoid a certain type of food. Benbaji argues that this constitutes a counterexample because the person cares about avoiding this food even though it has no impact on their health or their well-being.

=== Personhood ===
Persons are characterized by certain attributes or capacities, like reason, moral responsibility, and self-consciousness. However, there is wide disagreement, both within the academic discourse and between different cultures about what the essential features of personhood are. One influential and precisely formulated account of personhood is given by Frankfurt in his &quot;Freedom of the Will and the Concept of a Person&quot;. He holds that persons are beings that have second-order volitions. A volition is an effective desire, i.e. a desire that the agent is committed to realizing. Not all desires become volitions: humans usually have many desires but put only some of them into action. For example, the agent may have one desire to eat an unhealthy cake but follows their other desire to have a healthy salad instead. In this case, eating the cake is a mere desire while eating the salad is a volition. Frankfurt places great importance on the difference between first- and second-order desires. Most regular desires, like the desire to eat healthy food or to buy a car, are first-order desires. Second-order desires are desires about desires. So the desire to have a desire to eat healthy food is a second-order desire. Entities with first-order desires care about what the world around them is like, for example, whether they own a car or not. Entities with second-order desires care also about themselves, i.e. what they themselves are like and what mental states they possess. A second-order desire becomes a second-order volition if it is effective, i.e. if the agent is committed to realizing it by fostering the corresponding first-order desire. Frankfurt sees this as the mark of personhood because entities with second-order volitions do not just have desires but care about which desires they have. So persons are committed to the desires they have.
According to Frankfurt, not every entity with a mind is a person. He refers to such entities as &quot;wantons&quot;. Wantons have desires and follow them but do not care about their own will. In this regard, they are indifferent to which of their desires become effective and are translated into action. Frankfurt holds that personhood is an important feature of humans but not of other animals. However, even some humans may be wantons at times. Various of Frankfurt&#x27;s examples of such cases involve some forms of akrasia in which a person acts according to a first-order desire that he/she does not want to have on the second order. For example, a struggling drug addict may follow his/her first-order desire to take drugs despite having a second-order desire to stop wanting drugs.

=== Moral responsibility and principle of alternative possibilities ===
The term &quot;moral responsibility&quot; refers to the forward-looking moral obligation to perform certain actions and to the backward-looking status of being worthy of blame or praise for having done something or having failed to do so. An important principle in this regard is the &quot;principle of alternative possibilities&quot;. It states that &quot;a person is morally responsible for what she has done only if she could have done otherwise&quot;. Having this ability to do otherwise is usually associated with having free will. So under normal circumstances, a person is morally responsible for stealing someone&#x27;s lunch at the cafeteria. However, this may not be the case under special circumstances, for example, if a neurological disorder compelled them to do it. Frankfurt has rejected the principle of alternative possibilities based on a series of counterexamples, the so-called &quot;Frankfurt cases&quot;. In one example, Allison&#x27;s father has implanted a computer chip in Allison&#x27;s head without her knowing. This chip would force Allison to walk her dog. However, Allison freely decides to do so and the chip is thus not activated. Frankfurt argues that, in this case, Allison is morally responsible for walking her dog even though she lacked the ability to do otherwise. The crux of this and similar cases is that the agent is morally responsible because he/she acted in accordance with his/her own will. This is so despite the fact that, usually unbeknownst to the agent, there was no real alternative. This line of thought has led Frankfurt to advocate a form of compatibilism: If free will and moral responsibility do not depend on the ability to do otherwise, then they could even exist in a fully deterministic world. Frankfurt cases have provoked a significant discussion of the principle of alternative possibilities. However, not everyone agrees that they are successful at disproving it.

==Personal life and death==
Harry Frankfurt was first married to Marilyn Rothman. They had two daughters. The marriage ended in divorce. He then married Joan Gilbert.

Frankfurt was an amateur classical pianist. He started taking piano lessons from an early age, initially from his mother who hoped that he might pursue a career as a concert pianist. Frankfurt continued to play piano and receive lessons throughout his life, alongside his philosophical career. According to Frankfurt, becoming a professor of philosophy was acceptable to his mother, seeing as it was &quot;close enough&quot; to her other ambition for him, which was to become a rabbi.

Frankfurt died of congestive heart failure in Santa Monica, California, on July 16, 2023, at age 94.

<doc id="1311148" wikidata="Q36209" url="?curid=1311148" title="Kumyk language">
<text>Kumyk (, , ) is a Turkic language spoken by about 520,000 people, mainly by the Kumyks, in the Dagestan, North Ossetia and Chechen republics of the Russian Federation. Until the 20th century Kumyk was the lingua franca of the Northern Caucasus.

== Classification ==
Kumyk language belongs to the Kipchak-Cuman subfamily of the Kipchak family of the Turkic languages. It&#x27;s a descendant of the Cuman language, with likely influence from the Khazar language, and in addition contains words from the Bulghar and Oghuz substratum. The closest languages to Kumyk are Karachay-Balkar, Crimean Tatar, and Karaim languages.

Nikolay Baskakov, based on a 12th-century scripture named Codex Cumanicus, included modern Kumyk, Karachai-Balkar, Crimean Tatar, Karaim, and the language of Mamluk Kipchaks in the linguistic family of the Cuman-Kipchak language. Samoylovich also considered Cuman-Kipchak close to Kumyk and Karachai-Balkar.

Amongst the dialects of the Kumyk there are Kaitag, Terek (Güçük-yurt and Braguny), Buynaksk (Temir-Khan-Shura) and Xasavyurt. The latter two became basis for the literary language.

== History ==
Kumyk had been a lingua-franca of the bigger part of the Northern Caucasus, from Dagestan to Kabarda, until the 1930s and was an official language of communication between the North-Eastern Caucasian nations and the Russian administration. The language was known in Dagestan as simply Muslim language (, &quot;busurman til&quot;, بوسورمان تیل) due to its dominant role as the intertribal language of communication among various Muslim communities of the region.

The historian Georgi Derluguian made the following analogy with regards to the role of Turkic languages in the Caucasus and beyond:

In 1848, a professor of the &quot;Caucasian Tatar&quot; (Kumyk) Timofey Makarov published the first ever grammatical book in the Russian language for one of the Northern Caucasian languages, which was international Kumyk. Makarov wrote:
During the Soviet era, the role of Kumyk was consolidated when in 1923, it was declared to be the state language of Dagestan ASSR due to the fact that &quot;the majority of the population of indigenous Dagestan speaks and understands the Turkic-Kumyk language... the experience of teaching the Turkic language in the schools of Mountainous Dagestan gave brilliant results... it was noted... that the “Turkic-Kumyk” language is the only language of communication of the citizens of indigenous Dagestan.&quot;

Over the decades, this has changed, and Russian has displaced Kumyk as the language of education and inter-ethnic communication in Dagestan. Today, more than 90% of the Kumyks, according to 2010 census, also speak Russian, and those in Turkey and the Levant speak Turkish and Arabic accordingly.

== Phonology ==

== Orthography ==

Kumyk has been used as a lingua franca in Dagestan and Caucasus for some time.

The historic literary culture of Kumyks and the entire region of Dagestan, North Caucasus, and Southern Ukraine was the Cuman language. Kumyk is a direct descendant of Cuman, and its centuries-long literaray tradition was a direct continuation of Cuman. 

The oldest record of Kumyk language being written in the Arabic script, goes back to the mid-17th century. From the beginning of the 19th century, Kumyk literary language began to expand and grow, with an increase in the number of publications and books.

The orthography of Kumyk was derived from the Arabic script, although with minor modifications, only several additional letters, same as in Persian alphabet, to represent consonants. Vowels, of which there exists a relatively large number of them in Turkic languages, and in Kumyk in particular (8 or 9 vowels) were rarely and irregularly written in the Arabic script, with the use of &quot;matres lectionis&quot;, the three letters &quot;ʾalif&quot; , &quot;wāw&quot; and &quot;yāʾ&quot; . This meant that, overall, this script was far from being adapted to Kumyk phonology.

In the beginning of the 20th century, parallel with other Turkic-Muslim minority ethnic groups within the Russian Empire, Kumyk speaking literaturists decided to undertake the task of standardization and improvement of the Arabic script. It was in this era that Kumyk literature flourished, and many poets, educators, and publishers rose. The first attempt at compiling an improved orthographic convention was done in 1915, by &quot;Abdulhalim Jengutaevsky&quot; in the preface of his Kumyk translation of the poem Layla and Majnun, published in Temir-Khan-Shura.

In the following years, vowel representations were standardized, and Arabic letters that had the same pronunciation in Karachay-Balkar were dropped and consolidated (For example, the letters ث and ص were dropped in favour of the letter س).

Later, as part of a new state campaign of Latinisation, a Latin alphabet was developed for Kumyk, derived from Yañalif, being officially adopted in 1928.

In the 1930s, the official Soviet policy was revised and the process of Cyrillization of Soviet languages was started. In 1938 the new alphabet based on Cyrillic letters was officially adopted, which remains the official alphabet for Kumyk up till today.

With the fall of the Soviet Union, with an increased prospect in international connection among Turkic peoples, a project to develop Latin alphabet again, but derived from modern Turkish orthograhpy was undertaken. Several online publications, as well as many individuals using social media, have adopted this script as well.

=== Modern Cyrillic alphabet ===
Below is the Kumyk Cyrillic alphabet, adopted in 1938, and remaining in use in its original composition up till today.

: Notes
# In native Kumyk words, as well as in Arabic and Persian loanwords, for words starting with vowel [e], the letter э is only used in word-initial position. In the middle of words, the letter е is used. If the letter е is used at the beginning of a word, it will have the sound [je].
# The letter ё:
#* if used at the beginning of a word, in which there are other front vowels, or either гor к, it will have a [jø] sound. In other cases, if in the beginning of a word, it will have a [jo] sound.
#* To represent the vowel [ø] at the beginning of the word, the digraph оь is used.
#* if used in the middle or end of a word, and following a front vowel, it will also make a [jø] sound, if following a back vowel, it will make a [jo] sound. 
#* if used in the middle of the word and following a consonant, it will have a [ø] sound.

# The letter ю:
#* if used at the beginning of a word, in which there are other front vowels, or either гor к, it will have a [jy] sound. In other cases, if in the beginning of a word, it will have a [ju] sound.
#* To represent the vowel [y] at the beginning of the word, the digraph уь is used.
#* if used in the middle or end of a word, and following a front vowel, it will also make a [jy] sound, if following a back vowel, it will make a [ju] sound.
#* if used in the middle of the word and following a consonant, it will have a [y] sound.

Over the decades, proposals to further improve the Cyrillic script have been raised. For example, it was proposed to have the digraphs гъ, гь, къ, нг, оь/ё, and уь/ю with single letters ғ, һ, қ, ң, ө, and ү respectively; it was also to introduce a letter ў to represent the sound and distinguish said sound with the sound both written with the letter в; and to introduce a letter җ to represent the sound and distinguish said sound with the sound both written with the letter ж. None of these policies were adopted in Kumyk orthography.
===Latin alphabet (1928–1938)===
Below table is the Latin alphabet for Kumyk, derived from Yañalif, and having an official status between 1928 and 1938.

===Latin alphabet project (1991)===

Below table is the Latin alphabet developed for Kumyk since 1991, derived from modern Turkish orthography and the Common Turkic alphabet.

===Arabic alphabet (1921–1928)===

Below table is the last standard iteration of the Perso-Arabic alphabet for Kumyk language, being compiled in 1921, and being the official alphabet until 1928:
: Notes
# The letter و has been used for representing a variety of vowel and consonant sounds in Kumyk. With the orthographic reforms in Kumyk, by 1921, 3 unique new letters had been created with the use of dots or diacritics, each representing a different vowel. An unmarked letter و continued to be used as well, representing either the vowel [u], or the consonants [v]/[w]. The correct pronunciation can be determined from context. If the letter و is before or after a vowel letter (as all vowels were to be written as per the 1921 orthographic conventions), then the letter would be a consonant. Otherwise it would&#x27;ve been a vowel.
# The letter ی has been used for representing a variety of vowel and consonant sounds in Kumyk. During the orthographic reforms in Kumyk, the letter ی was left unmarked in all cases. Thus, this single letter could represent either a consonant [j], or either the front or the back vowels [i] and [ɯ] respectively. 
#* If the letter ی is before or after a vowel letter (as all vowels were to be written as per the 1921 orthographic conventions), then the letter would be a consonant.
#* Otherswise, the vowel pronunciation of the letter ی can be determined by having an understanding of the vowel harmony and palatal harmony rules that exist in Kumyk as typical of languages of the Turkic family. If the letter ی is in a word with front vowels اە ـە ە [e], اۏ / ۏ [y], or اۊ / ۊ [ø], or with the two corresponding consonants ك [k] or گ, the letter ی will be a front vowel and pronounced as [i].
#* If the letter &quot;ی is in a word with back vowels آ / ـا [a], او / و [u], or اوٓ / وٓ‎‎ [o], or with the two corresponding consonants ق [ɢ~q] or غ [ʁ~ɣ], the letter ی&quot;&#x27; will be a back vowel and pronounced as [ɯ].

== Literature and media ==
Irchi Kazak (Ийрчы Къазакъ &quot;Yırçı Qazaq&quot;; born 1839) is usually considered to be the greatest poet of the Kumyk language. The first regular Kumyk newspapers and magazines appeared in 1917–18 under the editorship of Kumyk poet, writer, translator, and theatre figure Temirbolat Biybolatov (Temirbolat Biybolat). Currently, the newspaper Ёлдаш (&quot;Yoldash&quot;, &quot;Companion&quot;), the successor of the Soviet-era Ленин ёлу (&quot;Lenin yolu&quot;, &quot;Lenin&#x27;s Path&quot;), prints around 5,000 copies 3 times a week.

The Kumyk language was learned by Russian classical authors such as Leo Tolstoy and Mikhail Lermontov, both of whom served in the Caucasus. The language is present in such works of Tolstoy as &quot;The Raid&quot;, Cossacks, Hadji Murat, and Lermontov&#x27;s - &quot;A Hero of Our Time&quot;, Bestuzhev-Marlinsky&#x27;s - &quot;Molla-nur&quot; and &quot;Ammalat-bek&quot;.

<text>Kirchen (Sieg) is a town and Luftkurort (climatic spa) in the district of Altenkirchen in the north of Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It is situated on the river Sieg, approx. 12 km southwest of Siegen. Among its notable features is the Freusburg castle.

Kirchen is the seat of the Verbandsgemeinde Kirchen (Sieg) (Verbandsgemeinde, &quot;collective municipality).


==History==

In early 1942, Kirchen and Wehbach were forcibly united with the Nazi government and renamed Kirchen-Wehbach (Sieg). Despite protests from the people of Wehbach, this merger and renaming persisted even after the end of the war for two and a half decades, until additional former municipalities were annexed.
On 7 June 1969, the municipalities of Freusburg, Herkersdorf, Offhausen, Wingendorf, and Katzenbach, with the exception of the Unterbüdenholz district, which was incorporated into Brachbach, were amalgamated. On the same day, the municipality was renamed Kirchen (Sieg). Kirchen (Sieg) was granted town rights on 6 November 2004.

The interior is designed like Antilia, the residence of Isha Ambani before marriage.

<text>Endochondral ossification is one of the two essential pathways by which bone tissue is produced during fetal development of the mammalian skeletal system, the other pathway being intramembranous ossification. Both endochondral and intramembranous processes initiate from a precursor mesenchymal tissue, but their transformations into bone are different. In intramembranous ossification, mesenchymal tissue is directly converted into bone. On the other hand, endochondral ossification starts with mesenchymal tissue turning into an intermediate cartilage stage, which is eventually substituted by bone.

Endochondral ossification is responsible for development of most bones including long and short bones, the bones of the axial (ribs and vertebrae) and the appendicular skeleton (e.g. upper and lower limbs), the bones of the skull base (including the ethmoid and sphenoid bones) and the medial end of the clavicle. In addition, endochondral ossification is not exclusively confined to embryonic development; it also plays a crucial role in the healing of fractures.

==Formation of the cartilage model==
The initiation of endochondral ossification starts by proliferation and condensation of mesenchymal cells in the area where the bone will eventually be formed. Subsequently, these mesenchymal progenitor cells differentiate into chondroblasts, which actively synthesize cartilage matrix components. Thus, the initial hyaline cartilage template is formed, which has the same basic shape and outline as the future bone.

==Primary center of ossification==

In developing bones, ossification commences within the primary ossification center located in the center of the diaphysis (bone shaft), where the following changes occur:

==Secondary center of ossification==
During the postnatal life, a secondary ossification center appears in each end (epiphysis) of long bones. In these secondary centers, cartilage is converted to bone similarly to that occurring in a primary ossification center. As the secondary ossification centers enlarge, residual cartilage persists in two distinct locations:

At the end of an individual’s growth period, the production of new cartilage in the epiphyseal plate stops. After this point, existing cartilage within the plate turns into mature bone tissue.

==Histology==

During endochondral ossification, five distinct zones can be seen at the light-microscope level:

==Fracture healing==
For complete recovery of a fractured bone’s biomechanical functionality, the bone healing process needs to culminate in the formation of lamellar bone at the fracture site to withstand the same forces and stresses it did before the fracture. Indirect fracture healing, the most common type of bone repair, relies heavily on endochondral ossification. In this type of healing, endochondral ossification occurs within the fracture gap and external to the periosteum. In contrast, intramembranous ossification takes place directly beneath the periosteum, adjacent to the broken bone’s ends.

<doc id="1311174" wikidata="Q61933" url="?curid=1311174" title="Adolf Merckle">
<text>Adolf Merckle (18 March 1934 – 5 January 2009) was a German entrepreneur and billionaire. He died by suicide at age 74 due to losses during the financial crisis of 2007–2008. He was at one point the fifth-richest person in Germany with a net worth of $9.2 billion. 

==Early life==
Merckle was born in Dresden. In 1945, he fled with his family from Sudetenland, a region near the German-Czech border that was inhabited by ethnic Germans and occupied by Adolf Hitler&#x27;s forces in 1938. His family settled in Blaubeuren, a small town in southern Germany between Stuttgart and Ulm. He was educated as a lawyer.

==Career==
In 1967, he took over his family company, Merckle GmbH, with just 80 employees.

In 1973, he founded Germany&#x27;s first generic drug manufacturer, Ratiopharm.

For several decades he also held large stakes in cement company HeidelbergCement as well as vehicle manufacturer Kässbohrer.

At the end of 2008, Merckle’s investment company, VEM Vermögensverwaltung, faced a liquidity shortage. VEM said in a public statement that it had shored up the equity capital of HeidelbergCement to support the acquisition of British cement maker Hanson using loans backed by shares as collateral. Since the market value of the shares slumped more than 75% during the financial crisis of 2007–2008, banks demanded further securities and early redemption on their loans. Merckle made personal guarantees to the banks, also from his private assets. By negotiating with the banks he received a bridge loan to keep VEM afloat. In return he had to agree to sell Ratiopharm and his stake in HeidelbergCement to pay down debt.

Also in 2008, Merckle made a speculative investment based on his belief that Volkswagen shares would fall; however, in October 2008, Porsche SE&#x27;s support of Volkswagen led to a short squeeze that sent shares on the Xetra stock exchange from €210.85 to over €1,000 in less than two days. It is believed that he lost as much as €500 million.

==Suicide==
Merckle killed himself on 5 January 2009 near his villa in Blaubeuren by throwing himself under a speeding train.

==Personal life==
Merckle lived in Blaubeuren with his wife and four children, three sons and one daughter. His passions were mountain climbing and skiing.

<doc id="1311198" wikidata="Q6614912" url="?curid=1311198" title="List of cultural references in The Cantos">
<text>&lt;onlyinclude&gt;This is a list of persons, places, events, etc. that feature in Ezra Pound&#x27;s &quot;The Cantos&quot;, a long, incomplete poem in 120 sections, each of which is a canto.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt; It is a book-length work written between 1915 and 1962, widely considered to present formidable difficulties to the reader. Strong claims have been made for it as one of the most significant works of modernist poetry of the twentieth century. As in Pound&#x27;s prose writing, the themes of economics, governance and culture are integral to its content.

The most striking feature of the text, to a casual browser, is the inclusion of Chinese characters as well as quotations in European languages other than English. Recourse to scholarly commentaries is almost inevitable for a close reader. The range of allusion to historical events and other works of literature is very broad, and abrupt changes occur with the minimum of stage directions.

This list serves as a collection of links to information on a wide range of these references with clear indications of the cantos in which they appear. It also gives relevant citations to Pound&#x27;s other writings, especially his prose, and translations of non-English words and phrases where appropriate. Where authors are quoted or referred to, but not named, the reference is listed under their names and the quoted words or phrases are given after the relevant canto number. Individual canto numbers are given in bold for ease of reference.

*St. Anselm of Canterbury – 11th century philosopher and inventor of the ontological argument for the existence of God who wrote poems in rhymed prose. Appealed to Pound because of his emphasis on the role of reason in religion and his envisioning of the divine essence as light. In a 1962 interview, Pound points to Anselm&#x27;s clash with William Rufus over his investiture as part of the history of the struggle for individual rights. Pound also claims that Anselm&#x27;s writings influenced Cavalcanti and Villon. – Cantos CI, CV

In his 1928 essay, &quot;How to Read&quot;, Pound lists Cavalcanti among the &quot;inventors&quot;, or poets who were responsible for introducing something to the art that had never been done before. In an essay published in 1934 and written between 1911 and 1931, Pound wrote &quot;Guido is called a &#x27;natural philosopher&#x27;, I think an &#x27;atheist&#x27;, and certainly an &#x27;Epicurean&#x27;, not that anyone had then any clear idea or has now any very definite notion of what Epicurus taught. But a natural philosopher was a much less safe person than a &#x27;moral philosopher&#x27;. It is not so much what Guido says in [&quot;Donna mi pregha&quot;], as the familiarity that he shows with dangerous thinking; &quot;natural demonstration&quot; and the proof by experience or (?) experiment... we may perhaps consider Guido as one of that &#x27;tenuous line who from Albertus Magnus to the renaissance&#x27; meant the freedom of thought, the contempt, or at least a moderated respect, for stupid authority.&quot; – Cantos IV and XX: an allusion to and a quotations from the poem &quot;Una figura della Donna mia&quot;, which refers daringly to the resemblance between Cavalcanti&#x27;s beloved and the image of the Madonna in a Florentine church. – Canto XXXVI: a translation of &quot;Donna mi prega&quot;. – Canto LXXIII: a lengthy speech (in Italian) by Guido&#x27;s ghost. – Canto XCI: &quot;I send to Pinella ... a river&quot;, from the poem &quot;Ciascuna fresca e dolce fontanella&quot;.

Pound saw himself as a committed follower of the Chinese philosopher and translated the &quot;Analects&quot;, the &quot;Book of Odes&quot;, the &quot;Great Digest&quot; and the &quot;Unwobbling Pivot&quot;. Under the various version of his name, Confucius appears in &quot;The Cantos&quot; at least 76 times. The first and most comprehensive of these appearances is in Canto XIII – Also in Canto LI: Ideogram at end is Confucian &quot;rectification of names&quot;, Canto LII: &quot;Li Ki&quot;, Canto LIII: Cut 3,000 odes to 300.

She &quot;freed her slaves&quot; (Canto VI) in her will, a document which she dictated in Florence &quot;in the house of the Cavalcanti / anno 1265&quot; (Canto XXIX). Pound imagined that Guido Cavalcanti knew of this and mentioned it to his friend Dante who therefore pardoned her profligacy and placed her in the Heaven of Venus (&quot;Paradiso&quot; IX): &quot;The light of this star o’ercame me&quot; (Canto XXIX). This passage is cited in Italian in Canto XCII: &quot;fui chiamat’ / e qui refulgo&quot;. Canto XC associates her with John Randolph of Roanoke (&quot;liberavit masnatos&quot;).

*Arnaut Daniel – Troubadour poet. Pound translated most of his surviving work and agreed with Dante&#x27;s high estimation of him. In his 1910 book &quot;The Spirit of Romance&quot;, Pound wrote &quot;The Twelfth Century, or, more exactly, that century whose center is the year 1200, has left us two perfect gifts: the church of San Zeno in Verona, and the canzoni of Arnaut Daniel&quot; In his 1928 essay, &quot;How to Read&quot;, Pound lists Arnaut among the &quot;inventors&quot;, or poets who were responsible for introducing something to the art that had never been done before. – Canto VII: the line &quot;e qu&#x27;el remir [contra&#x27;l lum de la lampa]&quot; (&quot;and look at her [against the light of the lamp])&quot; from the poem &quot;Douz braitz e critz&quot; quoted.

*Dante Alighieri Italian poet whose &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, a long allegorical poem in three parts (Inferno, Purgatorio, Paradiso) and 100 cantos describing the poet&#x27;s journey through hell, purgatory and paradise was a major model for Pound&#x27;s long poem. In his 1928 essay, &quot;How to Read&quot;, Pound lists Dante among the &quot;inventors&quot;, or poets who were responsible for introducing something to the art that had never been done before. Cantos LXXXV – Canto XCIII: Discussed distributive justice.

<text>The Bloch MB.162 was a French four-engine, long-range bomber developed by Société des Avions Marcel Bloch in the late 1930s. Only a single prototype was built; after capture by German forces, it was pressed into service with the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; as a transport.

==Development==
Developed from the speedy MB.160 long-range civil transport, the MB.162 was originally developed as a mail plane. The MB.162 01 bomber prototype first flew in June 1940 and was captured subsequent to the Armistice. Had the MB.162 entered production in 1941 as planned, it would have been a notable and fast heavy bomber for the French, somewhat analogous to the B-17 but much faster and less well-armed.

==Operational history==
The MB.162 did not fly a single combat mission, nor did the MB.162 B.5 production model ever enter production. The prototype was used by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; in &quot;I/KG 200&quot; for clandestine affairs during 1943–1944.

==Variants==
MB.160:
:civil transport prototype with smaller span, longer, single central fin. Three built.
; MB.161: produced postwar as airliner SE.161 Languedoc. 100 built
; MB.162 Raid
:Long-range mailplane version
; MB.162.01
:prototype, one built
; MB.162 Bn.5
:Production model - never produced

<text>Legong: Dance of the Virgins is a 1935 synchronized drama travelogue sound film in color, one of the last feature films shot using the two-color Technicolor process, and one of the last films shot by a major Hollywood studio without any dialogue. While the film has no audible dialog, it was released with a synchronized musical score with sound effects. It is a drama based on a Balinese native tale, with travelogue elements depicting Balinese culture. &quot;Legong&quot; and the follow-up travelogue drama &quot;Kliou, the Killer&quot; (once believed lost) were the last mainstream silent films to be released in the US.

==Plot==
Poutou the daughter of Gousti Bagus is in love with Nyong. She attends a barong dance depicting a mythical struggle between a demon and men but is only interested in Nyong who is also there in the crowd of spectators. Nyong is invited to the home of Gousti Bagus and Poutou the next day. He is on his way when he sees Poutou&#x27;s sister Saplak bathing and is smitten. Nyong writes on a leaf for Saplak to meet him during the temple dance (Legong) Potou is to dance at. It is to be her last temple dance and Potou is very happy until she finds the note and learns of the betrayal. She goes to the bridge and sees the pair together and commits suicide. Gousti Bagus puts her body in a funeral pyre and burns it so she may be reincarnated.

==Cast==
The cast were entirely native Balinese who only acted in this film.

*Njong Njong Njoman as Nyong

==Production==

&quot;Legong&quot; was an American exploitation film (of a type often referred to as a &quot;goona-goona epic&quot;) similar to &quot;Isle of Paradise&quot; (1932), directed by Charles Trego, and &quot;Goona Goona&quot; or &quot;Love Powder&quot; (1932) directed by Andre Roosevelt and Armand Denis. &quot;Legong&quot; was produced and directed by Gaston Glass and Henry de la Falaise for Falaise&#x27;s wife Constance Bennett&#x27;s Bennett Pictures Corporation, and was filmed entirely on location in Bali from May to August 1933, using an all-Balinese cast. The crew was helped by Roosevelt, Denis, and Walter Spies to gain access to local villages and people willing to act in the film.

The cameraman was three-time Academy Award winner color specialist W. Howard Greene, billed as William H. Greene, who also photographed the two-color Technicolor scenes in &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1925), in addition to many other early Technicolor films. &quot;Legong&quot; was first distributed in the United States in 1935 by DuWorld Pictures Inc. and outside the U.S. by Paramount International. The score was compiled from stock cues from the Abe Meyer library, and was conducted by Samuel Wineland.

==Original release==

The film opened in New York City on October 1, 1935 at USD$5.00 per ticket ($84.20 in 2012 dollars). Reaction from some New York critics was positive; &quot;exquisitely beautiful&quot; from one, &quot;Moments that touch the heart&quot; from another, and &quot;flaming splendor&quot; from a third. The New York Times&#x27; reviewer found it &quot;a pleasant venture in the filmic literature of escape... a pretty tale, and the photoplay recites it simply and with faith. Subduing his color camera to inviting browns and pastel tints, the Marquis sets his native lovers against the rice fields, the shadowy lagoons, the pounding surf and the mountains of that island of which Paul Morand has written that it is absolutely irresistible to college boys and women of 40.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot;, on the other hand, considered it to offer &quot;nothing especially refreshing in the story... follows usual procedure for this type of native stuff&quot; though conceding &quot;A number of elaborate production scenes with oriental trappings are made doubly effective through use of color&quot;.

Ten weeks later &quot;Film Daily&quot; reported that &quot;Legong&quot; was still playing in New York. Part of the appeal was likely the bare-breasted young actresses that appear throughout the film: American censors of the time tended to be more lenient with toplessness in films purporting to be cultural studies, and the women were not white. &quot;Legong&quot; was successful enough that it was re-released several times. At one time advertisements promoted the film in large letters as &quot;NUDITY WITHOUT CRUDITY: A FILM FOR ALL AUDIENCES!&quot; &quot;Bali... a garden of Eden with dozens of ‘Eves’! See the strange dance of Rongda, the Witch! Romance in the South Seas! Mass Cremation ceremonies!&quot;

While nudity may have been part of the film&#x27;s appeal, it also received recognition at the time of its release for embodying &quot;many details of anthropological interest, giving a record, in particular, of betrothal custom, traditional dances and mortuary rites.&quot; This is only partially true. The script writers, while basing the story on Balinese culture, gave it a decidedly Hollywood treatment. Despite its shortcomings, the film gives an unparalleled view of life in Bali in the 1930s.

In the course of the story there are several authentic performances of Balinese dance. One of these dances is &quot;Legong&quot;, from which the film gets its name. While the film shows the traditional gamelan accompanying the dancers, there is no gamelan music in the original music track. This silent film has a musical soundtrack but no dialogue—rather it uses intertitles written by Hampton del Ruth.

The film was heavily edited in both the US and UK. In the US they removed a lot of the nudity while in the UK they removed the cockfighting scenes. The entire film has been found intact however.

==Restoration and new musical score==

The film was restored by the UCLA Film and Television Archive in 1999 and released on DVD in 2004. &quot;Legong&quot; was reconstructed using three surviving nitrate two-color Technicolor prints, one each from the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Scenes of nudity had been trimmed from the U.S. print, while shots of cockfighting had been removed from the British print. The DVD release includes an alternative soundtrack composed by Richard Marriott and I Made Subandi and performed by Gamelan Sekar Jaya and Club Foot Orchestra. The new score mixes Balinese and Western musical traditions. The score is quite unique in that it uses heavy violin ostinato with shouting over the top of it during scenes depicting crowds and cockfighting. This mixture of Balinese music with western instruments creates a unique sound. The score took roughly two months to compose though they had six months in advance to prepare. They borrowed heavily from native music such as &quot;barong&quot;, &quot;legong&quot;, &quot;garuda&quot; and &quot;bali langjar&quot;.

The new score was performed live at showings of the film at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco in May 1999, and at the UC Theater in Berkeley in 2000. There were also performances at the Winter Garden in the World Financial Center in New York City, as part of the Silent Film/Live Music festival in 2000 and 2005. In July 2013 the score was performed again at the Castro Theatre as part of the San Francisco Silent Film Festival.

In November 2004, a DVD of &quot;Legong&quot; was released with Bennett Pictures&#x27; follow-up film, &quot;Kliou, the Killer&quot; (1936), filmed in Indochina in color.

<text>Swami Ranganathananda (15 December 1908 – 25 April 2005) was a Hindu swami of the Ramakrishna Math order. He served as the 13th president of the Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission.

== Biography ==
Swami Ranganathananda, (pre-monastic name Shankaran Kutty), was born on 15 December 1908 in a village called Trikkur near Trichur, in Kerala to Neelakanta Sastry and Lakshmikutty Amma . As a teenager, he was attracted by the teachings of Swami Vivekananda and Ramakrishna and joined the Mysore centre of Ramakrishna Order as a Brahmachari in 1926. He served the Mysore Centre for 9 years and was under Swami Siddheswarananda and another 3 years under him in the Bangalore centre. He was initiated as a &quot;Sannyasi&quot; (monk) in 1933, on the 70th anniversary of Vivekananda&#x27;s birth by Shivananda, a direct disciple of Ramakrishna. Between 1939 and 1942, he served as the secretary and librarian at the Rangoon branch of Ramakrishna Mission. In 1942, during the Second World War, when Japan bombed Burma (Myanmar today) and the centre had to be wound up, Swami Ranganathananda came back to Dhaka preferring the land route trekking along with thousands of other refugees, although more comfortable alternatives were available.

He then served as the president of the Karachi centre of Math from 1942 to 1948 until the partition of India, after which the mission found it difficult to continue its activities at Karachi. At Karachi, L.K. Advani came in contact with him and listened to his discourses on the Bhagavad Gita. Advani said that Ranganathananda was a &quot;great influence&quot; during his formative years. According to Advani, at Karachi, Mohammed Ali Jinnah had once listened to Swami Ranganathananda&#x27;s lecture on Islam and Prophet Mohammed and remarked, &quot;Now I know how a true Muslim should be.&quot;

From 1949 to 1962, he served as a secretary at the Delhi centre. Then from 1962 to 1967, he served as the Secretary of the Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Kolkata, director of School of Humanistic &amp; Cultural studies, editor of mission&#x27;s monthly. The swami became president of the Hyderabad branch in 1973, where he developed the Vivekananda Vani School of Languages, a temple, and a library. He was elected to the post of vice-president of Ramakrishna Math and Mission in 1988. In 1998 he was elected as the president of the mission.

Swami Ranganathananda was chosen by the Indian government for Padma Vibhushan award in 2000. He declined the Padma Vibhushan as it was conferred on him in his individual capacity and not for the Mission. He accepted the Indira Gandhi Award for National Integration in 1987 and the Gandhi Peace Prize in February 1999 as both were conferred on the Ramakrishna Mission.

Since his residence in Bangalore in the 1930s, Swami Ranganathananda has been a popular teacher and lecturer on Indian spiritual culture. By the mid-1950s he was known within India as an authority on practical Vedanta. Since the 1960s he made nearly annual lecture tours to Western Europe, the United States, Australia, and Singapore. He also lectured in Iran and in the Soviet Union. Ranganathananda is noted for this contributions that bridges science and Vedantic spirituality.

Swami Ranganathananda was regarded a great scholar and teacher. He has authored over 50 books. The Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan has published around twenty-nine of these books. His famous book includes &quot;Eternal Values for a Changing Society&quot; and commentaries on the messages of the Bhagavad Gita and Upanishads. He was known as a good orator. His weekly classes and public lectures were popular among the followers. Ganapathy, a correspondent of The Hindu writes that &quot;In all his lectures, Swami Ranganathananda had stressed on the philosophy of eternal religion, a practical Vedanta, which teaches universal acceptance&quot;. He conducted moral and religious classes for the prisoners in the Bangalore and Mysore jails. In Delhi, Ranganathananda organised social services at hospitals and worked for the relief of leprosy patients. Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh described Swamis Ranganathananda and Vivekananda as &quot;leaders with a modern mind and scientific temper.&quot;

Swami Ranganathananda lived the last days of his life in the headquarters of the Ramakrishna Mission at Belur in West Bengal. He died at the Woodlands Medical Centre, Kolkata, at 3:51 p.m. on Monday, 25 April 2005, owing to cardiac arrest. He was 96. His body was kept for darshan at Belur Math (near Kolkata) on that day, then was cremated the next day. India Post released a postage stamp in the denomination of Rs 5 to commemorate the 100th birth anniversary of Swami Ranganathananda, during December 2008 at Kolkata.

His life and work has been documented in many biographies, including the one in Malayalam by D. Vijayamohan.

==Quotations==
* &quot;Are you growing spiritually? Can you love others? Can you feel oneness with others? Have you peace within yourself? and do you radiate it around you? That is called spiritual growth, which is stimulated by meditation inwardly, and by work done in a spirit of service outwardly.&quot;
* &quot;I am not alone in the world. . .We belong to a world. . .The vast world is around us. We cannot do without it. We cannot become human without a human world around us. How much we owe to the world of other human beings around us!&quot;
* &quot;Efficiency and energy comes from emotion, not from intellectual knowledge, which can only direct that emotional energy. But the real impulse comes from emotion. It makes you work at your best.&quot;
* &quot;So, work hard; perform all duties; develop yourself; then come and surrender to the highest. Do a whole day&#x27;s honest work, then sit and meditate; then resign yourself to God. Otherwise, that meditation has no meaning or value. Meditation at the end of a lazy day has no meaning; but the same at the end of an active day, filled with good deeds, has meaning, and is rewarding.&quot;
* &quot;How can we find joy in work? By working for oneself? No; it is not possible to find that continuous joy in work through selfish motivations. Frustration and ennui are the end of all selfish motivations. Frustrations and nervous breakdowns are the end of a self-centred life. The first advice of modern psychiatry to such people is to get out of this prison of self-centredness, and to find a genuine interest in other people. Everyone has to learn the lesson some day that, the best way to be happy is to strive to make others happy. So wherever you find frustration, you will always discover that the person concerned had been too self-centred, and the only hope for him is through learning to take interest in other people, to find joy in the joy of other people. This is the royal path that makes for health, for strength, for efficiency. This great truth—universal and human—we should apply to the world and to our life in it.&quot;
* The great new mantra today is &quot;Work&quot; and &#x27;Hard Work&#x27;; along with Hard Work, intelligent work co-operative teamwork. All great undertakings are product of teamwork. We can meet the challenge of freedom only when we have learnt this character-efficiency involved in teamwork, and intelligent hard work. This is the philosophy which we have to learn consciously, not unconsciously, somehow stumbling into it.
* Work from ego point of view is all tension. But behind ego, there is an infinite spiritual dimension. When that is realised even a little, then extra work won&#x27;t make one feel that it is heavy. Even ordinary experiences will tell you: Whenever there is love in the heart, the worker doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. When there is no love in the heart, even a little work makes one feel very heavy. As soon as you have love for a particular cause, you can do anything; do hard work, but have a spirit of detachment based on a larger love.
* Work is no work at all. It is a question of agency and attachment. When these two are not there, work ceases to be work, it becomes a play, it becomes spontaneous, and it becomes natural. When you become thoroughly detached, then all that tension goes away. You are working, but you don&#x27;t feel that you are working. What a beautiful idea!&quot;
* Work is drudgery; Sri Krishna will not allow that attitude. There is joy in work also. Do not abandon work; go on doing work; but, mentally renouncing all actions. It is a wonderful state of mind-working, and yet not working.
* Those who work, work with a zest and with joy and in work, learn calmness and the serenity of the human mind and heart; what a wonderful joy it is to work in such a way!
* When science insists on studying things from the point of view of the objects themselves by eliminating the personal equation, it is in effect, emphasising the &quot;sakshi-bhava&quot; or &quot;sakshi&quot; point of view (witness attitude); for, the limited and circumscribed vision of the ego gives place to the unlimited and universal vision of the &quot;sakshi&quot;, by the practice of scientific or intellectual detachment.
* The endeavours and conclusions of the sense-bound intellect can not be the last word in man’s search for truth. An intellectual approach to truth will end only in agnosticism; and often in cynicism. But the whole being of man seeks to experience truth, to realise it. … This rising above rationalism to direct experience and realisation, this growth of man from the sensate to the super-sensual dimension, is the special message of Indian spiritual tradition.
* Mysticism, studied seriously, challenges basic tenets of Western Cultures: a) the primacy of reason and intellect; b) the separate, individual nature of man; c) the linear organisation of time. Great mystics, like our own great scientists, envision the world as being larger than those tenets, as transcending our traditional views.

<text>Bridgett Riley (born May 13, 1973) is a female boxer and motion picture stuntwoman from Oakville, Missouri, where she graduated in 1989. While working as an airline attendant, she decided to learn martial arts. The interest in the sport came from her brother Patrick&#x27;s strong interest in mixed martial arts. She trained with her brother and a number of other high-profile martial artists early in her career. Notably, she was trained by former three time world kickboxing champion, Jim Boucher (Belleville, Illinois). She was a member of a competition team with other competitors such as: Ronnie &quot;Diamond&quot; Deleon (World Kickboxing Champion), Patrick Riley (mixed martial arts champion), Donny Reinhardt (world champion), Russ Hogue (US Kickboxing Champion).

She held the International Female Boxers Association`s world Bantamweight championship for a short period of time. Her nickname is &quot;Baby Doll&quot; and she was managed by Don King for several years.

A lifelong fan of combat sports, Riley began to pave her way into relative women&#x27;s boxing stardom during the early 1990s, when she fought as a kick boxer, winning various titles and becoming famous around kick boxing circles. Riley headlined many kick boxing shows in Las Vegas, and her fights were frequently televised on regional sports networks, such as ASPN.

When Riley announced that she was to begin a career in professional boxing, many of her fans received the news with open arms. Riley debuted as a professional boxer on April 8, 1994, when she beat future world champion Yvonne Trevino by a four round decision in Laughlin, Nevada.

Riley then took off two years from boxing, but she kept busy by fighting kick boxing fights. In 1996, the year which many consider the beginning of the &quot;golden era&quot; of women&#x27;s boxing, Riley made her comeback to boxing.

On June 16, she beat Del Pettis in Long Beach. Riley suffered her first career loss on May 17, 1997, against Theresa Arnold, due to a cut sustained over her left eye in the sixth round.

Riley won her next two fights, and, on February 15, 1998, she and Trevino were rematched for Trevino&#x27;s IFBA world Bantamweight championship, in Biloxi, Mississippi. Riley became a world champion by defeating Trevino by a ten round unanimous decision.

On June 26 of that year, she made what would be her only defense of the title, knocking out Aicha Lahsen in nine rounds at Las Vegas. Riley was knocked down by Lahsen in the first round and barely beat the count and made it through the end of the round. She recovered in later rounds and finished the fight with the knock out of Lahsen. This fight was chosen as women&#x27;s boxing fight of the year for 1998.

She then won three more fights in a row, for a total of eight consecutive wins. However, none of these fights were for a world title. Among the women she defeated during that span were Brenda Burnside, by an eight round split decision at the Madison Square Garden in New York, New York, and Del Pettis, knocked out in the first round of their rematch, which also happened to be Riley&#x27;s first bout of the 2000s.

On December 7, 2001, her winning streak was stopped when her bout with Yolanda Gonzalez, also held in California, was declared a technical draw (tie), because of a headbutt that caused an injury on Riley&#x27;s head.

Riley then beat Linda Edwards and Karen Richardson, both by first round knockouts, before facing Para Draine, on November 14, 2002, in Portland, Oregon. Draine outpointed Riley over six rounds.

On January 18, 2003, Riley defeated Angie Bordelon by a six round decision in Raleigh, North Carolina. On June 4 of that year, she knocked out Nicole Gallegos in three rounds, in what has been, to date, her last professional boxing fight.

Riley has a record of 15 wins, 3 losses and 1 draw, with 7 wins by knockout.

She was inducted into the International Women&#x27;s Boxing Hall of Fame in 2019.

==Film career==
During several of her layoffs, Riley has had several acting roles. She appeared in the mid 1990s television series WMAC Masters (broadcast on Fox). She appeared in the early 1990s martial arts inspired &quot;Triple Impact&quot;. She appeared as a boxer in &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot;.

In addition to her own acting, she has performed as the stunt double for other actresses. She began her stunt work career as the double for the Yellow Ranger in early &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; episodes and &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie&quot;. She doubled for Halle Berry in &quot;Catwoman&quot;, Malin Akerman in &quot;Watchmen&quot;, Summer Glau in &quot;Serenity&quot;, was a stunt in &quot;Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones&quot; and others.

<text>Ashanti Omowali Alston (born 1954) is an anarchist activist, speaker, and writer, and former member of the Black Panther Party and Black Liberation Army. From 1974-1985 he spent time in prison for bank robbery which caused him to become further engaged in politics. He is currently on the Steering Committee of the Jericho Movement to free U.S. political prisoners. Alston resides in Providence, Rhode Island.

==Early life==
Alston grew up in the inner city of Plainfield, New Jersey, which he described as being, at that time, &quot;Niggertown with all the customs and traditions of racism, sexism and powerlessness&quot;. Alston was 11 years old during the assassination of Malcolm X and 13 years old during the 1967 Newark riots, events that both took place near his hometown of Plainfield. In a 2010 interview, Alston said that he did not remember Malcolm X&#x27;s death in 1965, but he began to understand the significance of Malcolm&#x27;s legacy as rebellions occurred throughout the United States in 1967. Alston described seeing his older brother&#x27;s copy of Malcolm X&#x27;s autobiography with the subtitle &quot;Former pimp, hustler, robber, who becomes leader of the Black Revolution&quot;, which demonstrated to him that &quot;people that come from that kind of background can play a heroic role in the struggle.&quot; He recalled that witnessing the 1967 Plainfield rebellion gave him &quot;an image of black men and women in heroic roles in our community crashing all the myths about us being &#x27;niggers&#x27;, all that stuff.&quot;

Malcolm X&#x27;s assassination and the Newark riots influenced Alston&#x27;s decision to join the Black Panther Party at age 17, as he believed that the Panthers were &quot;taking Malcolm&#x27;s teachings to the next level&quot;. At this time, Alston attended Nation of Islam meetings despite not being a member. He felt a strong disdain for white people, as preached by the Nation of Islam; however, upon joining the Panthers he changed his views.

==Black Panther Party, Black Liberation Army, and prison==
In 1971, in the face of the Panther 21 trial which saw several of his peers possibly facing the death penalty, Alston joined the Black Liberation Army, a spin-off group from the Panthers that advocated for and attempted armed struggle against the United States government. In 1974, he was arrested and imprisoned for 11 years for taking part in a robbery designed to raise funds for the BLA. Alston credits his time in prison with helping him to learn about political movements, economic theories, political organizations, religion, and guerrilla theories. During this time he became an anarchist, in contrast to the Marxism-Leninism and Maoism explored by the Black Panther Party. While imprisoned, Alston also became disillusioned with the BLA, particularly due to its endorsement of drugs, as he understood the intention of the BLA to be the liberation of Black communities from the tyranny and influence of drugs at the time.

Alston observed much sexism during his time in the Black Panther Party, despite the group&#x27;s stated intention of gender equality, which he didn&#x27;t fully realize until his stint in prison. However, he has acknowledged that some women still felt empowered by the Black Panther Party to fight sexism despite experiencing it within the party, recalling, &quot;Sisters would tell you that because everybody had guns there were certain ways that they could tell a brother, &#x27;you&#x27;re not going to fuck with me, I&#x27;m not going to be your sexual object because I got a gun&#x27;.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1984, Alston married fellow BPP and BLA member Safiya Bukhari. She died in 2003. Alston married Professor Viviane Saleh-Hanna in 2006. They have 2 children together.

<text>The Norwegian Polar Institute (NPI; ) is Norway&#x27;s central governmental institution for scientific research, mapping and environmental monitoring in the Arctic and the Antarctic. The NPI is a directorate under Norway&#x27;s Ministry of Climate and Environment. The institute advises Norwegian authorities on matters concerning polar environmental management and is the official environmental management body for Norwegian activities in Antarctica.

== Activities ==
The institute&#x27;s activities are focused on environmental research and management in the polar regions. The NPI&#x27;s researchers investigate biodiversity, climate and environmental toxins in the Arctic and Antarctic, and in this context the institute equips and organizes large-scale expeditions to both polar regions. The institute contributes to national and international climate work, and is an active contact point for the international scientific community. The institute collects and analyses data on the environment and cultural heritage sites on the islands of Svalbard and Jan Mayen through the project Environmental Monitoring of Svalbard and Jan Mayen (MOSJ). Topographic mapping is also an important task: the NPI is the national surveying and mapping authority for Norway&#x27;s polar areas, including non-commercial geological surveys.

In Antarctica, the institute is responsible for the management of all Norwegian activities. This means that all Norwegian subjects planning activities in Antarctica must first contact the NPI.

The NPI maintains a database of reported sightings of whales, walruses, seals, and polar bears in the Svalbard area to which the public is encouraged to contribute. The reported sightings are used in research and monitoring.

The NPI is the official agency responsible for place names in the Norwegian polar regions. These areas include Svalbard and Jan Mayen and their adjacent waters, Queen Maud Land, Bouvet Island, and Peter I Island. Place names are officially adopted by the responsible committee at the NPI, which maintains a database of place names that is publicly searchable.

== History ==
The NPI was established in 1948 under the Norwegian Ministry of Industry, but must be seen as an extension of Norwegian Svalbard and Arctic Ocean Survey, &quot;Norges Svalbard og Ishavsundersøkelser (NSIU)&quot;, which was founded on 1 March 1928. Previously, Norway&#x27;s Svalbard research had been organized as the Norwegian state-supported Spitsbergen Expeditions, with roots dating back to 1906. With the establishment of the NSIU, Norwegian research activity in eastern Greenland increased.
With Harald Sverdrup as the first director, the NPI&#x27;s mandate included Antarctica and was considerably broader than that of its forerunner, the NSIU. From 1949 to 1952, the NPI led the multinational Maudheim Expedition to Antarctica and had a base in Queen Maud Land from 1956 to 1960 (Norway Station), during the International Geophysical Year, also known as the third International Polar Year. The NPI established the permanent research station Troll in Antarctica in 1989–90; Troll has been operated as a year-round research station since 2005. The NPI carried out annual summer expeditions to Svalbard and, starting in 1968, has had a year-round research station in Ny-Ålesund. In 1979, the NPI became was a directorate under the Ministry of the Environment (currently the Ministry of Climate and Environment).

In 1993, the decision was made in the Norwegian Parliament to move the headquarters of the NPI from Oslo, Norway&#x27;s capital, to Tromsø, a coastal city north of the Arctic Circle. The process was completed in 1998. This relocation led to changes in the institute&#x27;s profile and areas of interest as departments were reorganized, new personnel recruited, new positions established and research priorities shifted.

== Research platforms ==

The NPI runs the Sverdrup Station and the Zeppelin Observatory in Svalbard, the Troll and Tor research stations in Antarctica, and Norvegia Station on Bouvet Island.

The NPI owns the research vessel RV &quot;Kronprins Haakon&quot;, with the University of Tromsø and the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research being the other users of the vessel.

== Archives ==
The NPI has built up a sizeable polar history collection in the form of photographs, books, journals and other archival materials.

The Library contains unique collections of polar history literature, including more than 15,000 books as well as diaries, ship registers and logbooks, newspaper cuttings and special collections, for example, a special collection pertaining to Umberto Nobile.

The Photo Library contains pictures from polar expeditions, mapping in Svalbard, Greenland and Antarctica, research (including geology, glaciology, biology and oceanography) and commercial activities such as mining in Svalbard, seal hunting in the White Sea, whaling in the Southern Ocean and trapping in Greenland and Svalbard. The collection consists of about 90,000 photographs, including some 60,000 historical photographs. The rest are modern images documenting research activity in Svalbard and Antarctica and adjacent marine areas. A large part of the collection is accessible to the public via the NPI&#x27;s online image archive.

<doc id="1311264" wikidata="Q5095935" url="?curid=1311264" title="Chicano English">
<text>Chicano English, or Mexican-American English, is a dialect of American English spoken primarily by Mexican Americans (sometimes known as Chicanos), particularly in the Southwestern United States ranging from Texas to California, as well as in Chicago. Chicano English is sometimes mistakenly conflated with Spanglish, which is a mixing of Spanish and English; however, Chicano English is a fully formed and native dialect of English, not a &quot;learner English&quot; or interlanguage. It is even the native dialect of some speakers who know little to no Spanish, or have no Mexican heritage.

== Naming issues ==
Many people who speak Chicano English do not themselves identify with the term &quot;Chicano.&quot; For example, none of &#x27;s eight Hispanic participants identified with the term. Despite this, Chicano English remains the most widely used and recognized term for this language variety. Some studies on Chicano English have used terms such as &quot;Mexican-American English&quot;, &quot;Latino English&quot;, and &quot;Mexican Heritage English&quot;.

==History==
Communities of Spanish-speaking Tejanos, Nuevomexicanos, Californios, and Mission Indians have existed in the American Southwest since the area was part of New Spain&#x27;s &quot;Provincias Internas&quot;. Most of the historically Hispanophone populations eventually adopted English as their first language, as part of their overall Americanization.

A high level of Mexican immigration began in the 20th century, with the exodus of refugees from the Mexican Revolution (1910) and the linkage of Mexican railroads to the US (Santa Ana, 1991). The Hispanic population is one of the largest and fastest-growing ethnic groups in the United States. In the Los Angeles metropolitan area alone, they form 45% of the population (roughly 6 million out of 13.3 million in 2014). The result of the migration and the segregated social conditions of the immigrants in California made an ethnic community that is only partly assimilated to the matrix &quot;Anglo&quot; (European American) community. It retains symbolic links with Hispanic culture (as well as real links from continuing immigration), but linguistically, it is mostly an English-speaking, not a Spanish-speaking, community. However, its members have a distinctive accent.

The phonological inventory of Chicano English speakers appears to be identical to that of the local Anglo community. For example, long and short vowels are clearly distinguished, as is the English vowel . Speculatively, it seems that the main differences between the Chicano accent and the local Anglo accent are that the Chicanos are not always participating in ongoing phonetic changes in Anglo communities, such as the raising of that characterizes Anglo Inland Northern speakers but not necessarily Hispanic ones.

Because Spanish-speaking people migrated from other parts of the Hispanophone world to the Southwest, Chicano English is now the customary dialect of many Hispanic Americans of diverse national heritages in the Southwest. As Hispanics are of diverse racial origins, Chicano English serves as the distinction from non-Hispanic and non-Latino Americans in the Southwest.

A common stereotype about Chicano English speakers, similar to stereotypes about other racial/ethnic minorities in the United States, is that Chicano English speakers are not proficient in English and are generally uneducated. This language ideology is linked to negative perceptions about Chicano Americans and Hispanics in general.

==Phonology==
===Prosody===
The rhythm of Chicano English tends to have an intermediate prosody between a Spanish-like syllable timing, with syllables taking up roughly the same amount of time with roughly the same amount of stress, and General American English&#x27;s stress timing, with only stressed syllables being evenly timed. 

Chicano English also has a complex set of nonstandard English intonation patterns, such as pitch rises on significant words in the middle and at the end of sentences as well as initial-sentence high pitches, which are often accompanied by the lengthening of the affected syllables. When needing extra emphasis to certain words, there is the use of rising glides. Rising glides can be used multiple times in one sentence. On compound nouns and verbs, major stress is on the second word. Rising glides can occur at any time and at either monosyllabic or polysyllabic words.

===Consonants===
Certain Chicano English consonant pronunciations are similar to African-American Vernacular English. 
*Chicano English often exhibits th-stopping. That is, /ð/ sounds may be replaced with /d/ sounds, as in &quot;dese&quot; and &quot;dem&quot; instead of &quot;these&quot; and &quot;them&quot;. 
*t/d deletion occurs at the end of a word when those consonants are part of a consonant cluster. For example, &quot;missed&quot; becomes &quot;miss&quot;.
* can undergo devoicing in all environments: for &quot;easy&quot; and for &quot;was&quot;.
Certain consonants show Spanish-language influence:
*Chicano speakers may realize bilabially, as a stop or a fricative/approximant , with &quot;very&quot; being pronounced or .
* is never velarized and so it is pronounced similarly to Spanish , which also lacks velarization, in all positions.

===Vowels===
Mexican-Americans show variable participation in local sound shifts, like the Northern Cities Shift of the Great Lakes or the California Shift in the American West.

Reduction of unstressed vowels is less common in Chicano English than in Anglo varieties.

While a lack of pre-nasal /æ/ raising is often characteristic of Chicano English, in El Paso, /æ/ raising is found among both Anglos and Hispanics. 

The cot–caught merger is complete, approximately to . For younger speakers, however, the vowel is retracted to by the Californian Vowel Shift.

The salary–celery merger occurs, with and merging before . This is found in Los Angeles, northern New Mexico and Albuquerque, and in El Paso.

 is pronounced as , making &quot;showing&quot; sound like &quot;show-een&quot;. This feature has since spread to other varieties of California English.

The distinction between and before liquid consonants is often reduced in some Chicano accents, making &quot;fill&quot; and &quot;feel&quot; homophones. That is also a feature of general California English.

 is slightly fronted, as in most American and many British dialects, but less fronted than in mainstream California English.

Some realizations of , , , and other long vowels are monophthongal. That may be an effect of Spanish, but other American English dialects (Minnesota, for example) also can show monophthongization of such vowels, which are more commonly diphthongs in English. Also, such vowels are underlyingly long monophthongs so the general effect thus is to simplify the system of phonetic implementation, compared to the of many other English dialects.

==Variation==
A fair to strong degree of variation exists in the phonology of Chicano English. Its precise boundaries are difficult to delineate, perhaps because of its separate origins of the dialect in the Southwest and the Midwest.

One subvariety, referenced as Tejano English, is used mainly in southern Texas. California subvarieties are also widely studied, especially that of the Los Angeles metropolitan area, such as East Los Angeles Chicano English, which includes elements of African American Vernacular English and California English.

===New Mexico===
One type of Hispanic English, a sub-type under Chicano English of the American West, is specific to north-central New Mexico. A recent study found that native English–Spanish bilinguals in New Mexico have a lower/shorter/weaker voice-onset time than that typical of native monolingual English speakers. Northern New Mexico Hispanic English, transcending age, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status, has been reported as having its own vowel shift as follows: is before a final (so &quot;feel&quot; merges to the sound of &quot;fill&quot;), is before any consonant (so &quot;suit&quot; merges to the sound of &quot;soot&quot;), is before a final (so &quot;shell&quot; merges to the sound of &quot;shall&quot;), and is before any consonant (so &quot;cup&quot; merges to the sound of something like &quot;cop&quot;).
That said, a later study examining the speech of college students in Albuquerque failed to find evidence of being laxed to or of becoming lowered to .

===East Los Angeles===
This form of Chicano English is predominantly spoken in East Los Angeles and has been influenced by the California English of coastal European-Americans and African-American Vernacular English.

==Notable native speakers==

*Gloria Anzaldúa — &quot;I spoke English like a Mexican. At Pan American University, I and all Chicano students were required to take two speech classes. Their purpose: to get rid of our accents.&quot;
*César Chávez — &quot;His speech was soft, sweetened by a Spanish accent&quot;
*George Lopez — &quot;Chicanos are their own breed. Even though we&#x27;re born in the United States, we still have accents.&quot;
*Cheech Marin — &quot;a hint of a Chicano accent&quot; — &quot;a Spanish accent or stereotypical East Los Angeles cadence like Cheech Marin&quot;
*Selena — “Her speech, now, shows some influence from Spanish”

<text>Fables and Parables (&quot;Bajki i przypowieści&quot;, 1779), by Ignacy Krasicki (1735–1801), is a work in a long international tradition of fable-writing that reaches back to antiquity. 

Krasicki&#x27;s fables and parables have been described as being, &quot;[l]ike Jean de La Fontaine&#x27;s [fables]... amongst the best ever written, while in colour they are distinctly original, because Polish.&quot; 

They are, according to Czesław Miłosz, &quot;the most durable among Krasicki&#x27;s poems.&quot;

==Characteristics==
Emulating the fables of the ancient Greek Aesop, the Macedonian-Roman Phaedrus, the Polish Biernat of Lublin, and the Frenchman Jean de La Fontaine, and anticipating Russia&#x27;s Ivan Krylov, Poland&#x27;s Krasicki populates his fables with anthropomorphized animals, plants, inanimate objects, and forces of nature, in epigrammatic expressions of a skeptical, ironic view of the world.

That view is informed by Krasicki&#x27;s observations of human nature and of national and international politics in his day—including the predicament of the expiring Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Just seven years earlier (1772), the Commonwealth had experienced the first of three partitions that would, by 1795, totally expunge the Commonwealth from the political map of Europe.

The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth would fall victim to the aggression of three powerful neighbors much as, in Krasicki&#x27;s fable of &quot;The Lamb and the Wolves,&quot; the lamb falls prey to the two wolves. The First Partition had rendered Krasicki—an intimate of Poland&#x27;s last king, Stanisław August Poniatowski—involuntarily a subject of that Partition&#x27;s instigator, Prussia&#x27;s King Frederick II (&quot;the Great&quot;). Krasicki would, unlike Frederick, survive to witness the final dismemberment of the Commonwealth.

Krasicki&#x27;s parables (e.g., &quot;Abuzei and Tair,&quot; &quot;The Blind Man and the Lame,&quot; &quot;Son and Father,&quot; &quot;The Farmer,&quot; &quot;,&quot; &quot;The Master and His Dog,&quot; &quot;,&quot; and &quot;The Drunkard&quot;) do not, by definition, employ the anthropomorphization that characterizes the &quot;fables&quot;. Instead, his parables point elegant moral lessons drawn from more quotidian &quot;human&quot; life.

Krasicki&#x27;s, writes Czesław Miłosz, &quot;is a world where the strong win and the weak lose in a sort of immutable order... Reason is exalted as the human equivalent of animal strength: the [clever] survive, the stupid perish.&quot;

Miłosz writes:

The &quot;Fables and Parables&quot; are written as 13-syllable lines, in couplets with the rhyme scheme AA BB. They range in length from 2 to 18 lines. The introductory invocation &quot;To the Children&quot;, while employing the same rhyme scheme, uses lines of 11 syllables.

Curiously, the fables include two with the identical title, &quot;The Stream and the River&quot;; two with the identical title, &quot;The Lion and the Beasts&quot;; two with the identical title, &quot;Nightingale and Goldfinch&quot;; and two with the identical title, &quot;The Wolf and the Sheep&quot;.

Critics generally prefer Krasicki&#x27;s more concise &quot;Fables and Parables&quot; (1779), sampled here, over his later &quot;New Fables&quot;, published posthumously in 1802. This is consistent with Krasicki&#x27;s own dictum in &quot;On Versification and Versifiers&quot; that &quot;A fable should be &quot;brief&quot;, clear and, so far as possible, preserve the truth.&quot;

In the same treatise, Krasicki explains that a fable &quot;is a story commonly ascribed to animals, that people who read it might take instruction from [the animals&#x27;] example or speech...; it originated in eastern lands where supreme governance reposed in the hands of autocrats. Thus, when it was feared to proclaim the truth openly, simulacra were employed in fables so that—if only in this way—the truth might be agreeable alike to the ruled and to the rulers.&quot;

==Samples==
Below are 17 samples from Krasicki&#x27;s &quot;Fables and Parables&quot; (1779), in English translation by Christopher Kasparek. An additional 45 items may be found at Wikisource; the total of 62 items presented there constitute 52% of the 119 in Krasicki&#x27;s original &quot;Fables and Parables&quot;.

=== Abuzei and Tair ===
&quot;Congratulate me, father,&quot; said Tair, &quot;I prosper.&lt;br&gt;
Tomorrow I am to become the Sultan&#x27;s brother-&lt;br&gt;
In-law and hunt with him.&quot; Quoth father: &quot;All does alter,&lt;br&gt;
Your lord&#x27;s good graces, women&#x27;s favor, autumn weather.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
He had guessed aright, the son&#x27;s plans did not turn out well:&lt;br&gt;
The Sultan withheld his sister, all day the rain fell.

=== The Blind Man and the Lame ===

A blind man was carrying a lame man on his back,&lt;br&gt;
And everything was going well, everything&#x27;s on track,&lt;br&gt;
When the blind man decides to take it into his head&lt;br&gt;
That he needn&#x27;t listen to all that the lame man said.&lt;br&gt;
&quot;This stick I have will guide the two of us safe,&quot; said he,&lt;br&gt;
And though warned by the lame man, he plowed into a tree. &lt;br&gt;
On they proceeded; the lame man now warned of a brook;&lt;br&gt;
The two survived, but their possessions a soaking took.&lt;br&gt;
At last the blind man ignored the warning of a drop,&lt;br&gt;
And that was to turn out their final and fatal stop.&lt;br&gt;
:Which of the two travelers, you may ask, was to blame?
Why, &#x27;twas both the heedless blind man and the trusting lame.

=== The Eagle and the Hawk ===
Eagle, not wishing to incommode himself with chase,&lt;br&gt;
Decided to send hawk after sparrows in his place.&lt;br&gt;
Hawk brought him the sparrows, eagle ate them with pleasure;&lt;br&gt;
At last, not quite sated with the dainties to measure,&lt;br&gt;
Feeling his appetite growing keener and keener —&lt;br&gt;
Eagle ate fowl for breakfast, the fowler for dinner.

===Son and Father===
Every age has its bitter, every age has its grief:&lt;br&gt;
Son toiled o&#x27;er his book, father was vexed beyond belief.&lt;br&gt;
The one had no rest; the other no freedom, forsooth:&lt;br&gt;
Father lamented his age, son lamented his youth.

=== Birds in a Cage ===
&quot;Why do you weep?&quot; inquired the young of the old,&lt;BR&gt;
&quot;You&#x27;re more comfortable in this than out in the cold.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;
&quot;You were born caged,&quot; said the elder, &quot;this was your morrow;&lt;BR&gt;
&quot;I was free, now I&#x27;m caged—hence the cause of my sorrow.&quot;

=== The Little Fish and the Pike ===
Espying a worm in the water, the little fish&lt;br&gt;
Did greatly regret the worm could not become his dish.&lt;br&gt;
Up came a pike and made his preparations to dine;&lt;br&gt;
He swallowed both worm and hook, which he failed to divine.&lt;br&gt;
As the angler pulled ashore his magnificent prize,&lt;br&gt;
Quoth the little fish: &quot;Sometimes good to be undersize.&quot;

=== The Farmer ===
A farmer, bent on doubling the profits from his land,&lt;br&gt;
Proceeded to set his soil a two-harvest demand.&lt;br&gt;
Too intent thus on profit, harm himself he must needs:&lt;br&gt;
Instead of corn, he now reaps corn cockle and weeds.

=== Two Dogs ===
&quot;Why do I freeze out of doors while you sleep on a rug?&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Inquired the bobtail mongrel of the fat, sleek pug.&lt;br&gt;
&quot;I have run of the house, and you the run of a chain,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
The pug replied, &quot;because you serve, while I entertain.&quot;

===The Master and His Dog===
The dog barked all the night, keeping the burglar away;&lt;br&gt;
It got a beating for waking the master, next day.&lt;br&gt;
That night it slept soundly and did the burglar no harm;&lt;br&gt;
He burgled; the dog got caned for not raising alarm.

===The Humble Lion===
&#x27;Tis bad at master&#x27;s court to lie, bad the truth to tell.&lt;br&gt;
Lion, intent on showing all that he was humble,&lt;br&gt;
Called for open reproaches. Said the fox: &quot;Your great vice&lt;br&gt;
Is that you&#x27;re too kind, too gracious, excessively nice.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
The sheep, seeing lion pleased by fox&#x27;s rebuke, said:&lt;br&gt;
&quot;You are a cruel, voracious tyrant.&quot; — and she was dead.

=== The Lamb and the Wolves ===

Aggression ever finds cause if sufficiently pressed.&lt;br&gt;
Two wolves on the prowl had trapped a lamb in the forest&lt;br&gt;
And were about to pounce. Quoth the lamb: &quot;What right have you?&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;You&#x27;re toothsome, weak, in the wood.&quot; — The wolves dined sans ado.

===Man and Wolf===
Man was traveling in wolfskin when wolf stopped his way.&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Know from my garb,&quot; said the man, &quot;what I am, what I may.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
The wolf first laughed out loud, then grimly said to the man:&lt;br&gt;
&quot;I know that you are weak, if you need another&#x27;s skin.&quot;

===Compassion===
The sheep was praising the wolf for all his compassion;&lt;br&gt;
Hearing it, fox asked her: &quot;How is that? In what fashion?&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Very much so!&quot; says the sheep, &quot;I owe him what I am.&lt;br&gt;
He&#x27;s mild! He could&#x27;ve eaten me, but just ate my lamb.&quot;

===The Neighborhood===
Rye sprouted up on land that, until then, fallow lay.&lt;br&gt;
But to what avail when, all about, bramble held sway.&lt;br&gt;
The soil was good, though it had never been touched by plow;&lt;br&gt;
It would have brought forth grain, did the bramble this allow.&lt;br&gt;
:Happy is the man who with equals shares his border!
Bad be famine, war, bad air; but worse still, bad neighbor.

===Refractory Oxen===
Pleasant the beginnings, but lamentable the end.&lt;br&gt;
In spring, the oxen to their plowing would not attend;&lt;br&gt;
They would not carry the grain to the barn in the fall;&lt;br&gt;
Came winter, bread ran out, the farmer ate them withal.

===The Drunkard===
Having spent at the bottle many a night and day,&lt;br&gt;
The ailing drunkard threw his mugs and glasses away;&lt;br&gt;
He declared wine a tyrant, reviled beer, cursed out mead.&lt;br&gt;
Then, his health restored... he&#x27;d no longer abstinence heed.

===Bread And Sword===
As the bread lay next to the sword, the weapon demurred:&lt;br&gt;
&quot;You would certainly show me more respect if you heard&lt;br&gt;
How by night and by day I conscientiously strive&lt;br&gt;
So that you may safely go on keeping men alive.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;I know,&quot; said the bread, &quot;the shape of your duty&#x27;s course:&lt;br&gt;
You defend me less often than you take me by force.&quot;

<text>Mukesh Chand Mathur (22 July 1923 – 27 August 1976), better known mononymously as Mukesh, was an Indian playback singer. He is considered to be one of the most popular and acclaimed playback singers of the Hindi film industry. Among the numerous nominations and awards he won, his song &quot;Kai Baar Yuhi Dekha Hai&quot; from the film &quot;Rajnigandha&quot; (1973) won him the National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer.

Mukesh was also popular as being the voice of actors Raj Kapoor, Manoj Kumar, Feroz Khan, Sunil Dutt and Dilip Kumar.

==Early life==
Mukesh was born in Delhi in a Mathur Kayastha family on 22 July 1923. His parents were Zorawar Chand Mathur, an engineer, and Chandrani Mathur. He was the sixth in a family of ten children. The music teacher who came home to teach Mukesh&#x27;s sister, Sundar Pyari, found a pupil in Mukesh, who would listen from the adjoining room. Mukesh left school after the 10th grade and worked briefly for the Department of Public Works. He experimented with voice recordings during his employment in Delhi and gradually developed his singing abilities and also his musical instrumental skills.

==Singing career==
Mukesh&#x27;s voice was first noticed by Motilal, a distant relative, when he sang at his sister&#x27;s wedding. Motilal took him to Bombay (now Mumbai) and arranged for singing lessons by Pandit Jagannath Prasad. During this period Mukesh was offered a role as an actor-singer in a Hindi film, &quot;Nirdosh&quot; (1941). His first song was &quot;Dil Hi Bujha Hua Ho To&quot; as an actor-singer for &quot;Nirdosh&quot; written by Neelkanth Tiwari. His first hit song as a playback singer was &quot;Dil Jalta Hai To Jalne De&quot; for actor Motilal in 1945 with the film &quot;Pehli Nazar&quot; with music composed by Anil Biswas and lyrics written by Aah Sitapuri.

Mukesh was such a fan of singer K. L. Saigal that in his early years of playback singing he used to imitate his idol. In fact, it is said that when K. L. Saigal first heard the song &quot;Dil Jalta Hai...&quot;, he remarked, &quot;That&#x27;s strange, I don&#x27;t recall singing that song&quot;.

Mukesh created his own singing style with the help of music director Naushad Ali, who helped Mukesh to come out of his Saigal style and create his own style. Naushad gave him songs for the film . Initially Mukesh was the ghost voice of Dilip Kumar in this movie and Mohammed Rafi sang for Raj Kapoor. He delivered many Hits for Naushad in films like: &quot;Anokhi Ada&quot; (1948), &quot;Mela&quot; (1948), (1949). Other composers who used Mukesh voice for great Dilip Kumar in hit songs like &quot;Jeevan Sapna toot gaya&quot; were Anil Biswas in Anokha Pyar, Ye Mera Diwanapan hai, Shankar–Jaikishan in Yahudi and Suhana Safar and Dil Tadap Tadap ke, Salil Choudhary in Madhumati. However, later Dilip Kumar choose Rafi as his ghost voice and Mukesh became the ghost voice of Raj Kapoor. Mukesh recorded highest number of songs for Shankar–Jaikishan, that is 133 songs followed by Kalyanji Anandji ie 99 songs. Out of 4 Filmfare Awards, Mukesh won 3 awards for Shankar–Jaikishan songs.

In 1974, Mukesh received National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer for the song &quot;Kai Baar Yuhi Dekha Hai&quot; from &quot;Rajnigandha&quot; (1974), and Filmfare Awards for the songs &quot;Sab Kuch Seekha Humne&quot; in the movie &quot;Anari&quot; (1959), &quot;Sabse Bada Naadan Wahi Hai&quot; in &quot;Pehchaan&quot; (1970), &quot;Jai Bolo Beimaan Ki&quot; in &quot;Beimaan&quot; (1972) (all the three songs composed by Shankar–Jaikishan) and &quot;&quot;, the title song of film &quot;Kabhie Kabhie&quot; (1976) (composed by Khayyam). A total of around 1,300 songs were sung by him. This number is less than those sung by some of his contemporaries, but the fact is that Mukesh emphasised on quality rather than quantity. The comparatively fewer songs sung by him in the 1970s can be attributed to his failing health due to his worsening heart problem.

Mukesh sang many songs for Kalyanji Anandji music director duo. Mukesh sang more songs with the K-A duo after Shankar–Jaikishan. From &quot;Naina hai jadoo bhare...&quot; &quot;Bedard Zamana Kya Jane&quot; (1958) composed by Kalyanji alone as Kalyanji Virji Shah, and &quot;Main hoon mast madari...&quot; &quot;Madari&quot; (1959) as the first Kalyanji-Anandji-Mukesh combo, to &quot;Chahe aaj mujhe napasand karo&quot; &quot;Darinda&quot; 1977, the K-A, Mukesh combination gave numerous popular songs like &quot;Chhalia mera naam...&quot;, &quot;Mere toote hue dil se...&quot;, &quot;Dum dum diga diga&quot; &quot;Chalia&quot; (1959), &quot;Mujhko iss raat ki tanhai mein...&quot; &quot;Dil Bhi Tera Hum Bhi Tere&quot; (1960), &quot;Hum chhod chale hain mehfil ko...&quot; (Ji Chahta Hai), &quot;Humne tumko pyar kiya hai jitna...&quot; (Dulha Dulhan), &quot;Chal mere dil lehraake chal...&quot; &quot;Ishara&quot; and &quot;Dheere se chalo...&quot; &quot;Johar Mehmood in Goa&quot;, &quot;Main to ek khwab hoon...&quot; and &quot;Chand si mehbooba ho...&quot; &quot;Himalay Ki Godmein&quot;(1965), &quot;Waqt kartaa jo wafaa...&quot; &quot;Dil Ne Pukara&quot;, &quot;Deewanon se yeh mat poocho...&quot; &quot;Upkar&quot;, &quot;Khush raho har khushi hai...&quot; &quot;Suhaag Raat&quot; and &quot;Humsafar ab yeh safar kat jaayega...&quot; &quot;Juari&quot;, &quot;Chandi ki deewaar...&quot; and &quot;Le chal le chal mere jeevan saathi...&quot; &quot;Vishwas&quot; (1969), &quot;Koi jab tumhara hriday tod de...&quot; , &quot;Darpan ko dekha...&quot; &quot;Upaasna&quot;, &quot;Jo tumko ho pasand...&quot; &quot;Safar&quot; and &quot;Mujhe nahin poochni tumse beeti baatein...&quot; &quot;Anjaan Raahein&quot; (1970).

Out of the numerous songs he gave his voice to, &quot;Kahin door jab din dhal Jaaye&quot; from &quot;Anand&quot; (1971), &quot;Ek Pyaar ka Nagma hai&quot; from &quot;Shor&quot; (1972), &quot;Maine Tere Liye Hi Saat Rang Ke&quot; from &quot;Anand&quot; (1971), &quot;Sab Kuch Seekha Humne&quot; from &quot;Anari&quot; (1959), &quot;Jeena yahan marna yahan&quot; and &quot;Kehta hai Joker&quot; from &quot;Mera Naam Joker&quot; (1971) are the most popular among his fans and followers.

In his career, Mukesh sung 110 songs for Raj Kapoor, 47 songs for Manoj Kumar and 20 songs for Dilip Kumar.

==As an actor and producer==
Mukesh started his career as an actor singer in the film &quot;Nirdosh&quot; in 1941, with Nalini Jaywant as his heroine. His second film was &quot;Adab Arz&quot; in 1943. He played a guest role in Raj Kapoor&#x27;s film &quot;Aah&quot; in 1953. He acted as a hero in the film &quot;Mashooka&quot; in 1953, opposite Suraiya and in the film &quot;Anurag&quot; (1956) (he was also the co-producer and composer in the film), opposite Usha Kiran and &quot;Mridula Rani&quot;. Mukesh also produced a film &quot;Malhar&quot; (1951) with hero Arjun &amp; heroine Shammi with Darling Films.

== Appreciation ==
Mukesh was a favourite of renowned Indian spin-bowler Bhagwath Chandrasekhar. When the sound of a Mukesh song drifted to the pitch, Chandrasekhar&#x27;s acknowledgement of the tribute would bring a roar from the crowd. Sunil Gavaskar wrote that sometimes he hummed a Mukesh tune on the field to inspire Chandra. Chandra&#x27;s passion affected team-mates Kirmani, Gundappa Viswanath, and even some journalists.

Google commemorated Mukesh on his 93rd birthday anniversary in 2016.

Department of Post released a commemorative postage stamp on his 100th birth anniversary.

==Personal life==
Mukesh married Saral Trivedi, daughter of Raichand Trivedi, a millionaire. With no proper house, an erratic income and what was then considered in India a supposedly &quot;immoral&quot; profession (singer in movies), the consent of Saral&#x27;s father for this marriage could not be obtained and Mukesh and Saral were forced to elope. They got married in a temple in Kandivali on 22 July 1946, Mukesh&#x27;s 23rd birthday, with the help of the actor Motilal and from the residence of R. D. Mathur. Everyone made dire predictions of unhappy days and divorce, but both weathered the lean days and celebrated their thirtieth wedding anniversary on 22 July 1976, four days before his departure for the USA. The couple had five children – Rita, the singer Nitin, Nalini (d. 1978), Mohnish and Namrata (Amrita). The actor Neil Nitin Mukesh is a grandson of Mukesh (son of Nitin).

==Death==
Mukesh died of a heart attack on 27 August 1976 in Detroit, Michigan, USA, where he had gone to perform in a concert. That morning, he got up early and went to take a shower. He came out short of breath and complaining of chest pains. He was rushed to a hospital but was pronounced dead. The rest of the concert was completed by Lata Mangeshkar and his son Nitin Mukesh. His body was flown to India by Mangeshkar, where a grand funeral ceremony was held in the presence of several actors, with personalities of the Indian film industry and fans paying tribute. When news of his death reached his acquaintance and actor Raj Kapoor, he burst into tears, and remarked, &quot;I have lost my voice,&quot; which is a testimony to the association of Mukesh&#x27;s voice (in playback) to the immensely popular songs of Raj Kapoor&#x27;s films.

After Mukesh&#x27;s death, his newer, hitherto unreleased, songs were released in 1977 in films such as &quot;Dharam Veer&quot;, &quot;Amar Akbar Anthony&quot;, &quot;Khel khiladi ka&quot;, &quot;Darinda&quot; and &quot;Chandi sona&quot;. The year 1978 also featured a considerable number of Mukesh&#x27;s songs in films such as &quot;Aahuti&quot;, &quot;Paramatma&quot;, &quot;Tumhari kasam&quot; and &quot;Satyam Shivam Sundaram&quot;, where Mukesh sang his last film song &quot;Chanchal sheetal nirmal komal&quot; for Raj Kapoor&#x27;s younger brother, Shashi Kapoor. From 1980 onward, Mukesh&#x27;s voice was heard in many later released films such as &quot;Shaitan mujarim&quot;, &quot;Premika&quot;, &quot;Patthar se Takkar&quot; (1980), &quot;Sanjh ki Bela&quot;, &quot;Maila Anchal&quot; (1981), &quot;Aarohi&quot; (1982), &quot;Chor Mandali&quot; (1983), &quot;Nirlaj&quot; (1985), &quot;Love and God&quot; (1986), &quot;Shubh Chintak&quot; (1989), and his last known release of &quot;Chand Grahan&quot; (1997).

<text>The Scaled Composites Model 339 SpaceShipTwo (SS2) was an air-launched suborbital spaceplane type designed for space tourism. It was manufactured by The Spaceship Company, a California-based company owned by Virgin Galactic.

SpaceShipTwo was carried to its launch altitude by a Scaled Composites White Knight Two, before being released to fly on into the upper atmosphere powered by its rocket engine. It then glided back to Earth and performed a conventional runway landing. The spaceship was officially unveiled to the public on 7 December 2009 at the Mojave Air and Space Port in California. On 29 April 2013, after nearly three years of unpowered testing, the first SS2 constructed successfully performed its first powered test flight.

Virgin Galactic planned to operate a fleet of five SpaceShipTwo spaceplanes in a private passenger-carrying service and took bookings for some time, with a suborbital flight carrying a ticket price of US$250,000 in 2015. The spaceplane was also used to carry scientific payloads for NASA and other organizations.

On 31 October 2014, during a test flight, the first SpaceShipTwo VSS &quot;Enterprise&quot; broke up in flight and crashed in the Mojave desert. An investigation found that the craft&#x27;s descent device deployed too early. One pilot, Michael Alsbury, was killed; the other was treated for a serious shoulder injury after parachuting from the stricken spacecraft.

The second SpaceShipTwo spacecraft, VSS &quot;Unity&quot;, was unveiled on 19 February 2016. The vehicle underwent flight testing 2016–2023. Its first flight to space (above 50 miles altitude), VSS &quot;Unity&quot; VP03, took place on 13 December 2018. The first operational flight of &quot;Unity&quot; (defined as the first flight flying passengers that were not Virgin Galactic employees) was Galactic 01 on 29 June 2023. The final flight of &quot;Unity&quot; was Galactic 07 on 8 June 2024.

== Design overview ==
The SpaceShipTwo project was based in part on technology developed for the first-generation SpaceShipOne, which was part of the Scaled Composites Tier One program, funded by Paul Allen. The Spaceship Company licensed this technology from Mojave Aerospace Ventures, a joint venture of Paul Allen and Burt Rutan, the designer of the predecessor technology.

SpaceShipTwo was a low-aspect-ratio passenger spaceplane. Its capacity was planned to be eight people — six passengers and two pilots. The SpaceShipTwo spaceplanes never flew with more than 6 people onboard (4 passengers, 2 pilots). The apogee of the new craft was designed to be approximately in the lower thermosphere, higher than the Kármán line but as of July 2021, the maximum height reached was 89.9 km. In the end, the SpaceShipTwos never broke the 100 km limit. The predecessor craft SpaceShipOne&#x27;s target was also 100 km but the last flight reached an altitude of . SpaceShipTwo was designed to reach , using a single hybrid rocket engine — the RocketMotorTwo. It launched from its mothership, White Knight Two, at an altitude of , and reached supersonic speed within 8 seconds. After 70 seconds, the rocket engine cut out and the spacecraft coasted to its peak altitude. SpaceShipTwo&#x27;s crew cabin was long and in diameter. The wing span was , the length was and the tail height was .

SpaceShipTwo used a feathered reentry system, feasible due to the low speed of reentry. In contrast, orbital spacecraft re-enter at orbital speeds, close to , using heat shields. SpaceShipTwo was furthermore designed to re-enter the atmosphere at any angle. It decelerated through the atmosphere, switching to a gliding position at an altitude of , and took 25 minutes to glide back to the spaceport.

SpaceShipTwo and White Knight Two were, respectively, roughly twice the size of the first-generation SpaceShipOne and mothership White Knight, which won the Ansari X Prize in 2004. SpaceShipTwo had -diameter windows for the passengers&#x27; viewing pleasure, and all seats reclined back during landing to decrease the discomfort of G-forces. In 2008, Burt Rutan remarked on the safety of the vehicle:
In September 2011, the safety of SpaceShipTwo&#x27;s feathered reentry system was tested when the crew briefly lost control of the craft during a gliding test flight. Control was reestablished after the spaceplane entered its feathered configuration, and it landed safely after a 7-minute flight.

== Fleet and launch sites ==
=== Fleet history ===
SpaceShipTwo (and the WhiteKnightTwo launcher aircraft) were built by The Spaceship Company, originally formed as a joint venture between Scaled Composites and Virgin Galactic. Virgin Galactic bought out Scaled Composites&#x27; interest in TSC in 2012, and TSC became a wholly owned subsidiary of Virgin Galactic.

The launch customer of SpaceShipTwo was Virgin Galactic, who had publicly announced they had ordered five vehicles, but only three had been ordered by 2015. The first SS2 was named VSS &quot;Enterprise&quot;. The &quot;VSS&quot; prefix stands for &quot;Virgin Space Ship&quot;. VSS &quot;Enterprise&quot; was the first to fly; it was destroyed in a crash on 31 October 2014. The build of VSS &quot;Unity&quot; was about 65% complete in early November 2014, and Virgin Galactic expected it to be complete in 2015. It was unveiled in February 2016 and performed its first powered flight in April 2018. The third SpaceShipTwo was expected to commence construction by the end of 2015.

&quot;Unity&quot; was retired on 8 June 2024 after its final flight took place on that date, as Virgin Galactic shifted its focus to the next generation Delta-class vehicles. At the time, the only SpaceShipTwos completed and flown were the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and the &quot;Unity&quot;.

=== Launch sites ===
SpaceShipTwo was launched from the WhiteKnightTwo launcher aircraft, which took off from the Mojave Air and Space Port in California during testing. Spaceport America (formerly Southwest Regional Spaceport), a US$212 million spaceport in New Mexico, partly funded by the state government, became the permanent launch site for the latter part of test flight programme and for commercial launches.

=== Ships in class ===
Two further ships were under construction by 2016. It is unclear whether these are now designated to be SpaceShip III class vehicles. As of 2024, the only SpaceShipTwo-class vehicles completed and flown are &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Unity&quot;.

== Development ==
On 28 September 2006, Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson unveiled a mock-up of the SpaceShipTwo passenger cabin at the NextFest exposition at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York. The design of the vehicle was revealed to the press in January 2008, with the statement that the vehicle itself was around 60% complete. On 7 December 2009, the official unveiling and rollout of SpaceShipTwo took place. The event involved the first SpaceShipTwo being christened by then - Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger as the VSS &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

=== 2007 test explosion ===
On 26 July 2007, an explosion occurred during an oxidizer flow test at the Mojave Air and Space Port, where early-stage tests were being conducted on SpaceShipTwo&#x27;s systems. The oxidizer test included filling the oxidizer tank with of nitrous oxide, followed by a 15-second cold-flow injector test. Although the tests did not ignite the gas, three employees were killed and three injured by flying shrapnel.

=== Rocket engine ===
The hybrid rocket engine design for SpaceShipTwo was problematic and caused extensive delays to the flight test program. The original rocket engine design was based on hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) fuel and nitrous oxide oxidizer, sometimes referred to as an N2O/HTPB engine. It was developed by Scaled Composites subcontractor Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) from 2009 to early 2014. In May 2014, Virgin Galactic announced a change to the hybrid engine to be used in SpaceShipTwo, and took the development effort in-house to Virgin Galactic, terminating the contract with Sierra Nevada and halting all development work on the first-generation rocket engine. Virgin then modified the engine design to include a change of the hybrid rocket fuel from a HTPB to a polyamide fuel formulation. In October 2015, Virgin announced that it was considering changing back to the original HTPB fuel.

==== 2014 change of engine ====
Rather than the rubber-based HTPB-fuel engine—engines that had experienced serious engine stability issues on firings longer than approximately 20 seconds — the engine would instead be based on a solid fuel composed of a type of plastic called thermoplastic polyamide. The plastic fuel was projected to have better performance (by several unspecified measures) and was projected to allow SpaceShipTwo to make flights to a higher altitude.

 when the version 2 engine by Virgin Galactic was publicly announced, the engine had already completed full-duration burns of over 60 seconds in ground tests on an engine test stand. The second-generation engine design also required the modification to the SS2 airframe to fit additional tanks in the wings of SpaceShipTwo — one holding methane and the other containing helium — in order to ensure a proper burn and shut-down of the new engine. Additional ground tests were performed on the new engine between May and October 2014.

==== 2015: another fuel change ====
Following a series of rocket engine tests, Virgin announced in October 2015 that they would be changing the rocket motor back to hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB), with a similar formulation as they used earlier in the development program before switching to a nylon-based fuel grain. They would use HTPB to power the SpaceShipTwo when it would resume flight following the loss of the initial SS2 test vehicle in October 2014. Full qualification tests remained to be completed at the time.

==== RocketMotorTwo ====
The second-generation RocketMotorTwo engine was a variant of the earlier SNC basic design, but was fueled by polyamide plastic fuel, while continuing to use the same nitrous oxide oxidizer. The second-generation engine was made in-house by Virgin Galactic rather than by SNC. By December 2012, 15 full-scale tests had been successfully conducted, and additional ground tests continued into March 2013. In June 2012, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a rocket testing permit to Scaled Composites, allowing it to begin SS2 test flights powered by RocketMotorTwo; the first such powered flight took place on 29 April 2013. The engine produced of thrust.

=== Test flights ===


==== Testing VSS &quot;Enterprise&quot; ====
In September 2012, Virgin Galactic announced that the unpowered subsonic glide flight test program was essentially complete. In October 2012, Scaled Composites installed key components of the rocket engine, and SpaceShipTwo performed its first glide flight with the engine installed in December 2012.

The spacecraft&#x27;s first powered test flight took place on 29 April 2013. SpaceshipTwo reached supersonic speeds in this first powered flight. On 5 September 2013, the second powered flight was made by SpaceShipTwo. The first powered test flight of 2014 — and third overall — occurred 10 January 2014. The spacecraft reached an altitude of and a speed of . The WhiteKnightTwo carrier aircraft released SpaceShipTwo (VSS &quot;Enterprise&quot;) at an altitude of .

==== October 2014 crash ====

On 31 October 2014, SpaceShipTwo VSS &quot;Enterprise&quot; suffered an in-flight breakup during a powered flight test, resulting in a crash killing one pilot, Michael Alsbury, and injuring the other. It was coincidentally the first flight to use the new type of fuel, based on nylon plastic grains. The crash was caused by a premature deployment of the feathering mechanism, which was normally used to aid in a safe descent. SpaceShipTwo was still in powered ascent when the feathering mechanism deployed. Disintegration was observed two seconds later.

, SpaceShipTwo had conducted 54 test flights. The spacecraft had used its &quot;feathered&quot; wing configuration during ten of these test flights.

The National Transportation Safety Board conducted an independent investigation into the accident. In July 2015, the NTSB released a report which cited inadequate design safeguards, poor pilot training, lack of rigorous federal oversight and a potentially anxious co-pilot as important factors in the 2014 crash. While the co-pilot was faulted for prematurely deploying the ship&#x27;s feathering mechanism, the Federal Aviation Administration, Federal Aviation Administration Office of Commercial Space Transportation, and the ship&#x27;s designers were also faulted for not creating a fail-safe system that could have guarded against such premature deployment.

==== VSS &quot;Unity&quot; ====
In October 2015, it was reported that the second SpaceShipTwo would make its first flight in 2016. VSS &quot;Unity&quot; was unveiled in February 2016.

A phase of testing called &quot;Integrated Vehicle Ground Testing&quot; began on VSS &quot;Unity&quot; in February 2016. Between 8 September and 30 November 2016, Virgin Galactic conducted a series of captive-carry flights of &quot;Unity&quot;, including planned glide flights (1 and 3 November 2016) for which the glide portion of the flight was cancelled because of wind speed. Glide flights of &quot;Unity&quot; began on 3 December 2016.

After several glide flights over the preceding months, in July 2017, Richard Branson suggested that the craft was to begin powered tests at three-week intervals. In September 2017, CEO George Whitesides suggested that engine testing was complete, and that only a &quot;small number of glide flights&quot; remained before VSS &quot;Unity&quot; would begin powered tests flights. In October 2017, Branson suggested that SpaceShipTwo could reach space within three months, and that he could travel to space aboard a SpaceShipTwo within six months. A seventh high speed glide test was completed in January 2018. On 13 December 2018, SpaceShipTwo VSS &quot;Unity&quot; reached its highest altitude up to that point, . This surpassed the U.S. Government definition of space at but not the standard used elsewhere at . Despite the debate on where outer space begins, Mark Stucky would receive his astronaut wings, while Frederick W. Sturckow would not as he had already flown on the Space Shuttle four times.

Following a February 2019 spaceflight, VSS &quot;Unity&quot; began to undergo modifications in preparation for commercial service; this includes an upgrading the flight deck and installing a passenger cabin. It was later revealed in 2021 that VSS &quot;Unity&quot; had actually suffered a large crack in its structure during its 2019 spaceflight, requiring repair work to the vehicle. Following its return to service VSS &quot;Unity&quot; made a test flight that included Richard Branson as a passenger on July 11, 2021. During this flight, the vehicle deviated from its planned flight course triggering a Federal Aviation Administration investigation into the issue. While in ascent the vehicle triggered a red warning light which indicated it had deviated from its safe flight path. On 2 September 2021, it was publicly announced that further SpaceShipTwo flight tests would be grounded by FAA mandate until the investigation was completed. The FAA cleared SpaceShipTwo flights to resume later in September, after deciding to expand the restricted aerospace around the vehicle&#x27;s flight range.

The final test flight (defined as final flight with only Virgin Galactic personnel onboard) was Virgin Galactic Unity 25 mission on 25 May 2023. The first operational flight of &quot;Unity&quot; (defined as the first flight flying passengers that were not Virgin Galactic employees) was Galactic 01 on 29 June 2023.

=== Costs ===
SpaceShipTwo&#x27;s total development costs were estimated at around US$400 million in May 2011, a significant increase over the 2007 estimate of US$108 million.

== Commercial operation ==

The duration of the flights was expected to be approximately 2.5 hours, although only a few minutes of that was to be in space. The price was initially US$200,000. More than 65,000 would-be space tourists applied for the first batch of 100 tickets. By December 2007, Virgin Galactic had 200 paid-up customers on its books for the early flights, and 95% were passing the 6-8 g centrifuge tests. That number had increased to 575 by early 2013.

In April 2013, Virgin Galactic announced that the price for a seat would increase 25% to US$250,000 before the middle of May 2013, and would remain at US$250,000 &quot;until the first 1,000 people have traveled, so that it matches up with inflation since [Virgin Galactic] started&quot;.

The first paying customers had been expected to fly aboard the craft in 2014, following 50–100 test flights. Refining the projected schedule in late 2009, Virgin Galactic declined to announce a firm timetable for commercial flights, but did reiterate that initial flights would take place from Spaceport America. Operational roll-out would be based on a &quot;safety-driven schedule&quot;.

In addition to making suborbital passenger launches, Virgin Galactic marketed SpaceShipTwo for suborbital space science missions.

=== NASA sRLV program ===
By March 2011, Virgin Galactic had submitted SpaceShipTwo as a reusable launch vehicle for carrying research payloads in response to NASA&#x27;s suborbital reusable launch vehicle (sRLV) solicitation, which was a part of the agency&#x27;s Flight Opportunities Program. Virgin projected research flights might reach a peak altitude of . These flights would provide approximately four minutes of microgravity for research payloads. Payload mass and microgravity levels had not been specified at the time. Since May 2021, NASA-supported technology and systems have been tested on SpaceShipTwo.

=== Future spacecraft ===
In August 2005, the president of Virgin Galactic stated that if the suborbital service with SpaceShipTwo would be successful, the follow-up SpaceShipThree would be an orbital craft. In 2008, Virgin Galactic suggested that it may develop a high-speed passenger vehicle to offer transport through point-to-point suborbital spaceflight.

<text>Svay Pak (; ; also called Kilometer 11 and K-11) is an urban commune of overseas Vietnamese in Cambodia, north of Phnom Penh. The commune has been renowned as a destination for adult and child prostitution, and while the latter has been cracked down upon, its prevalence was disputed.

==Geography==
Svay Pak is located north of the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh, in the district of Russey Keo, at coordinates . , the urban commune had a square footage of ; in January 2003, Svay Pak had a diameter of .

==History==
The afternoon of 20 August 1995 saw a fire sweep through Svay Pak. Approximately 300 houses and a &quot;Médecins Sans Frontières&quot; (MSF) clinic were burnt down, but the only loss of life was a local dog.  Non-governmental organizations Concern and MSF committed to helping residents (the latter promised to rebuild its clinic) alongside local philanthropists. While some locals accused the fire brigade of extorting them for firefighting services, local official Hou Samon said that the village roads were too narrow to accommodate the fire engine; Samon said that the local government planned &quot;to discuss letting the home and brothel-owners resettle in the same area, but first all the roads would have to be widened.&quot;
In 2000, the only industry in Svay Pak other than prostitution (and the support thereof) was fishing. , the commune&#x27;s residents were Vietnamese Cambodians, and those not working in the prostitution industry had &quot;tenuous citizenship status&quot;. The population in 2008 was 16446 people, a 3.03% increase from 1998&#x27;s population of 12197. By 2019, the population was 19042, a 1.3% increase in eleven years. In late 2019, Svay Pak had one of the four primary schools () built by the Khmer-Vietnam Association for Vietnamese populations living in Cambodia. After a November 2019 fire, the Vietnamese embassy in Phnom Penh, local businesses, and philanthropists contributed to rebuild houses for affected Vietnamese Cambodians in Svay Pak.

==Culture==
The Vietnamese expats in Svay Pak are unique as part of neither Cambodian society nor the Vietnamese diaspora. They are served by the Mary Magdalene Church, a local Catholic church established in 1998. In 2006, the church ran a school to assist second-generation Vietnamese Cambodians in assimilating (such as by teaching Khmer).

==Sex work==
Prostitution has been prevalent in Svay Pak since at least 1995, and was once &quot;one of the most notorious places in the world for sex slavery.&quot;

===Adult prostitution===
Locals reported that brothels first opened in 1985, but they proliferated in the years following the Cambodian–Vietnamese War, in the presence of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia&#x27;s peacekeeping forces. Post-war, Svay Pak&#x27;s political corruption and instability led to local authorities extorting brothel owners, while the sex workers themselves &quot;experienced raids, arrests, and rape from armed military and civil police forces operating under loose governmental control.&quot; Furthermore, managers in Svay Pak subverted the Cambodian law requiring 100% condom-use for brothels, resulting in a 19% rate of HIV for workers in 2000. Though prostitution in Cambodia was not illegal in 2004, other factors contributed to &quot;&quot;de facto&quot; criminalization&quot; of the industry.

In March 1999, there were about 300 migrant sex workers in 25 brothels. In May 2000, there were 24 brothels employing approximately 320 women on two main Svay Pak streets. By March 2002, as a result of decreasing demand, there were only 17 brothels and around 279 sex workers. Clients included local Vietnamese, Khmer, Chinese, Japanese, Australians, North Americans, and Europeans. The Southern Vietnamese teens and 20-somethings working in these brothels followed established migration routes into Svay Pak after intermediaries, sometimes the girls&#x27; and women&#x27;s families, were paid (equivalent to about $– in ). Servicing 14 clients per week, workers could repay this debt in 6–24 months, resulting in high turnover—half of Svay Pak&#x27;s sex workers had been there for six months of less.

&quot;The Phnom Penh Post&quot; reported that in 2005 the Cambodian government shut down the commune for a film production and simultaneously excised the brothels; by 2006, &quot;prostitutes no longer operate[d] with impunity.&quot;

===Child prostitution===
Gary Haugen of International Justice Mission (IJM) wrote that in 2000, Svay Pak was a lawless commune where &quot;tiny, elementary-school-age girls&quot; were prostituted to the public in broad daylight. One or more girls shared individual cubicles where they served Western child-sex tourists.

In 2002, child prostitution was bustling in Svay Pak, driven by child sex tourism from the Western world after child prostitution in Thailand was cracked-down upon. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; supposed that any sex tourists in Svay Pak were there for the children, for if &quot;a man wants an older girl then there are plenty on offer in the brothels and bars of Phnom Penh.&quot; The majority of the children were overseas Vietnamese, sold into prostitution by destitute families. Between the ages of six and 13, girls&#x27; virginity was sold for &quot;hundreds of dollars&quot;; prostituted repeatedly, the price diminished until reaching a low of or US$ (equivalent to £ or $ in ). At the turn of the 21st century, clients of child prostitution in Svay Pak expressed little fear of authorities because the police were compensated by the brothels; foreigners were only arrested if &quot;a bribe is missed, or an example needs to be made of someone&quot;. In 2003, Svay Pak saw up to 50 clients per night for child prostitution.

After two years of pressure from Women&#x27;s Affairs Minister Mu Sochua, women&#x27;s rights groups, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, action was taken on the problem of child prostitution on Svay Pak. On 22 January 2003, Svay Pak&#x27;s child brothels were raided by police. Dozens of pimps and clients were present during the raid, but none were arrested; the raid was &quot;widely advertised in advance&quot;, and all but a few of the children had been moved to the towns of Siem Reap and Sihanoukville beforehand. By 29 January, Svay Pak was described as &quot;a ghost town&quot; by the Asian Human Rights Commission; by March, however, a joint &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;–IJM investigation found that Svay Pak was &quot;&quot;the&quot; place to go if you&#x27;re looking for the youngest girls.&quot; That year, IJM founder Gary Haugen worked with Cambodian officials to mount an operation to rescue children and arrest perpetrators; despite problems arising from police bribery, &quot;a dozen suspected pimps and madams are in custody, and 37 girls [were] rescued, many under the age of 10.&quot; Upon returning to Svay Pak six months later, &quot;Dateline&quot; members were again offered prostituted children; Minister Sochua was not surprised by the reversion, blaming &quot;extreme poverty and widespread corruption&quot;.

When &quot;Dateline&quot; followed-up in 2008, the show reported that &quot;Svay Pak is a changed place. […] Many of the brothels have closed their doors and moved out of town, replaced by restaurants, a phone store, even a children&#x27;s community center serving children, some of the same children who were once exploited here.&quot; However, in 2011, CNN reported that while pimps no longer swarmed every foreign man who came into town, and children were not to be seen prostituting themselves from streetside windows, the child-sex industry remained; volunteers with Agape International Missions (AIM) were still rescuing girls from the now-underground trade. In 2011, a documentary was made about the problem in Svay Pak; named &quot;The Pink Room&quot; after a special room for the virgin girls, the film claimed that the child prostitution remained under a new veneer of legitimate businesses like bars or coffeehouses.

In May 2015, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; published an op-ed by Holly Burkhalter, the &quot;vice president of government relations and advocacy for [IJM].&quot; Burkhalter pushed back against the narrative that IJM and &quot;Dateline&quot; exposed in 2003, and proclaimed that Cambodian law-enforcement had rid the nation of child sex tourism (CST) in the face of international embarrassment and US Ambassador Charles A. Ray&#x27;s threat of discontinuing United States foreign aid. Burkhalter detailed government efforts and statistics to back-up her claims of CST eradication. Thirteen days later, the &quot;Post&quot; published a contrasting op-ed by AIM&#x27;s Donald J. Brewster. Writing from Svay Pak, Brewster claimed that the commune&#x27;s criminals have simply adapted to the government&#x27;s efforts, and continued to prostitute children aged 6–16. Agape International, Brewster wrote, had rescued 32 children from sex-trafficking in the preceding year, and highest levels of Cambodia&#x27;s anti-trafficking police agree&quot; with his evaluation of the continuing crime in Svay Pak.

ABC News traveled to Svay Pak in 2017 and found much the same situation as described by Brewster two years prior: though the number of children in sex work has dropped to 1–2% from 35% of those so working, Western men still solicited preteens for sex and the local SWAT equivalent continued to raid underage brothels. Later that year, CNN collaborated with AIM for an article that caught-up with a young woman (Sephak) who was prostituted out of Svay Pak as a child. In response to these stories, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen accused the non-governmental organization of exaggerating the sex trafficking in Svay Pak, announced a police investigation into AIM, demanded that US ambassador William A. Heidt do the same, and ordered—with &quot;the force of law&quot;—the charity group to leave Cambodia. Cambodian official Huy Vannak suggested that the government reaction against AIM may have stemmed from CNN accidentally implying that Sephak was ethnically Cambodian as opposed to being overseas Vietnamese (CNN issued a clarification). Hun Sen relented after locals spoke up in favor of the group&#x27;s work and Brewster apologized for their faux pas; though Brewster later returned to California, AIM was still providing services in Svay Pak .

After interviewing locals, clergy, and visiting workers, the &quot;Southeast Asia Globe&quot; said in March 2021 that &quot;all signs suggest that the open trade practiced in the village […] has been all but stomped out&quot;. Furthermore, both the illegal drug trade and tensions between the different ethnic groups have lessened over recent years. Locals also reported that the commune&#x27;s once-earned reputation leads to their discrimination outside of town. In June 2022, a business in Svay Pak was raided by police, and found to be have an underage girl offering sexual services.

<text>Burpengary is a town and suburb in the City of Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia. In the , the suburb of Burpengary had a population of 16,488 people.

It is by road from the Brisbane central business district.
== Geography ==
The locality is bounded to the east by the Bruce Highway, to the west by Oakey Flat Road, to the north-west by the North Coast railway line, and to the south-west by Burpengary Creek and the North Coast railway line.

Burpengary railway station serves the town ().

Burpengary Creek is the suburb&#x27;s main waterway.

Burpengary–Caboolture Road (Morayfield Road) runs through the locality from north-east to north.

== History ==

The name is derived from the Aboriginal word &quot;burpengar&quot;, meaning the &quot;place of the green wattle&quot;.

When Europeans settled in Burpengary in the 1870s, the industry was mainly timber-cutting.

Burpengary Provisional School opened on 9 November 1876. On 1 January 1909 it became Burpengary State School. It closed and re-opened a number of times as student numbers fluctuated.

The town of Burpengary was initially founded as a large truckstop due to its strategic location on the North Coast Road (now the Bruce Highway) from Brisbane to the North Coast (now the Sunshine Coast). Burpengary is still home to a functional truck weigh-bridge.

St Eugene College (Burpengary&#x27;s first secondary school) opened on 1 December 1989.

Burpengary Library opened in 1994 and had a major refurbishment in 2016.

Historically, Burpengary has been a predominantly blue-collar suburb with a significant proportion of the population directly employed in a labouring or trade-related jobs. However, with expanding planned communities, access to the M1 and council approving plans for mini city initiatives, more and more families are moving to the locality including those in the professions. This is fuelling economic growth with the expansion of the shopping precinct, local services and increasing pressure on the local transport infrastructure since 2005.

Tony Leung Ka-fai (; born 1 February 1958) is a Hong Kong actor who is a four-time winner of the Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actor.

As he is often confused with actor Tony Leung Chiu-wai, Tony Leung Ka-fai is known as &quot;Big Tony&quot;, while Tony Leung Chiu-wai is known as &quot;Little Tony&quot;, nicknames which correspond to the actors&#x27; respective age and physical statures.

==Career==
Leung has been in the film industry for more than 30 years, starring in a variety of roles. His debut film was &quot;Burning of the Imperial Palace&quot; (1983), where he played the Xianfeng Emperor. He would later work with Chow Yun-fat in three films, &quot;Prison on Fire&quot; (1987), &quot;A Better Tomorrow 3&quot; (1989), and &quot;God of Gamblers Returns&quot; (1994). He also appeared as Joyce Godenzi&#x27;s husband in &quot;She Shoots Straight&quot;, Joyce&#x27;s trademark film.

In 1991, Leung went to France to appear in Jean-Jacques Annaud&#x27;s &quot;The Lover&quot;, based on Marguerite Duras&#x27;s novel, as the older lover of a young teen schoolgirl, who was played by British actress Jane March.

Leung was originally asked to portray the title character of &quot;The Last Emperor&quot; (1987) but declined due to prior commitments. The role later went to John Lone.

Leung went on to star in the international horror feature film &quot;Double Vision&quot; with American actor David Morse. His ongoing career has seen him star in films such as &quot;The Myth&quot; (2005), &quot;Everlasting Regret&quot; (2005) and &quot;Election&quot; (2005).

Leung won his fourth Best Actor award for his performance in &quot;Cold War&quot; at the 32nd Hong Kong Film Awards.

He also starred in the music video of Mayday&#x27;s song &quot;Tough&quot; in 2016.

<text>Paweł Mąciwoda (; born on 20 February 1967) is a Polish bassist who began playing with the hard rock band Scorpions in 2003 and became an official member in January 2004.

== Early career ==
Born in Wieliczka, Mąciwoda began playing bass guitar semi-professionally at the age of 15 with his father&#x27;s encouragement. His young age on the rock and roll circuit earned him the nickname &quot;Baby&quot;, but within a few years Mąciwoda was touring Europe with a jazz fusion band called the Little Egoists, and for overlapping periods of time performed as a member of the avant-garde rock bands Düpą and Püdelsi, both based in Kraków. At about the same time he also released a solo album entitled &quot;Radio Wieliczka&quot;. His other band credits during his early years included the popular jazz-rock band Walk Away, headed by the world-famous violinist Michał Urbaniak and lead vocalist Urszula Dudziak, with whom he recorded the album &quot;Magic Lady&quot;.

== Current projects ==
In 2009, he appeared on the WU-HAE&#x27;s &quot;Opera Nowohucka&quot; album alongside such artists as Grzegorz Markowski, Maciej Maleńczuk and Olaf Deriglasoff.

As of 2011, Mąciwoda has been collaborating with friend and fellow musician Efrem Wilder in the outfit Stirwater. The name Stirwater is derived from the English translation of Mąciwoda last name &quot;Mąciwoda&quot;. The collaboration between musicians ended after a couple of years but they managed to get a single recorded. It was called &quot;Water water&quot; and it was number two for a couple of weeks on the Polish radio station Trójka in the summer of 2012. After that the band broke up but the project Stirwater is continued as he is playing and recording with fellow musicians from all over the world e.g. Florian Hofer from Germany or Atma Anur from UK.

<text>James Kottak (December 26, 1962 – January 9, 2024) was an American drummer, best known for his work with the German hard rock band Scorpions, which he joined in 1996. At the time of his firing from the band in 2016, he was their longest-serving drummer. Kottak was also an original member of Kingdom Come, of whom he was their drummer from 1987 to 1989 and again from 2018 to his death in 2024.

==Career==
Prior to joining Scorpions, Kottak was a drummer for Nuthouse, Apex, the Bob Brickley Band, Mister Charlie, Buster Brown, Montrose, Kingdom Come, Wild Horses, the McAuley Schenker Group, Warrant, and Ashba. As a teenager in Louisville, he had a strong local presence in several live bands, including the fusion group Nuthouse, which also featured his Durrett High School bandmate Don Braden (later a world-renowned jazz saxophonist). He received a music scholarship to the University of Louisville. 
His first instrument was the trumpet, but he later fell in love with the drums around age of 9 and started playing in local bars at the age of 15.

In 1987, Kottak was part of the band Buster Brown, a group from Louisville, Kentucky, when guitarist Ronnie Montrose recruited both Kottak and vocalist Johnny Edwards for his new album Mean. This collaboration further showcased Kottak&#x27;s versatile drumming skills. That same year, Kottak relocated to Los Angeles to pursue further opportunities in the music industry, after being recommended by RATT&#x27;s drummer Bobby Blotzer, who had seen him perform at a bar in Louisville.

In the follow year, Kottak gained early mainstream exposure during his time with Kingdom Come, appearing on the band&#x27;s first two studio albums, the first of which included their biggest hit, &quot;Get It On&quot;. This track prominently features Kottak&#x27;s drumming, culminating in a drum solo just before the song&#x27;s conclusion. Around 1990, Kottak joined The Cult, but left after the first batch of demos for their then-upcoming fifth studio album &quot;Ceremony&quot;, in which the album&#x27;s drum tracks were done by Mickey Curry.

In 1993, James Kottak joined the glam metal band Warrant as their drummer, contributing to the recording of the album Ultraphobic (1995), which marked a sonic shift for the group, incorporating hard rock and grunge influences in response to the evolving music scene of the time. His tenure with the band lasted until 1996.

James Kottak joined the Scorpions in 1996, replacing longtime drummer Herman Rarebell who had left the band in 1995 to focus on other projects, and as part of the search for a new drummer, he recommended Kottak, with whom he had developed a good rapport during the Monsters of Rock Tour in 1988. At that time, Kottak was playing with Kingdom Come, a band that shared the festival lineup alongside Metallica, Dokken, Scorpions, and Van Halen.

Kottak had previously collaborated with Michael Schenker in the McAuley Schenker Group, contributing to the recording of the album MSG in 1991. His experience and versatility caught the attention of producer Keith Olsen, renowned for producing iconic albums such as Crazy World (1990) and Pure Instinct (1996) with Scorpions, as well as In Your Face (1989) with Kingdom Come. Olsen, who had previously chosen Kottak for other projects, further reinforced Rarebell&#x27;s recommendation. Although Kottak did not record the Pure Instinct album, he was invited for a successful audition and officially becoming the first non-German member of the Scorpions.

In February 1997, he joined Dio on their U.S. tour by filling in for Vinny Appice for four or five shows when the latter had pneumonia. He also gave drum lessons at Far-Out Music in Jeffersonville, Indiana, once having onetime Bride drummer, Jerry McBroom as a student. He played with guitarist Michael Lee Firkins and also collaborated with DJ Ashba on his solo album &quot;Addiction to the Friction&quot;.

That same year, James Kottak took part in a tribute album dedicated to Rod Stewart, which reimagined his classic songs with a hard rock approach. The project featured renowned musicians such as John Corabi (ex-Mötley Crüe), Eric Singer (Kiss), and Jani Lane (Warrant). Kottak contributed his drumming talents to the track “Rock My Plimsoul” with Jeff Pilson and C.C DeVille.

Kottak also played in his own band Kottak (formerly known as KrunK), serving as both the lead vocalist and guitarist, often performing with &quot;Dean guitars&quot;.

He participated in the band World War III, performing as the drummer alongside Mandy Lion (vocals), Kurt James (guitar), and Jimmy Bain (bass) during their 2009 performance at the Key Club in West Hollywood.

He had many other connections and contributions with musicians including Alan Krigger, Darren Wharton (Dare), Robbie Crane, Phil Soussan, CC DeVille and Kelly Hansen in Needle Park, Tommy Henriksen, George Lynch, Willie Basse, Uli John Roth, bassist Sean McNabb, Robin Brock and many others.

In 2013, James Kottak formed the group &quot;Project Rock&quot; with Keri Kelli, Rudy Sarzo, and Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens. The project was conceived as a collaboration between experienced musicians to perform classic hard rock songs with new arrangements. That same year, the band toured Russia and played at several European festivals, gaining recognition for their energetic performances with a set composed by songs of Alice Cooper, Dio, Judas Priest, Scorpions and so on.

Later, the group was renamed A New Revenge and released their debut album, &quot;Enemies &amp; Lovers&quot;, in 2019 through Golden Robot Records. The album included original tracks like &quot;Never let you go&quot; and &quot;The Way&quot;, blending influences of classic hard rock with a modern approach. However, due to the members&#x27; individual commitments, the band was unable to go on a tour to promote the album.

On April 28, 2016, it was announced that Kottak would be replaced by Mikkey Dee on 12 North American headlining dates, including a run of shows at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas dubbed &quot;Scorpions blacked out in Las Vegas&quot;. On September 12, 2016, it was announced that Kottak was no longer in the band.

Brigade
In 2017, James Kottak joined the rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll band BRIGADE alongside renowned musicians Howard Leese (guitar), Robin McAuley (vocals), and Jason Boyleston (bass). The band stood out for their performance at the Ronnie Montrose Remembered event in 2017, a tribute to the legendary guitarist Ronnie Montrose. 
In addition to his work, Kottak was also a notable presence at the Bonzo Bash, a recurring tribute event celebrating the legacy of Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham.

Kottak endorsed Ddrum and Yamaha drums, Aquarian drumheads, Zildjian Cymbals, Ahead drumsticks, accessories and Danmar percussion and Dean guitars for his own band.

==Personal life==
Kottak was married to Athena Bass, Tommy Lee&#x27;s younger sister, who is also a drummer and was a fellow member of Kottak. The couple, married in 1996, had three children, Matthew, Tobi and Miles (drummer of the indie rock band Bad Suns). They divorced in 2010.

On April 29, 2014, the &quot;National Post&quot; reported via the Associated Press that Kottak had been arrested in Dubai and sentenced to one month in jail for offensive behavior, insulting Islam, and public drunkenness.

On September 12, 2016, he was fired from Scorpions for his alcoholism, and would later work on his recovery.

==Television, film appearances and others==
He contributed to the book &quot;Sex Tips from Rock Stars&quot; by Paul Miles, published by Omnibus Press in July 2010.

James appeared in the reality TV series Ex-Wives of Rock, which aired from 2012 to 2014. The show focused on the lives of the ex-wives of famous rock musicians, with Athena Lee, Kottak&#x27;s ex-wife, being one of the main cast members.

Additionally, Kottak was featured in the documentary film Scorpions: Forever and a Day (2015), which provides an inside look at the band&#x27;s history.

==Death==
On January 9, 2024, Kottak was found dead in his bathroom at his home in Louisville, Kentucky, at the age of 61. His exact cause of death is unknown as of yet. However, heavy metal news source &quot;Metal Sludge&quot; stated that his cause of death was believed to be cardiac arrest.

<text>Michelle Danielle Collins (born 28 May 1962) is an English actress. She is known for her role as Cindy Beale in the BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; (1988–1990, 1992–1998, 2023–present), as well as appearing as Stella Price in ITV&#x27;s &quot;Coronation Street&quot; (2011–2014). Her other notable television roles include the BBC dramas &quot;Real Women&quot; (1998–1999), &quot;Sunburn&quot; (1999–2000) and &quot;Two Thousand Acres of Sky&quot; (2001–2003).

==Early life and education==
Collins was born on 28 May 1962 at Hackney Hospital, Homerton High Street in Hackney, east London, to a Welsh mother, Mary, and a father of English and Flemish heritage. Her Flemish grandfather was Belgian from Antwerp and had emigrated to the UK in 1915 when aged five. She, alongside her elder sister Vicki, were brought up by their mother in Highbury, London. When Collins was 14, her mother went back to university to obtain a law degree. In the 1970s, Collins was a member of the youth organisation the Woodcraft Folk, and visited Romania with the group.

Collins trained at the Royal Court Activists and Cockpit Youth Theatre from the age of 14, and Kingsway Princeton College, where she studied drama and theatre at O/A-level.

==Career==
===Early career===
After her exams, Collins landed a role in Mikhail Bulgakov&#x27;s &quot;The Crimson Island&quot;, directed by Lou Stein, at the Gate Theatre. Her career changed direction after performing in the 1978 video for the Squeeze song &quot;Cool For Cats&quot;, and as a backing singer for Mari Wilson and the Wilsations. The band spent 18 months touring the country. When the band broke up in 1982, she went back into acting and with the help of her friend, the British actor Tim Roth, she gained a part in a musical with Gary Hutton and Gary Shail.

Collins&#x27;s first TV appearance was with Gary Oldman in the BBC drama &quot;Morgan&#x27;s Boy&quot;. Other TV credits included: two series of the sitcom &quot;Running Wild&quot;, where she played Ray Brooks daughter; a part in ITV drama &quot;The Bill&quot;; a Screen Two production &quot;Lucky Sunil&quot;, directed by Michael Caton-Jones and a BBC play &quot;Pressures&quot;. She later appeared in three films: &quot;Personal Services&quot;, &quot;Empire State&quot; and Stephen Poliakoff&#x27;s &quot;Hidden City&quot;. Collins appeared in an episode of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Bergerac&quot; (series 4) in 1985.

===&quot;EastEnders&quot;===

While she was filming the BBC play &quot;Pressures&quot; in 1988, Collins was spotted by &quot;EastEnders&quot; producer Julia Smith, who asked her to audition for the role of Cindy Beale, who was to feature in 11 episodes of the soap. The manipulative, reckless nature of her character was a hit with viewers so her contract was extended and the character became a major villain in the series. Cindy was the unfaithful wife of &quot;EastEnders&quot; stalwart Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), between 1988 and 1998. During breaks from &quot;EastEnders&quot; she filmed the drama &quot;Real Women&quot; for the BBC, with Pauline Quirke and Frances Barber. On 14 November 2014, Collins reprised the role of Cindy for a short stint for Children in Need.

In May 2023, it was announced that Collins would be returning to the soap after 25 years, alongside Woodyatt, thus resurrecting the character from the dead. Collins returned to the role permanently in June 2023, where it is revealed that Cindy hadn&#x27;t died in childbirth, but had entered a witness protection programme and had taken on the identity of &#x27;Rose Knight&#x27;, the wife of George Knight (Colin Salmon) and the mother of Gina (Francesca Henry) and Anna (Molly Rainford).

===After &quot;EastEnders&quot;===
After leaving &quot;EastEnders&quot; in 1998, her career saw a series of drama roles. These included: two series of &quot;Real Women&quot; (BBC One); two series of &quot;Sunburn&quot; (BBC One), for which Collins sang the theme song (which was a no. 28 hit in the UK Singles Chart in 1999); &quot;Daylight Robbery&quot; (ITV); &quot;The Sleeper&quot; (BBC One); &quot;Uprising&quot; (ITV): three series of &quot;Two Thousand Acres of Sky&quot; (BBC One): the two-part series &quot;Perfect&quot; (ITV); &quot;Lloyd and the Hill&quot; (ITV) and &quot;Ella and the Mothers&quot; (BBC One). In 2003, Collins played Sarah Barton in &quot;Single&quot;.

In 2003, Collins filmed the BBC drama &quot;Sea of Souls&quot; and then went on to star in a film for Granada/Channel 4 called &quot;The Illustrated Mum&quot;, which told the story of two girls coping with the unpredictable behaviour of their depressed, alcoholic mother. The film, written by Jacqueline Wilson, was based on the children&#x27;s novel of the same name. It was screened over Christmas 2003 and won an Emmy Award and two BAFTAs.

In 2004, she starred in an episode of &quot;French and Saunders&quot; and also starred with fellow &quot;EastEnders&quot; actor Martin Kemp in the ITV drama &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot;. In 2005, Collins starred in the ITV drama &quot;The Last Detective&quot; and in the BBC drama &quot;The Family Man&quot;, alongside Daniela Denby-Ashe, which aired in March 2006. She starred in the West End musical &quot;Daddy Cool&quot;, and while working during the night there shot sequences for a cameo in the short film &quot;Broken&quot; written and directed by Vicki Psarias, which went on to win the several international awards. She also featured in the film &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Dreaming&quot;, released in 2007. She left &quot;Daddy Cool&quot; in January 2007 to shoot the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;42&quot;.

On 2 July 2007, it was announced that Collins has been cast for the lead role of Karina Faith in new ITV drama series, &quot;Rock Rivals&quot;, produced by Shed Productions. In 2009, Collins took part in the BBC Wales programme &quot;Coming Home&quot; about her Welsh family history. On 21 May 2009, it was rumoured that Collins had auditioned to star in US drama &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, but she did join the cast.

In June 2010, it was announced that Collins would make a six-episode guest appearance as a patient&#x27;s mother in &quot;Casualty&quot;. In 2010, she also guest-starred in &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot; at the Octagon Theatre, Bolton, playing the Nurse. From 7 April-7 May 2011, Collins starred as Sheila Grundy, Fred Dibnah&#x27;s third wife, in &quot;The Demolition Man&quot; at Octagon Theatre, Bolton.

===&quot;Coronation Street&quot;===
In January 2011, a rumour was posted on Digital Spy that Collins was in talks to join &quot;EastEnders″&quot; main rivalling soap &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, after she allegedly met with soap&#x27;s producer and close friend Phil Collinson. Three months later it was confirmed Collins had joined the cast as Stella Price, new landlady of the Rovers Return pub, beating Lisa Maxwell for the role. Her first episode aired on 16 June 2011 and gained a rating of 8.4 million. It was announced on 22 August 2013 Collins had decided to leave &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. In January 2014, Collins claimed she was &quot;unhappy&quot; over the lack of screen time for her and her character. Collins filmed her final scenes on 19 February 2014, and made her final appearance as Stella on 2 April 2014.

===After &quot;Coronation Street&quot;===
Since leaving &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, Collins has had various guest roles in television dramas: &quot;Casualty&quot; as Samantha Kellman (2014), &quot;Death in Paradise&quot; as Annette Burgess (2015), and &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; as Nadine Campbell (2016). In October 2019 Collins appeared in &quot;Casualty&quot; as Lorna Rowle/Hammond. In 2016, Collins took part in the ITV reality series &quot;Bear Grylls: Mission Survive&quot;.

==Personal life==
Collins has a daughter by ex-partner Fabrizio Tassalini, Maia Rose (b. 29 September 1996).

In 2014, Collins revealed that in 1998 – distraught by the end of her relationship with Tassalini and feeling career pressure – she attempted suicide while filming &quot;Sunburn&quot; in Cyprus. She took an overdose of sleeping pills but later woke up and asked her costar to take her to hospital.

After their split, Collins had an amicable relationship with Tassalini, who lived close by, and they raised their daughter together until he died in 2014. In April 2022 Collins announced she was engaged to her partner of 10 years, Mike Davidson. They married in August that year.

In August 2014, Collins was one of 200 public figures to sign a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; in opposition to Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

Collins is involved in charitable causes. She is an ambassador for Oxfam and has visited Brazil, South Africa and Armenia, promoting the need for the basic right to education. She is also an ambassador for Ambitious about Autism and a patron for the Alexandra Wylie Tower Foundation.

<doc id="1311322" wikidata="Q7426234" url="?curid=1311322" title="Satire boom">
<text>The satire boom was the output of a generation of British satirical writers, journalists and performers at the beginning of the 1960s. The satire boom is often regarded as having begun with the first performance of &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot; on 22 August 1960 and ending around December 1963 with the cancellation of the BBC TV show &quot;That Was The Week That Was&quot;. The figures most closely identified with the satire boom are Peter Cook, John Bird, John Fortune, David Frost, Dudley Moore, Bernard Levin and Richard Ingrams. Many figures who found celebrity through the satire boom went on to establish subsequently more serious careers as writers including Alan Bennett (drama), Jonathan Miller (polymathic), and Paul Foot (investigative journalism).

In his book &quot;The Neophiliacs&quot;, Christopher Booker, who as a founding editor of &quot;Private Eye&quot; was a central figure of the satire boom, charts the years 1959 to 1964. He begins with the Cambridge Footlights student revue &quot;The Last Laugh&quot; written by Bird and Cook; it later transferred to the West End. Booker ends the period with the cancellation of the television series &quot;That Was The Week That Was&quot;, and the closing of the Establishment Club.
The boom was driven by well-connected graduates from first the University of Cambridge, and then the University of Oxford. BT states, &quot;The ground-breaking revue &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot;, starring Oxbridge graduates Alan Bennett, Peter Cook, Jonathan Miller and Dudley Moore, opened at the Fortune Theatre, London in 1961 – and started something of a revolution in humour.&quot; Booker argues that, with the response to the Suez Crisis which effectively marked the end of the British Empire as a great power, an upper middle class generation with public school and Oxbridge educations who had grown up with certain expectations—of following a career in colonial administration or the civil service—suddenly found themselves surplus. Peter Cook had already entered for a Foreign Office entrance exam, before his stage career took off. At the same time the emergence of the &quot;angry young men&quot; and &quot;kitchen sink realism&quot; in drama were signs that British culture was increasingly dominated by the concerns of the &quot;common man&quot;. The Labour Party was proving to be an ineffective opposition to a patrician Conservative government. The satire-boom generation were in general apolitical or had (at that time) left-of-centre tendencies.

<doc id="1311332" wikidata="Q2707044" url="?curid=1311332" title="Christopher Dawson">
<text>Christopher Henry Dawson (12 October 188925 May 1970) was an English Catholic historian, independent scholar, who wrote many books on cultural history and emphasized the necessity for Western culture to be in continuity with Christianity not to stagnate and deteriorate. Dawson has been called &quot;the greatest English-speaking Catholic historian of the twentieth century&quot; and was recognized as being able to expound his thought to &quot;Catholic and Protestant, Christian and non-Christian.&quot;

The 1988–1989 academic year at the College of Europe was named in Dawson&#x27;s honour. 

==Life==
Christopher Henry Dawson was born of an Anglo-Catholic family in the Bevan ancestral home of Hay Castle, during the waning years of the Victorian era, and spent most of his childhood among the ruins of the Yorkshire countryside. His parents were Captain Henry P. Dawson and Mary Louisa, the eldest daughter to the Welsh Archdeacon Bevan. Captain Dawson, although an army officer, was more of an explorer than a soldier, and the closest he ever came to actual combat was behind the front-lines in the Franco-Prussian War. He joined a field-ambulance unit with his cousin Herbert Kitchener, later Lord Kitchener of Khartoum.

Dawson was raised in a devout Anglo-Catholic household. Dawson&#x27;s childhood was exuberance and wonderment, spending most of his time in the place which would set the course for his interest in history: The Yorkshire countryside. It is here where the young imaginative Dawson would roam around through abbeys and castles for numerous hours. Dawson experienced the past not as an object of distant sentimentality but as something near to the present which one can find meaning in.

During his youth, Dawson had cultivated a profuse interest in Catholicism by virtue of his father&#x27;s own interests for Roman Catholicism. Dawson recognised a moral and spiritual beauty within the Catholic Church, leading to an intellectual awakening which culminated in his conversion on the Feast of the Epiphany in 1914. Dawson reflected on this time: 

In 1899, he was sent to Bilton Grange for public school. As a consequence of living predominantly secluded from any social interactions besides that of his family, he was frightened of germs. Dawson was exceptional in only History and English. Dawson suffered from internal torment when facing the world outside his cherished home life. The pain which he had suffered during his time there stuck with him. His daughter recalled an incident when he neared the gates of a school she was about to attend, Dawson murmured &quot;I can&#x27;t face it&quot;; he left the car and sat in the wood reading a book. In 1903, Dawson&#x27;s father enrolled him to Winchester College. Dawson was a schoolmate of Arnold J. Toynbee but they never encountered each other. Dawson cultivated &quot;a strong historical consciousness that was fed by the aesthetics of that ancient place of worship&quot; Dawson later wrote of his experience at Winchester Cathedral: However, he later stated that Winchester College &quot;was the best of English schools&quot;.

He was brought up at Hartlington Hall, Yorkshire.
Dawson was educated at Winchester College and Trinity College, Oxford, where he obtained 2nd class honours in Modern History in 1911. After his degree he studied economics. He also read the work of the German theologian Ernst Troeltsch.

Dawson&#x27;s background was Anglo-Catholic, but he converted to Roman Catholicism in 1909.

In 1916, Dawson married Valery Mills, daughter of the architect Walter Edward Mills. They had two daughters and one son.

==Career==
Dawson was considered a leading Catholic historian. He was a Lecturer in the History of Culture, University College, Exeter (1930–6), the Forwood Lecturer in the Philosophy of Religion, University of Liverpool (1934), the Gifford Lecturer at the University of Edinburgh (1947 and 1948), and the Chauncey Stillman Professor of Roman Catholic Studies at Harvard University (1958–62). Dawson was elected as a Fellow of the British Academy in 1943.

From 1940 for a period he was editor of the &quot;Dublin Review&quot;.

==Writings==

Dawson began publishing articles in &quot;The Sociological Review&quot; in 1920. His starting point was close to that of Oswald Spengler and Arnold J. Toynbee, others who were also interested in grand narratives conducted at the level of a civilisation. Dawson&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Age of the Gods&quot; (1928), was apparently intended as the first of a set of five to trace European civilisation to the twentieth century. However, he did not follow this plan to a conclusion.

Dawson was a proponent of an &#x27;Old West&#x27; theory, the later term of David Gress, who cites Dawson in his &quot;From Plato to Nato&quot; (1998). Dawson rejected the blanket assumption that the Middle Ages in Europe failed to contribute any essential characteristics. He argued that the medieval Catholic Church was an essential factor in the rise of European civilisation, and wrote extensively in support of that thesis.

==Influence==

His writings in the 1920s and 1930s made him a significant figure of the time, and an influence in particular on T. S. Eliot, who wrote of his importance. Dawson was on the fringe of &#x27;The Moot&#x27;, a literary discussion group, and also part of the Sword of the Spirit ecumenical group. According to Bradley Birzer, Dawson also influenced the theological underpinnings of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s writings.

The topical approach outlined by Dawson for the study of Christian culture forms the core of the Catholic Studies program at Aquinas College. His work was influential in the founding of Campion College and the formation in 2012 of The Christopher Dawson Society for Philosophy and Culture Inc. in Perth, Western Australia.

Dawson&#x27;s vision also underlies the Humanities and Catholic Culture program at the Franciscan University of Steubenville.

==Comparable historians==
As a revivalist of the Christian historian, Christopher Dawson has been compared with Kenneth Scott Latourette and Herbert Butterfield. Comparisons have also been made between the work of Dawson and Max Weber. Both employ a metahistorical approach to their subjects, and their subjects themselves bear similarities; namely, the influence of religion on aspects of western culture.
