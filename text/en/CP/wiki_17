<text>The Conscience of a Conservative is a 1960 book published under the name of Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater who was the 1964 Republican presidential candidate. It helped revive the American conservative movement and make Goldwater a political star, and it has influenced countless conservatives in the United States, helping to lay the foundation for the Reagan Revolution of the 1980s.

The book was largely ghostwritten by L. Brent Bozell Jr., brother-in-law of William F. Buckley Jr. Bozell and Buckley had been members of Yale&#x27;s debate team. They had co-authored the controversial book, &quot;McCarthy and His Enemies&quot;, in 1955. Bozell had been Goldwater&#x27;s speechwriter in the 1950s and was familiar with many of his ideals.

==Content==
The 123-page book covers such topics as education, labor unions and policies, civil rights, agricultural policy and farm subsidies, social welfare programs, and income taxation. The book is considered to be a significant statement of politically and economically American conservative ideas which were to gain influence during the following decades.

In his book, Goldwater states explicitly that there are &quot;laws of God&quot; and &quot;truths of God&quot; which inform his concept of &#x27;conservatism&#x27; and under which the US should operate.

==Later editions==
A half-century edition, edited by C.C. Goldwater (his granddaughter), with a foreword by George Will, and an afterword by Robert F. Kennedy Jr, was published by the Princeton University Press in 2007.

== Namesake books ==
The book, and its title, continue to inspire contemporary political commentary.

* In 2007, Paul Krugman entitled his own book &quot;The Conscience of a Liberal&quot;, saying in the introduction that he wanted his work to stand as a counterpoint to Goldwater&#x27;s.

<text>Edyta Małgorzata Bartosiewicz (born 11 January 1965) is a Polish rock singer, composer, and songwriter. In Poland, she&#x27;s known for her highly reflective and unusual lyrics. Sixteen of her singles reached the top of Polish Radio charts. Over the course of her musical career, she has received five Fryderyk awards – the most important recognition in the Polish music industry.

==Biography==
=== Early career ===
Bartosiewicz learned to play guitar at age ten. She studied at Nicolaus Copernicus High School in Warsaw (XXXIII L.O. im. Mikołaja Kopernika), and was interested in sports, and later attended SGPiS in Warsaw (now SGH, Warsaw School of Economics.)

Interested in music and having played in a few bands, she left for London in 1986 where she met The Blue Aeroplanes. After her return to Warsaw, having dropped out of college, she joined the Staff group. In 1989 she won Mokotowska Jesień Muzyczna. In the following year, she appeared on &quot;The Big Beat&quot;, an album by the band Holloee Poloy (formerly the Staff group). She received a number of awards and sang guest and backing vocals on various records.

===Solo career===
Edyta quit Halloee Poloy due to, as she said herself, resistance to her composing and songwriting style. At the end of 1991 she started recording the album &quot;Love&quot; in studio S-4 in Warsaw. Rafał Paczkowski was responsible for the production of that album. This time her album was successful. By 2001, 67,000 copies had been sold and finally the album achieved Gold status. The most popular singles from this album were: “If”, “Goodbye to the Roman Candles,” “Blues for you”, “Have to Carry On”. The album was also released in Western Europe by Chrysalis Records but didn&#x27;t make much noise there.

On 18 May 1994 the album “Dream” (Sen) was released by Izabelin Studio. It was recorded with a completely new band i.e. Michał Grymuza (guitars), Radosław Zagajewski (bass), Krzysztof Palczewski (keyboard). Leszek Kamiński ( Bartosiewicz&#x27;s husband as of 1990) was responsible for the production. This time her new album was sung mostly in Polish unlike the previous one &quot;Love&quot;, sung mostly in English. The music can be described as eclectic, including acoustic songs as well as hard rock songs such as cover of the song &quot;Move Over&quot; by Janis Joplin. Her songs: “Dream” (Sen), “Capricorn” (Koziorożec), “Tattoo” (Tatuaż), or “Joke at a Zoo” (Żart w zoo) were a huge success on the music charts.

In 1994, at the end of September, nine concerts were given in the nine biggest Polish cities. The tour was a huge success, as well as the album, which achieved Platinum status after selling over 300 thousand copies. Bartosiewicz herself was declared the best singer by the readers of the Polish magazine &quot;Only Rock&quot; (&quot;Tylko Rock&quot; – now known as &quot;Teraz Rock&quot; [&quot;Now Rock&quot;]), and the album&#x27;s title song &quot;Dream&quot; (&quot;Sen&quot;) is still one of her best known. The singer also received two 1995 Fryderyk Awards in the category: Best Artist and Best Pop/Rock Album.

By the beginning of 1995 a new single “Wonderful tonight” was released. It was a cover of Eric Clapton song and it reached second place on Hit Parade of Program 3 (Polish radio station). At the beginning of July the single &quot;Madness&quot; (&quot;Szał&quot;) was released to promote the album &quot;Shock’n’show (Szok&#x27;n&#x27;show)&quot;.

In October people saw Edyta perform live in 13 cities. The tour ended in May 1996. The biggest hits were: the promotional single “Madness”, Time of high tide”, “The Clock” (“Zegar”) which was released as a single in November, and the great, immortal ballad “The Last One” (“Ostatni”). The single “Anger is no use” (“Na nic gniew”) which was released during that summer is also worth noting. The album “Shock’n’Show” received the platinum status and to this day more than 280.000 of MC and CD copies have been sold. In 1995 the album won the Fryderyk (Polish music award) in the category Rock Album, and was nominated in eight different categories. The readers of music magazines lauded her work:
* The Best Album Award – readers of “Only Rock” (“Tylko Rock”) plebiscite
* The Best Singer Award – readers of “Only Rock” plebiscite
* Second place in Hit of the year category – readers “Only Rock” plebiscite
* Seventh place for “The Clock”
* Second place in the Best Singer category – readers of “Brum” plebiscite
* The Best Video of the Year Award for “Madness” – readers of “Brum” plebiscite
The video for “The Clock” won “Zloty Yacht” in category The Best Video of the Year. A new challenge for Bartosiewicz at the end of 1995 was a music production of an album of the group Firebirds.

The year 1996 was as impressive in Bartosiewicz&#x27;s career as the previous one. She played dozens of concerts, including July 9 when she opened Bryan Adams’ concert in the Spodek Katowicki. She was a star during &quot;Wegorzewo 1996&quot; (Polish music festival). Edyta&#x27;s recital during Sopot Festival was very well received. It was there that she achieved Platinum status for her albums &quot;Dream&quot; and &quot;Shock’n’show&quot;. She received a warm reception. The recital lasted about 40 minutes but thanks to enthusiastic reaction of the public it was prolonged for 4 encores. Edyta performed her biggest hits but also presented her two new songs &quot;Only a moment&quot; (&quot;Tylko moment&quot;) and &quot;Think about me&quot; (&quot;Pomyśl o mnie&quot;), which became a single.

In October she started working on her new album, which was recorded in January and February 1997. The premiere of Edyta&#x27;s fourth album entitled &quot;Dziecko&quot; (&quot;Child&quot;) took place on June 9, and the single &quot;Jenny&quot; got airplay in radio stations from April 21. By September more than 100.000 copies were sold, and the album was in the top ten of bestselling albums of the year. The album was promoted on tour and a second single &quot;Skłamałam&quot; (&quot;I Lied&quot;), became a big hit. During a concert in &quot;Stodola&quot; (Stodoła) in Warsaw she went platinum yet again for the &quot;Dziecko&quot; (more than 200.000 CD and MC sold). Next singles: &quot;Nie znamy się” („We Don&#x27;t Know Each Other”), ‘Boogie czyli zemsta slodka jest’ and the title track “Dziecko” enjoyed popularity. In February Edyta played three concerts in the United States and Canada. In March 1998 Edyta once again won the Fryderyk for “Best Rock Album”. Additionally, she was nominated in five other categories. The album “Dziecko” is thought to be the most honest album of Polish rock and, generally speaking, Polish entertainment music. (Machina 03/02).

In July 1998 Edyta entered the studio to record a new album. This time it was not with Leszek Kaminski but with an English publisher Rafał Mckenna who also worked with artists such as Blur, Pulp, or Radiohead. The first song from this album was &quot;Miłość jak ogień&quot; (&quot;Love Like Fire&quot;) which immediately reached No. 1 on Polish hit lists. The premiere of the album &quot;Wodospady&quot; (&quot;Waterfalls&quot;) took place on 9 November 1998. Another single was the title track. The reviews characterized it as the most mature of her albums. Songs like &quot;Mandarynka&quot; (&quot;Mandarin&quot;) revealed Edyta&#x27;s interest in psychedelic music. On the other hand, Edyta did not turn her back on the image known from her previous albums, confirmed with songs like &quot;Miłość jak ogień&quot; and &quot;Wodospady Łez&quot;. In many reviews it is said that the most distinguished long plays are &quot;Dream&quot;, &quot;Child&quot; and &quot;Waterfalls&quot;. The video to the third single &quot;Siedem mórz, siedem ladów&quot; (&quot;Seven Seas, Seven Lands&quot;) was shot in picturesque landscapes in the US (precincts of Los Angeles). In May 1999 the last single promoting &quot;Waterfalls&quot;, entitled &quot;The Rebel&quot; (&quot;Buntowniczka&quot;) was released. To date, 75,000 copies have been sold which gave Edyta another golden status title. In 1998 she was nominated to the Fryderyk in multiple categories.

On 29 November 1999 the album &quot;Today are my birthday- the best of&quot; (&quot;Dziś są moje urodziny- the best of&quot;) was released. This was the album summing up Edyta&#x27;s artistic work and was promoted with the song &quot;21st century&quot; (&quot;XXI wiek&quot;). The album, as Edyta admitted, a contractual obligation. At the beginning of 2000 the song &quot;Master&quot; (&quot;Mistrz&quot;) was released and promoted a medley. She ended 1999 with a departure from her record label Universal Music Polska.

The year 2000 started with a prestigious award for Personality of the Decade presented by &quot;Only Rock&quot; magazine. In February 2000 Edyta collaborated with Justyna Steczkowska. She wrote a number of lyrics for Justyna&#x27;s album &quot;Day &amp; Night&quot;. Moreover, she also made a well-matched duet with Kazik Staszewski in the hit-song &quot;Four Rooms&quot;, which promoted Kazik&#x27;s album &quot;Melassa&quot;. In the same year she collaborated with Anita Lipnicka. Together they created &quot;The Last Letter&quot; song – Edyta prepared the music and Anita wrote the lyrics. Effect of that collaboration was presented on Anita&#x27;s album &quot;My eyes are green&quot; (2000). In January 2001 Edyta, together with the band Agressiva 69, recorded the title song for Mariusz Treliński&#x27;s movie &quot;Egoists&quot;.

In January 2001 the song &quot;The Tale&quot; appeared on the subsequent volume of the &quot;Fridays for fives&quot; medley by Radio ZET. The song became a hit. The beginning of 2001 also brought changes to Edyta&#x27;s group: drummer Krzysztof Poliński was replaced by Przemek Momot, who had worked with, among others, Kasia Nosowska, Robert Gawliński, groups Yugoton and Women; and bass player Radek Zagajewski was replaced by Michał Grott. In November 2001 Edyta published a re-release of her first solo album &quot;Love&quot;. The album was published in Universal&#x27;s series &quot;Invincible&quot;. Bartosiewicz was also asked to write a number of lyrics for Edyta Górniak’s album &quot;The Pearl&quot; (2002). The song &quot;I don&#x27;t ask for more&quot; became a second single from that album. Edyta is also author of the lyrics for the title track, which was released as a fourth single.

At the beginning of 2002 Edyta signed a contract with BMG Poland and on 4 March she started work on a new album. On 17 June the single &quot;Innocence&quot;, that was supposed to promote the new album, was released. On 29 June the video clip for that song was broadcast. The new album was supposed to be released in August 2002; however, for unknown reasons, and despite the fact that the album was finished, the release-date was postponed multiple times. After a while Edyta and BMG Poland declared the contract null and void, and to date the album has not been released.

In 2004, quite unexpectedly, Edyta performed in a duet with Krzysztof Krawczyk in a song &quot;It&#x27;s hard for... (us to be together)&quot;. That song became a second single from Krawczyk&#x27;s album &quot;That which is important in life&quot; and achieved a great commercial success on the market, becoming the biggest hit of 2004. In August, Edyta appeared together with Krzysztof Krawczyk during the Sopot music festival. Moreover, Edyta performed during 2004 New Year&#x27;s Eve concert organized by TVP (state-owned Polish Television). The year 2004 was extremely successful for Edyta Bartosiewicz. She managed a comeback in media and was on the covers of many popular magazines for a long time.

After a 6-month break Edyta returned on 5 June 2005, performing on Cracowian Main Market Square during the Enchanted Song Festival. Edyta was among such stars as: Anna Maria Jopek, Sylwia Wiśniewska, Urszula, Andrzej Piaseczny, Grzegorz Turnau, Michał Wiśniewski, and Paweł Kukiz. She truly enchanted the crowd with her two hit songs: “Jenny” and “The Last One”.

In September 2005, Edyta performed during a special 10-year-anniversary concert for Myslovitz; during which she performed the song “I would like to die of love” together with Myslovitz’s frontman, Artur Rojek.

Motivated by the huge success of her duet with Krzysztof Krawczyk, Edyta returned to work on her new album. She returned to Sony &amp; BMG (formerly BMG Poland) and the release of her new album was scheduled for spring 2006. Unfortunately, just when the album was about to be released, a tragedy happened. Manager, concert organizer and Edyta&#x27;s best friend – Jacek Nowakowski, died on 9 March. He was only thirty-four. Edyta, devastated, cancelled the release of the new album.

On 2 September 2006 Edyta performed during a Tomasz Stańko, her last appearance for two years. She returned to the stage on 5 July 2008 at the TOPtrendy Festival in Sopot, on the occasion of Krzysztof Krawczyk&#x27;s 45th anniversary on stage. With Krawczyk, she performed &quot;The Tale&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Hard For... (Us to Be Together).&quot;

<doc id="1319435" wikidata="Q289426" url="?curid=1319435" title="Bebe Rebozo">
<text>Charles Gregory &quot;Bebe&quot; (pronounced ) Rebozo (November 17, 1912 – May 8, 1998) was an American Florida-based banker and businessman who was a close friend and confidant of President Richard Nixon.

==Early life==

The youngest of 12 children (hence, the nickname &quot;Bebe&quot; meaning &quot;Baby&quot; in Spanish) of Cuban immigrants of Canary Islands ancestry to Tampa, Florida, Matias and Carmen, Rebozo owned several businesses in Florida, including a gas station and a group of laundromats, before he started his own bank, the Key Biscayne Bank &amp; Trust, in Key Biscayne, Florida, in 1964. Rebozo regularly attended Key Biscayne Community Church, sometimes accompanied during later years by Nixon.

==Friendship with Richard Nixon==

Rebozo first met then-U.S. Representative Nixon in 1950 through Florida Representative George Smathers. Smathers had recommended Key Biscayne as a vacation destination to Nixon, who eventually established a residence there which was later nicknamed the &quot;Winter White House&quot; by journalists. While Nixon was vacationing in Key Biscayne, Smathers had Rebozo take Nixon deep sea fishing. Rebozo and Nixon then started a friendship that endured 44 years.

Rebozo quickly became best friend and financial and real estate advisor to Nixon. In 1968 Rebozo changed his party from Democratic to Republican.

According to Rebozo, the two men were swimming together at Rebozo&#x27;s home in June 1972 when Nixon was first informed of the Watergate Hotel break-in, and he was with the president on the night that Nixon resolved to resign from the presidency. 
John Dean, Nixon&#x27;s lawyer, testified before the House Judiciary Committee that he had been ordered to direct government agencies covertly to punish a journalist who called Rebozo &quot;Nixon&#x27;s bagman.&quot; Rebozo was investigated for accepting covert payments of $100,000 on behalf of Nixon.

Journalist Jack Anderson speculated that Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox had been fired because he had started to investigate Rebozo&#x27;s role in Nixon&#x27;s accepting covert payments.

According to a November 27, 1975, article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, a completed manuscript of a biography on Rebozo, which was scheduled to be published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux, was stolen from the home of Thomas Kiernan. In addition to Rebozo&#x27;s biography, &quot;several tape recordings of interviews and several research files, including one file containing all of Mr. Kiernan&#x27;s book contracts and another containing all his royalty statements, were taken,&quot; the newspaper reported. Other news coverage at the time pointed out that the &quot;thieves [had] ignored&quot; jewelry and other items of value.

In 1974, Rebozo received a letter threatening his life that year.

In 1976, Rebozo was the subject of a bank fraud investigation. The loan application Rebozo filed with Hudson Valley National Bank in Yonkers, New York, stated that the loan was for residential real estate when it was actually used for business. Rebozo repaid the loan with interest, and the bank did not file a complaint.

=== Role in firing of NPS director George Hartzog ===
Rebozo encouraged Richard Nixon to fire then-National Park Service director George Hartzog in retaliation for receiving &quot;a ticket from a park ranger in Biscayne National Park for tying his boat illegally to an NPS administrative dock there.&quot; Nixon fired Hartzog in December 1972, despite attempts by Secretary of the Interior Rogers Morton to talk the president out of his decision.

Nixon opted to replace Hartzog with his office&#x27;s head of travel arrangement Ron Walker, an &quot;unqualified appointment&quot; who openly admitted &quot;that he did not know the difference between the National Park Service and the Boy Scouts.&quot; Rebozo&#x27;s influence on Nixon&#x27;s firing of Hartzog has also been noted in Dr. Gil Lusk&#x27;s 2019 book &quot;National Parks: Our Living National Treasures&quot; and &quot;A Conservative Environmentalist: The Life and Career of Frank Masland Jr.&quot; Former National Park Service director Jonathan B. Jarvis has credited Rebozo with indirectly bringing about an overly-politicized era of the Parks program administration that still exists to the present, wherein NPS directors are expected to resign with the election of each new president.

==Death==
Rebozo died on May 8, 1998, of complications from a brain aneurysm.

==Personal life==
Following his graduation from Miami High School, class of 1930, Rebozo married his high school sweetheart, Claire Gunn. Both of them were 18, and the marriage was annulled three years later. In 1946, they remarried but divorced four years later. He later married Jane Lucke, who survived him.

<doc id="1319448" wikidata="Q1066027" url="?curid=1319448" title="Charles R. Schwab">
<text>Charles Robert Schwab Sr. (born July 29, 1937) is an American investor and financial executive. The founder and chairman of the Charles Schwab Corporation, he pioneered discount sales of equity securities starting in 1975. His company became by far the largest discount securities dealer in the United States. He semi-retired from the company in 2008 when he stepped down as CEO, but he remains chairman and is the largest shareholder. 

As of 2025, his net worth is estimated by &quot;Forbes&quot; to be $11.7 billion, making him the 203rd richest person in the world.

==Early life and education==
Schwab was born in Sacramento, California, the son of Terrie and Lloyd Schwab. He is one of two children, having a younger sister. His father was a lawyer and the district attorney of Yolo County, while his mother was a housewife. Schwab grew up in Woodland, California, before moving to Santa Barbara, California, at the age of 12. In his youth, he worked several jobs, including as an ice cream salesman, a railroad switchman, a roustabout in an oil field, and as a caddie.

He attended Santa Barbara High School and was captain of the golf team. He attended pre-college school at Holy Rosary Academy in Woodland. Schwab graduated from Stanford University in 1959 with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics. In 1961, he graduated from Stanford Graduate School of Business with a Master of Business Administration. He is a knight of the Sigma Nu fraternity.

==Investment career==
In 1963, Schwab and three other partners launched &quot;Investment Indicator&quot;, an investment newsletter. At its height, the newsletter had 3,000 subscribers, each paying $84 a year to subscribe. In April 1971, the firm incorporated in California as First Commander Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Commander Industries, Inc., to offer traditional brokerage services and publish the Schwab investment newsletter. In November of that year, Schwab and four others purchased all the stock from Commander Industries, Inc. In 1972, Schwab himself bought all the stock from what was once Commander Industries.

===Charles Schwab &amp; Co.===
In 1973, First Commander changed its name to Charles Schwab &amp; Co., Inc. A decisive turning point came in 1975, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission deregulated the securities industry through the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, allowing companies like Schwab to charge any fees they wanted. Schwab had long complained that the established firms showed little concern for the needs of their customers. In those times securities were not bought by consumers, they were sold by salesmen, who made higher commissions and profits by selling riskier securities regardless of possible disadvantages to the consumers. Schwab set up a series of radically different policies. First, charges to consumers were cut in half. Second, salesmen were (and still are today) paid hourly salaries, rather than commissions on the total sale price. It set up a toll-free number to take orders nationwide and later set up a 24/7 telephone system that would allow customers to place orders from anywhere, at any time. Established firms were outraged by these innovations, and tried to block Schwab&#x27;s expansion.

=== Expansion ===
In September 1975, Schwab opened its first branch in Sacramento, California. It expanded across the state and cut its expenses by putting a heavy emphasis on automation. In 1981, Bank of America offered Schwab $53 million in stock for his 37 percent ownership. He sold, but remained as president of a semi-autonomous unit. At this point the unit had annual sales of $41 million, 600 employees, and 220,000 customers through 40 branches. Expansion was rapid, reaching 1.6 million customers in 1986, with sales of $308 million. Bank of America, however, had its own separate severe problems, and its stock plunged. The SEC investigated Schwab on the possibility he was selling stock to take advantage of insider information; he denied it, and no charges were filed. Tensions between the Schwab unit and Bank of America escalated until 1987, when the deal was cut for Schwab to buy back the brokerage company for $230 million. Schwab took the firm public. In 1988, however, the company was forced to rebate $2 million to customers whose funds had been illegally used.

In 1977, Schwab began offering seminars to clients. By 1978, the company had 45,000 client accounts total, and the number grew to 84,000 in 1979. In 1980 Schwab established the industry&#x27;s first 24-hour quotation service, and the total of client accounts grew to 147,000. In 1981 Schwab became a member of the NYSE, and the total of client accounts grew to 222,000. In 1982, Schwab became the first firm to offer 24/7 order entry and quote service. It opened its first international office in Hong Kong, and the number of client accounts totaled 374,000. By 1995 the company was by far the largest discount broker, with revenue of $1.4 billion and $200 billion in total assets managed. By 1996 there were 3.6 million active accounts.

David S. Pottruck, who had spent the majority of his 20 years at the brokerage as Schwab&#x27;s right-hand man, shared the CEO title with Schwab from 1998 to 2003. In May 2003, Schwab stepped down, and gave Pottruck sole control as CEO. Just a year later, on July 24, 2004, the company&#x27;s board fired Pottruck, replacing him with Schwab. News of Pottruck&#x27;s removal came as the firm had announced that overall profit had dropped 10 percent, to $113 million, for the second quarter, driven largely by a 26 percent decline in revenue from customer stock trading. After coming back into control, Schwab conceded that the company had &quot;lost touch with our heritage&quot;, and quickly refocused the business on providing financial advice to individual investors. He also rolled back Pottruck&#x27;s fee hikes. The company rebounded, and earnings began to turn around in 2005, as did the stock.

Schwab always stressed cutting-edge technology, and pioneered computerization to replace paperwork. The emergence of the World Wide Web in the mid-1990s posed a new threat with new startups trying to exploit their software. Schwab responded in 1996 by becoming the first major financial services firm to sell online listed and over-the-counter stocks, as well as mutual funds and bonds. The startups charged $36 a trade, and Schwab charged $39 per Internet trade, compared to $160 charged by traditional brokerages using the old technology. In 1984, the firm innovated with the Mutual Funds Marketplace, which gave customers a choice of 140 no-load funds. It expanded to 500 no-load funds by 1992. In 2000, Schwab introduced mobile/wireless trading with its PocketBroker mobile app that functioned on RIM (BlackBerry), Palm, Windows CE, and WAP-enabled phones, with deployments in the US, UK, and Hong Kong. Schwab also introduced Charles Schwab Bank, N.A., a federally chartered intrastate retail bank headquartered in Reno, Nevada. The application for the bank was approved in February 2003 by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

==Personal life==
Schwab sits on the board of trustees of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and is a chair emeritus. He lived in San Francisco until 2020 when he sold his house for $14 million. He now lives in Florida.

He is a practicing Roman Catholic and is involved in philanthropy. Schwab and his wife Helen previously lived in Atherton, California. They currently reside in Florida. 

Schwab is dyslexic but was unaware of it until the age of 40 when he learned that one of his sons is also dyslexic. The Charles and Helen Schwab Foundation, whose primary focus is &quot;to ensure that each student reaches his or her full potential&quot;, supports research and programs related to learning disabilities, including dyslexia.

===Family===
Schwab has been married twice. He has three children from his first marriage to Susan Cotter: Charles Jr. (known as &quot;Sandy&quot;), Carrie, and Virginia. Charles and Susan Schwab later divorced; Schwab&#x27;s first wife is not to be confused with politician Susan Carol Schwab, who is not related to Charles R. Schwab.

Schwab subsequently remarried, to Helen (O&#x27;Neill) Schwab, with whom he has two children: Katie and Michael. His daughter Carrie is married to author Gary Pomerantz. She is president of the Charles and Helen Schwab Foundation and also served as a council member on President Obama&#x27;s Advisory Council on Financial Capability. His son Charles Jr., who played quarterback at Northwestern University, is the father of four children: Haley, Samantha, Sydney, and Charlie.

Schwab&#x27;s granddaughter, Samantha Schwab, served in the first Trump administration in the White House Office of Legislative Affairs. In January 2025, Trump announced that Samantha will serve in his second administration as a deputy to the Treasury Chief of Staff.

== Political and economic views ==
Schwab is a Republican, who has donated heavily to the party (including the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee). Schwab opposes a wealth tax.

In 2012, Schwab donated nearly $9 million to Americans for Job Security, a group which opposed Barack Obama in the 2012 election.

In 2017, Schwab donated the maximum legal individual amount of $101,700 to the Republican National Committee&#x27;s legal defense fund, which partially paid for the legal defense of President Donald Trump during the Mueller investigation. In 2019, Schwab was listed as one of the largest PAC contributors in the US, donating $12.5 million to general conservative political activities, with $2 million given to Trump.

In 2021, following the January 6 United States Capitol attack, Schwab&#x27;s firm ceased political donations and discontinued its political action committee, citing the &quot;hyperpartisan&quot; political climate. The PAC donated its remaining funds to the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America and historically black colleges and universities. Following this, Schwab has continued political donations as an individual, separate from his firm. In March 2021, Schwab donated more than $366,000 to a pro-McCarthy PAC; as well as over $200,000 each to the NRCC and the NRSC.

== Wealth ==
, Schwab is worth $10.6 billion, according to &quot;Forbes&quot;. The Charles and Helen Schwab Foundation was formed in 1987. In 2013, it reported assets of $270 million and made $13 million in grants. He serves as its chairman; his wife is the president.

<text>Blinded by the Right: The Conscience of an Ex-Conservative is a 2002 book written by former conservative journalist David Brock, detailing his departure from the conservative movement. It is also the story of his coming out as a gay man. 

In the book, he states that he visited gay bars with Matt Drudge and other conservatives. The title alludes to the Bruce Springsteen song &quot;Blinded by the Light&quot;, while the subtitle alludes to Barry Goldwater&#x27;s &quot;The Conscience of a Conservative&quot;, which helped define the modern conservative movement in the United States.

==Synopsis==
Brock recalls his days at the University of California, Berkeley, and how he was turned off by hecklers at a speech by then United States ambassador to the United Nations, Jeane Kirkpatrick. Brock&#x27;s main attraction to conservatism was his disdain for communism.

After college, Brock moved with his then-partner (called &quot;Andrew&quot; to conceal his identity) to Washington, D.C. In D.C., Brock worked for &quot;The Washington Times&quot; and &quot;The American Spectator&quot;. Brock claims while he was working for those publications he thought he was doing honest journalism, but later stated that he had never corroborated his facts.

While working for &quot;The American Spectator&quot;, he wrote an article on Anita Hill, which he later expanded into &quot;The Real Anita Hill&quot;, a book that made him popular in the conservative movement. Brock would later say that many of the details he used were false.

After Bill Clinton was elected, Brock was assigned to write a story, later dubbed Troopergate, about four Arkansas state troopers who held a grudge against Bill Clinton. He claims that the troopers made up stories about affairs that could never be corroborated. Brock was given assurances that the troopers would not get paid for telling their stories. He later discovered he was deceived, and that the troopers had been paid by Richard Mellon Scaife, who bankrolled &quot;The American Spectator&quot; and the Arkansas Project, a secret project to discredit Clinton.

Brock made sure to conceal the identities of the women identified by the troopers, with the exception of one woman named &quot;Paula&quot;. Brock thought that by not revealing her last name, it would be enough to conceal her identity. Brock did not take into account that Little Rock is a small city. Eventually her identity would be revealed as Paula Jones, which led to her civil lawsuit against Bill Clinton.

Following the Troopergate story, Brock wrote a book about Hillary Clinton, &quot;The Seduction of Hillary Rodham&quot;. Unlike the Anita Hill book, Brock decided not to put anything in the book that he could not corroborate. The book was not as critical of Hillary Clinton as it was promised to be. Brock claims that conservatives planned on the book being so damning as to influence the outcome of the 1996 presidential election.

&quot;The Seduction of Hillary Rodham&quot; was the beginning of Brock&#x27;s falling out with the conservative movement. The issue that forced him to leave the conservative movement was the movement&#x27;s intolerance towards homosexuality. Brock had reluctantly come out of the closet, prior to writing the Hillary Clinton book, and believes this contributed to his being shunned by many in the movement.

Brock voted for Al Gore in 2000, the first time he voted since he voted for Ronald Reagan in 1984. During the period in which he did not vote, he had two rationalizations for his non-voting:
* He believed that his vote did not count in liberal Washington, D.C.
* He believed that not voting allowed him to stay neutral
Brock proclaimed that the latter rationalization was bogus, as he was not neutral during that time period.

<doc id="1319467" wikidata="Q19902738" url="?curid=1319467" title="On Growth and Form">
<text>On Growth and Form is a book by the Scottish mathematical biologist D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth Thompson (1860–1948). The book is long – 793 pages in the first edition of 1917, 1116 pages in the second edition of 1942.

The book covers many topics including the effects of scale on the shape of animals and plants, large ones necessarily being relatively thick in shape; the effects of surface tension in shaping soap films and similar structures such as cells; the logarithmic spiral as seen in mollusc shells and ruminant horns; the arrangement of leaves and other plant parts (phyllotaxis); and Thompson&#x27;s own method of transformations, showing the changes in shape of animal skulls and other structures on a Cartesian grid.

The work is widely admired by biologists, anthropologists and architects among others, but is often not read by people who cite it. Peter Medawar explains this as being because it clearly pioneered the use of mathematics in biology, and helped to defeat mystical ideas of vitalism; but that the book is weakened by Thompson&#x27;s failure to understand the role of evolution and evolutionary history in shaping living structures. Philip Ball and Michael Ruse, on the other hand, suspect that while Thompson argued for physical mechanisms, his rejection of natural selection bordered on vitalism.

==Overview==

D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth Thompson was a Scottish biologist and pioneer of mathematical biology. His most famous work, &quot;On Growth and Form&quot; was written in Dundee, mostly in 1915, but publication was put off until 1917 because of the delays of wartime and Thompson&#x27;s many late alterations to the text. The central theme of the book is that biologists of its author&#x27;s day overemphasized evolution as the fundamental determinant of the form and structure of living organisms, and underemphasized the roles of physical laws and mechanics. At a time when vitalism was still being considered as a biological theory, he advocated structuralism as an alternative to natural selection in governing the form of species, with the smallest hint of vitalism as the unseen driving force.

Thompson had previously criticized Darwinism in his paper &quot;Some Difficulties of Darwinism&quot;. &quot;On Growth and Form&quot; explained in detail why he believed Darwinism to be an inadequate explanation for the origin of new species. He did not reject natural selection, but regarded it as secondary to physical influences on biological form.

Using a mass of examples, Thompson pointed out correlations between biological forms and mechanical phenomena. He showed the similarity in the forms of jellyfish and the forms of drops of liquid falling into viscous fluid, and between the internal supporting structures in the hollow bones of birds and well-known engineering truss designs. He described phyllotaxis (numerical relationships between spiral structures in plants) and its relationship to the Fibonacci sequence.

Perhaps the most famous part of the book is Chapter 17, &quot;The Comparison of Related Forms,&quot; where Thompson explored the degree to which differences in the forms of related animals could be described, in work inspired by the German engraver Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528), by mathematical transformations.

The book is descriptive rather than experimental science: Thompson did not articulate his insights in the form of hypotheses that can be tested. He was aware of this, saying that &quot;This book of mine has little need of preface, for indeed it is &#x27;all preface&#x27; from beginning to end.&quot;

==Editions==

The first edition appeared in 1917 in a single volume of 793 pages published by Cambridge University Press. A second edition, enlarged to 1116 pages, was published in two volumes in 1942. Thompson wrote in the preface to the 1942 edition that he had written &quot;this book in wartime, and its revision has employed me during another war. It gave me solace and occupation, when service was debarred me by my years. Few are left of the friends who helped me write it.&quot; An edition of 346 pages was abridged by John Tyler Bonner, and is widely published under the same title. The book, often in the abridged edition, has been reprinted more than 40 times, and has been translated into Chinese, French, German, Greek, Italian, and Spanish.

==Contents==

The contents of the chapters in the first edition are summarized below. All but Chapter 11 have the same titles in the second edition, but many are longer, as indicated by the page numbering of the start of each chapter. Bonner&#x27;s abridgment shortened all the chapters, and removed some completely, again as indicated at the start of each chapter&#x27;s entry below.

===1. Introductory===

(1st edition p. 1 – 2nd edition p. 1 – Bonner p. 1)
:: Thompson names the progress of chemistry towards Kant&#x27;s goal of a mathematical science able to explain reactions by molecular mechanics, and points out that zoology has been slow to look to mathematics. He agrees that zoologists rightly seek for reasons in animals&#x27; adaptations, and reminds readers of the related but far older philosophical search for teleology, explanation by some Aristotelian final cause. His analysis of &quot;growth and form&quot; will try to show how these can be explained with ordinary physical laws.

=== 2. On Magnitude ===
(1st p. 16 – 2nd p. 22 – Bonner p. 15)
:: Thompson begins by showing that an animal&#x27;s surface and volume (or weight) increase with the square and cube of its length, respectively, and deducing simple rules for how bodies will change with size. He shows in a few short equations that the speed of a fish or ship rises with the square root of its length. He then derives the slightly more complex scaling laws for birds or aircraft in flight. He shows that an organism thousands of times smaller than a bacterium is essentially impossible.

===3. The Rate of Growth ===

(1st p. 50 – 2nd p. 78 – Bonner removed)
:: Thompson points out that all changes of form are phenomena of growth. He analyses growth curves for man, noting rapid growth before birth and again in the teens; and then curves for other animals. In plants, growth is often in pulses, as in &quot;Spirogyra&quot;, peaks at a specific temperature, and below that value roughly doubles every 10 degrees Celsius. Tree growth varies cyclically with season (less strongly in evergreens), preserving a record of historic climates. Tadpole tails regenerate rapidly at first, slowing exponentially.

===4. On the Internal Form and Structure of the Cell===

(1st p. 156 – 2nd p. 286 – Bonner removed)
::Thompson argues for the need to study cells with physical methods, as morphology alone had little explanatory value. He notes that in mitosis the dividing cells look like iron filings between the poles of a magnet, in other words like a force field.

===5. The Forms of Cells===
(1st p. 201 – 2nd p. 346 – Bonner p. 49)
::He considers the forces such as surface tension acting on cells, and Plateau&#x27;s experiments on soap films. He illustrates the way a splash breaks into droplets and compares this to the shapes of Campanularian zoophytes (Hydrozoa). He looks at the flask-like shapes of single-celled organisms such as species of &quot;Vorticella&quot;, considering teleological and physical explanations of their having minimal areas; and at the hanging drop shapes of some Foraminifera such as &quot;Lagena&quot;. He argues that the cells of trypanosomes are similarly shaped by surface tension.

===6. A Note on Adsorption===

(1st p. 277 – 2nd p. 444 – Bonner removed)
::Thompson notes that surface tension in living cells is reduced by substances resembling oils and soaps; where the concentrations of these vary locally, the shapes of cells are affected. In the green alga &quot;Pleurocarpus&quot; (Zygnematales), potassium is concentrated near growing points in the cell.

===7. The Forms of Tissues, or Cell-aggregates===

(1st p. 293 – 2nd p. 465 – Bonner p. 88)
::Thompson observes that in multicellular organisms, cells influence each other&#x27;s shapes with triangles of forces. He analyses parenchyma and the cells in a frog&#x27;s egg as soap films, and considers the symmetries bubbles meeting at points and edges. He compares the shapes of living and fossil corals such as &quot;Cyathophyllum&quot; and &quot;Comoseris&quot;, and the hexagonal structure of honeycomb, to such soap bubble structures.

===8. The same (continued)===
(1st p. 346 – 2nd p. 566 – Bonner merged with previous chapter)
::Thompson considers the laws governing the shapes of cells, at least in simple cases such as the fine hairs (a cell thick) in the rhizoids of mosses. He analyses the geometry of cells in a frog&#x27;s egg when it has divided into 4, 8 and even 64 cells. He shows that uniform growth can lead to unequal cell sizes, and argues that the way cells divide is driven by the shape of the dividing structure (and not vice versa).

===9. On Concretions, Spicules, and Spicular Skeletons===
(1st p. 411 – 2nd p. 645 – Bonner p. 132)
::Thompson considers the skeletal structures of diatoms, radiolarians, foraminifera and sponges, many of which contain hard spicules with geometric shapes. He notes that these structures form outside living cells, so that physical forces must be involved.

===10. A Parenthetic Note on Geodetics===
(1st p. 488 – 2nd p. 741 – Bonner removed)
::Thompson applies the use of the geodetic line, &quot;the shortest distance between two points on the surface of a solid of revolution&quot;, to the spiral thickening of plant cell walls and other cases.

===11. The Logarithmic Spiral [&#x27;The Equiangular Spiral&#x27; in 2nd Ed.]===
(1st p. 493 – 2nd p. 748 – Bonner p. 172)
::Thompson observes that there are many spirals in nature, from the horns of ruminants to the shells of molluscs; other spirals are found among the florets of the sunflower. He notes that the mathematics of these are similar but the biology differs. He describes the spiral of Archimedes before moving on to the logarithmic spiral, which has the property of never changing its shape: it is equiangular and is continually self-similar. Shells as diverse as &quot;Haliotis&quot;, &quot;Triton&quot;, &quot;Terebra&quot; and &quot;Nautilus&quot; (illustrated with a halved shell and a radiograph) have this property; different shapes are generated by sweeping out curves (or arbitrary shapes) by rotation, and if desired also by moving downwards. Thompson analyses both living molluscs and fossils such as ammonites.

===12. The Spiral Shells of the Foraminifera===
(1st p. 587 – 2nd p. 850 – Bonner merged with previous chapter)
::Thompson analyses diverse forms of minute spiral shells of the foraminifera, many of which are logarithmic, others irregular, in a manner similar to the previous chapter.

===13. The Shapes of Horns, and of Teeth or Tusks: with A Note on Torsion===

(1st p. 612 – 2nd p. 874 – Bonner p. 202)
::Thompson considers the three types of horn that occur in quadrupeds: the keratin horn of the rhinoceros; the paired horns of sheep or goats; and the bony antlers of deer.
:: In a note on torsion, Thompson mentions Charles Darwin&#x27;s treatment of climbing plants which often spiral around a support, noting that Darwin also observed that the spiralling stems were themselves twisted. Thompson disagrees with Darwin&#x27;s teleological explanation, that the twisting makes the stems stiffer in the same way as the twisting of a rope; Thompson&#x27;s view is that the mechanical adhesion of the climbing stem to the support sets up a system of forces which act as a &#x27;couple&#x27; offset from the centre of the stem, making it twist.

===14. On Leaf-arrangement, or Phyllotaxis===

(1st p. 635 – 2nd p. 912 – Bonner removed)
::Thompson analyses phyllotaxis, the arrangement of plant parts around an axis. He notes that such parts include leaves around a stem; fir cones made of scales; sunflower florets forming an elaborate crisscrossing pattern of different spirals (parastichies). He recognises their beauty but dismisses any mystical notions; instead he remarks that

The numbers that result from such spiral arrangements are the Fibonacci sequence of ratios 1/2, 2/3, 3.5 ... converging on 0.61803..., the golden ratio which is

===15. On the Shapes of Eggs, and of certain other Hollow Structures===
(1st p. 652 – 2nd p. 934 – Bonner removed)
::Eggs are what Thompson calls simple solids of revolution, varying from the nearly spherical eggs of owls through more typical ovoid eggs like chickens, to the markedly pointed eggs of cliff-nesting birds like the guillemot. He shows that the shape of the egg favours its movement along the oviduct, a gentle pressure on the trailing end sufficing to push it forwards. Similarly, sea urchin shells have teardrop shapes, such as would be taken up by a flexible bag of liquid.

===16. On Form and Mechanical Efficiency===

(1st p. 670 – 2nd p. 958 – Bonner p. 221)
::Thompson criticizes talk of adaptation by coloration in animals for presumed purposes of crypsis, warning and mimicry (referring readers to E. B. Poulton&#x27;s &quot;The Colours of Animals&quot;, and more sceptically to Abbott Thayer&#x27;s &quot;Concealing-coloration in the Animal Kingdom&quot;). He considers the mechanical engineering of bone to be a far more definite case. He compares the strength of bone and wood to materials such as steel and cast iron; illustrates the &quot;cancellous&quot; structure of the bone of the human femur with thin trabeculae which formed &quot;nothing more nor less than a diagram of the lines of stress ... in the loaded structure&quot;, and compares the femur to the head of a building crane. He similarly compares the cantilevered backbone of a quadruped or dinosaur to the girder structure of the Forth Railway Bridge.

===17. On the Theory of Transformations, or the Comparison of Related Forms===
(1st p. 719 – 2nd p. 1026 – Bonner p. 268)
::Inspired by the work of Albrecht Dürer, Thompson explores how the forms of organisms and their parts, whether leaves, the bones of the foot, human faces or the body shapes of copepods, crabs or fish, can be explained by geometrical transformations. For example:


::In similar style he transforms the shape of the carapace of the crab &quot;Geryon&quot; variously to that of &quot;Corystes&quot; by a simple shear mapping, and to &quot;Scyramathia&quot;, &quot;Paralomis&quot;, &quot;Lupa&quot;, and &quot;Chorinus&quot; (Pisinae) by stretching the top or bottom of the grid sideways. The same process changes &quot;Crocodilus porosus&quot; to &quot;Crocodilus americanus&quot; and &quot;Notosuchus terrestris&quot;; relates the hip-bones of fossil reptiles and birds such as &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; and &quot;Apatornis&quot;; the skulls of various fossil horses, and even the skulls of a horse and a rabbit. A human skull is stretched into those of the chimpanzee and baboon, and with &quot;the mode of deformation .. on different lines&quot; (page 773), of a dog.

===Epilogue===
(1st p. 778 – 2nd p. 1093 – Bonner p. 326)

::In the brief epilogue, Thompson writes that he will have succeeded &quot;if I have been able to shew [the morphologist] that a certain mathematical aspect of morphology ... is ... complementary to his descriptive task, and helpful, nay essential, to his proper study and comprehension of Form.&quot; More lyrically, he writes that &quot;For the harmony of the world is made manifest in Form and Number, and the heart and soul and all the poetry of Natural Philosophy are embodied in the concept of mathematical beauty&quot; and quotes Isaiah 40:12 on measuring out the waters and heavens and the dust of the earth. He ends with a paragraph praising the French entomologist Jean-Henri Fabre who &quot;being of the same blood and marrow with Plato and Pythagoras, saw in Number &#x27;la clef de voute&#x27; [the key to the vault (of the universe)] and found in it &#x27;le comment et le pourquoi des choses&#x27; [the how and the why of things]&quot;.

==Reception==

=== Contemporary ===

&quot;J. P. McM[urrich]&quot;, reviewing the book in &quot;Science&quot; in 1917, wrote that &quot;the book is one of the strongest documents in support of the mechanistic view of life that has yet been put forth&quot;, contrasting this with &quot;vitalism&quot;. The reviewer was interested in the &quot;discussion of the physical factors determining the size of organisms, especially interesting being the consideration of the conditions which may determine the minimum size&quot;.

J. W. Buchanan, reviewing the second edition in &quot;Physiological Zoology&quot; in 1943, described it as &quot;an imposing extension of his earlier attempt to formulate a geometry of Growth and Form&quot; and &quot;beautifully written&quot;, but warned that &quot;the reading will not be easy&quot; and that &quot;A vast store of literature has here been assembled and assimilated&quot;. Buchanan summarizes the book, and notes that Chapter 17 &quot;seems to the reviewer to contain the essence of the long and more or less leisurely thesis... The chapter is devoted to comparison of related forms, largely by the method of co-ordinates. Fundamental differences in these forms are thus revealed&quot;, and Buchanan concludes that the large &quot;gaps&quot; indicate that Darwin&#x27;s endless series of continuous variations is not substantiated. But he does have some criticisms: Thompson should have referenced the effects of hormones on growth; and the relation of molecular configuration and form; genetics is barely mentioned, and experimental embryology and regeneration [despite Thompson&#x27;s analysis of the latter] are overlooked. The mathematics used consists of statistics and geometry, while thermodynamics is &quot;largely absent&quot;.

Edmund Mayer, reviewing the second edition in &quot;The Anatomical Record&quot; in 1943, noted that the &quot;scope of the book and the general approach to the problems dealt with have remained unchanged, but considerable additions have been made and large parts have been recast&quot;. He was impressed at the extent to which Thompson had kept up with developments in many sciences, though he thought the mentions of quantum theory and Heisenberg uncertainty unwise.

George C. Williams, reviewing the 1942 edition and Bonner&#x27;s abridged edition for the &quot;Quarterly Review of Biology&quot; (of which he was the editor), writes that the book is &quot;a work widely praised, but seldom used. It contains neither original insights
that have formed a basis for later advances nor instructive fallacies that have stimulated fruitful attack. This seeming paradox is brilliantly discussed by P. B. Medawar [in] &quot;Pluto&#x27;s Republic&quot;.&quot; Williams then attempts a &quot;gross simplification&quot; of Medawar&#x27;s evaluation:

=== Modern ===

The architects Philip Beesley and Sarah Bonnemaison write that Thompson&#x27;s book at once became a classic &quot;for its exploration of natural geometries in the dynamics of growth and physical processes.&quot; They note the &quot;extraordinary optimism&quot; in the book, its vision of the world as &quot;a symphony of harmonious forces&quot;, and its huge range, including:

Beesley and Bonnemaison observe that Thompson saw form &quot;as a product of dynamic forces .. shaped by flows of energy and stages of growth.&quot; They praise his &quot;eloquent writing and exquisite illustrations&quot; which have provided inspiration for artists and architects as well as scientists.

The statistician Cosma Shalizi writes that the book &quot;has haunted all discussion of these matters ever since.&quot;

Shalizi states that Thompson&#x27;s goal is to show that biology follows inevitably from physics, and to a degree also from chemistry. He argues that when Thompson says &quot;the form of an object is a &#x27;diagram of forces&#x27;&quot;, Thompson means that we can infer from an object the physical forces that act (or once acted) upon it. Shalizi calls Thompson&#x27;s account of the physics of morphogenesis

Shalizi notes Thompson&#x27;s simplicity, explaining the processes of life &quot;using little that a second-year physics undergrad wouldn&#x27;t know. (Thompson&#x27;s anti-reductionist admirers seldom put it this way.)&quot;. He notes that Thompson deliberately avoided invoking natural selection as an explanation, and left history, whether of species or of an individual&#x27;s life, out of his account. He quotes Thompson&#x27;s &quot;A snow-crystal is the same today as when the first snows fell&quot;: adding &quot;so, too, the basic forces acting upon organisms&quot;, and comments that we have forgotten other early twentieth century scientists who scorned evolution. In contrast, he argues,

The anthropologist Barry Bogin writes that Thompson&#x27;s book

Bogin observes that Thompson originated the use of transformational grids to measure growth in two dimensions, but that without modern computers the method was tedious to apply and was not often used. Even so, the book stimulated and lent intellectual validity to the new field of growth and development research.

Peter Coates recalls that

Coates argues however that the book goes far beyond expressing knowledge elegantly and influentially, in a form &quot;that can be read for pleasure by scientists and nonscientists&quot;; it is in his view

The science writer Philip Ball observes that

Ball quotes the 2nd Edition&#x27;s epigraph by the statistician Karl Pearson: &quot;I believe the day must come when the biologist will—without being a mathematician—not hesitate to use mathematical analysis when he requires it.&quot; Ball argues that Thompson &quot;presents mathematical principles as a shaping agency that may supersede natural selection, showing how the structures of the living world often echo those in inorganic nature&quot;, and notes his &quot;frustration at the &#x27;Just So&#x27; explanations of morphology offered by Darwinians.&quot; Instead, Ball argues, Thompson elaborates on how not heredity but physical forces govern biological form. Ball suggests that &quot;The book&#x27;s central motif is the logarithmic spiral&quot;, evidence in Thompson&#x27;s eyes of the universality of form and the reduction of many phenomena to a few principles of mathematics.

The philosopher of biology Michael Ruse wrote that Thompson &quot;had little time for natural selection.&quot; Instead, Thompson emphasised &quot;the formal aspects of organisms&quot;, trying to make a case for self-organization through normal physical and chemical processes. Ruse notes that, following Aristotle, Thompson used as an example the morphology of jellyfish, which he explained entirely mechanically with the physics of a heavy liquid falling through a lighter liquid, avoiding natural selection as an explanation. Ruse is not sure whether Thompson believed he was actually breaking with &quot;mechanism&quot;, in other words adopting a vitalist (ghost in the machine) view of the world. In Ruse&#x27;s opinion, Thompson can be interpreted as arguing that &quot;we can have completely mechanical explanations of the living world&quot; – with the important proviso that Thompson apparently felt there was no need for natural selection. Ruse at once adds that &quot;people like Darwin and Dawkins undoubtedly would disagree&quot;; they would insist that

==Influence==

For his revised &quot;On Growth and Form&quot;, Thompson was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1942.

&quot;On Growth and Form&quot; has inspired thinkers including the biologists Julian Huxley and Conrad Hal Waddington, the mathematician Alan Turing and the anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss. The book has powerfully influenced architecture and has long been a set text on architecture courses.

&quot;On Growth and Form&quot; has inspired artists including Richard Hamilton, Eduardo Paolozzi, and Ben Nicholson. In 2011 the University of Dundee was awarded a £100,000 grant by The Art Fund to build a collection of art inspired by his ideas and collections, much of which is displayed in the D&#x27;Arcy Thompson Zoology Museum in Dundee.

To celebrate the centenary of &quot;On Growth and Form&quot; numerous events were staged around the world, including New York, Amsterdam, Singapore, London, Edinburgh, St Andrews and in Dundee where the book was written. The &quot;On Growth and Form 100&quot; website was set up in late 2016 to map all of this activity.

<text>[[Count]] Stanisław Kostka Potocki (; November 1755 – 14 September 1821) was a Polish nobleman, politician, writer, public intellectual, and patron of the arts. He was involved in public education and active in the period that has been termed as the Polish Enlightenment. 

==Life==
Potocki was a son of General and starost of Lwów, Eustace Potocki and Anna Kątska, and was a brother of Ignacy Potocki. Other brothers included Jerzy Michał Potocki and Jan Nepomucen Eryk. They were taken care of by the state after the death of their parents in 1768. The boys were educated at the Collegium Nobilium in Warsaw and in 1772 Stanisław went to the military academy in Turin. He travelled through Europe and on returning, he married Princess Aleksandra Lubomirska, the daughter of Great Marshal of the Crown, Prince Stanisław Lubomirski, on 2 June 1776. His brother Ignacy was married to Elżbieta, the sister of Aleksandra. The couples lived in Olesin near Pulawy. 

He visited Rome in 1780, where he was painted by Jacques-Louis David. He was an alumnus of the Collegium Nobilium in Warsaw, and later studied Polonistics, literature and arts in Wilanów. He became Great Podstoli of the Crown in 1781–1784. He began to construct a new palace in Kurów and reconstructed the palace in Leszno. In 1784 he became head of the Polish Freemasonry. He was persuaded to be a witness during the Dogrum affair (1784-85) but found the process unfair and moved to Carlsbad to rest. He also travelled in Italy, collecting artworks. In 1786 he ran for parliamentary elections for Sejm. In 1792, he became an Artillery General of the Crown and participated in the War in Defense of the Constitution. He was a deputy of Lublin and one of the leaders of the Patriotic Party on the Four-Year Sejm. He served briefly in the war with Russia in 1792 and then went to live in Saxony. He was expelled from Dresden in 1794 and imprisoned by the Austrian police. He was released in 1795 and he went to Italy.

Potocki was a co-founder of the Society of Friends of Science (&quot;Towarzystwo Przyjaciół Nauk&quot;, &quot;or TPN&quot;) in Warsaw in 1800. From 1807 he was a member of the Governing Commission (&quot;Komisja Rządząca&quot;), chairman of the Education Chamber (&quot;Izba Edukacyjna&quot;), and from 1810 director of the Commission of National Education (&quot;Komisja Edukacji Narodowej&quot;) in the Duchy of Warsaw.

In 1809 he became chairman of the Council of State (&quot;Rada Stanu&quot;) and the Council of Ministers (&quot;Rada Ministrów&quot;). In 1818–20 he was chairman of the Senate.

Potocki organized archaeological excavations in Italy, inter alia in Laurentum in 1779 and Nola in 1785–1786. He collected art, mainly paintings, graphics and antique ceramics. His collection exhibited in Wilanów in 1805, initiating one of the first museums in Poland.

Potocki died on 14 September 1821 and was buried in the church of Wilanów.

<doc id="1319473" wikidata="Q7760242" url="?curid=1319473" title="The Republican Noise Machine">
<text>The Republican Noise Machine: Right-Wing Media and How It Corrupts Democracy is a 2004 book written by David Brock which chronicles how the American right wing was able to build its media infrastructure, and the tactics used by right-wing groups to pressure the media and spread misinformation to the public. The book was the prelude to Brock&#x27;s launching of his organization Media Matters for America.

==Author==

David Brock authored &quot;The Real Anita Hill&quot; in 1993, and had a hand in many other political books, including examinations of Bill and Hillary Clinton. He has said that his previous work was lies and distortions and disavowed his previous attacks he calls a smear campaign funded by wealthy right wing groups. His book &quot;Blinded By The Right: The Conscience Of An Ex-Conservative&quot; was a 2002 best-seller.

==Summary==
Brock details the conservative media strategy subsequent to the time of Barry Goldwater, predicated on corporate funding of think tanks, such as The Heritage Foundation. Brock believes such think tanks serve not only as propagandists, but as tutors for industry lobbyists, and a training ground for conservative journalists who are not limited by the standards of objectivity and impartiality emphasized in the conventional news media.

According to Brock, conservative and Republican strategists &quot;concoct smears, distortions, and outright lies&quot;, and then disseminate the product as &#x27;talking points&#x27; to right-wing radio and Fox News, which Brock says set a narrative echoed by more mainstream news sources.

In an article published in &quot;Salon&quot;, Brock describes his involvement in a “Republican Noise Machine&quot;, by recounting that “[f]rom the &quot;Washington Times&quot;, to a stint as a &#x27;research fellow&#x27; at the Heritage Foundation (the Right’s premier think tank), to a position as an &#x27;investigative writer&#x27; at the muckraking magazine &quot;The American Spectator&quot;, and as the author of a best-selling right-wing book, I forwarded the right-wing agenda not as an open political operative or advocate but under the guise of journalism and punditry, fueled by huge sums of money from right-wing billionaires, foundations, and self-interested corporations.”

This school later developed into the Otsuma Girls&#x27; Middle and High Schools and Otsuma Women&#x27;s University and Junior College.

In 1952 she founded the Kozan Art and Craft High School and remained its head until her death.

Otsuma died on January 3, 1970.

Otsuma is widely regarded as one of the pioneers of women&#x27;s education in Japan, even though the curricula of her schools emphasized home economics and traditional social values. Her connections to the Imperial Palace and her active support of the militaristic government led to her being investigated after the Pacific War, but no action was taken. Conversely, her contributions to Japanese education were recognized by the following Imperial Awards:

*1954　Medal with Blue Ribbon (藍綬褒章, &quot;ranjuhōshō&quot;)
*1964　Order of the Precious Crown, Butterfly (宝冠白蝶章, &quot;hōkanshirochōshō&quot;)
*1970　Order of the Sacred Treasure, Gold and Silver Star (瑞宝重光章, &quot;zuihōjūkōshō&quot;)

In 2002 she was posthumously made an Honorary Citizen of Kozan Town.

<doc id="1319481" wikidata="Q7759555" url="?curid=1319481" title="The Real Anita Hill">
<text>The Real Anita Hill is a controversial 1993 book written and now disavowed by David Brock in which the author claimed to reveal the &quot;true motives&quot; that he has revealed he fabricated of Anita Hill, who had accused Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment during his 1991 confirmation hearings.

==Background==
In March 1992, Brock had authored a sharply critical story about Hill in &quot;The American Spectator&quot; magazine which became the nucleus of the book, &quot;The Real Anita Hill&quot;. It was positively reviewed by several people, including George Will in &quot;Newsweek&quot;, Jonathan Groner, then-associate editor of &quot;Legal Times&quot;, in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; (&quot;a serious work of investigative journalism&quot;), and by Christopher Lehmann-Haupt of &quot;The New York Times&quot; (&quot;carefully reasoned and powerful in its logic&quot;). Excerpts were also printed in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;. It was negatively reviewed by Jane Mayer and Jill Abramson in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Anna Quindlen in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Dierdre English in &quot;The Nation&quot;, and Anthony Lewis in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, as well as Molly Ivins, and Ellen Goodman.

==Legacy==
Brock now describes the book as a &quot;character assassination&quot; and has since &quot;disavowed its premise&quot;. He has also apologized to Hill. In his subsequent book, &quot;Blinded by the Right&quot;, Brock characterized himself as having been &quot;a witting cog in the Republican sleaze machine.&quot;

<doc id="1319487" wikidata="Q27657104" url="?curid=1319487" title="The Seduction of Hillary Rodham">
<text>The Seduction of Hillary Rodham is a 1996 book about the early years of Hillary Rodham Clinton written by once-conservative writer, later-liberal media watch dog and Clintons supporter David Brock. The book was written during the advent of Brock&#x27;s political evolution, thus contains a mixed ideological viewpoint.

==Background==
After the commercial and received-ideological success of &quot;The Real Anita Hill&quot;, Brock&#x27;s first book, The Free Press paid Brock a large advance to write a book about Hillary Rodham Clinton. That amount has been stated as $1 million by Brock in his 2002 memoir &quot;Blinded by the Right&quot;.

In that volume, Brock claimed that he was pushed into the book assignment by what his publisher and agent wanted, but in any case, the clear expectation was that it would be a takedown in the style of his writings on Anita Hill and Bill Clinton. To fulfill this goal, Brock hired what he has termed a &quot;small brigade of researchers&quot; to assist him.

==The turn==
The project, however, took a different turn, and the resulting book, &quot;The Seduction of Hillary Rodham&quot;, proved to be largely sympathetic to Hillary Clinton, causing surprise within the publishing industry. Having received the large advance and a tight one-year deadline from Simon &amp; Schuster&#x27;s then-conservatively focused Free Press subsidiary, Brock was under tremendous pressure to produce another bestseller. However, the book contained no major scoops. In &quot;Blinded by the Right&quot;, Brock said that he had reached a turning point; he had thoroughly examined charges against the Clintons, could not find any evidence of wrongdoing, and did not want to make any more misleading claims.

==Content==
The titles of the chapters of the book illustrate some of its themes:

# Hillary for President 
# A Seminar for Radicals
# Love and Squalor
# Stranger in a Strange Land 
# Alinsky&#x27;s Daughter 
# The Real Comeback Kid
# Joan of Arkansas
# Wifewater?
# Partners for Life
# Damage Control
# Rodham Rides Again
# Charge of the Light Brigade 
# The Revenge of the Ozarks

The book was generally hostile towards Bill Clinton, including the inclusion of coverage about his new numerous supposed (at that time) affairs. As &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Clearly the President is the seducer of the title -- Mr. Brock quotes a former White House aide, David Watkins, calling Bill Clinton &quot;the greatest seducer who ever lived&quot; -- and to the degree Hillary Clinton has been forced to compromise the high moral and ethical standards she brought both to their political partnership and their marriage, Mr. Brock blames Bill Clinton. Indeed, his characterization of the President is consistently scathing, at times approaching an &quot;ad hominem&quot; attack.&quot;

==Critical reaction==
When the book came out, it was widely criticized for not breaking any new ground. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;[e]xhaustive to the point of exhaustion&quot; and &quot;predictably critical, but unexpectedly measured, at least in comparison to what Beltway gossips anticipated.&quot; James B. Stewart for &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that Brock had &quot;tried to do his subject justice in the broadest sense&quot;, but added that &quot;[a]t times he goes too far,&quot; often &quot;echo[ing] her apologists&quot; and &quot;dismiss[ing] or rationaliz[ing] the sometimes powerful evidence that Hillary Rodham Clinton has lied...by invoking a relativism rooted in Republican precedents.&quot;

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the book a &#x27;D&#x27; (poor but not a complete failure) and said, &quot;What could have actually been a rather poignant biography of a fascinating woman is marred by Brock&#x27;s heavy reliance on previously published accounts, his leaden prose, the constant sense that he&#x27;s proselytizing against Bill Clinton, and his naïveté about marriages in general and presidential ones in particular.&quot; Writing for the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot;, Garry Wills assayed that Brock&#x27;s goal was to establish a premise of a President Clinton becoming into a state of being out of control with unrestrained power going into his second term in office.

Brock said that his former friends in right-wing politics shunned him because &quot;Seduction&quot; did not adequately attack the Clintons. Jonah Goldberg of &quot;National Review&quot; proposed another theory: Since &quot;no liberal source in the world would talk to Brock,&quot; he could not collect the kind of information he was after. Goldberg also maintained that while writing the book, Brock had been &quot;seduced&quot; by Sidney Blumenthal, a prominent champion and friend of the Clinton circle. Blumenthal would remain the subject of intense attention from anti-Clintonites two decades later.

==Sales==
Free Press had a first printing of 300,000 copies of the book, which per &quot;The Washington Post&quot; represented three times the sales of Brock&#x27;s commercially successful job on Anita Hill. 
Instead, &quot;The Seduction of Hillary Rodham&quot; sold very poorly; the &quot;Post&quot; characterized it as &quot;a disaster&quot;. To illustrate, the paper reported that a Washington bookstore had only sold eight out of 30 ordered copies and a Baltimore bookstore only three out of 50. Brock has said the book sold less than half of what the Anita Hill book had, which given the &quot;Post&quot;&#x27; estimate would mean &quot;Seduction&quot; sold less than 50,000 copies.

Considering the large printing, large advance, and far-under-expectations sales, Brock has said that the book was in the fact of the matter a &quot;commercial disaster&quot;.

<doc id="1319491" wikidata="Q313703" url="?curid=1319491" title="Takeshi Obata">
<text>is a Japanese manga artist that usually works as the illustrator in collaboration with a writer. He first gained international attention for &quot;Hikaru no Go&quot; (1999–2003) with Yumi Hotta, but is better known for &quot;Death Note&quot; (2003–2006) and &quot;Bakuman&quot; (2008–2012) with Tsugumi Ohba. Obata has mentored several well-known manga artists, including Nobuhiro Watsuki of &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; fame, &quot;Black Cat&quot; creator Kentaro Yabuki, and &quot;Eyeshield 21&quot; artist Yusuke Murata.

==Career==
Takeshi Obata chose to be a manga artist because he always loved drawing. As a child he re-read Shotaro Ishinomori&#x27;s &quot;Cyborg 009&quot; over and over. His first published manga was in Higashi-Yamanoshita Elementary&#x27;s school newspaper when he was in the third grade. It was about a hero who turned into a disposable pocket warmer when in trouble. Obata originally became noticed in 1985 when he took a prize in the Tezuka Award for his one-shot &quot;500 Kōnen no Shinwa&quot;. Joining the &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; staff, he mentored under Makoto Niwano before starting his first major series, writing and drawing &quot;Cyborg Jii-chan G&quot; in 1989. After this series, Obata began collaborating with other writers.

&quot;Sakon, the Ventriloquist&quot;, with author Sharakumaro, became his first work to be adapted into an anime. He then created &quot;Hikaru no Go&quot; with Yumi Hotta, which received the 1999 Shogakukan Manga Award and the 2003 Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize. With 25 million collected volumes in circulation, it was adapted into an anime and became his first work to be released in North America.

In 2003 he teamed up with Tsugumi Ohba to create &quot;Death Note&quot;. It became his biggest hit to date, with 30 million copies in circulation, an anime adaptation, five live-action films, two live-action TV drama and a musical. Obata served as the artist of &quot;Blue Dragon Ral Grad&quot;, a manga adaptation of the fantasy video game &quot;Blue Dragon&quot;, from December 2006 to July 2007.

In the fall of 2007, he drew the short story &quot;Hello Baby&quot; with writer Masanori Morita, which appeared in &quot;Jump Square&quot;. This was followed a year later by &quot;Urōboe Uroboros!&quot; with Nisio Isin, who authored the &quot;Death Note Another Note: The Los Angeles BB Murder Cases&quot; novel.

He then reunited with Tsugumi Ohba for &quot;Bakuman.&quot;, which ran from August 2008 to April 2012. It was Shueisha&#x27;s first manga to be released online in multiple languages before becoming available in print outside Japan and had over 15 million copies in publication as of May 2014. In 2014, he drew a manga adaptation of &quot;All You Need Is Kill&quot; with Ryōsuke Takeuchi, basing the character designs on Yoshitoshi ABe&#x27;s original cover to the novel. He reunited with Nisio Isin for the one-shot &quot;RKD-EK9&quot;, that ran in the December 2014 issue of &quot;Jump Square&quot;.

Obata followed this by working with Nobuaki Enoki to relaunch Enoki&#x27;s &quot;School Judgment: Gakkyu Hotei&quot; digital one-shot as a serial in the first issue of &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; for 2015. However, the magazine stopped publishing it after the year&#x27;s 24th issue and the series finished in the digital &quot;Shōnen Jump+&quot; on May 27. It was serialized in English in the digital &quot;Weekly Shonen Jump&quot;.

From 2015 to 2021, Obata created another series with Ohba called &quot;Platinum End&quot;. Starting in the December 2015 issue of &quot;Jump Square&quot; on November 4, 2015, the manga ended on January 4, 2021. The series had over 4.5 million copies in circulation by December 2020, and an anime adaptation began airing on television in October 2021. In October 2021, Obata teamed up with novelist Akinari Asakura to start the &quot;owarai&quot;-themed manga series &quot;Show-ha Shoten!&quot; in the November issue of &quot;Jump Square&quot;.

In addition to his manga work, Obata has also done character design work for the video game &quot;Castlevania Judgment&quot;, as well as illustrating several light novels. He provided character designs for Madhouse&#x27;s anime adaptations of Osamu Dazai&#x27;s &quot;No Longer Human&quot; and Natsume Sōseki&#x27;s &quot;Kokoro&quot;, which are parts of the &quot;Aoi Bungaku&quot; series. He drew manga manuscripts seen in the 2015 live-action film adaptation of &quot;Bakuman&quot; that were later published in the &quot;Eiga Bakuman. Takeshi Obata Illustration Works&quot; book. He also designed a new CGI character for the 2016 &quot;Death Note: Light Up the New World&quot; live-action film. On May 3, 2016, Viz Media published Obata&#x27;s 2006 art book &quot;Blanc et Noir&quot; in North America.

==Personal life==
On September 6, 2006, Obata was arrested for illegal possession of an 8.6 cm knife when he was pulled over in Musashino, Tokyo for driving with his car&#x27;s headlights off at 12:30am. The artist claimed he kept the knife in his car for when he goes camping.

<doc id="1319503" wikidata="Q7845569" url="?curid=1319503" title="Troopergate (Bill Clinton)">
<text>Troopergate is the popular name for a political controversy that emerged in the 1990s in which several Arkansas State Troopers claimed that they had arranged sexual liaisons for Arkansas governor Bill Clinton during his time in office (1979–81, 1983–92) and had helped deceive his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton.

==Core allegations==

The allegations by state troopers Larry Patterson and Roger Perry were first reported by David Brock in the conservative magazine &quot;American Spectator&quot;, in a piece entitled &quot;His Cheatin&#x27; Heart&quot; that was released in December 1993 with a magazine publication date of January 1994. 
Brock had learned of the story from a major donor to GOPAC who connected him with Cliff Jackson, a longtime critic of Governor Clinton.
Brock&#x27;s story also included material from two other troopers who wished to remain unnamed. The same four troopers were also interviewed and their charges written about at length by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in a story published in December 1993 a day after the &quot;Spectator&quot; story came out. They also spoke on air to CNN in the same month.

The core allegations that the troopers made were that, while on official duty, they:

* Scouted women and asked them for their phone number to give to the governor;
* Secured motel rooms and other assignation points;
* Drove Clinton in state vehicles to these assignation points and kept watch while Clinton was inside;
* Lent Clinton their own state cars to make his escapes less noticeable;
* Delivered gifts to the women afterward; and
* Informed Clinton about where his wife was and lied to his wife about where he was.

The troopers said that these episodes involved dozens of women, from long-running mistresses to single encounters. As far as they were aware, all of the women involved had consented to the relationships and no alcohol abuse or drug abuse had been part of the encounters. One of the long-running mistresses was Gennifer Flowers, who had come forward with her tale of a 12-year relationship with the governor at the start of the Bill Clinton 1992 presidential campaign; this had caused an early crisis in that endeavor which Clinton and his wife had to address in a televised and much-discussed &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview.

As for the governor and his wife, Brock wrote that, &quot;As the troopers saw it, the Clintons&#x27; relationship is an effective political partnership, more a business relationship than a marriage.&quot;

==Context and response==
The troopers said that only a select few of their ranks were privy to the Clinton secrets; several other troopers confirmed that they had no knowledge of such goings-on. The troopers conceded that they were interested in writing a book about their story. Nevertheless, a representative of two of the troopers maintained that their purpose was not prurient: &quot;The issue was not his sexual proclivities. It was the abuse of power – the abuse of office that concerned them and concerned me.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; story included documentary evidence that backed up some of the troopers&#x27; allegations.

During the latter part of 1993, Clinton and other administration officials made a determined effort to keep the troopers from going public with their claims. Two of the troopers said they had been offered federal jobs via the Clinton administration if they would maintain their silence. But no such offers actually materialized. Thus among Patterson&#x27;s subsequent complaints was Clinton&#x27;s alleged later behavior: &quot;We lied for him and helped him cheat on his wife, and he treated us like dogs.&quot;

In response to the December 1993 trooper charges, Bruce Lindsey, who was a senior White House staffer, said: &quot;These allegations are ridiculous. Similar charges were made, investigated and responded to during the campaign. There is nothing that dignifies a further response.&quot; Lindsey said that Clinton had specifically denied the central points of the allegations. Regarding the specific question of whether troopers were offered jobs for silence, Lindsey said that Clinton had telephoned one of them, but &quot;any suggestion that the President offered anyone a job in return for silence is a lie.&quot;

==Jones lawsuit==
The Brock story had mentioned a woman named &quot;Paula&quot;, a reference to the then-unknown Paula Jones. This reference was cited by Paula Jones in her May 1994 sexual harassment lawsuit against President Clinton. According to Gennifer Flowers&#x27;s deposition in the suit, she claimed that Clinton told her to contact Larry Patterson or Roger Perry to communicate.

The lawsuit, &quot;Jones v. Clinton&quot;, was initially dismissed, whereupon Jones appealed. In 1998, Clinton settled with Jones for $850,000, the entire amount of her claim, but without an apology, in exchange for her agreement to drop the appeal. Meanwhile, the Jones matter had begun a chain of events that led to exposure and instantiation of the Lewinsky scandal. Thus, arguably, state-level Troopergate indirectly led to the federal Impeachment of Bill Clinton.

==Later developments with troopers==
Following Brock&#x27;s article, in 1994 four troopers conducted interviews with various allegations about Clinton and subsequently the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; stated that &quot;one of the troopers is an accused wife beater, another was caught sleeping on the job, a third pleaded guilty to starting a barroom brawl and a fourth allegedly slept with a fellow trooper&#x27;s wife.&quot;

Then in 1994 and 1995, Jerry Falwell paid $200,000 to Citizens for Honest Government, who in turn paid two Arkansas state troopers who had made allegations supporting a conspiracy about Vincent Foster in the &quot; Clinton Chronicles&quot; video. The two troopers, Roger Perry and Larry Patterson, also were paid after making their allegations in the Jones-Clinton trial.

Trooper Patterson, whose name would always be linked with the allegations, retired from the state force in 1999. In 2000 he was named the police chief of Quitman, Arkansas. In 2005, Patterson was convicted of making false statements to the FBI about an unrelated incident.

==Brock apology==
In a 1998 article for &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine, Brock said he wished he had never written the original &quot;Spectator&quot; story.
Following the admission, Brock publicly apologized to President Clinton for his Troopergate story, which he stated was written not &quot;in the interest of good government or serious journalism,&quot; but as part of an &quot;anti-Clinton crusade.&quot;

However, in his apology Brock did not say that anything in his 1993 article was specifically false: &quot;I&#x27;m saying that story was bad journalism, that I don&#x27;t stand by the story any more. I can&#x27;t point to anything specific ... [that] might be wrong.&quot; He said that both he and the troopers had had impure motivations.

In his 2002 book, &quot;Blinded by the Right&quot;, Brock claimed that in order to maintain journalistic integrity, he agreed to write the Troopergate article only if the four troopers whom he interviewed were not paid. In 1998, a conservative fundraiser, Peter W. Smith, admitted that he had set up a &quot;Troopergate Whistle Blower Fund&quot; to support the troopers and their legal fees. He also arranged for the troopers to give paid speeches. Smith says he eventually paid about $80,000 on the case, including a $5,000 payment to Brock. Brock says the trooper payments were made without his knowledge.

<text>The Arkansas Project was a series of investigative press reports, funded primarily by conservative businessman Richard Mellon Scaife, that focused on criticism of then-President Bill Clinton and his administration. Scaife spent nearly $2 million on the project.

The investigations included the investigation of the 1970s real estate investment that Bill and Hillary Clinton had made in a development known as Whitewater, re-opening of allegations that then Governor Bill Clinton had sexually harassed an Arkansas state employee, and a reexamination of the death of White House aide Vincent Foster which multiple official investigations had found to be a suicide.

==Background==
In the 1980s and 1990s, the politically conservative &quot;American Spectator&quot; magazine received donations from conservative benefactors. The Arkansas project began shortly after Richard Mellon Scaife, one of the largest donors to the magazine, directed that his donations be used for stories aimed at investigating potentially scandalous material regarding the Clintons. According to R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr., editor-in-chief of the &quot;Spectator&quot;, the idea for the Arkansas Project was hatched on a fishing trip on the Chesapeake Bay in the fall of 1993. The &quot;Arkansas Project&quot; name that later became famous was conceived as a joke; the actual name used within the &quot;Spectator&quot; and the Scaife foundation was the &quot;Editorial Improvement Project&quot;.

Project reporter/investigators were hired, including David Brock, who later described his role at that of as a Republican &quot;hitman&quot;, and Rex Armistead, a former police officer who was reportedly paid $350,000 for his efforts. Also assisting the project was Parker Dozhier, a bait shop owner who was reportedly obsessed with bringing down Bill Clinton. They were tasked with investigating the Clintons and uncovering stories tying the Clintons to murders and drug smuggling as well as adultery.

According to Brock, Armistead and Brock met at an airport hotel in Miami, Florida, in late 1993. There, Armistead laid out an elaborate &quot;Vince Foster murder scenario&quot;, a scenario that Brock later claimed was implausible. Regardless, by the end of 1993, Brock was writing stories for the Spectator that made him &quot;a lead figure in the drive to&quot; expose Clinton.

Ted Olson, who would later represent George W. Bush in &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot; and be named U.S. Solicitor General, was a board member of the American Spectator Educational Foundation, and is thought to have known about or played some role in the Arkansas Project. His firm Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher provided $14,000 worth of legal services, and he himself wrote or co-authored several articles that were paid for with Project funds. During Olson&#x27;s Senate confirmation hearing for Solicitor General, majority Republicans blocked Senator Patrick Leahy&#x27;s call for further committee inquiries on the subject of Olson&#x27;s ties to the Arkansas Project.

==News stories==
The investigations funded by Scaife money mostly concentrated on the Whitewater investments, which extended to a conspiracy theory surrounding the death of Vince Foster, a Clinton aide with connections to Whitewater. Christopher W. Ruddy, a reporter for the Scaife-owned &quot;Pittsburgh Tribune-Review&quot;, published a series of articles claiming Clinton was behind Foster&#x27;s suicide. Although Clinton was never found to have broken the law by Ken Starr, Ruddy published his book, &quot;The Strange Death of Vincent Foster&quot;, regardless. His conspiracy theories about Foster have since been dismissed even by some more outspoken conservatives like Ann Coulter. The &quot;Spectator&quot; stopped receiving Scaife funding when &quot;it ran a scathing review of [the] book ...&quot;

In late November 1997 after Jeff Corry&#x27;s review of Ruddy&#x27;s book was published, Reed Irvine of Accuracy in Media (who has received about $2 million from Scaife since 1977) &quot;reported in his newsletter that Scaife had called Tyrrell to say he was cutting him off.&quot; In fact, &quot;Tyrrell confirmed in an interview that the call occurred but said he couldn&#x27;t remember details of the conversation that ended all support from the man who had been his principal benefactor for nearly 30 years.&quot;

In 1999, Joseph Farah&#x27;s Western Journalism Center &quot;placed some 50 ads reprinting Ruddy&#x27;s &quot;Tribune-Review&quot; stories in &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, then repackaged the articles as a packet titled &#x27;The Ruddy Investigation,&#x27; which sold for $12.&quot; Shortly thereafter, the Western Journalism Center &quot;circulated a video featuring Ruddy&#x27;s claims, &#x27;Unanswered-The Death of Vincent Foster,&#x27; that was produced by author James Davidson, chairman of the National Taxpayers Union (NTU) and co-editor of the Strategic Investment newsletter.&quot;

In the late 1990s, Ruddy and Farah turned their focus to the internet with help from Scaife. Ruddy founded NewsMax and Farah started WorldNetDaily which report news from a conservative perspective. Eventually, Scaife became an investor and the third-largest stockholder of NewsMax.

==Paula Jones==
As an early part of the Troopergate matter, writer David Brock published an article, &quot;His Cheating Heart&quot; that refers to a liaison between Clinton and woman named Paula. This led to the Paula Jones affair and later led Jones to sue Clinton, successfully obtaining an out-of-court settlement in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Brock continued his conspiracy theorizing until a 1997 &quot;Esquire&quot; article titled &quot;I Was a Conservative Hit Man&quot; in which he recanted some of his claims. In 1998 he went further and personally apologized to Clinton. Brock was let go from the &quot;Spectator&quot; and published his 2002 book &quot;Blinded by the Right: The Conscience of an Ex-Conservative&quot;.

<text>Bush&#x27;s Brain: How Karl Rove Made George W. Bush Presidential is a book by James Moore and Wayne Slater that chronicles the political career of Karl Rove and the role he has played in the elections of George W. Bush, both when running for Governor of Texas and for president. It was published in 2003 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. .

In 2004, a documentary film was directed and produced by Joseph Mealey and Michael Paradies Shoob with the shortened title, &quot;Bush&#x27;s Brain&quot;. In that film, a series of political insiders of both major parties suggest that Karl Rove, President George W. Bush&#x27;s closest advisor, has almost single-handedly shaped United States executive branch policies, since the days when George W. Bush was running for Governor of Texas. The documentary film, available on DVD (DVD release date: February 15, 2005, run time: 80 minutes), is narrated by Jacques Vroom, Jr. and contains a soundtrack featuring the music of singer-songwriter political activist, Michelle Shocked.

Moore and Slater have followed up that book, after the 2004 Presidential election, with &quot;Rove Exposed: How Bush&#x27;s Brain Fooled America&quot; (2005) .

== Film ==

Filmed and narrated in the style of a detective story, the film investigates events that occurred during election.

In one of the film&#x27;s early scenes, the film contends that Karl Rove, with Republican Bill Clements as his client in a Texas gubernatorial race, contacted the FBI after finding a hidden microphone-transmitter in his office. Following the announcement of the bugging of Rove&#x27;s office, Bill Clements won the election over the Democratic incumbent, Mark White.

The film was narrated by Jacques Vroom, Jr. and full details, cast and crew can be found on IMDb.

===Reception===
On Metacritic, the film has a score of 48, indicating &quot;Mixed or average reviews.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the film three stars out of four.

<doc id="1319559" wikidata="Q7735330" url="?curid=1319559" title="The Frisk">
<text>The Frisk was an American punk rock band from Berkeley, California, formed by Jesse Luscious, Mike Sexxx and Zach Attack, all former members of The Criminals, along with AFI member Hunter Burgan, following The Criminals 2000 breakup. The Frisk issued two releases on Adeline Records before playing their final show in 2005.

==History==
The Frisk arose in early 2000, when the dissolution of The Criminals caused vocalist Jesse Luscious, bassist Mike Sexxx and guitarist Zach Attack to pursue drummer Hunter Burgan. For the former members of The Criminals, The Frisk proved to be a quick transition from their previous band together, while for Burgan the band would become an outlet in addition to his role as bassist for AFI, with whom he had been a member since 1997. Following the band&#x27;s first show, Zach Attack departed, with Zac Hunter of The Nerve Agents, taking his place on guitar.

In February 2001, The Frisk entered Nu-Tone Studios in Pittsburg, California to record what would become &quot;Rank Restraint&quot;, the bands&#x27; debut for Adeline Records, who had previously issued releases by both AFI and The Criminals. The primary songwriters were Luscious and Burgan, although &quot;Leech&quot; was co-written with Jesse Michaels. The recording would feature &quot;Know Your Rights&quot;, a song originally performed by The Clash. Following release, Mike Sexxx left The Frisk and was later replaced by bassist Hardcore Dan that fall. The band&#x27;s show scheduling became more sporadic as Burgans time was further occupied with AFI, supporting &quot;The Art of Drowning&quot; with several world tours. This caused The Frisk to acquire an additional drummer, Luke Swarm of Envain, for shows and touring when Burgan was unavailable.

However, in the spring of 2003 The Frisk recorded their follow up, &quot;Audio Ransom Note&quot;, and released it later that year on Adeline Records. Like the band&#x27;s previous release, most song writing credits would go to Luscious and Burgan. The album featured &quot;East Coast Funeral&quot;, a song written by Mike Sexxx, originally released on The Criminals posthumous EP &quot;Extinct&quot; in 2001. &quot;Audio Ransom Note&quot; was supported by shows that included appearances with the Dwarves, followed by several shows supporting Rancid, with Tiger Army and Nekromantix. In November, The Frisk embarked on a month-long US tour that featured numerous dates with Naked Aggression. In early 2004 the band completed a West Coast tour with Subhumans. Following the tour, Hardcore Dan was replaced with bassist Matt.

According to a March 15, 2004 post on the band&#x27;s official website, The Frisk started work on a new album, although due to the band members other commitments, this was put on hold. Luscious ran for office under his given name Jesse Townley for Berkeley City Council, while during the campaign his bandmates stayed busy with their other projects. Burgan was once again touring with AFI, who released their major label breakthrough album &quot;Sing the Sorrow&quot; the previous year. Zac Hunter was focusing his attention on his new band Shadowboxer.

These scheduling conflicts would eventually culminate in the breakup of The Frisk, yet the band managed to book two final shows in late 2005, when original bassist Mike Sexxx returned to resurrect the lineup from &quot;Rank Restraint&quot;. On November 25, 2005 The Frisk made their final Berkeley performance, appearing with Propagandhi at 924 Gilman Street, followed by their last show ever on December 2, 2005 at Burnt Ramen in Richmond, California with The Briefs and Thought Riot.

<doc id="1319561" wikidata="Q3305340" url="?curid=1319561" title="Propædia">
<text>The one-volume Propædia is the first of three parts of the 15th edition of &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, intended as a compendium and topical organization of the 12-volume &quot;Micropædia&quot; and the 17-volume &quot;Macropædia,&quot; which are organized alphabetically. Introduced in 1974 with the 15th edition, the &quot;Propædia&quot; and &quot;Micropædia&quot; were intended to replace the Index of the 14th edition; however, after widespread criticism, the &quot;Britannica&quot; restored the Index as a two-volume set in 1985. The core of the &quot;Propædia&quot; is its Outline of Knowledge, which seeks to provide a logical framework for all human knowledge. However, the &quot;Propædia&quot; also has several appendices listing the staff members, advisors and contributors to all three parts of the &quot;Britannica&quot;.

The last edition of the print &quot;Britannica&quot; was published in 2010.

== &quot;Outline of Knowledge&quot; ==

Like the &quot;Britannica&quot; as a whole, the &quot;Outline&quot; has three types of goals: 
*Epistemological: to provide a systematic, hierarchical categorization of all human knowledge, a 20th-century analog of the Great Chain of Being and Francis Bacon&#x27;s outline in &quot;Instauratio magna&quot;.
* Educational: to lay out a course of study for each major discipline, a &quot;roadmap&quot; for learning a whole field.
* Organizational: to serve as an expanded Table of Contents for the &quot;Micropædia&quot; and &quot;Macropædia&quot;.
According to Mortimer J. Adler, the designer of the &quot;Propædia&quot;, all articles in the full &quot;Britannica&quot; were designed to fit into the &quot;Outline of Knowledge&quot;.

The &quot;Outline&quot; has 167 sections, which are categorized into 41 divisions and then into 10 parts. Each part has an introductory essay written by the same individual responsible for developing the outline for that part, which was done in consultation and collaboration with a handful of other scholars. In all, 86 men and one woman were involved in developing the &quot;Outline of Knowledge&quot;.

The &quot;Outline&quot; was an eight-year project of Mortimer J. Adler, published 22 years after he published a similar effort (the &quot;Syntopicon&quot;) that attempts to provide an overview of the relationships among the &quot;Great Ideas&quot; in Adler&#x27;s &quot;Great Books of the Western World&quot; series. (The Great Books were also published by the Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.) Adler stresses in his book, &quot;A Guidebook to Learning: For a Lifelong Pursuit of Wisdom&quot;, that the ten categories should not be taken as hierarchical but as circular.

<doc id="1319571" wikidata="Q4586781" url="?curid=1319571" title="Royal peculiar">
<text>A royal peculiar is a Church of England parish or church exempt from the jurisdiction of the diocese and the province in which it lies, and subject to the direct jurisdiction of the monarch.

==Definition==
The church parish system dates from the early Middle Ages, when most early churches were provided by the lord whose estate land coincided with that of the parish. A donative parish (or &quot;peculiar&quot;) was one that was exempt from diocesan jurisdiction. There are several reasons for peculiars but usually they were held by a senior churchman from another district, parish or diocese, and gave livings (salaries or use of property) to those clergy chosen by the donor or donor&#x27;s heir. They could include the separate or &quot;peculiar&quot; jurisdiction of the monarch, another archbishop or bishop, or the dean and chapter of a cathedral (also, the Knights Templar and the Knights Hospitaller). An &quot;archbishop&#x27;s peculiar&quot; is subject to the direct jurisdiction of an archbishop and a &quot;royal peculiar&quot; is subject to the direct jurisdiction of the monarch.

Most peculiars survived the Reformation but, with the exception of royal peculiars, were finally abolished during the 19th century by various Acts of Parliament and became subject to the jurisdiction of the diocese in which they lay, although a few non-royal peculiars still exist. The majority of royal peculiars that remain are within the Diocese of London.

*The Collegiate Church of St Peter at Westminster, commonly known as Westminster Abbey, and containing the Henry VII Chapel, which is the chapel of the Order of the Bath.
*The chapels associated with the Chapel Royal, which refers not to a building but to an establishment in the Royal household, a body of priests and singers who explicitly serve the spiritual needs of the sovereign. Since the 18th century, because the Bishop of London is customarily appointed the Dean of the Chapel Royal, the bishop typically has authority of these chapels &quot;as dean&quot;, instead of &quot;as bishop&quot; even though they are geographically within the Diocese of London.
**The Chapel Royal, St James&#x27;s Palace
**The Queen&#x27;s Chapel, St James&#x27;s Palace
**The Chapel Royal, Hampton Court
**The Chapel of St John the Evangelist in the White Tower of the Tower of London
**The Chapel of St Peter ad Vincula in the Inner Ward of the Tower of London
**The King&#x27;s Chapel of the Savoy, inaugurated as a Chapel Royal in November 2016, is a private chapel of the sovereign in right of the Duchy of Lancaster. It is the chapel of the Royal Victorian Order. The number of members of the order in recent years has outgrown the available space in the Savoy Chapel so the service for those who have received awards is now held in St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, every four years.
*The Chapel of St Mary Undercroft, the crypt of the former St Stephen&#x27;s Chapel in the Palace of Westminster. The building is administered through the Lord Great Chamberlain and Black Rod and it has no dedicated clergy: by convention services were conducted by the Rector of St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster, a member of the Chapter of Westminster Abbey. In 2010, the Speaker of the House of Commons used his right of appointment of his Chaplain to nominate an outsider, the Revd Rose Hudson-Wilkin.
*The Royal Foundation of St Katharine founded in 1147 by Queen Matilda of England as a religious community and medieval hospital for poor infirm people next to the Tower of London
*Temple Church, built in the 1100s by the Knights Templar in the City of London

<text>Scattered, Smothered and Covered is a covers album by American rock band Hootie &amp; the Blowfish, released in 2000. The album was named in honor of Waffle House, a Southern restaurant chain. One of Waffle House&#x27;s advertising campaigns used the phrase &quot;scattered, smothered and covered,&quot; a reference to hash browns prepared with onions and cheese.

<doc id="1319587" wikidata="Q7990900" url="?curid=1319587" title="What's the Matter with Kansas? (book)">
<text>What&#x27;s the Matter with Kansas? How Conservatives Won the Heart of America (2004) is a book by American journalist and historian Thomas Frank, which explores the rise of populist and anti-elitist conservatism in the United States, centering on the experience of Kansas, Frank&#x27;s native state. In the late 19th century, says Frank, Kansas was known as a hotbed of the left-wing populist movement, but in recent decades, it has become overwhelmingly conservative. The book was published in Britain and Australia as &quot;What&#x27;s the Matter with America?&quot;

&quot;What&#x27;s the Matter with Kansas?&quot; spent 18 weeks on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Bestseller List.

==Overview==
According to the book, the political discourse of recent decades has dramatically shifted from social and economic equality to the use of &quot;explosive&quot; cultural issues, such as abortion and gay marriage, which are used to redirect anger toward &quot;liberal elites.&quot;

Against this backdrop, Frank describes the rise of political conservatism in the social and political landscape of Kansas, which he says espouses economic policies that do not benefit the majority of people in the state.

Frank also claims a bitter divide between &#x27;moderate&#x27; and &#x27;conservative&#x27; Kansas Republicans (whom he labels &quot;Mods&quot; and &quot;Cons&quot;) as an archetype for the future of politics in America, in which fiscal conservatism becomes the universal norm and political war is waged over a handful of hot-button cultural issues.

Instead of fighting for working class interests, the Democratic party, under the direction of the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), effectively abandoned them by adopting economically conservative policies. To differentiate themselves from Republicans at the national level, Democrats also focused on socio-cultural wedge issues:

The book also details how Kathleen Sebelius, a Democrat, was elected governor in conservative Kansas. By emphasizing issues such as health care and school funding and avoiding hot-button social issues, Sebelius successfully fractured the Kansas GOP and won a clear majority.

Frank says that the conservative coalition is the dominant coalition in American politics. There are two sides to this coalition, according to the author: Economic conservatives want business tax cuts and deregulation, while social conservatives focus on culture. Frank says that since the coalition formed in the late 1960s, the coalition has been &quot;fantastically rewarding&quot; for the economic conservatives. The policies of the Republicans in power have been exclusively economic, but the coalition has caused the social conservatives to be worse off economically, due to these pro-corporate policies. Meanwhile, the social issues that the &quot;Cons&quot; faction pushes never go anywhere after the election. According to Frank, &quot;abortion is never outlawed, school prayer never returns, the culture industry is never forced to clean up its act.&quot; He attributes this partly to conservatives &quot;waging cultural battles where victory is impossible,&quot; such as a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. He also argues that the very capitalist system the economic conservatives strive to strengthen and deregulate promotes and commercially markets the perceived assault on traditional values.

Frank also discusses Kansas&#x27; history on slavery and civil rights, experiencing violent conflict before entering as a free state, as well as being the location of &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954) that outlawed racial segregation. He argues that conservative backlash in Kansas cannot be ascribed to racism.

Frank applies his thesis to answer the question of why these social conservatives continue to vote for Republicans, even though they are voting against their best interests. He argues that politicians and pundits stir the &quot;Cons&quot; to action by evoking certain issues, such as abortion, immigration, and taxation. By portraying themselves as champions of the conservatives on these issues, the politicians can get &quot;Cons&quot; to vote them into office. However, once in office, these politicians turn their attention to more mundane economic issues, such as business tax reduction or deregulation. Frank&#x27;s thesis goes thus:

== Title ==

The book derives its name from an August 15, 1896 editorial by William Allen White in the &quot;Emporia Gazette&quot;, in which he took Populist leaders to task for letting Kansas slip into economic stagnation and not keeping up economically with neighboring states because of Populist policies chasing away economic capital from the state. The Republicans sent out hundreds of thousands of copies of the editorial in support of William McKinley during the 1896 U.S. presidential election.

The editorial established White&#x27;s career in journalism. Five Republican presidents — Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Herbert Hoover — were to spend nights at his home.

==Scholarly studies==
The notion that American politics has been transformed because of defection from the Democratic ranks of working-class social conservatives is not a new idea. Bartels identifies numerous scholars making the claim. They argue that the class basis of New Deal coalition had given way to a new structure in which conservative ideology and cultural issues brought large numbers of working-class whites into the Republican camp.
*As far back as Richard Nixon&#x27;s first year in the White House, Kevin Phillips made the claim in &quot;The Emerging Republican Majority&quot; (1969).
* Political scientist Everett Carll Ladd Jr. in 1976 identified &quot;an inversion of the old class relationship in voting&quot; due to &quot;the transformations of conflict characteristic of post-industrialism.&quot;
* Robert Huckfeldt and Carol Weitzel Kohfeld in &quot;Race and the Decline of Class in American Politics&quot; (1989) argued that &quot;race served to splinter the Democratic coalition&quot; because the policy commitments of the Civil Rights era provoked &quot;[r]acial hostility, particularly on the part of lower-status whites.&quot;

Kansas rejected the 2022 Kansas abortion referendum, which would have removed the right to abortion from the Kansas constitution.

==Criticism==
In the study &quot;The Truth about Conservative Christians,&quot; two sociologists, Andrew Greeley and Michael Hout, claim to show that class &quot; does &quot; matter, despite Frank&#x27;s thesis. Poorer Protestants, they argue, are much less likely to vote Republican than affluent ones. And, they claim, conservative Protestants are actually more likely to support progressive taxation than &quot;mainline&quot; Protestants are.

Conservative columnist John Leo argues that despite Frank&#x27;s belief that conservative politics is just a game of &quot;bait-and-switch&quot;, rural conservative voters have made their voices heard on a vast array of social issues. He points out that &quot;few of the issues that traditionalists care about ever seem to come up for democratic vote. Major change is imposed by courts or manipulated behind the scenes by bureaucrats loyal to the new moralists and the Democratic Party&quot;

Larry Bartels, an American political scientist and the Co-Director of the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions and Shayne Chair in Public Policy and Social Science at Vanderbilt University, in &quot;What&#x27;s the matter with &quot;What&#x27;s the Matter with Kansas?&quot;,&quot; tests &quot;Frank&#x27;s thesis by examining class-related patterns of issue preferences, partisanship, and voting over the past half-century.&quot; Specifically, Bartels focuses on four questions:
*Has the white working class abandoned the Democratic party?
*Has the white working class become more conservative?
*Do working class &quot;moral values&quot; trump economics?
*Are religious voters distracted from economic issues?
Bartels&#x27;s answer to each question is &quot;no.&quot; Frank provided a lengthy rebuttal to Bartels&#x27; analysis. More recently, in an apparent attempt to rebut Frank&#x27;s rebuttal via Barack Obama&#x27;s now infamous &quot;bitter&quot; label regarding Middle America during the 2008 Democratic Presidential campaign, Bartels offered a somewhat revised analysis of Frank&#x27;s original thesis in an op-ed piece in the April 17, 2008 edition of &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

<text>The University of Pikeville (UPIKE) is a private university affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA) and located in Pikeville, Kentucky. It was founded in 1889 by the Presbyterian Church and is located on a campus on a hillside overlooking downtown Pikeville.

The university is home to the Kentucky College of Osteopathic Medicine, one of three medical schools in the state of Kentucky. The university confers associate, bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and doctorate degrees through its six academic divisions and one medical college; enrollment was 2,366 students in fall 2016.

==History==
The university was founded in 1889 by the Presbyterian Church as the Pikeville Collegiate Institute. It operated on the primary, secondary and post-secondary levels, although its &quot;college&quot; offerings were not accredited and did not lead to a degree. Under the leadership of James Franklin Record, who was president of the school from 1899 to 1932, the high school was accredited, opened a teacher training institute, and expanded to include a junior college.

In 1909 the school was split into the Pikeville College Academy, which was a private school at the primary and secondary level, and Pikeville College, which was accredited as a junior college, offering the first two-years with an anticipation of students then transferring to another Presbyterian college for a degree. In 1955 the school became a degree granting four-year college in its own right, and in 1957 the academy closed.

In 1997, the Pikeville College School of Osteopathic Medicine, now the University of Pikeville Kentucky College of Osteopathic Medicine, was established. This makes the college one of the smallest colleges in the United States to have a medical school.

The purpose of the osteopathic medical school, while graduates are fully prepared to specialize in any medical field, is to train primary care physicians to fill the shortage of medical care in the rural section of Appalachia in which it is located. Student recruitment is focused almost exclusively on students with a rural Appalachian background. It is one of 29 osteopathic colleges in the country, and one of five in Appalachia.

On July 1, 2011, the school officially changed its name from &quot;Pikeville College&quot; to the &quot;University of Pikeville&quot;. Late in the same year, voices were raised in the Kentucky General Assembly in favor of converting the university into a state-supported school. By the end of the following March, proponents abandoned their plans after deeming them politically impossible.

==Campus==

The University of Pikeville is located on a hillside campus, overlooking Downtown Pikeville in Kentucky&#x27;s Eastern Mountain Coal Fields region.

The Marvin Student Center housed the campus bookstore, lounge, gameroom, post office, Upward Bound Program, and ROTC/National Guard Offices until it was demolished during the fall semester of 2010. A new building for the medical school called the Coal Building was built in its place. The new $34 million educational facility was dedicated on September 15, 2012.

UPIKE&#x27;s men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams play at the 5,700-seat Appalachian Wireless Arena adjacent to the campus in downtown Pikeville. The Expo Center opened in 2005 and replaced the UPike Gym as the home of the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams, although the women&#x27;s volleyball team still uses the gym. The facility has also hosted the Mid-South Conference basketball tournament.

<text>The 1924 United States Senate elections were elections for the United States Senate which coincided with the election of Republican President Calvin Coolidge to a full term. The 32 seats of Class 2 were contested in regular elections, and special elections were held to fill vacancies. The strong economy and Coolidge&#x27;s popularity helped Republican candidates increase their majority by three. Republicans would gain another seat through mid-term vacancies bringing their seat share to 56-39-1.

== Gains, losses, and holds ==

He faced former State Representative Frank Bird Linderman and several other opponents in the general election. Walsh ultimately won re-election to his third term by a solid margin.

<text>Sproughton ( ) is a village in Suffolk, England, just to the west of Ipswich and is in the Babergh administrative district. It has a church, a primary school, a pub (the Wild Man, which has been closed since 2020), a community shop and various groups. It is in the Belstead Brook electoral division of Suffolk County Council.

The River Gipping runs through the village. Nearby villages include Bramford and Burstall.

==All Saints Church, Sproughton==

The Anglican parish church dates from the 14th century. It was restored in the second half of the 19th century, by Frederick Barnes of Ipswich.

==Chantry estate and Sproughton Hall==

The historical house Sproughton Chantry, and its estate, was the origin of Chantry Park, now on the western outskirts of Ipswich.

The poet Ann Candler arrived in Sproughton on her marriage in 1762. She encountered difficulties with her absentee militiaman husband and a growing family. From the Tattingstone workhouse, she wrote verse in 1785 commemorating the death of Metcalfe Russell, a benefactor. He was a barrister of Gray&#x27;s Inn, called to the bar in 1762, and had bought the Chantry in 1772. By his will it passed to Michael Collinson, a relation.

Sproughton Hall, not far from the Chantry, was built by Sir Robert Harland, 1st Baronet.

<doc id="1319718" wikidata="Q6271733" url="?curid=1319718" title="Jon Wayne">
<text>Jon Wayne was a recording alias of musician, producer and studio engineer David Vaught (November 27, 1948 – March 20, 2013) and an eponymous parody country band, conceived and formed by him in Los Angeles in the 1980s together with fellow pseudonymous session musicians. 

Vaught recorded and produced the album &quot;Texas Funeral&quot; on which he also wrote the material, played and sang, accompanied by &quot;Jimbo&quot; (Jim Goodall) who played the drums. The group was expanded to include &quot;Earnest Bovine&quot; (Doug Livingston) and &quot;Billy Bob&quot; (Bruce Rhodewalt) who was later replaced by Timmy Turlock (Tommy Spurlock). The album was released in 1985, its intentionally ramshackle sound and lyrics parodying various Texan stereotypes, as well as musicians&#x27; mysterious identities helping it to become a cult classic over the years. 
One of the album&#x27;s early fans was director Quentin Tarantino, who wanted to use the title track in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, but couldn&#x27;t find any way to contact the band for permission. Vaught was eventually put in touch with the director, who slotted &quot;Texas Funeral&quot; into Robert Rodriguez&#x27;s film &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn&quot;. 

Jon Wayne also were featured in Spike Stewart&#x27;s rarely seen documentary &quot;D.U.I.&quot;, alongside many acts of the L.A.&#x27;s experimental art-punk noise scene of the early 1980s—such as Debt of Nature, Three Day Stubble, John Trubee &amp; The Ugly Janitors of America and Lopez Beatles—several of whom Jon Wayne actually shared members with.

Jon Wayne continued to perform occasionally throughout the 1990s and 2000s; the second studio album, &quot;Two Graduated Jiggers&quot; was released in 2000. In 2010, &quot;Texas Funeral&quot; was reissued on LP by Jack White&#x27;s Third Man Records label. Vaught&#x27;s last recording as &quot;Jon Wayne&quot; was a cameo on Marvin Etzioni&#x27;s 2012 album &quot;Marvin Country!&quot;, which he also engineered on his studio.

Vaught&#x27;s credits as a studio engineer include the albums Recovering the Satellites by Counting Crows and &quot;Rocket&quot; (Primitive Radio Gods album) by Primitive Radio Gods.

David Vaught died on March 20, 2013, from pancreatic cancer.

<doc id="1319719" wikidata="Q1164504" url="?curid=1319719" title="Middlesex Guildhall">
<text>The Middlesex Guildhall is a historic court building in Westminster which houses the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The building stands on the south-western corner of Parliament Square, near the Palace of Westminster. In 1970, the building was listed Grade II*.

Constructed in the early 20th century, the building was designed by Scottish architect J. S. Gibson and sculpted by British artist Henry Fehr. The guildhall is described by Historic England as Neo-Gothic with Flemish-Burgundian references. 

Initially serving as an administrative centre for Middlesex County Council and as a court of quarter session, it has undergone several iterations. The building later served as a Crown Court centre, until the establishment of the Supreme Court in the early 21st century.

==History==

The site on the south-western corner of Parliament Square was originally the belfry of Westminster Abbey. The first guildhall, designed as an octagon with a Doric portico by Samuel Pepys Cockerell, was built for the justices of the City and Liberty of Westminster and opened as the &quot;Westminster Sessions House&quot; or &quot;Westminster Guildhall&quot; in 1805.

In 1889 Westminster became part of the County of London, outside of the jurisdiction of the county of Middlesex. In the division of property between the Middlesex and London county councils, the guildhall at Westminster went to Middlesex in exchange for the Sessions House in Clerkenwell which went to London. In addition to being a facility for dispensing justice, following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1888, which established county councils in every county, the Guildhall also became the administrative headquarters and meeting place for Middlesex County Council.

Middlesex county leaders decided, in the context of their increased responsibilities, that the first Guildhall was inadequate for their purposes, and a second Guildhall, designed by F. H. Pownall in the neo-Tudor style, was constructed on the site in 1893.

After the county leaders found that the second Guildhall was actually too small, the current and third Guildhall, designed by J. S. Gibson, was built between 1906 and 1913. The architectural historian, Nikolaus Pevsner, described the design as &quot;art nouveau gothic style&quot;. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of nine bays facing Parliament Square; the central section of three bays which slightly projected forwards, featured an ornate arched doorway with a segmental arched window spanning the first and second floors and a tower above. A 17th century door, which had originally been part of the Tothill Fields Bridewell prison, was installed in the basement of the building. The building was decorated with medieval-style gargoyles and other architectural sculptures by Henry Charles Fehr.

Following the implementation of the London Government Act 1963, Middlesex County Council and the Middlesex sessions were abolished in 1965, but the Guildhall continued to be used by the Greater London Quarter Sessions. After the abolition of the Quarter Sessions in 1972, it was used as a venue of the Crown Court. The Guildhall ceased to be operate as a Crown Court following the completion of new courthouses in London such as Harrow Crown Court, Isleworth Crown Court and Knightsbridge Crown Court in the 1980s and 1990s.

The Middlesex Guildhall was closed for refurbishment in 2007 to convert it for use as the site of the new Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The Supreme Court, established in law by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, started operations on 1 October 2009.

==Controversy over conversion==

After the government chose the Middlesex Guildhall as home for the new Supreme Court, it was realised that a great deal of work was required to renovate the building and adapt it to the new use. Renovation plans were developed by architects Feilden+Mawson LLP, supported by Foster &amp; Partners.

Conservation groups were concerned that the planned conversion would be unsympathetic to such an important historic building. The Middlesex Guildhall is a Grade II* listed building, and the statement of importance by English Heritage classed the three main Court interiors as &quot;unsurpassed by any other courtroom of the period in terms of the quality and completeness of their fittings&quot; on 26 August 2004. The conversion works involved the removal of many of the original fixtures and fittings. Save Britain&#x27;s Heritage unsuccessfully contested the conversion.

<text>The 1922 United States Senate elections were elections that occurred in the middle of Republican President Warren G. Harding&#x27;s term. The 32 seats of Class 1 were contested in regular elections, and special elections were held to fill vacancies. With the Republicans divided between conservative and progressive factions, the Democrats gained six net seats from the Republicans while the Farmer–Labor party gained one. The Republicans retained their Senate majority.

Mid-term vacancies would reduce the Republican majority by a further two seats, with the Democrats and the Farmer Labors picking up another seat each, reducing Republicans to a 51-43-2 majority.

 Incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Charles Culberson ran for re-election to a fifth term, but he lost the Democratic primary. Railroads Commissioner Earle Bradford Mayfield defeated former Governor Pa Ferguson in the primary runoff. Mayfield won the runoff, but because of his support of the resurgent Ku Klux Klan, anti-Klan activists in the Democratic Party including George Peddy attempted to have him stripped of the nomination. After this failed, Peddy ran as the candidate of the &quot;Independent Democrats.&quot; The Texas Republican Party also backed Peddy, but after a lengthy court battle, they were unable to have him included on the general election ballot as their official nominee. Peddy instead ran as a write-in candidate, but he lost the general election to Mayfield.

<text>In the U.S. state of Wisconsin, the Lake Superior Lowland, also known as the Superior Coastal Plain, is a geographical region located in the far northern part of the state bordering Lake Superior. It covers about , and does not extend beyond from the Lake Superior shore.

The Lake Superior Lowland is defined by a plain that slopes gently downward towards the north. While the area is mostly flat, the altitude ranges from about 600 feet (180 m) to 1000 feet (or 300 meters) above sea level. The higher altitudes are located on the Bayfield Peninsula, where the characteristic plain gives way to more rugged hills. Northeast of the peninsula are the Apostle Islands, which have been designated as a National Lakeshore.

Woodland covers most of the Lake Superior Lowland. Much of the forested area is dominated by aspen and birch trees, with some conifers interspersed throughout the forest. Some pasture and cropland has been established on the plain. Marshes and wetlands exist in a few places in the region, and several rivers drain the region into Lake Superior, including the Brule River, which is surrounded by a State Forest. Two Ojibwa Indian reservations are located along the shores of Lake Superior, the Bad River Indian Reservation and the Red Cliff Indian Reservation. The largest city in the area is Superior, Wisconsin. Other cities include Ashland and Washburn.

This is part of a northern Wisconsin area colloquially referred to as &quot;up north.&quot;

==Counties in the Lake Superior Lowland==
Part of the land of the following counties is included in the Lake Superior Coastal Plain:
*Ashland County
*Bayfield County
*Douglas County
*Iron County

<doc id="1319772" wikidata="Q6222736" url="?curid=1319772" title="John Boy and Billy">
<text>John Isley (born August 15, 1956) and Billy James (born August 31, 1957), known as John Boy &amp; Billy, are American radio hosts based in Charlotte, North Carolina. Their comedic morning program &quot;The John Boy &amp; Billy Big Show&quot; broadcasts from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time in several Southern and Midwestern states via syndication through Premiere Networks, primarily airing on classic rock, active rock, and country music stations.

The format consists of talk segments intermixed with music, contests, and skit-based humor. The two lead hosts serve as a double act, with John Boy the comic foil and Billy the straight man. Current events, right-wing politics, sports (mainly race car drivers), and male-oriented problems are common topics of talk. Broadcast states include North Carolina, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia.

The duo frequently interviews musicians, comedians, NASCAR drivers, professional wrestlers, and other public figures, such as Robert Earl Keen, Killer Beaz, Manny Pacquiao, Stephen Curry, Rodney Carrington, James Gregory, Pat McCrory, and the late Tim Wilson. The show also markets a line of Bar-B-Que sauces (named John Boy &amp; Billy Grillin&#x27; Sauce).

==History==
For more than five years, John Boy and Billy hosted the morning show at Top 40 WBCY 107.9 FM in Charlotte. Their comic talents made them number one with the station&#x27;s 18 to 34 listeners. But John Boy quit in February 1986, while Billy stayed for a month and a half, partnering unsuccessfully with Bob Lacey and Jim &quot;Catfish&quot; Prewitt.

Competing station WRFX 99.7 FM changed to album rock that same year and needed a morning show. WRFX signed John Boy and Billy to be the station&#x27;s wake up hosts, but they could not start their new show until November due to a noncompete clause. A $250,000 billboard and television campaign, in which they had bags over their heads, preceded their return. On November 8 at 9:00 a.m., WRFX announced, &quot;They&#x27;re back!&quot; and played &quot;The Boys Are Back in Town&quot; by Thin Lizzy. One difference on the new station, said John Boy, was &quot;We&#x27;ll actually listen to the music ... we&#x27;re rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll guys.&quot;

John Boy was arrested at a night club October 21, 1990, and charged with felony possession of marijuana, but the charge was later reduced to a misdemeanor because the amount was small. As part of his plea agreement, John Boy agreed to broadcast anti-drug messages on WRFX.

Early in 1993, news came out that John Boy and Billy were being asked by Mel Karmazin (boss to Howard Stern) to move to Atlanta and syndicate their show. At the time, WROQ in Greenville, South Carolina, was the only other station carrying the show. WRFX general manager Jack Daniel said the station made a six-year deal that would keep John Boy and Billy at WRFX but also allow the show to be heard in Atlanta, along with Raleigh and Columbia in the Carolinas as well as Texas, with the hosts getting a share of syndication income. One disadvantage: the show would include less locally oriented humor that people in other markets wouldn&#x27;t understand.

By August 1994, the show was heard on 14 radio stations, most of them playing rock. Two of the stations were sports talk--WRFX-AM (co-owned with flagship WRFX-FM) and WFNS in Tampa, Florida. The other stations were in WZZU in Raleigh; WROQ in Greenville; WSFL in New Bern, North Carolina; WXFX in Montgomery, Alabama; WYBB in Charleston, South Carolina; WMFX in Columbia; WKLC in Charleston, West Virginia; WDRK in Panama City Beach, Florida; WVRK in Columbus, Georgia; WJMX-FM in Florence, South Carolina; WIMZ in Knoxville, Tennessee; and WEKL in Augusta, Georgia. WRFX-AM went back to sports talk in the morning early in 1995.

On July 6, the show added KZPS in Dallas, which was the largest radio market yet, #7 at the time. Till that time, its largest markets had been Orlando, Florida, and Nashville, Tennessee, but now John Boy and Billy had the potential to be mentioned alongside Stern and Don Imus in the radio syndication business. (KZPS has since discontinued the show, but the network currently has six affiliates in Texas.) John Boy hoped to be heard in the North, too, though many doubted that would work.

By 1996, the show was heard on 28 stations in 10 states. In June of that year the first country station to air the show was WMTD-FM in Beckley, West Virginia.

In 1999, John Boy and Billy were being heard on 65 rock stations in 18 states, but the show was expected to dramatically increase its potential audience when the producers added the option of country music. WHSL in Greensboro, North Carolina, which was owned by Capstar Broadcasting (same as WRFX and the John Boy and Billy Network), was one of the first country stations in the network. Prophet Systems Innovations, also owned by Capstar, developed the technology to easily allow different musical programs between talk segments. About three rock songs were played per hour, though country songs tended to be shorter and there might be more of them. Macon Moye, vice president and general manager of the John Boy and Billy network, said the addition of country music would allow the show to be heard in northern states where the show would not fit a rock format. Sean Ross, editor of Airplay Monitor, cautioned that the show might be &quot;too edgy and too male&quot; for some country stations, but Tom Taylor, editor of the M Street Daily Fax of Nashville, Tennessee, believed the show had great potential to expand.

By 2002, 110 stations carried the show. At this time, oldies stations could broadcast the show with songs specific to their format. This was true when classic rock stations inadvertently aired the Queen song &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot; immediately after the show reported about the Beltway sniper attacks in October 2002. Executive producer Randy Brazell said songs were selected in advance and stored using complicated computer software. After the hosts learned from an affiliate what had happened, they decided that to mention it on the air would give the incident more attention; perhaps people had not noticed.

In 2008 the show gained its first New Jersey affiliate, country music station 106.7 WKOE in North Cape May. In April 2009, the show went north of the Mason–Dixon line and went on the air on 95.9 WZDB Sykesville, Pennsylvania, &quot;Rockin the Northern Alleghenies.&quot;

The show is now pre-recorded ahead of time for playback from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Each day&#x27;s broadcast can also be streamed on the iHeartMedia app and is made available later in the day as the &quot;Late Riser&#x27;s Podcast,&quot; with all the music and many of the commercials removed for a typical overall running time of 70-90 minutes.

The show&#x27;s final broadcast on WRFX occurred on November 15, 2024. It continues to run in syndication on iHeart&#x27;s Premier Networks, airing on other stations throughout the Southeast.

<text>Philomathean Society of the University of Pennsylvania is a collegiate literary society, the oldest student group at the university, and the oldest continuously-existing collegiate literary society in the United States. Founded in 1813, its goal is &quot;to promote the learning of its members and to increase the academic prestige of the University.&quot; 

==History==

Philomathean Society, was founded on October 2, 1813, by all thirteen members of the junior class, its original purpose being &quot;the advancement of learning;&quot; a counterweight and complement to Penn&#x27;s academic coursework. In the first meeting, the title of Moderator was chosen for the Society’s presiding officer; two Censores Morum were appointed by the third meeting, who were given the responsibility, maintained to this day, of fining members for various real or imaginary infractions. Philo’s first meeting was on Friday night, at which time it would remain up to the present day. Minutes of the Society’s Meetings have been kept (relatively) faithfully in large leather-bound volumes since the first Meeting. Members still sign the Recorder’s Roll upon their initiation into the Society, following the tradition started by the founders. Early meetings were dominated by spirited debates and literary exercises where members would present original research, essays, or literary productions; both practices have continued through the present day.

When the University of Pennsylvania moved its campus from Ninth Street to West Philadelphia in 1872, four rooms at the top of College Hall were specifically built for the use of the Society and its rival Zelosophic Society. After the first collapse of the Zelosophic Society in 1872, the former Zelo rooms reverted to Philo.

The Society is credited with helping to found entire academic departments, including American Civilization, Comparative Literature, and History of Science, and many campus groups and publications, including the &quot;Daily Pennsylvanian&quot; and the Mask and Wig Club.
In 1858, the Society published the first complete English translation of the Rosetta Stone. The work was performed solely by three undergraduate members, Charles R. Hale, S. Huntington Jones, and Henry Morton. The translation quickly sold out two editions and was internationally hailed as a monumental work of scholarship. In 1988, the British Museum bestowed the honor of including the Philomathean Rosetta Stone Report in its select bibliography of the most important works ever published on the Rosetta Stone. The Philomathean Society maintains a full-scale cast of the stone in its meeting room, along with several original lithograph prints of the report.

In 1916, Philo became the first Penn group to require its members to take an oath not to discriminate based on race, creed, and religion; in 1948 the Society voted to admit women as full members, prompting the headline &quot;Philo hits rock bottom, admits women&quot;. The Society vehemently defended the decision more than 25 years before women were admitted to the university proper.

In 1927, overcrowding at the university led the Philos to agree to vacate their space in College Hall in exchange for temporary quarters in Houston Hall until more class space could be found. Houston Hall was not an ideal location: space constraints and building policy, especially the 11:30 p.m. curfew, severely limited Philo traditions. As a result, Society membership decreased, a trend further exacerbated by the outbreak of World War II, when Houston Hall was taken over by the U.S. Navy as part of its officer training program, and former Philo rooms were requisitioned for storage. The Society had dwindled to a single member, Hilary Putnam, who tried to preserve the Philomathean customs and arranged informal meetings in members&#x27; apartments. After the war, the Society held more formal meetings and grew in membership, but it was not until 1951, under the direction of Moderator Charles Fine Ludwig, that the old pre-war customs were revived. Ludwig re-acquired the Philomathean archives and reintroduced academic attire, consistent meeting minutes, a regular literary exercise, and an official lecture series, among many other Philomathean customs. Ludwig also established the tradition of Philo&#x27;s graduates, or &quot;senior members&quot;, participating in the Society&#x27;s activities and taking an ongoing interest in the welfare of the Society.

Finally, in 1969, after a determined campaign of lobbying university administrators for permission and senior members for donations, the Society returned to its beloved Philomathean Halls on the fourth floor of College Hall, where it has remained (with brief absences for maintenance) until the present day.

== Symbols ==
The name Philomathean is derived from the Greek &quot;philomath&quot;, which means &quot;a lover of learning.&quot; The motto of the Philomathean Society is &quot;Sic itur ad astra&quot; (Latin for &quot;thus we proceed to the stars&quot;&quot;).&quot; 

Philo intermittently publishes &quot;Philomel&quot;, a literary magazine. Its nickname is Philo.

==Present activities==


In addition to its eight general meetings, Philo has regular afternoon teas with professors and sponsors other academic events such as lecture series&#x27;, film series, debates, book clubs, and other events. Most of these events center around inviting one or more Penn professors (and occasionally distinguished faculty from other universities) to the Halls to present their research and career experiences. Society members are given freedom to plan events fitting their personal and intellectual interests, which has led to events as varied as art exhibitions, chamber concerts, math olympiads, and the Poe Vespertil.

The Society has published several books, including, most recently, &quot;The Philomathean Society Anthology of Poetry in Honor of Daniel Hoffman&quot; — Hoffman, a former professor at the university and a distinguished poet in his own right, had brought many renowned poets and authors, including John Updike, Seamus Heaney, Joyce Carol Oates, and Yevgeny Yevtushenko, to read in the Philomathean Halls.

On February 16, 2010, Philo hosted a public screening of the 1971 internationally televised debate between philosophers Noam Chomsky and Michel Foucault. Philo&#x27;s was the first public screening of the debate in the world since the original 1971 broadcast. Debate topics included human nature, justice, creativity and war. Since then, Philo has been the venue of many debates about matters central to modern society, such as a discussion of whether a tomato is a grape or a metaphor for Homeric authorship.

On March 28, 2019, Philo hosted a talk by US Poet Laureate Tracy K. Smith.

==Membership==

Membership in the Society is by application; all currently enrolled undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Pennsylvania are eligible for membership except in their final semester of study. Applications consist of three parts: an interview with four to five members of the Society, a presentation on a topic of the applicant&#x27;s choice to a General Meeting of the Society, and a submission of creative or critical value. Members are elected once each academic semester by the Society at large.

The society is governed by a Cabinet of ten officers: the Moderator, First Censor, Second Censor, Scriba, Recorder, Treasurer, Librarian, Archivist, Annual Oration Director, and Art Gallery Director. The first four, often termed &quot;the Bench&quot; about their position during meetings, are attired in full academic gown at all society meetings, held eight times per semester on the top floor of College Hall, on Friday evenings. The position of Annual Oration Director was added in the early 2010s to provide additional support for the increased role of the Annual Oration, and the position of Art Gallery Director was added in 2019.

==Other Philomathean Societies==

Several other societies share the Philomathean name. Among them are:

* Union College&#x27;s Philomathean Society was founded in 1793 as the Calliopean while Union was still known as the Schenectady Academy. The name was changed to the Philomathean Society in 1795.
* Phi Mu, the second oldest secret organization for women, was founded as &quot;The Philomathean Society&quot; in 1852 at Wesleyan College in Macon, Georgia.
* New York University&#x27;s Philomathean Society was founded in 1832.
* Phillips Academy&#x27;s Philomathean Society, founded in 1825, is the second oldest high school debate society in the nation.
* The Philomates Association is the largest international academic association, with 23,000 members. It meets every year in Italy.
* Catawba College of Salisbury, North Carolina, also charters a Philomathean Society. The group was created in 1851, after the founding of the college, and served as a society for debate and fellowship for young men. Soon after its inception, the Philomathean Society began a library in their home because the college did not yet have one. In the early 1900s the society became inactive, but was resurrected in 1991 to serve in a different capacity. The all-male society now serves as a group dedicated to &quot;Scholarship, Culture, Character, and Service&quot;, the motto of the College. Membership is by invitation only.
* The Philomathean Literary Society was established in 1842 at Erskine College. A number of South Carolinian politicians, theologians, lawyers, writers, and thinkers were inducted as members or honored with membership. It is one of Erskine&#x27;s four literary societies today.
* Founded in 1849, the University of Virginia&#x27;s Philomathean Society formed as a splinter group from the Washington Literary Society and Debating Union.
* Willamette University in Salem, Oregon, boasts the oldest Philomathean Society in the west; it was founded in 1856.
* Ouachita College, now Ouachita Baptist University, had a Philomathean Literary Society that existed from 1888 to 1931. The Philos and their rivals, the Hermesians, were the result in a split in the college&#x27;s original literary society, the Adelphian Circle, formed in 1886.

<doc id="1319780" wikidata="Q3548135" url="?curid=1319780" title="Mythology in France">
<text>The mythologies in present-day France encompass the mythology of the Gauls, Franks, Normans, Bretons, and other peoples living in France, those ancient stories about divine or heroic beings that these particular cultures believed to be true and that often use supernatural events or characters to explain the nature of the universe and humanity. French myth has been primarily influenced by the myths and legends of the Gauls (or Celts) and the Bretons as they migrated to the French region from modern day England and Ireland. Other smaller influences on the development of French mythology came from the Franks.

== History of myth in France ==

Until March 1790, France was divided into 34 provinces which existed independently of each other. All provinces operated under the regime of the King, but there was no national citizenship or holistic nation state. Most provinces were settled by several different racial groups. As such, most provinces developed their own unique mythological beliefs and customs. These historic geographic divisions have led to a great diversity of myths and legends which survive across contemporary France.
Gallia, etymologically distinct from Gaul though in common parlance used interchangeably, was the name given to contemporary France by the Romans, and comprised land from the Mediterranean coast of France to the Pyrenees. Gaul was inhabited by several ethnic groups, mostly descendant from Celtic peoples, known as the Gallic tribes. These Gallic tribes developed distinct forms of Gallo-Roman culture after the Roman sacking of Gaul in the second century. The first settlers inhabited modern day Brittany, and the mythology of the northernmost Gallic tribes, including werewolves and other mischwesen, survive in lais from Medieval manuscripts. Between the 3rd and 7th century, Germanic migrants began to settle in Roman-Gaul. As the Western-Roman empire began to collapse, the German migrants who would become known as the Franks began to exercise their influence over the west of France. The Franks shared many of the customs and superstitions with other Germanic peoples, and spread many of their nature rituals and beliefs across western France.

== Gallo-Roman myth ==
After the sacking of Gaul by the Romans in the 2nd century, the spiritual and mythological practices of the Gauls in the French region began to change due to Roman influence. Traditional Celtic Paganism draws on the deities of the Celtic pantheon, an extensive grouping of gods and goddesses traditionally worshiped in Celtic lands, and acknowledges the supernatural within the natural environment. As the Roman Empire began to expand, many Celtic beliefs and practices merged with the beliefs of the Romans. By the 3rd century, the Gauls worshiped many Roman deities like Mercury and Mars, and some uniquely Gallo-Roman Gods, like Teutates and Dea Matrona. Many of the Roman deities may have been worshiped under different names, though most records of Gallic religions were written by Romans like Julius Caesar and hence these names are unknown.

Individual households and tribes had their own gods and goddesses, who served as a bridge between people and nature. The Gallo-Romans believed that some natural features had their own deities. Some of these deities, are still revered under Christianised names, like the nymph of the Breton shore, who is still venerated under the name of Saint Anne. Many of these local deities were drawn from the old Celtic pantheon, and influenced by the Roman deities.

The Gauls worshiped the main gods of the Roman pantheon, observing rituals related to Mercury, Apollo, Mars, Jupiter, and Minerva. Gallo-Romans regarded Mercury as the creator of the Arts, and the God ruling over trade, commerce, and communication. Apollo was believed to protect the Gauls from disease, Minerva was the goddess of wisdom and practical life arts, Jupiter was able to control the sun, moon, and weather, and Mars was the god of war. The Gauls often made sacrifices to Mars during wartime, offering up cattle from conquered territories in exchange for protection in battle.

=== Druidism ===
The influence of Celtic mythology did not disappear after the Roman invasion, with the rituals and practices of Druidism still exerting influence over the mythology of the Gauls. Druids in Roman-Gaul were the philosophers and religious figures of the Gallic tribes. Druids were the educated classes among Celtic and Gallo-Roman culture, having knowledge about nature, astronomy, literature, and the law. Druids were unable to record any of their knowledge in written form, but records from Julius Caesar survive, giving details of Druidic rituals. Caesar writes that Druids were responsible for conducting both human and animal sacrifices for those who were sick or at risk of dying in battle. Druids constructed wicker statues and images in which the sacrifices are placed before they are burned. In traditional Celtic Paganism, these sacrifices were made to the Celtic gods and goddesses. Roman-Gallo Druids probably made sacrifices to honour the gods of the Roman pantheon by drawing on the Celtic practice of sacrifice. Pliny the Elder, a Roman-Gallic author who wrote extensively about Gallo-Roman culture, observed that Druids acted as judges in criminal cases and provided spiritual guidance to their people by interpreting omens.

== Myths of Brittany ==
=== Prehistoric myth ===

The Carnac stones are a cluster of megaliths in the north western village of Carnac in Brittany. The megaliths were probably built by either Celtic or pre-Celtic peoples, between the Bronze and Iron Ages. There are more than 3,000 types of megaliths in the cluster including the dolmen, a large rock, supported by smaller stones; and the menhir, a monolith set up on the end of a single stone which is buried in the ground. The folkloric significance of these stones is unclear though they probably functioned as outdoor altars or open-air temples for rituals involved in the practicing of Celtic Paganism. Dolmens and menhirs may also mark the tombs of significant leaders in tribal groups, like chiefs, priests, or celebrated warriors.

=== Middle Ages and Paganism ===
The Middle Ages was a period of transition between the various Pagan traditions influenced by the Celts and the Romans, and the influx of Christianity from Britain. Much of Brittany&#x27;s folklore, including the Gallo-Roman deities and mythical figures, were preserved in lais; short style of poetry popular in the High Middle Ages which discuss values of chivalry, the role of the mythical in the lives of regular people, and they deal primarily with matters of love. The lais of Marie de France were some of the most influential and provided insight into many of Brittany&#x27;s folkloric beliefs in the Middle Ages.

Prominent figures of Celtic Paganism feature heavily in Breton lais. Many sprites, fairies, and demons populate the belief system of the Celts and were important figures in the communication of moral lessons and the explanation of unknown phenomena in Brittany. Such figures who were important to the Bretons included
* The Ankou: A grim-reaper type figure who travels across Brittany in a cart and collects the souls of peasants. The Ankou is usually depicted as a female skeleton and the figure was probably derived from the Celtic god of Death, but was greatly influenced by Medieval ideas of ‘Death the Skeleton.’
* The Nain: A gargoyle like creature who dance around dolmen in the middle of the night. It was believed that those see the Nain will curse them with bad luck and will plant false memories in the minds of victims in order to lure them into danger.
* The Youdic: Victims of the vast bogs believed to be portals to infernal regions and Hell known as the Yeun.

Werewolves also feature heavily in the mythology of Brittany. Brittons believed werewolves to be men condemned to transform into wolves as punishment for sins. Superstition regarding werewolves may have stemmed from a fear of cannibalism among early residents of Brittany, but fears about the existence of werewolves continued into the 16th century. Werewolves appear in many Breton lais, including the lais of Marie de France, one of the most well-known authors of Old French lais in the 12th century. Werewolves appear in Marie de France&#x27;s lai ‘Bisclavret’ which tells the story of a man who transforms into a werewolf, referred to as a bisclavret in the story, when he removes his clothing. Marie de France&#x27;s work likely draws heavily from existing pre-existing mythology and can be used to understand how the public felt about certain figures.

=== Christianisation of Brittany ===
Brittany was Christianised during the latter part of the Gallo-Roman habitation of France. In the 5th and 6th centuries C.E. British people moved to Brittany to flee from Anglo-Saxon invaders. The British migrants spread Christianity throughout Brittany over the next 300 years, assisted by missionaries from the British Isles. Contemporary Britons give great respect to the ‘Seven Founding Saints’ who are credited with bringing Catholicism to Brittany. The ‘Seven Founding Saints’ are:
* St Paol Aoreliann
* St Tudwal
* St Brieg
* St Maloù
* St Samsun of Dol
* St Padarn
* St Kaourintin 

Brittany&#x27;s insular nature has led to the development of many distinctive traditions within Catholic religious practice, including &quot;Pardons.&quot; Pardons are penitential ceremonies occurring in an individual parish on the feast day of their saint. The celebrations involve parishioners processing together to a church or shrine to ask for forgiveness for sins, and ends with a large meal celebrated by all the penitents.

==Frankish myths==
=== Pre-Christian Paganism ===

The Franks were a group of Germanic people who found their mythological and spiritual origins in pre-Christian Germanic Paganism. They invaded Gaul in the 4th and 5th centuries, and became the dominant force in the region of present-day France and Western Germany. In 358 CE, Rome was forced to relinquish some of the land they held in Gaul, allowing the Franks to expand their territory into Gaul. By 480 CE, the Franks held firmly to the western part of France.

Early Frank mythology found its roots in Germanic paganism, and the Franks would have probably worshiped gods from a German pantheon, but may have placed emphasis on the fertility gods. The German pantheon is likely to have had three central figures; Thor, the most powerful god who rules the air and sea, Wodan, god of war, and Fricco god of peace. The Frankish people probably worshiped the deities of the German pantheon through the construction of altars and practicing of nature-based rituals in forest glens or beside lakes. It is believed that the Franks took a deeply tribal approach to religious practice. Apart from the most central figures of the German pantheon, some gods borrowed from the Nordic pantheon, or the &quot;Allfadir,&quot; a central, all-knowing deity, the many Frankish tribes worshiped separate gods. These tribalistic gods were not worshiped or feared outside their tribes. Cults of Wodan (sometimes referred to Ođinn), and Cults of Nerthus were common among the central Frankish tribes, while Cults of Yngvi were common among tribes along the North Sea.

=== Christianisation of the Franks ===
The process of converting the Pagan Franks to Chalcedonian Christianity began between the late 5th century and early 6th century. It began with the baptism of the wife of Clovis I, the first king to unite all of the Frankish tribes under one ruler. His wife, Clotilde, converted to Chalcedonian Christianity in approximately 500 CE and then convinced Clovis I to be baptised into Chalcedonian Christianity in 508 CE. During his reign, King Clovis I encouraged many Frankish tribes to begin practicing Christianity, weakening the hold that Roman legend had on the Franks. He influenced the mass adoption of Chalcedonian Christianity at the collapse of the Roman empire, which encouraged the unification of the Frankish tribes under the rule of Clovis. King Clovis I managed to mostly phase out the practicing of Germanic Paganism in the Frankish land during his reign.

<doc id="1319785" wikidata="Q188746" url="?curid=1319785" title="Jermain Defoe">
<text>Jermain Colin Defoe (born 7 October 1982) is an English football coach and former professional player. He was most recently the under-18s coach at Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur.

Defoe was a striker and began his career with Charlton Athletic, joining their youth team aged 14, before moving to West Ham United aged 16 and rising through the ranks. He made his first-team debut for West Ham in 2000 and, after a season-long loan spell at AFC Bournemouth during the 2000–01 season, established himself in the West Ham line-up. After West Ham&#x27;s relegation in 2003, a move to Tottenham Hotspur in January 2004 soon followed, where Defoe played for four years before being sold to Portsmouth in January 2008. He spent one season at Fratton Park before returning to Tottenham in the January 2009 transfer window. He left for Toronto FC of Major League Soccer (MLS) in 2014, before returning to England in January 2015 to sign for Sunderland where he stayed until the club was relegated from the Premier League in 2017. Following a brief spell at AFC Bournemouth in 2017, Defoe joined Scottish side Rangers in 2018 on loan. The move was later made permanent. At his new club he was involved in winning the 2020–21 league title. This was the first and only league title in his career at the age of 38.

In April 2011, Defoe became the 20th player to score a century of Premier League goals, and is currently the tenth-highest goalscorer in Premier League history as well as the sixth-highest goalscorer in Tottenham&#x27;s history. Defoe also holds the Premier League record for the most goals scored as a substitute, with 24. On 19 November 2016, Defoe scored his 150th Premier League goal, becoming the joint tenth-highest goal scorer in Premier League history.

Defoe debuted for the England national team in 2004, making 57 appearances and scoring 20 goals, including three appearances and a goal at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

==Early life==
Defoe was born in Beckton, east London. He was born to a Dominican father and his mother is of Saint Lucian descent. Defoe attended St Joachim Primary School in Custom House, London and St Bonaventure&#x27;s in Forest Gate, London.

Defoe grew up in Canning Town and when his family moved to Beckton, played five-a-side football at Newham Leisure Centre. He joined the Sunday league team Senrab, well known in London for producing players such as Lee Bowyer, John Terry, Ashley Cole and Ledley King, and then joined the FA National School of Excellence at Lilleshall, Shropshire, as a 14-year-old in 1997. While there, he attended Idsall School.

==Club career==
===West Ham United===
Defoe was spotted playing football by Charlton Athletic who enrolled him at the FA National School of Excellence at Lilleshall Hall in 1997. Two years later, he took the controversial decision, aged 16, to turn professional with West Ham United, following which Charlton were subsequently awarded compensation rising to £1.4 million contingent on Defoe&#x27;s Premier League and international appearances. At West Ham, he was a member of the Under-19 team that won the Premier Academy League title in 1999–2000, scoring twice against Arsenal in the play-off final.

Defoe made his first-team debut in a League Cup match against Walsall in September 2000, scoring in a 1–0 win. Shortly thereafter, he joined Second Division club AFC Bournemouth on a near season-long loan, where he scored in ten consecutive matches, equalling John Aldridge&#x27;s and Clarrie Jordan&#x27;s post-war record. He scored 18 goals in 29 league appearances for Bournemouth. West Ham manager Harry Redknapp tipped him for stardom, saying, &quot;He&#x27;s done great. I sent him out to Bournemouth to get some experience playing league football and he&#x27;s coped marvellously. To score 10 goals in 10 games is a terrific achievement. He&#x27;s a bright lad who&#x27;s full of confidence. Nothing knocks him, he&#x27;s a typical goal-scorer. If he misses, he&#x27;ll be there the next time looking for a goal. He&#x27;s a kid with a big future.&quot;

Defoe finished as West Ham&#x27;s top scorer in the 2001–02 season despite being used primarily as a substitute by manager Glenn Roeder, scoring 14 goals in 39 league and cup appearances, one of which was a 1–0 away win against Manchester United in December 2001, as West Ham finished seventh in the Premier League. He scored a further 11 goals in 42 league and cup appearances in 2002–03 but was unable to prevent West Ham from being relegated.

Less than 24 hours after the club had been relegated, Defoe made a written request for a transfer, saying, &quot;As much as I love West Ham United I feel that now is the right time for me to move on in my career. This is very much a career decision. I am very ambitious and hungry to achieve at the highest levels of the game for both club and country.&quot; The timing of his request, however, drew criticism from both fans and teammates and was turned down by the club. He later apologised to supporters, saying, &quot;I mishandled that move and I can only apologise. I&#x27;m young and I&#x27;ve learned from it. I still played my hardest for West Ham and gave them 100% and want to thank the fans for their support.&quot;

Defoe began 2003–04 with West Ham but a refusal to sign a new contract and disciplinary problems, including three sendings-off, which saw him play only 22 matches out of a possible 34, led to West Ham accepting an offer from Tottenham Hotspur for him in the January transfer window.

===Tottenham Hotspur===
Defoe joined Tottenham in February 2004 for an initial fee of £6 million, rising to £7 million depending on &quot;specific performance criteria&quot;, and with Bobby Zamora joining West Ham. Manager David Pleat said, &quot;I can&#x27;t think of a British striker at his age who has achieved as much in such a short space of time. His goal record for a 21-year-old is quite exceptional. I hope he will have a fine career at Tottenham.&quot; Defoe marked his arrival at Tottenham with a goal on his debut in the 4–3 home win over Portsmouth in February 2004 and added a further six in the remainder of 2003–04, scoring 7 goals in 15 matches. He then scored 13 goals in 36 matches in the Premier League, including a hat-trick in a 5–1 win over Southampton in December 2004, and nine goals in eight matches in the FA Cup and League Cup, in 2004–05. He also received the club&#x27;s Player of the Year award for the 2004 calendar year, as voted by season ticket holders and Spurs members. Despite speculation linking him with other clubs, Defoe signed a new four-and-a-half-year contract with Tottenham in April 2005. The following season was not as profitable for Defoe, and Spurs manager Martin Jol used Defoe in rotation with Robbie Keane, Dimitar Berbatov and Mido providing the competition for a starting position. Defoe started 23 times and came on as substitute 13 times, scoring nine goals.

Defoe made 49 league and cup appearances for Tottenham, scoring 18 goals, during 2006–07 as Tottenham competed in the UEFA Cup as well as the domestic competitions. He appeared to bite West Ham player Javier Mascherano on the shoulder during Tottenham&#x27;s 1–0 win over West Ham in October 2006, sparking a melee between players of both teams. The FA declined to take action against Defoe as the referee, Steve Bennett, had booked Defoe for the incident. Defoe scored his 50th goal for Tottenham in the 2–1 win over Aston Villa on Boxing Day in December 2006, in which he scored both goals, and scored in Tottenham&#x27;s 2–0 win over Charlton in May 2007, which condemned his former club to relegation to the Championship. During the summer of 2007, there was speculation about Defoe&#x27;s future at Tottenham following the arrival of Darren Bent for a fee of £16.5 million. However, Defoe insisted that he would stay at Tottenham and fight for his place, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m really excited about the new season and the prospect of another campaign in Europe. We have made some good signings and are now stronger and better equipped to compete in all competitions.&quot;

On 20 September 2007, Defoe came on as a substitute against Cypriot club Anorthosis Famagusta to score twice in a 6–1 win, his first goals of the season. On 25 November 2007, he missed a penalty against former club West Ham at the Boleyn Ground in added time which would have won the match for Spurs; the match finished 1–1.

===Portsmouth===
Defoe joined Portsmouth in January 2008 for £7.5 million. He scored the equalising goal on his debut, a 1–1 draw at home to Chelsea. In March 2008, he was unable to play against Tottenham as the Premier League ruled that he was ineligible to do so as he was initially signed on loan in January 2008. In Portsmouth&#x27;s match against Wigan Athletic the following week, he scored twice; in so doing, he became the first ever Portsmouth player to score in his first five home matches. Due to appearances in Tottenham&#x27;s third and fourth round ties, Defoe found himself cup-tied for all the subsequent matches of Pompey&#x27;s successful 2007–08 FA Cup campaign. This also meant that he missed out on playing in Spurs&#x27; League Cup final victory over Chelsea, however he still received his winners&#x27; medal, albeit 10 years later, in December 2018. Defoe ended 2007–08 with eight goals in 12 appearances for Portsmouth.

Defoe scored Portsmouth&#x27;s first goal of 2008–09 on 30 August 2008 with the opener in a 3–0 win at Everton, and then scored their first home goals on 13 September with a brace against Middlesbrough. Five days later, he contributed a goal and an assist in Pompey&#x27;s first ever major European match, a 2–0 UEFA Cup first round win over Portuguese club Vitória de Guimarães on 18 September.

===Return to Tottenham===
In January 2009, Portsmouth chairman Peter Storrie revealed Defoe&#x27;s intentions to leave the club in the near future. This came after joining the club only in the same transfer window of the previous year. It was reported that Defoe&#x27;s former club Tottenham made a formal approach for the striker, but no agreement was reached; Spurs manager Harry Redknapp described the clubs as &quot;miles apart in their valuation of the player&quot;, suggesting that Portsmouth wanted &quot;in excess of £20 million&quot;. After negotiations, Portsmouth accepted a bid from Tottenham thought to be around £15.75 million (including fees owed to Tottenham for the previous transfers of Younès Kaboul and Pedro Mendes and waiving a £4 million sell-on clause that had also been negotiated during his transfer from Spurs to Portsmouth) on 6 January 2009. The player had agreed to a five-year contract and was confirmed as a Tottenham player by his new club on 9 January 2009. Defoe was presented at White Hart Lane with a carnival atmosphere before the start of Spurs&#x27; League Cup clash against Burnley after his return to White Hart Lane.

====2008–09 season====
Defoe made his return debut on 11 January 2009 in a Premier League match against Wigan Athletic. He scored his first goal against former club Portsmouth at White Hart Lane on 18 January 2009, in a match which finished 1–1. He also scored his team&#x27;s second goal in the League Cup semi-final second leg loss at Burnley, which helped Spurs book a place in the final with a 6–4 aggregate win. He scored three goals in his first four matches before suffering a broken foot which meant that he returned for Spurs against Newcastle United on 19 April in which the club won 1–0. This injury meant he missed Spurs&#x27; appearance in the 2009 Football League Cup Final. He scored his first goal since his return from injury in a 2–1 win against Manchester City and helped his team secure eighth place in the league.

====2009–10 season====
On 19 August 2009, Defoe scored his first hat-trick for Tottenham in a 5–1 away victory over Hull City in the second match of the 2009–10 Premier League. Following the match, his manager Harry Redknapp stated his high opinion of Defoe: &quot;With [Cristiano] Ronaldo gone, he can push to be the [Premier League] top scorer.&quot; After a fine run of form which saw him score seven goals for club and country, Defoe was named Premier League Player of the Month for August 2009. On 12 September 2009, Defoe scored after 38 seconds with an overhead kick against 2008–09 Premier League champions Manchester United in a match which ended in a 3–1 loss for Tottenham, taking his tally for the 2009–10 league season to five goals in five matches. On 23 September 2009, Defoe scored a header during Tottenham&#x27;s 5–1 win over Preston. Defoe scored a goal and was sent off during the match against his former club, Portsmouth.

Defoe scored five goals at White Hart Lane in a 9–1 thrashing of Wigan on 22 November 2009. This included the second-fastest hat-trick in Premier League history, which was scored in seven minutes. In doing so, Defoe became only the third player to score five goals in one Premier League match, after Alan Shearer and Andy Cole. Dimitar Berbatov and Sergio Agüero have subsequently equalled this feat. After the match, Harry Redknapp further asserted his belief that Defoe would go on to be the Premier League&#x27;s top scorer in 2009–10. Redknapp later said that although Wayne Rooney is the best all-round attacking player, Defoe is the best finisher in England and should be a regular for the England national team. On 3 February, Defoe claimed his third hat-trick of the season in an FA Cup fourth-round replay against Leeds United at Elland Road, with Spurs winning 3–1. His rich vein of form continued on 21 February with another goal in the Premier League, against Wigan. Defoe&#x27;s next goal was a penalty in Tottenham&#x27;s win against Chelsea, which itself followed a famous 2–1 win over Arsenal. This took his tally to 24 goals for the season.

====2010–11 season====
Defoe played his part in Tottenham qualifying for the UEFA Champions League group stage, thanks to a controversial goal against Young Boys, where he appeared to use his arm before scoring the second goal of the match, which finished 4–0 to Tottenham. He was injured in the beginning of September when he was on duty with England, He made his comeback in Tottenham&#x27;s 3–2 victory against Arsenal in the North London derby. He won a header which started the attack in which Gareth Bale scored five minutes in the second half to begin the comeback from 2–0 down to a 3–2 victory.

On 26 December 2010, Defoe received a straight red card, his first of the season and first since 17 October 2009, in a match at Aston Villa; his team leading at the time went on to secure the win despite playing over an hour with ten men. Defoe began Tottenham&#x27;s 2010–11 FA Cup campaign with a brace of goals in the third round match at home to Charlton Athletic on 9 January 2011, with Spurs winning 3–0, but in the following round, they were defeated by Fulham.

In the 2010–11 Premier League, Defoe scored his first league goals of the season on 6 March 2011 against Wolverhampton Wanderers, getting the first two for Spurs in a 3–3 draw. He scored his third goal of the 2010–11 season with a long-range shot with his left foot against West Bromwich Albion. This was a triple landmark for Defoe, as it was his 100th Premier League goal as well as his 100th goal scored as a Tottenham player. In addition, it signified the 1,000th goal scored for Tottenham in the Premier League era.

====2011–12 season====
In pre-season, Defoe scored two goals, one coming in a 3–0 win against Orlando Pirates on 23 July, and the other in a 2–1 win against Athletic Bilbao at White Hart Lane on 6 August. Defoe started 2011–12 by scoring in a 5–0 win against Hearts in a UEFA Europa League play-off match on 18 August. His first Premier League goal of the season came in a 2–0 win at Wolves, scoring the second goal after exchanging passes with Niko Kranjčar. Defoe&#x27;s first goal of 2012 came in a 1–0 home win against West Brom, converting a Gareth Bale cross. He scored on the last day of the season against Fulham, the second in a 2–0 win. Defoe ended the season with 17 goals in 38 matches across all competitions; in the Premier League, he scored 11 in 25 appearances, of which only 11 were starts.

====2012–13 season====
Defoe started by scoring on the opening day of the 2012–13 Premier League against Newcastle United in a 2–1 defeat. On 30 August 2012, Defoe signed a new three-year contract with Tottenham. He scored the 200th goal of his club career in a 4–2 defeat to Chelsea on 20 October and on 8 November, he scored a hat-trick in a 3–1 win against Slovenian club Maribor in the Europa League. In doing so, he overtook Teddy Sheringham on Tottenham&#x27;s all-time goalscorers list. On 21 April 2013, Defoe scored his 15th goal of the season in the home match against Manchester City, a 3–1 win. The goal took him level with Alan Gilzean in joint-seventh place on the all-time Tottenham scorers list.

====2013–14 season====
Defoe started 2013–14 as a substitute, with newly signed striker Roberto Soldado starting for Tottenham. Nonetheless, manager André Villas-Boas used him as a first-choice striker for their opening matches in the Europa League, and on 29 August he scored his first goals of the campaign in a 3–0 home win against Dinamo Tbilisi. The result took Tottenham through to the group stages via an 8–0 aggregate victory after winning 5–0 in the first leg.

On 19 September, Defoe scored twice in a 3–0 victory against Tromsø in the Europa League group stages, taking his tally in Europe to within two goals of the record holder, Martin Chivers. On 24 September 2013, Defoe scored another two in a 4–0 win against Aston Villa in the League Cup, which took his tally for Tottenham to 139 goals, moving him past George Hunt as the club&#x27;s fifth-highest scorer of all-time. His goal on 3 October against Anzhi Makhachkala in a 2–0 win took him to one short of the club&#x27;s all-time record of 22 held by Chivers. Two further goals, against Sheriff Tiraspol in two consecutive fixtures in the Europa League, saw Defoe with 23 European goals, one more than Chivers&#x27; previous record as Tottenham&#x27;s highest European goalscorer. Defoe said Chivers had been at the match and had encouraged him to beat his record.

===Toronto FC===
On 10 January 2014, Tottenham announced that Defoe was leaving to join Major League Soccer (MLS) club Toronto FC, effective 28 February 2014. He agreed to a four-year deal worth between £68,000–90,000 per week. Toronto began its pursuit of Defoe the previous October, when the team management – which included Defoe&#x27;s ex-Tottenham teammate Ryan Nelsen – met with him in London, and he received phone calls from rapper Drake, a Toronto native. The transfer also includes an agreement between Tottenham Hotspur and Toronto&#x27;s owners, Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment, involving marketing, merchandise and broadcast rights, as well as a friendly match during Tottenham&#x27;s North American tour in July 2014. Defoe was immediately loaned back to Tottenham until the end of February 2014, with whom he made two more appearances as a substitute.

Defoe debuted with Toronto in their season opener at Seattle Sounders FC on 15 March 2014, scoring both goals in their 2–1 victory. On 31 August 2014, Toronto FC called a press conference to fire manager Nelsen; during the press conference, the general manager Tim Bezbatchenko was non-committal on Defoe&#x27;s future at the club, implying that the player might be unsettled and that the club would entertain offers in excess of the £6 million paid for the striker. He said, &quot;We&#x27;re speaking with him [Defoe] and then we&#x27;ll make a decision. We&#x27;ll discuss it over the next 24 hours.&quot;

===Sunderland===
====2014–15 season====
On 16 January 2015, Defoe joined Premier League club Sunderland after agreeing to a three-and-a-half-year deal, as part of a player exchange deal sending Jozy Altidore to Toronto FC, after completing only 11 months of his four-year deal with Toronto. He made his Sunderland debut the following day against former club Tottenham. Defoe started the match but was goalless when he was substituted after 75 minutes, ending his record of scoring on his first appearance for every club he has played for. Defoe scored his first Sunderland goal on his home debut in a 2–0 victory over Burnley on 31 January 2015. His second goal came the following week on 7 February 2015, where he scored the opening goal in a 1–1 draw away to Swansea City.

On 5 April, he scored the only goal in the Tyne–Wear derby victory over Newcastle with a 22-yard volley to end a sequence of eight matches without a win, and their first victory under the management of Dick Advocaat. The emotion of scoring the goal caused him to cry. On 9 May, Defoe scored his fourth goal of the season in a 2–0 win against Everton at Goodison Park, a result which moved Sunderland out of the relegation zone and gave Everton their first home defeat of 2015.

====2015–16 season====
On the opening day of the 2015–16 Premier League, Defoe scored in a 4–2 loss at Leicester City, meaning he had scored in 15 Premier League seasons. On 25 August, he scored a hat-trick in a 6–3 home win over Exeter City in the second round of the League Cup. Defoe then scored twice in Sunderland&#x27;s opening match of 2016, a 3–1 defeat of Aston Villa on 2 January. In the team&#x27;s next league fixture, he scored a hat-trick against Swansea City in a 4–2 win at the Liberty Stadium. On 6 February, Defoe scored an 89th-minute equaliser against Liverpool as Sunderland came from 2–0 down to draw the match. On 16 March, Defoe opened the scoring away to Newcastle as the Tyne–Wear derby was drawn 1–1.

On 16 April 2016, Defoe scored Sunderland&#x27;s second goal in a crucial 3–0 away victory over fellow strugglers Norwich, which left Sunderland one point from safety. On 7 May 2016, Defoe scored the winning goal against Chelsea, moving Sunderland out of the bottom three, and taking his Premier League tally to 15 for the season. Defoe was part of the Sunderland squad on the matchday when they secured their Premier League status with a 3–0 home win over Everton on 11 May 2016.

Defoe ended the season as Sunderland&#x27;s top scorer with 15 league goals, and was also named the club&#x27;s player of the season. On 9 June, Defoe signed a new contract with Sunderland, committing his future to the club until 2019.

====2016–17 season====
On 13 August 2016, the opening day of the 2016–17 Premier League, Defoe scored in a 2–1 loss at Manchester City, meaning he has now scored in 16 Premier League seasons. On 5 November 2016, Defoe scored the winning goal from the penalty spot as 10-man Sunderland came from behind to win at Bournemouth, their first league win of the season. On 19 November 2016, Defoe scored his 150th Premier League goal in a 3–0 home win against Hull City, becoming the joint seventh highest goal scorer in Premier League history. On 2 January 2017, Defoe scored twice from the penalty spot as Sunderland came from behind to draw at home to Liverpool.

In January 2017, with Sunderland lying in the relegation zone, Defoe was linked with a return to former club West Ham United. However, Sunderland rejected a bid in the region of £6 million, with manager David Moyes describing Defoe as &quot;priceless&quot;. On 4 February 2017, Defoe scored twice in first half stoppage time in a 4–0 away victory at Crystal Palace to move on to 14 league goals for the season.

===AFC Bournemouth===
In April 2017, Defoe hinted that he may leave Sunderland, if the club were to be relegated at the end of the 2016–17 Premier League. He was linked with a possible transfer to Newcastle United, and potential returns to former clubs Bournemouth and West Ham United. Sunderland&#x27;s relegation was confirmed later that month. On 23 June, it was confirmed that Defoe had signed a contract with Bournemouth on a free transfer, leaving Sunderland on 1 July. He had previously played for the club in the 2000–01 season, on loan from West Ham United.

On 16 September 2017, Defoe scored the winning goal and his first goal since his return to Bournemouth in a 2–1 home win against Brighton, providing the team with its first victory in the 2017–18 Premier League season, meaning he had scored in 17 different Premier League seasons.

===Rangers===
After making only eight appearances for Bournemouth in the 2018–19 season, Defoe joined Scottish Premiership club Rangers on 6 January 2019 on an 18-month loan, with two recall clauses inserted into the deal, which could have been activated in July 2019 or January 2020. On 23 January 2019, he scored a debut goal for Rangers against Kilmarnock, which meant he had scored a debut goal for 5 of his last 7 clubs. After scoring in a game on 27 September 2019 he was involved in a car accident.

On 25 January 2020, it was announced that Defoe had signed a pre-contract agreement with Rangers, and would join the club permanently on a one-year deal, at the expiry of his Bournemouth contract in June 2020.

Defoe joined Rangers permanently in the summer transfer window of the 2020–21 season. He scored his 300th career club goal, against Livingston on 25 October 2020.

On 8 June 2021, Defoe signed a new one-year deal with Rangers to keep him at the club. As part of the contract, he will also become a coach at the club. On 15 November 2021, following the departure of manager, Steven Gerrard from Rangers to Aston Villa, Defoe was named as part of a four-man caretaker team responsible for leading the club during the pursuit of a new permanent head coach. On 12 January 2022, Defoe departed Rangers.

===Return to Sunderland===
On 31 January 2022, Defoe re-signed for Sunderland on a short-term deal until the end of the 2021–22 season. On 24 March 2022 he announced his retirement from professional football.

==International career==
===Youth===
Defoe was capped by England at two youth levels, earning eight caps for the under-16s and seven caps for the under-18s. Defoe&#x27;s form for Bournemouth in the 2000–01 season saw him selected for the England under-21 team to play Mexico in May 2001, and he marked his debut with the second goal as England U21s won 3–0. He went on to gain 23 caps for England at under-21 level, scoring seven goals.

===2006 FIFA World Cup===
Defoe debuted for the senior England team in a 1–0 defeat to Sweden in March 2004, coming on as an early substitute for the injured Darius Vassell. England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson singled out Defoe&#x27;s display for praise in an otherwise poor performance by England, saying, &quot;Jermain Defoe did very well – I liked what I saw. He showed that he can do very well even in international football and that he is technically very good. Jermain is quick and he knows where the goal is.&quot; He was not however selected for the England squad to take part in UEFA Euro 2004.

He made his first start for England in a 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying match against Poland in September 2004, scoring in a 2–1 win. Eriksson again paid tribute to Defoe, saying, &quot;Jermain is a great talent. It couldn&#x27;t have been much better for him. He did very well. He scored one goal and created other chances as well. He is a great player who will always score goals.&quot;

Despite appearing regularly for England in FIFA World Cup qualifying matches and friendly matches, Defoe was not named in the provisional England squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany and named only on a five-man standby list. He joined the squad for training in Germany, but returned to England when Wayne Rooney was cleared to play after having suffered a foot injury in April. He confessed that he was baffled by his omission, saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve been involved in every squad for the last two years and feel I&#x27;ve played a part in helping us to qualify. I have never felt fitter and sharper than I was in training and believe I could have scored goals in the tournament. It&#x27;s a strange decision and everybody I speak to thinks so as well.&quot; Eriksson explained why Defoe was not selected for the England squad: &quot;Jermain had a very bad season. I don&#x27;t think he deserved to go to the World Cup.&quot;

===2010 FIFA World Cup===
Steve McClaren, who took over as England manager after the FIFA World Cup, selected Defoe for England in his first match, a friendly against Greece in August 2006. Defoe continued to be selected and to appear for England in UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying matches and friendly matches.

Defoe was initially omitted from Fabio Capello&#x27;s first squad with the new manager insisting he would only select players who were playing regular club football. One day after scoring on his Portsmouth debut, Defoe was recalled to the England squad to replace the injured Gabriel Agbonlahor. Defoe took his international goals tally up to five in the Caribbean on 1 June 2008 when he scored twice against Trinidad and Tobago and in the process staking a claim for a more regular place in the international team.

Defoe scored his first competitive international goal of 2008 with the final goal in England&#x27;s 5–1 win over Kazakhstan on 11 October 2008 after coming on as a late substitute for Wayne Rooney. He also scored two goals in three minutes against Andorra in a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier.

His 2009–10 season got off to the perfect start as he came from the bench to score both goals in the 2–2 draw against the Netherlands at the Amsterdam Arena on 12 August 2009 and was announced as man of the match.

On 23 June 2010, he scored the only goal in England&#x27;s third group stage match against Slovenia in the 2010 FIFA World Cup. This goal gave England the win they needed to progress into the Round of 16.

===UEFA Euro 2012 and 2014 FIFA World Cup===
Defoe opened up the scoring for England&#x27;s UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying campaign against Bulgaria, volleying home from the six-yard box after a cross from Ashley Cole, whose initial effort was saved by the Bulgarian goalkeeper Nikolay Mihaylov. Defoe went on to score his first international hat-trick, which was the first ever at the new Wembley. Defoe was called up to the England squad to face Wales on 26 March 2011, though he served as an unused substitute. Defoe was named as a member of the England squad for UEFA Euro 2012.

Defoe did not play for the full 90 minutes in any of his England appearances until 11 September 2012 where he played the entire match against Ukraine.

Defoe started England&#x27;s first 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying match, a 5–0 away win against Moldova and scored his 17th goal for England, tying him with David Beckham.

Defoe was not included in the 23-man squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Defoe believes that he &quot;likely won&#x27;t ever get over the decision&quot;, and stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever be at peace with it.&quot; However, he was named as one of seven players on &quot;standby&quot;.

Defoe&#x27;s form in the 2015–16 season, where he helped Sunderland avoid relegation with 15 goals, led to calls for him to be included in the England squad for UEFA Euro 2016. He was not, however, named in manager Roy Hodgson&#x27;s 26-man preliminary squad, and expressed his disappointment at his omission.

===2017===
After over three years away from international football, Defoe was recalled to the England squad in March 2017 by manager Gareth Southgate for a friendly match against Germany and a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying match against Lithuania. On 26 March, Defoe returned to the first team, against Lithuania. Ahead of captain, Joe Hart, Defoe led the team onto the pitch with terminally ill child, Bradley Lowery, a Sunderland supporter who suffered from neuroblastoma. England won the match 2–0 with Defoe scoring the first goal.

==Influences and goal celebrations==
In a 2018 interview with Sky Sports, Defoe spoke about the influence of former Arsenal striker Ian Wright on his career, which included being inspired by his goal celebrations. He explained that his own favourite celebration is outstretching both arms straight, before stating when scoring a goal &quot;you just want to go mad&quot;.

==Coaching career==
On 12 August 2022, Defoe returned to Tottenham Hotspur as club ambassador and an academy coach. Appointed as coach of the under-18&#x27;s, Defoe said he aims to inspire more black coaches and managers. He left the role in July 2024 to concentrate on a managerial career.

==Personal life==
Defoe is a practising Roman Catholic. In 2017 he adopted a vegan diet in order to prolong his football career. He is teetotal.

On 24 April 2009, his 26-year-old half-brother, Jade Defoe, died of head injuries following an assault in Leytonstone, London. On 7 June 2012, his father, Jimmy Defoe, died after a long battle with throat cancer. Defoe was with the England squad ahead of UEFA Euro 2012 at the time, and returned home from Poland upon receiving the news, but rejoined the squad on 9 June, two days before the opening match and played against France as a 77th-minute substitute.

Whilst playing for Sunderland, Defoe befriended Bradley Lowery, a terminally-ill six-year-old fan with neuroblastoma, describing their relationship as the &quot;highlight of his season&quot;. Lowery was named &#x27;Child of Courage&#x27; at the Pride of North East Awards in May 2017; Defoe attended the award ceremony, saying, &quot;As a person he has changed me because of what he&#x27;s going through at such a young age&quot;. Lowery died on 7 July 2017, at the age of 6.

Defoe was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2018 Birthday Honours for services to the Jermain Defoe Foundation, a charitable foundation he founded in 2013.

<doc id="1319791" wikidata="Q3437821" url="?curid=1319791" title="Rock music of Canada">
<text>Rock music of Canada is a wide and diverse part of the general music of Canada, beginning with American and British style rock and roll in the mid-20th century. Since then Canada has had a considerable impact on the development of the modern popular music called rock. Canada has produced many of the genre&#x27;s most significant groups and performers, while contributing substantively to the development of the most popular subgenres, which include pop rock, progressive rock, country rock, folk rock, hard rock, punk rock, heavy metal and indie rock.

==Background==
Since before Canada&#x27;s emergence as a nation in 1867, the country has produced its own composers, musicians and ensembles. From the 17th century onward, Canada has developed a music infrastructure that includes concert halls, conservatories, academies, performing arts centres, record companies, radio stations and national music video television channels. The success of the gramophone at the beginning of the 20th century allowed Canadian songwriters to broaden their potential audiences. Following quickly on the gramophone&#x27;s spread came World War I. The war was the catalyst for the writing and recording of large numbers of Canadian-written popular songs, some of which achieved lasting international commercial success. The 1920s saw Canada&#x27;s first radio stations, this allowed Canadian songwriters to contribute some of the most famous popular music of the early 20th century.

Canada has produced a number of notable international recording artists who appeared on the &quot;Billboard&quot; record sales chart called Hit Parade first published in 1936. Among them was the World War II era bandleader, Guy Lombardo, who with his brother has sold an estimated 250 million phonograph records during their lifetimes. Over the course of his career, which began in 1944, Montreal&#x27;s jazz virtuoso Oscar Peterson released over 200 recordings, won seven Grammy Awards, and received many other awards and honors. Oscar Peterson is considered to have been one of the greatest pianists of all time. Nova Scotia-born and raised Hank Snow who signed with RCA Victor in 1936 and went on to become one of America&#x27;s most innovative country music superstars.

==History==
===1950s===
Rock and roll arose in the United States in the late 1940s after World War II, from a combination of the rhythms of African American blues, country and gospel music. Though elements of rock and roll can be heard in Canadian country records of the 1930s–1940s, and in American blues records from the 1920s, rock and roll did not acquire its name until the 1950s. &quot;Rock&quot; or its forerunners electric blues (Chicago blues) and rhythm and blues (Jump blues) was first heard in the late 1940s by Canadians who were living close enough to the American border to tune into American radio station broadcasts.

In 1951, Cleveland, Ohio disc jockey Alan Freed began playing rhythm and blues music for a multi-racial audience, and is credited with first using the phrase &quot;rock and roll&quot; to describe the musical sound of the Doo-wop vocal groups and the rockabilly singers who emerged in the 1950s. The Four Lads, from Toronto, were one of the first groups to capitalize on this sound and become a prominent act in the Canadian rhythm and blues scene, producing their first hit in 1952 called &quot;Mocking Bird&quot;. Their most famous hit was &quot;Moments to Remember&quot;, which first reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine charts on September 3, 1955. Emerging in the mid-1950s, on near equal-footing to American popular music, Canadian popular music enjoyed considerable success at home and abroad.

By 1954 the name &quot;rock and roll&quot; had become the common name of the popular music of the day. Rhythm and blues (R&amp;B coined in 1949) was too broad a term, because R&amp;B was a category that included most forms of race music, which generally had adult-based lyrics. The Crew-Cuts, The Diamonds and The Four Lads would emerge from this new marketing of rhythm and blues to appeal to a white audience leaving an indelible mark on the Doo-wop days. Often Canadian records of this period were simply covers of pop hits, and rhythm and blues oldies. 1958 saw Canada produced its first rock and roll teen idol Paul Anka, who went to New York City where he auditioned for ABC with the song, &quot;Diana&quot;. This song brought Anka instant stardom and he became the first Canadian to have a number one on the US Billboard charts in the rock and roll era. &quot;Diana&quot; is one of the best selling 45s in music history. He followed up with four songs that made it into the Top 20 in 1958, making him one of the biggest teen idols of the time.

Most Canadians with successful recording careers in the 1950s had moved to the US, where the population level and media exposure would eclipse that of Canada. Ronnie Hawkins, an Arkansas born rockabilly singer, moved to Canada in 1958, becoming a prominent figure in Canadian blues and rock devoting his life to popularizing Canadian musicians. He formed a backing band called The Hawks, which produced some of the earliest Canadian rock stars. Among them were the members of The Band, who began touring with Bob Dylan in 1966, and then struck out on their own in 1968.

===1960s===
As the late fifties gave way to the sixties, stars of the previous decade were still producing hits, but they were quickly losing ground as they struggled to find material that clicked with this new and energetic generation. However, &quot;The Stroll&quot; continued to be a popular dance craze well into the &#x27;60s alongside dances like &quot;The Twist&quot; and &quot;The Mashed Potato&quot;. The first Canadian-made and produced rock recording to achieve international popularity was &quot;Clap Your Hands&quot; in 1960 by a Montreal quartet, The Beaumarks. Shortly thereafter, they appeared on &quot;American Bandstand&quot; and a charity concert at Carnegie Hall. Bobby Curtola from Port Arthur, Ontario had several songs on the Canadian music charts beginning with &quot;Hand In Hand With You&quot; in 1960. His biggest chart-topper came in 1962 with the song &quot;Fortune Teller&quot;, which was also successful internationally. In 1966, he won an RPM Gold Leaf Award (The Gold Leaf Awards, which were in effect the first Juno Awards) for being the first Canadian to have a gold album. The CHUM Chart debuted on May 27, 1957, under the name CHUM&#x27;s Weekly Hit Parade, to 1986, and was the longest-running Top 40 chart in Canada.

During the 1960s, Canadian music was regarded with indifference and Canadian recording artists were forced to turn toward the United States to establish their careers. In 1960 Walt Grealis of Toronto started in the music business with Apex Records, the Ontario distributor for Compo Company (founded in 1918), Canada&#x27;s first independent record company that today is part of Universal. He later joined London Records, where he worked until February 1964, when he then established &quot;RPM&quot; weekly trade magazine. From the first issue of &quot;RPM Weekly&quot; on February 24, 1964, to its final issue on November 13, 2000, &quot;RPM&quot; was the defining charts in Canada. The popularity of US rock on the two Canadian charts led to many existing groups, especially those devoted to country music, to change styles or to incorporate some rock style hits in their repertoires.

Country rock and folk rock singers such as Gordon Lightfoot, Joni Mitchell, Leonard Cohen, Denny Doherty (of The Mamas &amp; the Papas), David Clayton-Thomas (of Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears), Andy Kim, Zal Yanovsky (of The Lovin&#x27; Spoonful), John Kay (of Steppenwolf), and Ian &amp; Sylvia found international audiences. One important example was a Winnipeg band called Chad Allan &amp; the Expressions, which had a 1965 hit with a version of Johnny Kidd and the Pirates&#x27; &quot;Shakin&#x27; All Over&quot;. They would eventually evolve into The Guess Who, the first Canadian rock group to have a No.1 hit that reached the top on the Canadian Singles Chart and the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at the same time, with &quot;American Woman&quot; in 1970. Their success paved the way for a new wave of Canadian singer-songwriters, including Stan Rogers, Murray McLauchlan, Bruce Cockburn and Willie P. Bennett.

Unlike the generation before, the late sixties American and British counterculture and hippie movements had diverted rock towards psychedelic rock, heavy metal, progressive rock and many other styles, most dominated by socially and politically incisive lyrics. The music was an attempt to reflect upon the events of the time—civil rights, the growing unrest in America over the war in Vietnam, and the rise of feminism. In many instances, the &quot;message&quot; within the song was simplistic or banal. Although only two of the five original members of Steppenwolf were born in Canada (Jerry Edmonton and Goldy McJohn), the band was among the biggest in Canadian music in the 1960s and 1970s. German born frontman, John Kay, would later become a Canadian citizen and was the only member of Steppenwolf to be inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame. Steppenwolf is most famous for the songs &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot;, &quot;Magic Carpet Ride&quot; and &quot;The Pusher&quot;. &quot;Born to be Wild&quot; is the group&#x27;s biggest hit, making it to No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1968, becoming one of the 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and becoming one of Rolling Stone&#x27;s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In 1969, drummer Corky Laing, from Montreal, joined pioneering American hard rock band Mountain. Another one of the most prominent players of the late 1960s and early 1970s rock scene was Neil Young, who was a member of the folk rock band Buffalo Springfield, before joining Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young. Young also recorded music with Crazy Horse throughout his solo career. The song &quot;Ohio&quot;, written by Neil Young and recorded with CSNY, was in response to political events of the time and has since become an America social icon of the period. &quot;Ohio&quot; was written about the death of four students at Kent State University. The students were shot by Ohio National Guardsmen during an anti-war protest on the campus in May 1970.

===1970s===
With the introduction of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission&#x27;s (CRTC) broadcast regulations in 1970, the Canadian recording industry made rock a major focus of its activity. In 1971, the Canadian content law was passed ensuring Canadian artists weren&#x27;t overrun by American media outlets. The Juno Awards began as a reader poll conducted by Canadian music industry trade magazine RPM Weekly in December 1964. A similar balloting process continued until 1970 when the RPM Gold Leaf Awards, as they were then known, were changed to the Juno Awards. The first Juno Award ceremony was held in 1975 and played a role in addressing the concern about Canadian content. This led to increased production and with the international popularity of The Guess Who and Neil Young at the end of the 1960s, opened markets outside Canada to the country&#x27;s musicians. Success abroad usually ensured success in Canada. The early 1970s were a golden age for Canadian music. Many performers from the late 1960s came to the forefront in the following years, among them The Bells and Andy Kim from Montreal, Chilliwack from Vancouver, Five Man Electrical Band from Ottawa, Lighthouse from Toronto, Wednesday from Oshawa, and The Stampeders from Calgary.

With the introduction in the mid-1970s period of rock music on FM radio stations, where it was common practice to program extended performances, musicians were no longer limited to songs of three minutes&#x27; duration as dictated by AM stations. The still nascent Canadian music industry had little independent music media and a limited distribution infrastructure. Two internationally renowned bands to arise from this industry were Bachman–Turner Overdrive and Rush, both featuring acclaimed managers. Bachman–Turner Overdrive&#x27;s manager, Bruce Allen, went on to produce Loverboy and eventually manage such major pop stars as Bryan Adams and Anne Murray. Randy Bachman (formerly of The Guess Who) released his new band&#x27;s first album under the name Bachman–Turner Overdrive in spring 1973, which won two Juno Awards despite being largely ignored in the US. Their second album &quot;Bachman–Turner Overdrive II&quot; hit No. 4 in the U.S. BTO II was certified gold in eight countries. It also yielded their best-remembered and most enduring single, &quot;Takin&#x27; Care of Business&quot;, written by Randy Bachman. 1974&#x27;s album &quot;Not Fragile&quot; went straight to the top of the charts, and the single &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Seen Nothing Yet&quot; hit No. 1 in the U.S. and No. 2 in the UK. One of the largest exports to date is Rush, that boasts 25 gold records and 14 platinum (3 multi-platinum) records, making them one of the best-selling rock bands in history by 2005. Rush currently place third behind The Beatles and The Rolling Stones for the most consecutive gold and platinum albums by a rock band.

Following the hard rock scene a small wave of acts emerged from all across Canada, including Moxy, A Foot in Coldwater and Triumph from Toronto, Trooper from Vancouver, and April Wine from Halifax. April Wine experienced massive success in Canada from the early-1970s to the mid-1980s, but also had some success in United States and Britain, though many music critics have felt their music has been overshadowed by more successful bands. Canadian cultural critics have noted that the late 1970s were a lesser era for Canadian music. Many of the acts who had defined the earlier half of the decade were no longer recording, and the new artists emerging in this era simply didn&#x27;t seem to be able to capture the Canadian pop &quot;zeitgeist&quot; in the same way. Nevertheless, a number of established Canadian acts, including Rush, Bachman–Turner Overdrive, Frank Marino &amp; Mahogany Rush, Bruce Cockburn, April Wine, Pat Travers, FM, and Neil Young, remained influential and recorded some of their most popular material of all during this period, and former &quot;The Guess Who&quot; lead singer Burton Cummings emerged as a popular solo artist in soft rock. Also notable is folk rocker Gordon Lightfoot&#x27;s &quot;The Wreck of the &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;&quot;, a song written in commemoration of the sinking of the bulk carrier SS &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; on Lake Superior on 10 November 1975. The incident is the most famous disaster in the history of Great Lakes shipping. The single reached #2 on the Billboard pop charts in November 1976, making it Lightfoot&#x27;s second most successful (in terms of chart position) single, with &quot;Sundown&quot; having reached number one in 1974. Another of this period&#x27;s most influential and popular rock bands, Heart, resulted from the collaboration of two sisters from Seattle with a supporting band from Vancouver. Some popular francophone bands of the time included the rock group Beau Dommage from Montreal led by Michel Rivard and the progressive rock group Harmonium also of Montreal. Artists like The Kings, Prism, Crowbar, Nick Gilder, Ian Thomas, Goddo, Harlequin, Mahogany Rush, Moxy, Streetheart, Max Webster and Ironhorse saw their greatest success during the late &#x27;70s period.

Many acts have had equally vital, if less remunerative careers outside the mainstream in punk rock and its derivations, generally distinguished by a tendency to extremes of one sort or another. Whether in instrumental intensity, lyric content, or performance style Canadian pop music evolved with the times, reflecting worldwide trends. In the late 1970s, as punk rock, disco, and the emerging new wave ruled the landscape, Canadian groups such as D.O.A., The Viletones, The Forgotten Rebels, Rough Trade, Diodes, Teenage Head, The Demics, The Young Canadians and Subhumans emerged and continued in the 1980s with popular bands like SNFU, Dayglo Abortions and Nomeansno. Rough Trade were particularly notable for their 1980 hit &quot;High School Confidential&quot;, one of the first explicitly lesbian-themed pop songs to crack the Top 40 anywhere in the world.

===1980s===
Things changed course in the 1980s, the changing fast-paced culture was accompanied by an explosion in youth culture. Until the mid-1960s, little attention was paid to rock by Canadian daily newspapers except as news or novelty. With the introduction during the 1970s of the &quot;rock critic&quot;, coverage began to rival that of any other music. The 1980s saw Canada support and promote many of its own talent in pursuit of true originality. Canadian rock generally had been discouraged by market forces before the 1980s, in particular the need to conform to the taste of a Canadian audience that has had its standards and expectations formed by constant exposure to US and British acts for the prior three decades. The popularity of Chilliwack, for example, rose dramatically after the band turned from the experimental nature of its first few LPs to a mainstream pop style consistent with the US style. The band first hit the Top 10 charts in Canada with 1973s &quot;Lonesome Mary&quot;, but are perhaps best remembered for three America hit songs from the 1980s &quot;My Girl (Gone Gone Gone)&quot;, &quot;I Believe&quot; and &quot;Whatcha Gonna Do&quot;. Even though those three hits were their only popular singles in the US, the band has released over a dozen albums with 23 Canadian hit singles. Bill Henderson, the founder of the band, was musical director for the Canadian edition of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; from 1989 to 1995. Henderson also acted as director of the Canadian Association of Recording Arts and Sciences (CARAS) and as president of the Songwriters Association of Canada (SOCAN).

Music videos assumed a major role in the promotion of pop rock recordings in 1980s for US exposure. Videos produced many mainstream pop-rockers that saw huge success in and outside of Canada. Success in the larger US market remained the major goal of most, if not all, post-1970 Canadian rock acts; a goal in fact reached with some greater or lesser degree of consistency by several, among them Bryan Adams, Kim Mitchell former guitarist and vocalist of Max Webster, Aldo Nova, Loverboy, Saga, k.d. lang, Red Rider, Corey Hart, Alannah Myles, Lee Aaron, Tom Cochrane, Honeymoon Suite, Haywire, Doug and the Slugs, Payola$ and Glass Tiger. As well, the era produced the country cowpunk of k.d. lang. Bryan Adams would emerge as Canada&#x27;s superstar of the 80s having been awarded the Order of Canada, and the Order of British Columbia and inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame in 1998 for his contribution to popular music and his philanthropic work. Also notable is Loverboy who accumulated numerous hit songs in Canada and the United States, making four multi-platinum albums. The band&#x27;s hit singles, particularly &quot;Lovin&#x27; Every Minute of It&quot; and &quot;Working for the Weekend&quot; have become hard rock staples, and are still heard on classic rock radio stations across the US and Canada. Loverboy received five Juno Awards, Canada&#x27;s highest award for music, in one year, a record that still stands today. The band would later receive an additional three Juno Awards, bringing their total to eight, which at that time was most received by a single group or individual aside from Bryan Adams.

Music videos became more and more important as a marketing tool for Canadian bands by the mid-1980s with the debut of MuchMusic in 1984 and MusiquePlus in 1986. Now both English and French Canadian musicians had outlets to promote their music through video in Canada. The networks were not just an opportunity for artists to get their videos played—the networks created VideoFACT, a fund to help emerging artists &quot;produce&quot; their videos.
New wave, glam rock and heavy metal had become the most popular style of rock in the mid-1980s. Acts such as Platinum Blonde, Helix, Toronto, Parachute Club, The Box, Strange Advance, Spoons, Trans-X, Rational Youth, Men Without Hats, Norman Iceberg, Images in Vogue, Headpins, Sheriff, Frozen Ghost, Teenage Head, Idle Eyes, Eight Seconds, The Northern Pikes, Brighton Rock and Martha and the Muffins were along for the new Canadian music video ride. Although many of them, in fact, were only &quot;one-hit wonders&quot;.

In the late 1980s, the Canadian recording industry continued to produce popular acts such as Blue Rodeo. Alternative rock also emerged as an influential genre, with independent artists such as The Tragically Hip, 54-40, Sarah McLachlan, Spirit of the West, The Waltons, Cowboy Junkies, The Pursuit of Happiness, and The Grapes of Wrath all gaining their first widespread attention during this time. Also a new wave of Canadian thrash metal bands began to rise up and earned a dedicated following like Anvil, Razor, Voivod, Sacrifice, Sword, Exciter and Annihilator, Canadian metal&#x27;s biggest selling artist, with sales of close to 2 million units worldwide, with industrial bands Skinny Puppy and Front Line Assembly in the mix, as well as black/death metal band Blasphemy.

Canada&#x27;s most successful rock artists by the late 1980s worked in a relatively generic, mainstream pop rock style of the day. Some from the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, may be ascribed to more specific substyles like Colin James, David Wilcox and Jeff Healey to blues-rock (see Canadian blues). With Stompin&#x27; Tom Connors, Great Big Sea and Ashley MacIsaac to folk rock, that saw the start for both styles, a very large following all across Canada. Most notable would be Stompin&#x27; Tom Connors who typically wrote about Canadian lore and history, some of Connors&#x27; better-known songs include Big Joe Mufferaw, The Black Donnellys, Reesor Crossing Tragedy, Sudbury Saturday Night and The Hockey Song (aka &quot;The Good Old Hockey Game&quot;), that is frequently played over sound systems at National Hockey League (NHL) games in both Canada and the United States.

===1990s===

At the start of the 1990s, Canadian rock took a distinctive turn. Just as artists from the 1970s competed with disco, artists from the 1990s were competing with Canadian hip hop and American hip hop on the Video and Radio charts. Glam metal and arena rock had lost its position as Hip hop, alternative rock and grunge became the new sound of the next generation. Canadian publications devoted to Canadian rock and pop music, either exclusively or in tandem with more general editorial content directed to young readers, was expanding rapidly in the 1990s. It was a decade of incredible nationalism, at least as far as English-Canadian music was concerned. The 1971 CRTC rules (25% Canadian content on Canadian radio, increased to 30% in the 1980s) finally came into full effect and by the end of the decade, radio stations would have to play 35% Canadian content. This led to an explosion of Canadian bands ruling the Canadian airwaves unlike any era before. This includes The Headstones, The Tea Party, Matthew Good Band, Moist, Sloan, The Gandharvas, Change of Heart, Skydiggers, Eric&#x27;s Trip, Limblifter, Salmonblaster, supergarage, The Misunderstood, Shyne Factory, Doughboys, Crash Test Dummies, The Lowest of the Low, 13 Engines, Odds, I Mother Earth, Big Sugar, Glueleg, Age of Electric, Rymes with Orange, Mudgirl, Strapping Young Lad, Bif Naked, Rheostatics, The Watchmen, Moxy Früvous, Rusty, Our Lady Peace, The Philosopher Kings, Junkhouse, Wide Mouth Mason, Pure, Thrush Hermit, cub, The Killjoys, Sandbox, Treble Charger, Big Wreck, The Weakerthans, Propagandhi and The Planet Smashers. Although many of them have not been overly successful in the United States, they remain extremely popular in Canada having much more vitality than their contemporaries from other countries.

The Barenaked Ladies brought a spotlight on to the Canadian indie market when their album sales began to steamroll based simply on word of mouth and their live shows. &quot;The Yellow Tape&quot;, released in 1991, became the first indie release by any band to achieve platinum status (100,000 copies) in Canada. The album &quot;Stunt&quot; became their greatest success, buoyed by &quot;One Week&quot;, which coincidentally spent &quot;one week&quot; at the number one spot on the storied Billboard Hot 100. The Tragically Hip are also noteworthy; the band had signed a long-term record deal with MCA in 1987, but were largely unrecognized until the release of &quot;Up to Here&quot; in 1989. The Hip went on to establish themselves as one of the most influential bands in Canada. They never had a major breakthrough in the United States, but their Canadian fan base alone was enough to sustain a long and healthy career featuring continuing stadium tours. The Hip achieved a record for most number one debuts on the Canadian Albums Chart with a total of eight albums. They were inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame, Royal Conservatory of Music, have won over a dozen Juno Awards from more than thirty nominations, Our Lady Peace, from Toronto were one of the most successful Canadian rock groups of the 1990s; their 1997 effort &quot;Clumsy&quot; was certified Diamond in Canada and going Platinum in the U.S., which was an uncommon feat for Canadian rock groups at that time.

In 1996, VideoFACT launched PromoFACT, a funding program to help new artists produce electronic press kits and websites. This helped Indie rock, that would see a new dominant phase in the mid-1990s just as rock and roll was starting to be a predominant force in the Canadian charts once again. Indie rock was never supposed to be mainstream, but this is the path it took by the end of the decade. Musically, the late 1990s saw the rock genres of the early 1990s completely grow apart rather than fuse. Each of the genres multiplied and evolved in a fashion largely independent of the others. Perhaps the most dramatic change in lifestyle affected the girls. They were the daughters of the women who had fought for emancipation and equality in the 1960s.

Canadian women by the end of the decade enjoyed greater international commercial success than ever before in the popular music field. As Alannah Myles, Lisa Dalbello and Lee Aaron had a decade earlier, four women in particular rose out of the 1990s, setting new pinnacles of success in terms financial, critical, and in their immediate and strong influences on their respective genres: Sarah McLachlan, Céline Dion, Alanis Morissette and Shania Twain. Alanis Morissette kicked off another revolution in Canadian music, launching an era in which Canadian women like Avril Lavigne would rule the pop charts worldwide. Quebec-born singer Celine Dion is the best-selling Canadian artist of all time; when her 1997 album &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot; was released in Canada, it broke the record for the highest opening weekly sales for any album, selling 230,212 copies, a record which still stands. Alanis Morissette, along with Shania Twain, are the only Canadian artists, male or female to have sold two million units in Canada, receiving the Double diamond award Other female Canadian musicians have achieved international success in the highly competitive world of popular music, including Joni Mitchell, Ginette Reno, Diane Dufresne, Diana Krall, Avril Lavigne, Loreena McKennitt, Amanda Marshall, Holly Cole, Chantal Kreviazuk, Diane Tell, Jann Arden, Deborah Cox, Sarah Harmer, Susan Aglukark, Melissa Auf der Maur, Emily Haines, Kittie, Bif Naked, Nelly Furtado, Colleen Rennison and Feist.

===2000s===

The early first decade of the 21st century was dominated by post-grunge and continued to see the expansion of alternative rock, pop-punk, hard rock, and indie rock both artistically and commercially. The main musical phenomenon was the emergence of a new generation of singer songwriters that were the direct consequence of the previous generation&#x27;s intellectual ambitions. The biggest factor that has contributed to the resurgence of rock music in the first decade of the 21st century is the rise of paid digital downloads. The vast majority of songs bought on paid download sites are singles bought from full albums; songs that are bought on a song-by-song basis off artist&#x27;s albums are considered sales of singles, even though they have no official single for purchase. The boom of independent music at the turn of the millennium changed the dynamics of the music industry. At about the same time, the CD (cheap to manufacture) replaced the vinyl album and cassette tapes (expensive to manufacture). Shortly thereafter, the Internet allowed musicians to directly distribute their music, thus bypassing the selection of the old-fashioned &quot;record label&quot;. Canada&#x27;s music industry has suffered as a result of the challenging times for the better part of the last decade. Canada joined 50 other nations in 2008 to update its Copyright Act, and in doing so aimed to allow artists and others to seek compensation for their work, no matter how it is distributed. In 2010 Canada introduced new copyright legislation. The amended law makes hacking digital locks illegal, but enshrine into law the ability of purchasers to record and copy music from a CD to portable devices.
The wide and diverse sound in 21st century rock has resulted in such acts as The Glorious Sons, Mother Mother, Arkells, Devin Townsend, Strapping Young Lad, Billy Talent, Silverstein, Thornley, Sam Roberts, Joel Plaskett, Avril Lavigne, Cleopatrick, Finger Eleven, Simple Plan, Marianas Trench, Gob, Hot Hot Heat, Immaculate Machine, The New Pornographers, Sum 41, Evans Blue, Parabelle, Three Days Grace, The Trews, Matt Mays &amp; El Torpedo, Alexisonfire, Theory of a Deadman, Protest the Hero, Default, Bedouin Soundclash, Neverending White Lights, Hedley, Tokyo Police Club, Death from Above 1979, Age of Daze, Metric, Broken Social Scene, Monster Truck, The Sheepdogs, Walk Off the Earth, City and Colour, No Sinner, Priestess and PUP.

Arguably the most successful Canadian group of the decade was Nickelback. The album &quot;Silver Side Up&quot; sold over six million copies (6× Platinum) in the United States and 800,000 copies (8× Platinum) in Canada. The band has won multiple Juno Awards, an American Music Award, and a MTV Video Music Award Their hit single &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; reached the top on the Canadian Singles Chart and the Billboard Hot 100 at the same time, making them the second Canadian band to accomplish this, the first being The Guess Who with &quot;American Woman&quot; in 1970. Nickelback has also sold over 50 million albums worldwide, making them the only Canadian rock band to achieve this. Also very notable is Avril Lavigne, who is one of the top-selling artists releasing albums in the United States, with over 10.25 million copies certified by the Recording Industry Association of America.

The end of the decade was notable for a surprising number of ambitious indie rock albums. The Canadian indie rock scene has been the focus of national and international attention in many publications, such as &quot;Spin&quot;, &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Under the Radar&quot;, as well the Canadian edition of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. It can be difficult for an indie group to break through in Canada as there is no nationwide rock station. On the other hand, although rock bands may get some exposure from outlets such as MuchMusic and CBC Radio 3, bands must largely rely on building an audience city by city, as each commercial radio station makes its playlist decisions independently. Similarly, it is more difficult to &quot;travel&quot; nationwide as well due to the vast size, creating regional communities that revolve around major music scenes in cities such as Winnipeg, Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal or Halifax, each with a handful of offshoot suburban town scenes that produce the next wave of fresh bands. Most notable is Arcade Fire, who have won numerous awards, including the 2011 Grammy for Album of the Year, the 2011 Juno Award for Album of the Year, and the 2011 Brit Award for Best International Album for their third studio album, &quot;The Suburbs&quot;.

==French==
In the 1960s, some French Canadians of Quebec were beginning to self-identify as &quot;Québécois&quot; (Quebecers). [See the Quiet Revolution.] The tensions between Quebec and English Canada have, at times, played out on Quebec&#x27;s music scene as well. For example, in 1991, Céline Dion won the Félix award for Best Anglophone Artist for her English-language debut, &quot;Unison&quot;, but she refused the award as she did not view herself as an Anglophone artist. After the controversy caused by this incident, Dion has been careful not to clearly declare herself as either federalist or sovereignist.

Recent Quebec performers include Richard Desjardins, Daniel Boucher, Marie-Chantal Toupin, Éric Lapointe, Vilain Pingouin, Mes Aïeux, Les Trois Accords, Kaïn, Dumas, La Chicane, Les Colocs, Cindy Daniel, Daniel Bélanger, Paul Cargnello, Laurence Jalbert, Jean Leloup, Celine Dion, Les Stups, Dan Bigras, Isabelle Boulay and more recently Cœur de pirate. Some bands, such as Les Cowboys Fringants have known success in Europe (primarily in France) while Karkwa, Vulgaires Machins and Malajube are also recognized elsewhere in Canada. In 2003, TVA began to broadcast &quot;Star Académie&quot;, a Québécois version of a French reality music competition, several new artists including Marie-Élaine Thibert, Marie-Mai, Émily Bégin and Stéphanie Lapointe became better known among francophones after participation in the reality show. Charlotte Cardin, a finalist on TVA&#x27;s singing competition &quot;La Voix&quot; in 2013, went on to critical and commercial success in pop and rock in French and English Canada.

Quebec has also produced a number of significant Anglophone artists, including Arcade Fire, Patrick Watson, The Dears, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Riverbeds, Stars, The Stills, The Unicorns, Wolf Parade, Rufus Wainwright, Sam Roberts, Paul Cargnello, We Are Wolves, Corey Hart, Corky Laing, The New Cities, Chromeo, Simple Plan and the infamous spoken-word musical career of William Shatner. Quebec artists have dominated the long and short lists of the Polaris Music Prize. Among them, Arcade Fire, Patrick Watson, Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Karkwa have all won the award.

<doc id="1319795" wikidata="Q133223" url="?curid=1319795" title="Deinosuchus">
<text>Deinosuchus () is an extinct genus of alligatoroid crocodilian, related to modern alligators and caimans, that lived 82 to 73 million years ago (Ma), during the late Cretaceous period. The name translates as &quot;terrible crocodile&quot; and is derived from the Greek &quot;deinos&quot; (δεινός), &quot;terrible&quot;, and &quot;soukhos&quot; (σοῦχος), &quot;crocodile&quot;. The first remains were discovered in North Carolina (United States) in the 1850s; the genus was named and described in 1909. Additional fragments were discovered in the 1940s and were later incorporated into an influential, though inaccurate, skull reconstruction at the American Museum of Natural History. Knowledge of &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; remains incomplete, but better cranial material found in recent years has expanded scientific understanding of this massive predator.

Although &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; was far larger than any modern crocodile or alligator, with the largest adults measuring in total length, its overall appearance was fairly similar to its smaller relatives. It had large, robust teeth built for crushing, and its back was covered with thick hemispherical osteoderms. One study indicated &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; may have lived for up to 50 years, growing at a rate similar to that of modern crocodilians, but maintaining this growth over a much longer time.

&quot;Deinosuchus&quot; fossils have been discovered in 12 U.S. states, including Texas, Montana, and many along the East Coast. Fossils have also been found in northern Mexico. It lived on both sides of the Western Interior Seaway, and was an opportunistic apex predator in the coastal regions of eastern North America. &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; reached its largest size in its western habitat, but the eastern populations were far more abundant. Opinion remains divided as to whether these two populations represent separate species. &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; was probably capable of killing and eating large dinosaurs. It may have also fed upon sea turtles, fish, and other aquatic and terrestrial prey.

==Discovery and naming==
In 1858, geologist Ebenezer Emmons described two large fossil teeth found in the Tar Heel Formation of Bladen County, North Carolina. Emmons assigned these teeth to &quot;Polyptychodon&quot;, which he then believed to be &quot;a genus of crocodilian reptiles&quot;. Later discoveries showed that &quot;Polyptychodon&quot; was actually a pliosaur, a type of marine reptile. The teeth described by Emmons were thick, slightly curved, and covered with vertically grooved enamel; he assigned them a new species name, &quot;P. rugosus&quot;. Although not initially recognized as such, these teeth were probably the first &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; remains to be scientifically described. Another large tooth that likely came from &quot;Deinosuchus&quot;, discovered in Tar Heel sediments from neighboring Sampson County, was named &quot;Polydectes biturgidus&quot; by Edward Drinker Cope in 1869.

In 1903, at Willow Creek, Montana, several fossil osteoderms were discovered &quot;lying upon the surface of the soil&quot; by John Bell Hatcher and T.W. Stanton. These osteoderms were initially attributed to the ankylosaurid dinosaur &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot;. Excavation at the site, carried out by W.H. Utterback, yielded further fossils, including additional osteoderms, as well as vertebrae, ribs, and a pubis. When these specimens were examined, it became clear that they belonged to a large crocodilian and not a dinosaur; upon learning this, Hatcher &quot;immediately lost interest&quot; in the material. After Hatcher died in 1904, his colleague W. J. Holland studied and described the fossils. Holland assigned these specimens to a new genus and species, &quot;Deinosuchus hatcheri&quot;, in 1909. &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; comes from the Greek δεινός/&quot;deinos&quot;, meaning &quot;terrible&quot;, and σοῦχος/&quot;suchos&quot;, meaning &quot;crocodile&quot;.
A 1940 expedition by the American Museum of Natural History yielded more fossils of giant crocodilians, this time from Big Bend National Park in Texas. These specimens were described by Edwin H. Colbert and Roland T. Bird in 1954, under the name &quot;Phobosuchus riograndensis&quot;. Donald Baird and Jack Horner later assigned the Big Bend remains to &quot;Deinosuchus&quot;, which has been accepted by most modern authorities. The genus name &quot;Phobosuchus&quot;, which was initially created by Baron Franz Nopcsa in 1924, has since been discarded because it contained a variety of different crocodilian species that turned out to not be closely related to each other.

The American Museum of Natural History incorporated the skull and jaw fragments into a plaster restoration, modeled after the present-day Cuban crocodile. Colbert and Bird stated this was a &quot;conservative&quot; reconstruction, since an even greater length could have been obtained if a long-skulled modern species, such as the saltwater crocodile had been used as the template. Because it was not then known that &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; had a broad snout, Colbert and Bird miscalculated the proportions of the skull, and the reconstruction greatly exaggerated its overall width and length. Despite its inaccuracies, the reconstructed skull became the best-known specimen of &quot;Deinosuchus&quot;, and brought public attention to this giant crocodilian for the first time.

Numerous additional specimens of &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; were discovered over the next several decades. Most were quite fragmentary, but they expanded knowledge of the giant predator&#x27;s geographic range. As noted by Chris Brochu, the osteoderms are distinctive enough that even &quot;bone granola&quot; can adequately confirm the presence of &quot;Deinosuchus&quot;. Better cranial material was also found; by 2002, David R. Schwimmer was able to create a composite computer reconstruction of 90% of the skull.

==Classification and species==

Since the discovery of the earliest fragmentary remains that would come to be known as &quot;Deinosuchus&quot;, it was considered a relative of crocodiles and initially placed in their family (Crocodylidae) in 1954 based on dental features. However, the finding of new specimens from Texas and Georgia in 1999 led to phylogenetic analysis placing &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; in a basal position within the clade Alligatoroidea along with &quot;Leidyosuchus&quot;. This classification was bolstered in 2005 by the discovery of a well-preserved &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; brain case from the Blufftown Formation of Alabama, which shows some features reminiscent of those in the modern American alligator, although &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; was not considered a direct ancestor of modern alligators.

The species pertaining to &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; since the resurrection of the generic name in 1979 have been traditionally recognized as &quot;D. rugosus&quot; from Appalachia and the larger &quot;D. hatcheri/riograndensis&quot; from Laramidia, characterized by differences of the shape of their osteoderms and teeth. However, based on the lack of distinctive enough differences beyond size, they have increasingly been considered all the same species. In their overview of crocodyliform material from the Kaiparowits Formation of Utah, Irmis et al. (2013) noted that &quot;D. rugosus&quot; is dubious due to its holotype teeth being undiagnostic, and recommended using &quot;Deinosuchus hatcheri&quot; for &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; material from Laramidia, while stressing that cranial &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; material from Appalachia has not been described. In a 2020 study, Cossette and Brochu agreed that &quot;D. rugosus&quot; is dubious and undiagnostic, rendering it a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;, and alternatively named a new species &quot;D. schwimmeri&quot; (named after fellow paleontologist David R. Schwimmer) from Appalachia, which included several specimens previously ascribed to &quot;D. rugosus&quot;. They also noted that the highly incomplete &quot;D. hatcheri&quot; holotype can be distinguished by the unique shape of the edge of its indented osteoderms, although this may not be reliable because the osteoderms of the other species may simply not be as well preserved. However, due to the incomplete nature of the type species &quot;D. hatcheri&quot;, Cossette and Brochu proposed to transfer the type species to the better preserved &quot;D. riograndensis&quot;, which would allow for improved identification and differentiation of the &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; species.

Phylogenetic analysis places &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; as a basal member of Alligatoroidea, as shown in the simplified cladogram below:
==Description==

===Morphology===

Despite its large size, the overall appearance of &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; was not considerably different from that of modern crocodilians. &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; had an alligator-like, broad snout, with a slightly bulbous tip. Each premaxilla contained four teeth, with the pair nearest to the tip of the snout being significantly smaller than the other two. Each maxilla (the main tooth-bearing bone in the upper jaw) contained 21 or 22 teeth. The tooth count for each dentary (tooth-bearing bone in the lower jaw) was at least 22. All the teeth were very thick and robust; those close to the rear of the jaws were short, rounded, and blunt. They appear to have been adapted for crushing, rather than piercing. When the mouth was closed, only the fourth tooth of the lower jaw would have been visible. The skull of &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; itself was of a unique shape not seen in any other living or extinct crocodilians; the skull was broad, but inflated at the front around the nares. Two holes in the premaxilla in front of the nares are present in this genus and are unique autapomorphies not seen in other crocodilians, but nothing is known at present regarding their function.
Modern saltwater crocodiles (&quot;Crocodylus porosus&quot;) have the strongest recorded bite of any living animal, with a maximum force of for a , specimen. The bite force of &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; has been estimated to be to .

&quot;Deinosuchus&quot; had a secondary bony palate, which would have permitted it to breathe through its nostrils while the rest of the head remained submerged underwater. The vertebrae were articulated in a procoelous manner, meaning they had a concave hollow on the front end and a convex bulge on the rear; these would have fit together to produce a ball and socket joint. The secondary palate and procoelous vertebrae are advanced features also found in modern eusuchian crocodilians.

The osteoderms (scutes) covering the back of &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; were unusually large, heavy, and deeply pitted; some were of a roughly hemispherical shape. Deep pits and grooves on these osteoderms served as attachment points for connective tissue. Together, the osteoderms and connective tissue would have served as load-bearing reinforcement to support the massive body of &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; out of water. These deeply pitted osteoderms have been used to suggest that, despite its bulk, &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; could probably have walked on land much like modern-day crocodiles.

===Size===
The large size of &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; has generally been recognized despite the fragmentary nature of the fossils assigned to it. However, estimates of how large it really was have varied considerably over the years. The original estimate from 1954 for the type specimen of the then-named &quot;Phobosuchus riograndensis&quot; were based on a skull of and a lower jaw of long, reconstructed with similar proportions to the Cuban crocodile giving a total estimated length of . However, this reconstruction is currently considered to be inaccurate. Using more complete remains, it was estimated in 1999 that the size attained by specimens of &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; varied from with weights from . This was later corroborated when it was noted that most known specimens of &quot;D. rugosus&quot; usually had skulls of about with estimated total lengths of and weights of . A reasonably well-preserved skull specimen discovered in Texas indicated the animal&#x27;s head measured about , and its body length was estimated at . Schwimmer (2002) suggested the very largest individuals of &quot;D. riograndensis&quot; could reach sizes up to , 1.5 times that of the average &quot;D. rugosus&quot;, based on isometrically scaling vertebral lengths from the type specimens of &quot;Phobosuchus riograndensis&quot; (AMNH 3073) and &quot;Deinosuchus hatcheri&quot;, which he estimated would represent animals nearly . However, Iijima and Kubo (2020) estimated AMNH 3073 to measure in length using regression equations based on modern crocodilians, as the vertebrae of crocodilians scale with positive allometry.

A particularly large mandibular fragment from a &quot;D. riograndensis&quot; specimen was estimated to have come from an individual with a skull length of . This length was used in conjunction with a regression equation relating skull length to total length in the American alligator to estimate a total length of for this particular specimen. This is only slightly lower than previous estimates for the species. &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; has often been described as the largest crocodyliform of all time. However, other crocodyliforms such as &quot;Purussaurus&quot;, &quot;Gryposuchus&quot;, &quot;Rhamphosuchus&quot;, &quot;Euthecodon&quot;, and &quot;Sarcosuchus&quot; may have equaled or exceeded it in size or length.

==Paleobiology==
===Diet===

In 1954, Edwin H. Colbert and Roland T. Bird speculated that &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; &quot;may very well have hunted and devoured some of the dinosaurs with which it was contemporaneous&quot;. Colbert restated this hypothesis more confidently in 1961: &quot;Certainly this crocodile must have been a predator of dinosaurs; otherwise why would it have been so overwhelmingly gigantic? It hunted in the water where the giant theropods could not go.&quot; David R. Schwimmer proposed in 2002 that several hadrosaurid tail vertebrae found near Big Bend National Park show evidence of &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; tooth marks, strengthening the hypothesis that &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; fed on dinosaurs in at least some instances. In 2003, Christopher A. Brochu agreed that &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; &quot;probably dined on ornithopods from time to time.&quot; &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; is generally thought to have employed hunting tactics similar to those of modern crocodilians, ambushing dinosaurs and other terrestrial animals at the water&#x27;s edge and then submerging them until they drowned. A 2014 study suggested that it would have been able to perform a &quot;death roll&quot;, like modern crocodiles.
Schwimmer and G. Dent Williams proposed in 1996 that &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; may have preyed on marine turtles. &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; would probably have used the robust, flat teeth near the back of its jaws to crush the turtle shells. The &quot;side-necked&quot; sea turtle &quot;Bothremys&quot; was especially common in the eastern habitat of &quot;Deinosuchus&quot;, and several of its shells have been found with bite marks that were most likely inflicted by the giant crocodilian.

Schwimmer concluded in 2002 that the feeding patterns of &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; most likely varied by geographic location; the smaller &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; specimens of eastern North America would have been opportunistic feeders in an ecological niche similar to that of the modern American alligator. They would have consumed marine turtles, large fish, and smaller dinosaurs. The bigger, but less common, &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; that lived in Texas and Montana might have been more specialized hunters, capturing and eating large dinosaurs. Schwimmer noted no theropod dinosaurs in &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; eastern range approached its size, indicating the massive crocodilian could have been the region&#x27;s apex predator.

===Growth rates===
A 1999 study by Gregory M. Erickson and Christopher A. Brochu suggested the growth rate of &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; was comparable to that of modern crocodilians, but was maintained over a far longer time. Their estimates, based on growth rings in the dorsal osteoderms of various specimens, indicated each &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; might have taken over 35 years to reach full adult size, and the oldest individuals may have lived for more than 50 years. This was a completely different growth strategy than that of large dinosaurs, which reached adult size much more quickly and had shorter lifespans. According to Erickson, a full-grown &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; &quot;must have seen several generations of dinosaurs come and go&quot;.

Schwimmer noted in 2002 that Erickson and Brochu&#x27;s assumptions about growth rates are only valid if the osteodermal rings reflect annual periods, as they do in modern crocodilians. According to Schwimmer, the growth ring patterns observed could have been affected by a variety of factors, including &quot;migrations of their prey, wet-dry seasonal climate variations, or oceanic circulation and nutrient cycles&quot;. If the ring cycle were biannual rather than annual, this might indicate &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; grew faster than modern crocodilians, and had a similar maximum lifespan.

==Paleoecology==

&quot;Deinosuchus&quot; was present on both sides of the Western Interior Seaway. Specimens have been described from 12 U.S. states: Utah, Montana, Wyoming, New Mexico, New Jersey (Marshalltown Formation), Delaware, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, and North &amp; South Carolina (Tar Heel/Coachman &amp; Bladen Formations). A &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; osteoderm from the San Carlos Formation was also reported in 2006, so the giant crocodilian&#x27;s range may have included parts of northern Mexico. There is also a report describing a possible &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; scute from Colorado. &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; fossils are most abundant in the Gulf Coastal Plain region of Georgia, near the Alabama border. All known specimens of &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; were found in rocks dated to the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous period. The oldest examples of this genus lived approximately 82 Ma, and the youngest lived around 73 Ma.

The distribution of &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; specimens indicates these giant crocodilians may have preferred estuarine environments. In the Aguja Formation of Texas, where some of the largest specimens of &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; have been found, these massive predators probably inhabited brackish-water bays. Although some specimens have also been found in marine deposits, it is not clear whether &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; ventured out into the ocean (like modern-day saltwater crocodiles); these remains might have been displaced after the animals died. &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; has been described as a &quot;conspicuous&quot; component of a purportedly distinct biome occupying the southern half of Late Cretaceous North America.

It has been suggested that the presence of &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; may have been responsible for the lack of very large predatory theropods from the Late Cretaceous of Appalachia, with the giant crocodilian replacing such large theropods as the top predator of the Appalachian coastal plains.

<doc id="1319801" wikidata="Q4347954" url="?curid=1319801" title="1920 United States Senate elections">
<text>The 1920 United States Senate elections were elections for the United States Senate that coincided with the presidential election of Warren G. Harding. The 32 seats of Class 3 were contested in regular elections, and special elections were held to fill vacancies. Democrat Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s unpopularity allowed Republicans to win races across the country, winning ten seats from the Democrats and providing them with an overwhelming 59-to-37 majority. The Republican landslide was so vast that Democrats lost over half of the contested seats this year and failed to win a single race outside the South. In fact, this is the most recent occasion where every race decided by under 10 points all voted for the same party, showcasing the sheer strength of Republicans&#x27; performance in this election.

Since the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment, these elections were the closest in which the winning party in almost every Senate election mirrored the winning party for their state in the presidential election, with Kentucky being the only Senate race not to mirror their presidential result. No other Senate election cycle in a presidential year would come close to repeating this feat until 2016, in which the result of every Senate race mirrored the corresponding state&#x27;s result in the presidential election. Coincidentally, that election cycle involved the same class of Senate seats, Class 3. This is also one of only five occasions where 10 or more Senate seats changed party in an election, with the other occasions being in 1932, 1946, 1958, and 1980.

As of 2025, the 59 seats held after this election cycle remains the highest number of seats that the Republican Party has held as the result of an election cycle. This number rose to 60, the highest number of seats the Republicans have ever held, after Democrat senator Josiah O. Wolcott of Delaware accepted an offer from Republican governor William D. Denney to become Chancellor of the Delaware Court of Chancery, allowing Denney to name Republican T. Coleman du Pont to replace Wolcott, a seat du Pont held until the next election, in which both a special election was held for the remainder of the term and a regular election was held as the seat was normally up then, both of which du Pont lost narrowly to Democrat Thomas F. Bayard Jr. In addition, the 22-seat majority is the largest majority that the Republicans have achieved in any election since.

== Gains, losses, and holds ==
===Retirements===
Two Republicans and three Democrats retired instead of seeking re-election. One Democrat retired instead of seeking election to finish the unexpired term.

===Defeats===

<text>Joseph Leonard Goldstein ForMemRS (born April 18, 1940) is an American biochemist. He received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1985, along with fellow University of Texas Southwestern researcher, Michael Brown, for their studies regarding cholesterol. They discovered that human cells have low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors that remove cholesterol from the blood and that when LDL receptors are not present in sufficient numbers, individuals develop hypercholesterolemia and become at risk for cholesterol related diseases, notably coronary heart disease. Their studies led to the development of statin drugs.

==Life and career==
Goldstein was born in Kingstree, South Carolina, the son of Fannie (Alpert) and Isadore E. Goldstein, who owned a clothing store. His family is Jewish. Goldstein received his BSci from Washington and Lee University in 1962, and his MD from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in 1966. Upon completion of his residency, Goldstein moved to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, where he worked in biochemical genetics. In 1972, Goldstein relocated back to the Southwestern Medical Center, accepting a post as the head of the Division of Medical Genetics.

At the Southwestern Medical Center Goldstein collaborated extensively with Michael Brown, a fellow researcher at the center who had also worked at the NIH. From 1973 to 1985, Goldstein and Brown together published over one hundred major papers. They are both listed in Thomson Reuters’ index of highly cited authors. Frequently mentioned as a candidate for nationally prominent positions in scientific administration, Goldstein, like his colleague Michael Brown, chose to continue hands-on research.

In 1993, their postdoctoral trainees, Wang Xiaodong and Michael Briggs, purified the Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Proteins (SREBPs), a family of membrane-bound transcription factors. Since 1993, Goldstein, Brown, and their colleagues have described the unexpectedly complex machinery that proteolytically releases the SREBPs from membranes, thus allowing their migration to the nucleus where they activate all the genes involved in the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids. The machinery for generating active SREBPs is tightly regulated by a negative feedback mechanism, which explains how cells maintain the necessary levels of fats and cholesterol in the face of varying environmental circumstances.

Goldstein is chair, Molecular Genetics at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Together, Goldstein and Brown lead a research team that typically includes a dozen doctoral and postdoctoral trainees. They have trained over 145 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and six of their former postdoctoral fellows (Thomas C. Südhof, Wang Xiaodong, Helen H. Hobbs, David W. Russell, Monty Krieger, and Russell DeBose-Boyd) have been elected to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. Former postdoctoral fellow Thomas C. Südhof received the 2013 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology and Helen H. Hobbs received the 2015 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences.

In 1988 Goldstein received a National Medal of Science in the field of molecular genetics, and in 2003 Goldstein and Brown won the Albany Medical Center Prize in Medicine and Biomedical Research in recognition for their further work in understanding cholesterol and also the discovery of an insulin-sensitive regulator, which potentially could be used to develop treatments for diabetes mellitus. Goldstein is a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Medicine and he was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1991.

Goldstein was appointed as chairman of the Albert Lasker Medical Research Awards jury in 1995, and was a recipient of the award ten years earlier. Since 2000, Goldstein has authored a series of essays on the deep relationship between art and science that appear in the annual &quot;Nature Medicine&quot; supplement that accompanies the Lasker Awards.

Among his professional activities, Goldstein is a member of the Board of Trustees of The Howard Hughes Medical Institute and of The Rockefeller University, where he was elected as a Life Trustee in 2015. He also serves as chairman of the Board of Scientific Counselors of the Broad Institute, and is a member of the Board of Directors of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. He previously served on The Board of Scientific Governors of the Scripps Research Institute, a nonprofit institute that conducts biomedical research.

==Essays on &quot;The Art of Science&quot;==

Since 2000, Goldstein has authored a series of essays considering science as a creative pursuit, and explores the links between art and science. The essays have appeared in the journals Nature Medicine, Cell, and most recently, PNAS. They coincide with the annual announcement of the Lasker Awards, with which Goldstein is affiliated in the capacity of jury chairman. A collection of Goldstein&#x27;s essays titled &quot;The Art of Science&quot; was published in 2023.

<doc id="1319811" wikidata="Q215824" url="?curid=1319811" title="Paul Robinson (footballer, born 1979)">
<text>Paul William Robinson (born 15 October 1979) is an English former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper in the Premier League and Football League for Leeds United, Tottenham Hotspur, Blackburn Rovers and Burnley. Robinson is a former England international, earning 41 caps between 2003 and 2007.

Robinson joined Leeds United at age 16, becoming professional aged 18, and made 119 appearances for the club, 95 of which were in league matches, and scored a goal in a League Cup tie. He also was voted Leeds United&#x27;s Player of the Year in 2003 by the supporter&#x27;s club. In 2004, following Leeds&#x27; relegation from the Premier League to the Championship, he moved to Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur. He played in 175 matches for Tottenham, including 137 Premier League matches, and scored another goal (this time in a Premier League match, whilst he also won the 2008 League Cup with the club). He was signed by Blackburn Rovers in 2008, being voted the Blackburn Rovers Player of the Year in 2011 by the supporters&#x27; club.

Robinson made his full international debut in a 3–1 friendly defeat against Australia on 12 February 2003. His competitive international debut came a year later in a 2–1 victory over Poland, during a qualification match for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Twenty-five of his forty-one appearances came in competitive internationals, with his last cap coming in a 2–1 defeat to Russia on 17 October 2007. He retired from international football on 8 August 2010.

==Club career==
===Leeds United===
Born in Beverley, Humberside, Robinson played local Sunday league football in the Hull Boys Sunday League. He played in the York City youth system before coming through the youth ranks at Leeds United after joining following a trial. He won the FA Youth Cup with Leeds during the 1996–97 season, and kept a clean sheet on his senior debut, a 0–0 draw against Chelsea on 25 October 1998.

Robinson&#x27;s appearances at Leeds were at first sporadic, although he did play in a UEFA Champions League match against Barcelona, which finished 1–1. He was Leeds&#x27; number two goalkeeper behind Nigel Martyn, making five league appearances in his debut season and none in the following season. He made 16 appearances in the 2000–01 season, following Martyn sustaining an injury, but did not play a league match in the following season. Terry Venables dropped Martyn after he requested a break from pre-season training after the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Robinson became Leeds&#x27; number one goalkeeper as a result, with Robinson playing in all 38 matches of the 2002–03 season. Martyn left for Everton at the start of the following season, with young goalkeepers Danny Milosevic and Scott Carson taking over as backups for Robinson.

During the 2003–04 season, Robinson scored his first professional goal, a header against Swindon Town in the closing moments of a League Cup match. The goal levelled the scores and forced extra time; with no further goals scored during extra time, the match then went to a penalty shoot-out. Robinson saved a penalty, whilst a Swindon player missed another one by hitting the post, resulting in Leeds winning the match. Leeds were subsequently relegated from the Premier League that season, with Robinson conceding 75 goals in 36 matches, being sent off in one match. He made 119 appearances in total for Leeds, 95 in the Premier League, during his seven-year spell at the club, and was also voted Player of the Year by the Leeds United supporters&#x27; club in 2003.

===Tottenham Hotspur===
Robinson transferred to Tottenham Hotspur in May 2004, for a fee of £1.5 million; the club had initially attempted to sign him for £2.5 million in January, with the intention of Robinson staying at Leeds until the end of the season, only for this to fail as it violated the Premier League&#x27;s rules. He made his league debut for Tottenham in a 1–1 draw against Liverpool, going on to make 36 league appearances in total during the 2004–05 season. The following two seasons saw Robinson play in all 76 of the club&#x27;s league matches; the latter season was notable for Robinson scoring the second goal of his professional career, in a Premier League match against Watford at White Hart Lane on 17 March 2007. He took a free-kick from from the opposition goal and the ball bounced over the head of Watford goalkeeper Ben Foster and into the goal. He became the third goalkeeper of six in Premier League history (excluding own goals) to score after Peter Schmeichel for Aston Villa in 2001, Brad Friedel for Blackburn Rovers in 2004, then followed by Tim Howard for Everton in 2012, Asmir Begović for Stoke City in 2013 and Alisson Becker for Liverpool in 2021. Robinson captained the team in their 1–0 League Cup quarter-final win over Southend United, and in their 0–0 FA Cup third round draw at Cardiff City as Ledley King and Robbie Keane were both injured.

The 2007–08 season proved to be less successful. An error during international duty was an example of how his form had dipped, and he was replaced by Radek Černý for part of the season, initially after Robinson made an error against Reading in the FA Cup. Although he briefly returned to the team, he made another error in the League Cup final. Despite his error, Tottenham were able to beat Chelsea 2–1, with Robinson collecting the first major trophy of his career. He made 25 appearances in the league for Tottenham during this season, and made 175 appearances in total during his time at the club, 137 in the Premier League.

===Blackburn Rovers===
Robinson joined Blackburn Rovers on 25 July 2008 for a fee of £3.5 million on a five-year deal, making him Paul Ince&#x27;s first signing at the club. He made his Premier League debut for Blackburn on 16 August, in a 3–2 victory over Everton. He was named man of the match in a 1–0 win against Wigan Athletic. Robinson helped Blackburn to finish 15th in the league, keeping five clean sheets in his 35 Premier League appearances. On 2 December 2009, in a League Cup match against Chelsea, Robinson saved two penalties during the penalty shoot-out, with Blackburn winning 4–3 on penalties as extra time ended with the score at 3–3. Robinson ended the season with a total of 12 Premier League clean sheets, as Blackburn finished tenth in the league.

Although Arsenal were rumoured to be signing Robinson at the beginning of the 2010–11 season, no move materialized. Robinson was in goal during Blackburn&#x27;s 7–1 defeat away to Manchester United on 27 November, with five of the goals being scored by Dimitar Berbatov. Despite this result, Blackburn reached as high as seventh position in the league in January, following a 2–0 victory over West Bromwich Albion. This resulted in Robinson being yet again linked with a move away from Blackburn, with Aston Villa, Liverpool and former club Tottenham all rumoured to be interested in signing him. Following the win over West Brom, however, Blackburn&#x27;s form dipped sharply, with the club eventually finishing in 15th, having won just 2 out of its last 14 matches. Robinson kept 8 clean sheets in the 36 league matches he played in, while he also conceded the 500th league goal of his career towards the end of the season, becoming the fifth goalkeeper in Premier League history to do so. He also was voted the 2011 Player of the Year by the Blackburn Rovers&#x27; supporters club.

The 2011–12 season started much as the previous one had ended, with Blackburn taking until 17 September to win a match, a 4–3 victory at home to Arsenal. On 20 November, Robinson won a penalty against Wigan; the goalkeeper had gone up to the Wigan box for a late corner, and was kicked in the face by Wigan midfielder David Jones. The penalty was scored by Yakubu to level the score at 3–3. In a repeat of the previous season, Robinson conceded seven goals as Blackburn lost an away match 7–1, this time to Arsenal, on 4 February 2012. A run of 30 matches without a clean sheet was finally ended in a 2–0 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers, a match which also took Blackburn out of the relegation zone, whilst another 2–0 win, this time against Sunderland, was the first time Robinson had kept back-to-back clean sheets since August 2010. Blackburn, however, would only score three points more all season and were relegated to the Championship after finishing in 19th position. In contrast to the two previous seasons where Robinson had averaged ten league clean sheets a season, he kept just three clean sheets in the league, having played 34 matches. All three clean sheets came from matches where Blackburn won 2–0. Following the departures of Christopher Samba and Ryan Nelsen from Ewood Park, Robinson became the Blackburn captain, initially on a temporary basis but later as the permanent captain.

Following Blackburn&#x27;s relegation, it was rumoured that Robinson would immediately return to the top flight, with Queens Park Rangers and West Ham United said to be interested, however no move materialized. Speculation continued over Robinson&#x27;s future throughout the season, with Brad Friedel being rumoured to be returning to the club (a rumour he denied), further fuelled by Robinson being dropped in December for a match against Blackpool in favour of Jake Kean, with Robinson having played every match at that point in the season. However, following the match against Blackpool, Robinson did not make any further appearances, with Kean taking the goalkeeper position, fuelling further rumours that Robinson could leave, and Robinson was made available for loan in February. In March, Robinson was ruled out for the rest of the season with a back injury; however, in April, he suffered complications, and was ruled out for six months as a result of a pulmonary embolism following his surgery. He finished the season having made 21 league appearances for the club.

After over a year without playing in a match, during which time he studied Italian at Bocconi University, Robinson made his comeback in an under-21 match against Middlesbrough on 16 December 2013. On 4 January 2014, Robinson returned to the senior Blackburn team, playing in the 1–1 FA Cup draw with Manchester City. On 11 January 2014, Robinson started his first league match for Blackburn in 13 months, starting against Doncaster Rovers at Ewood Park and keeping a clean sheet in a 1–0 win, lifting Rovers up to eighth in the Championship table. He remained as first choice goalkeeper for the next few matches, and took back-to-back clean sheets against Blackpool, Middlesbrough and Reading in February.

Robinson started the first seven matches of the 2014–15 season, but with the loan signing of Jason Steele from Middlesbrough, he was dropped from the first team. On 15 November 2014, Robinson announced his intentions of leaving the club in the January transfer window. He said that, &quot;I&#x27;m pretty much surplus to requirements at Blackburn. I&#x27;m not even on the bench. I&#x27;m training hard at the moment though. My contract is up at the end of the season so I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s got anything to do with it. I want to keep playing and, I believe, I&#x27;ve got another two or three years left in me.&quot; At the end of the season, it was announced that he would be released at the end of his contract.

===Burnley===
Robinson joined Championship club Burnley on a free transfer on 26 January 2016 on a contract until the end of the season. On 27 June 2016, he extended his contract, signing a new one-year contract with the newly promoted Premier League club. He made his debut for Burnley on 26 November 2016, his first Premier League appearance since 2012.

On 17 July 2017, Robinson announced his retirement from football.

==International career==
Between 1999 and 2002, Robinson made 14 appearances for the England under-21s. He was first included in the full international squad by Peter Taylor in a friendly against Italy on 15 November 2000, where he was an unused substitute. His next appearance on the England bench came two years later, under new manager Sven-Göran Eriksson, who selected him for a friendly match against Portugal on 7 September 2002, where he once again remained an unused substitute. He won his first cap in a 3–1 defeat against Australia on 12 February 2003, a match notable for the entire England team being substituted at half-time (at which point Robinson was brought on in place of David James). He won three more caps that year, all in friendlies, and on all occasions he was brought on at half-time. He made his first international start in a 6–1 victory over Iceland on 5 June 2004, with the match being England&#x27;s final match before the UEFA Euro 2004 finals. Robinson was part of England&#x27;s Euro 2004 squad, selected as an understudy to David James, although he made no appearances in the tournament.

Although David James remained as England&#x27;s starting goalkeeper in a 2–2 draw against Austria in the first 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification match, Robinson started every subsequent match, keeping six clean sheets in nine competitive appearances, with a further three in seven friendly matches before the tournament. At the World Cup finals in Germany, Robinson was named in England&#x27;s World Cup squad and was ever-present in England&#x27;s campaign, keeping clean sheets in four out of five matches that he played. After the opening World Cup match against Paraguay, when his counterpart Justo Villar was injured seven minutes into the match, Robinson sent Villar his gloves as a gesture of goodwill. England had won the match 1–0. In addition to the clean sheet against Paraguay, he kept one in the group match against Trinidad and Tobago, although he drew criticism for making errors on crosses. Following England&#x27;s progression from the group stage, he kept a clean sheet against Ecuador in the last 16. He also kept a clean sheet in the following match, a quarter-final match against Portugal, although Portugal won 3–1 in a penalty shoot-out to eliminate England from the tournament.

Robinson remained the number one goalkeeper for the start of England&#x27;s UEFA Euro 2008 qualification campaign, and kept clean sheets in England&#x27;s three opening matches (as well as one in a friendly against Greece). On 11 October 2006, during a Euro 2008 qualifier against Croatia, an unexpected bobble on a backpass from Gary Neville caused Robinson to miss the ball as he tried to clear it out of the penalty area, resulting in an own goal that put Croatia 2–0 up, with Robinson describing the incident as &quot;a freak goal&quot; following the match. This was the first time he had conceded a goal in six international appearances (and 655 minutes of international football); had he kept a clean sheet in this match, Robinson would have equalled Gordon Banks&#x27; record of seven consecutive clean sheets for England. He remained in the starting lineup for the friendly match against the Netherlands, which finished in a 1–1 draw. He also kept his place in the team for the next three international qualifiers, keeping a clean sheet in all three, while also featuring in a 1–1 draw with Brazil.

On 22 August 2007, Robinson made a mistake that resulted in Germany scoring their first goal of the match. England lost the match 2–1 for their first loss at the new Wembley Stadium. He was substituted at half-time and replaced by David James, although then England manager Steve McClaren said he planned to make this substitution before the match. Despite this error, Robinson was still the number one goalkeeper, featuring in four further European Championship qualifiers, and keeping a clean sheet in three of them. He made another mistake, however, in a 2–1 defeat against Russia: Robinson palmed a shot into the path of Russian forward Roman Pavlyuchenko, resulting in the striker scoring Russia&#x27;s winning goal. As a result, McClaren dropped Robinson for the final qualifying match against Croatia in November, replacing him with Scott Carson. England failed to qualify for the Euro 2008 finals as they lost 3–2 in their final match against Croatia; Carson made an error from a Niko Kranjčar shot for the first goal.

Robinson did not feature in new manager Fabio Capello&#x27;s plans until a friendly match against France on 26 March 2008, where he was named as a substitute. He remained on the substitute&#x27;s bench for the start of the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign, but was dropped from the team altogether after a friendly against Germany on 19 November 2008. Robinson was recalled to the England squad in 2009 for the World Cup qualification matches against Kazakhstan and Andorra, as regular goalkeeper David James and back-up Ben Foster were unavailable due to injury. He remained a substitute in both matches, as well as for England&#x27;s next two friendlies. He was dropped from the bench for England&#x27;s 5–1 victory over Croatia on 9 September 2009, and withdrew from the squad with a hip injury before the next qualifiers against Ukraine and Belarus.

Blackburn manager Sam Allardyce said in April 2010 that Robinson should be the number one goalkeeper for England again due to his impressive club form; however, Robinson failed to make the England squad for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, with Joe Hart, David James and Robert Green being selected instead, a decision which prompted criticism from both Allardyce, who stated, &quot;[Fabio Capello] has made the biggest mistake of his selection process,&quot; and Gordon Banks, who stated, &quot;Blackburn picked up halfway through the season but even when Robinson was letting goals in, they weren&#x27;t necessarily his fault. [Robinson] could still be doing his job properly and Blackburn could still be losing. For me he should definitely have been included.&quot;

On 8 August 2010, Robinson retired from international football with immediate effect, despite having been selected for a friendly against Hungary. He said about his retirement, &quot;Only now have I been able to make this decision as previously I haven&#x27;t been in contention for selection, I don&#x27;t see myself as a number three or four keeper and find that role very frustrating,&quot; while Allardyce backed his decision, stating, &quot;As my player, I support him because I see him week in, week out and know how well he has performed. It&#x27;s a big decision he&#x27;s made, but I understand it.&quot; In his international career, Robinson had won 41 caps for England, 25 of which came in competitive international matches (either the qualification or final rounds of the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship). Despite Steve Kean stating that England should recall him in March 2012, Robinson stated that he had no interest in a return later that month. In February 2014, Robinson said that he would be open to an international return for the 2014 FIFA World Cup if England manager Roy Hodgson decided to recall him.

==Personal life==
Robinson attended Beverley Grammar School as a child. He has a daughter, Lucy May and a son, Jack.

<text>The silvery marmoset (Mico argentatus) is a New World monkey that lives in the eastern Amazon Rainforest in Brazil.

The fur of the silvery marmoset is colored whitish silver-grey except for a dark tail. Remarkable are its naked, flesh-colored ears which stand out from the skin. They reach a size of and weigh from .

Silvery marmosets are diurnal and arboreal, using their claws to climb trees. Originally rain forest inhabitants, plantations have caused them to expand their range. They spend the night in tree hollows or in very close vegetation. They live together in small groups and mark their territory with scent glands, driving out intruders by shouting or by facial expressions (lowered brows and guarded lips).

The diet of the silvery marmosets predominantly consists of tree sap. To a lesser extent, they also eat bird eggs, fruit, insects, and small vertebrates.

After a 145-day gestation period, the female bears two (or rarely three) offspring. As is the case for many callitrichids, the father and the other group members take part with the raising of the offspring. Within six months the young are weaned, with full maturity coming at about two years of age.

Studies show that Silvery Marmosets prefer secondary growth forests and edge growth forests due to some of the benefits that the habitat presents such as an abundance of insect prey and dense vegetation.

<doc id="1319874" wikidata="Q4052358" url="?curid=1319874" title="TV Funhouse">
<text>Saturday TV Funhouse is a segment on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; featuring cartoons created by &quot;SNL&quot; writer Robert Smigel. 101 &quot;TV Funhouse&quot; segments aired on &quot;SNL&quot; between 1996 and 2008, with one further segment airing in 2011. It also spawned a short-lived spinoff series, &quot;TV Funhouse&quot;, that aired on Comedy Central.

==Production==
Programmed to air between the host segments of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, &quot;TV Funhouse&quot; parodied such genres as 1950s educational films, Saturday morning Hanna-Barbera/Ruby-Spears/Filmation cartoons of the 1970s and 1980s, and the 1960s stop motion holiday specials of Rankin/Bass. ¨Any episode of &quot;TV Funhouse&quot; appearing on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; would be listed by the announcer as &quot;A cartoon by Robert Smigel.

The animation was produced by J.J. Sedelmaier Productions for its first three seasons until Wachtenheim/Marianetti Animation took over primary animation production duties.

===Recurring &quot;SNL&quot; &quot;TV Funhouse&quot; skits===

* Fun with Real Audio – This sketch presented animated scenes to found, real-life audio tracks.
* The All-New Adventures of Mr. T – A parody of the Ruby-Spears animated series &quot;Mister T&quot;. This cartoon depicts Mr. T (voiced by Tracy Morgan) as desperate to find work after 10 years, aggressively auditioning for unlikely parts such as classical theatre and tampon commercials with help from Jeff Harris (voiced by Andy Daly), Kim Nakamura (voiced by Ana Gasteyer), Spike O&#x27;Neill (voiced by Andrew Daly), and Bulldozer the Bulldog. Whenever he encounters obstacles such as directors telling him auditions are already over, he simply responds with the phrase &quot;Ain&#x27;t got time for jibber-jabber, I need work!&quot; Mr. T also throws in different advice during his dialogue like &quot;Drink your milk&quot;, &quot;Stay in school&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t do drugs&quot;, and &quot;Eat all your greens&quot;. After getting the employment, he would often mix up of all his advice to his companions when stating how one could get work as Bulldozer barks after that.
* The Ambiguously Gay Duo – A parody of the comic book superhero duets. The vaguely homosexual superheroes Ace and Gary (voiced by Stephen Colbert and Steve Carell respectively) fight crime in Metroville while their adversaries like Bighead (voiced by Robert Smigel) and Dr. Brainio (voiced by Stephen Colbert) try to figure out their true sexuality. Bill Chott provides the narration for this cartoon. All the shorts were re-written from &quot;The Dana Carvey Show&quot;. In the live-action version on the &quot;SNL&quot; episode hosted by Ed Helms, Jon Hamm and Jimmy Fallon play Ace and Gary while Stephen Colbert and Steve Carell played Dr. Brainio and Bighead.
* The Anatominals Show – A parody of a Yogi Bear–type Hanna-Barbera–style cartoon where Kogi Bear, Pook Bear, Mindy Bear, Sheila Coyote, Betsy Cow, and other animal characters are anatomically correct even when they are confronted by the park ranger during attempts to take picnic baskets. Both episodes were interspersed with scenes of Lorne Michaels (voiced by Robert Smigel) expressing deep disappointment with the show or trying to prevent visitors to Studio 8H from seeing the cartoon. 
* The Michael Jackson Show – A parody of Hanna-Barbera cartoons, highlighting the misadventures of Michael Jackson (voiced by Dino Stamatopoulos) and his odd friends. Included in his rag-tag entourage are his talking common chimpanzee Bubbles, an aged Emmanuel Lewis, a talking anthropomorphic llama who&#x27;s just called Llama, the living skeleton of The Elephant Man (voiced by Robert Smigel impersonating Jimmy Durante), a zebra with a pushmi-pullyu design, the sentient and speaking arm of Elizabeth Taylor, and a sentient urn containing Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s ashes. Michael&#x27;s friends often try to get him not to do stuff with little boys which goes comically awry for them. Sometimes when he gets satisfied with a little boy or the aged Emmanuel Lewis, Michael Jackson would have the same reactions that Quick Draw McGraw character Snuffles would have when he gets his dog biscuit. The theme song is to the tune of &quot;The Yogi Bear Show&quot;.
* The X-Presidents – A parody of Hanna-Barbera/Filmation cartoons from the 1970s. This sketch features former US Presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush (all voiced by Jim Morris) as crime-fighting superheroes imbued with superpowers by a &quot;hurricane-powered dose of radiation&quot; received at a celebrity golf tournament. Each of their wives is a member as well. Bill Clinton, despite his status as a living former president, is not a member since he did not receive the hurricane-powered dose of radiation, as he was in office during the initial incident.

====Disney parodies====
TV Funhouse did a bunch of parodies of The Walt Disney Company. Their first one on April 4, 1998 was a trailer to the cheerful spin on the Titanic called &quot;Titey&quot; which had Jason Alexander voicing Titey and Whoopi Goldberg voicing the &quot;bad old iceberg&quot;. The trailer also showed some marine life working together to save Titey from sinking. In addition, Gilbert Gottfried also voiced Napoleon Bonaparte who was on top of the iceberg in one shot during its duel with Titey and Molly Ringwald voiced Anne Frank who sings about writing in a diary someday and mention the exploits of Titey.

The February 10, 2001, episode, &quot;Ray of Light,&quot; parodies the controversy over Ray Lewis&#x27;s involvement in an Atlanta homicide. Although Lewis went on to become the Super Bowl XXXV MVP, he was unable to utter the famous line &quot;I&#x27;m going to Disney World!&quot; The skit was involved with Disney &quot;making it up&quot; to Lewis by placing him in various Disney animated movies. Lewis would be shown fleeing the scene of Disney character death scenes, frequently uttering &quot;I didn&#x27;t see nothin&#x27;!&quot; He also did a song stating that he &quot;did not kill no motherf****** lion&quot;.

&quot;Bambi 2002,&quot; a poke at Disney&#x27;s penchant for direct-to video sequels at the time, imagines a sequel to the original movie where Bambi&#x27;s mother turns up alive. The title character fights stylized terrorist types, meets Jared Fogle, and performs a rap music number in the forest. Also in the sketch are moments involving some of Disney&#x27;s darker issues, as well as some pornographic humor with the unaffiliated film &quot;Pokahotass&quot;.

On April 15, 2006, Robert Smigel again parodied Disney&#x27;s home video moratorium policy, as well as Walt Disney&#x27;s alleged racism and anti-Semitism. When two kids are brought to the Disney Vault by Mickey Mouse, they find Walt&#x27;s frozen head, several controversial things that were never released, the &quot;very original version&quot; of &quot;Song of the South&quot; that Walt only screened at parties, and Jim Henson and Kermit the Frog bound and gagged in a chair, Mickey Mouse breaks down and quotes &quot;He wouldn&#x27;t sell! He wouldn&#x27;t sell...!&quot; (a reference to a broken deal between The Jim Henson Company and The Walt Disney Company following Henson&#x27;s death; Disney bought the Muppets franchise in 2004, 2 years prior to the sketch).

===NBC special===
On April 29, 2006, NBC aired a full-length, 90-minute &quot;SNL&quot; &quot;best of&quot; special for &quot;TV Funhouse&quot;. The special was hosted by The Ambiguously Gay Duo interacting with the current &quot;SNL&quot; cast with a cameo from Jimmy Fallon.

The special was released on DVD October 24, 2006.

==Fox Pilot==
In 1998, Fox commissioned a pilot from Smigel and Stamatopoulos. An earlier version of what would become Comedy Central&#x27;s show, &quot;Saturday TV Funhouse&quot; was a dark parody of Bozo, with Smigel playing Prozo, a half-drunk clown. While living in Chicago, Smigel became fascinated with WGN-TV&#x27;s &quot;Bozo’s Circus&quot;. He researched old television shows, and with the help of Doug Dale, who played fellow clown Looky, found footage of 1970s children shows such as &quot;Gigglesnort Hotel&quot; and &quot;The BJ and Dirty Dragon Show&quot;. After that they started coming up with ideas for the show.

The pilot began with an episode of &quot;Fun With Real Audio.&quot; Next in the studio, a character named &quot;Ringmaster Ted&quot; introduces the show and its characters as he stands in front of the audience filled with children and parents. Prozo, “most people’s favorite clown,” played by Smigel; his “kooky pal Looky,” played by Doug Dale; “the mysterious Wizzy,” played by Stamatopoulos; a cat puppet that is licking itself named Furball; and a three-piece TV Funhouse Band, fronted by Floyd Vivino. Some of the segments featured include: Prozo leading the studio audience in song: &quot;If you&#x27;re Jewish and you know it, clap your hands!&quot; a sketch in which the clowns reenact the Camp David Accords between Bill Clinton, Yasir Arafat, and Benjamin Netanyahu with a trolly full of pies, and an episode of &quot;The Ambiguously Gay Duo&quot;, among others. A deleted scene showed a sketch featuring Bozo and a speaking outhouse, voiced by Stephen Colbert. 

In 2002, Smigel said of Fox declining to show the pilot: &quot;I know this thing is all about &#x27;Fuck the networks! They&#x27;re idiots! But I don&#x27;t know...This show has a disturbing element.&quot; In June 2009, Just for Laughs sponsored an event at the Lakeshore Theater in Chicago to present the pilot, “I wanted to do the Bozo parody as close to the real thing (Bob Bell) as possible,” Smigel said in the Q&amp;A after, “I didn’t want to do the angry clown thing.” 

==Comedy Central&#x27;s TV Funhouse==

The spinoff series was somewhat of a twisted &quot;Pee-Wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;-style children&#x27;s TV show, hosted by Doug Dale and his &quot;Anipals&quot; puppet friends.

===Plot===
Every episode had a different theme to it (e.g., &quot;Hawaiian Day&quot; or &quot;Astronaut Day&quot;) and saw the Anipals usually getting into some sort of trouble, not wanting to do whatever their happy-go-lucky host had in mind for the day.

The theme song describes this show as the &quot;last cartoon show of the day&quot;.

This show didn&#x27;t show any cartoons from &quot;The Ambiguously Gay Duo&quot;, &quot;The Michael Jackson Show&quot;, and/or &quot;The X-Presidents&quot; despite some of its characters appearing in the theme song.

===Production===
The Comedy Central version of &quot;TV Funhouse&quot; premiered in December 2000 and was not picked up for a second season. Interviews with Smigel indicate that Comedy Central believed in the show, but was disappointed in how it went over budget every episode. Smigel has also expressed how difficult the show was and how tedious the puppet-live animal segments were to shoot.

The show was released on DVD July 22, 2008, under the title &quot;Comedy Central&#x27;s TV Funhouse&quot;.

<doc id="1319877" wikidata="Q968484" url="?curid=1319877" title="Mikołaj Krzysztof Radziwiłł the Orphan">
<text>Prince Mikołaj Krzysztof Radziwiłł (; 2 August 1549 – 28 February 1616), nicknamed &quot;the Orphan&quot; (, ), was a Polish–Lithuanian nobleman (szlachcic), Ordynat of Nyasvizh from 1586, Court Marshal of Lithuania from 1569, Grand Marshal of Lithuania from 1579, castellan of Trakai from 1586, voivode of Trakai Voivodeship from 1590, voivode of Vilnius Voivodeship from 1604 and governor of Šiauliai. After the treaty at Vienna in 1515 all Radziwills were Imperial Princes and he held a position as Imperial Prince of the Holy Roman Empire.

==Biography==
He was nicknamed &quot;the Orphan&quot;, in his infancy, by the Polish king and Lithuanian grand duke Sigismund II Augustus (while his parents were still alive). He married Halaszka Eufemia Wiśniowiecka on 24 November 1584, a Calvinist, who under his influence, converted to Roman Catholicism.

He took part in the Livonian War against Muscovites. In 1573, he was a member of a diplomatic mission to France to the future king of Poland and grand duke of Lithuania, Henry III of France.

Unlike many other members of Radziwiłł family he tried to stay away from politics, especially from the dynastic clan politics of some of other Radziwiłłs like Janusz Radziwiłł; he also supported the forces loyal to the king and Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth during the Zebrzydowski Rebellion, a szlachta&#x27;s confederation threatening the king. He attempted to convince the confederates to surrender without unnecessary bloodshed.

Like other members of the Radziwiłłs family, he couldn&#x27;t escape the political ambitions of his family, and when needed, he would support it. He successfully campaigned for a royal pardon for his cousin Janusz, one of the organisers of the confederation&#x27;s rokosz (rebellion). However, he also refused to support the Krzysztof &#x27;Piorun&#x27; Radziwiłł, whose conflict with another powerful family threatened to plunge the Grand Duchy into a civil war.

Mikołaj became famous for a vivid account of his eventful pilgrimage to the Holy Land published in Latin in 1601 and later translated into Polish. During his voyage he visited not only Palestine, but also Syria, Egypt, Crete, Cyprus, Italy, and Greece. Robert Burton while on the subject of St. Elmo&#x27;s fire wrote of this voyage in his &quot;Anatomy of Melancholy&quot;: &quot;Radzivilius, the Polonian duke, calls this apparition, Sancti Germani sidus; and saith moreover that he saw the same after in a storm, as he was sailing, 1582, from Alexandria to Rhodes&quot;.

While in Rome, he met Piotr Skarga and Stanislaus Hosius, who convinced him to convert from Calvinism to Catholicism, as later did his other brothers, many upon his insistence. He was also known for his cultural and charity sponsorships. He was a founder of many cloisters, hospitals and churches. One of the chapels in the Jesuit church in Nesvizh, founded by Mikołaj Krzysztof, would become the family&#x27;s mausoleum for the Radziwiłłs, serving them for the next two hundred and a half centuries.

In Nieśwież, which became his seat, he also built a fortified castle. He was a patron of artists and scientists; for example he supported the works of cartographers such as Tomasz Makowski.

<text>The Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty (, or UVVU) are a set of three committees under the Danish Ministry of Research and Information Technology: a committee for natural science, agricultural and veterinary science and technical science; a committee for health and medical science; and a committee for social science and the humanities. They have a common chairman.

Previously obscure, the DCSD became embroiled in controversy after its January 2003 decision that the 2001 book &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; by Bjørn Lomborg was &quot;clearly contrary to the standards of good scientific practice&quot;, due to the author&#x27;s systematically biased choice of data, and &quot;objectively&quot; was scientifically irredeemable, but Lomborg himself could not be &quot;subjectively&quot; convicted of intentional or gross negligence. Lomborg had argued in his book that claims by environmentalists about global warming, overpopulation, deforestation, and other matters are not scientifically substantiated. The DCSD further held that because of Lomborg&#x27;s lack of scientific expertise, he had not shown intentional or gross negligence, and acquitted him of the accusations of scientific dishonesty.

In February 2003, Lomborg filed a complaint with the Ministry, and in December 2003, the Ministry found that the DCSD&#x27;s handling of the investigation in the case had been improper, and remitted it for re-examination. In March 2004, the DCSD stated that since its finding had been to acquit Lomborg of the charges of scientific dishonesty (although they had criticized his biased selection of data), there was no basis to re-open the investigation, and dismissed the case.

The original DCSD decision about Lomborg provoked a petition among Danish academics. 308 scientists, many of them from the social sciences, criticised the DCSD&#x27;s methods in the case and called for the DCSD to be disbanded. The Danish Minister of Science, Technology, and Innovation then asked the Danish Research Agency to form an independent working group to review DCSD practices. In response to this, another group of Danish scientists collected over 600 signatures (primarily from the medical and natural sciences community) to support the continued existence of the DCSD and presented their petition to the Danish Research Agency.

The DCSD was involved in another controversy investigating a paper on sex and intelligence authored by Helmuth Nyborg. After the DCSD cleared Nyborg of the charges of scientific misconduct, two Aarhus University professors, Lise Togeby and Jens Mammen resigned from their positions in the DCSD, citing that the DCSD operated from too narrow of a framework. Togeby explained that &quot;Roughly speaking, these committees can only decide whether a researcher has cheated or not. We cannot consider the issue of academic quality, or decide whether research has been carried out in accordance with good academic standards&quot;.

<text>The black-tailed marmoset (Mico melanurus) is a species of New World monkey from central South America, where it ranges from the south-central Amazon in Brazil, south through the Pantanal and eastern Bolivia, to the Chaco in far northern Paraguay. It is the southernmost member of the genus &quot;Mico&quot; and the only species where most of its range is outside the Amazon.

The black-tailed marmoset is dark brown with paler foreparts and a black tail. Unlike most of its relatives, it has a striking white or yellow-white stripe that extends down its thigh. Its ears are naked, flesh-colored and stand out from the fur. They reach a size of 18 to 28 cm and weigh from 300 to 400 g.

Black-tailed marmosets are diurnal and arboreal, using their claws to climb trees. Originally rain forest inhabitants, plantations have caused them to expanded them their range. They spend the night in tree hollows or in very close vegetation. They live together in small groups and mark their territory with scent glands, driving out intruders by shouting or by facial expressions, including lowered brows and guarded lips.

The diet of the black-tailed marmoset predominantly consists of tree sap. To a lesser extent, they also eat bird eggs, fruits, insects, and small vertebrates.

After a 145-day gestation period, the female bears two (or rarely three) offspring. As is the case for many callitrichines, the father and the other group members take part with the raising of the offspring. Within six months the young are weaned, with full maturity coming at about two years of age.

<text>The Music City Miracle was an American football play that took place on January 8, 2000, during the National Football League&#x27;s (NFL) 1999–2000 playoffs. It occurred at the end of the American Football Conference (AFC) Wild Card playoff game between the Tennessee Titans and Buffalo Bills at Adelphia Coliseum (now Nissan Stadium) in Nashville, Tennessee. After the Bills had taken a 16–15 lead on a field goal with 16 seconds remaining in the game, on the ensuing kickoff return, Titans tight end Frank Wycheck threw a lateral pass across the field to Kevin Dyson, who then ran 75 yards to score the winning touchdown to earn a 22–16 victory.

==Background==

The 1999 Tennessee Titans season was the 40th in franchise history and the first in which they used the name Titans, having previously played as the Oilers. Steve McNair began the year as the team&#x27;s starting quarterback. However, after an opening week victory, he was diagnosed with a ruptured disc, and Neil O&#x27;Donnell assumed the starting role. O&#x27;Donnell led the team to a 4–1 record before McNair returned to finish the season. The team&#x27;s rushing attack was led by Eddie George, who ran for 1,304 yards and nine touchdowns en route to a Pro Bowl appearance. The team leader in targets and receptions was tight end Frank Wycheck, while Kevin Dyson led the team in receiving yards. Rookie defensive end Jevon Kearse, selected with the 16th pick in the 1999 NFL draft, had 14.5 sacks and led the NFL with eight forced fumbles, winning Defensive Rookie of the Year at season&#x27;s end. The Titans finished 13–3, however, the Jacksonville Jaguars won the AFC Central with a 14–2 record. Both of the Jaguars&#x27; losses came against the Titans. Given a Wild Card berth in the 1999–2000 playoffs, the Titans had the best record of any team in NFL history to not win its division.

The Buffalo Bills possessed one the NFL&#x27;s best defenses in 1999. The unit allowed the fewest yards (252.8) and second fewest points (14.3) per game in the league. Running backs Jonathan Linton and Antowain Smith shared carries out of the backfield, while wide receiver Eric Moulds led the team with 994 receiving yards. Several veteran players who had been a part of the Bills&#x27; four straight Super Bowl appearances in the early 1990s played minor roles, including Andre Reed, Bruce Smith, and Thurman Thomas. The Bills finished 11–5, qualifying for the postseason for the eighth time in the decade.

Prior to the teams&#x27; Wild Card game, some fans and media members believed that the winner could be a serious contender to represent the AFC in the Super Bowl.

===Rob Johnson–Doug Flutie controversy===
Going into the game, Bills coach Wade Phillips created a stir by starting quarterback Rob Johnson, rather than Doug Flutie. Johnson and Flutie had competed for the starting job since the 1998 season, with Flutie compiling a better record in regular season competition during 1998 and 1999.

Flutie started the first 15 games of the 1999 season, winning 10. With the Bills&#x27; playoff seed assured, Phillips rested Flutie in the final regular season contest. Johnson performed well in Flutie&#x27;s absence, completing 75% of his passes and throwing for 287 yards and two touchdowns in a dominant victory over the Indianapolis Colts, who had won their previous 11 games. Phillips subsequently named Johnson the starter for the Bills&#x27; first round playoff game. Titans coach Jeff Fisher said that the decision left him &quot;a little surprised&quot; given that Flutie had been the Bills&#x27; starter for the majority of the season. Years later, Phillips wrote that the decision to start Johnson came at the urging of Bills owner Ralph Wilson.

===Previous playoff meeting===
The previous playoff game between the two teams had occurred in 1993, when the Titans were known as the Houston Oilers. Held at Rich Stadium in Buffalo, the game became known as The Comeback after the Bills rallied from a 35–3 deficit to win 41–38 in overtime. At the time, this was the largest comeback in NFL history.

==Game summary==

===First half===
The Titans opened the scoring in the second quarter when Jevon Kearse sacked Buffalo quarterback Rob Johnson in the end zone for a safety. Johnson struggled against the Titans&#x27; defense throughout the game, completing just 10 of 22 passes while being sacked six times, twice by Kearse. Tennessee wide receiver Derrick Mason returned the free kick after the safety 42 yards to the Bills&#x27; 28-yard line; Titans quarterback Steve McNair scored on a 1-yard touchdown run to culminate the drive. After their defense forced a punt, the Titans drove 56 yards in 11 plays. Kicker Al Del Greco initially missed a 45-yard field goal attempt, but the Bills were penalized for defensive holding on the play and Del Greco&#x27;s second attempt was good from 40 yards. The field goal gave the Titans a 12–0 lead at halftime, the Bills having only gained 64 yards of offense while surrendering 44 yards on penalties.

===Second half===
In the second half, the Bills rallied. On Buffalo&#x27;s first play of the third quarter, Antowain Smith broke off a 44-yard run, sparking a 62-yard drive that ended with his 4-yard touchdown run. Later in the quarter, Antoine Winfield Sr. intercepted a pass near midfield, but the Bills were unable to capitalize on the good field position, their subsequent drive resulting in a three-and-out. Following a Tennessee punt, the Bills received possession with 41 seconds remaining in the third quarter. They drove 65 yards, including a 37-yard completion from Johnson to Eric Moulds and aided by a red zone roughing the passer penalty on Kearse. Smith finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run, giving the Bills a 13–12 lead after a failed two-point conversion attempt. The teams then traded punts in what had become a low-scoring, defensive game. The Bills managed 219 total yards on offense during the contest, while the Titans were limited to just 194, most of which were gained by running back Eddie George, who accounted for 106 yards on 29 rushing attempts and another four yards on two receptions.

Tennessee received possession with 6:15 remaining in the game. Titans receiver Isaac Byrd&#x27;s 16-yard punt return gave the Titans good field position at the Bills&#x27; 45-yard line. On the second play of the drive, the Titans got a break when a McNair pass bounced off of linebacker John Holecek&#x27;s elbow and into the hands of Frank Wycheck for a completion. The drive culminated in a 36-yard field goal by Del Greco, giving the Titans a 15–13 lead with 1:48 left in the game. The ensuing Buffalo drive began at the Bills&#x27; 39-yard line after a 33-yard kickoff return by Kevin Williams. Johnson began the drive with a completion to rookie wide receiver Peerless Price for 14 yards and a first down. After an incomplete pass, a 12-yard run by Jonathan Linton gave the Bills a first down on the Titans&#x27; 35-yard line with under a minute to play. On the next play from scrimmage, Johnson lost a shoe in a scramble, and with the clock running, he had no time to put it back on. With only one shoe, Johnson rolled out and completed a pass to Price, who broke a tackle and got out of bounds at the 24-yard line with 20 seconds left. After this play, Wade Phillips sent out the field goal unit for a 41-yard attempt. Bills kicker Steve Christie, who had made the deciding field goal in overtime to cap the Bills&#x27; comeback win in the previous playoff meeting between the teams, converted the try. The Bills led 16–15 with 16 seconds remaining.

===The play===

The kickoff return play was named &quot;Home Run Throwback&quot; by the Titans and was developed by special teams coordinator Alan Lowry. He had learned the play in 1982 as a member of the Dallas Cowboys coaching staff, watching SMU execute a similar kickoff return to score the winning touchdown in the final seconds of its game at Texas Tech. The Titans had practiced the play once a week during the regular season. The practices usually involved starting kick returner Derrick Mason, however, he had suffered an injury earlier in the playoff game and was unavailable for the final seconds. The second option for the play, Anthony Dorsett, was also unavailable for the play due to cramps. As a result, the Titans put in Isaac Byrd as their main option to retrieve the lateral pass, with Kevin Dyson trailing behind him. As one of the team&#x27;s leading wide receivers, Dyson rarely practiced with the special teams unit and was unfamiliar with the layout of the play. As a result, head coach Jeff Fisher called him over before the play and gave him a brief summary of what to expect.

After observing Frank Wycheck playing a throwing game during downtime at practice, Titans offensive coordinator Les Steckel had designed an option pass play with Wycheck in mind. The Titans ran that play against the Atlanta Falcons during the 1999 regular season, and Wycheck threw a 61-yard touchdown pass. After the success of this play, Lowry assigned Wycheck to throw the lateral on Home Run Throwback.

Meanwhile, because the Bills defense had accumulated a large number of injuries, their coaches asked for volunteers to cover the kickoff. As a result, numerous defensive starters, who were inexperienced on special teams, were in the game on the play. Initially, the Bills planned on kicking the ball deep, but special teams coordinator Bruce DeHaven suggested that the Bills attempt a pooch kick, in which the ball is kicked higher and shorter than a regular kickoff to limit the opportunity for a runback.

Steve Christie executed the pooch, and the kick was fielded by Lorenzo Neal. Neal handed the ball backwards to Wycheck. Bills defenders converged on Wycheck on the right side of the field, breaking their running lanes in the process. As devised, Wycheck threw the ball across the field to Dyson. As Dyson caught the ball, the momentum of the play abruptly shifted to the left, catching every Bills defender except Christie out of position. Dyson thus had an open path in front of him and ran 75 yards into the end zone for the go-ahead touchdown with three seconds remaining.


The play was reviewed by replay officials in order to determine whether Wycheck&#x27;s throw had been a lateral, as had been called by referee Phil Luckett&#x27;s crew. If the pass had gone forwards, the Titans would have been penalized at the spot of the throw and the touchdown would not have counted. Luckett upheld the call on the field, and the touchdown stood. Buffalo was unable to score on the Titans&#x27; subsequent kickoff, and the game ended in a 22–16 Tennessee victory.

Upon crossing midfield, Dyson later said he considered going out of bounds in field goal range, as all the Titans needed was a field goal to win the game. However, upon seeing that the only player with a chance at tackling him was Christie, who was being blocked by two players, Dyson simply kept going into the end zone.

==Aftermath==

===Immediate===
The victory advanced the Titans to the AFC Divisional Round for the first time since 1993, when they were based in Houston. Subsequent victories over the Indianapolis Colts and the Jacksonville Jaguars sent the Titans to Super Bowl XXXIV to face the St. Louis Rams. The Titans lost the Super Bowl in a close game that came down to the final play, known as &quot;One Yard Short&quot; or &quot;The Tackle&quot;.

The Bills fired special teams coordinator Bruce DeHaven, who had been with the team for 13 seasons. DeHaven was subsequently hired by the San Francisco 49ers and was eventually rehired by the Bills for three seasons beginning in 2010. DeHaven&#x27;s replacement in 2000, Ronnie Jones, was criticized for his performance by team owner Ralph Wilson. Despite the ninth best offense and third best defense in the league, the 2000 Bills finished 8–8 and missed the playoffs. Wilson demanded that Jones be fired as a result. When head coach Wade Phillips refused to do so, Wilson fired both Jones and Phillips. Phillips was succeeded by Titans defensive coordinator Gregg Williams.

===Long-term effect on the Bills===
The Music City Miracle was the last game in a Bills uniform for the remaining key members of the team&#x27;s 1990s Super Bowl runs. Andre Reed, Bruce Smith, and Thurman Thomas were all released by the team in the offseason; all three would eventually be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

Starting in 2000, the Bills missed the playoffs in 17 consecutive seasons, a streak that was the longest active playoff drought in major American sports when it ended. The streak eventually came to be known as &quot;the Curse of Doug Flutie&quot; under the assumption that Wade Phillips had cursed the Bills by benching Flutie before the Music City Miracle game. The Curse of Flutie moniker was also applied to subsequent failures, particularly at the quarterback position, of teams that employed Phillips. Ralph Wilson died on March 25, 2014, and the team was subsequently sold by his estate to Terry and Kim Pegula. Buffalo&#x27;s playoff drought ended during the 2017 season, three years after the Pegulas assumed ownership of the franchise.

The Music City Miracle became one of a series of infamous moments in Buffalo sports history, including &quot;Wide Right&quot;, No Goal&quot;, and &quot;13 Seconds&quot;. Bills fans generally refuse to call the game or the play by their standard name, instead referring to them as &quot;The Immaculate Deception&quot; or by other names that imply that Frank Wycheck&#x27;s lateral travelled forwards. In his 2017 autobiography &quot;Son of Bum&quot;, Wade Phillips called the play &quot;The Music City Mistake&quot;.

===Legacy===
In 2004, NFL Films hired a computer analyst to determine whether or not the call on the field of a backward lateral was correct. The analyst determined that the ball indeed had not travelled forward and that the referee&#x27;s call was correct.

During the NFL&#x27;s centennial season in 2019, the Bills–Titans matchup in Week 5 was designated as one of 16 weekly games commemorating notable events in NFL history, namely the Music City Miracle. In that game, the Titans were denied a go-ahead touchdown in the fourth quarter after it was determined that quarterback Marcus Mariota had crossed the line of scrimmage prior to making a forward pass to the end zone. The Bills went on to win 14–7.

During their win over the Bills in , the Titans attempted a lateral play during a first quarter punt return. After corralling the punt, Titans returner Chester Rogers threw the ball to teammate Chris Jackson, who advanced the ball 22 yards before being tackled. However, the play was nullified by an illegal forward pass penalty, as Rogers&#x27; lateral had advanced five yards downfield.

<text>Maurice Harrison Murphy (7 August 1935 – 28 October 2010) was a British musician who was principal trumpet of the London Symphony Orchestra from 1977 to 2007.

==Biography==
He was born in Hammersmith in 1935, and his father drove a coal wagon. He grew up playing in brass bands in Yorkshire, and notably was Principal Cornet of the world-famous Black Dyke Mills Band from 1956 to 1961. His transition from brass bands to orchestral work was helped with stints with the Hallé, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and the Lemare Orchestra. He held the position of Principal Trumpet with the BBC Northern Symphony Orchestra (now the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra) from 1961 and in 1977 joined the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) as Principal Trumpet, a position he held for 30 years until his retirement in 2007.

Murphy has played on film soundtracks including the first six &quot;Star Wars&quot; films (his first role as Principal Trumpet in the LSO), &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot;, &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, &quot;Gangs of New York&quot;, &quot;Johnny English&quot;, &quot;Reign of Fire&quot;, a solo in &quot;Mr. Holland’s Opus&quot;, &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot;, the &quot;Alien&quot; movies, &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, &quot;Gladiator&quot;, &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; and many more.

Murphy officially retired from the orchestra on 16 October 2000 but continually had his contract renewed between then and his real retirement on 3 June 2007. His last concert as principal trumpet of the LSO was in a performance of Elgar&#x27;s &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot;, conducted by Richard Hickox.

==Honours==
In 2008 Murphy received the honorary award of the International Trumpet Guild, given to those &quot;who have made extraordinary contributions to the art of trumpet playing&quot;. 

He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2010 New Year Honours.

==Death==
Maurice Murphy died on 28 October 2010, aged 75.

<doc id="1319975" wikidata="Q343341" url="?curid=1319975" title="İbrahim Kutluay">
<text>İbrahim Kutluay (born 7 January 1974) is a former Turkish professional basketball player who has been a manager and pundit since his retirement. He played the shooting guard position, and in his prime, was one of the most prolific 3-point shooters worldwide. He scored a record 50 points at the 1996 FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship against Italy, and also 41 points in a EuroLeague game against Cibona Zagreb during the 1998–99 season. He was the first Turkish basketball player to win the EuroLeague championship, winning the 2002 EuroLeague Final Four with the Greek club Panathinaikos. Kutluay was the fourth Turk to play in the NBA. He is described as a &#x27;stellar basketball player&#x27; whose &#x27;legacy goes beyond his shooting skills, leadership, and incredible talent&#x27;. In addition to his professional career, he has also attracted interest as a high society figure due to his fame, wealth and personal life which has continuously been subjected to media scrutiny.

==Professional club career==

===Fenerbahçe: 1992–1999===
Ibrahim Kutluay is a product of the Fenerbahçe. Initially set on becoming a football player, at the age of 13, he made a switch to basketball under the influence of his coaches and family, as it was evident that his growing height, physical attributes and skills would make him naturally disposed to succeed as a basketeer. He progressed through each single stage of the youth sector, and in 1992 was introduced to the A (principal) team of Fenerbahçe by Çetin Yılmaz. In the 1994–1995 season, he made a breakthrough under Murat Didin and established himself as the best scorer of the team. He was the FIBA EuroLeague Top Scorer of the 1998–99 season, with an average of 21.4 points per game.

===Efes Pilsen: 1999–2000===
Kutluay had a successful career at Efes Pilsen with an overall record of 15.1 points, 1.7 rebounds and 2.6 assists per game.

===Greece and reaching the top of Europe===
It was in Greece that Kutluay reached the peak of his career. The move to AEK Athens was a very risky one due to the historically troubled relations between Turkey and Greece and at the time of Kutluay&#x27;s transfer to the Greek club the relations were particularly strained. Ibrahim did prove his worth and won the Greek Cup MVP, in 2001. Whilst playing for Panathinaikos he won the Euroleague in 2002. The final against Kinder Bologna was the game in which he rose to the occasion by displaying all of his great qualities; with 22 points he ended the game as the best scorer of his side.

He later represented Ülkerspor, and İTÜ, in Turkey&#x27;s BSL and PAOK in Greece&#x27;s Basket League. He also played in the NBA, with the Seattle SuperSonics.

==National team career==
Kutluay was a member of the senior Turkish national basketball team. With Turkey, he won a silver medal at the 2001 EuroBasket. He also played at the following tournaments: the 1995 EuroBasket, the 1997 EuroBasket, the 1999 EuroBasket, the 2003 EuroBasket, the 2005 EuroBasket, the 2007 EuroBasket, the 2002 FIBA World Championship, and the 2006 FIBA World Championship.

==Player profile==
As a 6-foot-6 guard, Kutluay was viewed as one of the best perimeter shooters. Together with Harun Erdenay, Kutluay is ranked amongst the best scorers Turkey has ever produced. Kutluay became the fourth Turkish player to play in NBA, yet he failed to make a success of his career in the US. Kutluay has been praised for his mentality, leadership and modesty throughout his career.

==Post-playing career==
Kutluay began a career as a sports commentator, after he retired from playing basketball. In 2015, he joined the Turkish club Darüşşafaka, working as the club&#x27;s manager.

==Personal life and fame==
===Partners===
Kutluay has also been a cynosure of public attention due to his personal life. His relationship with singer Demet Akalın was extensively covered by tabloids. The couple made a decision to formalise their ties with a marriage on 5 July 2001, but according to Akalın, because of Kutluay&#x27;s last-minute change of mind, they separated. The survey, in which 16,000 respondents took place, conducted by the tabloid Radikal suggests that Kutluay-Akalın couple is remembered the most &#x27;unforgettable duo&#x27; of Turkish high-society life.

Kutluay&#x27;s marriage with another model Demet Şener, in which then Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan acted as a witness, was the key event of the Turkish high society life in 2005. The couple divorced in 2018, and Kutluay has since been in an open relationship with a society beauty Edvina Sponza.

Kutluay and Edwina Sponza have been regularly seen in high-end restaurants and clubs together. Ibrahim did attend her father&#x27;s funeral and was seen supporting her girlfriend at the time of grief. In January 2020, the couple were seen jogging together. Demet Şener criticised Kutluay&#x27;s late behavior towards her and has given interviews to media explaining her reasons for ending their marriage, but she also praised her former husband as a good father to their children, namely Irem and Ömer.

===Lifestyle===
In his interviews, Kutluay mentioned his adherence to healthy routine. He drinks very little, only socially once in a while, and does not have any toxic habits. Despite having retired from the game, Kutluay exercises regularly and keeps his form in a highly disciplined manner. He is also distinguished for his impeccable style and taste. Kutluay is a celebrated and passionate car fan and has had many glamorous sport cars in his possession. Yet due to his height (198 cm), he is reported to have found himself unable to fit into stylish vehicles, thus he has been compelled to order specially designed cars to meet his size-related demands.

<text>Virgil Franklin Partch (October 17, 1916 – August 10, 1984), who generally signed his work Vip, was an American gag cartoonist. His work appeared in magazines of the 1940s and 1950s, and he created the newspaper comic strips &quot;Big George&quot; and &quot;The Captain&#x27;s Gig&quot;. He published 19 books of illustrations and drew art for children&#x27;s books.

Despite being a gagwriter for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, his own cartoons were rarely published there because, according to comics historian Bhob Stewart, &quot;&quot;New Yorker&quot; editor Harold Ross disliked VIP&#x27;s drawing style.&quot;

==Early life and career==
Born in Alaska, from a mother with the maiden name Pavlof, Partch studied at the University of Arizona and the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles. He later worked for the Disney studios, where he was among those fired after taking part in the Disney animators&#x27; strike of 1941. Partch was a co-writer with Dick Shaw on the 1945 Donald Duck short film &quot;Duck Pimples&quot;. Soon, he began selling gag cartoons to large-circulation magazines, including &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Playboy&quot;, and &quot;True&quot;. After he left Disney, he worked briefly for Walter Lantz on Woody Woodpecker cartoons.

Partch was drafted into the US Army in 1944, and by the end of his two-year stint had been transferred from the infantry to become art director and cartoonist of the Army&#x27;s weekly newspaper, the Fort Ord &quot;Panorama.&quot;

Out of the Army, Partch freelanced for ERA Productions. He published a number of books of single-panel cartoons, some previously published, others done specifically for the books. His 1950 bestseller, &quot;Bottle Fatigue,&quot; focused on alcohol-themed humor, sold nearly 95,000 hardcover copies by the decade&#x27;s end.

==Syndicated cartoonist==

Later in his career, Partch drew the successful syndicated comic strip &quot;Big George&quot; It was a six-day-a-week single panel cartoon about a typical husband when introduced in 1960.

Partch created the strip, &quot;The Captain&#x27;s Gig&quot; (about a motley bunch of mariners and castaways), syndicated by Field Enterprises. He also illustrated several children&#x27;s books including &quot;The Dog Who Snored Symphonies&quot; and &quot;The Christmas Cookie Sprinkle Snatcher&quot;.

From 1956, Partch lived in a house on the cliffs above Corona del Mar, Newport Beach. He often joined the cartoonists who regularly met at midday in the bar at the White House restaurant on the Pacific Coast Highway in Laguna Beach: Phil and Frank Interlandi, Ed Nofziger, John Dempsey, Don Tobin, Roger Armstrong, Dick Shaw, and Dick Oldden. The gathering began after Phil Interlandi moved to Laguna Beach in 1952. &quot;That was the first bar I walked into in Laguna,&quot; Interlandi explained in 1982, &quot;and it became a habit.&quot;

==Later life and death==
In 1979, Partch was awarded the Inkpot Award. With the onset of cataracts, Partch retired from cartooning in January 1984, and donated his collection of 3,700 original cartoons to the University of California, Irvine library. Partch and his wife died in an auto accident August 10, 1984, on Interstate 5 near Valencia, California. Due to his aggressive creative efforts, at the time of his death he left behind enough &quot;Big George&quot; panels for the feature to continue for six more years of new material.

His cousin was the composer Harry Partch.

<doc id="1319983" wikidata="Q2334039" url="?curid=1319983" title="Larry Johnson (running back)">
<text>Larry Alphonso Johnson Jr. (born November 19, 1979) is an American former professional football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Penn State Nittany Lions, winning the Maxwell Award and earning unanimous All-American honors in 2002. He was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs in the first round of the 2003 NFL draft, and also played for the Cincinnati Bengals, the Washington Redskins, and the Miami Dolphins.

==Early life==
Johnson was born in State College, Pennsylvania. He was one of three children born to Christine and Larry Johnson Sr. His father is a former high school vice-principal, a high school football coach, former defensive line coach at Penn State University, and the current defensive line coach at Ohio State University. Johnson graduated from State College Area High School in State College, Pennsylvania, where he played for the State College Little Lions high school football team.

==College career==
Johnson attended Pennsylvania State University, and played for coach Joe Paterno&#x27;s Penn State Nittany Lions football team from 1999 to 2002. As a senior in 2002, he rushed for over 2,000 yards in a season without winning the Heisman Trophy, despite doing so with fewer carries than any other running back in the 2,000-yard club (this record was broken on November 22, 2014, by Wisconsin&#x27;s Melvin Gordon, who gained 2,000 yards on 241 carries—10 fewer than Johnson&#x27;s 251). He averaged 8.0 yards per carry during the regular season. Johnson broke the Penn State record for rushing yards in a game three times in 2002. His 257 yards in a 49–0 home thrashing of Northwestern broke Curt Warner&#x27;s previous record of 256 yards set against Syracuse in 1981. He then went on to rack up 279 yards in an 18–7 home win against Illinois and 327 yards in a 58–25 road win against Indiana. He surpassed the 2,000-yard mark by gaining 279 yards on just 19 attempts in the Penn State Nittany Lions&#x27; final Big Ten Conference game against Michigan State. Johnson gained all 279 of his rushing yards in the first half, and was kept on the bench for the entire second half of the game. He finished the 2002 season with 2,087 yards.

Following his 2002 senior season, Johnson was a first-team All-Big Ten selection and a unanimous first-team All-American. He also won the Doak Walker Award (top running back), the Maxwell Award (top college player), and the Walter Camp Award (top college player). Johnson rushed for 2,159 yards and 29 touchdowns.
He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in integrative arts from Penn State in 2002.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==

===Kansas City Chiefs===
====2003–06====
Johnson was chosen in the first round with the 27th overall pick of the 2003 NFL draft as insurance for the Kansas City Chiefs, who were unsure if Priest Holmes would be healthy or even sign a contract extension. Johnson was drafted over the objection of head coach Dick Vermeil, who wanted to select a defensive player, and despite the lack of recent NFL success by Penn State running backs (Blair Thomas, Ki-Jana Carter, and Curtis Enis). Vermeil criticized Johnson for his casual approach toward preparation. The conflicts between Johnson and Vermeil grew, and in 2004 Vermeil said that Johnson needed to grow up and &quot;take the diapers off.&quot;

Johnson took great offense to this comment, and the public estrangement led to rumors that he would be traded. However, towards the end of the 2004 season, Johnson got an opportunity to start after injuries to Priest Holmes and Derrick Blaylock.

Facing the same situation in 2005, with Blaylock gone and Holmes having gone down with a season-ending neck injury in early November, Johnson on November 20 against the Houston Texans ran for a Chiefs&#x27; record 211 rushing yards and two touchdowns. He led the league in rushing yards and touchdowns after the injury to Holmes.
At the end of the 2005 regular season, Johnson had nine consecutive games with 100+ rushing yards, passing the 100-yard mark in every start for the Chiefs that season and earning a Pro Bowl berth. During the final game of the 2005 regular season, Johnson set a new franchise record of 1,750 rushing yards in one season, despite not starting in 7 games during the season. In addition Johnson caught 33 passes for 343 yards, averaging over 10 yards per reception. Johnson was named the 2005 MVP for the Chiefs. The Chiefs&#x27; record in 2005 was 10–6, but they did not make the playoffs in spite of a winning record.

With injuries limiting Holmes during the previous two seasons, Johnson began the 2006 season as Kansas City&#x27;s featured back. He rushed for 1,789 yards (second in the league) on 416 carries, an NFL record for most carries in a season. The Chiefs made an appearance in the playoffs with a 9–7 record, where Johnson ran for 32 yards on 13 carries against the Indianapolis Colts. At the conclusion of the season, Johnson was selected for his second Pro Bowl appearance.

====2007–09====
On June 21, 2007, Johnson stated that he was willing to sit out the Chiefs&#x27; training camp unless he and the Chiefs reached an agreement on a new contract. On July 22, rumors spread about Johnson being traded to the Green Bay Packers. The initial asking price was a first-, second-, and third-round draft pick. Starting on July 27 with the beginning of training camp, he began a holdout during which he was fined $14,000 per day by the team, and did not report to training camp until nearly a month later when he and the team agreed to a five-year contract extension that locked Johnson up with the Chiefs through the 2012 season. As a result of the extension, Johnson was the highest-paid running back in the NFL based on average salary per year. His new contract covered six years and was to pay him $45 million, with $19 million in guaranteed money—the biggest contract in Chiefs history.

In week 9 of the 2007 regular season, Johnson was sidelined late in the 4th quarter against the Green Bay Packers with a foot injury. The injury was season-ending; Johnson did not see any playing time in the rest of the 2007 season, and was placed on the injured reserve list. Johnson ended the season with 559 yards on 158 attempts, and only three rushing touchdowns.
In Johnson&#x27;s first regular season game since his injury, he rushed for 74 yards on 22 carries with an average of 3.4 yards per carry against the New England Patriots on September 7, 2008. The Chiefs lost the game 17–10. After a loss to the Oakland Raiders the following week, Johnson spoke out about his low number of carries. In his next two games, Johnson rushed for a combined 319 yards on 52 attempts with an average of 6.1 yards per carry.

Johnson was suspended for the Chiefs&#x27; game against the Tennessee Titans on October 18 for violating team rules. Johnson also was benched for the following game against the New York Jets. Johnson, after weeks of being inactive for the Chiefs, was suspended by league commissioner Roger Goodell for the team&#x27;s week 10 game against the San Diego Chargers, for violating the league&#x27;s personal conduct policy, after he was charged with simple assault for allegedly spitting his drink in a woman&#x27;s face (the fourth time in five years he had been accused of assaulting a woman), and as he awaited a court date for allegedly pushing another woman&#x27;s face. The suspension cost him $147,000; one game check. He finished the season with 874 yards and five touchdowns.

Johnson&#x27;s 2009 season got off to a very slow start, despite Johnson keeping his starting job. As of week 8, he had 132 attempts for only 358 yards. His 2.7 yards per carry were the worst of any NFL running back with at least 70 carries.

On October 27, 2009, the Chiefs &quot;instructed Larry to refrain from practicing with the Chiefs or participating in other team activities&quot; for his Twitter comments on Chiefs&#x27; head coach Todd Haley and reportedly using gay slurs when he addressed the media. Because of his comments, Johnson encountered backlash from the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. Johnson&#x27;s Twitter comments were: &quot;My father got more credentials than most of these pro coaches.&quot; That was followed by: &quot;My father played for the coach from &quot;remember the titans&quot;. Our coach played golf. My father played for redskins briefley. Our coach. Nuthn.&quot; Johnson&#x27;s tweets were responded to by fans, one tweet including a reference to his nightclub incident. Johnson&#x27;s response used the word &quot;fag&quot;. The final post read: &quot;Make me regret it. Lmao. U don&#x27;t stop my checks. Lmao. So &#x27;tweet&#x27; away.&quot; Johnson subsequently said about the incidents, &quot;First of all, I want to apologize to the fans of the Kansas City Chiefs and the rest of the NFL, Commissioner Goodell, the Chiefs organization, Coach Todd Haley, his staff, and my teammates for the words I used yesterday. I regret my actions. The words were used by me in frustration, and they were not appropriate.&quot;

On October 28, 2009, the Chiefs suspended Johnson until November 9 for &quot;conduct detrimental to the club&quot;. They ultimately agreed to a deal with his agent, Peter Schaffer, in which he would only lose one game check ($300,000). At the time of the suspension, Johnson was only 75 yards from passing Priest Holmes as the franchise&#x27;s all-time leading rusher. This angered several fans, who started a petition demanding that the Chiefs either deactivate, release, or waive him. The petition said that Johnson &quot;has never represented anything close to the values that we have for our Chiefs&quot; and thus did not deserve the record.

On November 9, the day Johnson was due to return from his suspension, the Chiefs waived him. Reportedly, the final straw for Chiefs general manager Scott Pioli was yet another tweet in which Johnson belittled a fan for making less money than he made. Johnson&#x27;s agent, Schaffer, issued the following statement: &quot;A part of him is excited and a part of him is very regretful. There&#x27;s a lot of feelings going on right now. It&#x27;s analogous to breaking up with a girlfriend. Maybe you saw it coming, but it still hurts when it happens.&quot;

===Cincinnati Bengals===
In November 2009, Johnson signed with the Cincinnati Bengals for the prorated league minimum pay. Johnson served as backup to starting running back Cedric Benson. In the Bengals week 12 win over the Browns, Johnson rushed for 107 yards, his only 100-yard game of the season.

===Washington Redskins===
Johnson signed a three-year contract worth up to $12 million with the Washington Redskins as an unrestricted free agent on March 12, 2010. He played for former Denver Broncos coach Mike Shanahan. On September 21, 2010, Johnson was released by the Redskins.

===Miami Dolphins===
In July of 2011, Johnson went on a local radio station in Florida and predicted that he would be signed to the Miami Dolphins. 

On August 23, 2011, Johnson signed with the Miami Dolphins. On September 3, the Dolphins terminated Johnson&#x27;s contract during final roster cuts. He rushed for 46 yards and one touchdown on 12 carries in the 2011 preseason. However, he was re-signed on September 8 after an injury to Daniel Thomas. He was released following the Dolphins&#x27; week 2 loss to the Houston Texans, when he ran the ball only once for a two-yard gain.

==NFL career statistics==
===Regular season===
===Postseason===
===NFL records===
* Most rushing attempts in a single season: 416 (2006)

===Chiefs franchise records===
* Most career rushing attempts (1,375)

==Personal life==
Johnson and his father, Larry Sr., maintain a close relationship. Johnson&#x27;s brother and manager, Tony Johnson, is a former starting wide receiver for Penn State from 2000 to 2003.

Johnson appeared on the cover of the PlayStation 2 game &quot;NCAA GameBreaker 2004&quot; in a Penn State uniform. In 2007, Johnson appeared in Fantasia&#x27;s music video for the song &quot;When I See U&quot;. Johnson also made an appearance in Jay-Z&#x27;s music video &quot;Roc Boys (And the Winner Is)...&quot;. In October 2013, TMZ reported that Johnson had been a recurring guest DJ at Miami strip club Tootsie&#x27;s Cabaret.

Because of memory loss, suicidal impulses, mood swings, and headaches, Johnson believes he has chronic traumatic encephalopathy (which can&#x27;t be diagnosed until an autopsy is performed on the brain after death). Johnson also states that he does not remember playing two seasons. His method of dealing with the trauma is to control his social interactions and spend quality time with his daughter.

===Controversies===
Since 2020, Johnson has been criticized for posts on his Twitter account including antisemitic comments such as claiming Jews worship Satan, and attributing fake quotes to the Bible. CNN reporter Jake Tapper called his comments explicitly &quot;antisemitic garbage&quot;, due to references to a &quot;jewish cabal&quot; and posting alleged quotes regarding &quot;jews toy(ing) with the public as a cat toys with a mouse&quot; or worshipping [satan].&quot; Johnson&#x27;s tweets have also touched on topics common among conspiracy theory proponents, including freemasonry. He frequently tweets conspiracy theories about celebrity deaths, including the death of Kobe Bryant, which he claimed that LeBron James made a &quot;blood sacrifice&quot; to kill Bryant in exchange for the Los Angeles Lakers winning the 2020 NBA Finals. He also claims Tom Brady and other NFL players are part of the occult, and that the NFL rigs and scripts games.

==Legal troubles==
Johnson has been arrested at least six times since 2003. Five of his arrests were on various assault charges against women, four while he was an active player in the NFL.

In December 2003, he was arrested for felony aggravated assault and misdemeanor domestic battery for slapping and waving a gun at his then-girlfriend as he threatened her, during an argument at his home. The charges were dropped after Johnson agreed to participate in a domestic violence diversion program. He was required to complete 120 hours of community service, attend an anger management course, and stay out of trouble for two years.

In September 2005, Johnson was again arrested for assault when a 25-year-old woman accused Johnson of pushing her to the ground in a Kansas City bar. Johnson turned himself in and was cited for domestic abuse assault; he posted bond and was released. But the case was dropped after the alleged victim failed to appear in court for three hearings.

His third arrest for assault came in February 2008, after he allegedly shoved a 26-year-old woman&#x27;s head at a Kansas City nightclub.

In October 2008, Johnson was arrested for the fourth time and charged with one count of non-aggravated assault for allegedly spitting a drink in a 24-year-old woman&#x27;s face and threatening to kill her boyfriend at a Kansas City nightclub on October 11. The woman filed a civil suit against Johnson, accusing him of negligence, assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress.

Johnson was deactivated for the October 19, 2008, game against the Tennessee Titans for violating an undisclosed team rule. The team said his suspension for the game was unrelated to the criminal investigation.

In March 2009, Johnson pleaded guilty to two counts of disturbing the peace, regarding the two incidents in 2008, and was sentenced to two years&#x27; probation. In July 2010 a judge admonished him in court for failing to perform his full community service, said he &quot;puts people in jail every day for not doing community service,&quot; but chose not to do so and instead reinstated Johnson&#x27;s probation. The City Prosecutor said he was supposed to send a monthly form to his probation officer, but failed to, and also failed to report to his probation officer that he had been stopped by police in Virginia and cited for not having a driver&#x27;s license. After the 20-minute hearing, Johnson walked out of the courtroom smiling.

On October 5, 2012, Johnson was again arrested, in Las Vegas for domestic violence charges that included beating and strangulation of a former girlfriend at the Bellagio resort Las Vegas Strip hotel and casino. The 32-year-old woman was said to have had several injuries to her face, bruising on her neck, and been choked into unconsciousness. Johnson pretended to run from hotel security officers, and told one security officer he would rip his vocal cords out. He was booked into the Clark County Detention Center with bond set at $15,000, and was released after spending 18 hours behind bars. He faced a maximum five years in jail, and a $15,000 fine. However, a felony charge was dropped as part of a plea deal, and he was ruled guilty of misdemeanor domestic violence battery and assault, and sentenced to one year of probation and ordered to pay a $345 fine, perform 48 hours of community service, and attend six months of counseling.

On October 7, 2014, Johnson was arrested for the sixth time after punching a 29-year-old man in a Miami Beach club, and allegedly cutting him with a broken bottle. He was charged with aggravated battery and booked into the Miami-Dade County jail with bond set at $7,500. Johnson later pleaded guilty to battery and was sentenced to 12 months&#x27; probation, 60 hours of community service, and must submit to substance abuse evaluations, and stay away from the victim and the club.

<doc id="1320010" wikidata="Q6970745" url="?curid=1320010" title="National Association of Rocketry">
<text>The National Association of Rocketry (NAR) is a non-profit tax-exempt scientific organization dedicated to consumer safety, youth education, and the advancement of technology in the hobby of sport rocketry in the United States. Founded in 1957, the NAR is the oldest and largest spacemodeling organization in the world with over 8,000 members and 200 affiliated clubs (known as &quot;Sections&quot;) across the U.S. It was established in 1957 by Orville Carlisle and G. Harry Stine. It supports all aspects of safe consumer sport rocket flying, from small model rockets with youth groups to very large high-power rockets flown by adult hobbyists.

The NAR is a recognized national authority for performance and reliability certification of consumer rocket motors and for the certification of high-power rocket fliers in the U.S. The NAR is the author of a Model Rocket Safety Code for consumer model rocketry and a High Power Rocket Safety Code for high-power sport rocketry that are recognized and accepted by manufacturers and public safety officials nationwide. The NAR plays a strong role in the establishment of national rocketry safety standards for public safety officials through its participation in the National Fire Protection Association.

==Governance==

The NAR is governed by a board of trustees consisting of nine senior members (age 21 and over) of the NAR, elected by vote of members age 16 and older. Trustees serve for terms of three years, with three of the nine positions coming up for election each year. The president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer of the NAR are elected by the board from within these nine. The president serves as the chief operating officer on a day-to-day basis and is authorized to transact the NAR&#x27;s business as directed by the board of trustees and in accordance with the NAR&#x27;s by-laws.

The NAR board meets twice per year, just before NARCON in the late winter and NARAM in midsummer. These meetings provide direction to the president, establish the NAR&#x27;s policies, and oversee its finances. In between board meetings, a board-approved executive committee of three trustees is empowered to act in the stead of the board, subject to ratification of any actions by the board at its next meeting.

Most of the NAR&#x27;s services are delivered through standing committees. These committees report to the board of trustees via an assigned liaison or are headed by a Trustee directly. The current standing committees include Membership, Education, Technical Services (“NARTS”), NARTREK (skills education program), National Events, Periodicals, Section Activities, High Power Rocketry Services, Standards and Testing, Safety, and NAR Historian.

Ad-hoc committees may be established from time to time to address temporary or one-time requirements. A Special Committee for the Enhancement of National Events is currently exploring ways to attract more members to the NAR&#x27;s national events and to encourage greater participation in rocketry competition.

==Education and outreach==
===NAR Scholarship===
The NAR Scholarship program was announced at NARAM-43 in 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scholarship/Cannon/EAG overview&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A limited number of $2000 scholarships are available each year to NAR members between the ages of 17 and 22 who are planning to attend, or are currently enrolled in a college, university or technical school. The number of awards is determined annually by the board of trustees, and scholarships are presented annually at NARAM.

===Robert L. Cannon Educator Award===
In 2001, the NAR instituted the Robert L. Cannon Educator Award in memory of Bob Cannon, who spent many years at Estes Industries introducing teachers to the potential of model rocketry as a teaching tool. Up to ten $500 grants are provided each year to teachers who use rocketry in their classrooms.

===Extracurricular Activity Grant===

In 2015, the NAR instituted the Extracurricular Activity Grant (EAG) to provide up to ten $500 grants for after-school activities. An applicant must be a member or representative of an organization providing educational activities for children. (Examples include 4-H, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Civil Air Patrol, Challenger Centers, and museums that provide extracurricular educational activities involving model rocketry.)

===narTcert===
The NAR Rocket Teacher Certification Program (narTcert) is a program to train teachers in the skills to build and fly model rockets and the confidence to lead a rocketry lesson in the classroom. NAR certified teachers are recognized as having been trained by NAR to be qualified to conduct launches, organize rocket programs with hands on STEM lessons for their school, and support the Team America Rocketry Challenge. Certification is open to NAR members who are professional classroom teachers, educators teaching after school programs, home school teachers, or informal educators with youth organizations.

===Partnerships===
In May 2007 the NAR and 4-H initiated a national partnership to encourage more youth to fly rockets, form rocket clubs and TARC teams, and more young people becoming scientists and engineers. The partnership has been very successful with a 4-H team from Georgetown, Texas winning first place at TARC and becoming the international champions in 2013.

The NAR and the Museum of Flight executed a Memorandum of Understanding in 2013 to develop a major sport rocketry exhibit and host the archival collections of G. Harry Stine and Vern and Gleda Estes, key figures in the history of the rocketry hobby. This is the first permanent exhibit exclusively for model rocketry in an American museum, and was dedicated on February 21, 2015.

The NAR and the Civil Air Patrol signed a Memorandum of Understanding in 2014 to become partners in educational rocketry. The two organizations are exploring ways to provide opportunities for youth and adults to initiate or increase their participation in model rocketry by collaborating on joint activities such as TARC, local rocket contests, science fairs, design challenges, space-related activities, sport launches and other related activities.

The NAR also provides mentoring, launch services, and technical support for NASA&#x27;s Student Launch program, which culminates in a launch of experimental payloads on high-power rockets near Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama each April.

==High Power Rocketry Certification==

Any model rocket using a single motor greater than 160 Newton-seconds of total impulse, or multiple motors with a total thrust of 320 Newton-seconds, is propelled by a combination of motors having a total of more than of propellant weight, or weighs more than with motors installed, is classified as a high-power rocket under National Fire Protection Association Standard 1127.

The NAR offers a three tier certification program for adult members who wish to build and fly High Power rockets (HPR), as well as a Junior HPR program for NAR members aged 14 through 17.

===Level 1===
HPR Level 1 Certification allows the purchase and use of H and I impulse class motors, both solid and hybrid. In addition, certain F and G motors also require Level 1 certification for purchase and use, including hybrid motors, motors designed to emit sparks, and motors that exceed 80 Newtons average thrust, contain 125 or more grams of propellant, or are in rockets weighing more than 1500 grams.

An individual seeking Level 1 certification must be a minimum of 18 years old at the time of certification and a member in good standing of the NAR. The member attempting certification must build a rocket containing at least one H or I-class motor. The individual must fly the rocket successfully in the presence of a certification team, who evaluate the rocket&#x27;s flight for stability, deployment of the recovery system, and safe recovery.
====Junior Level 1====
NAR members aged 14 through 17 may earn Junior Level 1 certification by successfully building and flying a high-power rocket with an H or I class motor. The principal restriction on Junior Level 1 rocketeers is that an adult must handle, prepare, and install all high-power motors.

===Level 2===
Level 2 certification allows an individual to purchase and fly J, K, and L class motors. In addition to current NAR membership and Level 1 certification, a rocketeer attempting Level 2 certification must pass a written exam, build the rocket they wish to use for the certification attempt, and successfully fly the rocket with a J, K, or L class motor in the presence of a certification team.

===Level 3===
Level 3 certification allows the NAR member to purchase and fly M, N, and O class high-power motors. The applicant must submit detailed plans for approval before beginning construction of the rocket, employ electronic deployment of the recovery system (normally a drogue parachute at maximum altitude followed by a main parachute a few hundred feet above the ground), and successfully fly the rocket in the presence of the certification team.

==National events==
===NARCON===
The NAR&#x27;s National Convention (NARCON) is usually held during the late winter. The three-day event includes technical presentations, guest speakers, and a Saturday night banquet, and is often held at a historic destination such as Cape Canaveral or the Museum of Flight.

===National Sport Launch===
The National Sport Launch (NSL) is a large, non-competitive (&quot;sport&quot;) launch, normally held over Memorial Day weekend. NSL attracts hundreds of participants of all ages, who fly rockets of all sizes and motor classes. Certification teams are usually available for rocketeers wishing to attempt high-power certification.

===NARAM===
The National Association of Rocketry Annual Meet (NARAM) is the NAR&#x27;s annual model rocketry championship. NARAM is normally held during late July or early August at a site large enough for simultaneous competition, sport, and high-power rocket flights.

The first NARAM was held in 1959, two years after the NAR was formed. Historically, NARAM was rooted in competition and determining national champions. Today, NARAM may include an FAI Spacemodeling Team flyoff (meant to select a team of competitors who represent the US at a world level competition); a sport flying range featuring model and high-power rockets, an auction to support scholarship and education funds, research and development presentations, and a closing banquet where performance awards are given out. The competition component at NARAM is now the culmination of a preseason of flying under the National Rocketry Competition (NRC)- a new competition format that is simpler, less expensive, and designed to allow young members easier access to the joys of competition.

===The America Rocketry Challenge===
NAR co-sponsors The America Rocketry Challenge (TARC) with the Aerospace Industries Association. TARC is a national rocketry competition for students in 7th through 12th grades that culminates in a National Finals contest for the top 100 teams each May. While the specific challenge for TARC varies from year to year, the event always involves flying one or more raw eggs to a specified altitude and a specified flight duration, without damaging the egg.

Competition

Prior to July 1, 2017, NAR sections (local groups of members) across the country would hold contests known as “meets” over the course of a “contest year” which runs July 1 to June 30 and includes a NARAM held shortly thereafter. There were four levels of meets- Section, Local, Open, and Regional. Each had different requirements on the minimum number of competitors and the geographic distribution of those competitors. Competitors attending these contests did so in the interest of earning “points” which they would accumulate during the course of the contest year which ended on June 30. Once the contest year ended, NARAM would be held and those competitors who could attend, would carry their accumulated point over to NARAM where they could earn more points. At an awards banquet that concluded NARAM, those competitors with the most points in each of four competition divisions, would receive awards for event performance (such as parachute duration) and National Champions (those with the greatest point totals) would be crowned. On July 1, 2017, after nearly 3 years of development, and in response to a steadily falling number of members involved in competition, a new US Model Rocket sporting Code (USMRSC) was implemented. The new Sporting Code described an entirely new competition format- the National Rocketry Competition or NRC. The intent of the NRC being to make contest rocketry more approachable, less expensive, and allow young members easier access to competition. The previous points structure was removed. Rules were created that allow members to fly competition as frequently as they want, wherever they can, with as few as just two members. NARAM 60 in 2018 was the culmination of the first year of competition under the NRC.

Any NAR member may participate in sanctioned competition. Most competition events fall into one of three categories:
* Altitude events - Modelers compete to achieve either the maximum altitude or an altitude specified by the contest director.
* Duration events - Modelers compete to achieve either the maximum flight duration or a duration specified by the contest director.
* Craftsmanship events - Modelers build and fly accurate replicas of actual or planned full-size rockets.

===United States Model Rocket Sporting Code - USMRSC===
Model rocket competition in the United States is governed by the United States Model Rocketry Sporting Code (USMRSC), also known as the &quot;Sporting Code.&quot; An annual rules change process (RCP) permits NAR members to propose improvements and corrections to the Sporting Code. Any member may submit a proposal, which is posted online for a public comment period. Following the comment period, the authors of the proposals have one opportunity to adjust their RCP based on member feedback. The RCP process concludes with a member vote on the proposals. Those RCP&#x27;s that pass get added to the Sporting Code in time for the next competition year.

===International competition===
A World Spacemodeling Championships (WSMC) has been held by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) about every two years since 1972, normally in late August or early September of even-numbered years. The U.S. Team for a WSMC is selected by a flyoff process that is held at the opening weekend of NARAM one year prior to the WSMC. The flyoff is open to all U.S. NAR members.

==Publications==

===&quot;Sport Rocketry&quot;===
&quot;Sport Rocketry&quot; is the official journal of the National Association of Rocketry. &quot;Sport Rocketry&quot; is the longest continually published magazine devoted to the sport rocket hobby. It is published bi-monthly and features regional launch coverage, construction and technical articles, rocket plans, scale data, competition tips, and product reviews.

===&quot;The Electronic Rocketeer&quot;===
&quot;The Electronic Rocketeer&quot; is a monthly online publication edited by the NAR president. A typical issue may include breaking news, a safety note, and links to popular pages on the NAR&#x27;s website.

===&quot;The Model Rocketeer&quot;===
&quot;The Model Rocketeer&quot; is a 6-10 page newsletter published in the spring of each year. It contains a brief article from the NAR president, biographies of the year&#x27;s candidates for the board of trustees, and a mail-in ballot for the Trustee Election.

===Member Guidebook===
The NAR Member Guidebook is sent to everyone who joins the NAR or renews their membership. It contains technical tips for beginning, intermediate, and advanced rocketeers, as well as an introduction to NAR&#x27;s insurance policy and member services. It is updated every two years.

===Educator&#x27;s Newsletter===
The Educator&#x27;s Newsletter is a bi-monthly electronic publication for K-12 teachers. Topics include curriculum suggestions, aerospace history, TARC guidance, and other rocketry-related information of interest to the classroom teacher.

==NARTS==
NAR Technical Services, known as NARTS, offers rocketry-related items that are difficult to find or exclusive to the NAR. NARTS offerings include technical publications, NAR-themed clothing, and supplies for running competition meets.

==NARTREK==
The National Association of Rocketry Training Rocketeers for Experience and Knowledge (NARTREK) is a skill development program consisting of a series of achievement levels in rocketry. NARTREK has three basic achievement levels (Bronze, Silver, Gold), with numerous follow-on specialty levels. NARTREK is designed to help a rocketeer progress from basic skills to the ability to design a rocket and accurately predict its performance.

===NARTREK Cadet program===
The NARTREK Cadet differs from the standard NARTREK Program in that it is designed specifically for modelers under age 18, and it is open to both members and non-members of the NAR. NARTREK Cadet consists of a series of four achievement levels in rocketry, each requiring more skill to complete than the previous one.

==Standards and testing==
State and federal law require all rocket motors to be independently tested before they may be sold in the United States. The NAR Standards and Testing Committee (“S&amp;T”) performs this quality assurance for every individual rocket motor type and classification available to general consumers at its East Coast testing facilities at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and its West Coast testing facilities in Hillsboro, Oregon.

S&amp;T also re-tests each approved motor type every five years to ensure repeatability and help identify creeping degradation in manufacturing or distribution practices. In addition, S&amp;T collects and reduces data from motor malfunction reports sent in by consumers, using this data to trigger special testing of questionable motors and production lots.

==Liability insurance==
NAR membership includes general liability coverage as a membership benefit. This coverage is intended to help protect NAR members from liabilities arising out of NAR sport rocketry activities, including both model and high-power rockets. The policy limit is currently $5,000,000 per occurrence, with a $5,000 deductible per bodily injury and property damage claim.

==Advocacy==
The NAR (along with the Tripoli Rocketry Association, the other major governing body in hobby rocketry) was involved in a nine-year lawsuit against the BATFE regarding the status of Ammonium Perchlorate Composite Propellant (APCP), the most common composite propellant used in hobby rocketry, as an explosive. The NAR and TRA won the lawsuit in 2009, deregulating APCP.

<text>Shuttlecraft are fictional vehicles in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction franchise built for short trips in space, such as between a planetary surface and orbit. Also referred to as shuttles, their introduction preceded the development of the Space Shuttle.

Before &quot;Star Trek&quot;, science fiction productions from &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; to &quot;Rocky Jones, Space Ranger&quot; assumed that a long-range starship would land on planets. Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s original premise stated that the starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; rarely lands. Given the special effects complexity of landing a giant starship each week, &quot;rarely&quot; was quickly changed to &quot;never&quot;. Dated March 1964, the premise mentions a &quot;small shuttle rocket&quot;. The shuttle rocket was too expensive to build for the first episodes. For most of the series the transporter served to teleport characters on and off the ship.

In the first year of &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;, the need quickly developed for shuttlecraft. Used to carry personnel, cargo and reconnaissance payloads, shuttles filled the same need as boats on a navy ship. They were also used by starbases. For television writers, they served the dramatic function of putting characters in a small ship that could get lost. Though shuttlecraft were initially expensive to build, they were eventually used in every &quot;Star Trek&quot; series. Shuttlecraft designs were often shared across different media, for example the Danube-class runabout featured heavily in &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, was also featured in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;.

== &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; ==

Art director Matt Jefferies originally envisioned a sleek, streamlined shuttle based upon his background as a pilot. The curved shape proved too expensive to build for the first episodes. AMT offered to build a full-sized shuttlecraft at no cost in exchange for rights to market a model kit. The final design of the mockup, by Gene Winfield, is 24 feet (7.2 m) long and weighs one ton, has a plywood hull, and was built in two months by a team of 12 people. A separate set was used for interior scenes as the mockup was too small for filming. This boxlike, utilitarian shape became the prototype of shuttles throughout &quot;Star Trek&quot;. The shuttlecraft, named for Galileo Galilei, was first featured in &quot;The Galileo Seven&quot;. Its registration number is NCC-1701/7 and carries a crew of seven. When &quot;Galileo&quot; and her crew go missing in the episode a second shuttlecraft called &quot;Columbus&quot; is launched.

Once the shuttlecraft had been established, footage of them appeared in episodes including &quot;The Menagerie&quot;, &quot;The Doomsday Machine&quot;, &quot;Journey to Babel&quot;, &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;, &quot;The Immunity Syndrome&quot;, and &quot;The Way to Eden&quot;. In the latter episode, the full-size mockup sported the name &quot;Galileo II&quot;, acknowledging that the original shuttlecraft was lost during &quot;The Galileo Seven&quot;. During &quot;The Omega Glory&quot;, the USS &quot;Exeter&quot;, a starship of the same class as the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, is said to carry four shuttlecraft.

The &quot;Galileo&quot; shuttlecraft (a full-size theatrical prop) was not dismantled, but passed through the possession of several owners. The 1966 mockup was sold at auction for $70,150 in summer 2012. The new owner, Adam Schneider, a collector of Trek screen-used items, spent nine months restoring the &quot;Galileo&quot; in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey. It was then donated to NASA&#x27;s Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center Museum in Houston. The shuttlecraft &quot;Galileo&quot; was formally unveiled at Space Center Houston on July 31, 2013. In 2014, the prop was used again in a film production and appeared in a scene of the fan-made &quot;Star Trek Continues&quot; episode &quot;Fairest of Them All&quot;.

== &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot; ==
Freed from the constraints of what could be physically built, &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot; introduced audiences to a variety of spacecraft. A larger shuttlecraft, sporting a long nose similar to &quot;Star Wars&quot; X-wing fighter (years before their first appearance), appeared in &quot;The Slaver Weapon&quot;. The episode &quot;Mudd&#x27;s Passion&quot; featured a different shuttlecraft design. &quot;The Ambergris Element&quot; featured an &quot;aquashuttle&quot;, capable of landing on a water-covered planet and submerging. The ambitious scope of this Filmation animated series was a foretaste of what would someday be possible with computer graphics.

== &quot;Star Trek&quot; films ==
With its large budget, &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; showed a variety of shuttle-type vehicles operating near Earth. Though the transporter is nearly always available, shuttles provided a dramatic way for characters to enter. A passenger shuttle carrying Admiral James T. Kirk is shown landing in San Francisco. Kirk travels from an Earth-orbiting Space station to &quot;Enterprise&quot; in a barrel-shaped &quot;travel pod&quot;. Spock docks with &quot;Enterprise&quot; in a shuttle named for the Vulcan philosopher Surak, which carries Warp drive nacelles on a detachable sled. Matte paintings of the cargo deck show that the refurbished &quot;Enterprise&quot; carries shuttles similar to the &quot;Surak&quot; but without the warp drive sled, indicating that this is a standard shuttle design.

&quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; depicts the &quot;Travel Pod&quot; shuttlecraft.

&quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;, the next film in the series was made with a much lower budget. Footage of Kirk&#x27;s arrival in a travel pod was recycled from &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;. In &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot;, shuttles were seen as background elements in the spacedock. At the end of &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot;, passenger shuttles appear both in spacedock and to rescue the crew from San Francisco Bay. At the movie&#x27;s end, a travel pod is seen again carrying Kirk and crew to the &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

&quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot; featured many scenes with updated shuttlecrafts, also sporting the name &quot;Galileo&quot; as well as &quot;Copernicus&quot;. The design was similar in size and shape to the original series shuttle, with updated engine nacelles and a large rear hatch. The miniature shuttle and landing bay were built by Greg Jein. The shuttle was also built as a full-sized prop berthed in a full-scale hangar deck set.

&quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot; contained a scene of a &quot;spacedock ferry&quot;. The miniature was later modified to appear as the &quot;Jenolen&quot; in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Relics&quot;.

Among movies featuring the Next Generation cast, &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; shows several shuttlecraft used to evacuate a crashed &quot;Enterprise&quot;. &quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot; featured both a new design shuttlecraft and a captain&#x27;s yacht. &quot;Star Trek Nemesis&quot; introduced &quot;Argo&quot;, a shuttle designed to carry a land vehicle in a rear compartment.

== &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; ==

USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; (NCC-1701-D) of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; was designed with a highly curved and sculpted shape. Designer Andrew Probert, like Matt Jefferies before him, designed a shuttle with a streamlined shape. Miniature footage of this design was seen in episodes such as &quot;Coming of Age&quot;, &quot;The Child&quot; and &quot;Unnatural Selection&quot;. Referred to as a Type 7 shuttle, it had a projected length of 8.5 m. As before, the series lacked the resources to build the complex shape of this shuttle as a full-scale prop.

The script for &quot;Time Squared&quot; called for a full-scale shuttle that the crew could walk around and examine. That episode introduced the Type 15 shuttlepod, a tiny craft only 3.6 meters long. Modified versions of the shuttlepod appeared in subsequent episodes like &quot;The Most Toys&quot;.

One of the shuttles was named Einstein.

During the 1991–92 season the full-scale shuttlecraft mockup built for &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot; became available. It was modified with larger windows and nacelles to reflect the Next Generation&#x27;s technology. This Type 6 shuttle first appeared in &quot;Darmok&quot; and was seen in subsequent episodes like &quot;Relics&quot;. The Type 6 shuttle was 6.0 meters long. Follow-on series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; took place in the same 24th century time frame, sharing many costumes and props.

The &quot;Type-15 Shuttlepod&quot; was seen in &quot;Time Squared&quot;. A set for the runabout shuttle&#x27;s aft living quarters was built for &quot;Timescape&quot;, an episode in the sixth season of &quot;The Next Generation&quot; (running concurrently with &quot;DS9&quot;″s first season). The set was designed by Richard James, and was funded from &quot;The Next Generation&quot;″s budget, in order to take pressure off &quot;DS9&quot;″s finances. Unlike the cockpit construction, design and fabrication of the aft set had to be completed in nine days. This was the only appearance of the &quot;Danube&quot; class outside of &quot;DS9&quot;, and although the set was intended for use on &quot;DS9&quot;, it was never used again to depict a runabout&#x27;s interior.

A Ferengi shuttlecraft is featured in the Star Trek franchise since its introduction in &quot;The Price&quot;. It was also seen in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&#x27;s &quot;Little Green Men&quot; as spacecraft of the Ferengi character Quark. The studio model for VFX was auctioned by Christie&#x27;s for over 8000 USD in 2006.

== &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; ==

Since the space station of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; rarely moved, some sort of auxiliary craft was necessary. The first episode introduced the runabouts. Equipped with warp drive and transporter for long missions, the runabout was described as a small starship. With its boxlike shape, chisel nose and ski-like nacelles the runabout looked like a descendant of previous shuttles. The design was initially inspired by the spacedock ferry in &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;. A runabout also appeared in the Next Generation episode &quot;Timescape&quot;.

In &quot;The Search&quot;, the first episode of the third season, the starship USS &quot;Defiant&quot; was introduced. &quot;Defiant&quot; took over some of the defense and exploration roles previously filled by runabouts. The new starship needed her own shuttles, and a small &quot;Type 18 shuttlepod&quot; was seen in the episode. Another Type 10 shuttle design was seen aboard &quot;Defiant&quot; in later episodes. The new Defiant shuttlecraft was introduced towards the end of Season 6, in &quot;The Sound of Her Voice&quot; (June 10, 1998 / S6E25)

This episode &quot;Change of Heart&quot; includes a sequence that depicts a runabout shuttle traversing an asteroid field, then landing on a planet. This was the first episode in which runabout sequences were done completely with computer-generated imagery: complex scenes where the ship weaved through the dense asteroid field were achieved without weeks of miniature effect work, and camera movements during the landing sequence allowed the runabout to be shown from multiple angles in the same scene, as there was no need to conceal a &#x27;mounting point&#x27; for the miniature. The CGI model for this for the Danube class shuttle (The Runabout) was developed by Digital Muse.

== &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; ==
Though the starship USS &quot;Voyager&quot; was capable of landing on planets, shuttlecraft were frequently needed. Possibly because of budgets, &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; began her journey using the Type 6 shuttle first seen in &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot; and adapted for &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. During the show&#x27;s seven seasons, computer graphics became available, which decreased the expense of bringing spaceship designs to the screen. A sleek Class 2 shuttle was first seen in &quot;Threshold&quot;.

During &quot;Voyager&#x27;s&quot; journey to Earth, a large number of shuttles were lost, eventually requiring a new spacecraft. The &quot;Delta Flyer&quot; was introduced in the episode &quot;Extreme Risk&quot;. Equipped with warp drive and technological enhancements gleaned from the Borg, the &quot;Delta Flyer&quot; was far more capable than the standard shuttles it replaced. Like the aquashuttle in &quot;The Animated Series&quot;, the &quot;Delta Flyer&quot; could submerge and travel in water.

The &quot;Delta Flyer&quot; would be an important shuttlecraft in many episodes, and operated from the USS &quot;Voyager&quot;. The design of the fictional spacecraft by the production staff and how it was presented in special effects has been written about in books about the franchise. The Delta Flyer was designed by illustrator Rich Sternbach, and exterior views were rendered by computer graphics by Foundation Imaging. The design was developed by 1998 by writers, illustrator, and CGI artists for the show.

One of &quot;Voyager&quot;″s shuttles, the &quot;Aeroshuttle&quot;, was integrated with the hull in the saucer section and although it was never used in an episode, the production team did develop special effects test footage of it disembarking. Voyager&#x27;s &quot;Aeroshuttle&quot; was intended as a warp-capable vessel that could also fly in atmospheres; the footage was made by CGI team leaders Rob Bonchune and Adam Lebowitz, along with the VFX Producer Dan Curry. Two other craft, the &quot;Manta&quot; and &quot;Cochrane&quot; were also developed but the Manta was not used. As referred in the website below,
The Cochrane was used in &quot;Threshold&quot; for the purpose of breaching the transwarp barrier, which is by analogy to hitting Mach One.

== &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; ==
During the earlier time period of &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, the transporter is a relatively new innovation. The first episode introduced a winged shuttlepod, two of which were carried aboard ship. Though the shuttlepods were represented in space via computer graphics, a full-scale mockup was built for scenes with actors. As the crew of &quot;Enterprise&quot; were still getting accustomed to the transporter, shuttlepods were used throughout all four seasons.

&quot;Enterprise&quot; also featured inspection pods in a small number of episodes. These pods lacked the ability to land but had better visibility than any other craft. This made them well suited to examining the exterior of starships.

One episode of the series &quot;Shuttlepod One&quot; takes place mostly aboard a shuttlecraft; actor Dominic Keating, who played Lieutenant Malcolm Reed in the episode, said he thought it was one of the &quot;finest hours&quot; of the show in a 2015 interview with SyFy, and it was also highly rated by &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;. The shuttlecraft plays into a plot element, as its air supply is running out, which creates an atmosphere of tension and desperation as the characters try to find a solution.

== Real space shuttles ==
In part because of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, the term &quot;space shuttle&quot; has permanently entered Earth&#x27;s vocabulary as a vehicle for traveling between a planetary surface and space. Wernher von Braun in the 1950s conceived of a reusable winged spacecraft as a ferry rocket. Plans for such vehicles were referred to as &quot;DC-3&quot; by spacecraft designer Maxime Faget and Integrated Launch and Reentry Vehicle (ILRV) by NASA. During the late 1960s, while &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; was being broadcast, these concepts became known as Space Shuttle. In a speech given to the British Interplanetary Society in August 1968 George Mueller, head of the NASA Office of Manned Space Flight, mentioned the need for a Space Shuttle. This was the earliest known official use of the term.

Aerospace Engineer Maxwell Hunter and others had been using the term &quot;shuttlecraft&quot; for several years, corresponding to the broadcast dates of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. By 1969, the term &quot;Space Shuttle&quot; had replaced ILRV. In April 1969, a Space Shuttle Task Group was formed within NASA. &quot;Star Trek&quot;″s penultimate episode, the last in a regular time slot, had aired on March 14, 1969. On January 5, 1972, President Richard Nixon formally announced development of the Space Shuttle, making the name permanent.

In February 1977, the OV-101 test vehicle began glide tests. OV-101 was christened space shuttle &quot;Enterprise&quot; after a concerted letter-writing campaign by &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans. Like the shuttlecraft of &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;, the Space Shuttle orbiters were used interchangeably to carry crew, cargo or exploration payloads. In orbital missions from 1981 to 2011, the Space Shuttle became symbolic of humanity&#x27;s reach into Space.

<text>Panajachel (, Pana) is a town in the southwestern Guatemalan Highlands, less than from Guatemala City, in the department of Sololá. It serves as the administrative centre for the surrounding municipality of the same name. The elevation is . Population was 11 thousand in the 2000 census, projected as 15,830 by June 30, 2020 and has approximately doubled each of the last few decades. The town of Panajachel is located on the Northeast shore of Lake Atitlán, and has become a centre for the tourist trade of the area as it provides a base for visitors crossing the lake to visit other towns and villages.

&quot;Panajachel&quot; derives from the Kaqchikel language and roughly translates to &quot;place of the Matasanos,&quot; the white sapote fruit tree.

==History==
===Spanish colony===

In the 16th century, during the period of the Spanish conquest of Guatemala, the shore of the lake was the scene of a battle in which the Spanish and their Kaqchikel allies defeated the Tz&#x27;utujils. After the Spanish conquest of Guatemala, the Franciscans set up a church and monastery in Panajachel soon afterward, and used the town as a centre to convert the indigenous people of the region to the Roman Catholic faith. The original façade of the church still stands and is considered one of the gems of the colonial style in Guatemala.

Panajachel was part of the Tecpán Atitlán &quot;corregimiento&quot; (English: Province) and when it turned into a major municipality in 1730, Panajachel became part of it as well; regarding the Catholic faith, this was in charge of the franciscans, who had convents and doctrines in the area covered by the modern departments of Sacatepéquez, Chimaltenango, Sololá, Quetzaltenango, Totonicapán, Suchitepéquez and Escuintla. The &quot;Provincia del Santísimo Nombre de Jesús&quot; (English:&quot;Province of the most Holy Name of Jesus&quot;), as the Franciscan area was then called, reached up to 24 convents. By 1700, Panajachel had a convent with three priests, in charge of ca. 1800 people, four doctrines and twelve cofradías.

Given that Panajachel had a convent, there was daily Mass attended by cofradías leaders and their wives, who kept lighted candles during most of the ceremony. Also daily, there was religious teaching for 6-year-old girls and older starting at 2:00 pm and for boys of the same age starting at sunset; the class lasted for 2 hours and consisted on memorizing the church teaching and prayers and to make some exercises with the catechism and it was run by a priest or by elder natives, called &quot;fiscales&quot;. Adults attended Mass every Sunday and holiday and after mass, there were religious teachings in their own language.

Lent was a time of the year when the friars prepared the natives thoroughly, using their own language to accomplish their goals; every Friday of Lent there was a procession following the Rosary steps all the way to the Calvary temple.

In 1754, as part of the borbon reforms, the Franciscans were forced to give their doctrines to the secular clergy; thus, when archbishop Pedro Cortés y Larraz visited Panajachel in 1770, he described it as the &quot;San Francisco Panajachel parish&quot;.

===Visit of archeologist Alfred P. Maudslay in 1892===

In 1892, British archeologist Alfred Percival Maudslay and his wife, Anne Maudslay, visited Panajachel during their long journey throughout Guatemala; their impressions were reported in their book &quot;A glimpse at Guatemala&quot;, published in 1899. They arrived to the town after spending a night in San Antonio Palopó and a short trip of 12 km; Anne Maudslay described Panajachel location as this: &quot;a little town standing on a rich alluvial plain formed by a swift stream which issues from a narrow cleft in the hills, and has spread out the earth in the shape of an open fan until it forms a mile of frontage to the Lake Atitlan.&quot;

By 1892, Panajachel people had already built numerous irrigation canals which had altered the normal stream bed to work on orchards, gardens and coffee plantations at the delta area. Nevertheless, the channels were insufficient to protect the town infrastructure against flooding, which occurred once in a while; in fact, several years prior to the visit of the Maudslays, there had been a large flood that destroyed several houses and left the town isolated. The town itself was not that interesting to the visitors, but their surroundings were marvelous: the volcanos, mountains and Lake Atitlan, whose green forests contrasted with the bare hills that surrounded Panajachel. Life in town seemed monotonous to Anne Maudslay, especially that of women who seemed to have the same day every day, grinding corn to make tortillas and leaning over the stream shore to wash their family clothes. Only those women that sold their produce in the central plaza market in the morning had a slightly different routine.

While in Panajachel, the visitors witnessed a religious ceremony by numerous pilgrims that were returning from visiting Esquipulas; pilgrims gathered in the central plaza that night around fires that they set for their food, and once they were done with their supper, they placed petates -native Guatemalan mats- on the floor in a line that crossed the plaza. Each one of them grabbed a small wooden box where they produced a small Catholic saint sculpture, leaving that of the Esquipulas Black Christ, in the center. Once the preparations were ready, they began the ritual by cradling from one mat to the next, always on their knees and pressing their forehead against the floor in front of each saint; every man did this for several times and in the end, they all gathered around the Black Christ and sang a hymn for about thirty minutes; once done, gathered their belongings and went to sleep on the plaza floor. Anne Maudslay tells in her book that even though this seemed like a Catholic ritual, it was, in fact, a Mayan one; several priests that they found during their journey told them that they were not sure that the natives had really absorbed the Catholic faith that the conquistadors tried to instill in them for centuries.

===20th century===

The town attracted many Hippies in the 1960s, but the numbers of foreign visitors plummeted during the Guatemalan Civil War. After the war ended, tourists started coming back, and Panajachel&#x27;s economy is once again primarily based on tourism.

===21st century: Hurricane Stan===
Panajachel was seriously affected by torrential rains as a result of Hurricane Stan in October 2005 with a major mudslide destroying about 100 homes along the river.

==Places of interest==

Casa Cakchiquel built in 1948, was one of the first hotels on the lake and according to legend, Ernesto &quot;Che&quot; Guevara, Ingrid Bergman, and other intellectuals, artists, painters and writers enjoyed the house at its best.

<text>A short-range ballistic missile (SRBM) is a ballistic missile with a range of to . In past and potential regional conflicts, these missiles have been and would be used because of the short distances between some countries and their relative low cost and ease of configuration. In modern terminology, SRBMs are part of the wider grouping of theatre ballistic missiles, which includes any ballistic missile with a range of less than 3,500 km.

<doc id="1320093" wikidata="Q419796" url="?curid=1320093" title="Accommodation (religion)">
<text>(Divine) Accommodation (or condescension) is the theological principle that God, while being in his nature unknowable and unreachable, has nevertheless communicated with humanity in a way that humans can understand and to which they can respond, pre-eminently by the incarnation of Christ and similarly, for example, in the Bible.

Benin describes accommodation as the view that &#x27;divine revelation is adjusted to the disparate intellectual and spiritual level of humanity at different times in history&#x27; including language, culture, individual capacity, and human sinfulness. 

Another usage uses &#x27;accommodation&#x27; as the appropriation of words or sentences from, especially, the Bible to signify ideas different from those that were originally expressed in the text.

== History ==
The history of the concept of accommodation reaches back to ancient Jewish biblical interpretation. It was taken up and developed by Christian theologians like Origen and Augustine, which ensured its continuance into the work of medieval and Reformation biblical exegetes. 

The sixteenth-century Protestant Reformer John Calvin is a notable developer of the concept, though contemporaries from Martin Luther to Ulrich Zwingli, Peter Martyr Vermigli and numerous others used it.

Accommodation also may involve an &quot;economy&quot; of revelation, of &quot;reserve&quot; (or of &quot;Disciplina Arcani&quot;, a modern term for the supposed early Catholic habit of reserving esoteric truths).

==Christian accommodation==
The belief that God has been able to sufficiently accommodate and communicate to humanity, despite the failings and limitations of the latter, is given its supreme form in the person and work of Jesus Christ. 

Traditional Christianity, as expressed in the historic creeds, proclaims the Trinity as being part of the orthodox Christian faith. The divinity of Christ, who is believed to be fully man and yet fully God, shows how the Godhead has accommodated itself to human minds and experience.

Erasmus of Rotterdam also employed accommodation as an ethical challenge, teaching that St Paul was a chameleon and Christ was a Proteus in their personal interactions; so Christians should also be &quot;all things to all men&quot; by accommodating each other, just as Christ had accommodated us.

==Biblical accommodation==

=== Language ===
Human language introduces a further complication into the notion of Biblical accommodation. Church tradition (including more recent statements of faith like the Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy and the Cambridge Declaration) holds to the belief that only the original Hebrew Old Testament text and the original Greek New Testament text can be clearly identified as God&#x27;s word. Therefore, any human translation of the original language will automatically not be considered God&#x27;s inspired word – which naturally includes the 5th century Latin Vulgate, as well as today&#x27;s more contemporary translations.

Yet accommodation allows for the belief that despite this natural linguistic barrier, God still has the power to use such translations in order to reveal his nature to people. This implies that Christians do not have to learn Ancient Hebrew and Greek in order to hear what God has to say.

Traditional Christian theology asserts that it is through the work of the Holy Spirit within the individual that God the Father is able to communicate to them via the words of the Bible.

=== Theological approaches to Biblical accommodation ===
Biblical accommodation refers to a number of distinct views in Biblical exegesis, or the interpretation of the Bible. Such views broadly concern the question of whether, or to what extent, the Bible may be said to be literally true. One view, associated with John Calvin, holds that while some of the expressions and metaphors used in the Bible may be literally false, they are nonetheless essentially true. Another view, associated with Faustus Socinus, holds that some Biblical language is both literally and essentially false.

In his discussion of accommodation, Thomas Hartwell Horne, the English theologian, distinguishes between the &#x27;form&#x27; and &#x27;essence&#x27; of revelation. The former refers to the manner in which the Biblical text expresses its content; the latter, to the content which is expressed through the Biblical text. 

Thus, there are two possible kinds of Biblical accommodation: one which holds that merely the &quot;expressive form&quot; of the Bible is modified to accord with human capacities; and a stronger version, which holds that the &quot;content&quot; of the Bible is modified to conform with human perceptions of divine reality, to the extent that it may be literally false.

Lee, a contemporary scholar, adopts a similar distinction. He associates John Calvin with the &#x27;formal&#x27; view, and Faustus Socinus with the &#x27;essential&#x27; view. According to Lee, Calvin held that, although a number of the descriptions of events (in particular, those in the Genesis creation narrative) could not be literally true according to current scientific theories, they were nonetheless essentially true and had simply been accommodated to human perceptual capacities. By contrast, Socinus held that some &#x27;accommodated&#x27; Biblical teachings in the Bible were literally false.

===Textual accommodation===
Another usage, by Catholics, is that &#x27;accommodation&#x27; is the appropriation of words or sentences from the Bible to signify ideas different from those that were originally expressed in the text or in the mind of their originator. For example, where some biblical phrase is re-purposed as part of a liturgy or theological work. Some scholars class quotes in the Gospels that some Old Testament prophesy was fulfilled as accommodation. Accommodation was used by the Fathers of the Church and many of the sermons of St. Bernard are mosaics of scripture phrases. 

Typical rules for guidance in the accommodation of scripture are:

* Accommodated texts should never be used as arguments drawn from revelation.
* Accommodation should not be farfetched.
* Accommodations should be reverent

German eighteenth-century rationalism held that the Biblical writers made great use of conscious accommodation, intending moral commonplaces when they seemed to be enunciating Christian dogmas.

==The sacraments as accommodation==
In most Protestant churches, only two sacraments are recognised, Baptism and The Lord&#x27;s Supper. Both have a special significance in that they were symbolic representations instituted by Jesus. In these sacraments, God is held by Christians to accommodate himself and his gospel in the sacramental actions to sinful and limited human beings.

==Calvinist==
There has been scholarly debate about John Calvin&#x27;s use of the concept of accommodation which continues to the present day. Scholars like E. David Willis and Ford Lewis Battles, and more recently Arnold Huijgen, have argued that Calvin developed the idea from sources related to classical rhetoric while others such as David F. Wright and Jon Balserak have argued that Calvin&#x27;s usage of the idea of divine accommodation is too diffuse to fit into any concept (such as decorum) associated with rhetoric. None of these scholars are disputing Calvin&#x27;s credentials as a Renaissance humanist but rather whether they explain his appreciation and use of divine accommodation. Both groups acknowledge Calvin&#x27;s indebtedness to the Church Fathers from whom he appropriated the motif, or cluster of motifs, of divine accommodation.

===Preaching of the Gospel===
Gospel preaching is one of the most important facets of the Calvinistic principle of accommodation, for in it humankind is held to experience God&#x27;s redemptive power through the work of the Spirit. Through this monergistic activity, God is believed to effectively cause people to come to faith.

<text>Trudie Styler (born 6 January 1954) is an English actress, director, and film producer.

==Early life and family==
Styler was born in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, the daughter of Pauline and Harry Styler, a farmer and factory worker. When Styler was two years old, she was hit by a van. She received severe facial injuries that left her badly scarred and required several plastic surgery operations up until the age of 18. Her classmates nicknamed her &quot;scarface&quot;, which caused her to feel for many years that she was &quot;not a very attractive person&quot;. She attended North Bromsgrove High School, where one of her teachers was the singer-songwriter Clifford T. Ward.

==Acting career==
Styler trained at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School and went on to appear in various period BBC productions. She joined the Royal Shakespeare Company, in which she played multiple major roles. Her theatre credits also include &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;, &quot;Twin Spirits&quot;, and &quot;The Seagull&quot;.

She has appeared in many British television series such as &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; and &quot;The Scold&#x27;s Bridle&quot;, and in the United States television shows &quot;Empire&quot;, &quot;The Night Of&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot; (S8 Ep10), and &quot;Falling Water&quot;.

Styler&#x27;s film work includes Lifetime Television&#x27;s &quot;Living Proof&quot; and Paul Haggis&#x27; &quot;The Next Three Days&quot;. She has also made seven mind-body fitness DVDs released by Gaia, Inc.

==Film production==
In the mid-1990s, Styler established Xingu Films, a production company dedicated to supporting new talent, such as Guy Ritchie, Dito Montiel and Duncan Jones. In late July 2008 it was announced that Xingu had optioned &quot;American Reaper&quot;, an upcoming graphic novel written by Pat Mills, who would also write the screenplay.

Styler has produced and co-directed several award-winning documentaries and feature films, including Guy Ritchie&#x27;s &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot; and &quot;Snatch&quot;; Duncan Jones&#x27; &quot;Moon&quot;; and Michael Apted&#x27;s &quot;Moving the Mountain&quot;, which won the 1994 International Independent Documentary Award.

After moving to New York, Styler co-founded the production company Maven Pictures with Celine Rattray in 2011. Their first feature, &quot;Girl Most Likely&quot;, starred Kristen Wiig; closely followed by &quot;Filth&quot;, starring James McAvoy; &quot;Black Nativity&quot; starring Forest Whitaker; &quot;Ten Thousand Saints&quot; starring Ethan Hawke; and &quot;American Honey&quot; starring Shia LaBeouf, which won Jury Prize (Cannes Film Festival) at the Cannes Film Festival in 2016. Styler&#x27;s 2017 directorial debut, &quot;Freak Show&quot;, is based on the New York Times bestseller by James St. James, and stars AnnaSophia Robb, Alex Lawther, and Bette Midler. &quot;Freak Show&quot; debuted at the 2017 Berlin International Film Festival.

==Philanthropy==
In 1989, Styler and her husband, Sting, cofounded the Rainforest Foundation Fund, an organisation devoted to protecting rainforests and their indigenous peoples. Since 1991, she has produced regular Rock for the Rainforest benefits at Carnegie Hall. As a UNICEF Ambassador, Styler has also raised millions for their projects around the globe.

In 2008, it was reported that Styler donated £10,000 into the charitable Ama Sumani cancer fund. Sumani was terminally ill with cancer and unable to afford treatment in her native Ghana, but had been deported from a Cardiff hospital after the expiry of her visa. Sumani died on 19 March 2008.

Styler is also a patron of the Elton John AIDS Foundation.

==Personal life==
Styler married rock musician Sting at Camden Register Office on 20 August 1992, and the couple had their wedding blessed two days later in the twelfth-century parish church of St Andrew in Great Durnford, Wiltshire, south-west England. In 1982, Sting separated from his first wife, actress Frances Tomelty, following an affair with Styler; Tomelty and Sting divorced in 1984. The split was controversial; as &quot;The Independent&quot; reported in 2006, Tomelty &quot;just happened to be Trudie&#x27;s best friend (Sting and Frances lived next door to Trudie in Bayswater, west London, for several years before the two of them became lovers)&quot;.

Sting and Styler have four children, three of whom were born before they married: Brigitte Michael (&quot;Mickey&quot;, born 19 January 1984), Jake (24 May 1985), Eliot Paulina (nicknamed &quot;Coco&quot;, 30 July 1990), and Giacomo Luke (17 December 1995). Coco is a singer who now goes by the name Eliot Sumner, and was the founder and lead singer of the group I Blame Coco. Giacomo Luke is the inspiration behind the name of Kentucky Derby-winning horse Giacomo.
She is also step-mother of two kids, daughter Fuschia and son Joe, whom Sting shares with his ex-wife Frances Tomelty.

<doc id="1320118" wikidata="Q4787113" url="?curid=1320118" title="Architecture of Btrieve">
<text>Btrieve is a database developed by Pervasive Software. The architecture of Btrieve has been designed with record management in mind. This means that Btrieve only deals with the underlying record creation, data retrieval, record updating and data deletion primitives. Together with the MicroKernel Database Engine it uses ISAM, Indexed Sequential Access Method, as its underlying storage mechanism.

Btrieve is essentially a database that uses keys and indexes to organise data. However, the file structure itself is largely built around smaller units of data, called &quot;pages&quot; in Btrieve. Though the structure has changed over the various versions of Btrieve, the file structure still revolves around a File Control Record (FCR) — which defines the configuration of pages — and pages in the Btrieve file that contain data. Historically, Btrieve used &quot;physical pages&quot;, or pages that were located at fixed positions in the file. Beginning with version 6.0 &quot;logical pages&quot; started to be used, which were mapped to page allocation tables (PATs) — this allowed Btrieve to change their record update technique from what was later known as &quot;pre-image paging&quot; to a technique called &quot;shadow-paging&quot;.

Btrieve is committed to backward compatibility, as versions of Btrieve until version 6.15 use a standard file format and, until Btrieve 6.0 was released, were completely backwards compatible. Btrieve 6.0 introduced new features and had to break compatibility with older versions of the software to implement more advanced features. The API likewise remained backwards compatible, with only one feature (split files to separate media) being dropped. At one point, Btrieve&#x27;s former CEO Ron Harris stated that &quot;The version 1.0 API is still supported in version 6.15, and we&#x27;re going to keep it forever!&quot;.

==Database terminology==
Pervasive initially used the term &quot;navigational database&quot; to describe Btrieve, but later changed this to &quot;transactional database&quot;. The use of the term navigational database was unusual because a navigational database uses &quot;pointers&quot; and &quot;paths&quot; to navigate among data records, and these pointers are contained in the record itself; ISAM, which is the fundamental structure of Btrieve, uses a secondary index table to store these pointers to decrease search times. Thus, the two types of database are different, and may or may not explain why Pervasive started using different terminology for classifying their database.

==Micro-Kernel Database Engine==

Starting with version 6.15, Pervasive started using a new modular method of separating the database backend from the interface that developers used. They separated the core database operations (like update, write and delete records) from the Btrieve and Scalable SQL modules. By separating the Micro-Kernel Database Engine (MKDE) from the other functions it allowed programmers to use several methods of accessing the database simultaneously. For instance, an application may be created using the Btrieve API and another application that needs to access the same data may use a totally different method, like using Scalable SQL. Because the record primitives have been separated from these methods, both applications can use the MKDE to access the same data file.

The Micro-Kernel Database Engine is unrelated to microkernel operating system kernels.

==Paging==
The Btrieve file format consists entirely of pages, which is the data that moves between memory and storage media when the engine performs an I/O operation. Versions prior to 6.0 merely used data pages, index pages and a &quot;file control record&quot; (FCR). The file had an index for searching that linked to physical pages. Beginning with version 6.0 &quot;logical pages&quot; started to be used, which are pages that are mapped to &quot;physical pages&quot; (pages at a fixed location in the file) on the disk through the use of a set of &quot;page allocation tables&quot; (PATs).

===File control record===
The file control record (FCR) contains important information about Btrieve database files. It holds the page size, the number of pages in current use, the number of keys that can index the file, the number of records in the file and other details. After version 6.0 two FCRs were used for redundancy. A 32-bit usage count field that exists in each FCR is used to determine which FCR was valid to use. Each time an operation is done on a file the field is incremented. The FCR with the highest usage count becomes the valid FCR. 
The FCR is well described at source samples from Jim Kyle. 
With the introduction of MKDE version 8, the structure of the FCR page is changed. The page size is now moved within the FCR and is not a regular 32-bit field. Since version 8 you have to calculate the page size by taking the 32-bit field at offset 0x2A and multiply with 256.

===Page allocation tables===
A &quot;page allocation table&quot; (PAT) maps the logical pages to the physical pages. Each PAT is just a physical page located at well-defined locations. Like the FCRs, PATs always occur in pairs, with the currently valid copy indicated by having a higher usage count. The first pair of PATs immediately follow the first two FCRs and takes up physical pages 2 and 3. A variable number of other pages follow, and a new pair of PATs in turn follow this. Each PAT has a fixed number of pointers to logical pages, with each entry that is empty having a value of zero.

The amount of logical records that can be stored in the PAT is determined by its page size. Each page pointer in versions 6.x and 7.x of the MKDE takes up 4 bytes of space, and the PAT header takes up 8 bytes, so the amount of logical pages in the PAT becomes:

:&quot;Number of logical pages&quot; = (&quot;Page size&quot; ÷ 4) - 8

With the introduction of MKDE version 8, the size of the page header changed and so this formula no longer applies but the principle remains the same.

===Pre-image paging vs Shadow paging===
Until version 6.0, &quot;pre-image paging&quot; was used when performing updates to records. It involved the creation of a new &quot;pre-image file&quot; before the changes were made, and then the pages from the original data file were copied into this new pre-image file temporarily. Then the system would make the changes to the original file. Should the update be interrupted and only half the data written to the page, then the page would just be rolled back by the engine by copying the page from the pre-image file back into the corrupted page in the original database file, then the temporary pre-image file would be deleted. The preimage files were given the extension .PRE, so finding these files in the system usually indicated that a transaction had not happened correctly and recovery had not been successful.

Starting in version 6.0, &quot;shadow paging&quot; was used instead of pre-imaging, and it is still used to this day. Instead of copying the page into a temporary file, the next spare physical location in the database file was found and the page was written to this location. This page is called a &quot;shadow page&quot; because it still has not had its location written to the file&#x27;s PAT. Once the update to the shadow page completed, the PAT was updated and the entry recorded in the PAT of the next available and current physical page in the file. However, if a system failure occurred while doing the update to the shadow page the PAT would not be updated and so the change would be dropped because the current and next entry was not updated in the PAT.

The change-over from pre-image paging to shadow-paging caused radical file format changes that broke compatibility between previous versions of Btrieve and version 6.x of the product.

===Alternate Collating Sequence pages===
&quot;Alternate Collating Sequence&quot; (ACS) pages are pages that allow records to be sorted in a different order. Collation is the assembly of written information into a standard order. In common usage, this is called alphabetisation, though collation is not limited to ordering letters of the alphabet. For instance, an ACS might allow the sort order to sort in both case-sensitive and case-insensitive order. Prior to version 6.0 only one ACS was able to be stored in the file, however after 6.0 was released more than one ACS page could be associated with a file at any one time.

===Extra pages===
In version 6.0 and later files, more physical pages can exist than are actually used. This is because with shadow paging some pages in the system may not have an entry in the PAT. These pages are marked as &quot;Extra&quot; pages, and are used up before space for new pages is allocated.

===Variable-tail allocation tables===
In Btrieve, each page is fixed but a record can be larger than the page size. This means that records often need to be fragmented and spread over many different pages. With very large records this can mean that many hundreds of pages may need to be used in order to store the record. A linked list approach would be able to allow for this fragmentation, but the Btrieve engine would have a hard time reading through sequential records. Therefore, starting with version 6.1, a table is used in the file that stores pointers to each of the pages that make up the data record. This table is called a &quot;variable-tail allocation table&quot; (VAT).

==Indexing==

Btrieve uses a b-tree format to store record indexes on particular table columns. The index maps each set of indexed column values to the set of unique identifiers for the rows that have those column values, which provides a quick way to find the rows within a table using the indexed column. B-trees are tree data structures and are very efficient as a mechanism for fast data retrieval. The drawback of a btree is that data must be constantly balanced when it is inserted into the tree, therefore Btrieve only stores the record index as btree to reduce the amount of time it takes to insert and update records. A separate b-tree is kept for each index in the system, and the root node information is kept in the FCR. In Btrieve 6.x a new index can be created at file creation time, or added and dropped after the file is created. Index pages are also created as they are needed. Before Btrieve 6.0 existing key indexes could not be removed, though supplemental indexes could be created and dropped as needed.

Btrieve allows for duplicate key values in an index. Btrieve handles duplicate keys using either a &quot;linked duplicate&quot; method, or by using a &quot;repeating duplicate&quot; method (this terminology started being used when version 6.0 was released). The linked duplicate method used a pair of record pointers in the index page itself to point to the head and tail of a doubly linked list of duplicate keys. This meant that the order of the duplicate keys in the list was in the order they were entered. The duplicate key method did not use a linked list, but rather made all the keys unique by creating a new index key and appending the address of the record pointer to the end of the key. This means that the key is retrieved via its position order.

==File sharing==
When Btrieve needed to do file sharing to gain access to records, two different types of file sharing modes could be used: &quot;Single Engine File Sharing&quot; (SEFS) mode, and &quot;Multi Engine File Sharing&quot; (MEFS) mode. SEFS only allowed the clients that accessed that engine to alter the database, other clients that accessed a different engine could not gain access to the database. MEFS allows different clients running under different engines to access the database.

==Concurrency==
Btrieve was able to handle concurrent transactions in the 6.x series. Before Btrieve 6.0 the engine could only do file level locking or &quot;exclusive&quot; locking; from 6.0 onward, records could be locked individually. Locking at the record (or page) level was known as &quot;concurrent&quot; locking. The advantages were obvious: more than one client could access the file at the same time, so long as they weren&#x27;t trying to access the same record, leading to performance increases. Additionally, other clients could read the locked pages, and would not see any changes to a file involved in a write transaction by another process that had locked the record.

MEFS mode did not completely support concurrent locking. If a client started a concurrent transaction and then tried to perform a write operation to a record, the Btrieve engine would return a status code 85 that indicated that the file was locked — even though a concurrent lock was being used.

==System and user transactions==
Starting with version 6.15 of Btrieve, a new type of database transaction was introduced called a &quot;system transaction&quot;, which was separated from &quot;user transactions&quot;. User transactions are exclusive and concurrent transactions while system transactions are a bundle of non-transactional operations and/or user transactions. System transactions were exclusively used for data-recovery by the MKDE. If a system failure causes data corruption then when the MKDE is restarted it detects all the files that had a failed system transaction and tried to recover them. However, as user transactions might have been lost when the last system transaction was rolled back an option could be set that caused the MKDE to force system transactions that had user transactions to complete when the engine received an &quot;End Operation&quot; request.

<doc id="1320131" wikidata="Q1147514" url="?curid=1320131" title="Fort Mandan">
<text>Fort Mandan was the name of the encampment which the Lewis and Clark Expedition built for wintering over in 1804–1805. The encampment was located on the Missouri River approximately from the site of present-day Washburn, North Dakota, which developed later. The precise location is not known for certain. It is believed now to be under the water of the river. A replica of the fort has been constructed near the original site.

==Construction and conditions==

The fort was built of cottonwood lumber cut from the riverbanks. It was triangular in shape, with high walls on all sides, an interior open space between structures, and a gate facing the Missouri River, by which the party would normally travel. Storage rooms provided a safe place to keep supplies. Lewis and Clark shared a room. The men of the Corps of Discovery started the fort on November 2, 1804. Fort Mandan was completed on November 27, 1804. They wintered there until April 6, 1805. According to the journals, they built the fort slightly downriver from the five villages of the Mandan and Hidatsa nations.

The winter was very cold, with temperatures sometimes dipping to , but the fort provided some protection from the elements. Several of the men of the expedition suffered frostbite due to the severely cold conditions, which set in after only brief exposure.

==Diplomacy==
In addition to seeking protection during the winter, Captains Meriwether Lewis and William Clark spent much of this period on diplomatic efforts with the several Native American tribes who lived near the fort.

As the expedition was to establish the first official contact between the United States and numerous nations across the territory, President Thomas Jefferson had directed the captains to pursue diplomatic goals. They were to try to establish friendly relations with as many tribes as possible, and to prepare them for the arrival of United States traders to the region. They were also to claim United States territorial sovereignty over the land, which had been occupied by Native Americans for thousands of years. The historic tribes had differing conceptions of property use than did the European Americans.

The Teton people had already shown resistance to the expedition. Lewis and Clark gradually adjusted their goals, working to form alliances with the Arikara, Hidatsa, and Mandan against the Teton.

The Mandan were cautiously favorable toward such an alliance. When the Expedition returned to the area in 1806 while traveling east, the Mandan sent one of their chiefs, &quot;Sheheke,&quot; on the trip to Washington, D.C. to meet with Thomas Jefferson. But the Mandan did not commit to trading with the United States at the expense of their previous partnership with Great Britain through Canadian traders. The Hidatsa strongly resisted the American diplomatic efforts, often avoiding meeting with Lewis and Clark.

==Preparations for spring travel==
The Corps spent much time during the winter to prepare for their travel in the spring, repairing equipment, making clothing, processing dried meats, etc. In addition, on the way to their winter site, they had used maps made by previous explorers. From that point on in their westward journey, they would enter territory unfamiliar to Europeans according to known documentation. Clark noted that he gathered information from chief Sheheke about the route to the west in order to make a preliminary map.

Not knowing if they would survive the journey, Lewis and Clark used the winter to compile their descriptions of tributaries of the Missouri River, their observations about the Native nations encountered, and their descriptions of plant and mineral specimens which they had collected. All of this material was compiled into a manuscript which they called the &quot;Mandan Miscellany&quot;. In the spring the captains sent a copy of the manuscript to government officials in St. Louis via their large keelboat. The boat was planned to return before their expected arrival at the Mandan area in 1806.

==Sacagawea==
Lewis and Clark appear to have first met Sacagawea at Fort Mandan. Her husband Toussaint Charbonneau served as a Hidatsa interpreter for the expedition, and the journals imply that she lived at the fort with him. Their son Jean Baptiste Charbonneau, whom she kept with her throughout the expedition, was born on February 11, 1805, possibly at the fort.

==1806 and after==
When the Corps passed back through the area in August 1806 on their return journey to the East, they found the fort had burnt to the ground. The cause is unknown. Since that time, the Missouri River has slowly eroded the bank and shifted course to the east, eroding away the former site of the fort.

The Lewis and Clark Fort Mandan Foundation built a replica of the fort along the river, from the intersection of ND 200A and US 83. Made according to materials and design as described in the expedition&#x27;s journals, it is located near the North Dakota Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center. The fort replica holds reproduction items, such as &quot;Meriwether Lewis&#x27; field desk, William Clark&#x27;s map-making tools, bunks the men slept in, equipment they carried in the field, clothes they wore, and the blacksmith&#x27;s forge.&quot;

In addition, the site has staff to give tours and interpretive programs about the Lewis and Clark Expedition and its significance in United States, state and regional history. Walking trails go along the property and the river.

<text>George R. Evans (February 5, 1920 – June 22, 2001) was an American cartoonist and illustrator who worked in both comic books and comic strips. His lifelong fascination with airplanes and the pioneers of early aviation was a constant theme in his art and stories.

==Early life==
Born in Harwood, Pennsylvania, Evans studied art from a correspondence course. He was still in his teens when he made his first sales, both illustrations and writing, to pulp magazines. Early in World War II, Evans was an aircraft mechanic at Shaw Field in South Carolina, where he sometimes flew in the planes he had worked on. He studied at the Scranton Art School and then entered the Army.

==Career==
===Comic books===
In the post-World War II years, Evans began working for comic books, including an in-house staff position at Fiction House until 1949. Originally hired to rule panel borders, erase pencils and fill in blacks for other illustrators, he sat next the teenaged artist Frank Frazetta. Evans eventually got up the nerve to show his portfolio to the editor where the surprised staffer exclaimed, &quot;What the hell are you doing this job for, when you can draw like this?&quot; After that, Evans was given feature stories to draw in 1947. Among the features he illustrated were &quot;The Lost World&quot; in Planet Comics&quot; and &quot;Tigerman&quot; in &quot;Rangers Comics&quot;. His favorite work from this period was for Fiction House&#x27;s &quot;Wings Comics&quot; and he did a few illustrations for the company&#x27;s pulp line as well. He picked up odd jobs while still attending art classes, including some farmed out to him by Better Publications&#x27; art editor Graham Ingels, who would later join Evans at Fiction House and at EC Comics. Evans&#x27; titles for Fawcett included the &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot; film adaptation and the &quot;Captain Video&quot; television adaptation, plus horror stories for &quot;Strange Suspense Stories&quot;, &quot;This Magazine Is Haunted,&quot; and &quot;Worlds of Fear&quot;. He contributed to the company&#x27;s westerns and romance titles as well. Until the end of his life, Evans believed his work for Fawcett was better than any other in his career. He liked the people there and assembled a team of inkers and assistants after becoming one of Fawcett&#x27;s top illustrators in 1950.

His work for EC Comics in the early 1950s included powerful covers and crime stories for &quot;Crime SuspenStories&quot; and memorable World War I aviation covers and stories for &quot;Aces High&quot;. He was a semi-regular contributor to &quot;The Haunt of Fear&quot;, &quot;Tales From the Crypt&quot;, &quot;Vault of Horror&quot;, &quot;Frontline Combat&quot;, &quot;Two-Fisted Tales&quot; and &quot;Shock SuspenStories&quot; (the latter of which also had three covers by Evans). Evans&#x27; shocking cover for &quot;Crime Suspenstories&quot; #23 was held up at the Senate Hearings On Juvenile Delinquency in 1954, among many other comic book covers from a variety of publishers. He stayed with EC through their new direction and Picto-Fiction experiments, contributing to &quot;M.D.&quot;, &quot;Impact&quot;, &quot;Piracy&quot;, &quot;Terror Illustrated&quot;, &quot;Crime Illustrated&quot; and &quot;Shock Illustrated&quot;, among others. After EC, he contributed to Gilberton&#x27;s &quot;Classics Illustrated&quot;, Dell and Gold Key. His books for &quot;Classics Illustrated&quot; included &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (No. 134, September 1956); &quot;Lord Jim&quot; (No. 136, January 1957); &quot;The Little Savage&quot; (No. 137, March 1957); &quot;In the Reign of Terror&quot; (No. 139, July 1957); &quot;The Crisis&quot; (No. 145, July 1958); &quot;The Buccaneer&quot; (No. 148, January 1959); &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (No. 1, revised, May 1959); &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (No. 18, revised, with Reed Crandall, Fall 1960); &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (No. 23, revised, with Reed Crandall, Fall 1961); &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (No. 68, revised, with Reed Crandall, 1962); and &quot;In Freedom&#x27;s Cause&quot; (No. 168, with Reed Crandall, 1962; published UK 1963; published US 1969).

===Comic strips===
For &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot; Evans drew &quot;Space Conquerors!&quot; for the August 1953-March 1958 issues. During the 1960s, he was an assistant and ghost artist for George Wunder on the comic strip &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot;. He did occasional work in comic books during this period, most notably for Warren&#x27;s &quot;Blazing Combat&quot; black and white magazine and &quot;Eerie&quot;, Gold Key&#x27;s &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; and &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot; During the 1970s, he contributed comics to the &quot;National Lampoon&quot;. He drew DC Comics&#x27; war comics and mystery tales, and for Marvel Comics he did mystery-horror stories plus work on two issues of &quot;Super-Villain Team-Up&quot; featuring Doctor Doom and Sub-Mariner. Al Williamson passed &quot;Secret Agent Corrigan&quot; on to Evans in 1980, and the strip ended with his 1996 retirement. For several years before that, the strip, as with all story strips, was becoming less popular. As the strip&#x27;s circulation dwindled, the syndicate was about to cancel it in 1991. Originally, Evans had been glad, and had taken on other work. Then Evans was lured back, because it turned out that the strip&#x27;s popularity in European markets justified keeping it going for five more years.

===Aviation art===

Evans&#x27; first love was World War I aviation, and he did many paintings of World War I dogfights, including a calendar for The Cross and Cockade Society. He also did book jacket art. For David Manning White&#x27;s Marlborough House, Evans created the cover illustration for &quot;The Black Swallow of Death: The Incredible Story of Eugene Jacques Bullard, The World&#x27;s First Black Combat Aviator&quot; by P.J. Carisella, James W. Ryan and Edward W. Brooke (1972). This illustration is on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force near Dayton, Ohio.

===Books and later career===
He illustrated a children&#x27;s book, &quot;The Story of Flight&quot;, for Random House. The last page, which shows a man flying with a rocket pack, shows the rear of the Evans family home with Evans working at his drawing board in an upstairs window. In 1975, the hardcover novel &quot;Far Lands, Other Days&quot; contained many Evans black-and-white illustrations and a painted cover. In the 1990s, Factoid Books (a DC offshoot) released its &quot;Big Book of...&quot; series in which Evans drew some of his last comics: one a biography of baseball great Ty Cobb, another the story of the first air mail flight; and in 1998, the life of Judge Roy Bean in &quot;The Big Book of the Weird, Wild West&quot;. Along with many other former EC artists and similar talents. he contributed many illustrations to at least nine of the 18 volumes of Art Linkletter&#x27;s &quot;Picture Encyclopedia for Boys and Girls&quot;. He was commissioned to do storyboards for the film &quot;Jaws 3-D&quot;.

George was also very active in the activities of the US Branch of the Western Front Association (WFA). This group focuses study and research on the 1914-1918 Western Front. Meetings are in the Baltimore - Philadelphia region. He religiously attended meetings, made presentations, and offered his expertise on all things aviation and art related. He once told WFA member Eric Miller that after he died he wanted his ashes brought to the WFA seminars. His passion burned brightly even as his mortal strength declined.

==Death==
Evans, who in 1982 was living in Levittown, New York, on Long Island, had moved to Mount Joy, Pennsylvania, before he died at age 81. His final work was the &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; Sunday page of 21 January 2001.

<text>Meridian Hill Park is an urban park in Washington, D.C., located in the Meridian Hill neighborhood that straddles the border between Adams Morgan and Columbia Heights, in Northwest D.C. The park was built between 1912-40 and covers . Meridian Hill Park is bordered by 15th, 16th, W, and Euclid streets NW, and sits on a prominent hill directly north of the White House. Since 1969, the name Malcolm X Park is used by some in honor of Malcolm X.

== History ==

At the time of Washington, D.C.&#x27;s creation in 1791, the land beneath present-day Meridian Hill Park was owned by Robert Peter, wealthy Georgetown merchant, and was known as Peter&#x27;s Hill. In 1804, president Thomas Jefferson had a geodetic marker placed on this large hill. Centered exactly north of the White House, this marker helped to establish a longitudinal meridian for the city and the nation: the &quot;White House meridian&quot;. After the War of 1812, David Porter, a commodore and naval hero of that war, acquired the hill in 1816 as part of a tract of land that he had purchased; he named this property &quot;Meridian Hill&quot;. On the brow of this prominent hill on his new estate, and close to the marker, Porter then built a large and famous mansion which he also named Meridian Hill. The home faced south with a dramatic view of the White House and the Potomac River. Meridian Hill Park today shares this view. Following his presidential term, John Quincy Adams briefly lived at Meridian Hill.

After the onset of the American Civil War, and with a strategic location overlooking the city, the Meridian Hill estate and mansion, along with the land of neighboring Columbian College (founded 1821, later moving and becoming George Washington University), were taken for use as an army encampment named Camp Cameron. At times, this location was referred to as being &quot;on Georgetown Heights&quot;.

Shortly after the war, a fire badly damaged the mansion, and the home ultimately was razed. At that time, Washington was experiencing postwar growth and some prosperity, so in 1867 the old Porter estate&#x27;s land was subdivided into smaller lots. In 1887, former senator John Brooks Henderson and his wife Mary Foote Henderson, a wealthy couple from Missouri, resettled in Washington and purchased a large number of these real estate lots. On the west side of newly extended 16th Street, the Hendersons then built an elaborate stone home, designed to resemble a castle, which became known as Henderson Castle.

Mary, with many friends in Congress, had grand plans for the area and for the public use of the hill. She put forward, without success, two ambitious proposals, one by architect Paul J. Pelz in 1898 and the second by Franklin W. Smith in 1900, both with designs to construct a colossal presidential mansion on Meridian Hill to replace the White House. She next unsuccessfully proposed that the site be used for the planned Lincoln Memorial.

===Early 20th century===

When these did not work out, Mary Henderson focused on a park. In addition, with her own money and with architect George Oakley Totten Jr., she planned and then built her own projects, which included creating a succession of large, elaborate embassies and mansions along both 15th and 16th streets. These formal, well-made structures today frame Meridian Hill Park and help to create a thematic visual appearance to the area immediately around the park.

In 1901, the Senate Park Commission (with its McMillan Plan) undertook a set of formal changes to Washington&#x27;s civic appearance, most famously by reconfiguring the city&#x27;s National Mall. The commission also decided, with Mary&#x27;s input, that a park on Meridian Hill was appropriate, and proceeded to plan for its creation. Mary, strong-willed, intelligent, vigorous and well-connected, very much championed the park. Later, throughout the many years of park construction, she lobbied Congress to maintain the flow of funding necessary to complete the project.

By an Act of Congress on June 25, 1910, Meridian Hill Park was established. The federal government also purchased the land for the park in 1910, and began planning for its construction in 1912, with the Interior Department hiring landscape architect George Burnap to design a grand urban park modeled on parks found in European capitals. His plans were approved in early 1914, and later were modified by Horace Peaslee, who took over as project architect; the design included an Italian Renaissance-style terraced fountain cascade with pools in the lower half, and gardens in a French Baroque style in the upper half. The upper portion later was simplified somewhat to focus on an open mall, suitable for gatherings and performances. The well-designed and carefully made walls, fountains, balustrades and benches were built with concrete aggregate, a then-new type of building material consisting of a specially washed and exposed-pebble surface set into the concrete substrate. This construction technique for the park was created by master craftsman John Joseph Earley; he and his team of skilled artisans worked for years on the project. After two decades under construction, the grounds were declared essentially complete, given park status, and then dedicated in 1936. Following its completion, the park became popular with city residents. Another interesting fact is the use of the park as a filming location for an OSS movie, where the &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; as well as the Dante statue can be seen.

===Late 20th century===

The upper mall area was often used for concerts and gatherings. At a political rally in 1969, activist Angela Davis proposed renaming the park Malcolm X Park, but ultimately this name change was not approved. Locals continued to call the park Malcolm X Park in honour of the assassinated civil rights minister. In 2023 after the lower plaza renovation (to make park wheelchair accessible) was complete and the lower plaza reopened, NPS for the first time acknowledged the park&#x27;s local name: Malcolm X Park. 

After 1970, with inner-city areas of Washington experiencing an economic decline, the park and its neighborhood suffered some decay for a number of years, with crime and vandalism becoming a problem. Upkeep of the park suffered, and the park became less safe, with drug dealing at times occurring. About 1990, in response to rising crime rates in and around the park, neighborhood residents became more involved in the park&#x27;s stewardship and programming, and a group of community organizations formed the Friends of Meridian Hill. This organization organized volunteer nighttime patrols to combat crime, planted trees, produced a wide range of community arts and educational programs in the park, including twilight concerts, and helped the National Park Service to make improvements to the park.

===Contemporary===

In 1994, in recognition of the impact of the Friends of Meridian Hill, president Bill Clinton presented the Friends of Meridian Hill with the Partnership Leadership Award in a White House ceremony. Since 2005, the Park Service has been working on a general restoration, carefully repairing and replacing the unique concrete structures as necessary, and replacing key utility systems. This ongoing work on the site continues today, and has resulted in a renovated asset for the city.

In 1994 the park was designated a National Historic Landmark, as &quot;an outstanding accomplishment of early 20th century Neoclassicist park design in the United States&quot;, and is today maintained as a part of Rock Creek Park. In 2014 the District of Columbia government approved creation of the &quot;Meridian Hill Historic District&quot; in the local neighborhood around the park, with the park itself in the center of the newly designated area.

The park is now a place that is well-used and enjoyed by local residents. On Sunday afternoons during warm weather, people gather from 3 to 9 p.m. in the upper park to dance and participate in a drum circle. This activity, held in the park since the 1950s, regularly attracts both enthusiastic dancers and professional drummers.

==Public art==

A central feature of Meridian Hill Park is the 13-basin &quot;Cascading Waterfall&quot; in the lower-level formal garden. The fountains are designed with a recirculating water system which, through an elaborate series of pumps, supplies water to two large circular fountains on the upper level, and cascade found on the lower. The many walls and stairways of the site&#x27;s composition add variety to the park, and because the central structure is on a hillside, some of the stairways are rather dramatic. The park also contains well-designed textured-concrete benches and urns, and patterned-concrete walkways.

The park plan conceived by Burnap and Peaslee was one composed to depict a formal Italian garden. The actual planting scheme was designed by New York landscape architects Vitale, Brinckerhoff, and Geiffert. In the past, gardens of this scope generally were reserved for aristocrats, but Meridian Hill Park, a product of democracy, was made for all people.

===Statues===

A number of finely-crafted sculptures and memorials have been placed in the park, some even as the grounds were under construction. These include:
* &quot;Serenity&quot; by sculptor Jose Clara (Josep Clarà i Ayats), dedicated to the memory of the U.S. Navy commander William H. Schuetze; it was carved out of a solid block of white marble and dedicated in 1924.
* &quot;Joan of Arc&quot;, a gift from the Ladies of France in Exile in New York in 1922, dedicated in the name of the 510th anniversary of the subject&#x27;s birth and mounted on a pedestal designed by McKim, Mead and White. It is a bronze cast of an 1889 statue by Paul Dubois. The statue was created for erection in front of Reims Cathedral in France, with two other casts now in Paris and Strasbourg. In Washington, a city of many equestrian statues, this is the only one to depict a woman on horseback. 
* &quot;Dante&quot;, an bronze sculpture by Ettore Ximenes. The statue, created in 1921, stands on a pedestal of sea-green granite and represents Italian poet Dante Alighieri dressed in the robe of a scholar.
* &quot;James Buchanan Memorial&quot;, the 15th president of the United States, sculpted by Hans Schuler. This imposing memorial was dedicated in 1930, and is today the only memorial to James Buchanan in Washington.
* Noyes Armillary Sphere, sculpted by C. Paul Jennewein and dedicated in 1936, it was removed in 1973 due to damage. It was either stolen or misplaced and a replica was installed in 2024.

==In popular culture==
Washington, D.C., area indie rock band Unrest named their fourth album &quot;Malcolm X Park&quot; after the unofficial name of the park.

<doc id="1320193" wikidata="Q244630" url="?curid=1320193" title="Zwiefacher">
<text>The Zwiefacher () is a southern German folk dance with a quick tempo and changing beat patterns.

== Location ==
The Zwiefacher is danced primarily in Bavaria, especially Lower Bavaria, Hallertau, and Upper Palatinate; it is also known in the Black Forest, Austria, Alsace, the Czech Republic, and Sudetenland.

== Name ==
The first documented use of the word &quot;Zwiefach&quot; was in 1780. It loosely translates as &quot;two times&quot; or &quot;double&quot;. Although this may be indicative of the &quot;two&quot; different time signatures, the title may refer to the &quot;couple&quot; being tightly wound against each other, a departure from earlier traditions. 
The dance is still known by various other names in different regions, such as &quot;Schweinauer&quot;, &quot;Schleifer&quot;, &quot;Übern Fuaß&quot;, &quot;Mischlich&quot;, &quot;Grad und Ungrad&quot;, &quot;Neu-Bayerischer&quot; and, above all &quot;Bairischer&quot; (meaning &quot;Farmer Dance&quot;, a name sometimes confused with the Bavarian polka).

The number of different names for the same dance should not be surprising, as the dance is older than the modern German language. Neither should one be surprised that the tunes themselves have multiple names. One German dance researcher, Felix Hoerburger, catalogued 112 different Zwiefacher tunes with 474 different names.

==Rhythm==
The Zwiefacher alternates between odd and even time signatures, changing from three to two beats per bar. The changes may occur regularly - for example, two measures per time signature, may change only once or may change irregularly throughout. Early Zwiefachers were played before the modern bar line was invented.

== Choreography ==
The couple turns very quickly in a closed position, similar to the waltz. Physically, the rhythmic shift looks like a change from normal waltz steps to &quot;Dreher&quot; steps (pivots), occasionally also to polka steps.

== Lyrics ==
Lyrics were often created as a mnemonic device to help learn Zwiefachers melodies by heart. This led to many songtexts for the same melodies. New lyrics are still sometimes used together with old melodies, as in the McDonald&#x27;s parody &quot;Hunger kriag I glei&quot; by &quot;Bayrisch-Diatonischer Jodelwahnsinn&quot;, which uses the same music as the &quot;Suserl-Zwiefache&quot;.

==Examples in European classical music==

* Carl Orff composed one dance of his &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; in the Zwiefacher form.
* The &quot;Furiant&quot; in act two of Bedřich Smetana&#x27;s &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot; is a variant of the Zwiefacher.
* In Telemann&#x27;s “Kleine Kammermusik” of 1716, in the B-flat major suite, Aria 6 is a Zwiefacher.

<text>Jeremiah Collins is a fictional character played primarily by Anthony George during the 1795 flashback on the ABC television gothic horror soap opera serial &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;.

==Story==
The character of Jeremiah Collins was born in 1763. In the original series, was depicted as the younger brother of Joshua Collins (Louis Edmonds) and Abigail Collins (Clarice Blackburn); also as the brother-in-law to Naomi Collins (Joan Bennett). Jeremiah was an uncle to Barnabas Collins (Jonathan Frid), who intended to marry Josette du Pres (Kathryn Leigh Scott).

However, Barnabas had a last minute fling on Martinique in 1795 with Josette&#x27;s maid, Angelique. Josette was never wiser, even to her death. Angelique heard from Barnabas that he still intended to wed Josette and that Angelique was the merest of flings. This news angered Angelique and she hexed Jeremiah, placing him in her thrall so he would marry Josette instead.

On the evening of Barnabas&#x27; and Josette&#x27;s wedding, under the influence of Angelique, Josette and Jeremiah giddily eloped. Later, feeling guilty or perhaps the spell&#x27;s effects had weakened, they returned to the Collins&#x27; family house to face the consequences of what they had done. After Barnabas Collins learned of their marriage, he challenged Jeremiah to a duel. The family tried to dissuade them, but caught in the passion of the moment, Barnabas insisted it go forward. Jeremiah was mortally wounded; he would later succumb to his wounds at 2:00 A.M.

In the 1991 revival series Jeremiah was Barnabas&#x27;s younger brother. Being hexed by Angelique and eloping with Josette plot is mostly the same but some details were altered. For example, Jeremiah and Josette did not return to home but were located by Barnabas; it was Jeremiah who challenged Barnabas to a duel; Barnabas promised not to harm Jeremiah and was going to keep his word, but Angelique had magically interfered so Jeremiah was killed in the duel.

<text>McEwan&#x27;s is a brand of beer owned by Carlsberg Marston&#x27;s Brewing Company. It was originally brewed by William McEwan&#x27;s Fountain Brewery in Edinburgh, Scotland. The McEwan&#x27;s brand passed to Heineken in 2008 after their purchase of Scottish &amp; Newcastle&#x27;s British operations. Heineken sold the brand to Wells &amp; Young&#x27;s in 2011, who sold their brewing operation, including the McEwan brand to Marston&#x27;s in 2017. Cans and bottles are now brewed in Bedford, England.

==History==
William McEwan opened the Fountain Brewery in Fountainbridge, Edinburgh, in 1856. The firm underwent several mergers in the following century, including with local rival William Younger&#x27;s, and later with Newcastle Breweries to form Scottish &amp; Newcastle. Its popular brands included 80/-, a Heavy beer, and Export, an India Pale Ale. All of the draught beers (except Best Scotch) were brewed at the Caledonian Brewery in Edinburgh, whilst the canned and bottled beers were produced at the Eagle Brewery in Bedford, England. The beers are sold predominantly in Scotland and the North East of England.

Despite being the dominant presence in Scottish brewing for around a century, the McEwan&#x27;s brands were neglected by Scottish &amp; Newcastle, who concentrated on their global brands. The McEwan&#x27;s ales were eclipsed by John Smith&#x27;s Bitter and Belhaven Best and cask-conditioned beers such as Deuchars IPA, whilst the lager fell behind Tennent&#x27;s.

McEwan&#x27;s used a cavalier mascot, broadly based on the Frans Hals painting, the &quot;Laughing Cavalier&quot; portrait, which has been used since the 1930s. The company was a sponsor of football teams in the 1980s and 1990s, including Rangers F.C and Blackburn Rovers.

The McEwan&#x27;s brand passed to Heineken in 2008 after their purchase of Scottish &amp; Newcastle&#x27;s British operations. Heineken sold the brand to Wells &amp; Young&#x27;s in 2011. In May 2017, Charles Wells Ltd sold its brewing business (including McEwan&#x27;s) to Marston&#x27;s.

===Victorian beginnings===

William McEwan opened the Fountain Brewery in Fountainbridge, then a suburb on the outskirts of Edinburgh, in 1856, using £2,000 loaned by his mother and his uncle. The area and the brewery are named after the spring waters from the vicinity, which, in addition to its proximity to the Caledonian railway line and the Union Canal, determined the location of the brewery. McEwan had employed geologists to identify the prime location for a supply of well water. Beforehand, McEwan had engaged in industrial espionage at Bass and Allsopp&#x27;s breweries in order to learn techniques and assay costs. After establishing a market share in the industrial regions of the Scottish lowlands, from the early 1860s, McEwan built up a successful colonial export trade by exploiting his family&#x27;s shipowning connections. It was during this time that McEwan&#x27;s India Pale Ale, the beer that was the foundation for much of the company&#x27;s reputation, was first labelled Export.

By the 1870s, McEwan&#x27;s brewery employed 170 men and boys, and its beers were widely available in England. By 1880, the brewery site covered 12 acres. McEwan&#x27;s 80/-, a Heavy beer, was first brewed in the late nineteenth century; the shilling &quot;/-&quot; denotion refers to the wholesale price for a hogshead of the beer. In 1886, as he prepared to enter Parliament, William McEwan appointed his nephew, William Younger, as managing director of the brewery. When the company was registered in 1889, it was worth £408,000 and had capital of £1 million; and was the largest brewery in the United Kingdom under a single owner. By the turn of the twentieth century the company had a large share of the market throughout Scotland, a 90% share of the Tyneside market, and was exporting to Scottish expatriates across the British Empire. At its peak, the brewery was producing two million barrels of beer a year, much of it for export.

===Twentieth-century mergers===

In 1907, McEwan&#x27;s acquired the trade and goodwill of Alexander Melvin &amp; Co of central Edinburgh. By 1914, McEwan&#x27;s bottled beers were distributed across the United Kingdom. In December 1930, McEwan&#x27;s merged with Edinburgh rival William Younger&#x27;s Brewery to form Scottish Brewers in a defensive move after the Great Depression diminished revenues. Each entity was initially run separately, and only certain financial and technological resources were amalgamated. During this period, the company became an early pioneer of container beer, largely due to its dependence on exports, particularly to the Royal Navy, where beer might be stored on board ships for up to a year. The NAAFI continued to be an important McEwan&#x27;s customer throughout the century. In the early-1930s, Jardine Matheson approached the company regarding a potential brewing venture in China, but McEwan&#x27;s did not welcome the threat to their export business.

The company&#x27;s export trade declined during and after the Second World War, and as a result, the Abbey Brewery in Edinburgh, previously the Younger&#x27;s brewery, closed down in 1956 and was converted into offices. By the 1950s, McEwan&#x27;s had become the dominant party in the McEwan Younger venture, and a full merger was undertaken in 1959. Scottish Brewers continued to increase its market share in the brewing sector, doubling its output after a costly five-year programme of expansion and modernisation undertaken between 1958-63.

The company merged with Newcastle Breweries in 1960, forming Scottish &amp; Newcastle, a group with market value of £50,000,000. William McEwan Younger, the son of William Younger, was the chairman and managing director. The company dedicated itself to the free trade, and promoted its brands to an extent not previously witnessed in the British brewing industry. McEwan&#x27;s Export became one of the three core brands of the new company, alongside Newcastle Brown Ale and Younger&#x27;s Tartan Special. Scottish &amp; Newcastle became the dominant force in brewing across Scotland and the North of England. From the 1960s, the company began to style itself MacEwan&#x27;s in export markets, in order to make pronunciation easier. The company&#x27;s McEwan&#x27;s Strong Ale was the highest gravity beer on general sale throughout the world. McEwan&#x27;s Export was alternatively sold as India Pale Ale or Scotch Ale overseas. William McEwan Younger retired in 1970.

The Fountain Brewery was rebuilt in 1973 and pioneered the use of computer control for the entire brewing process. The site had a 2 million barrel capacity, and occupied 22 acres on a new site which had formerly been occupied by a British Rubber mill. &quot;McEwan&#x27;s Export&quot; became a nationally distributed beer by the 1970s, and was the best 
-selling canned beer in the United Kingdom by 1975. McEwan&#x27;s Lager was introduced in 1976 as the demand for lager increased, but it struggled to gain credibility until the &quot;Alive and kicking&quot; campaign was launched in 1986. McEwan&#x27;s Export was launched in the United States in 1989. Two bottled ales were launched, McEwan&#x27;s Champion Ale (7.3%) in 1997 and McEwan&#x27;s Parliament Ale (5%) in 1999. In 2000, McEwan&#x27;s had 13% of the Scottish lager market and around 40% of the Scottish ale market. In 2003 &quot;McEwan&#x27;s 70/-&quot; was overtaken by Belhaven Best as Scotland&#x27;s best-selling ale, and McEwan&#x27;s Lager was discontinued.

===Closure of the Fountain Brewery===

In February 2004, Scottish &amp; Newcastle announced the closure of the Fountain Brewery. Production costs at Fountainbridge had become twice as high as those at the company&#x27;s lowest-cost brewery in Tadcaster, North Yorkshire. It closed in June 2005, with the loss of 170 jobs. Production of McEwan&#x27;s draught beers was transferred to the Caledonian Brewery with cans of &quot;McEwan&#x27;s Export&quot; being produced at John Smith&#x27;s Brewery in Tadcaster. The McEwan&#x27;s and Younger&#x27;s brands added around 50,000 barrels to the production of the Caledonian. The last regular batch of the cask-conditioned version of McEwan&#x27;s 80/- was brewed in 2006 after annual production dropped below 10,000 barrels, although the beer made a brief return in June 2011 and has since been brewed seasonally by W&amp;Y. &quot;McEwan&#x27;s Lager&quot; was reintroduced in 2009.

===Sale to Wells &amp; Young&#x27;s===
In October 2011, Heineken sold the McEwan&#x27;s beer brands to Wells &amp; Young&#x27;s for around £20 million, and production of McEwan&#x27;s Best Scotch and canned and bottled brands moved to Bedford. The new owners vowed to reintroduce McEwan&#x27;s as a cask ale brand and launch an expanded premium bottled range. Together with the Younger&#x27;s brands McEwan&#x27;s generated £80,000,000 of sales annually in the UK, with McEwan&#x27;s the largest Wells &amp; Young&#x27;s brand. It was the highest-selling ale brand in Scotland where it had a 20% market share. Like most largely pasteurised ale brands in the UK it had been in a state of managed decline. The beers were sold predominantly in Scotland and the north of England; a small amount was exported to Italy. 2012 saw the launch of &quot;McEwan&#x27;s Export&quot; in bottles, and a new seasonal cask-conditioned golden ale called &quot;McEwan&#x27;s Gold&quot;. In 2013, export sales to Canada were resumed, having been discontinued under Heineken. In April 2013, McEwan&#x27;s Red was launched, aimed at younger drinkers and with the intention of expanding the brand into England. McEwan&#x27;s beers began to be sold in France in April 2013. The bottled beers McEwan&#x27;s &quot;Amber&quot; and &quot;Signature&quot; were launched in July 2013.

===Sale to Marston&#x27;s===
In May 2017, Marston&#x27;s announced that it had acquired the McEwan&#x27;s brands as part of the acquisition of Charles Wells&#x27;s brewing interest with cans and bottles continuing to be brewed in Bedford, England. In April 2020, Marston&#x27;s placed its brewing business, including the McEwan&#x27;s brands, into a joint venture with Carlsberg.

===Closure of Caledonian Brewery===
In May 2022, Heineken announced the closure of its Caledonian Brewery which contract-brewed draught McEwan&#x27;s in Edinburgh. It said its own Scottish brands would be contract-brewed by Greene King&#x27;s Belhaven Brewery. There was no announcement on where McEwan&#x27;s draught would be brewed.

The Federation Brewery was closed in 2010, and production of &quot;McEwan&#x27;s Best Scotch&quot; was contracted to the Burtonwood Brewery, between Warrington and St Helens, until it moved to Bedford following the Wells &amp; Young&#x27;s takeover.

==Advertising==

Throughout the Victorian period, and into the twentieth century, McEwan&#x27;s drew heavily from imagery of the British Empire in its branding. The Laughing Cavalier mascot was introduced to the McEwan&#x27;s brand in the 1930s. Based on the well-known Frans Hals painting, it has been used extensively in advertisements and branding ever since. During the 1960s, and 1970s, McEwan&#x27;s was advertised as &quot;The best buy in beer&quot;.

From the 1970s until the early 1990s &quot;McEwan&#x27;s Best Scotch&quot; was marketed in the North East of England as &quot;The one you&#x27;ve got to come back for&quot;.

The &quot;alive and kicking&quot; campaign for &quot;McEwan&#x27;s Lager&quot; from 1986 until 1997 saw some of the most memorable and radical television advertisements yet produced at the time.

<text>Thomas John Dowd (October 20, 1925 – October 27, 2002) was an American recording engineer and producer for Atlantic Records. He was credited with innovating the multitrack recording method. Dowd worked on a veritable &quot;who&#x27;s who&quot; of recordings that encompassed blues, jazz, pop, rock, and soul records.

== Career ==

=== Early years ===
Born in Manhattan, New York City, Dowd grew up playing piano, tuba, violin, and string bass. His mother was an opera singer and his father was a concertmaster.

Dowd graduated from Stuyvesant High School in June 1942 at the age of 16. He continued his musical education at City College of New York. Dowd also played in a band at New York&#x27;s Columbia University, where he became a conductor. He was also employed at the physics laboratory of Columbia University.

=== Military work ===
At age 18, Dowd was drafted into the military with the rank of sergeant. He continued his work in physics at Columbia University. He worked on the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb. The purpose of the work was unclear until 1945. Dowd planned to obtain a degree in nuclear physics when he completed his work on the Manhattan Project. However, because his work was top secret, the university did not recognize it, and Dowd decided not to continue, since the university&#x27;s curriculum would not have been able to further his physics education. His research for the military was more advanced than academic courses at that time.

=== Music ===
Dowd took a job at a classical music recording studio until he obtained employment at Atlantic Records. His first hit was Eileen Barton&#x27;s &quot;If I Knew You Were Comin&#x27; I&#x27;d&#x27;ve Baked a Cake&quot;. He soon became a top recording engineer there and recorded popular artists such as Ray Charles, the Drifters, the Coasters, The Spinners, Ruth Brown and Bobby Darin, including Darin&#x27;s rendition of Kurt Weill/Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Mack the Knife&quot;. He captured jazz performances by John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, Thelonious Monk and Charlie Parker. It was Dowd&#x27;s idea to cut Ray Charles&#x27; recording of &quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot; into two parts and release them as the A-side and B-side of the same single record.

Dowd worked as an engineer and producer from the 1940s until the beginning of the 21st century. He recorded albums by many artists including Eddie Money, Bee Gees, Eric Clapton, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Black Oak Arkansas, Derek and the Dominos, Rod Stewart, Wishbone Ash, New Model Army, Cream, Lulu, Chicago, the Allman Brothers Band, Joe Bonamassa, the J. Geils Band, Meat Loaf, Sonny &amp; Cher, the Rascals, The Spinners, Willie Nelson, Diana Ross, Eagles, the Four Seasons, Kenny Loggins, James Gang, Dusty Springfield, Eddie Harris, Charles Mingus, Herbie Mann, Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s, Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin, Ronnie Earl, Joe Castro and Primal Scream. He was also an employee of Apex Studios in the 1950s. Dowd received a Grammy Trustees Award for his lifetime achievements in February 2002.

He died of emphysema on October 27, 2002, in Florida, where he had been living and working at Criteria Studios for many years, a week after his 77th birthday.

== Legacy ==
Dowd helped to shape the artists that he worked with, and because he worked with an array of great artists on some of the world&#x27;s greatest recordings, Dowd was highly influential in creating the sound of the second half of the 20th century. He encouraged Jerry Wexler of Atlantic Records to install an Ampex eight-track recorder, enabling Atlantic to be the first recording company to record using multiple tracks.

Dowd is credited as the engineer who popularized the eight-track recording system for commercial music and popularized the use of stereophonic sound. He also pioneered the use of linear channel faders as opposed to rotary controls on audio mixers. He devised various methods for altering sound after the initial recording. In 2003, director Mark Moormann premiered an award-winning documentary about his life entitled &quot;Tom Dowd and the Language of Music&quot;. In the 2004 biopic about musician Ray Charles, &quot;Ray&quot;, Tom Dowd was portrayed by actor Rick Gomez.

Dowd was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012.

<doc id="1320241" wikidata="Q7676139" url="?curid=1320241" title="Tailwater">
<text>Tailwater refers to waters located immediately downstream from a hydraulic structure, such as a dam, spillway, bridge or culvert. Generally measured and reported as the average water depth downstream of a hydraulic structure, tailwater can vary based on the outlet from the structure as well as downstream influences that may restrict or advance the usual flow of water from the structure. The creation of a tailwater will have significant impacts on both the abiotic and biotic conditions of the waterway. 
== Biotic Impacts ==
The environmental conditions in a tailwater influence the entire food web of the waterway. Consistent flows, higher temperatures, and clear water found in tailwaters create an ideal habitat for filamentous green algae. The near-shore zones of tailwaters that are submerged during hydropeaking but dry during consistent flows are far less productive areas of the waterway. Most algal species are not adapted to handle this exposure to air for extended periods of time resulting in a loss of primary productivity and an increase in organic matter that gets washed away when flow increases.

=== Macroinvertebrate impacts ===
Macroinvertebrate communities assemblages largely depend on algal composition of the waterway. With the conditions created by hydropeaking in tailwaters, much of the macroinvertebrate diversity is lost resulting in a few dominant taxa. For example, the Colorado River experiences dramatic flow changes due to the abundance of hydroelectric dams on the river. Below the major dams, between three and seven macroinvertebrate taxa account for over 95% of the total abundance in the system. Nearly half of these species are specialists who spend their entire lives underwater and do not provide energy to the surrounding terrestrial environment.

=== Native Fish impacts ===
Native fish species are particularly endangered by tailwaters. The construction of the tailwater itself is a severe environmental disturbance that can reduce richness, but immediately following dam completion, many native fish species can still be found. The long-term impacts on native fish communities, especially in historically warmwater systems, are especially dramatic. Before the completion of the Beaver Dam on the Ozark River, 62 species of fish from 19 unique families were present in the system. Following dam construction, only 18 species from 8 families were collected, with two families accounting for over 90% of the fish found. 30 years after the installment of the impoundment, 28 species of fish were sampled from 8 families, however 98% of the fish were either sculpin or trout species, both of which were essentially absent prior to the creation of the tailwater. This lack of species evenness results in an altered aquatic ecosystem that is far from the community makeup seen before the impoundment was in place. Substrate composition in tailwaters can also impact native fish survival. Some species, such as river chubs, construct nests from gravel and rocks found on the river bottom. Tailwater flows can alter substrate size making it difficult for native fish to build spawning areas. Increased flows can also flatten nesting sites or scour eggs from the nest making spawning in a tailwater system more difficult.

== Abiotic Impacts ==
The construction of a dam will often change the makeup of the body of water immediately upstream and downstream of the structure. In many cases, the water that comes out of the dam originates from the bottom of the reservoir created by the impoundment. The resulting dam discharge is relatively cold compared to the natural temperature of waterway due to the stratification of water that occurs in reservoirs. The resulting thermal pollution can have devastating impacts on native fish assemblages.

Tailwaters are also subject to changes in traditional flow rate. Some impoundments discharge a consistent amount of water which can disrupt seasonal fluctuations and extreme flow events. On the other hand, hydropeaking, the cyclical increase in discharge below a hydroelectric dam to meet power demands, can rapidly increase tailwater flow rates. The dramatic changes in river flow can scour the river bottom, change river velocity and depth, and reduce biotic richness in the waterway.

== Tailwater Fishery ==
Tailwater can also refer to a type of fishery. Fishing in tailwaters can be very productive due to consistent water temperature and flow rates found below an impoundment. Nutrients from the lake upstream are released into the tailwater, creating a productive environment in which target fish species, usually trout, can thrive. An example of this phenomenon is the fishery at Lee&#x27;s Ferry on the Colorado River in Arizona.

==Story==

===Josette and Barnabas===
Born in 1774 in France, her widowed father was Andre du Pres (David Ford) a wealthy sugarcane planter on the Caribbean island of Martinique. Raised by her father and her paternal aunt, the Countess Natalie du Pres (Grayson Hall), the lovely and sympathetic Josette came to Collinsport, Maine in 1795 to marry Barnabas Collins (Jonathan Frid).

Though Barnabas had become engaged to Josette following an earlier visit to Martinique, he had there enjoyed a brief dalliance with his fiancée&#x27;s personal maid, Angélique Bouchard (Lara Parker), who was secretly a powerful witch. When Angélique arrived in Collinsport, she immediately invited Barnabas to rekindle their relationship. However, Barnabas rejected her, declaring that he had always loved Josette but had been unsure of Josette&#x27;s love for him in Martinique.

Furious with jealousy, Angélique first tried to kill Barnabas and then hexed Josette, so that she fell in love with Barnabas&#x27;s young uncle, Jeremiah Collins (Anthony George), and he with her. Jeremiah and Josette eloped and were married; this incited Jeremiah and Barnabas to duel, ending in Jeremiah&#x27;s death. Still under Angélique&#x27;s spell, Josette disavowed her previous love for Barnabas, exclaiming that she would always love Jeremiah.

===The Tragedy of Josette===
Through a series of machinations, Angelique tricked the broken-hearted Barnabas to marry her. But once he discovered his new wife was a witch, Barnabas shot Angélique, planning to reunite with a now more receptive Josette. Believing herself to be dying, the witch cursed Barnabas, who died shortly after and rose as a vampire. His first act as a creature of the night was to strangle Angélique.

Grief-stricken, Josette readied herself to leave Collinsport with Natalie. Once bitten by Barnabas, Josette prepared to become his bride, though she clearly did not understand that Barnabas was now a vampire. Angélique caused Josette to have grotesque visions of herself as a vampire. Realizing at last what Barnabas was asking of her, and horrified and inconsolate, Josette committed suicide by jumping off the precipice at Widow&#x27;s Hill.

===The Strange Lives of Josette===
Barnabas Collins summoned the ghost of his lost love to his side not long after her death. But the now disfigured Josette begged him to be allowed to return to her grave. Horrified, the vampire allowed her to go to her rest. But the spirit of Josette was not yet at peace. Over the years, she was said to haunt the Old House. Often, her ghost was said to warn Collins family members of impending death or other misfortune. During the early days of the series, the ghost of Josette, dressed in white, sometimes appeared to young David Collins (David Henesy).

In a later storyline, the ghost of Quentin Collins (David Selby) killed David and drove the Collins family out of their mansion. Barnabas traveled back in time to 1897 to prevent these events by changing history. During this storyline, he falls in love with Lady Kitty Hampshire, who resembles Josette. When Barnabas learned that Lady Kitty actually is Josette, they are transported back in time to the night Josette committed suicide. Barnabas managed to prevent Josette from jumping off of Widow&#x27;s Hill. Unfortunately, Barnabas was soon captured by the Leviathans. Josette became disconsolate at Barnabas&#x27; disappearance and committed suicide by drinking poison. In the present (1970), the Leviathans claim that they are keeping Josette hostage in the past, leading Barnabas, Julia and Maggie to attempt to contact the spirit of Josette in a séance to learn if she was indeed held prisoner. Josette appears to Barnabas for one final time, telling him that the Leviathans are not holding her prisoner. She parts with Barnabas by telling him to let her go and focus on his own future.

Josette re-appeared in the 1840 parallel time storyline. In this alternate reality, Barnabas never became a vampire and married Josette. Barnabas had died but Josette was still alive as an elderly widow. Her son Bramwell was the protagonist dealing with a curse placed upon the family by their ancestor Brutus Collins. Josette also had an illegitimate child by Barnabas&#x27; cousin Justin Collins named Melanie. Justin offered to divorce his wife, Flora Collins (Joan Bennett), but Josette insisted he remain married and gave Melanie to Justin and Flora to raise as a foundling. Flora was never aware of Melanie&#x27;s parentage. Justin&#x27;s sister, Julia Collins (Grayson Hall) learned years earlier.

==Other appearances==
The character then returned in the 2009 audio drama &quot;Final Judgement&quot; released by Big Finish Productions.

==Character development==

When Josette was first mentioned in the TV series, her name was established as Josette la Frenière and she was the great grandmother of Elizabeth Collins Stoddard and Roger Collins. Sad and lonely from being shunned by the townspeople of Collinsport for being an outsider, Josette committed suicide by jumping to her death from Widows&#x27; Hill in 1834. Jeremiah Collins, angry at his wife for taking her own life, had Josette buried away from the rest of the Collins family in a forlorn spot at Eagle Hill Cemetery. This backstory would be radically changed during the 1795 storyline.

It is heavily implied prior to the events seen in 1795 that Victoria Winters has a strong connection to Josette. Characters remark on their physical similarities, and Josette&#x27;s ghost not only frequently uses Victoria as a medium, but also protects her. At one point, Elizabeth is visibly disturbed when Victoria suggests she herself is related to Josette. Due to technical limitations at the time, it would have been impossible for actress Alexandra Moltke to portray both characters when the series explored the events which turned Barnabas Collins into a vampire. As actress Kathryn Leigh Scott had played the ghost of Josette on occasion, it was only natural for the role to go to her. Any link between Victoria and Josette was quietly forgotten, although the idea that the two characters were connected would be resurrected in the 1991 NBC revival which featured Joanna Going portraying both Victoria and Josette.
